<HEADLINE> Iran's Border Guards Kill 8 MKO Members </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian border guards
Sunday killed eight members of the Iranian outlawed Mujahiden
Khalq Organization (MKO) who entered Iran by crossing the frontier
line with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The official news agency IRNA said that the Iranian border
guards seized a machine-gun, a Klashinkov rifle and rocket
propeller grenade from the MKO members.
</P>
<P>
Another team of three MKO members who had entered the
Iranian territory two days ago gave up themselves to the
Iranian border guards, IRNA said.
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, four MKO members were killed on the Iranian
border when they tried to penetrate into Iran through the
country's southwestern border of Mehran.
</P>
<P>
The MKO was one of the main opposition groups which
fought against the former Shah regime but it was outlawed
after the Islamic Republic of Iran was established in 1979.
</P>
<P>
During the past years, the MKO launched a series of
military actions against the Iranian government and in a
retaliation, the Iranian air forces raided the MKO bases
inside Iraq for several times.

<HEADLINE> JET Announce Breakthrough in Nuclear Fusion Performance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Scientists at the Joint European
Torus (JET) announced here today they had created new world
records again in imitating the energy-producing process of the
Sun. The breakthrough will make it possible for mankind to harness
a safe, clean and endless source of energy.
</P>
<P>
JET broke the world record for power fusion on October 31, by
using the deuterium-tritium fuel mixture. The power output peaked
at 16.1 megawatts, said Tom Elsworth, who is in charge of public
relations at JET.
</P>
<P>
It also broke the world record for the ratio of fusion power
produced to the net input power with 0.65 in the same experiment.
</P>
<P>
"Almost the same results were obtained twice within two hours,
that means the experiment can be repeated," he added.
</P>
<P>
The former record was created by JET on September 22 when
output power peaked at 12.9 megawatts and the ratio of fusion
power produced to the net input power was 0.6.
</P>
<P>
If the ratio is above 1, the fusion will not only be maintained
by the energy it releases, but also output net energy.
</P>
<P>
In November 1991, for the first time, controlled fusion power
was produced by JET with output power peaking at 1.7 megawatts. In
November, 1994, the U.S. Tokamak Fusion Test Reactor has produced
10.7 megawatts of fusion power at a ratio of 0.28.
</P>
<P>
JET, based at Abingdon, Oxfordshire, Britain, is seen as the
largest and most successful fusion experiment in the
world. Construction began in 1978 and the project has been
operational since 1983.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Reaffirms Commitment to Protect Children's Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 3 (Xinhua) -- President Fidel Ramos today
reiterated the Philippine government's commitment to protect
children's rights and welfare and ensure them a bright future.
</P>
<P>
Meeting with some orphans at the Presidential Palace, Ramos
said with the enactment of new laws, full protection of children's
rights and privileges will now be assured.
</P>
<P>
Ramos recently signed into law two bills approved by Congress.
One is about the establishment of children and family courts
throughout the country to enable kids who become victims of
neglect, abuse or exploitation to get speedy justice.
</P>
<P>
The other one is Children's Television Act which provides a
mechanism to monitor the contents of all television programs and
advertisements to create a healthy environment for the physical
and spiritual growth of children.
</P>
<P>
"There is not doubt that this new law will assure the access of
Filipino children to quality educational programs and, at the same
time, minimize obscenity and violence on television," Ramos said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the state shall act on behalf of children when
their parents or guardians fail or are unable to protect them, or
when they are victimized by their parents or guardians.
</P>
<P>
"Be assured that we will continue to protect your future
towards a more developed physical, emotional, intellectual and
spiritual welfare," Ramos said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the president also emphasized that family should be
the basic social unit that provides protection to children's
physical, moral, spiritual and intellectual growth and
development.

<HEADLINE> PLO Deems Washington Talks Decisive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 3 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of the
Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) termed today's talks in
Washington between the Palestinians and Israelis as decisive as
they will help outline stances of all parties.
</P>
<P>
PLO chief delegate Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen) and Israeli
Foreign Minister David Levy will head their delegations at the
talks sponsored by U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright in
the U.S. capital today.
</P>
<P>
In an interview granted Monday morning to the Cairo-based Voice
of Arabs radio, Zakaria al Agha, a member of the PLO Executive
Committee, pointed out that the three sides have agreed on an
agenda that includes issues of redeployment, unilateral measures,
security matters as well as final phase negotiations.
</P>
<P>
He voiced hope that the U.S., as the main peace sponsor, will
honor its commitments towards the peacemaking.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hassan Asfour, director of the Palestinian
Negotiations Department, expressed pessimism over the Washington
talks.
</P>
<P>
He accused the Israeli government of "wasting time," saying
that the Israeli delegation is not authorized to adopt resolutions
regarding basic issues such as settlement and redeployment.
</P>
<P>
"The Palestinian-Israeli negotiations should depend on what had
been agreed upon in the first round of talks held in the
U.S. under Albright, otherwise they will become a mere waste of
time," he told Monte Carlo radio.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-backed meetings, the second round of high-level talks
in seven months of Palestinian-Israeli standoff, was postponed
from October 27 until today.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have been at odds over Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu's proposal to move straight into accelerated
"final status" talks that will tackle more difficult issues like
the future of settlements and Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians demand that Israel first implement
long-delayed withdrawal of Israeli troops in most rural areas of
the West Bank and agree on a freeze in settlement activities.

<HEADLINE> Belgium Cremates Cattle Hit by Mad Cow Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Belgium today destroyed 32
head of cattle to prevent a spread of mad cow disease after the
country spotted its first case of the disease.
</P>
<P>
The positive diagnosis in a herd made Belgium the eighth
European country to report the presence of encephalopathie
spongiforme bovine, commonly known as mad cow disease.
</P>
<P>
The incinerated cattle were raised on a farm in Namur
province. The disease was confirmed at the weekend after sampling
checks by the Belgian Veterinary Institute.
</P>
<P>
Further laboratory analyses at a European research center at
Weybridge in Britain confirmed that the cattle had contracted the
disease which is transmissible to human beings.
</P>
<P>
Mad cow disease is suspected of provoking in human beings a new
form of the fatal disease known as Creutzfeldt-Jacob, which has
already claimed 21 lives in Britain.
</P>
<P>
The Belgian Agricultural Ministry has planned to launch an
investigation into cattle feed at the farm.
</P>
<P>
Cases of mad cow disease have been reported in Switzerland,
Ireland, Portugal, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Britain.

MOSCOW, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Georgian President Eduard
Shevardnadze today defended the role of the Commonwealth of
Independent States (CIS), saying the existence of the CIS is
important for developing regional cooperation and safeguarding
member countries' independence.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the national radio in the capital,
Tbilisi, Shevardnadze dismissed the idea that the CIS is useless
and Georgia should quit it.
</P>
<P>
The CIS explores great geopolitical potential for wide-ranging
cooperation between the member states, Itar-Tass News Agency
quoted Shevardnadze as saying.
</P>
<P>
The body was conducive to member countries' efforts in
protecting and consolidating their independence, territorial
integrity and maintaining national stability, he said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the close relations between Georgia and Ukraine,
Shevardnadze said the strategic alliance of the two states is
aimed at enhancing the CIS, and it had proved a successful attempt
in bringing out the CIS' potential.
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze also noted the key role of Russia in the CIS. "It
is doubtless that Russia has a special place in the CIS and the
fate of the CIS hinges greatly on Russia," he said.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Denies Preventing UN Team from Doing Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Minister of Culture and
Information Hammam Abdul-Khalek today denied that his country
prevented U.N. arms inspection teams from doing their work, Iraq
News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark in an apparent bid to defuse the tension
between Iraq and the U.N. caused by Iraqi blocking of an American
inspector from entering an inspection site this morning.
</P>
<P>
The missile team that included an American, and two other U.N.
inspection groups sent out this morning were called back to
headquarters after the incident.
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Khalek explained that the Iraqi authorities told the team
members that the American should stay out while the other members
could get into the site and do their work.
</P>
<P>
"The first team of the U.N. arms inspectors decided not to get
in and returned to their headquarters. The other teams turned back
before they got to the sites because they got relevant notice from
their headquarters in Baghdad," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi minister said that the U.N. arms inspection teams
could fulfill their duties according to schedule and within the
framework agreed upon with the Iraqi authorities. Only Americans
working in the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) in charge of
dismantling Iraqi mass destruction weapons are barred from working
in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
According to U.N. sources here, the UNSCOM decided today to
suspend its activities in Iraq in view of the fact that its
American members were not allowed to participate in the inspection.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi ruling Revolutionary Command Council issued a
statement on October 29 demanding all Americans working in the
U.N. weapons inspection teams to leave Iraq within a week.
</P>
<P>
The move was to protest against a U.N. Security Council
resolution threatening a travel ban on some of Iraqi officials if
the Baghdad government continued to block U.N. inspectors' work.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has repeatedly accused the Americans in the U.N. teams of
conducting espionage and trying to delay the lifting of the
economic sanctions against now in its seventh year.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Iraq again refused the entry into its territory of
the three American weapons inspectors it turned away earlier on
Thursday, despite U.S. warning of serious consequences.
</P>
<P>
The United States has not ruled out military action to force
Baghdad into compliance, although force is opposed by Russia,
France and a number of Arab states.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Russia will not necessarily lose
its sovereignty over the Kuril islands, even if it reaches an
agreement with Japan to sign a peace treaty by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Alexei Mitrofanov, chairman of the committee for geopolitics in
Russia's State Duma, made this point to the Itar-Tass news agency
today.
</P>
<P>
It was necessary for the two countries to discuss the Kurils
problem and the signing of a peace treaty. But no time limits
should be set for such talks, the chairman said.
</P>
<P>
"Russia should not hurry to make decisions pertaining to its
inner interests since it might cause irretrievable damage to its
national security," he said.
</P>
<P>
Differences between Russia and Japan would be settled by
creating a financial and business center in the Kurils, which
aimed at promoting economic development of the region on a
mutually beneficial basis, he said.
</P>
<P>
During their two-day informal meeting which started on
Saturday, Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Japanese Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto agreed to sign a peace treaty and
partly resolve territorial and other problems between the two
countries by the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> Cook Outlines Britain's EU Presidency Priorities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 3 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook outlined the priorities of Britain's European Union (EU)
presidency in Dubin early today, saying "Give Europe back to the
people" is its main mission.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Institute for European Affairs in Dublin, Cook
said that the agenda of Britain's EU presidency in the first half
of next year would be based on "the concerns of the peoples of
Europe."
</P>
<P>
Cook, who is on a brief visit to Ireland, stressed that
unemployment, the main headache haunting all the EU countries,
would be at the top of the agenda.
</P>
<P>
On the crucial single European currency, due to be launched on
January 1 1999, Cook said: "Even though we will not be taking part
in the first wave in 1999, it is still in our interest that it
should succeed."
</P>
<P>
"We will use our presidency to ensure that those countries who
wish to form a single currency can get off to the best possible
start," he added.
</P>
<P>
Cook also said the Labor government wanted to press ahead with
planned talks on enlarging the 15-nation bloc, adding that the
negotiations should start with the states best prepared for
membership.
</P>
<P>
"Opening talks with those who are still not ready would raise
hopes unfairly. It would soon leave them disappointed and
disillusioned," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Britain (will) help those who have further to travel, to make
sure they are not being rejected. The enlargement process must be
like a pipeline," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Secretary pointed out that the other major tasks
during Britain's presidency would be fighting crime, drugs and
protecting the environment.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Advised to Tap European Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's local food manufacturers
should take advantage of the European demand for imported Zimbabwean
products and increase their exports in that market, a German marketing
consultant said today.
</P>
<P>
Presenting a paper on food marketing at a seminar on productivity,
environment and trade, the German marketing consultant Gerhard Hiese
said there was vast potential for local food products in Europe.
</P>
<P>
He said European consumers had a high purchasing power which
enabled them to afford imported foods. He singled out France and
Germany as some of the countries with high spending consumers.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, if local manufacturers were to penetrate the lucrative
European market, they had to produce high quality products.
</P>
<P>
"Consumers in Europe are very particular about quality and
potential exporters should have a comprehensive understanding of the
market before they enter," he said.
</P>
<P>
Among some of the products that have a ready market in Europe are
poultry, frozen foods, fruits and vegetables, dairy products,
cereals, non-alcoholic beverages and fish.
</P>
<P>
Opening the two-day seminar, Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries
(CZI) President Jonee Blanchfield called on local manufacturers
to expand their markets by increasing exports to help the economy grow.
</P>
<P>
The seminar, organized by the CZI, will discuss consumer demands,
market requirements for food products and environmental cost
management in manufacturing.

<HEADLINE> Experts Recommend Ways for Treatment of Heart Diseases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Health experts have recommended
guidelines to prevent and treat cardiovascular diseases, paving
the way for a more effective treatment of millions of patients
suffering form thrombotic disorders, according to a press release
issued here today by the World Health Organization (WHO).
</P>
<P>
At a meeting held in Geneva on October 27-31 by the WHO Expert
Committee on Biological Standardization, the experts adopted a new
set of guidelines for oral anticoagulants, a class of drugs
inhibiting blood clotting.
</P>
<P>
These drugs cannot be prescribed at a fixed dose. For each
patient the dose must be adjusted according to the result of a
vitally important blood clotting test to be conducted every four
weeks. If the dose is low the patient is at risk of developing
thrombosis. If the dose is high the patient is at risk of
spontaneous bleeding.
</P>
<P>
The new test requires the use of laboratory reagents called
thromboplastins which are commercial products producing different
clotting times for a particular blood sample. In the past, all too
often, patients going to different hospitals were given different
prescriptions depending on the type of thromboplastins used by the
hospital.
</P>
<P>
Patients suffering from thrombotic disorders have clots of
coagulated blood that forms within a blood vessel or inside the
heart and remains at the site of its formation, often impeding the
flow of blood.
</P>
<P>
For the most part, the thrombotic disorders are linked to
circulatory diseases, such as heart attack and stroke, which
account for at least 15 million deaths every year. Many millions
more are disabled by them. The costs of caring for patients with
circulatory diseases account for about 10 percent of direct health
care costs in developed countries.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Oil Exports to S. Africa Remain Stable: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Iranian Foreign
Minister Kamal Kharrazi said today that Iranian export of crude oil
to South Africa remain stable.
</P>
<P>
He said it was not accurate when some reports said that Iranian
crude oil exports to South Africa had fallen by about 12 million
barrels last year while those from Saudi Arabia rose to about 16
million barrels.
</P>
<P>
"Actually, I don't think there has been a decrease. We have very
good relations in terms of oil sales to South Africa. I don't think
there will be drastic change in the amount of business we have with
South Africa," Kharrazi told reporters after meeting his South African
counterpart Alfred Nzo in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi, who arrived here for the second sitting of the joint
commission of Iran and South Africa, said there was a strong political
will in South Africa and Iran to enhance their economic relations.
</P>
<P>
"What remains is for us to promote trade relations between our two
countries," Kharrazi said.
</P>
<P>
Iran is South Africa's main source of crude oil, but the
latter has increasingly looked at other markets, informed sources
said.
</P>
<P>
The South African Petroleum Industry Association has said that
Iranian crude oil exports to South Africa fell to 68.2 million barrels
in 1996 from 80.7 million barrels in 1995. Crude from Kuwait rose to
20.9 million barrels from 4.2 million barrels.
</P>
<P>
Referring to a stalled oil storage agreement which gives Iran
access to strategic facilities at Saldanha Bay in the Western Cape
Province, Kharrazi said Iran was at present not interest in making use
of South Africa's oil storage facilities at Saldanha Bay.
</P>
<P>
"Right now we don't think there is such a need, " he said, saying
that Iran had a strong shipping line to move its oil to end-users,
removing the need for a storage facility along the way.
</P>
<P>
The idea of Iran storing about 15 million barrels of oil at
Saldanha north of Cape Town was raised in 1995. Although no agreement
on the matter has been signed, a study on the environmental impact of
such a move was commissioned.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi was likely to discuss the matter with South African
Minister of of Energy and Minerals Penuell Manduna tomorrow, Foreign
Minister Nzo said today.

<HEADLINE> UN to Try New Strategy in Afghan Mediation: Holl </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. is considering
changing its strategy in brokering peace in Afghanistan by
shifting the focus from the Afghan warring factions to the
regional countries with influence upon the country, U.N. Special
Envoy to Afghanistan Norbert Holl said today.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. Secretary General is preparing for a peace conference
which will involve a very small number of countries of influence
in Afghanistan", Holl told Xinhua in an exclusive interview at the
United Nations Special Mission to Afghanistan (UNSMA) based in the
Pakistani capital.
</P>
<P>
The UNSMA has been focusing its attention on mediating between
the Afghans during the past five years, but the lack of comprise
among all Afghan parties has rendered this method fruitless so
far, the UN envoy said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the U.N. is trying a new method, he said. "If we
cannot do it from inside, let's try from the outside," he added.
</P>
<P>
The countries with influence has not yet in the past seriously
discussed with the U.N. mission how to solve the Afghanistan
dilemma, but the U.N. is now trying to build a more solid, a more
reliable and a more open cooperative relationship with these
countries, Holl said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that foreign interference, which has always been
existing, is another major reason for the continuation of war in
the country.
</P>
<P>
Holl stressed the important position of Iran and Pakistan in
the peace-finding process in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
He also mentioned the importance of Central Asian republics and
other regional countries which have great influence in the
political arena of the world.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the peace conference is not an easy thing, Holl
said that the preparatory work must be very careful and therefore
takes long to ensure a final success.
</P>
<P>
Holl, who resumed his office last July, has submitted
resignation to U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan. He will leave
here at the end of this year.

<HEADLINE> French Trucking Labor Conflict Sides to Resume Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The two labor conflict sides of
France's trucking transport industry will resume talks on Tuesday,
after lorry drivers set up hundreds of barriers to block highways
across the country to push for a raise of salary.
</P>
<P>
Jehan de Marne, the president of the main organization of
owners of trucking companies in France UFT said that he was
favorable in principle to return to the table of negotiations,
after quitting it early Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
UFT could sign a compromise agreement with the union
representatives this time, said UNOSTRA, the union of owners of
smaller trucking companies.
</P>
<P>
The UFT quit the negotiation table in the early morning of
Sunday after refusing to sign a text agreeing to a 20 percent
raise of salary of truckers before the year 2,000.
</P>
<P>
But the main trade union participating in the strike, the Force
Ouvriere (FO), said that the renewed talks should be more
conformed to the "reality in the field to the requests of the
employees on strike."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the blockade of highways by the lorry drivers has
raised concern and criticism in France and abroad, and raised
panic in a number of neighboring countries, after it reminded one
of last year's paralysis caused by a 12-day blockade by the
truckers.
</P>
<P>
One lorry driver was wounded today by a striker at a blockade
in Villefranche-sur-Saone on a highway linking Lyon with Paris.
</P>
<P>
France's national employers' organization CNPF said in a
communique today that the strike is weakening the economic
resumption of France and are hurting several economic sectors.
</P>
<P>
Spanish lorry drivers waged a protest against the strike today
in Villefranche-sur-Saone in the Rhone in southern France, to show
their refusal to become the "hostage" of the French lorry drivers.
</P>
<P>
Spanish lorry drivers also forced open a blockage on a highway
between Lyon and Paris today.
</P>
<P>
Angry French lorry drivers today seized several roads in the
port area of the northern city of Rouen, while about 170 barriers
were counted on the highways across France by mid-day today.
</P>
<P>
Some oil storages and refinery factories were also blocked
today by lorry drivers, while the country's petroleum industry
union, UFIP, protested the move.
</P>
<P>
"We perfectly understand that the truckers use their right of
strike, which is constitutional and legitimate. But blocking the
roads and the oil storages is an act of another nature which can
have very grave repercussions on the daily life of all and on
enterprises," said Bernard Calvet, president of UFIP.

<HEADLINE> Jordan`s Public Sector Doctors Ends Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Health professionals employed in
Jordan`s public sector today ended a three-day strike but failed
to press the government to give them 60 percent share of the
revenues collected from rich patients.
</P>
<P>
However, the organizers will discuss new actions and will
possibly resume strike next Monday, said Raef Faris, a member of
the executive council of the Jordan Medical Association (JMA).
</P>
<P>
The strike across the country involved 22 public hospitals and
650 health centers, and organizations such as JMA, Jordan Dentist
Association, Jordan Pharmacist Association and Jordan Doctors
Association.
</P>
<P>
In the kingdom, the poor people and government employees can be
treated free of charge in public hospitals and health centers. The
rich patients pay an estimated annual treatment fee of 37 million
Jordanian dinars (about 52 million U.S. dollars), with revenues
reaching 7 million dinars (about 10 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Health promised in a 1996 agreement with JMA to
give 60 percent of annual revenues to the health professionals.
But it lowered the percentage to 36 on the ground that money was
needed to cover operational costs of the hospitals and health
center, prompting the nationwide strike.
</P>
<P>
The first revenue-sharing agreement was signed between the JMA
and the ministry in 1992. It was stipulated then that health
professionals could get 50 percent of the revenues collected from
rich patients.

<HEADLINE> Eastern Europe's Economy Forecast to Grow 1.7% in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Economies of the countries of
eastern Europe, the Baltics and the Commonwealth of Independent
States (CIS) are expected to grow by 1.7 percent in 1997 as a
whole, the first time since the region began the shift to market
economies seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
However, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development
(EBRD) said in its annual health check on the region's economies
that after years of contraction, the overall output is only 70
percent of its 1989 level.
</P>
<P>
The bank noted that continued progress in structural reform has
been made in most countries of the region, but there are great
disparities in the transition to a market economy.
</P>
<P>
Those countries which have reformed more vigorously have
recovered from recession more rapidly and attracted greater
private capital inflows, said the bank's 1997 Transition Report.
</P>
<P>
The main reason for the region's turn-around in output is the
recovery from recession of the area's largest economy the Russian
economy, which is predicted to show "cautious but positive" growth
of about one percent.
</P>
<P>
The economies of 11 of the 25 countries are set to grow by more
than four percent while six of them are still showing falling
output, with the economies of Turkmenistan and Albania forecast to
contract this year by 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
The report said that investment in the region has increased
over the past two years and is expected to top 55 billion U.S.
dollars this year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the bank pointed out that corruption remains a major
disincentive to investors, particularly in the CIS. Income
inequality and poverty have also increased throughout the region.

MOGADISHU, November 3 (Xinhua) -- At least 12 people, eight
of whom children, have died in the floods which hit Bardhere
district of Gedo region as heavy rains continue to cause
fatalities in human lives and animals in the country.
</P>
<P>
According to the police commander of the town, Gurhan Hirsi
Ali, the floods came after the town has experienced one of its
heaviest rains for more than 30 years.
</P>
<P>
Ali said the heavy rains has continued for 14 days, with the
floods and the destruction emerging in the last seven days.
</P>
<P>
The police commander who spoke with the journalists via radio
in Bardhere said the rain waters alone could not affect the town
much, but the disaster started when Jubba River crushed its banks
and over flew its nearby residential areas.
</P>
<P>
"As many as 250 houses were destroyed by the floods which also
divided the town into two parts," said Ali.

<P>
More than 30 people are believed to have died in the regions
of Gedo, Bay Bakol, Kiwer and Middle Jubba in the past three
weeks since the heavy rains and floods began.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of animals, mainly cattle and goats, were also
washed away by the waters, and dozens of villages and towns which
remain isolated by flood that cut off the roads linking them to
the other towns.
</P>
<P>
In the capital, Mogadishu, rains have been falling heavily,
fortunately with no fatalities reported.
</P>
<P>
However, the commodities such as the coal, meat, vegetables
and imported food items have increased in price sharply in
Mogadishu owing to mal-communication resulted from the waters.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Hopes for Improved Greece-Turkey Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus believes an improvement
in the relations between Greece and Turkey will positively reflect
on Cyprus, a government spokesman said here today.
</P>
<P>
Manolis Christofides said at his daily press briefing that
today's meeting on the Greek island Crete between Greek Prime
Minister Costas Simitis and his Turkish counterpart Mesut Yilmaz
will open a "window of hope" for Cyprus, like their Madrid meeting
last July.
</P>
<P>
Simitis and Yilmaz are due to meet during a two-day summit of
Balkan leaders that began Monday in Crete.
</P>
<P>
On the sidelines of last July's Madrid summit of North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO), the two premiers agreed to ease
tensions in the Aegean, where the two countries have almost come
to blows over sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
"We look forward and hope that an improvement in the relations
between Greece and Turkey will be achieved as this will also
reflect on Cyprus," Christofides said.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops landed
and took over the northern third of the island in the wake of an
abortive pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey, both NATO allies and guarantors of Cyprus'
independence under a 1960 treaty, have long been at adds over
this eastern Mediterranean strategic island.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether Simitis will raise the Cyprus problem to Yilmaz,
the spokesman said "we know that in every meeting with Turkish
officials, Simitis puts on the top of agenda Greece's views
regarding the promotion of a Cyprus solution."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, leaders and representatives of six Greek Cypriot
and four Turkish Cypriot political parties met today at the
U.N.-controlled Ledra Palace Hotel in Nicosia to exchange views
on the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
A joint communique, issued at the end of the meeting, says that
they hope that the meeting between the prime ministers of Greece
and Turkey, in Crete, will be successful.

<HEADLINE> ECOMOG Commanders Meet S. Leone Army Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Commanders of the west African
peacekeeping force (ECOMOG) have met Sierra Leone's chief of army
staff for the first time for amicable talks, military sources
said today.
</P>
<P>
The talks, held on Sunday in Orogoo, 17 km from the Sierra
Leonean capital of Freetown, focused on the modalities of a peace
accord signed last month to end the crisis in the country.
</P>
<P>
Buhari Musa who led the six-man ECOMOG team and Chief of Army
Staff Samuel Williams who headed the Sierra Leonean group had
friendly talks, said west African diplomats, quoted by a report
reaching here.
</P>
<P>
According to the peace agreement, signed in Conakry, capital
of neighboring Guinea, the military junta in Freetown, which
seized power in the May 25 coup, should hand over power to ousted
President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah in April next year.
</P>
<P>
Since the coup, forces loyal to the junta have been in a
virtual state of war with ECOMOG, which has been mandated to
enforce economic sanctions and embargo on the junta in a bid to
restore Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, ECOMOG said they would stop disarming Sierra
Leonean soldiers passing through its checkpoints while the Sierra
Leoneans said they would return weapons captured from two ECOMOG
bases, according to military sources.
</P>
<P>
The friendly atmosphere of the talks has won welcome from
diplomats.
</P>
<P>
One of them was quoted as saying that "if the trend continues,
the peace agreement would far excced the expectations of both
sides."
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG Force Commander Victor Malu, based in the Liberian
capital of Monrovia, is expected to visit Freetown shortly to
plan the deployment of ECOMOG troops in Sierra Leone, one
diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
"His talks will focus mainly on the strategic positions to be
occupied by the allied troops for the disarmament of combatants
and the supervision of the supply of relief items."
</P>
<P>
These positions will include the main ports and strategic
locations in the city and the interior, he added.
</P>
<P>
In another development, Sierra Leone's chief of Defense Staff
Sam Koroma on Sunday sent a message of solidarity to his Guinean
counterpart on the 28th anniversary of the defeat of a Portuguese
led mercenary invasion in 1969.
</P>
<P>
President Kabbah has been on exile in Guinea since the coup.

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah Announces New Recruiting Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Hezbollah Secretary
General Sayyed Hasrallah today announced a more lenient
recruiting policy that will allow all those who wish to join the
resistance the right to do so.
</P>
<P>
Hasrallah said in a news conference today that every Lebanese
who wants to join the fighting against occupying Israeli troops
will be admitted as long as he meets two conditions - a normal
level mentally, psychologically and physically, and no
relationship or contact with their enemy Israelis.
</P>
<P>
He said the would-be fighters will be put into groups named as
Lebanese resistance squads against Israeli occupation and
Hezbollah will lead them and provide them every condition to
defeat Israelis.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the Shiite Muslim Party of God will bear all the
responsibilities for the families whose member is killed or
injured when he fights with Israelis, he said.
</P>
<P>
Under the current policy, a Hezbollah fighter can get a
minimum of 300 U.S. dollars a month plus benefits such as food for
their families.
</P>
<P>
If he is killed, his family will receive a house, medical
care, education and monthly pensions of at least 350 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Now, most Hezbollah fighters come from the country's south, a
region of few economic opportunities.
</P>
<P>
In the conference, Hasrallah also announced a cellular phone
number for further contacts, saying that is for the sake of
security and precision.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that some 4,000 Hezbollah fighters with a
total of 20,000 supports are fighting in an attempt to drive the
1,000 Israeli troops from south Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Denounces Turkish Maneuvers in Northern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The Cypriot government has
denounced the presence of Turkish naval vessels and military
aircraft in Turkish Cypriot-controlled northern Cyprus as
provocations.
</P>
<P>
More than 40 warplanes and warships, along with some
Turkish military units, are reported to take part in military
exercises "Taurus" in northern Cyprus, which started today, and
"Determination" in the Aegean.
</P>
<P>
"We condemn these exercises and we consider them a show
of strength as well as a display of unwillingness to respect
international law and order," government spokesman Manolis
Christofides said here today at his daily press briefing.
</P>
<P>
The use of F-16 fighters in mock air-raids in the Republic's
air-space proves that the Cypriot government's decision to buy
anti-aircraft missiles was right, Christofides added.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government decided early this year to buy
Russian-made S-300 surface-to-air missiles, scheduled for
deployment in mid-1998.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has responsed with threats that it will launch
preemptive strike if the missiles are deployed.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish military exercises took place amid tensions
between Turkey and Greece following a Greek and Cypriot joint
military exercise last month.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters here today, U.N. Resident Representative
in Cyprus Gustave Feissel reiterated U.N. and Security Council
concern with the situation in Cyprus and reminded of resolutions
calling for a reduction of troops and a freeze in the military
build-up.
</P>
<P>
Feissel pointed out that "unfortunately until now this has not
been heeded by anybody" and said that if the situation remains as
it is today it has the potential of worsening and creating
tensions.
</P>
<P>
"We are concerned about all kinds of military exercises and
I think it would be much better if none take place because
it would certainly not help in creating the right kind of
climate and reducing tensions," Feissel said.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island in the
wake of a short-lived Greek Cypriot coup seeking union with
Greece.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, November 3 (Xinhua) -- An expert in the Addis
Ababa University today urged for the immediate establishment of
an early warning system for health disasters such as epidemics in
the country.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a training course here, the expert, Derege Kebede,
an associate professor and Chairman of the Department of
Community Health at the university, said although fairly
effective early warning system has been developed for disasters
related to drought and famine, similar shemes for health
disasters have not so far been launched in Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, he said, epidemics are claiming the lives of
millions.
</P>
<P>
He noted that in a move to curb the spread of epidemics, his
department is making utmost efforts to train medical doctors
and public health practitioners in early warning system of health
disasters.
</P>
<P>
In his opening remarks to the training course, delegation head
of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Ethiopia,
Georges Comininos said the fact that the course is taking place
in Ethiopia has a symbolic significance for the country has been
severly affected in its recent history by large scale of health
emergencies.

professional s drawn from 28 countries across the world.

<HEADLINE> Commentary: A New Chapter in China-U.S. Relations (Part One) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang
Zemin left here for home today after winding up his nine-day state
visit to the United States, which took him to seven U.S. cities.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Jiang held talks with U.S. President Bill
Clinton, met with U.S. congressmen and other senior government
officials, and had broad contacts with leaders in U.S. business,
commerce and other sectors.
</P>
<P>
The successful visit has opened a new chapter in
China-U.S. relations. It has achieved its objectives of deepening
understanding, broadening common ground, promoting cooperation and
building a future together.
</P>
<P>
This is the first official visit by a Chinese head of state to
the United States in 12 years and the most important one paid by
Chinese leaders since Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 1979 America tour.
</P>
<P>
This historic visit shows that China-U.S. relations have
entered a new period of development. It is of great practical and
historical significance in promoting world peace and development
and in seeking a peaceful and stable international environment for
our country's modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
Both countries have attached great significance to the visit,
which attracted close attention and won positive comments from the
whole international community.
</P>
<P>
The most important achievement of Jiang's fruitful visit is
that both sides, drawing lessons from the past and setting eyes on
the future, have reached a common understanding on developing
21st century-oriented China-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, the two sides issued a joint statement,
announcing that the two countries will work to build a
constructive strategic partnership geared toward the next
century.
</P>
<P>
They also stressed that the three Sino-U.S. joint communiques
are the basic principles for developing bilateral relations, which
should be viewed and handled from the global and historical
perspectives of strategic importance.
</P>
<P>
The converging points in their common interests should be
sought and differences be resolved on the basis of mutual respect,
consultation on an equal footing and seeking common ground while
reserving differences. This has clearly defined the direction for
a healthy and stable China-U.S. relationship geared toward the
21st century.
</P>
<P>
This visit has enabled both sides to be more aware of their
broad common interests in safeguarding world and regional peace
and stability, promoting the development of global economy,
pushing forward the regional cooperation in the Asia-Pacific and
finding solutions to transnational issues of international concern.
</P>
<P>
They are more aware of the great potential in further
strengthening cooperation in bilateral trade, environment, energy,
and science and technology. All these constitute the strategic
basis of China-U.S. relations in the new situation.
</P>
<P>
In order to establish the constructive strategic partnership
geared toward the 21st century, both sides have decided on
exchanges of visits by presidents of the two countries on a
regular basis, setting up direct communications links between
them, and increasing exchanges of regular visits by officials at
the ministerial level.
</P>
<P>
In addition, they held consultations on energy, environment
protection, economy and trade, peaceful utilization of nuclear
energy, nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction, human
rights, law, relations between the two militaries, education as
well as cultural exchanges. They have reached agreements on
concrete measures and steps of cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Another important achievement of Jiang's visit is the deepening
of mutual understanding between the two peoples through increased
contacts. During his visit, President Jiang attended more than 40
functions and gave more than 30 addresses including a series of
important speeches. He elaborated on China's stand and policies in
developing China-U.S. relations. He briefed the audiences on
China's achievements in its reform and opening up as well as its
modernization drive, and on the fine historical and cultural
traditions of the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
The contacts have helped the American public to learn more
about China from different perspectives, thus giving fresh impetus
to developing bilateral relations, enhancing trust and promoting
cooperation.

<TEXT>
<P>
Jiang's visit helped further expand trade and economic
cooperation between China and the United States.
</P>
<P>
During his nine-day visit, the Chinese president met more than
100 leading U.S. entrepreneurs and businessmen. He toured
high-tech companies including IBM, AT&AMP;T, the Bell Lab. and the
Hughes Electronics Corporation and visited the New York Stock
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
China and the United States signed important documents on
cooperation in energy, environment and the peaceful use of nuclear
technology. In addition, a Chinese trade delegation, arriving in
the United States a few days before Jiang's visit, signed with
U.S. companies contracts worth billions of dollars, which cover
projects in aviation, petrochemical and power industries.
</P>
<P>
Jiang's visit showed that Chinese and U.S. economies are highly
complementary and stand to benefit from the great potentials of
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Noting that they had reached agreement on many major
international and bilateral issues, Jiang and Clinton admitted
frankly that differences remain on issues like human rights and
trade.
</P>
<P>
The development of China-U.S. relations, suffering unexpected
twists and turns, especially after the end of the Cold War, had
undergone a tortuous course. It is impossible for the two sides
to resolve all their differences overnight.
</P>
<P>
The success of Jiang's visit demonstrated that different social
systems, values and cultural traditions should be no barriers to
the development of state-to-state friendly cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Dialogue is always better than confrontation; engagement better
than containment; cooperation better than sanctions and exchanges
better than isolation.
</P>
<P>
To this end, it is of crucial importance to adopt a strategic
perspective, to grasp historic opportunities, to be good at
seeking common interests and to handle differences or
contradictions with a sensible and calm attitude.
</P>
<P>
When visiting the United States in 1979, Deng Xiaoping said the
Pacific Ocean should never be a barrier that separates China and
the United States, but a link that binds the two countries.
</P>
<P>
At the historic moment of the turn of the century, President
Jiang again crossed the Pacific Ocean to strengthen the ties of
friendly cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
To maintain a healthy and stable relationship between China and
the United States is not only in the basic interests of the two
peoples, but also conducive to world peace and development.
</P>
<P>
While making efforts to improve relations with the United
States, China will continue to enhance contacts with other powers
and promote cooperation with developing countries, so as to
contribute to bringing a peaceful, stable and prosperous world
into the 21st century.

ANKARA, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel said today that member countries of the Organization of
the Islamic Conference (OIC) should seek more effective ways
to tap the existing potential for their welfare.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the meeting of the 13th Standing Committee for OIC

that OIC has achieved a considerable experience in the economic

</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the existing position is not satisfactory
regarding the economic and commercial cooperation, saying, "the
trade volume among our countries constitutes only 10 percent of
our general trade. We should increase this average to at least 30
percent."
</P>
<P>
He said that ethnic nationalism, racism, intolerance,
terrorism, organized crimes and some problems related to
under-development has unfortunately affected the Islamic world in
a large scale. But "By solidarity, we can solve these problems
which constitute obstacles in front of a better and fair world, "
he added.

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, November 3 (Xinhua) -- A symposium is being held
here with an aim to orient Ethiopian private consultants and
contractors with the opportunities of the African Development
Bank (ADB).
</P>
<P>
The symposium was organized by ADB in collaboration with the
Ethiopian Ministry of Economic Development and Cooperation on the
understanding that Ethiopian consultants and contractors do not
go to other countries of the continent in search of projects as
their African counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the over 70 participants, director of the
symposium Mohammed Tani said the current trend being followed by
international financial institutions and donors is supporting
development oriented projects.
</P>
<P>
Tani said Africans should catch the attentions of western
financial institutions and donors in their development
undertakings because the later had the belief that no project
undertaken by African could come to fruition.
</P>
<P>
An ADB official said at the symposium that ADB's
strategy in Ethiopia is to help raise the country's productivity,
ameliorate health services and provide basic education in the efforts
underway in the country to alleviate poverty.
</P>
<P>
ADB had allotted nearly 180 million U.S. Dollars for
development projects to be undertaken between 1996 and 1998, he

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The international airport in
Accra, capital of Ghana, is safe and remains open despite the
strike of air traffic controllers, according to the Ghana Civil
Aviation Authority (GCAA).
</P>
<P>
"Senior air traffic controllers and instructors are manning the air
control system pending the amicable settlement of the impasse," GCAA
director-general wing commander Andy Mensah said in a statement
released late Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that flight coordination has already been
established with all adjacent air control centers in west Africa.
</P>
<P>
Air controllers closed the country's airspace Sunday morning for
pay increase and other benefits.
</P>
<P>
They shut down the main control tower in the airport and informed
the airlines that the Accra information region had been closed.
</P>
<P>
The GCAA director-general had to string together a contigent of
control crew called from among senior management personnel, the Ghana
Airways and retired air control staff before he announced the airspace
was open.
</P>
<P>
The strikers have warned that the safety of aircraft could not be
guaranteed as those manning air traffic control were unqualified.
</P>
<P>
The situation, if continued, could affect air traffic within, to
and from Ghana, Togo and Benin because Ghana is the nerve center of
the major air traffic system covering the sub-region.

<HEADLINE> Greek Cypriots Ready to Exchange Information on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot President Glafcos
Clerides has expressed the Greek Cypriot side's willingness to
exchange informations on the location of graves of people from
island's two rival communities listed as missing persons.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed here today by U.N. Resident Representative
Gustave Feissel after a meeting with President Clerides during
which they discussed the latest development on Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Feissel told reporters that "I received a letter from Clerides
saying that he was now ready to exchange that information on his
side."
</P>
<P>
President Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash met
here in July and agreed to provide each other immediately and
simultaneously all informations already at their disposal on the
location of graves of Greek and Turkish Cypriots missing.
</P>
<P>
The exchange of information was scheduled to take place by the
end of last September, as a first step in resolving this humanitarian
issue.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1619 Greek Cypriots were listed as missing persons
soon after the 1974 Turkish invasion, while the Turkish Cypriot
side said there were around 500 Turkish Cypriots missing since
the intercommunal clashes that broke out in 1963.
</P>
<P>
Feissel expressed the hope that the information would be
exchanged very soon.
</P>
<P>
On his meeting with the President, Feissel said they discussed
a proposed visit to the island by the U.N. Secretary-General's
special advisor on Cyprus, Diego Cordovez scheduled for November
18.
</P>
<P>
Kofi Annan wrote to the two sides in Cyprus, as well as the
governments of Greece and Turkey, proposing a visit by Cordovez
to investigate whether they would be willing to participate in
open-ended talks to solve the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Cordovez chaired two rounds of Cyprus peace talks this Summer,
in the U.S. and Switzerland, which reached a deadlock because
Denktash refused to negotiate unless the European Union withholds
its decision for accession talks with Cyprus next Spring.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Zanzibar President Calls for Cooperation in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 3 (xinhua) -- Zanzibar President Salmin
Amour today called on African police forces to join hands in combating
misuse of arms in the continent.
</P>
<P>
He told a five-day African regional workshop on arms regulations
here that co-operation was necessary because arms offenses were often
of transitional nature and no single country could effectively
control them.
</P>
<P>
Amour cited examples of misuse of arms as armed robberies and
plane hijackings, most of which result in loss of lives and
destruction of property.
</P>
<P>
He said there was urgent need for controlling the supply of
arms and checking their misuse to ensure that peace and security
was not threatened in the region.
</P>
<P>
"I hope during your deliberations you will come up with strong and
clear resolutions on what should be done to check the widespread
misuse of arms," he said.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian Inspector General of Police, Omar Mahita, told
the 53 delegates that although there were elaborate laws governing the
importation and use of civilian arms, some people still smuggled arms
into their countries, threatening peace and security.
</P>
<P>
Mahita called for international co-operation through devising
common strategies on fighting the smugglers who often beat the
law enforcers.
</P>
<P>
An official from the United Nations Office in Vienna, Slowomir
Redo, underscored the importance of regular communication among
the African countries as a strategy in fighting the misuse.
</P>
<P>
He said the experience and knowledge from the workshop would assist
all UN member states in effectively fighting the problem which is a
menace to peace and stability in the world.
</P>
<P>
The workshop, sponsored by the UN Crime Prevention and Criminal
Justice Division in Vienna, draws participation of senior police
officers from the whole Africa.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Sanctions Against Iran Come to Failure: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Iranian Foreign
Minister Kamal Kharrazi today described the United States' sanctions
against Iran as "a total failure", noting superpowers were no longer
able to impose their will on the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi said that his country enjoyed good relations with many
countries around the world, and was in most respects self-sufficient.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, I would like to declare that the Amercian sanctions and
pressures on Iran have not been effective, and have been total
failure," he told reporters after meeting his South African
counterpart Alfred Nzo in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
"The only thing that happened was that the Amercian companies were
deprived of a lucrative market."
</P>
<P>
The U.S., which accused Iran of sponsoring international terrorism,
imposed a unilateral economic embargo on Iran in June 1995, and has
sought to persuade other major powers to end their military and
nuclear cooperation with the country.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the U.S. had since the 1979 Islamic revolution been vying
to isolate Iran, Kharrazi said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, this campaign was faltering because the U.S. was
acting mostly on its own. Even some of its allies, such as the
European Union, was not supporting the economic embargo.
</P>
<P>
"This proves that the world has changed," Kharrazi said, "I believe
the time that one or two powers can dictate policies against other
countries has passed."
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi said that different groupings and different central powers
have emerged since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. "All the
groupings, like the European Union, the Organization of African Unity
and the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) have the right to claim a greater
share in the administration of the world," he noted.
</P>
<P>
One could expect them to play a more important role through the
United Nations in the way the world was being run, he said.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi said his talks with Nzo earlier in the day also focused on
the role developing countries could play in international relations
within the framework of the NAM.
</P>
<P>
Iran was ready to support South Africa in this mission when it
assumed the chairmanship on NAM next year, Kharrazi added.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Searching for Phosphate Fertilizer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Zambia will investigate
into mine dump waste throughout the country in a bid to find out
whether the waste contain any minerals which can be utilized for
agricultural purposes, Mine and Minerals Development Minister Christon
Tembo said here today.
</P>
<P>
Opening an international conference on phosphate resources and
food security in Africa, Christon Tembo said that in order to increase food
production on the African continent there is need for the improvement
of soil fertility and sustainable agricultural practice.
</P>
<P>
He said many African countries especially those in sub-Saharan
Africa suffer from phosphorus deficiency which is one of the
contributing factors to the decline in food production.
</P>
<P>
While Africa has numerous mineral deposits scattered throughout the
continent which remain unexploited, he said.
</P>
<P>
Fertilizer imports on the continent are a great drain of the
scarce foreign exchange despite boasting of many phosphate deposits in
the region, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
He said the problem of low quality deposits can be overcomed by
producing cheaper forms of phosphate fertilizers in which a portion of
the phosphate content is converted to water soluble and can be used
immediately by plants.
</P>
<P>
The utilization of this important plant nutrient could have a
positive impact on food and crop production in Africa because the
benefit could lead to economical empowerment of farmers, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the same occasion, acting United Nations Development Program
(UNDP) resident representative, Omoefe Oyaide, said UNDP is keen to
explore every opportunity to enhance the development of the economy
particularly the rural sector which is dominated by a large number of
small-scale farmers.
</P>
<P>
He said 40 percent of UNDP support in the next five years will go
to developing agriculture, rural development and food security.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Official: Mistrust Mars Talks with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian chief delegate to the
Arab League (AL) Mohamad Sobeih said here today that the peace
talks with Israel in Washington is marred by "much caution and
many doubts."
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Middle East News Agency, he said that
the Palestinian side continues to feel bitter about previous
experience with Israel as PLO chief delegate Mahmoud Abbas and
Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy is having talks today in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
"This round of talks was delayed to give Israeli Foreign
Minister David Levy authorization from Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu and the Israeli mini-Cabinet in order to avoid
a setback in the talks as was the case on previous occasions,"
Sobeih said.
</P>
<P>
During previous talks, Levy displayed "ill-fitting optimism"
and failed to carry out promises he made at the previous round of
talks in the U.S. capital, Sobeih added.
</P>
<P>
"Every time the Israeli side makes a step ahead, it follows up
with ten steps backwards," he said.
</P>
<P>
The current round of talks must reach agreement on such key
issues as halting settlement building, starting redeployment,
addressing both sides' security and deciding on the final status
negotiations, Sobeih further noted.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian official called upon the U.S. to apply one
standard in dealing with the Mideast peace process and genuinely
seek to realize peace in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Arab League (AL) today welcomed the
Palestinian-Israeli peace talks in Washington and the U.S. efforts
in this regard, the Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
AL Assistant Secretary General Ambassador Ahmad Bin Heli
underlined the necessity of making tangible progress in halting
the Israeli settlement building and implementing the articles of
the transitional phase, particularly the redeployment in the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-backed meeting, the second round of high-level talks
between the Israelis and Palestinians after seven months of
standoff, was postponed from October 27 until today.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have been at odds over Netanyahu's proposal to
move straight into accelerated "final status" talks that will
tackle more difficult issues like the future of settlements and
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians demand that Israel first implement
long-delayed withdrawal of Israeli troops in most rural areas of
the West Bank and agree on a freeze in settlement activities.

<HEADLINE> Reduction of Zimbabwe's National Debt Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 3 (Xinhua) --The Zimbabwean government has
been urged to make great efforts to reduce national debts,
currently estimated at four billion U.S Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a finance students seminar, dean of
commerce in Zimbabwe's National University of Science and
Technology, Elton Razemba, warned developing nations against
external borrowings, saying this had disadvantages in that
foreign commercial banks lent at very high interest rates which
also included service charges and management fees.
</P>
<P>
''Internal borrowing is not as burdensome as external
borrowing which demands that repayments of the original loan
interest and surcharges have to be paid in foreign currency which
is difficult to procure," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said with internal borrowing, the money would be
circulating among "members of the same family". But, he said,
government borrowings crowded out private sector enterprises,
starving them of funds for investment.
</P>
<P>
Razemba said that it is necesary for the country to keep the
budget deficit around five percent of the Gross Domestic Product
instead of the 10 to 15 percent haunting the nation.

<HEADLINE> Regional Anti-Mines Symposium Opens in Yemen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

SANAA, November 3 (Xinhua) -- A regional symposium on promoting
governmental efforts against land mines opened here today with the
participation of 23 Arab countries and a number of international
and non-governmental anti-mines organizations.
</P>
<P>
The two-day symposium was organized by the Swedish Child
Welfare Organization and the Yemeni Committee on Promotion of

<HEADLINE> UK Government Reluctant to Interfere in Nanny Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Labor government has
refused to exert diplomatic pressure on the U.S. government on
behalf of the convicted British au pair Louise Woodward, but
saying it followed the developments closely.
</P>
<P>
Andrew Miller, a MP representing Woodward's constituency, early
today discussed with British Foreign Office minister Liz Symons
the case of Woodward, who was found guilty last week in Cambridge,
Massachusetts, of the second degree murder of eight-month-old
Matthew Eappen and was given a mandatory life sentence.
</P>
<P>
The sentence has provoked wide-spread angry reaction across
Britain over the past few days and a fund was established to mount
an appeal campaign.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after meeting with Symons, Miller said: "The
government obviously cannot and should not seek to interfere in
the judicial system of a well-developed democracy."
</P>
<P>
"But it is important that ministers are aware of what has gone
on so that if the case goes to appeal, pressure is brought through
diplomatic channels to ensure that the appeal is held early."
</P>
<P>
Symons said in a statement issued after the meeting that the
London government was "closely following all developments in the
case". But she gave no indication that any action would be made.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an aide to Prime Minister Tony Blair was reported as
saying: "We are watching it in exactly the same way as everyone
else is."
</P>
<P>
"But it would not be appropriate for the prime minister to take
a view on the verdict," the aide said.

<HEADLINE> Supreme Court Rejects Challenge to California's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Supreme Court
Monday rejected a challenge to California's Proposition 209, which
bans affirmative action -- a formal effort to provide increased
employment and education opportunities for ethnic minorities and
women -- by any level of state or city government.
</P>
<P>
A coalition of civil rights groups had asked the justices to
hear argument on the challenge this term, but the Supreme Court
denied the request Monday without comment.
</P>
<P>
Lawyers following the case anticipate the rejection might open
the floodgates to similar measures across the country, at least on
the county or municipal level. About 26 jurisdictions are
reportedly poised to enact a similar law.
</P>
<P>
California voters passed Proposition 209 -- the California
Civil Rights Initiative -- in November 1996 by 54 to 46 percent.
</P>
<P>
Proposition 209 says the state "shall not discriminate against,
or grant preferential treatment to, any individual or group on the
basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity or national origin in the
operation of public employment, public education or public
contracting."
</P>
<P>
Earlier the coalition challenged the law, and a federal judge
in San Francisco issued a preliminary injunction against its
implementation, ruling that the state law conflicted with federal
civil rights laws.
</P>
<P>
But a federal appeals court panel threw out the injunction, and
refused to block the effects while the challengers took their case
to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court last month refused to suspend Proposition
209, but left open the question of whether it would hear argument
in the case until today.

UNITED NATIONS, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The Secretary-General of
the United Nations was going to send a three-man mission to Iraq
late today, U.N. sources said.
</P>
<P>
In today's briefing, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said the
three U.N. envoys were expected to arrive in Iraq late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The mission comprises of former Algerian foreign minister Lakhdar
Brahimi, former Argentine U.N. representative Emilio Cardenas and
Jan Eliasson of Sweden, a former U.N. ambassador.
</P>
<P>
Brahimi was now in New York waiting for Cardenas to Join him
from Buenos Aires for a flight late today to Geneva where they
would be joined by Eliasson, and they would then travel to Iraq on
Tuesday, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi Government on October 29 announced its decision on
banning Americans taking part in UN weapons inspections which is
widely seen as a response by Iraq to a resolution adopted by the
U.N. Security Council last month threatening a ban on travel abroad
by Iraqi officials who interfered with the work of
U.N. inspections.

The U.N. chief announced to send his personal envoys to Iraq to

<HEADLINE> Iran Echoes German Proposal for Fence-mending Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi said today that Tehran welcomes Bonn's proposal of
holding talks to mend relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
According to the official news agency IRNA, Kharrazi made the
remark in Pretoria, South Africa, in a response to a suggestion of
German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel.
</P>
<P>
IRNA's report did not mention when and how Kinkel raised the
proposal. However, an Iranian source here told Xinhua that
Kharrazi today received a message from his German counterpart.
</P>
<P>
"Kinkel's request will not go unanswered," Kharrazi said, "Iran
welcomes Kinkel's interest in conducting talks that would
facilitate the mending of ties between Iran and Germany for the
normalization of relations."
</P>
<P>
He said that Iran would closely scrutinize such proposals,
specifically those from friendly countries, which also assure
Iran's stand on the return of European ambassadors to Tehran.
</P>
<P>
The 15 member states of the European Union (EU) withdrew their
ambassadors from Tehran in protest after a Berlin court charged
that Iranian leadership were involved in a political
assassinations in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Iran later announced that the EU ambassadors could return to
Tehran but the German envoy must be the last to do so, a formula
seen by Bonn as an attempt to undermine the EU's solidarity.
</P>
<P>

shape in matters of relations between Germany and Iran has hurt
the public feelings of Iranians and that the matter needs to be
somehow and somewhat compensated."

<HEADLINE> Israeli Lawmakers Against Croatian President's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The planned visit to Israel
by Croatian President Franjo Tudjman is creating a political
storm in Israel as some Israeli lawmakers are against the trip for
the alleged anti-Semitic attitude of Tudjman.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Foreign Ministry has said that Tudjman planned to
visit Israel next month to realize his promise made in August,
when the two countries established diplomatic ties.
</P>
<P>
Tudjman said that he wanted to visit the Jewish state to
apologize personally for crimes committed by some of his people
during the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
But some Israeli lawmakers were upset about Tudjman's planned
visit because of what was called his anti-Semitic views.
Lawmakers Yossi Beilin and Yossi Sarid, of the opposition Labor
party and Meretz party, filed on Sunday urgent motions to the
Knesset (Parliament) agenda to protest against Tudjman's visit.
</P>
<P>
Meretz leader Sarid called Tudjman as an "anti-Semite" who has
denied the Holocaut, adding the president should be considered a
persona non grata in Israel. "If Tudjman does come, he will
encounter stormy protests. Many will be unable to come to terms
with his provocative and painful presence here," he said.
</P>
<P>
Beilin said it would be a mistake to allow Tudjman to
visit. "He never took back his serious published statements that
the Holocaust is a Jewish invention and his willingness to
apologize for his people's crimes does not cover up for his
own," he said.
</P>
<P>
Tudjman has long been accused by Israel of making antisemitic
slurs in his writings. Israeli historian Jennie Lebel, who
specializes in Yugoslavian history, charged Tudjman for having
naming public places after leaders of the fascist former Zagreb's
wartime regime which outdid the Nazi SS in massacrering Yugoslavia's
Jews.
</P>
<P>
She also noted that Tudjman, in one of his books, expressed
clearly his antisemitic views. Tudjman was quoted as having said,
"thank God that my wife is neither Serbian nor Jewish."
</P>
<P>
Due to the protests over Tudjman's visit, Israeli President
Ezer Weizman has not decided whether to receive Tudjman, the
Presidential Office said in a statement Sunday night. Visiting
presidents and monarchs are generally guests of the president in
coordination with the Foreign Ministry.

<HEADLINE> UK Economists Warn of Further Market Chaos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of England could
trigger another bout of turmoil in the London stock market if it
raises interest rates this week, leading economists here have
warned.
</P>
<P>
Alan Walters, Lady Thatcher's former economic adviser, and
Professor Patrick Minford from Cardiff Business School urged the
bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) to keep base rates
unchanged at 7 percent when it meets Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Many City economists expect the bank to raise rates by 0.25
percent, in order to avoid breaching the upper limit of 3.5
percent in the government's inflation target in the future.
</P>
<P>
Some of them even believe that only a new share price collapse
in the next few days might deter the MPC from raising interest
rates 0.25 percent to 7.25 percent this week.
</P>
<P>
"The decision is touch and go at the moment," according to
Barclays economist director Chris Wright.
</P>
<P>
If the committee decides to delay the increase, Wright believes
that it will require a massive fall in share prices to prevent
rates from rising to 7.5 percent before the spring.
</P>
<P>
Looking ahead to this week's MPC meeting, Wright said, "The
committee may want to wait (and) see whether October's retail
spending has recovered from September's downturn."
</P>
<P>
"But the bank will be worried about the labor market conditions
which sees average earnings growing at 4.5 percent -- it is the
maximum compatible with achieving the 2.5 percent inflation
tartet," he added.
</P>
<P>
Professor Minford said he did not believe the bank would risk
further market turbulence by raising rates.
</P>
<P>
"After the stock market drop you've got the risk of overkill.
Exchange rates are also high that a rise in interest rates could
trigger further falls in share prices," he argued.
</P>
<P>
The FTSE 100 index ended last week 127.9 points lower at
5330.8, having recovered some of its lost ground after a 458 point
plunge at one stage Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
However, the index is still comfortably ahead of the 4057 level
of the start of the year.
</P>
<P>
Andrew Cates, economist at UBS, noted that although the recent
stock market turbulence will probably not depress domestic demand
much, "an interest rate rise under the current circumstances is
most unlikely."

<HEADLINE> Mozambique Okays Compulsory Military Service Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The Mozambican Parliament today
passed, with the only favorate vote from the ruling party
parliamentary members, a draft law to resume the the compulsory
Military service system.
</P>
<P>
The compulsory military service law, abandoned in the country
in 1992 in accordance with the peace agreement, got green light with
124 for, 103 against and eight abstentions at the parliament
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Men aging from 18 to 35 are obligated to serve in the army
according to the draft law.
</P>
<P>
The law, favored by the ruling Liberation Front of Mozambique
(Frelimo) which took the majority in number at the
parliament, met objection from the National Resistance of
Mozambique (Renamo), the major opposition party in the country and
the Democratic Union, the third biggest party in the country.
</P>
<P>
All the Renamo members left the meeting after they voted
against such move forwarded by the ruling party.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Union members abstained from voting for the
law.
</P>
<P>
Sergio Viera, representative of the ruling Frelimo said after
the law was passed, that it is the responsibility of every
Mozambican to safeguard his country.
</P>
<P>
But the Renamo said in a communique against the law that the fate
of Mozambican men below the age of 35 would have to be at the
hands of the ruling party, with university students suffering
the most.
</P>
<P>
Raul Domingos, Renamo leader said at the opening of the
parliamentary meeting that there should have been a national
referendum for such a move which has impact on the whole
nation.
</P>
<P>
According to the peace agreement, the country could have a
30,000-strong army, but there are only 11,000 army men in the
country as the government finds it difficult to recruit
soldiers. Endite

<HEADLINE> Tietmeyer Rules Out Early Coordination of European Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Bundesbank President Hans
Tietmeyer today ruled out early coordination of European interest
rates in the run-up to the 1999 start-up of the single European
currency, the euro.
</P>
<P>
The level of European interest rates depended on both economic
data and the states selected to join the euro, said the head of
German central bank while addressing a meeting of tax advisers in
the German city of Aashen.
</P>
<P>
European leaders are scheduled to meet in May next year to
decide which countries qualify for membership of the euro.
</P>
<P>
Tietmeyer insisted in his speech that Bundesbank's decision
last month to raise its key money market rate, the repo, from 3 to
3.3 percent, was made to guard against inflation prior to the
launch of the euro.
</P>
<P>
Analysts had viewed the rise as representing the first step
towards concerting European interest rates ahead of the euro.
Considering the huge gaps between rates in various countries, they
had expected the Bundesbank to continue edging up its rates next
year in preparation for bigger move to harmonize European rates.
</P>
<P>
They had believed that the repo rate would rise again by the
end of this year and would reach 4 percent by around the middle of
1998.
</P>
<P>
Holger Fahringkrug, economist with the Union Bank of
Switzerland in Frankfurt, noted that Tietmeyer's remarks did not
necessarily exclude a rate rise based on domestic factors, such as
inflation and the M3 money supply.

<HEADLINE> Israelis, Palestinians Meet Albright for Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators today met with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright at the start of a new round of negotiations in an attempt
to pull the peace process in the Middle East back on track.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy and Palestinian negotiator
Mahmoud Abbas will hold their talks in a Virginia suburb of
Washington after their meeting with Albright.
</P>
<P>
Lavy told reporters at the meeting with Albright at the State
Department that he intended to "find ways to resolve problems in
order to make progress."
</P>
<P>
But Abbas made no comment.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Palestinian peace talks have been at a virtual
standstill since March when the Israeli government decided to
build Jewish housing units in East Jerusalem where usually live
Arabs.
</P>
<P>
The United States said this week's talks have a four-point
agenda: Israeli-Palestinian security cooperation, further
withdrawal of Israeli troops from the West Bank, a possible
"time-out" on Jewish settlements, and ways of moving to
negotiations on the final status of Palestinian areas.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Urges Cooperation to Fight Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 3 (Xinhua) -- South Africa today urged
Southern African countries to join hands in the fight against poverty,
South African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
There was an urgent need for Southern African states to work
together to fight poverty, Deputy Minister in the Deputy President's
Office, Essop Pahad, told a U.N. forum.
</P>
<P>
The fight against poverty in Southern Africa would only be won
through the cooperation of governments and other stakeholders, Pahad
said at the U.N. Forum on Poverty Eradication in Midrand, a town lies
midway between Johannesburg and Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
He said South Africa is committed to all UN programs aimed at
addressing the problem.
</P>
<P>
"We acknowledge all U.N. programs on poverty, including a declaration
on poverty to run from 1997 to 2007," Pahad said.
</P>
<P>
South African-based U.N. Information Center director Yobert
Shamapande said he believed democracy and democratic institutions
would not take root or endure in an environment where the vast
majority of people were overwhelmed by abject poverty without access
to basic human needs.
</P>
<P>
"Democracy and democratic institutions will certainly be under
threat in an environment of continuous conflicts, social exclusions
and neglect which has characterized the region over the past decade,"
Shamapande said.
</P>
<P>
The objectives of the three-day forum are to follow up and promote
concrete action on recitations and decisions made at UN international
conferences, especially the World Social Summit held in Copenhagen,
Denmark, aimed at eradicating poverty, creating employment
opportunities and enhancing social integration.
</P>
<P>
There was general agreement that real peace in Southern Africa
would only be achieved by tackling the remaining threats stemming from
widespread conditions of poverty, hunger, lack of housing, basic
education and primary health care, all of which precipitated social
disintegration.
</P>
<P>
In South Africa, the wealthiest country in the region, about 45.7
percent of the population lived in poverty, 98 percent of whom are
blacks, according to a survey conducted in mid-October.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Army Chief: Maneuvers Not to Turn to War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, November 3 (Xinhua) -- A Turkish military leader denied
here this evening that the two military maneuvers staged by the
Turkish Armed Forces in and near northern Cyprus would turn to war
with Greeks and Greek Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Chief of General Staff Ismail Hakki Karaday
said, "It is unnecessary to talk about war. It's impossible that
the maneuvers will turn to war."
</P>
<P>
Turkey started a military exercise, code-named Determination
'97, on Saturday and started another one, code-named Toros 2/97,
today in the Mediterranean Sea.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish war games were apparently in response to the
three-day joint Greek and Greek Cypriots' military exercises in
the Greek Cypriot-controlled area on October 10-13.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Turkey and Greece have been worsening
since the Cypriot government announced that it would not give up
the controversial plan to buy 150-kilometer-range anti-aircraft
S-300 missiles from Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Turkish President Suleyman Demirel said today in Istanbul
that the existing problems between Turkey and Greece are "so
sensitive that both countries should deal with them calmly."
</P>
<P>
He said: "In Madrid, we signed a declaration together with
Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis. In that declaration, it was
said that 'let's solve the problems between the two countries by
peaceful ways'. Of course, these problems are so
sensitive. However, the peaceful way to solution is still open."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Turkish Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister
Ismet Sezgin left Turkey today for northern Cyprus to watch the
two continuing maneuvers in and near Cyprus, showing that Turkey
has attached great importance to the military exercises.
</P>
<P>
Sezgin said Sunday that the Turkish government was staging
military exercises in and near Cyprus, not a war, adding: "there
will be a clash in the Aegean if Greece wants it."
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Ministry deputy spokesman Sermet Atacanli told
reporters "We hope there will not be any hot clashes" during
the military exercises staged by Turkey and Greece.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Greece, both members of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO), have experienced increased tension because
of their frequent exercises in the Aegean and the Cyprus'
missile plan.
</P>
<P>
The tension between the two NATO members has caused grave
concern among Balkan countries, which urge the two neighbors to
exercise restraint.
</P>
<P>
Ankara and Athens have long been at odds over a number of
issues, including airspace division, mineral resources under the
Aegean and the Cyprus problem.

<HEADLINE> Prosecutors Launch Case Against Accused Oklahoma </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. federal prosecutors
today started producing evidence in the murder and conspiracy
trial of Terry Nichols in Denver, Colorado, saying he was
responsible for the Oklahoma City bombing even though he was far
away from the scene when it happened.
</P>
<P>
Nichols, the accused accomplice of convicted bomber Timothy
McVeigh, was home in Herington, Kansas, when the truck bomb
exploded on April 19, 1995, but he helped buy and hide the bomb's
ingredients, stole money to fund the plot and stashed McVeigh's
getaway car, prosecutor Larry Mackey said in his opening
statement.
</P>
<P>
The explosion killed 168 people, including 19 children, and
injured more than 500 others.
</P>
<P>
"During the months before that day, Terry Nichols had been side
by side with Tim McVeigh, together in their plan of violence,"
reports quoted Mackey as telling the jury.
</P>
<P>
Nichols, 42, faces the same 11 conspiracy and murder charges as
his Army buddy McVeigh, who was convicted on June 2 and sentenced
to death 11 days later.
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Michael Tigar, whose opening statement began
after that of the prosecutor, was expected to argue that Nichols
was not part of McVeigh's bombing plan and to stress Nichols'
alibi on the morning of the blast.
</P>
<P>
But the prosecutor revealed that Nichols' image was captured
months before by a security camera in a coin shop in Wichita,
Kansas.
</P>
<P>
The photographs link Nichols to phone calls made immediately
afterward from a phone booth across the street to vendors of
barrels like those used in the massive truck bomb, Mackey said.
</P>
<P>
Mackey also said the government has significant physical
evidence connecting Nichols to the bombing, including blasting
cord and caps, a drill bit used in a robbery to steal supplies and
guns stolen to raise money for the scheme.
</P>
<P>
McVeigh was arrested on the day of the bombing, driving away
from Oklahoma City.
</P>
<P>
Nichols turned himself in to police two days later after
hearing his name on the radio in connection with the bombing.
McVeigh had used the address of Nichols' brother James on a motel
registration card, prompting an FBI raid on the family's remote
farm in Decker, Michigan.

<P>
Meanwhile, he also indicated that the Chinese government has
attached great importance to ecological problems that may possibly
crop up during the construction of the project.
</P>
<P>
The Yangtze valley, particularly at its middle and lower
reaches, cited as the cream of the Chinese economy, is also a
region that has frequented by floods and other natural disasters.
In this century alone, three catastrophic floods occurred in the
1930s and 1950s took a toll of more than 300,000 lives and caused
tremeous economic losses.
</P>
<P>
The anti-flood effort of the project has so far provided an
ecological shield for this economically developed region, the
Jingjiang River valley in partucular, Lu noted.
</P>
<P>
This region, with a population of 15 million with 1.53 million
hectares of farmland, now can cope with a catastrophic flood of a
ten-year frequency.
</P>
<P>
Upon completion of the project, Jingjiang river region will be
able to combat flood that may occur once every 100 years.
</P>
<P>
Energy shortage is a big hindrance to the sustained growth of
the Chinese economy on the long run. China's energy consumption
after 1990 registered an annual growth of 4 percent and there is
an accelerated trend," Lu added. The coal-burning-dominant energy
structure, however, could worsen such eco-problems.
</P>
<P>
This world's largest hydro-power station is designed to ease the
energy shortage and improve the eco-environment.
</P>
<P>
Experts estimated that in comparison with thermal power plants
of the same generation capacity, the Three Gorges Project, with an
installed generation capacity of 18.2 megawatts, can save 50
million tons of raw coal and cut 100 million tons of carbon
dioxide, and reduce large amounts of dust, sewage and
discarded residue.
</P>
<P>
People are also concerned with fact that the slower waterflow
in the future reservoir may weaken the Yangtze's self-cleaning
capability in discharging and washing off the toxic contents
poured by shoreside industries.
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview with a famous Chinese writer, Gan Yuping,
vice-mayor of Chongqing Municipality, said that the Three Gorges
project will not be turned into a cesspool.

Gan listed several figures to elaborate his point. Annual
runoff stands around 451 billion c.m. in the area of the future
reservoir area, whose storage capacity is projected to reach 39.3
billion c.m. "The water in the reservoir can be changed about ten
times a year," he said. Currently, some one billion tons of
liquid sewage is discharged into the Yangtze, one one four hundredth
of the annual runoff.
</P>
<P>
As part of the effort to speed up sewage treatment, more than
20 water disposal plants will be built on the upper reaches of the
Yangtze, and Chongqing alone will build five such factories, Gan
noted.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, a number of small enterprises, including small
paper mills, will be closed. Upon hearing the news, Tan Dexun, a
farmer who has been living in a village by the Yangtze for more
than 70 years, said: "This will surely help improve our living
environment."
</P>
<P>
A Chinese environmental official said, "We promise that no
industrial waste and sewage will be released into the Yangtze
without undergoing treatment upon completion of the project."
</P>
<P>
Xie Zhenhua, director of the China State Environment Protection
Agency, said the Chinese government has founded an
ecological-protection organ pertaining to the Three Gorges
Project, with 13 eco-supervisory networks on relocation of people,
hydrology, hydrography and other fields, and conducted a an
all-round ecological survey mainly at the dam site and the source
of the Yangtze.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Chinese government also launched a
diversified biological protection program in the Three Gorges
area.
</P>
<P>
The state has planned to set up three animal reserves and 12
fish-egg hatching grounds, and rare fish species in the upper
reaches, rare aquatics in the middle reaches and Chinese
alligators in the lower reach will be protected properly.
</P>
<P>
The Three Gorges region is also a place where rare plant
species grown in profusion. Botanists have designated Dalaoling
Mountain in Yichang, Jiugong Mountain and Wuhan Botanical Garden
as the new "homes" of the rare plants.
</P>
<P>
According to a researcher with Wuhan Botanical Institute under
the Chinese Academy of Sciences, some 80 percent of the
transplanted species have acclimatized to the new environment. And
certain species will return to the reservoir area after the
completion of the project. "All species survived from the glacier
of the Quaternary Period will not disappear for the construction
of the Three Gorges," the research said.

<P>
TOKYO, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto said today that the resolution of the country's
territorial row with Russia should precede the conclusion of a
peace treaty between the two countries, Kyodo News reported.
</P>
<P>
That's why the two countries mentioned in their latest
agreement, the 1993 Tokyo Declaration, the early conclusion of a
peace treaty through resolving the territorial dispute, Hashimoto
told reporters in the Diet (parliament) building.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese prime minister made the remark while referring to
Russian reports that a peace treaty and the territorial dispute
were separate issues.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto and Russian President Boris Yeltsin agreed in their
first informal summit last weekend in Krasnoyarsk, eastern
Siberia, to make their utmost efforts to sign a peace treaty by
2000 on the basis of the 1993 Tokyo Declaration.
</P>
<P>
In the declaration, Japan and Russia agreed to work to
normalize their diplomatic relations by resolving the dispute on
the basis of "the principles of law and justice."
</P>
<P>
The territorial dispute over the Russian-held islands --
Etorofu, Kunashiri, Shikotan and the Habomai group of islets --
has prevented the two countries from signing a peace treaty for
more than five decades.

</P>
<P>
Both Han Zhaokang, chief representative of the Chinese side of
the Sino-Portuguese JLG, and his Portuguese counterpart, Antonio

civil service, the localization of law and the use of Chinese as
an official language when they finished the first-day meeting of

</P>
<P>
at today's meeting, the Portuguese side briefed the Chinese

side, in return, urged the Portuguese side to take further
concrete measures to step up the process.
</P>
<P>
"The related work should be stepped up and concrete measures
should be taken in the localization of civil service, especially,
the middle and senior ranking posts," Han said. "There should come
a major progress and a breakthrough as there is only a little more
than two years left before the handover in 1999."
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Chinese ambassador said that the use of
Chinese as an official language should be implemented at a full

Carlos said that the Portuguese side is very concerned with the
localization of the civil service as it is of vital importance for
a smooth transition. He said the Macao Government has made great
efforts.

Carlos also expressed his hope that the speed in reviewing laws
would be quickened as there are still a great amount of laws
remaining to be examined and localized.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Asks for Stopping US Spy Plane Flight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Iraq again asked the United
Nations Special Committee (UNSCOM) on dismantling Iraq's weapons
of mass destruction to prevent an U.S. say plane from hovering in
its airspace.
</P>
<P>
According to the Iraqi News Agency, the Iraqi government said
the U-2 surveillance plane was spying on Iraq for the U.S. and was
not working for the UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
This request came in a message handed over by Nazar Hamdoun,
Iraq's permanent representative to the U.N., to Richard Butler,
head of the UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
The message voiced Iraq's willingness to hammer out, in
collaboration with the UNSCOM, a U.N. Security Council-approved
formula for the committee using such type of planes in Iraqi
airspace.
</P>
<P>
Iraq had last month suggested substituting the U.S. plane
operating in Iraqi airspace with an Iraqi plane to be put at the
disposal of the UNSCOM, or using an alternative plane from a
neutral country.
</P>
<P>
The message made it clear that, in the light of the present
developments, the U.S. is expected to launch a military attack
against Iraq, so it is unacceptable for an American spy plane to
get into Iraqi airspace.
</P>
<P>
The message held Butler responsible for the consequences if he
decides to authorize the U.S. plane to go ahead with its mission.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi officials today refused to allow U.S. personnel to take
part in a U.N. inspection of a suspected missile storage site in
Baghdad for a second day. The U.N. team then canceled the
inspection.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has ordered all U.S. weapon inspectors working with the
UNSCOM to leave Iraq by Wednesday, accusing them of espionage.

<P>
KUWAIT CITY, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The fifth Gulf Cooperation
Council (GCC) petrochemicals and fertilizers conference opened
here today aimed at promoting cooperation among the GCC states in
this sector.
</P>
<P>
The two-day conference jointly sponsored by the GCC
Secretariat, the Kuwait Petrochemical Industries Company and a

Emirates to play South Korea at the same time on Sunday. That
means that Japan has to change the game schedule from Saturday to
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The FIFA's move was to make sure that neither side had the
advantage of knowing the result of the other.
</P>
<P>
But Japan complained that the stadium would be used for an
athletics meeting on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Football Association (JFA) general secretary Junji
Ogura had planned to fly to Zurich in a bid to let FIFA stick to
the original time.
</P>
<P>
FIFA bowed to the pressure and Japan now will go ahead with its
match on Saturday -- 24 hours before the Emirates play South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Japan and the Emirates are in contention for second place in
the group, which would put them in a play-off for a World Cup
place. South Korea have already qualified for next year's finals.
</P>
<P>
Japan moved to second in the group by beating South Korea 2-0
last weekend when the UAE were held 0-0 by Uzbekistan.
</P>
<P>
South Korea and Japan will co-host the 2002 World Cup finals
and Japan is desperate to avoid becoming the only nation to host
the event without ever having played in a World Cup final.

<HEADLINE> Top Disciplinary Official Sets Anti-Corruption Targets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, November 4 (Xinhua) -- China's anti-corruption
campaign will focus on banning gifts at meetings and conferences,
and the use of public funds to install home telephones or to buy
mobile phones, a senior official said.
</P>
<P>
Wei Jianxing, secretary of the Central Commission for
Discipline Inspection, said during a recent tour of east China's
Zhejiang Province that the ban should be the central task for
disciplinary departments at all levels in the next six months.
</P>
<P>
"Meanwhile, we should settle a group of serious corruption
cases in the shortest possible time as part of our effort to carry
out the guidelines of the 15th National Party Congress," said Wei
who is also a member of the Standing Committee of the Chinese
Communist Party Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
He called for building up a "legal front-line for fighting
corruption within the Party," so that "there will be no hiding
places for graft."
</P>
<P>
Education should be stressed at the same time as prevention.
"We need a moral front-line as well," he said.
</P>
<P>
Wei urged enhanced supervision, especially to check on leading
officials. At the grass-roots level, he said, a democratic
supervision process should be put in place, which should promote
an open system of administration and budget management.
</P>
<P>
Deepening the political restructuring, institutions and
administration should also be put on the agenda to rid the soil
that helps breed corruption, Wei said.

<HEADLINE> Time Not Ripe for Afghan Peace, says Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Afghanistan can hardly make
substantial progress in its peace-finding process unless the
conditions are ripe, a United Nations special envoy said Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Internal and the external factors were not ready for peace in
the country," Norbert Holl said in an exclusive interview with
Xinhua, at the U.N. Special Mission for Afghanistan (UNSMA), here.
</P>
<P>
Holl said there is not "sufficient sense of compromise among
all Afghan parties." Secondly, parties with influence "had yet to
seriously discuss with the U.N. mission how to get out of the
Afghanistan dilemma," he said.
</P>
<P>
The German diplomat, who was appointed the UNSMA head in July
last year and resigned recently, said: "I have a little difficulty
to accept that the U.N. has failed."
</P>
<P>
Holl said: "The only thing the U.N. is trying here is to give a
helping hand to the Afghans in finding peace."
</P>
<P>
"It is up to the Afghans and only to the Afghans to find a way
to peace. If someone has failed to find peace, it is first of all
the Afghans."
</P>
<P>
"It is not failure. It is the lack of appropriate political
instruments which caused the developments of the past five years,"
Holl added.

<HEADLINE> Six Cities Cited For Environmental Achievements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Six port cities were commended
today for their outstanding achievements in coordinating rapid
economic growth and environmental improvements.
</P>
<P>
The cities -- Zhangjiagang, Dalian, Shenzhen, Xiamen, Weihai
and Zhuhai -- were among the first group chosen for the "Model
City in Environmental Protection" award.
</P>
<P>
The award is the country's highest honor in the environmental
field. The cities receiving this recognition must have a clean
environment while fomenting rapid social and economic growth.
</P>
<P>
State Councillor Song Jian said at today's ceremony that
achieving sustainable development in the urban areas is an
important goal in China's pollution control work.
</P>
<P>
Chinese cities have proved that they can coordinate economic
growth with environmental improvement, he said.
</P>
<P>
Wang Bingqian, vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress, asked all the cities to take the six
cities as examples and increase efforts in pollution control.
</P>
<P>
China's urbanization process has speeded up during the past
decade. By the end of last year, it had 666 cities with a
population of 350 million. Heavy population, concentrated industry
and poor infrastructure have been an added burden on urban
pollution-control work.
</P>
<P>
With the Chinese government's unremitting efforts, however,
Chinese cities have made remarkable environmental improvement,
Wang said. Inspections have demonstrated that the environmental
quality of the six model cities is quite good even compared to
sustainable-development cities in the world.

<HEADLINE> Rules for Internet Must Suit Social Background, Chinese Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 4 (Xinhua)-- Each country should establish
laws, rules and ethics in accordance with its own social
background to govern the use of the Internet, so that the
information industry will make greater and healthier contributions
to the mankind in the next century.
</P>
<P>
Lin Quan, secretary-general of the State Science and Technology
Commission, made the remarks today at a seminar titled
"Inforamtion Imperative: Rules of the Road for the Internet",
attended by both Chinese and U.S. information officials and
experts.
</P>
<P>
Lin said, the Internet, as the craddle of the information age,
has exerted prefound impact on the work mode and living style of
the mankind. "In discussing the rules governing the use of the
Internet, it is important to remind that the rules must be made in
accordance with the United Nations acknowledged principles, in
respect of the different political systems and economic
development and cultural background of various countries. We
should avoid enlarging the gap between developed and developing
countries in the course of information globalization and we should
arouse our concern over the dissemination of harmful information
while expanding the Internet," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
According to unofficial statistics, China now has 500,000
Internet subscribers, most of whom are businesses, government
organs and scientific and cultural institutions in the more
developed eastern part of the country. China also has a growing
number of family-based subscribers, but the percentage is
relatively small.
</P>
<P>
Lin said Chinese parents have realized that the Internet
contains information of low taste that is not suited to their
children and have taken steps to educate them not to read those
information. But, he said, the measures focus on ethical education
instead of exerting fast rules. "The country has not yet set up
any rules and regulations to control the access to the Internet,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the United Nations Educational, Scientific and
Cultural Organization convened last March on the ethics and rules
over the Internet and did not result in a universal rule as the
delegates varied in their opinions on a lot of issues. But he
said the conference was useful for Chinese and foreign experts to
further discuss the issues in order to exchange ideas and increase
understanding.
</P>
<P>
Lin Quan told the seminar that the Iinternet, that originated
in the United States, was first introduced to China in 1993 and
has flourished over the past four years. And it will develop rapidly
with the fast growth of the country's telecommunications
and computer industries.
</P>
<P>
According to Lin, China has established four major national
inforamtion networks that have access to the Internet. They
are ChinaNet run by the Ministry of Post and Telecommunications,
CERNET by the State Education Commission, NCFC by the Chinese
Academy of Sciences and STINET by the State Science and Technology
Commission. In addition, information service companies that are
hooked up to the Internet platform have also mushroomed all over
the country.
</P>
<P>
The seminar was co-organized by the State Science and
Technology Commission, the United Nations Development Program and
the World Times Inc. of the United States. It was sponsored by
American AT&AMP;T, International Data Group Asia and Digital.

<HEADLINE> Rules for Internet Must Suit Social Background, Chinese Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 4 (Xinhua)-- Each country should establish
laws, rules and ethics in accordance with its own social
background to govern the use of the Internet, so that the
information industry will make greater and healthier contributions
to the mankind in the next century.
</P>
<P>
Lin Quan, secretary-general of the State Science and Technology
Commission, made the remarks today at a seminar titled
"Inforamtion Imperative: Rules of the Road for the Internet",
attended by both Chinese and U.S. information officials and
experts.
</P>
<P>
Lin said, the Internet, as the craddle of the information age,
has exerted prefound impact on the work mode and living style of
the mankind. "In discussing the rules governing the use of the
Internet, it is important to remind that the rules must be made in
accordance with the United Nations acknowledged principles, in
respect of the different political systems and economic
development and cultural background of various countries. We
should avoid enlarging the gap between developed and developing
countries in the course of information globalization and we should
arouse our concern over the dissemination of harmful information
while expanding the Internet," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
According to unofficial statistics, China now has 500,000
Internet subscribers, most of whom are businesses, government
organs and scientific and cultural institutions in the more
developed eastern part of the country. China also has a growing
number of family-based subscribers, but the percentage is
relatively small.
</P>
<P>
Lin said Chinese parents have realized that the Internet
contains information of low taste that is not suited to their
children and have taken steps to educate them not to read those
information. But, he said, the measures focus on ethical education
instead of exerting fast rules. "The country has not yet set up
any rules and regulations to control the access to the Internet,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the United Nations Educational, Scientific and
Cultural Organization convened last March on the ethics and rules
over the Internet and did not result in a universal rule as the
delegates varied in their opinions on a lot of issues. But he
said the conference was useful for Chinese and foreign experts to
further discuss the issues in order to exchange ideas and increase
understanding.
</P>
<P>
Lin Quan told the seminar that the Iinternet, that originated
in the United States, was first introduced to China in 1993 and
has flourished over the past four years. And it will develop rapidly
with the fast growth of the country's telecommunications
and computer industries.
</P>
<P>
According to Lin, China has established four major national
inforamtion networks that have access to the Internet. They
are ChinaNet run by the Ministry of Post and Telecommunications,
CERNET by the State Education Commission, NCFC by the Chinese
Academy of Sciences and STINET by the State Science and Technology
Commission. In addition, information service companies that are
hooked up to the Internet platform have also mushroomed all over
the country.
</P>
<P>
The seminar was co-organized by the State Science and
Technology Commission, the United Nations Development Program and
the World Times Inc. of the United States. It was sponsored by
American AT&AMP;T, International Data Group Asia and Digital.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The London International
Financial Futures and Options Exchange (LIFFE) saw its busiest
October ever, trading a record of 25.72 million contracts.
</P>
<P>
Statistics released today show that average daily volume
amounted to 1.1 million contracts, representing a daily nominal
turnover of 254.45 billion pounds (414.75 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
LIFFE, the largest futures and options exchange in Europe,
traded a total of 181.76 million contracts in the past 10 months,
29 percent up on the same period of last year and exceeding the
Exchange's total annual volume for 1996.
</P>
<P>
Jack Wigglesworth, chairman of LIFFE, attributed the record
volume in October to uncertainty surrounding Britain's
participation in Economic and Monetary Union and the turmoil in
global stock markets over the last week.
</P>
<P>
"The Exchange's record volume demonstrates the ability of LIFFE
to meet the needs of the world's financial community by offering a
wide range of instruments enabling market users to manage their
exposure to financial risk and volatility," he added.

<HEADLINE> Herbs Can Prolong Life for Cancer Patients </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese traditional medicine,
integrated with chemotherapy, can help prolong cancer patients'
lives, a medical expert said today.
</P>
<P>
"Some herbs have proved to be effective for those, who are
suffering from cancer in an advanced stage and who are recovering
from tumor-removal operations," said Piao Bingkui, vice-president
of the Anti-Cancer Association of China.
</P>
<P>
Piao, who also heads Beijing Guang'anmen Hospital, said the
herbs can improve the immune system to help cancer patients
recover more rapidly from chemotherapies and surgery.
</P>
<P>
Clinical studies show that using Chinese oral preparations
together with chemotherapy on stomach cancer patients reduces side
effects and enhances the treatment's effectiveness, Piao said.
</P>
<P>
About 79 percent of the 103 advanced cases of stomach cancer
who received combined therapies survived more than three
years. And 55 percent survived more than five years. Both survival
rates are much higher than in cases involving only chemotherapy,
he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the integration of traditional Chinese medicine
and Western medicine, the hospital experimented with other forms
of herbal treatments such as injecting herbal medicines into
stomach and brain tumors and using herbs externally to control the
growth of superficial tumors.
</P>
<P>
Studies of anti-cancer treatments with herbal medicine has
already entered the fields of cell and molecular biology, he said,
adding that its role in preventing and controlling cancer has
attracted the interest of experts around the world.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Get Tough on Violent Crimes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 4 (Xinhua) -- South Africa is expected
to introduce amendments to its criminal law to get tough on
violent crimes, the Citizen newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
South African parliament will be asked Thursday to endorse
drastic new steps against crime, including automatic life
imprisonment for slaying a police officer, repeated or violent
rape, and robbery in which a victim is killed, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Under the Criminal Law Amendment Bill, gang-raping, repeated
rape of the same victim by one person and serial rape will also
carry a sentence of life imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
The new measures also provide a minimum of 15-year jail term
for hijacking and five-year imprisonment for a first offender
committing any crime that involves the use of a firearm.
</P>
<P>
Minimum sentences for crimes of violence, strict new bail laws
and laws enabling courts to sentence criminals to non-parole
periods of imprisonment are all due to be enforced before the end
of the year.
</P>
<P>
The bill was approved by the Justice Portfolio Committee of
the National Assembly at Monday night.
</P>
<P>
The bill proposed life imprisonment for any premeditated or
planned murder, which includes hit-squad cases, taxi and gang
slayings, as well as the killing of police officers or witnesses
in court cases.
</P>
<P>
Life imprisonment will also apply when a criminal kills
somebody while committing or attempting to commit robbery or
rape, or in cases where there is repeated rape, gang-raping or
serial rape.
</P>
<P>
A further clause provides life imprisonment for a person who
rapes a girl under 16 or a mentally ill woman, or who commits
rape "knowing that he has acquired AIDS or HIV."
</P>
<P>
Minimum sentences of 15 years for a first offense, with 20
years for a second and 25 years for a third offense, are set out
for another set of crimes.
</P>
<P>
These include any murder other than planned murder,
hijackings, robbery with aggravating circumstances, dealing or
smuggling in arms and ammunition, and dealing or smuggling drugs
valued at more than 50,000 Rand (10,400 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
However, in the case of gang or syndicate smuggling or dealing
drugs, the value of the goods is lowered to 10,000 Rand (2,080
dollars).
</P>
<P>
A third set of offenses carries a minimum of 10 years for a
first conviction, 15 years for a second and 20 years for a third.
</P>
<P>
These include any rape cases not listed in the more serious
categories, indecent assault on any child under 16 or assault
that causes grievous bodily harm.

<HEADLINE> Hamburg SPD, Greens to Form State Coalition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The Social Democrats (SPD) and the
leftist-environmentalist Green alliance (GAL) in the northern
German port city of Hamburg have agreed to form a coalition
government to rule the city-state in the next four years.
</P>
<P>
After 13 rounds of talks, they agreed Monday that the Green
alliance will hold three cabinet posts and control the ministries
concerning environment, urban planning, science and higher
education and European policy.
</P>
<P>
The SPD will control the ministries for economy, schools,
welfare, culture, justice, internal affairs and construction.
</P>
<P>
The SPD mayor designate Ortwin Runde noted that "no conflicts
were swept under the carpet" during the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Social Democrats lost their previous independent Statt Partei
coalition partner in the September 21 regional elections. The SPD
saw the worst post-war election result in its northern stronghold,
gaining 36.2 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
The conservative Christian Democratic Union of German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl won 30.7 percent of the vote and the GAL
13.9 percent. No other party met the five percent mark necessary
for any seats in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
The Hamburg elections are regarded as an indicator for
Germany's 1998 general elections. Analysts took a close interest
to see what kind of coalition government was formed.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Economic Woes Force PM to Quit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Chavalit
Yongchaiyudh Monday finally decided to resign, a move which is a
surprise to some people, but may not be so surprising to many
others as the country's economy continues to be in a slowdown.
</P>
<P>
Chavalit announced his resignation at a time when the country's
currency, the baht, suffered a fresh bout of plunging recently,
hitting a record low of more than 41 baht against the U.S. dollar
last weekend. It seems that the unchecked fall of the baht is the
most direct reason for Chavalit to choose to leave.
</P>
<P>
The stability of the baht has been the focus of concern over
the country's economic situation this year and the Thai government
spent a huge amount of its foreign reserves in mid-May to defend
the currency against speculation.
</P>
<P>
However, with the country's foreign exchange reserves depleting
significantly, the government found it difficult to maintain the
stability of the baht with the limited foreign reserves.
Therefore, it took the radical step of floating the baht on July
2, leading to a further reduction in the country's foreign
exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Besides, in exchange for aid from the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) to overcome the economic difficulty, the government had
to implement radical economic reform measures, which it had hoped
would help restore the confidence of investors and bring the
economy back on the track in the long run. Instead, the measures
led to a free-fall of the baht, rising inflation and increasing
unemployment.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the financial sector failed to see an immediate
improvement in liquidity and the problems of the 58 cash-tight
finance firms, whose operations were suspended by the government
according to the IMF requirements, remained unsolved.
</P>
<P>
As the measures introduced by the government were affecting
more and more people, the public's resentment against the Chavalit
government was mounting and the call for the change of government
rising.
</P>
<P>
The Chavalit cabinet has long been believed to lack a strong
economic team to run the country's economy. Chavalit had been
following the policy of inviting non-party economic experts to
assume the key economic posts in the cabinet, but the policy
appeared to be unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
Former Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Amnuay
Virawan offered in late June this year to resign, saying he failed
to make the country's economy turn for the better. In October,
former Finance Minister Thanong Bidaya, who succeeded Amnuay, also
chose to quit due to the country's economic woes. The frequent
changes of key cabinet members adversely affected the confidence
of investors.
</P>
<P>
Chavalit made the last cabinet reshuffle on October 24 under
pressure from both the public and the coalition partners in the
hope that the six-party coalition government would survive until
the next general election scheduled for early next year. But the
reshuffle neither boosted the public's morale nor stopped the baht
from declining further.
</P>
<P>
And the continuous fall of the baht also frustrated the
public's confidence in the country's overall economic situation.
</P>
<P>
Chavalit came to power at a time when the country was already
seeing an economic slowdown and he had tried every possible way,
including some bold steps, to restructure the country's economy.
However, his effort proved futile although the prime minister said
he had done his best.
</P>
<P>
In deciding to resign, Chavalit has shown a great spirit of
self-sacrifice and he has done so in the hope of reviving public
confidence in the country's economy and thus benefiting the
country as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Yet, whoever will replace him will find that there is no easy
way to redress the country's economic woes.

was not proposing an increase in air fare, the Jordan Times
reported today.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference after opening the 53rd IATA general
assembly here Monday, IATA President Pierre Jeanniot said world
airlines were waging a fare war, and that rise of fuel cost would
affect airlines' profits in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Most airlines wanted to increase air fare due to rise of fuel
cost, but fierce competition had made them hesitate to do so,
Jeanniot said.
</P>
<P>
He estimated that the profit of world air transport this year
would reach 4.5 billion U.S. dollars, 1.5 billion more than that
of last year.

<HEADLINE> Premier Meets Spanish Visitor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Premier Li Peng met with Josep
Pique, Spain's Minister of Industry and Energy, and his
delegation at the Great Hall of the People today.
</P>
<P>
Li welcomed Pique to China and said the relationship between
China and Spain has been going well since they established
diplomatic ties.
</P>
<P>
China highly appreciates the Spanish government's stand to
stick to the "one China" policy and not to have any official links
with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
He fondly recalled his 1992 visit to Spain and his meeting with
Spain's Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar at last year's World Food
Summit in Rome.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have made substantial progress toward
friendship and a cooperative relationship not only in economic
matters, but also in politics and international affairs, Li
said. Their efforts also increased mutual understanding and
trust, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said China is willing to expand overall cooperation with
Spain, especially in the economic area. He said he hoped Spanish
entrepreneurs would communicate and cooperate with western and
central China.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation should not be limited to large projects only but
should extend to medium and small ones at which the Spanish excel,
he said. This would increase opportunities in China for Spanish
businesses, he added.
</P>
<P>
Pique praised China's achievements in political and economic
areas.
</P>
<P>
The Spanish people also cherish friendly feelings toward
Chinese, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
"The Spanish Government is ready to cooperate with China in
various industries," he said.
</P>
<P>
Spanish businesses sincerely want to cooperate with China, and
they are confident of building a good image in the Chinese market,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Also present at the meeting were Bao Xuding, China's Minister
of the Machine-Building Industry; Zhang Deguang, vice-foreign
minister; and Lu Congmin, deputy director of the Foreign Affairs
Office under the State Council.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Albanian Prime Minister Fatos
Nano and Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic met Monday for the
first summit between the two countries in half a century and the
two agreed to set about normalizing long-frozen bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
Meeting on the sideline of a summit of Balkan leaders in Crete,
Greece, the two leaders discussed the current situation in their
countries and agreed to increase contacts, the Albanian press
reported.
</P>
<P>
Nano said the 90-minute meeting, the first Albanian-Yugoslav
summit since 1947, "created conditions for thawing ties and
opening up dialogue between the two Balkan neighbors."
</P>
<P>
He said he had proposed the two sides increase
contacts. Albania was ready to sign accords with Yugoslavia to
boost bilateral cooperation, especially to promote personnel
contacts, he added.
</P>
<P>
"Personnel contacts require plenty of prior political
contacts," he said.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic described the talks as "fruitful" and a "first step"
leading to closer relations.
</P>
<P>
"We have decided to start the process of normalization of
relations between Yugoslavia and Albania. I consider it to be a
very important step for a beginning," Milosevic said.
</P>
<P>
"After 50 years of frozen relations between Yugoslavia and
Albania, we had the first opportunity for talks. I think the talks
were interesting and, I hope, beneficial to both of us," he said.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also discussed the position of the Albanian
population in Yugoslavia's Kosovo province. Nano asked Milosevic
to talk with Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
While admitting that the Kosovo problem exists, Milosevic
insisted the issue was "an internal issue of Yugoslavia, an issue
about a Yugoslav ethnic minority."

<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, November 4 (Xinhua) -- China's "Zhongshan" scientific
research station in Antarctica will get a sewage disposal unit to
solve its waste water problem.
</P>
<P>
The equipment will be sent to Antarctica with the 14th
Antarctic expedition on November 15, according to the State
Oceanography Administration's Third Research Institute in Xiamen,
Fujian Province. The institute is the producer of the equipment.
</P>
<P>
The waste water will be treated with artificially-bred
anaerobic organisms, that do not require oxygen to maintain life,
before being discharged into the sea.
</P>
<P>
These types of organisms do not exist easily in the South Pole
because of low temperatures, strong ultraviolet rays, and other
unfavorable factors, experts say.
</P>
<P>
"Zhongshan", China's first scientific research station at
Antarctica, was established in February, 1989.
</P>
<P>
A second station, "Changcheng (the Great Wall)", was
established in July, 1985.

<HEADLINE> People Who Map out World's Top Water Control Project (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANDOUPING (Three Gorges), November 4 (Xinhua) -- If
construction of the world's top hydropower station on the world's
third largest river -- the Yangtze -- is described as a play, then
the proprietor is the director, the contractors actors, and the
designer the playwright.
</P>
<P>
That is how engineers of the Yangtze River Water Conservation
Committee, who have been mapping out the blueprint for the gigantic
Three Gorges Project for decades, define their role.
</P>
<P>
Two people in the committee are often cited as the leading
brains behind the project. Zheng Shouren, its chief engineer who
stays all year round at the worksite directing construction work,
while Yuan Dafu, executive deputy chief of its design institute
who organizes the work of designing team on the back stage.
</P>
<P>
Zheng, in his 50s, has worked at the forefront of the project
for nearly four years, and what he and his fellow designers care
most is how to guarantee the damming of the river as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
"The main problems are the water depth at 60 meters and the
projected highest flow at about 20,000 cu m per second, both the
world's records," explains the chief engineer.
</P>
<P>
After months of consideration and experiments, Zheng and his
colleagues set forth a plan to dump rocks, boulders and gravels
directly from ships into the water in the gap between the two
sections of the cofferdam so as to guard against potential
collapse instead of the traditional method used in the past to
rolling them down from the slopes of the dike heads. When the two
sections jointed up, the river was then blocked by the cofferdam.

<TEXT>
<P>
The plan has effectively lessened the water depth at the gap to
about 22 meters and reduced the opening to 40 meters, which helps
guarantee the successful damming this Saturday.
</P>
<P>
When Zheng is busy at the dam site to implement design schemes,
Yuan Dafu also has a full schedule and is engrossed in the
formulating piles of design pictures, bidding letters, and working
on all sorts of technical reports for the Three Gorges Project.
</P>
<P>
Since 1995, the project has claimed almost all his working
hours, and the design institute's routine meetings had to be held
at weekends.
</P>
<P>
Known for his strict style of work, Yuan yet displays his
liveliness in spare time, which makes him popular among his
subordinates. Nevertheless, to his regret, nowadays he has little
time for his pastime -- listening to the Opera of Shaoxing popular
in his native Zhejiang province, and playing Chinese chess.
</P>
<P>
In spite of his packed schedule, Yuan, who is over sixty, keeps
the habit of jogging and practicing the traditional Chinese Qigong
each morning.
</P>
<P>
"A good health has helped me to be enthusiastic with every
piece of work," said Yuan, adding that it is all the more
important since nothing related to the Three Gorges Project is
negligible.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the work of designing, the Yangtze River Water
Conservation Committee also takes charge of plans for resettlement
and management supervision.
</P>
<P>
In modern civil engineering endeavors, management supervisors
are indispensable figures in control of construction quality.

<P>
In the Three Gorges project, Yang Pusheng, chief of the
committee's management supervision arm, is the key figure to
ensure the quality of this largest scheme since the Great Wall
built over two millenia ago.
</P>
<P>
Yang noted that sometimes it was hard to avoid conflicts with
contractors in such a massive engineering scheme, and "when such
conflicts arise, persistence in quality is the foremost
responsibility of management supervisors."
</P>
<P>
On the evening of October 27, when supervisors at the worksite
found that the pace of construction at the cofferdams was a bit
too fast, they worried that might effect the solidity of the
cofferdams. Then, they urged the builders to slow down their pace
and, by midnight, the work finally suspended at the construction
site.
</P>
<P>
Since construction of the cofferdams upstream and downstream
was launched last September, according to Yang, supervisors issued
orders on workstoppage three times so as to ensure the quality of
construction.
</P>
<P>
A recent appraisal by the authoritative departments cited the
first-phase project as conforming with all the pre-set standards.
</P>
<P>
The words most often on the lips of those working in the
Yangtze River Water Conservation Committee are "we are a team".
And a long namelist can be found here to be related to the Three
Gorges project: Wen Fubo, one of the first designers; Chen Deji,
the main hero who located Sandouping as the site for the project;
and Cui Zhengquan, the survey master who found new homes for
relocated people...
</P>
<P>
"Turning the Three Gorges Project into reality fills us with
the greatest joy," said Zheng Shouren. "The credit goes to
generations of experts who have worked for the committee instead
of a just few people."

<HEADLINE> Reports Confirm Ethiopian Ammunition Consignment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Reports from the southern
Somali town of Kismaio have confirmed the arrival of ammunition
consignment from Ethiopia five days ago.
</P>
<P>
The ammunition, which consisted of five tons of miscellaneous
small arms rounds, RPGs, heavy machine guns, anti-personnel mines
and attack grenades, was brought on a Hercules plane belonging to
the Ethiopian national air force.
</P>
<P>
According to a reliable eyewitness in Kismaio, the plane
carrying the ammunition and two Somali warlords, General Mohamed
Said Hirsi Morgan and the Ogaden Colonel, Ahmed Hashi Mohamud,
flew from the border town of Dolow controlled by the Ethiopian
forces.
</P>
<P>
The eyewitness also said that the ammunition is now being
stored in the command control center of General Morgan in
Kismaio.
</P>
<P>
The arrival of the weapons in Kismaio, 500 km south of the
capital Mogadishu, pleased the morale of Morgan's militiamen who
have borne a long standing animosity with Hussein Mohamed Aidid's
Habar Gidir clan and a good portion of the Marehan clan.
</P>
<P>
Morgan fully supports the Ethiopian-backed National Salvation
Council (NSC) formed in Sodare village of Ethiopia early this
year.
</P>
<P>
This new ammunition consignment may undermine the current
Egyptian efforts in convening a reconciliation meeting among the
warring parties of the NSC and Hussein Aidid. Leaders of both
sides are now in the Egyptian capital of Cairo.
</P>
<P>
There's no word yet from the factions opposing the NSC over
the arrival of the ammunition.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time that the current Ethiopian government
sends ammunition to Somalia defying the U.N. resolution 733 which
imposed weapons embargo on Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 100 tons of ammunition is confirmed to have been sent
to Somalia by the Ethiopian government since January this year.
</P>
<P>
Morgan was visiting Ethiopia since last month at the
invitation of the Ethiopian army officials.
</P>
<P>
Sources said Morgan, General Omar Hagi Masalle (chairman of
the Marehan clan), and Colonel Mohamud met the Ethiopian defense
minister and discussed about a possible elimination of the Muslim
fundamentalist group of Al-Itihad based in the Lower and Middle
Jubba regions of Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia still remains in control of the three main Somali
border towns of Dolow, Bulo Hawo and Luq following its alleged
trace for Muslim fundamentalists in June this year.

TEHRAN, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Tens of thousands of Iranians
gathered in front of the former U.S. embassy here this morning to
celebrate the takeover by the Iranian students in 1979.
</P>
<P>
Chanting slogans such as "Down with the U.S." and "Down with
Israel," demonstrators burned the flags of the U.S. and Israel,
showing their wrath against the anti-Iranian policies of United
States.
</P>
<P>
Holding placards with pictures of the Iranian leaders, the
mass shouted "Iran will not make any compromise with the U.S." and
"we will continue to resist the American arrogant policies."
</P>
<P>
Schools throughout the country marked anniversary of takeover
of the American embassy with the ringing of "Down with America
bell" at 08:00 hours (04:30 GMT) this morning.
</P>
<P>
In front of the former U.S. embassy, Iran's hardline
Parliament Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri made a harsh statement in
the rally and called on the people to continue their
anti-U.S. fight.
</P>
<P>
He said that it was necessary for Iran's young generation to

<HEADLINE> Chinese Economic, Trade Mission Going To South Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 4 (Xinhua) -- An 80-member Chinese economic
and trade delegation, headed by Vice-Minister of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation Shi Guangsheng, left here today for an
11-day visit to South Africa.
</P>
<P>
It is made up of Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation, State Planning Commission, and Ministry of the
Metallurgical Industry officials, and executives of 50 large
companies. It was invited by South Africa's Minister of Trade and
Industry Alec Erwin and is the largest Chinese delegation ever to
go to South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Shi said he hopes the two countries' government departments and
enterprises will exchange views during the visit to help expand
bilateral long-term economic and trade co-operation.
</P>
<P>
South Africa is China's largest African trading
partner. Bilateral trade volume in 1996 was 1.35 billion US
dollars, compared with 14.65 million US dollars in
1991. China-South Africa trade was 1.1 billion US dollars in the
first nine months of this year, up 15 percent from the same period
of last year.
</P>
<P>
Chinese firms have 40 offices or branches in South Africa, and
100 million US dollars in investment in industry, agriculture,
trade, service, and other sectors.
</P>
<P>
Shi said the purpose of the visit is to "demonstrate to the
South African government and business people the confidence and
determination of the Chinese government in developing economic and
trade co-operation with that country."
</P>
<P>
He said China and South Africa can supplement each other. China
can import mineral products, and mining equipment and technology
it needs, and provide machinery and electrical products, light
industrial products, textiles, and chemicals to South Africa.
</P>
<P>
China and South Africa are expected to sign a series of trade
agreements and investment accords. Members of the delegation will
also participate in local trade seminars.

<P>
HONG KONG, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Standard Chartered, one of
the oldest banks in Hong Kong, entered into an agreement today
with the leading property developer, Sun Hung Kai, on the purchase
of new office space in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The bank is paying 1.3 billion HK dollars (167 million U.S.
dollars) for 15 floors in Tower Two of a twin tower project,
Millennium City, developed by Sun Hung Kai Properties in Kwun
Tong, a traditional industrial area in eastern Kowloon.
</P>
<P>
In addition to these floors, the bank has the option to lease
or buy the next five floors of the tower, which is to be named
after Standard Chartered.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference here today, David Brougham, group
executive director of the bank, said, "Standard Chartered is
investing heavily in Hong Kong and the agreement is a clear,
billion dollar commitment to the growth and development of our
business."
</P>
<P>
"It is an expression of our faith in the future of this great
city and its continuing prosperity," he noted.
</P>
<P>
After it is ready for occupation in the fourth quarter of 1998,
the tower will bring under one roof around 2,000 staff of the bank
currently scattered in different premises around Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Millennium City is the largest commercial development in Kwun
Tong and is leading Kwun Tong's transformation from an industrial
area into a thriving commercial hub, according to Raymond Kwok,
vice chairman and managing director of Sun Hung Kai Properties.
</P>
<P>
More than half of the city's office space has been leased out

<HEADLINE> Conference on Global Urban Poverty to Be Held in Florence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, November 4 (Xinhua) -- International agencies will
convene a conference in Florence, Italy, next week to discuss the
global urban poverty, the United Nations Office at Geneva (UNOG)
announced here today.
</P>
<P>
The conference, entitled "Governance and Participation:
Practical Approaches to Urban Poverty Reduction", will bring
together more than 200 participants representing governments,
local authorities, U.N. agencies, non-governmental organizations,
international aid agencies and research institutions from around
the world.
</P>
<P>
One of the expected outcomes of the conference, scheduled for
November 9-13, UNOG said, is the launching of an international
forum on urban poverty, which is a partnership among
municipalities, bilateral and multilateral support agencies,
private foundations, NGOs and community-based organizations that
are active in the struggle against poverty at the local level.
</P>
<P>
This forum will provide a permanent mechanism for the
discussion of crucial aspects of urban poverty and of the policies
needed to reduce it.
</P>
<P>
The conference, jointly organized by the Nairobi-based United
Nations Center for Human Settlements (HABITAT) and the
Municipality of Florence, is a follow-up to an international
meeting on urban poverty held in Recife, Brazil, in March 1996.
</P>
<P>
The conference will enable participants to work towards a
visible framework for urban poverty reduction, based on the Recife
Declaration on Urban Poverty.
</P>
<P>
Focusing on local government as the key factor in the struggle
against urban poverty, the conference will examine the political
role of cities and local authorities, particularly their role as
mediators between the urban poor and central governments.
</P>
<P>
The participants will enter into a "social contract" which will
commit them to reducing and eradicating poverty.

<HEADLINE> Rhee Sets up New Party to Run Presidential Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The No. 2 presidential candidate
Rhee In-je formally launched his own political party today, 52
days after he bolted from the ruling New Korea Party (NKP).
</P>
<P>
The New Party by the People (NPP) nominated the former Kyonggi
provincial governor Rhee as its presidential candidate, elected
former House Speaker Lee Man-sup, who recently left the NKP, as
its president and lawmaker Chang Eul-byung as its supreme member.
</P>
<P>
Rhee resigned as Kyonggi governor and left the ruling party in
September to run the presidential election on his own, breaking
his promise to stay in the party after he lost the party's
presidential candidacy to Chairman Lee Hoi-chang in the party's
nomination contest in July.
</P>
<P>
Rhee's continued high popularity and another candidate Lee's
unexpected weak show in the early stages of the presidential race
made it difficult for the loser to give up his presidential
ambition, political analysts said.
</P>
<P>
"We will achieve authentic national and generational unity
through a change in political generation," Rhee said in his
acceptance speech for the NPP's presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
Rhee sharply rebuked the "DJP alliance" between opposition
leaders Kim Dae-jung and Kim Jong-pil, calling it a "collusion" to
share power.
</P>
<P>
The inauguration of the NPP is expected to speed up the split
of the ruling party which is in fierce factional feud due to the
continually low approval rate of the party candidate Lee Hoi-chang.
</P>
<P>
The non-mainstream Minju faction, led by President Kim
Young-sam, are pressing Lee Hoi-chang to give up his candidacy,
threatening a collective bolt from the party unless Lee accepts
its demand.
</P>
<P>
As the mainstream Minjong faction led by Lee refuses to bow,
the Minju faction is expected to leave the NKP soon to join the
NPP, to help expand the political clout of its onetime factional
colleague Rhee In-je.
</P>
<P>
Along with the political expansion, the NPP also hopes to
narrow the race down to a two-way competition between Rhee and the
opposition leader Kim Dae-jung, who maintains a solid lead in
various opinion polls, trailed by Rhee and Lee in the second and
third place.
</P>
<P>
With the the coalition of DJP alliance and the low popularity
of former Seoul Mayor Cho Soon, the presidential race is narrowing
to a three-way competition among Kim Dae-jung, Rhee In-je and
ruling party's Lee Hoi-chang.
</P>
<P>
Born in Nonsan, South Chungshong province, the 49-year-old Rhee
was a two-term lawmaker until being elected governor of the
populous Kyonggi Province in the local elections in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The lawyer-turned politician, a close associate of President
Kim Young-sam, served as the first Labor Minister under the Kim
Young-sam government.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Denies He Incited Killing of Rabin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu has rejected the charge that he incited the
assassination of former Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, the
Jerusalem Post said today.
</P>
<P>
In an article published on the paper on the occasion of the
second anniversary of Rabin's death, Netanyahu called the murder
"a terrible nightmare" which "produces a primal, wrenching
response, an earthquake of soul."
</P>
<P>
He added that "two years later those memories are still vivid,
and will be with me always."
</P>
<P>
He recalled in the article his acquaintance with Rabin despite
their political rivalry and the shock, disbelief and desperation
he felt when he was informed of Rabin's murder by a radical Jew.
</P>
<P>
On November 4, 1995, Rabin was shot to death in Tel Aviv by
Yigal Amir, a radical Jewish youth, who claimed he had done so to
prevent further handover of land to Arabs.
</P>
<P>
Following the incident, Netanyahu, then opposition Likud
leader, was widely blamed for incitement against Rabin and his
government over its peace policies.
</P>
<P>
In his article, Netanyahu expressed the view that the murder of
Rabin was only "a heinous crime by one despicable individual," and
not caused by incitement and campaign rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
He attacked the leftist camp was making an "unforgivable"
attempt by holding more than half of the population (or the
rightists) the responsibility for the assassination.
</P>
<P>
He described the murder as a "collective guilt' by the whole
nation.
</P>
<P>
Finally, Netanyahu called for an end to political violence,
saying that "We must prevent the recurrence of such a crime. We
must never forget what happened here. We must understand that
violence is an enemy to us all."
</P>
<P>
Israeli peace organizations will hold today a series of
memorial services and demonstrations throughout the country to
remember Rabin and condemn the current Likud government's attempt
to destroy his peace legacy.
</P>
<P>
The rightist camp, however, charged the leftists for taking
advantage of Rabin's murder to spread incitement against the
government and the rightists.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Economy Continues Growth: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The economy of Saudi
Arabia has continued its healthy growth throughout the first
nine months of 1997 and indications show that this trend would go
on despite the unstable world oil market situation.
</P>
<P>
Governor of the Saudi Monetary Agency Hamad Al-Siari made the
remarks in his annual address before an audience including Saudi
King Fahd and other government officials Monday night, according
to Kuwait News Agency.
</P>
<P>
He said that Saudi gross domestic product (GDP) has realized a
growth of 8.6 percent in 1996 and the economy was to maintain the
similar growth rate this year according to preliminary estimates.
</P>
<P>
Al-Siari said Saudi oil revenues, which are still the main
source of state income, would be marginally higher this year than
last year's 11 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
With regard to the state budget deficit, he said it reduced
from 14.6 percent (of the GDP) in 1992 to only 3.7 percent last
year. He hoped that this down trend would continue for the next
few years to realize a balance in the budget by the end of the
current five year development plan which ends in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Saudi industrial sector other than oil and agricultural
sectors is also expected to maintain a good growth momentum, he
said.
</P>
<P>
On the performance of Saudi banks, the governor said they
maintained their exemplary roles in serving the national economy,
 adding that the volume of deposits increased in the first eight
months of this year by an average of 2.6 percent to about 221
billion riyals (58.9 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
He also noted the marked activity in the Saudi stock market
during the first nine months of this year, saying it witnessed an
increase in the value of traded shares by 186 percent compared
with the corresponding period in 1996.
</P>
<P>
On the private sector which has been playing an increasing
role in the Saudi economy, Al-Siari said the sector has invested
more and more funds in various government projects and individual
businessmen are urged to mobilize their potentials and resources
in investments which would increase the chances of economic
growth and help in employing national manpower.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi Monetary Agency is in charge of monetary matters in
the kingdom and provides the king with an annual report two
months before the issuance of the state budget.

<HEADLINE> Controversial Housing Project to Move Ahead in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Israel plans to sell first
1,000 housing units next year in the controversial Har Homa
settlement in the disputed East Jerusalem, a local newspaper
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Hebrew daily Haaretz reported in its leading front-page
story that the sale of the first 1,000 Har Homa housing units was
included in the 1998-1999 working plan compiled by Israeli
Construction and Housing Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, Israel will build a total of 6,500 housing
units in Har Homa, where the first phase of construction work has
been completed following nearly eight months of non-stop
work. Circular concrete roads and pipelines have been laid around
the Har Homa hill, which was originally covered by pine trees.
</P>
<P>
The Har Homa construction had caused a seven-month freeze in
the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, which was broken in early
October following the intensive mediation by the United States.
</P>
<P>
The Haaretz report was published in coincidence with the
convening of Israeli-Palestinian peace talks in Washington under
the auspices of U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy and Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) deputy head Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen) are expected
to conduct serious negotiations on implementing the rest of the
interim agreements as well as on defining the "time-out" of
Israeli settlement activities.
</P>
<P>
The PNA has been strongly demanding for an end to Israeli
settlement construction, including the Har Homa project, in order
to achieve progress in the peace talks.

<HEADLINE> p d s  2434 China-Three Gorges-Economy-1 Three Gorges Project Boosting Chinese Economy (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANDOUPING, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Claimed as the Chinese
people's most ambitious undertaking after the Great Wall built
more than 2,000 years ago, the Three Gorges Project is expected to
give a fresh boost to the country's economy for the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
This view is shared by authoritative Chinese officials and
economists Xinhua has reached.
</P>
<P>
"The Three Gorges Project will become a new point of economic
growth in the Yangtze valley, and in turn prompt the Chinese
economy to maintain the speedy growth in the next century," Li Boxi,
a leading economist with the State Council Development Center, told
Xinhua in an interview today.
</P>
<P>
The Yangtze Valley, one of the most prosperous areas in China,
is an axial area in the country's economic layout. It boasts one
third of the national population, and constitutes two fifths of
the Chinese economy.
</P>
<P>
"China's economic set-up is featured by something like an arrow
on the bowstring, but the arrow, or the Yangtze Valley, was always
in the lack of an adequate impetus to speed ahead," according to
Chen Xuanqing, a State Planning Commission official in charge of
the planning of the nation's economic layout.
</P>
<P>
Since catastrophic floods have frequented the region over the
past 2,000 years, exposing 15 million people on Central China
Plain to an incessant threat and 1.5 million hectares of fields
to the danger of being flooded.
</P>
<P>
Three extremely severe floods in 1930s and 1950s claimed a loss
of 320,000 lives and inundated more than eight million hectares of
cropland along the Yangtze.
</P>
<P>
An energy shortfall has also hindered the long-term development
of this economic powerhouse of China.
</P>
<P>
However, the Three Gorges Project is expected to spur this
"gigantic arrow of economy", since it will harness the floods on
Yangtze and fully tap the river's abundant hydro-power resources.
</P>
<P>
A huge reservoir with a capacity of 22.15 billion cu m will be
formed behind the mammoth Three Gorges Dam, protecting the areas
along the middle reaches of the Yangtze from the onslaught of
floods.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the world's biggest hydro-power station will also be
built, and it is expected to provide 84.7 billion kwh of clean
electricity annually for the energy-thirsty eastern and central
China, accounting for almost one seventh of the nation's total
hydro-power output in 1992.

<TEXT>
<P>
The project will also kick off the full-range development of
the Yangtze's hydro-power resources. The experience drawn from its
construction and the revenues obtained from power generation may
turn the hydro-power resources of 200 million kw inherent in the
Yangtze valley into a real booster of the national economy, when a
chain of hydro-power stations spring up along the upper reaches of
the Yangtze.
</P>
<P>
As the leading waterway connecting the coastal and interior
areas, the Yangtze will become a deep-water navigation channel as
the Three Gorges Project is expected to submerge most of the
shoals on its upper reaches, enabling 10,000-ton vessels to sail
from coastal Shanghai all the way up to Chongqing, a newly-founded
municipality in southwestern China.
</P>
<P>
"In China's medium- and long-term economic growth strategy, the
Three Gorges will hold a position of immeasurable significance,"
stressed Li Boxi.
</P>
<P>
Located at the confluence of the Yangtze's upper and middle
reaches, the project will serve as an effective link for the
economic chain of coastal, central and the southwestern China.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, "its advantageous situation enables it to convey the
capital, technology and experiences in the coastal region to the
underdeveloped inland areas, thereby speeding up the area's
economic take-off," said Li.
</P>
<P>
Chen Xuanqing shared his view by saying that the Three Gorges
Project's decisive role in China's future growth strategy will
turn the Yangtze Valley -- the arrow on the bowstring -- into an
arrow ready to set off and effect an economy take-off.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Eritrean Minister of
Transport and Communications Saleh Idris Kekia has said transport
services at home and communications with outside world have made
significant headway since 1991.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest issue of English weekly "Eritrea
Profile" available here today, the remarks were made by the
Eritrean minister at a meeting in Asmara, capital of Eritrea
recently.
</P>
<P>
He said, a project aimed at rehabilitating the port of Massawa
and modernizing the port of Assab at a cost of about eight
million U.S. Dollars has already been prepared in cooperation
with the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
There are also plans to set up a container terminal in the
port of Assab, he added.
</P>
<P>
The work of placing light houses in Eritrean islands in a bid
to ensuring the safety of ships inside the Eritrean water
territory is being carried out and is expected to be completed by
the coming year, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to five airline companies operating in Eritrea, the
minister said, "although establishing our own airlines company
demands tremendous amount of money and great skill, we are trying
to work in shares with other foreign companies."
</P>
<P>
He said, various tasks aimed at developing air transport in
Eritrea and upgrading the Asmara International Airport are going
out well, adding that a new commercial airport that would
facilitate the process of making Massawa an economic zone is
being built there.
</P>
<P>
On the land transport in the country, the minister said the
number of buses rose from 260 to more than 1,300. "This changed
the service of public transportation, and today there is almost
no place in Eritrea where buses do not reach," he said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the progress in telecommunications, the minister
said the Eritrean Telecommunications Authority introduced a
digital system that enabled its clients to reach the outside
world directly.
</P>
<P>
"All of the Eritrean bigger towns will have a telephone line
that links them to each other and to the external world, and this
is expected to be completed by 2000," he added.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Liberalize Tea Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Kenya Tea Development
Authority (KTDA) has announced that its liberalization program is
on schedule in a bid to promote tea production of the country.
</P>
<P>
KTDA Managing Director Eustace Karanja said here Monday that
"liberalization means empowerment of the farmers to participate
in all important financial and operational decisions regarding
their factory companies," according to a Kenya Times report
today.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the authority is in the process of
completing administrative modalities to enable farmers to
effectively acquire ownership of their factories or companies
through allotment and purchase of share equity.
</P>
<P>
"This process will soon be completed and every grower will be
allotted shares under an already formulated procedure," Karanja
added.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the authority merely manages the companies and
provides necessary loans for establishment of new factories and
expansion of existing ones.
</P>
<P>
The KTDA will no longer determine and announce rates of
payments to tea farmers from next year.
</P>
<P>
He announced at a press conference that KTDA had released 5.6
billion Kenyan Shillings (about 90 million U.S. Dollars) as
second bonus payment to tea farmers in the country.
</P>
<P>
The managing director stated that the green leaf production
for the crop year 1996/97 dropped to 522,132 tons from 610,706
tons in previous year due to the drought suffered in major tea
producing areas.
</P>
<P>
The drop in production has been compensated by better prices
of tea owing to a more favorable exchange rate with the crop
year's annual average green leaf payment increasing to 15.32
Shillings per kilogram from 13.22 Shillings in previous crop
year.

lUSAKA, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Former Zambian president, now
the leader of the opposition United National Independence Party
(UNIP) Kenneth Kaunda will not return home until early December,
his son said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Times of Zambia today quoted Wezi Kaunda as saying that his

<P>
He said his father was not fleeing from the October 28

"Dr Kaunda's trip abroad has nothing to do with the situation
at home. In fact these invitations have been long standing dating
as far back as a month ago," he said.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview from Zimbabwean capital Harare
Monday, Kaunda told the post that he has numerous commitments
between now and December and will only be free to return home in
the first week of December.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda told the Zambian newspaper, the Post, that "tell the
MMD (the ruling Movement for Multi-Party Democracy) that they now
know when i am coming back, if they want to arrest me, they can
do so when i return."
</P>
<P>
Kaunda, who went to Lesotho a few days before the coup to have
attended the coronation of King Letsie iii on October 31, will
hold lectures at a number of universities in London.
</P>
<P>
He will also attend a Gandhi conference in Bombay and another

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Urges Iraq to Rescind Ban on Americans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait has urged Iraq to
back down from its ban on U.S. citizens in the United Nations
weapons inspection team, local newspapers and radios reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Making the call, Kuwaiti Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign
Minister Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah was also quoted
as saying that the Kuwaiti armed forces are on alert to ward off
what might result from the current Iraq-U.S. standoff.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that the current crisis will not develop into
a full confrontation between Iraq and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sabah also called on Iraq "to comply with and implement all
the U.N. Security Council resolutions and stop challenging the
international community."
</P>
<P>
Iraq last Wednesday decided to turn back the 10 U.S. inspectors
working with the U.N. Special Commission for eliminating Iraq's
mass destructive weapons, and has refused twice the entry of three
U.S. inspectors on the following days.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. called Iraq's decision "unacceptable" and said all
options are open to force Iraq to back away.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's ban on U.S. inspectors was announced after the
U.N. Security Council, in a U.S.-led campaign, passed a resolution
to threaten more sanctions to press for Iraq's cooperation with
U.N. inspectors. Indefinite sanctions were imposed seven years
ago after the Gulf War triggered off by Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait.

KUWAIT CITY, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait still has not taken
an official stand as to whether to take part in the controversial
Middle East and North Africa (MENA) economic conference scheduled
to be held in Doha, Qatar on November 16-18.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Sheikh

that "the government of Kuwait has not yet responded to the
invitation it has received from the Qatari government."
</P>
<P>
"We have received an invitation to attend, but we have not
replied so far," he said.

<P>
The Qatari ambassador in Kuwait delivered Sunday to Sheikh
Sabah an official invitation from Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh

<P>
Kuwait's Chamber of Commerce and Industry announced Saturday
that it would officially boycott the economic conference although
all Kuwaiti businessmen could attend the meeting as individuals.
</P>
<P>
The chamber's announcement was made three days after Saudi
Arabian Chamber of Commerce and Industry made a similar decision
to boycott the conference by all Saudi private sector
businessmen.

helping to lead displaced local farmers in the Three Gorges
Reservoir area onto a road for better life.

<P>
The first group of some 24,000 peasant farmers, who used to

under construction at the Three Gorges Project, have found their
new homes and been provided with the means of subsistence thanks
to the relocation programs.

<P>
These programs include the increase in farming productivity
in the resettled areas by transforming cropland with low and
relatively-low yields, building stable high-high yielding plots
and going all out to develop forestry, animal husbandry, sideline
occupation and fisheries, to accommodate the displaced farmers.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, new businesses have been established in the
displacement areas, providing additional jobs for some of the
displaced farmers.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Sanyo Securities Goes Bankrupt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Japan's Sanyo Securities Co.,
plagued by massive bad loans, declared insolvent Monday when it
sought to reorganize itself under the country's law, press reports
here said today.
</P>
<P>
The second-tier brokerage, with 373.6 billion yen (about 3.1
billion U.S. dollars) worth of uncollectible debts incurred by
affiliated non-bank financial institutions, became the first listed
brokerage house to file for reorganization under the Corporate
Rehabilitation Law.
</P>
<P>
The action, filed with the Tokyo District Court, was tantamount
to a declaration of bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
The brokerage house decided Monday to suspend some operations,
Sanyo Securities President Takashi Ikeuchi told a press conference
later in the day.
</P>
<P>
Ikeuchi also said that all 21 of the company's top executives
submitted their letters of resignation to take responsibility for
the failure.
</P>
<P>
The Tokyo District Court, which now has full control of the
brokerage house's assets, approved special treatment of clients'
assests to ensure their complete protection.
</P>
<P>
Under this allowance, Sanyo's clients will be free to withdraw
money from their accounts with the brokerage.
</P>
<P>
Sanyo said it took the action because its regular business
operations would be jeopardized by its decision to take legal
steps to liquidate its troubled non-bank affiliates.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Sanyo failed to meet a deadline for its repayment of
loans totaling 20 billion yen (about 167 million dollars) from
Nippon Life Insurance Co. and eight other life insurance firms.
</P>
<P>
The brokerage house requested a deferment of the repayment in a
effort to improve its financial situation, but it had to abandon
its plan after the life insurance firms rejected the request.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the brokerage's crash, Koji Omi, Director General
of Japan's Economic Planning Agency (EPA) said today that he is
worried that the collapse of Sanyo Securities Co. will hurt the
country's economy.
</P>
<P>
"The issue of Sanyo Securities will have some psychologically
negative effects on the economy," the EPA head said.

<HEADLINE> Trade Zone to Benefit as Harbour Develops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai Waigaoqiao Free
Trade Zone Development Co., Ltd. will benefit from the
construction of an adjacent container port.
</P>
<P>
The company, the sole developer of the zone, will take
advantage of the port's expansion to build warehouses on its newly
acquired land of 1.7 square kilometers for companies using the
port to lease, company chairman Ruan Yanhua said.
</P>
<P>
The company, which has listed both A and B shares on the
Shanghai Stock Exchange, plans an allotment within the year to
raise funds for developing the land, Ruan said.
</P>
<P>
The Waigaoqiao port is one of the seven container ports in
Shanghai and the port is expanding its handling capacity from the
current 500,000 tons per year to 1.4 million tons per year, which
prompted Ruan's company to use the opportunity to enlarge its
warehouse area.
</P>
<P>
With the new construction, the company's warehouse rents should
increase rapidly, Ruan said.
</P>
<P>
The Waigaoqiao Free Trade Zone, a major part of the formative
Pudong New Area, is China's first trade zone.
</P>
<P>
Its strong infrastructure facilities, including a deep water
port, electric power station and high-standard processing plants
and warehouses, have attracted some 3.7 billion U.S.dollars in
investment, including over 2.5 billion U.S.dollars from foreign
firms.

<HEADLINE> Coca Cola to Make Huge Investment in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The world's leading soft drink
manufacturer Coca Cola company is planning to make
multi-million-U.S.-dollar new investment in Bangladesh to tap the
untapped opportunities in soft drink market and to demonstrate its
confidence in the country's economic prospects.
</P>
<P>
According to the company's Southeast and West Asia Division
President Andrew Angle, the Coca Cola products are leading the
market in Bangladesh with a 56 percent share of carbonated soft
drink sales. But per capita consumption of Coca Cola products in
the country is only two (bottles) compared with three times more
in neighboring India and Pakistan and 105 times more in the
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Additional multi-million-dollar investment would be made for
the expansion of infrastructure and distribution system of the
company which had long-time presence in this South Asian country,
Angle said.
</P>
<P>
"Here in Bangladesh, a growing economy and rapidly changing
soft drink market offers numerous untapped opportunities," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The Coca Cola company started its operations in Bangladesh in
1962. There are now three production facilities, which are
respectively located in the capital Dhaka, the second largest city
of Chittagong, and Comilla.

<HEADLINE> Thailand, Malaysia to Hold Talks on Gas Price </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Thailand and Malaysia will hold
talks later this week over the impact of the current regional
currency crisis on the price of gas to be produced from the two
countries' joint development area (JDA), Thai Industry Ministry
sources said.
</P>
<P>
Sivavong Cangkasiri, former permanent secretary of the Thai
Industry Ministry and co-chairman of the Malaysia-Thailand Joint
Authority will meet with his Malaysian counterpart in Malaysia to
discuss the impact of currency devaluation on the agreed-upon
price for JDA gas, a local newspaper today quoted a senior
official of the Industry Ministry as saying.
</P>
<P>
The official said that although Thailand and Malaysia agreed in
late September on a price of JDA gas at 2.3 U.S. dollars for one
million British thermal units, the recent turmoil in Southeast
Asian currencies required the two parties to review the contract
to prevent a possible dispute in the future, as the Thai baht has
depreciated differently from the Malaysian ringgit.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysia-Thailand Joint Authority is a statutory body set
up in 1990 by the two governments to govern the exploration and
production of petroleum resources in the JDA.
</P>
<P>
Estimated to have a gas reserve of over 10,000 billion cubic
feet, the JDA fields are expected to turn out at least 600 million
cubic feet of gas per day by the year 2000.

NEW DELHI, November 4 (Xinhua) -- India will provide licenses

The Income Bank of Russia (IBR), which has already opened its

Russian commercial bank has also been cleared to open its office

</P>
<P>
Both India and Russia have decided to improve their banking
arrangements to bolster bilateral trade, as insufficient banking
facilities are considered to be a major obstacle standing in the
way of development of the two countries' economic relations, the
same official said.
</P>
<P>
In return, Russia has agreed to provide licenses to two Indian
banks for opening their subsidiaries in Moscow.

<HEADLINE> Italian Government Heads off Pension Rush </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The Italian government today moved
quickly to head off an expected wave of pension applications by
those eager to retire before a pension reform program kicks off.
</P>
<P>
Issuing an emergency decree, the government froze all new
pension demands until the reform goes into effect with the passage
of next year's budget bill through the country's parliament.
</P>
<P>
However, the freeze, which applies to both private and public
sectors, will not affect pension requests made before today.
</P>
<P>
The 1998 budget, due to be approved by the end of the year,
includes 4.1 trillion lire, equivalent to about 2.3 billion
U.S. dollars, of spending cuts in the national pension system.
</P>
<P>
An agreement was reached between the government and trade
unions on Saturday after five months of talks.
</P>
<P>
The document raises the minimum retirement age in the private
sector from 53 to 54 next year, provided the worker has 35 years
of service. It will then gradually be raised to 57.
</P>
<P>
Blue-collar workers are exempted from the changes under an
agreement with the Communist Refoundation party.
</P>
<P>
The deal will also bring public and private sectors into line
by 2004, eliminating many public-sector perks, and will freeze
30,000 early-retirement applications by teachers until 1999.
</P>
<P>
Crucial for improving Italy's fiscal performance, savings from
the plan are expected to help secure its qualification for entry
into the European Monetary Union (EMU) slated for 1999.

<P>
MOSCOW, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Ministry of Energy
would like to cooperate with Japan in the development of fast
neutron reactor technology, ministry spokesman Kaurov said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Japanese Prime Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto agreed during a meeting in Krasnoyarsk on
November 1-2 to cooperate in the nuclear sector.
</P>
<P>
Kaurov said the fast neutron reactor, a technology which Japan
has not grasped yet, represents the best direction for the
development of nuclear power in Japan.
</P>
<P>
Russia suggests that Japan arrange financing for a BN-800 new
motor unit for a neutron reactor. In return, Russian would
transfer its fast neutron reaction technology, which has a good
reputation for safety.
</P>
<P>
Russia is considering setting up the motor units at nuclear
power plants located in Beloyarsk or the Yuzhny Ural.
</P>
<P>
Although Japan has advanced the nuclear power industry, the
supply for its nuclear fuels is monopolized by the United
States. Russia also wants to become a supplier of nuclear fuels to
Japan.

Customers of the closed banks in other cities also went to

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Rupiah Rises on Intervention, Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian rupiah rose 8
percent against the U.S. dollar in hectic trading Monday due to
what many believe as positive reaction to wide-ranging economic
reforms announced by the government and joint intervention by
foreign central banks.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah surged to a high of 3,240 against the greenback
before closing at 3,270/3,300, compared with an opening of
3,540/3,555, dealers said today.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Finance Mar'ie Muhammad said Monday in a statement
that there was a concerted effort by Bank Indonesia, the central
bank, and Singapore and Japanese central banks to support the
rupiah.
</P>
<P>
However, he did not say what form of intervention was taken by
the three banks.
</P>
<P>
"The concerted effort was aimed at strengthening the rupiah to
levels more appropriate with the fundamentals of the Indonesian
economy," Mar'ie said.
</P>
<P>
He said the joint effort would contribute positively to the
implementation of the reform package announced by the Indonesian
government recently.
</P>
<P>
Under the reform package, the government will further trim its
budget spending, abolish monopolies in several food commodities
and liquidate insolvent banks.
</P>
<P>
The package had gained support from the International Monetary
Fund (IMF), the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank. The IMF
has agreed to provide 23 billion U.S. dollars in financial and
technical aid to Indonesia to cope with its monetary crisis.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah has dropped by about 50 percent against the U.S.
dollar since the beginning of this year. It was badly hit by the
monetary crisis in Southeast Asia.

<HEADLINE> Hungary to Promote Sino-Hungarian Ties: Speaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Hungary is willing to promote
the Sino-Hungarian relations on the basis of equality and mutual
benefit, President of Hungarian National Assembly Gal Zoltan said
here today.
</P>
<P>
The Speaker made the remarks when meeting with Zhu Liang,
chairman of Foreign Affairs Committee of National People's
Congress (NPC) of China, who headed a NPC delegation paying a
visit to the Eastern European country.
</P>
<P>
Gal said that China is one of the powers which can play a
decisive role to the world's politics, and a stable China plays an
important role in maintaining the world's stability. He hoped that
China will continue to go along her own developing way in the
future.
</P>
<P>
Everything is ready for deepening the bilateral ties since
Hungarian delegations from various political parties visited China
recently, Gal said. He added that the Hungarians who have been to
China have learned to know that China is a big country with its
distinctive history and traditions.
</P>
<P>
Hungary and China should further increase the exchange of
friendly visits and get a deeper mutual understanding, Gal said,
hoping that the two parliaments should play a greater role in the
future cooperation between them.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting Zhu Liang reviewed the bilateral ties after
Gal visited China in last May and briefed the hosts about the
political and economic situation in China as well as China's
foreign policy. He believed that with joint efforts, both
countries will achieve a sound development of their economic
relations.
</P>
<P>
The NPC delegation, which arrived here on October 30, will
leave for Greece on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Urumqi Residents Breathe Clean Air </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The switch from the use of coal
to natural gas has enabled more than one million people in Urumqi,
the capital of northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region,
to breathe cleaner air.
</P>
<P>
The switch, which ended the city's long history of burning
coal, is regarded as a great contribution to improving the living
standards of local residents and improving the urban environment.
</P>
<P>
Urumqi means "beautiful pastureland" in the Mongolian
language. However, the city was subject to serious air pollution
for an extended period due to the use of coal, combined with
unique local geological and climatic conditions.
</P>
<P>
The city government launched a major gas supply project to
improve the urban environment, with the effort centering on the
building of a 300 kilo meter pipe-line linking the city with
Turpan-Hami Oil Field.
</P>
<P>
The project, completed at a cost of 480 million yuan (60
million US dollars), provides 600 million cu.m. of gas annually
and easily fulfills the local demand for gas.
</P>
<P>
The Turpan-Hami Basin, located in the eastern part of Xinjiang,
has over 26 billion cu.m. of proven gas reserves. Urumqi has a
population of 1.4 million.

<HEADLINE> Budgetary Funding Short of Educational Needs in Venezuela </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela's budgetary funding
for education will be about 1.79 billion U.S. dollars short of the
sector's needs in 1998, a congressional group has said.
</P>
<P>
The educational sector needs an equivalent of 5.56 billion
dollars to keep the system running, said a sub-committee of the
Chamber of Deputies, or the lower house of the National Congress.
</P>
<P>
However, the sub-committee on education, science and technology
and culture financing noted, the 1998 budget bill proposed by the
government allows only 3.77 billion dollars for education programs.
</P>
<P>
Although the appropriation, if granted, appears to be 15.6
percent more than 1997, the increase is likely to be written off
by inflation, said Rodrigo Cabezas, the sub-committee's chairman.
</P>
<P>
What makes it worse, Cabezas said, is that the education
system's deficit this year will be transferred into next year.

<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Trade between Romania and
Russia has declined markedly since the disintegration of the
Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (COMECON), a Russian trade
representative in Romania told Rompres today.
</P>
<P>
Mark Abarsalin, Russian trade representative in the Russian
embassy in Bucharest, said bilateral trade between the two
countries dropped to 1.6 billion U.S. dollars last year from 5
billion in 1989.
</P>
<P>
In the economic and trade exchanges between the two countries,
Romania exported only 200 million U.S. dollars in goods to Russia
last year, while imports from Russia were 1.4 billion, 90 percent
of which was material, natural gas and crude oil, Abarsalin said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that other East European countries exported to
Russia much more than Romania, although Romania is the only
country that enjoys a 25 percent taxation remit in its export to
Russia.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai, China's largest
metropolitan area, hosted over 1.2 million foreign tourists in the
first nine months of this year, a year-on-year rise of 18.4
percent, with earnings growing by 16.6 percent to 980 million US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Over 50 million Chinese tourists visited the city during the
period, a level equal to the total for 1996, with related earnings
hitting a record 40 billion yuan (4.819 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Municipal tourism officials attributed the success, at least in
part, to improved coordination between tourism, transportation,
commerce, cultural and other relevant departments.
</P>
<P>
Early this year, Shanghai called for all concerned sectors to
engage in a concerted effort to improve the efficiency of tourism.
</P>
<P>
Said efforts included the addition of new air routes and
tourist trains, according to municipal officials.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai offers regularly scheduled air flights to 88 Chinese
and foreign cities and has opened special train routes to major
tourist areas such as Suzhou, Hangzhou, Wuxi, Nanjing and Mount
Huangshan.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation between cultural and commercial departments have
led to the establishment of a series of tourism festivals
featuring films, the tea culture, local fruit and trade,
attracting an ever increasing number of tourists.
</P>
<P>
The efforts have led to the creation of new tourism programs
related to sports, exhibitions, and tours of major industrial

<HEADLINE> Three Gorges Project:A Dream of the Chinese Nation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANDOUPING (Three Gorges), November 4 (Xinhua) -- The Yangtze
is to be blocked this Saturday, signaling the completion of the
first stage of the gigantic Three Gorges Project. The project has
been a dream long cherished by the Chinese nation almost for a
century.
</P>
<P>
In the 1910s, Dr. Sun Yat-sen, forerunner of the Chinese
democratic revolution, became the first to propose the
construction of a gigantic water control project around the Three
Gorges in the middle reaches of the Yangtze, China's largest
river.
</P>
<P>
A major flood occurred on the Yangtze once every decade during
the two millenia from the Han Dynasty (206 BC-AD 220) to the end
of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), and two catastrophic floods in the
thirties of this century alone claimed 300,000 lives along the
river.
</P>
<P>
Upon the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949,
the first generation of New China's leaders headed by Mao Zedong
started to draw up a blueprint for the project.
</P>
<P>
After four decades of investigations, planning and debate,
the Three Gorges Project was finally approved by the National
People's Congress -- the Chinese parliament - in 1992.
</P>
<P>
As the world's top water control scheme, it is projected to
cost some 25 billion US dollars. The investment is estimated to
account for less than one thousandth of the cumulative GDP during
the 17 years of construction, thanks to enhanced national strength
in the wake of China's reform and opening-up policies adopted 18
years ago.
</P>
<P>
A series of knotty problems are involved in the project: the
amount of work of the project is the largest in the world, the
technologies to be used in the project are complex and the 1.2
million people to be relocated in the project area are
unprecedented.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the project has been focused on a market
mechanism and international conventional practices. After five
years of its initiation, the first stage of the project is
completed ahead of schedule, construction quality has complied
with the pre-designed standards, and the actual investment is four
billion yuan less than the initial projected budget.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, a development-oriented resettlement program has
helped the displaced farmers to become the first to be better-off
in the Three Gorges area. By now more than 60,000 farmers have
been resettled.
</P>
<P>
The Three Gorges Fund, a major source for the massive
investment in the project, is based on an appropriate price
increase in power charges across the country. From 1993-1997, the
fund collected a total of 13.7 billion yuan, equivalent to an
average of 11 yuan contributed by every Chinese.
</P>
<P>
The dream of the Three Gorges Project represent the Chinese
people's aspiration for building a stronger China.
</P>
<P>
Upon its completion in 12 years, the project will bring huge
benefit to the nation by putting an end to floods in the middle
and lower reaches of the Yangtze, relieving 15 million people of
the scourge of flood, and providing an average of additional 70 kw
of electricity for each Chinese every year.

SANTIAGO, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Chile's domestic and foreign
sales of manufactured products enjoyed a 13.3 percent increase so
far this year, said the Industry Fostering Society today.
</P>
<P>
The boost, the society said, contributed to an accumulated rise
of 5.9 percent in total industrial sales.
</P>
<P>
The export surge in September fueled the country's
manufacturing sectors, especially those of fish meal, cellulose
and metal, which propped up 160 percent in value.
</P>
<P>
The home market grew by 7.6 percent in September, against the
same month of 1996; and by 4.1 percent in the first nine months of
the year, with respect to the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
While the manufacturing sectors' output soared 8 percent in
September, the Chile's overall industrial output gained 4.3
percent in the year's first nine months, the society said.

<HEADLINE> Aviation Sector Turns to Home Mart for Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese civil aviation
companies are turning now to the domestic capital market to fund
their stout growth, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
China Eastern Airlines, the country's first A share in the
civil aviation sector, will make its debut tomorrow in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai-based company issued 300 million domestic A shares
last month at 2.45 yuan (about 0.3 U.S.dollars) each.
</P>
<P>
Hainan Airlines has decided to issue 17.53 million A shares
before the end of this year and Air China, the country's largest
aviation company, will also go public both at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
It is reported Shenzhen Airport and Hongqiao Airport are
considering going public domestically.
</P>
<P>
Experts said many aviation companies have high
assets-to-liability ratios and going public is an effective way to
level off the ratio.
</P>
<P>
The Civil Aviation Administration of China is exploring various
domestic fund-raising channels to pool funds to meet the surging
capital demand aroused by the industry's robust growth.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the A-share market, corporate bonds,
construction bonds and convertible bonds are also under
consideration.
</P>
<P>
Officials with the sector said enterprises in the industry will
conduct direct fund-raising, such as the issue of shares and
bonds, more frequently while reducing indirect fund-raising
activities, including using bank loans and leasing.
</P>
<P>
The civil aviation sector is set to maintain a 15 percent
annual growth rate and a total of 100 billion yuan (about 12
billion U.S. dollars) will be invested to improve infrastructure
and build about 40 airports.

<HEADLINE> US to Grant Legal Protection to Visiting Filipino </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines and the United
States have concluded an agreement granting Filipino troops legal
protection while conducting military exercises in American
territory.
</P>
<P>
The Legal Framework for Filipino Personnel Temporarily Visiting
the U.S. under the Mutual Defense Treaty was part of a package for
the early conclusion of a new Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA)
between the two countries, local newspaper Manila Standard
reported today.
</P>
<P>
"There is already a legal framework (for the protection of
visiting Filipino troops)," the report quoted Philippine Foreign
Secretary Domingo Siazon as saying.
</P>
<P>
Siazon said the just-concluded agreement was formulated as an
executive order so as not to require ratification by the U.S.
Senate.
</P>
<P>
Manila and Washington are trying to wrap up a new SOFA, which
will facilitate the conduct of joint exercises between Filipino
and American military personnel, to improve Philippine-U.S.
military relations.
</P>
<P>
The country's previous SOFA with the U.S. was based on the
Military Bases Agreement, which the Philippine Senate scrapped in
1991.
</P>
<P>
However, Siazon declined to comment on the details of the
agreement, saying only it "will be signed simultaneously (with the
new SOFA)."
</P>
<P>
"We have already agreed to giving limited immunity to Filipino
troops going there (United States)," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines proposed early in the negotiations that
Filipino troops be granted the same privileges their American
counterparts enjoy while conducting military exercises in the
Philippines, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. panel shot down the proposal and came up with the
just-concluded agreement, which is similar to the one Washington
has with Israel, providing for the legal protection of Filipino
troops visiting the U.S. for military exercises.
</P>
<P>
Previously, reciprocity and jurisdiction over cases committed
by American soldiers while in the Philippines for military
exercises were two major issues during the SOFA negotiations.

<HEADLINE> One-third of China's Farmland to Use Water-Saving Irrigation Methods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Water-saving irrigation, deemed
a fundamental way out of China's drought problem, is expected to
be adopted for use on one-third of the country's farmland next
year.
</P>
<P>
Today's China Daily announced the ambitious plan by quoting
Vice-Minister of Water Resources Zhang Chunyuan.
</P>

Next year, he said, water-saving irrigation systems operating
through a pipeline network and other practical measures, such as
protection against serious leaking from ditches, will be
introduced into 16.3 million hectares that grow grain and cotton.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that 10 billion cubic meters of water will be
saved next year and 10 billion more kilograms of grain will be
produced when the entire plan is completed.
</P>
<P>
It means that by the end of next year, experts say water-saving
irrigation systems will be applied to more than 35 million
hectares, more than one-third of China's farmland. China has about
100 million hectares of farmland, though the State's latest survey
indicated the figure is more than 120 million hectares but has not
been verified by land authorities.
</P>
<P>
Eleven billion yuan ($1.3 billion) has been poured into the
program, of which about one-third of the investment came from bank
loans approved by the State with lower interest rates as financing
subsidies, 25 percent were from local governments and the rest
raised by famers.
</P>
<P>
Zhang quoted climate forecasts as saying farms will face
serious water shortages through this winter and next spring
because less precipitation is expected.

<HEADLINE> Beverage Hygiene Up; Tableware Still Unsatisfying </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The quality of soft drinks sold
in the Chinese market has greatly improved, but the hygiene of the
tableware in public eating places is not so satisfying, a national
inspection indicated.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Health announced the results of the inspection
yesterday to start a week-long promotion for the Food Hygiene Law,
which went into effect in October 1995.
</P>
<P>
Three varieties of soft drinks, tableware detergents,
disinfectants and also the hygiene of tableware at eating places
were inspected in the past two months.
</P>
<P>
The results indicated that 98.2 percent of the drinks
containing lactic acid, 98 percent of the carbonic acid drinks and
84.5 percent of the plant protein drinks meet the national
standard.
</P>
<P>
Bacteria contamination and insufficient protein are major
factors that affected the quality of soft drinks, said Kan Xuegui,
department director in charge of health inspection for the
Ministry of Health.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1,632 restaurants and roadside food stands were
inspected, and only 44.4 percent satisfied the State requirement
on tableware disinfection.
</P>
<P>
About 68 percent of the tableware inspected met the national
standard after disinfection. Of the tableware detergents
inspected, 92.1 percent met the standard.
</P>
<P>
All the units and individuals that failed to meet the national
standards have been handled by local health departments in line
with the Food Hygiene Law, Kan said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that local health departments should step up
inspections at roadside food stands and, in the meantime, increase
publicity and education to ensure good public health.

<TEXT>
<P>
SANDOUPING (Three Gorges), November 4 (Xinhua) -- The Three
Gorges Hydroelectric Power Station will be China's largest
hydroelectric power plant.
</P>
<P>
Its generating capacity will be 18.2 million kilowatts, with a
yearly power output of 84.7 billion kwh, equivalent to burning 50
million tons of coal or 25 million tons of crude oil.
</P>
<P>
When compared to coal-burning facilities of a similar size, the
Three Gorges Plant can cut a large amount of carbon dioxide, one
to two million tons of sulphuric dioxide, 10,000 tons of carbon
monoxide, and 150,000 tons of dust.
</P>
<P>
Project loans will be fully prepaid by the power generated. In
the year 2003, 11 years of the formal launching of the Three
Gorges Project, the first generations are scheduled for use. Four
generators with a combined capacity of 2.8 million kw will be
operational every year after.
</P>
<P>
Upon completion in the year 2009, the project will be able to
generate a total of 293 billion kwh during the period of
construction. Therefore, the project can repay all loans and
interests two to three years after going into full operation.
</P>
<P>
The hydroelectric power generated is to be used in eastern and
central China regions and the eastern part of southwest China's
Sichuan province. If one figures that every kwh can result in six
yuan in output value, the project may generate 520 billion yuan in
industrial output value every year and create additional millions
of job opportunities.

<HEADLINE> Private Firms Can Help State's Restructuring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 4 (Xinhua) -- China's private firms should
play a role in the State sector's restructuring, today's China
Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
Jing Shuping, chairman of All-China Federation of Industry and
Commerce (ACFIC), said non-State firms could participate in the
State companies' reorganization in various ways, which include
running them under contract, leasing them or establishing joint
ventures or shareholding co-operative firms with them.
</P>
<P>
Jing said at ACFIC's Eighth Congress, which opened yesterday in
Beijing, that China's private sector, which was upgraded from "a
supplemental part of the national economy" to "a significant
constituent of the national economy" in the country's economic
theory during the 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of
China, is facing an unprecedented development opportunity.
</P>
<P>
"For the first time, the private sector is taken into the
country's economic system," he said.
</P>
<P>
Jing said that labour-extensive enterprises in the private
sector should try to create more jobs for laid-off workers to ease
the employment pressure from the reshuffle of the State firms.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he encouraged the private business people to step
into technology-intensive business and establish themselves in the
world market.
</P>
<P>
He urged private business people to pay special attention to
agriculture, saying they should contribute to the
industrialization of the country's agriculture by investing more
money and enlisting advanced technology and management techniques
to develop the field.
</P>
<P>
Citing the private firms' average registered capital of 500,000
yuan (60,000 U.S. dollars) and 14 employees each, Jing said most
of the private companies are still weak. Their management
philosophies are generally out of date, he said.

<HEADLINE> One-third of China's Farmland To Use Water-saving Methods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Water-saving irrigation, deemed
a fundamental way out of China's drought problem, is expected to
be adopted for use on one-third of the country's farmland next
year, China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Minister of Water Resources Zhang Chunyun announced such
an ambitious plan yesterday at a national working conference on
water-saving irrigation.
</P>
<P>
Next year, Zhang said, water-saving irrigation systems
operating through a pipeline network and other practical measures,
such as protection against serious leaking from ditches, will be
introduced into 16.3 million hectares that grow grain and cotton.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that 10 billion cubic metres of water will be
saved next year and 10 billion more kilograms of grain will be
produced when the entire plan is completed.
</P>
<P>
It means that by the end of next year, experts say water-saving
irrigation systems will be applied to more than 35 million
hectares, more than one-third of China's farmland.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, water-saving irrigation methods, including
modern spray and drip irrigation techniques, and various practical
seepage-proof measures used in open-cut trenches built decades ago
have been applied to 19 million hectares across 300
drought-stricken countries in North China.
</P>
<P>
Eleven billion yuan (1.3 billion U.S. dollars) has been poured
into the programme, of which about one-third of the investment
came from the bank loans approved by the State with lower interest
rates as financing subsidies, 25 percent were from local
governments and the rest raised by rural residents.

Zhang quoted climate forecasts as saying farms will face
serious water shortages through this winter and next spring

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Central Bank is
planning to reduce lending rates following an across-the-board
drop in the yields of Treasury Bills (T-bills) on Monday's auction
by the Bureau of Treasury.
</P>
<P>
During Monday's weekly T-bills auction, yields for the
benchmark 91-day bills plunged by 86.3 basis points to 16.341
percent from last week's 17.204 percent.
</P>
<P>
Central Bank Governor Gabriel Singson was quoted by local
newspaper Manila Bulletin as saying that he would recommend to the
Monetary Board, the policy-making body of the bank, corresponding
reduction in its overnight repurchase paper when it meets
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The central bank charges about 16.125 percent on its overnight
lending rate and 12 percent on its borrowing rate.
</P>
<P>
Singson indicated that he would also recommend "corresponding
adjustments" in the yields of other lending instruments such as
the three-month reverse repurchase papers which now stand at
16.125 percent.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the Monetary Board may ease up the stringent
conditions attached to the central bank's lending facility on
condition that the money lent out would not be used by banks for
speculation in foreign exchange market, Singson said.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: Charm of Three Gorges to Remain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANDOUPING (Three Gorges), November 4 (Xinhua) -- The Three
Gorges, one of the world's most famous scenic sites around Qutang,
Wuxian and Xiling, features breathtaking scenery which attracts
hundreds of thousands of tourists from at home and abroad each and
every year.
</P>
<P>
The charming scenery will be left untouched following the
damming of the mid-section of the Xiling Gorge.
</P>
<P>
The high-water mark once the dam is completed will stand at
82.8 meters, or four meters higher than before.
</P>
<P>
However, the rise in the water level will have little impact on
scenery in the Three Gorges which sit at an elevation of some
1,000 meters above sea level. The charm of the famous landmark
will remain unchanged the year 2009 when the high-water mark will
rise by some 100 meters.
</P>
<P>
A spectacular waterfall formed by the steep incline of the
Three Gorges dike will offer a new site expected to attract an
incessant stream of tourists. Scenic landscapes, including Badong
Shennong Stream, the Gezi River Stone Forest and the Shuangxi
Karst Caves are either under construction or will be built in the
near future.

<HEADLINE> d p s 1271 China-Three Gorges-Backgrounder-11 Backgrounder: Three Gorges Reservoir Inundation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANDOUPING (Three Gorges), November 4 (Xinhua) -- The Three
Gorges Reservoir will inundate 632 sq. km., the world's largest
inundated area by a single project.
</P>
<P>
The normal water level of 175 meters will be achieved in the
year 2003, with the reservoir covering 1,045 sq.km. and stretching
some 663 km, an area capable of controlling floods expected to
occur twice in one decade.
</P>
<P>
The resettlement effort and the area to be inundated are
unprecedented in Chinese history, with inundation affecting 365
townships in 21 counties, cities or districts in Sichuan and
Hubei provinces.
</P>
<P>
Some 844,000 people are scheduled for resettlement, with
unforeseen factors most likely raising the figure to 1.2 million
people.
</P>
<P>
The Three Gorges Reservoir will inundated 31,000 hectares of
farmland, and will require the relocation of 1,599 industrial and
mining enterprises, as well as power transmission and
telecommunications facilities, harbors, small and medium-sized
hydro-electric power plants, roads and pumping stations.
</P>
<P>
The new reservoir, typical of facilities in gorges, will not
have a so-called "big-belly" section similar to other facilities
built on lakes.

<HEADLINE> d p s 2191 China-Three Gorges-Backgrounder-12 Backgrounder: Three Gorges Guidelines to Resettlement (12) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANDOUPING (Three Gorges), November 4 (Xinhua) -- The key to
success of the Three Gorges Project rests with resettling more
than one million people living in areas scheduled for inundation.
Project developers have committed themselves to ensuring people
involved in the resettlement effort will have a better standard of
living.
</P>
<P>
The State Council's Resettlement Regulations on the Three
Gorges Project stipulate that "the state adheres to a guideline
of resettling people in the process of development. Relevant
local governments are responsible for resettlement, while the
allocation of resettlement funds and rational development of
resources give full play to the combined advantages of
agriculture, industry and commerce, with emphasis on the former.
Multiple channels will be used to resettle migrants in different
sectors and various means will be adopted to ensure their living
standards. Resettlement should create conditions enabling people
who have been resettled to develop local economies and have a
better life in the long-term."
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the number of people scheduled for
resettlement could surpass more than one million over a 17 year
period. The trans-century work is scheduled for completion in 2009
with an estimated static investment of 40 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The central government has granted a number of preferential
policies in this regard to ensure smooth operations, including the
establishment of an economic zone in the project area, and the
opening of Yichang, Wanxian and Fuling cities which have the
status of coastal open cities, as well as the integration of less
developed and developed regions across the country. The state is
committed to allocating some 500 million yuan annually to help
enterprises build new facilities and develop marketable products.
</P>
<P>
China has carried out trial resettlement programs since 1985,
with the latest effort commencing in 1993. Local governments have
allocated 8.58 billion yuan for the resettlement effort, with the
65,000 people resettled by October 1997, fulfilling proposed
targets.

DALIAN, November 4 (Xinhua) -- A constantly increasing number
of foreign investors have tasted success after investing in the
fisheries sector in Dalian, a major coastal city in northeast
China's Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
The city had approved over 1,600 foreign-funded rural
enterprises in the sector by the end of last year, with total
foreign investments standing at 1.5 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Related ventures recorded a total export volume of over 12
billion yuan in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Local planting and breeding sectors have attracted increasing
foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
Export-oriented enterprises currently contribute 60 percent of
local foreign exchange earnings from agricultural exports.
</P>
<P>
The achievements can be attributed to favorable geographical
conditions, as well as the introduction of a series of policies
designed to encourage the use of overseas funding for the
development of local agriculture and fisheries.
</P>
<P>
The city is currently home to over 6,000 foreign-funded
enterprises, involving foreign funds of over 10 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The city's four major economic zones focus on forestry, fruit
orchards, animal husbandry, grain production, fisheries, nonstaple
foodstuffs and vegetables. These zones have greatly promoted the

WASHINGTON, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Los Angeles star Shaquille
O'Neal was suspended for one game and fined 10,000 U.S. dollars
Monday for hitting Utah center Greg Ostertag last week between
practice sessions.
</P>
<P>
The suspension means O'Neal will miss Tuesday night's game at
Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Monday, O'Neal included his own Los Angeles Lakers
in a written apology to Ostertag and admitted he had failed to set
a good example for young people.
</P>
<P>
An open-hand slap by O'Neal sent Ostertag to the floor near the
basketball court at the Forum in Inglewood on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Ostertag was not hurt, and went on to play that night but
scored only two points in the Jazz's 104-87 loss to the Lakers.

<HEADLINE> White House Reiterates Support for Affirmative Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The White House said Monday
affirmative action needs to be kept as a corrective tool against
discrimination and racism despite a Supreme Court decision that
rejects challenge to California affirmative action ban.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court today let stand California's Proposition 209,
which bans affirmative action for minorities and women by any
level of state or city government. A coalition of civil rights
groups had asked the court to hear arguments they hoped would
overturn the California law, but the justices rejected that move.
</P>
<P>
At today's press briefing White House spokesman Mike McCurry
reiterated Clinton's support for affirmative action programs,
saying the administration's views of Prop 209 are well known and
articulated by the president.
</P>
<P>
McCurry said Clinton "has very clearly stated, over and over
again, that we need to keep that as a corrective tool to protect
Americans who have suffered injustice, discrimination and even the
residue of racism."

<HEADLINE> US Personal Incomes Gain Moderately in September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The personal incomes in the
U.S. increased moderately and the spending also moderated in
September, the U.S. Commerce Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The department said that personal incomes rose 0.4 percent to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.94 trillion dollars following
a 0.6 percent increase in August.
</P>
<P>
Personal consumption spending also increased a small 0.2
percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.54 trillion
dollars in the month. That followed gains of 0.3 percent in August
and 1.1 percent in July.
</P>
<P>
Wages and salaries -- the largest component of income -- rose
0.3 percent in September, and transfer payments such as Social
Security and welfare increased 0.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Economists said personal income gains reflect steady wage
increases stemming from tight labor markets favoring job seekers.
</P>
<P>
The spending advance reflected a revival in shopping over the
summer and early fall after a temporary spring retreat by
consumers.
</P>
<P>
Disposable personal income -- income after taxes -- also
advanced by 0.4 percent in September.
</P>
<P>
Most of the strength in the personal spending in the month came
from a 0.5 percent increase in services. Spending on nondurable
goods rose 0.3 percent. However, spending on durable goods --
items expected to last for more than three years -- fell by 1.4
percent.
</P>
<P>
The fact that disposable income grew more quickly than spending
resulted in an increase in Americans' savings rate. It was up to
3.8 percent in September from 3.6 percent in August and 3.3
percent in July.

<HEADLINE> U.S.: No Dialogue with Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The United States on Monday
refused to make a dialogue, suggested by Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein, but insisted in its compliance with U.N. weapons
inspections.
</P>
<P>
"We're not interested in a dialogue. We're interested in
compliance," White House spokesman Mike McCurry said at a
briefing.
</P>
<P>
A three-member U.N. mission is to arrive in Baghdad late on
Tuesday to meet Iraqi officials to resolve dispute over three
American inspectors of U.N. weapons inspection teams, who were
rejected by the Iraqi authorities in entering the country for arms
inspections.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's news agency INA said earlier the U.N. mission was
"supposed to come for a dialogue in order to put things in order."
And the agency reported that Saddam Hussein was calling such a
dialogue.
</P>
<P>
But McCurry said the U.N. mission was not going to negotiate.
</P>
<P>
"The dialogue should consist of spelling out the ways in which
he will comply with the will of the international community as
presented to him by the delegation that will meet with Iraqi
officials," McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
Asked about possible U.S. unilateral military action, McCurry
said: "I'm not ruling anything in or out."
</P>
<P>
But he described the dispute as "fundamentally a dispute
between the United Nations and Iraq."McCurry declined to specify a
deadline for Saddam to make a favorable response to the U.N.
mission, just talked about the international community "united
against Iraq."
</P>
<P>
"As a matter of fact, Saddam Hussein's repeated defiance of
relevant Security Council resolutions has served to united the
international community and there is a unanimous opinion that
his current action is unacceptable," he said.

<P>
CRETE, Greece, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Greek Prime Minister
Costas Simitis today expressed his satisfaction about the outcome
of the first day of the Balkan summit here.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing tonight, Simitis described today's
meeting of the Balkan leaders as "useful and positive".
</P>
<P>
He said that the leaders had discussed their common problems
and bilateral issues among their countries. They had agreed on
settling their problems through systematic cooperation and
dialogue.
</P>
<P>
Simitis said he had met with four leaders of the Balkan
countries, including Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz, to
discuss the bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
The Simitis-Yilmaz meeting this evening was regarded as one of
the most important talks during the summit because the relations
between the two neighbors have witnessed an increased tension in
recent months.
</P>
<P>
Simitis also hailed his talks with Yilmaz as "useful".
</P>
<P>
He said that the two sides had agreed today to continue their
political dialogue in a bid to resolve their differences.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz has agreed, according to Simitis, that a third party
such as an international organization might help them to settle
their disputes.
</P>
<P>
During their talks, Simitis had accepted the invitation to
visit Turkey, which was extended to him by Yilmaz.
</P>
<P>
Although Simitis failed to give the date of his visit, analysts
here believe that this marks a breakthrough of the Greek-Turkish
relations because Simitis will be the first Greek premier to visit
Ankara since 1958.

<P>
LOS ANGELES, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang
Zemin, winding up a nine-day visit to the United States, left here
by special plane for home this morning.
</P>
<P>
He was given a red-carpet send-off at the Los Angeles
international airport.
</P>
<P>
In a farewell statement, the Chinese leader expressed sincere
thanks, on behalf of his wife and colleagues and in his own name,
to President and Mrs. Clinton, the American government and people
for their warm and grand reception.
</P>
<P>
"During my visit to the United States," the president said, "I
had fruitful talks with President Clinton and met with a broad
spectrum of people. President Clinton and I agreed that China and
the United States should, on the basis of the three China-U.S.
joint communiques, strengthen cooperation and endeavor to build a
constructive strategic partnership oriented towards the 21st
century in the interest of world peace and development. The two
sides also had an in-depth exchange of views and reached broad
agreement on regional and international issues of mutual
interest."
</P>
<P>
"The visit has reached the goal of enhancing mutual
understanding, broadening common ground, developing cooperation
and building a future together," he added.
</P>
<P>
History over the past half century and more has shown that both
China and the United States are two great nations shouldering
major responsibilities for the world, he said.
</P>
<P>
Despite differences in national conditions and other areas, he
said, the two countries share a wide range of significant common
interests in maintaining world peace and stability, promoting
global economic growth and prosperity and protecting the
environment for human survival.
</P>
<P>
"The establishment of a long-term, stable and sound
relationship between China and the United States not only serves
the fundamental interests of the two countries but also meets the
common aspirations of the people of the two countries and the rest
of the world," the Chinese president said.
</P>
<P>
"In the last few days," Jiang said, "I have been impressed by
the warm friendly sentiments of the American people towards the
Chinese people. The time-honored friendship between the people of
China and the United States will serve a powerful driving force
for the development of China-U.S. relations. We have every reason
to be confident about the future China-U.S. relations."
</P>
<P>
Present at the airport to see President Jiang off were Los
Angeles mayor Richard Riordan, officials from Los Angeles County
and representatives from the local Chinese community. Chinese
Ambassador to the United States Li Daoyu and Counsel General in
Los Angeles Feng Shusen were also present.
</P>
<P>
Jiang's entourage, including his wife Wang Yeping, Vice-Premier
and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and special assistant Zeng
Qinghong, also left here with the president.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Warns Iraq on Consequence of Barring Inspectors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The United States warned on
Monday that Iraq would be greeted with unspecified "firm action" if
it continues to bar American members of the U.N. weapons
inspection teams from entering the country.
</P>
<P>
"It is our view that the Security Council should be prepared to
take firm action to bring about Iraqi compliance in the event they
don't change their mind in the next day or so," State Department
spokesman James Rubin said at a briefing.
</P>
<P>
The stern warning came after Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
refused entry to three American arms inspectors and warned
continued U.S. U-2 reconnaissance flights could be fired on by
Iraqi anti-aircraft guns.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said Rubin's warning was the first time
Washington has placed a time-limit on resolving the dispute
diplomatically.
</P>
<P>
He said the United States reserved the right to take unilateral
military action against Iraq, but added: "That is not what our
next step is about."
</P>
<P>
A three-member U.N. mission was to arrive in Baghdad last on
Tuesday to meet Iraqi officials to try to resolve the crisis over
the American inspectors.
</P>
<P>
"Our view is that if Iraq doesn't change its mind as a result
of this mission and doesn't get the message that this mission is
going to bring, that the Security Council should be prepared to
take firm action," Rubin said.

<HEADLINE> China Calls for Efforts to Advance Women's Status </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The international
community should continue to make efforts to advance the status of
women and create conditions for the promotion of women's
participation in development, Chinese delegate Cui Ying stressed
here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Second Committee (Economic and Financial) of
the 52nd session of the General Assembly, Cui Ying said women were
an important force in human development, and without their active
and effective participation, economic and social development would
be difficult to achieve.
</P>
<P>
Cui Ying said it was only through their full participation that
women's political, economic and social advancement could be
secured.
</P>
<P>
Cui Ying said that since the convening of the Fourth World
Conference on Women, the international community had gained a
deeper insight into the role played by women in the resolution of
problems and difficulties facing women as well as in overcoming
obstacles to the advancement of women and their participation in
development.
</P>
<P>
However, the Chinese delegate said, there were regions in the
world which remained troubled with constant unrest; the economy of
a number of developing countries continued to deteriorate; and the
gap between the North and the South was widening. All this was
adversely affecting women's full participation in the development
process.
</P>

Cui said that the Chinese government had consistently advocated
equality between men and women by attaching importance to the
advancement of women and giving full play to women's initiatives,
creativity and potential in the political, economic and social
fields.
</P>
<P>
Cui expressed the hope that governments and the international
community would effectively honor their commitments by bolstering
women's full participation in the process of economic and social
development. She called on the UN system to play an active role in
this regard.

<HEADLINE> Iglesias Re-elected to New Term as IDB President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The Board of Governors of
the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) unanimously re-elected
Enrique V. Iglesias as Bank President during a special meeting
held here today.
</P>
<P>
Iglesias' new five-year term will begin on April 1, 1998, a
decade after he first became president of the Bank.
</P>
<P>
An IDB news release said that under his leadership, the Bank
has become the premier multilateral lender to Latin America and
the Caribbean. Its authorized subscribed capital was increased
from 34.5 billion U.S. dollars in 1988 to 61 billion dollars in
1989 and to 100 billion dollars in 1994, and lending increased
from 1.68 billion dollars in 1988 to 6.76 billion dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
IDB financing emphasizes poverty reduction, environmental
protection, creation of greater opportunities for youth and women,
rights of indigenous communities, and microenterprise. In recent
years, the Bank diversified its financing to include new areas,
such as judicial reform, social security reform, prevention of
domestic and urban violence, and strengthening of private sector
and democratic institutions.
</P>
<P>
Iglesias is a native of Asturias, Spain, and later becomes a
naturalized Uruguayan citizen. He was Uruguay's first Central Bank
president from 1967 to 1969. From 1972 to 1985, Iglesias was
executive secretary of the UN Economic Commission for Latin
America and the Caribbean, based in Santiago, Chile. He was
Uruguay's foreign minister from 1985 to 1988, who presided over
the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations that eventually led to the
creation of the World Trade Organization (WTO).

<HEADLINE> World Bank Warns of AIDS Virus Spreading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 3 (Xinhua) -- A World Bank report said
today that new evidence shows that while countries in sub-Saharan
Africa have the most people infected with AIDS, the deadly virus
may be on the verge of exploding in Eastern Europe, the former
Soviet Union and other regions.
</P>
<P>
The report said 23 million people are infected with HIV, with
8,500 new cases each day. Approximately 90 percent of all HIV
infections occur in developing countries, where resources to
confront the epidemic are most scarce.
</P>
<P>
More than 40 developing countries have concentrated epidemics,
including Latin America, parts of West Africa and most of
Indochina, the study found.
</P>
<P>
The report said that "for the 2.3 billion people living in
parts of the world where the epidemic is nascent, an early active
government response encouraging safer behavior among those likely
to contract and spread the virus has the potential to avert untold
suffering and save lives."
</P>
<P>
The report recommended that governments act as quickly as
possible with intensive prevention efforts, especially among
people who have many sex partners or inject drugs using
unsterilized needles.
</P>
<P>
Among countries in the early stages of the epidemic are
Bangladesh, the Philippines, most countries of the former Soviet
Union, much of Eastern Europe and parts of China and India, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank has committed 632 million U.S. dollars to 61
AIDS prevention projects in 41 countries.

<HEADLINE> Kinkel to Promote Germany's Role as Washington's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 3 (Xinhua) -- German Foreign Minister Klaus
Kinkel will underscore Germany's role as the main partner of the
United States in Europe during his one-day visit to Washington
Wednesday, said German press reports today.
</P>
<P>
Germany sees itself as the only major European country which is
fully committed to the enlargement of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) and the European Union (EU), the German news
agency DPA quoted German diplomatic sources as saying today.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to Washington, Kinkel will meet U.S. President
Bill Clinton, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and members of
the U.S. Congress. Major topics for discussions include the
eastward expansion of NATO and the EU, the Middle East peace
process, as well as Western relations with Iran.
</P>
<P>
According to German officials, Kinkel is set to tell U.S.
leaders that Europeans will pay their fair share of costs for
taking in new NATO members while warning that disagreement over
the funding issue should not be allowed to weaken the 16-nation
alliance.
</P>
<P>
The German foreign minister is also expected to promote closer
dialogue with Washington on Western relations with Teheran, and
will try to narrow the difference between Bonn and Washington over
the treatment of the Scientology movement in Germany.
</P>
<P>
Before his trip to the United States, Kinkel will visit Canada
Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Meets Chinese Delegation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu met here today with Wen Jiabao, politburo
member of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party,
to discuss enhancing bilateral economic and trade cooperations.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu and Wen Jiabao expressed satisfaction with the
smooth development of bilateral cooperations in the spheres of
economy, trade and culture, noting that there still exists vast
potential of furthering such cooperations.
</P>
<P>
The two placed special emphasis on the need to boost the
cooperation in the agricultural area. Agriculture plays an
important role in developing China's economy, Netanyahu said,
adding that China, as a big power with 1.2 billion population, is
a huge and attractive market for Israel's advanced agricultural
technologies and expertise.
</P>
<P>
Wen Jiabao, who heads a high-level delegation, said the
relations between China and Israel have been developing smoothly
since the two countries established diplomatic ties in 1992, thus
laying a solid foundation for enhancing cooperation in various
areas, especially in economic, trade and agricultural sectors.
</P>
<P>
He praised the joint Sino-Israeli farm established in Beijing
years ago as a model for furthering bilateral agricultural
cooperation. He also expressed the hope that the agricultural
cooperation would be expanded in the future, especially in areas
of water-saving, irrigation, and farming tools manufacture and
desert-control.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Netanyahu briefed Wen Jiabao on the latest
developments of the Israeli-Palestinian peace process,
reaffirming his intention to accelerate the peace talks to hold
the final-status talks in a bid to reach a package peace deal.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Wen Jiabao reiterated the Chinese position that
the concerned parties in the peace process should settle the
disputes in a cordial way and on the basis of respecting the
related resolutions passed by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
He added that China, as a member of the U.N. Security Council,
will continue contributing to achieving a just, comprehensive
and lasting peace in the Middle East.

<HEADLINE> Cameroonian President Swears in for Another </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YAOUNDE, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Cameroonian incumbent
President Paul Biya today swore in at the National Assembly for a
new seven-year term after winning re-election in October 12
presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
Among those present at the inauguration ceremony are
Cameroonian Prime Minister Peter Mafany Musonge, government
officials as well as diplomatic corps.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the swear-in ceremony, Biya pledged to combat
poverty in the country and declared that he will commit himself
to the development of Cameroon.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that his government is determined to enhance
democratic process in the country and uphold national unity.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Cameroon will attach importance to the
development of friendly ties with all nations around the world
and with neighboring countries in particular, while it will
continue to take an active role on the African continent.
</P>
<P>
Biya said Cameroon will continue to take belt-tightening
measures it accepted as part of a medium-term accord it signed
with the World Bank and International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
Referring to political turbulence in central Africa, Biya
noted,"there could be no development without security and peace."
He called on Cameroonians to cherish the peace in the country.
</P>
<P>
President Biya, 64, has been in power since 1982. He took over
power from independence President Ahmadou Ahidjo.
</P>
<P>
Biya won 1984 and 1988 elections as sole candidate and 1992
multiparty elections when he narrowly defeated the Social
Democratic Front (SDF) leader John Fru Ndi.
</P>
<P>
The three main opposition political parties which boycotted
the October 12 presidential elections did not attend the
inauguration ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The SDF, the National Union for Democracy and Progress (UNDP)
and the Cameroon Democratic Union (CDU) denounced the poll as
rigged from the start. They accused Biya's administration of
rigging all elections since the country embraced multiparty
politics in the early 1990s.

<HEADLINE> Saddam Discusses with Commanders on US Move </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
today presided over a meeting of military commanders of the armed
forces amid mounting tensions between Baghdad and the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
The official Iraqi News Agency did not reveal the place and
details of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
It was believed that Saddam and his commanders discussed the
possibility of U.S. military action against Iraq if the present
standoff comes to a showdown.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Saddam convened a special cabinet meeting to study
current political developments and necessary measures to deal
with possible U.S. attacks against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad insisted that it would not reverse its decision to bar
Americans from joining the U.N. weapons inspectors' teams which
are in charge of ensuring the elimination of weapons of mass
destruction in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
It has accused the American inspectors of conducting espionage
and obstructing the lifting of strangling U.N. sanctions against
Iraq imposed since its invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohamed al-Sahhaf issued a statement
Sunday accusing Richard Butler, chairman of the U.N. Special
Commission (UNSCOM) in charge of dismantling Iraqi mass
destruction weapons, of spreading falsehood.
</P>
<P>
Which law was Butler referring to in claiming that Iraq would
be violating law if it refused to deal with the Americans on the
U.N. commission, he questioned.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Iraq's decision to stop dealing with
American members on the commission, and to demand those in Iraq to
leave the country within a week's time, was a sound and legal
decision.
</P>
<P>
He added that the commission and its inspection teams and
supervision groups could do their work without the participation
of American members.
</P>
<P>
"We are keen to maintain constructive cooperation with the
Special Commission," he said, adding that "non dealing with those
Americans planted in the Special Commission for anti-Iraqi
political ends in no way means non cooperation with the commission."

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu-Clinton Summit Absent From Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The reported summit between
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and American President
Bill Clinton next week was conspicuously absent from Israel's
official agenda announced today.
</P>
<P>
The agenda for Netanyahu's visit to the U.S. next week, which
was announced by the Prime Minister's Office, did not even
include the U.S. capital Washington.
</P>
<P>
This refuted an earlier report broadcasted by Israel Radio
that the Netanyahu-Clinton summit had been nailed.
</P>
<P>
An unidentified official in the Prime Minister's Office was
late quoted by the radio as saying that the U.S. had told Israel
that the summit now depends on the outcome of the current
negotiations held in Washington between Israeli Foreign Minister
David Levy and Palestinian National Authority (PNA) deputy head
Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen).
</P>
<P>
The failure of arranging the summit now reflected Clinton's
displeasure with Netanyahu's handling of the Israeli-Palestinian
peace process, which was resumed early last month after a
seven-month freeze thanks to the intensive American mediation.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu is due to visit the U.S. from November 16 to address
the General Assembly of the Jewish Federations in the U.S. and
Canada, to be held in Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
According to the officially announced agenda, Netanyahu will
travel to Britain on November 12 to meet with his British
counterpart Tony Blair before heading to Indianapolis and Los
Angels.
</P>
<P>
For the past month, Israeli officials have been scrambling to
arrange the summit between Netanyahu and Clinton, assuring
Washington that real efforts are being made by the Netanyahu-led
government to advance the peace process.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is currently
hosting the Levy-Mazen negotiations in a bid to reach an
agreement on implementing the interim agreements.
</P>
<P>
Local media reported late last month that Netanyahu was
considering postponing his U.S. trip if Clinton refuses to
receive him, because Clinton's snub would be constructed by
Netanyahu's opponents as evidence that he is out of favor in the
White House.
</P>
<P>
Since Netanyahu came to power in June last year, his hardline
policies have taken the peace process into constant crisis to the
disappointment of the U.S. administration, which has repeatedly
urged for acceleration of the peace talks.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Urges More AIDS-Prevention Efforts in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank today called
on developing countries to strengthen their efforts for AIDS
prevention so as to save million of lives and reduce severe
economic and social costs of the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
In its latest's report -- Confronting AIDS: Public Priorities
in a Global Epidemic, released here today, the World Bank said
approximately 90 percent of all HIV infections are occurring in
developing countries, countries in sub-Saharan Africa have the
most people infected with AIDS -- 14 million, and the deadly virus
may be on the verge of exploding in Eastern Europe, the former
Soviet Union and other regions.
</P>
<P>
The 353-page report urged governments to act as quickly as
possible with intensive prevention efforts, especially among
people who have many sex partners or inject drugs using
unsterilized needles.
</P>
<P>
The report said that some 23 million people worldwide are now
infected with HIV and that 8,500 people are newly infected each
day. Two decades after the first appearance of the human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV), 6 million people have died from
AIDS.
</P>
<P>
"Confronting AIDS requires that government officials take the
necessary steps to confront the epidemic even when these are
politically controversial," said Joseph Stiglitz, the World Bank's
chief economist and senior vice president who is a former economic
affairs adviser to President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
He told the press briefing that the World Bank is one of the
largest sources of money for AIDS prevention, having committed 632
million U.S. dollars to 61 projects in 41 countries.
</P>
<P>
In many countries, government-backed prevention programs do not
reach people with the riskiest behavior, said the bank.
</P>
<P>
However, many countries still have an opportunity to prevent a
widespread HIV epidemic. In 30 developing countries, and in large
areas of China and India, HIV has infected less than 5 percent of
people who engage in very high risk behavior. Bangladesh,
Indonesia, the Philippines, most countries from the former Soviet
Union and much of East Europe are at this early stage of the
epidemic, the report noted.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the report, more than 40 developing
countries have "concentrated" epidemics, including Pakistan,
Ukraine, most of Latin America, parts of Western Africa, and most
of Indochina. Parts of India and the southwestern regions of China
bordering the "Golden Triangle" of the drug trade also have
concentrated epidemics.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, for the 2.3 billion people who live in these
countries and parts of China and India with "nascent" epidemics,
investing in effective prevention now can keep infection rates
very low and at relatively low costs.
</P>
<P>
"HIV moves through populations in a series of overlapping
epidemics," warned Martha Ainsworth, co-author of the report.
"Once the virus has spread widely among people with very risky
behavior, preventing its spread to others becomes increasingly
difficult."
</P>
<P>
In some countries, Ms. Ainsworth said, life expectancy is 10 to
20 years shorter than it would have been in the absence of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
"Short of an affordable cure, this toll is certain to rise, the
report said. "But the course of the epidemic is not carved in
stone."

<HEADLINE> Supreme Court Rejects Challenge to California's  Affirmative Action Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Supreme Court
Monday rejected a challenge to California's Proposition 209, which
bans affirmative action -- a formal effort to provide increased
employment and education opportunities for ethnic minorities and
women -- by any level of state or city government.
</P>
<P>
A coalition of civil rights groups had asked the justices to
hear argument on the challenge this term, but the Supreme Court
denied the request Monday without comment.
</P>
<P>
Lawyers following the case anticipate the rejection might open
the floodgates to similar measures across the country, at least on
the county or municipal level. About 26 jurisdictions are
reportedly poised to enact a similar law.
</P>
<P>
California voters passed Proposition 209 -- the California
Civil Rights Initiative -- in November 1996 by 54 to 46 percent.
</P>
<P>
Proposition 209 says the state "shall not discriminate against,
or grant preferential treatment to, any individual or group on the
basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity or national origin in the
operation of public employment, public education or public
contracting."
</P>
<P>
Earlier the coalition challenged the law, and a federal judge
in San Francisco issued a preliminary injunction against its
implementation, ruling that the state law conflicted with federal
civil rights laws.
</P>
<P>
But a federal appeals court panel threw out the injunction, and
refused to block the effects while the challengers took their case
to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court last month refused to suspend Proposition
209, but left open the question of whether it would hear argument
in the case until today.

<HEADLINE> Milosevic: Balkan's Future Relys on Regional Links </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CRETE, GREECE, November 3 (Xinhua) -- President Slobodan
Milosevic of Yugoslavia said today that the perspective of the
Balkan nations would depend on accelerated regional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the two-day Balkan summit, which opened here today,
Milosevic said the Balkan region was an inevitable part of its
inclusion in the overall European integration processes.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that any autarchy was dangerous not only for social
and economic development, but also peace and stability as a common
goal of the region.
</P>
<P>
"A balanced and comprehensive development of bilateral and
regional cooperation, without any barriers, may ensure a dynamic
development of the region as a whole as well as of each individual
country," he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged European institutions to consider the region as an
integral part of Europe instead of a "permanent hotbed of crisis."
</P>
<P>
The Europe of bloc divisions should not be succeeded by the
Europe of new partitions and discrimination," he said, adding that
it was necessary to narrow the economic gap in Europe.
</P>
<P>
As for the cooperation between the Balkans, Milosevic hoped
that efforts be focused on the strengthening and promotion of
political cooperation by keeping regular contacts and political
dialogue at all levels.
</P>
<P>
He added that efforts should be made for the establishment of a
Balkan free trade zone and the promotion of all-round cooperation,
especially in transport, telecommunications, energy and
environment.
</P>
<P>
On the Bosnian issue, he said that the international community
should not act for them just to arbitrate in disputes between the
parties concerned, but instead create the conditions to help the
legal representatives and entities in fully playing their part.

</P>
<P>
"I condemn in the strongest terms the renewed refusal of Iraq
to cooperate without conditions with the U.N. disarmament
mission...," said German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel said that with such cynical policies, Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein was driving his country ever deeper into isolation.
</P>
<P>
The statement stressed Bonn's full support to the U.N.
inspection program.
</P>
<P>
Iraq is now threatening to expel the American members of the
U.N. inspection team. U.N. inspectors said they have made
significant new discoveries at Iraqi military facilities.

<HEADLINE> Israelis, Palestinians Negotiate for Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators started a new round of negotiations on Monday in an
attempt to revive the stalemated peace talks in response to U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's call during her first
visit to the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy and Palestinian negotiator
Mahmoud Abbas, a senior aide of Chairman Yasser Arafat, met
Albright at the State Department before they began their talks in
a Virginia suburb of Washington.
</P>
<P>
Israel has sent a full negotiation team while the Palestinian
Authority dispatched a few officials for this week's talks as they
did not trust the United States even-handedness in its brokering
for the settlement of disputes between the Israelis and
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. State Department, however, tried to persuade the
Palestinian Authority to send more negotiators to Washington so
that the talks could be more effective.
</P>
<P>
Notably absent were some Palestinian experts on what are known
as the interim issues.
</P>
<P>
"They are not here. A significant part of the morning was spent
discussing that without them we won't be able to make any
progress," State Department spokesman James Rubin said at a
briefing.
</P>
<P>
Arafat was reported to have said that he sent Abbas to meet
Levy at the Washington talks "only because we received an official
invitation from Madeleine Albright."
</P>
<P>
In the past week, Arafat said he believes the Washington talks
this week are "a waste of time" because of differences over the
agenda.
</P>
<P>
The United States said this week's talks have a four-point
agenda: Israeli-Palestinian security cooperation, further Israeli
troops withdrawal from the West Bank, a possible "time-out" on
Jewish settlements, and ways of moving to negotiations on the
final status of Palestinian areas.
</P>
<P>
But Israeli government spokesman Moshe Fogel said on Saturday
that the "natural focus" of the talks would be on issues left over
from past agreements, such as creating a Palestinian port and
airport and safe passage between the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians said these were limited technical issues that
should be dealt with by joint committees which met last month with
U.S. mediator Dennis Ross present.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians want to focus on Israeli redeployment and a
freeze on Jewish settlements before they will consider starting
final status negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Palestinian peace talks has been suspended since
March when the Israeli government broke the ground for a Jewish
Housing construction in Arab East Jerusalem.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Vows to Strike Hard on Terrorists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Interior Minister Hassan
Mohamed el Alfy today announced an all-out campaign to strike hard
on the country's terrorist and criminal elements.
</P>
<P>
"Full planning and preparations are being made by all security
agencies in all the governorates to combat all criminal acts and
to apprehend outlaw elements in the South of Egypt," the minister
said, quoted by the Egyptian Middle East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
During an inspection tour today of Menoufia Governorate, in the
Nile Delta, he told reporters that Egyptian security agencies deal
firmly and decisively with any individual or group's actions which
threaten security.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question on the extradition of outlaws, the
minister said there were agreements between Egypt and a number of
world countries to cooperate in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Egypt will host a U.N.-sponsored international conference on
combating organized crime and extradition of fugitive terrorists,
Alfy told reporters.
</P>
<P>
A preparatory conference is to be held in the Egyptian northern
coastal city Alexandria next week with the aim of drawing up
proposals on fighting organized crime, he added.
</P>
<P>
Today's visit to Menoufia Governorate is part of a series of
inspection visits of the minister to the various governorates that
have been battered by terrorist attacks in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
According to the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights, armed
Islamist groups bore responsibility for most of the acts of
violence in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Although Muslim militant violence has reportedly declined by
more than 50 percent in during 1995-96, the recent wave of
terrorist attacks around the country has rekindled public fears.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian security services succeeded in reducing the armed
Islamist groups' activities with successive strikes against their
strongholds, resulting in the arrests or deaths of their top
leaders.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the number of Islamic militants executed have
reached 63 since fundamentalists launched a violent
anti-government campaign in March 1992. A total of 2,255 people
have been killed in the violence.
