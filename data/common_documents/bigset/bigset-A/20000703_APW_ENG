<HEADLINE> Teachers Think 5th Year Would Help  </HEADLINE>
By ANJETTA McQUEEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- While students may cringe at the idea of a
fifth year of high school, a teacher's union president says that's
the ideal prescription for those least prepared to continue their
education or enter the work force.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a choice between letting kids fall through the cracks
.... or doing whatever it takes to bring them up to par,'' said
Sandra Feldman, president of the American Federation of Teachers,
who's proposing a special ''transitional year'' for students in
danger of failing high school exit exams or of dropping out before
even taking the test.
</P>
<P>
   It's one of the ideas to be discussed as thousands of educators
attend simultaneous meetings of the two major teachers' unions this
week, shaping their lobbying agendas and plans for the new school
year.
</P>
<P>
   Under Feldman's proposal -- to be put before her union on Monday
-- specially trained teachers would help students by using methods
employed to catch up military recruits, high school drop outs and
other teens and young adults with minimal reading skills. The
current system, Feldman said in an interview last week, is unfair
to students who have been promoted regardless of grades or test
scores, then asked to pass tough tests for their diplomas. About 30
states have such exit exams.
</P>
<P>
   However, states set their own school schedules. Kindergarten is
not even mandatory in every state, so most students only get grades
one through 12.
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear whether teachers, students and parents would
welcome any change in the dozen years a child usually spends in
school: ''When it comes to stigmatizing students, there's not going
to be any difference between holding a student back or adding a
year,'' said Galen Price, a North Carolina 12th-grader who heads
the International Student Activism Alliance, a nationwide network
that follows state and federal education policy.
</P>
<P>
   Districts -- already adding summer, Saturday and after-school
classes for struggling students -- might balk at another reason to
find more classrooms and more teachers for extra kids.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's definitely going to be a financial stress on them,'' said
Judy Seltz, a spokeswoman for the American Association of School
Administrators. ''Even if that fifth year has a substantially
smaller enrollment, there's still staffing and space
implications.''
</P>
<P>
   In remarks prepared for Monday's opening of the union's 76th
annual meeting, Feldman says educators could provide the extra help
if state and federal lawmakers used the nation's economic
prosperity to build new schools and hire more teachers: ''The fact
is, too many of our political leaders and school officials are not
doing their part.''
</P>
<P>
   While the AFT, representing 1 million teachers in larger cities,
meets here, the National Education Association, the largest group
with 2.5 million members, is meeting in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic presidential candidate Al Gore, who's won the
endorsement of both groups, is slated to appear in Philadelphia and
Chicago this week.
</P>
<P>
   July is traditionally when the nation's schoolteachers meet to
set priorities for how they'll teach in classrooms and how they'll
bargain with the people who sign their paychecks. This year -- with
elections nearing -- a flurry of proposals will give teachers much
to contemplate: Link their pay to students' scores? Take a
mandatory test to keep their licenses? Pay higher dues?
</P>
<P>
   Some of the new issues on the table at both meetings are first
nibbles for organizations usually seen as entrenched and resistant
to change.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 4,000 delegates expected at AFT will decide the union's
position on testing teachers and raising standards for charter
schools and online colleges.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 9,000 delegates of the NEA, recently criticized for how
it reports the funds it spends on political activities, are slated
to consider the union's policy on turning around low-performing
schools, school privatization, and teacher pay based on
performance, rather than seniority.	   They will also approve state-level
mergers of the two unions in
Florida and Montana. Meanwhile, the persistent, but unsuccessful,
mission to merge the two labor groups will continue with
high-level, behind-the-scenes talks, leaders say.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Opposition Party Has Edge  </HEADLINE>
By NIKO PRICE
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Opposition candidate Vicente Fox held a clear
edge in exit polls in historic presidential elections Sunday that
could end the ruling party's 71-year lock on the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   A Fox victory would be almost unthinkable for many in Mexico,
where the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, is
almost synonymous with the government -- and even the nation itself
-- to millions of supporters and detractors alike.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, of the conservative National Action Party, held a lead of
between 6 and 9 percentage points over the PRI's Francisco
Labastida, according to five exit polls by Mexican news media and
U.S. polling companies.
</P>
<P>
   The official count was still fragmentary, with only 9 percent of
polling places reporting -- most of them in urban areas where Fox is
strongest. He led 48.3 percent to 31.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Moments after the exit polls were released, Fox said he would
wait for more official results before declaring victory. He assured
Mexicans there would be a calm transition if he won.
</P>
<P>
   ''From today forward, we need to unite. ... We have to work
together to make Mexico the great country we have all dreamed of,''
he said. He called Sunday a ''historic day for our country.''
</P>
<P>
   The third-place candidate, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, conceded the
election to Fox in a speech before supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ''In this election, we have begun dismantling the regime of the
official party,'' Cardenas said.
</P>
<P>
   People began gathering beneath the gilded angel of Mexico City's
Independence Monument as the polls poured in, all favoring Fox.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is going to do away with the bad governments, the
narco-politicians, dishonest people,'' said Miguel Morlet, a
60-year-old hotel administrator.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, celebrating youths waved the blue and white National
Action flag while plastic trumpets blared amid chants of ''Yes you
could!'' for the rapidly gathering television cameras.
</P>
<P>
   An exit poll by the Televisa television network showed Fox with
44 percent and Labastida with 38 percent. Another poll by the rival
TV Azteca network gave Fox 38.8 percent to Labastida's 30.5
percent, and one by the Reforma newspaper group showed Fox with a
44 percent to 36 percent edge.
</P>
<P>
   An exit poll by the Chamber of the Radio and Television Industry
had Fox ahead 43-34 and a poll by two U.S. polling firms showed him
ahead 42-36. Cardenas was a distant third in all the polls.
</P>
<P>
   The polls by Televisa and the U.S. firms had a margin of error
of one percentage point; Azteca's was 1.5 and the others didn't
give margins of error.
</P>
<P>
   The vote was the first in more than a century in which the
outcome wasn't clear beforehand. Despite hundreds of allegations of
pressure and vote-buying -- most perpetrated by the ruling party --
the elections were widely seen as Mexico's fairest ever.
</P>
<P>
   ''It could be that we make history today,'' said Rebeca Meza
Oliva, a 45-year-old housewife waiting in line to vote -- for Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning early in the morning, long lines formed at voting
booths, evidence of a heavy turnout. Frustrated voters clashed with
election workers in Mexico City when some booths for people casting
ballots outside their home districts ran out of absentee ballots
shortly after noon -- with hundreds still in line.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI also appeared to have lost three key local races,
according to exit polls by the television networks.
</P>
<P>
   The exit polls showed the leftist Democratic Revolution Party
holding onto Mexico City's mayorship with Andres Manuel Lopez
Obrador well ahead of his rivals.
</P>
<P>
   In Morelos state, just south of the capital, the polls had
National Action capturing the governorship from the PRI, and they
had National Action holding Fox's home state of Guanajuato.
</P>
<P>
   Fox is a former Coca-Cola executive and rancher who was elected
governor of central Guanajuato in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   He pledges to halt corruption, jump-start the economy with
foreign investment and jobs programs and nearly double spending for
public education. He espouses an agreement with the United States
that would let workers cross the border freely.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling party standard-bearer, Labastida ran a largely
traditional campaign after a landslide victory in the party's first
presidential primary in November.
</P>
<P>
   He promised more aid for the countryside, more resources for
public education and more attention to the poor. Labastida, a
former governor of Sinaloa state, was a top Cabinet secretary
before the campaign and said he would continue many of President
Ernesto Zedillo's policies.
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas, a veteran leftist leader, was in his third
presidential campaign. Many Mexicans believe he won the 1988
elections, only to be cheated out of a victory by fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Three other candidates were on the ballot, although one told his
supporters in the weeks before the election to vote for Fox.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign was remarkably fair by Mexican standards and
opposition parties had unprecedented access to advertising and news
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   A record 10,000 local poll watchers and 860 foreign observers
were at the polling places Sunday to prevent fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Observer groups and opposition parties charged that local PRI
officials gave gifts in return for promised votes or warned poor
people government aid would be cut off if they backed the
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   But the head of the Federal Electoral Institute, Jose
Woldenberg, said in the early afternoon that problems were the
exception. He said his workers ''tell us we are experiencing
exemplary elections.''

<HEADLINE> Opposition Party Triumphs in Mexico  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN RICE
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- It has been a long, hard wait for Mexico's
largest opposition party.
</P>
<P>
   After seeing its activists ignored, jailed, or derided as
anti-patriotic for generations, the National Action Party on Sunday
earned an electoral triumph behind its presidential candidate,
Vicente Fox.
</P>
<P>
   National Action -- known by its Spanish acronym PAN -- was founded
in 1939 under Manuel Gomez Morin, a leading Mexican intellectual
who opposed the big-government trends of the ruling party at that
era.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, the party appealed to religious, middle-class
Mexicans frustrated by the single-party domination of the
Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, and to what were then
tough restrictions on the clergy.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling PRI of that era allowed other parties -- but not real
opposition. It used fraud and violence to crush foes at the polls.
</P>
<P>
   National Action was long associated in the popular mind with
Catholic lay groups -- stifling its development among other sectors
opposed to the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   Even this year, critics on the left accused it of of
''fascism,'' a reference to the conservative social views held by
many of its leaders and to a minor thread within the party that
dates back to the pro-fascist Sinarquista movement of the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   But the PAN has always worked peacefully through the ballot box.
</P>
<P>
   And since the 1970s, it has increasingly become a party of
Mexico's growing urban middle classes and business sectors who were
less interested in the church than in a cleaner, smaller
government.
</P>
<P>
   The party's candidate this year, pragmatic businessman Vicente
Fox, has tried to broaden the party's base further, promising to
embrace even some leftist policies in efforts to make the party the
center of efforts to topple the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   Not until the late 1940s did National Action party manage to
elect its first few congressmen, after a legal battle. Not until
1952 did it bother even trying to seek the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   As late as 1961, it only ran for about half of the congressional
seats on offer. By the 1970s, it was winning more than 20 seats.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Alvarez, National Action's presidential candidate in 1958,
recalls seeing his campaign workers -- even himself -- jailed during
the campaign and some physically attacked.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some hotels refused to give us a room,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The party finished third in the crucial 1988 election. Many
thought the PRI stole the election from a leftist coalition headed
by Cuauhtemoc Cardenas.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking legitimacy, then-President Carlos Salinas forged a
tactical alliance with the PAN -- under Alvarez -- which pushed him
into a series of major political reforms that significantly opened
the electoral system.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, the PAN won its first governorship. On Sunday, it won
its sixth state governorship, in Morelos, and it is part of a
coalition in another. Entering Sunday, the PAN also governed eight
of Mexico's 10 largest cities.

   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Opposition candidate Vicente Fox won Mexico's
presidential elections Sunday, ending the ruling party's 71-year lock on the
presidency, President Ernesto Zedillo said. Moments later, ruling-party
candidate Francisco Labastida said: ''The citizens have made a decision that we

Hanford Fire Crews Sent Home
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   RICHLAND, Wash. (AP) -- Workers at the Hanford nuclear reservation were
allowed to return Sunday, following a 191,000-acre fire that disrupted thousands
of lives and raised fears about possible radiation releases. Meanwhile, hundreds
of firefighters drafted from around the region had returned home, leaving a few
local firefighters to ensure hot spots would not flare up. Hanford managers, who
had barred all but a few essential workers from the site during the crisis, said
Sunday that all employees could return. Tomorrow, most of the site's 10,000
workers will resume the task of cleaning up nuclear waste at Hanford, which
contains the nation's largest volume of such wastes.

Israeli military outpost at the border fence separating Lebanon and Israel.
Witnesses said the window of a passing armored Israeli jeep was broken, but
Israeli soldiers did not respond with gunfire as they have in the past at the

House Would Mull Suspending Gas Tax

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House would likely go along if the Senate votes to
suspend the 18-cent federal gas tax, but a new way would have to be found to pay
for highway construction, the House majority leader says. At any rate, Rep. Dick
Armey said, suspending the tax would be a temporary fix to a permanent problem
of high gasoline prices. More helpful would be to augment the natural gas
delivery system, deal more forcefully with foreign oil suppliers and cut down on
oil imports, he said on ''Fox News Sunday.''

<HEADLINE> Storied History for Mexican Party  </HEADLINE>
By ISAAC A. LEVI
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- For seven decades the Institutional
Revolutionary Party has ruled Mexico, sometimes with a velvet glove
and at others with an iron fist, omnipresent and almost synonymous
with the government itself.
</P>
<P>
   But with Sunday's loss in the presidential election, the party
known as the PRI lost the chance to surpass the Soviet Communist
Party's record as the longest-ruling party of this century.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI began with many parallels to the Soviet party: tight
links to power, highly centralized leadership, a vast network of
local organizations and a sometimes violent allergy to opposition.
</P>
<P>
   But it has proved vastly more flexible in out co-opting or
neutralizing opponents, leading Peruvian novelist Mario Vargas
Llosa to call it ''the perfect dictatorship.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with its loss of the presidency, the PRI is likely to
remain a large force in Congress, while continuing to hold most
state governorships. But the party's greatest strength -- its
enormous nationwide network of grassroots organizations -- could
wind up squabbling for power if the party is decapitated by the
loss of the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI was always long on loyalty and short on ideology. It
veered from a home-brewed socialism under President Lazaro Cardenas
in the 1930s to privatizing free-marketeering under its last three
presidents.
</P>
<P>
   President Plutarco Elias Calles created the PRI in 1929 to
discipline the feuding factions who had won the Mexican Revolution
of 1910-1920 and end their often-violent struggles for power.
</P>
<P>
   The party brought stability to Mexico, then a poor, backward,
agrarian country left a shambles by a decade of civil war and
several years of political infighting.
</P>
<P>
   And stability was no small matter to a country that since
gaining independence in 1821 had seen a series of dictators,
invaders and musical-chair governments.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI also did something that few other Latin American nations
have done: keep the army completely out of politics for decades,
after gradually weaning the country away from its revolutionary
military leadership by 1946.
</P>
<P>
   Those benefits long came at the cost of a silenced opposition.
</P>
<P>
   The outgoing president would name a successor, and the party
would get him elected, by fraud when necessary.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI retained its strong base in the rural heart of Mexico.
But as Mexicans increasingly moved to the cities and became more
educated, they often turned to other parties.
</P>
<P>
   Bloody crackdowns on workers in the 1950s and on students in
1968 alienated many Mexicans on the left. And the economic crises
of the 1980s drove many middle class and wealthy Mexicans into
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Austerity and a turn to free-market ideology started to trim the
party's ability to lavish election-era gifts and jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The party increasingly was forced to open the political system.
In 1989, for the first time, it admitted losing a governorship. By
1997, as its vote percentages declined election after election, it
lost its majority in Congress and the mayorship of most of Mexico's
largest cities.
</P>
<P>
   It responded with even greater, if inconsistent, attempts at
reform. President Ernesto Zedillo pushed the party into Mexico's
first open national presidential primary last November.
</P>
<P>
   But the goodwill it gained was not enough to push Francisco
Labastida to the PRI's traditional easy win over the opposition.

<HEADLINE> Rural Town Sticks With Ruling Party  </HEADLINE>
By JULIE WATSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA MARIA ACATEPEC, Mexico (AP) -- The people of this mountain
village nestled amid papaya and almond trees may not have
electricity, but they have a new bridge and the promise of cash.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling party has come through again, and this poor Indian
community gave thanks Sunday at the ballot box.
</P>
<P>
   ''They just gave us a bridge, and you have to support the people
who help you,'' said Juan Morales, a 56-year-old corn farmer who
voted at a roadside table while dogs nipped at fleas at his feet.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, boys winged pebbles at voters. Men in sandals and women
with long braids gathered along the road, some talking in the
staccato Mixteco language. Some walked as long as three hours from
outlying areas to reach the poll.
</P>
<P>
   Despite debates across the country about who will win one of
Mexico's most hotly contested presidential elections, people in
these Oaxacan mountains overlooking the Pacific Ocean say they
already know: the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI,
which has governed Mexico for 71 years.
</P>
<P>
   That was indeed the case, at least in this town: Results
released late Sunday afternoon showed that 87 percent of the 530
residents of Santa Maria Acatepec and surrounding areas who cast a
ballot here voted for the PRI, while only 8 percent voted for the
leftist Democratic Revolution Party, and 3 percent for the
center-right National Action Party, the party of opposition
presidential candidate Vicente Fox.
</P>
<P>
   But on the national scale, Fox beat PRI presidential candidate
Francisco Labastida.
</P>
<P>
   Rarely does a village in this region go against the PRI, which
the party had hoped would make the difference in what has been
touted as Mexico's cleanest election.
</P>
<P>
   ''They say we vote for the PRI because we are poor and
uneducated, but we know what we are doing. It is the only party
that has helped us. We've never seen the other parties around
here,'' said Perfecto Hernandez Lopez, a 44-year-old coffee farmer.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI government's good will was in full force in the days
before the election in this town, which has no indoor plumbing or
street lights. To leave or arrive, residents have had to drive or
wade across a stream, which often swells to a raging river during
the rainy season and blocks the only dirt road to the village of
600 people.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, men carried a woman in labor on a cot across the
raging waters to get her to the clinic on the other side. Families
returning their dead to the village to be buried have had to hoist
coffins on their shoulders across the waist-deep waters.
</P>
<P>
   Two days before the elections, area officials clad in ''Vote for
the PRI'' T-shirts inaugurated a long-requested bridge with a live
brass band and dancers in cowboy hats. The bridge is unfinished,
but was still open for traffic. It is painted in the PRI colors --
the same as Mexico's red, white and green flag.
</P>
<P>
   The day after the bridge inauguration, officials called a
meeting at the town hall, also the polling place. Its walls were
emblazoned with posters of Labastida, but opposition
representatives made city workers take them down 15 minutes after
the polls opened. Labastida looked on from a poster across the
road.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities collected copies of the voter identification cards
after people cast their ballots. In return, each family will
receive about $300 in disaster relief funds for victims of an
earthquake, which destroyed a third of the village's homes nearly a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't know if the money comes from the PRI or from the
government, but we do know it comes from the government, which is
the PRI,'' said Nicolas Flores Lopez.
</P>
<P>
   In April, when polls showed Fox pulling roughly even with
Labastida, officials here distributed cement and other building
materials to the victims.
</P>
<P>
   What was left over is being stored in the yard of Flores Lopez.
PRI campaign posters are the only wall hangings in his home.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know there are opposition supporters among us, but they stay
hidden,'' said the 60-year-old farmer, laughing and showing his
five teeth.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, there was little evidence of them at the polling
place, where PRI Mayor Ricardo Jinez stood watch over the process
wearing a large gold chain reading ''Rica'' around his neck.
</P>
<P>
   ''What do I do? Do I sign my name?'' a woman asked from behind
the white tarp covering the voting table.
</P>
<P>
   ''No,'' said another man waiting to vote. He pointed at the PRI
logo on the ballot. ''You just put an 'X' here.''

<HEADLINE> Police investigate after boy nearly drowns on ride  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BRISTOL, Conn. (AP) -Police and safety officials were
investigating after a 5-year-old boy nearly drowned on a water ride
at Lake Compounce amusement park.
</P>
<P>
   Devon M. Alexander, of Hartford, was in critical condition at
Connecticut Children's Medical Center Sunday night, a hospital
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   A Lake Compounce official said the boy could not swim and did
not wear one of the life vests provided for water rides. Lifeguards
searched for about 25 minutes before pulling Devon from the water.
</P>
<P>
   The accident occurred Saturday evening on the Lake Plunge, in
which riders take an inner tube down an enclosed slide that empties
into the park's lake, said park spokesman Richard Bisi.
</P>
<P>
   Bisi said the boy fell off his tube when it hit the water. When
he did not surface, the child's stepfather - who planned to follow
Devon down the slide on another tube - alerted park personnel, Bisi
said.
</P>
<P>
   A lifeguard who witnessed the incident jumped in the water and
called for more help, Bisi said. Within a minute, three other
lifeguards joined the search, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Two minutes later, 22 additional lifeguards began searching the
water, Bisi said. The park's emergency medical technicians arrived
within minutes and local and state police dive teams were
contacted, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The boy was recovered in about 25 minutes, more than 100 feet
from where he fell off his tube, Bisi said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very fair to say that the lifeguards and supervisors did
everything humanly possible to help and find this young boy,'' Bisi
said.
</P>
<P>
   Some investigators questioned the length of time it took to find
the boy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Lifeguards supposedly immediately went into the water to look
for the child,'' said Southington police Lt. Clifford Saucier. ''I
don't understand why the child wasn't found.''
</P>
<P>
   Devon ascended the ride with Damon Comeaux, identified by police
as his stepfather. The pair passed a sign that warned ''Strong
swimmers only. Deep water. Strong current,'' Bisi said, and the
attendant repeated the warning.
</P>
<P>
   The boy's stepfather assured the attendant that Devon could
handle the ride, Bisi said. The park doesn't require riders to wear
life preservers, but they are optional.
</P>
<P>
   On the dock, Comeaux told lifeguards that Devon couldn't swim,
Bisi said.
</P>
<P>
   Comeaux could not be reached for comment Sunday. A person
answering the phone at a Hartford number under his name declined to
comment. The family kept vigil at the boy's hospital bed throughout
the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Along with a police investigation, Lake Compounce requested an
independent review by an aquatic safety company. The ride will
remain closed until those investigations are completed.
</P>
<P>
   The last fatal accident at Lake Compounce occurred in August,
when a 16-year-old ride attendant died after falling beneath a
moving ride. The park was cited by the Occupational Safety and
Health Administration in the death of Matthew Henne, of
Southington.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1981, 16-year-old Michele Johnson of Bristol died after
falling from a roller coaster as she stood and reached out the side
of the car.

<HEADLINE> School districts struggle to fill some teaching positions  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   While school is out, the hard work lies ahead for
superintendents looking to fill teaching positions.
<TEXT>
<P>
   School officials are busy shoring up their faculties in time for
next school year, advertising across New England at a time when
much of the nation is experiencing a shortage of teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is getting increasingly difficult to find good
candidates,'' said Griswold Superintendent Elizabeth Osga.
</P>
<P>
   Griswold began advertising on the Internet for the first time
this year and finished its advertising for openings three months
earlier than normal. The district also expanded its outreach to job
fairs at universities.
</P>
<P>
   Killingly Superintendent Jules D'Agostino said he is confident
seven openings will be filled, but he expects it will be a struggle
to find a technology teacher and an eighth-grade French teacher.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most superintendents will tell you that has been a problem in
past years and we expect it will be this year,'' D'Agostino said.
</P>
<P>
   The American Federation of Teachers reported shortages in
special education, math, speech therapy and English as a Second
Language in 1999 and some surplus in elementary and social studies
teachers.
</P>
<P>
   A study last year by the National Commission on Teaching and
America's Future said there are plenty of teachers in the job pool,
but the challenge is in recruiting. State education departments and
school districts that do not develop aggressive recruitment
strategies or accept licenses awarded in other states suffer
teacher shortages, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   In Connecticut, shortages were curbed significantly by a 1986
state law that reformed schools by raising teacher standards and
boosting salaries to the highest level in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   School districts that have not had a problem hiring teachers
this year fear the need might become more urgent in the next couple
of years due to substantial retirements.

Vicente Fox Voted Mexico President
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Opposition candidate Vicente Fox won Mexico's
presidential elections Sunday in a stunning victory that ended the ruling
party's 71-year lock on the presidency. The victory was almost unthinkable for
many in Mexico, where the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, has
been synonymous with the government -- and even the nation itself -- to millions
of supporters and detractors alike. Election officials' preliminary results
''are sufficient and trustworthy enough to say that the next president of the
republic will be Vicente Fox,'' President Ernesto Zedillo said in a nationally
televised statement.

released. Notably absent from the new government lineup were members of Fiji's
Indian minority, who have been stripped of most political power since rebels
stormed parliament on May 19 and took the Indian-led government hostage.

Hanford Fire Crews Sent Home
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   RICHLAND, Wash. (AP) -- Workers at the Hanford nuclear reservation were
allowed to return Sunday, following a 191,000-acre fire that disrupted thousands
of lives and raised fears about possible radiation releases. Meanwhile, hundreds
of firefighters drafted from around the region had returned home, leaving a few
local firefighters to ensure hot spots would not flare up. Hanford managers, who
had barred all but a few essential workers from the site during the crisis, said
Sunday that all employees could return. Tomorrow, most of the site's 10,000
workers will resume the task of cleaning up nuclear waste at Hanford, which
contains the nation's largest volume of such wastes.

demonstrators chanted ''God is great'' in Arabic as they threw stones at an
Israeli military outpost at the border fence separating Lebanon and Israel.
Witnesses said the window of a passing armored Israeli jeep was broken, but
Israeli soldiers did not respond with gunfire as they have in the past at the

House Would Mull Suspending Gas Tax
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House would likely go along if the Senate votes to
suspend the 18-cent federal gas tax, but a new way would have to be found to pay
for highway construction, the House majority leader says. At any rate, Rep. Dick
Armey said, suspending the tax would be a temporary fix to a permanent problem
of high gasoline prices. More helpful would be to augment the natural gas
delivery system, deal more forcefully with foreign oil suppliers and cut down on
oil imports, he said on ''Fox News Sunday.''

bases with none out in the seventh against Matt Perisho on John Olerud's double,
a walk to Jay Buhner and David Bell's single. Pinch-hitter Stan Javier's
grounder off reliever Tim Crabtree nearly resulted in a double play, but Javier
barely beat shortstop Scott Sheldon's relay to first as Olerud scored the tying
run.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Ryan Christenson hit a leadoff homer and
an RBI single during a seven-run first inning as the Oakland
Athletics beat the Anaheim Angels 10-3 Sunday to stop a four-game
losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   Staked to a 7-0 lead before his first pitch, Tim Hudson (10-2)
improved to 9-0 in 13 starts since an April 20 loss at Cleveland.
Hudson, 21-4 in 38 career starts, allowed two runs and six hits in
seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   Christenson's second homer of the season triggered the big first
inning against Tim Belcher (2-2), starting the Athletics to their
21st win in 29 games.
</P>
<P>
   Belcher lasted just one-third of an inning, the shortest of 368
career starts, allowing seven runs, five hits and three walks. His
ERA ballooned from 4.97 to 9.67.
</P>
<P>
   In the first inning alone, the Athletics exceeded their run
total during the losing streak (six). Ben Grieve, Almedo Sanez,
Ramon Hernandez and Randy Velarde added RBI singles, and Miguel
Tejada had a run-scoring grounder.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Fyhrie blanked Oakland for 4 2-3 innings before Jason
Giambi's RBI single off Mark Petkovsek in the sixth. Miguel Tejada
added a two-run homer off Derrick Turnbow in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   For Anaheim, Garrett Anderson hit an RBI grounder in the first,
Tim Salmon had a run-scoring single in the third and another run
came in on Jeff Tam's wild pitch in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Troy Glaus was hitless in four at-bats to remain in an
0-for-18 drought. ... Palmeiro went 2-for-4 and is batting .369
(32-for-89) in 25 starts. ... Darin Erstad (2-for-4) had his 42nd

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Marvin Benard homered leading off the ninth
inning and Jeff Kent connected twice Sunday, leading the San
Francisco Giants over the Los Angeles Dodgers 6-5.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard hit a 2-2 pitch from Mike Fetters (3-1) into the
right-field bleachers for his sixth homer of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Winner Robb Nen (2-3) blew a save for the fifth time in 18
chances, allowing on a pair of runs in the eighth on Gary
Sheffield's RBI single and a wild pitch with F.P. Santangelo on
third.
</P>
<P>
   Kent increased his league-leading RBIs total to 80 as the Giants
won their second straight over the Dodgers after an 0-4 start this
year against their longtime rival.
</P>
<P>
   Kent homered off Eric Gagne with two outs in the fifth and off
Antonio Osuna with two outs in the seventh, raising his season
total to 23 with his 11th multihomer game, including two this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Giants starter Shawn Estes allowed one run, seven hits and four
walks in five innings. Estes allowed at least two runners in each
inning, walking the bases loaded in the third with one out. He
struck out Todd Hundley and retired Kevin Elster on a flyout.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Karros singled and Adrian Beltre walked to lead off the
fifth, but Estes was again able to pitch his way of trouble with
two strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   Gagne allowed four runs, six hits and three walks in five
innings.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco went ahead in the first when Benard singled and
stole second, continued to third on Hundley's throwing error and
scored on Bill Mueller's sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Grudzielanek hit a game-tying RBI single in the fourth, but
the Giants took a 3-1 lead in the fourth on Armando Rios' sacrifice
fly and Rich Aurilia's RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles closed to 4-3 in the seventh on a run-scoring error
by catcher Bobby Estalella and Kevin Elster's RBI single.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Giants OF Barry Bonds was held out of the starting lineup
with a deep bone bruise in his right thumb, but was available for
pinch hitting. ... Shawn Green was not in the starting lineup on
Sunday for the first time all season. He did pinch hit in the
seventh and struck out, extending his slump to 3-for-34 (.088). ...
Kent has the most RBIs for the Giants in the first half since Kevin
Mitchell drove in 81 in 1989. ... Dodgers RHP Terry Adams, bothered
by soreness in his right shoulder, hasn't appeared in a game since

<HEADLINE> School districts claim fewer students now allowed to get top score  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HUDSON FALLS, N.Y. (AP) - A small, little noted change in the
way the this year's groundbreaking Regents tests are scored will
allow fewer high school students to reach the ''mastery'' level,
some school officials claim.
</P>
<P>
   And because of the change, school districts could appear to be
doing worse compared to past years because fewer students may reach
the top level scores of 85 percent or better for the English
Regents. Students could also suffer by missing out on a chance for
an honors diploma, risk a lower grade average, or perhaps lose a
college acceptance, according to Glens Falls city schools
Superintendent Thomas McGowan. He is seeking the support of local
legislators to find out why the state changed its method.
</P>
<P>
   With the state's new key, a student who got 89 percent on this
year's test would've gotten a 96 last year, McGowan said.
</P>
<P>
   The district may even offer extra classes for those who might
want to retake the exam in August to raise their score.
</P>
<P>
   State Education Department spokesman William Hirschen did not
immediately know why the change had been made or if many other
districts across the state were upset.
</P>
<P>
   According to the state's new chart, a grid in which scores are
calculated by matching a certain number of points given for essays
with points given for multiple-choice answers, students have 12
chances to score 90 or above this year, compared with 36 chances
last year, according to the Glens Falls Post-Star.
</P>
<P>
   School officials said they were blind-sided by the change, which
they learned about only after they'd scored the exam. The exam is
the first of five being phased in over the next few years that
students have to pass in order to graduate.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Judge, Hudson Falls district assistant superintendent for
instruction, said he's spoken with officials in 10 districts
including top-performing schools and found that the percentage of
students scoring in the mastery level was down.
</P>
<P>
   At Hudson Falls, the number of students achieving the mastery
level was about 30 percent last year and 10 percent this year, he
said.

<HEADLINE> 16 Killed in Chechen Truck Bombing  </HEADLINE>
By YURI BAGROV
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAZRAN, Russia (AP) -- At least 16 people were killed and 38
wounded early Monday when a truck bomb exploded outside a dormitory
housing Russian troops in eastern Chechnya, the Emergency
Situations Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
   Seven people were missing in the rubble of the shattered
building, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion targeted an Interior Ministory dormitory in the
town of Argun, nine miles east of Grozny. It followed weeks of
hit-and-run attacks by Chechen rebels in Russian-controlled
territory, and a five-day battle in the southeastern region of the
breakaway republic that killed at least 13 soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, a truck bomb exploded in front of a Russian military
headquarters in the Chechen town of Urus-Martan, in what Russian
officials said was a suicide bombing.
</P>
<P>
   The truck driver tried to crash the truck into the headquarters
but was prevented and there were no Russian casualties, said Lt.
Gen. Ivan Babichev, a Russian military spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   However, Ramzan Akhmadov, a Chechen guerrilla commander, said by
telephone Sunday that there were Russian dead. He did not specify a
number.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that rebels would soon send explosive-laden trucks
to Argun, Kurchaloi and Novogrozny and Gudermes, where the
pro-Moscow civilian government of Chechnya has its headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials say they have all but won the war to
re-establish control over the rebellious region, but rebels
continue to inflict casualties with mines and ambushes.
</P>
<P>
   In Gudermes, Chechnya's second-largest city, a bomb exploded
Sunday in the attic of a bathhouse where residents and soldiers
were relaxing. Two servicemen and a local woman were wounded, the
ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   Three Russian policemen were killed late Saturday when their car
drove over a homemade land mine at the entrance to a shooting range
in the town of Shelkovskaya, 30 miles northeast of the capital
Grozny, Interior Ministry officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Gunmen also fired for two and a half hours on a military
headquarters in the village of Znamenskoye in the Nadterechny
region, a lowland area the Russians captured last year, police
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Refugees from elsewhere in Chechnya are living in a large camp
in the town, and a three-member team of human rights observers from
the Council of Europe is headquartered there.
</P>
<P>
   Temporary police stations in Argun and the village of
Nadterechnaya were also fired on Saturday night, the officials
said. No Russian casualties were reported in those attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Russian troops on Sunday were carrying out what
officials called ''special operations'' in the towns of Valerik and
Urus-Martan, southwest of Grozny, ITAR-Tass reported. It said the
towns were sealed off, and that 15 people were arrested for taking
part in rebel operations.
</P>
<P>
   Russian troops were driven out of Chechnya in a 1994-96 war.
They returned after Chechnya-based Islamic militants raided several
villages in the neighboring Russian region of Dagestan, and after
about 300 people died in apartment bombings the government blames
on Chechens.

   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- Nilesh Prakash watched in horror as armed
gangs looted and torched his grocery stand on the same day
anti-Indian rebels stormed parliament and took Fiji's Indian-led
government hostage.
</P>
<P>
   ''I looked but I couldn't do anything,'' said the 29-year-old
merchant. ''Some of the men knew us ... but they were all out of
their minds.''
</P>
<P>
   Prakash is one of thousands of ethnic Indians who have been
targeted by a wave of anti-Indian sentiment sweeping this South
Pacific island nation.
</P>
<P>
   The unrest began May 19, when gunmen took the government hostage
in the name of indigenous Fijian rights. They said the ethnic
Indian-led government had too much power and they called for a new
government run by indigenous Fijians.
</P>
<P>
   Indo-Fijians, who make up 44 percent of Fiji's 812,000 people,
are still reeling from attacks on Indian homes and businesses that
took place in the wake of the parliament raid.
</P>
<P>
   Reacting to the coup attempt and the violence, the army took
power 10 days later. On Sunday, the army defied the hostage-takers,
saying it would appoint a temporary government that would include
Indians.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, however, an interim government was installed without
any members of Fiji's Indian minority. Commodore Frank Bainimarama,
the military commander who assumed power, said two members of the
Indian community were asked to join but declined.
</P>
<P>
   The military has conceded to almost all of the hostage-takers'
demands to disenfranchise Fiji's Indian population, leaving
Indo-Fijians with a grave sense of insecurity in a nation they have
always called home.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can't sleep at night. They throw stones at us, rob us,
attack us,'' said Mousam Ali, a 44-year-old vendor. ''We want to
leave because we are fed up. But we have nowhere to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Reminders of the Indians' plight are everywhere in Fiji today:
gutted Indian shops, burnt-out Indian restaurants, Indians locking
themselves indoors to protect their children, a refugee camp in
western Fiji filled with 250 Indians who fled rural violence after
the parliament raid.
</P>
<P>
   Fiji has been struggling to come to terms with its ethnic
diversity ever since English colonialists brought indentured
laborers from India in the 1880s to work in the nation's rich sugar
cane fields.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-Indian sentiment was unleashed a year ago when a trade
union leader named Mahendra Chaudhry became Fiji's first prime
minister of Indian descent. He was elected in balloting that many
Fijians found confusing because, for the first time, they voted for
party lists instead of individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Chaudhry is now among 27 members of the ousted government who
have been held hostage in parliament for 44 days. During his
yearlong tenure as prime minister, he angered many indigenous
Fijians by refusing to allow higher rents to be charged to Indian
sugar cane farmers on land owned communally by indigenous Fijians.
</P>
<P>
   George Speight, the hostage-takers' leader, has capitalized on
this anger in what he calls a battle for the rights of indigenous
Fijians.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Chaudhry actually trampled on indigenous rights is
debatable, but it's clear he trampled on corrupt business practices
that were rampant in the previous, Fijian-led government. Speight
himself was a casualty of the Chaudhry administration, which fired
him as head of a powerful timber commission amid suspicion of
influence peddling.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, television footage showed a haggard-looking Chaudhry
pacing the grounds where he has been a hostage for more than six
weeks. The deposed prime minister, who walked with his head turned
downward, appeared to have lost weight.
</P>
<P>
   Whether they took Chaudhry's government hostage out of greed or
conviction, Speight and his gunmen have found fertile ground in
deep-seated resentment of Indians. The Indian population here tends
to be more affluent than the indigenous Fijians.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can see that the ethnic rhetoric is a very powerful one.
And scapegoating is actually even more powerful,'' said Vijay
Naidu, who heads the development studies program at the University
of the South Pacific in the Fijian capital, Suva.
</P>
<P>
   Fiji is paying an enormous price for its break with democracy.
With negotiations to free the hostages deadlocked over an 11th-hour
demand by Speight's group to name a new president, the economy has
entered a downward spiral that could take years to reverse.
</P>
<P>
   And many of Fiji's best and brightest are fleeing.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bad news is that the most able, the wealthiest, the
educated, they will find a way to get out. And what will remain
here are the voiceless, the peasants, the taxi drivers, the small
shop keepers,'' said Osman Siddique, the U.S. ambassador to Fiji.
</P>
<P>
   Indo-Fijians are quick to point out that they are not all rich,
and that their roots in Fiji go back more than a century. Their
quest for political equality in the years since has been largely
unsuccessful, with their greatest advance -- the 1997 constitution --
now abolished.
</P>
<P>
   ''Fiji is going in reverse,'' said Prakash, the grocery vendor.
Added his wife, Sumintra: ''We're still very frightened.''

<HEADLINE> Schools Must Learn About Teachers  </HEADLINE>
By ANJETTA McQUEEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Jonathan Hunter started his teaching job
four years ago in high demand. He was young, trained to teach
bilingual students and wanted to work in an urban district. For
him, it could have all been about money.
</P>
<P>
   ''They offer the bonuses and the health club memberships and the
higher salaries,'' Hunter, a Philadelphia high school English
teacher, said Sunday at the annual convention of the American
Federation of Teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of the bidding-for-teachers trend driven by record
shortages, Hunter said, recruiters ''really need to offer more
support from the administration and better resources.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Or maybe there just needs to be some good P.R. for the
profession,'' Hunter, 28, added.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. school systems are looking to hire 2.2 million new teachers
in the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska is offering them gym memberships and moving expenses.
California is raising their pay by about $7,000. Massachusetts
wants to promise them even better pensions than their predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   States and localities are fighting mass retirements, stagnant
salaries and competition from more lucrative fields, but veteran
educators worry that beyond the costly new carrots, little thought
is given how to keep beginning teachers in the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're losing almost as many as we get,'' said Carnell
Washington, who trains student teachers at a high school in East
Baton Rouge, La. ''The young teachers today are not like your more
seasoned teachers. They are constantly being recruited by
industries, by other agencies or by other systems that offer more
money. They need more reasons to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the American Federation of Teachers say a new plan
up for a vote at the convention this week would increase
requirements for teacher trainees and ''professionalize'' the job
for thousands of young candidates turned off by lack of pay and
respect.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can have a hiring bonus, but it doesn't get at the root of
the problem,'' said Celia Lose, a spokeswoman for the
1-million-member union. ''It's not enough to keep people in such a
demanding profession.''
</P>
<P>
   The teacher quality plan -- which includes mandatory testing for
teaching candidates and new hires -- would draw quality people who
are committed and deserving of higher pay, Lose said. Some teachers
worry about the high stakes attached to the proposal, but Lose
expects members to approve it.
</P>
<P>
   The AFT and the larger National Education Association, holding
similar votes in Chicago, meet annually to decide what policies
members will follow in class and at the bargaining table.
</P>
<P>
   More than one-third of teachers will quit before the end of a
third year of teaching, Education Department figures show. The
newest teachers tend to be paid less and assigned to classrooms
that veterans pass over.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter said recruits are wary of school district politics,
classroom discipline or lower pay -- especially in the neediest
areas. ''They'd rather be on a waiting list as a substitute in the
suburbs, than for a full-time position in the inner cities.''
</P>
<P>
   New teachers have much to offer, their older colleagues say.
They might relate better to students because they're familiar with
fashion, lingo and issues. They are more technologically savvy,
acquainted with the latest education research or more willing to
try new things.
</P>
<P>
   Districts also must consider what new teachers don't have,
veterans said. When Washington trained for the profession 28 years
ago, he spent an entire semester student teaching. New recruits, he
said, spend about six weeks in a class -- with him or some other
mentor.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not giving them a full classroom perspective,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Washington, who is executive vice president of the AFT's East
Baton Rouge unit, said unions as well as districts have a role in
cultivating beginners: ''If we are going to recruit and attract new
teachers, we need to give young teachers more leadership roles.''

<HEADLINE> AIDS Threatens S. African Economy  </HEADLINE>
By RAVI NESSMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   KATLEHONG, South Africa (AP) -- A group of 20 teen-age boys
jostle for the ball during a carefree afternoon soccer game. In the
coming years, half of those exuberant children will die a slow
death from AIDS if statistics hold, triggering a devastating
demographic catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   The population is projected to stop growing, businesses to be
crushed and the continent's most developed economy to be badly
damaged.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a disaster,'' said Marothi Ramaube, an official with
the South African Business Council on HIV/AIDS. ''We know it's
massive. How massive we don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 4.2 million South Africans, 10 percent of the
population, are currently infected with AIDS or the virus that
causes AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   That number is expected to double by 2006, with many becoming
infected as they enter what should be their most productive years.
</P>
<P>
   If the disease is not reined in, more than half of all the
15-year-old boys in South Africa will die of AIDS in their
lifetime, according to a United Nations study released Tuesday in
advance of the 13th International AIDS Conference, which starts
Sunday in the coastal city of Durban.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many 15-year-olds playing soccer in the township of
Katlehong east of Johannesburg, Sbusiso Dibitso is fully aware of
the risk. His 27-year-old sister, Tseleng, died of AIDS last July.
</P>
<P>
   Though he did not use a condom the first time he had sex last
year, he has ever since, he said. But many of his classmates have
yet to see someone they care for die of the disease, and they don't
really believe it exists.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm worried about my friends,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   South Africa's business community is worried as well.
</P>
<P>
   Posters warning of AIDS adorn company bulletin boards, jars of
free condoms sit in front of their nurses' offices and companies
have trained thousands of their workers, and many of the
prostitutes their workers visit, to teach others how to avoid the
disease.
</P>
<P>
   The state-owned power company, Eskom, spends $600,000 a year
educating its 31,000 employees about AIDS, said Liz Thebe, head of
Eskom's AIDS program.
</P>
<P>
   But the company discovered an alarming rate of infection among
the scholarship students -- the future leaders of the company -- it
is paying millions of dollars a year to send to college. So it is
sending them to AIDS-awareness seminars as well.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are worried. Who are you going to employ?'' Thebe said.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses are beginning to face other, more costly, worries,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   As workers take more sick days, businesses will have to hire
extra staff.
</P>
<P>
   As they become gravely ill, employers will have to spend more on
medical insurance.
</P>
<P>
   As they die, companies will have to pay to train new employees,
many of whom will also die of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Customers will die as well.
</P>
<P>
   The effects on the economy, already struggling to overcome
apartheid's legacy of poverty, will be reminiscent of a tragic
natural disaster or an apocalyptic war, said Kristina Quattek,
chief economist at ING-Barings, South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   But those nightmares end.
</P>
<P>
   ''This whole AIDS scenario will only drag on,'' Quattek said.
</P>
<P>
   By 2006, South Africa's Gross Domestic Product is expected to be
3.1 percent lower annually than it would have been without AIDS,
according to a study by ING-Barings. By 2011, it will be 4.7
percent lower.
</P>
<P>
   More than one-quarter of the labor force will be infected by
2006, and the country's population will be less than 50 million in
2015, instead of more than 60 million, because of AIDS, according
to the Actuarial Society of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   With many families losing their wage-earners, South Africans
will be spending significantly less money -- except when it comes to
health care, according to ING-Barings. The government will be
forced to spend more of its scarce resources on health care, as
well.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the crisis, the government has issued a five-year
plan to combat the disease, stressing prevention, increased
voluntary testing and improved care for those already infected.
</P>
<P>
   Even if that campaign is wildly successful, ''you still can't
stop the whole epidemic in its tracks,'' Quattek said.
</P>
<P>
   Large companies, many of whom are quickly automating to soften
the blow, will likely survive, although they may be far less
profitable.
</P>
<P>
   Small businesses, however, depend more on their individual
employees and may collapse when a key manager, or even the owner,
succumbs to the disease, said Ramaube, of the business council on
HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that, many small businesses are completely unprepared
for the AIDS crisis, said Zackie Achmat, chairman of the AIDS
Treatment Action Campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Even big businesses are ignoring the full extent of the problem,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''In terms of PR, they're really good. In terms of producing
glossy material saying, 'AIDS kills. Use a condom,' they're really
good,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   They are not doing well when it comes to funding AIDS research --
to help fight the disease itself -- or negotiating medical policies
with insurance companies -- to keep their workers healthy longer.
</P>
<P>
   The business community must quickly develop a better plan for
dealing with AIDS, Achmat said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They cannot avoid it,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> New Fiji Civilian Government Named  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN GUTKIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- Fiji's military leader appointed a temporary
civilian government Monday in defiance of hostages takers who had
demanded a role in naming it, but said he would remain head of
state until the hostages are released.
</P>
<P>
   Notably absent from the new government lineup were members of
Fiji's Indian minority, who have been stripped of most political
power since rebels stormed parliament on May 19 and took the
Indian-led government hostage.
</P>
<P>
   ''We approached two well-qualified members of the Indian
community but they declined,'' said Commodore Frank Bainimarama,
the military commander who assumed power in the South Pacific
nation 10 days after the parliament raid.
</P>
<P>
   A banking executive named Laisenia Qarase was named as prime
minister. He has been head of the Merchant Bank Fiji and is a
former general manager of the Fiji Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Qarase is known more as a manager than a politician. George
Speight, the former insurance executive who is leading the rebels
holding 27 members of the ousted government hostage, has spoken
positively of Qarase in recent days. However, Qarase was not
Speight's first choice for prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Bainimarama said the interim government will rule for 18 months
during which time it will draft a new constitution.
</P>
<P>
   After the raid on parliament, the army gave in to most of
Speight's demands to disenfranchise Fiji's ethnic Indians,
including firing Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry -- now a hostage --
and throwing out the country's 1997 multiracial constitution.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Bainimarama said that constitution ''will not be
reinstated.''
</P>
<P>
   During a press conference in the capital of Suva, Bainimarama
said the new constitution should contain provisions to lift Fiji's
poor indigenous majority, but also ''the protection of the rights
of Indians and other communities that are an integral part of our
nation.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he will remain head of state until all the hostages are
safely released, the gunmen's weapons are turned over, and public
order is fully restored. The daily business of government will be
left to the interim government, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I remain open to further dialogue with George Speight and his
group,'' Bainimarama said. ''I appeal to them in the name of
almighty God to do the right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, the army announced it will tighten a military
cordon around the parliamentary compound where the hostages are
held.
</P>
<P>
   The tightening will entail a greater military presence in the
area and the restriction of access to and from the compound, army
spokesman Lt. Alipate Mataitini told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Talks to free the hostages broke down last week over what the
army said was an 11th-hour demand by Speight's group that it be
allowed to name a new president.
</P>
<P>
   Indians were first brought to Fiji over a century ago by English
colonialists seeking indentured laborers in the country's rich
sugar cane fields. They make up about 44 percent of Fiji's
population, while indigenous Fijians account for about 51 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions rose in recent months between Indians and indigenous
Fijians after Chaudhry fought moves by Fijian landowners to raise
rents on land leased to Indians.

Chechnya, the Emergency Situations Ministry said late Monday. Seven people were

   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Opposition candidate Vicente Fox won Mexico's

party's 71-year lock on the presidency. The victory was almost unthinkable for
many in Mexico, where the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, has
been synonymous with the government -- and even the nation itself -- to millions
of supporters and detractors alike. Election officials' preliminary results
''are sufficient and trustworthy enough to say that the next president of the

   RICHLAND, Wash. (AP) -- Workers at the Hanford nuclear reservation were
allowed to return Sunday, following a 191,000-acre fire that disrupted thousands
of lives and raised fears about possible radiation releases. Meanwhile, hundreds
of firefighters drafted from around the region had returned home, leaving a few
local firefighters to ensure hot spots would not flare up. Hanford managers, who
had barred all but a few essential workers from the site during the crisis, said
Sunday that all employees could return. Tomorrow, most of the site's 10,000
workers will resume the task of cleaning up nuclear waste at Hanford, which
contains the nation's largest volume of such wastes.

Israeli military outpost at the border fence separating Lebanon and Israel.
Witnesses said the window of a passing armored Israeli jeep was broken, but
Israeli soldiers did not respond with gunfire as they have in the past at the

House Would Mull Suspending Gas Tax

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House would likely go along if the Senate votes to

for highway construction, the House majority leader says. At any rate, Rep. Dick
Armey said, suspending the tax would be a temporary fix to a permanent problem
of high gasoline prices. More helpful would be to augment the natural gas
delivery system, deal more forcefully with foreign oil suppliers and cut down on
oil imports, he said on ''Fox News Sunday.''

<HEADLINE> Co-developer of vaccine to lead UR gene center  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - A developer of a vaccine for childhood
bacterial meningitis has been selected to lead the Center for Human
Genetics and Molecular Pediatric Disease at the University of
Rochester.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Richard A. Insel and a team of 12 scientists will study
diseases that are caused by damaged genes. The team will focus on
diseases that affect children, such as birth defects, asthma,
cystic fibrosis and diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   The research center is part of University's Aab Institute of
Biomedical Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   Insel, a pediatric immunologist, has served as director of the
Strong Children's Research Center since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, he was one of three University of Rochester
researchers who developed the vaccine against Haemophilus influenza
type b, the disease that is a leading cause of meningitis in young
children.
</P>
<P>
   As the immunologist on the research team, Insel's role was to
study the immune response produced by the vaccine and to help the
researchers refine the vaccine to make it more effective.
</P>
<P>
   The vaccine is known as the Hib vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the
vaccine caused Hib infections in children under 5 to plummet 99
percent in the United States between 1987 to 1997 - from about
20,000 cases a year to 81.

<P>
   NEW YORK - More ships and boats from Brooklyn to New Jersey and
Verazzano to Manhattan were expected to arrive today in New York
Harbor to join the aircraft carrier USS John F. Kennedy, which
dropped anchor near the Statue of Liberty.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Coast Guard has estimated as many as 70,000 small craft
might show up for the city's nautical Fourth of July extravaganza.
</P>
<P>
   Some 150 sailing ships from 23 countries and 25 naval ships from
14 nations will take part in the dual event - Operation Sail 2000
and an International Naval Review, the sixth in just over a
century.
</P>
<P>
   Skies over the harbor were abuzz with military helicopters, and
small groups of white-uniformed sailors on shore leave were the
vanguard of an expected throng of some 28,000 seafarers for the
weeklong celebration. Some 3,000 to 4,000 small craft already were
at moorings in the harbor and shore marinas Sunday, Coast Guard
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no question that this will be the largest assemblage
ever of tall ships and naval vessels,'' said Greg Perrin, vice
president of OpSail 2000.
</P>
<P>
   While the stately sailing ships are the main attraction, Navy
officials originally had planned for history's largest naval
review, with 61 nations invited to take part. That was scaled back
to a more modest 50 entries, but the event appeared to be falling
well short of any chance to break the record of 25 navies
represented at the 1986 Statue of Liberty centennial.
</P>
<P>
   Although the official list given out to news organizations said
36 ships would take part in the review, a list provided by Berzins
showed only 25 - 10 from the United States, two from Canada and two
from Japan, plus one each from Ireland, Britain, Ukraine, India,
Greece, France, Italy, Brazil, South Africa, Singapore and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Navy spokesmen said they couldn't explain the discrepancy.
</P>
<P>
   While many ships will be visiting Gotham for the first time, the
Norfolk, Va.-based Kennedy is no stranger. Commissioned in 1968 as
the Navy's last conventionally powered carrier, it has participated
in the city's annual Fleet Week festivities for a decade. The
Navy's eight newer, nuclear-powered carriers are not allowed in New
York harbor.
</P>
<P>
   The JFK, 80,000 tons and 1,052 feet long, anchored at midday
Sunday just south of the Statue of Liberty, near the amphibious
assault ship USS Nassau, a helicopter carrier that arrived on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   On July 4, President Clinton will inspect the 11-mile line of
warships in the Hudson River from aboard the missile cruiser USS
Hue City, then transfer by Coast Guard cutter to the JFK, where he
will view the ''parade of sail'' from the flight deck.
</P>
<P>
   The Hue City, one of the Navy's powerful, billion-dollar
Aegis-type cruisers, steamed up the harbor late Sunday, bound for a
Hudson River pier near the Intrepid, a famed World War II carrier
turned military museum. The Hue City is the only U.S. Navy ship
named for a Vietnam War battle.
</P>
<P>
   The all-day harbor activities will be capped at night by what
organizers call the largest fireworks display ever: 60 tons of
explosives launched from barges at five locations, capped by a
grand finale blast near the Statue of Liberty. Organizers say as
many as 4 million people may see some part of the day aboard
watercraft or from vantage points in New York and New Jersey.

<HEADLINE> 20 Killed in Chechen Truck Bombing  </HEADLINE>
By LYOMA TURPALOV
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARGUN, Russia (AP) -- At least 20 people were killed and 81
wounded when a truck bomb exploded outside a dormitory housing
Russian troops in eastern Chechnya, the Emergency Situations
Ministry said late Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Seven people were missing in the rubble of the shattered
building, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
   It was the highest toll yet in a series of bombings and ambushes
that Chechnya's agile rebels have unleashed on Russian troops and
pro-Moscow Chechen officials over the past month. Rebel leaders
have said the attacks are intended are in reply to Russian
officials' frequent claims that the war in Chechnya is all but
over.
</P>
<P>
   The attack Sunday night targeted an Interior Ministory dormitory
in the town of Argun, nine miles east of Grozny. A special police
unit from the Ural Mountains region of Chelabinsk was staying in
the building.
</P>
<P>
   Vasara Vesitaya, a worker in the dormitory cafeteria, left for
home three minutes before the blast. She said that she believed
dozens of corpses were trapped in the rubble.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after midnight, Russian helicopters opened fire on
residential areas of Argun and hit a refugee camp. Eleven refugees
were wounded, including eight who required immediate surgery,
doctors said.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, a truck bomb exploded in front of a Russian military
headquarters in the Chechen town of Urus-Martan, in what Russian
officials said was a suicide bombing.
</P>
<P>
   The truck driver tried to crash the truck into the headquarters
but was prevented and there were no Russian casualties, said Lt.
Gen. Ivan Babichev, a Russian military spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   However, Ramzan Akhmadov, a Chechen guerrilla commander, said by
telephone Sunday that there were Russian dead. He did not specify a
number.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that rebels would soon send explosive-laden trucks
to Argun, Kurchaloi and Novogrozny and Gudermes, where the
pro-Moscow civilian government of Chechnya has its headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials say they have all but won the war to
re-establish control over the rebellious region, but rebels
continue to inflict casualties with mines and ambushes.
</P>
<P>
   In Gudermes, Chechnya's second-largest city, a bomb exploded
Sunday in the attic of a bathhouse where residents and soldiers
were relaxing. Two servicemen and a local woman were wounded, the
ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   Three Russian policemen were killed late Saturday when their car
drove over a homemade land mine at the entrance to a shooting range
in the town of Shelkovskaya, 30 miles northeast of the capital
Grozny, Interior Ministry officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Gunmen also fired for two and a half hours on a military
headquarters in the village of Znamenskoye in the Nadterechny
region, a lowland area the Russians captured last year, police
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Refugees from elsewhere in Chechnya are living in a large camp
in the town, and a three-member team of human rights observers from
the Council of Europe is headquartered there.
</P>
<P>
   Temporary police stations in Argun and the village of
Nadterechnaya were also fired on Saturday night, the officials
said. No Russian casualties were reported in those attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Russian troops on Sunday were carrying out what
officials called ''special operations'' in the towns of Valerik and
Urus-Martan, southwest of Grozny, ITAR-Tass reported. It said the
towns were sealed off, and that 15 people were arrested for taking
part in rebel operations.
</P>
<P>
   Russian troops were driven out of Chechnya in a 1994-96 war.
They returned after Chechnya-based Islamic militants raided several
villages in the neighboring Russian region of Dagestan, and after
about 300 people died in apartment bombings the government blames
on Chechens.

<HEADLINE> Vicente Fox Voted Mexico President  </HEADLINE>
By NIKO PRICE
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Opposition candidate Vicente Fox won Mexico's
presidential elections Sunday in a stunning victory that ended the
ruling party's 71-year lock on the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   The victory was almost unthinkable for many in Mexico, where the
ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, has been
synonymous with the government -- and even the nation itself -- to
millions of supporters and detractors alike.
</P>
<P>
   With 37 percent of the official count tallied, Fox had 46.2
percent, the PRI's Francisco Labastida had 32.7 percent and leftist
candidate Cuauhtemoc Cardenas had 16.2 percent. Official
projections of the final count also showed Fox the clear winner.
</P>
<P>
   The results herald enormous political and social changes for a
country where nobody alive had ever seen a governing party lose a
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   ''The elections are a clear expression of the maturity of our
country,'' Fox said at his campaign headquarters. ''We have crossed
the bridge of a change in power peacefully and legally. Today we
are on the other side of the bridge, and a new path begins.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox assured Mexicans there would be a calm transition. He will
take power on Dec. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ''From today forward, we need to unite. ... We have to work
together to make Mexico the great country we have all dreamed of,''
he said. ''Let's celebrate today, because beginning tomorrow
there's a lot of work to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox traveled to the gilded angel of Mexico City's Independence
Monument, where thousands of supporters were waving the
blue-and-white flag of the National Action Party, blowing into
plastic trumpets and beating drums.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a historic moment for this country,'' said Carlos
Juamblez, 45. ''Really, we didn't believe it. It's a dream come
true.''
</P>
<P>
   A mariachi band greeted Fox by playing Las Mananitas, the
traditional Mexican birthday song. Fox turned 58 on election day.
</P>
<P>
   President Ernesto Zedillo was the first to announce Fox's
victory, saying election officials' preliminary results ''are
sufficient and trustworthy enough to say that the next president of
the republic will be Vicente Fox. ... I have telephoned him to
express my sincere congratulations.''
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, Labastida effectively conceded defeat, saying:
''The citizens have made a decision that we should respect, and
I'll set the example myself.''
</P>
<P>
   The PRI also appeared to have lost three key local races,
according to exit polls by the television networks. The exit polls
showed the leftist Democratic Revolution Party holding onto Mexico
City's mayorship and National Action capturing the governorship of
Morelos state from the PRI, and holding onto the governorship of
Fox's home state of Guanajuato.
</P>
<P>
   The vote was the first in more than a century in which the
outcome wasn't clear beforehand. Despite hundreds of allegations of
pressure and vote-buying -- most perpetrated by the ruling party --
the elections were widely seen as Mexico's fairest ever.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning early in the morning, long lines formed at voting
booths, evidence of a heavy turnout. Frustrated voters clashed with
election workers in Mexico City when some booths for people casting
ballots outside their home districts ran out of absentee ballots
shortly after noon with hundreds still in line.
</P>
<P>
   Fox is a former Coca-Cola executive and rancher who was elected
governor of central Guanajuato in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   He pledges to halt corruption, jump-start the economy with
foreign investment and jobs programs and nearly double spending for
public education. He espouses an agreement with the United States
that would let workers cross the border freely.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling party standard-bearer, Labastida ran a largely
traditional campaign after a landslide victory in the party's first
presidential primary in November. He promised more aid for the
countryside, more resources for public education and more attention
to the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas, a veteran leftist leader who finished in third place,
was in his third presidential campaign. Many Mexicans believe he
won the 1988 elections, only to be cheated out of a victory by
fraud.
</P>
<P>
   This year's campaign was remarkably fair by Mexican standards
and opposition parties had unprecedented access to advertising and
news coverage.
</P>
<P>
   A record 10,000 local poll watchers and 860 foreign observers
were at the polling places Sunday to prevent fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Observer groups and opposition parties charged that local PRI
officials gave gifts in return for promised votes or warned poor
people government aid would be cut off if they backed the
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   But the head of the Federal Electoral Institute, Jose
Woldenberg, said problems were the exception. He said his workers
''tell us we are experiencing exemplary elections.''

<HEADLINE> Mexicans Head South To Cast Ballots  </HEADLINE>
By BEN FOX
<TEXT>
<P>
   TIJUANA, Mexico (AP) -- Despite late-opening polling stations and
long lines that barely edged forward in the stifling heat,
thousands of Mexicans living in the United States jammed special
election booths across the border to vote in Mexico's national
elections Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Perhaps we can contribute to a change in our country,'' said
28-year-old economist Eduardo Soriano, who drove from San Francisco
to Tijuana with his parents and two sisters.
</P>
<P>
   Estimates of the number of Mexican citizens who live in the
United States vary from 7 million and 10 million. The Federal
Electoral Institute says 1.5 million have valid voting cards.
</P>
<P>
   But Jorge Santibanez, a Tijuana immigration researcher, said
about 80 percent of those do not have legal residency in the United
States, and were unlikely to risk arrest by crossing the border to
vote.
</P>
<P>
   Even if all eligible voters wanted to cast ballots, they
couldn't: Each of the 64 special booths established in the six
border states was limited to 750 ballots for a total of 48,000, due
to federal regulations intended to prevent multiple or fraudulent
voting.
</P>
<P>
   The election was widely seen as the most competitive ever, with
Vicente Fox of the center-right National Action Party defeated
Francisco Labastida, the candidate of the ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
</P>
<P>
   However, immigration researcher Santibanez said that even if
Mexicans living abroad cast all 48,000 special ballots, they
wouldn't have much sway in a race with 58.7 million eligible
voters.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think their ballots will carry much weight,''
Santibanez said.
</P>
<P>
   That didn't dull the enthusiasm of voters who walked, drove or
joined political caravans to cast their votes.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's important this time,'' said Rigoberto Mendieta, a
construction worker from Austin, Texas, who leaned against the wall
of a Nuevo Laredo bus station waiting for his turn to vote. ''I
left Mexico because there wasn't any work. We need a change in
government and this time we might get one.''
</P>
<P>
   Tijuana, a sprawling city of more than 1 million people across
the border from San Diego, had just 15 of the polling booths, and a
total of 11,250 ballots.
</P>
<P>
   Lines of 300 people snaked around the makeshift polling booths.
Voters fanned themselves, smoked cigarettes and bounced their
babies during the hours-long wait to vote.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very poorly organized,'' said Reina Salinas, 50. ''I have
to get back to San Diego to go to Mass.''
</P>
<P>
   Voter frustration was exacerbated when many polling stations
opened up to an hour late due to logistical problems and the
inexperience of polling officials.
</P>
<P>
   At Tijuana's bus station, 400 people waited in line at a polling
booth where only 200 ballots remained. The shortages also affected
booths in post offices, on main avenues and at the airport in
Tijuana.
</P>
<P>
   Ciudad Juarez, across El Paso, Texas, fared even worse, with
just three ballot boxes, or 2,250 ballots.
</P>
<P>
   The limited ballots had to suffice not only for those traveling
from north of the border to vote, but also active duty soldiers,
factory workers and others living in Mexico away from their home
districts.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wanted to be sure I got a ballot,'' said Joel Hernandez, a
vacationing Bible teacher from Guanajuato who stepped into a nearly
deserted Nuevo Laredo plaza just after dawn. ''I was afraid there
would be thousands and thousands of people coming here from the
United States.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, vacationers and migrant workers far outnumbered U.S.
residents at many of the special voting centers.

<HEADLINE> D.C.'s Monuments Coping With Change  </HEADLINE>
By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two centuries ago this month the government,
moving in from the old federal capital in Philadelphia, marked the
first celebration of Independence Day in a new and permanent
federal city.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a brief status report on some of Washington's monuments
and landmarks and how they are blending change and continuity at
the close of two centuries of federal rule on the banks of the
Potomac:
</P>
<P>
   --The White House: In July 1800, the carpenters and plasterers
were still working to make the House livable for John and Abigail
Adams. The presidential couple were to move into the
still-unfinished, damp, cold and barnlike house in November.
</P>
<P>
   Two centuries of hard use later, initial design approval has
been obtained for a $300 million underground expansion threaded by
tunnels that would better accommodate tourists, ease staff parking,
create a new press center, provide indoor recreational space for
the first family, create an education center as part of an expanded
tourist facility and even handle the motorcades of visiting heads
of state. Completion would take 20 years. Congress must rule on all
of it.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's a major investment of time and money. On the other
hand, there is only one White House and maintaining it deserves our
best effort,'' said James McDaniel, liaison from the National Park
Service to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   --The U.S. Capitol: The trademark cast-iron, white-painted dome,
a national emblem since its completion during the Civil War, is
under repair to fix cracks and leaks. And ground has been broken
for the largest construction project at the Capitol since work
began in the 1850s on the high dome and marble wings for the House
and Senate. The aim is to build a three-level underground tourist
reception center in the open green between the Capitol and the
Supreme Court building. The five-year project is expected to cost
$265 million and to be paid for in part by private contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Driven by security concerns, the center will provide space to
screen tourists well away from the Capitol itself. The new space
also will feature restaurants and museum quality exhibit space
exploring the history of the Capitol and Congress.
</P>
<P>
   --The Washington Monument: The centerpiece of any Independence
Day celebration in the capital, the white marble shaft recently
emerged from a web of scaffolding installed as part of an exterior
and interior restoration project. A new elevator cab is being
installed and tourists will not be allowed into the monument until
July 31. Over the past three years, at a cost of $10 million,
structural damage to the monument has been repaired, its
observation windows replaced and its cooling, heating and elevator
systems repaired.
</P>
<P>
   The history of the monument, which has become the rallying point
for great national demonstrations and celebrations, is told in a
new and comprehensive book: ''The Washington Monument: It Stands
for All,'' by Thomas Allen, published by Discovery Books. In an
introduction, historian Stephen E. Ambrose writes: ''It is there
that we come together to protest and persuade. It is there, above
any other place, that we have the monument that stands for our
greatest national strength, and that symbolizes our greatest
national pride, our unity.''
</P>
<P>
   --The Star-Spangled Banner: The country's most celebrated flag is
undergoing a stitch-by-stitch examination and repair in a dust-free
laboratory room at the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of
American History. The aim is to strengthen and preserve the banner
for another two centuries, at least, and possibly for a millennium
or more. The public can watch the work through large glass walls
during normal museum hours.
</P>
<P>
   The flag's history, including the bombardment that inspired
Frances Scott Key to jot down verses, has been published by the
museum and Harry N. Abrams Inc. It is entitled, ''The Star-Spangled
Banner, The Flag that Inspired the National Anthem.''
</P>
<P>
   --The Charters of Freedom: The Declaration of Independence will
be read from the steps of the National Archives on Tuesday morning.
The Archives already has begun work on a new titanium and glass
casing system intended to preserve the Declaration, the
Constitution and the Bill of Rights through the next millennium.
The Archives rotunda, where the charters are shown, will close for
renovation at the end of next year's Independence Day observation
and reopen on July 4, 2003.

<HEADLINE> Bush as Jet Pilot  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS WILLIAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- When George W. Bush joined the Texas Air
National Guard in 1968, there was little chance he would ever see
Vietnam from the cockpit of his F-102 Delta Dagger jet fighter.
</P>
<P>
   When the plane was in demand overseas, Bush was not yet
qualified to fly it. By the time he passed his final combat flight
test in June 1970, the Air Force was pulling the jets out of
Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the Texas governor and presumptive Republican presidential
nominee, said in his autobiography that he and a friend, Fred
Bailey, tried to join the Palace Alert program that rotated
National Guard pilots into Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   A colonel told them only a few more pilots would go and ''Fred
and I had not logged enough hours to participate,'' Bush wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Retired Col. Maury Udell, who trained Bush to fly the F-102, has
no doubt his pupil was willing to go to Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Udell agreed that Bush was too inexperienced for Palace Alert,
but he said the young man did become a good fighter pilot. ''George
got really good in air-to-air combat,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Udell, now a 270-pound judo expert who describes himself as a
''war-type guy,'' said Bush had an extraordinary memory and ability
to process information.
</P>
<P>
   From Udell's perspective, Bush's ability to overcome his
aristocratic schooling at Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass., and
Yale University and mix with the other guardsmen was more
impressive.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is OK to get a good education, but some of those people are
a little off the wall,'' he said. ''I just wanted to make sure that
he was in it for real.''
</P>
<P>
   Udell said he spent six hours a day for six months training
Bush. And that's not all.
</P>
<P>
   ''We would go to the bar and play dead bug just like everybody
else,'' he said. When someone yelled ''dead bug'' the pilots would
hit the floor and stick their hands and feet up in the air.
</P>
<P>
   ''The last guy to do that has to buy the next round,'' Udell
said, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was really good with folks,'' he said. But the young pilot
did not take insults well: ''You can't put him down too easily.
He's really tough. He'll fight you.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's commanders were equally pleased with the young officer.
The Associated Press reviewed several glowing annual evaluations
along with about 200 pages of Bush's military record.
</P>
<P>
   ''Lt. Bush is an exceptional fighter interceptor pilot and
officer,'' Maj. William Harris wrote on May 26, 1972, in a typical
example. ''Lt. Bush's major strength is his ability to work with
others.''
</P>
<P>
   In his autobiography, Bush writes that he was proud of his
service in the Texas National Guard but does not liken it to facing
combat as many of his contemporaries did.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know it was nothing comparable to what our soldiers and
pilots were doing in battle in Vietnam,'' he said. ''I lost several
friends there, pilots I trained with in flight school.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether former President Bush helped his son get into the Guard
to avoid Vietnam has been an ongoing controversy. The younger Bush
maintains there was no undue influence.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can tell you what happened,'' he said last September.
''Nothing happened. My Guard unit was looking for pilots and I flew
for the Guard.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm proud of my service and any allegation that my dad asked
for special favors is simply not true ... I didn't ask anybody to
help get me to the Guard, either.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Ben Barnes, who was Texas lieutenant governor in 1968,
said in a sworn statement last year that he had received a call
from the now-deceased oilman Sidney Adger, a Bush family friend.
</P>
<P>
   Adger allegedly asked Barnes to recommend the younger Bush for
the Guard. ''Barnes called Gen. (James) Rose (Texas Air Guard
commander) and did so,'' said a 1999 statement by Barnes' lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes said through the attorney that last year there was no
indication that either of the Bushes knew about the call.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was not the only son of the rich and powerful of both
parties to get a spot in the Texas Guard. His unit near Houston was
sometimes called the Champagne Unit because of its famous names.
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd Bentsen III, a first lieutenant and son of the future
senator and Cabinet secretary, was there. So was Capt. John
Connally III, son of the former governor and Cabinet secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spent most of his time in the Guard based near Houston, but
in May 1972 he received a three-month assignment in Alabama so he
could work on a political campaign.
</P>
<P>
   While serving as political director of the Senate campaign of
Winton ''Red'' Blount, a family friend, he was ordered to report
for duty at the 187th Tactical Recon Unit in Montgomery, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   The 187th did not fly F-102s, so Bush did not go to the base as
a pilot. After missing a required physical exam and being out of
the cockpit so long, he lost his flight credentials in Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   Retired Gen. William Turnipseed, now 71, a commander at the
base, has said he never saw Bush appear for duty. Bush, however,
says he remembers meeting Turnipseed and performing drills at the
base.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was there. I was in the unit,'' he said last Wednesday when
asked about it.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's campaign staff has searched for records that would show
he was actually there. They have decided that none of those records
survived and they now are looking for eyewitnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Lloyd Jr., who was personnel director for the Texas
National Guard from 1969 to 1995, said it would have taken several
weeks for Bush to requalify for the F-102 once he returned to
Ellington Air Force Base in December, and the Guard was already
phasing out the plane. Also, Bush had said he planned to leave the
Guard for Harvard Business School.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you stop to think about it, why expend dollars on
somebody who you are not going to keep?'' Lloyd said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spent about eight more months in the Guard before he was
put on inactive duty, six months early, in October 1973, according
to records obtained by The Associated Press.

<HEADLINE> Gore Gets Tougher on Big Drug Cos.  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE GLOVER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore, fresh from an attack
on big oil, is toughening his assault on drug manufacturers by
blaming ''drug company price-gouging'' for the soaring cost of
prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to sharpening his criticism, Gore on Monday was
touting his claim to have waged a decades-long fight over the cost
of prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been in this fight for a long time,'' the presumptive
Democratic presidential nominee said in ''talking points'' made
available to The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was headed to St. Louis and a meeting with senior citizens
at a community center hammering on his plan to help seniors pay for
prescription drugs. He was underscoring that same theme at a
meeting with Hispanic leaders in California, courting that crucial
voting bloc.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president's strategists think the prescription drug
issue is a solid one for his campaign because the costs of
prescription drugs have been soaring much faster than the overall
inflation rate and the issue touches millions of families.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal Gore has offered -- costing $255 billion over 10
years -- would offer prescription drug coverage to 40 million
people. His plan calls for Medicare paying for half of the
prescription drug costs up to $5,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Background documents for his proposal note that 90 percent of
Medicare recipients have less than $5,000 in annual prescription
drug costs, and his package limits out-of-pocket expenses for
seniors to $4,000.
</P>
<P>
   In making his point, Gore headed to a community center to hear
dramatic tales of seniors forced to choose between paying for
prescription drugs, or other bills.
</P>
<P>
   ''Seniors shouldn't have to sit at the kitchen table and count
every penny and every pill because they can't afford the medicine
that protects life and health,'' said Gore's talking points.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has been a hot one in Congress, where Republicans have
sought to fashion a more limited prescription drug plan that would
benefit the low-income elderly. Gore aides said the issue works in
their favor, and they point to an industry-financed $2 million
television ad campaign attacking Gore on the issue as evidence that
pharmaceutical firms feels threatened.
</P>
<P>
   In background documents, Gore lays the blame for soaring costs
''on drug company price-gouging that too often causes these price
hikes.''
</P>
<P>
   He is continuing a tour where he seeks credit for the nation's
solid economic performance, but also underscoring groups he thinks
are in danger of being left behind.
</P>
<P>
   The background documents for Gore's proposal also make
comparisons between drug costs in this country and elsewhere to
make their points. On example is a 30-pill bottle of prilosec, used
to treat ulcers and heartburn. In the United States, the
prescription costs $99.24, compared with $49.53 in Canada and
$17.14 in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also hopes to lay claim to the issue by arguing that he has
been waging the fight since 1978, when as a congressman he backed
an investigation into drug industry price gouging and his
consistent backing for cheaper generic drugs.

<HEADLINE> Fox Victory Milestone in Mexico  </HEADLINE>
By KEN GUGGENHEIM
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Perhaps now no one will doubt the United
States' southern neighbor is truly democratic.
</P>
<P>
   Vicente Fox's win in Sunday's Mexican presidential election
marks the last gasp of a single-party system born when Herbert
Hoover was the U.S. president and still running strong long after
the collapse of the Berlin Wall.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico has gradually become more democratic since a fraud-ridden
1988 presidential election. Opposition parties have won
governorships, the Mexico City mayor's seat and ended the governing
Institutional Revolutionary Party's majority in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But in a country where presidents long exercised almost
unquestioned authority, it was difficult for many to think of
Mexico as a true democracy while the governing party, known as the
PRI, held on to the presidential seat.
</P>
<P>
   And many thought it always would. No Mexican alive today has
seen a governing party lose the presidency to an opposition
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Then Fox came along. A brash governor of the small state of
Guanajuato, Fox began his campaign an unheard of three years before
the presidential election, crisscrossing the country.
</P>
<P>
   To Mexico's poor and humble, he presented himself as a
tough-talking rancher who never left home without his cowboy boots
on. To Mexico's elite, he was the world-savvy former Coca-Cola
executive who would continue President Ernesto Zedillo's
market-oriented economic policies.
</P>
<P>
   He rose in the polls and he faded, only to rise again. By
election day he was in striking distance, but still an underdog.
His PRI opponent, Francisco Labastida, had the backing of the PRI's
powerful electoral machine -- unions, peasant leaders and local
politicians who knew how to get out the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Fox couldn't unite the opposition and risked losing a large
chunk of the anti-PRI vote to third-party candidate Cuauhtemoc
Cardenas of the leftist Democratic Revolution Party.
</P>
<P>
   His best hope was that despite the power of the PRI, despite
Democratic Revolution's loyalty to Cardenas, enough voters would go
to the polls Sunday and decide that 71 years of single-party
control of the presidency was enough.
</P>
<P>
   And, apparently, that's what happened.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as difficult as it was for Fox to win the presidency,
governing Mexico may be even harder. His center-right National
Action Party won't have a majority in Congress. And while he has
said he wants members of all parties in his Cabinet, the question
will be whether members of other parties want to be part of a Fox
government.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico has certainly not seen the last of the PRI. It remains
Mexico's biggest party and may be ideologically closer to the PRD
than to National Action, which could make it difficult for Fox to
get his initiatives through Congress.
</P>
<P>
   It will continue to be a force in state and local elections: a
powerful -- but not all-powerful -- party in Mexico's multiparty
democracy.

<HEADLINE> Ways To Save Calif. Foxes Sought  </HEADLINE>
By LEON DROUIN KEITH
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SANTA ROSA ISLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Spanish settlers unwittingly
began unleashing an ecological time bomb here a century and a half
ago. Sheepherders added to it and DDT-spraying farmers finished the
job.
</P>
<P>
	   The fuse burned until the last half of the 1990s, when the bomb
took out thousands of docile and unwary island foxes, bringing them
to the brink of extinction at Channel Islands National Park.
</P>
<P>
	   Biologists estimate foxes on the six islands they inhabit
plummeted from about 6,000 in the early 1990s to about 1,600. On
one, San Miguel, they number as few as 15.
</P>
<P>
	   While biologists try to restore the ecological balance upset by
pigs, non-native grasses and golden eagles, they're using their
weapon of last resort -- captive breeding -- to keep the small foxes
alive.
</P>
<P>
	   ''It's almost akin to stopping the bleeding,'' said National
Park Service biologist Tim Coonan, who has studied the
housecat-sized foxes since 1993. They are the largest mammals
unique to California.
</P>
<P>
	   Their future depends on finding money for a multimillion-dollar
recovery effort. But with a petition filed to put the fox on the
endangered species list only a month ago, federal interest in
funding long-term recovery efforts is far from guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
	   ''We're at a very iffy stage right now whether this going to
happen,'' said Gary Romer, a research biologist at the University
of California at Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
	   The northern Channel Islands don't look like a place where a fox
or anything else would face extinction. Accessible only by boat or
plane, the national park sees fewer than 100 visitors a day on
average. Those who make the trip hike through rugged canyons and
relax on pristine beaches.
</P>
<P>
	   In this land of chaparral and wind-swept cliffs, the foxes
enjoyed a 16,000-year stint of easy living. It began when their
gray fox ancestors made it across the Santa Barbara Channel --
possibly atop driftwood -- to what was then a single island closer
to the mainland.
</P>
<P>
	   In making the crossing, the foxes ditched the coyotes, the
mountain lions and anything else that might look upon them as a
primary food source. Bald eagles ruled the skies but tended to hunt
ocean prey.
</P>
<P>
	   Thousands of years without predators caused island foxes to stop
watching their backs -- literally. Coonan said they tend not to
watch the skies for hunters and are more active during the day than
other fox species.
</P>
<P>
	   The foxes are also unusually docile.
</P>
<P>
	   ''You can handle them without drugging them,'' Romer said. ''We
even draw blood without knocking out these guys. Most carnivores
wouldn't put up with that at all -- they'd tear your hand off.''
</P>
<P>
	   Romer began a collaring and monitoring program for Santa Cruz
foxes in 1993. Not a single animal he tracked died until April
1994, when he found a collar, a carcass and some golden eagle
feathers.
</P>
<P>
	   Seventeen months later, barely 20 percent of the foxes Romer was
tracking were still alive. A boom in the population of golden
eagles -- spurred on by the cumulative effects of decades-long
ecological changes -- appeared to be the culprit in most of the
deaths, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   What's driving the eagles to the islands are hundreds of feral
pigs, descendants of animals Spanish settlers let roam in the 19th
century, Coonan said.
</P>
<P>
	   If it weren't for the insecticide DDT, bald eagles would have
kept goldens from moving in. The pesticide left eggshells brittle
and wiped out the bald eagle around the Channel Islands by 1950.
The golden eagle -- more of a land-focused hunter than the bald
eagle -- was hit, too, but federal protections for both species
beginning in the 1970s allowed goldens to thrive in Santa Barbara
County.
</P>
<P>
	   By the mid-1990s their population in the area was so great they
expanded west into the Channel Islands.
</P>
<P>
	   Another man-made disadvantage for the foxes came in the form of
non-native grasses, which overwhelmed species like chaparral that
provide cover. Ranchers brought in sheep and other animals that
spread non-native seeds often contained in their feed, Coonan said.
</P>
<P>
	   Biologists involved with the foxes plan to meet in July to agree
on a plan for the animals' long-term survival and begin lobbying
for funding.
</P>
<P>
	   The Park Service did part of the work needed to restore the fox
before even realizing the species needed help. In the late 1980s
and early '90s it used traps, dog teams and hunters to rid Santa
Rosa Island of about 1,400 feral pigs.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, getting thousands of pigs off the other islands will
cost $3 million to $5 million, Coonan said.

<HEADLINE> Obesity Rising in Latin America  </HEADLINE>
By ANA A. LIMA
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- The girl from Ipanema is too fat,
and so are many of her Latin American neighbors, health officials
say.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates at the first Latin American Conference on Healthy
Weight in Rio said rising income in some developing nations like
Brazil has led to worse eating habits and an increase in obesity,
especially among poorer people.
</P>
<P>
   About 10 percent of Brazil's 165 million people are obese, said
Walmir Coutinho, president of the Brazilian Association for the
Study of Obesity, which organized the weekend event. Some 6 percent
of Brazilian men and 13.3 percent of women are obese, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil now has the same rate of obesity as France and Italy,
Coutinho said, although the United States remains No. 1, where
about one-quarter of adults are obese. About 15 percent to 20
percent of European adults are obese.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, prosperous Brazilians generally are leaner than the
less affluent, who turn to fast food when their income rises, said
conference spokeswoman Elizabeth Camarao.
</P>
<P>
   Some 200,000 deaths in Latin America every year are directly
related to obesity, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Obesity is ''the epidemic of the new millennium,'' read a
statement issued at the end of the two-day conference.
</P>
<P>
   A report released in March by the Washington-based research
group Worldwatch Institute stated that, for the first time, the
number of overweight people in the world matched the total of its
underfed, at about 1.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Obesity is measured by a person's weight in relation to height.
At 6 feet, a person is considered overweight at 185 pounds and
obese at 220. Someone who is 5-foot-6 would be overweight at 155
pounds and obese at about 185.
</P>
<P>
   About 400 representatives from health ministries of 10 Latin
American countries drafted an ''Act of Rio de Janeiro'' with
recommendations to make people leaner and healthier.
</P>
<P>
   They include training teachers to educate children on diet and
exercise; inspecting school cafeterias to ensure they serve low-fat
foods and healthy snacks; and asking governments to spend more for
recreation centers in poor neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Reducing obesity will eventually save money in treatment of
weight-related illnesses like diabetes, heart disease and
hypertension, Camarao said.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials ''saw the stupid expense they have with
obesity,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The conference was attended by officials from Brazil, Mexico,
Ecuador, Colombia, Argentina, Chile, Venezuela, Puerto Rico,
Uruguay and Cuba.

<HEADLINE> USS Kennedy Arrives in N.Y. Harbor  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD PYLE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- One by one, hundreds of tall ships, sailboats
and military vessels are making their way to New York Harbor for
the city's nautical Fourth of July extravaganza.
</P>
<P>
   The aircraft carrier USS John F. Kennedy joined the armada
Sunday, dropping anchor near the Statue of Liberty.
</P>
<P>
   Some 150 tall ships from 23 countries and 25 naval ships from 14
nations are expected for an 11-mile military review and tall ship
parade down the Hudson River on Tuesday. President Clinton plans to
review the military ships from the missile cruiser USS Hue City,
then board the USS Kennedy for the tall ships' ''parade of sail.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no question that this will be the largest assemblage
ever of tall ships and naval vessels,'' said Greg Perrin, an
organizer.
</P>
<P>
   As the USS Kennedy sailed into port, the skies over the harbor
were abuzz with helicopters, and white-uniformed sailors joined the
throng of seafarers taking part in Operation Sail 2000 and
International Naval Review 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The Hue City steamed up the harbor late Sunday, bound for a
Hudson River pier near the Intrepid, a famed World War II carrier
turned military museum.
</P>
<P>
   About 150 miles to the northeast, in the seaport in Mystic,
Conn., a replica of the 19th-century slave ship Amistad set sail
for the New York Harbor celebration on its maiden voyage.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a joy to sail,'' said the ship's captain, William
Pinkney. ''It doesn't take a lot of wind to get her moving. That
she is responsive is what you want a sailboat to be.''
</P>
<P>
   It was aboard the original Amistad in 1839 that 53 captive
Africans, headed for a life of slavery, revolted and eventually won
their freedom after a long legal battle in Connecticut. The
129-foot long replica was built to spread the message of
cooperation, leadership and perseverance that can be drawn from the
story of its namesake.
</P>
<P>
   While the Amistad and other stately tall ships are the
celebration's main attraction, Navy officials had hoped to also
grab the spotlight with the largest naval review in history.
Sixty-one nations were invited to take part, but officials now say
this year's gathering isn't likely to surpass the record 25 navies
represented at the 1986 Statue of Liberty centennial.
</P>
<P>
   Naval ships from Canada, Ireland, Britain, Ukraine, India,
Greece, France, Italy, Brazil, South Africa, Singapore, Turkey and
the United States are expected, said U.S. Navy Capt. Woody Berzins,
a spokesman for the International Naval Review.
</P>
<P>
   The weeklong event includes tours of some of the ships and a
Fourth of July fireworks display billed as the largest ever: 60
tons of explosives launched from barges, with a grand finale blast
planned over the Statue of Liberty.

<HEADLINE> Lottery Numbers Published by Fluke  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANCOUVER, Wash. (AP) -- Oregon Lottery officials thought it was
a joke when someone called to say The Columbian had published the
winning Pick 4 lotto numbers a few hours before they were drawn.
</P>
<P>
   When they learned the caller was right, they dispatched Lloyd W.
Beil, a detective with the Oregon State Police gaming enforcement
section.
</P>
<P>
   ''Game security is our most valuable commodity,'' said David
Hooper, an Oregon Lottery spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, the newspaper's computer system in this city
across the Columbia River from Portland, Ore., crashed Wednesday.
In the scramble to re-create a lost page, a copy editor mistakenly
pulled the winning Pick 4 numbers from Virginia and billed them as
the Tuesday night's winning pick in Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   Those same winning numbers, 6-8-5-5, were also drawn later
Wednesday evening in Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can laugh about it now,'' Hooper said, ''because there's
nothing wrong with our system.''
</P>
<P>
   The odds of hitting the Pick 4 are 10,000 to 1. And the odds of
pulling the Virginia lottery numbers by mistake and having those
numbers drawn in Oregon the next day?
</P>
<P>
   ''A gazillion to one,'' Hooper said.

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were narrowly mixed Monday in a quiet,
shortened session ahead of the Independence Day holiday.
</P>
<P>
   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was down 19.10 at 10,428.79.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was down 2.78 at 1,451.82, and the Nasdaq composite index was
down 19.54 at 3,946.57.
</P>
<P>
   Trading was extremely light. The stock market was to close at 1
p.m., and many Wall Street professionals had taken the day off,
opting for a four-day weekend. Volume on the New York Stock
Exchange came to 93.91 million shares, compared with 117.68 million
at the same time Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a few catalysts drove trading. The National Association
of Purchasing Management reported a slowdown in manufacturing
activity, raising hopes that six interest-rate increases by the
Federal Reserve in the past year are slowing the economy to a more
sustainable pace.
</P>
<P>
   The purchasing managers' business index for June came in at
51.8, compared with 53.2 in May. While any reading above 50 is
considered a sign of economic growth, the index was lower than
analysts had anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the report's ''prices paid'' index fell from 65.8
in May to 61.2 in June. That component is considered an important
gauge of inflationary pressures.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle fell $3.813 to $80.25. Late Friday, the company announced
that chief operating offer and president Ray Lane will leave his
post.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5-to-3 margin on the
NYSE.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Stocks Barely Changed in Light Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were modestly higher Monday in a quiet,
shortened session ahead of the Independence Day holiday. A report
of moderating economic growth shored up the market.
</P>
<P>
   In morning trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 5.65 at 10,453.54.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was down 0.92 at 1,455.52, and the Nasdaq composite index was
up 0.68 at 3,966.79.
</P>
<P>
   Trading was extremely light. The stock market was to close at 1
p.m., and many Wall Street professionals had taken the day off,
opting for a four-day weekend. Volume on the New York Stock
Exchange came to 213.35 million shares, compared with 284.10
million at the same time Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a few catalysts drove trading. The National Association
of Purchasing Management reported a slowdown in manufacturing
activity growth, raising hopes that six interest-rate increases by
the Federal Reserve in the past year are slowing the economy to a
more sustainable pace.
</P>
<P>
   The purchasing managers' business index for June came in at
51.8, compared with 53.2 in May. While any reading above 50 is
considered a sign of economic growth, the index was lower than
analysts had anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the report's ''prices paid'' index fell from 65.8
in May to 61.2 in June. That component is considered an important
gauge of inflationary pressures.
</P>
<P>
   ''The market is telling a pretty good story,'' said Alan
Ackerman, senior vice president at Fahnestock &AMP; Co. in New York.
''This was a favorable piece of news that I think will allow some
interest-rate jitters to fade away.''
</P>
<P>
   Rate-sensitive stocks rose. J.P. Morgan gained $3.25 to
$113.375.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle fell $3.813 to $80.25. Late Friday, the company announced
that chief operating offer and president Ray Lane will leave his
post.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5-to-3 margin on the
NYSE.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 2.93 to 520.16.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas indexes were mostly higher, including Mexico's key IPC
index. Investors were celebrating the presidential victory of
opposition candidate Vicente Fox, whose victory ends the
Institutional Revolutionary Party's 71-year grip on the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the election wasn't a significant factor in U.S.
stock trading, but may stimulate interest in Mexican stocks in the
coming sessions.

<HEADLINE> Lucky Few Snag Copies of Potter  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- A lucky few people have their hands on the
eagerly awaited fourth Harry Potter book after two area stores
prematurely sold copies.
</P>
<P>
   ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,'' the latest installment
in the popular children's series, is to be unveiled Saturday.
Bookstores have been forced to keep nearly 4 million copies under
wraps until then, and many are planning special midnight launch
parties.
</P>
<P>
   But an area Wal-Mart and another unidentified store broke the
embargo last week, giving a handful of kids a scoop on Harry's
adventures, which fill more than 700 pages.
</P>
<P>
   In Chesterfield County south of Richmond, 10-year-old Caitlin
Streett has been reading the book and filling in her friends on the
details.
</P>
<P>
   ''Well, the first 10 pages are pretty boring but then it grabs
you and you can't put it down,'' Caitlin said.
</P>
<P>
   Caitlin and her dad, Gene Streett, found the book at a local
Wal-Mart while they shopped for glue.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were doing papier mache crafts. And we walk in and it was
like, 'Whoa! Harry Potter!' There was a big display with some other
books,'' said Gene Streett, a high school teacher.
</P>
<P>
   He paid $12.97 for the book, which lists for $25.95.
</P>
<P>
   A Wal-Mart spokesman said the store mistakenly put the books on
the store shelves and removed them as soon as they realized they
weren't supposed to be there. About 20 books were sold.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is purely an isolated incident based on a mistake that we
made,'' said Rob Phillips, a spokesman for Bentonville, Ark.-based
Wal-Mart Stores Inc.
</P>
<P>
   While Streett immediately realized the significance of his find,
8-year-old Laura Cantwell had to explain it to her dad, Tim
Cantwell.
</P>
<P>
   He found the book in a second, unidentified northern Virginia
store last week when he was tipped off by a friend.
</P>
<P>
   When he gave the book to his daughter, ''she said, 'Dad, do you
realize how huge this is? ... I said to my wife that night that I
could probably sell this book for a lot of money. She said, 'Under
no circumstances do you sell that book.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Cantwells are not saying where they got the book because
they don't want anyone to get in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The book's publisher, Scholastic Inc., did not immediately
return a phone call Monday.

<HEADLINE> EU Evaluates Yugoslav Companies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- The European Commission on Monday
released a list of 190 Yugoslav companies to be exempted from
European sanctions because they have proved they are not linked to
President Slobodan Milosevic's government.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union executive body said the preparation of a
''white list'' was part of a drive to focus EU sanctions against
the Milosevic regime without increasing hardships for the Yugoslav
population as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, the 15-nation EU said it was considering
applications from over 100 more companies and that 50 of those
would likely be added to the list this month.
</P>
<P>
   Companies on the list including food, pharmaceutical and
electrical companies as well as the local subsidiaries of
international firms including Ericsson, Mercedes-Benz, Siemens, and
Volvo. Companies in sensitive fields such as fuel supply, banking
and production of military equipment were not included.
</P>
<P>
   The EU imposed restrictions on investment and trading with
Yugoslavia during the armed crack down on ethnic Albanians in
Kosovo which led to NATO military intervention in the province last
year.

<HEADLINE> Harvey Upset Over Reference to Show  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- One sentence of a recent newspaper story was
enough to set off Steve Harvey.
</P>
<P>
   While backstage at a New York City hotel as he waited to address
advertisers and TV critics who were there to see the WB network
present its fall schedule, the comedian spied a story that said the
network's so-called black-themed shows were moving to Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   That was it. The article didn't mention ''The Steve Harvey
Show,'' ''For Your Love'' or ''The Jamie Foxx Show.'' There was no
inkling of what the programs were about, just a reference to the
skin color of most cast members.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt degraded at that moment,'' Harvey recalled. ''I felt
un-American at that moment. I felt isolated. Why is there always
this separation in the way that TV critics ever talk about us?''
</P>
<P>
   Harvey, and actress Holly Robinson Peete of ''For Your Love,''
raised that question onstage. They challenged the advertisers not
to assume that only black people were interested in their work.
</P>
<P>
   It raised an issue usually overlooked in the past year's
discussion about diversity on the TV screen.
</P>
<P>
   The WB and UPN each devote one night of their schedules to shows
with primarily black casts. None of the five other broadcasters can
claim such obvious efforts to reach out to a minority audience. But
do these schedules promote segregation instead of integration?
</P>
<P>
   Peete is grateful the WB picked up ''For Your Love'' after it
was dropped by NBC. But she wonders why most of the white viewers
who watched her show disappeared with the move, and why more isn't
done to court them.
</P>
<P>
   The sitcom, set in the suburb of Oak Park, Ill., isn't really
compatible with the shows that surround it on the WB's schedule,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not a show about black people,'' she said. ''It's a show
about love and relationships. It does irk me a lot when I see
people sort of paint us with a broad brush and say that because we
have a majority black cast, we're a black show.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvey noted that no one describes ''Friends'' as a white show.
He said he tries to make a show that appeals to everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Both stars say they notice that when the WB promotes itself in
TV Guide or on billboards, the attractive white casts of
teen-oriented shows like ''Dawson's Creek'' or ''Buffy the Vampire
Slayer'' get the most attention. Most of the promotion
opportunities for their shows come on urban outlets, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ''Putting the shows on all on one night has hurt us
demographically,'' Peete said. ''It's a little shortsighted.''
</P>
<P>
   Many shows with primarily black casts have broken through to
general audiences, from ''Good Times'' and ''The Flip Wilson Show''
in the 1970s to ''Cosby'' in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   But those shows were all popular before the breakthrough of
cable gave viewers many more choices. Studies show there are often
vast differences in what blacks and whites consider their favorite
shows, although that gap has narrowed somewhat.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very hard, as television history has proven, to get
people who are not of color to watch shows about people who are,''
said Jerry Offsay, Showtime network president.
</P>
<P>
   Recent evidence includes two comedies that were canceled by
their networks: ''The PJs,'' a cartoon with an all-black cast on
Fox, and ''The Hughleys,'' about a black family moving into a white
suburb on ABC. ''The PJs'' was picked up by the WB and ''The
Hughleys'' by UPN, and both will run this fall on nights with shows
that have mostly black casts.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think audiences tend to look for programs that they can
relate to,'' said Jamie Kellner, WB president. ''When a black
audience sees programs that deal with their culture, they respond.
I think it is a service. I don't think there is any negative side
to it.''
</P>
<P>
   But many blacks disagree that these shows reflect aspects of
black life and culture to which they can relate and say that some
of the comedies even promote stereotypes.
</P>
<P>
   Kellner said it's not true that the WB promotes these comedies
only to black audiences. Harvey is annoyed that the WB has bounced
his show from night to night on its schedule through the years;
Kellner said it's a statement of confidence that it is moving to
Sundays, generally the most popular television-viewing night of the
week.
</P>
<P>
   The WB is also using Sunday to premiere two new comedies with
mostly white casts this fall, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope we can find a way to broaden this out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at the schedule presentation, Harvey found a way to
both raise consciousness and wickedly parody his network with the
first seven words out of his mouth: ''I'm Steve Harvey,'' he
deadpanned. ''I'm a white teen-ager.''
</P>
<P>
   He and Peete are both glad they raised the issue at a venue
where so many influential people were listening. Maybe it means
Harvey will see one less description of himself as a black comedian
who stars in a black TV show.
</P>
<P>
   ''You know how frustrating that gets at times?'' he said. ''I
just want to be a part of the human race. You get sick of that when
it's such a pervasive part of your day, everyday.''

   THUNDERBOX: A new syndicated TV series debuting in September
promises to bring the subtlety and sportsmanship of professional
wrestling to boxing. ''Thunderbox'' will feature fights between
heavyweight boxers, mixed in with music and, its originators
promise, frequent appearances by the ''Thundergirls.'' And, under
the show's scoring system, boxers will be awarded points for
''flamboyance, defiance and the ability to get the crowd charged
up.'' The president of CKP, which is developing the program
together with Litton Syndications, is low-key about its prospects:
''We have created the definitive entertainment program for the new
millennium,'' said Jim DiLorenzo.

<HEADLINE> Barak's Compromise Pleases Few  </HEADLINE>
By DINA KRAFT
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- For the soldiers who want Jewish seminary
students to join their ranks, it is a question of Israel's
survival. For the ultra-Orthodox who aim to preserve the status
quo, nothing less than the Jewish soul is at stake.
</P>
<P>
   The bitter debate over Israel's draft laws moved to parliament
Monday when Prime Minister Ehud Barak began his attempt to shepherd
a bill through parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The bill calls for seminary students to be exempt from military
service until age 23 when it would be their decision to continue
their studies or join the military for a shortened tour of service.
Those for the bill argue it would increase the number of
ultra-Orthodox soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's debate brought out frustration among many non-religious
members who expressed their disgust with what they considered
another sellout to the ultra-Orthodox politicians.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're doing what you do every day, extortion and evasion of
responsibility,'' thundered Yosef ''Tommy'' Lapid of the
anti-religious Shinui party, shaking his fist at the podium in the
direction of members of the ultra-Orthodox Shas, the main backers
of the exemption bill.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, Jewish seminary students would apply for exemption
from military service on an individual basis at age 18 and the
exemptions were usually granted.
</P>
<P>
   Neither side is happy with the bill -- not so surprising for a
debate cast in existential terms so strident that even this
boisterous political culture is reeling from the verbal blows. The
fight is fast becoming the latest in a series of rifts afflicting
Barak's fragile government.
</P>
<P>
   The ultra-Orthodox say that full-time study at seminaries is the
only way to preserve the Jewish heritage nearly wiped out during
the Holocaust, when the Nazis and their allies murdered six million
Jews in German-occupied Europe between 1939-45.
</P>
<P>
   In 1949, Israel's first prime minister, David Ben-Gurion,
exempted 400 seminary students from the draft. Today the number has
climbed to about 30,000 full-time students.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no reason for one sector of the population to
contribute everything while another does not,'' said Yuval Lester,
a soldier who lost both arms in a grenade accident, and who has
joined a protest tent across from Barak's office.
</P>
<P>
   The ultra-Orthodox comprise about 7 percent of a population of 6
million in Israel. Modern Orthodox Jews, who make up about 13
percent of the population, readily serve. Most Israeli Arabs,
making up 18 percent of the population, are exempted from service.
</P>
<P>
   A group of soldier activists says the bill amounts to
discrimination. While the soldiers don't expect the army to absorb
all the seminary students, the soldiers say if the students do not
serve in the military, they should have to perform some type of
national service.
</P>
<P>
   ''Wherever you turn, the ultra-Orthodox are eating away at
society,'' said Natan Shalev, who served 38 years in the regular
army and the reserves. ''They want all the rights but are not
prepared to serve any of the national obligations.''
</P>
<P>
   Such talk infuriated Moshe Gafni, an ultra-Orthodox legislator
who visited the protest tent.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe that the basis of the existence of the Jewish
people is studying the Torah,'' the Jewish holy text, Gafni told
Israel radio. ''Without Torah we would have dispersed among the
nations and would no longer exist.''
</P>
<P>
   They say that the compulsory three years in the army would
render impossible the intensive training required to master the
massive Jewish text. The compromise would allow a shortened service
followed by reserved duty.
</P>
<P>
   Barak met with the soldier activists on Sunday night. Several
have been on a hunger-strike for the past five days. Tables were
piled with petitions against the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Gafni, the ultra-Orthodox legislator, said he would vote for the
bill despite his objections to any law mandating even minimal
military service for the ultra-Orthodox. He said he worried even
more about the corrosive effects of the debate.
</P>
<P>
   ''I do not want to arrive at a civil war, I feel the tensions in
the street,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The draft issue is just one of many dividing secular and
religious Jews in Israel. Other divisions include funding for
religious schools, the legalization of religious radio stations,
and the control the Orthodox exert over marriage and funerals. The
debates have battered Barak's government, and inhibited his efforts
to conclude a peace deal with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Lester, the activist soldier whose prostheses have helped make
him the campaign's poster boy, said the debate is endemic of a
wider rift in his country.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is about a gap between two different sectors which ...
has left us with almost two separate societies,'' Lester said,
''Ask a (seminary) student about how I live my life and he would
know almost nothing, just as I could say very little about his
world.''

<HEADLINE> Smuggler Methods Get Sophisticated  </HEADLINE>
CHRISTOPHER BODEEN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- Chinese gangs are adopting increasingly varied
and sophisticated methods of smuggling illegal migrants into the
United States, the chief of the U.S. immigration service said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   All but gone is the crude but common method of packing migrants
into decrepit boats for long sea voyages ending in night-time
landings along the U.S. coastline, said Doris Meissner,
commissioner of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service.
</P>
<P>
   No such vessels have been found this year, she said, though some
immigrants have been found in cargo ships docking at West Coast
ports.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with tighter law enforcement and greater vigilance,
people-smugglers now take migrants out of China overland or by air
to Europe and South and Central America.
</P>
<P>
   Small groups typically enter at major U.S. airports using
doctored passports that are recycled and sold to other hopefuls,
Meissner said.
</P>
<P>
   ''So it has branched out and in some ways it's more difficult
because the groups are small and routes are rather widespread,''
Meissner said.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese migrant smuggling attracted international concern
following the discovery of the bodies of 58 illegal immigrants from
southeastern China in an airtight truck compartment at the English
port of Dover on June 18.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has traditionally been the primary destination
for Chinese migrants, although Meissner said no hard figures on the
numbers of arrivals are available.
</P>
<P>
   Several boats carrying immigrants in soft-top cargo containers
were intercepted earlier this year on the West Coast, including
Seattle, where three people were found dead in a ship intercepted
Jan. 10.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of Chinese stowaways who crossed the Pacific in such
containers have been arrested at West Coast ports in the United
States and Canada this year. Fifteen were apprehended in Los
Angeles in the last U.S. incident reported, in April, and
immigration officials say the smugglers have likely switched to
other methods.
</P>
<P>
   Despite fees of up to $60,000 charged by smuggling ringleaders,
or ''snakeheads,'' large numbers of Chinese, mostly from coastal
Fujian province, attempt the long, dangerous trip for the chance of
working in an American restaurant or factory.
</P>
<P>
   Money sent home pays for flashy new houses, stoking the desire
to work abroad among others.
</P>
<P>
   But to pay back their passage, some migrants are forced into
prostitution. Others risk rape, kidnapping or murder.
</P>
<P>
   According to INS officials, about 200 illegal Chinese immigrants
a week are stopped just at Los Angeles's airport, and 2,700 Chinese
illegals who arrived by air have been repatriated this year.
</P>
<P>
   Many enter the United States using stolen passports from Japan
and Singapore, whose citizens do not need a visa to enter the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Meissner, who will visit Fujian this week, said her meetings
with Chinese officials focused on finding ways to improve the
sharing of information for prosecuting snakeheads, uncovering
document fraud, and analyzing trends in people smuggling.
</P>
<P>
   While China has helped speed the repatriation of many who
attempted to reach the United States by boat, such cooperation
still occurs chiefly on a case-by-case basis, Meissner said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is difficult. We would like to see better cooperation, not
only from China but all over,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ensuring speedy repatriations is especially important, said
Meissner, who called quick returns the strongest message that can
be sent to convince would-be migrants that the risk and large
amounts of money paid are not worth it.

<HEADLINE> Dow, Nasdaq Move Slightly Higher  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mostly higher Monday in a quiet,
shortened session ahead of the Independence Day holiday. A report
of moderating economic growth helped the market advance.
</P>
<P>
   In midday trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 35.71 at 10,483.60.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 4.49 at 1,459.09, and the
Nasdaq composite index was up 9.03 at 3,975.14.
</P>
<P>
   Trading was extremely light. The stock market was to close at 1
p.m., and many Wall Street professionals had taken the day off,
opting for a four-day weekend. Volume on the New York Stock
Exchange came to 303.77 million shares, compared with 415.11
million at the same time Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a few catalysts drove trading. The National Association
of Purchasing Management reported a slowdown in manufacturing
activity growth, raising hopes that six interest-rate increases by
the Federal Reserve in the past year are slowing the economy to a
more sustainable pace.
</P>
<P>
   The purchasing managers' business index for June came in at
51.8, compared with 53.2 in May. While any reading above 50 is
considered a sign of economic growth, the index was lower than
analysts had anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the report's ''prices paid'' index fell from 65.8
in May to 61.2 in June. That component is considered an important
gauge of inflationary pressures.
</P>
<P>
   ''The market is telling a pretty good story,'' said Alan
Ackerman, senior vice president at Fahnestock &AMP; Co. in New York.
''This was a favorable piece of news that I think will allow some
interest-rate jitters to fade away.''
</P>
<P>
   Rate-sensitive stocks rose. J.P. Morgan gained $4.25 to $114.375
and Bank of America rose $1.563 to $44.813.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle fell $5 to $79.063. Late Friday, the company announced
that chief operating offer and president Ray Lane will leave his
post.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 2-to-1 margin on the
NYSE, but decliners held a slight edge in Nasdaq trading.

<HEADLINE> Barak Tries To Resolve Plane Dispute  </HEADLINE>
By MARK LAVIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak said Monday
he doesn't want to hurt ties with the United States over Israel's
planned sale of a spy plane to China -- a comment that came amid
growing indications the deal could be called off.
</P>
<P>
   Israel is looking to solve the problem without creating an ''an
obstacle in our relations with the United States,'' Barak said. He
did not mention damage to relations with China if the deal is
canceled. China is a major purchaser of Israeli arms.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's planned sale of the plane, called PHALCON, has become a
stumbling block between Israel and the United States in recent
months.
</P>
<P>
   The United States insists that Israel scrap the sale, pointing
to tensions between China and Taiwan and expressing concern that
China could use the plane to track American planes if hostilities
erupt. In the U.S. Congress, representatives from both parties have
threatened to cut American aid to Israel if the deal goes through.
Israel receives $1.9 billion in annual defense aid from the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   But the Israelis say the U.S. government is trying to undermine
Israeli competition for arms markets in Asia. They warn that if
they have to cancel a signed contract with China, it would harm
their future credibility in arms deals.
</P>
<P>
   With the Israeli-Palestinian peace treaty talks in a critical
phase, Barak depends on the Clinton administration's good will. The
Israeli leader has been urging President Clinton to convene a
trilateral summit with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in which
the leaders would try to finalize a peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   If such an agreement is reached, Israel would ask for billions
of dollars in additional U.S. aid -- something Congress would be
unlikely to approve as long as the disagreement over the spy plane
has not been resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli newspapers and others have begun raising the possibility
of American compensation to Israel for calling off the spy plane
deal. Last week, an Israeli Cabinet minister close to Barak said it
was in Israel's interest to cancel the deal. And during last week's
one-day visit by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, both Barak
and Foreign Minister David Levy referred to the plane deal and said
Israel would take no steps that would harm American interests.
</P>
<P>
   The PHALCON deal includes a Chinese option to buy up to four
more of the spy planes, which are built on a Russian chassis with
Israeli technology.

<HEADLINE> Managed Care Balks at Newer Drugs  </HEADLINE>
By PHIL GALEWITZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Jane Thompson's arthritis drug was losing its
punch last year just as the federal government was approving two
promising new painkillers.
</P>
<P>
   A doctor gave the retired school teacher a prescription for
Merck &AMP; Co.'s Vioxx, and then Pharmacia Inc.'s Celebrex, both
one-a-day pills that reduce inflammation as well as older medicines
do but that cause fewer side effects such as upset stomach and
ulcers.
</P>
<P>
   But Thompson's insurer, HIP Health Plan, refused to pay for
either new drug. HIP didn't think the new pills were worth the
extra cost -- Celebrex and Vioxx each cost $2.42 a day, eight times
more than common generic arthritis drugs.
</P>
<P>
   HIP's restrictive policy toward the new painkillers reflects how
the managed care industry is playing hardball with this new class
of expensive medicines and high drug prices overall.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all the large U.S. managed care firms either don't cover
Celebrex and Vioxx, require patients to meet strict medical
criteria to get them, or mandate that their members try and fail
with cheaper medicines first.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not convinced the new drugs have fewer side effects,''
said United HealthCare spokesman Roger Cruzan.
</P>
<P>
   The managed care industry's approach toward the arthritis drugs
might hurt relations with some customers and doctors, but that's a
price HMOs are willing to pay to control soaring pharmaceutical
costs. New drugs in particular, with their high prices and strong
consumer demand, have been a particular bane for HMOs looking to
improve their profits.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, 64, of New York, now pays $72 a month for Vioxx and
also relies on free samples from her doctor. ''I'm annoyed about
it,'' she said of her insurer's lack of coverage. ''It's not
fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Some HMOs such as United and Foundation Health Plans, which
provide broad prescription drug coverage, usually require customers
to pay high co-payments to get the two medicines-- often about $25
per prescription compared to $5 for generic drugs and $10 for
preferred brand medicines.
</P>
<P>
   The HMOs' restrictions upsets doctors.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a shame, because this is an exciting new class of
drugs,'' said Dr. Mark Jarrett, director of rheumatology at Staten
Island University Hospital in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrex and Vioxx are the first in a class of new arthritis
drugs called cox-2 inhibitors, which target an enzyme that causes
inflammation. Unlike earlier drugs, cox-2 inhibitors don't act
against a second enzyme, which protects the stomach lining.
</P>
<P>
   Ulcers, stomach bleeding and other gastrointestinal side effects
are major problems with many painkillers, such as ibuprofen or
aspirin.
</P>
<P>
   While studies show that cox-2 inhibitors may cause fewer ulcers
than other drugs, the Food and Drug Administration still requires
them to carry the same warning about side effects that cheaper
drugs do.
</P>
<P>
   But Jarrett said the new drugs should actually save insurer's
save money over the long term by reducing hospitalizations caused
by side effects from older painkillers. ''We shouldn't be making
everyone jump through hoops to get these drugs,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for arthritis patients say they've heard the
complaints from consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ''The lack of coverage of these drugs is a big issue,'' said Dr.
John Kimpel, medical director of the Arthritis Foundation. But he
acknowledges there is no consensus in the medical community about
which arthritis patients can best be treated with the cox-2
inhibitors.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, most doctors agree that patients who should get the
new painkillers are those who experience side effects from other
painkillers, have a history of gastrointestinal problems or are
over age 50. But there is disagreement over whether the drugs
should be given to arthritis patients who don't have a history of
stomach problems or who are faring well on their current
medication.
</P>
<P>
   Merck and Pharmacia officials say their drug sales have not been
hampered by the HMO restrictions. The companies are spending
millions on additional studies to prove that the drugs are indeed
better than traditional painkillers-- partly in hopes of removing
the warnings on the drugs' labels and partly to win over skeptical
insurers.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies are also spending heavily on consumer
advertising, designed to drive patients into doctors' offices to
ask for the pills.
</P>
<P>
   The promotions are working. Celebrex posted $1.5 billion in
sales last year, its first on the market, and outpaced the
anti-impotence drug Viagra to become the hottest selling new drug
ever.
</P>
<P>
   Rival Vioxx, approved in May 1999, is coming on fast. Vioxx had
$472 million in sales last year and $370 million in sales in just
the first quarter of 2000. In terms of new prescriptions, Vioxx is
running slightly behind Celebrex, according to market data firm IMS
Health.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Pappa, North American president of Pharmacia's Searle's
subsidiary, said HMOs generally are more demanding before allowing
members to have access to new drugs. ''This is typical managed care
activity,'' Pappa said of HMOs not covering the drug.
</P>
<P>
   Citing a company-funded study of 8,000 arthritis patients, Pappa
said Celebrex is an appropriate drug for all patients with
arthritis, regardless of whether they have had problems with older
drugs. But the 13-month study found serious stomach side effects
can occur within the first week of usage, according to a
company-paid study. ''Everyone is at risk'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The company is still trying to convince many managed care firms.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna, the nation's largest health insurer, requires customers
to either first try two different generic painkillers or get
special permission from the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Cigna does not cover either drug, but doctors can appeal for
patients particularly at risk. ''We've concluded there are similar
drugs on the market with the same benefit. There's nothing
substantially new here,'' said spokesman Mark Di Giorgio.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser Permanente leaves the choice of drugs up to their
doctors, although it works with them to show that only a small
percentage of arthritis patients actually benefit from Vioxx and
Celebrex.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrex and Vioxx make up about 3 percent of anti-inflammatory
prescriptions for Kaiser's 8 million members, but 40 percent of the
costs for this type of drug.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Rejects Reports on Missiles  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- Pakistan's Foreign Minister Abdul
Sattar on Momday dismissed U.S. intelligence reports that China is
helping Pakistan build missiles capable of carrying nuclear
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   A New York Times story Sunday quoted U.S. intelligence officials
as saying they have informed both President Clinton and Congress
that China is helping Pakistan build nuclear-capable missiles.
</P>
<P>
   ''There has been no such cooperation from China,'' Sattar said.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan and its neighbor, India, detonated underground nuclear
devises in 1998, becoming the world's newest nuclear states. The
two nations have fought three wars since British independence of
the Asian Subcontinent in 1947.
</P>
<P>
   They came dangerously close to a fourth all-out war last year
during a bitter border conflict in the disputed Kashmir region.
</P>
<P>
   Both countries say they possess a minimum nuclear deterrence.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear, however, how many weapons each country possesses,
whether they have developed nuclear warheads or any nuclear-capable
missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Both India and Pakistan have tested short and medium range
missiles. Pakistan has several medium-range missiles already in its
arsenal capable of hitting most cities in India, and of carrying
nuclear or conventional warheads.
</P>
<P>
   At a news briefing in the capital, Sattar said that the last
Chinese missiles to reach Pakistan were short range ones delivered
in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. intelligence reported several years ago that China
delivered M-11 missiles capable of carrying a nuclear warhead. Both
China and Pakistan denied that report.
</P>
<P>
   The United States threatened sanctions against China at the
time. The U.S. imposed economic and military sanctions on Pakistan
in 1990 to protest the country's nuclear program.
</P>
<P>
   According to Sunday's New York Times story, China provided
Pakistan with weapons-grade steel, guidance systems and technical
advice.
</P>
<P>
   A longtime ally of Pakistan, China has built a nuclear power
plant here and Gen. Pervez Musharraf last week said his regime
would order several fighter jets from China.

<HEADLINE> Fiji Military Leader Names Government  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN GUTKIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- Defying the gunmen holding Fiji's deposed
government hostage, the country's military leader named a temporary
civilian government Monday but said he will retain power until the
captives are freed.
</P>
<P>
   Commodore Frank Bainimarama -- who assumed power 10 days after
rebels stormed parliament on May 19 and took the government hostage
-- appointed the interim leaders without input from the gunmen, who
had demanded a role.
</P>
<P>
   Coup leader George Speight, whose supporters are holding 27
members of the ousted government in the name of indigenous Fijian
rights, said the army may pay a high price for ''completely
ignoring'' him.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a very big possibility of making a lot of people
really upset,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, no members of the Indian minority will be in the new
government. ''We approached two well-qualified members of the
Indian community, but they declined,'' Bainimarama said.
</P>
<P>
   After Speight's raid on parliament, the army gave in to most of
his demands to disenfranchise Fiji's ethnic Indians, including
firing Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry -- a hostage and the first
Fijian of Indian ancestry to lead the country. The army also threw
out the 1997 multiracial constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Indians were brought to Fiji over a century ago by English
colonialists seeking indentured laborers for rich sugar cane
fields. Today, they make up about 44 percent of Fiji's population,
while indigenous Fijians account for about 51 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Speight, a failed businessman, claims to be acting for
indigenous Fijians angered by Chaudhry's refusal to raise rents
charged to Indian sugar cane farmers on land communally owned by
indigenous people.
</P>
<P>
   Bainimarama said he will remain head of state until all the
hostages are safely released, the gunmen turn over their weapons,
and public order is restored.
</P>
<P>
   Bainimarama said the interim government will rule for 18 months
and set guidelines for a new constitution. The old one ''will not
be reinstated,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The new government should work for Fiji's poor indigenous
majority, and for ''the protection of the rights of Indians and
other communities that are an integral part of our nation,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The military has cordoned off the parliamentary compound where
the hostages are being held, and army spokesman Lt. Alipate
Mataitini said the military will tighten its cordon.
</P>
<P>
   Bainimarama said the hostage crisis has cost Fiji 5,000 jobs,
$96 million in lost exports, $96 million in lost revenues and
untold losses in talent by people who have fled the country.
</P>
<P>
   Bainimarama named banking executive Laisenia Qarase as prime
minister. Known more as a manager than a politician, he has been
head of the Merchant Bank Fiji and is a former director of the Fiji
Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Speight has spoken positively of him, but Qarase was not his
first choice for prime minister.

</P>
<P>
   Married to Hill since 1996, McGraw wasted no time in praising
the Magnolia State for his makeup model bride.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mississippi grows some fine young women,'' purred McGraw in
his Louisiana drawl before he turned up the heat by kicking into
his smash hit ''Down on the Farm.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Hill took the stage at 6:30 p.m., the heat exhaustion
toll had reached double digits.
</P>
<P>
   ''I bought enough water today to pay my water bill,'' joked Joey
Vertucci, 31.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd roared when Hill and McGraw finally took the stage
together for an encore, singing their hit single ''It's Your
Love.''

   HATFIELD, England (AP) -- Actress Olivia de Havilland was the
guest of honor at a ceremony marking the start of construction on a
new university campus named for her cousin, a pioneer of the
aviation industry.
</P>
<P>
   De Havilland, who played Melanie Wilkes in the 1939 film ''Gone

Hatfield. It's scheduled to open in 2003 on land near the factory
that produced the aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   ''I knew Sir Geoffrey well and he was a brilliant man and a very

<HEADLINE> Asians Ponder Biotech Foods  </HEADLINE>
By ELAINE KURTENBACH
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAODING, China (AP) -- The dusty, sleepy seed market on the north
China plain seems worlds away from any technological revolution.
But here, when cotton farmers plant, they favor cutting-edge
science to ensure a bountiful harvest.
</P>
<P>
   All but a fraction of the cotton fields in Baoding and
surrounding Hebei province are sown with seeds genetically
implanted with a bacterium that is toxic to boll worms.
</P>
<P>
   ''The farmers really welcome these seeds,'' says seed-seller
Meng Xinghe, standing amid sacks of corn and soybean seed in his
small market stall. ''Without them, they'd be wiped out.''
</P>
<P>
   With memories of famine fresh and dwindling arable land to feed
its 1.26 billion people, China has enthusiastically pursued
genetically modified foods and seen little of the debate that has
raged in Europe and elsewhere over their safety.
</P>
<P>
   But in other Asia-Pacific nations, the controversy over
biotechnology has far exceeded its actual use. In India, Japan, New
Zealand, Thailand and the Philippines, consumer movements are
demanding controls on use of genetically modified crops.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents contend that genetically altering crops to resist
pests, drought or other adverse conditions may be the only way to
ensure food security in the developing world, particularly in
densely populated Asia, home to more than half of humanity.
</P>
<P>
   Such crops, they argue, can drastically reduce the need for
harmful pesticides, restore ravaged ecosystems and promote public
health with foods genetically enhanced with essential nutrients or
vaccines.
</P>
<P>
   But the technique of splicing genes from one organism onto
another has also provoked fears of freak, unforeseen hazards to
health and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   In Southeast Asia, only Singapore has come out strongly in favor
of biotechnology, viewing it as a promising new industry.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it is safe for the Americans, it is safe for us,'' says Lee
Sing Kong, a member of the Singapore government's Genetic
Modification Advisory Committee, brushing aside growing debate in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The source of the technology -- mainly the research labs of
governments and corporations in industrialized countries -- raises
political hackles too.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers in southern India torched cotton test fields operated by
St. Louis-based biotech giant Monsanto last year, complaining the
seeds were too expensive.
</P>
<P>
   In the Philippines, seven of 10 farmers are landless, renting
fields from landlords or working for large corporations like Dole
Foods. Leftist groups argue genetically modified crops will give
the companies that sell seeds and farm chemicals even greater
power.
</P>
<P>
   ''Big landlords and transnational corporations will call all the
shots,'' said Wim De Ceukelaire, a consultant for the Peasant
Movement of the Philippines. ''In the case of small farmers, it
means going deeper and deeper into debt.''
</P>
<P>
   The Peasant Movement plans demonstrations against genetically
modified foods later this year, joined by counterparts in Thailand,
India and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Genetic engineering has potentially explosive ramifications for
ethnically divided countries like Malaysia and Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   ''If people were aware that animal genes might be used in
plants, maybe from cows or pigs, there would be a lot of religious
objections from Hindus and Muslims,'' said Haji Muhammad Haji Abdul
Majid, a professor of biotechnology at the University of Malaya in
Kuala Lumpur.
</P>
<P>
   Such concerns are largely absent in China. Provincial and
central governments have backed research into genetic engineering.
Debate over biotechnology in the state-controlled media has been
muted.
</P>
<P>
   With controls on grain imports set to relax when China enters
the World Trade Organization, pressure is growing to boost farm
productivity and cut costs inflated by heavy use of expensive
pesticides.
</P>
<P>
   ''Production costs are relatively high, so grain prices are
high. Yet, we must bring rural incomes up. We can't push them down
any further. The only way out is to rely on agricultural
technology,'' says Zhu Zhen, deputy director of the Institute of
Genetics at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not just a scientific question. This is a political
question of paramount importance,'' he says as he watches
assistants tweeze tiny white boll worms onto transgenic corn
plants.
</P>
<P>
   In Hebei, where cotton crops were devastated in the first half
of the 1990s by boll worms, farmers have overwhelmingly chosen
biotechnology. Genetically modified cotton is also grown
extensively in neighboring Henan province and in Xinjiang, in the
remote northwest.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the genetically modified cotton grown in Hebei is
Monsanto's Bollgard brand, produced by a joint venture set up in
1997. Monsanto plans further joint ventures in several other
provinces, according to company spokesman David Li.
</P>
<P>
   The company is also testing boll worm-resistant corn in two
northeastern provinces. Locally developed transgenic sweet peppers
and tomatoes are also sold, although they have proved less popular.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're the small type, and people don't like their taste,''
said Meng, the seed seller in Baoding, 90 miles southwest of
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   So far, China has no restrictions on imports of genetically
modified agricultural commodities, such as soybeans, and there are
no labeling requirements for imported processed foods, which may
contain genetically modified products.
</P>
<P>
   Still, not even China has entirely evaded the public backlash
against biotechnology.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to popularize use of genetically modified tobacco were
abandoned after international corporations like Philip Morris
announced they would buy only unaltered tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   Fears of such troubles have prompted a number of Asian countries
to adopt tight controls on genetic research and farming.
</P>
<P>
   India, the world's third-largest producer of cotton, allows
field testing of genetically altered cotton only under close
government supervision. Commercial cultivation is banned. Likewise
for Thailand, the world's largest rice exporter.
</P>
<P>
   New Zealand has declared a ''voluntary'' moratorium on
dissemination of biotechnology pending an inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   With surveys showing 80 percent of the Japanese public reluctant
to buy genetically altered foods, the government adopted labeling
and safety screening requirements, to take effect in April 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese scientists have been quietly researching genetic
modification of tomatoes, rice, potatoes, melon and corn for years.
Demands for greater accountability followed Tokyo's announcement
last year that beef from cloned cows had been sold unmarked for at
least two years.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers like Zhu of the Chinese Academy of Sciences worry
that public opposition could scuttle work on genetically engineered
grains, such as ''golden rice,'' a variety developed in a Swiss
laboratory that is high in vitamin A. Advocates believe it could
help prevent deaths and blindness among millions of malnourished
children each year.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do not seek to promote biotech. We only want the freedom to
do the research to get the facts,'' says Duncan McIntosh, spokesman
for the International Rice Research Institute in the Philippine
capital, Manila. ''Vitamin A rice: Is it edible? Does it work? Is
it commercially feasible for farmers? Will Asians want to eat
yellow rice in the first place?''
</P>
<P>
   Wary of the brewing controversy, researchers at the rice
institute are searching the 92,000 rice varieties in their gene
bank for those naturally rich in key nutrients.
</P>
<P>
   Tests found that a conventional rice variety unusually high in
iron and zinc was useful in treating anemia -- another severe health
problem in poor countries.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a very exciting concept to be able to use a staple food
that feeds half the world to solve public health problems. But
biotechnology needs to be kept in perspective,'' McIntosh says.
''The same concept sometimes can work with traditional varieties.''

<HEADLINE> Turkish Settlers Having Trouble  </HEADLINE>
By HARMONIE TOROS
<TEXT>
<P>
   FAMAGUSTA, Cyprus (AP) -- Even after 25 years in Cyprus, Fatma
Dagli says she still sticks with her own people -- Turks from
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Dagli shares the ethnic background, language and Muslim faith of
Turkish Cypriots, but she married a fellow settler from Turkey and
lives in a neighborhood populated almost entirely by Turks who
moved to the island after the 1974 Turkish invasion.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's easier to find an understanding amongst ourselves,'' says
Dagli, wearing a traditional Anatolian head scarf, which is rarely
worn by secular, Western-oriented Turkish Cypriot women. ''They
resemble us, but they are different.''
</P>
<P>
   Greek Cypriots insist that when a solution to the island's
26-year division is reached, the tens of thousands of Turkish
settlers must leave.
</P>
<P>
   Turks and Turkish Cypriots say the settlers must be allowed to
stay, but their unity masks the deep gaps between native Turkish
Cypriots and Turks from Turkey, many of whom have failed to
integrate into Cypriot society.
</P>
<P>
   The future of the settlers is one of the thorny issues that will
confront Greek and Turkish Cypriot leaders when they meet July 5 in
Geneva for a scheduled third round of talks with U.N. negotiators
as go-betweens.
</P>
<P>
   Many Turkish Cypriots are also concerned that the settlers, who
form a strong electoral bloc, may hinder prospects of uniting the
island out of fear they will be forced to return to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Turkish and Turkish Cypriot leaders encouraged Turks to come to
Cyprus to populate land abandoned by Greek Cypriots after the
Turkish invasion, which followed an Athens-backed coup by
supporters of union with Greece. The invasion left 30 percent of
the island's territory in the hands of Turkish Cypriots, who made
up just 18 percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the settlers were landless farmers who suddenly found
themselves in one of the most Westernized parts of the Turkish
world.
</P>
<P>
   ''They didn't send people who fit with the Cypriot culture.
People who didn't have a profession, who didn't have education came
here,'' says Kemal Bayram, a Turk who moved to Cyprus in 1974 and
set up a printing shop in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
   There is no official figure of how many Turks moved to northern
Cyprus after the Turkish invasion. Estimates range from 30,000 to
80,000 settlers, among a total Turkish population on Cyprus of
200,000.
</P>
<P>
   Many Turkish Cypriots can cite ways in which they have grown to
be different from mainland Turks after centuries of living
alongside Greek Cypriots and 80 years under British rule.
</P>
<P>
   ''The main difference between us is culture,'' says Hasan
Kahvecioglu, a political commentator for Cypriot television. The
Turkish settlers ''have crowded families, they have different
attitudes in their business relations, and they carry weapons,
which is not part of Cypriot culture.''
</P>
<P>
   In politics, the Turkish Cypriot leftist opposition has long
argued that Turkey used to urge the settlers to vote for
center-right leader Rauf Denktash, a staunch defender of Turkey's
right to influence Cypriot affairs.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent presidential elections, the settler vote more
closely matched the patterns of Turkish Cypriots -- proof, some
argue, that the settlers are becoming more integrated into Cypriot
society.
</P>
<P>
   Denktash won the last election but faced a serious challenge
from his prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   And most admit that tension between the two Turkish communities
has eased over the years and point at the integration of the
settlers' children, who even speak Turkish with a Cypriot accent.
</P>
<P>
   But in the village of Ulukisla, outside Nicosia, the only
Cypriot inhabitants are the few who married Turkish settlers.
</P>
<P>
   The farmers, who sit sipping strong tea in the village's
traditional Anatolian-style teahouse, are reluctant to speak of
their relations with Turkish Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
   They will, however, voice their conviction that had Turkish
troops not invaded the island, Turkish Cypriots would have been
killed or expelled by Greek Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
   ''We fought for this land,'' Ahmet Cetiner says. ''We are going
nowhere.''

<HEADLINE> Cuba Presses Against U.S. Policies  </HEADLINE>
By ANITA SNOW
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- In the wake of Elian Gonzalez's return to Cuba,
Fidel Castro's government pushed ahead Monday with a new propaganda
campaign against decades-old U.S. policies aimed at punishing the
communist island.
</P>
<P>
   It remained unclear, however, if authorities can motivate Cubans
with a campaign that deals with ideas rather than a photogenic
6-year-old child and his distressed father.
</P>
<P>
   Marches, rallies, debates and forums will be held ''every day of
the year'' for an indefinite period, the Communist Party daily
Granma said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''There will be no weariness or wavering,'' it said. ''The
battle of ideas ... enters a new and prolonged chapter.''
</P>
<P>
   It encouraged Cubans to collect the special editions state-run
newspapers will be publishing in the coming weeks about U.S.
policies toward Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The new campaign appears designed to educate Cubans about U.S.
laws and policies the government abhors, such as long-standing
American trade sanctions against the island and the Cuban
Adjustment Act, a law that allows Cubans who reach U.S. soil to
stay and apply for permanent residency.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the government hopes to transform the
enthusiastic support that Cubans showed for a little boy who had
lost his mother into vocal, visual support for the communist
government's battle against American policies.
</P>
<P>
   Every Saturday, a huge rally will be held in a different
provincial city, just as they have been held every week in recent
months to demand Elian's return to his homeland, Granma said. The
newspaper said that a live televised round-table will be held every
weekday evening, much like the ones that for months updated Cubans
on developments in the Elian case.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba organized more than 100 rallies in the seven months that
Elian was in the United States, calling out hundreds of thousands
of Cubans to show popular support for bringing the boy home.
</P>
<P>
   Elian and his family have remained out of public view since
shortly after their return last Wednesday. They are staying at a
specially prepared boarding school in Havana, where they will live
for two or three weeks along with Elian's classmates and teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Later, they will take a one-week holiday and return to their
hometown of Cardenas, a small port city east of Havana.
</P>
<P>
   Also out of the public eye has been Castro himself, who was not
at the airport when Elian came home and has not been seen with the
family since they returned. It is not known if the Cuban president
has met privately with them.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba blames the Cuban Adjustment Act, in particular, for the
international custody battle over Elian.
</P>
<P>
   The communist government maintains the policy encourages Cubans
to make risky crossings to the United States, despite migration
accords that require the U.S. Coast Guard to repatriate them if
they are intercepted at sea.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Players Help Fight Prostitution  </HEADLINE>
By THAKSINA KHAIKAEW
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAN HUIYA, Thailand (AP) -- Cows mooed, water buffaloes stared
and the locals wondered what a caravan carrying 13 young American
women was doing on a muddy track heading for a remote hill tribe
village in northern Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   They were members of the women's basketball team at Carleton
College in Northfield, Minn., -- trying, through sport, to help
impoverished girls resist being lured into Thailand's vast sex
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanied by coaches and family members, the students spent
two weeks in hill tribe villages, stalking grounds for middlemen
who trick vulnerable teen-agers or buy them from their desperate
parents to work in brothels and massage parlors.
</P>
<P>
   ''Any activity that is taught girls always helps them gain
confidence. We want basketball to be part of their routine
activities, to help them gain respect for themselves,'' said
Bridget Seeger, 21, of Elkhorn, Wis.
</P>
<P>
   During their stay, the group slept on mattresses on the floor of
a community dormitory and used primitive bathrooms. Parents, some
of them doctors and psychiatrists, provided free treatment to the
villagers.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's an eye-opener to meet people from such a different
culture and lifestyle. I don't speak their language but I can use
basketball as a bridge to link us. Sport is universal and
especially when we are female, we are connected,'' said Cassie
Glasrud, 21, of Spring Grove, Minn.
</P>
<P>
   Some 320 children of the Karen tribe and other ethnic groups,
many barefoot and wearing ragged uniforms, attend the school at Ban
Huiya, 360 miles north of the Thai capital, Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
   Built by Japanese aid money, the concrete-surface basketball
court, is the school's only luxury.
</P>
<P>
   ''Basketball is little known in jungle village schools even
though we have a court and equipment. But we have no skills. It's a
good opportunity for our students and teachers to gain firsthand
experience from American basketball players,'' said school
principal Udom Chuenchuprai.
</P>
<P>
   Wrestling with the language barrier, the Americans nonetheless
managed to demonstrate the basics of basketball, which is becoming
increasingly popular in Thailand, during their June 12-29 stay.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are fast learners. They have picked things up quickly,''
said team coach Tammy Metcalf-Filzen, 38.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the students were also enthusiastic.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our school has the best women's volleyball team in the
district. I hope after the visit of the Americans, my school will
set up its own women's basketball team to compete with other
schools,'' said 13-year-old Laddawan Phetpichitchai.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had no chance to learn about basketball because I graduated
before we had the court. I am sure the game will help players
physically and mentally,'' said Kanya Yingsinsuthad, a recent
graduate, watching her younger friends dribbling and passing.
</P>
<P>
   The American women did some learning of their own before
undertaking the project, focusing on the sex industry in Thailand,
which a recent United Nations report says employs as many as
300,000 women. Other experts say the numbers are far higher.
</P>
<P>
   The players also toured Patpong Road, Bangkok's notorious red
light district.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have read a lot about it. But seeing it is completely
different. I just wanted to scream at those Western guys who were
with Thai girls and ask if they knew what they were doing,'' said
Renee Willette, a 19-year-old political science and women's studies
major from Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   ''We all realize there is no quick fix. But building awareness
is what we want to establish within the girls,'' Willette added.
</P>
<P>
   Aid worker Lothansiami Ralte of the Karen Resource Development
Program thinks it can.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tribal women are more vulnerable to all kinds of exploitation
facilitated by roads linking towns to their villages. What we can
do here is help them choose good rather than bad influences,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The visits are a golden opportunity for our girls to learn the
game from the Americans,'' Ralte said. ''But I hope they will also
think, 'If the American girls can do this much, why not us?'''

<HEADLINE> Mongolians Turn To Ex-Communists  </HEADLINE>
By JOSEPH COLEMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   ULAN BATOR, Mongolia (AP) -- Frustrated with painful reform and
disgusted with government corruption, Mongolians have turned to the
political force that represents the stability they long for: the
former communists.
</P>
<P>
   But the overwhelming victory of the Mongolian People's
Revolutionary Party over the reformist government in Sunday's
parliamentary elections won't mean a return to Soviet-style
economics, party leaders said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We cannot afford to go back,'' N. Enkhbayar, the next expected
prime minister, insisted in an interview with The Associated Press
before the vote. ''We cannot survive if we go back.''
</P>
<P>
   An unofficial tally on Monday showed Enkhbayar's party winning a
stunning 72 of the 76 seats in Mongolia's unicameral Parliament.
The government was expected to release official returns on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that victory, most Mongolians don't want to delve too
far into the MPRP's past.
</P>
<P>
   Mongolia became a people's republic under Bolshevik influence in
1921, and the precursor of the MPRP established total control. The
party changed to its current name and declared the world's second
communist country in 1924.
</P>
<P>
   The 1930s brought forced collectivization of land. Buddhist
monks were slaughtered and their land confiscated. Private business
was banned.
</P>
<P>
   Though the regime softened somewhat in the 1950s, Mongolia was
firmly in the Soviet sphere until the Soviet Union started to
falter and a peaceful populist movement brought down hard-line
communism in Mongolia in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   While few voters seemed to yearn for a return to the old days,
the rapid pace of change since the end of communism has been tough
on Mongolia -- making many nostalgic for the stability of years
past.
</P>
<P>
   ''In my childhood I learned under the MPRP, and I was educated
and brought up by the MPRP,'' said S. Chimet, a retired soldier in
Ulan Bator. ''So my whole life has been under the MPRP.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Mongolia has emerged from the fuel shortages and empty
store shelves of the early 1990s, the rapid pace of change has
taken its toll.
</P>
<P>
   Street children spend the winters sleeping next to subterranean
hot-water pipes to keep warm in the capital, and more than
one-third the population lives under the poverty line. Unemployment
can hit 65 percent in some towns.
</P>
<P>
   Much of voter distaste for the reformists also came from the
appearance of dirty politicking and influence-peddling. Three
members of the reformist coalition were jailed in a casino scandal,
and the murder of a popular Cabinet minister and pro-democracy
figure has gone unsolved.
</P>
<P>
   ''The people of Mongolia are hesitating and wondering about
democracy because of the democratic parties' policies,'' said
Gandi, an MPRP lawmaker. Like many Mongolians, she only uses one
name.
</P>
<P>
   Still, given the changes that a decade of democracy and
capitalism have brought to Mongolia, it's hard to imagine things
could ever return to the way they were.
</P>
<P>
   The first floors of dozens of Soviet-style apartment blocks have
been rapidly transformed into privately owned shops. Cellular
phones -- unheard of only a year ago -- have become a rage in the
past few months.
</P>
<P>
   Economic growth hit a respectable 3.3 percent last year. And the
role of the private sector in gross domestic product has risen from
3 percent a decade ago to about 70 percent today.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the lopsided victory in Sunday's election, few
Mongolians really expected a return to state control of the
economy. Too much, they say, has already changed.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's impossible to bring back the old system,'' said
Nyamdulam, a computer engineer in Ulan Bator.

<HEADLINE> Buffalo homicide rate cause for alarm  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) - Halfway through 2000, Buffalo homicides
were running 61 percent ahead of last year, leading some to wonder
if the city's five-year trend of decreasing murder rates is about
to end.
</P>
<P>
   The first half of this year ended June 30 with a total of 21
killings, compared to 13 homicides for the same time period a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not sure what to attribute the rise in the numbers to,''
said Homicide Chief Joseph Riga, ''but you have to keep in mind
that we're coming off a substantially low number of homicides for
1999.''
</P>
<P>
   There were 32 city homicides in all of last year.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Police Commissioner Mark Blankenberg said an overall
slackening of discipline in homes and schools seems to have created
a lack of respect for others among young people.
</P>
<P>
   ''The 'me generation' may have something to do with this,'' he
told The Buffalo News. ''These people don't care what they do, even
if it affects hundreds of other people. They just care about
themselves and don't want anyone to get in their way.''
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the state, Rochester recorded 23 murders in the
first six months of the year, compared with 21 last year. There
were three Albany homicides, compared with 10 during the first half
of last year.
</P>
<P>
   New York City, meanwhile, recorded 333 murders, a 2.4 percent
rise over the same period in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   In Buffalo early Saturday, Darian Clark, 28, and a friend were
standing outside a private social club arguing with two men when
another man walked up and shot Clark between the eyes, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The slaying was the third in four days. A motive remains
unknown.
</P>
<P>
   In other cases, Jericho Stock, 30, was fatally shot in the back
Thursday while talking on a pay phone. On Wednesday, John McCain,
24, was shot several times in front of his home. Police said
McCain's shooter was a friend of a 13-year-old teen-ager whom
McCain had been fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Homicide rates have been decreasing in Buffalo since 1995, when
there were 62 killings, down from a high of 92 in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Russian Bribery of Traffic Cops Up  </HEADLINE>
By NICK WADHAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- They can be seen pacing up and down the dividing
line or standing in wait at tricky corners where motorists will
sometimes bend the rules to save a few minutes on Russia's decrepit
roads.
</P>
<P>
   They are the traffic police, known for their gray uniforms and
the white and black batons that flash out to wave a driver to the
curb. And they are also known for their love of bribes, large and
small.
</P>
<P>
   It is one of the most notable displays of corruption pervading
Russian life, and hundreds of jokes poke fun at the payoff-prone
cop. There were plenty told on Monday, the 64th anniversary of the
State Traffic Control Inspectorate. Officers nationwide -- those who
weren't on duty -- held celebrations to mark the holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Even police acknowledge bribe-taking is a fact of life, but say
traffic cops aren't the only ones to blame.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bribes are accepted because they are offered,'' said traffic
inspectorate spokeswoman Lyudmila Tosheva. ''There's no such case
where you can blame one side or the other.''
</P>
<P>
   Though they lament the corruption, some drivers find relief in
the institution. A bribe is often an easy way to avoid the
bureaucratic hassles of paying for a formally issued ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's an old habit,'' said Sergei Pozhedayev, a sales manager
at a Moscow auto shop. ''If you break the law a little, just give
them 50 rubles ($1.70) and you go on your way.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian law allows police officers to confiscate motorists'
licenses for even minor violations, meaning the driver usually has
to spend half a day paying a fine at the bank and going to the
police with a receipt to get the license back.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very convenient,'' said a Moscow driver who identified
himself as Sergei. ''Let's say that I haven't gotten my car
inspected and I get stopped, it's a lot easier for me to slip a
little money into his pocket on the spot.''
</P>
<P>
   The lack of discipline has its dangers. Though the country has a
zero-tolerance law for drunk drivers, policemen will look the other
way for a price, though it could cost hundreds of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The chief of Russia's traffic police, Lt. Gen. Vladimir
Fyodorov, said Monday that 29,000 people died in traffic accidents
in Russia last year. In the United States, the number was more than
41,000, but Russia has far fewer cars on the road because they are
too expensive for most Russians.
</P>
<P>
   Bribes are also a crucial source of income for traffic cops,
whose salaries hover around $60 a month. Some drivers sympathize.
</P>
<P>
   ''We all have to get by somehow,'' said 23-year-old Yuri
Abramov, a truck driver. ''That's how they do it -- by taking from
us.''

<HEADLINE> Penguins Starving in South Africa  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE COHEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   DASSEN ISLAND, South Africa (AP) -- Penguin chicks began to die
from starvation Monday on an island off South Africa's west coast
after their parents were evacuated to save them from an oil spill.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of dead chicks lay in their burrows on Dassen Island.
Hundreds of other weakened baby birds' ribs stuck out. Seagulls
attacked unattended chicks.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very difficult to take adults off nests when we know the
chicks are going to be abandoned ... but all us realize it's the
only option we have at the moment,'' said Anton Wolfhaardt, manager
of the island nature reserve. ''If we are able to save as many
adult birds as we can, those birds can come back and start
breeding.''
</P>
<P>
   Dassen Island's total population of African penguins is more
than 55,000 -- the world's largest colony of the endangered birds,
which are found only off the coast of southern Africa. More than
5,000 birds were captured Monday for evacuation, Wolfhaardt said.
That was in addition to more than 3,000 caught and shipped out
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The problem here began last Wednesday, when an oil slick from
the tanker Treasure, which sank June 23 off the coast of Cape Town,
reached Dassen Island, about 37 miles northwest of the city. The
penguins were fenced in Friday to stop them from going into the
polluted sea to fish.
</P>
<P>
   But the fences had to be removed to avoid starving the birds on
the island. Left with no other choice, workers began hauling the
birds from their burrows Sunday and evacuating them.
</P>
<P>
   Conservationists had insufficient resources to relocate the
entire colony. Those birds that were not captured by Monday were to
be allowed to return to the sea to feed and take their chances with
the slick.
</P>
<P>
   The uncontaminated birds captured on Dassen Island, meanwhile,
were shipped to the mainland, trucked about eight hours up the
coast and released to fend for themselves. More than 3,000 of the
penguins were released into the ocean 560 miles up the coast Monday
to begin the long swim home.
</P>
<P>
   They are expected to swim home within about 11 days. Authorities
hope that will give them enough time to clean up the spill.
</P>
<P>
   The birds had dealt very well with the ordeal of being put in
boxes, taken by boat and helicopter off the island and then trucked
to the town of Port Elizabeth, said Aletta van der Merwe, a
spokeswoman for Western Cape Nature Conservation. ''We only had one
mortality and three minor injuries,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, rehabilitation centers in Cape Town battled to feed
an estimated 20,000 oil-coated penguins, most of which were taken
off Robben Island, about four miles off the coast.
</P>
<P>
   Rehabilitating the oil-coated birds will be a mammoth task -- it
takes two people about an hour to clean each bird. Once cleaned,
the birds need to be hand-fed for up to two months before their
coats again become waterproof so that they can swim in the sea.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need more than 1,000 volunteers a day, and got half of this
yesterday,'' said Christina Pretorius, a spokeswoman for the
Southern African National Foundation for the Conservation of
Coastal Birds.

<HEADLINE> Cow 'doctor' hired to repair statues from vandals  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) - A cow ''doctor'' has been hired to repair
Fiberglas cows vandalized by people who have tipped, scratched and
ripped off horns from the decorative bovines on display downtown.
</P>
<P>
   About a dozen cow statues have been damaged since being put on
show last month in Stamford. A total of 67 life-size decorated cows
are scattered throughout the city center in a whimsical public art
exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   One cow near the Stamford branch of the University of
Connecticut was tipped over and had a horn ripped off, while a red
nose on a ''hobo cow'' at Veterans Park has been stolen twice. A
golf club was snatched from the mouth of another cow. Still others
have been scratched, or have missing eyelashes and earrings.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Munce, a Redding artist who has been hired to repair the
statutes, has been dubbed ''The Cow Doctor'' by Sandra Goldstein,
executive director of the Downtown Special Services District, the
agency sponsoring the cow display.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think our biggest problem really relates to the fact that
people have too much love for these cows,'' Goldstein said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is so much interaction between the cows and hundreds of
children who come and sit on, kiss and hug the cows.''
</P>
<P>
   Whenever a cow is damaged, Munce makes repairs.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've dealt with everything from (damage caused) by banging and
scratching on the paint to things being broken off,'' said Munce, a
metal sculptor.
</P>
<P>
   Similar problems have been reported in other cities with cow
displays.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City last week, a cow on display in the Richmond
Heights section of Queens was stolen. It was later recovered. Some
of the cows have also been covered by graffiti.
</P>
<P>
   In Buffalo, N.Y., statues of bison have been vandalized. One of
the buffaloes was tipped over and had a horn pulled off.
</P>
<P>
   The CowParade in Stamford is funded by a $50,000 state art grant
and corporate and individual sponsors who paid $7,500 for each cow.
</P>
<P>
   A ''cattle auction'' will be held in October with 75 percent of
the proceeds donated to the charity of the buyer's choice.

<HEADLINE> Report: FBI believes municipal judge had role in Passaic County bribery scheme </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HACKENSACK, N.J. (AP) - The FBI believes a lawyer who serves as
a Municipal Court judge for Totowa was the middleman for a bribery
scheme in which the former Passaic County administrator has been
charged, according to a published report.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, Albert C. Lisbona, has not been charged.
</P>
<P>
   FBI agents in the case against the ex-administrator, Nicola R.
DiDonna, said Lisbona made several telephone calls to advance the
scheme, according to two sworn statements they filed that were
reviewed by The Record of Hackensack.
</P>
<P>
   The documents do not say whether Lisbona profited from his role.
</P>
<P>
   DiDonna, who was Passaic's top appointed official when indicted
in September, faces trial this fall.
</P>
<P>
   The three-year investigation into corruption in Passaic County
has garnered guilty pleas from several officials, including a
former state assemblyman, A. Joseph ''Buddy'' Fortunato.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Fortunato was a consultant for Central Medical Services
Inc., of Union, and wanted to speak to Passaic County GOP chairman
Peter Murphy to win a county contract for his client. At the time,
the county freeholders were all Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Lisbona, a close associate of Murphy, introduced Fortunato to
Murphy, according to one of the affidavits.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said they developed a plan for Fortunato to funnel
bribes to four Murphy associates, and Central Medical got several
contracts for work at the Passaic County Jail.
</P>
<P>
   The ''advisory panel'' did no actual work, federal prosecutors
maintain. The panelists or their attorneys have denied that the
payments were bribes, the newspaper said. Murphy and its members
have not been charged.
</P>
<P>
   In Monday's editions, the newspaper said Lisbona declined
repeated requests for an interview and that his attorney, Anthony
R. Mautone, did not return telephone calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Lisbona and Mautone did not immediately return messages from The
Associated Press left Monday, when their offices appeared to be
closed for the upcoming Fourth of July holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Lisbona, a municipal judge since January 1978 and a lawyer for
32 years, has no disciplinary action pending against him, David E.
Johnson Jr., director of the state Supreme Court's Office of
Attorney Ethics, said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials involved in the DiDonna case did not return
messages Monday seeking comment on Lisbona.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunato met with Murphy and DiDonna at Murphy's restaurant in
Totowa in May 1994. Murphy said Central Medical would get work if
the company made payments to four people, and DiDonna ''stated that
he would give CMSI work in the prison system,'' one affidavit said.
</P>
<P>
   Lisbona later called Fortunato and told him to get the names of
the ''advisory panel'' from Murphy. The four were Undersheriff John
Bonazzi; DiDonna's father, Joseph, who has since died; Totowa Tax
Assessor Curt Masklee, and Totowa Democrat Joseph DiPasquale,
according to court papers.
</P>
<P>
   DiDonna recommended Central Medical to the freeholders, who
awarded the company a contract in July 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The panelists got their first payments in October 1994, and
Lisbona ''intermittently telephoned CMSI's principals to tell them
when it was time to make subsequent payments to the panel,'' an
affidavit said.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, the company was late in making payments.
''According to Fortunato ... Lisbona contacted Fortunato and
indicated that Murphy was angry because the panel had not been
paid,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Fortunato, who cooperated with investigators,
agents who prepared the affidavits relied on conversations secretly
recorded by the company's two founders as early as 1996, the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
   Lisbona is a partner in the Fairfield law firm of Dwyer, Connell
&AMP; Lisbona. Over the past decade, it has earned $3.3 million working
for the county and has given at least $41,000 in political
contributions to county Republicans, The Record said.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment against DiDonna charged he worked with an unnamed
''party official to steer lucrative contracts'' totaling $900,000
to an unnamed contractor in exchange for the contractor paying
$70,000 to politically connected people chosen by the party
official.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy is the official, according to unnamed sources cited by
The Record.
</P>
<P>
   Of the payments, $17,000 went to DiDonna's father, who ran a
construction business in Clifton and died in March 1999.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Concerned About Mergers  </HEADLINE>
By KALPANA SRINIVASAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Thirty senators are voicing opposition to
foreign government-owned companies taking over U.S.
telecommunications businesses, amid reports that German carrier
Deutsche Telekom is looking at snapping up long-distance giant
Sprint Corp.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the head of the Federal Communications
Commission, Sen. Fritz Hollings, D-S.C., and 29 other lawmakers
said acquisitions by government-owned foreign firms raise serious
national security concerns and ''would be putting domestic
competitors at the mercy of a foreign government. No country should
allow this.''
</P>
<P>
   They urged FCC Chairman William Kennard to heavily scrutinize
any such deals brought before his agency.
</P>
<P>
   That could complicate efforts by German communications business
Deutsche Telekom, which is reportedly eyeing No. 3 U.S.
long-distance company Sprint as a possible acquisition. The German
company -- a former state telephone monopoly -- is majority owned by
the government.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Telekom has emerged as a leading candidate to acquire
Sprint after regulators on two continents scuttled the U.S.
company's planned merger with WorldCom Inc. Analysts have
speculated that Deutsche Telekom might now make a move for Sprint
in which it already holds 10 percent of Sprint.
</P>
<P>
   Communications law prohibits the FCC from approving acquisitions
by telecommunications companies that are more than 25 percent
foreign government owned. However, the commission can waive this
limit if it determines that the deal is in the public interest, and
a recent telecommunications agreement suggested that the limit
could be overridden if the foreign government was a member of the
World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Hollings introduced legislation last week that would essentially
take away the FCC's latitude in this area. The measure would forbid
any foreign company owned more than 25 percent by its government
from taking over a U.S. telecommunications business.
</P>
<P>
   In their letter, Hollings and the bipartisan list of senators
noted that other WTO member countries, including Italy and Spain,
already have such a policy in place.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers asserted that they are not opposed to investment
by foreign companies, but believe an outright acquisition by a
government owned entity could thwart the competitive market in the
United States. They also fear that such deals could give foreign
government's access to the U.S. telecommunications infrastructure
and compromise national security.
</P>
<P>
   ''We would urge that you highly scrutinize any merger involving
foreign government owned providers,'' the senators wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Kennard last week refused to speculate on whether such deals
would trigger concerns at his agency, saying he did not want to
comment on reported acquisitions of U.S. carriers by foreign
companies.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just don't want to get into that at this point,'' he said.
''It's too premature.''
</P>
<P>
   And WorldCom and Sprint have yet to officially call off their
own merger, although the companies face steep opposition from
regulators. The Justice Department last week mounted a court
challenge to the merger, while the European Union formally rejected
the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are still looking at the WorldCom merger situation,'' said
Sprint spokesman James Fisher on Monday. He said the companies
expect to make an announcement in the coming days on the fate of
the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher declined to comment on reports that Deutsche Telekom has
discussed purchasing Sprint in a deal that would run about $117
billion. That would give the German company a foothold in the U.S.
market, after earlier this year backing off its pursuit of
long-distance carrier Qwest. Qwest already was in the midst of a
merger with Bell company U S West, which it recently completed.

<HEADLINE> Federal program helps disabled people find jobs, become independent </HEADLINE>
By DEEPTI HAJELA
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Samuel Vasquez can measure his freedom.
</P>
<P>
   He does it every day, when he climbs the narrow, double-helix
staircase that winds from the pedestal to the crown of the Statue
of Liberty. Up one set of 146 steps, then down, sweeping them along
the way. Then repeating on the other staircase.
</P>
<P>
   Cleaning those 292 steps once a day, five days a week, is part
of Vasquez's job as part of the custodial team that maintains the
interior of the statue. It's a job that the learning-disabled
36-year-old got through a federal act that provides work
opportunities for disabled Americans.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't climb up the stairs, he sprints up, a physical sign
of how much he loves his job and appreciates how far he's come from
the days of working whatever construction or seasonal work he could
find.
</P>
<P>
   ''Before, I didn't have that confidence ... At the time, I was
living day-to-day,'' he said. Now, ''I make more than I ever made
in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   The Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act allows the U.S. government to buy
some goods and services from disabled people through contracts with
numerous nonprofit community agencies around the country, such as
Fedcap Rehabilitation Services, the New York-based agency Vasquez
works for. Goods can include anything from military clothing to
office supplies, and services can range from food service to
medical transcription.
</P>
<P>
   For Vasquez, whose dyslexia had him dropping out of high school
after 10th grade, his custodial job has meant employee benefits, a
salary high enough to let him send one of his daughters to Catholic
school, a new car, and he hopes, a business of his own soon.
</P>
<P>
   It's a level of financial freedom and hope for his future that
the Staten Island resident never had before.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would get frustrated, I would give up. ... Every time I
wanted to go fill an application out, I didn't understand what it
said,'' Vasquez said.
</P>
<P>
   He used to rely on government aid. Not anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would never want to go back to letting the government
support me,'' Vasquez said recently, looking out of Lady Liberty's
crown. ''Through this job, I know ... what independence is.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the 1938 Wagner-O'Day Act, agencies that helped blind
people were allowed to sell brooms and mops the blind made to the
government. In 1971, after a push led by Sen. Jacob Javits, it was
amended to include Americans with other disabilities as well.
</P>
<P>
   The program is administered by an independent federal agency
which decides which items and services the government will buy and
at what price.
</P>
<P>
   Then two nonprofit agencies, the National Industries for the
Blind and NISH (formerly the National Institute for the Severely
Handicapped), funnel the contracts to local community organizations
around the country.
</P>
<P>
   More than 30,000 disabled people around the country have gotten
jobs through the program, and the projects generated more than $700
million in sales in fiscal year 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Local agencies train participants in the program for their jobs,
and then pay them after they start working, said Susan Fonfa,
executive director of Fedcap.
</P>
<P>
   Fedcap employs more than 1,400 people at sites throughout the
New York metropolitan area. Vasquez is one of 15 employed through a
contract with the National Parks Service to maintain the statue and
Ellis Island.
</P>
<P>
   ''We work with people who have never worked, or who haven't been
successful,'' Fonfa said. ''They are really learning to be workers.
They are very proud of what they do.''

<HEADLINE> Harry Potter Fans Awaiting Big Day  </HEADLINE>
By BETH GARDINER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The countdown is more suspenseful than a
high-stakes game of Quidditch. The anxiety can't even be cured by
one of Professor Severus Snape's magic potions.
</P>
<P>
   Devotees of the Harry Potter books that have captured the
imaginations of millions of readers have only days to wait before
they can lose themselves in the fourth installment of the boy
wizard's magical adventures.
</P>
<P>
   An unprecedented 5.3 million copies of ''Harry Potter and the
Goblet of Fire'' will be released Saturday in the United States and
Britain. For any other children's book, even 500,000 is considered
a large first printing.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a once-in-a-generation kind of thing,'' said Diane
Roback, children's books editor at Publishers Weekly.
</P>
<P>
   Bookstores around the country are planning Harry Potter parties
and staying open late so they can sell ''Goblet of Fire'' at 12:01
a.m. on publication day. In Britain, author J.K. Rowling will start
a promotional train tour at ''Platform 9&AMP;frac34;'' of London's Kings Cross
Station, where Harry and friends catch the train each fall to
Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
</P>
<P>
   Advance orders of the book have pushed it to No. 1 on
Amazon.com's best-seller list for 16 of the past 21 weeks, and the
first three volumes occupy three of the fifteen spots on The New
York Times list.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon has already sold more than 265,000 copies of ''Goblet of
Fire.'' That dwarfs Amazon's biggest previous advance sale, 43,000
copies of John Grisham's ''The Brethren.''
</P>
<P>
   A Wal-Mart in Virginia broke the embargo last week when it put
the books on shelves. About 20 copies were sold to lucky youngsters
before the store realized the books weren't supposed to be out and
quickly removed them, a Wal-Mart spokesman said. Another store in
Virginia also jumped the gun.
</P>
<P>
   A wall of secrecy as impenetrable as that surrounding the
devious scheming of Harry's nemesis Voldemort has guarded the
book's plot, heightening fans' anticipation.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is nothing you could compare this to,'' said Linda
Wilkinson, manager of Adventures for Kids, a bookstore in Ventura,
Calif. ''We've been planning for months now, and we're getting
close to the countdown.''
</P>
<P>
   Many booksellers credit the Potter series with boosting sales of
children's literature generally and bringing new popularity to
fantasy stories, which have been overshadowed in recent years by
more reality-based children's books, such as those by Judy Blume.
</P>
<P>
   How has a generation of kids raised on video games and the
Internet become so wrapped up in the twisting, turning, multivolume
tale of an orphaned young wizard?
</P>
<P>
   Most credit Rowling's storytelling skills. The first three books
chronicle Harry's miserable life with his aunt and uncle, Vernon
and Petunia Dursley, his initiation into a world of magic at
Hogwarts, and his plunge into a series of life-and-death adventures
with pals Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger.
</P>
<P>
   The stories are packed with clever bits of fancy -- every-flavor
jelly beans that taste like liver, tripe and sprouts, a vicious
three-headed dog named Fluffy and the Nimbus 2000, a high-velocity
flying broom used for playing Quidditch, wizardry's favorite sport.
</P>
<P>
   Harry ''is a lonely boy who's rescued from a wretched
existence,'' said Publishers Weekly's Roback. ''He goes to this
boarding school where he has these magical powers, and he's treated
like a hero. He goes from rags to riches, and that's really
appealing to kids. He's an every-kid that a lot of kids can relate
to.''
</P>
<P>
   Fantasy books have long been a staple of children's literature --
C.S. Lewis' Narnia series, Madeleine L'Engle's ''A Wrinkle in
Time'' and J.R.R. Tolkien's ''Lord of the Rings'' are all classics.
But in recent years, more popular kids' books have focused on real
life, taking place in schools and dealing with issues like family
trouble and problems with friends.
</P>
<P>
   Booksellers say the runaway success of the Potter series is
helping revive children's interest in fantasy books.
</P>
<P>
   ''Almost nothing in their lives is left up to imagination
anymore, because of television, because of video games that are so
violent,'' said Caron Chapman, executive director of the
Minneapolis-based Association of Booksellers for Children. ''The
balance tipped on the side of overload on facts and reality, and it
now needs to be balanced with a little more daydreaming and a
little more imagination.''
</P>
<P>
   But will grade-schoolers really be willing to crack a 752-page
book (the British edition, with different design and illustrations,
is closer to 600 pages), even if it does star a character they
already know?
</P>
<P>
   Roback said that the length is unusual and that the youngest
readers might find it daunting. Older children, though, are
unlikely to be deterred, particularly if they are already hooked on
Harry, she said.

<HEADLINE> 54 Killed in Chechen Truck Bombings  </HEADLINE>
By LYOMA TURPALOV
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARGUN, Russia (AP) -- Federal troops cordoned off Chechen cities
Monday and began a widespread security sweep, hunting for rebels a
day after four towns were hit by suicide truck bombings that killed
at least 54 people.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's attacks marked the biggest setback for Russian forces
in Chechnya in months.
</P>
<P>
   In one town Monday, emergency workers tugged bodies from a
military dormitory sheared apart by a blast. Meanwhile, police
swept Russian-held cities for rebels. Security agents detained 18
people on suspicion of involvement in the rapid succession of five
bombings, Deputy Interior Minister Ivan Golubev said on Russian
television.
</P>
<P>
   In the attacks, trucks loaded with explosives barreled up to
Russian buildings in four Chechen towns -- Argun, Urus-Martan,
Novogroznensky and Gudermes, Chechnya's second-largest city and
home to the pro-Moscow Chechen government. Russian troops opened
fire on the trucks and caused the explosions in all but one of the
incidents, said the Kremlin's spokesman on Chechnya, Sergei
Yastrzhembsky.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said at least 37 Russian servicemen, 11 civilians and
six rebels were killed. In addition, four Russian servicemen were
missing, the Emergency Situations Ministry reported. More than 100
people were wounded.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was a planned action to carry out terrorist acts in five
towns,'' Chechen rebel commander Ramzan Akhmadov said by telephone
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   It was the rebels' most organized, deadly attack in months, and
it came after weeks of Russian claims that organized resistance had
ended in the breakaway republic. The rebels have unleashed a string
of scattered ambushes that Chechen commanders say are in reply to
those Russian claims of victory.
</P>
<P>
   Russian troops were driven out of Chechnya in a 1994-96 war.
They returned late last summer after Chechnya-based Islamic
militants raided several villages in the neighboring Russian region
of Dagestan, and after about 300 people died in apartment bombings
the government blames on Chechens.
</P>
<P>
   In a videotaped message cited by the Interfax news agency
Monday, Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov said that the rebels'
latest tactics ''leave the Russian troops no chance of establishing
control in Chechnya.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Russian troops barred all nonmilitary traffic in the
capital, Grozny, and the four towns. Military officials sent
reinforcement troops, citing reports of more expected attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ''What happened demands that we should become more vigilant and
use measures that will prevent bandits from fulfilling their
vicious designs,'' said the first deputy of the army's general
staff, Col. Gen. Valery Manilov.
</P>
<P>
   The deadliest bombing targeted an Interior Ministry dormitory on
the outskirts of Argun, nine miles east of Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   The bomb left a deep crater in the asphalt. On one end of the
building, the servicemen's metal bunk beds were still lined up --
but the outside wall was sliced off.
</P>
<P>
   Vasara Vesitaya, a worker in the dormitory cafeteria, left for
home three minutes before the blast.
</P>
<P>
   ''I left the fence and suddenly saw a huge truck coming at high
speed. It crashed through the barrier and then something horrible
began. The glass from windows in surrounding houses shattered, the
earth shook,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Emergency Situations Ministry said 26 servicemen and three
civilians were killed in Argun and four were missing.
</P>
<P>
   The other servicemen and civilians were killed in two truck
bombings and an ensuing shootout in Gudermes, one truck blast in
Urus-Martan, south of Grozny, and one truck blast in
Novogroznensky, in eastern Chechnya. All are in territory the
Russians ostensibly control.
</P>
<P>
   One of the Gudermes blasts killed civilians working in their
backyard garden nearby.
</P>
<P>
   ''Innocent people perish in these terrorist acts,'' Mayerbek
Askhadov said at the funeral for his cousin, a slain Chechen
policeman.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials say some rebels have hidden among civilians
and are using weapons caches hidden in Russian-held territory.
</P>
<P>
   But others blamed a lack of discipline among Russian troops,
including heavy drinking and bribe-taking. Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev, speaking to journalists in Moscow, urged ''improving
discipline and diligence in the federal forces.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Gains 112; Nasdaq Climbs 25  </HEADLINE>
By EILEEN GLANTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue-chip stocks sprinted higher Monday in a
quiet, shortened session ahead of the Independence Day holiday. A
report of moderating economic growth helped inflation-sensitive
stocks advance.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 112.78 points to close at
10,560.67.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher, although they failed
to match the Dow's momentum. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up
14.72 at 1,469.32, and the Nasdaq composite index was up 25.82 at
3,991.93.
</P>
<P>
   Trading was extremely light. The stock market closed at 1 p.m.;
many Wall Street professionals had taken the day off, opting for a
four-day weekend. Composite volume on the New York Stock Exchange
came to 656.23 million shares, well below average.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a few catalysts drove trading. The National Association
of Purchasing Management reported a slowdown in manufacturing
activity growth, raising hopes that six interest-rate increases by
the Federal Reserve in the past year are slowing the economy to a
more sustainable pace.
</P>
<P>
   The purchasing managers' business index for June came in at
51.8, compared with 53.2 in May. While any reading above 50 is
considered a sign of economic growth, the index was lower than
analysts had anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the report's ''prices paid'' index fell from 65.8
in May to 61.2 in June. That component is considered an important
gauge of inflationary pressures.
</P>
<P>
   ''The market is telling a pretty good story,'' said Alan
Ackerman, senior vice president at Fahnestock &AMP; Co. in New York.
''This was a favorable piece of news that I think will allow some
interest-rate jitters to fade away.''
</P>
<P>
   Rate-sensitive stocks rose. J.P. Morgan gained $5.625 to $115.75
and First Union rose $1.188 to $26.188.
</P>
<P>
   Economists said the purchasing managers' report makes it less
likely that the Fed will raise interest rates at its next meeting
Aug. 22. With interest-rate worries fading, investors should be
able to concentrate on corporate earnings for the recently ended
second quarter, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We should start seeing a flow of positive earnings reports,
and that could help the market break out of the range-bound
condition it's been in,'' Ackerman said.
</P>
<P>
   Verizon, the company formed by the completion of the $59 billion
merger of Bell Atlantic Corp. and GTE Corp., rose $4.625 to $55. It
was the first day of trading for the newly combined company.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle fell $3.875 to $80.188. Late Friday, the company
announced that chief operating offer and president Ray Lane will
leave his post.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 2-to-1 margin on the
NYSE, and by a slender margin in Nasdaq trading.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 6.81 to 524.04.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas indexes were mostly higher, including Mexico's key IPC
index. Investors were celebrating the presidential victory of
opposition candidate Vicente Fox, whose victory ends the
Institutional Revolutionary Party's 71-year grip on the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the election wasn't a significant factor in U.S.
stock trading, but may stimulate interest in Mexican stocks in the
coming sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 1.2 percent.
Germany's Xetra DAX index rose 0.9 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100
rose 2.5 percent, and France's CAC-40 rose 1.0 percent.

<HEADLINE> Giuliani criticizes Con Ed rate hike  </HEADLINE>
By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - After recent power failures and news of a
possible 30 percent hike in electric bills this summer, Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani escalated his war against Con Edison on Monday,
slamming the utility as ''incompetent.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the wrong time to be discussing a rate hike with a
company that does not appear to be serving the public the way the
public wants to be served,'' Giuliani said at a City Hall Park news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're already paying a lot of money for power, for
electricity, and to say all of a sudden, 'We want 30 percent more,'
when we've already had a blackout in Washington Heights last year
(and) an almost blackout or brownout on the Upper East Side of
Manhattan'' is unacceptable, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The threatened rate hike, Giuliani added, is ''outrageous. The
timing of it is as about as crazy as it could possibly be.'' The
mayor said the utility's performance has been ''incompetent.''
</P>
<P>
   Con Edison responded with a statement, saying that electricity
rates would indeed be higher this summer due to tight oil supply,
the city's booming economy, higher fuel costs and an increase in
customer demand. Con Ed officials declined to discuss figures or
say whether the report of a 30 percent increase was accurate.
</P>
<P>
   ''We deliver power as cheaply as we can,'' read the statement.
''We are all adjusting to new realities and taking steps to meet
the new challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the utility warned that due to high oil prices and
high demand it may not be able to supply sufficient power to
prevent brownouts and blackouts this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Con Edison has been under fire since July, 1999, when a blackout
paralyzed Washington Heights for 19 hours during a heat wave and
officials gave conflicting accounts about its cause.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a brownout reduced power to several buildings on the
Upper East Side of Manhattan during 90-degree heat and 95 percent
humidity.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, the utility blamed faulty feeder cables. The city
has a lawsuit pending against Con Edison regarding the Washington
Heights blackout; the city said last week that a proposed
settlement had unraveled, but Giuliani said Monday that the talks
were continuing.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor said that for now, Con Edison should hold off on rate
increases.
</P>
<P>
   ''The first thing I would ask them to do is withhold any
decision on any kind of rate hike because obviously it would never
be well received, but it's going to be particularly poorly received
right now,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Chechen Bombs Are Setback for Russia  </HEADLINE>
By JIM HEINTZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- The truck bomb blasts that roared through Chechnya
destroyed more than lives and buildings: They wiped out any
pretense Russia still had of dominating the rebels in the breakway
republic, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   The five blasts Sunday, which killed at least 54 people, came
after weeks of Russian claims that organized Chechen rebel
resistance had been crushed.
</P>
<P>
   Russian troops who invaded Chechnya last year tore through the
region in a matter of months, taking the capital, Grozny, and much
of the rest of the republic. Russian officials had said the
remaining rebels were scattered into groupings of about a dozen men
each, and Russian commanders took to proclaiming that the war was
effectively over.
</P>
<P>
   But amid those claims, rebels have been mounting small
hit-and-run attacks in Russian-held areas of Chechnya. And then
came an attack on a wholly different scale: Sunday evening's
suicide bombings in four towns around the republic.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are hearing every day that there's no war, but it's a
lie,'' said Alexei Malashenko, a Chechnya analyst at the Carnegie
Endowment for Peace office in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   In the nearly simultaneous attacks, trucks loaded with
explosives barreled up to Russian buildings in the Chechen towns of
Argun, Gudermes, Urus-Martan, Novogroznensky.
</P>
<P>
   In Argun, at least 26 Russian servicemen were killed and 81 were
wounded when a truck exploded outside a dormitory housing Russian
troops, the Emergency Situations Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, at least 37 of the victims around the republic were
Russian servicemen, said the Kremlin's spokesman on Chechnya,
Sergei Yastrzhembsky. Eleven civilians were killed, and four
Russian servicemen were missing, the Emergency Situations Ministry
reported. Six rebels, including the truck drivers, were believed
dead. More than 100 people were wounded.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was a planned action to carry out terrorist acts in five
towns,'' Chechen rebel commander Ramzan Akhmadov said by telephone
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In all but one of the incidents, Russian troops opened fire on
the bomb-laden trucks and caused the explosions, Yastrzhembsky
said.
</P>
<P>
   It was the most deadly day in months for the Russian forces
trying to re-establish control over Chechnya, the Caucasus republic
which had been effectively free of Russian control since a 1994-96
war.
</P>
<P>
   Russian troops returned to Chechnya late last summer, looking to
stamp out resistance after Chechen-based rebels invaded the
neighboring region of Dagestan. But in recent weeks, the agile
rebels have unleashed a string of scattered ambushes and bomb
attacks that Chechen commanders say are in reply to those Russian
claims of victory.
</P>
<P>
   ''It shows the Chechen resistance is alive and kicking,'' said
Pavel Felgenhauer, an independent military analyst.
</P>
<P>
   Russian military officials say the Chechen rebels now number
about 1,500. Despite the small number, the rebels have enough
strength to mount many more devastating attacks. The Russian forces
appear unable to prevent the attacks despite having laced the
republic with roadblocks and clamped down on non-military travel.
</P>
<P>
   ''Not only are the (Russian troops) unprofessional, but they're
also corrupt,'' Felgenhauer said. ''A bribe can get you freedom and
that means the real culprits are likely never to be jailed.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe, in the end, that withdrawal is inevitable,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Others disagreed, saying that despite the weekend destruction,
Russia appears to be in a somewhat stronger position than during
the 1994-96 war, which ended with Russia's humiliating withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   Rebel resistance, although active, is not as intense as in the
previous war and the insurgents are divided under several leaders.
Nor have the rebels mounted bloody incursions into other parts of
Russia, as they did in the last war.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Russian President Vladimir Putin has made no calls
for negotiations or unilateral cease-fires, unlike Boris Yeltsin in
the 1994-96 war. Putin has said a political solution is possible
only when the rebels are destroyed, and backing off such an adamant
promise would be politically costly.
</P>
<P>
   ''I cannot foresee a huge reevaluation'' of Russian strategy in
Chechnya, Malashenko said. ''It will not last forever, but for
weeks, for months, for years perhaps.''

<HEADLINE> Carper wins on education reform, loses on gun control in last year  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTOPHER THORNE
<TEXT>
<P>
   DOVER, Del. (AP) - Gov. Tom Carper got his way this year with a
controversial law that holds teachers responsible for how well they
teach in the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the two-term Democrat saw many of his legislative goals
adopted by a General Assembly that wrapped up most of its business
early Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers adopted his proposal to allow digital signatures on
electronic legal and business transactions. Legislators also OK'd
most of his $2.18 billion operating budget, which includes millions
of dollars for open space and farmland preservation.
</P>
<P>
   But Carper failed in the last of his eight years as Delaware's
governor to persuade the General Assembly to adopt gun control
legislation to close what he describes as a loophole that could
allow felons to buy handguns. It was a top goal in his final year
as chief executive of this tiny mid-Atlantic state.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate must return in a special session to approve the $543
million capital improvements budget, because it broke up without
considering the bill. This is the second year in a row the Senate
has had to return in a summertime special session to approve the
capital budget.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you look back at the beginning of the 140th General
Assembly, there's a great deal of good that has been done,'' Carper
told reporters in a teleconference Monday. ''Without question the
biggest accomplishment this session, in this General Assembly, has
been our work on the education front.''
</P>
<P>
   The teacher bill didn't come easy. The legislation was left over
from last year when it failed to pass through the General Assembly.
Then the lawmakers embarrassed Carper in October when he called an
ineffective special session, only to see the Senate adjourn before
getting the bill from the House.
</P>
<P>
   This session Carper forged a compromise with legislative leaders
that saw the bill win final approval.
</P>
<P>
   A deal was out of his reach, however, for a law that would have
required background checks in private purchases of firearms,
whether the sale takes place at flea markets and gun shows or in
someone's home.
</P>
<P>
   Licensed firearms dealers currently run instant background
checks to prevent felons from buying guns. But Delaware has no law
requiring similar checks for sales between private individuals.

   Sen. Harris McDowell, a North Wilmington Democrat, introduced a
bill that would have required background checks before a gun could
be sold privately. But McDowell withdrew the legislation after
testy debate on the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a loophole that we've sought to plug in this past
legislative session that's already been plugged in New Jersey,
Pennsylvania and Maryland,'' Carper said. ''We simply thought it
should be plugged here. I think eventually it will be.''
</P>
<P>
   Two other bills which would have mandated trigger locks on
handguns never got out of Senate committee.
</P>
<P>
   John Thompson, president of the Delaware State Sportsmen's
Association, an affiliate of the National Rifle Association,
described McDowell's bill as an ''attack'' on law-abiding
gun-owners.
</P>
<P>
   He said Carper's gun-control efforts were a public relations
ploy intended to help him to higher political office.
</P>
<P>
   Carper intends to file papers July 17 to challenge Republican
U.S. Sen. William V. Roth Jr. for his seat, but insisted he
believes the private sales loophole is worth pursuing on its
merits.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's a loophole that has been plugged in all the state's
around us,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Coast Guard says harbor is filling up with ships and boats  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD PYLE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - This city's broad, picturesque harbor teemed on
Monday with thousands of vessels, from oceangoing schooners to
destroyers to small recreational craft, in the run-up to the Fourth
of July's nautical spectacular.
</P>
<P>
   As lesser-sized sailing ships came down the East River to join
in Operation Sail 2000, the centerpiece of the event, about two
dozen warships from 13 countries steamed up the Hudson from the
Narrows. The warships anchored in an 11-mile line as participants
in history's sixth International Naval Review.
</P>
<P>
   The main event will be the ''parade of sail,'' about 30 large
wind-powered ships from 19 countries which enter the harbor on
Tuesday and pass up the Hudson before dispersing to assigned
berths. Most, like the Coast Guard's square-rigger Eagle, are
government-owned training vessels for sailors.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton will review the naval ships, then go aboard
the aircraft carrier USS John F. Kennedy, anchored in mid-harbor,
to watch the sail procession.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, a haze enveloped the harbor, cutting spectators'
visibility but not their enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   ''I love it. They're beautiful,'' said Pauline Allen, spending
her lunch hour at the Battery promenade at Manhattan's southern
tip, watching the tall ships and navy vessels. ''I'm waiting for
that warship to come in,'' she said, pointing to a hulking vessel
barely visible in the haze. ''I want to see what's on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Coast Guard Warrant Officer Lionel Bryant estimated some 5,000
craft of all kinds were in the waters between the Verazzano Narrows
bridge and the Battery.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's unbelievable. I've never seen so many boats at once,''
said Bryant. One group of about 100 sailboats, ''probably from the
same yacht club,'' arrived in a group down the East River.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant said the Coast Guard was holding to its prediction of as
many as 70,000 craft of all kinds for the joint holiday
celebration, capped by what organizers say will be the biggest
fireworks orgy ever.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of the Navy Richard Danzig, who toured the Naval
Review command post on a Hudson River pier, called OpSail 2000 ''a
wonderful opportunity for the city of New York and the Navy to
combine together to display the nature of sea power.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It captures a sense of what extraordinary history this has
through the old ships, the tall ships,'' Danzig said in an
interview. ''At the same time it emphasizes the extraordinary
present-day relevance of naval power. Seventy percent of the globe
is water, and we're able to operate from the sea everywhere. The
Navy really is everywhere for America.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the arrivals on Monday was the 129-foot schooner Amistad,
a replica of the ship made famous when its slave cargo of 53
Africans revolted in 1839. Launched March 25 in Mystic, Conn., it
will be homeported in New Haven, where it will be a floating
history lesson for schoolchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Its captain, William Pinkney, was the first black man to sail
around the world via the southern ocean. ''That's the ne plus ultra
of solo sailing,'' said Pinkney, 64. ''Limited to those who are not
wrapped too tight.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's very exciting,'' said Selma Feldman, peering at
the ships through binoculars at the Battery promenade. ''The Statue
of Liberty looks so impressive, doesn't it?''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Probes Consultant for Bribery  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department is investigating
whether a financial consultant bribed Kazakstan officials with
money belonging to major oil companies who wanted to work in the
oil-rich nation, a federal law enforcement official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The activities of James H. Giffen, chairman of the New
York-based consulting firm Mercator Corp., are being investigated
by the department's Organized Crime and Racketeering Section, this
official said.
</P>
<P>
   The department sent a letter to Swiss officials last month
seeking their cooperation because some of the money may have moved
through Swiss bank accounts, said this official, who requested
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act makes it a crime to bribe
foreign officials for favorable treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street Journal obtained a copy of the department's
18-page June 12 letter to Swiss authorities and quoted an
unidentified law enforcement official as saying the oil companies,
including units of the former Amoco Corp., the former Mobil Oil
Corp. and Phillips Petroleum Co., are not themselves the focus of
the investigation at this point.
</P>
<P>
   Giffen, 59, has been a financial consultant to Kazakstan's
president for most of a decade in negotiations with oil companies
that want to do business in the former Soviet republic.
</P>
<P>
   The letter said the Department ''is investigating James H.
Giffen, a U.S. citizen, and others for violations of U.S. law
involving the alleged use of U.S. banks to funnel funds belonging
to certain oil companies through Swiss bank accounts and shell
companies in Switzerland and the British Virgin Islands for
ultimate transfer to present and former high-ranking officials of
Kazakstan,'' the Journal reported.
</P>
<P>
   The letter said the money belonged to Amoco Kazakstan Petroleum
Co., Amoco Kazakstan (CPC) Inc., Mobil Oil Corp. and Philips
Petroleum Kazakstan Ltd., the paper reported.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are looking into possible violations of the
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, as well as statutes on Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations, money laundering, stolen
property and extortion, the paper quoted the letter as saying.
</P>
<P>
   The Journal reported the letter also said:
</P>
<P>
   --Investigators have information that shows payments of at least
$115 million were made from the U.S. bank accounts of several
international oil companies to a numbered account, held at Bankers
Trust in New York, belonging to an unidentified Swiss bank. Justice
investigators want information about that numbered account, from
which they believe disbursements were made to Giffen.
</P>
<P>
   --The Justice Department wants Switzerland to freeze Giffen's
assets.
</P>
<P>
   --Giffen is alleged to have passed nearly $60 million from the
numbered account to bank accounts controlled by the Kazak
president, Nursultan Nazarbayev, 60; a former Kazak prime minister,
Akezhan Kazhegeldin, 48; and Nurlan Balgimbayev, 52, another former
prime minister and current head of the Kazak state oil company.
Members of their families also were alleged to be beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   An attorney for Kazhegeldin told the Journal his client received
a $6 million payment in 1997 and tried unsuccessfully to return it.
</P>
<P>
   Giffen's lawyer, Mark MacDougall, told the Journal: ''Mercator
has had a long-standing official relationship with the Republic of
Kazakstan and its emerging oil industry. ... When all of the facts
associated with this matter are clearly understood, we are
confident that Mercator will be shown to have acted lawfully.''

<HEADLINE> Latinos Lament Dearth of TV Roles  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL SHEPARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Latino advocates say they are happy that black
men seem to be getting juicier roles in the upcoming fall network
television season, but they want to know how they, American Indians
and Asian-Americans can get in on the action.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't want the slice of pie African-American men are
getting in Hollywood. We want the entire pie to be much, much
bigger,'' said Alex Nogales of the National Hispanic Media
Coalition that met Monday at the annual convention of the National
Council of La Raza.
</P>
<P>
   The Hispanic coalition was formed last year after minority
advocates criticized the networks for a lack of racial and ethnic
diversity in the fall TV schedule. No minority group members had
featured roles in any new programming slated that season for ABC,
CBS, NBC or FOX.
</P>
<P>
   The group joined forces with the NAACP, the Asian Pacific
American Media Coalition and the American Indians in Film and
Television and negotiated agreements with the major networks to
increase minority participation both on and off screen.
</P>
<P>
   But now it's hard for the Hispanics to tell if they have gained
ground.
</P>
<P>
   While black actors Andre Braugher, David Alan Grier and Mykelti
Williamson have won lead roles in the upcoming season -- giving rise
to hopes that the situation is improving -- no Latinos,
Asian-Americans or American Indians have gotten significant roles
on new shows.
</P>
<P>
   Braugher is slated to star on ABC's ''Gideon's Crossing,'' Grier
on NBC's ''Dag'' and Williamson on CBS' ''The Fugitive.''
</P>
<P>
   CBS has also renewed the hospital drama ''City of Angels,''
which has several black cast members as does a new CBS offering,
''The Street.''
</P>
<P>
   The Latino advocates are especially perturbed by CBS for not
scheduling ''American Family,'' a drama about a middle-class
Hispanic family.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, CBS President Leslie Moonves said ''American
Family'' didn't fit in CBS' schedule. He said he took the unusual
step of letting the show's producers pitch the CBS-developed series
to other networks. No one bought it.
</P>
<P>
   Pressure from the Hispanic coalition led CBS to shop ''American
Family'' to other outlets, said coalition president Esteban Torres,
a former congressman from California.
</P>
<P>
   A ray of light for Latinos comes from cable channel Showtime's
decision to air a Latino-oriented show, ''Resurrection Boulevard.''
</P>
<P>
   One of its actors, Maurico Mendoza, said creation of that show
alone has given work to more than 60 Latino actors and benefited
other minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ''We make sure everyone -- American Indians and Asians and blacks
-- are included in all aspects of the show,'' Mendoza said. ''We
don't want anyone left out.''
</P>
<P>
   Telephone calls to NBC, CBS, ABC, and FOX seeking reaction were
not immediately returned.

<HEADLINE> Israel Draft Bill Passes First Vote  </HEADLINE>
By MARK LAVIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- A bill that allows ultra-Orthodox men to skip
or shorten military service, enshrining into law a situation that
has long rankled secular Israelis, cleared its first hurdle in
parliament on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Ehud Barak, who once advocated drafting all young
Israelis into the army, had to explain why he changed his mind,
without stating the real reason -- coalition politics.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed law would allow ultra-Orthodox men to decide for
themselves, at age 23, whether to continue full-time Torah study or
report for shortened army service.
</P>
<P>
   The vote Monday, which was a first reading of the bill, passed
52 to 43, with seven abstentions. Barak pledged to consider
tightening the exemptions before the bill comes before the house
for its final readings.
</P>
<P>
   The debate showed the deep divisions in Israeli society as
special interest groups strive to protect their fiefdoms at the
expense of others.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of drafting ultra-Orthodox men is the most emotional
symbol of the chasms between segments of society. Secular and
modern Orthodox Israelis object to facing the dangers of army
service and inconvenience of reserve duty while others are exempt.
</P>
<P>
   Sensitive to a growing revulsion to the bill among the secular
public, Barak reached out to the bill's most strident opponents,
the soldier activist ''Awakening'' group, and asked them to suggest
modifications.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli men are conscripted for three years and women serve 21
months. When the deferments were first granted with the creation of
the state in 1948, they applied to about 400 Torah scholars. Today
about 30,000 have draft exemptions.
</P>
<P>
   Ultra-Orthodox make up about 7 percent of the population. They
believe Torah study, not the army, protects the existence of the
Jewish people. Addressing the parliament, Moshe Gafni of the
ultra-Orthodox United Torah Judaism party declared that ''people
who do not study Torah should serve in the army.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the Knesset, or parliament, hunger-striking veterans of
army service, including some wounded in battle, expressed their
disgust with what they considered another sellout to the
ultra-Orthodox politicians who hold the political balance of power.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're doing what you do every day, extortion and evasion of
responsibility,'' thundered Yosef ''Tommy'' Lapid of the
anti-religious Shinui party, shaking his fist at the podium in the
direction of members of the ultra-Orthodox Shas party, the main
backers of the exemption bill.
</P>
<P>
   Ten days ago, Shas nearly brought Barak's government down over
funding for religious schools.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's debate followed another threat from Shas, Barak's
largest partner with 17 seats in the 120-member parliament. If the
draft exemption bill was not brought to a vote, said Shas, the
party would again consider bringing down the government.
</P>
<P>
   Barak had to impose party discipline to force his members to
vote for the bill. One of them, Avi Yehezkel, charging that the law
leaves military service to a ''majority of suckers,'' said he would
be in the parliamentary bathroom when the vote was taken.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Congratulates Vicente Fox  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a congratulatory telephone call, President
Clinton told Mexican President-elect Vicente Fox the United States
stands ready to enhance the close bilateral cooperation that he
said already exists between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mexico is our neighbor and friend,'' Clinton said in a
statement. ''Mexico's national elections, the freest and fairest in
the nation's history, stand as vivid testimony to the depth of the
democratic commitment of the Mexican people.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he also spoke Monday with President Ernesto Zedillo
to praise his ''extraordinary contributions'' to Mexico,
particularly what he has done to deepen democracy.
</P>
<P>
   He said Mexicans should be proud of advances they have made in
the last six years to ''strengthen and consolidate democratic
institutions and set Mexico on a course of economic growth and
prosperity.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's election process appeared to have been free and fair, a
welcome development for the Clinton administration, given the
priority it attaches to democratic stability in the hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   Officials have anguished over flawed elections in Peru and Haiti
in recent weeks, and there also has been disquiet in Washington
about possible weakening of democracy in Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   One of the few problems voiced about Sunday's historic Mexican
election related to Fox's ability to induce cooperation from a
bureaucracy accustomed to taking orders from a political party in
power for 71 years.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has adopted a wait-and-see attitude toward
some of his promises, including a package of economic changes that
he says will double foreign investment in Mexico and ensure that
jobless Mexicans do not have to flee to the United States to make a
living.
</P>
<P>
   Fox has criticized the Zedillo administration's counternarcotics
record, saying large budgetary outlays have yielded scant results.
</P>
<P>
   Barry McCaffrey, director of the White House drug control
office, said Fox came across as ''enormously determined'' on the
drug issue when McCaffrey and other officials met with him a few
months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''The guy is extremely smart, dedicated and bold,'' McCaffrey
said in a telephone interview. ''He's determined not to turn Mexico
over to the narcotraffickers.''
</P>
<P>
   One Fox proposal that could cause friction recommends opening
U.S.-Mexican frontier so that Mexicans and Americans can go back
and forth without restriction.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the idea Monday, a senior U.S. official said he had
seen no formal proposal about it.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal was criticized by David Ray, a spokesman for the
Federation for American Immigration Reform.
</P>
<P>
   ''The immigration issue cannot continue to be ignored by
American politicians when Mexico's newly elected president is
clamoring for even more visas or for the opening of an immigration
safety valve to the U.S.,'' Ray said.

<HEADLINE> BC-NY--OpSail-Order of Sail, 1st Ld-Writethru,1700  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - Following is the expected order of parade as the
tall ships sail under the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge into New York
harbor starting at about 9:45 a.m. Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest 26 vessels, led by the Eagle, are to sail in single
column at a distance of 600 yards apart, each with a smaller ship
as a starboard escort. About 100 remaining tall ships will wind up
the marine parade.
</P>
<P>
   1. The Eagle, a U.S. Coast Guard barque.
</P>
<P>
   With the golden eagle as its figurehead, this is America's most
famous tall ship and Operation Sail's host vessel. Built in 1936 in
Germany, the 295-foot schooner was seized from the Nazis in World
War II and made a Coast Guard cadet training in 1946.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanied by: the Zenobe Gramme of Belgium, a 92-foot naval
training ship. Built in 1961, it's named for the Belgian inventor
who perfected the technology of alternating current for motors and
generators.
</P>
<P>
   2. The Danmark, Denmark.
</P>
<P>
   The three-masted, 252-foot tall ship visited the New York
World's Fair in 1939 and was in the United States when Germany
invaded Denmark. Its captain offered his country's services to
President Roosevelt, and the Coast Guard used the ship for
training.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanied by: the Asgard II, of Ireland, a 106-foot brigantine
whose name comes from Norse mythology and means Home of the Gods.
</P>
<P>
   3. The Pogoria, Poland.
</P>
<P>
   A 154-foot barkantine that carries a broad blue stripe the
length of its sides, the Pogoria has foresails adorned with the
symbol of Poland's Iron Shackle Fraternity. Built in 1980, it has
sailed the world with a crew of 50.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanied by: the Amistad, of the United States, a 129-foot
replica of the ''freedom schooner'' that was the scene of an 1839
insurrection by African men who were kidnapped in Sierra Leone to
be sold into slavery.
</P>
<P>
   4. The Niagara, the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Built in Pennsylvania in the War of 1812 to oppose the British
in the Great Lakes, it was restored over many years. The 198-foot
ship was relaunched at Erie in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanied by: the Californian, of the United States, the
145-foot official tall ship of the state of California that is a
recreation of the 19th century cutter C.W. Lawrence.
</P>
<P>
   5. The Guayas, Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
   Built in Spain, the 258-foot bark sailed all the way around
South America on its maiden voyage in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanied by: the Soren Larsen, of New Zealand, a 140-foot,
19th century-style brigantine used in a number of films, including
''The French Lieutenant's Woman.''
</P>
<P>
   6. The Rose, the United States.
</P>
<P>
   A replica of a British frigate Rose that was part of the fleet
that attacked New York in 1776. The new, 179-foot Rose, built in
1970, is the world's largest active wooden tall ship and serves as
a training ship.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanied by: the Jens Krogh, of Denmark, a 61-foot ketch
built in 1899 and now owned by a maritime scouts organization.
</P>
<P>
   7. The Sagres, Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   With large red crosses on the sails, the 292-foot bark is a
training ship that has taken part in every Operation Sail. Built in
1937 for the Germany navy, it was taken by the United States and
passed on to Brazil before Portugal acquired it in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanied by: the Fair Jeanne, of Canada, a 120-foot
brigantine that serves as a floating classroom and sail training
vessel.

<HEADLINE> State suspends license of Buffalo-area doctor  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) - An obstetrician-gynecologist has been
temporarily barred from practicing medicine for allegedly
mistreating nine patients, including two who died, state health
officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Monica Applewhite, who maintains offices in Williamsville and
Lockport, faces 23 charges of misconduct, including gross
negligence, gross incompetence, moral unfitness to practice
medicine, and fraud.
</P>
<P>
   The charges relate to eight pregnant patients and one who sought
a tubal ligation, a procedure that prevents pregnancy, Department
of Health documents show.
</P>
<P>
   Applewhite is accused of improperly performing the tubal
ligation, elective surgery, when the patient had an infection. She
died June 3.
</P>
<P>
   A second patient died Feb. 5 of pregnancy-related complications.
In that case, Applewhite is accused of failing to order adequate
tests and to follow up on the patient's worsening condition before
and after delivery, state officials said. The doctor then allegedly
altered her notes.
</P>
<P>
   Applewhite, who was licensed to practice medicine in New York in
October 1986, could not be reached for comment Monday. Her
answering service said the office was closed until Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   A hearing was scheduled for July 10.

<HEADLINE> Caribbean Leaders Face Sanctions  </HEADLINE>
By EILEEN McNAMARA
<TEXT>
<P>
   CANOUAN, St. Vincent (AP) -- Caribbean leaders on Monday debated
a united response to possible sanctions by industrialized nations
after a report recently listed several of the islands as havens for
money laundering and tax evasion.
</P>
<P>
   The report by the Paris-based Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development named five Caribbean countries as
centers for international money-laundering by criminal groups. It
cited several more for lax banking rules that allowed wealthy
individuals and companies to hide funds from tax collectors in
developed nations.
</P>
<P>
   Developed countries have threatened sanctions unless financial
controls are tightened -- endangering offshore banking industries
that have brought a measure of wealth to these resource-poor
countries.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are out to defend their interests,'' Dominica's Prime
Minister Rosie Douglas said Monday, echoing criticism that the rich
countries' high-minded stance amounts to little more than a
disguised effort to recoup lost tax revenue. ''We will not give up
our sovereign rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he conceded that the 15-member Caribbean Community, whose
leaders began four days of talks here Monday, must take the charges
seriously. ''We'll have to review our tax legislation and how it
affects Europe and the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Some corrective measures are needed in Dominica,'' he said.
''We know in a couple of cases there was money laundering, and we
can't have that.''
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations estimates that $600 billion in criminal funds
is hidden from law enforcement officials every year by such money
laundering methods as moving it through offshore accounts, and
about $60 billion of that passes through Caribbean banking centers.
</P>
<P>
   There are no firm figures of U.S. tax revenue lost to offshore
tax havens, but Britain estimates its losses at about $1.6 billion
a year.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has indicated it will look at the OECD lists,
as well as its own studies, when deciding whether to punish
countries under new legislation being considered in Congress.
France also is considering similar legislation.
</P>
<P>
   At opening ceremonies for the summit on Sunday, Premier Sir
James Mitchell of the host nation St. Vincent condemned the
measures under consideration as a ''direct threat to the region's
economic base and stability.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell said that while the region will cooperate to stop money
laundering, developing countries should be allowed to offer tax
concessions as a way to draw desperately needed business and
investment.
</P>

   ''We in the Caribbean do not aspire to be a refuge for drug
barons and money launderers,'' said Mitchell, who is current
chairman of Caribbean Community. ''We are not doing anything
illegal or immoral. Tax competition is about whose treasury gets
the money.''
</P>
<P>
   Five of 15 alleged money laundering centers were identified in
the Caribbean, and 15 of 35 countries listed as harmful tax havens
are Caribbean nations or territories of Britain, the Netherlands
and the United States. The OECD gave them 12 months to work with
the organization to eliminate ''harmful features'' of their tax
regimes, or face sanctions.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia, Eritrea Talking in U.S.  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Delegations from Ethiopia and Eritrea opened
indirect talks Monday at the State Department on issues remaining
after they agreed to stop fighting last month, department spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
   As the talks began, with U.S. officials shuttling back and forth
between the two delegations in separate rooms, U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan dispatched a team to Ethiopia and
Eritrea to lay groundwork for a possible U.N. peacekeeping mission
along the bitterly disputed border.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides were discussing in Washington demarcation of the
disputed 620-mile border, compensation for deportees and the
origins of their two-year war. Eritrea was part of Ethiopia until
it gained independence in 1993, with a poorly defined border.
</P>
<P>
   The two-year war between the Horn of Africa neighbors claimed
tens of thousands of lives. The cessation of hostilities was agreed
June 18 in Algiers through mediation by the Organization of African
Unity.
</P>
<P>
   At the United Nations, Annan said in a report to the Security
Council that he was sending a mission Monday to speed up
implementation of the cease-fire agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The team is headed by Maj. Gen. Timothy Ford of Australia, a
former chief of staff in U.N. peacekeeping operations in the Middle
East. It includes military and humanitarian experts.
</P>
<P>
   Annan also is sending liaison officers to Addis Ababa and
Asmara, the capitals of Ethiopia and Eritrea, to help plan the
peacekeeping operation. Pending approval by the Security Council
and both countries, the officers would be followed by military
observer groups in each capital.
</P>
<P>
   The council was expected to discuss the Horn of Africa situation
this week.
</P>
<P>
   The June 18 cease-fire would deploy international peacekeepers
during negotiations to delineate the border.
</P>
<P>
   Some diplomats have suggested a force of about 2,000 troops, but
others have said nearly double that many may be needed.
</P>
<P>
   Ethiopia insists it will not withdraw troops from Eritrean
territory until U.N. peacekeepers are deployed in a buffer zone
along the border.
</P>
<P>
   Annan urged governments for generous responses to the U.N.
humanitarian appeal for the Horn of Africa, which has been hit by a
severe drought.

<HEADLINE> Group Seeks Apology From Gumbel  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- An unexpected camera shift -- and some amateur
lipreading -- caught Bryant Gumbel in what appeared to be a profane
comment about a guest on CBS's ''The Early Show.''
</P>
<P>
   Gumbel had finished a tense interview last Thursday with Robert
Knight, a spokesman for the Family Research Council who supported
the Supreme Court decision allowing the Boy Scouts of America to
exclude gays as leaders.
</P>
<P>
   After he ended the interview and introduced a weather report,
the camera inexplicably switched to Gumbel getting up from his
chair. Gumbel was heard to say ''What a ...'' and his microphone
abruptly switched off.
</P>
<P>
   Knight believes Gumbel completed the sentence with a profanity
and the word ''idiot.'' The words can't be heard, but a videotape
appears to support their contention.
</P>
<P>
   It led the conservative American Family Association to issue a
statement calling for Gumbel's ouster. Knight said he didn't think
that was necessary, but he'd appreciate an apology.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was caught off balance,'' Knight said. ''He didn't know he
was on television.''
</P>
<P>
   Gumbel left after Thursday's show for a vacation, spokeswoman
Sandra Genelius said. She said she didn't know what Gumbel uttered.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was making a casual remark of some sort, but it is unclear
what the comment was and, in any case, it bears no relevance to the
content of 'The Early Show,''' said a statement from CBS News.

<HEADLINE> Governor signs into law tougher penalties for designer drug Ecstasy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Gov. Christie Whitman signed into law
Monday tougher criminal penalties for possessing and selling the
designer drug Ecstasy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today, on the eve of Independence Day, we continue our fight
against dependency - drug dependency - by taking up arms against
Ecstasy,'' Whitman said. ''Because the use of Ecstasy is growing -
but is not yet as common as other drugs - we are doing something
now. The legislation that becomes law today gives our law
enforcement officers a new weapon to prevent an explosion in the
use of this drug.''
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officers claim the drug now popular among teens
and young adults at so-called rave parties can cause sudden
illness, including artificially high temperatures that can kill.
</P>
<P>
   The drug known as Ecstasy is the synthetic compound 3-4
methylene-dioxy-methamphetamine, or MDMA. Other similar compounds
found to be dangerous have sometimes been sold under the same name,
and other nicknames include ''X,'' ''XTC,'' and ''Adam.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the law, Ecstasy is in the same legal class as heroin and
cocaine. People holding 5 ounces or more - about 500 pills that
carry a street price of $20 - would face a prison term of up to 20
years.
</P>
<P>
   ''The new law puts Ecstasy dealers on notice: We won't tolerate
trafficking in this drug, and we will punish you severely if you
do,'' the governor said.
</P>
<P>
   Possessing Ecstasy had been rated as a third-degree criminal
drug offense with a maximum prison sentence of five years. State
law had set no degrees of punishment for offenders with increasing
amounts of the drug.
</P>
<P>
   The new law keeps the third-degree offense only for those caught
with less than half an ounce. Offenders with between half an ounce
and 5 ounces will now face up to 10 years in prison, a
second-degree crime. Each ounce is about 100 pills.
</P>
<P>
   The law also provides for warnings to parents and teen-agers
through the state Health and Education departments about the risks
of Ecstasy. The warning will include letters home and posters for
schools and health facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ''This new law sends a message to New Jersey's young people as
well: Stay away from Ecstasy. In fact, stay away from all drugs,''
Whitman said. ''A quick thrill isn't worth the threat of long-term
damage to your health and your future.''

<HEADLINE> Teacher overruled, students who failed graduate at ceremony  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   QUEENSBURY, N.Y. (AP) - Two high school seniors who flunked a
course despite repeated opportunities to make up the work have
graduated with their class after their parents pressured
administrators.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in other school districts said they've regularly faced
similar cases in which parents have demanded that students with
spotty academic records be allowed to graduate, according to the
Glens Falls Post-Star.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just not right,'' said the teacher, Sonja Martinson, who
has taught for 28 years at the Queensbury Central School District
46 miles north of Albany. She said she's outraged that in this day
of raising academic standards statewide that she feels
administrators lowered standards after bowing to repeated parental
complaints in the last week of school.
</P>
<P>
   Martinson said the students didn't get good enough grades in her
elective class in mythology despite opportunities to do extra work
to make up for poor test scores.
</P>
<P>
   At first, she told the Glens Falls Post-Star, administrators
told her the students would be allowed to take part in graduation
ceremonies but would simply be given a fake diploma and would have
to make up the class. Later, she said she learned the students had
received their diplomas.
</P>
<P>
   Acting Superintendent Linda Noon denied that parents' complaints
triggered the decision to allow the two students to graduate. But
she acknowledged that the parents' protests prompted a review of
the students' grades. She said the review showed the students met
the requirements for passing.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can't bend under pressure, but you need to look at every
case individually,'' Noon said. ''We try to be extremely fair to
all our students.''
</P>
<P>
   The Queensbury students' names weren't released.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Speaks With Barak, Arafat  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton talked on the phone Monday
to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak, but no decision has been reached for a Camp David-style
Mideast summit.
</P>
<P>
   After a recent round of shuttle diplomacy by Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, Palestinians and Israelis were reported as
remaining far apart on crucial issues, including whether Israel
would withdraw from all territory it took in the 1967 Six-Day War.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke on the phone for about 15 minutes with Barak and
30 minutes with Arafat from Camp David, the presidential retreat in
Maryland's Catoctin Mountains where Egypt and Israel held a summit
with President Carter in 1978. Clinton is trying to assess whether
the parties are close enough to bring the leaders together, or
whether further lower-level negotiations are needed, White House
spokesman P.J. Crowley said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He (Clinton) recognizes that at some point we'll need to get
the leaders together to work through the most difficult issues that
they still face, but the president has made no decision on what the
next step is -- whether it is to resume negotiations, or go to a
leadership meeting,'' Crowley said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we recognize there's a danger to bringing the leaders
together prematurely if we don't think they're close enough to
where that kind of meeting could bridge those differences.''
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians and Israelis are far behind their schedule for
a final status agreement by Sept. 13. Arafat has said he will
declare a Palestinian state on that date if the negotiations have
not been conclusive, which would be almost sure to increase tension
in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Arafat's pending declaration, Crowley said: ''Our
position has not changed. Unilateral steps outside of final status
negotiations are not helpful.''

<HEADLINE> Detained Activist Visited in Cairo  </HEADLINE>
By MAAMOUN YOUSSEF
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- A U.S. embassy official visited a human
rights activist Monday three days after the U.S.-Egyptian citizen
was detained on charges of harming Egypt's image.
</P>
<P>
   More human rights groups spoke out Monday in defense of Saad
Eddin Ibrahim, a sociology professor at the American University in
Cairo and head of an Egyptian think tank.
</P>
<P>
   Ibrahim was arrested Friday night with three assistants. He was
later detained for 15 days and transferred to a Cairo prison.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is well and everything is fine. We are satisfied with the
visit,'' an embassy spokesman told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Ambassador to Egypt Daniel Kurtzer has spoken on Ibrahim's
behalf to high Egyptian government officials, including Prime
Minister Atef Obeid, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor General Maher Abdel-Wahed has placed Ibrahim on a
list of people not allowed to leave Egypt, security officials said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   They said police detained eight employees of Ibrahim's think
tank, the Ibn Khaldun Center on Monday, accusing them of embezzling
$2.8 million donated by the European Union to boost voters'
political awareness.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's detainees are Mohammed Ibrahim, Tarek Hassan, Khaled
Fayyad, Mamdouh Mansour, Tamer Nabil, Ahmed Atta, Ibrahim Kamal and
Hassan Saleh, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Ibrahim told The Associated Press on Saturday that prosecutors
have charged him with preparing a documentary about elections that
harms Egypt's image, receiving foreign funds without government
permission and forging an election ballot. He said the ballot was a
dummy made expressly for the film, which was being funded by the
European Union.
</P>
<P>
   Ibrahim has accused Egyptian officials of rigging voting.
Parliamentary elections are expected in November.
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty International said in a statement Monday it had written
to the Egyptian government expressing concern about Ibrahim's
detention.
</P>
<P>
   The group said it and other rights organizations were concerned
''about repeated attempts by the Egyptian authorities to muzzle and
intimidate human rights defenders.''
</P>
<P>
   In Egypt, several rights groups protested the detention.
</P>
<P>
   ''We call for the immediate release of Ibrahim as there are no
reasonable legal grounds for his preventive detention,'' The Arab
Center for the Independence of the Judiciary and the Legal
Profession said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The Cairo-based World Center for Human Rights said ''the arrest
is aimed at putting an end to Ibrahim's ... activities in the field
of ethnic minorities in Egypt and other Arab countries.''
</P>
<P>
   For years Ibrahim has criticized Arab governments for their lack
of democracy and discrimination against minorities. In Egypt, he
called for greater opportunities for the country's Coptic
Christians, who make up about 10 percent of the country's 64
million people.
</P>
<P>
   The Egyptian Center for Human Rights for National Unity, a small
group that defends Copts, called Ibrahim a ''courageous Egyptian
hero.'' In a statement issued in Washington, the group called for
Ibrahim's immediate release and urged the U.N. secretary-general to
work for his freedom.

<HEADLINE> Mexico's New President Details Plans  </HEADLINE>
By NIKO PRICE
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Vicente Fox woke up Monday and realized the
magnitude of what he had just done -- come from political obscurity
a decade ago to bring down the world's longest-ruling party.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt responsibility,'' Mexico's next president said in an
interview with The Associated Press. ''People have told me, 'You're
our last hope,' 'Don't fail us, Vicente.' So I can't fail.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox, a businessman from northern Mexico known as much for his
cowboy boots as for his political philosophy, stunned the world
with his decisive victory in Sunday's elections over the party that
has ruled Mexico uninterrupted since the Depression began.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in English and Spanish at a Mexico City hotel
Monday afternoon, Fox described his vision of the transformations
ahead for Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would spend the next two months recruiting and hiring
Cabinet secretaries and aides to form ''a very transparent,
accountable government. We will have moral authority and democratic
legitimacy,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would have teams search for qualified candidates from
any party -- or from outside all parties -- and then interview the
top three candidates for each post himself.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not showing up to govern with friends or relatives or
buddies,'' he said. ''I'm showing up to govern with the most
professional team there is in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox said his first priorities would be to tackle the commitments
he made during his campaign: creating jobs, improving education and
eliminating corruption and crime.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would reform electoral laws to let Mexican migrants
vote in the United States, and that he would work with the United
States to open the borders to workers over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   In the long term, he said, he would pressure to expand the North
American Free Trade Agreement into a common market -- similar to the
European Union -- of the United States, Canada and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   He said that would eliminate the migration problem and bring
Mexican salaries up to where they are in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''The United States has always tried to resolve migration, drug
trafficking or trading problems on a day-to-day basis, and we will
never solve it in that way,'' he said. ''We need to think
long-term, 20-30 years from now, where we want to be.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mexico wants to be an equal partner with the United States and
Canada ... and if we have wisdom and we have a long-term view, we
should be able to meet that long-term objective.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox said President Clinton had called to congratulate him, and
that the two planned to meet before he takes office on Dec. 1, even
though Clinton will be gone shortly after Fox's term begins.
</P>
<P>
   ''He said congratulations to me and to all Mexicans for this
historic day,'' Fox said. ''He committed himself to be always near
and always accessible for any Mexican problems that might present
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox also sought to reassure investors in Mexico to prevent the
kind of economic crisis that has plagued Mexico in each of the last
four presidential handovers -- even though those were among members
of the same parties.
</P>
<P>
   ''That won't happen this time,'' Fox said, then turned to
address an imaginary group of investors: ''You are the ones who
know business. You are the ones who create jobs. My obligation is
to serve you, to support you, to create confidence inside you.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox said he's considering doing away with jackets and ties once
he begins his term. And the cowboy boots? They aren't coming off.
</P>
<P>
   ''Not even in the grave,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Dalai Lama Meets With Albright  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Dalai Lama met Monday with Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright and outlined his ideas for promoting
cultural and religious self-governance of Tibet within a framework
of continued Chinese sovereignty over the region, a senior U.S.
official said.
</P>
<P>
   Julia Taft, the State Department coordinator on Tibetan issues,
said Albright discussed with the Dalai Lama the recent talks on
Tibet that she held with Chinese President Jiang Zemin during her
recent visit to Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   The Tibetan leader met briefly with reporters after the
30-minute meeting and had praise for Albright.
</P>
<P>
   ''She always has tried to help materialize meaningful talk,
dialogue,'' he said. ''I always appreciate her effort and not only
as secretary of state but she also is personally also taking a
genuine concern.''
</P>
<P>
   Taft said the Dalai Lama always has been consistent in his view
that ''he is not a splittist. He is not seeking independence for
Tibet.
</P>
<P>
   ''He wants to move forward. He wants to find some way to improve
stability of China by not having Tibet be an issue. The way he sees
that is through dialogue and discussions and promotion of
self-governance.''
</P>
<P>
   Also on Monday, approximately 150 students and Tibetan exiles
gathered at the World Bank to protest a Chinese program that, if
approved by the World Bank, could move 58,000 Chinese into
impoverished regions of Tibet.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters, who said they would appear in front of the
building each day until the World Bank's Thursday vote, chanted:
''World Bank out of Tibet,'' and held banners, one reading: ''No
World Bank funds for China colonization.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dalai Lama has been on an extended U.S. visit. He met with
President Clinton two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   In advance, China lodged a strong protest with the United States
in which it expressed ''deep resentment'' about the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Tibetan affair is purely China's internal affair, which
brooks no interference from foreign countries,'' a foreign ministry
spokesman in Beijing said.
</P>
<P>
   China opposes autonomy for Tibet and sees the Dalai Lama as a
rallying point for pro-independence forces. Chinese officials have
refused to meet with him.

<HEADLINE> Three killed in crash on Route 42  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON TOWNSHIP , N.J. (AP) - Three people were killed and
three members of a Pennsylvania family were injured in a
three-vehicle crash on Route 42 that closed the southbound lanes of
the road for about two hours Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The identities of the those killed had not been released late
Monday afternoon because State Police were trying to notify their
families.
</P>
<P>
   The incident began at 11:44 a.m. when the driver of a 1989 Ford
Probe traveling westbound on the Atlantic City Expressway lost
control of the car, State Police said.
</P>
<P>
   The car crossed the median and went into the southbound lanes of
Route 42 where it struck a 1999 Dodge Durango head-on, according to
the State Police. The Durango was driven by Thomas Jacob, 49, of
Devon, Pa. and his wife, Marie Jacob, 48, was a passenger, police
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Durango spun around and rolled over after crashing into a
1995 Jeep Cherokee being driven by Michael Foy, 26, of West
Chester, Pa., State Police said. A passenger in the Cherokee was
Deidre Jacob, 19, of Devon, Pa., the daughter of the couple in the
Durango, according to police. Foy and Deidre Jacob were following
the Durango, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The driver of the Probe was airlifted to Cooper
Hospital-University Medical Center in Camden where he was
pronounced dead, police said. The two passengers in the Probe were
pronounced dead at the scene of the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Marie Jacob was in critical condition at Cooper, a hospital
spokeswoman said Monday. Thomas and Deidre were treated and
released, the spokeswoman said. Police had no report of injuries to
Foy.
</P>
<P>
   Route 42 was reopened about 1:30 p.m., but the investigation
caused traffic delays until 4 p.m. The crash is still under
investigation.

<HEADLINE> Erie Canal reopens after work on damaged Lock 12 near Fort Hunter  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   FORT HUNTER, N.Y. (AP) - The Erie Canal is reopened after work
was done on a lock 32 miles northwest of Albany that was damaged
since June 7.
</P>
<P>
   With the work done on Lock 12, the entire system is open for the
boating season that ends Nov. 1, said state Canal Corp. Executive
Director John Platt.
</P>
<P>
   The lock on the canal popular with pleasure boats was shut down
after part of the dam and bridge was severely damaged by
floodwaters on June 6. The lock reopened Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   A temporary dam was built as part of a $1.6 million contract
awarded to Chemung Contracting Corp. The dam and bridge also
supports county Route 27 which closed June 7. Further tests are
needed to determine when the highway might reopen.
</P>
<P>
   The bridge connects Tribes Hill with Fort Hunter in rural
Montgomery County. Without the bridge, the detour to get between
the tiny villages within sight of each other is 12 miles.

<HEADLINE> New toll plaza will have glass walkways, real flowers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CARNEY'S POINT, N.J. (AP) - Twenty-three lanes of limestone,
glass walkways and real flowers.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey Turnpike officials say the planned $44 million new
toll plaza will end legendary traffic tie-ups at Interchange 1 and
make New Jerseyans proud.
</P>
<P>
   ''It doesn't look like a typical interchange,'' said New Jersey
Turnpike Authority Executive Director Edward Gross. ''Just about
everyone I've shown the design to says it's very attractive. That
was the intent.''
</P>
<P>
   Construction begins next year on the new plaza, a few miles from
the Delaware Memorial Bridge and 1.2 miles north of the existing,
50-year-old plaza. Its opening is scheduled for June 2003.
</P>
<P>
   The plaza, which will include administrative offices, will have
23 lanes, eight more than the old one, to alleviate holiday and
summer weekend traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Backups of six to 20 miles are not unusual on holiday weekends,
when some 80,000 motorists pass through the plaza. The turnpike
authority has occasionally let drivers cruise through the plaza for
free rather than have backups all the way to Delaware.
</P>
<P>
   The plaza, with a limestone and whitewashed facade, will include
glass walkways for toll collectors and outside faucets so that
motorists can pass by real flowers instead of fake ones that sit at
other toll plazas.
</P>
<P>
   Motorists said the plaza will give a good impression of New
Jersey to drivers entering the state for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ''It looks pretty,'' said Peter Light, 43, of Staten Island.
</P>
<P>
   But Ed and Deena Moss of Cheltenham, Pa., wondered about the $44
million cost.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have to go through, give them your money and drive away,''
Deena Moss said. ''That seems like more than you need for that
scenario.''

<HEADLINE> Jurors questioned witnesses in pilot program  </HEADLINE>
By J.J. THOMPSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Camden County Superior Court Judge John T.
McNeill III noticed a welcome change in the jury box during the
last six months.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors generally seemed interested and more enthusiastic while
performing their civic duty - something he attributes to a pilot
program that allows them to question witnesses during civil trials.
</P>
<P>
   ''They really felt more involved,'' he said. ''I think it cuts
down on the number of people there (who try) to get out of
serving.''
</P>
<P>
   During the experiment, which began Jan. 1 and ended Friday,
jurors in selected courtrooms throughout the state were allowed to
take notes and submit written questions to witnesses during civil
trials.
</P>
<P>
   Judges and attorneys then looked over the questions - outside of
the presence of witnesses and jurors - to ensure there were no
objections. If there weren't any problems, the questions were posed
to witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys then had the chance to present follow-up questions.
</P>
<P>
   McNeill said he informally spoke to jurors about the opportunity
while they filled out questionnaires after trials.
</P>
<P>
   ''I got a lot of positive comments,'' he said. ''I wouldn't be
surprised at all to see it became part of our court rules.''
</P>
<P>
   The pilot program went smoothly, said Gloucester County Superior
Court Judge Donald A. Smith, and he didn't mind allowing jurors to
question witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it keeps the jurors interested because they know they
will have an opportunity to fill in the blanks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A New Jersey Supreme Court advisory committee suggested the
experiment after the court ruled in 1993 that jurors couldn't ask
questions until guidelines were established.
</P>
<P>
   While the program was popular with some judges, several
attorneys weren't as enthusiastic.
</P>
<P>
   McNeill said lawyers worried jurors would ask questions about
issues they hoped to avoid, which he discounts as a weak argument.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you look at it from the perspective that a trial is
supposed to be the search for truth, I'd say a complaint like that
doesn't hold much water,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, he said attorneys objected to 10 to 15 percent of the
questions posed by jurors. And the questions did extend the length
of some trials.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory P. Joseph, former chairman of the American Bar
Association's section on litigation, helped the bar association
adopt guidelines in 1998 for the practice. He said the procedure
can enhance juror comprehension when implemented properly.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a very forward-looking experiment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many federal judges already allow it, said Joseph, now partner
of a Wall Street law firm. Arizona has adopted its own rules for
allowing jurors to question witnesses. Courts in Wisconsin,
Connecticut, Iowa and Montana have ruled that the practice is
acceptable under certain circumstances.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Majority of state residents satisfied with new inspection system </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - Most New Jerseyans are satisfied with the
state's new car inspection system despite criticism by state
officials, according to a new poll.
</P>
<P>
   More than 70 percent of respondents in a Star-Ledger/Eagleton
telephone poll said they were satisfied with the inspection
process. Seven out of 10 residents said they waited no longer than
30 minutes in line, while 46 percent said they waited 15 minutes to
get their cars inspected.
</P>
<P>
   More than eight out of 10 of those polled said that people
running the test were courteous and said they believed the test was
fair.
</P>
<P>
   The poll of 802 people was conducted by telephone June 8-13. The
results were published Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Only 206 people surveyed took their cars in for a test since
December and 118 of those people believed they had taken the
tougher emissions test.
</P>
<P>
   The enhanced auto emissions test has been plagued by breakdowns
and other problems, causing long waits at its debut in September.
An investigatory panel recently blamed state officials for ignoring
or squelching warnings that a contractor was unable to deliver the
test on time and as promised. The new test was designed to more
accurately measure tailpipe pollution to bring New Jersey in line
with federal clean air rules.
</P>
<P>
   The margin of error for the poll was plus or minus 3.5
percentage points for the entire sample, and plus or minus 7
percentage points for the 206 people who said they had their cars
tested since December.

<HEADLINE> 2 Charged With Rape at Naval Academy  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) -- Two Navy football players were charged
Monday with raping a female midshipman at an off-campus party.
</P>
<P>
   Cordrea Brittingham and Arion Keith Williams were each charged
with second-degree rape, a felony punishable by up to 20 years in
prison, said Kristin Riggin, spokeswoman for the Anne Arundel
County State's Attorneys Office. They were held on $250,000 bond
each, said police spokesman Tom O'Connor.
</P>
<P>
   Brittingham, a running back, and Williams, a cornerback, were
both sophomores last season.
</P>
<P>
   The alleged assault occurred at a party in Arnold late Thursday
or early Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The victim said she had become intoxicated at the party and
passed out in one of the bedrooms. When she awoke, she found
herself being assaulted, police said in a statement. She pushed the
two men away and they left the home.
</P>
<P>
   Police were alerted at 2:02 a.m. Friday by the North Arundel
Hospital in Glen Burnie of the reported rape.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Arundel County Police took custody of the two midshipmen
Monday afternoon, O'Connor said. They were turned over to the
county's criminal investigation unit in Crownsville by Naval
Intelligence, O'Connor said.
</P>
<P>
   Brittingham and Williams also were charged with second-degree
sex offense, a non-consensual sex act punishable by up to 20 years
in prison. Williams also was charged with third-degree sex offense,
non-consensual sexual contact punishable by up to 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Arundel County Police worked with the Navy Criminal
Investigative Service, but had primary jurisdiction in
investigating the case.
</P>
<P>
   Academy spokesman Cmdr. Mike Brady would not comment beyond
reading a statement saying two midshipmen had been charged.
</P>
<P>
   ''The state's attorney and Anne Arundel County police have
primary jurisdiction in this case,'' he said. ''Since this matter
is still under investigation by state authorities, it would be
inappropriate for the Naval Academy to discuss the allegations or
details of this case.''
</P>
<P>
   The Naval Academy has been rocked in recent years by a series of
scandals involving drug use, car thefts and sexual assaults on
female midshipmen.
</P>
<P>
   Several midshipmen have been expelled for sexual misconduct or
fraternization.

<HEADLINE> Home Support Big for Begay  </HEADLINE>
By MARY PEREA
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- Out on the golf course where Notah
Begay got his start, 16-year-old Dominic Sanchez was inspired to
practice.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now I have a goal,'' he said Monday, ''to come and make New
Mexico something, if I can do the same as him.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez works at the Ladera Golf Course, a municipal track on
Albuquerque's west side, the same course Begay grew up on. The only
American Indian on the PGA Tour, Begay won the Greater Hartford
Open on Sunday, his second consecutive victory and fourth in 10
months.
</P>
<P>
   ''Notah came through right at the end and made that putt,'' said
Sanchez, who watched on TV as Begay sank a 25-foot putt on the
final hole for a one-stroke victory over Mark Calcavecchia. ''We
started clapping, jumping up and down, we were real happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Begay's father, Notah Begay Jr., was not glued to the television
watching his son Sunday. He was caddying for his younger son Greg,
who was competing in a city tournament. Word of Notah's win came
from his wife over a cellular phone.
</P>
<P>
   ''All I heard was a scream. At that moment there was joy in my
heart, tears in my eyes and lumps in my throat. I was very happy
for a young man that has worked so hard and gone through so much,''
his father said.
</P>
<P>
   Begay's story topped the sports section of Monday's Albuquerque
Journal, ahead of Wimbledon, a local golf story, a feature on
Olympic athletes and a sports column. Up to 5 percent of the
population of the greater Albuquerque area is American Indian,
according to Census Bureau estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Begay's wins make him the first player to win consecutive
tournaments since Tiger Woods last year. Begay was a teammate of
Woods' at Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tiger's been a great asset as my career progresses because
he's probably one of the one or two most recognizable people in the
world,'' Begay said Sunday. ''I'm just hoping to be the most
recognizable guy in Albuquerque.''
</P>
<P>
   Begay, 27, is never too far from his New Mexico roots. He has
returned to Albuquerque to conduct golf clinics for children and
work on his game in between tours.
</P>
<P>
   At Ladera, where about 100,000 rounds are played each year,
there are plans to build a pavilion featuring a Notah Begay room,
which will display some of his golf memorabilia, said Sam Zimmerly,
the course manager.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmerly said he expected Begay to win Sunday because ''I know
he's mentally tougher than most people out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Begay is rebuilding his confidence after pleading guilty earlier
this year to a drunken-driving charge. He spent a week in jail,
then missed five cuts in 10 tournaments after that.
</P>
<P>
   Overcoming his personal problems and the death of a close friend
last week added to his resolve to win.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez has been golfing for a year and a half, and is a member
of the Junior PGA and the golf team at Valley High School. He said
he met Begay at a Christmas party last year. Since then, he said,
Begay has given him a lot of advice.
</P>
<P>
   The most important: ''Stay with your goals. You can make it if
you really apply yourself.''

<HEADLINE> Devil Rays Activate Castilla  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Vinny Castilla, who missed 17 games
with a sore back, was activated from the 15-day disabled list by
the Tampa Bay Devil Rays on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   To make room on its roster, the team optioned outfielder Quinton
McCracken to Triple-A Durham of the International League.
</P>
<P>
   Castilla, hitting .219 with six homers and 32 RBIs, returned to
the lineup against the Detroit Tigers, batting fifth. He had not
played since June 13 when he was removed after six innings against
the Anaheim Angels because of lower back inflammation.
</P>
<P>
   The third baseman, who turns 33 on Tuesday, was acquired from
Colorado in an offseason trade for Rolando Arrojo. He missed only
14 games with the Rockies from 1995-99 and had never been on the
disabled list before serving two stints this season.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel good,'' he said before Monday night's game. ''I really
hope I can stay healthy the rest of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   McCracken, a starter two years ago who missed most of last
season with a knee injury, headed to Durham for the second time
this season. He hit .115 with two RBIs in 12 games for the Devil
Rays.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving, the 29-year-old reiterated his desire to be
traded if he doesn't fit into Tampa Bay's plans.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to play in the major leagues,'' McCracken said. ''The
next logical step would be for the organization to get something
for me.''

<HEADLINE> Man dies, several injured in Passaic apartment fire  </HEADLINE>
By J.J. THOMPSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASSAIC, N.J. (AP) - Investigators are looking into the cause of
a fire that killed a man and forced members of his family and other
residents to flee early Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters were called to the 2&AMP;frac12; story building at 371
Highland Ave. just after 5 a.m., said fire Capt. Al Hastick.
</P>
<P>
   The second-floor apartment - where the fire began - was occupied
by a grandmother, a couple, their 1-year-old daughter and two other
children from the mother's previous marriage, Hastick said.
</P>
<P>
   The grandmother, Joyce Mosley, age unknown, and two girls, ages
12 and 10, made it safely outside, but the couple and their infant
were trapped, Hastick said.
</P>
<P>
   One-year-old Deajia Anderson was dropped out of the first-floor
window and caught by an unknown bystander, according to Hastick.
The mother, Monique Anderson, 40, jumped out the window and was
severely injured, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Husband Donald Anderson, age unknown, died on the second floor,
Hastick said.
</P>
<P>
   On the third floor, Kemp Mosley, age unknown, escaped without
injuries, Hastick said. Thirty-year-old Adrienne Stegall jumped
from the third-floor fire escape, injuring her right leg, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Residents on the first floor made it safely outside,
firefighters said.
</P>
<P>
   Hastick said a chained fire escape ladder and an air conditioner
blocking a third-floor window hampered efforts to evacuate the
building.
</P>
<P>
   Monique Anderson was taken to Saint Barnabas Medical Center burn
unit in Livingston and was in critical condition Monday afternoon,
according to hospital officials.
</P>
<P>
   Deajia Anderson and Stegall were transported to Saint Joseph's
Hospital &AMP; Medical Center in Paterson, where they were treated and
released, a spokeswoman said.

<HEADLINE> Report: Mayor Giuliani's father served time at Sing Sing  </HEADLINE>
By BETH GARDINER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's late father Harold
served a year-and-a-half in Sing Sing prison for holding up a
milkman at gunpoint in the 1930s, a decade before his law-and-order
son was born, The Village Voice reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Harold Giuliani pleaded guilty to third-degree armed robbery in
May 1934, a month after milkman Harold Hall was robbed in the
stairwell of an Upper East Side apartment building, the Voice
reported in an excerpt from reporter Wayne Barrett's upcoming book
about the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani and an accomplice stopped Hall as he entered the
building to collect customer payments, pointed a gun at him and
took $128.82 from his pocket, the Voice said.
</P>
<P>
   The report comes in the midst of a difficult year for Rudolph
Giuliani, who recent dropped out of the U.S. Senate race after
revealing he had prostate cancer, was separating from his wife and
had formed a close friendship with another woman.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor, a former federal prosecutor, has built his career on
a reputation as a crime-fighter, gaining national prominence as New
York's crime rates dropped dramatically under his administration.
Until recently, he rarely spoke about his personal life.
</P>
<P>
   Sunny Mindel, a spokeswoman for the mayor, declined to comment
on the story about Harold Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   ''We haven't read it,'' she said. ''Don't read The Village
Voice.''
</P>
<P>
   A call to the state Department of Correctional Services seeking
confirmation of the report was not immediately returned.
</P>
<P>
   After a police officer interrupted the aborted robbery, an
indictment identified Harold Giuliani, then 26, as the man who
pressed a gun into Hall's abdomen, the Voice reported. But the
milkman later changed his statement, saying Giuliani's accomplice
wielded the pistol, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said in court that Hall had been told to change his
story, according to the Voice.
</P>
<P>
   ''This milkman tried to change his statement after he was
visited at about four o'clock that morning by several people who
threatened him,'' assistant district attorney Louis Capozzoli
reportedly said at a court hearing. ''Then he said he thought this
fellow (Giuliani) ought to get a break.''
</P>
<P>
   Harold Giuliani, who told a judge his name was Joseph Starrett,
was initially charged with four felonies, and pleaded innocent, the
Voice reported. After Hall changed his statement, Giuliani was
allowed to plead guilty to just one felony, according to the paper.
He was sentenced to two to five years and released on parole after
a year and a half.
</P>
<P>
   The Voice report says Harold Giuliani's criminal record is filed
under the name Joseph Starrett.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor recalled his father's influence on him while speaking
to reporters about his cancer diagnosis in April. Harold Giuliani
died of prostate cancer in 1981 at age 73.
</P>
<P>
   ''It brings up very painful memories,'' the mayor said of the
diagnosis. ''And, you know, I miss my father every day of my life.
And he's a very, very important reason for why I'm standing here as
the mayor of New York City.''
</P>
<P>
   The Village Voice story, headlined ''Thug Life,'' describes
Harold Giuliani as a hot-tempered man who was quick to throw a
punch and rarely held a legitimate job.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1940s, it says, he began working as a bartender at a
tavern owned by his brother-in-law Leo D'Avanzo, the brother of
Rudolph Giuliani's mother Helen.
</P>
<P>
   The Voice says D'Avanzo ran a loan-sharking and gambling
operation out of the bar, Vincent's Restaurant. Harold Giuliani
wielded a baseball bat to collect debts owed to his brother-in-law,
according to the paper, which quoted an unidentified witness as
saying he saw Harold Giuliani smack a man in the face with a bat
after the man asked for an extra week to repay a loan.
</P>
<P>
   Another unidentified source told the Voice that the elder
Giuliani came to his house to collect a loan and threatened to
break bones. That dispute was resolved without violence, the paper
said.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani moved his family from Brooklyn to Long Island in 1951,
and left his bartending job in the late 1950s to become a school
custodian. He was eventually fired for failing to show up to work,
the Voice said.

<HEADLINE> Judge tells Ocean County man to prove he has cancer  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TOMS RIVER, N.J. (AP) - An Ocean County man accused of trying to
have the man who allegedly sexually assaulted his daughter killed
has asked a judge to release him from jail so he can receive
medical treatment for prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Superior Court Judge Edward J. Turnbach Friday told him to prove
it.
</P>
<P>
   Turnbach said he hasn't seen any medical records for William J.
Fisher, of Stafford, but directed jail officials to notify
prosecutors if his condition gets worse.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher, 40, was charged in February with conspiracy to commit
murder for hire after he met twice with an investigator from the
Ocean County Prosecutor's Office who posed as a hit man or someone
who could get one.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher's family told the Asbury Park Press of Neptune that
Kenneth Guenther, of Barnegat, was the target because he had
repeatedly abused Fisher's daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Guenther has been indicted on two charges of aggravated sexual
assault. He told the newspaper the charges are unfounded, and that
Fisher manipulated the girl to destroy Guenther's relationship with
Fisher's ex-wife.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher was released in March after posting $50,000 bail. He was
arrested last week on a new charge: He tried to fraudulently obtain
a controlled substance.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said Fisher, using a cell phone, pretended he was a
physician so he could get a prescription drug from the ShopRite
pharmacy in Stafford.
</P>
<P>
   L. Gilbert Farr, Fisher's attorney, said his client is innocent
of the recent charge.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher remains in Ocean County Jail in lieu of $50,000 bail for
the conspiracy count and $10,000 for the drug charge.
</P>
<P>
   ''My client is in bad health,'' Farr said. ''He's under a
doctor's care at the jail. He is supposed to begin chemotherapy
next week.''

<P>
	   GLASSBORO, N.J. (AP) - A kitchen fire in the Student Center at
Rowan University on Sunday caused no structural damage to the
building, a school spokesman said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The fire caused about $10,000 in damage, spokesman Joe Cardona
said. Repairs and cleanup are expected to be completed in a week
and would include the replacement of some wiring, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Four people were injured in the fire that forced 100 to be
evacuated. Three of the injured were treated at the site, while the
fourth, a kitchen worker at the school, was taken to Kennedy
Memorial Hospital in Washington Township and treated for smoke
inhalation and released, Cardona said.
</P>
<P>
   The blaze broke out in a deep-fryer just before 3:30 p.m.,
officials said. It took 30 firefighters about an hour to control
the blaze that sent heavy smoke throughout the building, according
to Glassboro Fire Department Deputy Chief Ralph Johnson.

<HEADLINE> Rangers Waive Mark Clark  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Right-hander Mark Clark got his wish
Monday when the Texas Rangers placed him on waivers for the purpose
of his unconditional release.
</P>
<P>
   If Clark is not claimed by Thursday, he would become a free
agent.
</P>
<P>
   Clark, 3-5 with a 7.98 ERA, hasn't been happy with his
diminished role with the Rangers, and has expressed his desire to
leave the team several times.
</P>
<P>
   ''What good is it being here?,'' Clark told The Fort Worth
Star-Telegram in a story published Monday, before his release.
''I'm not doing the club any good sitting out there in the bullpen
and not pitching, and I'm not doing myself good career-wise. Since
I'm a mistake, I don't see any reason to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark was not in the clubhouse prior to Monday night's game
against Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   Team owner Tom Hicks referred to Clark as a ''mistake'' last
week.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the club's high-priced veterans haven't played well this
season for the Rangers, the two-time defending AL West champions
who now sit in last place.
</P>
<P>
   Clark signed a $9.3 million, two-year contract with the Rangers
as a free agent after the 1998 season. The Rangers must pay the
remainder of his $5 million salary this season and $300,000 to buy
out a $5 million option for 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The former starter was converted into a seldom-used long
reliever. He has pitched just once since June 16, losing 6-3 to
Seattle on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It didn't work out for either one of us,'' manager Johnny
Oates said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Oates said that while Clark's health and his lack of use were
factors, the pitcher had been given opportunities to prove himself.
</P>
<P>
   To fill the roster spot, the Rangers recalled infielder Kelly
Dransfelt from Triple-A Oklahoma of the Pacific Coast League.
Dransfelt was in uniform for Monday night's game against Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   Texas had been expected to wait until the All-Star break at the
earlier before deciding on Clark's future, but the Rangers needed
to make a move after shortstop Royce Clayton left Sunday night's
game with a strained oblique muscle in his left side.
</P>
<P>
   Clayton will be out of the lineup until at least Friday.

<HEADLINE> Nephew charged with 1997 murder of Camden schoolteacher  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) - The nephew of a Camden schoolteacher was
arraigned Monday on charges that he murdered his aunt by stabbing
her to death in her home in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Marvin Q. Smith argued with his aunt, Paula Macklin, on Nov. 17,
1997, in her Camden home, prosecutors said. The fight escalated,
and Smith beat his aunt and stabbed her with a kitchen knife,
according to prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Smith then robbed Macklin's house and fled in her 1997 Jeep
Cherokee, said Greg Reinert, spokesman for the Camden County
Prosecutor's Office.
</P>
<P>
   Macklin's body was found later that evening by her son, Michael
Smith, 28, and his girlfriend. The blade was still in Macklin's
chest.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is hurting two mothers. It's hurting my mother and
hurting my nephew's parents,'' Macklin's sister, Melinda Rijos,
told The Courier-Post of Cherry Hill for Monday's edition. ''It
hurts all the way around.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, 22, was arrested and charged Sunday for his aunt's murder
after being arrested by Glassboro police on an unrelated charge.
</P>
<P>
   He is being held in Camden County Jail in lieu of $300,000 cash
bail.
</P>
<P>
   Macklin, 44, was a kindergarten teacher at McGraw School in
Camden.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's hard. Everybody's really numb right now,'' said Rijos, of
Cherry Hill. ''It's somebody she really trusted.''

<HEADLINE> Royals Move Suppan To Bullpen  </HEADLINE>
By DOUG TUCKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Jeff Suppan, who has given up 23 of the
major league-high 132 homers of Kansas City's pitching staff, was
demoted to the bullpen Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Taking his spot in the rotation will likely be Blake Stein, who
has been out since spring training with a fractured bone in his
right forearm.
</P>
<P>
   ''Each game, I'm not moving forward,'' said Suppan, who was
10-12 with a 4.53 ERA last year, tying Jose Rosado for most wins on
the Royals. ''It's best for me to get a few innings out of the
bullpen. I wish I would have figured it out already. But I haven't,
so this is a good time to figure it out. I've tried to do
everything except be aggressive.'''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Tony Muser said he hoped the bullpen assignment would
not be permanent for Suppan, 2-6 with a 5.57 ERA in 18 starts.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think he's a little confused right now, a little bit
frustrated. He's given up quite a few home runs and he's lost his
aggressiveness,'' Muser said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not a physical thing. It's a mental thing. He needs a
break. It's just like every-day position players need a couple of
days off sometimes when they get confused and things aren't going
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Stein, a right-hander who came to the Royals last year from
Oakland in the Kevin Appier trade, was being counted on as a major
part of the rotation. In his last rehab start for Triple-A Omaha,
he beat Nashville 6-1, allowed four hits in seven scoreless innings
with nine strikeouts and no walks.
</P>
<P>
   Stein was expected to arrive in Kansas City on Monday and might
take Suppan's start Friday at Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm happy to see Stein. But at the same time I don't want to
get overly excited because he's been in rehab a long time,'' Muser
said. ''He's missed half the season because of that broken bone. I
hope he helps us. But I'm not expecting Nolan Ryan.''

<HEADLINE> Jamaican Sprinter Reinstated  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTE CARLO, Monaco (AP) -- Jamaican sprinter Merlene Ottey had
her two-year ban for steroid use lifted Monday after an
international track panel said the lab improperly tested her urine
sample.
</P>
<P>
   The decision meant the former world champion and Olympic silver
medalist was immediately eligible to compete.
</P>
<P>
   The IAAF, track and field's world governing body, said in a
statement that its three-man arbitration panel had decided after a
hearing last month ''there were not the grounds to maintain the
suspension of Merlene Ottey from competition.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Accordingly, the suspension ... ended with immediate effect,''
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Ottey issued a statement that was read at a news conference in
Kingston, Jamaica.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am very relieved and happy at this ruling. It confirms my
innocence once again,'' she said. ''It has been a difficult and
emotionally draining time for me. However, I've been training well
in preparation for the Olympic Games in Sydney, Australia, and I am
looking forward to my first competition.''
</P>
<P>
   The lifting of the ban caused quite a reaction throughout the
Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is news of significance not only in Jamaica but
throughout the Caribbean because Merlene Ottey has become an
international icon in the field of sports,'' Jamaican Prime
Minister P.J. Patterson said at a Caribbean summit in St. Vincent.
''I believe this is a very good day for us in the Caribbean.''
</P>
<P>
   The IAAF said the panel found fault with the testing laboratory,
which ''had not taken into sufficient account factors regarding the
specific gravity of the sample which as a result did not exceed the
IOC (International Olympic Committee) recommended reporting
threshold.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday's ruling was the second issued by the IAAF in a week in a
drug case involving a prominent athlete. Last week, it upheld the
two-year suspension of Javier Sotomayor of Cuba, the only high
jumper to clear 8 feet, for cocaine use. That decision appeared to
knock Sotomayor out of September's Olympics in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Ottey, winner of 34 individual medals in major international
championships, hopes to compete in the Sydney Olympics at 40.
</P>
<P>
   Ottey, a former world 200-meter champion, runner-up in the 100
and 200 at the 1996 Olympics and one of the most decorated athletes
in the sport, tested positive for the steroid nandrolone at a meet
in Switzerland in July 1999. She denied taking the drug and was
cleared by the Jamaican federation.
</P>
<P>
   The IAAF refused to accept the Jamaicans' ruling and sent her
case to its arbitration panel, composed of Christoph Vedder of
Germany, Monty Hacker of South Africa and James Murphy of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Nandrolone is a steroid that is easily detectable in standard
drug tests. But there has been a spate of positive nandrolone cases
around the world over the past year, prompting speculation that the
drug is contained in nutritional supplements.
</P>
<P>
   In March, the IAAF said it would conduct a research project to
determine whether food supplements and herbal preparations can
trigger positive tests for nandrolone and other banned substances.
The project is being carried out in cooperation with UK Athletics,
Britain's track governing body.
</P>
<P>
   Nandrolone produced 343 positive tests in all sports around the
world last year, according to official statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Among the athletes embroiled in nandrolone cases is Linford
Christie, the 1992 100-meter Olympic and world champion from
Britain, who was suspended after testing positive for the steroid.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the IAAF postponed Christie's hearing. It
had wanted to hear the case against the 39-year-old between July 6
and July 9, but it couldn't agree on the dates with UK Athletics. A
new date should be announced shortly.
</P>
<P>
   The IAAF originally suspended Christie, but UK Athletics
overruled the decision, and the case was sent to arbitration.
</P>
<P>
   Hearings for two other Britons facing nandrolone charges,
European 200-meter champion Doug Walker and hurdler Gary Cadogan,
were postponed for the same reason.
</P>
<P>
   Christie has retired from top competition, but Walker and
Cadogan hope to compete in this year's Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Vedder, the panel chairman, said the case would be an important
test for sports law regarding nandrolone.

<HEADLINE> Missing steer shows up at barbecue  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   COHOES, N.Y. (AP) - A family enjoying a backyard barbecue
unexpectedly had a steer for dinner Sunday while had steer for
dinner.
</P>
<P>
   The young, cream-colored animal missing for a week from a nearby
farm then bolted into a heavily wooded ravine before police
arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Despite several sightings, Cohoes police searching for the beast
about 5 miles north of Albany find themselves still asking,
''Where's the Beef?''
</P>
<P>
   One homeowner who came face-to-face with the steer said the
animal, which looks like an undersized bull, stood at the back of
his lawn for a few minutes as they sized up each other before the
steer raced away.
</P>
<P>
   The neighborhood lines a deep valley to the south where at least
a few farms still stand amid many new homes.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know why he'd want to be out there alone,'' said
Clayton Waterbury, who owns the missing steer that bolted June 23
from his Cherry Hill Farm. ''They're just as scared of you as you
are of them,'' he told the Albany Times Union.

<HEADLINE> Biathlete Killed in Mauling  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CFB VALCARTIER, Quebec (AP) -- A 24-year-old biathlete was killed
in an apparent bear attack while running on a training course.
</P>
<P>
   Police identified the woman Monday as Mary-Beth Miller of
Yellowknife, Northwest Territories.
</P>
<P>
   There was a bite mark on the back of Miller's neck when her body
was discovered just before midnight Sunday in the heavily wooded
area just northwest of Quebec City, Capt. Johanne Bournival said.
</P>
<P>
   Black bear tracks also were spotted near her body.
</P>
<P>
   ''At first sight it seems she was attacked by a bear,''
Bournival said.
</P>
<P>
   An autopsy will be conducted Wednesday, Sarah Coup-Fabiano, a
spokeswoman for the Haute-St-Charles police department, said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The autopsy will confirm whether the bear was the exact cause
of death or whether she had a heart attack or something before and
the animal found her injured,'' Coup-Fabiano said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just a hypothesis, but it's our belief that the bear was
responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller was a member of Biathlon Canada, the national biathlon
association, and had arrived at the base last week for a summer of
training at the Myriam Bedard Center. The area includes running and
cycling trails.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, who started her run at 9 a.m., was reported missing by
her trainer at 11 p.m., Bournival said.
</P>
<P>
   Her body was located by military searchers about a half-mile
from a main road.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, wildlife officials placed several cages around the
area in an effort to find the bear. The base closed the trails
until further notice.

<HEADLINE> Arafat: We'll Pledge Statehood  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA KING
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) -- Yasser Arafat's government told
Palestinians Monday to prepare for statehood by Sept. 13, even as
Israel insisted anew that independence must come only as part of a
peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians' chief policymaking body, the PLO's Central
Council, was wrapping up two days of closed-door talks in the Gaza
Strip about the timing of a statehood declaration.
</P>
<P>
   The chief policymaking body told Palestinians to get ready for
statehood by Sept. 13.
</P>
<P>
   The PLO Central Council declared its ''determination'' to
declare independence by that time, and called on the world
community to recognize statehood when it is declared, ''noting the
natural and historical right of our nation to establish a state.''
</P>
<P>
   The published statement, issued by the official Wafa news agency
30 minutes after the meeting concluded, went beyond a statement
read out by PCC chairman Salim Zanoun immediately after the
meeting, in which he noted the Sept. 13 date, but did not declare
it as a deadline.
</P>
<P>
   The PCC called on Arafat's government to launch the procedures
toward statehood, although it omitted his earlier threats to
declare statehood unilaterally, which Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak has said would lead to unilateral Israeli decisions. Such
brinkmanship would likely lead to violence.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians have said repeatedly they have the right in
principle to declare statehood any time after Sept. 13, when a
deadline for reaching a peace accord with Israel expires, with or
without a peace pact.
</P>
<P>
   Before the gathering's conclusion, Arafat aides said action by
year's end was inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   ''A Palestinian state will be declared in the year 2000,'' said
Nabil Shaath, the Palestinian planning minister.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian officials suggested privately, however, that real
decision-making about a precise date for independence still lay
ahead, and that nothing would be finalized without taking into
account factors like Palestinian public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Council sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Arafat
had quietly asked some council members to study whether the
Palestinian people would be willing to accept delays beyond Sept.
13
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials have said that a Palestinian declaration of
independence without a peace treaty would prompt Israel to annex
chunks of the West Bank -- a step that would very likely trigger a
violent confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   Barak told the parliamentary Defense and Foreign Affairs
Committee on Monday that in case of a unilateral statehood
declaration, Israel would annex Jewish settlement blocs, and would
militarize parts of the Jordan Valley. That would effectively
rescind Barak's recent offer to hand over the strategic lowlands as
part of a final peace package.
</P>
<P>
   ''We made it clear to the Palestinians quite some time ago that
we do not accept unilateral steps as a mode of action, and if they
take unilateral action we will take immediate unilateral steps of
our own,'' Barak told the committee, according to a partial
transcript released by the parliament's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   All this could be avoided if the sides reach an agreement by
Sept. 13 -- but that seems out of reach now, with both sides digging
in their heels on the most sensitive negotiation topics: Jerusalem,
borders and refugees.
</P>
<P>
   PCC chairman Zanoun's statement emphasized the tough line
Palestinian negotiators have taken in recent talks with Israel: a
right of return for Palestinian refugees of Israel's 1948
independence and the dismantling of all Jewish settlements in
disputed lands. Israel has adamantly rejected both positions.
</P>
<P>
   The PCC called on the international community to salvage the
peace talks by pressing Israel into compromises. It said a
Palestinian state would ''be a cornerstone for real peace in the
region.''
</P>
<P>
   Both sides say there has been a worrisome increase in tensions
on the ground, particularly in the crowded, impoverished Gaza
Strip.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli commanders have said publicly in recent weeks that the
army will use whatever force is necessary to put down any clashes
in the West Bank and Gaza. That has drawn angry protests from the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the statehood debate, some Palestinian officials pointed
out that there was much more to statehood than simply declaring it.
</P>
<P>
   ''I call upon my colleagues to work to organize the Palestinian
community, to build a Palestinian economy and to solve social
problems as well as building institutions that are needed in our
state,'' said Nabil Amr, the parliamentary affairs minister.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat has developed a reputation as an authoritarian leader,
and the PCC urged his government to ''respect democracy, the
independence of the judiciary, and freedom of speech.''
</P>
<P>
   The leadership meeting was boycotted by the radical Islamic
group Hamas, which bitterly opposes peace with Israel and has
repeatedly staged suicide bombings in the past to try to stave off
a peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   ''Without an armed struggle, we are wasting time,'' Hamas
spokesman Mahmoud Zahar said in Gaza. ''We believe negotiations
will bring nothing.''

	   SAN ANTONIO - A federal jury Monday concluded deliberations for
a third day without a verdict in the case of a South Texas

ex-wife.
</P>
<P>
   Deliberations will continue at 9 a.m. CDT Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Rockers' Top Scorer Out for Season  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Eva Nemcova, the Cleveland Rockers' leading
scorer, will miss the rest of the WNBA season after tearing a
ligament in her left knee.
</P>
<P>
   Nemcova was injured late in the first half of Cleveland's 75-67
loss in Los Angeles on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''I drove to the basket, planted my foot and twisted and that
was it,'' the 6-foot-3 Nemcova said before the Rockers played host
to the New York Liberty on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Nemcova, 27, a native of the Czech Republic, was averaging 13.2
points this season and came into her fourth WNBA season averaging
12.2 points and 3.8 rebounds. Nemcova, who holds the WNBA record
for consecutive free throws with 66, was a first-team all-league
selection in 1997 and a second-team pick the next season.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was surprised it was this bad because I felt nothing at the
time,'' Nemcova said. ''The doctors told me how bad it was Sunday
and I cried.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our team was doing so much better and now I cannot help. I am
very sad.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland, which won half of its first 14 games this season
under new coach Dan Hughes, has already matched its victory total
of last season when the Rockers went 7-25.
</P>
<P>
   Nemcova said she will have surgery in Cleveland later this month
and hopes to be back on the court in ''January or February'' with
Messina of the Italian League. She was the MVP of the 2000 Italian
League All-Star game and averaged 19.4 points last winter.

Road was met with defiance by the Orange Order, the province's
major Protestant group.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a complete non-runner. Everything goes ahead as
planned,'' said Orange Order spokesman David Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Sporadic protests erupted Monday evening near the Drumcree
Anglican Church, where British security forces for the past two
years have prevented Orangemen from parading past a nearby Catholic
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   A group of about 50 people behind the banner of the Ulster
Freedom Fighters -- an outlawed pro-British paramilitary group --
briefly marched to the church, 50 yards from a line of police and
armored British army vehicles blocking the way to Garvaghy Road.
</P>
<P>
   A crowd of several hundred threw rocks and other missiles at the
security forces before police moved in to clear away the
demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   Later, masked gunmen standing in front of an Ulster Freedom
Fighters banner fired a volley of shots in a Protestant area of
nearby Portadown.
</P>
<P>
   Though banning Sunday's parade, the commission said it might
permit a march on the Garvaghy Road later if members of the Orange
Order stopped protesting and agreed to consult with Catholics in
the divided town of Portadown.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came a day after Protestants clashed with
police near the Drumcree church, where another Orange march was
stopped from going down the Garvaghy Road. Seven police officers
suffered minor injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ''The decision is fundamentally flawed and allows Garvaghy Road
residents to sit on their hands and do nothing,'' Orange Order
spokesman Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the decision created a void that could be ''easily
filled in this country by people becoming violent -- although we
will do our best to prevent and discourage that -- but our
credibility has been reduced by this decision.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The onus is fairly and squarely on the Orange Order and the
events which the Orange Order carry out on the streets of Portadown
and elsewhere in the province this week,'' said Breandan Mac
Cionnaith, who has led protests by Garvaghy Road residents.
</P>
<P>
   The Portadown march, which commemorates the Battle of the Somme
in World War I, has caused violence whether or not police have
permitted the Orangemen to parade. Police forced Catholic
protesters off the road in 1996 and 1997, provoking riots in many
Catholic areas, but have banned the parade route since 1998,
triggering Protestant disturbances.
</P>
<P>
   The Parades Commission said the march could be allowed in three
to eight months if the Orange Order complied with the decision,
stopped protests at Drumcree and opened talks with Catholic
residents.
</P>
<P>
   The commission would then look to Garvaghy Road residents to
show ''that they were genuine in seeking a long-term resolution of
the intercommunal tensions in Portadown by taking steps to
facilitate the proposed parades.''
</P>
<P>
   The Orange Order, a hard-line fraternal group founded near
Portadown in the 1790s, remains influential today, particularly
over its opposition to Northern Ireland's 2-year-old peace accord.
Tens of thousands of Orangemen march each July, often to celebrate
17th-century military victories over Catholics.

<HEADLINE> Multi-tribe powow celebrates peace, all warriors  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   AURIESVILLE, N.Y. (AP) - At least nine tribes including the
Mohawks, Onondaga, Sioux, Incas and Aztecs celebrated culture,
peace and warriors in an annual powow.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds gathered at the fifth annual powwow in honor of Kateri
Tekakwitha over the weekend at the Auriesville Shrine 35 miles
northwest of Albany to see tribal dances, Indian crafts and taste
native American cuisine.
</P>
<P>
   Known as ''Lily of the Mohawks,'' Tekakwitha was born near
Auriesville in 1656 and established many Native American ministries
in Catholic churches throughout the United States and Canada, said
Bob Ross, powwow coordinator. The Catholic church is in the process
of canonizing Tekakwitha.
</P>
<P>
   Participants representing at least nine tribes performed
ceremonial dances in a roped off area known as ''The Circle.''
Before the dancers could go into The Circle they had to be smudged
with the smoke of burning sage to cleanse and rid them of any
negative energy.
</P>
<P>
   One of the dances performed was in honor of veterans, not only
Indians, but veterans of all wars, including World War I, World War
II, The Korean War, Vietnam, and Desert Storm.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are the only people who sing and dance to honor our
warriors,'' Ross told The Daily Gazette of Schenectady.
</P>
<P>
   Cathy Hauh Ha Chaun (One Who Weeps), an Apache from Yardley,
Pa., wore an intricate bead necklace that was once her
mother-in-law's, a turtle shell necklace, and a hair clip fastened
by the quill of a porcupine. She also carried a fan made from red
tail hawk feathers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do this to keep our heritage alive and so people remember
us,'' Hauh Ha Chaun said.
</P>
<P>
   She said powwows are held all over the country during the summer
months. She and her husband Bart Standing Elk, a Delaware Indian,
travel around from powwow to powwow dancing and enjoying the
festivities. ''It helps us to see people,'' she said. ''It's like
family.''
</P>
<P>
   The powwows ''allow us to share our culture and music,'' said
Jassier Cabrera, a member of the Inca tribe from Otabalo, Ecuador.
''It's educational.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I respect their culture and I like the music,'' said Carolyn
LaVare of Schenectady, of Irish descent. LaVare brought her
grandchildren to the festival so ''they learn to enjoy and respect
other cultures.''

<HEADLINE> Reds 3, Diamondbacks 2  </HEADLINE>
By MEL REISNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Brian Anderson lost at home for the first time in
1&AMP;frac12; years, and Alex Ochoa homered Monday as the Cincinnati Reds won
consecutive games for the first time in nearly a month, beating the
Arizona Diamondbacks 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Parris (4-11) won on the road for the first time since
April 16, striking out a season-high six in 6 2-3 innings. Parris,
who allowed one run and seven hits, had been 0-5 in seven road
starts since beating Los Angeles on April 16 at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Parris' 11 losses already are the most by a Reds' right-hander
since Jay Tibbs went 10-16 in 1985. Danny Graves, Cincinnati's
third pitcher, got three outs for his 13th save in 14 chances.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati had not won consecutive games since a three-game
sweep of Minnesota on June 2-4. The Reds are 9-1 at Arizona and
16-6 over the Diamondbacks overall.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson (8-3) lost at home for the first time in 20 starts
since Sept. 18, 1998, stopping a 12-game winning streak. He gave up
three runs and eight hits in 6 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Dante Bichette drove in Cincinnati's first run with a
first-inning sacrifice fly, and Benito Santiago had an RBI single
in the seventh, stopping an 0-for-9 skid.
</P>
<P>
   Ochoa, who had three hits and three RBIs Sunday in his first
start since May 26, hit a line drive into the left-field stands
with one out in the fifth, his fourth homer of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona got its run on RBI singles by Tony Womack in the
seventh, which chased Parris, and Greg Colbrunn in the ninth off
Danny Graves.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Arizona manager Buck Showalter is budgeting extra time in
the rotation , anticipating an All-star appearance for Randy
Johnson, scheduled for starts Tuesday and Sunday. ... The Reds
haven't had a complete game in 82 games this season. The previous
team record for consecutive games at the season's start without one
was set in 1997, when Dave Burba got one in their 81st game.

<HEADLINE> Gore Touts 'Real' Prescription Plan  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE GLOVER
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore courted senior citizens
and Hispanics Monday, touting his plan for a ''real,
comprehensive'' prescription drug benefit as a stark contrast to
the proposals of rival George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll put the power of medical science back in the medicine
cabinets of our mothers and fathers,'' Gore said of his Medicare
benefits plan. ''It's the right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, speaking in the suburb of Clayton at a town hall-style
meeting with senior citizens, also took on the big drug companies,
accusing them of ''price gouging.'' And he criticized the
Republicans' drug bill now pending in Congress, saying it was put
together by the drug companies and ''its only purpose is to serve
as an illusion or camouflage.''
</P>
<P>
   Accompanying the vice president was House Democratic leader Dick
Gephardt of St. Louis, who said the cost of drugs could be a
decisive matter in both the presidential election and the fight for
control of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a huge, huge issue to senior citizens,'' said Gephardt.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans have received more than $3 million from drug
manufacturers, while the Democrats have gotten just over $700,000,
Gore aides said campaign finance records showed.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal Gore has offered would provide a prescription drug
benefit under the Medicare program, with the government paying half
of the annual costs up to $5,000. Aides said it would extend
coverage to 40 million people at a cost of $255 billion over 10
years. Gore had explained details of the proposal earlier, but was
hammering hard at his plan in the battleground state of Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   He said many senior citizens have to choose between buying drugs
or going without other necessities. ''We just should not be putting
our seniors in that position,'' he said. ''It's just not right.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Gore flew to San Diego to pitch the proposal to the
National Council of La Raza, an important Hispanic group. Gore said
Hispanics would benefit under the plan.
</P>
<P>
   In remarks prepared for delivery, Gore said 2 million Hispanics
would gain because the number eligible for Medicare was expected to
triple over the next 25 years. Further, Hispanics are more than
twice as likely to lack supplemental coverage for prescription
drugs, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm committed to a real prescription drug benefit for all
Hispanics who rely on Medicare,'' Gore said. ''Not one that tells
them to go beg the HMOs and the insurance companies for help.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides said the vice president would focus on the prescription
drug proposal and health care throughout the week, including in
separate appearances before two big teachers' unions.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was addressing the National Council of La Raza on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Sen. Bob Graham, a Florida Democrat, made a
Gore-arranged conference call to reporters to criticize Bush for
offering minimal details about what he would provide in financing
for prescription drug aid to senior citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the American people deserve to have a clear statement
by Governor Bush as to what he would propose to do,'' said Graham,
sometimes mentioned as a vice presidential possibility for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign spokesman Dan Bartlett said Bush has been
consistent in proposing to allocate $5 trillion over five years to
both save and strengthen Social Security and Medicare, also
providing prescription drug benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans also said Gore, as vice president, should have
spoken up much earlier if he thought the issue was so important.
</P>
<P>
   ''After eight years of failing to propose a solution, the vice
president is calling for reform,'' said Missouri Rep. James Talent.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said his plan would cover far more people than a more
modest bill backed in Congress by Republicans. He also said his
plan is best because it includes coverage under Medicare, while
Republicans rely on insurance companies to provide the coverage.
</P>
<P>
   At the Missouri campaign stop, 72-year-old Jacqueline Steele
Johnson said she spends $423 of her monthly $870 income on
prescription drugs. She said she eats macaroni and cheese every
day.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also used his appearance for spirited criticism of big drug
makers, the second straight week he has taken on a large and
unpopular industry. Gore spent much of last week bashing big oil
companies over the soaring price of gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are price gouging and you are paying the bill,'' Gore
said of the drug makers. ''There's no other industry in America
that has profits nearly as high.''
</P>
<P>
   There was something of a vice presidential buzz surrounding
Gore's swing with Gephardt.
</P>
<P>
   ''We haven't talked about that,'' Gephardt said when questioned.
''As Harry Truman once said, I don't answer iffy questions.''

<HEADLINE> Twins Sign Pitcher Radke  </HEADLINE>
By JASON WOLF
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Brad Radke believes his new contract with the
Minnesota Twins signifies a new era for the team that has been
among baseball's worst in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Radke, 27, agreed on Monday to a new four-year contract worth a
reported $36 million and containing an opt-out clause after 2001
and a no-trade provision for the final three years.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is the richest in team history, with the right-hander's
annual salary of about $9 million surpassing Kirby Puckett's
highest salary of $7 million in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is just the beginning of good things to happen,'' Radke
said before the Twins played the Red Sox. ''This team has a lot of
potential.''
</P>
<P>
   The Twins have the lowest payroll in baseball this year, $16.5
million. They are in last place in the American League Central and
the last time they finished higher than fourth was in 1992, when
the Twins ended the season in second place.
</P>
<P>
   Still, optimism abounded in the Metrodome after Radke discussed
his new contract.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is one player we needed to keep,'' general manager Terry
Ryan said. ''It's our responsibility to move forward and improve
this franchise.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Tom Kelly, who sat in the dugout and watched reporters
and cameras surround Radke, said he felt cautiously optimistic
about the Twins' future.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a good building block for the Twins and the
organization,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Radke is 5-9 this season with a 3.95 ERA in 18 starts. His
career mark is 71-77 with a 4.26 ERA. His best season was in 1997,
when he went 20-10 with a 3.87 ERA and became one of three pitchers
in the last 50 years to win 12 straight decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Radke nor team officials would confirm the salary
amount, but they did confirm the contract would allow Radke to
demand a trade after 2001. Radke and his agent, Ron Simon, had been
insisting on such an opt-out provision.
</P>
<P>
   Radke, who would have been eligible for free agency after this
season, said he would carefully weigh his options after next season
before considering whether to demand a trade.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just want to see what happens after the first year and in
the offseason,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Radke also said the opt-out clause was one of the clinchers in
persuading him and Simon to agree to a deal, even though Simon cut
off negotiations with the Twins in February.
</P>
<P>
   ''They tried really hard to sign me and I'm just overwhelmed
with what I have,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan said he's confident Radke won't demand to be traded because
the pitcher has been loyal to the Twins, and Ryan is confident the
Twins are on a new path toward becoming a contender in a few years.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not something that I'm overly concerned about as long as
the organization continues to move forward,'' Ryan said. ''This was
just the first step.''
</P>
<P>
   Radke also credited Twins new CEO Chris Clouser, hired last
month for the newly created position.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan had been held back by owner Carl Pohlad's desire to keep
the payroll down. Ryan said he hadn't received any specifics about
whether the purse strings would be loosened, but said Radke's
signing was a good indicator.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know exactly where that payroll's going, but this
gives us hope,'' Ryan said.

<HEADLINE> 2 Judges Won't Hear Clinton Case  </HEADLINE>
By JAMES JEFFERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Two more judges said Monday they would
not hear the lawsuit seeking President Clinton's disbarment,
increasing the chance the case could fall to a recent appointee of
Republican Gov. Mike Huckabee, who has harshly criticized the
president's sexual misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   A total of three judges appointed by Clinton when he was
Arkansas governor have now declined to hear a state Supreme Court
committee's lawsuit to strip the president of his license to
practice law. The three judges all said they acted to avoid the
appearance of partiality.
</P>
<P>
   Of the four remaining circuit judges for Pulaski County, two
hear civil cases -- Judge Chris Piazza, who was assigned the case
Monday, and Judge Leon Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza, a Democrat and former local prosecutor, won election to
the bench in the early 1990s. Johnson was appointed by Huckabee on
June 2 to fill a vacancy through December.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza was out of his office on vacation Monday and could not be
located for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit alleges that deceptive answers Clinton gave under
oath in the Paula Jones sexual harassment case about his
relationship with Monica Lewinsky made him unfit to be a lawyer.
The president's lawyer, David Kendall, has said Clinton will fight
the case vigorously.
</P>
<P>
   Huckabee has been reserved through a string of Clinton
controversies, but the Baptist preacher reacted with indignation
when Clinton admitted to an affair with the former White House
intern.
</P>
<P>
   ''Either Bill Clinton lives under different rules than the rest
of us, or America has a different set of values than when it
reacted to Wilbur Mills, Bob Packwood, Gary Hart, Jim Bakker, Jimmy
Swaggart and others,'' Huckabee said at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Huckabee spokesman Rex Nelson said the governor did not have
Clinton or politics in mind when he appointed Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   It is unlikely the case will be resolved before Clinton leaves
office Jan. 20.

<HEADLINE> Former Comedian Sentenced for Rape  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- A former ''Star Search'' comedian accused in
a string of sexual assaults on college campuses in the Midwest was
sentenced Monday to 25 to 30 years in prison for one of the rapes.
</P>
<P>
   Vincent Horace Champ had pleaded no contest to the 1997 rape of
a University of Nebraska at Omaha faculty member.
</P>
<P>
   The sentence will be served after Champ, 38, completes a 40-year
term given to him last month for the rape of a student at Union
College, in Lincoln, in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Champ, a former comedian on the college circuit, still faces two
potential life sentences in Iowa on rape charges, and an attempted
assault charge stemming from an attack at Pasadena City College in
California.
</P>
<P>
   Similar attacks were reported at Knox College in Galesburg,
Ill.; Carthage College in Kenosha, Wis.; and Augustana College in
Rock Island, Ill. No charges have been brought in those cases.
</P>
<P>
   Champ used to open for entertainers such as Diana Ross, Sinbad
and Arsenio Hall. He also appeared on the syndicated TV talent show
''Star Search.''

<HEADLINE> 6 More Anti-Navy Activists Detained  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- U.S. marshals detained six more
anti-Navy activists Monday, bringing to 56 the number of Puerto
Rican protesters jailed for failing to post bail on trespassing
charges.
</P>
<P>
   The arrests included two mayoral candidates in November
elections, Hector Diaz of northern Arecibo and Charles Escobares of
the mountain town of Adjuntas, protest organizers said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the U.S. Marshals Service and the U.S. Attorney's
office did not return calls for comment Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The 56 are among 183 people arrested in recent days while trying
to enter a U.S. Navy bombing range on the island of Vieques in an
attempt to stop military exercises. They were released and given
until Friday to post $1,000 bail, but 122 have refused to pay.
</P>
<P>
   Since Friday, U.S. marshals have been arresting them at their
homes across the U.S. Caribbean territory.
</P>
<P>
   Resentment over the Navy's presence in Vieques flared in April
1999, when a U.S. Marine Corps jet dropped a bomb off target and
killed a civilian security guard in the bombing range.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters occupied the range for nearly a year, preventing
further exercises until authorities forcibly removed them on May 4.
In all, about 600 protesters have been detained on the island.

<HEADLINE> Jewish Memorial Defaced in Latvia  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIGA, Latvia (AP) -- Vandals painted swastikas and other
anti-Semitic graffiti Monday on the remains of a Riga synagogue
that had been burned down by the Nazis during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Police confirmed that the graffiti was discovered Monday, a day
before Latvia holds its nationwide Holocaust commemoration.
</P>
<P>
   On July 4, 1941, the Nazi army torched Riga's central synagogue,
burning to death dozens of Jews trapped inside. The stone remains
of the building, now overgrown with grass and weeds, were left
standing as a memorial.
</P>
<P>
   Police have no suspects.
</P>
<P>
   Latvia and its Baltic Sea neighbors, Estonia and Lithuania, were
overrun by the Soviet Union, then Nazi Germany during World War II,
and suffered mightily at the hands of both.
</P>
<P>
   After annexing the country in 1940, the Soviets deported
thousands of Latvians to Siberia, where many were shot. The Nazis
occupied Latvia from 1941 to 1944 and murdered nearly 80,000 Jews,
with Latvians as well as Germans taking part in the killings.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Army returned in 1945, deporting thousands more and
staying until the Baltic states won independence in 1991.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Ruler Discusses Democracy  </HEADLINE>
By AMIR ZIA
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- For the first time since seizing
power nine months ago, Pakistan's army ruler met the country's
disgraced politicians Monday to discuss a return to democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Pervez Musharraf met members of deposed prime minister
Nawaz Sharif's Pakistan Muslim League, as well as a dissident
faction.
</P>
<P>
   He also met Fazle-ur Rehman, who leads the ultraorthodox Jamiat
Ulema-e-Islam, a big supporter of the hardline Islamic Taliban
rulers in neighboring Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   There also were reports of a meeting between Musharraf and
members of ousted prime minister Benazir Bhutto's party.
</P>
<P>
   Raja Zafar-ul Haq, acting head of Sharif's party, said that
Musharraf -- the man who overthrew Sharif's elected government last
October -- has a plan to return the country to democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Haq, however, refused to give details of the plan, saying he
will take Musharraf's proposals to his party leadership to decide
whether they will participate.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate comment from Musharraf or other members
of his regime.
</P>
<P>
   Previously Musharraf said he would return Pakistan to democratic
rule in three years, in keeping with a ruling by the Supreme Court.
But before general elections are held, Musharraf said he wants to

Two Judges Won't Hear Clinton Case
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Two more judges said today they would not hear the
lawsuit seeking President Clinton's disbarment, increasing the chance the case
could fall to a recent appointee of Republican Gov. Mike Huckabee, who has
harshly criticized the president's sexual misconduct. A total of three judges
appointed by Clinton when he was Arkansas governor have now declined to hear a
state Supreme Court committee's lawsuit to strip the president of his license to
practice law. The three judges all said they acted to avoid the appearance of
partiality.

   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- President-elect Vicente Fox sought today to reassure a
country giddy, stunned and a bit fearful of what it had done -- elected an
opposition candidate for the first time in more than a century. ''We cannot fail
because we have awakened too many expectations, too many dreams and desires,''
Fox said in a broadcast on independent Radio Red. Fox stressed continuity,
saying he would meet with outgoing President Ernesto Zedillo to discuss the
unprecedented transition.

Poll: U.S. Voters Want Honesty
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- American voters are focusing ever more on honesty as the
most important trait for a presidential candidate, according to an Associated
Press poll. The voters are about evenly split on whether Al Gore or George W.
Bush is more honest. Four in 10 voters now pick honesty ahead of such traits as
caring about people like them, showing strong leadership, standing up for
beliefs and having a vision. In a November AP poll, one-third picked honesty,
which ranked first at that time as well. In the new poll, conducted for the AP
by ICR of Media, Pa., about a third picked Bush as most honest and a third
picked Gore. Another third said neither candidate or they didn't know.

Meatpackers Wage War on E. coli

   SCHUYLER, Neb. (AP) -- Summer is here, and so is E. coli. At this time of the
year as many as one of every four cattle being herded into Excel Corp.'s
slaughterhouse and others like it may harbor the deadly human pathogen. Before
this plant's meat reaches consumers, the cattle and their carcasses will be put
through a state-of-the-art system of scrubbing, washes, rinses and steam
pasteurization designed to remove or destroy the bacteria. But Excel food safety
chief Dell Allen said some tainted meet is still bound to reach consumers.
''It's like a roll of the dice or a game of Russian roulette,'' he said.

Tower on Edge of Historic Battlefield Destroyed

   GETTYSBURG, Pa. (AP) -- A 1970s steel observation tower that preservationists
say desecrated the hallowed ground of Gettysburg was demolished today on the
anniversary of the battle that saved the Union. The 393-foot tower was blown up
with 10 pounds of explosives as part of a National Park Service campaign to
remove modern structures and return the Gettysburg Battlefield to the way it
looked in 1863. The $2.5 million tower, erected on private land on the edge of
the national park, opened to tourists in 1974 over the objection of park
officials. Last month, a federal judge ruled the government could seize the
site. The government set aside $3 million to compensate the owners.

<HEADLINE> China 2, Canada 1  </HEADLINE>
By JOSEPH WHITE
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBORO, Mass. (AP) -- Qiu Haiyan, taking advantage of a moment
of confusion in front of the goal, scored in the 73rd minute Monday
night to give China a 2-1 victory over Canada in the third-place
game of the women's Gold Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Qiu got the fortuitous bounce after Pan Lina chipped a long ball
into the box. Canadian goalkeeper Nicole Wright was late coming off
the line, and the ball caromed among Wright and teammates Amy Wash
and Breanna Boyd before landing at Qiu's foot for the easy shot and
her second goal of the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Jin Yan scored in the 42nd minute for China. Charmaine Hooper
tied it with a penalty kick in the 59th minute as Canada gave the
World Cup runner-up a surprisingly stiff challenge for the third
time this year.
</P>
<P>
   The match effectively ended Canada's major tournament play for
the year, although the team showed impressive progress under new
coach Even Pellerud. Canada defeated China on penalty kicks after a
2-2 tie in the Pacific Cup in Australia last month and lost 3-2 to
China in Gold Cup group play last week.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadians didn't qualify for the Olympic Games, but they
will give the United States one of its final Sydney tuneups on Aug.
20 in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   The third-place finish for China reflects another disappointment
in its buildup to the Olympics. The Chinese finished third in the
Algarve Cup in Portugal in March and second in the Pacific Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Shui Qingxia, filling the playmaker's role in place of injured
midfielder Sun Wen, set up China's first goal with a nice feed to
Jin on the left side. Wright was unable to cut off the angle, and
Jin outraced a defender and left-footed the ball into the net for
her fourth goal of the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Hooper tied the game after she was tripped in the box by Bae
Jie. Hooper then converted the spot kick, her sixth goal of the
tournament.

<HEADLINE> Lazio starts his second 'Mainstream Express' bus tour  </HEADLINE>
By FRANK ELTMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   YONKERS, N.Y. (AP) - On the road, again.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Senate candidate Rick Lazio fired up his second
''Mainstream Express'' statewide bus tour on Monday, visiting a
health care facility on Long Island before heading to rallies in
Yonkers and Schenectady.
</P>
<P>
   The congressman wasted no time in launching into an attack on
rival Hillary Rodham Clinton, referring to himself as a ''leader in
the House'' on cancer legislation while calling his opponent's
''one foray into policy on health care ... an unmitigated
disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he was trying to steal one of Clinton's favorite
issues - health care - Lazio said he has a record of
accomplishments, while his opponent's record is dismal. ''I mean
you can say anything you want on the campaign trail,'' Lazio said.
''You've got to look at what people have done.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ''Compare what Mrs. Clinton did when she had the
opportunity, which was to create a monstrosity that would have
limited choices, and would have undermined our ability to deliver
quality health care, and what I have been doing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton campaign fired back: ''Carefully staged photo ops
won't change the fact that Rick Lazio has committed legislative
malpractice,'' said spokesman Howard Wolfson.
</P>
<P>
   He said Lazio ''voted against a real patient's bill of rights,
against a prescription drug plan that will cover all seniors, and
voted to cut Medicare by $270 billion.''
</P>
<P>
   Before departing from his home turf on Long Island, Lazio, the
chairman of the House's ''Cancer Awareness Working Group,'' called
for a ''comprehensive strategy on all cancers, including breast
cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   He called on President Clinton to sign the ''Breast and Cervical
Cancer Treatment Act,'' which would provide treatment to low-income
patients.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio stayed on the health care theme later Monday, visiting
Good Samaritan Hospital in Suffern.
</P>
<P>
   The tour, featuring a pair of luxury buses with out-of-state
license plates, is Lazio's second since receiving the state
Republican party nomination for the Senate in late May. Lazio
entered the race on May 20 after New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
dropped out as the GOP candidate, citing his battle with prostate
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The five-day tour winds through the Adirondacks, then south to
Syracuse and west to Buffalo before ending Friday afternoon in
Rochester. The Long Island congressman, who is seeking to raise his
visibility in upstate New York, was traveling with his wife, Pat,
and two young daughters, Molly and Kelsey.
</P>
<P>
   At a rally attended by about 100 people in a Yonkers park, Lazio
repeated one of the mantras of his six-week-old campaign: Clinton
is the outsider and he's the ''real New Yorker.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't need an exploratory committee to find ... (your city
here; in this case Yonkers),'' he said moments before a disc jockey
fired up Ray Charles' version of ''What'd I Say?'' including the
line:
</P>
<P>
   ''Tell your momma, tell your pa, gonna ship you back to
Arkansas.''
</P>
<P>
   A small turnout also greeted Lazio for a rally in a Schenectady
park early Monday night. Lazio repeated the exploratory committee
line for the benefit of the locals and pressed his criticism of
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''If this race is based on character, honesty and integrity, I
think we win this race handily,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio plans to spend Tuesday marching in three July Fourth
parades in the northern New York towns of Argyle in Washington
County, and Ticonderoga and Lake Placid, both in Essex County. He
also will participate in a ''Salute to Korean War Veterans''
breakfast in Saratoga Springs.

<HEADLINE> PGA Wants Review of Martin Case  </HEADLINE>
By DOUG FERGUSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   With opposite opinions from two federal appeals courts on
whether walking is an integral part of championship golf, the PGA
Tour said Monday it would ask the U.S. Supreme Court to review the
decision that allows Casey Martin to ride in a cart.
</P>
<P>
   The tour said it would file its motion Wednesday, the deadline
imposed by the Supreme Court. The court probably will not decide
until late October whether to take up the case.
</P>
<P>
   ''This case is not about Casey Martin, but rather the PGA Tour's
ability to set and implement the rules of its competition,'' the
tour said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman Bob Combs said there would be no further comment.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, who has a rare circulatory disease in his right leg, is
playing the Western Open outside Chicago this week.
</P>
<P>
   ''I knew about this two months ago,'' Martin told SportsLine.com
on Monday. ''My lawyer told me (the tour) did everything they had
to do (to file the motion).
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously, I'm disappointed. You just kind of roll with it. I
can't kick and scream. I hoped my performance would be a good thing
out there rather (than having the tour) fight me. I think it's
pretty obvious that I'm not at any advantage, and I hoped they'd
let it go.''
</P>
<P>
   His father said he was disappointed but not surprised by the
tour's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''I never expected differently,'' King Martin said.
''(Commissioner) Tim Finchem told me from Day One that he would
accommodate Casey all the way through the appeals process, which is
a nice way of saying they're going all the way through with this.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin successfully sued the PGA Tour in 1998 for a right to
ride a cart, and became the first player to ride in the U.S. Open
and on the PGA Tour. He earned his tour card in October by
finishing in the top 15 on the Nike Tour.
</P>
<P>
   In March, the 9th Circuit Court in San Francisco unanimously
upheld the Oregon court's decision.
</P>
<P>
   One day later, the 7th Circuit Court in Chicago upheld a lower
court ruling that denied a cart to Indiana club pro Ford Olinger.
</P>
<P>
   Olinger had sued the USGA for a cart in U.S. Open qualifying
because of a degenerative hip disease. He was allowed a walker --
called a Lunar Swedish Rollator -- to relieve pressure on his back,
but shot a 90 in the first stage of qualifying in May and failed to
advance.
</P>
<P>
   Both lawsuits were based on the Americans with Disabilities Act.
The tour said it expects Olinger to ask the Supreme Court to review
his case, too.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe the prospects of the Supreme Court agreeing to
clarify the law on this issue are increased if requests to review
both the Olinger and Martin decisions are before the court,'' the
tour said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a federal court in Austin, Texas, last month ruled
against the USGA and ordered that JaRo Jones, a 53-year-old club
pro who has post-polio syndrome and neuromuscular atrophy, be
allowed a cart in U.S. Senior Open qualifying.
</P>
<P>
   He had an 84 and failed to qualify.
</P>
<P>
   As it relates to the Martin case, the tour said a standard
imposed by the 9th circuit was impossible to administer and not
required under the ADA. The court said the tour should determine
the difference in fatigue between disabled players who ride and
able-bodied players who walk.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, who played at Stanford with Tiger Woods and Notah Begay,
has struggled in his rookie season on tour. He has made the cut in
only eight of 15 tournaments, and his only finish in the top 30 was
a tie for 17th in the Tucson Open, the same week the top players
were competing in the Match Play Championship.
</P>
<P>
   He is 161st on the money list, and must finish the year in the
125 to keep his card -- or the top 150 to avoid returning to the
six-round Qualifying School.
</P>
<P>
   If the Supreme Court agrees to review the case, a decision is
not expected until next summer.

<HEADLINE> Amateur historians say Thomas Jefferson kin buried in Orange County </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TUXEDO, N.Y. (AP) - A town will hire another historian to
research whether the child of Thomas Jefferson and his slave
mistress rests in a local cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   The new historian is needed after a bizarre news conference over
the weekend in which the hired researcher apparently disappeared in
the middle of the event billed to release evidence of the
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Roger A. King, of Monroe was hired to study the cemetery for the
town last summer. King has said that the cemetery in Southfields
contains the grave of a son of founding father Jefferson and Sally
Hemings, his slave mistress.
</P>
<P>
   But when a group of reporters and officials gathered at the
cemetery Saturday so King could reveal the missing half of a
tombstone said to link Jefferson and Hemings, King was nowhere to
be found.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm very concerned that this whole thing is a fake,'' said
Christian Sonne, the town's historian, who was only informed of the
find last Thursday by a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have no physical evidence. I'm going to do everything to get
an independent expert on this case,'' he told the Middletown Times
Herald-Record.
</P>
<P>
   Town Supervisor Kenneth Magar said that additional research
needs to be done on the cemetery, which contains the ancestors of
many local families, to satisfy the community.
</P>
<P>
   ''The town needs a second opinion, a view from a different
angle,'' said Magar. ''Before the town gets too involved, we need
to make sure the information is completely accurate.''
</P>
<P>
   King was outraged over reports that he left Saturday's press
conference before presenting crucial evidence: a tombstone that
reads, ''Thomas Jefferson ... son of Thomas Jefferson and Sally
Heming.'' (sic)
</P>
<P>
   ''I did not disappear,'' said King. ''I am very, very upset
about what was put in the paper.''
</P>
<P>
   After briefing a crowd of some 30 residents, local officials and
members of the press, for about 45 minutes, King was nowhere to be
found.
</P>
<P>
   According to King, he was being interviewed by a reporter for an
hour and a half, and then headed over to the nearby cemetery, which
he says was empty. King says he spent the remainder of the day
swimming.
</P>
<P>
   The reporter King referred to was unidentified.
</P>
<P>
   No one at the restaurant remembers seeing King after his speech,
nor do they remember seeing a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   However, one restaurant employee said King left shortly after
the crowd headed to the nearby cemetery, where the tombstone is
said to lie. Some returned to the restaurant in search of King, but
none recall seeing him. The press and local officials were left
waiting at the cemetery until well after 3 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   King's absence triggered speculation among some that he may have
the stone in his possession. But King said, ''No stone has been
taken away from the cemetery, and there is nothing that has been
tampered with.''
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, he could not be reached for comment on his criminal
record.
</P>
<P>
   In November, a DNA study concluded that a ''Jefferson male'' -
not necessarily Thomas - was the father of Eston Hemings, the
slave's youngest son. In January, the Thomas Jefferson Memorial
Foundation acknowledged that Jefferson is the likely father of one,
if not all six, of Hemings' children.

<HEADLINE> Guatemala Civil War Victims Found  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) -- Investigators uncovered the bodies of 12
Indian peasants killed during Guatemala's 36-year civil war, in the
seventh excavation this year of clandestine cemeteries in the
highlands of western Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's find brought to 65 the number of victims pulled from
hidden graves this year in the mountainous Guatemalan state of
Quiche.
</P>
<P>
   The cemetery, in the village of Carrigal about 100 miles
northwest of Guatemala City, contained the remains of nine men and
three woman, said Jose Suasnauar, a spokesman for the Forensic
Anthropological Foundation of Guatemala, which conducted the
excavation.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation received witness accounts telling them where to
dig from the Guatemala City-based human rights group Coordination
of Guatemalan Widows.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have so much information about the area that we can't use
it all, even now when we are doing an excavation a month,''
Suasnauar said.
</P>
<P>
   Suasnauar said the bodies belonged to adults between 20 and 55.
They were shot dead between 1980 and 1984 with the kinds of weapons
carried by Guatemalan soldiers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Guatemala's civil war, which pitted leftist Indian guerrillas
against hard-line state forces, began in 1960 and ended with
December 1996 peace accords -- but not before some 200,000 people --
mostly Indian peasants -- had been killed.

<HEADLINE> Mexico City Awakes To Changing Guard  </HEADLINE>
By MEGAN K. STACK
<TEXT>
<P>
   NUEVO LAREDO, Mexico (AP) -- Cesar Taboada Ortega couldn't stop
smiling Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   In gleaming shoes and thick spectacles, the retired government
stenographer peddled defunct Mexican currency a few blocks from the
U.S. bridge.
</P>
<P>
   ''The past was one history,'' said Taboada, 70. ''Today another
history begins.''
</P>
<P>
   Vicente Fox, a presidential candidate for the opposition
National Action Party (PAN), did something Sunday that long seemed
impossible: He defeated the ruling party. After 71 years of
unbroken presidential authority, the Institutional Revolutionary
Party lost the national elections.
</P>
<P>
   ''Fox wins!'' proclaimed banner headlines on the border. The
chatter of talk radio poured to the sidewalks from open car
windows. On city benches and stoops, workers passed newspapers from
hand to hand.
</P>
<P>
   As Nuevo Laredo creaked to life Monday morning, everything was
different, and everybody knew it.
</P>
<P>
   The scenery hadn't changed much: Water still exploded from
fountains; the drivers on the bridge honked and hollered; shoppers
gnawed on wads of gum and heckled over pottery in the cool stone
markets.
</P>
<P>
   It takes a lot to make a ripple in a border city marked by
constant movement.
</P>
<P>
   Still, optimism and curiosity ran high in Nuevo Laredo, a city
that has traditionally thrown its support to the ruling party.
</P>
<P>
   Even Jesus Lopez, a staunch PRI supporter who sells cowboy hats
to U.S. tourists, offered a begrudging grin at word of the election
results.
</P>
<P>
   ''Look, I voted for (PRI candidate Francisco) Labastida, and
they defeated us,'' he said, crouching beside his booth, a
newspaper spread before him. ''But who knows? Maybe change will be
a good thing. Maybe the violence and the corruption will get
better.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Of course things will,'' interrupted Maria Perez, 63, a San
Luis Potosi native who moved to Laredo four years ago. ''After 71
years of people dying of hunger, you should be celebrating.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody in Nuevo Laredo questions the need for public policy
revision: In a city spilling over with migrants who've left their
homes in search of work in northern factories, or who await a
chance to cross the border into the United States, the desire for
reform has long been thick.
</P>
<P>
   ''I came here because there are no resources at home,'' said
Fernando Flores Belmont, a 24-year-old mechanic who drifted north
from Mexico City in search of work. ''Here, there's a little bit
more -- just a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Flores dallied beneath the ebonies in Nuevo Laredo's downtown
plaza Monday morning, perusing the newspaper headlines.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's always the PRI, always,'' he said. ''I never thought this
could happen.''
</P>
<P>
   And as the streets grew hotter, a sliver of uncertainty edged
the air.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can't just change everything at eight o'clock in the
morning,'' said pharmacist Victor Vela. ''I hope the new government
knows what it's doing.''

<HEADLINE> Martinez May Be Ready for All-Stars  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Pedro Martinez may be able to pitch in next
week's All-Star game.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, eligible to come off the disabled list during the
All-Star break, said he's on track to pitch next week. Martinez and
Toronto's David Wells are the most likely pitchers to start for the
American League on July 11 at Atlanta's Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I'm eligible to come off, I'll be ready to pitch,'' he
said Monday before the Boston Red Sox played the Minnesota Twins.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez is 9-3 with a 1.44 ERA for the Red Sox with 140
strikeouts in 106 innings. He went on the disabled list June 29
with a strained oblique muscle on his left side.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sure we'll do the proper thing for me and the team,''
Martinez said, adding that he wouldn't pitch at Atlanta unless the
Red Sox give him permission.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez was the winner and MVP in last year's All-Star game at
Boston's Fenway Park, striking out five in two hitless innings in
the AL's 4-1 win.

<HEADLINE> Iowa Gov. Offers Gas Price Plan  </HEADLINE>
By KEN THOMAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Besieged with howls of protest over
sky-high gas prices, Gov. Tom Vilsack on Monday suggested
reimbursing Iowa drivers $10 each for their purchases of
ethanol-blended gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   Vilsack proposed reimbursing drivers for the 19-cents-a-gallon
tax on 53 gallons of ethanol-blended fuel, also known as gasohol.
It would cost the state an estimated $14 million.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a way of tailoring and targeting the relief to Iowans
and at the same time promoting Iowa's product -- ethanol -- and
renewable fuels, which we think, in the long-run, is the way we
avoid being held hostage by high gas prices in the future,''
Vilsack said.
</P>
<P>
   If approved by state lawmakers, $10 reimbursement coupons could
be sent to consumers this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Parts of the Midwest, including Iowa, have battled soaring
gasoline prices in recent months. On Monday, the average cost of a
gallon of regular unleaded was $1.73, up from $1.54 a month ago and
$1.07 a year ago, according to the American Automobile Association.
</P>
<P>
   Illinois legislators voted last week to suspend the sales tax on
gas for six months. Indiana Gov. Frank O'Bannon suspended his
state's gas tax for 60 days and asked station owners to pass the
savings on to customers.
</P>
<P>
   Vilsack, a Democrat, met with lawmakers last week to try to
forge a plan to help Iowa consumers. Both sides agreed that
something must be done, but said they needed more time to develop a
solution.
</P>
<P>
   In seeking a plan for Iowa, some have suggested a two-month
suspension of the gas tax, a move that would pare $65 million to
$100 million from the state's road-use fund.
</P>
<P>
   However, leaders of the Republican-controlled Legislature worry
about the possible harm to the state's highway maintenance efforts.
They have countered with a plan to suspend the tax on
ethanol-blended fuels, about 40 percent of the market.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP plan would call for the state to make up for the lost
gas taxes by using the state's budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's plan would be funded with $14 million from the
state's road-use tax fund. Vilsack said he plans to discuss the
proposal with legislative leaders on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Truce Proposals in Colombia  </HEADLINE>
By CESAR GARCIA
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN VICENTE DEL CAGUAN, Colombia (AP) -- Colombia's largest rebel
group denounced a government ''defamation'' campaign Monday even as
the two sides exchanged proposals for a truce in a 36-year
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The leftist Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia said it was
tired of officials labeling the group as ''bandits'' and
''terrorists'' while the government pledges sincerity about peace.
</P>
<P>
   ''The persistent defamation campaign by officials against the
FARC must end if we are to achieve positive results at the
negotiating table,'' said an angry statement read by FARC
negotiator Raul Reyes in the village of Los Pozos.
</P>
<P>
   Reyes claimed the government tried to discredit the group at a
rebel-hosted conference in Los Pozos last week -- in part by urging
delegates from 21 countries to criticize Revolutionary Armed Forces
kidnappings and ties to the drug trade.
</P>
<P>
   He lashed out in particular at top military officials and
presidential peace envoy Camilo Gomez, saying Gomez was acting like
a ''troublemaker.''
</P>
<P>
   The rebel group's statement, and the meager results of Monday's
cease-fire exchange, did little to raise hopes of peace in the
strife-torn South American nation. Negotiations begun 18 months ago
are moving slowly.
</P>
<P>
   Emerging from a six-hour meeting in Los Pozos, the sides pledged
only to carefully study the truce offers -- contained in sealed
envelopes and kept secret from the public.
</P>
<P>
   Acts of peace will occur only ''when the negotiations advance,''
said a joint rebel-government statement.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions have been on the rise since U.S. lawmakers approved
$1.3 billion in aid last week, mostly to train and supply Colombian
troops who are set to confront rebels protecting wide swathes of
drug-producing regions.
</P>
<P>
   They apparently flared further at last week's conference on
illegal drug crops, at which the rebel group took unexpected
criticism from its mostly European guests.
</P>
<P>
   Rebel and government negotiators said Monday they would keep the
cease-fire proposals under wraps for now. But some of the likely
differences have surfaced.
</P>
<P>
   FARC commander Alfonso Cano said the rebel proposal would impose
short-term cease-fires in well-defined regions and no international
monitors. ''This is an internal affair,'' Cano said.
</P>
<P>
   A Colombian lawmaker disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''A cease-fire needs a mechanism of verification and hopefully
this would be linked to the international community,'' Nancy
Patricia Gutierrez, president of the House of Representatives, told
RCN radio.
</P>
<P>
   Gomez, the presidential envoy, said the government proposal
called for a cease-fire and an end to rebel kidnappings and attacks
against civilians.
</P>
<P>
   FARC leaders have said they would consider halting kidnappings
as a means of raising funds only if the government financed the
rebel group. They also doubt the government would be able to
control right-wing paramilitary squads that could scuttle any peace
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign governments -- who are being asked to fund development
projects to support the peace process -- are demanding both sides
cut back on atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   ''The most important thing now is to stop the senseless killing
of civilians, to stop the massacres and stop the kidnappings and
then go toward a more wide-ranging cease-fire agreement,'' U.N.
peace envoy for Colombia, Jan Egeland of Norway, told The
Associated Press last week.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 3,000 people are killed annually in the 36-year
conflict, the majority villagers accused by rebels or rival
paramilitary groups of supporting the opposing side.

<P>
   OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- Getting a birthday gift for the world's
oldest man isn't an easy task.
</P>
<P>
   ''What does a 111-year-old man need that he doesn't already
have?'' asked the man's daughter, Leona Ford.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Holcomb, recognized by the Guinness Book of Records as the
world's oldest man, celebrated his 111th birthday Monday with an
outdoor cookout and a wheelchair parade in his honor at the
Carnegie Nursing Home. Nearly 250 people were on hand.
</P>
<P>
   Holcomb played basketball and won prizes in the ring toss at a
little carnival held in his honor. Earlier in the day, nursing home
residents wheeled through the halls of the nursing home and into
the rooms of all the people who couldn't go outside to watch, Ford
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The wheelchairs were decorated to the hilt,'' Ford said.
</P>
<P>
   Holcomb was born in Brown County, Kan., in 1889. When people ask
him how he has lived so long, Ford, the youngest of Holcomb's five
children, said he tells them one thing: ''He says you live one day
at a time the best you can.''
</P>
<P>
   Holcomb has five children, nine grandchildren, 14
great-grandchildren and nine great-great-grandchildren. Up until in
his late 90s, he farmed hundreds of acres of land.

   ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Texas manager Johnny Oates was ejected
from Monday night's game against Oakland after a heated argument
with plate umpire Tony Randazzo.
</P>
<P>
   Oates came onto the field in the fourth inning after Rangers
catcher Ivan Rodriguez had some words with Randazzo, apparently
over balls and strikes. Oates stepped in, the argument quickly got
heated and Oates was ejected from a game for the first time this
season.
</P>
<P>
   As Oates argued with Randazzo, Rodriguez started talking with
first base umpire Ed Montague, the crew chief. But the AL MVP
remained in the game.
</P>
<P>
   The count was 3-0 on Eric Chavez when Oates was thrown out. The
next pitch was a called strike, but Rick Helling then walked
Chavez, his fourth walk in 3 1-3 innings.

<HEADLINE> Damage Assessment Begins at Hanford  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RICHLAND, Wash. (AP) -- As workers began evaluating damage from
last week's fire at the Hanford nuclear reservation, aerial photos
showed the blaze ''came awfully darn close'' to several nuclear
facilities, a spokesman for the complex said.
</P>
<P>
   Flames came within 1,000 feet of a shuttered reactor and within
a half mile of buried high-level radioactive and chemical wastes,
spokesman Mike Talbot said Monday. But no nuclear or chemical waste
storage facilities were damaged by the 191,000-acre fire, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a vegetation control program,'' Talbot said. ''There
was nothing there to burn.''
</P>
<P>
   A highway and chemical retardant dropped from airplanes stopped
the fire's advance about a quarter-mile from some uranium waste
barrels stored in a field.
</P>
<P>
   Flames raced across a uranium waste storage site and two
dried-up waste ponds. But tests indicate there were no radiation
releases, the state Department of Health has said.
</P>
<P>
   The fire, in grass and sagebrush, destroyed some metal
structures on part of the reservation where most human activities
have been barred for decades, Talbot said. A security checkpoint
station also was damaged.
</P>
<P>
   ''Other than that, we came through it OK,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Talbot said it will take some time before damage estimates are
available.
</P>
<P>
   The blaze destroyed 20 homes and scores of other buildings just
south of Hanford. At its peak late Wednesday, about 7,000 people
were evacuated.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Hanford's more than 12,000 workers returned to their
jobs Monday, although staffing was lower than normal because of the
Independence Day holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Hanford was created during World War II as part of the Manhattan
Project to build the atomic bomb. It made plutonium for decades,
generating the nation's biggest volume of radioactive waste. Its
primary mission now is cleaning up that waste.

	   UTICA, N.Y. (AP) - The mayor of Utica who has been fighting
allegations of sexual harassment by two former and two current male
city employees announced his resignation late Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am not quitting,'' longtime Mayor Edward A. Hanna said in a
written statement. ''But I am forced because of my serious heart
condition along with my age, the execution of and stress in the
regular routine as mayor, regretfully it is strictly a health
decision to bring my work as mayor to a close, effective midnight,
July 3.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanna, 78, a Republican self-made millionaire who funds his own
campaigns, has never minced words in his often-stormy political
career. Two years ago he referred to his own city council as a
''childish collection of mindless babblers who act without any
coherent or cogent vision for this city.''
</P>
<P>
   ''As some already know, I have had chest pains which have
occurred more frequently during the past months,'' Hanna said.
</P>
<P>
   The sexual harassment allegations were contained in sworn
notices of claim served in June against Hanna and the city of
Utica.
</P>
<P>
   In the notices of claim, the four claimants allege their
employment was tied to their responses to the mayor's advances.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would hope to be remembered as a mayor who had eyes that
could see what needed to be done and a heart that cared,'' Hanna
said.
</P>
<P>
   Timothy Julian, common council president, will assume mayoral
duties.

<HEADLINE> Mexico President Stresses Continuity  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN RICE
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- President-elect Vicente Fox sought Monday to
reassure a country giddy, stunned and a bit fearful of what it had
done -- elected an opposition candidate for the first time in more
than a century.
</P>
<P>
   ''We cannot fail because we have awakened too many expectations,
too many dreams and desires,'' Fox said in a broadcast Monday on
independent Radio Red.
</P>
<P>
   Fox stressed continuity, saying he would meet with outgoing
President Ernesto Zedillo to discuss the unprecedented transition.
Still, the impact of his victory in Sunday's election will be felt
throughout Mexican society, which is woven with groups tied to the
defeated Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with The Associated Press, Fox said he would
form ''a very transparent, accountable government. We will have
moral authority and democratic legitimacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, he met with Zedillo at the presidential residence and
said they agreed to work together for a peaceful and orderly
transition and to formulate together the budget proposal that
Zedillo must send to Congress before Fox takes office.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have some clear ideas about next year's budget but on the
other hand, there is a need to take advantage of the government's
experience,'' Fox said.
</P>
<P>
   During his campaign, Fox portrayed himself both as a brash,
tough-talking cowboy and as a former businessman and
consensus-seeking governor. On Monday, the cowboy gave way to the
statesman, hoping to avoid the instability that has marred recent
Mexican presidential handovers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We awake to a different situation, with complete stability...
the country is going ahead normally,'' said Fox, who also had kind
words for both Zedillo and the defeated ruling party candidate,
Francisco Labastida.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, who begins his six-year term on Dec. 1, said he would
choose his Cabinet secretaries over the coming two months and would
include people from a variety of parties and geographic regions, as
well as women.
</P>
<P>
   Investors appeared to be pleased: Mexico's stock market closed
up 6.1 percent and the Mexican peso rose sharply against the
dollar.
</P>
<P>
   The election was so stunning that Mexicans may not know what to
expect. No one alive has seen a peaceful transfer of power between
parties in Mexico: The PRI had governed since 1929, and before
that, Mexicans endured a long series of rigged or violent changes
of power by earlier regimes.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI was often confused with Mexico itself, especially in
rural areas, in part because it had a political monopoly on the
colors of the flag and in part because for a long time there was no
difference between the government and party.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's National Action Party, founded in 1939, was considered a
fringe party of the Catholic middle classes for its first
half-century, electing its first governor only in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   But with 93 percent of the vote counted from Sunday's election,
Fox had 42.7 percent, Labastida of the PRI had 35.8 percent and
Cuauhtemoc Cardenas of the Democratic Revolution Party 16.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton called to congratulate Fox and issued a
statement calling the elections a '' vivid testimony to the depth
of the democratic commitment of the Mexican people.''
</P>
<P>
   Former U.S. Secretary of State James Baker, an election
observer, called it ''a truly historic sea change in the politics
of Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It can't mean anything but good in terms of U.S. interests,''
Baker said in an interview. ''The United States is interested in
promoting democracy around the world and this is the first peaceful
transfer of power at the ballot box, in a closely contested
election, in 71 years.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the presidency, National Action won a
near-majority in the Senate and the largest delegation in the lower
house of Congress, though only slightly ahead of the PRI. National
Action also wrested the governorship of Morelos state away from PRI
and kept its hold on Fox's Guanajuato state. Democratic Revolution
won the mayor's race in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico was a largely rural society when the PRI was founded. The
country's transformation to a nation of cities and industries has
undermined the party's hold on a population that once depended on
it for aid to make it from crop to crop, for favors in settling
land disputes.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI's dependence on the rural vote was never clearer: After
mayors elected in several states take office, the one-time
all-ruling party will not control any of Mexico's 12 largest
cities. Ten of those will be held by National Action.
</P>
<P>
   The defeat of the PRI will mean wrenching changes throughout
Mexican society -- and in Mexicans' view of their country.
</P>
<P>
   Labor unions that for 65 years have been subservient to the
government are suddenly independent. Farmers can no longer go to
the PRI to solve their problems. An army of bureaucrats can no
longer migrate between the PRI's massive headquarters in Mexico
City and federal and state bureaucracies nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest shock may be in rural areas where the identification
between the PRI and power was closest -- where Indian towns suffered
''centuries of brutal, colonial, undemocratic authoritarianism''
followed by decades of paternalism under the PRI, historian Lorenzo
Meyer said in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have no experience in being citizens,'' Meyer said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are some Mexicans... the most authentic Mexicans, who
will have to see the body'' of the PRI before breaking free, Meyer
said. ''It is almost like the Russians had to see the body of
Stalin.''

   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- An all-Fijian temporary government was sworn
in Tuesday in defiance of hostage takers who are holding 27 members
of the ousted, Indian-led government at gunpoint in parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Banking executive Laisenia Qarase became prime minister in an
appointment that provoked the anger of the hostage takers who had
demanded a role in naming any new government.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech after being sworn in, Qarase said he accepted the
job as prime minister as a ''call for national unity.'' He urged
the gunmen to release the hostages immediately so Fiji can begin
rebuilding its shattered economy.
</P>
<P>
   Qarase said his government will give priority to protecting
indigenous Fijian rights, but that ''no communities will be
excluded ... in our multiracial and multicultural society.''
</P>
<P>
   ''All communities have a cherished and valued place in our
country,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in traditional Sulu skirts, 19 indigenous Fijian men
swore to ''be faithful and bear true allegiance to the Republic of
the Fijian Islands'' during a ceremony Tuesday at military
headquarters in the capital, Suva.
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony could not be held at parliament because that is
where rebels led by former insurance executive George Speight have
been holding the ousted government hostage for more than six weeks
in what they call a battle for indigenous Fijian rights.
</P>
<P>
   Defying the hostage takers, the country's military leader on
Monday named the temporary civilian government but said he will
retain power until the captives are freed.
</P>
<P>
   Commodore Frank Bainimarama -- who assumed power 10 days after
rebels stormed parliament on May 19 and took the government hostage
-- appointed the interim leaders without input from the gunmen, who
had demanded a role.
</P>
<P>
   Speight said Monday the army may pay a high price for
''completely ignoring'' him.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a very big possibility of making a lot of people
really upset,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, no members of the Indian minority are in the new
government. ''We approached two very well-qualified members of the
Indian community, but they declined,'' Bainimarama said.
</P>
<P>
   After Speight's raid on parliament, the army gave in to most of
his demands to disenfranchise Fiji's ethnic Indians, including
firing Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry -- a hostage and the first
Fijian of Indian ancestry to lead the country. The army also threw
out the 1997 multiracial constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Indians were brought to Fiji over a century ago by English
colonialists seeking indentured laborers for rich sugar cane
fields. Today, they make up about 44 percent of Fiji's population,
while indigenous Fijians account for about 51 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Many Fijians were angered by Chaudhry's refusal to raise rents
charged to Indian sugar cane farmers on land communally owned by
indigenous people.
</P>
<P>
   Bainimarama said he will remain head of state until all the
hostages are safely released, the gunmen turn over their weapons,
and public order is restored.
</P>
<P>
   Bainimarama said the interim government will rule for 18 months
and set guidelines for a new constitution. The old one ''will not
be reinstated,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The new government should work for Fiji's poor indigenous
majority, and for ''the protection of the rights of Indians and
other communities that are an integral part of our nation,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The military has cordoned off the parliamentary compound where
the hostages are being held, and army spokesman Lt. Alipate
Mataitini said the military will tighten its cordon.
</P>
<P>
   Bainimarama said the hostage crisis has cost Fiji 5,000 jobs,
$96 million in lost exports, $96 million in lost revenues and
untold losses in talent by people who have fled the country.
</P>
<P>
   Qarase, the new prime minister, is known more as a manager than
a politician. He has been head of the Merchant Bank Fiji and is a
former director of the Fiji Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Speight has spoken positively of him, but Qarase was not his
first choice for prime minister.

<HEADLINE> Chavez Raises Minimum Wage 20 Perc.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- President Hugo Chavez increased the
minimum wage for Venezuelan workers in the private sector by 20
percent to $210 a week.
</P>
<P>
   The increase, approved by presidential decree on Monday, equals
the minimum pay approved for state workers in May.
</P>
<P>
   The increase is expected to benefit nearly 40 percent of workers
in Venezuela, where more than 7 million workers work for private
businesses, according to the country's largest workers group, the
Confederation of Venezuelan Workers.
</P>
<P>
   The decree, signed weeks ahead of July 30 presidential
elections, also calls for a 60-day firing freeze, effective
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   The decision came after weeks of negotiations between
government, union, and business leaders, who reached an initial
agreement on Thursday, but failed to resolve the nagging issue of a
firing freeze.
</P>
<P>
   Although Venezuela is the third-largest oil exporter in the
world, more than half the country lives in poverty. The official
unemployment rate is 15 percent, though private economists put the
rate at closer to 20 percent.

<HEADLINE> Tigers 5, Devil Rays 4, 10 Innings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Damion Easley hit a solo homer in
the 10th inning Monday night as the Detroit Tigers extended their
winning streak to four by beating the Tampa Bay Devil Rays 5-4.
</P>
<P>
   Easley hit a 440-foot drive onto the roof of a restaurant in
center field with two outs off Roberto Hernandez (2-3).
</P>
<P>
   Danny Patterson (3-1) worked out of a two-on, one-out jam in the
ninth. Todd Jones got the three outs for his AL-leading 24th save
in 25 chances, striking out the side after allowing a runner to
reach second.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit played without sluggers Juan Gonzalez (sore left foot)
and Tony Clark (back spasms). Manager Phil Garner said both are day
to day.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay third baseman Vinny Castilla (lower back inflammation)
returned after missing 17 games and went 0-for-5. Devil Rays left
fielder Greg Vaughn (right hamstring strain) is expected to be
activated from the DL on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Rich Becker's sacrifice fly put the Tigers up 1-0 in the third.
Bubba Trammell's two-run double gave Tampa Bay the lead in the
bottom half.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit went back ahead 3-2 in the fourth on Deivi Cruz's
two-run double. The Devil Rays countered again in the bottom half
when Mike DiFelice hit a two-run homer.
</P>
<P>
   DiFelice has seven hits in his last 13 at-bats, including three
homers.
</P>
<P>
   Dean Palmer drew the Tigers even at 4 with a fifth-inning
single.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit starter Willie Blair went five innings, allowing four
runs and six hits. In three career outings against the Devil Rays,
Blair has given up 13 runs in 8 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay's Esteban Yan, nearly dropped from the rotation after
allowing 12 runs over five-plus innings in his previous two starts,
gave up four runs and eight hits in five innings. The right-hander
worked exclusively from the stretch position.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Tigers LF Bobby Higginson remained in the game after
crashing over a low wall down the left-field line in the third
inning chasing Fred McGriff's foul ball. ... Gerald Williams
(strained left hip flexor) was the Tampa Bay designated hitter
after missing the past seven games. ... Cruz has 13 RBIs in the
past 14 games. ... Former major league pitchers Elden Auker and
Virgil Trucks threw out ceremonial first pitches. ... Monday's
attendance was 15,709. The Devil Rays averaged 33,144 during a
three-game weekend series against the two-time defending World
Series champion New York Yankees.

<HEADLINE> Marlins 2, Mets 0  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Mike Piazza's streak of 15 straight games with an
RBI ended Monday night when Derrek Lee hit a two-run homer in the
ninth inning to give the Florida Marlins a 2-0 victory over the New
York Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza came close to extending his string, hitting a high fly
off the left-field scoreboard for a double in the eighth inning.
That stretched his hitting streak to 21 games.
</P>
<P>
   The major league record for consecutive games with an RBI is 17,
set by Ray Grimes of the Cubs in 1922.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza went 1-for-4 with three flyouts, the first two coming
with runners in scoring position. In the eighth, he got a second
chance when Lee, the Marlins' first baseman, overran Piazza's foul
ball down the line -- no error was charged.
</P>
<P>
   Starters Jesus Sanchez of the Marlins and Bobby J. Jones of the
Mets were gone when the game was decided.
</P>
<P>
   Florida won its fourth in a row. The Mets, who swept a
three-game series from the Marlins at home last week, have lost two
in a row after winning nine of 10.
</P>
<P>
   With one out in the Marlins ninth, Mike Lowell singled off Turk
Wendell (4-4). Lee followed with his 17th home run, a drive over
the center-field fence.
</P>
<P>
   Armando Almanza (2-0) got two outs for the win. He struck out
Melvin Mora with a runner on second to end the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez, who hasn't won since April 22 -- a drought that included
an 0-7 record with four no-decisions -- allowed four hits in eight
shutout innings. He struck out four and walked four.
</P>
<P>
   After Piazza doubled with two outs in the eighth, Sanchez
intentionally walked Todd Zeile and got Robin Ventura on a deep
flyout to center.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who entered the game with a two-game win streak but an
8.10 ERA, gave up four hits in six innings. He walked none and
struck out five.
Notes: Despite a pitchout, Luis Castillo stole second when
Piazza's throw sailed into center. It was Castillo's 35th steal,
tying him for the major league lead with Colorado's Tom Goodwin.
The Marlins were 4-for-4 on steal attempts. ... Injured Florida RHP
Alex Fernandez, on the disabled list for the past six weeks, has
shown no signs of returning to the mound anytime soon. The soreness
in his right elbow and the back of his surgically repaired right
shoulder still prevents him from throwing of any kind. ... Sanchez
entered the game with an 0-6 career mark and 4.91 ERA against the
Mets. ... Jones was 0-1 with an 11.09 ERA in his previous five road
starts.

   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Sophia Witherspoon scored 10 of her 20
points during a second-half rally, and the Portland Fire snapped a
five-game road losing streak with a 68-64 victory over the
Indianapolis Fever on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The loss in the matchup of WNBA expansion teams was the eighth
straight for the Fever, who dropped to 1-8 at home.
</P>
<P>
   Sylvia Crawley had 16 points and nine rebounds, and Stacey
Thomas added 13 points for Portland (4-10).
</P>
<P>
   Monica Maxwell led Indiana (3-12) with 20 points, but scored
only three in the second half when the Fever missed 22 of 32 shots.
Rita Williams added 15 points for Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Portland trailed 47-33 early in the second half when Witherspoon
hit two 3-pointers, a short jumper and a fastbreak layup to fuel a
25-8 run over the next 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana regained the lead at 64-63, but went scoreless over the
final 1:29. Tully Bevilaqua hit three free throws for Portland and
Crawley made two more for the final margin.
</P>
<P>
   The Fever used a 10-0 run to take a 38-27 lead at halftime.

<HEADLINE> Dow Gains 113; Nasdaq Climbs 26  </HEADLINE>
By EILEEN GLANTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue-chip stocks sprinted higher Monday in a
quiet, shortened session ahead of the Independence Day holiday. A
report of moderating economic growth helped inflation-sensitive
stocks advance.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 112.78 points to close at
10,560.67.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher, although they failed
to match the Dow's momentum. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up
14.72 at 1,469.32, and the Nasdaq composite index was up 25.82 at
3,991.93.
</P>
<P>
   Trading was extremely light. The stock market closed at 1 p.m.;
many Wall Street professionals had taken the day off, opting for a
four-day weekend. Composite volume on the New York Stock Exchange
came to 656.23 million shares, well below average.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a few catalysts drove trading. The National Association
of Purchasing Management reported a slowdown in manufacturing
activity growth, raising hopes that six interest-rate increases by
the Federal Reserve in the past year are slowing the economy to a
more sustainable pace.
</P>
<P>
   The purchasing managers' business index for June came in at
51.8, compared with 53.2 in May. While any reading above 50 is
considered a sign of economic growth, the index was lower than
analysts had anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the report's ''prices paid'' index fell from 65.8
in May to 61.2 in June. That component is considered an important
gauge of inflationary pressures.
</P>
<P>
   ''The market is telling a pretty good story,'' said Alan
Ackerman, senior vice president at Fahnestock &AMP; Co. in New York.
''This was a favorable piece of news that I think will allow some
interest-rate jitters to fade away.''
</P>
<P>
   Rate-sensitive stocks rose. J.P. Morgan gained $5.625 to $115.75
and First Union rose $1.188 to $26.188.
</P>
<P>
   Economists said the purchasing managers' report makes it less
likely that the Fed will raise interest rates at its next meeting
Aug. 22. With interest-rate worries fading, investors should be
able to concentrate on corporate earnings for the recently ended
second quarter, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We should start seeing a flow of positive earnings reports,
and that could help the market break out of the range-bound
condition it's been in,'' Ackerman said.
</P>
<P>
   Verizon, the company formed by the completion of the $59 billion
merger of Bell Atlantic Corp. and GTE Corp., rose $4.625 to $55. It
was the first day of trading for the newly combined company.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle fell $3.875 to $80.188. Late Friday, the company
announced that chief operating offer and president Ray Lane will
leave his post.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 2-to-1 margin on the
NYSE, and by a slender margin in Nasdaq trading.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 6.81 to 524.04.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas indexes were mostly higher, including Mexico's key IPC
index. Investors were celebrating the presidential victory of
opposition candidate Vicente Fox, whose victory ends the
Institutional Revolutionary Party's 71-year grip on the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the election wasn't a significant factor in U.S.
stock trading, but may stimulate interest in Mexican stocks in the
coming sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 1.2 percent.
Germany's Xetra DAX index rose 0.9 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100
rose 2.5 percent, and France's CAC-40 rose 1.0 percent.

<HEADLINE> Notes From Monday's Baseball Games  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated PressAMERICAN LEAGUE:
Blue Jays-Orioles:
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO: The Blue Jays activated RHP Peter Munro off the 15-day
disabled list and optioned him to Syracuse of the International
League. ... Carlos Delgado, held without an RBI in the first three
games of Toronto's series against Baltimore, had two in the finale
Monday. He leads the Jays with 74. ... David Wells needs three more
wins on the road to tie Pat Hentgen's club record of 12.
</P>
<P>
   BALTIMORE: Charles Johnson, batting sixth for the first time
this season, hit his 19th homer. The solo shot in the eighth inning
against Toronto tied his career high. ... Will Clark's string of
three straight games with a homer ended. His lone hit was a single.
... Luis Mercedes pitched four innings of scoreless relief and
could supplant Jason Johnson in the starting rotation. Manager Mike
Hargrove issued a rapid ''no comment'' when asked if that could
happen.
Tigers-Devil Rays:
</P>
<P>
   DETROIT: OF-DH Juan Gonzalez (sore left foot) and 1B Tony Clark
(back spasms) were scratched from the starting lineup. ...
Tuesday's scheduled starting pitcher, Dave Mlicki, has allowed 16
runs in 4 2-3 innings over his past two starts. In between the two
starts, which were on June 11 and 29, the right-hander worked four
shutout innings in two relief appearances.
</P>
<P>
   TAMPA BAY: 3B Vinny Castilla (lower back inflammation) was
activated from the 15-day disabled list and OF Quinton McCracken
was optioned to Triple-A Durham. ... LF Greg Vaughn (right
hamstring strain) is expected to be activated from the DL Tuesday.
... DH Jose Canseco (strained left heel) might return around the
All-Star break. Manager Larry Rothschild did not rule using Canseco
as pinch-hitter when the Devil Rays play at Florida this weekend.
White Sox-Royals:
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO: The White Sox purchased the contract of RHP Jon Garland
from Triple-A Charlotte. He took the roster spot of Kip Wells, who
was optioned to Charlotte. Garland, who was 9-2 with a 2.26 ERA in
16 starts in Charlotte, is scheduled to make his major league debut
on Tuesday against Kansas City. ... Chicago has won 10 straight
road games against clubs with a .500 record or better, the most
since 1900 according to Elias Sports Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY: Manager Tony Muser said that Jeff Suppan will be
moved to the bullpen. Suppan, who is 2-6 with a 5.57 ERA, will be
replaced in the rotation by Blake Stein. Stein has been on the
disabled list since cracking a bone in his pitching arm during
spring training. Stein was expected in Kansas City on Monday and
will be activated prior to a probable Friday start. ... The Royals
are in the middle of an 18-game stretch in which 15 of the games
are at home. A three-game trip to Houston this weekend marks the
only excursion during the stretch.
Red Sox-Twins:
</P>
<P>
   BOSTON: The Red Sox (38-39), who are below .500 for the first
time since April 11 when they were 3-4, haven't won any of their
last seven series. Boston is 10-21 since taking two of three from
the New York Yankees in late May. ... RHP Pedro Martinez, on the
disabled list with a strained left oblique, rejoined the team in
Minneapolis on Monday. He is eligible to come off the disabled list
July 11, the date of the All-Star game. ... OF Bernard Gilkey,
recently released by the Arizona Diamondbacks, continued to work
out with the Red Sox, but team officials said they had made no
decision on whether to sign him.
</P>
<P>
   MINNESOTA: The Twins, who just wrapped up a 13-game, 13-day road
trip with a 7-6 record, don't have a day off until the All-Star
break that begins July 10. ... Only Tampa Bay has a worse home
record than the Twins. Minnesota is 17-21; the Devil Rays are
17-23. ... Radio broadcaster Herb Carneal returned to the booth
Monday for the first time since his wife died June 13. The Twins
retired Kathy Carneal's seat at the Metrodome and flowers are
placed on it before each game.
Athletics-Rangers:
</P>
<P>
   OAKLAND: RHP Chad Harville was recalled from Triple-A Sacramento
on Monday, replacing RHP Ariel Prieto, who was optioned to the
Pacific Coast League team. In 35 games at Sacramento this season,
Harville was 3-2 with seven saves and a 4.75 ERA with 50 strikeouts
in 40 1-3 innings. He pitched in 15 games for Oakland in his first
major league stint last season, going 0-2 with a 6.91 ERA. Prieto
was 1-1 with a 6.23 ERA in three start for the A's. ... CF Terrence
Long returned to the starting lineup for the series opener at Texas
after being used only as a ninth-inning defensive replacement
Sunday. Prior to Monday's game, he led AL rookies in home runs (9)
and RBIs (36) and was second in batting average (.270).
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS: LHP Darren Oliver, who injured his left leg on a nail
when he stumbled in the attic at his home on Sunday, threw in the
Rangers bullpen prior to Monday's game. Oliver said he will be
ready to make his scheduled start Wednesday for Triple-A Oklahoma.
He has been on the disabled list since June 21 with weakness in his
throwing shoulder, and isn't expected to rejoin the Rangers
starting rotation until after the All-Star break. ... Manager
Johnny Oates said the Rangers probably won't know until at least
Friday the long-term prognosis for SS Royce Clayton, who left
Sunday night's game with a strained oblique muscle in his left
side. Oates said the muscle was already tender from a dive Clayton
made in last Thursday's game at Oakland and was aggravated in
Sunday's game. Oates said it's unlikely that Clayton will play
again before next week's All-Star break and that the disabled list
is still a possibility.
Mariners-Angels:
</P>
<P>
   SEATTLE: The Mariners lead the AL in on-base percentage despite
being last in the league in hits. They have a .367 on-base
percentage and are last in the AL with 722 hits. Seattle has 397
walks, second in the league only to Oakland's 399.
</P>
<P>
   ANAHEIM: Darin Erstad was a late scratch for Monday's game
because of tightness in his lower back. It's only the second game
missed this season by the Angels' leadoff hitter, who has a major
league-leading 130 hits. He's only 18 hits shy of his previous
career high. ... Garret Anderson, who entered this season with a
career .307 average against right-handers, is hitting only .213
against them this year, but .313 against left-handers. He was
batting .239 overall going into the game against the Mariners.
NATIONAL LEAGUE:
Pirates-Cubs:
</P>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH: Bad news for the Pirates' pitching: Francisco
Cordova had to leave Monday's game after four innings because of a
sore elbow. He's already been on the DL this year with a similar
problem. ''I think he will miss a turn for sure,'' Pirates manager
Gene Lamont said. ''His control hasn't been Cordova-esque. We need
to get him well.'' LHP Jason Christiansen, who gave up a homer to
Henry Rodriguez, had back spasms and pitched only one-third of an
inning. He might also land on the DL, Lamont said. ... The Pirates
activated LHP Scott Sauerbeck from the DL, where he'd been since
June 15 with a left elbow sprain. Sauerbeck, who made two scoreless
appearances during a rehab stint with Triple-A Nashville, pitched
two scoreless innings Monday against the Cubs. The Pirates sent RHP
Bronson Arroyo (0-2, 9.33 ERA in four starts) to Nashville. ...
Tuesday is the one-year anniversary of Jason Kendall's
season-ending injury. He dislocated his right ankle against
Milwaukee while landing on first base while trying to beat out a
bunt.
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO: Henry Rodriguez is the second Cub to homer in three
straight games this season. Sammy Sosa did it from May 4-6. ...
Ricky Gutierrez, who has struggled since coming off the disabled
list with a separated shoulder June 22, has been dropped to seventh
in the batting order. Gutierrez, who normally bats second,
responded Monday with a 2-for-3 and a walk and raised his average
to .286. Gutierrez leads the majors with 12 sacrifice bunts. He
entered the season with only 14 in his entire career. ... Cubs
manager Don Baylor announced that Kerry Wood, Kevin Tapani and Jon
Lieber would be his starters for the interleague series against the
White Sox that begins Friday at Wrigley Field.
Reds-Diamondbacks:
</P>
<P>
   CINCINNATI: Going into the game, the career-high 11 losses by
Reds starter Steve Parris were the most by a Reds right-hander
since Jay Tibbs lost 16 in 1985. ... Last year, Parris tied Pete
Harnisch for tops on the club in complete games with two. This
year, no Cincinnati pitcher has thrown a complete game, an 81-game
stretch which is a club record to start a season. The 1997 Reds
went 80 games into the season without a complete game. ... RHP Andy
Larkin, promoted from Triple-A Louisville hours before when RHP
Manny Aybar went on the DL, worked the last two innings of a 14-2
victory over Arizona on Sunday without allowing a hit or a run.
</P>
<P>
   ARIZONA: The Diamondbacks placed rookie 1B Alex Cabrera on the
15-day DL and recalled RHP Nelson Figueroa from Triple-A Tucson.
Cabrera hit .571 (8-for-14) in his first week of big league action,
but strained his left groin Saturday while running out a double,
his third hit of that game. ... It was Arizona's 11th DL move in
the first half of the season. RHP Todd Stottlemyre, 3B Matt
Williams and 1B Erubiel Durazo are currently on the DL. ... Manager
Buck Showalter opted for a 12th pitcher rather than a position
player going into a three-game series in Houston's cozy Enron
Field. ... The team's 47-34 record at the season's midpoint is the
best in the franchise's three-year history. The 1999 Diamondbacks,
who won a division title, were 44-37 after 81 games.
Mets-Marlins:
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK: The Mets placed INF Kurt Abbott on the disabled list
with lower-back inflammation, retroactive to June 30. To replace
his roster spot, the Mets purchased the contract of 25-year-old
infielder David Lamb from Triple-A Norfolk. The Mets transferred SS
Rey Ordonez to the 60-day disabled list. ... Mike Piazza's 71 RBIs
are the most in team history prior to the All-Star break. Dave
Kingman had 69 in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA: Marlins RHP A.J. Burnett and reliever Dan Miceli will
begin rehab assignments Wednesday. Burnett, on the mend from a
ruptured ligament in the thumb, will start for Class A Brevard
County at Fort Myers against the Miracle. Miceli, healing from a
tightness in the forearm, will pitch an inning for the Gulf Coast
League Melbourne Marlins against the Tigers. ... The Marlins' 91
home runs are the most by a Marlins team before the All-Star break,
snapping the 82 hit in 1996. ... The 41-41 start is the second-best
in team history and the third time the Marlins have been at .500 or
better after the midpoint of the season. ... SS Alex Gonzalez
returned to the starting lineup after not starting the past six
games since sustaining an injury to the middle finger of his
throwing hand against the Cubs on June 25th.
Expos-Braves:
</P>
<P>
   MONTREAL: The Expos are coming off a three-game series in
Montreal in which they lost all three games to the Florida Marlins
by one run. ... The Expos concluded their 14-day, 12-game homestand
with a 4-8 record, falling to 38-39 and below .500 for the first
time since April 7 (2-3).
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA: Rookie SS Rafael Furcal, who came off the disabled list
only Thursday, did not play Sunday in New York due to a recurrence
of the sore right hamstring that put on him on DL. He's listed as
day-to-day, but manager Bobby Cox said he won't play for awhile,
which could mean the entire four-game series with Montreal. ...
Chipper Jones, who didn't play Sunday because of the flu, was back
in the lineup against the Expos. ... John Smoltz, on the disabled
list and out for the season after elbow surgery, will take part in
a three-day celebrity golf tournament at Lake Tahoe this weekend.
The field includes Michael Jordan and John Elway with a first prize
of $75,000 in the $500,000 event.
Phillies-Brewers:
</P>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA: As they began a four-game set in Milwaukee on
Monday, the Phillies had won five consecutive series. The last time
they had done that was 1995, when they won 10 in a row. ... 3B
Scott Rolen had a 10-game hitting streak heading into Monday's
game. He was batting .410 (16-of-39) in that span with three homers
and 11 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE: Milwaukee's starting rotation is rounding into form.
In their last starts, pitchers Jason Bere, Jimmy Haynes, Jamey
Wright and Jeff D'Amico combined to allow only seven earned runs in
31 1-3 innings (2.01 ERA). Opponents had a .163 batting average
against the four starters. ... None of the pitchers in the current
rotation, which also includes Monday starter John Snyder, has
thrown a complete game this year in 56 starts. The only complete
game was thrown by Steve Woodard, who has been banished to the
bullpen because of inconsistency.
Rockies-Padres:
</P>
<P>
   COLORADO: Larry Walker, moved from right field to left field to
take some pressure off his healing right elbow, got Monday night
off. ... On Sunday, Walker batted in the fifth spot for the first
time since Sept. 2 and 4, 1996, at Pittsburgh. He started in the
fifth spot for the Rockies several times in 1995, and early in his
career at Montreal he batted in the fifth, sixth and even the
seventh spot several times. ... Colorado, 44-33 going into Monday
night's game at San Diego, is assured of a winning record at the
All-Star break for just the second time in the franchise's
eight-year history. The other time was 1995.
</P>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO: With 57 RBIs, Bret Boone is three short of matching
Roberto Alomar's 1990 total of 60, most ever by a Padres second
baseman. ... Boone has driven in 19 runs in his last 11 games and
needs only six more to match his 1999 total of 63 in 152 games with
Atlanta. ... Thirty of Boone's 57 RBIs, or 53 percent, have come in
only seven games. He has a pair of six-RBI games, five- and
four-RBI nights and three three-RBI games.

<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Merlakia Jones hit a 15-foot jump shot from the
left baseline with 18.5 seconds to play in overtime to give the
Cleveland Rockers a 66-65 victory over the New York Liberty on
Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   New York (7-9) took a 65-62 lead when Tamika Whitmore made an
18-foot jumper with 2:30 to play and Vickie Johnson followed with a
15-footer.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland battled back, however, as Vicki Hall grabbed a rebound
and scored with 1:02 to play to pull the Rockers within a point.
</P>
<P>
   Jones then spun free along the baseline and hit the game-winner.
Whitmore missed a 10-footer with three seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Hall, who got more playing time because of a season-ending knee
injury to leading scorer Eva Nemcova, led Cleveland with a
career-high 17 points.
</P>
<P>
   Nemcova, averaging 13.2 points in her fourth season with
Cleveland, tore the anterior cruciate ligament in her left knee
Saturday night in the Rockers' 75-67 loss in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Whitmore led New York with 17 points, including 12 in the second
half.
</P>
<P>
   The game was tied 35-35 at halftime, and remained close
throughout as both teams played tenacious defense and patient
offense.
</P>
<P>
   Suzie McConnell Serio made a 3-pointer with 1:01 left in
regulation to put Cleveland ahead, 59-57.
</P>
<P>
   But New York's Tari Phillips beat the shot clock and tied it by
sinking a 12-foot jumper 30 seconds later.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland called a time out to set up a final play. Jones missed
a 15-footer with five seconds to play, Hall got the rebound and
fired a wild shot that missed badly.
</P>
<P>
   Mery Andrade had a career-high 12 points for Cleveland with 3:03
left in the first half, but she took only two more shots and did
not score after halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson scored 10 and Becky Hammon eight for the Liberty in the
first half.

<HEADLINE> Denmark Guard Decries Concert Deaths  </HEADLINE>
By JAN M. OLSEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) -- A security guard Monday criticized
the handling of a deadly crush of fans at a Pearl Jam concert,
saying the music should have been stopped earlier to prevent the
deaths of eight people.
</P>
<P>
   Per Johansen, who was one of 60 security personnel stationed
near the stage barrier to control the crowds, said too many people
had to approve the decision, and a full 15 minutes elapsed between
the time people started falling and the music stopped.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the music doesn't stop, they'll die,'' Johansen recalled
shouting to the leader of the security group, which was in a pit
between the festival's main stage and the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Johansen told the Ekstra Bladet newspaper that he then shouted
that those who had fallen in the mud ''are dying now.''
</P>
<P>
   Eight people suffocated Friday night when they were caught up in
a crush of fans pressing closer to the stage just before midnight
as Pearl Jam was playing on the main stage at the popular Roskilde
festival.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five people were injured and a 22-year-old Australian man
remained hospitalized in serious condition, but his injuries were
not life-threatening, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The grounds at the annual festival near Roskilde, for which
74,000 tickets were sold, were muddy from an all-day rain when the
tragedy occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Johansen told Danish public radio that he asked the security
chief in the pit three times to stop the music. Finally, that
person, whom Johansen didn't identify, put the request to the stage
security person, who then contacted the office and finally got hold
of the U.S. band's manager, who interrupted the concert.
</P>
<P>
   Security guards began pulling concert goers over a barrier and
into a corridor set up for photographers and to evacuate people in
emergencies. Some 50,000 people had attended the concert in
Roskilde, 25 miles west of the capital, Copenhagen.
</P>
<P>
   Festival organizers have defended security arrangements but said
they would look into the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman Leif Skov said each security guard could not be
expected to have a full overview.
</P>
<P>
   ''Therefore chains of command are necessary,'' he said. ''It's
important that this is investigated.''
</P>
<P>
   Police spokesman Bengt Rungstroem said investigators were
looking into security arrangements, but he had no immediate comment
on the reports.
</P>
<P>
   British bands Oasis and the Pet Shop Boys pulled out of their
Saturday night appearances, but other groups played as scheduled.
The festival ended Sunday when popular Danish band D-A-D lit eight
torches -- one for each victim -- and let them circulate in the crowd
before the Orange Stage.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first major accident at the four-day festival, which
was first held in 1971 and was inspired by the 1969 Woodstock
Festival in upstate New York.

<HEADLINE> Bruins Sign Sweeney to 3-Year Deal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Boston defenseman Don Sweeney, a 12-year veteran
and the team's longest-tenured player, signed a three-year contract
with the Bruins on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney, 33, was an unrestricted free agent as of July 1, and
could have signed with any team. Terms were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was not an easy deal to make because there were a lot of
teams that wanted to sign Don,'' Bruins president and general
manager Harry Sinden said. ''He reminds us of what is needed to
have a winning team and we did not want to lose him.''
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney has 44 goals and 180 assists for 224 career points in
832 regular season games.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins struggled through an injury-marred 1999-2000 season,
missed the playoffs and traded defenseman Ray Bourque, one of the
team's greatest players.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm looking forward to moving ahead, putting last year behind
us and getting back to where we want to be,'' Sweeney said.

<HEADLINE> Expos 17, Braves 1  </HEADLINE>
By TOM SALADINO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Jose Vidro and Orlando Cabrera each hit two home
runs and the Montreal Expos rapped 18 hits, routing the Atlanta
Braves 17-1 Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Tony Armas Jr. (4-5) beat the Braves for the second time
in a week. The son of former major league outfielder Tony Armas
also got his first major league hit and RBI.
</P>
<P>
   The switch-hitting Vidro homered from both sides of the plate.
Cabrera drove in a career-high five runs and Rondell White added a
three-run homer as the Expos stopped a four-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   The 17 runs were the most Atlanta had allowed since losing to
Baltimore 22-1 on June 13, 1999. The 18 hits against the Braves
were a season high.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta came out flat after an emotional four-game series in New
York between the two top teams in the NL East. The Braves split
that set, winning 10-2 Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Mulholland (8-8), who was 17-4 lifetime against the Expos
after winning in Montreal last Wednesday, lasted only 4 1-3
innings. He gave up nine runs and 10 hits.
</P>
<P>
   Armas allowed one run and five hits in 6 1-3 innings. Last
Tuesday, he defeated Atlanta 6-4 and left after 5 1-3 innings
because of a blister on his right middle finger.
</P>
<P>
   Vidro, whose career-high 14-game hitting streak ended Sunday,
hit a three-run homer from the right side in the third. He added a
solo homer, his 15th, from the left side in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Vidro finished 3-for-4 with a pair of walks and scored four
times.
</P>
<P>
   Cabrera, who went 4-for-5 and also scored four runs, capped a
six-run fifth inning with his seventh homer of the season. He hit a
two-run drive in the eighth off Dave Stevens.
</P>
<P>
   Cabrera's three-run shot came on the second pitch from Atlanta's
Ismael Villegas, who was making his major league debut.
</P>
<P>
   White connected for his 11th homer off Villegas in the seventh
after Cabrera singled and Vidro drew a two-out walk.
</P>
<P>
   Armas had been 0-for-12 as a hitter until his RBI single in the
fourth. he gave up a run-scoring single to Javy Lopez in the bottom
half.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Mulholland has allowed at least 10 hits in each of his last
four starts. ... Villegas was 0-3 with three saves and a 4.29 ERA
at Triple-A Richmond before being recalled Sunday. ... White's home
run over the left-field fence went 445 feet, the third longest ever
hit at Turner Field. Jeremy Burnitz of Milwaukee hit one 454 feet
on June 24, the longest. Former Brave Ryan Klesko's 449-foot drive
is the second longest.

<TEXT>
<P>
   UTICA, N.Y. (AP) -- The longtime mayor of Utica, who has been
fighting allegations of sexual harassment by two former and two
current male city employees, announced his resignation late Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Edward A. Hanna, 78, said in a written statement that he was
stepping down because of ''my serious heart condition along with my
age.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Regretfully it is strictly a health decision to bring my work
as mayor to a close,'' he said. ''As some already know, I have had
chest pains which have occurred more frequently during the past
months.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican, a self-made millionaire who funds his own
campaigns, has never minced words. Two years ago he referred to the
City Council as a ''childish collection of mindless babblers who
act without any coherent or cogent vision for this city.''
</P>
<P>
   The sexual harassment allegations were made in June in notices
of claim, which precede a lawsuit. The four men allege their
employment was tied to their responses to the mayor's advances.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Hanna denied the allegations, calling them part of
a ''cleverly orchestrated conspiracy to extort money, including
political rewards and control.''
</P>
<P>
   Utica, an old manufacturing city of 59,300, had a population of
about 90,000 in the 1970s before a long economic decline. Hanna was
first elected mayor in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   To encourage citizens to feel better about City Hall, he once
filled the lobby with cocktail tables and potted trees with
mechanical tweeting canaries. He took the door off the mayor's
office and put a sign over his couch saying ''The Town's Living
Room.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I would hope to be remembered as a mayor who had eyes that
could see what needed to be done and a heart that cared,'' Hanna
said.

   MIAMI (AP) -- The New York Mets put infielder Kurt Abbott on the
disabled list Monday and purchased the contract of infielder David
Lamb from Triple-A Norfolk.
</P>
<P>
   Abbott, batting .210 with three home runs and seven RBIs, is out
with lower back inflammation. The move was made retroactive to June

   The Mets also transferred shortstop Rey Ordonez to the 60-day
disabled list. He is sidelined for the rest of the season because

<HEADLINE> Athlete Killed by Bear Attack  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUEBEC CITY, Quebec (AP) -- A 24-year-old athlete was killed in
an apparent bear attack while running on a training course, police
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   There was a bite mark on the neck of Mary-Beth Miller of
Yellowknife, Northwest Territories, when her body was discovered
late Sunday in the heavily wooded area just northwest of Quebec
City, Capt. Johanne Bournival said.
</P>
<P>
   Black bear tracks also were spotted near her body.
</P>
<P>
   ''At first sight it seems she was attacked by a bear,''
Bournival said.
</P>
<P>
   An autopsy will be conducted Wednesday, Sarah Coup-Fabiano, a
spokeswoman for the Haute-St-Charles police department, said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The autopsy will confirm whether the bear was the exact cause
of death or whether she had a heart attack or something before and
the animal found her injured,'' Coup-Fabiano said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just a hypothesis, but it's our belief that the bear was
responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller was a member of Biathlon Canada, the national biathlon
association, and had arrived at the Valcartier military base last
week for a summer of training at the Myriam Bedard Center.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, who started her run at 9 a.m., was reported missing by
her trainer at 11 p.m., Bournival said.
</P>
<P>
   Her body was located by military searchers about a half-mile
from a main road.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, wildlife officials placed several cages around the
area in an effort to find the bear. The Canadian base closed the
trails until further notice.

<TEXT>
<P>
   UTICA, N.Y. (AP) - The mayor of Utica, fighting allegations of
sexual harassment by two former and two current male city
employees, announced his resignation effective Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am not quitting,'' longtime Mayor Edward A. Hanna said in a
written statement. ''But I am forced because of my serious heart
condition along with my age ... and stress in the regular routine
as mayor (to) bring my work as mayor to a close, effective
midnight, July 3.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanna, 78, a Republican self-made millionaire who funded his own
campaigns, has never minced words in his often-stormy political
career. Two years ago he referred to the city council as a
''childish collection of mindless babblers who act without any
coherent or cogent vision for this city.''
</P>
<P>
   ''As some already know, I have had chest pains which have
occurred more frequently during the past months,'' Hanna stated
Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Monday, Hanna announced that he and his wife would take
an unplanned 10-day vacation following a doctor's visit. He
referred to city hall as a ''pressure cooker'' and noted several
medications he now takes daily.
</P>
<P>
   He also released a letter from a physician from 1992 that stated
he had blocked arteries. He noted that he'd taken just five
business days off each year since working as mayor. Hanna served
two mayoral terms in the mid-1970s and was elected comptroller in
the early 1990s then relected mayor in 1995 and again in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The sexual harassment allegations were contained in sworn
notices of claim served in June against Hanna and the city of
Utica.
</P>
<P>
   In the notices of claim, the four claimants allege their
employment was tied to their responses to the mayor's advances.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Hanna denied the allegations, calling them part of
a ''cleverly orchestrated conspiracy to extort money, including
political rewards and control.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, he spoke of the city's future and his legacy.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would hope to be remembered as a mayor who had eyes that
could see what needed to be done and a heart that cared,'' Hanna
said.
</P>
<P>
   Timothy Julian, common council president, will assume mayoral
duties.
</P>
<P>
   Hanna's colorful career often made headlines statewide and
sometimes nationwide since the son of Lebanese immigrants was first
elected mayor in 1973. In The New York Times Magazine in 1976 he
said: ''The phonies and the fakers and the blue bloods have been
draining this lousy town for too long. It's time for them to wake
up and see this is a new day.'' He made the statement when he was
sworn into office.
</P>
<P>
   He was arrested in the 1970s for breaking into his police
chief's office amid a feud in which he said the police turned Utica
into a ''banana republic.''
</P>
<P>
   A former city hall employee, Ed Byrne, was quoted in The Wall
Street Journal in 1976 as saying: ''Utica is the only city in the
United States where the village idiot got elected mayor.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Hanna had his supporters, those who swept him to office
twice.
</P>
<P>
   To encourage citizens to feel better about city hall he once
filled the lobby with cocktail tables and chairs with potted trees
nearby. In some of the trees he put mechanical tweeting canaries.
He took the door off the mayor's office and put a sign over his
couch saying ''The Town's Living Room.''
</P>
<P>
   The old manufacturing city of 59,300 people 46 miles east of
Syracuse had a population of about 90,000 in the 1970s, but Rust
Belt pressures led to a long depressed economy. Several initiatives
have sought to revive the economic base and to renovate low-income
sections of the city, initiatives that continue today.

<HEADLINE> Armstrong To Begin Tour de France  </HEADLINE>
By IAN PHILLIPS
<TEXT>
<P>
   NANTES, France (AP) -- After a week living at a futuristic
concrete-and-glass theme park, Lance Armstrong is ready to begin
the real Tour de France.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 champion, caged up at Futuroscope Park after a week's
training and Saturday's time trial, was itching to break out on to
the open road.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong is in second place in this year's event, four seconds
behind overall leader David Millar. He finished 64th, as part of
the second pack, in Monday's third stage.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm happy we've got started,'' Armstrong said as the Tour
began to wind its way through Muscadet country toward the city of
Nantes near the Atlantic coast.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's good to be finally going from one place to another --
that's the real Tour de France.''
</P>
<P>
   Laurent Jalabert of France was in third place and he closed the
gap slightly, moving from 15 seconds to just six seconds behind the
leader.
</P>
<P>
   Belgium's Tom Steels won his second straight stage, bursting
ahead of a bunched pack in a dramatic sprint. He finished in 3
hours, 37 minutes, 51 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Germany's Marcel Wust of Festina was second, only separated from
Erik Zabel of Deutsche Telekom by the toss of a coin.
</P>
<P>
   The riders began in the old town of Loudun and covered 100
miles, passing by Muscadet vineyards and rolling fields of
sunflowers.
</P>
<P>
   Millar was part of a pileup among several racers about a
half-mile from the finish. He recovered quickly, completed the race
and barely held the top spot. He would have lost his yellow jersey
to Armstrong if he failed to get back into the race.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong, a 28-year-old Texan, won last year in incredible
fashion. He triumphed in France just three years after being
diagnosed with testicular cancer that spread to his brain and
lungs.
</P>
<P>
   He believes he will peak at the right time during the three-week
event to again put in a strong challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ''In general I feel very good,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong, so far, has looked completely focused on the job
ahead, his concentration and deadpan stare only occasionally broken
by hoards of autograph hunters.
</P>
<P>
   After each race, he has ridden straight up to the door of his
U.S. Postal team's trailer and jumped in before being whisked back
to the team hotel.
</P>
<P>
   One disadvantage of winning last year's race is that Armstrong
is now a marked man, both by competitors and the media.
</P>
<P>
   He is so intent on retaining his title and so determined to stay
out of the spotlight that he was even relieved not to hold the
leader's yellow jersey after the opening individual time trial.
</P>
<P>
   Millar, from Britain, beat him by two seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong has held back early, with his sights set on Tuesday's
team time trial in which he is expected to excel.
</P>
<P>
   He has faith in his team -- Tyler Hamilton is currently 10th
overall and looking strong -- and knows the stakes are high.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am very hopeful we will do a big time and put in a big
performance,'' Armstrong said.
</P>
<P>
   This year's competition is stiffer, mainly due to the return of
1997 champion Jan Ullrich of Germany and 1998 champion Marco
Pantani from Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Pantani should be formidable in the mountains -- but that's also
where Armstrong made it clear last year, with a thrilling victory
in the Alps, that he was the man to beat.
</P>
<P>
   Pantani has been noticeably absent so far, trailing Armstrong by
2:14.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's got a very good team and definitely remains a factor I
have to reckon with,'' Armstrong said.
</P>
<P>
   Just as he has relished hitting the open roads, Armstrong can't
wait to see the Pyrenees mountains on the Spanish border, where the
10th stage will be held next Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong will have no qualms about wearing yellow then.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's better not to have it right now and to try and get it in
the Pyrenees,'' he said. ''That's where the race really begins for
me.''

<HEADLINE> Judge Paul G. Hatfield Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREAT FALLS, Mont. (AP) -- Senior U.S. District Judge Paul G.
Hatfield, a former senator who in 1979 cast a deciding vote for the
treaties that gave the Panama Canal back to the Central American
country, died Monday. He was 72.
</P>
<P>
   Hatfield apparently suffered a heart attack at his home, the
coroner said.
</P>
<P>
   Appointed to the Senate in 1978 after the death of Sen. Lee
Metcalf, a fellow Montana Democrat, Hatfield served for only a
year. Hatfield was among the last of the undecideds on the Panama
Canal issue, and he did not make up his mind to vote for
ratification until the last moment.
</P>
<P>
   The treaties, which were passionately opposed by many Montanans,
were ratified by a single vote.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Mansfield, the former Senate majority leader from Montana
who at the time was U.S. ambassador to Japan, wrote Hatfield
congratulating him for ''an act of statesmanship and courage on the
part of a new senator under very heavy pressure.'' But Hatfield
paid a heavy price.
</P>
<P>
   Mary McGrory, a national political columnist, described in a
column after the vote how Hatfield, a Korean War veteran, returned
to Montana to speak to his hometown Veterans of Foreign Wars post
in Great Falls a day later -- and was met by boos.
</P>
<P>
   He was dubbed ''Panama Paul.'' A recall petition circulated,
though it was quickly declared invalid by the attorney general. In
the four-way Democratic primary two months after the vote, Hatfield
got only 19 percent of the vote to 65 percent for Max Baucus, now
in his fourth term in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The following year, he was appointed to the federal bench by
President Carter. He served as U.S. district judge for 17 years
before taking senior status -- the equivalent of retirement for
federal judges, a status that left him with a limited caseload.
