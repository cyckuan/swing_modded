PRESIDENT ADMITS IMPROPER BEHAVIOR IN LEWINSKY CASE 

</HEADLINE>

c.1998 Houson Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With his presidency at risk, President Clinton
reversed course Monday and acknowledged engaging in sex with former
White House intern Monica Lewinsky, then apologized publicly for a
relationship that he denied under oath earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did have a relationship with Miss Lewinsky that was not
appropriate. In fact, it was wrong,'' the president said in a
televised address after more than four hours of grand jury
testimony. But he said that he never urged anyone to lie or
cover-up the affair.
</P>
<P>
   The president's admission, first made during the unprecedented
testimony before a federal grand jury, apparently did not satisfy
independent counsel Kenneth Starr, who is preparing a report for
Congress outlining what could be impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
   Starr notified Clinton's legal team that he was reserving the
right to seek additional testimony from the president after he
provided only general acknowledgment of a sexual affair, then
refused to provide details sought by prosecutors of the kind of
contact he had with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that my public comments and my silence about this
matter gave a false impression. I misled people, including even my
wife. I deeply regret that,'' Clinton said in his public comments.
He is the first president to testify before a grand jury
investigating his conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said his trysts with Lewinsky ``constituted a critical
lapse in judgment and a personal failure on my part for which I am
solely and completely responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he was truthful when answering questions posed by
Starr and his deputies, who have been investigating whether the
president lied about Lewinsky, urged others to lie and tried to
obstruct justice with a series of legal maneuvers to block the
grand jury inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Late Monday, the president's private lawyer, David E. Kendall,
issued a statement saying the president ``made the painful
admission'' of carrying on an affair with Lewinsky. ``As to a very
few, highly intrusive questions, with respect to the specifics of
this contact (with Lewinsky), in order to preserve personal privacy
and institutional integrity, (the president) gave candid, but not
detailed, answers.''
</P>
<P>
   In his speech to a television audience, Clinton said he wanted
to put the issue behind him. ``This matter is between me, the two
people I love most _ my wife and our daughter _ and our God,'' the
president said. ``I must put it right, and I am prepared to do
whatever it takes to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   It is time ``to stop the prying into private lives and get on
with our national life,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our country has been distracted by this matter for too long,
and I take my responsibility for my part in all of this,'' he said.
``Now it is time _ in fact, it is past time, to move on. It is time
to stop the pursuit of personal destruction and the prying into
private lives and get on with our national life.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he did not come forward earlier because he was
trying to save himself embarrassment and because of his mistrust of
Starr's investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The president's testimony from the White House Map Room was
viewed at the federal courthouse by the 23-member grand jury on two
television sets. The closed-circuit broadcast was wired to the
spacious courtroom of Chief U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway
Johnson rather than the more confining room where the grand jury
normally meets. Reporters were kept 80 feet from the courtroom
entrance.
</P>
<P>
   After the session with Starr, Clinton huddled with his legal
team and political advisers, then issued his televised apology from
the Map Room. Aides said he began drafting those remarks early
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's strategists were counting on a candid accounting by
the president to appease most Americans. Polls through the weekend
indicated citizens continued to give Clinton high marks for his job
performance and might be willing to let the Lewinsky matter slip if
he apologized.
</P>
<P>
   Starr left the White House without comment. At the courthouse,
his spokesman, Charles Bakaly, indicated the investigation of the
president and the intern was drawing to a close. ``We're continuing
to do what we said we would and that is to complete the
investigation as fairly and as efficiently as we can and that's
what we're going to do,'' Bakaly told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Grand jurors were expected to gather again today. Possible
witnesses include Lewinsky, presidential secretary Betty Currie and
deputy White House counsel Bruce Lindsey, a longtime friend and
confidant of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky, who was 21 when her affair with Clinton began,
reportedly told the grand jury of a dozen White House sexual
encounters with the president over an 18-month period. She also
told how they discussed ``cover stories'' to keep their
relationship secret, but she said Clinton never urged her to lie
under oath.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Lewinsky and the president both denied under oath
that they engaged in sex. Their statements were made in response to
subpoenas issued in Paula Jones' sexual harassment suit against
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky changed her story after six months of pressure from
Starr. She agreed to cooperate with his investigation in return for
immunity from prosecution and testified before the grand jury Aug.
6.
</P>
<P>
   For Clinton, the danger legally extends beyond his admission of
sex if Starr continues pushing to establish possible evidence of
obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   Still under scrutiny by Starr are efforts by Clinton associates
to get Lewinsky a job, which prosecutors have indicated is a sign
that a cover-up was under way. Lewinsky also reportedly told the
grand jury that Clinton told her that if they both deny having sex,
no one could prove it.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky told grand jurors that she returned to the White House
several gifts he had given her, after he suggested it. She
addressed the packages, again at Clinton's suggestion, to Currie,
Lewinsky reportedly testified.
</P>
<P>
   Before meeting with prosecutors Monday, the president gave aides
a rough draft of the public remarks he planned to deliver and
directed them to postpone until today his departure for Martha's
Vineyard, the Massachusetts island where he plans to vacation with
his wife and their 18-year-old daughter Chelsea.
</P>
<P>
   Late Sunday, Clinton met with the Rev. Jesse Jackson, a
prominent civil rights leader, for conversation and prayer at the
White House. Jackson said he went to the White House after he was
summoned by Chelsea. Jackson said he met with the first lady and
Chelsea, then the three of them talked briefly with the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortunately for him, they are greeting him with open arms and
devotion,'' Jackson said. ``I mean face it, he (Clinton) is
embarrassed by whatever happened, however one defines
inappropriate, and Hillary has had to face the humiliation of it
all. But then, she is mature and they are in love and their
marriage will survive this.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Ashcroft, a Missouri Republican who is considering a
presidential bid in 2000, said Clinton's admission should not mean
he should remain in office. ``It should be the basis for his
resignation,'' Ashcroft said. ``If he has subverted the truth, if
there are the serious crimes of perjury, the Congress has a
responsibility to impeach.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the president should be forgiven, but the job of the
state, though, is justice,'' Ashcroft said. ``It's not incompatible
to forgive the president and want to see justice here.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, chairman of the Senate
Judiciary Committee, reacted angrily to Clinton's television
remarks, in which he expressed distrust for Starr and his inquiry.
``Wasn't that pathetic? I tell you, what a jerk,'' Hatch said.
``That's the biggest mistake he's ever made.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier he said: ``I don't see how he can possibly hide behind
`It's consensual.' The most powerful man in the world and a
21-year-old intern. Consensual or not, it's still abysmal, if it
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic National Committee Chairman Roy Romer, the Colorado
governor, said people want to see the investigation wrapped up so
the government can focus instead on substantive issues such as
Social Security and health care.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are saying: `Get this out of the way so we can get to
the business of America,''' Romer said at a news conference in
Denver.

MONTHS OF DENIAL HAVE TAKEN TOLL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID GOLDSTEIN  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star   (Washington) _ The American public
Monday finally got President Clinton's long-delayed answer to a
very personal question.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now another question might be: Could this mess all have been
over seven months ago, almost before it even began?
</P>
<P>
   To Republicans the answer is easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people aren't stupid,'' Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah,
the Republican chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said
Monday before the president's admission that he tried to mislead
the public about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky. ``They know
he could have done this seven months ago, and it would have been
much more acceptable then.''
</P>
<P>
   Woody Cozad, chairman of the Missouri Republican Party, agreed.
``It should have taken 24 hours to sit down with family, friends
and advisers to say, `We have a problem.' They should have said,
`Let's deal with this, tell the truth and move on.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe not, say the president's supporters.
</P>
<P>
   The scandal's duration depends upon whom you're going to blame,
said Harriett Woods, a longtime Democratic activist from Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   ``A fallible president, admittedly,'' she asked, ``or the nasty
politics that seems to obsess us in finding something wrong with
our leaders?''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have spent four years and $40 million trying to pin down
some criminal fault in the president. We're boiling it down to him
testifying about the possibility of sexual relations with a
consenting adult....
</P>
<P>
   ``I can feel real annoyance with him, and I do. But I can also
feel a fury for those who have been pursuing this goal of bringing
him down, even when it no longer seemed to be attached to the very
legitimate issue of performance in office.''
</P>
<P>
   Dayton Duncan, a historian who worked in the presidential
campaigns of Democrats Walter Mondale and Michael Dukakis, said he
was not so confident in the ability of the media and the political
culture to tread softly on such an explosive issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had he said that seven months ago, ...we would still be
talking about it today,'' he said. ``The length of time which this
has preoccupied the media is a manifestation of a modern
fascination with incredibly personal things. Then it would be:
`Which night did he do what? What did they do?' It wouldn't have
ended.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the fallout from scandal-related developments has
created an atmosphere where previous thresholds of taste and
political etiquette have been breached.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the impact on children,'' said Arthur Miller, who teaches
political science at the University of Iowa and directs the
Heartland Poll. ``What it means to have a president whom their
parents couldn't talk about because it was embarrassing. Those are
more enduring and go beyond the remaining period of Bill Clinton's
term.''
</P>
<P>
   But the seven months of denials have taken a more immediate and
serious political and personal toll. Because of the president's
defense strategy, the courts have placed him and future presidents
further from Secret Service guardians and personal advisers.
</P>
<P>
   First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton has been his chief defender,
discounting claims of infidelity as a product of a right-wing
conspiracy. The president reportedly told his wife and daughter,
Chelsea, for the first time over the weekend what he was going to
tell the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   The president also denied the stories to his Cabinet. Although
some in the White House were saying that they just wanted to move
on and accomplish the tasks of the administration, others
reportedly were disillusioned and feeling betrayed by his admission
about Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``He put people through hell, including the staff and people who
are my friends,'' Dee Dee Myers, Clinton's former press secretary,
told /{The New York Times./}
</P>
<P>
   Former Republican Congressman Robert Walker said: ``My great
fear is that the trust that the president has to have in order to
govern effectively has been lost. If we find ourselves in a crisis
situation, either domestically or internationally, he won't have
the basis of trust on which to draw.''
</P>
<P>
   The paradox of the political drama that has enthralled
Washington for seven months has been the consistent disinterest by
the public. There may lie the benefit of Clinton's decision to
withhold the truth for so long, and his political salvation.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of the public has always believed that the
president and Lewinsky had sexual relations. But a somewhat smaller
majority also thinks that even if he lied, it does not warrant his
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will still be some who will say, `What's really
upsetting me here is the process. We should have never gone through
this,' '' Miller said. ``But most of the people just want to get
this behind them and be told there was nothing criminal here.''
</P>
<P>
   Don Dixon, a pollster who teaches political science at Sonoma
State University in California, said the drip-drip-drip about
Clinton's alleged transgressions actually might have ``cushioned''
the public to acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all want our public figures to be larger than life,'' Dixon
said. ``It's very disconcerting when they look like us. So when it
comes slowly, well, it's less of a shock.''
</P>
<P>
   And that may be a crucial factor in the way Washington deals
with the effect of the president's admission. There has been little
enthusiasm for this scandal on Capitol Hill, where independent
counsel Kenneth Starr is expected to send his report this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some are fearful that the microscope could be turned on
them,'' said James Slattery, a former Democratic congressman from
Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   But Slattery, who has defended the president, said that
regardless of whether Clinton survives politically, the larger
message may be one that was made obvious a quarter of a century
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole ordeal once again painfully reminds us that truth
is the best policy,'' he said. ``The tragedy of it, if we didn't
learn anything from Watergate, is that truth in Washington will
ultimately be revealed.''

 &HT;    The Colts have found a leader in Manning
 &HT;    By Tom Archdeacon
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ On one side of Cinergy Field on Monday night, you
watched a desperate _ and possibly divisive _ tug of war for the
very heart of a ballclub. On the other, you witnessed a
franchisewide coronation that will help ensure a team's strength
and stability.
</P>
<P>
   Such are the divergent worlds of the Cincinnati Bengals and
Indianapolis Colts less than three weeks before the start of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   While quarterbacks Neil O'Donnell and Jeff Blake wrestle for the
steering wheel of a Bengals team that hasn't been able to stay on
track the past seven seasons, quarterback Peyton Manning is
cementing his place as a cornerstone for what should be a resurgent
Colt team this season.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the two teams that met in Monday night's preseason
exercise have been a lot alike in the 1990s. The Bengals have lost
83 of their 128 regular-season games, the Colts 78. Both have gone
through quarterbacks, coaches and several rebuilding plans.
</P>
<P>
   Quentin Coryatt, who has been a Colts linebacker the past seven
years, put it best: ``I've had three head coaches. I've had four
position coaches. I'm on my third or fourth defensive coordinator.
And God knows how many starting quarterbacks there have been (16 in
the past 14 years). It's made for a lot of new faces. And you can't
win if you keep bringing in new faces.''
</P>
<P>
   The Colts took a big step toward staunching the bleeding by
making Manning the top pick of last April's draft and then getting
him under contract _ thanks to an $11.6 million signing bonus _ for
six years at $48 million.
</P>
<P>
   Already the Colts players are rallying around him. They sang his
praises in the preseason opener when his first NFL pass went for a
48-yard touchdown to Marvin Harrison. They did the same Monday
night when he opened his only half of action by completing his
first three passes for 84 yards, then closing out his night with a
12-yard touchdown pass, again to Harrison.
</P>
<P>
   The Colts like the way the 22-year-old Manning can read defenses
and spot alternate receivers. They like his work ethic _ he spent
so much time in the University of Tennessee film room they
nicknamed him Caveman _ and they're impressed with the confidence
and poise he's shown.
</P>
<P>
   The Colts, several veteran players have said, appear to have
found their leader.
</P>
<P>
   The Bengals should be seeking the same. Then again you remember
Boomer Esiason's parting words last winter. He said Cincinnati was
a team mired by factions and malingers. And in a recent national
magazine story you learn of a scenario that caused Blake's
unraveling last season.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Pickens, as mercurial and me-first of an athlete as you'll
find, began bellyaching in the huddles that Blake wasn't getting
him the ball. Soon that carried over to the dressing room and the
practice field.
</P>
<P>
   Blake tried to salve the situation and began forcing the ball in
Picken's direction every chance he could. Often it was into
coverage and the Bengals offense sputtered and all but stopped
until Esiason took over the last five games of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Bengals got rid of some of their clubhouse problems when
they sent Dan ``Big Daddy'' Wilkinson packing to Washington, but
there still is Pickens, Darney Scott and, according to Esiason,
linebacker James Francis.
</P>
<P>
   The Bengals need a leader and right now they have none. Blake
tries but the role fits him like a pair of shoes two sizes too
small. As for O'Donnell _ who took the Pittsburgh Steelers to Super
Bowl XXX _ he's too busy just trying to win the quarterback job.
Right now _ no matter what coach Bruce Coslet says and especially
after Blake's 0-for-7, one-interception, often-booed start Monday
night _ it's his to lose. If not, Bengals president Mike Brown
wouldn't have signed the veteran to a four-year, $17 million deal.
</P>
<P>
   Although the NFL nearly always provides a black-and-blue baptism
for a rookie quarterback, it seems as if Manning was groomed for
this job his entire life. That's due to his dad, Archie Manning _
the 14-year NFL veteran and last true college football hero.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, Peyton's story is happily infused with his father's
legend. Archie _ the juke-mad, pocket-busting All American
quarterback from Ole Miss _ was a Southern icon. At the University
of Tennessee, Peyton got similar treatment. Even though he had
grown up on his daddy's NFL wealth in a 140-year-old house in New
Orleans' toney Garden District, privilege did not leave him soft or
searching for pop's coattails.
</P>
<P>
   Colts' president Bill Polian claims he watched the tapes of
every pass thrown last season by Manning and Washington State's
Ryan Leaf _ three times _ before having his coaches do the same.
Then he paid NFL brain-trust Bill Walsh to study the two. Every
assessment came up with Manning.
</P>
<P>
   So the Colts go into the season with one man to lead them.
</P>
<P>
   The Bengals, meanwhile, are groping their way through yet
another quarterbacking controversy. Sides are being drawn and the
picture this far into the preseason looks no better than last
year's troubled trek.

 &HT;    Best view of sports was from Murray's eye
 &HT;    By Greg Stoda
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Jim Murray of the Los Angeles Times was,
for my nickels and dimes and quarters and dollars, the best sports
writer in the place. Ever.
</P>
<P>
   He died of cardiac arrest late Sunday. He was 78.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't know me. Once, though, he allowed me to see for him.
To be his eyes. My recollection is that it was during the 1987 U.S.
Open at Olympic Club in San Francisco, but that's not a certainty.
It was a professional golf tournament somewhere, though, and
Murray, his sight weakened, apparently noticed my media
identification while we stood next to each other near the 18th
green.
</P>
<P>
   He asked if I might identify players for him through a few
groups as they completed their rounds. It was a pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   And that's all.
</P>
<P>
   Except, upon hearing the news of his death, another memory
surfaced. It was of one of Murray's columns, which the Los Angeles
Times was kind enough to fax to me Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   If you never read Murray, read this.
</P>
<P>
   If you read Murray and loved his style and once happened to read
this piece, read it again.
</P>
<P>
   OK, bang the drum slowly, professor. Muffle the cymbals and the
laugh track. You might say that Old Blue Eye is back. But that's as
funny as this is going to get.
</P>
<P>
   I feel I owe my friends an explanation as to where I've been all
these weeks. Believe me, I would rather have been in a press box.
</P>
<P>
   I lost an old friend the other day. He was blue eyed, impish, he
cried a lot with me, laughed a lot with me, saw a great many things
with me. I don't know why he left me. Boredom, perhaps.
</P>
<P>
   We read a lot of books together, we did a lot of crossword
puzzles together, we saw films together. He had a pretty exciting
life. He saw Babe Ruth hit a home run when we were both 12 years
old. He saw Willie Mays steal second base, he saw Maury Wills steal
his 104th base. He saw Rocky Marciano get up. I thought he led a
pretty good life.
</P>
<P>
   One night a long time ago he saw this pretty girl who laughed a
lot, played the piano and he couldn't look away from her. Later he
looked on as I married this pretty lady.
</P>
<P>
   He saw her through 34 years. He loved to see her laugh, he loved
to see her happy.
</P>
<P>
   You see, the friend I lost was my eye. My good eye. The other
eye, the right one, we've been carrying for years. We just let him
tag along like Don Quixote's nag. It's been a long time since he
could read the number on a halfback or tell whether a ball was fair
or foul or even tell which fighter was down.
</P>
<P>
   So, one blue eye is missing and the other misses a lot.
</P>
<P>
   So my best friend left me, at least temporarily, in a twilight
world where it's always 8 o'clock on a summer night.
</P>
<P>
   He stole away like a thief in the night and he took a lot with
him. But not everything. He left a lot of memories. He couldn't
take those with him. He just took the future with him and the
present. He couldn't take the past.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know why he had to go. I thought we were pals. I thought
the things we did together we enjoyed doing together. Sure, we
cried together. There were things to cry about.
</P>
<P>
   But it was a long, good relationship, a happy one. It went all
the way back to the days when we arranged all the marbles in a
circle in the dirt in the lots in Connecticut. We played
one-old-cat baseball. We saw curveballs together, trying to hit
them or catch them. We looked through a catcher's mask together. We
were partners in every sense of the word.
</P>
<P>
   He recorded the happy moments, the miracle of children, the
beauty of a Pacific sunset, snowcapped mountains, faces on
Christmas morning. He allowed me to hit fly balls to young sons in
uniforms two sizes too large, to see a pretty daughter march in
halftime parades. He allowed me to see most of the major sports
events of our time. I suppose I should be grateful that he didn't
drift away when I was 12 or 15 or 29 but stuck around over 50 years
until we had a vault of memories. Still, I'm only human. I'd like
to see again, if possible, Rocky Marciano with his nose bleeding,
behind on points and the other guy coming.
</P>
<P>
   I guess I would like to see Reggie Jackson with the count 3 and
2 and the Series on the line, guessing fastball. I guess I'd like
to see Rod Carew with men on first and second and no place to put
him, and the pitcher wishing he were standing in the rain
someplace, reluctant to let go of the ball.
</P>
<P>
   I'd like to see Stan Musial crouched around a curveball one more
time. I'd like to see Don Drysdale trying not to laugh as a young
hitter came up there with both feet in the bucket.
</P>
<P>
   I'd like to see Sandy Koufax just once more facing Willie Mays
with a no-hitter on the line. I'd like to see Maury Wills with a
big lead against a pitcher with a good move. I'd like to see
Roberto Clemente with the ball and a guy trying to go from first to
third. I'd like to see Pete Rose sliding into home headfirst.
</P>
<P>
   I'd like once more to see Henry Aaron standing there with that
bat, a study in deadlines. I'd like to see Bob Gibson scowling at a
hitter as if he had some nerve just to pick up a bat. I'd like to
see Elroy Hirsch going out for a long one from Bob Waterfield,
Johnny Unitas in high-cuts picking apart a zone defense. I'd like
to see Casey Stengel walking to the mound on gnarled old legs to
take the pitcher out, beckoning his gnarled old finger behind his
back.
</P>
<P>
   I'd like to see Sugar Ray Robinson or Muhammad Ali giving a
recital, a ballet, not a fight. Also, to be sure, I'd like to see a
sky full of stars, moonlight on the water, and yes, the tips of a
royal flush peeking out as I fan a poker hand, and yes, a straight
two-foot putt.
</P>
<P>
   Come to think of it, I'm lucky. I saw all of those things. I see
them yet.
</P>
<P>
   He was the best sports writer in the place, and I was once his
eyes.

   CLINTON-DENIAL _ (Washington) _ The American public Monday
finally got President Clinton's long-delayed answer to a very
personal question. Now another question might be: Could this mess
all have been over seven months ago, almost before it even began?
By DAVID GOLDSTEIN. 30 inches. Story will move in the ``a''
category.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-WOMEN _ (Kansas City, Mo.) _ For better. For worse. For
seven months, many American women have stuck with President
Clinton. He may have broken his vows to his wife, they said, but he
was faithful to causes important to them. And at least some said
they did not care what Clinton told a grand jury Monday. They like
his policies; they want the investigation to be over. By JEAN
BUCHANAN AND MATTHEW SCHOFIELD. 27 inches. Story will run in the
``a'' category.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-MEDIA _ (Kansas City, Mo.) _ Tom Brokaw interrupted his
lunch for it. Peter Jennings cut short his summer vacation to be on
hand for it. It, of course, was Monday's deposition by the
president in the Monica Lewinsky matter _ or as the cable news
channels refer to it, the Lewinsky story. And everyone who was
anyone in TV news seemed to be in Washington covering the story. By
AARON BARNHART. 20 inches. Story will run in the ``l'' category.
</P>
<P>
   GUS-COLUMN (Undated) _ Perhaps you have noticed the way
``national news'' is defined as anything that happens within
commuting distance of the island of Manhattan. California also
comes in for occasional notice, but only in times of earthquake,
riot and mud slide, or when freak waves carry off the beachfront
homes of entertainers. 16 inches. By C.W. GUSEWELLE. Story will
move in the ``k'' category.

HUMILIATION COULD BE PART OF CLINTON'S LEGACY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CRAGG HINES 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   President Clinton has confessed. Now for the fallout.
</P>
<P>
   Although Clinton tried to close the curtain on his sordid,
extramarital affair, he and the nation will now be jarred by the
inevitable cascade of legal, political and personal consequences
that flow from the president's decision to own up to his
long-denied sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The extraordinary events of Monday will affect Clinton's
leadership at home and abroad, almost certainly hobbling and
possibly crippling him. The coming days will gravely test Clinton's
repeatedly demonstrated ability to rebound from personal and
political crisis _ and, in this instance, humiliation.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his continuing high job-approval ratings, ``lame duck''
does not begin to describe Clinton's problem as he faces the 28
months remaining in his term.
</P>
<P>
   In his public statement, the president could not bring himself
to state clearly that he had sex with Lewinsky and lied to the
American people about it. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; No matter how Clinton sought to explain his agitated,
finger-waving denials in January, it is clear that he did not tell
the truth about 18 months of repeated intimate encounters with the
former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   The veneer of moral authority on his presidency was already
thin, and today probably has been worn away entirely.
</P>
<P>
   This leaves Clinton politically naked to friends and enemies
alike, and, depending on the public reaction to the president's
address, they will not be shy about taking advantage of it.
</P>
<P>
   At minimum, Clinton faces an increased question of credibility.
For years, he has been known as a hair-splitting lawyer-politician
whose every word should be weighed as much for what is being
withheld as for what is being disclosed. His testimony and
statement Monday put new emphasis on this point, and will make his
attempts to press on with work at home and abroad more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a year ago, Clinton was questing after a grandiose
legacy. Now he faces entering the history books as an asterisk
likely to bring a smirk and snicker from future generations. That
is an utterly galling prospect for a man who has dreamed about the
presidency throughout his adult life.
</P>
<P>
   As things stand now _ admittedly with more than two years left
on his White House lease _ Clinton can point to no initiative or
achievement that is likely to overcome the shadow of the Lewinsky
affair.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's public apology came with the earnest, polished, human
delivery that is his trademark. It also came with an attempt to
wall off his private life, which may be too much to ask of even a
generally supportive American public.
</P>
<P>
   Many Americans are softies for a contrite confession and a
suggested promise to sin no more _ although some may feel they've
heard this from Clinton one time too many in regards to
extramarital sex. The president may be helped through the coming
days by the realization that the public's heavy discounting of
Clinton's character helped get him to the White House and may keep
him there.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's greatest advantage at the moment is that the nation,
which did not believe his denials of a sexual affair, is tired of
the tawdry tale.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Clinton delivered his personal apology to the nation
and plea to move on, his lawyer, David Kendall, sought to feed the
widely held view that it is time for independent counsel Kenneth
Starr's four-year, $40 million inquiry to end.
</P>
<P>
   Only if Starr can come up with solid proof of a sustained
attempt by Clinton to obstruct justice in the Lewinsky matter is
the public likely to rally behind any attempt to impeach the
president and remove him from office.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is sticking to that part of his story, and the burden is
on Starr. The sexual questions may have been the most personally
difficult part of the president's closed-circuit appearance before
the grand jury, but inquiries about whether he participated in
cooking up a cover-up would have been the trickiest.
</P>
<P>
   This is key, at least far as public feeling stands now. A Zogby
America Poll conducted over the weekend found that the only
circumstance under which a majority of Americans would favor
impeachment is if Clinton engaged in ``a pattern of obstruction of
justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans in Congress, many of whom would like Clinton's head
on a platter, will be guided by the public reaction as they ponder
what, if any action to take against Clinton. With the Republican
hold on Congress, especially in the more politically volatile
House, so tenuous and elections less than three months hence, GOP
leaders may be inclined to let Clinton limp through his remaining
months in office.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans who, for their own benefit, proved so legislatively
accommodating with Clinton in the days before the 1996 presidential
election, will be less ready to deal with the White House now.
Clinton's ability to advance his agenda _ or even to focus on it _
since the Lewinsky matter came to light has been negligible.
Monday's dramatic developments will not improve his chances.
</P>
<P>
   For many Democrats, Monday was a sad day of reckoning. Among the
most doleful sights on a gray day in Washington was White House
aides and fellow Democrats who had believed _ or wanted to believe
_ the president's denials and had staunchly defended him.
</P>
<P>
   They felt betrayed as they wrestled with the realization that
Clinton had risked his presidency for gratuitous sex. This was what
had so troubled George Stephanopoulos, the former close adviser to
Clinton, who refused to defend the president as the Lewinsky affair
began to unfold.
</P>
<P>
   Stephanopoulos said Monday that Clinton's actions were ``a
breach of trust.'' He had a lot of company in holding that view.

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Aug. 18:
</P>
<P>
   If a grudging admission of sexual indiscretion with Monica
Lewinsky and another angry attack on Kenneth Starr could end the
crisis in his presidency, then Bill Clinton finished his
five-minute address to the nation Monday night in good shape.
</P>
<P>
   But by our lights, Clinton let slip a vital chance to give a
healing report to the nation and to begin the task of
rehabilitating his character in the eyes of the public. Instead he
went for the time-tested blend of minimal confession and contained
tantrum that got him elected twice, but will not make him a leader
who will be missed once he leaves Washington.
</P>
<P>
   By his lawyer's account, Clinton used another vintage technique
during his four hours of grand jury testimony, refusing to answer
questions that did not suit him. The outcome is hardly satisfactory
for those who had hoped Clinton would meet this challenge in a less
characteristic way.
</P>
<P>
   What the nation got instead was another blast of the familiar
dichotomous blarney. His touching admission of lying to his wife
was coupled with the insulting contention that his earlier denial,
under oath, of a sexual relationship was ``legally accurate.''
</P>
<P>
   What an opportunity was wasted Monday night for Clinton to shed
the wearisome burden of all those ever-changing accounts of
personal behavior that have characterized his political career for
so many years. But from the moment the 42nd president walked into
the Map Room he was in a confrontation with a force far more
insidious than Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   In that hallowed room, Clinton was also confronting the habit
that has driven _ and haunted _ his political career in an almost
addictive way. His habit of stonewalling, of misleading by omission
or concealment or fabrication or failure of memory has been the
source of virtually all this administration's troubles.
</P>
<P>
   For the past seven months the stonewall has crumbled faster than
Clinton, his wife and his lawyer, David Kendall, could patch it.
The full truth is a potent weapon but it is not one Clinton is used
to handling, even in the most personal settings. There were many
reports Monday that he had sent Hillary Rodham Clinton out to bash
his critics as political conspirators without telling her the facts
of the Lewinsky situation. Some White House staff members who had
believed him felt betrayed by the flood of inoculating leaks last
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   We do not yet know what rendition of the truth Clinton spoke in
more than five hours with the grand jury. For that reason, only he
knows at this moment whether he can climb out of this mess by
grasping the lifeline that Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, has repeatedly
thrown him. Hatch, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, was
insulted by the attack on Starr, but he still seemed willing to
help Clinton provided that no evidence of serious illegalities
emerges and, in his view, ``that's a big if.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed it is, for the American people as well as for Congress.
That brings us again to something only Clinton knows to a moral
certainty about what did and did not happen. If he conspired with
Lewinsky to testify falsely or if he had others seek employment for
her toward the same end, then Clinton went into his meeting Monday
as a man who could probably not break free of his worst impulses,
even if he could summon the courage. When perjury enters the
picture, the truth that might have been his salvation becomes his
enemy.
</P>
<P>
   This is an odd moment in American political history, but not a
frivolous one. Here was a man of compassionate impulse and lofty
ambition who went to Washington with virtually every imaginable
political skill except one. He seemed to think he was immune from a
rule that leaps out from any reading of modern presidencies.
Everything comes out sooner or later.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, all the details of what he said Monday will begin
coming out. In these first moments, we are getting a few pieces in
the jigsaw picture of this presidency. Clinton could have shaped
that process by speaking fully and from his heart. He chose not to,
but he cannot stop the process of revelation in which he
participated Monday. By and by, we will see entire the lineaments
of Clinton's fate and his standing among the presidents.
</P>
<P>
   It can never be what he and the nation hoped, for he long ago
chose to manipulate the narrative of his political life in such a
way that it was necessary for him to remember everything he said
along the way. What we will know in time, of course, is whether he
has so falsified his conversation with the American people that he
could not, even in the hour of his greatest peril and through the
simple agency of truth, position himself to receive their
forgiveness.

SOME CITIES IMAGINE THE WORLD CARES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By C.W. GUSEWELLE  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star   (Kansas City, Mo.) _ Perhaps you have
noticed the way ``national news'' is defined as anything that
happens within commuting distance of the island of Manhattan.
<TEXT>
<P>
   California also comes in for occasional notice, but only in
times of earthquake, riot and mud slide, or when freak waves carry
off the beachfront homes of entertainers.
</P>
<P>
   If the middle regions of the country get mentioned at all, it is
in connection with outbreaks of tick fever and head lice, or public
manifestations by Ku Kluxers _ items which reinforce the notion
that the candle of civilization does not throw its light far
inland.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, however, no event is too trifling to rate
prime-time network coverage. The bias is understandable, since the
principal news organizations are based there.
</P>
<P>
   However the result, as seen from afar, borders on the grotesque.
</P>
<P>
   Political races in New York are reported in such detail as to
confound the 33 out of 34 Americans who neither live there nor give
a hoot who carries away the booty.
</P>
<P>
   The financial woes of the city are covered as though a slip in
its municipal bond rating might cost the rest of us our sleep.
</P>
<P>
   The lecheries, failed unions and rancorous divorces of various
celebrities and stars are chronicled as solemnly as the fall of
monarchies.
</P>
<P>
   Junkies, panderers and transvestites thronging Times Square are
offered as proof of decaying American morality, the woe of the
underclass, the triumph of deviancy or some other national
affliction.
</P>
<P>
   It is the city of Wall Street, the city of puts and calls. It
calls for our undivided attention, and puts forth the myth of
itself.
</P>
<P>
   One day recently, the lead story on a national newscast was what
the commentator _ or, to be precise, the news reader _ described as
an attack on the motorcade of the New York mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Then it turned out that the so-called attacker was unarmed.
</P>
<P>
   Then it was revealed that his ``attack'' consisted of running up
to the line of cars and pounding with his fists on the window of a
municipal truck until he was seized by police.
</P>
<P>
   From his screams of outrage, it was deduced that this solitary,
unarmed urban terrorist was protesting the lamentable state of some
of the city's public services. Authorities afterward described him
as deranged, although, given the state of things there, it sounded
like perfectly reasonable behavior.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the incident was so trivial that the mayor, riding
in another vehicle, may not even have noticed it. But evidently it
was information the rest of America could not do without.
</P>
<P>
   The telling of the day's events by the Eastern cabal of
communicators is a most peculiar exercise.
</P>
<P>
   They remind me of an editor I once knew who defined news as
anything he could see from his office window or heard about over
lunch. A tree limb down across the street he habitually drove along
to work rated page one coverage.
</P>
<P>
   His was the very essence of self-absorption _ no great sin if
you're a local or regional journalist, but ludicrous if you imagine
you're speaking to the world.
</P>
<P>
   Curious, isn't it, that the most powerful voices in the land
should be, after all, so relentlessly /{provincial/}.

GRUDZIELANEK HASN'T BEEN A HIT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ Since he was acquired from Montreal on the July 31
trading deadline, Mark Grudzielanek has been more flip-flop than
just a flop.
</P>
<P>
   In four years with the Expos, he was an all-hit, no-field
shortstop, with 201 hits in 1996 and a record-tying 54 doubles in
1997. But he also led the majors in errors the past two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Although he went 2 for 3 against Atlanta on Sunday, he has
struggled at the plate since his arrival. In addition to his .237
average as a Dodger, Grudzielanek has an on-base percentage of just
.247, which factors in hits and walks with plate appearances.
</P>
<P>
   The club wasn't expecting Grudzielanek to match Mark McGwire's
league-leading .472 or even teammate Gary Sheffield's .424.
</P>
<P>
   ``From what I've seen, this guy is a hitter,'' third-base coach
Joey Amalfitano said. ``I've watched him turn on some pitches and
that will translate into home runs. It's a tough time for an
adjustment period, but he is in the middle of one.''
</P>
<P>
   Defensively, however, Grudzielanek has been impressive,
committing just one error in his first 15 games. Spread out over an
entire season, that translates into just over 10 errors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming here has been an adjustment, I'll admit that,''
Grudzielanek said. ``It seems like there has been a lot of
adjustments around here this year.''
</P>
<P>
   And there could be more. Opening Day shortstop Jose Vizcaino,
sidelined since severely spraining his right ankle June 20, might
be back by Sept. 1. Although Vizcaino is on the Dodgers' weeklong
trip to Pittsburgh, Florida and Atlanta, his on-field movements are
limited.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's made a lot of progress, but there is a lot he still can't
do,'' manager Glenn Hoffman said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Grudzielanek's strong defensive showing, Vizcaino has
the better glove and superior range. He has four errors in 67
games. Grudzielanek made 23 in his 105 games with the Expos.
</P>
<P>
   With eight homers and 45 RBI, Grudzielanek has enough offense to
play second or third. But Eric Young is the leadoff hitter and had
14 hits in the homestand. Bobby Bonilla is expected to start
tonight at third base against Pittsburgh, but the club still wants
to see what Adrian Beltre can do.
</P>
<P>
   These are issues that will be juggled during the final six weeks
of the season but figured out during the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   Quick hits: Even if this road trip goes poorly and the team
drops farther back in the wild-card race, the Dodgers should draw
three million fans this season for the 13th time in club history.
Through Sunday's game they have drawn 2,321,695 and an average of
39,216 through 60 dates. They would need to average just over
30,000 in the final 21 home dates. They have nine games with San
Francisco, New York and San Diego....
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Ismael Valdes, sidelined since July 27 with a
strained left side muscle, will throw tonight in the bullpen here
and if all goes well he could face a few batters for the first
time. Since the minor-league season has just two weeks to run,
Valdes is not expected to get many, if any, rehabilitation starts.
He is finally throwing off a mound, however.

PRO BEACH VOLLEYBALL MELTING AWAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DANA HADDAD  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HERMOSA BEACH _ The professional volleyball tour made an
unfortunate discovery last winter.
</P>
<P>
   The endless summer is a myth.
</P>
<P>
   When it all started in the 1970s, accelerated in the '80s and
skyrocketed in the early '90s, those at the controls saw only
upside and prosperity. They saw no sunset, no autumn, no cold
winter on the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   Summer has returned with the sun and 90-degree temperatures
greeting the sole survivors of this sport, the Association of
Volleyball Professionals. The AVP is barely hanging on, as the
Miller Lite U.S. Championships, which culminated here on Sunday,
has plunged from a $300,000 grand slam to a $50,000 tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Years of poor management forced the Women's Professional
Volleyball Association to scrap its 12-year-old women's doubles
tour and the American Beach Volleyball League to disband its
7-year-old men's and women's four-on-four circuit this year. Both
were overcome by debt.
</P>
<P>
   The AVP, facing similar problems, played a 21-tournament
schedule. The players are taking the brunt of it. Up to as much as
$4 million four years ago, the AVP prize money the AVP this year is
$1.3 million for the entire schedule, or $50,000 per tournament.

<P>
   Harry Usher, who in January replaced Jerry Solomon as interim
chief executive officer, told AVP players in March to take a pay
cut or find a new way to make a living.
</P>
<P>
   ``They understood that if they did not ... there was no way the
tour could continue beyond May,'' Usher said. ``And, two, they
could look around and see what happened to the women.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we'll get back to the $4 million-prize money in
the very near future. I don't think it should ever get back to $4
million.... I think prize money has been paid when it should not
have been paid. This operation has never had money. It's always
gone into the next year running on fumes.''
</P>
<P>
   More than ever, said Usher, the former CEO of the 1984 Olympics
and president of the United States Football League, the AVP has
turned into a survival of the fittest.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows this better than Matt Unger. Unger, a five-year
pro, led the Cal State Northridge men's indoor team to the NCAA
championship match in 1993. At 5-foot-11, he is one of the smallest
players on the AVP. He has never won a tournament or been ranked in
the top 10 but has managed to scratch out more than $113,000 in the
four years before this season.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the cutback in prize money, which meant only the top
17 finishers instead of the previous 25 collected checks. Unger is
ranked No.32 and has struggled to earn a little over $5,000 this
year. Tour money-leader Karch Kiraly has pocketed $97,781.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's taking its toll on me a little bit,'' Unger said. ``I've
been playing hard, I've lost some close games and the money's not
as good as it used to be. It's a little more frustrating.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a battle out here for everybody, not just for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Unger is more fortunate than some. He has a sponsor who pays his
travel costs. But it's those long flights to Florida, Texas, New
Jersey and Wisconsin that have made Unger ponder his future.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot more thinking about what's going on with this
sport,'' Unger said, ``and where this sport is going.''
</P>
<P>
   What happened to beach volleyball nobody was able to predict,
especially in the early '90s when it was peaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody got caught up in it, but nobody looked down the
road, for when it would cool off,'' said Rick Hazeltine, former
editor of Volleyball magazine. ``For most sponsors, beach
volleyball was just a hot commodity. When you're hot, people jump
on the bandwagon. When you cool off, they jump off.''
</P>
<P>
   Sponsors peddling lifestyle products like clothing and
sunglasses have abandoned beach volleyball for the X Games,
Hazeltine said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without belittling the X Games, it's sort of faddish,'' Usher
said. ``This is an established sport, an Olympic-medal sport.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, said Hazeltine, the pro tours should have recognized that
sponsors are fickle and can shift their support to the latest
trend.
</P>
<P>
   ``They weren't ready when the downturn came. It always comes,''
Hazeltine said. ``They weren't ready to protect themselves. They
didn't project to where they wanted to be.''
</P>
<P>
   These days were hard to forecast, especially after the sport's
popularity peaked when Kiraly and Kent Steffes defeated Mike Dodd
and Mike Whitmarsh for the first Olympic gold medal in men's beach
volleyball in 1996. Not even Hazeltine, who was on staff at the
Atlanta Games and witnessed a wildly successful fan turnout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't know why,'' he said. ``But you've seen it
happen to surfing. In the early '90s, it wasn't cool to wear
surfware anymore. Volleyball and surfing are fringe sports and they
go through cycles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tennis is in a huge dip and it's not a fringe sport. Golf was
until Tiger Woods. The X Games will have a downturn.''
</P>
<P>
   The AVP has its share of positive stories this year, like
Kiraly's assault on Sinjin Smith's record 139 tournament
championships. Kiraly, 37, has 136 and continues to make a strong
comeback from major shoulder surgery in '97.
</P>
<P>
   But the tour has had controversy on the sand and in the
courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   Brazilians Emmanuel Rego, Roberto Lopes and Franco Neto have
come on the scene to the dismay of some. Veteran players are
quietly grumbling, saying the AVP should not have allowed newcomers
any share of what has become precious little prize money.
</P>
<P>
   Steffes has filed two suits. In one, he seeks the $55,000 in '97
prize money yet to be paid him. That suit against the AVP will go
to court later this month. In his other suit, Steffes cites a
conflict of interest by players who served on the '97 board of
directors. Included is his old partner, Kiraly.
</P>
<P>
   Usher has promised that the players will eventually receive all
their back pay, but there is no timetable.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys are pretty good guys who are pretty well
educated,'' Usher said. ``And they have pretty good judgment _ with
the exception of one (Steffes).''
</P>
<P>
   Most disturbing is the growing rumor that longtime title sponsor
Miller Brewing Company will not be back next season. New board
member Unger is optimistic that, should Miller sever ties, the AVP
will be able to acquire a new flagship. He said 25 prospective new
sponsors were watching the proceedings at Hermosa Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Good news for anybody who now realizes the endless summer is
merely a concept, not a reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to keep the sport going as long as I can go,'' Unger
said, ``because it's given me five good years of volleyball and an
unbelievable life.''

WOMEN'S TOUR HAS TOPPLED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DANA HADDAD  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Linda Chisholm emerged last year as one of the more noteworthy
stories on Women's Professional Beach Volleyball Association Tour _
a founding member of her sport, who had fallen out of favor,
returning to make amends.
</P>
<P>
   At 39, the Birmingham High graduate and Van Nuys resident teamed
with Deb Richardson (36) to form the tour's oldest team. They both
finished in the top 10, placing as high as third in one event.
</P>
<P>
   Based on her performance, Chisholm had her sights set on another
season. Then the curtain suddenly came down.
</P>
<P>
   The WPVA, after firing president Nancy Lengel and promoting
assistant David Williams at the beginning of the season, ceased
operation in March. Chisholm and other players had been optimistic
to that point. But Williams failed to sign any of the handful of
companies interested in replacing Evian as title sponsor and chief
financier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another year goes by and another year you get older,''
Chisholm said. ``I don't think I'm ready to retire yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Two wealthy entrepreneurs, Charlie Jackson and Eric Spector,
stepped forward last spring with plans to save the tour, but both
pulled out because of infighting among the players. Many of them,
like Chisholm, had steered this sport from their seats on the board
of directors.
</P>
<P>
   Now women's pro beach volleyball is no longer a sport _ at least
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The death of the WPVA, said Chisholm and other veterans, can be
traced to decisions made by an unqualified, player-run board of
directors.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't help but start serving your own interest once you
step over to the business side,'' said Liz Masakayan, a UCLA alumna
who played with Chisholm in the Olympics before starting her beach
career. ``It's human nature.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough to keep your mind on the business when you're
playing,'' Chisholm said. ``We followed the (Association of
Volleyball Professionals) footsteps that way. We fell first.''
</P>
<P>
   The AVP survives _ barely _ because it managed to retain its
title sponsor, Miller Brewing Company. The WVPA wasn't so
fortunate. So top U.S. women like Holly McPeak, Lisa Arce, Nancy
Reno and Barbra Fontana have shifted to the Federation
Internationale de Volleyball, a world tour that limits U.S.
participants. Chisholm and many other players, who were the
backbone of the WPVA, are left with scraps.
</P>
<P>
   And there haven't been many morsels. Chisholm has played in two
events this summer while hoping that promoters who promised
smaller-scale, one-time tournaments in Southern California keep
their word. The American Volleyball League this week canceled one
of those events.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm playing two or three times a week just to stay in shape,''
Chisholm said. ``It's been kind of like, `OK. Let's keep in touch
with the ball.' Whatever comes up, you're ready for it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Reno, who is playing on the FIVB tour, doesn't understand how it
came to this. ``The talent has never been better. The product is at
its peak. It seemed like the sport had so much momentum,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Chisholm is supporting herself by working as a personal trainer
in a Brentwood fitness club and tutoring young beach players. She
believes the women's doubles tour will re-emerge. And when that
happens, Chisholm hopes it remembers the beach-party atmosphere
that made the sport so popular.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to go back to retro volleyball in the '70s and go
crazy,'' she said. ``As bad as it sounds, sex sells. A lot of women
go see the men play because they're gorgeous. And it's the same
with women.''
</P>
<P>
   Except, of course, they aren't playing.

<P>
   Bill Clinton looked exhausted and sounded as defiant as a
regretful man could in his four-minute speech last night. It was
not the familiar, soulful Bill Clinton who turned up, not the one
who knows how to look a camera in the eye, but a far more
reluctant-sounding person. But every poll in the last week had told
the president that he had to make this speech, and he appeared as
reluctant as if the American people had subpoenaed him.
</P>
<P>
   No one expected much in the nature of revelation. Every poll in
the last months had also told him that most Americans assumed he
had had sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky and had lied about
it. So amid the vague admission of ``misleading people,'' the
acceptance of responsibility and the bitterness at Kenneth Starr's
investigation, came a line that is central to the whole crisis: ``I
ask you to turn away from the spectacle of the last seven months,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   And when he insisted, ``I intend to reclaim my family life for
my family,'' this media-made president was virtually attacking the
culture of celebrity that helped create him.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton-Lewinsky scandal has been shaped by videotape,
television and the trappings of entertainment. Some tapes have been
replayed so often they are as familiar as family photographs: Bill
Clinton hugging Monica Lewinsky at a public reception; his
finger-wagging denial that ``I did not have sexual relations with
that woman.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the grand jury heard and saw his testimony on
closed-circuit video monitors. It was totally fitting that at the
end of the day, he finally spoke directly to the public on
television.
</P>
<P>
   It is necessary to go back to 1952 and Richard Nixon's
desperate, career-saving Checkers speech to find the original
ancestor of Clinton's speech on Monday. Nixon's appearance was a
defining moment not just in that presidential campaign, but also in
the use of a televised speech as a political life preserver.
</P>
<P>
   And despite similarities, the distance between the Checkers and
the Clinton speeches may be even more revealing, suggesting how
drastically the political and television landscape has changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't easy to come before a nationwide audience and air
your life as I have done,'' Nixon, then a senator, said in the
almost eerie foreboding of the Clinton speech. Accused of having a
slush fund and about to be dumped from the Republican ticket as
Eisenhower's vice-presidential candidate, Nixon bypassed the
politicos and reporters and spoke to the people. He justified the
legality of the fund, just as Clinton insisted he had not lied
under oath or told anyone else to.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon started out sounding apologetic and then turned defiant,
charging his opponents with ``smearing'' him, just as Clinton
quickly turned his attention bitterly to the long investigation by
Starr and to what he considers an invasion of privacy.
</P>
<P>
   But the true importance of the Checkers speech existed in the
way it shifted Nixon's image: from on-the-ropes politician to
family man and political survivor. Nixon said he would not return
the one personal gift, the dog named Checkers, that his daughters
loved. He ended by asking the public to ``wire and write'' the
Republican National Committee (which had bought the air time for
his speech) to say whether he should stay on the ticket. It worked.
</P>
<P>
   Television, which would treat Nixon so brutally eight years
later when he debated John F. Kennedy, was kinder to him in those
early days. Eventually, Nixon thoroughly lost his instinct for
televised political theater, as his pantheon of sound bites came to
include ``You won't have Nixon to kick around anymore'' and ``I am
not a crook.''
</P>
<P>
   The Checkers speech seems primitive by today's standards. Nixon
sits behind a desk most of the time, stiffly; there is little eye
contact with the camera. Not far below the surface, in hindsight,
is the snappish Nixon of the Watergate years.
</P>
<P>
   Today, of course, we live in a culture of sound bites and
confessions. It says much about our celebrity culture that the
actor Hugh Grant's apology for a sexual indiscretion on ``The
Tonight Show'' provides a closer parallel to Clinton's effort to
reclaim his privacy and his presidency through this speech.
</P>
<P>
   But videotape has dogged Clinton even as he has used it to
escape. Among the endless replays in the saturation television
coverage have been Hillary Rodham Clinton on the ``Today'' show
defending her husband, and a raft of Clinton supporters insisting
he did not have an affair with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   A succinct report by Sam Donaldson on an ABC special on Sunday
night quickly trotted out several examples of public finessing in
Clinton's past. ``I'm really sorry for that,'' a young,
brown-haired Bill Clinton tells the people of Arkansas about a tax
increase during his first term as governor. He tells reporters it
never occurred to him to mention that he had gotten a draft notice.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, there was his most famous example of
television-as-life-preserver. ``That allegation is false,'' he told
``60 Minutes'' in 1992 about Gennifer Flowers' claim that she had a
12-year affair with him.
</P>
<P>
   But no one really expects the spectacle to end. Hours before
Monday night's speech, it was already being leaked and spun. As
Claire Shipman of NBC put it, ``the expected message: regret, but
perhaps not a formal apology.''
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Jackson spoke of Mrs. Clinton's ``unconditional love'' for
her husband and, anticipating the president's own line of attack,
wondered how different things would have been ``if we'd had a
special prosecutor outside the bedrooms of Jefferson, Roosevelt and
Eisenhower.'' Instant polls showed positive results for Clinton.
The story is far from over.
</P>
<P>
   What is clear is that one has to know how to use television.
What was Linda Tripp's ``I am you'' statement after her testimony
before the Starr grand jury but a clumsy attempt at a Nixonian,
Checkers-like image readjustment? The glare of all those television
cameras, the mercilessness of videotape, has made image-shifting
harder to achieve than ever.

RIGOROUS COURSE FOR COURSE CAREER

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Randy Cardoza worried about his future. After
investing nine years in the Navy, budget cuts and downsizing forced
him to look for a new job.
</P>
<P>
   At 33, he was an unemployed aviation technician with no real
plan for the rest of his life.
</P>
<P>
   Except that he wanted to play as much golf as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Well who doesn't?
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest,'' he said, ``I didn't know exactly what I wanted
to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Cardoza's love for golf convinced him to take a
gamble that, if it paid off, would allow him to accomplish two
goals: find a new career and satisfy his fondness for golf.
</P>
<P>
   Cardoza enrolled in San Diego Golf Academy, a two-year
management and instructional college designed to prepare students
for all facets of the golf industry.
</P>
<P>
   The price was steep, $15,000 for the 16-month program, but
Cardoza's friends and family urged him to give it a try.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually they were all pretty envious,'' Cardoza said. ``They
knew I was doing something that I loved to do. They all thought it
was great.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardoza, now 38, is a customer-service supervisor for Titleist
in San Diego. Although he's not convinced that attending the
academy is the reason he landed a job in golf, it certainly didn't
hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it helped me the most as far as networking,'' Cardoza
said. ``You meet so many people who are in the golf industry while
you're there.''
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1974, the academy has grown from one San Diego campus
to additional schools in Phoenix, Myrtle Beach and Orlando. Each
location includes classrooms, computer labs, club repair shops.
Students have practice and playing privileges at a wide selection
of nearby courses.
</P>
<P>
   ``When students graduate, they are on the fast track to a career
in golf,'' said academy CEO Peter Towell.
</P>
<P>
   Students can earn associates degrees in two programs _ the first
a business degree, which offers areas of emphasis in golf
professional and general manager, and the second in academic and
golf training (AGT), which combines industry-specific educational
courses with training in the basic and advanced skills of golf.
</P>
<P>
   The emphasis is on practice and supervised play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the best two years of my life,'' said Doug Mertz, a
1995 graduate who runs the pro shop at Rancho Santa Fe Farms Golf
Course. ``Obviously, nothing beats actual hands-on experience. But
you're going to school for something you love, you get to play golf
all the time and you're making contacts.''
</P>
<P>
   Each program is two academic years in length. Graduates receive
six credits toward the 36 credits needed for certification as a PGA
teaching professional.
</P>
<P>
   Students can choose from a wide range of course offerings,
including golf course management, physical education (rules of
golf, short game and putting techniques, planning and organization
of tournament golf, clinic planning); marketing, business
management and communication skills.
</P>
<P>
   A typical week consists of classroom work, practice and
tournament play.
</P>
<P>
   Although Rob Camacho is content with his decision to enroll in
SDGA, he isn't sure he'd do it again. Camacho, a 1994 graduate and
now a teaching professional at Oaks North Golf Course in San Diego,
is confident he would have made it anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Camacho admits the contacts he made in school have been
essential.
</P>
<P>
   ``Between the education I got and the people I met, it was an
invaluable experience,'' said Robert Bunn, tournament director at
Torrey Pines Golf Club. ``I've got friends all over the world that
I keep in touch with. And I'll tell you, I had a blast going there.
It's just like going to college, only you're playing golf all day.
What can be better than that?''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the early days of the Monica Lewinsky
investigation, Vice President Al Gore strongly defended President
Clinton against all allegations of wrongdoing, saying he was a
strong and honest leader whom he was proud to work with.
</P>
<P>
   But as the investigation dragged on, Gore adopted a somewhat
modified approach to defending the president, saying instead that
Clinton had denied any wrongdoing and that there appeared to be no
reason to question that denial.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, after the president appeared on nationwide
television and admitted that he had been less than forthcoming
about his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, Gore, whose political
hopes in the year 2000 could well depend on the outcome of the
Lewinsky investigation, once again spoke out strongly in defense of
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am proud of him,'' he said in a statement issued by his
office, ``not only because he is a friend, but because he is a
person who has had the courage to acknowledge mistakes. I am
honored to work with this great president on his agenda for the
nation and I believe it is time to put this matter behind us once
and for all and move forward with the business of the United States
of America.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore is on vacation in Hawaii, about as far away from
Washington, the president and the grand jury as he could get and
still be in one of the 50 states. According to Monday night's
statement, he called the president after his television appearance
and said that he and his wife, Tipper, have Clinton ``in our hearts
and in our prayers.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Devlin, a press aide to Mrs. Gore, said the Gores had
gone to Hawaii for a work break that had been ``in planning'' for
at least three months.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vice president and his family always take a two-week
vacation at this time of year,'' Ms. Devlin said. ``He's staying at
a private home on one of the islands _ we're not saying which one _
and his schedule is private except that on August 25 he'll do a
Democratic fund-raiser in Honolulu and also will speak to a meeting
of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal
Employees.''
</P>
<P>
   Did he spend the day on the beach or next to the TV?
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing on that,'' Ms. Devlin replied.
</P>
<P>
   The Gores arrived in the islands on Aug. 11 and will depart on
Aug. 26 for San Francisco, where they will participate in several
Democratic Party events before returning to Washington on August
28. Ms. Devlin said the couple have a sentimental attachment to
Hawaii, having spent their honeymoon there in 1970 and having
returned a number of times.
</P>
<P>
   At one point on Wednesday, the Gores were spotted swimming with
pet dolphins in a pool at the Hilton Waikoloa Village on the island
of Hawaii _ but not until after security personnel had plunged in
first to check things out.
</P>
<P>
   When Gore meets with Hawaii Democrats on August 25, he likely
will face a warm and eager audience.
</P>
<P>
   Hawaii has traditionally been heavily dominated by Democrats.
But because of cutbacks in military spending, a decline in the farm
sector and a sharp falloff in tourism from Asia, the state is one
of the few that face economic hard times, and polls indicate that,
as a result, Democratic candidates throughout the islands will need
all the help they can get in this year's elections.

NATURALIZED LATINOS SURPRISE IN ISSUE-FILLED '96 POLLS, REPORT
SAYS

   LOS ANGELES _ In a reversal of normal voting trends, Latino
naturalized U.S. citizens voted at a higher rate than Latino
native-born U.S. citizens did in the November 1996 election,
according to a Census Bureau report.
</P>
<P>
   Since native-born citizens usually vote at a higher rate than
naturalized citizens of the same racial or ethnic group, some
analysts said controversial ballot issues such as welfare reform
and California's Proposition 187 might have accounted for the
difference in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The census report, and the unusual voting pattern it describes,
stand in contrast to previous studies that show older, wealthier
and better educated voters are more likely to turn out on election
days than younger, poorer and less educated voters _ which
naturalized immigrants tend to be, said Census Bureau analyst
Loretta Bass, co-author of the report.
</P>
<P>
   The report, ``Voting and Registration in the Election of
November 1996,'' represents the first time census officials divided
voters into categories of native-born and naturalized, said Bass,
who has a doctorate degree in sociology.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should be careful about concluding anything'' based on the
data, she said. ``We're not sure if this is a new trend.''
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau didn't delve into explanations.
</P>
<P>
   More than half of Latino naturalized U.S. citizens _ 53 percent
_ voted in the fall 1996 election compared to 42 percent of the
native-born, the bureau reported.
</P>
<P>
   Rosalind Gold, senior director of naturalization programs in the
Los Angeles office of the National Organization of Latino Elected
and Appointed Officials, said it's important to remember the
context of the time leading up to the November 1996 election.
</P>
<P>
   Proposition 187 and welfare reform proposals to strip legal
immigrants of benefits had sparked a backlash among Latino
immigrants and prodded many of them into increased political
activity, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You still had people who were getting energized and
mobilized'' in an atmosphere they perceived as threatening their
rights, Gold said. ``Naturalized Latino citizens felt they had to
make their voices heard.''
</P>
<P>
   Naturalized U.S. citizens comprise only 12percent of the Latino
population in the United States but account for one-fifth of all
Latino U.S. citizens, she said. Forty percent of the Latino
population of the United States aren't American citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Pachon, president of the Tomas Rivera Policy Institute in
Claremont, said the census findings might be tied to what he called
``the California phenomenon.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, 250,000 Latinos became citizens _ 150,000 of them in
the Golden State, he said. Many of them evidently went to the polls
that year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   It's conventional wisdom that ``people who are newer to the
system are more enthusiastic about it,'' said Anthony Chavez, an
attorney with the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education
Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Pachon said the factors that drove naturalized Latino citizens
to the polls in November 1996 may not be as compelling now. ``The
anti-immigrant drumbeat has really slackened in the last year,''
Pachon said.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau statistics show Latinos were a larger
percentage of overall voters in the 1996 vote _ 4.7 percent of all
those voting nationwide compared to only 3.7 percent in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   That corresponds to a growing Latino population nationally,
although studies have shown that such factors as youth, lower
socioeconomic status and lower education levels _ all of which
define the Latino population taken as a whole _ typically lead to
less political involvement, said Gold.
</P>
<P>
   ``Growth in population doesn't always translate into growth in
participation,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Latino political involvement is still lagging, she added.
``There is a gap between Latino participation and non-Latino
participation'' both in terms of registering to vote and among
registered voters, Gold said.
</P>
<P>
   Only 44 percent of Latino citizens voted in 1996 compared to 59
percent of non-Latino citizens.
</P>
<P>
   More than half of the U.S. voting-age population (54 percent)
reported voting in the 1996 election, down from 61 percent in 1992.
The seven-point drop was the largest decline between consecutive
presidential elections since 1964.
</P>
<P>
   The findings in the new Census Bureau report are based on the
November 1996 Current Population Survey, which routinely
overestimates voter turnout compared to figures from other sources.

PRESIDENT'S STRATEGY: PLACE BURDEN ON STARR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Updates throughout following Clinton's Monday night address.)  (Also see: CLINTON-RDP, CLINTON-PSYCHE, CLINTON-PROCESS,

 (JT /js )  
 By NEIL A. LEWIS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With his admission of an inappropriate relationship
with Monica Lewinsky, President Clinton on Monday night unveiled a
new legal and political strategy that effectively shifted the
burden to the special counsel to carry on what Clinton described as
a needless and intrusive enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our country has been distracted for this matter for too
long,'' Clinton said in his public address Monday night. ``Now it
is time, in fact it is past time, to move on.''
</P>
<P>
   These remarks appear to have been aimed at what the president's
supporters have long believed is the particular vulnerability of
the independent counsel, Kenneth Starr: the widespread public
perception that his investigation is largely a prurient pursuit of
the details of the president's private life.
</P>
<P>
   In his sometimes combative appearance before the grand jury
Monday, Clinton refused to answer in detail some questions about
the relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's investigation has dealt with a wide variety of issues,
including whether Clinton colluded with Ms. Lewinsky to tailor her
story, whether he counseled her to conceal gifts he had given her
and whether he participated in an effort to help her find a
desirable job as a reward for her silence.
</P>
<P>
   In Monday night's speech, Clinton dealt with those issues by
tersely denying that he had obstructed justice or persuaded others
to lie under oath or conceal evidence about his relationship with
Ms. Lewinsky. ``I told the grand jury today and I say to you now
that at no time did I ask anyone to lie, hide or destroy evidence
or to take any unlawful action,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But that assertion is unlikely to end Starr's inquiry. He has
taken extensive testimony from witnesses about those subjects and
they are certain to figure prominently in any report sent to
Congress, which may then consider whether impeachment is warranted.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Starr may not be satisfied with Clinton's
incomplete answers about his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky and may
decide to seek a subpoena to force the president to answer the
questions more fully. Clinton's associates said Monday night that
such a move would be vigorously challenged.
</P>
<P>
   While the issue of a sexual relationship between Clinton and Ms.
Lewinsky has occupied most of the public commentary, Starr's view
of the investigation, people close to him say, has always been that
any untruthfulness about the sexual relationship was part of a
wider pattern of deception on the part of the Clinton White House.
</P>
<P>
   Some questions concern conversations Clinton may have had with
Ms. Lewinsky, a former White House intern, once it became known
that she might become a witness in the sexual misconduct lawsuit
brought against the president by Paula Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Jones, a former clerical worker for the state of Arkansas,
had sued Clinton, charging that in 1991, when he was governor of
Arkansas, he made a crude sexual advance that she rebuffed. On Jan.
17 in a deposition taken by lawyers for Mrs. Jones, Clinton denied
having had ``sexual relations'' with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's acknowledgment to the grand jury that he had had, as
his lawyer put it, ``inappropriate contact'' with Ms. Lewinsky
carries risks. He has now acknowledged having been, at the least,
misleading in his testimony at the January deposition.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's advisers said the president had agreed on a strategy
of asserting that he did not commit perjury when he denied in the
January deposition that he had had ``sexual relations'' or an
``affair'' with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech Monday night, Clinton said that while his answers
in the deposition were ``legally accurate,'' he did not ``volunteer
information.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky has told friends and presumably testified before
the grand jury that in the middle of December she had a
conversation with Clinton in which he told her: ``If two people are
in a room, and they both say nothing happened, how will anyone
know?''
</P>
<P>
   This conversation would have taken place before Ms. Lewinsky had
been subpoenaed in the Jones lawsuit, although Ms. Lewinsky's name
had by then appeared on a list of potential witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   In the January 17 deposition, Clinton replied ``I'm not sure''
when asked whether he had discussed with Ms. Lewinsky her possible
testimony. A judge dismissed Ms. Jones' lawsuit in April, but legal
experts have said that Clinton could still be liable for any crime
he committed while the suit was still alive.
</P>
<P>
   The precise wording of any conversation the president and Ms.
Lewinsky had about her testimony could be important because lawyers
say there is a thin line between suborning perjury and discussing
hypothetical situations. Ms. Lewinsky provided an affidavit in the
Jones case in which she denied having had a sexual relationship
with Clinton.

Turns out

<P>
   Astros' new ace outpitched &QL; 
as Phils' Byrd spins 4-hitter
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By JOSEPH DUARTE &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
PHILADELPHIA _ He pitched a shutout. He did not allow a runner to
advance to second base. He had six strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't Randy Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it was little-known righthander Paul Byrd who stole the
show Monday night, tossing a four-hitter as the Philadelphia
Phillies handed the Astros a 4-0 loss before a crowd of 18,975 at
rain-soaked Veterans Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``A David-and-Goliath story came true out there tonight,'' said
Byrd, who threw the first complete game of his career. ``I was
facing a giant.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros hardly resembled the National League's top-scoring
team in being shut out for the fifth time this season. Ditto for
Johnson, who relied on spectacular control in three straight
flawless starts for the Astros but watched it abandon him in losing
for the first time with his new club.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went out there a little flat,'' Johnson said. ``I think the
way I go out there will dictate the way the team reacts, too. If I
go out there a little flat, the team will go out flat. It's my
responsibility to pitch with a little more intensity and get the
team up more. I didn't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said it would have been tough to expect the same results
he achieved in his last start against the Phillies _ a five-hit,
9-0 shutout Aug. 7 at the Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt it was going to be a test,'' he said. ``It's always a
test facing the same team back-to-back. I didn't have the same
stuff I had in Houston against these guys. I struggled with my
mechanics and didn't have a whole lot behind my pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson (3-1), who had thrown shutouts in his previous two
starts, allowed a run-scoring single to Byrd in the second inning
and a two-run homer to Scott Rolen in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   That was all the support Byrd needed. The 27-year-old
righthander, who had been pitching for Atlanta's Class AAA
affiliate in Richmond, Va., before being claimed off waivers this
past weekend, kept the Astros off-balance with an assortment of
pitches. He retired 15 of the final 18 batters he faced.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy rains forced the cancellation of pre-game batting
practice. The Astros could have used it as the top three hitters in
their order _ Craig Biggio, Bill Spiers and Derek Bell _ failed to
reach base and went a collective 0-for-11.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was probably the best game Byrd has ever pitched in the
big leagues and probably not one of the best Randy's pitched,''
said Astros manager Larry Dierker, whose team has a 7{-game lead
over the Chicago Cubs in the NL Central. ``When we hit well, they
go over the fence. We hit the ball well but not enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, it was like that old saying: There are going to be 50
games you lose, and 50 games you're going to win. This was one of
the 50 we were going to lose. We didn't play anything close to
inspired baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Byrd, making only his fifth start in 88 big-league appearances,
did get a few breaks. The Astros had four deep flyouts late in the
game that died at the warning track.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd gave the Phillies a 1-0 lead in the second inning with an
RBI single that snapped Johnson's scoreless-innings streak at 21.
Johnson had not allowed a run since the fifth inning against
Pittsburgh in his Astros debut Aug. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Glanville led off the Philadelphia fifth with a single to
left field, and Kevin Sefcik walked. Glanville was thrown out
trying to steal third base, but Rolen sent a 2-and-2 fastball into
the right-field stands for a 3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who was replaced by Scott Elarton at the start of the
sixth, allowed three runs, six hits and four walks in five innings
and finished with only three strikeouts in his shortest outing
since he lasted three innings for Seattle in a 10-4 loss to the
Texas Rangers on May 19. He threw 101 pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just couldn't find any rhythm at all,'' Dierker said.
``What has impressed me the most about him in his first three
starts was his control, and he just didn't have it. Not only that,
but he started losing velocity. I think he got frustrated. You
could tell with his body language.''
</P>
<P>
   Byrd, meanwhile, didn't allow a hit until Jeff Bagwell singled
with two out in the fourth. As Byrd recorded the game's final out
on a pop-up to third base, he clenched his fist and began to
realize his accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the crowd gave me a standing ovation (in the eighth
inning), I wanted to cry,'' Byrd said. ``I'll remember this
forever.''

 &HT;    ANALYSIS: After a long wait, Americans treated to `crummy TV'
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Oh, that woman.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton reversed his version of the truth about ``that
woman, Miss Lewinsky'' on Monday, first before a grand jury, then
in front of a national TV audience.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton first appeared from the White House map room at 10 p.m.
looking as if he'd been sent to time out. He apologized (``it was
wrong''), hinted he might agonize (``I misled people, including,
even, my wife''), then rallied into a political statement. For four
minutes and ten seconds, he never reached for a Clinton prop,
though they never seemed far away: the bitten lip, the tear-welling
eye.
</P>
<P>
   It was two speeches in one, and it baffled many usually
unbaffable pundits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you saying you're not impressed?'' CNN's Larry King asked
Jeff Greenfield after the newsman's first post-speech comments.
</P>
<P>
   Greenfield gave it another shot. ``It was the most unusual and
difficult speech any public figure has had to give. To judge it on
a scale of `rhetoric: 8, cosmotology: 6' is almost offensive in
this context.''
</P>
<P>
   Offered CBS's Bob Schieffer, ``You don't hear this kind of thing
very often.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never heard it from an American president,'' said anchor
Dan Rather.
</P>
<P>
   But it was a rare telegenic moment in this long-running drama.
For all the day's historic weightiness, what led up to Clinton's
tell-little was mostly crummy TV _ a stunning letdown for those who
thought this might be a kind of final, rewarding episode to this
seven-month series. The broadcast networks interrupted regular
programming for a few minutes when Clinton began his grand jury
testimony shortly before 1 p.m. _ then scrammed (NBC cut off Tom
Brokaw in mid-sentence and leapt to its soap opera ``Sunset
Beach'').
</P>
<P>
   CNN wasn't so lucky. It was stuck with endless hours of expanded
coverage and little new to fill it with. There were rare bright
exceptions, such as Candy Crowley's feature on Clinton's
truth-telling options (``Isn't it mind blowing how truth is talked
about as multiple choice?'' she asked with the lively frankness
usually reserved for Greenfield).
</P>
<P>
   The most mind-blowing comment on truth, however, came from Sen.
Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) on CNN, when he advised Clinton to be
honest, adding, ``George Washington didn't lie. Now, I don't know
if that's true or not ...''
</P>
<P>
   But CNN did for much of the day what it's done for weeks: let
commentators speculate about what prosecutors would ask, what
Clinton would answer, and admit it had no idea. CNN producer Ted
Barrett got a morning peek inside the grand jury room and reported:
``It's a large court room with very tall ceilings, a pale white
wood, very light marble walls ...''
</P>
<P>
   ``All day we had the most lethal of situations: an intense
interest and no news,'' said Terrance Smith on PBS's ``The NewsHour
with Jim Lehrer.''
</P>
<P>
   CNN tried to spike drama into this static situation _ so static
reporters were reduced to fashioning metaphors out of rain falling
over the White House _ with a tiny box in a corner of the screen,
ticking off the minutes of Clinton's testimony, as if it were a
World Cup soccer match. The network ditched the box less than two
hours later: it couldn't account for breaks during testimony, which
apparently rendered its clock ``unofficial.''
</P>
<P>
   When testimony ended at 6:25 p.m., the networks' nightly news
was left largely with news it had reported all weekend: Clinton
'fessed to a ``relationship.'' But Rather was still revved.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is live TV,'' he reminded us. ``Trying to cover this
story is like trying to put a fan belt on a moving Mercedes.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather later threw to Schieffer: ``Let's go for a quick
analysis, as far as there can be any.''
</P>
<P>
   Schieffer confirmed Rather's worst fears: ``I don't think
there's much more to say.''
</P>
<P>
   But by prime time, the pundits were in full throttle _ just as
we like 'em. CNBC's Chris Mathews may have broken his own run-on
record. At one point he unloosed 196 words in a 40 second riff _
4.9 words a second!
</P>
<P>
   Too bad CNN didn't have its clock on him to make it official.

A DEMOCRAT, BUT AN F.O.G. _ AS IN GEORGE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas)  (js) 
 By ELISABETH BUMILLER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Gov. George W. Bush of Texas was, by his own
admission, the party-animal-like president of his Yale fraternity,
Roland Betts was his rush chairman. When Bush needed a political
launching pad, Betts helped buy the Texas Rangers and set Bush up
as managing partner. And now that Bush, a Republican, is expected
to run for president, Betts is warming up as his unofficial finance
chairman and head cheerleader in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been a Democrat my whole life,'' Betts said the other
day, ``but I'm George's biggest fan.''
</P>
<P>
   Betts is the chairman of Chelsea Piers, the once-ailing Hudson
River sports complex rescued two years ago by Gov. George Pataki.
Now Betts is leading _ with his business partner, Tom Bernstein _ a
club of two: New York liberal Democrats for Bush. ``It's fun to
talk about,'' Betts said, ``because people don't expect us to be
fans of George.''
</P>
<P>
   Betts, 52, is an imperious, amusing and bearlike former Yale
hockey player whose company, Silver Screen Management, financed
nearly every Disney movie made between 1985 and 1991, including
``Beauty and the Beast,'' ``The Little Mermaid'' and ``Pretty
Woman.'' He was also president of a company that financed the films
``Gandhi'' and ``The Killing Fields.'' He broke with Disney after
1991 because, Betts said, ``they wanted to pay us less.''
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, Betts is a very rich showman-entrepreneur who sits
on the right boards (Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center,
American Museum of Natural History, etc.). But his friendship with
Bush could turn him into a political player, a New York F.O.G.
</P>
<P>
   It will shock no one to learn that Betts thinks President
Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky is paving the way for
his fraternity brother in 2000. ``There's just no possibility that
George would be in the kind of stuff that Clinton is,'' Betts
asserted. ``He doesn't have it in him.''
</P>
<P>
   (On Monday, a skirmish broke out over this very issue. At a news
conference in Texas, Bush said he was ``embarrassed for the
country'' over the president's testimony. This prompted Lanny
Davis, a Clinton defender, to say on MSNBC that he was at college
with Bush and that the governor ``shouldn't throw stones.'')
</P>
<P>
   Many of Betts' Democratic friends in New York are skeptical of
his enthusiasm for Bush. ``Initially, he may be a hard sell,''
Betts admitted. It may not help that Bush has a position on
abortion that appears calculated to please both sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, that's the single toughest thing for George,''
Betts said. ``What he says is, `I uphold the law of the land.' ''
Bush describes himself as personally ``pro-life,'' but says the
Supreme Court has already settled the right of a woman to chose.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Bush, the son of former President George Bush, took a
few moments from campaigning for re-election in Texas to talk about
his friendship with Betts, which he called ``close'' and ``able to
stand the test of time.'' He also expressed pleasure that Betts had
owned up to being his rush chairman at Delta Kappa Epsilon, or DKE,
known at Yale and elsewhere as the jock house. ``Did he admit to
that?'' Bush said. ``Good. And he did a very fine job.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Betts talked in his office at Chelsea Piers, which is very large
and overlooks two roller rinks. He is 6 feet, 1 inch tall, weighs
220 pounds and looks like an entertainment mogul dressed in golf
clothes. ``What is this _ a dating service?'' Betts said when asked
about his height and weight. He is married, has two daughters and
lives on the Upper West Side.
</P>
<P>
   His good friend, writer Roy Blount Jr., devoted a chapter to
Betts in ``Be Sweet,'' his recent memoir, and wrote that Betts
became a mogul _ and that Blount did not _ because Betts is good at
getting up in the morning. ``He generally goes to bed early, gets
up early, runs and then works,'' Blount wrote. ``He loves to work.
That's another reason he's a mogul and I'm not.''
</P>
<P>
   At least Betts did not have a completely predictable ascent to
moguldom. True, his father, Allan Betts, was a longtime associate
of Vincent Astor and a director of the Astor Foundation. And true,
Roland Betts grew up in Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., went to boarding
school at St. Paul's and then moved on as expected to Yale, like
three generations in his family before him.
</P>
<P>
   But then he worked for eight years as a teacher and
administrator in the New York and New Jersey public schools,
including five years spent teaching math and history at
Intermediate School 201 in Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote a book about it, ``Acting Out,'' published by Little,
Brown in 1978. ``Substitute teaching in the New York City schools
is masochism in its purest form,'' is how he started the chapter
called ``Subbing.''
</P>
<P>
   Betts left, exhausted, for Columbia Law School, became an
entertainment lawyer at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &AMP; Garrison,
and then began financing movies.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, he was the single largest investor in a group that
bought the Texas Rangers baseball team, which Betts describes as a
vehicle for Bush to demonstrate leadership skills out of the shadow
of his father. It also made Bush rich. Bush invested $600,000 in
the Rangers and made $14.9 million when the Rangers were sold this
summer. Before that, he had been moderately successful in the oil
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he never hit the mother lode,'' Betts said. ``He became a
rich guy last month.''

   LONDON _ When it comes to sexual indiscretions, Bill Clinton may
have scored higher than most presidents, but his conduct has
differed only in degree from that of most of his White House
predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   A selection of American presidents surveyed in the Washington
Times newspaper shows all of them merited a black spot on a
scoreboard of sex crimes that range from the use of prostitutes and
fornication (defined as sex with an unmarried woman) through to
much more heinous misdeeds, such as group sex or being linked to
the ``unusual'' death of a lover.
</P>
<P>
   The republic's founding father, George Washington, receives only
one black mark for the crime, mild by the lax standards of the
eighteenth century, of adultery.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Jefferson, a relative libertine, on the other hand, was
awarded four, for mistresses, ``fornication,'' ``adultery'' (sex
with a married women) and fathering illegitimate children.
</P>
<P>
   America's presidents in the nineteenth century were, by and
large, an obscure group of men who seem to have made up for low
profiles by indulging in pecadillos.
</P>
<P>
   Grover Cleveland _ not a name much bandied about now _ earns
four black marks, for mistress, prostitutes, fornication and
illegitimate children.
</P>
<P>
   Though not on the straight and narrow, the presidents of the
last century were, it seems, straight; James Buchanan was the sole
American president in the entire list to stray into the column
denoting homosexual affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The private lives of U.S. leaders in both centuries pale into
insignificance compared to those of our own era. After the prim and
dreary milk-and cookie years of Roosevelt and Eisenhower, the
number of black marks rockets under Kennedy, Johnson and Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton gets seven marks _ for, among others, having a mistress,
using prostitutes, fornication, sex with White House Staff, group
sex ... narrowly beating Johnson who did not, as far as the
newspaper knows, have group sex.
</P>
<P>
   But even Clinton and Johnson fall short of JFK's awesome tally. &QL;

MURRAY WAS OUR MICHELANGELO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jim Murray once wrote about making a pilgrimage to Yankee
Stadium as a teen-ager to see Babe Ruth play in what would prove to
be his final season with the Yankees. Ruth hit a home run. As the
slugger trotted around the bases, Murray, to his dismay, felt none
of the drama that permeated the prose of his favorite sportswriter
of that era, Grantland Rice.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth's power was prodigious, but what struck Murray that day was
the power of the written word. The pen, he realized, could be
mightier, even, than The Babe's bat.
</P>
<P>
   What Murray learned from reading the likes of Rice he would, in
turn, imbue in generations of Angelenos. Just how privileged we
were to sit at Murray's knee as he spun his stories will become
painfully apparent now that he's gone.
</P>
<P>
   Murray, the lead sports columnist at the Los Angeles Times since
1961, died Sunday of cardiac arrest at his Brentwood home at the
age of 78. Fifty years to the day after Ruth died of throat cancer,
the sportswriting world lost its home-run king.
</P>
<P>
   There will never be another voice like Murray's. It rang as true
as the man himself. He did not scream at the reader, demanding to
be heard. He did not sermonize or patronize.
</P>
<P>
   His subjects might have been skewered on occasion but they never
felt burned. He was a wordsmith, not a character assassin.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could write a story about you that might sound a little
derogatory,'' said jockey Willie Shoemaker. ``But the way he wrote
it, you had to laugh.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray had no discernible ego, a quick wit and an encyclopedic
knowledge of world events, the latter owing to his voracious
reading habits as well as years spent as a Time magazine reporter
covering everything from presidential hopefuls to Hollywood stars.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Murray's subject, he mixed and matched words like the
very best fashion designers do cloth swatches, then accessorized
his sentences with humor and history. The results were images like
the one Murray once painted of the infield-fly rule. It ``is about
as simple as calligraphy,'' he wrote. ``It might as well be a
Japanese naval code.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He had an ability to write a paragraph that made you want to
get to the next paragraph,'' said friend and longtime Lakers
broadcaster Chick Hearn.
</P>
<P>
   As far as paragraphs go, it's pretty hard to top the one Murray
filed from Indianapolis 500 one year: ``Gentlemen, start your
coffins.''
</P>
<P>
   Sportswriters had largely refrained from reporting on the
dangers of racing until Murray happened upon Gasoline Alley. He was
less interested in what made the hunks of gleaming metal run than
what made the drivers tick.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, when he accepted the columnist job at the Times, he told
his longtime friend, Will Fowler, ``I don't want to write this for
statistics. I want to write about people.''
</P>
<P>
   And so it was he filled his news hole with stories that stirred
the soul, aroused the senses, tickled the funny bone and
occasionally opened the tear ducts. Among his two-hanky pieces was
the tribute he penned in 1984 to Geraldine, his wife of 39 years,
after her death of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the subject was familiar or not, Murray always got to
the heart of the matter. He dug deep for information, going so far
as to look up Marilyn Monroe's birth certificate at City Hall
before interviewing her for a Time story.
</P>
<P>
   Once he turned his reporting and writing skills to sports, the
awards and honors started piling up faster than a stack of
newspapers. In 1990 he became only the fourth sportswriter to win
the Pulitzer Prize for commentary.
</P>
<P>
   The award meant so much to the modest Murray, he hung his
Pulitzer proclamation in the foyer of his home. But it wasn't the
dominant piece of art on the wall. Above it hung a framed letter
that golfer Ben Hogan had written to Murray praising him on his
ability to write about people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim said many times he prized that letter from Ben Hogan over
the Pulitzer,'' Fowler said.
</P>
<P>
   In July of 1982 Murray wrote of the late Pulitzer-winning
sportswriter Red Smith, ``People knew the name. And what it stood
for. Uncompromising integrity. A surgical deftness with words that
made some of us wonder if Red wrote with rubber gloves.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray might as well have been writing about himself. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Monday the President of the United States testified by video
before a Federal grand jury on whether he perjured himself when he
denied a sexual relationship with the White House intern Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   He now admits to some form of intimate relationship with
Lewinsky, though not to ``sexual relations.'' But the president's
opponents, the independent counsel, Kenneth Starr, and the
Republican Congressional majority, are guilty of a graver offense:
humbug masquerading as democratic vigilance.
</P>
<P>
   In the first place, Republicans do not really believe Clinton
committed a serious tort. His alleged perjury took place in a civil
suit Paula Jones filed under sexual-harassment law.
</P>
<P>
   When she charged that the then-Governor of Arkansas had
propositioned her in a hotel room, Clinton was required to answer
her questions about his sexual conduct since becoming president.
</P>
<P>
   Until Jones came along, Republicans had insisted that sexual
harassment was nothing more than a feminism-fuelled litigative
lottery that allowed some women to collect money when men they did
not fancy made passes at them.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican critique has won broad acceptance. Judges of both
political parties now generally respond to sexual harassment cases
_ as to Paula Jones's _ by chucking them out of court.
</P>
<P>
   In the second place, the Republicans once strenuously denied the
constitutionality of the independent counsel law, which was passed
in 1978 in the wake of Watergate. Kenneth Starr even wrote a brief
against the office he now occupies.
</P>
<P>
   Until Bill Clinton won the Presidency in 1992, and the
Republican campaign of calumny and detraction began, the view of
Congressional conservatives was that the independent counsel exists
outside the checks and balances envisioned in the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Clinton himself is no stranger to humbug. He did not
complain when the Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas was nearly
denied confirmation over a ``sexual harassment'' incident that
consisted of one dirty joke.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was he troubled when Ronald Reagan's presidency was crippled
after 1987 by the inquiry into the illegal raising of money and
arms for the Nicaraguan Contras.
</P>
<P>
   It is a telling parallel. Throughout the 1980s, Democrats warned
that Reagan was a doddering old warmonger. But that is what the
voters wanted _ a doddering old warmonger.
</P>
<P>
   In the Contra scandal, a Democratic congressional majority and a
power-hungry independent prosecutor, Lawrence Walsh, reckoned that
if Americans could not be made to see reason at the polls, then the
work of removing (or disabling) Reagan had best be done judicially.
It is a dangerously anti-democratic tendency.
</P>
<P>
   Starr and the Republicans are making the same mistake. Voters
have always been aware that Clinton is, as the Southern idiom has
it, a hard dog to keep on the porch. And they don't care. They have
prospered under his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   They may even value his goatishness as an antidote to all the
prudery and prohibitionism that travels under the ``family values''
rhetoric of both parties.
</P>
<P>
   Such rhetoric is not unknown in this country, of course. In the
current issue of the Spectator, the Greek-American playboy Taki
writes that the President's offense was that he had not restrained
his sexual impulses even though he is the head of a country with ``
its Christian values written in stone.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the United States is explicitly a non-Christian
country. The U.S. Constitution contains many noble sentiments, but
nowhere does it mention God, let alone Jesus Christ; and the First
Amendment insists on the separation of church and state.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that Bill Clinton, an avowed Baptist, might be
expected to take the injunctions of his religion rather more
seriously than he apparently does, but he is not the first Baptist,
nor the first president, to play away from home.
</P>
<P>
   There is indeed a moral question here, but the morality has been
muddied by the less attractive members of America's religious
right, and by those who cannot and will not reconcile themselves to
Clinton's victories in 1992 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans _ especially the Southern conservatives _ are
finding the Clinton ascendancy unbearable. They, after all,
represent the Americans who steered clear of the leftist,
hedonistic 1960s in order to uphold the old values, work
diligently, and fight communism.
</P>
<P>
   Surely, they felt, they would be vindicated, their virtue
rewarded. Then the Berlin Wall fell, and Americans handed the reins
of leadership to Mr. Didn't-Inhale and his clique of
abortion-promoting Ivy League millionaires. It was just too
frustrating.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton must be prosecuted to show that no one is above the law,
Republicans argue. This is, as Americans would say, baloney. That
no one is above the law is an important American principle, but it
gets flouted from time to time, with no lasting damage.
</P>
<P>
   That people have a right to the president they elected _
provided that he is not guilty of a crime or misdemeanor far more
serious than lying about sex _ is a principle of incomparably
greater importance in a democracy. America ignores it at its
peril. &QL;

greater importance in a democracy. America ignores it at its
peril. &QL;

<P>
   Aside from the smutty jokes, President Clinton deserved our
sympathy as he faced the questioning of Special Counsel Kenneth
Starr across a video link Monday.
</P>
<P>
   It is not a question of morality or even of past lies. It is the
problem of the leader of the most powerful country of the world
being chased like a rat into the corner.
</P>
<P>
   There are those who believe that he is a rat, in his personal
morality and his character. There are those too who would argue
that truth is the greatest single ingredient in a democracy and the
law is its final guardian.
</P>
<P>
   Both may be true, although it should be said that the U.S.
public is the final arbiter in a democracy of what it does or does
not feel is important in the character of their leaders.
</P>
<P>
   There is little indication either that voters did not have a
fair view of Clinton before his election. The process of
investigation has become not so much a process of judgment as a
legalistic interpretation of what is truth and what is a lie.
</P>
<P>
   It is the process that matters to the world as much as to
America. For the rest of the world is probably reacting much like
the average American, bemused that it could come to this.
</P>
<P>
   If President Clinton stays on wounded and tarnished, it is not
just the prestige of the U.S. that suffers, it is also its ability
to act around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign policy remains the one area where the character of the
president does matter. So far Clinton's record in the field has not
been that strong, but nor has it been bad.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially a domestic president, he has seen it as his task to
turn America's victory in the Cold War to commercial effect through
pushing free trade. But he has resisted most temptations to meddle
dangerously in the internal affairs of other countries, he has
followed a reasonably ethical policy and has put his weight behind
peace where it matters.
</P>
<P>
   It was not entirely his fault that a Republican Congress has
continued to be so anti-U.N. or that Israeli politics have
prevented a breakthrough in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   The danger for the rest of the world of a humiliated president
is that it will be precisely at this time that Clinton may decide
to move from domestic to international concerns in a way aimed at
increasing his prestige rather than pursuing national aims.
</P>
<P>
   The bombings in Kenya, the continued troubles with Fidel Castro,
the war on drugs in Latin America and Asia, the edgy relationship
with Iran: all these could provide him with endless opportunities
to act tough to restore his image.
</P>
<P>
   His troubles are our concern and it is right for America's
allies to help him keep dignity if he is to remain responsible. &QL;

 By JAMES BENNET   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Saying that he had misled his wife and the public,
President Clinton admitted in a solemn and grim-faced address
Monday night that he had an intimate relationship at the White
House with an intern. He also acknowledged the relationship in
testimony to a grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was wrong,'' the president said, speaking in somber yet
defiant tones from the same straight-backed chair from which, hours
earlier, he had carried on a far more combative exchange with
prosecutors. ``It constituted a critical lapse in judgment and a
personal failure on my part for which I am solely and completely
responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   After seven months of emphatic denials of a sexual relationship
with Monica Lewinsky, the former intern, Clinton found himself
addressing among the most personally painful of matters _ adultery
_ in the most public forum imaginable. Speaking just after 10 p.m.,
he tried to wrest political forgiveness from personal
embarrassment, issuing a proud, almost angry demand for his privacy
back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, this matter is between me, the two people I love most _
my wife and our daughter _ and our God,''' he said. ``It's nobody's
business but ours. Even presidents have private lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's defiant statement came after a contentious 4-1/2 hour
session before a federal grand jury in which he repeatedly refused
to answer prosecutors' questions not only about his relationship
with Ms. Lewinsky but about other matters under investigation,
according to a Clinton adviser familiar with his testimony.
</P>
<P>
   In turn, prosecutors told the president that they might subpoena
him again, as they did to secure his agreement to testify in the
first place, and Clinton's lawyers said that he would likely fight
such a move.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton denied that he had obstructed justice and had tried to
cover up his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. ``I told the grand
jury today and I say to you now that at no time did I ask anyone to
lie, to hide or destroy evidence or to take any other unlawful
action,'' he said in his public address. He urged the public to put
the matter behind it. ``It is past time to move on,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After Clinton's speech it remained unknown what evidence Starr
might have on the most damaging questions of obstructing justice, a
point that Republicans were quick to emphasize after the
president's appearance.
</P>
<P>
   In testifying and then speaking to the public, Clinton tried the
riskiest high-wire act of his career, trying to balance legal and
political burdens. Two days short of his 52nd birthday, he sought
to protect his presidency and elude legal jeopardy by acknowledging
an intimate relationship in the White House with a subordinate less
than half his age.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had been working on his speech for several days, aides
said, trying to strike the right balance between disclosure and
dignity, remorse and pride. He ran through it twice before
delivering it live, addressing the camera head-on.
</P>
<P>
   Starr is investigating whether the president lied under oath in
denying an affair with Ms. Lewinsky last January in his deposition
during the Paula Corbin Jones sexual misconduct suit. Beyond the
nature of Clinton's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, Starr has been
investigating whether Clinton tried to obstruct justice and suborn
perjury.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton acknowledged in his testimony having had ``inappropriate
intimate physical contact'' with Ms. Lewinsky, according to one
lawyer and adviser to the president knowledgeable about his
appearance. But the president argued that the contact did not fit
the definition of sex used by the Jones lawyers, and that therefore
he did not commit perjury.
</P>
<P>
   In his brief speech Monday night, Clinton hinted at the depth of
animosity between the two sides, saying that the investigation had
``gone on too long, cost too much and hurt too many innocent
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton testified Monday, and delivered his speech, from the
White House Map Room, from which Franklin Delano Roosevelt
monitored the progress of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning at 12:59 p.m., President Clinton met with prosecutors
in the Map Room on the ground floor of the White House. His
testimony was videotaped and transmitted by live closed-circuit
television to a grand jury at the federal courthouse, just blocks
away.
</P>
<P>
   The details of President Clinton's testimony were not
immediately disclosed. But in a brief statement his lawyer, David
Kendall, said: ``As to a very few highly intrusive questions with
respect to the specifics of this contact, in order to preserve
personal privacy and institutional dignity, he gave candid, but not
detailed answers.''
</P>
<P>
   In announcing his plans to testify earlier this month, Clinton
said he would speak ``truthfully and completely.'' But some of his
advisers had raised the possibility before his testimony that he
might rebuff detailed questions about his sexual contact with Ms.
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky testified August 6 that she had had a sexual
relationship with Clinton. She had previously denied such a
relationship in a sworn affidavit.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton took several breaks from his testimony to confer with
his lawyers in the doctor's office next door to the Map Room. At
about 3:30 p.m., he took a break that lasted roughly an hour, one
Clinton ally said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Some Republican congressional leaders have said that an
acknowledgment by Clinton that he had not told the truth about his
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky might blunt the threat of
impeachment proceedings on Capitol Hill. Erskine B. Bowles, the
chief of staff, called Democrats on the Hill on Monday evening to
rally support for the president.
</P>
<P>
   But even if Clinton heads off such hearings, it is far from
clear whether he will put his second term back on track, or put to
rest smirking speculation about his private life and new doubts,
reflected in public polls, about his truthfulness. More
fundamentally, it was uncertain whether the presidency itself has
been diminished by a tawdry spectacle that drew so much attention
Monday that one television camera monitored the scene from the top
of the Washington Monument.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hopeful that the president's testimony will finally
bring closure'' to the four-year inquiry into the Clintons'
Whitewater real estate investment, Kendall said, adding that it had
culminated ``in an investigation of the president's private life.''
</P>
<P>
   White House aides picked up on Kendall's call for closure,
declaring that the president's statement Monday night would satisfy
any public interest in the long-running Lewinsky drama, and any
sense of aggravation with Clinton for his role.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people are not pounding on the door for details,
they're pounding on the door for closure,'' one senior
administration official said. ``He doesn't owe them details, he
owes them an explanation.''
</P>
<P>
   One friend said that the president avoided focusing until Sunday
on the implications of his testimony. ``It hit him hardest on
Sunday,'' the friend said. ``This was a very very difficult weekend
for him. Nothing is more important to him than his place in
history. He is worried that this investigation will eclipse
everything else.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton and his daughter,
Chelsea, remained at the White House Monday, and were believed to
have met with him after he testified. Clinton plans to leave for a
vacation with his family on Martha's Vineyard at 2 p.m. on Tuesday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Some of the president's own advisers expressed relief Monday
that he was finally telling his side of the story. Some, however,
also feel misled by him, since he denied an affair to them as well.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton worked out Monday morning in the White House gymnasium,
then spent about two hours preparing with his lawyers in the White
House residence. At noon, he broke for a briefing on domestic and
national security matters. Advisers described him as engaged and
interested during his ten-minute foreign policy discussion, asking
Sandy Berger, the national security adviser, how the Russian ruble
was trading.
</P>
<P>
   The White House released a photo of that meeting, the only
public glimpse of the president before Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   In his deposition on January 17 in the Jones lawsuit, the
president acknowledged a mere acquaintance with Ms. Lewinsky, whom
he met in 1995 when she was a 21-year-old unpaid intern. Clinton
said that he could not even recall ever being alone with her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never had sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky,''
Clinton said in his deposition. ``I've never had an affair with
her.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky had sworn in an affidavit in the Jones case that
she did not have a sexual relationship with him.
</P>
<P>
   Unknown to Clinton, an associate of Ms. Lewinsky, Linda Tripp,
had secretly tape-recorded numerous conversations in which her
friend described an affair with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Tripp provided those tapes to prosecutors, and also met
with Mrs. Jones' lawyers before they interviewed the president.

READINGS OUT ON TOWNS, TEA LEAVES AND TACKLES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BUD WITHERS  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ You've got questions on Husky fall football camp, at
least 14 of them. We've got answers, guesses, observations and
prevarications:
</P>
<P>
   1. What's the chance of Lester Towns, the inside linebacker,
getting over his foot problem and being ready for Arizona State
Sept. 5?
</P>
<P>
   A: UW coach Jim Lambright put a positive face on it Monday, but
Towns' odds of playing appear to be about the same as those of
Larry Parrish, the guy who monitors the gate at Husky practices.
Towns hasn't run since April and he's only walking (with a limp)
around practice.
</P>
<P>
   2. How much of an impact will Toalei Mulitauaopele have at
defensive tackle?
</P>
<P>
   A: If vowels determined the starter, Mulitauaopele would have
Mac Tuiaea swamped, 8-5. Mulitauaopele, 6-foot-5 and 320 pounds, is
as big as his surname, but he's still somewhat shy on conditioning.
He passed nine of his 16 timed 110-yard dashes in testing, and that
factor, combined with his inexperience at this level, likely will
keep him at a backup position behind Tuiaea and Jabari Issa.
</P>
<P>
   3. What's it going to cost the Huskies to lose Mel Miller, the
corner, to a three-game academic suspension?
</P>
<P>
   A: After a solid redshirt-freshman season in 1996, Miller
leveled off and had only an average sophomore year. But the Huskies
are losing experience there, since sophomore Toure Butler moves
into Miller's spot and redshirt freshman Wondame Davis must
progress quickly in camp to assure his role as third corner.
</P>
<P>
   With Towns also less than iffy, it means Arizona State _
designated by The Sporting News as having the nation's No. 1
offense this year _ won't know where to prod first, the middle or
the perimeter.
</P>
<P>
   4. Does Ja'Warren Hooker really like football less than he likes
track?
</P>
<P>
   A: Put it this way: He likes football somewhat less than the
offensive coaches like what he can do with a football.
</P>
<P>
   5. Is Gerald Harris recovered from his ugly knee injury of fall
camp, '97?
</P>
<P>
   A: Harris, the wideout from Kent, says he's fully rehabilitated,
and Lambright can only cheer that. A year ago, the Husky offense
took a major hit when Harris tumbled awkwardly out of bounds in
practice, removing the third man in their three-receiver sets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a tape of it,'' Harris said furtively. ``The coaches
don't know it. They didn't want me to see it because it was so bad,
but I've seen it a bunch of times.''
</P>
<P>
   6. How do the Huskies like the switch of Tony Coats from weak
tackle to guard?
</P>
<P>
   A: Very well. ``He's got a lot of ability to pull and run,''
says Steve Morton, his position coach. ``Sitting in that weak
tackle spot, he hasn't been able to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   7. Is there a reasonable facsimile of Lawyer Milloy or Tony
Parrish ready to step in at free safety?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, and his name is Hakim Akbar, but he's an 18-year-old
freshman. Brendan Jones, a senior, likely will hold onto the spot
he won in the spring, but he'll have to do it with savvy and
experience; Akbar vertical-leaps 38 inches, Jones 30.
</P>
<P>
   8. Can Washington return to the glory days when it could stop a
run up the gut?
</P>
<P>
   A: No guarantees. But the quickness up front will be improved
this year. Both Tuiaea and Issa have slimmed down to the 280-pound
range, and Jeremiah Pharms is a bullet train at the defensive end
spot vacated by Jason Chorak.
</P>
<P>
   9. Will Jerramy Stevens, the freshman from River Ridge, stay at
quarterback?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``They told me I'd get my shot,'' Stevens says. ``If it
doesn't work out, it doesn't work out. As long as I get my shot,
I'll be happy.''
</P>
<P>
   10. What might we expect from Brock Huard?
</P>
<P>
   A: Probably more than he gets from ESPN Magazine, which doesn't
include him in a list of six Heisman Trophy candidates: In order,
UCLA's Cade McNown, Kentucky's Tim Couch, Texas' Ricky Williams,
Wisconsin's Ron Dayne, LSU's Kevin Faulk and Ohio State's Andy
Katzenmoyer.
</P>
<P>
   Recognition has been a tough sell lately for the Huard family.
The other night, Mark Malone of ESPN asked Miami coach Jimmy
Johnson about Damon ``Hue-rad.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And he's a freakin' Sun Devil,'' Brock said, referring to
Malone.
</P>
<P>
   11. Uh, who's going to play running back?
</P>
<P>
   A: The hunch here was that it'll be holdover Maurice Shaw. But
Shaw is limping around practice with a pulled hamstring, leaving
the door wide open for freshman Willie Hurst, who has a nice burst.
The back who has surprised UW coaches most is 6-1, 200-pound
freshman Braxton Cleman of Oroville (pop. 1,505).
</P>
<P>
   Shaw's absence means the No. 1 guy there now is junior Jason
Harris.
</P>
<P>
   ``All he has to do is stay healthy,'' Lambright says. ``He's got
all the shake and move of any of the tailbacks we've had. But he's
had an awful time trying to stay healthy. We're trying to get him
through what was and get him seeing himself successfully.''
</P>
<P>
   12. Will this team be able to catch the ball better than the
Mariners?
</P>
<P>
   A: There are a lot of candidates, and a lot of questionmarks.
Right now, the ones who likely would line up in most three-receiver
sets are Hooker, Harris and Western Washington transfer Dane
Looker, a Puyallup High teammate of Huard. But you're likely to see
a good many four- and five-wide receiver sets.
</P>
<P>
   13. Scrubbing Miami for Utah State? Ugh. Any chance we'll see
the 'Canes anytime soon?
</P>
<P>
   A: You're in luck, stone crab-breath. An old Pac-10 association
between UW athletic director Barbara Hedges and former Miami (and
Cal) A.D. Dave Maggard resulted in a second home-and-home
arrangement that brings Miami here to open the 2000 season, with
the Huskies returning the game in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Another scheduling twist: Army, which was due to follow up a
1995 visit with another stop here in 2000, has been replaced by
Idaho. The Cadets bailed because of a new membership in Conference
USA.
</P>
<P>
   14. Forget the Rose Bowl. What's Washington's chance of beating
Oregon?
</P>
<P>
   A: Not very good, until the Huskies take the game as seriously
as the Ducks do.

TWO TAKES ON SWANK AMONG DUBLIN HOTELS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Aug. 23.)

<P>
   The signs of Dublin's astonishing renaissance are everywhere: in
the cafeteria at the National Gallery, where the food is
Mediterranean, the waiters are from Spain and the customers are
from all over the world; in the long taxi line at the airport,
filled with Eurobusiness executives on day trips; in the crush of
shoppers crowding the city's stores. With its continuing revival,
fueled in part by money from the European Union and in part by its
own extraordinary business resurgence, Dublin has become one of the
region's liveliest spots.
</P>
<P>
   This spring, I stayed at two of the city's most exciting hotels,
one new, one opened in 1996. Although each is expensive and boasts
a five-star rating, the two can scarcely be more different in
outlook and ambiance: one is a classic luxury hotel, the other a
quiet bastion of minimalist chic full of quirky touches. Each one
suits a type of guest with a type of mood, and the question I faced
as I planned my trip was, what type of hotel would appeal to my own
willful sensibility?
</P>
<P>
   For the first night of this self-generated experiment, I stayed
at the Merrion, one of Dublin's newest and grandest hotels. Opened
in October 1997 after a $46 million construction project that
included restoring and converting four Georgian town houses, the
Merrion is perfectly situated for those who want a quick infusion
of activity without having to go far.
</P>
<P>
   A five-minute walk in one direction gets you to Merrion Square,
a tiny but lovely park; Ireland's handsome government buildings,
and the National Art Gallery. Five minutes' walk in the other
direction takes you past St. Stephen's Green, another smallish
park, to Grafton Street, which is closed to traffic and brimming
with shops.
</P>
<P>
   But it's worth staying inside. The Merrion murmurs elegance and
comfort from the moment you are greeted in the marble-filled front
lobby by an array of staff members whose helpfulness stops just
short of obsequiousness. If checking in tires you out, there are
several restful drawing rooms on the ground floor, decorated with
French chandeliers, plush period furniture, and Irish art from the
private collections of the chairman of the hotel and one of its
directors.
</P>
<P>
   The day's newspapers are laid out; drinks and snacks (including
proper Irish tea, with cakes and sandwiches) are available; there
is a cocktail bar, called No. 23, at the far end.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel is large, with 125 rooms and 20 suites, but doesn't
seem impersonal. The more expensive rooms are in the old part _
each is based on a real room from one of the original houses _
while the rooms in the newly built Garden Wing, connected to the
main house by a glass walkway, are slightly cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   My room (one of the latter) was spacious and traditional but
full of modern conveniences like a fax machine, a well-stocked
minibar and a large umbrella. The room opened into a gratifyingly
oversized bathroom, which offered a delightful choice: a deep
bathtub with a very large hand-held shower attachment, or a big
separate shower with clean architectural lines and vigorous water
pressure.
</P>
<P>
   But it was only early afternoon, and, sadly, not yet bathing
time. I made my way down to the hotel's gym and spa in the
basement, to be greeted by a stunning sight: It was deserted.
Either no one else felt like exercising on a Thursday afternoon, or
exercise is not high on Dublin's list of priorities. There was one
man in the pool, so slow and unthreatening that I figured the
chance of his kicking me in the head and yelling at me to move was
minimal.
</P>
<P>
   The pool was a pleasure, dark blue with a water level so high it
spilled from the edges and onto the floor, and the small gym had
individual televisions and headphones connected to the treadmills,
so that you could actually hear something other than your own
tortured breathing. I collapsed in a chair by the pool, wearing my
fluffy white Merrion-provided towel, and plucked grapes from the
fruit bowl while reading fashion magazines.
</P>
<P>
   I rolled upstairs. Because it was my night on my own _ my
husband wasn't scheduled to join me until the next morning _ I
thought I would do something cultural instead of sitting around.
Maybe I could take myself to the movies. But the concierge's cheery
alacrity in response to my request for a movie schedule was no
match for my inertia.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly the prospect of the outside world seemed awfully bright
and noisy. I took a nap. I watched television. I received several
faxes. I ordered dinner, a baked potato and some steamed vegetables
(not on the menu, but not a problem) as part of the health program
I had apparently started that day. I watched some more television.
I sat in the bath for a long, long time. Then it was time for bed.
</P>
<P>
   My husband, Robert, arrived as I was finishing breakfast on
Friday. It was 10:30. The newspapers were spread out across the
bed, covered in crumbs. No more sitting around! I had planned a
morning of activity in the spa. I got a soothing facial; my husband
had a deep-cleansing back massage. During my facial I fell into
another doze, punctuated only by the chatter of the attendant.
</P>
<P>
   Scrubbed, buffed and polished, we managed to stagger back to our
room and change in time for our next activity _ a lavish lunch. The
Merrion actually has two restaurants: the Mornington in the
basement, which features contemporary Irish cuisine, and the
elegant Patrick Guilbaud, where we ate, the only restaurant in
Ireland to have two Michelin stars.
</P>
<P>
   The restaurant is in a light, airy room with high ceilings, lots
of windows, and more paintings from the proprietors' contemporary
art collections. The food was amazing: Robert had a big slab of
beef, as he always does when he's away from home, and I had a
beautifully cooked chicken breast surrounded by tiny vegetables. We
both had several drinks.
</P>
<P>
   Our heads were spinning as we checked out and traveled by taxi
across town to our next hotel, the Clarence. How could it be as
nice as the Merrion?
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   One of the Clarence's most appealing characteristics is its
provenance: originally built in 1852, it was bought in 1994 by Bono
and the Edge, the two coolest members of the supercool Dublin-based
rock group U2. The pair spent almost $8 million on a thorough
overhaul, reopening the hotel as a much more luxurious version of
its past self in June 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bono and the Edge do not stay at the Clarence when they
are in Dublin _ they have their own houses _ they have succeeded in
lending an aura of glamour to the hotel, situated in the city's
bustling Temple Bar district.
</P>
<P>
   Right on the Liffey River _ a none-too-attractive waterfront
that is poised for a major overhaul _ the hotel is within walking
distance of the scores of restaurants, bars and stores that have
given the Temple Bar the reputation of being Dublin's SoHo.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel is smaller than the Merrion, with only 50 rooms (five
of them suites), and no wasted space. Even the employees reflect
the hotel's minimalist ethos, wearing gray suits with subtle
pinstripes that make them look like extras in the movie
``Gattaca.'' ``Everyone keeps asking if I'm a clerk,'' complained
one staff member, as he rode up in the elevator with us.
</P>
<P>
   The Clarence's lobby is small and intimate, decorated in the
white American oak that forms most of the hotel's interior, and
opens out into an inviting common room known as the study. Here you
can read the papers, have a drink or take light meals in an
atmosphere of pleasant camaraderie (if you find camaraderie
pleasant) at the large table in the middle of the room or one of
the smaller tables nearby.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel's halls are cozy rather than spacious, decorated with
tall, funnel-shaped silver lighting fixtures that during my stay
were each graced by a Granny Smith apple, meant to be a decoration
rather than a snack.
</P>
<P>
   Each guest room is decorated in one of the five colors that form
the hotel's color scheme _ crimson, royal blue, purple, gold and
chocolate _ and ours was red-themed, with an an enormously inviting
white comforter on the bed and interestingly constructed red
curtains that were built to swing back and forth on wooden poles.
</P>
<P>
   Another red curtain separated the bedroom from the tiny entrance
hallway, and the bathroom was a model of the efficient use of
space, with wooden shelves and a bathtub that earned a 5.5 (out of
6) in my own personal tub-rating system.
</P>
<P>
   The room was slightly too small for a long afternoon indoors, so
I strolled through the neighborhood, stopping for a snack at the
Temple Bar Food Market, an open-air market in nearby Meeting House
Square that, each Saturday, sells soup, cheese, baked goods and a
variety of meats, fish and fresh produce. There were a number of
inviting-looking restaurants and cafes in the neighborhood, one of
which had apparently been visited by Quentin Tarantino. (A receipt
signed with his name was in the window.)
</P>
<P>
   There was no gym at the hotel, so my husband stayed in and took
a nap. Dinner was at 7 p.m., the only time they could take us, and
we felt a little put out _ what a ludicrously early time! But the
food was so good that we felt ashamed for quibbling.
</P>
<P>
   After a drink in the popular and unusual Octagon Bar, which
really does have eight perfectly proportioned sides, we moved on to
the Tea Room restaurant, in a long room with a bar at one end,
reachable by a few stairs.
</P>
<P>
   Even though many of the tables were filled with early-shift
diners struggling to get their small children to put the food in
their mouths and not in their hair, we were separated from the
crowds by a discreet partition that gave us the feeling of being
intimate and alone. Not with each other so much as with our food.
</P>
<P>
   Bread is bread and I can take it or leave it, but here, where we
were presented with a selection of exotic breads in different
shapes, sizes and flavors on its own little bread board, it was as
good as a course in itself. I went on to have salmon tartare as an
appetizer and grilled salmon as a main course (salmon, of course,
being an Irish specialty), but was particularly enamored of my
dessert, a selection of apple-themed sweets that included apple
sorbet, apple cream from what looked to be the creme brulee family,
and a kind of apple tart.
</P>
<P>
   We made our way upstairs in high good spirits, which only
improved when Robert put his shoes out to be shined and found that
they had come back an hour later.
</P>
<P>
   In the morning, breakfast ordered in our room _ complicated,
because Robert likes scrambled eggs and sausages and local
delicacies made of things like innards, and I like lots of fruit
and yogurt _ arrived on time, and so did the four fat Sunday
newspapers we'd asked for.
</P>
<P>
   We left feeling very rested and very pleased, and eager to get
back to the baby at home, which was part of the point of going away
in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Which hotel to choose? It depends. If you want cutting-edge
ambiance, a happening neighborhood, and a feeling that you might be
among the famous and the fabulous, stay at the Clarence. If you
want to unwind from your incredibly busy life in circumstances of
such luxury that you don't even care what is going on outside your
room, stay at the Merrion.
</P>
<P>
   Or do what I did, and stay at both.
</P>
<P>
   Napping or not
</P>
<P>
   The Merrion Hotel, with 145 rooms and suites, is at 21-24 Upper
Merrion St.; telephone (353-1) 603-0600, fax (353-1) 603-0700.
Double rooms start at $309 a night for two, including tax but not
breakfast. (Prices were calculated at $1.47 to the Irish punt.)
Continental breakfast is $16, Irish breakfast $19 a person. A
three-course dinner for two with a bottle of wine at Patrick
Guilbaud costs around $175. The restaurant also serves a two-course
set lunch for $30 a person without drinks. In the spa, the
deep-cleansing back treatment, 45 minutes, is $59; an hour-long
facial, $74.
</P>
<P>
   The Clarence, with 50 rooms and suites, is at 6-8 Wellington
Quay; (353-1) 670-9000, fax (353-1) 670-7800. Double rooms start at
$257 a night for two, including tax but not breakfast, which is $16
a person for Continental, $19 for Irish. A three-course dinner at
the Tea Room restaurant with a bottle of wine costs around $100 for
two. A two-course set lunch is $20 a person with coffee.

KEEP DAAL STRONG WITH NEW CONTRACT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Omar Daal has a decision to make.
</P>
<P>
   He can play the hero, bow to national pressure, succumb to all
the pats on the back. Or, when his bust-out season is in the books,
he can rest his wing for the winter, even if it means alienating
the neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Please his country. Or please his employer.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks should make this simple.
</P>
<P>
   If they can rip up Jorge Fabregas' arbitration award, surely
they can avoid potential disaster with Daal. Because the last thing
you want is your potential ace leaving his arm in Venezuela, piling
up innings in winter ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know what we're going to do,'' Daal said. ``We're
going to talk to manager, the pitching coach and make a decision.
I'm the ace in Caracas (Venezuela). Everybody loves me there.
Everybody wants to see me pitch, you know? But if they give me a
new contract where I can take care of myself, they'll have to
understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Since their 8-31 start, the Diamondbacks have posted a better
record than eight of their major league counterparts. Part of this
is because of the incredible emergence of Daal, a left-hander with
a stocked arsenal, a guy who has drawn rave reviews from pitcher
Curt Schilling to Cubs' manager Jim Riggleman to nearly every
opponent who has waved a bat in vain.
</P>
<P>
   If this guy is legitimate _ and all signs are in his corner _
the Diamondbacks should avoid arbitration with Daal, who currently
is earning $575,000. They should give him a nice raise under the
condition he refrain from winter ball. Or, at the very least,
severely limit his appearances.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to understand, the Latin players have done this their
whole lives,'' Diamondbacks Manager Buck Showalter said. ``And many
of them do it as a way to supplement their income.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Wilson Alvarez, who hails from Daal's hometown of
Maracaibo. Every winter, he would feel the pressure from his
countrymen. Every winter, the White Sox would cringe while Alvarez
continued to pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Alvarez is 28, recovering from tendinitis in his shoulder.
After missing six weeks, he has lost six of his last seven
decisions. Coupled with a five-year, $35 million deal, Alvarez is
tagged as a huge bust in Tampa Bay. And the pressure is so great
he's begun sniping at teammates.
</P>
<P>
   There is a lesson to be learned here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Omar is a sharp young man,'' Showalter said. ``He realizes
where he is contractually in his career. There are a lot of things
he and the people who look out for him have to think about.''
</P>
<P>
   That includes the Diamondbacks, who may have unearthed a jewel
in the expansion draft, a guy seizing his first real opportunity as
a starter. In three stints with the Dodgers, Daal was relegated to
the bullpen. He accumulated nine career starts in separate tours
with the Expos and Blue Jays, teams that also mistakenly slotted
him as a Paul Assenmacher clone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not surprised because I know what I can do,'' Daal said.
``As a reliever, I couldn't use all of my pitches. I'd throw
fastballs and sliders. Now, I'm going to throw any pitch anywhere
in the count. I'm going to show everyone that I can be a starter.''
</P>
<P>
   No doubt, he's supremely confident. He has a dizzying array of
pitches, including four different speeds of change-up. He throws
them all for strikes.
</P>
<P>
   If he had enough innings, his ERA of 2.58 would rank sixth in
the National League, while his opponent batting average of .233
would rate fifth. If Daal averages 6.2 innings over his final seven
starts, he will qualify for ERA recognition.
</P>
<P>
   He also will have thrown over 162 innings _ nearly double his
previous high.
</P>
<P>
   Do you really want this guy moonlighting in Venezuela, where he
threw 80 innings last winter?
</P>
<P>
   Not a chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough,'' Daal said. ``I grew up there. It's not fair to
the people there who want to see me pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   So, how do you tell a man not to be hero to his people? To the
ones that loved him long before he put on the purple?
</P>
<P>
   Pay him, that's how. &QL;

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With his grand jury testimony and his brief and
defiant public admission of an inappropriate relationship with
Monica Lewinsky Monday night, President Clinton is hoping, as he
has so many times in the past, that the public will respond with
forgiveness and not disgust.
</P>
<P>
   The president, relying on polls and his own sense of the
public's weariness with a sordid story of presidential sex, took a
calculated gamble that he can escape indictment by prosecutors or
impeachment by lawmakers over what he declared was a private
matter. In his testimony and his testy four-minute speech to the
nation, he offered partial admissions but refused to answer many of
the questions that have swamped his presidency since January.
</P>
<P>
   And almost before he finished his grudging televised confession,
he turned on his inquisitors and demanded that the investigation of
his private life come to an end.
</P>
<P>
   He confessed, he expressed regret and he asked for instant
redemption.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it is time _ in fact it is past time _ to move on,'' the
president said with anger, not anguish, in his eyes, laying the
blame for seven months of national trauma on his political enemies
and Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   His words of apology and contrition were belied by a tone that
was laced with anger and in an important way, unrepentant.
</P>
<P>
   He left no doubt that his strategy is the same as it has been
for the past seven months: to give as little ground as possible.
</P>
<P>
   The president sacrificed some of the dignity of his exalted
office by admitting a relationship with Ms. Lewinsky that was
``wrong.'' But he implied that the investigation that has cornered
him was just as wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has gone on too long, cost too much and hurt too many
innocent people,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   He sought to justify his misleading testimony and his months of
resistance to federal prosecutors as a fitting response to a
politically inspired invasion of privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is also counting on a continued strong economy and the
forbearance of a public aware that he was a less than faithful
husband even as they were twice electing him to the nation's
highest office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even presidents have private lives,'' Clinton declared.
</P>
<P>
   But he was largely silent on the more serious accusations _
conspiracy, obstruction of justice, witness tampering and suborning
perjury.
</P>
<P>
   His four and a half hours of questioning by Starr and three of
Starr's deputies was hostile and only added to the anger the
president and his top aides feel about Starr's intrusive inquiry,
according to lawyers present at the session.
</P>
<P>
   The president's lead private counsel, David Kendall, signaled
the continuing hostility in a brief statement after the testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hopeful that the president's testimony will finally
bring closure to the independent counsel's more than four-year and
over $40 million investigation, which has culminated in an
investigation of the president's private life,'' the ordinarily
mild-mannered Kendall said with evident contempt.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall said later that Clinton had refused to answer many of
Starr's questions and, while candid, the president was less than
complete in many of his responses.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's limited expression of contrition was only part of an
emerging White House strategy to continue fighting Starr on broad
legal and political fronts.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has privately raged at Starr, believing he is a
Republican artisan and a blue-nosed moralist prying into the
president's private behavior. He has dispatched a dozen aides and
defenders to demonize Starr and question the legitimacy of his
investigation. That explains his long refusal to answer Starr's
questions about the Lewinsky matter and the scorched-earth legal
strategy he has pursued to delay his date with the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Erskine Bowles, the White House chief of staff, began calling
leading Democrats within minutes of the end of Clinton's grand jury
session, coordinating a political counteroffensive. The Rev. Jesse
Jackson appeared on television Monday night to hammer Starr for
intruding on the private lives of the president, his wife and
daughter.
</P>
<P>
   If anyone thought Bill Clinton would come away deeply humbled
and considering resignation, they were wrong. He will fight.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's most difficult day in office is now behind
him. What now lies ahead?
</P>
<P>
   Unlike President Reagan after the Iran-Contra debacle, Clinton
cannot simply confess error, shoulder responsibility and dismiss a
handful of top aides. In the Lewinsky matter, the fault was not in
the president's policy, but in himself. It is vastly harder to
repair a reputation than to repudiate a failed policy.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the investigation by Starr is far from over. Whatever
errors or evasions Clinton admitted today must be weighed in light
of voluminous evidence collected over seven months that the
prosecutor may believe add up to the ``high crimes and
misdemeanors'' standard for impeachment set by the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   It is now up to Starr how to portray the president's actions and
his words in a report expected to be delivered to Congress this
fall. But however the president is ultimately judged by Congress,
he must also confront the judgment of the citizenry, which has thus
far been indulgent of its wayward president while also finding his
personal standards of morality and honesty distasteful.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   His job approval ratings have remained in the mid-60's. But a
growing proportion of the public came to believe he was stingy with
the truth, a fatal affliction for a politician with ambitions for a
legacy among the top ranks of American presidents.
</P>
<P>
   The Lewinsky saga would be little more than a sordid national
soap opera if the stakes were not so great. Many observers believe
that the Serbs in Kosovo, Saddam Hussein in Iraq and perhaps even
the terrorists who attacked United States embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania were emboldened by a perceived power vacuum at the White
House. ``It is no coincidence,'' said a top-ranking official of the
State Department, ``that the really bad guys of the world, like
Slobodan Milosevic and Saddam Hussein, have picked this summer to
cause the United States trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   And the American people, enjoying economic bounty and 20-year,
record-low gasoline prices, have sacrificed a measure of national
pride because of the sex-stained spectacle playing out in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``This scandal has prevented people from feeling better about
the country because the principal complaint about the country is
its moral climate,'' said Andrew Kohut, director of the Pew
Research Center for the People and the Press.
</P>
<P>
   And despite recent polling that indicates Americans are willing
to again forgive the president his trespasses, Kohut said the
public verdict is not so certain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public has the last and often a counter-intuitive word on
issues like this,'' Kohut said. ``The public is not so predictable
and the impact on the president and the presidency I think is yet
to be determined.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he falls from grace, we will look for someone with grace to
replace him in 2000,'' Kohut concluded. ``It will be the equivalent
of Jimmy Carter in 1976, a search for character.''

MURRAY'S DEATH A LOSS FOR SPORTS AND LANGUAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   REDMOND, Wash. _ As with everything else, the business of
writing about sports isn't what it was. Heroes are harder to find,
stories are more complicated, motives are muddled ... well, I don't
have to tell you. You read sports.
</P>
<P>
   What you might not know is sports just got harder, more
complicated and more muddled. The guy who did the best job of
sorting it out, elevating it, humbling it, describing it and
laughing at it, died late Sunday, and I can't tell if I'm more sad
or irked.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Murray, of the Los Angeles Times and the English language,
hero of the chroniclers of heroes, had the audacity to depart
without a successor, despite thousands of applicants, including me.
</P>
<P>
   He would never dream that such a thing would be needed, because
he always thought what he did for a living was mostly silly and
shouldn't be done by respectable people. He was right, as he almost
always was, but that didn't change the fact that his fellow
sportswriters worshipped him like they never heralded any jock.
</P>
<P>
   The feeling wasn't limited to his professional brethren. Readers
of the Times, and millions who read his nationally syndicated
columns over four decades, were enchanted, enthralled and sometimes
enraged by the wit and insight he used like a sword.
</P>
<P>
   If you haven't had the pleasure ... well, whereinhell have you
been? Since 1961, the man rarely missed a big sports event in the
nation or world, and saw it better than any of us, even though he
has been legally blind for about the past 20 years. His columns
became the definitive, often hilarious, summary of every event,
carried by every newspaper that wanted a sports section that didn't
fall asleep in a reader's hands.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, at 77, he attended one of the most surreal events in
sports history, the heavyweight fight in Las Vegas that ended when
Mike Tyson bit the ear of Evander Holyfield. As many of us
scrambled to explain the significance and the weirdness, here was
Murray's grasp of the absurd on a tight deadline:
</P>
<P>
   ``As this is written, newsmen are asking whether Holyfield will
give Tyson a return match. Give Tyson a return fight?! What would
Evander have to do _ put ketchup on his ears?! Mustard on his
nose?!
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike Tyson should be allowed to fight only a thing that can
bite back ... I don't know what he could do to restore his dignity
and professionalism. Become a vegetarian, for starters.''
</P>
<P>
   So much for the theory that Murray was down to fumes. From
beginning to end, he was the wordsmith, the thinker and the
storyteller that most of us wanted to be, never were, never will
be.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from my limp hi-howaya handshake as an awestruck kid
reporter at the Rose Bowl, my first real encounter with the legend
illuminated the part apart from the writer. On my first World
Series assignment as a freshly appointed P-I columnist in 1987, I
was in the auxiliary press box down the left-field line at Busch
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The event's novelty for me was exhilarating, until I saw the
name on the press-table seat next to me _ Jim Murray. I started
spasming like Daffy Duck encountering Martian monsters.
</P>
<P>
   He sat down, we shook hands, I mumbled something vapid about how
much I liked his work, then sat there, hanging on to my chair for
dear life.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting next to him, what in the world can I write that won't
come out like the blather of a 2-year-old? I spent years reading
his stuff out loud and laughing, amazed at how he did it; now I
could do little but sneak glimpses at his screen to see for myself.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he smelled the fear. Maybe he'd seen it before. He started
making small talk about the game. Soon enough he said, ``I have no
idea what to say about this game. Got any ideas?''
</P>
<P>
   Me? You're asking me? Well, uh, I think maybe the pitching, or
maybe the hitting, or ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, you're right,'' he said. I can't exactly remember my
inanities, or what else he said, or what I wrote, but getting
validation from Murray, however gratuitous, broke my mental
lock-up.
</P>
<P>
   I learned later that that sort of humble social graciousness was
a Murray hallmark. No one was beneath him, everyone he encountered
was made to seem special. Everything he wrote about was felt, not
just understood, by the reader.
</P>
<P>
   He was one of the first big-time national sports commentators to
rely upon the truth as his shield. His honesty and humor opened the
door for Howard Cosell, Sports Illustrated, the ESPN wiseacres,
talk radio and nickel-dimers around the country like me who enjoyed
sports, liked language better and savored edgy newspapering above
all.
</P>
<P>
   I guess it's foolish to be irked. There is no successor to a
pioneer, just followers. We are left to dream about treating
subjects so deftly and words so majestically.
</P>
<P>
   The hole in American daily journalism, large with the deaths
this year of Chicago's Mike Royko and San Francisco's Herb Caen,
grows immense. And sports are out one more hero.
</P>

MCCOMBS' OFF-SEASON WORK YIELDS PROMOTION AT LINEBACKER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE SHAPPELL  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A special teams player for the final third of last season, Tony
McCombs hardly seemed a candidate to advance to a starting outside
linebacker spot this year.
</P>
<P>
   McCombs' emergence as an impact player has been the surprise of
training camp so far. It's perhaps less of a surprise to his
position coach, Glenn Pires, who worked with him in the off-season
to learn the intricacies of his position.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony plays with a high motor,'' Pires said. ``He plays hard
and he plays physical.''
</P>
<P>
   But tackling the nuances of the defense proved more elusive to
McCombs than tackling, say, Terry Allen. His whirlwind rookie
season hadn't been an adequate learning forum.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got hurt,'' said McCombs, who suffered a stress fracture in
his foot at midseason. ``When a young player first comes in here,
it's tough enough learning this system, but that injury set me
back. I'd never been hurt before. I thought I'd never get
injured.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though McCombs healed in time to play the final five games,
almost exclusively on special teams, he didn't appear to be a
contender for a starting spot this season. But when middle
linebacker Eric Hill left via free agency and the coaches moved Ron
McKinnon to the middle from the right side, they had few
alternatives outside.
</P>
<P>
   McCombs was promoted to the first team over Terry Irving and
Patrick Sapp after the first intrasquad scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Glenn spent a lot of extra time with me,'' McCombs said. ``I
knew the spot was wide open for the best man to win. Right now, I
think I've got a good opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   It's one that few sixth-round picks from small schools _ McCombs
was drafted in 1997 out of Eastern Kentucky _ get.
</P>
<P>
   McCombs caught the coaches' eyes early. He is big (6 feet 2, 246
pounds) and athletic _ ``A thick guy,'' Pires said _ and has
strength at the point of attack. He blocked a punt in Week 3 at
Washington that set up a touchdown. He made 13 tackles on the
special teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was coming along,'' Pires said. But he wasn't quite there.
</P>
<P>
   Those private tutorials with Pires _ observing, absorbing and
retaining _ along with the personal friendship McCombs struck up
with Jamir Miller, who had played the right side before moving to
the left last year, are proving valuable.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said McCombs became a student of the game, ``the first
thing necessary for anyone who wants to take his game to the next
level.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But it wasn't so much by me sitting him down and telling him
everything,'' said Miller, the senior member of the linebacking
corps. ``It was more Tony watching me, seeing how I did it. He had
all the tools. He just didn't know how best to use them in this
defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``That took me back a couple of years because that's exactly how
I learned from Seth Joyner. I learned everything from Seth, but it
was more by me watching than asking. I see Tony now doing some of
the same things. Glenn encouraged me to talk to him and work with
him, and we built a personal friendship.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd better be ready. Teams have established in preseason that
they're going to run away from our left side. They're attacking the
opposite side. Tony is going to get his opportunities to make
plays.''
</P>
<P>
   While the early returns on McCombs were encouraging enough for
the coaches to promote him, the appointment is not permanent.
Irving remains in contention _ the coaches like his experience,
professionalism and playmaking.
</P>
<P>
   But McCombs is the leader in the clubhouse with his ability to
battle a tight end, or take on a fullback on an isolation play, or
rush a passer.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no such thing as a comfort zone,'' said Dave McGinnis,
defensive coordinator. ``That's not where we are as a team, and
that's not where we are as a defense.'' &QL;

EXPERIENCE LANDS BROWN NO. 2 JOB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hitting his first nine passes Friday night didn't clinch the
backup quarterback job for veteran Dave Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did directing a drive in the final four minutes to run out
the clock in the 27-24 victory over the Chicago Bears.
</P>
<P>
   The clincher was Brown's 53 career starts to Stoney Case's one.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Vince Tobin announced Monday that Brown will begin the
season as the No. 2 quarterback behind starter Jake Plummer and
will play the fourth quarter of Saturday's preseason game against
Seattle at Sun Devil Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stoney has had a tremendous camp, and I think he's very, very
close,'' Tobin said. ``But sometimes as a head coach, you have to
go on gut feelings. The experience Dave has . . . if he has to come
off the bench and play, you want that experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Case and Brown have been effective running the team's new West
Coast offense in the preseason. Case, a fourth-year pro, completed
12 of 21 passes for 126 yards and one touchdown in the preseason
opener at Detroit. Brown was 16 for 24 for 121 yards and was
intercepted once against the Bears.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I had to come in and play well against the Bears,''
said Brown, a three-year starter for the New York Giants who signed
a two-year, $2.5 million free-agent deal with the Cardinals in the
off-season. ``I couldn't afford to come in and waste my
opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Case was disappointed with the decision but chose his words
carefully.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knows how I feel,'' he said. ``It's no secret.'' &QL;  &QL; 
Talks to resume &QL;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After not speaking for more than a week and a half, the
Cardinals and the agent for unsigned first-round draft pick Andre
Wadsworth are expected to resume negotiations soon.
</P>
<P>
   Wadsworth, the Florida State defensive end who was the third
pick overall, is one of only two first-round picks not signed. The
other is Nebraska defensive tackle Jason Peter, the 14th pick by
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Penn State running back Curtis Enis, the fifth selection
overall, signed a three-year, $3.6 million with the Chicago Bears
on Monday. The deal included a $3 million signing bonus but no
voidable years or buybacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't seem to be close contractually,'' said Wadsworth's
agent, Eugene Parker. ``But we're still maintaining a positive
attitude to get things done.''
</P>
<P>
   Tobin said Wadsworth's 25-day absence from training camp hasn't
been a distraction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's a high priority in the players' minds,'' he
said. ``They have their own jobs and their own families to feed. I
said from the beginning I'd like to have him. When he gets here,
he'll have holes in his game that you never catch up. We've moved
on with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Short shots &QL;  &QL; 
The Cardinals released four rookies on Monday _ seventh-round draft
pick Ron Janes, a fullback from Missouri; punter Marcus Williams of
Tempe McClintock and Arizona State; defensive end Terry Wilkerson
and defensive lineman Desmond Byrd.
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver Rob Moore missed practice because of the birth of
his son, Satchel.
</P>
<P>
   Fullback Larry Centers (hamstring) and cornerback Ty Howard
(knee) returned to drills.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals said their attendance for the Bears game was
33,082, not the 30,983 announced. &QL;  &QL;

BLIND-SIDE BLOCKING KEY TO ASU'S SMITH  
 LEFT TACKLE PROTECTS QB IN OBSCURITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BECKY GRUHN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PAYSON _ Marvel Smith carries one of the heaviest yet least
heralded responsibilities on the Arizona State football team.
</P>
<P>
   As left offensive tackle, he's the man charged with protecting
quarterback Ryan Kealy's blind side.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the most high-profile position on the line with a
right-handed quarterback,'' offensive coordinator Dan Cozzetto
said. `You're playing out in space a lot, in no-man's land.
Marvel's kind of on an island out there, always going against the
best pass rusher on defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``His game's gotta be right every snap.''
</P>
<P>
   The importance of the job doesn't guarantee acclaim, however. In
fact, if his name wasn't printed on the back of his No. 71 Sun
Devils jersey, chances are most fans wouldn't even know Smith was
on the roster.
</P>
<P>
   It's a life of anonymity masked by a helmet and pads. A life
with which the 6-foot-6, 300-pound sophomore is perfectly content.
</P>
<P>
   ``My name is probably the last one mentioned after any win,'' he
joked. ``You know you're not going to get any spotlight at this
position. I'm used to it and really don't even think much about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   But while Smith doesn't attract the attention of teammates such
as J.R. Redmond and Kealy, the sophomore has hardly gone unnoticed.
He's already being touted as an honors candidate in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Last year as a redshirt freshman, Smith played in 10 games,
starting seven. He and right guard Victor Leyva enter their
sophomore seasons with the opportunity to join the small, elite
fraternity of offensive linemen starting for four consecutive
years.
</P>
<P>
   Smith has proven himself capable of rising to a challenge. He
was the first in a family of five siblings growing up in Oakland,
Calif., to graduate high school and attend college. He was also the
first lineman from Oakland's Skyline High School to receive a
Division I scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   Now entering his third year enrolled at ASU with a major in
interdisciplinary studies and a minor in English, Smith has not
been forgotten by his hometown fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``People call me about every week to see how I'm doing,'' he
said. ``They're giving me support every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago as a junior at Skyline High School, Smith was
envisioning a future just down the road at California. He gave the
Golden Bears an oral commitment.
</P>
<P>
   But after a solid senior season, Smith began getting noticed
outside his home state. He broke his premature promise to the
Golden Bears, telling the coaching staff he wanted to step back and
weigh his options.
</P>
<P>
   Their reaction was anything but understanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``They made it seem like I owed it to them to go there and that
I wouldn't have been noticed as much my senior year without them,''
Smith said. ``There was a lot of pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   After meeting Cozzetto, Smith was convinced ASU would be the
best fit for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically why I came here was to get out and do my own
thing,'' Smith said. ``There's a lot of pressures back home, and I
just wanted to get away and become myself.''
</P>
<P>
   For Smith, that's best accomplished after taking off his uniform
and leaving the game on the field. It's during that time, time away
from football, when he's able to focus all his energy on his other
passion _ writing.
</P>
<P>
   From poetry to short stories to music lyrics, Smith uses his
papers as a canvas and his words and thoughts as paint.
</P>
<P>
   He has dreams of using those skills to work with children or
perhaps even own his own record company someday. Then of course,
there's always those visions of working on Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say I think about playing in the NFL every day, but
I think about it a lot,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Cozzetto isn't ruling out any future possibilities for his
soft-spoken lineman.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a very gifted person,'' Cozzetto said. ``His work ethic
is unbelievable. He's got a goal in mind, he sets dreams and he
works hard to achieve them. You can't say enough about him.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Smith should prepare for that spotlight after all. &QL;

medina, of Fez and almost all other ancient city centers in this

The problem here is how to fix up the medina without fundamentally

   SIMIANE-LA-ROTONDE, FRANCE _ ``In 1949, when I moved here, there
were children and shops,'' said Martin Gilbert, the retired mason
of Simiane-la-Rotonde, an ancient hilltop village in Provence
surrounded by fields of lavender.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a baker, two grocers, cafes... (but) the young have
all gone off to Marseilles, like my daughter. Now I rattle around
this big house with my wife,'' he said, jabbing a finger at a fine
17th-century stone four-story house shadowed by the bell tower.
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert is one of the few local people to be seen in the
village's charming but empty streets, carving miniature versions of
Provencal borries (stone huts) in a garage to sell to tourists.
</P>
<P>
   A photograph by Henri Cartier-Bresson, exhibited recently in a
London gallery, shows a gaggle of children in Simiane's old covered
market a few decades ago, prancing before the camera. Today the
market is pristine and silent, but for the sound of Gilbert
tap-tapping his borries in the street below.
</P>
<P>
   A similar silence envelops the village pump, where not that long
ago women gathered to wash their clothes.
</P>
<P>
   The church of Ste. Victoire is locked. At the turn of the
century it was a thriving parish, and the patron saint's feast day
was the high point of the year.
</P>
<P>
   A summoner clattered around the winding streets, shouting out a
long program of events which included the blessing of the entire
population of 1,300 in the square and a great procession headed by
four women carrying the reliquary of Ste. Victoire around the
village, followed by dancing and feasting.
</P>
<P>
   These days an old priest comes from the famous cheese town of
Banon once a month to say Mass to a congregation of about 20.
</P>
<P>
   At the neighboring hilltop village of Oppedette, the church is
shut all the time. ``Except for funerals,'' one villager said. ``We
lock it to keep out vandals _ unemployed people from the city.''
</P>
<P>
   With tourism unable to provide an income for many in villages
off the beaten track, the blue and purple fields of lavender that
unfold like a pleated peasant's skirt beneath the walls of Simiane
and Oppedette perhaps offer the only lifeline by which the local
communities will survive.
</P>
<P>
   A few decades ago, even this industry seemed on the edge of
extinction. Farmers were giving up the struggle to scratch a living
out of stony fields on steep hillsides, and then searching for an
often unscrupulous middleman to buy up the lavender and sell it on.
</P>
<P>
   The market was shrinking, as foreign firms turned to synthetic
substitutes for their oil, or to ultra-cheap ``cloned'' lavender
from Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
   But French lavender today is big business once again, as public
interest booms in herbs and alternative medicine. Synthetic
substitutes are out.
</P>
<P>
   In the nearby town of Apt, a few miles from the much-publicized
Museum of Lavender in Cordes, most shops heavily promote lavender
products. One is devoted to nothing else, selling lavender soap,
lavender shampoo, artful postcards showing lavender fields in
various shades of purple, oils of course, sprays for the kitchens
and potpourris.
</P>
<P>
   The piped music is of cicadas, presumably to give visitors the
feeling of being in a lavender field.
</P>
<P>
   The cognoscenti can muse over whether to buy bags of seeds of
``Lavandin'' (the hybrid, cheaper stuff) or pure ``lavande,'' the
infinitely more expensive wild variety, which only grows above 800
meters (2,500 feet).
</P>
<P>
   The church has tapped into a burgeoning ``New Age'' perception
that herbs, monks and alternative medicine are all intertwined.
</P>
<P>
   At the Cistercian abbey of Senanque and at Ganagobie, the monks
have opened sophisticated shops, selling a huge range of lavender
items far removed in quality from English cathedral shop tat.
</P>
<P>
   As well as their own generous range of lavender soaps, oils and
creams, the abbeys promote books in several languages on monastery
herb gardens and the ancient ``secrets'' of lavender, secrets
presumably preserved over the centuries only by the clergy (which
wouldn't be surprising, as the abbeys sit in fields of the stuff).
</P>
<P>
   Five drops drunk in a glass of wine, I read in one book, can
cure ``hysterical vapors.''
</P>
<P>
   The revival of the once moribund lavender industry of Provence
is not, however, a mere side-effect of the growing attraction to
New Age mysticism and alternative medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Simiane's farmers have helped themselves too, setting up a
co-operative that dispatched the middlemen to oblivion. Out, too,
went ``romantic'' looking scythes (except for folk festivals) and
fat copper stills.
</P>
<P>
   While the tourists trundle around Simiane's pottery shop, the
village farmers sweat in the burning August heat, taking their crop
to the large and distinctly unpicturesque modern distillery that
the co-op has set up on the edge of the village.
</P>
<P>
   Mothers and sons join in with their men, stacking the
fast-browning bales into the giant vat. Clouds of steam rise
through the stalks, carrying the precious oil in pipes through a
cold water tank to rows of barrels underneath.
</P>
<P>
   The undulating lavender fields of Simiane and Oppedette may look
as if they are kept on for the benefit of the heritage industry or
for tourists, but the product is, in fact, sold direct to Proctor &AMP;
Gamble and Colgate.
</P>
<P>
   The Cooperative Agricole des Plantes a Parfum de Provence and
its 290 members have seized almost a third of the total French
lavender oil production, three times more than before the co-op was
set up 15 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Its still a hard living,'' says Claude Coutant, a 30-year-old
farmer, laughing mirthlessly at the notion that the industry's
revival has ensured farmers a comfortable life.
</P>
<P>
   Perspiration streamed from his brow as the lavender was
pitchforked into the vat amid wafts of scalding steam. ``Whatever
money we make goes back into investing in equipment.''
</P>
<P>
   Coutant's father and grandfather farmed lavender before him, and
so will he. Lavender will guarantee the survival of a way of life,
if not prosperity. &QL;

   SEATTLE _ Lisa Wessels describes herself as ``pro-Clinton'' and
Scot Baker says he is ``anti-Clinton,'' opposed points of view that
have not prevented the Seattle couple from planning to marry. And
when the two 30-year-olds met after work Monday evening and watched
President Clinton speak from the White House, both initially chose
the same word to describe the address: ``embarrassing.''
</P>
<P>
   But their words, it turned out, did not mean the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Wessels, a licensing specialist, felt badly for Clinton.
``I can't believe that he had to do this, forced to stand up and
talk about his private life like that,'' she said. ``It was
surreal. It's like I wasn't watching the president of the United
States, I was watching Richard Dreyfus play the president of the
United States in some bad movie. I feel sorry for him.''
</P>
<P>
   But for Baker, a recruiter for the Microsoft company, the
embarrassment was for Americans in general. ``I always told my
friends he has no integrity, that squinty little twinkle in his
eye,'' he said. ``Now we know for sure. But I'm not happy about it.
It's embarrassing for the country. This is our president.''
</P>
<P>
   Around the nation, in their homes and crowded around television
sets in public places, Americans in huge numbers stopped what they
were doing for four minutes Monday night to watch Clinton speak.
But if such communal events often serve to bind people together in
the face of a national tragedy or emergency, a series of
conversations around the country afterward suggested that Clinton's
speech had left people as divided about him as ever.
</P>
<P>
   While many people, reflecting polls over the last several months
and instant polls taken Monday night, still think that the matter
is not enough to warrant impeachment of Clinton, a clear
undercurrent in others' characterizations was that now, more than
ever, Clinton needs to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``This man lied in front of the nation, and he basically
admitted it,'' said Mike Bagdassarov of Baltimore, an intelligence
analyst for the Maryland state police. ``He shouldn't be president.
It's that simple.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Jim Eichelberger, an Atlanta lawyer: ``I think it was
typical Clinton _ dishonest, blaming others, just what I
anticipated. He owes it to the Democratic Party and the American
people to resign.''
</P>
<P>
   And many of those who were inclined to forgive the president
said they didn't believe his speech would put the matter to rest,
partly because, in their view, he did not really accept full
responsibility for what happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's still trying to weasel out of it,'' said Janice Scallon,
27, an independent contractor for social-service programs in
Chicago. ``It wasn't even a full apology. Instead, he said it was
inappropriate. If he just said, hey, he had sex with her, then it
would be over.''
</P>
<P>
   While very few people seemed to watch the speech and find
themselves liking the president any better than they had before,
many said that they still felt strongly that the matter should be
put to rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess if you can't trust your president, that's something
you've got to think really hard about,'' said Buddy Fry, manager of
Slick Willie's Pool Hall in Houston, an establishment that got its
name long before Clinton's critics gave him the same name in the
1992 campaign. ``But hey, the economy is doing so well, as well as
I can ever remember. If I have to weigh the economy against his sex
life, I guess I'd have to go with the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   A New York Times/CBS News Poll taken immediately after the
speech showed a continuation of the strong public desire to move
beyond the scandal. Sixty-three percent of the respondents said the
Lewinsky matter should be dropped, now that the president has
testified to the grand jury and addressed the nation, compared with
18 percent who said he should resign and 12 percent who said
Congress should begin impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   And 65 percent said Clinton should have made a public statement
about the relationship sooner, even as his job approval rating
remained steady, in the high 60s.
</P>
<P>
   The poll, based on a survey of 396 adults, has a sampling error
of 5 percentage points. Such instant, one-night polls are
considered less reliable than the typical New York Times/CBS News
Polls, which are based on larger samples and conducted over several
days. Moreover, initial reactions sometimes change.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There was little expectation before the speech that the
president could say much to justify himself, and little feeling
afterwards that he had succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was nothing he could say,'' said Jeff Lewelling, a
project coordinator for a welfare-to-work program in Chicago, who
watched the speech at a local pub. ``His credibility was totally
shot.''
</P>
<P>
   In Austin, Texas, Shedric Jones, a 34-year-old shoeshine
operator, said he was relieved, but not surprised, that the
president had finally come out and explained to the American people
that he had been wrong.
</P>
<P>
   But Larry Foster, a 57-year-old pilot for American Airlines in
Dallas, said he thought the president's remarks fell short. ``He
was hardly apologetic. I never saw any honest apology. He said,
`it's a personal matter.' It's not a personal matter. It affects
every person in the United States. He swore to uphold the truth. It
was a very poor apology. It wasn't sincere. He wasn't contrite.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, some people felt the opposite, that the president
was too contrite.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish he had said, `Yes, I did it' _ everyone knew that,
anyway _ but then was more forceful in saying, I did nothing
illegal,'' said Andrea Wagner, an arts administrator in Seattle.
``That this whole investigation is wrong, it's costing too much
time and money. But instead he was like a dog with his tail between
his legs. He was so caught up in being apologetic.''
</P>
<P>
   In Miami Beach, a group of friends who had gathered for a small
dinner party agreed afterwards that the president's appearance had
done little to change their basic views of the man.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought all along he was guilty and now it's been
confirmed,'' said Howard Schimmel, 56, who owns a company that
manufactures accessories for the cigar industry.
</P>
<P>
   And a surprising number of people volunteered that they found
themselves thinking about his wife and daughter as he gave the
speech.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Doeckmann, 45, a customer service representative for a
telephone supply distributor in the Memphis area, said he felt
deeply sorry for Chelsea Clinton, but not her mother. ``I think she
is so interested in his staying in office she will do whatever it
takes to stay there,'' he said. ``But I would like to know exactly
what she really thinks about this. I don't think we ever will know,
but I'd like to.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Chris Welch, a sporting business operator in Boston: ``I'm
really interested in the Hillary end now. Hillary and Bill both
have always acted in their own self-interests. I'm interested to
see how this plays out.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's appeal that the nation focus on other issues bothered
many who watched the speech, who described that as a transparent
attempt at diversion.
</P>
<P>
   The speech, with its criticism of Kenneth Starr's investigation,
``kind of reminded me of Nixon's first Watergate speeches, talking
about how important detente was,'' said Joe Heinen, a bartender.
``Pretty shifty, actually.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Drucker, a nursing student from Bellingham, Wash.,
described herself as ``livid'' after the speech. ``It really burned
me up when he said we should turn to the nation's problems. As far
as I'm concerned, what he did goes to the heart of the nation's
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the Crenshaw District of Los Angeles at the Boulevard
Cafi, where the walls are decorated with posters of Frederick
Douglass, Martin Luther King, Malcom X and Joe Louis, diners said
they agreed completely with the president that the nation had much
more pressing problems than his sex life.

   SIMIANE-LA-ROTONDE, FRANCE _ ``In 1949, when I moved here, there
were children and shops,'' said Martin Gilbert, the retired mason
of Simiane-la-Rotonde, an ancient hilltop village in Provence
surrounded by fields of lavender.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a baker, two grocers, cafes... (but) the young have
all gone off to Marseilles, like my daughter. Now I rattle around
this big house with my wife,'' he said, jabbing a finger at a fine
17th-century stone four-story house shadowed by the bell tower.
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert is one of the few local people to be seen in the
village's charming but empty streets, carving miniature versions of
Provencal borries (stone huts) in a garage to sell to tourists.
</P>
<P>
   A photograph by Henri Cartier-Bresson, exhibited recently in a
London gallery, shows a gaggle of children in Simiane's old covered
market a few decades ago, prancing before the camera. Today the
market is pristine and silent, but for the sound of Gilbert
tap-tapping his borries in the street below.
</P>
<P>
   A similar silence envelops the village pump, where not that long
ago women gathered to wash their clothes.
</P>
<P>
   The church of Ste. Victoire is locked. At the turn of the
century it was a thriving parish, and the patron saint's feast day
was the high point of the year.
</P>
<P>
   A summoner clattered around the winding streets, shouting out a
long program of events which included the blessing of the entire
population of 1,300 in the square and a great procession headed by
four women carrying the reliquary of Ste. Victoire around the
village, followed by dancing and feasting.
</P>
<P>
   These days an old priest comes from the famous cheese town of
Banon once a month to say Mass to a congregation of about 20.
</P>
<P>
   At the neighboring hilltop village of Oppedette, the church is
shut all the time. ``Except for funerals,'' one villager said. ``We
lock it to keep out vandals _ unemployed people from the city.''
</P>
<P>
   With tourism unable to provide an income for many in villages
off the beaten track, the blue and purple fields of lavender that
unfold like a pleated peasant's skirt beneath the walls of Simiane
and Oppedette perhaps offer the only lifeline by which the local
communities will survive.
</P>
<P>
   A few decades ago, even this industry seemed on the edge of
extinction. Farmers were giving up the struggle to scratch a living
out of stony fields on steep hillsides, and then searching for an
often unscrupulous middleman to buy up the lavender and sell it on.
</P>
<P>
   The market was shrinking, as foreign firms turned to synthetic
substitutes for their oil, or to ultra-cheap ``cloned'' lavender
from Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
   But French lavender today is big business once again, as public
interest booms in herbs and alternative medicine. Synthetic
substitutes are out.
</P>
<P>
   In the nearby town of Apt, a few miles from the much-publicized
Museum of Lavender in Cordes, most shops heavily promote lavender
products. One is devoted to nothing else, selling lavender soap,
lavender shampoo, artful postcards showing lavender fields in
various shades of purple, oils of course, sprays for the kitchens
and potpourris.
</P>
<P>
   The piped music is of cicadas, presumably to give visitors the
feeling of being in a lavender field.
</P>
<P>
   The cognoscenti can muse over whether to buy bags of seeds of
``Lavandin'' (the hybrid, cheaper stuff) or pure ``lavande,'' the
infinitely more expensive wild variety, which only grows above 800
meters (2,500 feet).
</P>
<P>
   The church has tapped into a burgeoning ``New Age'' perception
that herbs, monks and alternative medicine are all intertwined.
</P>
<P>
   At the Cistercian abbey of Senanque and at Ganagobie, the monks
have opened sophisticated shops, selling a huge range of lavender
items far removed in quality from English cathedral shop tat.
</P>
<P>
   As well as their own generous range of lavender soaps, oils and
creams, the abbeys promote books in several languages on monastery
herb gardens and the ancient ``secrets'' of lavender, secrets
presumably preserved over the centuries only by the clergy (which
wouldn't be surprising, as the abbeys sit in fields of the stuff).
</P>
<P>
   Five drops drunk in a glass of wine, I read in one book, can
cure ``hysterical vapors.''
</P>
<P>
   The revival of the once moribund lavender industry of Provence
is not, however, a mere side-effect of the growing attraction to
New Age mysticism and alternative medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Simiane's farmers have helped themselves too, setting up a
co-operative that dispatched the middlemen to oblivion. Out, too,
went ``romantic'' looking scythes (except for folk festivals) and
fat copper stills.
</P>
<P>
   While the tourists trundle around Simiane's pottery shop, the
village farmers sweat in the burning August heat, taking their crop
to the large and distinctly unpicturesque modern distillery that
the co-op has set up on the edge of the village.
</P>
<P>
   Mothers and sons join in with their men, stacking the
fast-browning bales into the giant vat. Clouds of steam rise
through the stalks, carrying the precious oil in pipes through a
cold water tank to rows of barrels underneath.
</P>
<P>
   The undulating lavender fields of Simiane and Oppedette may look
as if they are kept on for the benefit of the heritage industry or
for tourists, but the product is, in fact, sold direct to Proctor &AMP;
Gamble and Colgate.
</P>
<P>
   The Cooperative Agricole des Plantes a Parfum de Provence and
its 290 members have seized almost a third of the total French
lavender oil production, three times more than before the co-op was
set up 15 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Its still a hard living,'' says Claude Coutant, a 30-year-old
farmer, laughing mirthlessly at the notion that the industry's
revival has ensured farmers a comfortable life.
</P>
<P>
   Perspiration streamed from his brow as the lavender was
pitchforked into the vat amid wafts of scalding steam. ``Whatever
money we make goes back into investing in equipment.''
</P>
<P>
   Coutant's father and grandfather farmed lavender before him, and
so will he. Lavender will guarantee the survival of a way of life,
if not prosperity. &QL;

PRESIDENT'S EXPLANATION FAILS TO QUIET REPUBLICANS OR FIRE UP
DEMOCRATS
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By KEVIN SACK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A number of Republican lawmakers said on Monday
night that they were far from mollified by President Clinton's
declaration to the nation that his ``not appropriate'' relationship
with Monica Lewinsky was now between himself, his family and their
God.
</P>
<P>
   Several legislators said the televised speech did nothing to
change their feelings that impeachment should be considered if it
is merited by a report they expected to be sent to Congress by
Kenneth Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Democrats, meanwhile, offered muted responses,
with some saying that Clinton had achieved what he needed to in his
speech but others finding it difficult to muster enthusiasm for
their deeply wounded president.
</P>
<P>
   A number of Republican leaders, including House Speaker Newt
Gingrich of Georgia; Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority
leader, and Rep. Henry Hyde of Illinois, the chairman of the House
Judiciary Committee, declined to comment on Monday night, their
spokesmen said.
</P>
<P>
   Others were on vacation and unreachable, their aides said.
Republican strategists have said that before issuing public
pronouncements the party's leaders were likely to analyze Clinton's
performance carefully and the public's reaction to it.
</P>
<P>
   But among senators, there were some sharp attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, who is chairman of the Judiciary
Committee, used some of the harsher language to criticize the
president. His remarks came after several days of making
conciliatory comments that had seemed to suggest that impeachment
proceedings could be avoided if Clinton would offer a full and
contrite explanation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wasn't that pathetic?'' Hatch asked. ``I tell you, what a
jerk. That's the biggest mistake he's ever made.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was superb on rhetoric and he was totally inadequate on
facts,'' said Sen. Arlen Specter, a Pennsylvania Republican who is
on the Judiciary Committee. ``He said his testimony was totally
accurate, he didn't ask anybody to lie. But the artful words he's
used in the past leave us a great deal of leeway for serious
charges. I think it presents no plausible defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Even some of Clinton's most ardent congressional supporters said
they found the president to be a tad too defiant in a speech that
they said could have used more repentance and less forcefulness.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was more hard than I thought he would be,'' said Rep.
Charles Rangel, D-N.Y. ``I thought there would be more humility.
But he was forceful enough. I don't know really whether that works
or not. I think it works for the people who wanted to get it behind
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Dispersed to all corners of the country in the August recess,
many members of Congress viewed the president's statement just like
their constituents, with slippered feet propped up on living room
loungers. And despite seven months of Beltway immersion in the
details of the Lewinsky matter, many lawmakers reacted just like
their constituents, by shaking their heads in disbelief at the
televised spectacle they found themselves watching.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Clinton was testifying before the federal grand jury on
Monday afternoon, White House aides were calling Democratic members
of Congress to implore them to deliver statements expressing hope
that the country could now move beyond the investigation. And
shortly after Clinton's testimony ended, Erskine Bowles, the White
House chief of staff, called leading Democrats and their aides to
inform them that Clinton planned to use his statement to accept
full responsibility for his actions and to express real regret.
</P>
<P>
   But a number of Democratic congressional aides said that it
might take time for Clinton's partisans to rally to his side. ``Our
sense is that members aren't going to be quite ready to go out and
push the White House line,'' said an aide to one top Democrat.
``There's a feeling of betrayal, particularly for the members who
have been out front defending the president with some blind
faith.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats, however, gamely took up the call. ``We are all
human,'' said Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa. ``We all make mistakes _
even the president. Most Americans share my belief that it's in our
best interest to put this behind us and move on.'' Harkin also took
a swipe at Starr, calling his investigation ``a sanctioned
witchhunt into the president's personal life.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., said that Clinton ``did what was
appropriate.'' More than that, Frank said, Clinton did what was
necessary. ``He really had to apologize,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And Steve Grossman, the national chairman of the Democratic
National Committee, predicted that Clinton's four-minute speech
would have ``a galvanizing effect on grassroots Democrats'' that
would lay the foundation for victory in this November's elections.
He insisted that there was ``a huge reservoir of goodwill'' toward
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The most generous Republican comment came from Rep. Jim Leach of
Iowa, the chairman of the House Banking Committee, who said: ``I
think he did precisely what he had to do, and that doesn't mean the
presidency hasn't been damaged. But it does mean we are all
obligated to proceed with the business of governance in as
constructive a way as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a distinction between character flaws, political
embarrassments and constitutional challenges,'' Leach said. ``We
have the first two, but as yet we certainly don't have the third.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But other Republicans were almost uniformly critical. Rep. Bob
Barr of Georgia, who has trumpeted the loudest calls for
impeachment, reacted to Clinton's speech by saying, ``So what?'' He
added: ``What really matters is not the president's spin but Mr.
Starr's evidence. That's what I'm waiting to see.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ed Bryant of Tennessee, was equally caustic. ``An apology
does not exonerate anyone from criminal wrongdoing,'' he said.
``Were that the case, our prisons would be empty.''

SPORTS WORLD LOSES A LEGEND IN JIM MURRAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He wore glasses so thick the lenses looked like they could have
been lifted from the bottom of a couple of Coke bottles, the result
of a terrible eye disease that left him almost blind, but there was
never any question about Jim Murray's ability to ``see.''
</P>
<P>
   He could cut to the quick _ to the heart of a story _ like a
butcher's meat cleaver through a tenderloin steak.
</P>
<P>
   When the great columnist from the ``Los Angeles Times'' passed
away Monday, the world of sports journalism took a deep and ragged
breath. For the second time this year, we have lost one of the flag
bearers of our profession.
</P>
<P>
   As we did when Shirley Povich of the ``Washington Post''
preceded Murray a few months ago, we can only stop and pay our
respects, for today we are so much poorer than we were yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   I can't remember the first time I read a Jim Murray column, only
that it left me with tears in my eyes, I was laughing so hard.
</P>
<P>
   We would often run Murray's syndicated pieces in the
``Star-Telegram'' back in the late '60s and early '70s. He was, I
quickly learned as a young rim-man, editing copy between covering
the high school beat, the unchallenged master of the overstatement.
</P>
<P>
   Murray's columns read like the monologues of today's late-night
talk show hosts, only better. Letterman and Leno should only hope
to be so funny.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever his subject might be, Murray would make his point again
and again, with usually hilarious and rapier-sharp one-liners that
could leave a reader gasping for air.
</P>
<P>
   After I began covering the Rangers in the mid '70s, I had the
opportunity to meet Murray, but I was way too much in awe of him to
do much more than squeak out a meek hello, then or later.
</P>
<P>
   Talk to Mr. Murray? You gotta be kidding. He lived somewhere up
on sports journalism's Mount Olympus. Me, I was just a kid wannabe.
Still am. If he had merely hinted that he'd like it, I'd have
carried his typewriter all over the country.
</P>
<P>
   I can still remember the story of Murray's first interview with
Mark ``The Bird'' Fidrych.
</P>
<P>
   This must have been sometime late in Fidrych's rookie season in
1976, when he was on his way to a 19-9 season. The mop-haired,
gangly right-hander had captured the imagination of the country
with his penchant for playing in the dirt around the mound and for
giving specific verbal instructions to every pitch he threw.
</P>
<P>
   Fidrych and his idiosyncrasies eventually drew the attention of
every major columnist in the country. ``The Bird'' was a great and
colorful story on his way to being a one-season wonder. Somewhere
along the way, Murray, already a legend in his business, caught up
with the kid who wanted to be one.
</P>
<P>
   Murray waited for the media crowd around Fidrych to drift away
from his locker, then, notebook and pen in hand, sidled over.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say,'' Murray is said to have begun, peering myopically
up at Fidrych's boyish face, ``you talk to baseballs.''
</P>
<P>
   It was as good an opening line as any reporter could ever hope
to deliver.
</P>
<P>
   Murray was also a man who could walk 18 holes with Jack
Nicklaus, talk to him alone for half an hour after the round, and
never use a quote in his column.
</P>
<P>
   Didn't need 'em. Murray's lines were generally far better than
anything an athlete might have to say.
</P>
<P>
   At the World Series it is common practice for baseball beat
writers to get the choice press box seats and for columnists to be
shunted off to the ``aux box,'' which often is simply a seat in a
section of the stands with a table set up in front of it.
</P>
<P>
   Out in the weather, in other words, and late October in New
York, Cleveland, Boston, Pittsburgh, Baltimore, etc., can be more
than chilly.
</P>
<P>
   It is not unusual for the columnists to shun their outdoor seats
for a spot in the warmer working press room, where the game can be
watched on television screens and the coffee pot is always close
by.
</P>
<P>
   One of the great pleasures in life, when they were still
traveling, was to land at the same table occupied by Murray and
other titans of the business who tended to flock together. Povich,
our own Blackie Sherrod, Edwin Pope, Dave Anderson. Each legends in
their own time.
</P>
<P>
   At those fortunate times, one personal rule superseded all
others: Keep your mouth shut and your ears open. You might learn
something in the presence of greatness.
</P>
<P>
   A baseball anthology on the bookshelf in my office carries one
of Murray's stories. This was one he wrote in 1972, concerning
baseball player Babe Herman and the myth that Herman once tripled
into a triple play (actually Babe doubled into a double play, but
that doesn't make the story any less intriguing).
</P>
<P>
   Murray started it this way:
</P>
<P>
   ``History, Henry Ford said, is bunk. Or did he?
</P>
<P>
   Did George Washington really throw a dollar across the
Rappahannock?
</P>
<P>
   Was that midnight rider really Paul Revere? Or two guys from
</P>
<P>
   Springfield? Did Shakespeare really write those plays? Think
Patrick
</P>
<P>
   Henry really said ``Give me liberty or give me death''? Or did
he say,
</P>
<P>
   ``Lemme outta here, you guys are nuts!''
</P>
<P>
   It's the same in sports. Did Babe Ruth really call his shot in
the
</P>
<P>
   World Series? Did Willie Keeler really say, ``Hit 'em where they
</P>
<P>
   ain't''?
</P>
<P>
   Men usually become legends posthumously. Nothing promotes the
</P>
<P>
   growth of a legend like the demise of anyone who might
contradict
</P>
<P>
   it.''
</P>
<P>
   It was that last paragraph that caught my attention because Jim
Murray has been a legend in my business for as long as I can
remember.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't have to die to get there. He literally wrote his own
ticket.
</P>
<P>
   And I can't think of anyone who would contradict that.

<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Chris Pritchett's three-run double and RBI
single propelled the Angels to a 7-2 victory over the Chicago White
Sox Monday night before 22,174 at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   Chris who?
</P>
<P>
   Pritchett, the first baseman.
</P>
<P>
   Pritchett's big night helped the Angels increase their American
League West lead over Texas to one game. The Rangers were rained
out in Boston Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Nevin chipped in for the Angels with a two-run homer
(No.8), and starter Steve Sparks (7-2) won his fourth decision in a
row, going seven innings and allowing two runs and nine hits.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago's runs came on back-to-back homers by Frank Thomas and
Albert Belle in the fourth, Belle's homer a cause for controversy
when a fan reached above left fielder Orlando Palmeiro's glove to
steal what would have been a fly out at the short fence down the
left-field line.
</P>
<P>
   But the Angels had no reason to fret, not with Pritchett setting
a career high with four RBI. In fact, before Monday he had a total
of three RBI in his major-league career.
</P>
<P>
   Pritchett was called up from Triple-A Vancouver on Aug. 10, when
the Angels placed Darin Erstad on the disabled list. But he is not
the only strange face in the home clubhouse these days.
</P>
<P>
   Six players on the Angels' 25-man roster (24 percent) weren't
with the team the last time the Angels played at home on Aug. 5.
</P>
<P>
   Pritchett, Jack McDowell, Todd Greene, Mike Fetters, Jeff Juden
and Reggie Williams joined the club by either trade (Fetters and
Juden), promotion from the minors (Pritchett and Williams) or
activation from the disabled list (Greene and McDowell).
</P>
<P>
   It was enough to make an equipment manager's head spin, to say
nothing of the players.
</P>
<P>
   ``You kind of become callous to it,'' said shortstop Gary
DiSarcina, who leads the team by playing in 120 of the Angels' 124
games. ``You say, `All right, the new guys are here.' But you do
your best not to change anything drastically.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost like an engine. You fix the broken parts in it.
You try to make yourself mentally used to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Disrupting ``clubhouse chemistry is not an issue,'' DiSarcina
says. Not as long as the team is winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're winning, you could have 25 of the most diverse
people on the planet and everything's going to be good,'' DiSarcina
said. ``As long as you have guys with the same goals, I don't care
if you're black, white, yellow, green or an alien. When you leave
the clubhouse, everybody knows you're doing what you have to do to
help the team win.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Pritchett's turn Monday, starting with his bases-clearing
double off White Sox starter Jim Parque (3-5) with two out in the
third inning, increasing the Angels' lead from 3-0 to 6-0.
</P>
<P>
   That was plenty of support for Sparks, who pitched seven or more
innings for the fifth time in his last six starts.
</P>
<P>
   Surgery for Hollins: Dave Hollins will have season-ending
arthroscopic surgery on his right shoulder Wednesday at the
Kerlan-Jobe Health Center in Los Angeles. Dr. Lewis Yocum will
perform the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Hollins has been on the disabled list since Aug. 10 with an
inflamed shoulder. He had been bothered all season with a sore
shoulder before he aggravated it when sliding head-first on July
18.
</P>
<P>
   Hollins lost his starting job at third base after the Angels
promoted Troy Glaus from Triple-A Vancouver on July 30. Hollins had
been getting time at first base when he went to the DL.
</P>
<P>
   Hollins hit .242 with 11 homers and 39 RBI this season. He also
made a team-high 17 errors. He is under contract for next season at
$1.9 million.

A PAINFUL DAY FOR A STALWART WIFE

(JT) 
 By JILL ABRAMSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The lawyer whose guidance and support has mattered
most in the president's career _ his wife _ was not by his side
when Clinton made his televised address to the nation Monday night
or part of the legal team advising the president earlier Monday in
the White House Map Room. Still, according to several advisers,
Hillary Rodham Clinton has played a pivotal role in crafting
Clinton's public and private testimony in what has been an
extremely painful day in the history of her marriage and her
husband's presidency.
</P>
<P>
   According to one close associate of the president's, Mrs.
Clinton helped write her husband's short speech and played an
instrumental role in strategy meetings throughout the weekend.
``She has been the strength as usual,'' said the associate, who
asked not to be named. ``The incredible fact is that she helped
write the speech. How'd you like to have a wife like that?''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's central role in helping her husband to prepare
for his fateful grand jury testimony has coincided with reports
that Mrs. Clinton had only learned in recent days that her husband
was acknowledging an improper relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
Indeed, as the president and his advisers shifted their strategy
away from categorical denials of any improper relationship with Ms.
Lewinsky, some advisers stressed that one of the most difficult
tasks confronting the president was to divulge an extramarital
relationship to Mrs. Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight in his televised address, the President said, `` I
misled people, including even my wife. I deeply regret that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson, who met with Hillary and Chelsea CLinton
on Sunday, said Monday night in Chicago: ``The strength of Hillary
is just amazing. Hillary brings to this unconditional love for her
husband. She knows his strengths, his weaknesses and she is his
partner. He feels the embarrassment and shame of it all.''
</P>
<P>
   Of all the speculation that has washed over the capital in
recent days, one question has provoked more conversation than
others: What did the first lady know about her husband's
relationship with the former White House intern, Monica Lewinsky,
and when did she know it?
</P>
<P>
   Several friends of Mrs. Clinton said they found it almost
impossible to believe that she was in the dark about her husband's
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``That strikes me as ridiculous,'' said one friend who has seen
Mrs. Clinton this month. Another said, ``Come on. She's the
smartest lawyer in town and the president has relied on her from
the beginning.'' Both friends, who spoke on the condition that they
not be named, said they had never asked Mrs. Clinton about Ms.
Lewinsky or had heard her speak about the 25-year-old woman.
</P>
<P>
   A close friend of Clinton said he is ``almost certain'' that
Mrs. Clinton knew back in January that the president had a sexual
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. This friend, who also spoke on the
condition of anonymity, speculated that recent leaks to the media
that portrayed Mrs. Clinton as unknowing until now were released to
raise her approval ratings in the public opinion polls. This friend
cited an internal White House polling showing that her ratings have
skyrocketed in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   Marsha Berry, a spokeswoman for Mrs. Clinton, said Monday: ``In
general, she hasn't talked about this with us. I can't offer any
evidence of what she knew or when. It's not something we talk
about.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Mrs. Clinton will depart with the president and her
daughter for a 10-day family vacation in Martha's Vineyard. Then,
in early September, the president will accompany Mrs. Clinton on a
trip to Ireland, where the first lady is scheduled to participate
in a conference on women in emerging democracies. Then, the first
couple will travel to Russia. On all of these travels, every glance
and gesture between and Mrs. Clinton will be subject to intense,
and for Mrs. Clinton excruciating, scrutiny by the news media.
According to one friend, Mrs. Clinton is furious over the media's
dissection of her marriage and the invasion of her privacy by both
the press and prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Clinton echoed his wife's feelings about the need
for privacy. ``I intend to reclaim my family life for my family,''
he said. ``It's nobody's business but ours.''
</P>
<P>
   Last January, after the investigation into Clinton's
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky and allegations of perjury became
public, Mrs. Clinton appeared on the NBC News ``Today'' show to
defend her husband. When pressed by her interviewer, Matt Lauer,
with a direct hypothetical question on whether the American people
should seek the resignation of a president who had an adulterous
affair in the White House and then lied to cover it up, Mrs.
Clinton responded: ``If all that were proven true, I think that
would be a very serious offense. That is not going to be proven
true.''
</P>
<P>
   One former White House aide cited this interview as evidence
that Mrs. Clinton did believe there was no improper relationship
between her husband and Ms. Lewinsky. The aide added, ``Those who
now say that the first lady knew all along and has been leading the
strategy have to contend with the fact that she then has to accept
responsibility for misleading the public.''
</P>
<P>
   Plumbing the mysteries of a marriage, especially the Clintons',
is a hazardous endeavor. In 1992, Clinton conceded he had ``caused
pain'' in his marriage. And Mrs. Clinton told Lauer: ``We've been
married for 22 years. And I have learned a long time ago that the
only two people who count in any marriage are the two who are in
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the depth of her knowledge about her husband's
encounters with Ms. Lewinsky, it is clear that the past few days
have been difficult for the Clintons. Late on Sunday night,
Jackson, who has become particularly close to Chelsea Clinton in
recent months, was summoned to the White House. He said he talked
and prayed with Mrs. Clinton and her daughter for two hours,
beginning at 10:30 p.m. The three of them then briefly met with the
president.

COWBOYS' OFFENSE CONTINUES TO GO SOUTH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Let's hope the Dallas Cowboys did some
sightseeing.
</P>
<P>
   They offered few visible signs of accomplishing anything
concrete in their trip across the border for Monday night's 21-3
American Bowl loss to the New England Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   Unless you count comic relief.
</P>
<P>
   Watching Cowboys receiver Jimmy Oliver slip and fall on the
Azteca Stadium turf while returning a kickoff brought a roar from
the 106,424 fans, the second-largest crowd to watch an NFL game.
</P>
<P>
   However, when the largely pro-Cowboys crowd didn't have a reason
to laugh, they resorted to jeering the Cowboys' numerous dropped
passes, several interference penalties, two muffed punts and some
botched snaps. Such a performance probably made Cowboys fans glad
to watch something else when ABC pre-empted coverage to show
President Clinton's address to the nation, switching coverage to
ESPN2 at 9 p.m. ABC Sports spokesman Mark Mandel said it was the
first time a ``Monday Night Football'' telecast has been moved to
another network.
</P>
<P>
   With injured running backs Emmitt Smith and Chris Warren on the
sideline for precautionary reasons, the Cowboys' offense offered a
second consecutive poor performance and showed no signs of adapting
to first-year coach Chan Gailey's offense.
</P>
<P>
   And the defense continued its pass-rush woes, minus defensive
end Kavika Pittman, cornerback Deion Sanders and defensive tackle
Leon Lett, who were in Dallas nursing injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hurts,'' Gailey said after the Cowboys fell to 0-3 in
preseason games. ``It's no fun to lose. I don't care if it doesn't
count.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey, who didn't use the absence of the injured stars as an
excuse, was left frustrated, especially with the offense. Rookie
seventh-round pick Tarik Smith started at tailback.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed in the first team's inability to sustain a
drive,'' Gailey said. ``Basically, it's inconsistency. We'll do a
couple of things good then shoot ourselves in the foot. We're also
not making big plays; we have to make big plays on offense.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys quarterback Troy Aikman and the first-team offense
played the first three series of the game, totaling 46 yards and
two first downs. They managed no first downs and minus-6 total
yards in their previous outing against the Raiders, a 16-3 loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made too many mistakes offensively to be able to generate
any kind of consistency,'' Aikman said of Monday night's game.
``It's disappointing because we wanted to move the ball better, and
we just made too many mistakes to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys next play the Rams in St. Louis on Saturday night.
And Gailey said he will take a longer look at the starters, which
have played only a quarter in each of the first three games.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots (1-2) came into Monday night's game hoping for a
solid performance after being shut out, 28-0, in their most recent
outing against Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   The importance the Patriots put on the game was evident from the
outset. New England coach Pete Carroll played his starters,
including quarterback Drew Bledsoe, the entire first half.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys fell behind 21-0 in the second quarter before
salvaging a field goal to close the first half that included three
Patriots touchdowns that were nullified by penalties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Drew was sharp, and I thought the running game did
pretty good,'' Carroll said. ``Sedrick Shaw did a good job around
the goal line.''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe, rarely pressured by the Cowboys' defense, completed 9
of 14 passes for 69 yards and directed two touchdown drives.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots' first score came after a Gailey gamble on
fourth-and-one failed on the Cowboys' 39-yard line. Fullback Daryl
Johnston was stopped for no gain and Patriots took quick advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw capped the drive with a 9-yard run.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe engineered a 63-yard touchdown drive in the second
quarter, featuring two pass interference penalties against the
Cowboys. Shaw scored from 1 yard out.
</P>
<P>
   New England cornerback Ty Law took put the final points on the
scoreboard for the Patriots when he returned a pass from Cowboys
quarterback Jason Garrett 26 yards for a touchdown late in the
second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' Richie Cunningham kicked a 40-yard field goal to
close out the first half.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The look on David Dellucci's face said it all. Relief. It had
been a long time since he had made a significant contribution for
the Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the arrival of Bernard Gilkey in a July 31 trade with
the New York Mets, Dellucci lost his spot in left field. When he
did play, he struggled at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   But on Monday night against Montreal, Dellucci stepped in to
play center field while veteran Devon White nursed a tight
hamstring and came up with the big hit of the game for Arizona, a
bases-loaded triple in the fourth inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks went on to record a 6-1 victory as right-hander
Andy Benes won his fourth straight to even his record at 11-11.
</P>
<P>
   The victory was Arizona's second in a row and put its record at
47-77. The Expos, making their first visit to Bank One Ballpark
after winning five of six against the Diamondbacks at Olympic
Stadium, lost their seventh in a row and fell to 49-76, just 1{
games ahead of the Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   With one out and Travis Lee and Matt Williams on base after
being walked by right-hander Jeremy Powell (1-3) and Jay Bell
aboard as the result of a swinging bunt single, Dellucci hit a ball
over the head of center fielder F.P. Santangelo to the base of the
wall, 407 feet away. All three runners scored easily as Dellucci
cruised into third. After a 1-for-15 slide, it was just what the
doctor ordered.
</P>
<P>
   ``David hasn't played a lot lately, but he's been working
hard,'' Diamondbacks Manager Buck Showalter said ``It was good to
see him come through tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Players don't always have to agree with these types of
decisions, but I think David understands the need to evaluate other
players than just him. He'll get his chances along the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Benes was in control most of the night. He had a difficult act
to follow, after left-hander Omar Daal stifled the New York Mets on
two hits through eight innings in a 6-1 victory on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Omar throwing as well as he is, I needed to come up with
a good performance to keep things going,'' Benes said. ``I made
good pitches when I needed to.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you go out and put up some zeroes on the board, that
makes your own hitters relax when they go up to the plate and it's
easier for them to hit the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Second baseman Tony Batista gave Benes and the Diamondbacks a
1-0 lead with one out in the first inning when he hit a homer to
left field, his 11th of the season. He now has six homers and 10
RBIs in his last 12 games.
</P>
<P>
   The Expos tied it at 1 against Benes in the fourth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Right fielder Vladimir Guerrero, one of baseball's rising young
stars, hit a one-out double and scored on Chris Widger's two-out
single to right-center.
</P>
<P>
   After their big fourth inning, the Diamondbacks picked up an
insurance run in the fifth against right-handed reliever Anthony
Telford and could have had more.
</P>
<P>
   Batista doubled to right-center with one out and scored on Matt
Williams' two-out line-drive single to left-center that barely
eluded the grasp of leaping shortstop Orlando Cabrera.
</P>
<P>
   Telford walked Karim Garcia and Bell to load the bases before
Dellucci grounded to second for the final out.
</P>
<P>
   Benes, meanwhile, retired nine in a row before leaving after the
eighth. Left-hander Alan Embree set down the side in order in the
ninth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually thought Andy's last three innings were his
strongest of the game,'' Showalter said. ``He's a strong
second-half pitcher. Hopefully, we'll be able to keep him
healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Benes threw 113 pitches, and his fastball was clocked at 91 mph
when the pitch count reached 111. &QL;

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Mexico's team, the New England Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   Though they were booed before the game by the second-largest
crowd in NFL history _ 106,424 _ the Patriots eventually won over
the fans in Azteca Stadium and defeated the Dallas Cowboys, 21-3,
in an exhibition contest Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The first-team offense, which staggered for the first two games
of the exhibition season, showed progress, putting up two
touchdowns and moving the ball.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots, who did all their scoring in the first half,
accomplished the following:
</P>
<P>
   1. Drew Bledsoe, though he twice missed a wide-open Terry Glenn
for what could have been touchdowns, had a better rhythm in the new
passing game, completing 9 of 14 for 69 yards in just under a half.
</P>
<P>
   2. Sedrick Shaw gained 50 yards on 14 carries (a 3.6-yard
average) in his best performance of the preseason.
</P>
<P>
   3. The offensive line showed signs of being able to run-block,
as Todd Rucci and Zefross Moss moved bodies on the right side and
created opportunities for Shaw.
</P>
<P>
   4. The defense continued to be outstanding, as the first unit
allowed only 118 yards in the first half and Ty Law returned an
interception 26 yards for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was, by far, our best game of the preseason,''
said Patriots coach Pete Carroll. ``I thought Sedrick did a nice
job around the goal line and getting into the end zone. Drew was
also sharp, though he just missed a long one.''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe said, ``That was more along the lines of what we would
like to be. We threw the ball, we ran the ball, and we were able to
connect on third downs. There was a play that we missed to Terry _
it felt great when it left my hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was good to see Terry playing so well. He's really into it
now. I guess I'll blame that one on the altitude because it really
got away from me.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bledsoe was upset about penalties, three of which nullified
apparent scores. ``Whether they were bad calls or great calls, I
don't know,'' he said. ``But we can't have touchdowns called back
because of penalties.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots' domination of the Cowboys, who played their No. 1
units on offense (minus Emmitt Smith and Chris Warren) and defense
(minus Deion Sanders) for a little more than a quarter, was even
greater than the score indicated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a wild first half,'' said Carroll. ``We have to feel
good about getting in the end zone, but we have to clean up our
game to take advantage of some of the big plays. Without the
penalties, I thought we played a heck of a half.''
</P>
<P>
   Not often in recent times has a good defensive stand provided
momentum for the offense, but that changed Monday night. On fourth
and inches from the Dallas 39 with 3:31 left in the first quarter,
defensive linemen Chad Eaton, Mark Wheeler, and Willie McGinest
stopped fullback Moose Johnston dead in his tracks.
</P>
<P>
   The offense didn't fumble the chance. It took only six plays to
score. Shaw gained 15 of the 39 yards, including the last 9 on a
touchdown run around left end after being sprung loose by a nice
block from rookie tight end Rod Rutledge.
</P>
<P>
   Also on the series, Bledsoe completed a 9-yard pass to Lovett
Purnell and Shawn Jefferson made a nifty sideline grab, taking
advantage of defender Kevin Mathis falling down.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was great to see that because it provides us with a comfort
zone that we can make plays and the offense will put points on the
board,'' said Law.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the second quarter, Bledsoe executed a a superb screen
pass, drawing in the defense and dumping off to Derrick Cullors,
who ran 52 yards down the left sideline. But Ben Coates was caught
holding safety George Teague, nullifying the touchdown, and the
Patriots had to punt.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the quarter, Troy Brown fielded a Toby Gowin punt on
the 30 and ran it back all the way for the score, sprung loose by a
classic takeout block from Tony Carter on Bobby Rodriguez. But the
return will live only on the highlight film _ not the scoreboard _
because Larry Whigham was flagged for holding Izell Reese.
</P>
<P>
   There was a happy ending on this sequence, however. After
Bledsoe threw a knuckleball over the middle that Brown couldn't
handle, he lofted a soft pass into the corner of the end zone to
Jefferson. The pass was incomplete but Jefferson was held by Lee
Vaughn, so the ball was placed on the 1. Shaw went over for the
second score, making it 14-0.
</P>
<P>
   That touchdown came after a 4-yard run by Shaw into the end zone
was called back on a Coates holding penalty.
</P>
<P>
   With 1:08 left in the half, Law intercepted a Jason Garrett pass
intended for tight end Eric Bjornson and scampered 26 yards to
paydirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just sitting on the route and Jason was looking right at
me but he still threw it,'' said Law. ``I was ready for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Eaton was immense in the middle of the line, while McGinest put
constant pressure on the quarterback and Ferric Collons was tough
against the run.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas didn't get into New England territory until there were
only 13 seconds left in the half. With the clock ticking down,
Carroll decided to take advantage of the experimental instant
replay rule. He questioned whether wide receiver Billy Davis had
both feet inbounds on a sideline pass that got the ball to the
Patriots' 23. The replay showed that he did, and Richie Cunningham
came on to kick a 40-yard field goal as time expired.

   Jim Murray, whose humorous, vinegary and humane columns for The
Los Angeles Times made him one of only four sportswriters to win
the Pulitzer Prize for general commentary, died Sunday of cardiac
arrest at his home in Los Angeles, the newspaper reported. He was
78.
</P>
<P>
   Murray filed his last dispatch on Saturday from the Del Mar race
track, a column about a victory by the thoroughbred Free House, who
barely fell short in all three Triple Crown races last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bridesmaid finally caught the bouquet,'' he wrote. ``The
`best friend' got the girl in the Warner Bros. movie for a change.
The sidekick saves the fort. Free House just won't fold the hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite eye problems and heart surgery in past years. Murray was
still writing his column regularly, puncturing a subject's
pomposity or skewering cities. ``Detroit,'' he once wrote, ``should
be left on the doorstep of the Salvation Army.''
</P>
<P>
   The sportswriter Frank Deford said: ``He could be brutal. But
there was so much humor, people didn't get mad about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, some did. Indianapolis 500 officials were not amused that
he dubbed the race ``America's Earache'' and suggested they start
the annual car race by saying, ``Gentlemen, start your coffins.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray joined The Los Angeles Times in 1961, after stints with
The New Haven Register in Connecticut, The Los Angeles
Herald-Examiner, Time and Life magazines as their Hollywood
correspondent, and Sports Illustrated, which he helped found in
1953.
</P>
<P>
   The Times hired him as a sports columnist, and he won numerous
awards for his writing, but in a business known for bravado and
hyperbole, Murray was revered for his modesty.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no bluster in the guy,'' said Bill Dwyre, the sports
editor of The Times. ``I have agate clerks with more ego than he
did.''
</P>
<P>
   When he won the Pulitzer in 1990, Murray said he thought a
winner had ``to bring down a government or expose major graft or
give advice to prime ministers.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``Correctly quoting Tommy Lasorda shouldn't merit a
Pulitzer Prize.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray joined Arthur Daley, Red Smith and Dave Anderson, all of
The New York Times, as the only sportswriters to win Pulitzers for
commentary.
</P>
<P>
   Deford recalled an award ceremony several years ago in Los
Angeles. ``Ronald Reagan came,'' he said. ``He did a 10-minute
standup. Not for many sportswriters would an ex-president show up
to pay tribute.''
</P>
<P>
   In his autobiography, Murray described his vivid approach to
writing. ``People need to be amused, shocked, titillated or
angered,'' he wrote. ``But if you can amuse or shock or make them
indignant enough, you can slip lots of information into your
message.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, a detached retina in his left eye left him nearly
blind; his right eye had a cataract. ``I lost an old friend the
other day,'' Murray wrote after failed surgery. ``He was blue-eyed,
impish, he cried a lot with me, saw a great many things with me. I
don't know why he left me. Boredom perhaps.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued to cover sports for The Times with a companion to
describe what he could no longer see. But surgery in early 1982
restored some sight to his right eye, allowing him to observe
sports unaided.
</P>
<P>
   Later that year, Ricky, 29, the youngest of his three sons with
his first wife, Geraldine, died of a drug overdose. In 1984, Mrs.
Murray died of cancer. ``I don't mean to inflict my grief on you,
but she deserves to be known by anyone who knows me,'' Murray wrote
after her death. ``She has a right to this space more than any
athlete who ever lived.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray is survived by his second wife, Linda McCoy; three
children, Pam Skeoch, Ted and Tony; two granddaughters and a
stepson.

END IS NEAR IN McIVER-IRVIN INCIDENT 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. AND KEVIN LYONS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Everett McIver-Michael Irvin saga appears to be over.
</P>
<P>
   League officials said Monday it had concluded its nearly
weeklong inquiry into the July 29 incident, which left McIver with
a 2-inch cut on his neck. The league found no evidence with which
to take discplinary action.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys had said the incident stemmed from ``horseplay.''
Sources with knowledge of the incident have told the
``Star-Telegram'' Irvin inflicted the wound with a scissors.
</P>
<P>
   The league's investigation also refuted a published report that
team owner Jerry Jones had brokered a payment between Irvin and
McIver for McIver's silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked into the reports of a payoff and found no evidence
of any deal,'' league spokesman Greg Aiello said.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Jones said Monday's events should provide proper
closure.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the standpoint of the organization, this matter has been
resolved for some time,'' Jones said. ``Today's statements from
Everett McIver and the NFL office should provide proper closure for
everyone as far as the matter is concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   League security representative Ben Nix conducted the inquiry by
talking with Irvin, McIver and Jones, Aiello said. Nix also talked
to several other members of the Cowboys who were thought to have
witnessed the incident, Aiello said. But the league would not
release the names of those questioned. COUNTDOWN TO KICKOFF: 19
DAYS
</P>
<P>
   Although soccer is the country's most popular sport, Monday
night's preseason game between the New England Patriots and the
Cowboys was not foreign to the fans of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Football has been played in the country since the late 1800s,
when American oil workers, Christian clubs and other groups from
the United States played games against one another.
</P>
<P>
   Organized college football began in Mexico during the 1920s, and
it is estimated that more than 2.5 million Mexican youth, between
the ages of 5-14, play football today. For teens and adults, there
are 24 football associates, consisting of 150,000 players on 4,200
teams.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, NFL International launched a pilot NFL flag
football program, ``NFL Tochito,'' in 30 private elementary and
middle schools throughout Mexico City. Nearly 3,000 boys and girls
participated in the pilot program this summer.
</P>
<P>
   NFL International expects to reach nearly 30,000 youngsters when
it launches a national flag football program throughout Mexico in
September. The NFL also is introducing flag football programs in
Canada and Japan. MILLS' DROUGHT ENDS
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys receiver Ernie Mills can catch the ball after all.
</P>
<P>
   Mills, who is battling Billy Davis for the No. 2 receiver spot,
started the first two preseason games and did not catch a pass.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, the Cowboys started Davis in front of Mills for
the first time and Mills answered the challenge with two
receptions.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, however, had the team's biggest play of the first half,
making a 23-yard reception to set up the Cowboys' lone score of the
game, a 41-yard field goal by Richie Cunningham. REPLAY, REPLAY
</P>
<P>
   Monday night's game was one of 10 this summer that the league
used as an experiment for instant replay.
</P>
<P>
   And instant replay came into play on the second-to-last play of
the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Patriots coach Pete Carroll used one of his two challenges to
question an official's call, ruling that Cowboys wide receiver
Billy Davis got two feet inbounds on a 23-yard pass from
quarterback Jason Garrett.
</P>
<P>
   Game officials watched on-field replays of the play on video
after Carroll's challenge, and found Davis, indeed, did get two
feet inbounds.
</P>
<P>
   At the league owners' meetings in March, the league did not have
enough votes to implement instant replay for the regular season. TV
OR NOT TV
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's speech to the American people regarding his
relationship with White House intern Monica Lewinsky had an
indirect effect on the fans' mood during the game.
</P>
<P>
   ABC, which was doing the game, pre-empted its broadcast to bring
viewers President Clinton's address to the nation. While ABC had
its cameras trained on Clinton, ABC's sister station, ESPN2,
carried the game.
</P>
<P>
   Of course ABC had several commitments it had to keep to
advertisers whose commercials were not aired on ABC during
Clinton's address. To do that, the league agreed to several
fourth-quarter game-stoppages for television timeouts.
</P>
<P>
   During those timeouts, when players from both sides stood around
waiting for an official's signal to begin play, the fans whistled
and generally made as much noise as possible. The slowdown in play
added to the festive mood for many of the 106,424 in attendance.
MERRY MARTOS
</P>
<P>
   Mexican player Marco Martos, who the Cowboys signed to go along
with the league's publicity stunt for this American Bowl game, was
one of the few Cowboys who got a standing ovation. Martos got a
rousing cheer when he was the last Cowboys player introduced before
the game. And Martos caught two passes to end the game, drawing
another rousing ovation. His 15 minutes of fame likely will end
soon when the Cowboys put him on the waiver list. BRIEFLY
</P>
<P>
   _ Running backs Chris Warren (groin strain) and Emmitt Smith
(thigh bruise) were held out of Monday night's game for
precautionary reasons. Rookie Tarik Smith started at tailback.
</P>
<P>
   _ Defensive tackle Leon Lett (sprained knee), cornerback Deion
Sanders (fractured rib), defensive Kavika Pittman (sprained ankle)
and deep snapper Dale Hellestrae (death in family) did not travel
with the team to Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   _ Defensive tackle Antonio Anderson started in place of Lett,
Herman Smith replaced Pittman, Kevin Mathis subbed for Sanders,
rookie free agent Denny Fortney handled the deep snapping on punts
and Steve Scifres snapped on field goals.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ A cartoon published Monday on the front page of the
newspaper Le Monde shows a dazed-looking pair, Bill Clinton and
Boris Yeltsin, stripped of almost everything but their underwear.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened to you?'' Clinton asks. ``An intern?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No!'' Yeltsin replies. ``A devaluation.''
</P>
<P>
   The imagined scene of the American and Russian leaders facing
their respective moments of truth captured a widespread
international image of Clinton as a devalued leader.
</P>
<P>
   While they repeatedly deny it in official statements supporting
their fellow incumbent in Washington, foreign leaders are puzzled
and even resentful, officials say privately, about a chain of
events that has put Clinton on the defensive, crippled White House
initiative and deprived the West of attentive, sustained U.S.
leadership in a series of international crises.
</P>
<P>
   Their conflicting impulses _ the reflex of standing by the
democracies' leader and disappointment over Clinton's inability to
deliver internationally _ have been only partially mirrored in
media reaction.
</P>
<P>
   Since last weekend, foreign publications and television stations
have bored in on the dramatic moment when Clinton would become a
sitting president under interrogation, an unthinkable eventuality
in almost any other country.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, Europeans admit bafflement as they contemplate the
world's most powerful nation finding itself in near political
paralysis because of sexual antics involving a middle-aged leader
and a young, provocative woman of legal age.
</P>
<P>
   The theme of bedroom farce continued Monday when Elle, the
French women's magazine, published a full-page cut-out Monica
Lewinsky doll whose wardrobe includes Teflon jeans _ recommended
wear, the magazine said, around the president instead of a dress
that stains easily.
</P>
<P>
   But a new mood among Europeans, a slightly aggrieved sense that
Clinton's woes have started dragging them down in his wake,
surfaced in a sharp sound bite from the former French Minister of
Culture, Jack Lang.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American president's sex organ seems to have become the
center of the universe,'' he complained Monday on French radio.
</P>
<P>
   Most commentators seemed to believe that the saga will culminate
with Clinton's eluding any evidence of perjury and thus staying in
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can hear the slow tearing now'' as Clinton undoes Velcro
tapes meant to catch him, Andrew Sullivan wrote in London's Sunday
Times.
</P>
<P>
   But there has been a chorus of dire warnings about how the White
House could rebound dangerously. The French press revived its
warnings, which emerged during the confrontation with Iraq last
year, that Clinton might be tempted to engage in risky U.S.
muscle-flexing.
</P>
<P>
   The theme was echoed in British and German media, with the
suggested possible adversaries ranging from Fidel Castro's Cuba to
drug lords in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, diplomats and government officials in Europe said
that their leaders blamed Clinton for just the opposite: Creating
vulnerabilities that exposed the presidency to his domestic
political enemies and crippled U.S. ability to provided attentive,
sustained leadership in foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   In worrying aloud, these officials pointed out that their
complaints underscored their own governments' feeling of dependence
on U.S. leadership.
</P>
<P>
   But as a German official said, ``The president likes reminding
everybody that the United States is the indispensable nation, so
what do we do when that country is there too late or isn't there at
all?''
</P>
<P>
   None of these concerns, which underscores European leaders' need
for Washington's help, have been aired publicly. Instead, the media
concentrate on dangerous fallout from the Clinton saga such as the
risk of a rising tide of press snooping into politicians' private
lives _ a concern firmly espoused by most European leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The conservative Sunday Telegraph of Britain, highlighting the
danger of a rising sleaze factor in Western democracies, carried an
article by John O'Sullivan predicting that ``even if Clinton
survives, he will be remembered as a dirty joke.''
</P>
<P>
   But The Independent seemed to reflect a broader view, obviously
espoused by the Blair government, that Clinton's ``troubles are our
concern and it is right for America's allies to help him keep
dignity if he is to remain responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   For such self-proclaimed U.S. enemies as Iraq, the Clinton
combination of weakness at home and aggressiveness abroad has been
staple fare. But outside Europe, most countries seem too immersed
in local problems to follow the U.S. presidential tribulations.
</P>
<P>
   Even in India, currently at odds with Washington, coverage has
been largely factual. But an Indian editor cited as a revealing
clue to discussion among elites a comment by a businesswoman: ``We
know America is a dying society.''
</P>
<P>
   Tokyo and other Asian capitals have had little to say in recent
days about the drama in Washington as they concentrate on their own
economic urgencies and domestic political complications.
</P>
<P>
   Significantly for Asia, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin has
managed to keep some distance between the White House and himself,
enabling him to operate apparently undamaged as the czar of U.S.
policy in economics _ the aspect of U.S. power of greatest direct
interest in most Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
   The same tactics have not worked for Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, according to diplomats and European officials.
</P>
<P>
   Even if she has often operated well on her own, these sources
said, her credibility depends too much on presidential clout for
her to succeed long with a White House largely absorbed by domestic
concerns and a constant need to be planning legal defense
strategies.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, ``We don't want a lame duck president,'' The
Independent newspaper of Britain said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The implication of that editorial was that Clinton may have
already lost the degree of presidential authority necessary in an
era when the United States is expected to operate as the sole
superpower. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 950; UNCUT VERSION RUNS 1,075 WORDS.) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   Even in crises in which Washington forces showdowns, as it did
with Iraq last year, these sources noted, often the White House has
backed away later, as it currently seems to be doing with Saddam
Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   In places as different as Iraq, Kosovo, India and Israel, the
Clinton administration's reactions have often seemed to deliver too
little too late, according to U.S. diplomats and foreign officials
in European capitals.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the White House's reluctance to confront the
Pentagon helps to explain why Washington shunned intervening in
eastern Zaire last year and in effect let rule in the county pass
to Laurent Kabila. &QL;

 c.1998 International Herald Tribune  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ A cartoon published Monday on the front page of the
newspaper Le Monde shows a dazed-looking pair, Bill Clinton and
Boris Yeltsin, stripped of almost everything but their underwear.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened to you?'' Clinton asks. ``An intern?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No!'' Yeltsin replies. ``A devaluation.''
</P>
<P>
   The imagined scene of the American and Russian leaders facing
their respective moments of truth captured a widespread
international image of Clinton as a devalued leader.
</P>
<P>
   While they repeatedly deny it in official statements supporting
their fellow incumbent in Washington, foreign leaders are puzzled
and even resentful, officials say privately, about a chain of
events that has put Clinton on the defensive, crippled White House
initiative and deprived the West of attentive, sustained U.S.
leadership in a series of international crises.
</P>
<P>
   Their conflicting impulses _ the reflex of standing by the
democracies' leader and disappointment over Clinton's inability to
deliver internationally _ have been only partially mirrored in
media reaction.
</P>
<P>
   Since last weekend, foreign publications and television stations
have bored in on the dramatic moment when Clinton would become a
sitting president under interrogation, an unthinkable eventuality
in almost any other country.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, Europeans admit bafflement as they contemplate the
world's most powerful nation finding itself in near political
paralysis because of sexual antics involving a middle-aged leader
and a young, provocative woman of legal age.
</P>
<P>
   The theme of bedroom farce continued Monday when Elle, the
French women's magazine, published a full-page cut-out Monica
Lewinsky doll whose wardrobe includes Teflon jeans _ recommended
wear, the magazine said, around the president instead of a dress
that stains easily.
</P>
<P>
   But a new mood among Europeans, a slightly aggrieved sense that
Clinton's woes have started dragging them down in his wake,
surfaced in a sharp sound bite from the former French Minister of
Culture, Jack Lang.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American president's sex organ seems to have become the
center of the universe,'' he complained Monday on French radio.
</P>
<P>
   Most commentators seemed to believe that the saga will culminate
with Clinton's eluding any evidence of perjury and thus staying in
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can hear the slow tearing now'' as Clinton undoes Velcro
tapes meant to catch him, Andrew Sullivan wrote in London's Sunday
Times.
</P>
<P>
   But there has been a chorus of dire warnings about how the White
House could rebound dangerously. The French press revived its
warnings, which emerged during the confrontation with Iraq last
year, that Clinton might be tempted to engage in risky U.S.
muscle-flexing.
</P>
<P>
   The theme was echoed in British and German media, with the
suggested possible adversaries ranging from Fidel Castro's Cuba to
drug lords in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, diplomats and government officials in Europe said
that their leaders blamed Clinton for just the opposite: Creating
vulnerabilities that exposed the presidency to his domestic
political enemies and crippled U.S. ability to provided attentive,
sustained leadership in foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   In worrying aloud, these officials pointed out that their
complaints underscored their own governments' feeling of dependence
on U.S. leadership.
</P>
<P>
   But as a German official said, ``The president likes reminding
everybody that the United States is the indispensable nation, so
what do we do when that country is there too late or isn't there at
all?''
</P>
<P>
   None of these concerns, which underscores European leaders' need
for Washington's help, have been aired publicly. Instead, the media
concentrate on dangerous fallout from the Clinton saga such as the
risk of a rising tide of press snooping into politicians' private
lives _ a concern firmly espoused by most European leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The conservative Sunday Telegraph of Britain, highlighting the
danger of a rising sleaze factor in Western democracies, carried an
article by John O'Sullivan predicting that ``even if Clinton
survives, he will be remembered as a dirty joke.''
</P>
<P>
   But The Independent seemed to reflect a broader view, obviously
espoused by the Blair government, that Clinton's ``troubles are our
concern and it is right for America's allies to help him keep
dignity if he is to remain responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   For such self-proclaimed U.S. enemies as Iraq, the Clinton
combination of weakness at home and aggressiveness abroad has been
staple fare. But outside Europe, most countries seem too immersed
in local problems to follow the U.S. presidential tribulations.
</P>
<P>
   Even in India, currently at odds with Washington, coverage has
been largely factual. But an Indian editor cited as a revealing
clue to discussion among elites a comment by a businesswoman: ``We
know America is a dying society.''
</P>
<P>
   Tokyo and other Asian capitals have had little to say in recent
days about the drama in Washington as they concentrate on their own
economic urgencies and domestic political complications.
</P>
<P>
   Significantly for Asia, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin has
managed to keep some distance between the White House and himself,
enabling him to operate apparently undamaged as the czar of U.S.
policy in economics _ the aspect of U.S. power of greatest direct
interest in most Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
   The same tactics have not worked for Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, according to diplomats and European officials.
</P>
<P>
   Even if she has often operated well on her own, these sources
said, her credibility depends too much on presidential clout for
her to succeed long with a White House largely absorbed by domestic
concerns and a constant need to be planning legal defense
strategies.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, ``We don't want a lame duck president,'' The
Independent newspaper of Britain said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The implication of that editorial was that Clinton may have
already lost the degree of presidential authority necessary in an
era when the United States is expected to operate as the sole
superpower. &QL;

COWBOYS OFFENSIVE LINE STUMBLES, AGAIN (For use by NYTimes News
Service clients) 
By KEVIN LYONS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ The offensive line was supposed to be the one
thing the Dallas Cowboys could count on this year. But for the
second consecutive preseason game, the line nearly had Troy Aikman
counted out.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman was hit on five of his seven pass attempts Monday night
in the Cowboys' 21-3 loss to the New England Patriots. That none of
the wallops resulted in a sack is more a testament to Aikman's
quick release, which let him dump the ball off to his running backs
before he hit the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Avoiding sacks was the only thing that went right on offense.
For the second consecutive game, the Cowboys' offensive attack was
just short of pedestrian. The first team gained 46 yards on 13
plays.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys coach Chan Gailey has raved all summer about how his
offensive line has improved; Nate Newton's waist, Clay Shiver's new
strength, and the additions of Everett McIver and Flozell Adams
gave Gailey confidence that he could move the ball this year
against clubs like the Washington Redskins, who feature Dana
Stubblefield and Dan Wilkinson, and the Arizona Cardinals, who
feature Eric Swann.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday night, the middle of the Cowboys' line had trouble
keeping up with a journeyman backup. Patriots tackle Chad Eaton
harassed Aikman all night, slamming Aikman to the Azteca Stadium
surface particularly hard on one play. McIver and Shiver appeared
to be responsible for turning Eaton loose on his romps through the
Cowboys' backfield. But Cowboys coaches will not know for sure what
went wrong until they review film of Monday night's loss, which was
the second consecutive game that the first-team offensive line
could not lead the Cowboys to a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys coaches said the blitzes and stunts used by the Raiders
last week were too much for a Cowboys line that was employing
vanilla blocking schemes.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Patriots did not use much gadgetry Monday night. It was
man vs. man. And no where did that come into play more than when
the Cowboys tried to go for it on fourth-and-one. Fullback Daryl
Johnston was stuffed at the line by linebacker Willie McGinest.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston's failure to gain a foot highlighted the sluggish
running game. Yes, Emmitt Smith (thigh) and Chris Warren (groin)
sat out while nursing injuries. But it's not as if there were a
whole lot of holes for third-string tailback Tarik Smith, who
gained 12 yards on five carries with the first-team offensive line.
</P>
<P>
   So after three preseason games and two scrimmages, the Cowboys
on offense do not look much different from the unit that ranked
20th in total yards last season. And with two games to go before
the season opener against the Cardinals, one wonders how much
improvement they can make.

MEDIA BLAMED FOR ATHLETES' ANTICS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID A. MARKIEWICZ 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last fall, when ESPN invited a panel of athletes, coaches and
sports officials to discuss the reasons for a decline in
sportsmanship, the network opened itself up to more than a little
finger pointing.
</P>
<P>
   The taunting, the spitting, the brawling?
</P>
<P>
   Panelists and viewers of the program seemed to agree: The media
made them do it.
</P>
<P>
   Or, at the very least, the media were responsible for
perpetuating bad sportsmanship by showing taped highlights or
photos of misbehavior ranging from biting boxers to chest-thumping
football players.
</P>
<P>
   Such coverage, the panelists and viewers suggested, prompted
further transgressions and was bound to be imitated by the youth of
America.
</P>
<P>
   ``The highlights every night are the outrageous and the
unsportsmanlike,'' said Joe Dumars, a veteran guard for the NBA
Detroit Pistons renowned for his decent behavior on a team that
once bore the nickname ``Bad Boys.''
</P>
<P>
   As for its influence on children, Dumars added, ``All these
young guys know what it takes to lead off the sports.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian Burke, former head of hockey operations for the NHL, now
general manager of the Vancouver Canucks, was visibly angry when
asked if he felt the media, especially television, put too much
emphasis on the unsportsmanlike behaviors of a few. In hockey, that
meant showing too many fights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll see a great game, 5-4,'' Burke said, by way of example.
``Lots of goals, lots of banging. Lots of great goaltending.
\RLater\S I turn on ``SportsCenter'', and the first thing they show
is the fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It drives me crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   To hear media critics tell it, everybody would be a lot better
off if only TV, magazines and newspapers would stop showing, over
and over, those images of Roberto Alomar spitting at the umpire,
Dennis Rodman kicking that photographer, or Deion Sanders strutting
into the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, media executives, particularly those for the
major TV sports networks, which get most of the blame, disagree.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly something we think about and discuss, but we
think our first responsibility is to report what happened. We get
very uncomfortable when we make social judgments,'' said Bob Eaton,
vice president and managing editor for ESPN, a company that perhaps
has had the greatest media influence on sports fans in the past
decade thanks to its popular ``SportsCenter'' shows and its three
networks, including the 24-hour-a-day ESPNews.
</P>
<P>
   Eaton's beliefs are echoed by others in sports journalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we should edit out something that's news,'' said
Steve Robinson, managing editor for CNN/SI and a former senior
editor for the most influential sports magazine of the modern era,
``Sports Illustrated''.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he believed the media could help cut down on
unsportsmanlike behavior by being more selective in what it airs,
Robinson added, ``We're not activists. We're not advocates.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a view not welcomed by one critic, baseball pitcher Orel
Hershiser, who, speaking on the ESPN panel, said, ``The leaders at
the network can change. They can make different choices.''
</P>
<P>
   Other critics suggest that sports media could offer more of a
balance in their coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The interpreters of the images on TV and in the print media
have failed to reinforce the good conduct like they do the bad
conduct,'' said Big Ten Conference commissioner Jim Delany. ``They
pay more attention to an unusual event and repeat it. You'll see
someone kick dirt on an umpire 100 times. You might see someone
help someone up once.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately,'' Dallas Cowboys quarterback Troy Aikman adds,
``Sensationalism sells.''
</P>
<P>
   Sports media executives say their mission is other than what
critics suggest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The role of the networks and all the media is to find the most
compelling story and to tell that story, as well as to adhere to
certain levels of journalistic integrity,'' said Terry Ewert,
sports executive for CBS. ``The ultimate in journalism is truth. As
broadcasters, we would be criticized if we ignored elements that
fit into the story of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, journalists say they're acutely aware of the
sportsmanship issue, and some say they take behavior issues into
consideration when deciding what to air, and what not to air.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the ability through this medium to reach millions and
millions of people,'' said Vince Wladika, spokesman for Fox Sports.
``We have to take it seriously. We have meetings on subjects like
this all the time. We don't have a blanket policy. We take each
situation individually and analyze it.''
</P>
<P>
   At Fox, Wladika said, that can mean leaving out a hot-dogging,
showboating act by a player, assuming it's deemed to be not
newsworthy.
</P>
<P>
   Sports journalists say an act is newsworthy when it has an
impact on the game, the team or the player in some important way. A
basketball brawl or a baseball beanball scuffle gets airtime,
network executives say, as do off-the-field problems.
</P>
<P>
   It is not, they maintain, simply a case of, ``If it bleeds, it
leads,'' the credo of the sensationalist media.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, the taunting of opponents is generally ignored on
sports shows, they add, as are outbreaks of rowdy behavior by fans
in the stands. In most cases, they say, these incidents don't
affect the story of the game. Further, media executives say, they
don't want to promote copy-cat actions by viewers watching such
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Sports news sources aren't the only media outlets under scrutiny
in the sportsmanship debate. Corporate America, through its
aggressive marketing and advertising of sports-related products,
has also drawn attention.
</P>
<P>
   Two advertisements on display in a recent ``ESPN Magazine''
reflect the change in corporate attitudes toward the importance of
sportsmanlike behavior.
</P>
<P>
   A computer game called ``NFL Xtreme,'' endorsed by the NFL, is
touted as ``gridiron war. There's no rules, no penalties and no
boundaries,'' according to the advertising copy. ``It's a
helmet-popping, trash-talking, late-hitting free-for-all.''
</P>
<P>
   Another advertisement, for adidas athletic shoes, suggests, ``Be
at war with your opponent.''
</P>
<P>
   ``ESPN Magazine'' is geared toward a young readership, a fact
clearly known by the two advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   Sports media executives agree that whether or not there actually
is more unsportsmanlike behavior today, there certainly appears to
be. That's because a viewer can now watch the same highlight clip
repeatedly throughout the day, whether on the same station, or on
different networks across the dial.
</P>
<P>
   Says Robinson, ``Perhaps it does give the impression that
there's more today.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics of media coverage suggest that the more unsportsmanlike
behavior shown, the worse it is for society. But Robinson, for one,
says there might be some redeeming quality in exposing such acts to
viewers and readers, no matter how unpalatable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it's a good thing for people to see this stuff,'' he
said. ``If a brawl is portrayed in a way that shows that it's
really ugly, maybe people will think something should be done about
it.''

BAILOUT ON WAY FOR RANGERS' BELEAGUERED BULLPEN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Left-hander Scott Bailes, who Monday rejoined the Texas
Rangers in Boston, pronounced his left shoulder ready for duty.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Johnny Oates will decide when Bailes resumes his role in
the Rangers' bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Bailes, who went on the 15-day disabled list Aug. 1 with
bursitis in his left shoulder, could be reinstated as early as
before the second game of Tuesday's scheduled doubleheader against
the Red Sox at Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   Rain forced Monday night's game to be rescheduled as part of
Tuesday's day/night doubleheader. The Red Sox scheduled the first
game for 12:05 p.m. and the second for 5:05 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided that with the bullpen the way it was that we would
be better off by not making a move and standing pat for a day or
two,'' Oates said. ``We could make a move between games (Tuesday)
depending on what happens in the first game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' four-game series with the Yankees in New York taxed
their bullpen. Right-hander Danny Patterson and left-hander Eric
Gunderson pitched Friday, Saturday and Sunday. Right-handers Xavier
Hernandez and Tim Crabtree pitched Saturday and Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the Rangers require right-hander Al Levine in the bullpen
should the need arise for a long reliever. Oates does not want
Bailes being forced to pitch three or four innings in his first
appearance after a medical rehabilitation assignment with Double-A
Tulsa.
</P>
<P>
   Bailes pitched Friday and Saturday for the Drillers and said his
arm ``feels better than it has in a month.''
</P>
<P>
   Bailes passed one test by pitching consecutive days without
discomfort, but his velocity dropped during his second appearance.
Bailes' fastball registered 88-91 mph during his appearance Friday,
but it fell to 86 mph during Saturday's appearance, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That showed that it might not be best for me to pitch
consecutive days until I get a couple of innings under my belt,''
Bailes said.
</P>
<P>
   Bailes could provide the Rangers' bullpen a shot in the arm upon
his return should he pitch effectively. The Rangers missed Bailes
even more during Gunderson's recent struggles.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was not a good situation,'' Gunderson said of his
performance combined with Bailes' absence.
</P>
<P>
   However, Gunderson enters Tuesday's games with 2 1/3 scoreless
innings in his past four appearances. That includes the critical,
inning-ending, double-play ground ball he induced from Yankees
first baseman Tino Martinez, a left-handed batter, during the
seventh inning of Sunday's 6-5 defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel I've worked some things out and will pitch better
now,'' Gunderson said. ``The most important part of our season is
coming up. What's in front of us is far more important that what I
did the past two weeks. Plus, we're going to get another lefty back
in the bullpen, and that will help.''

White House counsel who is a key Clinton advisor, since he fought
in court here for the right to question him. But over the next few
weeks, Starr is expected to shift most of his attention from
evidence collecting to evidence sifting as he combs through the
facts and testimony for any ``substantial and credible
information'' that ``may constitute grounds for impeachment.'' By

   WASHINGTON _ Following is a list of the times when President
Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton, as well as other presidents
over the last two decades, have provided testimony. Clinton is the
first president to testify in a criminal investigation of his own
conduct, but other presidents have testified in criminal matters.
</P>
<P>
   Testimony by the Clintons
</P>
<P>
   June 12, 1994 Clinton and his wife, Hillary, provide sworn
testimony to Robert Fiske Jr., the independent counsel
investigating the Whitewater matter. The president and Mrs. Clinton
are questioned separately in the White House. Clinton spends 90
minutes answering questions from Fiske and his deputy. Mrs. Clinton
is questioned for an hour.
</P>
<P>
   April 22, 1995 The president and Mrs. Clinton are questioned in
the White House by the new Whitewater independent counsel, Kenneth
Starr, and his aides. Clinton's interview lasts about two hours.
Mrs. Clinton's interview also lasts about two hours.
</P>
<P>
   Jan. 16, 1996 Mrs. Clinton testifies for more than four hours
before a federal grand jury in Washington investigating the
disappearance and sudden recovery of billing records from her
former Arkansas law firm that detail some of Mrs. Clinton's legal
work on Whitewater-related matters while at the firm.
</P>
<P>
   April 28, 1996 Clinton gives videotaped testimony in a criminal
trial involving his former Whitewater business partners, James and
Susan McDougal. He testifies for more than three hours in the White
House as a defense witness for the McDougals. All copies of the
taped testimony are ordered sealed until played at the trial.
</P>
<P>
   July 7, 1996 Clinton gives a sworn deposition in the trial of
two Arkansas bankers charged with making illegal donations to his
1990 campaign for governor. The testimony is videotaped in the
White House and lasts two hours 20 minutes. The deposition is given
at the request of the defense. The tape is ordered sealed until
played at the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Jan. 14, 1998 Mrs. Clinton is questioned at the White House for
about 15 minutes by Starr and his deputies concerning the White
House's gathering of FBI background files on political appointees
from past Republican administrations.
</P>
<P>
   Jan. 17, 1998 Clinton is questioned for six hours in his
lawyer's office by lawyers for Paula Corbin Jones in her sexual
misconduct suit against him. The deposition is videotaped. He is
asked, among other things, about Monica Lewinsky, a former intern
at the White House, and he denies he had a sexual relationship with
her. In March, Ms. Jones' lawyers release excerpts from the
president's deposition.
</P>
<P>
   April 25, 1998 Starr and his deputies question Mrs. Clinton for
nearly five hours at the White House about her work as a private
lawyer for the failed savings and loan at the center of the
Whitewater investigation. The session is videotaped so it can be
presented to an Arkansas grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Aug. 17, 1998 Clinton is questioned for four hours in the White
House Map Room by prosecutors for Starr about his relationship with
Ms. Lewinsky. The questioning is videotaped and broadcast via
closed-circuit television to the Washington grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Testimony by Previous Presidents
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Reagan agreed in November 1987 to respond to written
questions from Lawrence Walsh, the special counsel in the
Iran-contra inquiry. After leaving office, he gave videotaped
testimony in 1990 in the Iran-contra trial of John Poindexter, his
national security adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Carter testified on videotape for two prosecutions: one in
1978 in a federal gambling conspiracy case against a Georgia state
legislator, and another in 1980 in a grand jury investigation of
Robert Vesco, the fugitive financier. In 1979 he gave a four-hour
deposition at the White House to a special counsel investigating
accusations of financial improprieties at the Carter family's
peanut warehouse. And in 1980 Carter gave a deposition to the
Justice Department about his conversations with Attorney General
Benjamin Civiletti about an investigation into whether Carter's
brother, Billy, had violated the Foreign Agents Registration Act.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Ford while in office gave a videotaped deposition in the
trial of Lynette Fromme, who was accused of trying to assassinate
him, after the court rejected a White House proposal that he submit
a written statement. Ms. Fromme was convicted in 1975.

POSITION CHANGE NOTHING NEW FOR TCU DEFENSIVE BACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WHIT CANNING 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ When TCU dropped in on Kansas for the 1997
season opener, Reggie Hunt _ former all-state tailback _ was back
in his accustomed niche.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a handoff early in the game, the former Denison High
School star whizzed through a gap, ripped off an impressive gain
... and fumbled the ball.
</P>
<P>
   From there, the season generally progressed in a southerly
direction for Hunt and the Horned Frogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bad start,'' he says, smiling. ``I get about 12 or 13 yards
and then fumble. From there, it was a bad year _ bad for us, bad
for the coaches, bad for the fans, the student body, the people in
the community ...''
</P>
<P>
   But this is a new season, and Hunt _ moved back to the secondary
after the fourth game last fall _ is figuring to fill a key spot in
coach Dennis Franchione's innovative 4-2-5 defensive scheme.
</P>
<P>
   And Hunt is feeling good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really like this,'' he says. ``We have a new system, a new
coach, and definitely a new attitude. This year is going to be a
whole lot better.''
</P>
<P>
   And so, Reggie, you'll never really miss not carrying the ball
anymore, eh?
</P>
<P>
   ``Just every day,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   But Hunt, who became a starter in the TCU secondary as a
freshman in 1996, is realistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a running back was always my thing,'' he says, ``but
there are an awful lot of good running backs. This way, I think I
can contribute more right now _ and I have two full years to learn
this system and settle in.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is exactly the way Franchione has it figured.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew about Reggie's athletic ability when we came here,''
he says. ``I just felt that what he needed most was a position. He
needed to find a particular position on the team and stay there.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he just keeps bouncing around from spot to spot, he'll
never learn any position, and that doesn't help any of us.''
</P>
<P>
   The position Hunt is learning is weak safety _ the spot occupied
on Franchione's New Mexico team last year by former Lamar High
School standout Scott McGarrahan, who won All-Western Athletic
Conference recognition.
</P>
<P>
   It is basically the ``extra'' safety position in Franchione's
three-safety secondary scheme specifically devised for the
pass-oriented WAC.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll line up on the weak side of the formation and give us
extra run protection,'' Franchione says, ``but he's also always in
the pass coverage scheme.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key man back there is probably the free safety, because
he's the `quarterback' of the defense. But the weak safety is a
very important cog.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually, if that player plays well, the defense plays well.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunt says he likes the system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm enjoying it,'' he says. ``It's a defense that can be
confusing to the opposing offense, but it's not really difficult to
learn. I'm not having a problem with it right now.''
</P>
<P>
   As for that daily yearning ...
</P>
<P>
   ``I never saw a good running back who didn't want to carry the
football,'' Franchione says. ``It's natural, but he'll have a
chance to touch the ball on kickoff returns, so he won't be
completely away from it.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the experiment in the offensive backfield last year
produced only 89 yards on 27 carries, Hunt did average 27.1 yards
on 10 kickoff returns after leading the team in that department in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   The Frogs hope he will become the defensive back he was two
years ago, when he had 55 tackles, two forced fumbles and two sacks
after becoming a starter at midseason.
</P>
<P>
   As a high school senior in '95, Hunt was all-district both ways
and all-state on offense when he ran for more than 2,000 yards and
scored 40 touchdowns while leading Denison to a 15-1 record and a
berth in the state finals. His ankle injury in a semifinal victory
against Mount Pleasant probably doomed the Yellow Jackets to a
lackluster finish _ a 31-8 loss to La Marque in the finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still get a little twinge in that ankle occasionally,'' Hunt
says, ``but mostly I get a lot of grief about that La Marque game
from all the guys on this team that are from that area down there.
</P>
<P>
   ``In those days, I considered myself mainly a running back, but
I always thought I might be able to live on my defensive ability if
I had to.''

TCU COACH SEES NEW LOOK AS MORALE BOOSTER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID A. MARKIEWICZ 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ If Dennis Franchione was certain of anything
when he took over the TCU football program, it was that changes
would have to be made. The Horned Frogs, after all, went 1-10 under
Pat Sullivan in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The most important difference he could make, though _ a major
talent upgrade _ might take years to achieve. So Franchione dipped
into the coaches' bag of psychological tricks and made a move
unquestioned for its simplicity or its brilliance.
</P>
<P>
   He changed the color of the helmets.
</P>
<P>
   Out with the silver; in with the purple. Off with the TCU logo,
on with the Spirit Frog.
</P>
<P>
   He also redesigned the jerseys, going to a darker shade of
purple, and reconfigured the locker room into a single, open space.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that Franchione's become a dedicated follower of
fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, Franchione explained, ``It's a piece of the whole
attitude change I'm trying to develop here.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team,'' Franchione said, ``needs to gain confidence,
self-esteem, put last year behind them. Cleanse their minds. I
can't change the players a great deal, but I can change how they
think. And changing the helmet and the uniforms and the locker room
is all part of that process.''
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of coaches and players agree with Franchione. What might
be cosmetic alterations to outsiders can represent a whole new and
improved era to a football team, especially one that's been living
on the dark side.
</P>
<P>
   Money also plays a role in some schools' decision to change
uniforms, logos or color combinations. New and different tends to
sell more, and university athletic departments rely on sales of
licensed merchandise as an important revenue stream in a time of
tighter budgets.
</P>
<P>
   But, for the most part, it's a mind thing. Downtrodden programs
at local schools such as the University of North Texas and SMU have
made their own fashion changes in recent years, particularly when
they've hired new coaches. By contrast, traditionally successful
programs, like the University of Nebraska, aren't as likely to make
major changes, such as dropping the ``N'' from its helmets, even
when a new coach is hired.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like we're starting over,'' explained TCU punter and wide
receiver Royce Huffman, endorsing his school's changes. ``It's a
whole new attitude: getting rid of the past and starting fresh.
It's psychological. Yeah, I think it's going to help us.''
</P>
<P>
   TCU linebacker Joseph Phipps calls the darker purple color and
the new helmets ``a nice change,'' but adds, ``the color of the
helmet's not really going to matter when you get out there against
Iowa State or Oklahoma.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he would rather play in the old colors of the
NFL's Tampa Bay Bucanneeers, or Tampa's new, improved colors,
Phipps laughed. He chose the new look, but said that's not the
reason the Bucs are finally winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The changes in their uniforms didn't make them a better
team,'' Phipps said. ``It was their coaches' and players'
commitment to do better. We changed our uniforms, but what we're
really trying to do change is our commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   A change in commitment is what Hayden Fry had in mind when he
took over the coaching job at the University of Iowa in 1979. Fry,
a student of psychology, gave the Hawkeyes black helmets and
mimicked the uniforms of the Pittsburgh Steelers who'd just
finished a run of Super Bowl championship seasons. He also changed
the school logo to a meaner-looking hawk.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing he did when he came here was change the
uniform,'' recalled Phil Haddy, sports information director at
Iowa. ``He didn't want his team putting on the old uniform, which
was associated with losing.''
</P>
<P>
   That was some of the thinking behind the UNT's decision to
emphasize the ``Mean Green'' nickname and logo over the ``Eagles.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always been the Mean Green and the Eagles. We just tried
to put more emphasis on Mean Green because it represented a time
when we were more successful,'' said associate athletic director
Hank Dickenson. ``You're maybe trying to create a new era.''
</P>
<P>
   There will be fewer such changes at UNT this season, even though
a new coach is in place, Darrell Dickey. Dickenson said that's
because there have been many changes in recent years at UNT, and
consistency is needed.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, coaches make more subtle changes in fashion. SMU head
coach Mike Cavan added horseshoe stickers to the helmets of
top-performing players. At practice, he has his players wearing
T-shirts that say, ``TEAM'' in bold lettering. Underneath, in small
print, it reads: ``me.'' The Mustangs also have moved away from
blue jerseys to red jerseys under Cavan, who is in his second
season.
</P>
<P>
   Academics don't place too much importance on a team's change in
colors or uniform design but, professors say, they're not suprised
to see them.
</P>
<P>
   ``You move into a new house,'' said Michael Katovich, a
professor of sociology at TCU, ``the first thing you do is change
the color.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bizarre notion to me,'' adds Richard Crepeau, who
teaches sports history at the University of Central Florida, ``to
think that there would be some psychological impact. But coaches
will do anything to get an edge.''

MOYER TAMES TIGERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM MOORE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Radar guns don't register efficiency and location.
They measure speed, not guile. They don't tell you a thing about
Jamie Moyer.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariner left-hander has the look of a batting-practice
pitcher who lobs fat ones across the plate. But his smooth delivery
and fluctuating velocity confuse overeager hitters. They flail and
lunge and head back to the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   In his own way, Moyer overpowered the Detroit Tigers Monday
night. Backed by Ken Griffey's two-run double in the first inning
and Russ Davis' RBI single in the sixth, Moyer pitched the Mariners
to a 3-1 victory in front of 38,639 fans at the Kingdome.
</P>
<P>
   Moyer improved to 10-8, a record suggesting an average season,
even disappointing compared to last year's 17-5. But he might be
having a better year now. The Tigers won't argue.
</P>
<P>
   In four outings covering 301/3 innings, he has given up just two
earned runs against Detroit, an ERA of .059
</P>
<P>
   ``There are usually one or two teams a year you have success
with, one or two you don't,'' Moyer said. ``Why? I don't have an
answer.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers were also clueless. They sat in the dugout, eager to
attack. You see Moyer on the mound, all 6-feet and 170 pounds of
him, an unimposing presence who throws junk. The deduction is that
he can be had.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked like you could take some good hacks against him,''
said Detroit third baseman Gabe Alvarez. ``But then you get up
there and the ball is right off the corners and every pitch is
knee-high.''
</P>
<P>
   More than staring them down, Moyer studies hitters. He plays
games, outguessing them. They think fastball, he throws a change or
vice-versa. Every five days, Moyer conducts clinics. Monday night,
the Tigers were unwilling participants just as they have been all
season.
</P>
<P>
   Moyer needs perfect location and varying speeds to succeed. His
typical fastball travels at 85 mph. His change is consistent at 73
mph. The cutter, a combination of a fastball and slider, might come
in at 80 mph. He's a cab driver on the mound, hitting the brake and
then the gas, a herky-jerky master of motion and deception.
</P>
<P>
   Moyer studies hitters, knowing strengths, exploiting weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``He does it better than any pitcher I've ever seen,'' said
catcher John Marzano.
</P>
<P>
   Lou Piniella points to Moyer's control.
</P>
<P>
   ``He might have the best walks-per-inning-pitched ratio in
baseball,'' the Mariner manager said. Moyer walked one, lowering
his average to 1.7 for every nine innings.
</P>
<P>
   So you know you're going to get something to hit. But there is
too much hesitancy and not enough patience. All the while, Moyer
mixes his strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were talking about getting up on the plate,'' Alvarez said.
``Then he started busting everybody inside. He made it extremely
tough.''
</P>
<P>
   In the eighth inning, Alvarez stood in the box with the bases
loaded. Thankfully, Moyer was gone, replaced by Mariner closer Mike
Timlin. That calls for another adjustment, trying to get around on
fastballs and sinkers in the low 90s. Alvarez bounced into a
forceout.
</P>
<P>
   Moyer reduced his ERA for the season to 3.55, an improvement
over 3.86 last year. The difference is that the Mariners have not
supported him with enough help from the bats and the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   He found assistance Monday night. Griffey's bolt off the
left-center-field wall, the first of his two fence-rattling
doubles, brought home Joey Cora and Alex Rodriguez. Tiger starter
Brian Moehler was rocked before he registered the first out.
Griffey did not homer Monday night, remaining at 42 and on a pace
for 56, which would match his total from '97.
</P>
<P>
   Timlin got the last out in the eighth and struck out Paul Bako
to end the game for his 10th save.
</P>
<P>
   Moyer escaped two earlier jams with two runners on. The Tigers
failed to capitalize because of identical developments. In the fith
and seventh innings, Bako lined out to Shane Monahan in left field.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners improved to 56-66 and remained 10 games behind the
Angels. Even if the M's go 29-11 in their final 40 games, the
Angels could go 19-19 and still win the AL West title at 86-76.
That doesn't even factor in what the Rangers might be doing.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners need to face the 48-74 Tigers more often in the
stretch. They have taken five straight from Detroit but only have
one game remaining Tuesday night at the Kingdome. Paul Spoljaric
will face Seth Greisinger at 7:05.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had success against Detroit,'' Piniella said. ``I hope
it continues for one more day.''
</P>
<P>
   This is an important eight-game homestand against weak
opponents. The Mariners need to win every game against Detroit,
Toronto and the Chicago White Sox or at least go 7-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no room for losses,'' said third baseman Russ Davis,
who played his ninth consecutive game without making an error.
``We're 10 games back. It's reachable. It's been done in the past.
As long as we take care of our part, hopefully other teams will do
their part and lose.''
</P>
<P>
   After the homestand, the Mariners face a daunting nine-game road
trip that takes them to Cleveland, New York and Boston, confronting
the three best teams in the American League.

LINEMAN'S DECISION PAYS OFF FOR TEXAS A&AMP;M (For use by NYTimes News

By MIKE JONES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ Junior guard Semisi Heimuli is
scheduled to start his 26th consecutive game in the offensive line
for Texas A&AMP;M when the Aggies line up against Florida State in the
Kickoff Classic on Aug. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Where he might have been on that day if his former coach at
Trinity High School in Euless, Texas, had not talked him out of
returning to California five years ago is open to conjecture. Not
all of the possibilities are pleasant to contemplate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go back home now and see my old friends and not one of them
is playing at a big college or anything like that,'' Heimuli said.
``Some of them have been locked up. A couple of them are dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Heimuli, born in San Francisco of Tongan heritage, moved to
Euless with his father in time to enter Trinity High School. But
late in his sophomore year, he was so overcome with homesickness
that he decided to go to the West Coast to visit his mother. The
visit only exacerbated his California dreaming, and he decided to
return there to live.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just felt out of place in Texas,'' Heimuli recalled. ``The
pace was just so much slower.''
</P>
<P>
   Heimuli had to clear one obstacle, however _ getting Trinity
football coach Ed Hickman to sign forms for dropping classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got signatures from every one of my teachers,'' Heimuli
said. ``But I couldn't go to coach Hickman. I saved him for last. I
even tried to get one of the assistant coaches to sign my sheet,
but he wouldn't do it. When I finally walked into (Hickman's)
office, I couldn't talk or look at him straight in the face.''
</P>
<P>
   Hickman left no doubt where he stood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tore up his drop sheet and told him to go back to class,''
Hickman remembered. ``I said, `Son, if you stay here, you're going
to go on to be a big-time player in a big-time program.' And he
has. I'm very proud of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Heimuli hasn't looked back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad he talked me out of it,'' Heimuli said. ``He told me
that if I went back home, some not-so-good things could happen to
me. What he said made a lot of sense. I lived in a rough part of
the Bay Area. There were a lot of gangs. Everyone was going at
everyone _ Tongans against Samoans, Samoans against Mexicans,
Mexicans against blacks. It was pretty bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Add A&AMP;M coach R.C. Slocum to the list of those happy that
Heimuli chose the route he did. Not only has Heimuli (6-foot-1, 310
pounds) become an anchor for the offensive line, he has helped the
Aggies recruit two more highly regarded line prospects from Trinity
_ redshirt freshman and fellow Tongan Moses Vakalahi (6-5, 295) and
freshman Chris Montgomery (6-8, 335).
</P>
<P>
   Plans are to hold out Montgomery for a redshirt season, where he
won't play but will practice and have four years of eligibility
remaining. Vakalahi will be a swing backup at tackle this fall,
primarily playing behind senior Rex Tucker. Right tackle Cameron
Spikes and Heimuli are the two returning starters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have some holes to fill, but we have some candidates,''
Slocum said. ``It's time for Semisi to take it up a notch. To this
point, he's been the tag-along to the experienced guys like (center
Koby) Hackradt and (guard) Steve McKinney, a guy you plug in to
fill a hole. But now he's one of those veterans who has played a
lot and we need him to step it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Slocum said Heimuli has compensated for a relative lack of
height with tenacity, an unusual football IQ and maturity gleaned
from a strong high school program that enabled him to start as a
redshirt freshman.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is probably going to be the biggest and best offensive
line I've played on since I've been here,'' Heimuli said.
</P>
<P>
   As the Aggies hope to have a more efficient and versatile
passing game this season to complement a respected running attack,
the offensive line is key.
</P>
<P>
   ``It remains to be seen how well they play and how soon they
play well,'' Slocum said. ``But considering the guys we open up
with, it better be the first ball game.''

PAC-10 PUNISHES USC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC has been stripped of a men's basketball
scholarship for the 1999-2000 school year because last season the
university's director of compliance misinterpreted NCAA rules and
awarded one scholarship above the limit.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacific-10 Conference penalized USC after discovering that
walk-on guard Claude Green was illegally awarded a scholarship last
season. USC director of compliance Leslie Daland approved the
scholarship for Green without realizing the Trojans were already
considered at the legal limit of 13.
</P>
<P>
   According to sources, confusion arose because center Philip Von
Backstrom transferred during the school year and his scholarship
was not properly counted when Green received his grant.
</P>
<P>
   ``She thought once Philip left, his scholarship was available,''
a university official said. ``It wasn't.''
</P>
<P>
   USC's faculty athletic representative, Noel Ragsdale, said
Monday that USC simply overlooked a provision of the NCAA manual
when it made the mistake. She did not specify the nature of the
error.
</P>
<P>
   ``A good faith error was made,'' Ragsdale said. ``It was a
complicated process of putting together four provisions of the NCAA
manual. One was labeled in a way we didn't look at and that turned
out to be the controlling provision. There were four provisions and
one was overlooked.''
</P>
<P>
   NCAA rules actually call for two scholarships to be eliminated,
but Ragsdale convinced the Pac-10 to reduce the penalty because
USCwas not trying to gain an athletic advantage by giving Green a
scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason it was awarded to Claude Green was not for athletic
purposes but to help him get his degree,'' Ragsdale said.
</P>
<P>
   USC paid a heavy price for giving Green his scholarship. Green
appeared in just one game last season and played one minute. He
ended up quitting the team before the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Because USC is currently at its scholarship limit, the penalty
goes into effect next season. That means USC coach Henry Bibby will
be able to sign just two players this year instead of three. It is
particularly harmful because this is considered a deep recruiting
class in Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans already have an oral commitment from 6-foot-5
shooting guard Nate Hair of Capistrano Valley, and will be limited
to signing one other player.
</P>
<P>
   Bibby is on vacation and could not be reached for comment.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Clinton should resign
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the admission he lied about his relationship with Monica
Lewinsky, President Bill Clinton goes from lame duck to dead duck.
The Clinton presidency is over and the president would do best not
to wait to see if he can hold enough public and congressional
support to linger in office but to resign and let Vice President Al
Gore start a new slate.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has lost all moral authority in the office. That he lied
under oath _ or was only ``legally accurate,'' as he put it _ is of
course a legitimate issue of law but in the politically contrived
circumstances of the lie, pretty thin law. The testimony was
inadmissible in a civil suit filed as a political ploy and thrown
out by the judge as groundless.
</P>
<P>
   Crucially, the president lied to the people, on whose sole
authority his tenure rests, and that is a matter of trust. What is
more, with his dodgy language at first, and now apparently
attempting a silly and hopeless distinction about what is and isn't
sex, he lied by coyness. He compounded brazen dishonesty with the
petty con of a barroom grifter.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, as emotionally slovenly and insanely reckless as his
relations with a White House intern were, we still never should
have known of them. The affair was consensual; no matters of state
were involved. We will be a long time sorting through the
hyperkinetic workings of the special-prosecutor law and the
relentless machinations of Clinton enemies that, combined, finally
accomplished their long-sought end of maneuvering the president
into what amounted to a trap.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Clinton's own manifest misbehavior that was the
proximate cause of this presidency's collapse.
</P>
<P>
   The president's perfidy has put the nation through seven months
of psychodrama. It has financially ruined and emotionally
devastated untold numbers of his associates and has drawn from his
defenders prodigies of dissimulation and rationalization that ought
never been asked, or allowed. We can only guess at the damage to
his family.
</P>
<P>
   Together, Clinton's long retreat through a season pinstriped
with backup lines and Kenneth Starr's hounding excesses have
damaged the institution of the presidency, if not beyond repair
then in ways that it will take a long time to fix. Future
presidents will come less to a magisterial office than to hardened
political bunker.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore is well-prepared for the presidency. A senator for eight
years, he hasn't been the mere time-server many vice presidents
have been but an active partner in the policies of the
administration and in their execution.
</P>
<P>
   He would come to office against a backdrop of Republican efforts
to make his campaign fund-raising molehills into the mountains of
malfeasance, but that game is mainly a partisan move to block a
Gore nomination in 2000. Most Americans recognize Gore as honest
and would accept him as constitutionally authentic in the office.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton has fumbled away his presidency. He nonetheless has
a case to make to history for his accomplishments, but that case
will be better made now from a private den than from a hollowed
public office _ and better made to a nation composed by his
retirement than uneasy over his tenacity.

 &HT;    SMALL ISRAELI SOFTWARE COMPANIES CATCHING EYE OF AMERICAN GIANTS
 &HT;    With photo to be placed in the International folder on the Cox
Server.
 &HT;    Moving in both the (i) International and (f) Financial
categories.

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ With recent software deals pouring hundreds of
millions of dollars into Israeli companies, the new celebrities
here are no longer army generals or politicians, but high school
dropouts.
</P>
<P>
   In June, America Online announced that it bought Tel Aviv-based
Mirabilis Ltd. for $287 million in cash and up to another $120
million based on future growth. The two-year-old company invented
ICQ, an Internet chat service with more than 14 million users.
</P>
<P>
   Ninety percent of the money goes to its four twenty-something
founders -- two of whom never made it through 12th grade -- and one
of their parents.
</P>
<P>
   But, Mirabilis was topped -- in dollars if not in cult fame --
last week when the more conventional software company, Memco, was
bought for $412 million in stock by Illinois-based Platinum
Technology. Memco makes software for securing information stored on
Internet servers.
</P>
<P>
   The two deals highlight the growing Israeli software industry,
where companies are making their marks as acquisition targets or
niche providers.
</P>
<P>
   More than 300 Israeli software firms had about $1.2 billion in
sales for 1997, with growth running at about 25 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   The growth has been fueled not only by government incentives,
but also by Israeli attributes that mesh well with software
development.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's small population, about 6 million, requires any
software maker seeking sales to aim for a global product. Israelis
are generally highly-skilled and English, the first language of the
Internet, is common here.
</P>
<P>
   Also, hostile neighbors have prompted a defense industry that
emphasizes high technology and spawns entrepreneurs. The founders
of Memco, with about 200 employees and $30 million in revenue last
year, were once in the army's computer unit.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, unlike other industries, software can be developed even
in a country with little land and few natural resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``The starting point for everyone is more or less equal,'' said
Yoav Shaham, vice president of marketing for Israel's Formula
Systems.
</P>
<P>
   Formula, a conglomerate of about 30 software companies, makes
products sold around the world for controlling airport lighting
systems, converting European businesses to the new Euro currency
and fixing the so-called Year 2000 bug.
</P>
<P>
   It is one of the few Israeli software companies that has reached
a substantial size, and is making a global impact. It is traded on
NASDAQ and has about 2,200 employees.
</P>
<P>
   But, tiny Mirabilis (Latin for ``Marvelous'') has captured the
most attention lately. Though they have refused most interviews,
the T-shirted, borderline-scruffy, founders made a splash in the
Israeli media.
</P>
<P>
   When one went, unintroduced, to check out the selection at an
upscale car dealership, the salesman took at look at the youngster
and cracked, ``Who do you think you are, one of those Mirabilis
kids?''
</P>
<P>
   The co-founders hatched their idea over games of ping-pong. Most
had been using computers since childhood but were bouncing between
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   They convinced Yossi Vardi, venture capitalist and father of
co-founder Arik Vardi, to invest in the plan. The company grew to
about 65 employees and did not seek to generate revenue.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was to build a community of Internet users so large
that a larger company would want to buy it -- and it worked.
</P>
<P>
   Vardi said the founders are working nights now trying to improve
their product in defense against plans by Microsoft to hatch
another instant chat service.
</P>
<P>
   The key to Mirabilis' ICQ is that it automatically tells users
if any of their friends are also on the Internet, allowing for
instant contact.
</P>
<P>
   Vardi calls the stand against Microsoft a ``David and Goliath''
battle and says it's a familiar role for Israelis.

<P>
   CLINTON-INTERNET (San Francisco) _ President Clinton's historic
on-air mea culpa was followed by a historic on-line tidal wave of
instant reaction. News and ``portal'' Web sites like Yahoo logged a
crushing record number of visits from Web users, who unleashed an
outpouring of sound and fury that most agreed signified, well, not
much. By MATT BEER.
</P>
<P>
   RAINFOREST-BIRD (San Francisco) _ It has a raucous call, massive
bill and huge wingspan and until recently was thought to be a
sedentary creature. But scientists at two California universities
now say the hornbill may be the key to saving the vanishing
tropical rain forests in western and central Africa. By LARRY D.
HATFIELD.
</P>
<P>
   LAWSCHOOL-ADMISSIONS (Berkeley, Calif.) _ As UC-Berkeley's Boalt
Hall Law School approaches a second year of post-affirmative action
admissions, officials announced that minority admissions will be up
32 over what they were at the beginning of the 1997-98 school year.
The increase brings the number of minority students enrolled at the
law school to 85 of the total 275 student enrollment. By ROBERTS
SELNA.
</P>
<P>
   SF-MASSAGE (San Francisco) _ The city of San Francisco's Board
of Supervisors voted unanimously to place a moratorium on any
future massage parlors in the Tenderloin district, and to restrict
existing ones when there is a change in ownership. The board will
review the bill next week for final passage. By MARIANNE
COSTANTINOU and GREGORY LEWIS.
</P>
<P>
   BUSINESS/FINANCIAL NEWS (``f'' category)
</P>
<P>
   ASIAN-ECONOMY (San Francisco) _ The East Asian economies _ and
now Russia's, as well _ may be bleeding, but timely intervention
can staunch the hemorrhage and eventually restore the patients to
health. That was the assessment of James A. Harmon, chairman of the
Export-Import Bank of the United States. By DAVID ARMSTRONG.
</P>
<P>
   LIFESTYLE/FEATURES (``l'' category)
</P>
<P>
   SHOPPING (Albany, N.Y.) _ For those with doubts about President
Clinton's honesty, a Seattle company is offering a watch that
features a caricature of Clinton against an American-flag backdrop.
Under-the-dial animation produces the effect of Clinton's nose
tripling in length every 10 seconds. By STEVE BARNES.
</P>
<P>
   ENTERTAINMENT (``e'' category)
</P>
<P>
   TV-FORTUNE (Albany, N.Y.) _ ``Wheel of Fortune'' is now entering
its 16th year, started when Merv Griffin preciently determined an
expanded version of the kids' game hangman would translate well to
television. The genius of the syndicated monster is the game's
simplicity. By MARK McGUIRE.
</P>
<P>
   BOOKS-REVIEW-MYSTERIES (Undated) _ Tom Clancy's ``Rainbow Six''
(G.P. Putnam's Sons, $27.95, 740 pages) starts with a hijacking on
Page 4 and the pace rarely slackens in this well-crafted, very
readable thriller. By BOBBIE HESS.
</P>
<P>
   SPORTS (``s'' category)
</P>
<P>
   BBA-YANKEE-STADIUM (New York) _ The old cathedral has outlived
its usefulness. Hallowed grounds or not, the place should be
condemned. Yankee Stadium is a prisoner of its proud past, out of
date and unequipped to offer even the most modest amenities of the
modern ballpark. By STEVE CAMPBELL.
</P>
<P>
   FBN-GIANTS (Albany, N.Y.) _ Giants coach Jim Fassel surveys the
rubble of his 24-10 exhibition loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars and
declares, ``I'm not very happy right now.'' Maybe he'd feel a
better if he looked at the New York Jets, who suffered their worst
exhibition defeat in 22 years against the Baltimore Ravens. By
STEVE CAMPBELL.
</P>
<P>
   FBN-GIANTS-GRAHAM (Albany, N.Y.) _ In a seven-year NFL career,
Kent Graham has become Fassel-ized. Graham is on his second tour
with the New York Giants, again as a backup quarterback, but the
familiarity is more with Jim Fassel, his offensive coordinator in
1992 and 1996 and his head coach this season. By PETE DOUGHERTY.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENTARY (``k'' category)
</P>

Lewinsky. By ROB MORSE.
</P>
<P>
   LYNCH-COLUMN (Albany, N.Y.) _ Gary Evans saved prosecutor Ken
Bruno from having to decide whether to seek the death penalty for
the career criminal who'd admitted to five murders. Evans killed
himself, rendering the question moot. Still the issue of capital
punishment deserves exploration. By DAN LYNCH.

 &HT;    Grand Canyon offers unparalleled views, appreciation for time
and space
 &HT;    By Kendal Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND CANYON, Ariz. _ There really is no way to prepare for the
initial impact the Grand Canyon has on you. Especially from the
North Rim.
</P>
<P>
   At first you're seduced by the climate. As you make your way
from Jacob Lake through the Kaibab Plateau, the only reasonable
entrance to the North Rim area, the air becomes clean and dry and
the temperature steadily drops. The harsh desert floor that makes
up most of Arizona slowly transforms into an Alpine forest, with
lush, wild flower-laced meadows framing hills covered with towering
pines and wide birch trees.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as you approach the North Rim lodge, an old but sturdy
log-and-stone structure specifically built to blend into the rustic
setting, you are impressed by the rugged elegance of the area.
Visitors wander along parklike paths, from the gift shop to the
saloon, either waiting to eat in a dining room that's been booked
for three days or heading back to the small but comfortable cabins
nestled in the trees.
</P>
<P>
   It's all very hypnotizing, this beautiful combination of natural
and man-made scenery, a vacation spot seemingly made in heaven.
</P>
<P>
   And then you see the canyon.
</P>
<P>
   From the veranda of the lodge the horizon gives way to one of
the most incredible geological wonders on the planet. Peaks and
cliffs stand on top of slopes and ledges, shielding the great
chasms at the bottom from view, all of it dotted with trees and
shadows, thousands of feet down, miles across.
</P>
<P>
   The variations of landscape within the canyon are a result of
different layers of rock reacting differently to millions of years
of slow and silent erosion. It covers a vast amount of land, over a
million acres. Measured by the Colorado River, the canyon is 277
miles long, and at its deepest it is 6,000 vertical feet from rim
to water, all of it a collection of diverse geological and
biological features. It can not be taken in with a quick glance or
described by measurements. The stunning beauty of the Grand Canyon
is a testament to the awe-inspiring power of time and space.
</P>
<P>
   Over five million people a year visit the Grand Canyon. The
license plates in the parking lot of the lodge literally represent
every state in the union, but on the veranda it becomes apparent
that a large contingency of visitors are from abroad. Italian,
German and Swedish are as likely to be overheard as a Southern
drawl.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of these visitors congregate at the South Rim of
the canyon, which is more accessible and more tourist-oriented. The
Grand Canyon was home to entrepreneurial enterprises before it
became a national park, and the South Rim reflects that historic
commercialism. Open all year long, the South Rim has more places to
stay, more things to do. If you can't afford a helicopter ride or
don't feel up to riding a mule to the bottom, there's even an IMAX
theater to recreate the experience. And if you want to spot a
celebrity, chances are they will be frequenting the South Rim.
</P>
<P>
   But the North Rim, open from May 15 to Oct. 15, offers forests
in place of scrub brush, wilderness to development. And, since the
North Rim is higher in elevation than the South Rim, the view is
more spectacular, especially in the early morning or late evening,
when the shadows move quickly, giving every crevice and crack depth
and life, and the colors become bright and vital.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors must pay to enter the Grand Canyon National Park, but
the fee is nominal considering the wealth of serene and majestic
scenery the area offers. Once in the park, no fees or permits are
required for day hiking, which is the simplest way to acquaint
yourself with the canyon's immense size and natural beauty.
</P>
<P>
   From Bright Angel Point, a short walk along a paved path, there
are views of Roaring Springs, the only water source for the entire
park, and the San Francisco Peaks. Along the Widforss Trail, mule
deer and Kaibab squirrels can be spotted through a dense forest of
white fir, aspen and ponderosa pines. For more serious hikers, the
North Kaibab Trail leads 3,400 feet below the rim, past Coconino
Overlook and Supai Tunnel to Roaring Springs, but the trip is
strenuous and takes most people a full day.
</P>
<P>
   Several other equally beautiful points are easily accessible
from the North Rim lodge. A breathtaking, curving 20-mile drive
leads to Cape Royal, the only spot on the North Rim that offers a
view of the sinuous, muddy-green Colorado River.
</P>
<P>
   The short trail from the parking area to Cape Royal is shaded by
tall pinyon pines and juniper trees. Beneath those the land is
dotted with sagebrush and cliff rose bushes. Before you reach Cape
Royal, openings in the greenery afford a glance through Angel's
Window. Fractures of weakness in a large, jutting rock, coupled
with eons of weathering and the constant pull of gravity have
formed the window in this point, through which a bend in the
Colorado River is clearly visible. On top of this particular point,
visitors enjoy a 360-degree view of an area of the canyon that
inspired some of the earliest explorers.
</P>
<P>
   Clarence Dutton, who led the 1880-81 survey party to the North
Rim, named many of the landmarks in this part of the canyon. His
interest in Eastern religion and philosophy is responsible for the
heroic nomenclature of the area. Wotan's Throne, a narrow crag of
rock below Angel's Window, rests between Zoroaster Temple and
Vishnu Temple. To the right sits Brahma Temple, to the left,
Krishna Shrine.
</P>
<P>
   A shorter drive brings one to Point Imperial, the highest point
on the North Rim. From here visitors can see the Painted Desert in
the distance, just past Marble Canyon, which is a smaller precursor
to the Grand Canyon. This area, sandwiched between the Vermillion
and Echo cliffs, is where the Colorado River begins to carve its
way through the area, and is where the earliest pioneers began
their courageous explorations of the canyon.
</P>
<P>
   For those who wish to camp in the area, there are many options.
The lodge itself has a campground, complete with showers and
laundromat, but spaces are usually reserved well before the season
begins in May. Camping is allowed at designated spots within the
canyon, but these spots require back-country passes, which must be
reserved in advance. Campers in these back-country spots are asked
to adhere to the ``leave no trace'' principles, which include
staying on main trails, burying human waste and packing out all
garbage, including toilet paper. Fires are prohibited below the
rim.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to camp away from the crowds but don't desire to
hike into the interior of the canyon, there are sites all around
the canyon that are accessible by vehicle. However, most of these
are within national parks and can only be reached by driving long
distances down primitive roads that are not regularly maintained.
Ample supplies, such as water, food, gasoline and tools are
encouraged, since the only habitations on these routes are ranger
stations, which are closer to the canyon than they are to the main
roads.
</P>
<P>
   Point Sublime, widely heralded as the most beautiful spot on the
canyon rim, is at the end of a forest trail that is virtually
impassable by anything less than a four-wheel-drive vehicle.
Toroweep, although certainly not easy to get to, can be reached if
the driver casts fate to the wind, and the vehicle is still under
warranty.
</P>
<P>
   Toroweap has 11 established camp sites, two of which are
directly on the overlook, a narrow, 3,000-foot sliver of canyon
directly above the Colorado River. The area is populated with yucca
plants and cactuses, coyotes and jack rabbits. There are outhouses
available, but campers must bring their own water to drink and
their own wood to burn.
</P>
<P>
   The view is worth the drive. The rim along this slim portion of
the canyon is made up of huge sandstone boulders with large
crevices in between, allowing campers to climb down to lower
shelves on the wall. You can get as close to the edge as your
nerves allow, or you can sit comfortably at the top, watching the
sun dip below the plateaus in the distance, painting the skyline
pink and the landscape gold.
</P>
<P>
   The original Grand Canyon Lodge at the North Rim was built on
the canyon's edge in 1928 and was designed expressly to blend in
with the limestone cliff on which it stood. Destroyed by fire in
1932, it was rebuilt in 1936. Log cabins can be reserved ahead of
time, or day visitors can relax in the saloon or peruse the books
and maps in the visitors center. Although the lodge is impressive
in its remote luxury, it was obviously constructed with the main
attraction in mind.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every part of the lodge affords a view of the canyon. The
many windows in the dining room assure that every seat is a good
one. From the sun room, with its huge floor-to-ceiling windows,
visitors can meander out onto the wide veranda to sit in rocking
chairs and ponder the landscape and the sky.
</P>
<P>
   The custodians of the canyon are eager to share the history of
the area. Flashlight hikes are held every night, with park rangers
pointing out stars and constellations that can't be seen in less
remote places. Also, in the afternoons, talks are held on the
veranda. Visitors that may be expecting dry, academic lessons in
geology are usually surprised when rangers like Rick Danley make
presentations on topics such as the writers, artists and
photographers that were inspired by the canyon and helped document
it when it was first discovered. Danley's speech begins with the
story of John Wesley Powell, the explorer whose reports to the
government read more like poetry than a geological survey. Powell,
in turn, brought to the canyon photographer Jack Hillers, whose
work spurred painters such as Thomas Moran and Gunner Widforss,
among others, to dedicate much of their work to capturing the
visual beauty of the area.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, all that the North Rim offers hinges on one activity
_ looking. The longer you stare at the canyon, the greatest abyss
save the human soul, the more the canyon seems to touch you.
Perhaps it's the vastness, the unfathomable magnitude, quiet and
unchanged despite the multitudes that flock here every year. This
giant was here long before any of us, and will continue on long
after we are gone. Watch for any length of time and the whole
thing, as silent and still as the canyon is, seems to change as the
day changes, offering a new insight into the incredible power of
time, how the hardest of rocks can be sculpted with water and wind,
a concert of the most basic and lasting elements of this world.
Come with an attitude of innocent awe. Prepare to be moved.

 &HT;    Congress urged to clarify law
 &HT;    By Jenny Staletovich
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ More than 200 years ago, the framers of
the Constitution cut a deal with the nation's Indians that today
may clear the way for 24-hour casinos featuring booze, blackjack,
lotteries, parimutuels and other games of chance year-round.
</P>
<P>
   It's a deal that has brought negotiations for tribal casinos to
the table and thrust the issue into courtrooms around the state.
</P>
<P>
   Now, seven years after the Seminole Tribe of Florida first asked
to open full-blown casinos, maneuvering over the issue is
intensifying:
</P>
<P>
   A tribal proposal is being reviewed by the state.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Trump has teamed up with the tribe to persuade a
stubbornly opposed Gov. Lawton Chiles. In May, Trump forked over a
$50,000 contribution to the Republican Party for safe measure.
</P>
<P>
   National negotiations are set for discussion next month.
</P>
<P>
   And a federal decision that could override the state and grant
casinos is inching forward.
</P>
<P>
   Still, whether the deal holds up or, as state officials hope, a
modern Congress continues to give states a say, remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are part of the equation,'' Florida assistant Attorney
General Jonathan Glogau said. ``And if Congress wants to take us
out of the equation, they can do that. But they haven't seen fit to
do that.''
</P>
<P>
   His nemesis, however, tribal lawyer and Nova University law
professor Bruce Rogow, contends the Constitution, backed by court
rulings, guarantees the promise.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a country built on land stolen from one people by
another people,'' he said. ``As a result, we carry some baggage and
part of our duty is the responsibility owed to the aboriginal
people. And that wrapped up in two words is trust responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   The trust responsibility stems from a Constitutional clause that
put governing of Indian commerce in the hands of Congress. Over the
years it has come to mean questions of law should be resolved in
favor of Indians, or ``sort of a tie in favor of the runner in
baseball,'' Rogow said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of the ultimate Judeo-Christian guilt.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the nation, tribal gambling has become wildly profitable.
In Connecticut, the Mashantucket Pequot tribe opened the largest
casino in the western hemisphere in 1992 and collects as much as $1
million daily. The Mohegan tribe, which opened a nearby casino in
1996, attracts 20,000 gamblers a day. Last year, the Eastern Band
of the Cherokee tribe unveiled an $82 million casino in North
Carolina after striking a partnership with Harrah's Entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Seminoles' business is booming
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, about 125 gambling compacts between states and
tribes have been drawn up, Glogau said.
</P>
<P>
   So, it's no wonder that the Seminole tribe, which has made
millions off high stakes bingo halls, wants to open casinos on land
around the state.
</P>
<P>
   When the Seminole tribe was officially recognized in 1957, it
had a budget of just $12,000. For years, members had been living
off handouts from the government.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in the early 1970s, it began selling tax-free cigarettes
and boosted its income to $4.5 million. Bingo raised the stakes
even higher. In the early 1980s, its 2,500 members each received
monthly payments of about $80. By October of last year,1997, that
jumped to $2,000 a month. For a family of five, that's $10,000 a
month.
</P>
<P>
   The tribe itself, which had a $100 million budget in 1996, has
expanded its holdings to include investments in a Caribbean casino;
a gambling ship, the Seminole Empress; a Tampa hotel; a rope
factory; cattle and Fort Pierce's Micco Aircraft Co., which sells
$150,000 planes.
</P>
<P>
   James Billie, the flamboyant chairman of the tribe for two
decades who uses a fleet of helicopters and planes to fly to the
tribe's six reservations, has estimated casino profits could push
the income to more than $500 million annually.
</P>
<P>
   But the state, as Glogau noted, has steadfastly opposed casinos
by rejecting them three times in voter referendums since 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Until 1988, the tribe had little to argue with. Seven years
earlier it won a landmark Supreme Court decision for bingo halls
that paved the way for tribes around the country. But chances for
full casinos were slim. Then, in 1987, the Supreme Court ruled on a
case pitting California against the Cabazon Band of Mission
Indians. Justices said a state that allows some form of gambling
cannot enforce its gambling laws on tribal lands without permission
from Congress.
</P>
<P>
   That led Congress to the momentous Indian Gaming Regulatory Act
that launched the national war over tribal casinos.
</P>
<P>
   Put simply, the act says if a state fails to negotiate a
gambling compact with a tribe, the tribe can sue and force it into
a deal.
</P>
<P>
   But when the Seminoles tried to sue Florida in 1991, they were
blocked.
</P>
<P>
   The 11th Circuit Court of Appeals said the 11th Amendment that
gives states _ like Indians _ sovereign immunity, prevents such
action. A state cannot be sued unless Congress says it can, judges
said. The tribe appealed to the Supreme Court which upheld the
ruling in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But the appellate court gave the tribe an out that the Supreme
Court refused to address.
</P>
<P>
   The court said the act required the secretary of the Interior to
step in and devise rules for gambling on Indian lands if states
refused to adopt a compact.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the tribe asked Secretary Bruce Babbitt to issue rules.
Babbitt stalled and in 1997 the tribe sued him. The case is pending
in Miami federal court.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the tribe continued operating video slot machines in
some of its casinos, machines that it says provide 90 percent of
its income.
</P>
<P>
   The state argues that these are a form of Class III gambling,
the type that occurs in casinos and is illegal in the state. The
state tried to shut them down in 1996 by filing a suit in Miami
district court. The tribe argued the state had no jurisdiction
because of the tribe's sovereign immunity status and a judge
agreed.
</P>
<P>
   The state is appealing the case to the 11th Circuit Court of
Appeals, which is scheduled to hear oral arguments in October.
</P>
<P>
   Tribe willing to give state high percentage
</P>
<P>
   At the urging of state officials, the U.S. attorney for the
middle district of Florida also sued the tribe last year to stop
the slot machines on its Tampa and Immokalee reservations. That
case also is pending.
</P>
<P>
   So where does that leave tribal gambling in Florida?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still talking, so at least that's something,'' Jim
Shore, general counsel for the tribe, said of negotiations with the
state. ``I can't address too many things while the talks are still
ongoing.'' All I can say is we're still talking and that's
something that's different from the past.''
</P>
<P>
   The tribe's compact calls for casinos at existing gaming halls
in Tampa, Hollywood, Brighton and Immokalee and proposes building
more in Orlando, Jacksonville, Coconut Creek and Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The tribe is willing to give the state 30 percent of the profits
from casinos at existing gaming halls and, as extra incentive, a 45
percent cut from additional casinos the state approves. (The tribe
wants exclusive rights to casino gambling in the state and cannot
build casinos on new land without the governor's consent.)
</P>
<P>
   Trump, who opposed tribal gambling as recently as 1996, has
begun courting Billie, hiring him to perform at his Mar-A-Lago club
in Palm Beach and inviting him to be a judge at his Miss Universe
contest last year, the St. Petersburg Times reported in a critical
series last year questioning tribal spending.
</P>
<P>
   Together, the pair hired lobbyist Mallory Horne, a longtime
friend of the governor, to promote their cause. Horne met with the
governor's staff in June.
</P>
<P>
   Trump also donated $50,000 to the Republican Party and hosted a
fund-raiser at his New York condominium attended by GOP
gubernatorial candidate Jeb Bush. Bush has said he opposes casino
gambling in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Trump, Horne and Billie did not return phone calls. And Shore
won't comment on Trump's participation in negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   But Glogau said Trump's role makes little difference to the
state.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unimportant to us that he's in the picture at all,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   What concerns the state more is Babbitt's stance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The federal government as a general proposition treats Indian
tribes as beneficiaries of a trust and feels their job is to watch
out for tribes,'' Glogau said. ``So, any time we get in a situation
with the federal government, they take the Indian side.'' That's
just the way it is. It's not good or bad. So when we get into a
dispute with the Department of Interior over whether certain types
of gambling are permitted in Florida, we're going to lose and
that's the problem we have with the Secretary of the Interior's
rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``How would you like to go before tribunal where the rule-maker
is (the guardian) for the other party?``
</P>
<P>
   Congress may have to step in between tribe, states
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Chiles sent Babbitt a letter ardently opposing any
rules that would allow gambling. But while rumors fly that Babbitt
will approve rules, his spokeswoman, Stephanie Hanna, said a
yearlong moratorium passed by Congress has left the agency's hands
tied. Rogow has objected to that interpretation in court motions,
saying the moratorium doesn't apply to the tribe's request.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that sort of arcane legal argument that I could
speculate on,'' Hanna said. ``We absolutely can't go forward until
Oct. 1.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the issue of tribal gambling could rest on clearing
up confusion created by the Indian Gambling Regulation Act and
getting Congress to again referee states and tribes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The political situation led Congress to give states a voice,
but it's moral constitutional duty ultimately gave tribes the
federal forum to say the states aren't acting fairly,'' Rogow said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tribes have become very vigilant about protecting their
rights and the states have become very defensive and, of course,
the stakes have gotten a lot higher because of the economics,''
Rogow said. ``But the real problem is the statute was such a mess
that in trying to please everybody, it pleased nobody and I think
that's a lesson of life.''

 &HT;    Officers turn into laptops
 &HT;    By Ian Trontz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ According to Washington, 15 of President
Clinton's army of 100,000 new community police officers are
stationed in Riviera Beach, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   But you won't see them anywhere except on paper.
</P>
<P>
   Three aren't officers at all. They're laptop computers. The way
the government figures it, the time the computers will save each
officer from returning to the police station to write multiple
reports has the effect of putting three new officers on the street.
</P>
<P>
   The other 12 were actual officers to be hired with a $1.3
million federal grant that was to pay their salaries from 1996 to
1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``This grant award approval was one of the best moments in my
20-year career,'' police Chief Jerry Poreba wrote in an effusive
letter to Clinton in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But since then, only six officers have been hired, and two of
those have left, leaving four. And the police department can't hire
the other eight because it can't afford to follow federal grant
rules.
</P>
<P>
   Poreba, 1998: ``Everybody thinks, `It's a grant. Happy days are
here again.' They're not.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Justice Department figures, that it admits may not
be accurate, 24 police and sheriff's departments in Palm Beach,
Martin and St. Lucie counties will have received $14.8 million for
237 new positions by 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But some of the cities that most need the extra officers, like
Riviera Beach, are the ones having the most trouble hiring them.
Both nationwide and locally, about a third of the positions are
actually computers or civilians who count as officers under a
federal formula.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's voodoo math,'' said one local police chief who didn't
want to jeopardize future grant requests by allowing his name to be
used for this story. He said the computers allow his officers to
spend more time away from desks, but that's not the same as having
actual officers.
</P>
<P>
   In his 1992 campaign, Clinton pledged 100,000 new officers
nationwide. In 1994, Congress came through with a landmark
anti-crime bill.
</P>
<P>
   To date, the Justice Department has given grants for 77,212.6
positions. Of those, 53,965 are certified officers. Even more money
is likely to come as the government attempts to reach Clinton's
golden number by 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Under the law, police and sheriff's departments could receive
federal grants that would pay new officers' salaries for three
years; buy equipment, like computers; or pay civilian assistants
for three years. In most cases, localities also had to contribute
at least 25 percent of the cost.
</P>
<P>
   Temporary solution
</P>
<P>
   But local departments have to take full responsibility for
paying the salaries of new officers and civilians after the three
years. They also cannot supplant their existing employees with new
ones, or delay filling vacancies, to lighten the financial burden.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fear a lot of police departments are jumping on the
bandwagon of community policing because the budget is there, and
that once the money dries up, they will go back to traditional
policing,'' said Robert Friedmann, chairman of the criminal justice
department at Georgia State University.
</P>
<P>
   The program's philosophy: If police get to know residents rather
than spend their time answering 911 calls, crime will drop in the
long run.
</P>
<P>
   Most local police and sheriff's departments say they have had no
problems spending the money.
</P>
<P>
   Boynton Beach, for example, hired three community police
officers in 1995 with a $225,000 grant matched by $120,000 of its
own money. Beginning next year, it will pay the entire salaries for
the three, said the department's Mike Munro.
</P>
<P>
   The city has spent another $164,000 in grant money and $55,000
of its own money for laptops and records management software. Under
federal calculations, those are worth 16.4 new officers.
</P>
<P>
   Port St. Lucie has received three grants, worth $1.9 million,
for 25 new officers. It also received $219,000 in 1995 to hire
three civilians _ a duty officer, crime scene technician and crime
prevention coordinator _ which allowed the three officers in those
jobs to join the community police patrol.
</P>
<P>
   The department has put more than $745,000 of its own money
toward the 28 salaries.
</P>
<P>
   But Belle Glade, whose 1997 crime rate was twice the national
average, had to reject a $450,000 grant for six officers in 1996
because it couldn't contribute $150,000 of its own. Nevertheless,
the Justice Department still counts those six officers toward the
100,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've sent them at least two certified letters telling them we
rejected the grant,'' Belle Glade Police Chief Michael Miller said.
``They still send us letters asking for quarterly reports and those
kinds of things. It's a bureaucratic situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department spokesman Kevin Avery said such errors
happen, but are rare.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be as accurate as possible,'' he said. ``We've had
changes in grant advisers for Florida and a few might have fallen
through the cracks.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearby Pahokee, which also exceeds the national crime rate,
hasn't spent its $143,000 grant for two officers because it can't
fill the positions it already has, Sgt. Donna Salvatore said.
</P>
<P>
   `The concept works'
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, Riviera Beach had 104 officers, but by 1996, when it
received its grant, the city council had cut back to 91 positions.
</P>
<P>
   Riviera Beach was supposed to spend $383,000 of its own money
for the 12 new officers, but the Justice Department threw in an
extra $295,000 because the city met the criteria for ``extreme
financial hardship.''
</P>
<P>
   The grant now pays for four officers, including Scott O'Hare,
who spends his shifts visiting residents of crime-plagued apartment
complexes and trailer parks.
</P>
<P>
   O'Hare, a fresh-faced 28, could be the poster boy for community
policing. When he drove into an Avenue J complex on Wednesday,
about two dozen kids ran from the mustard-colored buildings.
</P>
<P>
   They surrounded O'Hare for their weekly dose of ``Junior Police
Officer'' stickers.
</P>
<P>
   He said he visits the complex three times a week, which was
confirmed by Patricia Green, 40, who lives there.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've done a pretty good job controlling the drugs,'' she
said. Dealers, she said, no longer congregate in the parking lot,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concept works,'' O'Hare said. ``We just have to have the
manpower to make it work.''
</P>
<P>
   Last August, because of little growth in the city's tax base,
the council cut another four regular police positions.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the city can't hire the other eight community
police officers Clinton's program would underwrite. That would be
illegal ``supplanting.''
</P>
<P>
   The city asked the Justice Department to waive that rule, but
one year later, no response has arrived. Avery said the request is
``under review'' and could not comment further.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, about $1 million for Riviera Beach remains unspent.
The grant will expire next April, although extensions are common.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Belle Glade accepted a $596,000 three-year grant for
six officers after the Justice Department waived the local
contribution requirement. It did not do the same for the later
$450,000 grant, which the city consequently rejected.
</P>
<P>
   A reduced forceNo money returned?
</P>
<P>
   When the first grant expired this year, the city couldn't afford
to keep the six positions. No one was laid off because the
department had six vacancies on its regular roster from retirements
and resignations. It reduced its force from 49 to the original 43.
</P>
<P>
   Still, those six positions, like the six Belle Glade rejected,
are being counted toward the 100,000, according to Justice
Department statistics.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would like for us to keep the positions, and believe me,
so would I,'' Miller said. ``They weren't happy about it, but it's
a fact of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Avery said only that the Belle Glade case was ``under review.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he was not aware of any cases where the Justice
Department asked cities to return money for violating grant rules.

 &HT;    Commentary: Spreading the work around
 &HT;    By Vicki Marsh Kabat
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ There's great excitement at our house. Let me put
that another way: I am greatly excited. After several years of
part-time and free-lance work, I am back in the workforce full
time.
</P>
<P>
   One might understandably ask, why would someone be excited about
such a change? Longer hours, more responsibilities, more time away
from home and family, and less time to take care of same.
</P>
<P>
   I am not naive about these matters. Nevertheless, I am eager to
begin this next phase of my life. I have been fortunate all these
years to be able to balance my time between children and work. Now,
however, with our eldest son heading off the college, the time has
come for me to increase my take-home ... and I don't mean his dirty
laundry each week.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, I have been readying the home front for this
momentous change in our lifestyle. I took a week between jobs to
put our lives in order. (NOTE TO FILE: Next time, take a month.
Better yet, make sure there is no next time.)
</P>
<P>
   I have sorted through the various piles that have cluttered our
tabletops for the last several months. I have updated the boys'
school memory books, adding all their papers, awards and ribbons
from the last school year _ just days before the new school year. I
have dated and filed enough photographs to fill three bookshelves.
Too bad I don't have three extra bookshelves. I have cleaned our
closets and dressers and under-the-bed boxes.
</P>
<P>
   I even prepared meals and put them in the freezer. Nothing like
whipping up a batch of beef stew and lasagna in 101 degree heat. I
have no doubt we will quickly forget we have this largesse in the
freezer and will discover it years from now in some
undistinguishable cryogenized state.
</P>
<P>
   I have weeded the flower beds, trimmed the hedges and supervised
the painting and cleaning of our garage. I would have done the
latter myself, but I wanted to brush up on my supervisory skills.
Anyway, that's what I told my sons, who seemed to think my
supervisory skills were unparalleled.
</P>
<P>
   I have organized the clothes and shoes in my closet by color,
fabric weight and style. I have purchased a supply of new hosiery.
</P>
<P>
   We had a family meeting and discussed the redistribution of
responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot work all day, come home, fix your dinner, do the
laundry, clean the house and help with homework,'' I began.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why not?'' all three sons asked. My husband wisely remained
quiet.
</P>
<P>
   ``For starters,'' I continued, ``I want each of you to be
responsible for preparing a meal one night of the week. I have
outlined some simple meal plans,'' I said, spreading out my
color-coded menus before them. ``It shouldn't be too hard. Any
questions?''
</P>
<P>
   The three boys and my husband looked at each other silently, as
if to ask, ``Has she gone mad?'' No one spoke.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, our youngest son said, ``I get the night we go to
McDonald's!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nice try. That's not on the list,'' I answered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you going to give us any training?'' one son asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking opening cans and boxes,'' I explained. ``It
doesn't take a lot of expertise, but yes, I'll share with you my
best rip-and-pour techniques.''
</P>
<P>
   More silence. Then our oldest son visibly perked up. ``This
doesn't apply to me, right? I mean, I'm going to college this fall.
I'll be on the meal plan.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Your meal plan until Welcome Week is right here,'' I said,
pointing to the menu cards on the table before us. He sagged.
</P>
<P>
   Another son asked, ``Does cereal count as a meal?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Only for breakfast.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear,'' I said to my husband, who had been noticeably silent,
``comments?
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just wondering if you can buy Hamburger Helper by the
pallet-load,'' he moaned.
</P>
<P>
   As I said, I am greatly excited these days. I want to see if I
can get through a whole week without cooking a single meal.

   Commentary: It's moving day at the hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   By Mark Lane
</P>
<P>
   c. Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   DAYTONA, Fla. _ I've been trucking files over to the new place,
looking around and seeing where they would look right. It's a good
feeling having a big empty place to put your things.
</P>
<P>
   The old place was a mess. Stuff everywhere. No room to move.
Nowhere to unpack if you found something cool to bring home.
</P>
<P>
   The new place is roomy and decorated better. It's in color. The
old place was black and white. I put up new wallpaper. Really
brightened things up.
</P>
<P>
   I like virtual moving day much better than real moving day. No
boxes to schlep around. Fewer orthopedic dangers. You don't have to
bribe friends into carrying things by passing out pizza and beer.
You just swap floppies back and forth.
</P>
<P>
   My computer habits are the technological equivalent of a guy
with a truck on cinder blocks in the lawn out back. The old
computer was powered by an Intel-386 chip, this is the computing
equivalent of a 1973 Dodge Dart. It's now in the closet on cinder
blocks.
</P>
<P>
   The new computer is powered by a 486 chip, the computing
equivalent of a 1989 Honda Accord. It still has lots of miles left
in it. The power-users laugh and want to race, but I pay them no
mind. It gets me where I'm going.
</P>
<P>
   Like any move, this change has sent ripples through my life.
There are no simple moves. Even virtual ones.
</P>
<P>
   It is an iron law in computing, as in automobile ownership, that
one change sends other, less expected ones into motion. And they
all cost.
</P>
<P>
   This move should have stayed strictly on the digital level:
moving files, updating to Windows 95 and seeing if my Magic 8-Ball
program would still run on the new operating system. (``All signs
point to yes.'') But within a week or two the virtual became actual
-- as it will, more often than you think. I was moving furniture
around. I was hefting real boxes. Damn.
</P>
<P>
   In no time, my experiment in deskless living ended.
</P>
<P>
   I have lived without a desk for a couple years now. This has not
been a sacrifice. My desk at work is mostly a compost bin for
paper. I do all my work at the computer next to it. At home, I'm a
mobile typist. I type on the laptop wherever I want. Usually the
kitchen table. Sometimes on the porch. Even outside.
</P>
<P>
   Desks breed paper. You can't be too careful with them.
</P>
<P>
   But with the new computer, the system started breaking down. The
balance was upset.
</P>
<P>
   The new laptop can connect to the Internet. It has to be near
the phone. Soon, it was always at the table. Soon, my daughter was
always at the table, checking e-mail and finding new ways to tie up
the phone. Soon, the food function of the table was lost.
</P>
<P>
   Then, I happened upon a second-hand docking station. You can
plug the whole laptop into it and do all kinds new things. Hook up
a keyboard that wouldn't squish your fingers together. Hook up a
monitor that wouldn't make you squint. More storage. Make sounds.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it was no longer a mobile computer. It needed a place of
its own.
</P>
<P>
   Next thing I knew, I was bolting a desk together from
instructions probably written in a language other than English and
translated word-for-word. (``Starting with screw Shelf Rod onto
Desk Top using the end containing pre-assembled table screw.'')
</P>
<P>
   Bringing in a desk is an extreme step. But a necessary step to
save our eating space. To reclaim dinner from the computer. To keep
crumbs out of the keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase that was merely supposed to replace a broken
computer with a working one, continues to kick into motion a
disquieting number of life changes.
</P>
<P>
   At this pace, before the month is over, I'll shave off my
mustache, get a tattoo, a new passport and a Zip drive. Maybe a
breadmaker and fishbowl with computer interfaces.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder people are scared of technology. It's not the fear of
pushing the wrong button, it's the fear of where the buttons will
push you.
</P>
<P>
   I look at the computer on its new desk at night. It seems
content for now but I wonder what it's planning for me next.

 &HT;    Decades after 'Playboy' heyday, playmate shows off again
 &HT;    By Jeff Houck
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOCA RATON, Fla. _ There are a couple ways you could analyze
DeDe Lind.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe she's a middle-aged former pinup model angling for one
more grab at the glamour and notoriety she enjoyed as Playboy's
August 1967 Playmate.
</P>
<P>
   Or she could be someone who, at age 51, continues to make a
living exhibiting her abundant physical gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Just for fun, let's say it's the latter because, hey, it is a
lot more fun.
</P>
<P>
   That this beach-going, water-skiing, roller-skating, divorced
mother can relaunch her nude modeling career from her Boca Raton
condo at an age when most women are concerned with just keeping
body parts from sagging south, is enough to give aging Baby Boomers
a glimmer of hope. Or a pang of jealousy.
</P>
<P>
   Lind sells _ by mail order _ pictures of herself in skimpy
lingerie or bathing suits or nothing at all. Videos shot in the
Cayman Islands and Key West show her posing and frolicking with her
mixed-breed dog, Tasha. The outfits and frilly lingerie she wears
are also for sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``My whole outlook is that I don't feel age is a big deal,''
says Lind, who has a few wrinkles that betray her years, but whose
tanned, toned body could qualify her as a senior lifeguard on
``Baywatch.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not because I'm afraid of aging . . . I'm just vain,''
she said with a breathy giggle as she sat on the couch in her small
condominium. From her porch you can see a glassy Atlantic Ocean.
Piles of sea shells and pieces of coral collected from shoreline
strolls sit in bowls and trays or on the floor next to the wicker
furniture. She's the portrait of a grown-up beach girl, with her
beaded flip flops, low-cut sarong-style wrap dress and gold sand
dollar medallion hanging on a thin chain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Age is just a number for me,'' she says. Her age doesn't seem
to bother her fans, either.
</P>
<P>
   Lind still has a legion of followers who remember her first
Playboy photo layout. Wearing a pea-green bikini and a yellow bow
in her poofy blond hair, the photos struck a chord, especially with
soldiers overseas in Vietnam who adored her coquettish, homespun
quality. She wasn't glamorous or intimidatingly gorgeous. She was
cute, petite and approachable. (For the record: 34C-22-33. Turn
ons: Water skiing, horseback riding. Turn offs: Phony people.
Ambitions: To be healthy and happy.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up with Playboy, saw it for the first time when I was
about 14 or 15,'' she said. ``I always wanted to be in Playboy.''
</P>
<P>
   After the photos ran, more than 1,600 letters arrived at the
magazine from fans, most of whom begged for autographed pictures.
To this day, that total ranks Lind as one of the magazine's most
popular playmates ever, said Mary O'Connor, longtime personal
secretary and administrative assistant to Playboy publisher Hugh
Hefner.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's as sweet as could be, a girl's girl with a million and
one friends,'' O'Connor said. ``She's a typical Playmate. . . a
real girl next door with the ponytail and braids.''
</P>
<P>
   Playboy wasn't Lind's first modeling job. Discovered by a
photographer at 14 while at a public swimming pool in Burbank,
Calif., she posed for teen magazine covers and acted in commercials
and on The Donna Reed Show, The Rifleman, and Leave It To Beaver.
</P>
<P>
   She got pregnant and married right after graduating from high
school, had a baby at age 19 and was divorced by 20.
</P>
<P>
   A newly minted single mom who had to earn a living, she thought
of posing for Playboy. A photographer had shown pictures of her to
the magazine's editors when she was 17, but when they found out her
age, they told her to come back when she was older.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pretty well developed for my age,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1967, she finally got her shot as the Playmate of the Month.
It wasn't easy _ she had never posed nude before and was shy about
doing so. But the photographer was easy to work with and made the
job easier.
</P>
<P>
   She married again after her 1967 centerfold ran and continued to
pose for occasional layouts and calendars, but her career cooled.
</P>
<P>
   On her 30th birthday, Lind broke down and cried, thinking her
career was over. ``Very few models other than, say, Cheryl Tiegs,
have much of a career after 30 or 35,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She dedicated herself to being a dutiful mother and housewife.
Lind later moved to Florida in 1984, and was divorced again in
1989. She worked as a restaurant hostess for a while, but it wasn't
until about four years ago that modeling re-entered her life.
</P>
<P>
   Lind rediscovered her fans when she was invited with other
Playmates to appear at a convention called Glamourcon (featuring
pinup art, Hollywood actresses and models).
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't believe that after all this time people would pay
for an autograph,'' she said, noting one fan put one of her poses
on his belt buckle. ``It's amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   At one show, a Vietnam vet told the tale of how his barracks
were bombed and half the building was destroyed, but he went back
and retrieved her centerfold, which was torn in half by the blast.
``I offered him another one but he didn't want it,'' she said. ``He
said it brought him good luck.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Bucha, a president of the Congressional Medal of Honor
Society, wrote a few years ago to say that it was her picture that
hung on the wall of his Army company's shelter. ``I can assure you
that many guys were inspired to make it back (to the U.S.) because
of the pictorial.'' Lind framed the letter and displays it proudly.
</P>
<P>
   Lind began selling her old Playboy photos at conventions,
expanding the selection about two years ago when a boyfriend took
some nude shots during a vacation in Cancun. Though the amateur
images don't have the Playboy look, but they're selling well, she
said. A friend set up a page for her on the World Wide Web
(http://www.getup.net/centerfolds) so fans could place orders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to keep shooting until I can't do it anymore,'' she
said. ``You have to keep yourself out there. I love what I do.''

 &HT;    Pratt raising profile of Space Propulsion, Russia ties
 &HT;    By Stephen Pounds
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pratt &AMP; Whitney signaled its plan recently to expand its Space
Propulsion unit and its business alliances in Russia with the
appointment of Richard Whiston to president of space and Russian
operations, a company spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Whiston is vice president and general counsel of Pratt. Doug
North, space propulsion president, and Bob Rosati, Pratt senior
vice president of international business, will report to Whiston,
who will be based at Pratt's headquarters in East Hartford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are bringing him on board because of his expertise in
mergers and acquisitions,'' spokesman Patrick Louden said. ``They
want to make space a core business.''
</P>
<P>
   Pratt's main sources of revenue come from its Large Commercial
Engines and Large Military Engines division. Its rocket business
accounts for about $600 million a year, a pittance of Pratt's total
$7.4 billion, and until two years ago was part of its military
engine unit. Now, it is separate, with Its chemical-systems
operation is based in San Jose, Calif., and its liquid-propulsion
business in northwestern Palm Beach County.
</P>
<P>
   The operation here makes upper-stage rockets and turbopumps for
the space shuttle's main engine. It does research and is developing
a lower-stage rocket with a Russian company. About 800 people are
involved Pratt's space operations in Palm Beach County, accounting
for about $200 million a year in revenue. The company wouldn't say
what impact the new strategy would have locally.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Paul Nisbet of JSA Research said an acquisition strategy
is sound. ``That part of the industry really hasn't participated in
consolidations,'' Nisbet said.''
</P>
<P>
   Pratt &AMP; Whitney is one of five companies that make rocket
engines.
</P>
<P>
   Pratt's parent, United Technologies (NYSE: UTX, $87.44), had
$718 million in cash at the end of the second quarter, so it is
well-positioned to make a purchase.
</P>
<P>
   Because its debt-to-equity ratio _ a barometer of its ability to
add debt to its balance sheet _ is 36 percent, it can afford to
triple it its long-term debt from $1.2 billion to more than $4
billion, Nisbet said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're very well heeled. But it's there their borrowing power
that's enormous,'' Nisbet said.
</P>
<P>
   United Technologies (NYSE: UTX) closed at $87.44, up $2.31 a
share.

 &HT;    Lawsuit will put the judge's ability not to laugh on trial
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ Have you heard about the guy in Clearwater,
Fla. who is suing a topless nightclub because, according to his
story, he suffered whiplash when a dancer unleashed her 60-HH bust
and jumped up and slammed her breasts into the victim's head? He
says it felt like he'd been hit with two cement blocks. Says the
impact just about knocked him out.
</P>
<P>
   The alleged injured party is suing for $15,000 _ that's $7,500
per, right? Can't help wondering, is his attorney going for assault
with deadly weapons?
</P>
<P>
   Although it may sound like it, don't think I'm taking all of
this lightly. Let me make (ITAL)this(END ITAL) politically correct
statement about (ITAL)that(END ITAL): I feel his pain. Well, maybe
not really, but I have put a lot of thought into the unfolding
courtroom drama; like how all involved are going to manage not to
crack (up) under pressure.
</P>
<P>
   First, how is the prosecution going to present its case? ``Your
Honor, we intend to prove beyond any reasonable doubt that the
accused did, with malice and aforethought do bodily harm to my
client.'' Later on, he'll probably introduce a psychologist who
will testify the victim is now unable to lead a normal life based
on an excessive fear of women's chests, hereinafter to be referred
to as 'bustaphobia'.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the problem of introducing the weapon(s) into
evidence. My take on it would be something like: ``Uh, your honor,
the prosecution would like to introduce these, uh...'' (this is
where he rolls his eyes and jerks his head around to indicate the
accused's double-H chest) ``as evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   The disconcerted judge says it will be so noted and routinely
instructs a court official to place the alleged weapons on the
evidence table. Nobody moves. Snickers all around.
</P>
<P>
   Wonder if this will make Court TV? If not, it's a shoo-in for
the Springer show _ particularly if the accused agrees to bare not
only her soul but her weapons as well.
</P>
<P>
   This was too good a story not to share so I called a friend of
mine, a retired judge, to discuss the case. She says it will
probably be a civil suit to be decided by a preponderance of
evidence, ``...which ought not to be much of a problem,'' she
snickers, ``unless the accused wears a pup-tent to court.''
</P>
<P>
   I can't resist asking her what she would have done if the case
had been brought to her courtroom. ``I'm afraid I'd have indulged
in some highly undignified giggles and snorts,'' she laughs, ``and
then I would have suggested the plaintiff wear a batting helmet the
next time he goes bar hopping.'' She hesitates before she adds,
``Really, what is it with
</P>
<P>
   guys anyway?'' I tell her maybe it's because they don't have
library cards. Then I remind her women go to places like that too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, true,'' she agrees, ``and anyway, who are we to judge?''
By way of proving her point she asks what I did last night. I tell
her that Sharon, my sister-in-law-twice-removed (we used to be
married to brothers but now we're not) and I went to a nearby town
to buy toilet seats. This cracks her up and she mutters something
about getting a
</P>
<P>
   life.
</P>
<P>
   I tell her it was coincidence that we both needed new ones at
the same time and assure her we hadn't planned it as a big Friday
night on the town.
</P>
<P>
   ``What'd you do last night?'' I ask in the hope of proving a

A.M. lemon oiling her furniture. I tell her I'm glad her social
life is looking up.

   We call it a draw and get back to the lawsuit. I ask her if she
thinks he'll collect and she says she doubts it. Says the case is
liable to boil down to a definition of terms. I ask how. She
responds with a ladylike chuckle and tells me the whole proceeding
could bog down in a turgid sea of semantics with one lawyer calling
them 'deadly weapons' and the other referring to them as
'attractive nuisances'.

<P>
   The judge's polite titter has erupted into an abandoned guffaw
as she tries to add, ``And how in the hell is anybody going to keep
a straight face?''
</P>

   So much for jurisprudence.

 &HT;    Acting superb in Lifetime's poignant 'Any Day'
 &HT;    By Kevin D. Thompson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TV's a strange business. Just when you think you'll never see a
promising new show again, Lifetime _ yes, Lifetime of all places! _
serves up a potential winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any Day Now'' is a poignant, heartwarming show about race
relations that could easily become the season's best _ and most
intelligent _ drama. It tells the story of two childhood friends
(one white, one black) who grew up in Alabama during the height of
the turbulent civil rights movement.
</P>
<P>
   As they got older, the women, Mary Elizabeth (Annie Potts) and
Rene (Lorraine Toussaint), grew apart and didn't speak for more
than 20 years. While a career-minded Rene left to become a
high-powered, Washington, D.C., attorney, the often-bitter Mary
Elizabeth stayed behind, married her childhood sweetheart and had
three children.
</P>
<P>
   The two are reunited when Rene goes back home after her civil
rights leader dad (a quietly dignified Courtney B. Vance) dies. Now
both women must come to grips with the choices they made in life.
While Mary Elizabeth wonders if she made a mistake by having
children at 19, the driven Rene ponders if she'll ever have a
family.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Elizabeth and Rene also struggle to heal their
relationship, which became strained when Rene didn't support Mary
Elizabeth's pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   Potts and Toussaint are superb as the still ill-at-ease friends.
What a joy to watch two old _ well, they're not so old _ pros work.
One moment they're drinking coffee and catching up on old times,
the next they're remembering the trying days when they hurled
epithets at each other.
</P>
<P>
   We care so much for these multilayered characters because
through telling black-and-white flashbacks, we learn how this taboo
friendship developed. The fact that those flashbacks are set in a
racially divided Birmingham (or Bombingham, as it was called in
those days), makes ``Any Day Now'' more interesting and chillingly
disturbing.
</P>
<P>
   Potts doesn't believe ``Any Day Now'' would work on a major
network. She's probably right. NBC tried in 1991 with ``I'll Fly
Away,'' a well-meaning show about race relations in the South in
the late 1950s. It was canceled after two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to do a show much like this and dealing with the same
issues in `Dangerous Minds','' says Potts, of the axed ABC
inner-city teacher drama. ``And they didn't give it a proper
shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Potts notes that playing Mary Elizabeth is not much of a stretch
for her. She grew up on a farm where a black family lived in a
tenant house. While the husband worked on the farm, the wife was
her family's cook.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up with all of her children,'' she recalls. ``They were
my closest playmates because there wasn't anybody else around. I
was raised by this wonderful black woman, so it was always hard for
me to understand hard feelings between different (races). She
rocked me to sleep every night of my life until I was about 8 years
old.''
</P>
<P>
   Toussaint, a Trinidad native, says she had no reference points
for racism after coming to the United States when she was little.
In fact, Toussaint had never even heard of The Rev. Dr. Martin
Luther King Jr.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember my first experience with Martin Luther King,'' she
remembers. ``It was my sixth birthday, or something, and my mom was
making a birthday cake. She was standing in the kitchen, icing my
cake and she was crying while she was doing it. I went over to her
and said, `Why are you crying?' And she said, `A very important man
was killed today and his name was Martin Luther King.' And I was
just so angry at him. I wanted to know who in the world had enough
power to make my mother cry on my birthday?''
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years later, a powerful drama called ``Any Day Now''
should bring a few tears to your eyes.

   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ With the admission he lied about his
relationship with Monica Lewinsky, President Bill Clinton goes from
lame duck to dead duck. The Clinton presidency is over and the
president would do best to resign and let Vice President Al Gore
start a new slate. (Teepen, Cox News Service) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   KLEINBERG-COLUMN _ Ever so slowly, at a steady but glacier-like
pace, everything seemingly believable becomes unbelievable. Even
the stories that render other stories implausible become
implausible themselves. How many Americans will swear to you that
Elvis is alive? Did Shirley McLaine have anything to do with the
French Revolution? Howard Kleinberg is a former editor of the Miami
News. (Kleinberg, Cox News Service) MOVED MONDAY.
</P>
<P>
   LANE-COLUMN _ DAYTONA, Fla. _ I like virtual moving day much
better than real moving day. No boxes to schlep around. Fewer
orthopedic dangers. You don't have to bribe friends into carrying
things by passing out pizza and beer. You just swap floppies back
and forth. (Lane, Daytona Beach News-Journal) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   KABAT-COLUMN _ WACO, Texas _ I am eager to begin this next phase
of my life. I have been fortunate all these years to be able to
balance my time between children and work. Now, however, with our
eldest son heading off the college, the time has come for me to
increase my take-home ... and I don't mean his dirty laundry each
week. (Kabat, Waco Tribune-Herald) MOVED.

<P>
   SCHUETT-COLUMN _ GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ Have you heard about the guy
in Clearwater, Fla. who is suing a topless nightclub because,
according to his story, he suffered whiplash when a dancer
unleashed her 60-HH bust and jumped up and slammed her breasts into
the victim's head? Although it may sound like it, don't think I'm
taking all of this lightly. Let me make (ITAL)this(END ITAL)
politically correct statement about (ITAL)that(END ITAL): I feel
his pain. (Schuett, Cox News Service) MOVED.

   TGRAHAMBROWN _ Throughout the 1980s, T. Graham Brown was a
rising star in Nashville, churning out Top-10 country hits and
recording duets with the likes of Tanya Tucker. It was a long way
from his frat party days at the University of Georgia, where he got
his start as half of the popular house band Dirk and Tony. But by
the mid-'90s, Brown's world crumbled as he fought declining record
sales and escalating alcoholism. Now Brown's back with a new album

just the kind of programming you'd expect to see on Public Access
Television but never do. ``UCB'' is from a Chicago-bred troupe and

 &HT;    ShortTakes: It's the heavy breathing stuff, stupid
 &HT;    By Arnold Rosenfeld
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The response to Bill Clinton's mea culpa was predictable and
along party lines. The Democrats thought it was good enough. He
said he misled, he was wrong, he was sorry, what more do they want?
Details, the Republicans responded in a nano-second. It isn't
really a confession until Bill gives us the good stuff, like how
the star-crossed lovers Did It.
</P>
<P>
   According to instant CBS polling, the American public was
lenient. OK, can we talk about something else now, huh, please? The
few people I've talked to think Bill could have done without
bringing up his Ken Starr gripes. Knocking Starr while in full mea
culpa degrades the culpa.
</P>
<P>
   As for heavy breathing, if I were Bill and if the Republicans
want details, I'd give them lots. Sort of like this, ``Well, Monica
was at the bookstore and along with an embossed leather and
parchment copy of the poems of Elizabeth Barrett Browning, she got
a Best Parts Version of the Kama Sutra. We started with `Crane
Walks on Misty Lake,' which begins with the woman putting her left
foot on your forehead and ends with the walking part, which is
pretty tough if you're 52. I really started thinking I was doing
the wrong thing morally at Chapter 72, `Muskrat in Bamboo Grove.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I make a solemn pledge to the country that I'll never do that
again. Threw my back out for a week.''

   The Austrians are always celebrating somebody's anniversary,
most often that of a musician or composer. But this year, instead
of Mozart or Schubert, it is Empress Elizabeth, fondly known as
Sissi, who was assassinated 100 years ago at age 61 in Geneva after
a disastrous marriage and tormented life.
</P>
<P>
   Images of the slim, handsome young princess with cascades of
brown hair flowing down her back and a demure smile are all over
Vienna. Elizabeth was 16 when she married her cousin, Emperor Franz
Joseph, in 1854. A Bavarian, she quickly came to dislike the
strictures of court life in the Austro-Hungarian Empire and she
escaped by writing poetry, riding horses and having a villa built
on Corfu.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the salute to the imperial past, Vienna has become a
livelier, more international city in the last few years. The
effects of the opening up of the former Communist bloc can be
subtly felt in the languages spoken in the cafes and on the trams,
and in glimpses of newly affluent Russians who park money here.
</P>
<P>
   Austria, its neutrality maintained since 1955 after the
withdrawal of the four occupying powers, has decided for the moment
against joining NATO. But for the second half of 1998, Austria has
assumed the presidency of the European Union and is flaunting its
adhesion to Western Europe by showing off its revitalized
industries and exports, including its high-quality wine. Vienna has
become a gateway to Eastern Europe with daily flights by Austrian
Airlines to even some of the most out-of-the way cities that nine
years ago were behind the Iron Curtain.
 &UR; EVENTS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The immortal Sissy is at the heart of a three-part exhibit,

table cloths and upholstered chairs, and has an outdoor terrace

   Collio Restaurant, in the Hotel Triest at 12 Wiedner
Hauptstrasse, (43-1) 589-18-133, takes some of its culinary
inspiration from Trieste, which used to serve the Austro-Hungarian
Empire. Designed by Terence Conran, the long room with blue chairs
and metal tabletops extends into the garden, where dinner is also
served until the fall. Lamb tenderloin with olive crust and thyme
sauce is one of the chef's specialties. A meal for two with wine
costs about $95.
</P>

the Dark Star), which is on a small cobbled street at 3-5

fresh parmesan or a pasta with basil cost $8.50. A plate of
cheeses, olives and sun-dried tomatoes was $6; wines by the glass
are $3.45; (43-1) 535-8152. Hours: 1 to 8 p.m.

when the signature dish is boiled beef with creamed string beans
and two sauces: chive and apple horseradish. A meal for two is
about $120, including an Austrian wine.

<P>
   Locals have taken to Do &AMP; Co (pronounced Doe and Coe, after the
name of the owner, Dogotan Attila) in the Haas House, 12
Stephansplatz, (43-1) 535-3969. It is decorated with crisp white
table cloths and upholstered chairs, and has an outdoor terrace
facing St. Stephen's. The menu is international _ a Thai-inspired
crispy pork salad, for example, and there is a sushi bar. Main
courses center on fish (like a tower of roasted Atlantic tuna that
is a specialty), wienerschnitzel and beef. A meal for two, with an
Austrian cabernet sauvignon costs about $130.

<P>
   Collio Restaurant, in the Hotel Triest at 12 Wiedner
Hauptstrasse, (43-1) 589-18-133, takes some of its culinary
inspiration from Trieste, which used to serve the Austro-Hungarian
Empire. Designed by Terence Conran, the long room with blue chairs
and metal tabletops extends into the garden, where dinner is also
served until the fall. Lamb tenderloin with olive crust and thyme
sauce is one of the chef's specialties. A meal for two with wine
costs about $95.

<P>
   A wine bar and wine store are part of Zum Finsteren Stern (To
the Dark Star), which is on a small cobbled street at 3-5
Sterngasse, in the old Jewish quarter. Lunch, informal but
delicious, is prepared on a hot plate, and there is only one dish a
day, from whatever is fresh at the market. A mushroom risotto with
fresh parmesan or a pasta with basil cost $8.50. A plate of
cheeses, olives and sun-dried tomatoes was $6; wines by the glass
are $3.45; (43-1) 535-8152. Hours: 1 to 8 p.m.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    It was the pointed, down-turned nose, the sleek profile and the
sheer speed of the Concorde that impressed everyone 21 years ago.
They still do. So British Airways is marking the 21st birthday of
the aircraft that brought supersonic flight to the well-heeled
masses by declaring 1998 ``The Year of the Concorde.''
 &HT;    ``She is a 21st-century airplane,'' says Capt. Mike Bannister,
flight manager for British Airways' Concorde fleet. ``She looks
like she is a very fast and sophisticated airplane. And as they
say, if it looks right, it probably flies right.''
 &HT;    British Airways currently has seven Concordes, and Air France
has five. In honor of the anniversary, British Airways has mounted
a traveling exhibition called ``Ride the Rocket,'' using the
insider's nickname for the plane. The exhibition will visit all 22
cities served by British Airways this summer and fall, including
Denver, Houston, Dallas, Miami and Los Angeles. Naturally, it
includes a genuine Concorde nose.
 &HT;    A ``Ride the Rocket'' contest in conjunction with the exhibition
offers trips to London on the Concorde as prizes. In addition,
anyone purchasing a ticket on British Airways before Aug. 31 and
completing travel by the end of September is eligible to win one of
the 100 grand prizes of a trip for two on the Concorde and three
nights at a London hotel.
 &HT;    For details, contact British Airways Holidays, 7520 Astoria
Blvd., Jackson Heights, N.Y. 11370; 800-AIRWAYS.
 &HT;    Why all the fuss about a 21-year-old plane? Because nothing has
ever been built that surpasses it. A typical crossing takes about
three hours and 10 minutes, at an average speed of more than 1,000
mph. The plane's current speed record was set by British Airways in
February 1996, covering the distance from New York to London in two
hours, 52 minutes and 59 seconds.
 &HT;    ``Concorde can go at twice the speed of sound for over three
hours with 100 passengers, 10 crew and the best wines and cuisine
in the sky,'' Bannister says. ``You're traveling 23 miles a minute,
yet a coin can be set on edge on the flight deck and won't waver.''
 &HT;    Inside, the Concorde has two-by-two leather bucket seats that
would not be out of place in a sports car, and windows that are
noticeably smaller than those on subsonic aircraft.
 &HT;    Ten to 12 minutes after taking off, the Concorde reaches Mach 1
at about 30,000 feet. Ten minutes later it hits Mach 2, at which
point it is typically above 50,000 feet, eventually reaching a
cruising altitude of about 58,000 feet. It is the closest most
passengers will ever get to seeing what an astronaut sees.
 &HT;    During the flight, the famous Concorde nose heats up to about
250 degrees Fahrenheit. The pilot's view from the cockpit
encompasses a 270-degree arc, which means that Bannister, his
co-pilot and his flight engineer are looking out at a quarter of a
million miles of the Earth's surface.
 &HT;    ``It's a very beautiful aircraft to fly, very responsive and
very powerful,'' Bannister reports. ``It's an agile performer, a
thoroughbred rather than a cart horse, a sports car rather than a
truck. Pilots adore flying it.''
 &HT;    Flying at close to 60,000 feet, the Concorde encounters fewer
problems with weather than a conventional jumbo jet does at 35,000
feet. Bannister explains that ``the weather finishes at around
42,000 feet,'' which means that the Concorde is flying above storms
and turbulence.
 &HT;    Passengers report feeling refreshed when they step off the
plane. It's not just three hours in the air vs. the more
conventional six or seven hours on a trans-Atlantic flight. It's
because Concorde's cabin is pressurized to simulate a more
comfortable altitude of 4,900 to 5,900 feet vs. 7,250 feet on
subsonic long-distance flights.
 &HT;    About 80 percent of the Concorde's passengers are business
travelers _ and about 80 percent of them are repeat travelers.
Speaking of business, Bannister claims that Concorde's numbers
anticipate world business cycles.
 &HT;    ``We have the same shaped curve over the last 10 years as
London's FTSE (Financial Times Stock Exchange) has,'' he says,
``but we go up or down just ahead of it. It's because the folks
we're carrying are the people making major economic decisions.''
 &HT;    They're making money too. The one-way fare on the Concorde is
$5,456, while a round-trip ticket is $9,165. But British Airways
Concorde Vacations offers less-expensive air-hotel packages.
 &HT;    The plane can also be booked in conjunction with a
trans-Atlantic crossing on the Queen Elizabeth II. For passengers
in either Queens Grill or Princess Grill class, an upgrade to
return on the Concorde is $495. For passengers traveling in the
Caronia Grill, it's $795. And for those in the Mauritania Grill,
the upgrade runs $1,295.
 &HT;    For more information, contact Cunard, 6100 Blue Lagoon Drive,
Miami, Fla., 33126; (800) 221-4770.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Getting your shots when preparing for an overseas trip is no
one's idea of fun _ but it's a necessity. Now travelers have a
streamlined way to find out what shots they need, thanks to a
computerized information service that reduces the usual time, cost
and hassle.
 &HT;    That service is Travax, which derives its information from the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta and other
data bases, refining it and updating it weekly for public use.
 &HT;    About 1,000 outlets subscribe to Travax, including companies
that underwrite major travel, travel clinics, student health
offices, health maintenance organizations and city, county and
state public health offices.
 &HT;    Dr. Bradley Connor, a gastroenterologist who is affiliated with
the International Society of Travel Medicine in New York and on the
board of Travax, became interested in travel medicine about a
decade ago when he noticed more and more travelers returning home
with diseases that could have been prevented.
 &HT;    It was a major quandary in those days, Connor explained, for
travelers to find reliable and noncontradictory health information
about their travel destinations. Travax now digests existing
information and distills it so that it's easy to understand and
use.
 &HT;    We made use of Travax through our county health department,
which subscribes to the service. We visited it in preparation for
travel to Greece and Thailand. Like many county health departments
across America, ours offers an immunization clinic for travelers
headed overseas.
 &HT;    We started out by listing the countries we would visit and
approximate dates. We were quoted a consultation fee of $25 for
two. Any necessary shots would cost extra.
 &HT;    A registered nurse supplied us with information for each
destination, ranging from general health precautions to
drug-violation penalties. For both countries we were provided with
information on risk and prevention for diseases such as hepatitis,
polio, rabies, typhoid, cholera, encephalitis and malaria.
 IMMUNIZATIONS WEAR OFF  
 &HT;    Since our hepatitis B immunizations were current, we
concentrated on hepatitis A, typhoid, malaria and polio. We were
surprised to learn that we, like many other mature travelers, had
neglected to get booster shots for polio, a disease that was so
rampant during our childhood years. As a result, some seniors
contract polio during their travels because their immunizations
have worn off.
 &HT;    Protection against malaria was a bit more complicated in terms
of the types of medicines, areas of the countries we would be
visiting and whether mosquitoes in those areas had built up
resistance to the medicines _ information we would not have been
able to sort out by ourselves. The nurse recommended that we see
our own doctor about the anti-malaria choices, since we were taking
other medications.
 &HT;    Less than half an hour later, we were on our way, our arms
stinging from the shots, and carrying handy yellow cards that fit
into our passports listing our vaccinations.
 &HT;    Our county office averages some 2,000 clients a year, according
to Steve Kutz, supervisor of our county's travel vaccinations
program.
 &HT;    In the wake of Connor's initial concern about travel diseases a
decade ago, there are now more than 1,500 members of the
International Society of Travel Medicine, including 500 clinics,
300 in the United States alone, specializing in travel medicine.
 &HT;    Some Travax subscribers cover large areas. For example, one
subscriber is the South Carolina Health Department, so the
information is available at any of South Carolina's 46 county
offices.
 LOCATING INFORMATION  
 &HT;    To help you or your doctor locate a reliable travel information
source near you, write the International Society of Travel Medicine
for a free list of travel medicine clinics. The address is P.O. Box
871089, Stone Mountain, Ga., 30087-0028.
 &HT;    Travax offers an Internet Web site at www.tripprep.com/, as does
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention at www.cdc.gov/. The
centers can also be called at their international travelers
hotline: (404) 332-4559.

travelers to find reliable and noncontradictory health information
about their travel destinations. Travax now digests existing
information and distills it so that it's easy to understand and
use.
 &HT;    We made use of Travax through our county health department,
which subscribes to the service. We visited it in preparation for
travel to Greece and Thailand. Like many county health departments
across America, ours offers an immunization clinic for travelers
headed overseas.
 &HT;    We started out by listing the countries we would visit and
approximate dates. We were quoted a consultation fee of $25 for
two. Any necessary shots would cost extra.
 &HT;    A registered nurse supplied us with information for each
destination, ranging from general health precautions to
drug-violation penalties. For both countries we were provided with
information on risk and prevention for diseases such as hepatitis,
polio, rabies, typhoid, cholera, encephalitis and malaria.
 IMMUNIZATIONS WEAR OFF  
 &HT;    Since our hepatitis B immunizations were current, we
concentrated on hepatitis A, typhoid, malaria and polio. We were
surprised to learn that we, like many other mature travelers, had
neglected to get booster shots for polio, a disease that was so
rampant during our childhood years. As a result, some seniors
contract polio during their travels because their immunizations
have worn off.
 &HT;    Protection against malaria was a bit more complicated in terms
of the types of medicines, areas of the countries we would be
visiting and whether mosquitoes in those areas had built up
resistance to the medicines _ information we would not have been
able to sort out by ourselves. The nurse recommended that we see
our own doctor about the anti-malaria choices, since we were taking
other medications.
 &HT;    Less than half an hour later, we were on our way, our arms
stinging from the shots, and carrying handy yellow cards that fit
into our passports listing our vaccinations.
 &HT;    Our county office averages some 2,000 clients a year, according
to Steve Kutz, supervisor of our county's travel vaccinations
program.
 &HT;    In the wake of Connor's initial concern about travel diseases a
decade ago, there are now more than 1,500 members of the
International Society of Travel Medicine, including 500 clinics,
300 in the United States alone, specializing in travel medicine.
 &HT;    Some Travax subscribers cover large areas. For example, one
subscriber is the South Carolina Health Department, so the
information is available at any of South Carolina's 46 county
offices.
 LOCATING INFORMATION  
 &HT;    To help you or your doctor locate a reliable travel information
source near you, write the International Society of Travel Medicine
for a free list of travel medicine clinics. The address is P.O. Box
871089, Stone Mountain, Ga., 30087-0028.

THE SKY IS FALLING ON THE SOARING YANKEES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEVE CAMPBELL  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The old cathedral on 161st and River has outlived its
usefulness. Hallowed grounds or not, the place should be condemned.
We know this because the proprietor, George Steinbrenner, is
helpful enough to point out to potential paying customers the
perils of taking in a baseball game at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Bronx neighborhood once deemed worthy of constructing a
showcase house for Babe Ruth has succumbed to urban decay. On a
good day, as Steinbrenner can and does attest, traffic to and from
the games speeds to a crawl. Yankee Stadium is a prisoner of its
proud past, out of date and unequipped to offer even the most
modest amenities of the modern ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   Namely, not crumbling to quarter-ton pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a week before Yankee Stadium celebrated its 75th
birthday, a 500-pound steel joint fell through the underside of the
upper deck and crash-landed onto some mercifully empty seats. To
paraphrase old Yankees philosopher Yogi Berra: If people don't want
to come to such a place, then nobody is going to stop them from not
coming. Berra stopped coming to Yankee Stadium after he got fired
as manager in 1985. He is one of the few, the stubborn, who can
resist the pull of venturing in for a firsthand look at the Yankees
team to beat all Yankees teams.
</P>
<P>
   Last Wednesday, 47,841 paying customers flocked to see the
Yankees pound the Minnesota Twins into submission. The next day,
53,835 paid to see the Yankees feast on fresh meat _ the Texas
Rangers. Then, 46,547 watched the Yankees have the Rangers for
seconds. On Saturday, 53,117 showed up expecting yet another course
of Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would have to be living in a flour sack,'' Yankees manager
Joe Torre mused, ``not to know something special is going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Yankee Stadium is where the Babe became larger than life. Yankee
Stadium is where Lou Gehrig confronted death and declared himself a
lucky man. Yankee Stadium is where Joe DiMaggio and Mickey Mantle
roamed center field, where Don Larsen set down 27 Brooklyn Dodgers
in a row, where Reggie Jackson went deep on back-to-back-to-back
World Series swings, where Wade Boggs did victory laps on a police
horse. Yankee Stadium is getting up in years, and it may not be as
spry and sturdy as it used to be, but has it ever seen better days
than the ones that keep unfolding this season?
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 Yankees have it in their power _ not to mention their
pitching, their defense, their situational hitting, their
baserunning _ to establish themselves as a team for forever. They
passed the 2-million mark in attendance Saturday. By season's end,
more than 3 million fans will have ventured to the old cathedral by
the Harlem River. Not once, not with Murderer's Row, not with Roger
Maris hitting 61 homers in a season, not during any of their 23
world championship seasons, have the Yankees drawn 3 million fans.
Such is the pull of a team so dogged, so persistent, so
professional in its pursuit of excellence.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers manager Johnny Oates meant it as a compliment when he
said recently that the Yankees are not an overwhelming team to look
at, that their whole far exceeds the sum of their parts. The
Yankees have set the time-honored tradition of approaching a
baseball season like a marathon on its ears, running an entire
pennant race at full sprint. They are running at such a brisk pace,
they could stumble, fall and still have time to get to the finish
line faster than any team in history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we've got a whole lot of superstars,'' Yankees
pitcher David Wells said. ``I don't think anybody wants that title.
We're one big family. We enjoy coming to the ballpark. There's no
tension, no self-centered guys. We're just going out and having a
good time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everywhere we go, we're going to be the favorites,'' Torre
said. ``But that's fine. I think when you play in New York,
everybody expects you win. They don't care what anybody else says
anywhere. There's always pressure. I think saying, `Oh, there's no
pressure,' is nuts. It's just what you do in the face of pressure.
Pressure is what you make of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Expect nothing less than the Yankees to make the pressure work
for them. A team that can turn a tattered old cathedral on 161st
and River into the trendiest spot in New York is capable of
anything.

DEATH PENALTY: TOO HIGH A PRICE TO PAY? 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Gary Evans saved Ken Bruno from a tough decision.
Bruno was pondering whether to try to kill the guy.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Evans broke away from federal marshals, took a
spectacular header off a high bridge over the Hudson River and
rendered the question moot immediately upon impact with the rocky
shoreline.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the question deserves exploration. Evans was a career
criminal who'd admitted to five murders. Last week, Bruno, the
Rensselaer County district attorney, had moved to prosecute Evans
for the murder of one Timothy Rysedorph, another lowlife who'd
known about some of Evans' crimes. Bruno was still weighing whether
to ask for the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   According to the polls, four in five New Yorkers favor capital
punishment, which is why the Legislature reinstated it shortly
after the election of Republican Gov. George Pataki four years ago.
Certainly, nobody could disagree that Gary Evans was sort of a
poster boy for the death penalty. A life of crime capped by at
least five murders. You don't come across a guy like that every
day.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Evans would never see daylight for as long as
he lived. Sticking a needle full of poison in his arm would cost a
ton of money _ vastly more than simply keeping him locked up until
he shuffled off this mortal coil to explain himself to a higher
power than Ken Bruno.
</P>
<P>
   Which was, in fact, why Evans kicked out the window of a
transport van and took his swan dive off that bridge. Years in
prison appealed to him less than a quick death. There may be a
lesson in that.
</P>
<P>
   How many other bad guys would have been permitted to plea
bargain to minor offenses because the Rensselaer County District
Attorney's office and the State of New York were spending big bucks
to execute a guy who would never again be in a position to hurt
anybody? How many of those bad guys would end up back on the street
sooner than they should have, doing violence to innocent people,
because of money?
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, none. But society has a budget for this sort of thing.
That's the real world. And death penalty cases are spectacular
budget-busters compared to simply keeping a dirtbag like Evans
locked up until he offs himself or dies on his own.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how it works:
</P>
<P>
   It costs roughly $28,000 a year to keep an inmate in a cage in
the New York state prison system. Evans was in his early 40s. New
Yorkers would have spent $1.26 million if he'd been kept behind
bars for 45 more years.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the state would have had to pay for some appeals for him,
but that wouldn't have amounted to more than a few hundred thousand
dollars, tops. The legal system permits appeals in non-capital
cases, but it's vastly more generous in permitting and financing
appeals in death penalty cases. That's because the consequences of
mistakes in cases like that are enormous. New York has executed
more than 200 people in this century, and decent evidence turned up
after the fact that as many as eight of them were innocent.
</P>
<P>
   But if Evans had gone on death row, with extremely tight
security, New York would have spent not $28,000 a year to keep him
caged up but many times that figure. He would have been there a
minimum of 10 years. And paying for lawyers to defend him at trial
and to handle his appeals would have run into the millions.
</P>
<P>
   Texas spends almost $2.5 million to execute just one guy.
Florida spends more than $3 million. New York has one guy on death
row now, but the state has executed nobody yet. The best estimates
of the cost of doing that in New York approach $4 million.
</P>
<P>
   For some killers _ a Timothy McVeigh, for example, who killed
168 people, some of them babies, in a strike at the very heart of
our democracy _ money shouldn't be a factor. But for a Gary Evans?
</P>
<P>
   Letting him rot would have made more sense.
</P>

   DRUZHNY, Belarus _ This forlorn town, with its crumbling
apartment blocks and almost treeless landscape, looks more like the
site of a nuclear accident, not a refugee for people who lived
through one.
</P>
<P>
   But here, far from the fallout of the world's worst nuclear
accident, is where Soviet authorities 12 years ago decided to
relocate about 1,000 men, women and children from Chernobyl, in
neighboring Ukraine -- where the world's worst nuclear accident
occurred.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Druzhny was what passed for a newly built Soviet
development town. About an hour's drive southeast of Minsk, the
capital, it was not a community, merely a collection of hastily
erected apartment buildings and paved roads to accommodate the
proletariat.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the buildings are run-down, the roads are Swiss cheese
and the survivors are virtually forgotten. But the problems live
on, especially for the maturing children of Chernobyl, who have
grown up sick and face an adulthood of fear.
</P>
<P>
   The wretched post-Soviet economy of Belarus means that most are
unable to find jobs. Needed medicines are difficult to obtain,
wildly expensive or both as the state-run health care system
sputters. Latent maladies from radiation exposure materialize like
haunting nightmares.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people who came from Chernobyl just say, 'To hell
with our problems. Let it be. Let's just finishing living this
miserable life,''' says Elena Butkovskaya, 43, who lost her husband
to a brain tumor last year and worries about her 17-year-old son,
Andrei, who has developed an untreatable heart condition and
respiratory problems.
</P>
<P>
   But Butkovskaya, a woman with close-cropped, thinning hair and
sunken eyes, will not let it be.
</P>
<P>
   She has made it a mission to improve life in Druzhny, primarily
through her work with the non-profit Belarusian Fund for the
Children of Chernobyl.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the accident in 1986 more than 2 million
Belarusians were exposed to high levels of radiation, with only a
belated warning and action from the Soviet government. Thousands
were relocated from an wide evacuation zone around the plant, 2,000
square miles in Ukraine and Belarus tainted by nuclear
contamination and closed to humans.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, cancers, congenital malformations and other medical
problems plagued the survivors.
</P>
<P>
   The people of Druzhny have only a small, ill-equipped infirmary
to provide care. Tiles are peeling off the walls. The concrete
floors are bare.
</P>
<P>
   The emotional fallout is difficult, too.
</P>
<P>
   In more than one case in Druzhny, there have been distressing
family squabbles over budding love, a unique type of post-Soviet,
nuclear-age Romeo and Juliet story: He is from Belarus. She is from
Chernobyl. Their families are against the marriage and plagued by
questions of whether she can bear children, whether he will be
happy if she cannot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who wants a wife who already has had an operation and cannot
have children and will have to take drugs all her life?'' says
Butkovskaya.
</P>
<P>
   For her son Andrei, the prospects are dim. His health problems
forced him to abandon his studies for now. His job prospects are
dismal even with a college degree.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, there were plans to build a nuclear power plant next
to the town. The nuclear power plant never came, but neither did
the jobs it would have provided.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people had very good jobs and good salaries working at
Chernobyl and they wanted the money no matter what the risks,''
Butkovskaya says. ``But we live for our children and our
grandchildren. From my point of view, it would be better to light
candles and ride a horse than to live with the dangers and
psychological problems of living next to a nuclear power plant.''

CLINTON LEGACY: SEX, LIES AND BROKEN PROMISES 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Bill Clinton wants to know what his legacy will
be. Here's one of Bill Clinton's legacies.
</P>
<P>
   Frances Moreau, 8, will remember that the first time she was
interviewed by reporters was after President Clinton's speech
admitting he lied about his affair with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   It was at the Washington Square Bar &AMP; Grill, where her dad Rob
Moreau and dozens of diners and passersby gathered to watch the
unprecedented presidential address. Their hoots, jokes and distress
were observed by a television news crew, a still-news photographer
and a columnist in what you might fittingly call a media regress.
</P>
<P>
   When I asked young Frances what she told the TV news crew, she
tightened her jaw and said, ``Nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Good idea, I said. Don't get caught in this mess.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe in 20 years young adults of Frances' generation will
marvel at the idiocy of these times, the way we marveled at the
idiocy of the McCarthy era we called childhood. Unfortunately, it
looks like Ken Starr will still be special prosecutor, and Clinton
will be in some court or other.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone I talked to expressed a desire for our long national
Penthouse Forum to end.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tawdry,'' said retired public-relations woman Pat Umberger,
condemning everybody involved. ``What would your mother have said
about this?''
</P>
<P>
   Flight attendant Dana Davis said, ``The only thought I have is
how someone so intelligent is dumb enough to get caught doing this.
I guess when you have that much power you think you can do
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of Clinton's very short speech, Umberger was saying,
``He's good. He's really good.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, he's good all right,'' Davis said with a strong note of
sarcasm.
</P>
<P>
   We all want to ``get on with our national life,'' as Clinton
said in his forced fess-up, but our national life still seems to
revolve around Clinton's so-called private life.
</P>
<P>
   Whether we love him or hate him, we're his co-dependents.
</P>
<P>
   You want a Clinton legacy? Whatever happens in the rest of his
presidency, Monday night's speech, no matter what you thought of
it, will be replayed throughout Frances Moreau's life.
</P>
<P>
   Her dad, Rob Moreau, said, ``I thought it was one of the best
speeches I've ever heard.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was aimed at a fifth-grade intelligence,'' said
pianist Chris Huson. ``He said it was wrong, but he didn't say what
`it' referred to.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now, reporters are scouring the nation, trying to find
someone who doesn't know what ``it'' referred to, and the only
people we can find are 8 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Republicans are moving the goal line. Sen. Orrin
Hatch, R-Utah, who just two days ago offered forgiveness to Clinton
if he fessed up, advanced the national dialogue after the speech by
saying, ``Wasn't that pathetic? I tell you, what a jerk.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are from Venus. Republicans are from Mars. Clinton
admitted adultery and lying (well, not in so many words, but in
weasel-speak) and the Mars-like Republicans loosed the hounds of
Hades on him.
</P>
<P>
   The glorious baby boom wasn't supposed to come to such an
adults-only thud.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton and I are the same age, and neither of us expected
our lifelong ambitions to come out like this. He wanted to be
another John F. Kennedy, and he achieved that ambition in quite the
wrong way.
</P>
<P>
   I wanted to write, but never expected to be writing about this.
That speech was clench-jawed braggadocio. He seemed to be saying,
``Yeah, I did it, now let's get on to the important business of
beating up on the special prosecutor and the vast right-wing
conspiracy.''
</P>
<P>
   What he literally said at the end was pap about getting on to
``the promise of the next American century.''
</P>
<P>
   Hey, wasn't there some kind of promise broken right here in this
century?
</P>
<P>
   When I was in elementary school, all I knew of the president was
that he was to be honored, no matter who the president was. He was
a guy in my Weekly Reader. The host of the kids show I watched
toasted him with milk.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere in between then and now, John Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson
and Richard Nixon happened, and made baby boomers what we are
today. We elected Bill Clinton, and he is us.
</P>
<P>
   Well, he is some of us. His inner child seems to keep saying,
``I get to.''
</P>
<P>
   And what he gets to do isn't even the kind of free love where no
one is supposed to get hurt. Everyone's hurt _ Hillary, Chelsea,
Monica and all the rest of America. There's no such thing as free
love, or a cheap, inappropriate relationship. It's $40 million love
in special-prosecutor costs alone. But Ken Starr started it, as
Clinton kept saying throughout his speech.
</P>
<P>
   Look, I want this to be over so the nation can move on to lying
and adultery as usual, but I've been looking at the text of
Clinton's short speech, and I do not see the phrase ``I'm sorry''
or ``I lied.''
</P>
<P>
   All I see are things such as ``false impression,'' ``not
appropriate'' and ``critical lapse in judgment.'' All I see is the
language to which nothing sticks, Tefloglossia.
</P>
<P>
   What was that mealy-mouthed boy talking about?

   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Even before President Clinton admitted Monday
that he had a ``personal relationship'' with Monica Lewinsky, polls
showed the majority of Americans believed that the president had
been less than forthcoming about his ties with the former White
House intern. And now along comes a wristwatch with an opinion on
the subject. The quartz timekeeper, from Seattle's Worldwide Watch
Co., features a caricature of Clinton against an American-flag
backdrop. Under-the-dial animation produces the effect of Clinton's
nose tripling in length every 10 seconds, after which it returns to
normal size and grows again. Although the $30 Clinton Nose Growing
Watch won't be in stores until the end of the year, it is available
now by calling 800-535-0131 or visiting a site on the World Wide
Web, http://www.worldwidewatch.com.

   The Bald Is Beautiful convention will be held Sept. 11-13 in
Morehead City, N.C. The affair is the 25th such annual gathering
and is thus dubbed the Silver Dome Anniversary for the Bald-Headed
Men of America club. Lacking hair apparently inclines one toward
jokey statements such as the following, contained in the convention
announcement: ``Ours is the only organization that grows because of
lack of growth,'' and ``Morehead City _ where Morehead definitely
means `less hair.''' Last year's convention attracted 200 men (and
a few women). Of the 40 million baldies in the nation, half are
baby boomers who are at or approaching age 50. To make a
reservation, call the club at 252-726-1855 or call the Morehead
City Hampton Inn directly at 252-240-2300 and ask for the special
``bald'' rate.

   ALBANY, N.Y. _ RSTLNE.
</P>
<P>
   That is not a typo, or a word, but a mantra, the code for
success.
</P>
<P>
   RSTLNE.
</P>
<P>
   It is the secret that unlocks the mysteries of the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   Over and over Marita Brown and Marquerite Alexander had the
lesson ingrained. ``We had a coach who drilled us,'' Brown said.
Mom, Marvella Brown, was the coach, tougher than any other in her
single-mindedness.
</P>
<P>
   RSTLNE.
</P>
<P>
   Brown and Alexander, sisters, twin sisters at that, studied
hard. They learned the letters, earned a trip to Pittsburgh and the
right to hear those three intoxicating words shouted:
</P>
<P>
   ``Wheel ... of ... Fortune.''
</P>
<P>
   Those five consonants and a vowel are what the 39-year-old
Albany women say are key to solving the program's puzzles: call out
those six letters to start, then there is a good chance you are on
your way to winning the game.
</P>
<P>
   Both avid fans of the show, they competed as teammates in a
regional audition in May in Boston. They were selected as part of
``Wheel's'' AFL-CIO ``Salute to America's Working Families Week,''
featuring contestants from various AFL-CIO unions. Alexander is a
member of the Civil Service Employees Association, while Brown,
because of a job promotion, is a former member.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wheel of Fortune'' is now entering its 16th year, started when
Merv Griffin presciently determined an expanded version of the
kids' game hangman would translate well to television. From those
roots grew a syndicated monster now seen around the world (prizes
and riddles are tailored to individual countries).
</P>
<P>
   While host Pat Sajak briefly left the show for his ill-fated
late-night talk fare (``The Pat Sajak Show,'' CBS, 1989-90), he
will be taping the 3,000th ``Wheel'' episode sometime this season.
</P>
<P>
   The genius is the game's simplicity; it requires some knowledge,
but not a reservoir of minutiae like ``Jeopardy!''
</P>
<P>
   The two sisters, who took part in a taping earlier this month,
have a couple of insider insights:
</P>
<P>
   1. The wheel is actually very heavy and hard to spin.
</P>
<P>
   2. Contestants look the same height because they stand on risers
that can be raised or lowered.
</P>
<P>
   3. The players are under constant surveillance from the moment
they enter the venue for the competition. Game shows are still
leery of the scandals that plagued the industry in decades past.
</P>
<P>
   4. A week's worth of five episodes are taped in one day.
Contestants are grouped into three teams, and then each group draws
numbered balls to determine in what order they will appear. For
example, drawing one means you go first with your show airing on a
Monday. The shows are taped in order.
</P>
<P>
   The twin sisters said Sajak and letter-turner Vanna White (who
now merely has to touch a monitor for a letter to show up) were
surprisingly genuine.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were very approachable, very approachable,'' Brown said.
``They responded to every little detail.''
</P>
<P>
   The obvious question _ with side-bet potential is: How did they
do?
</P>
<P>
   Watch the Thursday, Sept. 10, episode (check local listings),
the sisters say. The rules specifically state contestants can't
talk about results until after the show airs. But you can be
guaranteed one thing: Neither lacks in the enthusiasm department.

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: 10 years later, Moscow is meaner
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ On the way into Moscow from the airport, my old friend
and interpreter Pavlik was telling me how much things had changed.
</P>
<P>
   Lots of crime in Moscow now, he said. But not to worry.
</P>
<P>
   Pavlik spoke to our driver in Russian. The driver moved his hand
to the edge of his suit coat.
</P>
<P>
   One moment his hand was empty. The next moment, a black
automatic pistol filled his hand.
</P>
<P>
   The driver smiled from behind his aviator-style sunglasses. I
shivered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Old Russians carry pistols to protect themselves from this new
democracy,'' he said, as Pavlik translated. He moved his gun hand
up to his neck. ``We are up to here with democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   The driver, I'm told, had served as a military officer with the
Red Army in Afghanistan. He is no longer a Red _ more of a redneck.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not for show that he carries a pistol. Such a weapon is
required to hold your own in Moscow traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Think of it as Russian-roulette road rage.
</P>
<P>
   You pull out in front of the wrong guy _ what they call a steep
guy _ and you can pay a steep price.
</P>
<P>
   Steep means something like macho, only more so. It's a
brotherhood. Wise guy, in the Mafia sense, probably comes close.
</P>
<P>
   These are the junior-grade gangsters driving fancy Western cars,
wearing expensive suits and dripping with heavy gold jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   They'll curb you at the slightest provocation. At the very least
they'll curse you and humiliate you. They're likely to demand money
as payment for getting in their way. You say the wrong thing _ or
just anything _ and they'll beat you senseless.
</P>
<P>
   It's not for nothing that kick-boxing is one of Russia's most
popular sports among young people. It serves as training for steep
wannabes.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what the little kids dream of,'' Pavlik said. ``It's
their ticket to a life of luxury cars, long-legged girls and
casinos.''
</P>
<P>
   And guns.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, when I first visited Moscow, crimes involving
firearms were rare. Now it's everyday news _ contract murders, bar
shootouts, innocent bystanders killed by stray bullets.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that the law requires that you obtain a license from
police before you can buy a pistol. Even then you are allowed to
keep it only in your home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within a few hours on the street market you can have a
pistol,'' Pavlik said. ``Probably 70 percent of the guns in Moscow
are illegal.''
</P>
<P>
   It's like most everything else in Moscow nowadays. Money works.
Laws do not.
</P>
<P>
   Every business from flower shops to supermarkets pays for
protection. In a word, it's krysha. In Russian that means roof. You
pay for a roof over your head _ protection.
</P>
<P>
   Not that all of Russia is like Moscow. It never has been, it
never will be. The old rule still applies:
</P>
<P>
   You go 100 kilometers from Moscow, and you go 10 years back in
time; 1,000 kms, 20 years; 5,000 kms, 100 years.
</P>
<P>
   Later that same day, when we no longer had the services of our
gunman driver, I came face to face with modern Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   We had hitched a ride. Amazing that you can still do that here.
You stand at the corner, raise your hand as you would in hailing a
cab, and in a minute or two a driver will stop to see where you're
going. For a couple of bucks, he'll take you.
</P>
<P>
   This was an old fellow in a beat-up old car. Probably he wasn't
that good of a driver. All of a sudden we found ourselves pulled
over to the curb by a steep guy in a new Mercedes.
</P>
<P>
   We spent the next couple of minutes being screamed at. Nobody in
our car said a word. Our driver went pale. Probably I did, too.
Finally the Mercedes drove off.
</P>
<P>
   I asked Pavlik what was said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, 'Are you looking for trouble, goat?'''
</P>
<P>
   Goat?
</P>
<P>
   ``Goat is gangster slang,'' Pavlik said. ``It means a passive
homosexual. It is an insult to kill over.''
</P>
<P>
   Good grief. Where's the KGB when you need them?

RESEARCHERS SAY HORNBILLS HELP RESEED RAIN FORESTS
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.) 
 By LARRY D. HATFIELD  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ It has a raucous call, massive bill and huge
wingspan and until recently it was thought to be a sedentary
stay-at-home creature. But scientists now say the hornbill may be
the key to saving the vanishing tropical rain forests in western
and central Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, saving the rain forests may also determine whether
the magnificent fruit-loving bird itself survives.
</P>
<P>
   Biologists at San Francisco State University and the University
of California at Davis have discovered that the toucan-like birds
play an elemental role in reseeding the rain forests.
</P>
<P>
   A three-year study in a remote Cameroon rain forest showed that
the hornbill flies 100 miles or more when foraging for ripening
fruit, in the process dispersing seeds _ through its droppings _
for nearly a quarter of the 59 species of trees in the forest.
</P>
<P>
   Until the California study, it was thought the hornbill was
relatively sedentary, confining its activities to small patches of
forest and playing a relatively unimportant role in reseeding.
</P>
<P>
   As other important seed disperers such as elephants and primates
continue to fall prey to hunters and habitat destruction, hornbills
become even more important for rain forest regrowth and survival,
the research team said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cameroon study found that nearly all the seeds dispersed by
the wandering hornbills germinate successfully, making them one of
the prime agents of lowland rain-forest regeneration.
</P>
<P>
   ``The survival of the rain forest appears to rely to a large
degree on the hornbills' ability to disperse seeds of so many
species,'' said Thomas Smith, an associate professor of biology at
San Francisco State and an author of two scientific papers on the
Cameroon study.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we have any hope of protecting rain forests, we need to
protect not just the pattern of biodiversity but also the processes
that create it,'' Smith said. ``Our work suggests that by
dispersing seeds, these magnificent birds are vital agents of
biodiversity.''
</P>
<P>
   The biologists said that to save rain forests, it is necessary
to save the hornbill, and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   ``The birds' surprisingly large range suggests that their own
survival depends on preserving large expanses of rain forest
intact,'' said Smith, who also is an associate professor at the
Center for Population Biology at Davis.
</P>
<P>
   The study, reported in the current issues of the Journal of
Tropical Ecology and Animal Conservation, found that two hornbill
species actively soar across gaps in the forest in search of ripe
fruit. A third species is sedentary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monkeys and elephants aren't as good as moving across gaps in
the forest,'' said Smith, ``so hornbills likely provide a crucial
first step in forest regeneration, particularly in regions that
have been cleared.''
</P>
<P>
   The study was the first to document the hornbills' surprisingly
large range and the extraordinarily high numbers of plants for
which they disperse seeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hornbills were thought to live in relatively confined rain
forest habitats,'' said Ken Whitney, a doctoral candidate at Davis
who led the seed-dispersal studies as a San Francisco State
graduate student. ``But this research shows that the movement
pattern of a few hornbill species may be more like that of
elephants and some primates, rather than forest birds.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitney was the senior author of the scientific papers in the
two publications.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Surmising that the resourceful hornbills may actually be nomads
rather than migrants, Smith and his colleagues are working with
scientists at the Wildlife Conservation Society and NASA's Jet
Propulsion Laboratory to track the birds' movements by satellite.
They will attach small radio transmitters on as many as 30 of the
big birds and NASA will track their movements.
</P>
<P>
   The study was funded by the New York Zoological Society/Wildlife
Conservation Society, the National Science Foundation, San
Francisco State and ECOFAC Cameroon. Other team members included
San Francisco State graduate students Mark Fogiel, Aaron Lamperti,
Kimberly Holbrook, Donald Stauffer and Britta Hardesty, and biology
professor V. Thomas Parker.

TRUTH OR CONSEQUENCES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (k and w coding.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- In David Kendall's perfectly crafted words, ``The
truth is the truth. Period.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's lead lawyer came up with those words to
refute what he considered silly newspaper stories over the weekend
that his client was considering different versions of a story to
tell the grand jury Monday about his relationship with Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   His agreement to testify under oath, Kendall said, included by
definition an agreement to tell the truth. Period. But in that
spirit of simple clarity, it follows that a lie is a lie. Period.
</P>
<P>
   There is no amount of sugar that can ever adequately coat a lie
to make it something else.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is a lie is a virus that attacks everything around it.
The only vaccines that ever work _ in private or public matters _
are confession, followed by truth and expiation.
</P>
<P>
   When lies are told, relationships fray. Whether they permanently
rupture depends, but without the vaccines there is no hope, nor
should there be.
</P>
<P>
   As a national sorting out process begins this morning, there is
a remarkable but still inadequately appreciated political reality
in the country worthy of benchmark status.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans agree that the president's job was literally on
the line Monday, that anything other than what Kendall called ``the
truth'' is unacceptable as a basis for his continuing in office.
</P>
<P>
   But most Americans also appear to have been ahead of the players
in this mess (Clinton included) in making some tentative
conclusions about this mess, processing those conclusions, and
making some critical, discriminating judgments about what matters
to them.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, most Americans appear to have concluded that the
president and Lewinsky had some kind of sexual contact and that
they could care less what kind it was. They also appear to have
concluded that if the relationship did not extend to a clear
subornation of her false affadavit to Paula Jones's lawyers or a
clear effort to obstruct that civil lawsuit, they can live with it
as long as the president told the truth Monday.
</P>
<P>
   That does not preclude, nor should it, a full range of visceral
reactions to the belated disclosure of what had better be the truth
_ from a shoulder shrug to disappointment to disillusionment to
disgust and betrayal. The president should be prepared for them.
</P>
<P>
   As the sorting out begins, the real question is whether the
truth can reaffirm the preconfession willingness of most people to
support his presidency if the truth includes some kind of physical
relationship and falsehoods about it, but nothing else. For
starters, it will help to know a few things this morning:
</P>
<P>
   _Did he focus on his statements to the public last January _
first on the evening of Day 1 and then with his finger wagging on
Day 5 _ that he did not have sexual relations with Lewinsky? And do
we now know what he says the truth is, in English? In particular,
has he taken at least a step beyond the word ``inappropriate''?
</P>
<P>
   _Did he avoid a quibble or word game about how he answered the
specific questions of Paula Jones's lawyers in last January's
deposition? Eventually, lawyers, pols, and even the rest of us can
fight about what the correct term is, but this morning it's what he
said and now says to the country that matters.
</P>
<P>
   _Has he released a transcript of his testimony? The truth
Kendall defined as the truth is the president's only valid weapon,
and the transcript is the proper starting point for any effort to
reestablish trust.
</P>
<P>
   But there's more. Someone who has not told the truth is
invariably and appropriately faced with some version of the
following: If you didn't tell the truth about X, how can your
statements about everything else be worthy of belief?
</P>
<P>
   Within reason, the president would be well advised this morning
to give that sentiment the legitimacy it deserves. Some people may
want to ask again about Kathleen Willey; others may have a
Whitewater question; and others may even veer toward the financing
of his reelection campaign. Sounds like an argument for a very long
press conference. Given the horrid results of seven months of
lawyer-led silence with a flat-out denial hanging out there about
sex, the value of truthful, timely public statements seems
self-evident.
</P>
<P>
   Monday was an obvious perjury trap, largely of the president's
making. But if Clinton's testimony puts a real wall between an
acknowledged personal relationship and the abuse of his office the
scandal culture has been braying about irresponsibly, most
Americans would prefer to move on. But only if the bricks in that
wall are made of truth.

POOR BILL? THINK ABOUT HIS DAUGHTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - What I remember from 24 years ago is Tricia Nixon's
face. It was the day after her father resigned and he was saying
goodbye to the White House staff. Tricia was off to his left, next
to her mother, staring at the president, never taking her eyes off
him.
</P>
<P>
   I remember she tried to force a smile even as her eyes welled up
and her skin turned a translucent gray, as if a light bulb inside
her suddenly burned out.
</P>
<P>
   That summer, news broke of a recording made in the Oval Office
in which the president tried to get the CIA to interfere with the
FBI's Watergate investigation. After that, Nixon had no choice but
to quit.
</P>
<P>
   It was August, like now. I was home from college, working the
night shift at a steel mill when I heard the words on a portable
radio someone had carried into the plant: ``Therefore, I shall
resign the presidency effective at noon tomorrow . . .''
</P>
<P>
   I cheered.
</P>
<P>
   The old-timers gathered around the radio shook their heads and
walked away.
</P>
<P>
   The next day I gleefully switched on TV as Nixon was about to
say a final farewell to his staff. I believed _ stupid kid that I
was _ it would be good for a few laughs.
</P>
<P>
   Then I saw Tricia's face.
</P>
<P>
   The family was all behind Nixon. Tricia, her mother, her sister
Julie, their husbands. The day before, they'd urged the president
not to resign. Investigators had the man cold, but his daughters
never wavered. They never doubted him. They loved him.
</P>
<P>
   You could see it in Tricia's eyes. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Breaking hearts &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Her heart broke for him, and yours broke for her, as it should
break now for Chelsea Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   It was easier for Nixon's girls than it is for Chelsea. Tricia
and Julie's father hadn't done anything to them, after all.
</P>
<P>
   Or to their mother.
</P>
<P>
   Their father was accused of being a bad president, not a bad
husband.
</P>
<P>
   Their father was accused of carrying on a criminal conspiracy,
not carrying on with a woman only a few years older than his
daughter.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of us can argue over whether the investigation of Bill
Clinton was worth the money.
</P>
<P>
   We can ask if spending $40 million to investigate a man's
personal life is wise in an era when 257 people die in a terrorist
bombing in Kenya because there's not enough money for a new
embassy.
</P>
<P>
   We can argue about policy and philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's family doesn't have that luxury.
</P>
<P>
   What happened between Clinton and Monica Lewinsky couldn't be a
surprise to Hillary. She's stuck with her husband through similar
problems. Chelsea had no choice. She may be 18 years old, a college
student, an adult, but she can't divorce her father.
</P>
<P>
   And apparently, she doesn't want to. &QL; 
`Open arms and devotion' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
The Rev. Jesse Jackson, who was at the White House on Sunday night,
said Clinton's family was behind him. ``Fortunately for him,''
Jackson said, ``they are greeting him with open arms and devotion.
. . . He won't have to testify with one eye on the grand jury and
one eye on his family.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, that's exactly what he should have done.
</P>
<P>
   All day Monday, commentators on TV were saying it was the most
difficult day in Bill Clinton's life _ first testifying before
Kenneth Starr's grand jury, then speaking on television to the
American people.
</P>
<P>
   I hope they were wrong.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't difficult for Clinton to say on national TV, ``Now
this matter is between me, the two people I love most, my wife and
my daughter, and our God. I must put it right, and I'm prepared to
do whatever it takes to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   That was theater. It was spectacle. It wasn't tough. The tough
part, I hope, came earlier, away from the cameras, when Clinton had
to tell his daughter what he'd done. That was drama. That was
tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   I hope no one was there to photograph her face. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   When you visit a famous building like Salem's House of the Seven
Gables, which has been around since 1668, you get a hefty serving
of history with your tour. But what is likely to remain with you
are the ``little'' things that show just how different life was in
the 17th and 18th centuries. Some examples:
</P>
<P>
   _The beds are short not only because people were slightly
smaller then but because residents slept sitting up to ease
breathing difficulties caused by sooty fireplaces and other
respiratory threats.
</P>
<P>
   _At different times, the famed Secret Staircase hid goods
(purportedly to elude the British taxmen) as well as escaped slaves
en route to Canada via the Underground Railroad.
</P>
<P>
   _The youngest child was given the unenviable job of emptying the
chamber pots. So that child would, of course, pray for Mama to have
another baby!
</P>
<P>
   _Behind the house, you could stroll just a few feet into the
ocean and pick up huge lobsters. These would be given to the pigs
and the indentured servants. Proper people wouldn't dream of dining
on those shell-covered scavengers.
</P>
<P>
   The House of the Seven Gables Historic Site is open year round
except for the first two weeks in January. It constitutes its own
national historic district with a collection of six houses on the
National Register of Historic Places. There are also two seaside
Colonial Revival Gardens and an 18th-century granite sea wall. For
more information, call 978-744-0991 or visit www.7gables.org.

THIS PLACE IS FOR THE BIRDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAMINGTON NATIONAL PARK, Queensland, Australia _ Padding around
his bachelor pad, the Satin Bower-bird knows a thing or two about
love nests. Meticulously he prepares a blissful, trystful setting
for the winged ladies in his mental little black book. Etchings may
work as a lure for some romancers, but they aren't the attractions
offered by this cobalt blue-feathered Casanova of the rain forest.
</P>
<P>
   No, he's in a constant blue period _ one that another artistic
dallier, Picasso, would have envied _ as he decorates the interior
of his tender trap hidden away in the bushes. And it works.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give 'em blue and more blue,'' the satiny seducer would advise
as he strews items of that shade about his ground-floor flat. A
strip of plastic here, a drinking straw there from his ongoing
rounds as collector. Perhaps a piece of paper, a barrette, a bottle
cap. Anything will do as long as it's blue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Irresistible to the birds,'' he'd tell you, strutting like
Mick Jagger in a come-hither dance. ``Along with me, of course.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael O'Reilly, urging silence to the few of us following him
on this pre-breakfast stroll, points to the underbrush, and
whispers. ``There he is, getting ready for love.''
</P>
<P>
   We would have walked right past the Satin Bower-bird's playpen,
but Michael knows all the residents' haunts, and delights in
showing them to visitors at his family's place, O'Reilly's Rain
Forest Guesthouse. Middle-aged, droll, and gregarious, Michael is a
second generationer, born to the bush, and continuing the tradition
that is just as strong in the third.
</P>
<P>
   This is basically to let folks soak up the wilds of the Green
Mountains in Queensland's Lamington National Park while enjoying a
few civilized touches _ hot showers and good grub _ in rugged
country that is virtually unchanged since the O'Reilly invasion of
1911. Eight frontiering O'Reilly boys, brothers and cousins from
two branches of the family, hacked their way through thickly-woven,
primeval forests, uphill and across ridges to find this marvelous
hideaway where they cleared land for a dairy and horse farm.
</P>
<P>
   ``The going's a little easier today, mate,'' says Michael,
smiling. ``Don't know how they did it.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the rest of his clan, he has forsaken horses for automotive
horsepower whenever it's necessary to crash the outer world, such
as the silver-towered citadel by the sea, capital city Brisbane, a
two-hour drive. When the O'Reillys decided in 1926 that dispensing
the milk of human kindness as innkeepers might be preferable to
milking cows, it took two days: train, bus, overnight in a country
hotel, and finally a precarious 15-mile climb to their isolated
mountaintop on horseback.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, following a skinny hardtop road right up to the front
door, you get an idea of how arduous, even forbidding, the journey
used to be. Sometimes the road clings to the rim of a ridge with
harrowing drops on either side, swinging in and out of dark, spooky
alcoves of tangled vines, offering glimpses of pastoral valleys and
breasty mountains that seem snowcapped in snoods of clouds. Furry,
spoon-eared wallabies (mini-kangaroos) clutch hillsides, and so do
mini-wallabies that are called pademalas?? as their young peep from
maternal pouches.
</P>
<P>
   Days are hot, nights pleasantly cool, accommodations and
family-style tucker (dining) most agreeable. Down-home, moderate,
and comfortable _ an outright steal, considering the way the US
dollar is slaying its way-down down under cousin.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a great time for you Yanks to visit us,'' says the genial
boss, Peter O'Reilly, son of one of the founders. ``But when I go
to America ... well ... I can't go as often as I'd like the way the
exchange is.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Reilly's is an ``Antipodal Shangri-la,'' in the words of my
friend, Aurelio. ``A place where Mother Nature is always on
holiday, an ornithological smorgasbord.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no way to give nature the slip. While you dine, a
glamorous bush rat or a sad-eyed tree frog, and any number of
birds, may kibbitz your table manners through a window. You can
have your nature hard, along rugged bush trails that radiate for
miles, or very easy, within a few yards' walk from your room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doesn't matter to us,'' says Michael O'Reilly. ``We'll lead
you anywhere, or send you on your way there. If you don't care to
walk through the forest, you can sky-walk over it.''
</P>
<P>
   Swaying and creaking (but firmly anchored-and-fenced 100 feet
up), the ``tree walk'' is a stunning wooden pathway that gives you
a Tarzan feeling of promenading across the ancient forest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course'' Michael says, ``if you just want to sit on the
balcony of your room or in the bar looking at the mountains, that's
fair enough. Not much eyestrain involved.''
</P>
<P>
   We're barely out of the lodge's entryway, and beyond the
Bower-bird's makin' whoopee blue-room-for-two, and Michael is
picking out something new for us practically every step of the
short way.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a rare one _ Albert's Lyre Bird.'' Hunched-over, it
looks like a wary, jaywalking pedestrian in a brown overcoat. ``Got
to be cautious, alert. Pythons like to drop on Lyre Birds.''
</P>
<P>
   A tiny Eastern Whip Bird has a big siren-like voice, though
cracking like a whip. Sitting in the catbird seat, a comfortable
bough, and meowing is a smug-faced Catbird in champagne-bottle
green raiment. A Royal Regent bird, black with yellow-waistcoat,
named for King George IV, looks just as pompous.
</P>
<P>
   Rainbows on your shoulder, multicolored Rosellas and King
Parrots, perch and gently peck passersby, looking for breakfast,
which Michael supplies by scattering raisins. The Rosella on my
head doesn't want to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably intrigued by a paved landing strip,'' says Danielle,
one of the group.
</P>
<P>
   After our own breakfast, Michael assigns us to another
sharp-eyed resident naturalist, Glen Threlfo, who has made an
international reputation in wildlife photography. As much fun and
knowledgeable as Michael, he notes a thick and powerful,
high-rising tree called a buttressed booyong.
</P>
<P>
   ``However, you see, that strangler fig has the booyong in its
grip, wrapped right around. It's a death hold. Mark my words, that
booyong's centuries are numbered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now over here,'' he indicates that quiet tip-toeing off the
path is called for, ``is quite a mansion. Belongs to a Southern Log
Runner and his wife. Old Queensland style, up on stilts.''
</P>
<P>
   A work in progress. She, a small, snowy-throated gray bird, is
the builder, adding moss and ferns to the nest that is propped up
on tiny sticks almost under our feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ah,'' Glen says, ``here comes orange-throated dad with the
bucket brigade lunch. He brings the tucker, feeds her, and she in
turn feeds the babies. This is a hard-working family.''
</P>
<P>
   Excusing ourselves from their lunch, we move only a few yards
until he spies ``the home of a single parent. Quite a girl.''
</P>
<P>
   On bended knee with pocket-knife, he pries at an
ordinary-looking plain-faced dirt rise. Open sesame! He lifts a
hinged circle of earth, about the size of a quarter, revealing a
hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``In there,'' Glen says, ``is a Golden Trapdoor Spider. She
holds the door slightly ajar with one of her eight legs _ a real
strain all day long _ and is very sensitive to vibrations at her
doorstep. An insect comes by _ wham! _ she's got it. Take a look at
her and the family.''
</P>
<P>
   Down on hands and knees we snoop. Vision is obscured by
something that looks like a loaded clothesline: her new babies in
creamy egg sacs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Romance isn't that big a deal, not like with the Bower-bird.
It's even risky for the guy, a little spider half her size. Love on
the run. He comes by, deposits a packet with her, and gets the hell
out of there. If he isn't quick, she'll eat him.''
</P>
<P>
   This brings to mind that old Mills Brothers ballad: ``You Always
Hurt the One You Love.''

 UNDATED: ... was the president.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1968, Harris took a job at Sun Oil as a community relations
consultant. Once again, she was promoted, eventually chosen to head
the company's public relations department in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Harris was briefly married and divorced. She has no children.
None of her friends was willing to talk about the former husband,
except to say that he remained close enough to the family to attend
Miss Bea's funeral. Harris declined to answer questions about her
personal romantic life.
</P>
<P>
   Key elements in Harris's life have been her friendships, her
civil rights activism, and her work in the church.
</P>
<P>
   ``Church was not something to be played with for Barbara,'' said
Washington. He met Harris in the mid-1950s, when both worked as
church youth counselors. ``She was never someone you could describe
as a pew warmer. She was going to get in the midst of things.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Civil rights crusader
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Harris switched parishes as an adult to be closer to Washington,
a priest and author well known in Philadelphia for his political
activism. Fighting for the rights of blacks and women became a
central part of her life during the 1960s. She marched with Martin
Luther King Jr. and worked for the Urban League and other
organizations. She is still active in Episcopal groups for
African-Americans and is very outspoken against the church's
lingering disapproval of homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, Harris, still a laywoman, was asked to be the cross
bearer at a historic ceremony in Philadelphia when the first 11
women were ordained as Episcopal priests.
</P>
<P>
   It was ``a beautiful foreshadowing of what was to come,''
according to Reverend Ann Robb Smith, now the priest at Harris's
hometown church, and one of many in attendance that day who
remember her leading the procession.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after the ceremony, Harris said, she felt God tugging
at her to become more involved in the church. When asked to
describe that time in her life, Harris got a look in her eyes that
was so peaceful and intense it bordered on sadness.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very difficult to explain,'' she said. ``I had a very
active lay ministry, which was very satisfying. But I discovered
that there was a different shape to my ministry, and that I was
being led to the ordained ministry for a different dimension of
service.
</P>
<P>
   ``I struggled against it for a long time. I didn't feel that I
was a worthy candidate. A friend of mine who was a priest and is
now a bishop said, `God does not call those who are worthy; he
makes worthy those who are called.' That helped.''
</P>
<P>
   After deciding to become a priest, Harris continued working at
Sun Oil. She took seminary classes nights and weekends and spent
her vacations studying, a nontraditional route. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Entering the order
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Harris was ordained a deacon in 1979, and a priest in 1980, at
the age of 50. She left her position at Sun, but remained a
consultant for the company.
</P>
<P>
   Her first religious job was as part-time priest in charge of a
church in Norristown, Pa., called Saint Augustine of Hippo. Then,
in 1984, Harris was named executive director of the Episcopal
Church Publishing Co. and publisher of The Witness magazine, long
an open forum for dissent within the church. Harris had been on the
board of the company for years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, she took Washington's place as interim director of the
Church of the Advocate when he had stepped down. That same year,
she attended the Lambeth Convention, a gathering of Anglican
bishops from all over the world, in Canterbury, England, as a
reporter for The Witness.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was open talk at the time that a woman might be elected
in the United States,'' said Reverend Canon Edward W. Rodman, the
canon missioner for Massachusetts and Harris's friend for 30 years.
``Her name was lifted up at that time as one of the possible
candidates. She came back sort of on notice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really torn about whether it was something I really
wanted to do,'' said Harris. ``I thought about all of the potential
problems. I thought I wouldn't be nominated, as a woman. Then I
thought that I would not be elected, even if I was nominated ... I
was greatly surprised at each step in the process.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
`Caring and alert'
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``When she came in for the formal interview with the committee,
it was so very clear in that time that she would be one of the
nominees,'' said John J. Bishop, a retired priest living in
Yarmouthport, who chaired the committee that elected Harris as a
bishop. ``She was just caring, alert, bright, committed to the
issues that were confronting the church at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington remembers the day Harris was elected. ``She received
a call from David Johnson, the bishop of Massachusetts at the time,
saying she had been elected. I did the sermon at her ordination to
the priesthood, and she called and said `You better get another
speech prepared.' That was deep.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris's consecration as bishop was widely supported in this
liberal state. But some in the church, such as the Episcopal bishop
of South Carolina, who resigned one week after Harris was selected,
said her unorthodox religious education was unacceptable. Others
showed up at the consecration to protest, because of Harris's
gender.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the protests were very personal,'' Harris said. ``I
got death threats.'' She stopped to grin, and added, ``All in the
name of the Lord, of course.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 10 years since Harris became a bishop, her performance
has opened doors for other women in the church. There are now eight
female bishops in the United States, seven in Canada, and one in
New Zealand. ``That's why the people who protested did so,'' Harris
said. ``They knew that if one woman was consecrated, that there
would be no stopping us after that.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris has also elevated the visibility of nonwhites in the
local Episcopal church, which has become increasingly diverse. She
works in tandem with the diocesan bishop, Thomas Shaw, in a
relationship that those who know them describe as harmonious and
productive. The arrangement, by which they share most duties, is a
new system, and one that Rodman says was created to increase
Harris's visibility.
</P>
<P>
   Despite her energy, and her clear love of the work, church rules
require that all bishops retire at 72, four years from now for
Harris. Though she is vague about her plans after retirement, those

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A few months ago, the Big Dig faced big disaster, a
shutdown caused by lack of funding. Acting Governor Paul Cellucci,
working with legislative leadership, was able to cobble together a
$1.5 billion rescue of the downtown Boston project by pushing
through a complicated bond deal that allowed the state to borrow
for 15 years without consequences to its bond rating.
</P>
<P>
   The story didn't lead the noon news, the late-night news, or the
front page of the news. In fact, no one reported it at all. It was
too bureaucratic, too inside. Too colorless, too boring. Good
government isn't news.
</P>
<P>
   But in its small way, it illustrated Cellucci's strengths and
the problems confronting his campaign to remove ``acting'' from his
job title.
</P>
<P>
   A man who has served in the State House for nearly his entire
adult life, Cellucci, 50, is renowned for his ability to dive into
issues, forge consensus, and reach resolution. Unlike his
predecessor, William F. Weld, Cellucci is fascinated by the act of
governing, and by the minutiae of issues many others find tedious.
</P>
<P>
   But critics complain that in the body of the acting governor
beats the heart of a former small-town selectman, a man of modest
thoughts and minor causes. They say he is an inadequate substitute
for a man who cut taxes, uttered such memorable one-liners as ``you
can lead the House to order, but you can't make it think,'' and
jumped into the Charles River during a press conference just for
laughs.
</P>
<P>
   There are not many colorful Paul Cellucci stories, even fewer
memorable quips. He works, plays boccie with his best friend and
his 74-year-old father, and goes to movies to unwind.
</P>
<P>
   His opponents savage him as colorless and unimaginative, a
politician who hopes to ride Weld's increasingly distant coattails
into a full term. They say a misguided ``Rose Garden'' strategy
seeks to cover up an administration that has left almost no
footprints after more than a year in office. Even Weld, now
comfortably ensconced in a State Street law firm, acknowledges the
public does not have much sense of who Paul Cellucci is or what he
is for, against, or about.
</P>
<P>
   Despite often being touted as Weld's ``co-governor'' _
accurately, by all accounts _ Cellucci still faces the classic
challenge of the number two executive who seeks to become number
one: proving that he has the stature to run the show.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci betrays little concern about any of this. He is, he
says, a man committed to doing his job, the job the people of
Massachusetts elected him to do. He will continue to push for
deeper tax cuts, more money for education reform, and the
restoration of the death penalty. Much like his political role
model, former governor John A. Volpe, he believes he represents the
silent majority of Massachusetts voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just intent on doing my job,'' he said recently during an
interview in his office. ``I'm just continuing to fight for the
things that I think are important to the working families of
Massachusetts.''
</P>
<P>
   His stance reflects values forged early in life in Cellucci's
native Hudson, a central Massachusetts town of abandoned shoe
factories and steel mills, recently revived by high-technology
businesses. His grandfather settled in Hudson in 1910 after
emigrating from Italy. Cellucci's father, Argeo L. Cellucci, owned
an Oldsmobile dealership.
</P>
<P>
   Both his grandfather and his father held public office in Hudson
_ his grandfather as a public works commissioner, his father, to
this day, as head of the industrial commission, a panel designed to
lure business to a sleepy town dotted with decaying red brick and
often overshadowed by neighboring Marlborough.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci's interest in politics was evident at an early age. As
a 10-year-old, in 1958, he handed out leaflets for his
grandfather's public works campaign. Two of the three commissioners
had resigned in a dispute with the town power department, and Argeo
L. Cellucci had decided to replace one of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember going door-to-door, passing out pamphlets for my
grandfather,'' Cellucci recently mused over coffee at Nick's Diner,
where he has breakfast most mornings. ``I loved the challenge and
excitement of politics then, as I continue to today.''
</P>
<P>
   Nick's is a place where nearly everyone greets him as Paul,
where a man who once served with him on the Hudson board of
selectmen shoos him to a more distant table during an interview
because he is disrupting everyone else's good time.
</P>
<P>
   Hudson of the 1950s and the 1960s was a town in transition.
After the construction of the Massachusetts Turnpike and I-495 made
it accessible, the town nearly doubled in size, from a little over
8,000 in 1960 to 16,084 in 1970, according to the US Census. The
Celluccis, who sold Oldsmobiles for 69 years and Chevrolets for
nearly 30, took an active role in helping to manage the town's
growth, forming what remains a notably grass-roots view of the role
of government.
</P>
<P>
   One of three children, young Paul Cellucci's days and nights
were dominated by many of the classic pursuits of small-town
boyhood _ baseball and football, playing alto saxophone in the band
at Hudson Catholic High School. He was popular, but not what you'd
call a star. He was class treasurer, not president, and the kind of
athlete who won sportsmanship awards rather than set records.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pulled the usual boyhood pranks, but nothing serious,''
recalls Robert Yesue, then and now one of Cellucci's closest
friends. ``Paul always had access to a car, because of the
dealership, and he spent a lot of time driving the rest of us
around to practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci graduated from high school in 1966, at the height of
the Vietnam War. He was opposed to the war, but speaks of that
epochal event with little of the passion he brings to discussions
of tax cuts or education reform. He never participated in a Vietnam
protest, and he joined the ROTC as an undergraduate at Boston
College.
</P>
<P>
   A training exercise at Fort Devens in Ayer provided one of the
lighter moments of his college career. During an escape-and-evasion
exercise, Cellucci, was ``captured'' by a group of upperclassmen
pretending to be North Vietnamese soldiers. He talked his way out
of captivity, escaping into a swamp. When he made it out, he was on
Lunenburg Road in Lancaster, in battle fatigues, carrying an
unloaded M-1 rifle. He hitchhiked back to Devens at 2:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci graduated from BC with a degree in accounting in 1970,
and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Army. But he
never made it any closer to Vietnam than the Aberdeen Proving
Grounds in Maryland, where he spent three months in the reserves.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, he continued to work in the family business,
commuting to classes at Boston College. He washed cars, waxed cars,
and sold cars. He remembers horrifying his father in 1973 by
ordering 100 burnt-orange Cutlasses at the end of the model year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just liked the color,'' Cellucci said with a laugh. ``We
were selling maybe 500 cars a year, so 100 was a huge number. But I
sold them all, and once in a while I still see one around town.''

<P>
   Mary had a little lamb;

<P>
   STERLING, Mass. _ It may not be the most weighty debate of the
pre-millennial period, but the question of who wrote ``Mary Had a
Little Lamb'' is sure consuming the folks in two small towns in New
England.
</P>
<P>
   A century and three-quarters after the poem was published (give
or take a few years, depending on which version of the story you
believe), residents of Sterling and Newport, N.H., are still
arguing over ownership of the famous little ditty about a faithful
lamb and unwelcoming schoolteacher.
</P>
<P>
   The debate has at times gotten wild and woolly. Sterling
(population 6,935) claims it was written by a schoolboy who
witnessed an incident in that town north of Worcester, involving a
girl named Mary Sawyer. Newport (in the southwest corner of the
state; population 6,110) insists it was written by a woman who
lived there, and was a prominent writer and editor. Proponents from
both factions have produced what they say is definitive evidence
for their case. Over the years, insults have been exchanged,
allegations of plagiarism and lying tossed about. No one is backing
down; in both cases, being known as the birthplace of the poem is a
primary tourism draw.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen people go livid over this,'' says Lee Swanson, a
Sudbury historian with an interest in Sterling history. ``They
actually get red in the face.''
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, passions have flared over the forming of the
nonprofit Mary's Little Lamb Association, a preservation group of
12 Sterling residents who hope to parlay the Mary's lamb connection
into a major fund-raising campaign. They would like to raise at
least a quarter-million dollars to restore a farmhouse said to have
belonged to the original Mary and make it a historical site.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody, including both sets of my grandparents, knew'' the
poem is part of Sterling history, says Diane Melone of Sterling, a
sixth-generation descendant of Mary Sawyer. Denying it is ``like
living in Gettysburg and saying the Battle of Gettysburg didn't
happen there.'' Despite Melone's interest in all things Mary, she's
never been to Newport to hear their side of things. ``I'd probably
get murdered,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   According to the official town source on the matter, ``The True
Story of Mary and Her Little Lamb,'' the Mary of the poem was a
girl named Mary Sawyer born in 1806 in Sterling. One day in 1815
her devoted lamb followed her to school and up the classroom aisle
when she was asked to recite a lesson. The teacher, alas, ``turned
it out,'' as the poem would have it.
</P>
<P>
   The incident so amused and inspired a boy named John Roulstone,
who happened to be visiting the classroom that day, that he took
pencil to paper and dashed off the first three stanzas of ``Mary
Had a Little Lamb.'' Since then, the booklet states, three other
stanzas have been added.
</P>
<P>
   The proof? ``I don't have just one thing I wave under people's
noses,'' says Melone, &UR;  &LR; who with her sister owns the Sawyer
homestead. But evidence, she says, includes the fact that car
magnate Henry Ford ``believed it totally.'' Ford, who once owned
the Wayside Inn in Sudbury, purchased the framework of the original
schoolhouse in 1927 and had it moved to the inn, where it still
stands.
</P>
<P>
   It includes the corroboration of Judge Arthur P. Rugg of
Sterling _ a chief justice of the Massachusetts supreme court and
Sawyer's next-door neighbor _ &UR;  &LR; who researched the poem's history
and &UR;  &LR; credited Roulstone with the first 12 lines. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Plus, Mary Sawyer herself said Roulstone wrote it. The
Historical Society archives contain a copy of an 1879 letter
written by Sawyer in which she described the incident and confirmed
Roulstone's authorship.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Sterling promotes itself as the home of Mary and her
lamb. A small bronze lamb statue stands in tribute on the town
common. A plaque in front of Mary Sawyer's house states it is ``the
house of Mary Elizabeth Sawyer, who was made famous by the poem
`Mary Had a Little Lamb.''' The Sterling Historical Society sells
Mary's lamb T-shirts and notecards and fuzzy lamb statuettes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mary wasn't your simple country bumpkin,'' insists Mary's
Little Lamb Association board member David Gibbs, who would like to
see the Sawyer homestead listed on the National Register of
Historic Places. ``She went on to become matron of McLean Hospital.
I believe if there is such credibility to the New Hampshire story,
Henry Ford would have gone to Newport to obtain a schoolhouse.''
</P>
<P>
   It's uncomplicated: Every word of the poem was written by
Newport native Sarah Josepha Hale.
</P>
<P>
   Hale, easily Newport's most distinguished citizen, was editor of
the publication called Godey's Lady's Book from 1837 to 1877, and
author of 20 books and hundreds of poems. She is also credited with
successfully advocating for Thanksgiving to be a national holiday
and completion of the Bunker Hill monument.
</P>
<P>
   The proof that she wrote ``Mary Had a Little Lamb''? It was
published in 1830 under her name, in a collection called ``Poems
for Our Children,'' says Andrea Thorpe, director of the Richards
Free Library in Newport, and chief proponent of the pro-Sarah side
of the lamb debate.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, Hale said she wrote it, in a signed statement
that appeared in the Boston Transcipt in 1889, written by her son
on her behalf shortly before she died.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was shaping public opinion. Why would she stoop to
plagiarize a lousy children's poem?'' says Thorpe, administrator of
the Sarah Josepha Hale award, given to writers with a New England
connection. As for the Henry Ford connection, ``Let's face it.
Henry Ford ... made good cars. I don't think he's a good
historian.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Sterling, Newport proudly displays its link to the lamb. A
memorial plaque to Hale states that ``she composed the poem now
called `Mary Had A Little Lamb.''' Tour guides talk about it, and
it's a subject of the Newport information guide produced by the
Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Thorpe has a standard indignant letter she writes to all
publications &UR;  &LR; _ from the Horn Book magazine to National Wool
Gatherer _ that link Sterling with the Mary's lamb poem. (``Your
article about the authorship of the poem `Mary's Lamb' shows a
complete disregard for literary history ... and an ignorance of the
contributions made by one of the most famous people to come from
Newport.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``It's getting so that every time (something is written), New
Hampshire jumps in,'' snaps Ruth Hopfmann, curator of the Sterling
Historical Society, who keeps a record of such letters in a file
labeled ``Sarah Josepha Hale/The Other Person Claiming to Be
Mary.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the debate shows no sign of abating, although
Sterling's Melone is willing to compromise and grant Hale
authorship of the last three verses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like she needs to be given the last three verses,'' says
Thorpe. ``We have no doubt that Sarah wrote it. Absolutely none.
... Everyone except Sterling agrees with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, scholars in Sudbury (Lee Swanson, historical
coordinator of the Wayside Inn) and in Stow (poet B.G. Thurston)
who are collaborating on research on the history of ``Mary Had a
Little Lamb'' say evidence is emerging to suggest the poem
originated with neither Roulston nor Hale. Their research has led
them to a nearly identical British version of the poem published
earlier than Hale's, about a ``Lucy'' and her little lamb. They are
in the process of verifying the information.
</P>
<P>
   Where would this leave Sterling and Newport? A little sheepish
perhaps?
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``I don't know,'' says Thurston. ``I truly believe neither
side is correct, though I don't have the full research to support
it. It might be one of those mysteries that will never be solved.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
``MARY HAD A LITTLE LAMB'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mary had a little lamb;
</P>
<P>
   Its fleece was white as snow;
</P>
<P>
   And everywhere that Mary went,
</P>
<P>
   The lamb was sure to go.
</P>
<P>
   It followed her to school one day,
</P>
<P>
   Which was against the rule;
</P>
<P>
   It made the children laugh and play
</P>
<P>
   To see a lamb at school.
</P>
<P>
   And so the teacher turned it out;
</P>
<P>
   But still it lingered near,
</P>
<P>
   And waited patiently about
</P>
<P>
   Till Mary did appear.
</P>
<P>
   And then it ran to her and laid
</P>
<P>
   Its head upon her arm;
</P>
<P>
   As if to say, ``I'm not afraid.
</P>
<P>
   You'll keep me from all harm.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What makes the lamb love Mary so?''
</P>
<P>
   The eager children cry;
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, Mary loves the lamb, you know,''
</P>
<P>
   The teacher did reply.
</P>
<P>
   And you each gentle animal
</P>
<P>
   In confidence may bind,
</P>
<P>
   And make them follow at your will,
</P>
<P>
   If you are only kind.

 BOSTON: ... around town.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After zipping through Boston College Law School, Cellucci, by
then married to his high school sweetheart, the former Janet
Garnett, began a career as a Hudson lawyer, handling everything
from real estate closings to criminal law. They have two daughters,
Anne, a government student at Harvard, and Kate, a student at
Boston College.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci was elected to a commission revising the Hudson town
charter in 1971, just after finishing his undergraduate degree.
That was followed by winning a seat on the town's board of
selectmen. Then, in 1976, he was elected to the Massachusetts House
(and later the Senate), the only Republican to win a formerly
Democratic seat in the first post-Watergate election.
</P>
<P>
   ``I became rather frustrated as a selectman because I found that
a lot of things were out of our control,'' Cellucci says now.
``They even passed a law that said what we had to pay our police
chief and our fire chief. I became an advocate of home rule.''
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature of the 1970s was a considerably different
institution than it is now. For one, it was larger (the House had
240 members, compared to 160 now), was more rigidly
liberal-Democratic and colorful, and was plagued by corruption
cases. Cellucci quickly forged a reputation as a reformer. He
played an important role in pressing for action on the University
of Massachusetts building scandal that ended the careers of a
passel of old-boy legislators.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was exceedingly hard-working,'' recalls former state
senator David Locke. ``I considered him to be an expert in certain
areas. He was one of our key people on health care issues and on
legal matters, and he was particularly strong on local affairs.''
</P>
<P>
   Locke also recalls Cellucci often walking into the Senate
carrying a stack of telephone messages and correspondence,
scrambling to maintain his ties to constituents in Hudson.
</P>
<P>
   He was active on a lot of health care issues _ one of his
signature triumphs was a bill to allow midwives to deliver babies.
He also pushed through a bill expanding the duties of optometrists.
</P>
<P>
   He was an advocate for seatbelt laws and laws requiring crash
helmets. Colleagues still remember him making an impassioned speech
on the Senate floor sympathizing with people who had to ``clean up
the mess'' after fatal auto crashes.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``He was known as a very good lawyer in the Legislature,''
recalled Andrew Card, a former legislator and a close friend of
Cellucci. ``People would go to him to get the legal view of
legislation. He was quiet and hardworking, I was more of a
firebrand.''
</P>
<P>
   But by 1988, after six years in the House and five more in the
Senate, he was itching to play on a bigger stage. He became an
early supporter of George Bush's campaign for president, and as
state coordinator, helped him secure the endorsement of several
Massachusetts police unions, endorsements that helped cement the
image of Democratic nominee Michael S. Dukakis as a liberal out of
touch with such issues as public safety.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign also became the catalyst for Cellucci's change in
position on the death penalty. He says police officers he met
during the campaign convinced him that the death penalty would make
their jobs safer. Cellucci has evolved over the years from a death
penalty opponent to its chief standard-bearer in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's drubbing in Dukakis's home state was a foregone
conclusion, but Cellucci had been instrumental in striking a nerve,
and convincing people that the much-beloved idea of the
``Massachusetts Miracle'' just might be on borrowed time.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that, almost everyone was surprised in 1989 when he
began making noises about running for governor.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican field was bursting with better-known,
better-financed candidates, including Locke; Andrew Card, then an
aide to Bush; former US representative Paul Cronin; state
Representative Steven Pierce of Westfield; and former US attorney
William F. Weld.
</P>
<P>
   But one by one, the Republican field melted. And that October,
while Cellucci was still undecided about leaping into the fray,
Weld approached him with a novel idea. They would be running mates,
and if elected would govern together as full partners.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of a governor and lieutenant governor running in tandem
was unusual. And so was the team, Weld, the patrician from Oyster
Bay, N.Y., and Cellucci, the ethnic pol from tiny and unglamourous
Hudson. Besides that, they barely knew one another. They'd travel
on the political circuit, but had no personal relationship.
</P>
<P>
   But Weld had never held office, and was intrigued by having a
partner with Cellucci's deep knowledge of the State House and
contacts in the Legislature. He also, he says, had a gut feeling
about Cellucci.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a great instinct and a great knowledge and background
in the Legislature,'' Weld said recently. ``Paul was absolutely a
full partner. He was in every meeting, he was in on every
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   They toppled Pierce, the darling of the party faithful, and to
slip past Boston University president John R. Silber in the most
dramatic governor's race in years.
</P>
<P>
   If Weld is thought of in more cerebral terms, Cellucci is
considered more passionate, and far more of a hands-on manager.
</P>
<P>
   But to his adversaries, Cellucci's reputation for deft dealing
in the State House is a camouflage for constant compromise with the
enemy. They accuse him of allowing two Democrats, House Speaker
Thomas M. Finneran and Senate President Thomas F. Birmingham, to
wrest much of the power away from the governor's office. Between
them, they have killed Cellucci's tax cut ideas without a trace of
remorse, sabotaged his dreams of funding a new stadium for the New
England Patriots, and ignored huge chunks of Cellucci's legislative
agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Trimarco, deputy treasurer under Cellucci's primary
opponent for governor, Joseph D. Malone, and a longtime activist in
the state GOP, says Cellucci has simply given away the store.
``It's tragic what's happened in this state,'' Trimarco says. ``We
were all elected in 1990 as reformers, and instead Paul simply goes
along to get along. We may lose, we may not win, but I would rather
lose as a Republican than just give the Democrats whatever they
want.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps not surprisingly, Cellucci does not take such criticism
seriously. He points to close to $1 billion in tax cuts as evidence
of his success in influencing Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think voters elected me to do a job and I've been doing that
job,'' Cellucci said. ``And if I'm elected I'm going to keep on
fighting to get the tax rate back to 5 percent, fighting for
teacher testing, and to bring back the death penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   One issue that has continued to haunt Cellucci _ one initially
believed fatal to his hopes of becoming governor _ is his mountain
of personal debt, estimated at $700,000. It has forced his family
to liquidate real estate holdings in Hudson and other properties to
meet payments. Cellucci emphasizes that he has never missed a
payment, that the debt is the result of raising his two daughters.
But critics have argued that it casts doubt on his management
ability _ at the least _ and insist that Cellucci's explanations
cover little more than half of the debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The substance of this story is and always has been that I
built up the debt providing for my family and I have never missed a
payment,'' Cellucci said last week. ``It has nothing to do with
being governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything, it may help me to understand families working to
make ends meet,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Though some recent polls indicate his race with Malone is closer
than had been expected, there has been little change in Cellucci's
low-key manner. He is, friends say, what he is: A policy wonk
dedicated to government, low on flash but bullish on the idea that
less government is better government.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been given an opportunity not many people get,'' he said
last week. ``And whether I'm governor for one year, one term or two
terms, I want to know I've been able to get things done.''

THERE'S SOMETHING FISHY IN LONG BEACH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADAM PERTMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. _ This oceanside city has tried repeatedly
over the last few decades to become a tourist mecca, but with
limited success. Sure, visitors sometimes came for a day to see the
luxury liner Queen Mary, but mainly that was a diversion from more
alluring Southern California destinations _ like Disneyland just to
the south and the multitudinous attractions of Los Angeles to the
north.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Cold War ended. The aerospace and military industries
that had sustained the local economy for generations began to
retrench; and officials here decided a few years ago that they'd
better move fast, or their community would become just another
example of American urban decay.
</P>
<P>
   So, of course, they decided to turn Long Beach into a tourist
mecca. And this time it looks like their efforts just might
succeed.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Our son put it succinctly and eloquently when he walked
into the just-completed, state-of-the-art Aquarium of the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow,'' said Zack, who just turned 4. ``This is great.'' His
1-year-old sister, Emilia, clearly agreed: She shrieked in delight
when she saw her first tankful of luminous, colorful fish.
</P>
<P>
   Inside and out, the $117 million aquarium really is that
impressive.
</P>
<P>
   It forgoes the seemingly inevitable huge central tank, like
those in Boston and Baltimore, and opts instead for large,
elaborate presentations throughout the facility. And even more than
the wonderful aquarium in Monterey, the one here capitalizes on one
of the region's major assets _ its year-round good weather _ by
placing fully 20 percent of its displays outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best news, since the aquarium is mostly what brought
us to Long Beach, is that the city has many other appeals. They
range from the Queen Mary (a magnet-like attraction because of the
hoopla over ``Titanic'') to the gondola rides along the city's
canals (the gondeliers even sing) to the renovated shops along Pine
Avenue (mighty fine eating) to the city's lovely, long beaches
(where do you think it got its name?).
</P>
<P>
   But it's the fish that local leaders hope will become the
biggest tourism lure.
</P>
<P>
   The concept of the aquarium, situated on five beautifully
landscaped, waterfront-facing acres on Rainbow Harbor, is that it's
the only one in the world that exhibits the full spectrum of sea
life from throughout the Pacific Ocean. Indeed, as you walk into
the cavernous entry foyer, the first things you encounter (apart
from the 88-foot whale model and its 22-foot baby overhead) are
three large tanks that provide a preview of the wonders to come:
the flora and fauna of Southern California and Baja; of the
Pacific's icy northern reaches, stretching to Alaska and beyond;
and of the ocean's tropical region found to the west, past Hawaii
and into the waters of Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to provide a full view of what's out there,''
explained our guide, Michell Nachum, a spokeswoman for the
aquarium. ``We think that in that way, at least, it's unique.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe in other ways as well.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to choosing a diverse, visually stunning collection
and creating habitats to match, aquarium officials decided none of
the marine mammals here would be captured from the wild; instead,
they come from other aquariums, research facilities, and even
rehabilitation centers for ailing or impaired animals. That's where
they found one of their favorites, Obadiah, a blind seal that
glides through the water like any of her mates by using her sense
of smell and by utilizing her whiskers as feelers.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the museum's educational component, each of the three
regional exhibits also will try to teach viewers about the
ecological problems facing their respective areas. The Southern
California/Baja display, for instance, will focus on pollution; the
Northern Pacific will explain the consequences of overharvesting of
fish; and the Tropical Pacific will present arguments for
maintaining and protecting its extensive coral reefs.
</P>
<P>
   To locate Long Beach's other major attraction, the Queen Mary,
you need only look across the harbor. It's just a few minutes'
drive away, and would be worth the trip even if the distance was
far greater.
</P>
<P>
   Short of spending thousands of dollars for a cabin on one of the
vast new cruise liners that are soaring in popularity (the Love
Boat thanks you, James Cameron), this is the closest you're likely
to get to feeling and understanding the grandeur of the Titanic.
The ship, that is, not the movie.
</P>
<P>
   The stunning combination of perfectly polished mahogany
banisters, weathered teak floors, and burled maple walls provides
just a taste of the intensely Art Deco decor throughout the ship.
It's considered by many aficionados to be the most luxurious ocean
liner ever to sail the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Dine in the elegant, oversized Grand Salon and you feel like
you've been thrust back to the 1,000-foot vessel's first voyages in
the 1930s. Walk the elegant decks of the onetime Cunard flagship
and you wish only that it would sail again.
</P>
<P>
   But it won't. After 1,001 trans-Atlantic trips from 1936 to
1967, including many in military service during World War II and
then as a transport for war brides and their children afterward,
the ship was purchased by Long Beach. And five years later, in
1972, it was renovated to become a very unusual hotel.
</P>
<P>
   So, today, you can rent a stateroom for the night. Or you can
take a tour of the engine room, or hold a wedding in the ship's
chapel, or rent a lavish stateroom for a birthday party or
reception. A very cool place to see and to be, especially if you're
a ship/sailing/ocean fanatic, a kid, or even just a breathing human
who likes to explore.
</P>
<P>
   As luck would have it, there's more: Even before ``Titanic'' hit
the big screen, a traveling exhibition of artifacts from the
world's most famous sunken ship was being presented on the Queen
Mary. Not many visitors were expressing interest in paying a
separate admission to see it, however, so the extensive display was
to have closed early last year.
</P>
<P>
   Then the movie opened in December 1997. And then people started
streaming onto the Queen Mary to see items including still-corked
champagne bottles, a telegraph bell, and unopened letters that were
recovered from the real Titanic. Then the exhibition was extended
through April. And then through Labor Day ... you get the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been packed,'' said Karen Herrera, an official of the
Long Beach Visitors Bureau, who added with deliberate
understatement: ``The movie was a very nice coincidence for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Suffice it to say that, by some accounts, daily visits to the
Queen Mary have skyrocketed and occupacy in the hotel has soared by
several hundred percent. There are lots of hotels of every price
nearby, including some lovely upscale ones, but it's worth trying
the Queen Mary if you're game to sleep on a ship _ though the
erstwhile staterooms can be smaller than typical hotel rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing that many visitors are likely to travel to Southern
California for reasons other than just seeing the sites of Long
Beach, regardless of how tempting they may be, officals here have
devised a campaign essentially _ and perhaps a bit hopefully _
designed to make this city the hub of the region's tourism
universe.
</P>
<P>
   A full-color advertisement in a packet distributed by the
tourist bureau marks the city with a big red and gold star.
Emanating from it are dotted lines leading to some of the prime
attractions of Southern California, like Universal Studios, Santa
Barbara, Disneyland, and Palm Springs. And next to each site is the
time it would take to drive there from here, or, in the case of
Catalina Island, the hourlong duration of a ferry ride.

BARBARA HARRIS: THE ECLECTIC ECCLESIASTIC 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-ART-BOS  
 (ART ADV.: A photo is being sent to NYTNS clients. Non-subscribers
can make individual purchases by calling 212-556-4204 or -1927.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALISA VALDES-RODRIGUEZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bishop Barbara Clementine Harris knelt at the altar, her
68-year-old knees padded only by her cassock's thin beige cloth.
Head lowered, she gently lifted a wet cloth from a plastic tub and
washed a man's bare feet.
</P>
<P>
   The foot washing is a yearly Episcopal ritual, symbolic of
Jesus' washing the Apostles' feet, a show of humility. For those
gathered, seeing Harris humbled was impressive. After all, she is
the suffragan (assisting) bishop for Massachusetts, which means she
is second in command of the nation's largest Episcopal diocese. She
has held the job since 1988, when she became the first woman
elected as a bishop in the world's 70-million member Anglican
Church.
</P>
<P>
   But what the 12 barefoot celebrants may not have known is that
they were seeing just one side of Harris, who, before becoming a
priest at age 50, spent nearly three decades as a corporate
executive _ occasionally barefoot herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barbara used to sit at her desk and take off her shoes while
she talked on the phone,'' said Bud Davis, who worked for Harris
when she was a Sun Oil Co. public relations manager. ``She'd turn
her head, and we'd go in and steal her shoe. Practical jokes were
not only tolerated, they were expected in Barbara's department.''
</P>
<P>
   But that was 30 years ago, when Harris was known for throwing
fabulous dinner parties in her native Philadelphia. And this is
now. Being a bishop for 10 years has to have changed Harris, right?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not at all,'' said Dorothy Cousins, a retired Philadelphia
police detective who has been one of Harris's closest friends since
seventh grade. Harris still drives her BMW. She still vacations at
a condo in Cancun, Mexico. She still calls her three best friends _
friends she's had for 60 years _ once a week. She still has a
cleaning lady. She still spends her free time listening to
classical music. She still cooks like a chef. Harris has not
changed. It just so happens that she has always been a complex and
motivated human being.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't set out in life to be a bishop,'' Harris mused
during an interview in her office on the fourth floor of the
diocesan headquarters on Tremont Street, across from Boston Common.
``At least I didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris, dressed impeccably in slacks, a shirt tailored for her
petite frame, and purple pumps several shades removed from her nail
polish, did not choose to sit behind her large desk. Instead, she
offered her guest a seat on the crimson sofa and positioned herself
on a hard wooden chair nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Harris's religious mentor, Philadelphia's Reverend Paul
Washington, said that when he thinks of Harris, he gets an image of
a witty storyteller standing in front of a giggling group of
onlookers in her living room. He said he has often suggested,
almost seriously, that she be a stand-up comic.
</P>
<P>
   But in this formal office setting, that sense of humor was
clearly under wraps. Harris spoke in measured tones, outlining her
schedule as dryly as a press release. She works about 80 hours a
week, much of it spent behind the wheel of her car, en route to
churches, or to her home in Foxborough, Mass. The 45-minute
interview, rare and methodical, was all she could fit in.
</P>
<P>
   The walls of the office, however, hinted at the passions Harris
has experienced since she was a young girl. The framed watercolor
of a stained-glass window in a Roxbury, Mass. church spoke of her
upbringing in a black Episcopal parish; the honorary degrees showed
that little in life is impossible if you have faith (Harris never
completed college); the colorful African wall hangings were a
reminder that, despite the church's reputation in New England as a
white Anglo-Saxon institution, most Anglicans worldwide are not
white. (There are more in Uganda and Nigeria than in all of the
United States.)
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there was a framed photograph of Harris herself, a
staff in one hand. A secret smile played at the corner of her
mouth. She looked as if she was meant to be here. As if someone had
called her. And, according to Harris, someone did.
</P>
<P>
   God.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Harris was 16 years old, and it was New Year's Eve. Her
friend Marilyn Allston was over at the Harris family home in
Germantown, Pa. The girls were doing their hair and laying out the
dresses they would wear for their double date. The plan was to go
to a church social. But the girls were sleepy and decided to take a
nap. When they woke up, it was past midnight. The boys had been
sent home, and they'd missed the party.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked at each other, and I said, `What are we going to do
now?''' recalled Allston. ``The first thing Barbara said is `We are
going to pray.' That's the kind of person she's always been.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
A segregated life
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Harris grew up in a black neighborhood outside Philadelphia at a
time when life was segregated, including the YMCA, where her
picture now hangs in the Hall of Fame. Her father was a quiet,
gentle, and educated man who labored at a local steel mill.
</P>
<P>
   ``In those days you had doctors working at the post office,''
said Allston. ``Among blacks, just because someone worked a
blue-collar job did not mean they were not well educated or well
mannered.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris's mother, Beatrice, was a classical pianist who worked as
the organist and choir director at the neighborhood church, Saint
Luke's.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to call her Miss Bea,'' recalled Washington. ``I knew
Miss Bea rather well. She was a very outspoken person, unafraid to
address the issue or the question, no matter how sensitive. I
certainly feel that she gave Barbara a good dose of that dimension
in herself.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris's elder sister, Josephine, still lives in the family
home. Younger brother Walter lives in Florida. Harris said she is
close to both.
</P>
<P>
   As a child, Harris kept busy with school, piano lessons, church
activities, and writing. At the Philadelphia High School for Girls,
she was recruited to write a weekly column on high school life in
the Pittsburgh Courier, a newspaper aimed at the African-American
community. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Making religion fun
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday afternoons and evenings, friends recall, the Harris
home, with its enclosed porch and baby grand piano, was the place
to go. ``Barbara and her family had a way of making elegance, and
even religion, seem fun,'' said Dorothy Cousins. At 16, Cousins
converted to the Episcopal Church, just so ``I could go with
Barbara.''
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from high school, Harris attended
Philadelphia's Charles Morris Price School of Advertising and
Journalism. In 1949, at age 19, she was hired by Joseph V. Baker
Associates Inc., a local public relations firm. Without a college
degree, but armed with a quick mind, Harris moved up in the
company. By the time she left, in 1968, she was the president.

WORLD'S LARGEST GLOBE IN MAINE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   The earth is yours to behold in Maine.
</P>
<P>
   DeLorme, a mapmaking company renowned for its atlases and
mapping software titles, is out to take title to the world's
largest moving globe. ``Eartha is the largest image of Earth ever
created,'' said David Delorme, chief executive officer of the
Yarmouth company.
</P>
<P>
   Eartha is 42 feet in diameter and rotates and revolves just like
the real earth. Every continent is vividly detailed. Eartha can
easily be seen from Interstate 95, but it's best to get off and
head over to Route 1 for a close up look from inside the DeLorme
headquarters. Visitors are welcome in the building daily from 8:30
a.m. to 6 p.m. and Sundays from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   To get a good look, just head for Freeport's famed outlet shops
and, of course, L.L.Bean, the store that never closes. DeLorme is
just a mile south of downtown Freeport.
</P>
<P>
   DeLorme is submitting Eartha for inclusion in the Guinness Book
of World Records, noting that it exceeds the size of the globe
currently listed as the largest, the Globe of Peace in Apecchi,
Italy. DeLorme hopes Eartha will give visitors a better
appreciation of the world around them, and help the company create
even better maps. DeLorme just released two Eartha-related
products, the ``Eartha World Travelog,'' a paper atlas of the
world, and ``Eartha Global Explorer,'' a CD-Rom with 3-D views of
the earth.

IN SEARCH OF WOLVES

   GARDINER, Montana _ One of the most persistent problems in
Western tourism has been solved in this small town on the northern
edge of Yellowstone National Park. The hardest thing to find (at a
reasonable price) in Montana is a steak cooked the way you want it.
It is true, in the big cities on the plains, they have heard of
``rare.'' Also in Gardiner (population under 1,000), at Red's Blue
Goose Saloon and Barbeque, they know what rare means. You can get
cool rare, warm rare and medium rare at Red's.
</P>
<P>
   A few miles south, down in the park, the wolves are thriving on
a diet of extremely rare elk chops. Forget everything you learned
on television about wolves. They do not have small litters of pups
in Yellowstone. It is not just the Alpha female who gets to have
pups. There are packs of wolves in Yellowstone where every female
has had a litter this year, and some of them have had as many as
eight and 10 pups. This is unheard of, but so is putting a couple
of dozen wolves out in the middle of a few hundred thousand elk who
have, apparently, forgotten what wolves are and what wolves do.
</P>
<P>
   Irven DeVore, a distinguished primatologist (the study of apes
and other beings like you and me) at Harvard University hooked up
with some mammalogists (wolves and elks and also you and me) to
visit Yellowstone last winter and had the privilege, if not
necessarily the pleasure, of watching a few wolves eat an elk.
``That elk had no idea,'' he remarked, ``that these wolves weren't
just oversized coyotes. There wasn't a chase. They just walked up
to that elk and ate it.''
</P>
<P>
   Finding a large carnivore in Yellowstone is not as easy as it
was in the days when people fed the bears at the roadside. Grizzly
bear sightings are remarkable, and a grizzly that stays in view of
one of the park's paved roads will stop traffic in both directions
for a couple of miles. Wolves have the same effect, but they move
around more than grizzlies and seldom stay long enough to attract
more than a few hundred automotive naturalists before moving off
into the woods or over the ridgeline, out of sight. The bears don't
move as much, for a variety of reasons, but mainly because the
grizzly bear can do whatever it darn well pleases.
</P>
<P>
   With a long day to make a short drive, it seemed like a sensible
idea to put away the fishing tackle (Yellowstone, on a bad day, is
still the best trout fishing country in the Lower 48) and make a
small attempt to find a wolf. It is not a good idea to make a major
expedition, the price of disappointment increases with the effort
expended, whether it's fly-fishing or wolf-watching.
</P>
<P>
   The best country for wolves this summer had been the Yellowstone
River valley below the falls and over on a tributary, the Lamar
River basin. The reason has more to do with human ability than
actual wolf presence. The lower Yellowstone and Lamar valleys are
less traveled by automobiles, and the landscape is prairie-like for
the most part, not forested. You can see a wolf a lot easier
through clear air than through lodgepole pine trees.
</P>
<P>
   The plan (even when you're relaxed, it doesn't hurt to have a
plan) was simple, just head for the Lamar Valley between the
Tower-Roosevelt intersection and where the country pinches in
around the road at Soda Butte, park the car, walk up the hillside
until you had a sweeping view of the valley, and get out the
binoculars and start looking for wolves along the treeline and in
the swales where they would be out of sight of the highway but
visible to the brave, solitary, resourceful amateur mammalogist,
moi. Even with a plan, it is good to be flexible.
</P>
<P>
   Less than halfway from Gardiner to the place I had in mind, the
Lamar Valley near Slough Creek Road, I noticed a road sign for
something called Blacktail Plateau Drive. It was a one-way dirt
road, six miles in length, a second sign explained. No problem. The
day was young, and a six mile dirt-road detour doesn't slow you
down much in a park that has a 45-mile-per-hour speed limit on the
most open roads.
</P>
<P>
   And halfway down the dirt, a very large coyote ran across the
road in front of the car. That is what my brain said: ``Big
coyote.'' Like the elk, I hadn't seen a wolf in my life. Well,
unlike the elk, I'd seen a couple running around a cage in the
London Zoo. Then the brain took a timeout: too huge around. Too
tall. Tail too brushy. Shoulders too heavy. A series of ``toos''
added up to wolf.
</P>
<P>
   So, taking a lifetime of wildlife watching experience in hand, I
parked the car off the road, got the binoculars, and started
scanning the ridgeline toward which my wolf had disappeared. He
(she, it, whatever) would have to come up out of the low country
and cross that ridge, that's what the well-trained brain said.
Another vehicle stopped, and a man and a woman got out with their
binoculars. This is what happens in Yellowstone when anyone sees
anyone else peering through lenses at the distant vistas. ``Wolf,''
I whispered. ``Went that way.''
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, I felt a gentle nudge. ``Wolf,'' the man
said in a conversational tone. ``Actually, four of them. Over
there. Behind you.'' A long way behind, two or three football
fields away, up on a bench were wolves. And suddenly, the brain
also remarked that those hadn't been dogs barking, those were
wolves having a discussion about where to go to eat what.
</P>
<P>
   We watched wolves for an hour. A couple disappeared, one at a
time, over a more distant ridge line. The remaining two did
interesting wolf things. They sat down. They sat up. They lay down.
They got up. They ignored each other. They sat around together.
</P>
<P>
   It was not as good as watching them eat an elk, I suppose, but
it was enormously satisfying. In the entire hour, no more than four
cars stopped to not dance with the wolves but to peer at them
through binoculars, spotting scopes, and long camera lenses. It was
a civil, polite, small crowd. Newcomers would be advised exactly
where to look (to the naked eye, the wolves were the size of poppy
seeds on the other side of the kitchen table, so to speak).
</P>
<P>
   We departed, one by one, newcomers arrived, one by one, and I am
sure that as long as the wolves were visible, someone was there to
watch them do their wolf act. We were a happy few, a band of
wolf-watchers, with an almost private, and certainly elite,
wolf-viewing party on Blacktail Plateau Drive.

FAMILY LEAVE ACT STILL GOING THROUGH GROWING PAINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Family and Medical Leave Act is five years old this month, a
significant feat for a profamily law whose birth caused so much
hoopla back in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Carved out of a long line of drafts and redrafts, the FMLA has
gone through radical changes since Georgetown University law
professor Donna Lenhoff helped write the initial bill in 1984.
Under the current law, workers at firms with at least 50 employees
are permitted to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave to care for a
newborn or newly adopted child; tend to a sick parent, child, or
spouse; or recover from their own serious illness. The measure
protects the worker's job and health benefits while he or she is on
leave.
</P>
<P>
   The original law, by contrast, guaranteed 18 weeks of leave
every two years, with 26 weeks for employees with serious health
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1980s, Lenhoff and US Representatives Maxine Waters
and Howard Berman, both California Democrats, set out to develop a
broad law that would cover fathers and mothers, adoptive parents
and legal guardians, employees with needy older parents, and
employees who simply needed time to iron out personal problems or
issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Initially, the law guaranteed an employee an equivalent job if
he was out for the birth, adoption, or serious illness of a child,
or because of his own serious medical conditions,'' says Lenhoff,
who is also an attorney at the National Partnership for Women and
Families in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   But the bill's debut in 1984 elicited bitter reactions.
</P>
<P>
   President Bush vetoed it twice; he thought it unAmerican. The US
Chamber of Commerce slammed it. It said employers would wind up
spending $16.2 billion a year to fill vacant jobs and continue the
health benefits of workers on leave. Congressional foes chided
Waters and Berman for promoting a measure that would force the
private sector to pay for social welfare. They also said it would
be too hard to maintain and track.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were 18 hearings over nine years in the House and
Senate,'' recalls Lenhoff. ``By the time my own daughter was born
in 1992, the bill had been passed twice and was about to be vetoed
the second time.'' Lenhoff watched debates on the bill on C-Span
during her own parental leave.
</P>
<P>
   Even some supporters were leery: How effective could such a law
be, they said, if the only people who can afford an extended unpaid
leave are dual-income couples and professionals?
</P>
<P>
   ``There are still naysayers out there,'' says Margaret Sotham, a
spokeswoman for the national partnership. ``There are people who
still think the law leads to abuse, but the truth is most people
cannot afford to take unpaid leave just for the heck of it. This is
for employees who need time for serious emergencies, for family
issues that cannot be handled in a few hours or a day.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, plenty of people can attest to the bill's importance
in their lives. But even with such a law in place, problems arise,
particularly for males at companies at which leave-taking is viewed
as something only women do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fathers, in particular, often feel pressured not to take a
leave or not to take as much time off,'' says Jennifer Swanberg,
senior research associate at The Families and Work Institute in New
York. ``Some of it is covert, some overt. And most of it is social
pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   In a recent study, The Families and Work Institute found that
maternity leave is still more acceptable than paternity leave, even
though companies are legally bound by the law to offer both to
workers who need time off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifty-three percent of the 1,000 businesses with 100 or more
employees surveyed offered time off for maternity leave with some
type of replacement pay,'' says Swanberg. ``But for paternity
leave, it was 13 percent. Culturally, businesses are more likely to
support leave for working moms then men.''
</P>
<P>
   Machinist Mark Duckworth of North Berwick, Me., is a living
example of why a law like the FMLA is needed. So is David Watkins,
also of Maine.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, after suffering an accident, Duckworth took 52 days of
medical leave from his job at Pratt &AMP; Whitney.
</P>
<P>
   When Duckworth tried to return to work following a layoff,
however, he was barred because of poor attendance. Duckworth argued
that his poor attendance was due to the medical leave.
</P>
<P>
   In July, a federal appeals court in Portland, Maine, agreed. It
ruled that a personal or family leave cannot be held against job
applicants by potential or prospective employers.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, while recuperating from a second heart attack,
David Watkins of Waterville was replaced as an oil company manager
even though he still had time left on his 12-week leave. When
Watkins returned to work, the only job he was offered was pumping
gas on the third shift.
</P>
<P>
   Watkins quit. Then he sued and won: A jury later found that
Watkins' employer had violated the FMLA and awarded Watkins $43,000
in back pay and benefits.

FIDELITY PROPOSAL TO MOVE SPARKS FEUD OVER SITE IN TEXAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE BAILEY AND STEVEN SYRE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe

<P>
   Jobs and tax breaks. Tax breaks and jobs.
</P>
<P>
   It is a game that Fidelity Investments has become expert at
playing as its payroll has exploded to more than 27,000 with this
longest of all bull markets. Fidelity played the jobs card hard
here two years ago when it wrestled a $40 million tax break for the
state's mutual fund industry.
</P>
<P>
   Now the game has shifted to Texas, where Fidelity has been
scouting to expand its regional operation. Code name: Project
Roadrunner.
</P>
<P>
   The prize is one of the hottest development areas in all of
north Texas and the players include the likes of Ross Perot Jr.
</P>
<P>
   After weeks of maneuvering, Fidelity is close to a deal that
would allow it to move its 2,700 Texas employees from Irving, just
outside Dallas, to a new campus-like setting on 300 acres in rural
Westlake, just outside Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity says it has no plans to expand its Texas work force,
but local officials there note the company has approval to build as
much as 5 million square feet of office space, which could
accommodate as many as 10,000 workers.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity emphatically says it is not planning to shift
Massachusetts workers to Texas and notes it has just announced
plans for a new building in South Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The money that comes with all those white-collar Fidelity jobs
set off the usual feverish courtship by the surrounding
communities. It also plopped Fidelity smack in the middle of a
blood feud that literally nearly wiped Westlake (pop. 250) off the
map.
</P>
<P>
   For two years now, Westlake has been torn by a proposal by
Perot's company to develop the 2,500-acre Circle T Ranch in
Westlake into offices, a shopping center, apartments, a golf
course, and something dubbed ``Texas Town,'' a town square with a
historical theme.
</P>
<P>
   Blocked by Westlake's mayor, who opposed Perot's plan, the board
of alderman staged a coup that forced Mayor Scott Bradley briefly
from office last year. In the best Texas tradition, the aldermen
then allowed Perot and other unhappy landowners to secede from the
town. Development-friendly Fort Worth and a small adjacent town
almost immediately accepted jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a donnybrook ever since, with lawsuit after lawsuit,
two of which are now scheduled to be decided by the Texas Supreme
Court.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity has changed the equation.
</P>
<P>
   When the big Boston mutual fund company expressed interest in
the Westlake site, Perot and Bradley (back in office after a town
vote) and his allies immediately made peace. Fidelity made it clear
it did not want to be caught up in some never ending battle of
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   David Weinstein, chief of administration and government affairs,
said Monday Fidelity was attracted to Westlake because many of its
employees from its Irving operations lived in the Westlake area.
</P>
<P>
   But it also had another reason for favoring Westlake: The town
has no property taxes. Fort Worth, which now claims the Circle T
property, does. ``No taxes is very appealing,'' a Fidelity
spokesman told Fort Worth Star-Telegram reporter Miles Moffeit.
</P>
<P>
   Not only does Westlake have no property tax, but the alderman
also approved guidelines that will ensure that Fidelity's bills
could be discounted by as much as 90 percent if a property tax were
ever imposed. The board also established a ``reinvestment zone''
that will allow Fidelity to strike tax-break deals with adjoining
counties. The Westlake initiatives came, in part, to counter
aggressive tax-cut deals by at least three nearby communities.
</P>
<P>
   All that stands in the way of Fidelity and Westlake is an
agreement by Fort Worth to give up its claim to the Circle T land.
Fort Worth isn't about to back down yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``What has changed, tell us?' asks Pat Svacina, a Fort Worth
spokesman. ``Why would they go into Fort Worth one day and out on
another day?''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Bradley, 59, has no small interest in the outcome.
Fidelity reportedly paid him $10 million _ ``I won't argue with the
number,'' he says _ for his 100-acre family ranch, which will
become ground zero for the new Fidelity campus. But he says he
excused himself from all the council's deliberations and says it is
not about the money.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my heart of hearts I would have preferred not to sell,''
Bradley said Monday on his cellular phone as he bounced along a
country road in his pickup with a load of Longhorns in tow. He said
he sold only because he became convinced that the Fidelity deal
offered the town the best way out of its war with Perot.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said he does not believe any company, Fidelity included,
decides to move based on tax cuts. But he added: ``They are smart
enough to play the game to get as many tax benefits as they can.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
The Red Herring
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR;  &LR; Speaking of Fidelity, the fund company won't have to rely on
former Magellan manager Peter Lynch to provide the humor in its
upcoming broadcast ad campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Comedian Lily Tomlin has been signed to join Lynch in the
campaign that will air later this year, a company spokesman
confirmed. Fidelity is also believed to be in discussions to add
comedian Don Rickles later in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity is expected to debut the ads at a New York press event
within weeks.

EUROPE'S IDEA IS NOT SUPER

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Last year, Kaiserslautern became the first German club to win
the Bundesliga in its first year of promotion. This was a
remarkable accomplishment, since most newly promoted teams require
at least a year to establish themselves against the country's best
competition.
</P>
<P>
   The coach, Otto Rehhagel, had been dismissed from Bayern Munich
after what management considered a disappointing second-place
finish in 1996. Rehhagel guided Kaiserslautern to promotion in
1997, then won the Bundesliga.
</P>
<P>
   The second-place team in the Bundesliga in 1997-98? Once again,
Bayern Munich.
</P>
<P>
   Underdog-makes-good is a universal story line not only in soccer
but in all sport, and is especially compelling in the context of
the club system used by nearly every country. Even if the club
system has been adapted to differing cultures and financial
philosophies, it always retains the basic sporting traits of
promotion/-relegation and usually respects the integrity of all
clubs, regardless of size.
</P>
<P>
   In the US, professional sport is controlled by a small number of
rich owners, who dole out franchises for profit. In most other
countries, there is just the opposite scenario. Each and every
village has the right to enter the national competition in any
sport, with promotion/-relegation determining who is in the top
divisions. This precept short-circuits franchising efforts and
allows sport to operate as a meritocracy and to retain its soul.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, Europe's biggest clubs are threatening to form a
Super League, which would exclude not only the Kaiserslauterns but
dozens of other formidable teams. Opponents of the project fear
that the medium-sized and small clubs will deteriorate, player
development will be ignored, teams' identities will suffer, and
national team competitions will be marginalized. Proponents of the
Super League say that such a league is an inevitability, and since
they control digital television in Europe, they should be the ones
to profit.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to brand TV moguls Silvio Berlusconi, Leo Kirch, and
Rupert Murdoch as the patronizing villains. Berlusconi's AC Milan
has twice been relegated in Italy's Serie A in recent years, and
finished in ninth and 10th place the last two years, yet Milan
would be among the 16 teams in the Super League. Bayern Munich and
Borussia Dortmund would represent Germany, leaving champion
Kaiserslautern out. There are dozens of other examples of worthy
teams being jilted.
</P>
<P>
   The Super League presumes that such a project is needed. This
ignores the Champions Cup, which has been modified into a Champions
League, and which will be further modified to satisfy the elite
``breakaway'' clubs.
</P>
<P>
   If the sporting elements _ meritocracy, promotion/-relegation _
are removed from the equation, soccer will no longer exist as we
know it. The sport's value might actually be increased by the huge
television revenues that are being proposed, but this will be an
artificial boost.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiserslautern president Herbert Kessler made a formal protest
regarding the proposed Super League last week. Fortunately, the
bullying policies of Berlusconi and Co. are being resisted.
</P>

Who's the future king?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Michael Owen  &LR; got Liverpool off to a fast Premier League start
by setting up  &UR; Karl-Heinz Reidle  &LR; and scoring the game-winner in a
2-1 victory Sunday at Southampton.
</P>
<P>
   But though Owen was crowned the future king of soccer during the
World Cup, Inter defender  &UR; Francesco Colonnese  &LR; believes he is
overrated, especially compared with Inter's 19-year-old midfielder,
 &UR; Andrea Pirlo &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   ``If Owen is worth 100 billion lire, Pirlo is worth 200 billion,
that's for certain,'' Colonnese said after facing Owen in an
exhibition recently. ``There is really no comparison between the
two. I realized quickly that he wouldn't trouble me technically
because he can only go one way. He is very fast but not strong.
This kid is certainly destined to improve, but he doesn't seem to
me to be top-class.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Pirlo and  &UR; Nicola Ventola &LR; , &UR;  &LR; 20, will be battling to
find starting positions with Inter, raising questions about the
development of young Italian players. The top teams are not only
stockpiling young talent, but they also are signing more top
foreigners than ever. Teams will be obliged to justify their
investment in outside talent, leaving the youngsters on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   If a Super League is formed, young domestic players will be
further ignored.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
United takes stand
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   D.C. United will likely meet Brazil's Vasco da Gama for the
InterAmerican Cup championship. United won the CONCACAF Champions
Cup tournament, defeating Toluca of Mexico, 1-0, on  &UR; Eddie Pope's
 &LR; 41st-minute goal Sunday at RFK Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Vasco da Gama will be protecting a 2-0 lead in the return leg of
the Copa Libertadores final against Barcelona in Guayaquil Aug. 26.
</P>
<P>
   United's victories over Leon and Toluca in the tournament should
help develop a rivalry between the United States and Mexico, which
the Mexicans believe will aid the progress of both countries.
</P>
<P>
   The win also could clinch the US national team coaching position
for United's  &UR; Bruce Arena &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who has little more to prove in D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever takes over the US team will not have it easy. Arena
realizes he will have to revamp the squad. Hopefully for him, he
can find someone with half the talent of  &UR; Marco Antonio Etcheverry
 &LR; to lead the way.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Changes afoot in Brazil
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Corinthians have emerged as Brazil's top team and their coach,
 &UR; Wanderley Luxemburgo &LR; , &UR;  &LR; has justifiably been named to succeed
 &UR; Mario Zagallo  &LR; as national team coach.
</P>
<P>
   Luxemburgo will also have to bring in new talent. He is expected
to add Corinthians'  &UR; Felipe &LR; , &UR;  &LR; 21, who is considered at least the
equal of  &UR; Roberto Carlos &LR; , &UR;  &LR; and  &UR; Pedrinho &LR; , &UR;  &LR; 20. Both Felipe and
Pedrinho have been with Corinthians since age 6.
</P>
<P>
   Corinthians forward  &UR; Marcelino Carioca &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who once became so
frustrated about his national team prospects that he offered to
become a US citizen, will also likely join Luxemburgo. It is
unimaginable how Marcelino, 28, would have been regarded in the
United States.

TRUTH OR CONSEQUENCES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (k and w coding.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- In David Kendall's perfectly crafted words, ``The
truth is the truth. Period.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's lead lawyer came up with those words to
refute what he considered silly newspaper stories over the weekend
that his client was considering different versions of a story to
tell the grand jury Monday about his relationship with Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   His agreement to testify under oath, Kendall said, included by
definition an agreement to tell the truth. Period. But in that
spirit of simple clarity, it follows that a lie is a lie. Period.
</P>
<P>
   There is no amount of sugar that can ever adequately coat a lie
to make it something else.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is a lie is a virus that attacks everything around it.
The only vaccines that ever work _ in private or public matters _
are confession, followed by truth and expiation.
</P>
<P>
   When lies are told, relationships fray. Whether they permanently
rupture depends, but without the vaccines there is no hope, nor
should there be.
</P>
<P>
   As a national sorting out process begins this morning, there is
a remarkable but still inadequately appreciated political reality
in the country worthy of benchmark status.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans agree that the president's job was literally on
the line Monday, that anything other than what Kendall called ``the
truth'' is unacceptable as a basis for his continuing in office.
</P>
<P>
   But most Americans also appear to have been ahead of the players
in this mess (Clinton included) in making some tentative
conclusions about this mess, processing those conclusions, and
making some critical, discriminating judgments about what matters
to them.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, most Americans appear to have concluded that the
president and Lewinsky had some kind of sexual contact and that
they could care less what kind it was. They also appear to have
concluded that if the relationship did not extend to a clear
subornation of her false affadavit to Paula Jones's lawyers or a
clear effort to obstruct that civil lawsuit, they can live with it
as long as the president told the truth Monday.
</P>
<P>
   That does not preclude, nor should it, a full range of visceral
reactions to the belated disclosure of what had better be the truth
_ from a shoulder shrug to disappointment to disillusionment to
disgust and betrayal. The president should be prepared for them.
</P>
<P>
   As the sorting out begins, the real question is whether the
truth can reaffirm the preconfession willingness of most people to
support his presidency if the truth includes some kind of physical
relationship and falsehoods about it, but nothing else. For
starters, it will help to know a few things this morning:
</P>
<P>
   _Did he focus on his statements to the public last January _
first on the evening of Day 1 and then with his finger wagging on
Day 5 _ that he did not have sexual relations with Lewinsky? And do
we now know what he says the truth is, in English? In particular,
has he taken at least a step beyond the word ``inappropriate''?
</P>
<P>
   _Did he avoid a quibble or word game about how he answered the
specific questions of Paula Jones's lawyers in last January's
deposition? Eventually, lawyers, pols, and even the rest of us can
fight about what the correct term is, but this morning it's what he
said and now says to the country that matters.
</P>
<P>
   _Has he released a transcript of his testimony? The truth
Kendall defined as the truth is the president's only valid weapon,
and the transcript is the proper starting point for any effort to
reestablish trust.
</P>
<P>
   But there's more. Someone who has not told the truth is
invariably and appropriately faced with some version of the
following: If you didn't tell the truth about X, how can your
statements about everything else be worthy of belief?
</P>
<P>
   Within reason, the president would be well advised this morning
to give that sentiment the legitimacy it deserves. Some people may
want to ask again about Kathleen Willey; others may have a
Whitewater question; and others may even veer toward the financing
of his reelection campaign. Sounds like an argument for a very long
press conference. Given the horrid results of seven months of
lawyer-led silence with a flat-out denial hanging out there about
sex, the value of truthful, timely public statements seems
self-evident.
</P>
<P>
   Monday was an obvious perjury trap, largely of the president's
making. But if Clinton's testimony puts a real wall between an
acknowledged personal relationship and the abuse of his office the
scandal culture has been braying about irresponsibly, most
Americans would prefer to move on. But only if the bricks in that
wall are made of truth.

<P>
   Mary had a little lamb;
</P>
<P>

   But just who Mary really was,

<P>
   STERLING, Mass. _ It may not be the most weighty debate of the
pre-millennial period, but the question of who wrote ``Mary Had a
Little Lamb'' is sure consuming the folks in two small towns in New
England.
</P>
<P>
   A century and three-quarters after the poem was published (give
or take a few years, depending on which version of the story you
believe), residents of Sterling and Newport, N.H., are still
arguing over ownership of the famous little ditty about a faithful
lamb and unwelcoming schoolteacher.
</P>
<P>
   The debate has at times gotten wild and woolly. Sterling
(population 6,935) claims it was written by a schoolboy who
witnessed an incident in that town north of Worcester, involving a
girl named Mary Sawyer. Newport (in the southwest corner of the
state; population 6,110) insists it was written by a woman who
lived there, and was a prominent writer and editor. Proponents from
both factions have produced what they say is definitive evidence
for their case. Over the years, insults have been exchanged,
allegations of plagiarism and lying tossed about. No one is backing
down; in both cases, being known as the birthplace of the poem is a
primary tourism draw.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen people go livid over this,'' says Lee Swanson, a
Sudbury historian with an interest in Sterling history. ``They
actually get red in the face.''
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, passions have flared over the forming of the
nonprofit Mary's Little Lamb Association, a preservation group of
12 Sterling residents who hope to parlay the Mary's lamb connection
into a major fund-raising campaign. They would like to raise at
least a quarter-million dollars to restore a farmhouse said to have
belonged to the original Mary and make it a historical site.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody, including both sets of my grandparents, knew'' the
poem is part of Sterling history, says Diane Melone of Sterling, a
sixth-generation descendant of Mary Sawyer. Denying it is ``like
living in Gettysburg and saying the Battle of Gettysburg didn't
happen there.'' Despite Melone's interest in all things Mary, she's
never been to Newport to hear their side of things. ``I'd probably
get murdered,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   According to the official town source on the matter, ``The True
Story of Mary and Her Little Lamb,'' the Mary of the poem was a
girl named Mary Sawyer born in 1806 in Sterling. One day in 1815
her devoted lamb followed her to school and up the classroom aisle
when she was asked to recite a lesson. The teacher, alas, ``turned
it out,'' as the poem would have it.
</P>
<P>
   The incident so amused and inspired a boy named John Roulstone,
who happened to be visiting the classroom that day, that he took
pencil to paper and dashed off the first three stanzas of ``Mary
Had a Little Lamb.'' Since then, the booklet states, three other
stanzas have been added.
</P>
<P>
   The proof? ``I don't have just one thing I wave under people's
noses,'' says Melone, &UR;  &LR; who with her sister owns the Sawyer
homestead. But evidence, she says, includes the fact that car
magnate Henry Ford ``believed it totally.'' Ford, who once owned
the Wayside Inn in Sudbury, purchased the framework of the original
schoolhouse in 1927 and had it moved to the inn, where it still
stands.
</P>
<P>
   It includes the corroboration of Judge Arthur P. Rugg of
Sterling _ a chief justice of the Massachusetts supreme court and
Sawyer's next-door neighbor _ &UR;  &LR; who researched the poem's history
and &UR;  &LR; credited Roulstone with the first 12 lines. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Plus, Mary Sawyer herself said Roulstone wrote it. The
Historical Society archives contain a copy of an 1879 letter
written by Sawyer in which she described the incident and confirmed
Roulstone's authorship.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Sterling promotes itself as the home of Mary and her
lamb. A small bronze lamb statue stands in tribute on the town
common. A plaque in front of Mary Sawyer's house states it is ``the
house of Mary Elizabeth Sawyer, who was made famous by the poem
`Mary Had a Little Lamb.''' The Sterling Historical Society sells
Mary's lamb T-shirts and notecards and fuzzy lamb statuettes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mary wasn't your simple country bumpkin,'' insists Mary's
Little Lamb Association board member David Gibbs, who would like to
see the Sawyer homestead listed on the National Register of
Historic Places. ``She went on to become matron of McLean Hospital.
I believe if there is such credibility to the New Hampshire story,
Henry Ford would have gone to Newport to obtain a schoolhouse.''
</P>
<P>
   It's uncomplicated: Every word of the poem was written by
Newport native Sarah Josepha Hale.
</P>
<P>
   Hale, easily Newport's most distinguished citizen, was editor of
the publication called Godey's Lady's Book from 1837 to 1877, and
author of 20 books and hundreds of poems. She is also credited with
successfully advocating for Thanksgiving to be a national holiday
and completion of the Bunker Hill monument.
</P>
<P>
   The proof that she wrote ``Mary Had a Little Lamb''? It was
published in 1830 under her name, in a collection called ``Poems
for Our Children,'' says Andrea Thorpe, director of the Richards
Free Library in Newport, and chief proponent of the pro-Sarah side
of the lamb debate.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, Hale said she wrote it, in a signed statement
that appeared in the Boston Transcipt in 1889, written by her son
on her behalf shortly before she died.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was shaping public opinion. Why would she stoop to
plagiarize a lousy children's poem?'' says Thorpe, administrator of
the Sarah Josepha Hale award, given to writers with a New England
connection. As for the Henry Ford connection, ``Let's face it.
Henry Ford ... made good cars. I don't think he's a good
historian.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Sterling, Newport proudly displays its link to the lamb. A
memorial plaque to Hale states that ``she composed the poem now
called `Mary Had A Little Lamb.''' Tour guides talk about it, and
it's a subject of the Newport information guide produced by the
Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Thorpe has a standard indignant letter she writes to all
publications &UR;  &LR; _ from the Horn Book magazine to National Wool
Gatherer _ that link Sterling with the Mary's lamb poem. (``Your
article about the authorship of the poem `Mary's Lamb' shows a
complete disregard for literary history ... and an ignorance of the
contributions made by one of the most famous people to come from
Newport.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``It's getting so that every time (something is written), New
Hampshire jumps in,'' snaps Ruth Hopfmann, curator of the Sterling
Historical Society, who keeps a record of such letters in a file
labeled ``Sarah Josepha Hale/The Other Person Claiming to Be
Mary.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the debate shows no sign of abating, although
Sterling's Melone is willing to compromise and grant Hale
authorship of the last three verses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like she needs to be given the last three verses,'' says
Thorpe. ``We have no doubt that Sarah wrote it. Absolutely none.
... Everyone except Sterling agrees with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, scholars in Sudbury (Lee Swanson, historical
coordinator of the Wayside Inn) and in Stow (poet B.G. Thurston)
who are collaborating on research on the history of ``Mary Had a
Little Lamb'' say evidence is emerging to suggest the poem
originated with neither Roulston nor Hale. Their research has led
them to a nearly identical British version of the poem published
earlier than Hale's, about a ``Lucy'' and her little lamb. They are
in the process of verifying the information.
</P>
<P>
   Where would this leave Sterling and Newport? A little sheepish
perhaps?
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``I don't know,'' says Thurston. ``I truly believe neither
side is correct, though I don't have the full research to support
it. It might be one of those mysteries that will never be solved.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
``MARY HAD A LITTLE LAMB'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mary had a little lamb;
</P>
<P>
   Its fleece was white as snow;
</P>
<P>
   And everywhere that Mary went,
</P>
<P>
   The lamb was sure to go.
</P>
<P>
   It followed her to school one day,
</P>
<P>
   Which was against the rule;
</P>
<P>
   It made the children laugh and play
</P>
<P>
   To see a lamb at school.
</P>
<P>
   And so the teacher turned it out;
</P>
<P>
   But still it lingered near,
</P>
<P>
   And waited patiently about
</P>
<P>
   Till Mary did appear.

<P>
   And then it ran to her and laid
</P>
<P>
   Its head upon her arm;
</P>
<P>
   As if to say, ``I'm not afraid.
</P>
<P>
   You'll keep me from all harm.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What makes the lamb love Mary so?''
</P>
<P>
   The eager children cry;
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, Mary loves the lamb, you know,''
</P>
<P>
   The teacher did reply.
</P>
<P>
   And you each gentle animal
</P>
<P>
   In confidence may bind,
</P>
<P>
   And make them follow at your will,
</P>
<P>
   If you are only kind.

FORMER CARDINAL IS BACK AT HOME WITH THE GIANTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PETE DOUGHERTY  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ In a seven-year NFL career, Kent Graham has
become Fassel-ized.
</P>
<P>
   Graham is on his second tour with the New York Giants, again as
a backup quarterback, but the familiarity is more with Jim Fassel,
his offensive coordinator in 1992 and 1996 and his head coach this
season.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants signed Graham as a free agent from the Arizona
Cardinals, where he spent two years as a sometimes-starter in an
offensive system Fassel employed there in 1996 prior to getting his
first NFL head-coaching job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had a lot of success underneath him,'' Graham said.
``I've been with him a lot. In Arizona, I had a lot of success when
he was there. This offense was the same thing we were running
there.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no quarterback competition at this Giants camp. Danny
Kanell won the job from Dave Brown during last season and will take
the first snap Sept. 6 when the regular season opens.
</P>
<P>
   Barring injury, of course.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the Giants and a lot of other NFL teams have gone
after experienced backups. The injury rate on quarterbacks seems to
increase each year, putting more value on having a competent
backup.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know what's going to happen during the year,''
Graham said. ``It's a long season. Obviously I'm not content being
a backup. I want to be a starter. Everybody does.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, the reality is Danny is starting. So I've got to
deal with that. If I am given the opportunity to get in there to
play, I feel, in this system, I have a really good chance of being
successful.''
</P>
<P>
   So far in the exhibition season, the results have been mixed.
</P>
<P>
   Graham, slowed by a groin injury, struggled in the opener
against Cincinnati, completing 2 of 4 passes for 20 yards. He was
the Giants' most statistically productive offensive player in
Friday night's 24-10 loss at Jacksonville (8 of 11, 104 yards), but
the numbers are somewhat deceiving. He got 73 yards on a 10-yard
pass to Amani Toomer, who was not whistled as being down by contact
and rambled the remaining 63 yards for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's getting there,'' Fassel said of Graham. ``He's getting
the rhythm back. He's a strong guy, he's got a powerful guy, and
the tendency with a lot of those guys is they wait until the guy's
open and wait until they see him and they power the ball in there.
He needs to be fluid, throw early, anticipate it, and he's starting
to get that feeling back.''
</P>
<P>
   An eighth-round draft pick of the Giants in 1992, Graham spent
his first three pro seasons in New York, backing up Phil Simms the
first two years and Brown the third. He was released by the Giants
after preseason in 1995 and hooked on with Detroit, but he never
threw a pass for the Lions. He signed with the Cardinals as a free
agent prior to the '96 season.
</P>
<P>
   When Graham played with them previously, the Giants were
rebuilding, going 6-10 under Ray Handley, then 11-5 and 9-7 under
Dan Reeves. Graham was on the other coast last year when the Giants
won their first NFC East title since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a lot different,'' Graham said of the new Giants.
``The attitude's different, the coaching staff is extremely
different. Players-wise, a lot of the defensive guys are still
here. Offensively we have a lot of changes.''
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen people who played in 1994, Graham's last season in New
York, are still with the Giants, although only tight end Howard
Cross, guard Greg Bishop and wide receiver Chris Calloway are
offensive players. ``I felt like I was back home,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Graham also believes he's a better player than he was when he
left.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a lot more experience now,'' he said. ``I've been a
starter in the league. I feel comfortable in this offense, should
they need a different quarterback. Obviously I've got to go out and
prove that.''

 &HT;    100 YEARS OF THE DAYTON DAILY NEWS, THE FIRST COX NEWSPAPER
 &HT;    (From the Daily News's special Centennial Section; embargoed

<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ It's late. The presses are running. In the
newsroom, you can't hear them but you can feel them, a steady,
throbbing drone through the floor, off the walls. The whole
six-floor building pulses as thousands of newspapers fly from the
end of the massive, two-story press, each an identical copy _ until
changes are made. There are always changes.
</P>
<P>
   A press is the heart of a newspaper, the beating center fed by
cells of words and pictures, metal and paper, connected to the
extremities of the world by clanking arteries of folders, stackers,
bundlers, chutes and loading docks.
</P>
<P>
   Ink doesn't really get in your blood, but it fills the senses.
Gov. James Cox, founder of the Dayton Daily News , knew it.
Three-time governor of Ohio, would-be president, confidant of the
wealthy and the accomplished, he wrote in his autobiography that if
reincarnated and given the choice he would ask for the aroma of
printers' ink.
</P>
<P>
   He finished his life amid that aroma as well. After losing the
1920 presidential election, he returned to Dayton to guide a
growing business empire from an office not 200 feet from an inky,
black-stained, rumbling press.
</P>
<P>
   The Dayton Daily News , the Miami Valley's recorder of news and
history, repository of found jobs and lost cats, resting place of
obituaries, reflector of opinions, sometimes wrapper of fish, turns
100 years old this year.
</P>
<P>
   Let's go back to the beginning, switching on an imaginary
reverse button on the big press. Slowly, 36,500 editions (not
counting remakes and extras) begin to fly off coffee tables, out of
newsstands and street boxes, unfolded and flattened into a backward
spinning press that has become a time machine. Billions of words
spill back into computers and typewriters and notebooks; 1.3
million tons of newsprint are returned to neat, unmarked rolls; 2.4
million pounds of black ink siphon back into barrels.
</P>
<P>
   There go the '90s. A Pulitzer Prize for stories on military
medicine. It's gone in a second as the press picks up speed. The
Dayton Peace Accords. The war in Bosnia. Deaths. Murders. The Gulf
War. A World Series victory for the Cincinnati Reds all disappear
in a blur of paper.
</P>
<P>
   The '80s flash by. The Berlin Wall is crumbling and the map of
the Soviet Union is redrawn. AT&AMP;T hangs its shingle on the NCR
world headquarters. The Challenger shuttle hangs in space for a
single, dreadful second. Hostages return from Iran. It all flashes
by as the press rolls on.
</P>
<P>
   The '70s come and go (disco mercifully so). A tornado, wide as
an interstate highway, hovers outside of Xenia. Fireworks light a
Bicentennial. The Reds and the Red Sox play a World Series for the
ages, masterfully recounted by columnists Si Burick for the News
and Ritter Collett for The Journal Herald. The Journal Herald,
created by Cox in 1949 but an editorial competitor of the News,
comes and goes, too.
</P>
<P>
   The '50s, the war-filled '40s, Depression '30s, Roaring '20s.
The Flood. A flight. The second war to end all wars and the first.
Inventors. Builders. The newspapers rush by, color fading into
black and white, headlines growing larger then smaller, fashions
changing, sports scores blaring briefly then fading into memory,
comics, columns, cooking, crime, catastrophes, congressional
elections, county controversies, city meetings, Christmas lights,
cars, concerts.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, as the press comes to a stop, you're back in 1898 and
a young James M. Cox, with modest experience as a schoolteacher, a
journalist for the Cincinnati Enquirer , and an aide to Middletown
Congressman Paul Sorg, is putting down $26,000 to buy two
newspapers in Dayton, Ohio: the Dayton Evening News and the Dayton
Morning Times .
</P>
<P>
   To tell the truth, neither was much of a buy. The papers
routinely published ``boilerplate,'' a newspaper term for canned,
prewritten features already set in metal, with headlines like
``Aluminum Foil; Industry's Solution To Having Leftovers Lying
Around Loose in Your Freezer.'' They were timeless and cheap, but
provided little more than filling space around the advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   Before Cox, no one had stepped forward to meet the asking price
of the owner, Charles H. Simms. The papers had meager staffs,
rickety equipment and shaky finances.
</P>
<P>
   The outlook was not good, but Cox set out to remedy the problems
of both news and circulation.
</P>
<P>
   He dropped the Morning Times to concentrate on the News ,
changing Evening in the masthead to Daily .
</P>
<P>
   The name change was significant. Even though the new century had
yet to begin, the Wright brothers had yet to fly, Cox must have
sensed the dynamic, changing place the Miami Valley would become
and with it a demand for up-to-the-minute news. Tossing the
boilerplate, he sent reporters out into the streets to report on
crime, government, business and society. And he ordered the latest
wire services to bring news of the growing nation and the world.
</P>
<P>
   The Dayton Daily News debuted Aug. 22, 1898. The front page
carried no mention of the paper's new owner, who nonetheless was
energetically starting to make changes.
</P>
<P>
   By 1900, The Dayton Daily News had become the leading paper in
Dayton and, with bundles tossed onto the interurban railway cars of
the day, was reaching out to Springfield, Piqua, Xenia and
Greenville. Cox was able to buy out his original co-investors in
1900.
</P>
<P>
   By 1903, the paper was a business success, with the rival Dayton
Press going out of business. Cox bought the Press' equipment _
better reproduction, faster delivery _ and bought the Springfield
Press-Republic, which he renamed the Springfield Daily News.
</P>
<P>
   It was the start of a media empire that would grow to include
newspapers, radio and television stations, cable companies and
automobile auctions.
</P>
<P>
   In the early days of the 20th century, being a newspaper
publisher brought with it considerable political power and Cox used
it to run for office. He was elected to Congress in 1908 and was
voted Ohio's governor in 1912 and 1914. After losing the 1916
gubernatorial election, he won the seat again in 1918, becoming
Ohio's first three-time governor. He oversaw progressive
legislation in law, school, tax and prison reforms.
</P>
<P>
   In 1920, Cox won the Democratic nomination for president of the
United States. Franklin Delano Roosevelt was his vice presidential
running mate. After losing his presidential bid (to fellow Ohio
publisher Warren G. Harding of Marion) Cox turned his attention to
building his businesses, but politics were never far away. Former
news editor Carl Beyer recalled a story told by switchboard
operator Eleanor Hopkins:
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor would pick up the telephone and say, 'Get me
Frank!' and Eleanor would dial the White House so Gov. Cox could
call President Roosevelt. Once she heard FDR come on and say,
'Well, hello, Jim, what can I do for you today?' ``
</P>
<P>
   The governor's office and library still stand _ largely
unchanged from the day of his death on July 15, 1957 _ on the third
floor of the neoclassical building at Fourth and Ludlow streets in
downtown Dayton, where the newspaper's business, editorial and
advertising offices are located. Cox commissioned it in 1908 with
the instructions to architect Albert Pretzinger to construct a
stately structure that looked like a post office, or better yet, a
bank. That year Cox had been flatly rejected for a loan by
Valentine Winters, one of Dayton's most prominent bankers.
</P>
<P>
   Snubbed, Cox replied that he had such faith in the future of the
business that he wouldn't trade it for Winters' bank. The
four-story building, with its tall Greek columns, was completed in
1910, and survived the 1913 flood. (The newspaper also continued to
publish through the ``Time of Terror'' that was the Great Flood,
first printing free handbills from the NCR plant on higher ground,
then setting up a temporary press.)
</P>
<P>
   The hum of the press will soon be gone from the back of the
building, relocated to the new $90 million printing facility being
built on Interstate 75 at Ohio 73 in Franklin. The main offices and
majority of employees will remain downtown, with computer terminals
connected by fiber optic cable to the new plant. The newsroom may
no longer rumble with the start of the presses, but a new era is
beginning, filled with new products and new ways to deliver
information.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to produce a different kind of product for a
different kind of society,'' said Brad Tillson, Gov. Cox's current
successor as publisher of the Dayton Daily News and chief executive
of Cox Ohio Publishing.
</P>
<P>
   Those newly reinvented newspapers, and Internet services like
www.activedayton.com and NewsLine reports, are sure to reach back
into the region's history on occasion. Newspapers, sometimes called
a ``first draft of history,'' are deeply entwined in the
communities they serve, and the newspaper offices, from the
archives to the more recent electronic library are filled with
nearly every story published in the past 100 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The relationship between a community and its newspaper is a
complex, symbiotic one. Newspapers cannot survive without
supportive communities of readers and advertisers. Likewise, good
newspapers contribute to the quality of their communities,''
Tillson wrote in an introduction to a book, ``Dayton Ink ,'' on the
paper's centennial.
</P>
<P>
   Headlines have described every war from the Spanish-American War
to Desert Storm. Politics, of course, got intensive scrutiny, then
as now. Photographs increasingly emerged from the early years to
the present as a way to bring the story to the people. In April
1913, the News ran a panoramic photo across the entire front page
showing the ruins from the flood and ensuing fire that devastated
downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Stories on internationally known Dayton poet Paul Laurence
Dunbar, the Wright brothers and industrialists John Patterson, Col.
Edward Deeds and Charles F. Kettering appeared frequently, although
to Gov. Cox's dismay, as noted in his autobiography, the first
flights of the Wrights at Huffman Prairie did not initially receive
the attention they deserved.
</P>
<P>
   Cox's dictum to bring the nation and the world to his readers
was carried to sports. Sports Editor Si Burick used to joke that
he'd worked at the News for more than 50 years without receiving a
promotion. That was because Cox made him the sports editor in 1925,
when Burick was just 19 years old. From then until his death in
1986 at the age of 77, Burick's byline became known all over the
world, in a class with such famous sports columnists as Red Smith,
Joe Falls and Shirley Povich. Burick traveled the nation and the
world covering major events.
</P>
<P>
   ``Si put Dayton on the map,'' wrote Tom Callahan, a former
sports columnist for the Cincinnati Enquirer.
</P>
<P>
   Part of a newspaper's service to a community is its watchdog
role, and the Dayton Daily News has always taken it very seriously,
from Cox's early battles with NCR founder John H. Patterson to the
Pulitzer Prize-winning series on military doctors in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, David Easterly became the paper's first environmental
reporter. One of his stories documented oils that were running out
of Miami Valley machine shops through storm sewers into the Great
Miami River. Then Easterly found out that Dayton Newspapers was
doing its own polluting. The paper ran the story and corrected the
problem. Easterly, of course, is no longer the environmental
reporter. He is now president of Cox Enterprises and the Atlanta
Journal-Constitution and is based in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Easterly is just one of many editors and executives to pass
through Dayton on their way to the top of the Cox organization.
Chuck Glover, Robert Musselman, Roger Kintzel, Booker Izell, Randy
Preddy, David Scott, Charles Reinhart, Tom Teepen, Bob Sherman,
Gregory Favre, Ed O'Neill, Dan Mahoney, Joe Englert, Brian Cooper,
Jay Smith, Arnold Rosenfeld, Jim Fain all went on to bigger things
with the company.
</P>
<P>
   Their stops at the News were not brief layovers; all spent a
considerable number of years here. While Burick's 60-year career
may stand out, there are many Dayton Daily News employees in all
departments who have shown considerable loyalty to the paper,
racking up careers of 30, 40 and 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   And many are looking forward to the next century.

</HEADLINE>
 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Clinton should resign
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the admission he lied about his relationship with Monica
Lewinsky, President Bill Clinton goes from lame duck to dead duck.
The Clinton presidency is over and the president would do best not
to wait to see if he can hold enough public and congressional
support to linger in office but to resign and let Vice President Al
Gore start a new slate.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has lost all moral authority in the office. That he lied
under oath _ or was only ``legally accurate,'' as he put it _ is of
course a legitimate issue of law but in the politically contrived
circumstances of the lie, pretty thin law. The testimony was
inadmissible in a civil suit filed as a political ploy and thrown
out by the judge as groundless.
</P>
<P>
   Crucially, the president lied to the people, on whose sole
authority his tenure rests, and that is a matter of trust. What is
more, with his dodgy language at first, and now apparently
attempting a silly and hopeless distinction about what is and isn't
sex, he lied by coyness. He compounded brazen dishonesty with the
petty con of a barroom grifter.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, as emotionally slovenly and insanely reckless as his
relations with a White House intern were, we still never should
have known of them. The affair was consensual; no matters of state
were involved. We will be a long time sorting through the
hyperkinetic workings of the special-prosecutor law and the
relentless machinations of Clinton enemies that, combined, finally
accomplished their long-sought end of maneuvering the president
into what amounted to a trap.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Clinton's own manifest misbehavior that was the
proximate cause of this presidency's collapse.
</P>
<P>
   The president's perfidy has put the nation through seven months
of psychodrama. It has financially ruined and emotionally
devastated untold numbers of his associates and has drawn from his
defenders prodigies of dissimulation and rationalization that ought
never been asked, or allowed. We can only guess at the damage to
his family.
</P>
<P>
   Together, Clinton's long retreat through a season pinstriped
with backup lines and Kenneth Starr's hounding excesses have
damaged the institution of the presidency, if not beyond repair
then in ways that it will take a long time to fix. Future
presidents will come less to a magisterial office than to hardened
political bunker.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore is well-prepared for the presidency. A senator for eight
years, he hasn't been the mere time-server many vice presidents
have been but an active partner in the policies of the
administration and in their execution.
</P>
<P>
   He would come to office against a backdrop of Republican efforts
to make his campaign fund-raising molehills into the mountains of
malfeasance, but that game is mainly a partisan move to block a
Gore nomination in 2000. Most Americans recognize Gore as honest
and would accept him as constitutionally authentic in the office.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton has fumbled away his presidency. He nonetheless has
a case to make to history for his accomplishments, but that case
will be better made now from a private den than from a hollowed
public office _ and better made to a nation composed by his
retirement than uneasy over his tenacity.

TUPA GETS A KICK OUT OF A DUAL ROLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Whether he's playing pool with Drew Bledsoe or
Ping-Pong with Scott Zolak, or taking part in a putting contest
with other teammates, Tom Tupa always wins.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great athlete,'' marveled Patriots coach Pete Carroll.
``His movements are so smooth. He's such a cool customer out there.
We're so fortunate to have a guy like that who can punt and protect
us at quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   There were days during training camp when Tupa looked like the
best quarterback on the field. His spirals were tight, his motion
mechanically sound. He threw the long ball with grace and the
sideline pattern with zip. He holds on field goals for Adam
Vinatieri, and has it down to an art. And to watch him punt?
</P>
<P>
   ``He's unbelievable,'' said Carroll. ``He's such a weapon for us
because he can kick them so long and so high. He's very good at
pinning the other team inside the 20. He's one of the best in the
game. To have someone of his athletic ability, that other teams
have to keep their eye on, I mean, he can complete a pass and that
threat is there, and it has to be on their mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Punting is the reason Tupa is a Patriot, but the other part of
the equation is his quarterbacking. Bill Parcells recognized long
ago that to have a punter who can protect you at quarterback meant
saving a roster spot.
</P>
<P>
   Tupa hasn't had much opportunity to show his signal-calling
skills, though. Two years ago, the team ran a fake punt against
Denver, but Tupa's pass to Tedy Bruschi, which would have resulted
in a first down, was dropped.
</P>
<P>
   If Bledsoe and Zolak went down, how would the Patriots fare with
Tupa at the helm?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know about a long-term thing, but I think in the short
term I could get in there and run the offense and do the best I
could,'' Tupa said. ``I prepare as a quarterback. I learn the
playbook, I go through the reps in practice. I think I can still
throw the ball and I've had a lot of rest. It's been a while since
I've been in a regular-season game.''
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-4-inch, 225-pounder has thrown three passes in the
NFL since 1994. His last significant time at quarterback was in
1992 with the Colts, when he completed 17 of 33 passes for 156
yards. With the Arizona Cardinals in 1991, he started 11 games
after starter Timm Rosenbach was hurt. Tupa led the Cardinals to a
4-7 record, completing 52.4 percent of his passes on a bad team. He
had his best day against the Patriots, throwing for three
touchdowns and 312 yards in a 24-10 win.
</P>
<P>
   His professional punting career began in 1989 with the
Cardinals, when he filled in for the injured Rich Camarillo the
last two games of the season.
</P>
<P>
   By 1993, the Cleveland native had signed with Bill Belichick's
Browns. Following the 1995 season, after Belichick was fired by
Cleveland and came to the Patriots, Belichick recommended him to
Parcells, who signed Tupa to a three-year contract.
</P>
<P>
   This past offseason, there was talk by Patriots management of
relieving Tupa of his quarterback duties so he could devote more
time to punting. But that hasn't come to pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never said anything about that, so that was never my
request,'' said Tupa. ``I've never thought the quarterbacking hurt
my punting. For the last three years I've been as good as anyone in
the league. I've always felt it was a valuable thing. I don't think
there have been too many punter/quarterbacks in the league over the
years, so it's unique and that helps the team.''
</P>
<P>
   The last quarterback/punter of great note was Dallas's Danny
White, who did both jobs for many years. The 32-year-old Tupa, in
his 10th year, believes he can do both for some time.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never think you can do something forever, but you look at
Steve DeBerg out there at 44 years old and you hope you're that
lucky,'' he said. ``Zo and I have a good time in practice because
we make a game out of it to see who can complete the most passes.
It makes practices go a little faster for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Tupa is quite comfortable with new coordinator Ernie Zampese's
offense, because he operated in similar ones during the year he
started for Phoenix and also in Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   ``People shouldn't panic that Drew isn't going to get the
offense,'' said Tupa. ``It's just new and different and the timing
with the receivers really does take a few games to get going. I
think by the end of the preseason he'll be fine, and this offense
will click pretty well. You can already see the improvement.''
</P>
<P>
   As for his punting, Tupa said, ``It's going pretty good. I'm
ahead of where I was last year at this time. I'm still trying to
refine myself. Once we get close to the start of the season, I'll
work more on my punting and less on the QB stuff. Right now, I do a
lot of quarterback reps, but before practice Dante Scarnecchia
watches me. He knows my punting stuff real well now, and if I hit a
bad ball he knows.''
</P>
<P>
   Tupa is working on the hang time and direction of his punts.
He's had excellent hang time so far and in two exhibition games
he's already hit three punts more than 60 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Last year he averaged 45.8 yards per punt, a Patriots record. He
led the AFC in average and finished one-10th of a yard behind New
Orleans's Mark Royals for tops in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I just do what I'm capable of doing, I can just keep going
on,'' he said. ``I don't think I need to hit the ball any harder,
but I have to keep refining what I have. I think there's a lot more
bigger-type punters in the league now. Guys year in and year out
who have been in the upper echelon are usually 6-3, 6-4, and some
weigh as much as 240 pounds. The averages are going up. When I
first started there were a couple of guys averaging 45 and 46; now
it seems there are a lot of them around.''
</P>
<P>
   Does quarterbacking help punting?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really know because this is all I've ever known,''
said Tupa. ``I've always had to prepare to be a quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   It certainly helps him in team competitions. A great athlete at
Ohio State, Tupa not only holds the school's career punting record
(44.7 yards per kick), but he also played on the championship
intramural basketball team, along with Keith Byars, Cris Carter,
Pepper Johnson, William White, and Jamie Holland.
</P>
<P>
   Just the other day after practice, several players took part in
a putting contest on a green located just beyond the practice
field.
</P>
<P>
   Tupa sank a 3-footer to win the competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't surprise anyone,'' said Carroll. ``He wins
everything.''

FOR SINGH, PRACTICE MADE PERFECT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE CONCANNON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   REDMOND, Wash. _ There was no rainbow in the sky Sunday, as
there was when Davis Love won the PGA Championship a year ago at
Winged Foot. There was a storm brewing that soon would drench
Salahee CC, just an hour after Vijay Singh walked up the 18th
fairway with his first major victory all but assured. Storm clouds
have hovered over Singh before.
</P>
<P>
   He was suspended for altering a scorecard in the 1985 Indonesian
Open when he was a young player on the Asian Tour, and accused of
leaving unpaid bills behind when he was on the Australian Tour. But
he has compiled a global record of considerable accomplishment, one
that reached its zenith Sunday across the lake from Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   If there were questions about his putting, he answered them by
switching to a cross-handed style in the Western Open two months
ago. It was his putting in Sunday's final round that lifted him to
a 9-under total of 68_271 and a two-shot victory over Steve
Stricker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning a major is something special,'' said Singh, ``because
you only have four chances in a year.''
</P>
<P>
   Singh spoke Sunday night of the influence of Scottish caddie
David Renwick, who carried for Jose Maria Olazabal when he won the
Masters in 1994 and for Steve Elkington when he won the PGA
Championship in 1995 at Riviera.
</P>
<P>
   ``He kept talking to me,'' said Singh. ``We were talking about a
lot of things other than just golf. I told him, `Let's just talk
today, have a conversation, and keep our mind occupied and not just
think about what we're doing on the golf course.' We talked about
horse racing. We talked about a lot of things when we were walking,
and that kept me very calm all day.''
</P>
<P>
   Singh has won five times on the US PGA Tour, including twice a
year ago, at the rain-shortened Memorial and the Buick Open. He has
won 18 times internationally, including the Malaysian PGA
Championship on the Asian Tour in 1984, before the scorecard
incident. He has won the Nigerian Open, the Swedish PGA
Championship, the Ivory Coast Open, the King Hassan Trophy in
Morocco, the South African Open, and the Zimbabwe Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been to Africa, all parts of Asia, India,'' he said. ``I
can't really pick one out. There's been a lot of crazy places I've
been. I think in Africa playing on sand greens in Nigeria, where I
won twice, was a great experience. That's all past and it's all a
learning process.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy to be here. I just hope they had a live feed on this
in Fiji. It's not too many times a golfer in Fiji can win a major
event.''
</P>
<P>
   Fiji, his homeland, is made up of more than 100 islands, and it
is not a rich country. The majority of the population is of Indian
descent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest sport in Fiji is not golf,'' Singh said. ``It's
rugby. Everybody plays rugby there. Golf is just a part-time thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hope that everybody in Fiji has seen this and I hope
I'm a hero in Fiji. I haven't been back for a long time, but when I
go back I'll find out the answer to that question.''
</P>
<P>
   Stricker, whose wife and former caddie, Nicki, is expecting
their first child this month, more or less bowed out of contention
in the PGA when he failed to get up and down out of a trap on the
17th. Thoughts of his wife were an inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe that's part of the reason why I played so well this
week,'' he said. ``Just because of this great thing that's going to
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the last of the major championships in 1998, and they
will be remembered for Mark O'Meara's dominance. He won the Masters
and British Open to become the oldest player, at 41, to win two
majors in a year. O'Meara made a run at Hogan's standard of three
in one year, but bogeys at the sixth, seventh, and eighth Sunday
ended the dream. ``They took the wind out of my sails,'' said
O'Meara, who nevertheless finished a respectable joint fourth, five
back of Singh.
</P>
<P>
   This was the first time a major was held in the Pacific
Northwest since Hogan won the 1946 PGA Championship at Portland
(Ore.) GC. The crowds were enthusiastic, knowledgeable, and in
control.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great course,'' said Love, who stayed in contention and
finished tied for seventh at 70_277.
</P>
<P>
   ``The golf course was set up perfectly,'' said Tiger Woods, who
ended up 71_279. ``The fairways were lush, the greens were perfect,
and the course could have been had if you hit the ball in the right
spots.''

FREE HOUSE BATTLES BACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   No 3-year-old worked harder last year than Free House. The big
gray ran 10 times and finished in the money in all three Triple
Crown events. In the course of compiling a 10-3-2-3 record, the
California-bred son of the modest sire Smokester, who once stood
for a stud fee of $1,500, earned more than $1.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Free House's battles with Silver Charm, who won the Kentucky
Derby and Preakness and was named 3-year-old champion, were
legendary. Leading up to the Triple Crown, Free House beat the more
agile Silver Charm in both the San Felipe and the Santa Anita
Derby, after losing to him in the San Vicente. But Silver Charm was
too good in the chase for the Famed Triad, as Free House finished
third in the Derby and second in the Preakness. When Touch Gold
ended Silver Charm's bid for the Triple Crown by catching him near
the wire in the Belmont Stakes, Free House was a close third.
</P>
<P>
   Silver Charm went on the shelf after the Belmont, but Free House
did not. He won the Swaps in July, ran third in the Haskell in
August, and then his season finally ended when he bled badly while
finishing sixth and last in the Super Derby Sept. 28.
</P>
<P>
   This year, owners Trudy McCaffery and John Toffan, who bred Free
House, and trainer Paco Gonzales kept him idle until the Bel Air
Handicap at Hollywood Park July 11. Free House won his 4-year-old
debut by 7 lengths, but his urine test came back positive for
clembuterol, which is prohibited for racing use.
</P>
<P>
   Clembuterol is a bronchodilator used to treat respiratory
infections. The Federal Drug Administration legalized the drug May
11. In Canada, where the drug has long been legal, the accepted
withdrawal time from a horse's system is 72 hours. However, more
sensitive testing done in the United Sates _ tests designed to
assure that Lasix, an anti-bleeding medication legal for race use,
does not mask clembuterol _ can detect the drug in a horse's system
for up to 13 days.
</P>
<P>
   Some trainers in the United States were confused on the
withdrawal time of the drug, which can be used for training, and
positives began to show up, most notably in Kentucky and
California. On July 30, the California Horse Racing Board announced
that 20 horses had tested positive for clembuterol between May 16
and July 11. Free House was one of them.
</P>
<P>
   The Free House camp has vehemently denied that the horse has
ever been on clembuterol, even if innocently applied. ``I do not
use clembuterol,'' Gonzalez said, flatly. A second test of the
sample has since been ordered. McCaffery was especially upset by
the finding and, while unable to explain the results, said she felt
``helpless,'' believing the results to be inaccurate but having no
way to prove it.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of those bad feelings were alleviated on Sunday, however,
as Free House dominated a top field to capture the $1 million
Pacific Classic at Del Mar. Off at 7-2 ($9.20 to win), Free House
ran right past defending champion Gentlemen, the 6-5 choice as
coupled in an entry with Puerto Madero (who finished sixth), to
score by 4 lengths under Chris McCarron in the time of 2:00 1/5 for
the 1 1/4 miles. Also left in Free House's wake was 3-2 second
choice Touch Gold, who finished fifth. Always a big boy, Free House
is reported to be even bigger this year, and he may have grown into
an absolute monster.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time off helped him a lot,'' said Gonzalez. ``He's a
bigger, stronger horse. He's more mature and relaxed. He trained
better for this than he did for the Bel Air. He came out of that
race in great shape. I knew he was ready.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I cam up alongside Gentlemen turning for home, I knew I
had more horse,'' said McCarron. ``My concern was with Touch Gold,
that's why I looked back. I wanted to see if he was coming at me or
backing up. He was going the right way for us.''
</P>
<P>

 &QL; 
A quick `Skip'
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Skip Away zipped 6 furlongs in 1:10 during a public workout
between the fourth and fifth races at Saratoga Monday. To put the
move in perspective, the fastest 6 furlongs during a race at The
Spa this meeting has been 1:09 3/5, run by Kelly Kip in the A
Phenomenon Stakes. Kelly Kip is the 6-furlong track record-holder
at both Belmont Park and Aqueduct.
</P>
<P>
   Handled by regular rider Jerry Bailey, Skip Away went fractions
of :23 1/5, :46 3/5, and :58 1/5 on the way to his 6-furlong
clocking. He then galloped out 7 furlongs in 1:23 3/5 and was
pulled up after going a mile in 1:43 1/5. Skip Away's efforts were
greeted with applause from the crowd of 52,245, drawn, in part, by
a Skip Away poster giveaway.
</P>
<P>
   ``And they say he doesn't like Saratoga,'' said trainer Sonny
Hine. ``The workout was good. I would have liked to see him go in
1:11, but he always goes quicker than I want him to. It seemed like
he was confused when he heard the crowd and there were no other
horses around him.''
</P>
<P>
   Skip Away, the handicap champion who is 5 for 5 this season, is
training for the $500,000 Iselin Handicap at Monmouth Aug. 30. His
schedule then calls for him to run in the $500,000 Woodward Stakes
Sept. 19 and the $750,000 Jockey Club Gold Cup Oct. 19, both at
Belmont, before finishing his career in the $4 million Breeders'
Cup Classic at Churchill Downs Nov. 7.

</P>
<P>
   Former New York Times racing columnist and New York Racing
Association executive Steven Crist took over the Daily Racing Form
as of last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Crist, who will be both editor and publisher, heads the Alpine
Capital Group, a New York banking investment firm, which purchased
The Daily Racing Form from Primedia for a reported $40 million.
Crist was also editor-in-chief of the short-lived Racing Times, a
paper that originated greatly improved past performance
information. The Daily Racing Form incorporated much of what Crist
developed when it eventually took over the Racing Times.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Daily Racing Form is a very profitable company and has
never lost money,'' said Crist at a press conference at Saratoga.
``It is not an issue of survival. We think this paper has the
potential for a big turnaround. The current management was
hamstrung by the previous owners. We think we can make the product
better and, if so, more people will buy it.''

   MINOR-LEAGUE BASEBALL SERIES
</P>
<P>
   ATTN: SPORTS EDITORS, ESPECIALLY FLA., VA., ORE., GA., S.C.
</P>
<P>
   The journey to the major leagues is a long and difficult one
that few ballplayers survive. The rugged climb up the minor-league
ladder claims most prospects long before they reach the big leagues
_ less than 10 percent of players who sign pro contracts make it to
the majors, even for one day.
</P>
<P>
   To chronicle one team's organization, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution staff writers Guy Curtright and Jack
Wilkinson, with AJC photographer Ben Gray, took a road trip through
the eight-team Atlanta farm system. The Journal-Constitution has
produced an eight-part series, a comprehensive look at one baseball
club's minor-league organization from top to bottom, from the dusty
barrios of the Dominican Republic to AAA ball in Richmond, Va.
</P>
<P>
   The series looks at teams in these cities and leagues:
</P>
<P>
   _ San Pedro de Macoris, Dominican Republic, Dominican Summer
League.
</P>
<P>
   _ Orlando, Gulf Coast League.
</P>
<P>
   _ Danville, Va., Appalachian League.
</P>
<P>
   _ Eugene, Ore., Northwest League.
</P>
<P>
   _ Macon, Ga., South Atlantic League.
</P>
<P>
   _ Danville, Va. (moving to Myrtle Beach, S.C., next season),
Carolina League.
</P>
<P>
   _ Greenville, S.C., Southern League.
</P>
<P>
   _ Richmond, Va., International League.
</P>
<P>
   Following is a budget. The first three days' installments are
moving now; the rest will move daily through the end of this week.
For more information, please call Cox News Service at 404-526-5456.
</P>
<P>
   Day 1:
</P>
<P>
   MINORS-DOMINICAN _ SAN PEDRO DE MACORIS, Dominican Republic _ In
the Dominican there is only one way to avoid a life of hard work
and poverty: baseball. Young boys grow up playing with milk cartons
for gloves and dreaming about being the next Sammy Sosa or Pedro
Martinez. The most promising youngsters are signed at 16 or 17 and
start working their way up beginning in the Dominican Summer
League. All 30 major league clubs have teams in the league. While
in camp, they are fed and housed in barracks. Bonuses and salaries
are very small, but much more than their fathers will ever earn.
Competition is fierce. Only two or three Braves players a year win
a spot for the next season in the U.S. Those that fail in the
minors are sent home in disgrace, a life of poverty almost assured.

   MINORS-DOMINICAN-FACTS _ Facts about the league.
</P>
<P>
   MINORS-TALENT _ The search for baseball talent has gone
international. The Braves have one of the most lavish scouting web
in all of baseball and have players from more than 15 countries in
their minor-league system. But less than 10 per cent of all players
signed make the majors. (Curtright, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   Day 2:
</P>
<P>
   MINORS-GULFCOAST _ ORLANDO, Fla. _ Team is based at the Braves'
spring camp at Disney World, but don't be fooled. There is nothing
magical about this first stop in the minor leagues for most Braves
prospects. Games begin at noon under the blazing Florida sun. No
admission is charged, but a game is lucky to draw 10 fans. There is
that many countries represented on the Braves' 30-man roster.
English classes are held two nights a week. (Curtright, Atlanta

<P>
   MINORS-DANVILLE _ DANVILLE, Va. _ Away from home for the first
time and making $900 a month, young players scrabble to find a
place to live in the Appalachian League. Most stay four to five in
apartments in an attempt to hold down costs. Life can be lonely and
the road trips through the mountains often harrowing. The highlight
of the summer is usually a visit from parents or your girlfriend.

</P>
<P>
   MINORS-EUGENE _ EUGENE, Ore. _ This is as close as most Braves
minor-league signees will get to a big-time atmosphere. Eugene
regularly fills its 6,000-seat stadium from late June through
August. All games are on radio, and TV highlights dominate the
evening news. For the 14th consecutive season, Eugene's season
attendance has been greater than its population. Most players are
in their second season or just out of college. (Curtright, Atlanta

   Day 5:
</P>
<P>
   MINORS-MACON _ MACON, Ga. _ Marcus Giles was taken by Atlanta in
the 53rd round of the 1996 draft and his chances of making a career
in baseball like older brother Brian (Cleveland Indians) appeared
almost nonexistent. But Giles is determinted to prove everyone
wrong. Although less than 5-foot-8, he is threatening the South
Atlantic League in homers and is beginning to improve his play at
second base by constant work with Macon coach Glenn Hubbard.

   Day 6:
</P>
<P>
   MINORS-DANVILLE-MANAGER _ DANVILLE, Va. _ Paul Runge played
briefly in the majors with the Braves, but never made a name for
himself. Now he is trying to get back to the majors as a manager.
But managing in the minors isn't easy. You are paid to develop
players, not win games. But if you lose too much, you never
advance. In the Carolina League this season, Darrell Evans was
fired by the Royals with his team in first place because he was
eschewing player development to win games. (Wilkinson, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution)

</P>
<P>
   MINORS-GREENVILLE _ GREENVILLE, S.C. _ George Lombard was happy
when Aug. 1 arrived. After weeks of hearing he might be traded by
the Braves for needed bullpen help, Lombard knows he still has a
chance to reach the majors in his hometown. After turning down a
football scholarship at Georgia to sign with Atlanta, the private
school graduate struggled for his first four seasons. But now he is
showing the talent that the Braves always thought he would.
(Curtright, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   MINORS-GREENVILLE-CHAPEL _ Baseball Chapel offers spiritual
support to players struggling in the minors. In Greenville, the
weekly services are led by former major leaguers Marty Clary and
Jose Alvarez. (Curtright, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

</P>
<P>
   Day 8
</P>
<P>
   MINORS-RICHMOND _ RICHMOND, Va. _ Richmond is one step from the
majors, but yet unreachable for most of the veterans like Gene
Schall who hang on at AAA for one more chance. Many players are in
their 30s and have families. Yet they make as little as $10,000 a
season and work at whatever job they can find in the winter. Schall
is married and his baby had health problems at birth, forcing him
to stay away from the team. (Wilkinson, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   MINORS-RICHMOND-CHEN _ When the Braves talk trade, Bruce Chen is
always a name that comes up. But the Braves don't want to lose
their top prospect. Chen was recently promoted to Richmond from
Greenville, where he led the league in strikeouts. His story is an
interesting one. He is an Asian who was born and raised in Panama,
and has studied math in the off-season at Georgia Tech. He is
scheduled to begin classes Sept. 23. (Curtright, Atlanta

DATA GENERAL GROOMS CLARIION UNIT TO RIVAL EMC, OTHERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOANN MULLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just as it appeared Data General Corp. was drifting back toward
oblivion, the onetime technology giant is again trumpeting its
turnaround, with a renewed emphasis on its Clariion computer
storage division.
</P>
<P>
   The Westborough, Mass. computer company is pumping resources
into the Clariion unit in a bid to compete more effectively with
storage industry giants such as EMC Corp. of Hopkinton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Data General has some catching up to do.
</P>
<P>
   The company suffered a setback earlier this year because of
a &UR;  &LR; production delay in launching its next generation of computer
storage equipment. As a result, sales of the new systems, featuring
advanced so-called fiber channel technology, didn't grow fast
enough to offset the decline in storage systems that used an older
technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost a year's worth of growth in the market,'' conceded
Joel Schwartz, appointed four months ago as senior vice president
and general manager of Clariion.
</P>
<P>
   Data General has lost money during the past two quarters, and is
expected to fall short of break-even again in the current quarter,
which ends in September, according to analysts polled by First Call
Inc. of Boston. On June 1, the company announced a restructuring
charge of $135 million for the quarter ended in June &UR;  &LR; and said it
would lay off 400 workers.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz contends that production problems have been resolved
and Data General is now shipping a complete line of fiber channel
products.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Once a giant in the minicomputer industry, Data General missed
the shift to desktop computers. But the company revived itself in
1995 by moving to servers based on Intel Corp.'s Pentium
microprocessors. After two years of improved results, the company
fell behind competitors earlier this year because of the slowdown
in its storage business.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Schwartz says Data General has a technology edge over
companies like EMC that will enable Data General to make up ground
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   All computer storage manufacturers are moving toward fiber
channel technology because it allows users to transmit more data
over greater distances, an advantage for companies that must share
information over far-flung computer networks.
</P>
<P>
   But the storage systems sold by most manufacturers feature fiber
channel connections only on the ``front end'' _ between the server
and the storage equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Clariion systems are more advanced, Schwartz said, because they
also use fiber channel technology on the ``back end'' _ to connect
the network of disks inside the storage equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Data General also got a big boost earlier this year when
fast-growing Dell Computer Corp. selected Clariion as its provider
of fiber channel storage products, to be sold under Dell's
PowerVault brand name.
</P>
<P>
   ``We evaluated quite a few potential partners and decided that
Clariion's fiber channel technology was superior to anything else
on the market,'' said Dell spokesman Jim Mazzola.
</P>
<P>
   But while Data General expects the deal with Dell to help it win
significantly more business, it is also hiring its own sales force
that will call directly on corporate customers and sell
Clariion-brand equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, virtually all of Data General's $500 million in
storage system revenue came from computer makers that sold Clariion
machines under their own brand names.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to build up the Clariion brand name, said Schwartz.
</P>
<P>
   Data General also is investing more in software. In the
restructuring announced in June, the company transferred 100
employees to the Clariion division, most of whom work in research
and development.  &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``The Clariion name is well-known in the industry, but not by
the end user,'' Schwartz said. With a direct sales force, more
advertising and more investment in software, he hopes to boost its
brand awareness.

 &HT;    MINOR LEAGUE SERIES: The Dominican Republic is a logical
starting point
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN PEDRO DE MACORIS, Dominican Republic _ First pitch: 10:25
a.m. Game-time temperature: Sizzling. Today's attendance at Estadio
Tetelo Vargas: 56, including two unarmed soldiers in fatigues and
two National Police officers packing pistols.
</P>
<P>
   While the San Pedro de Macoris Braves play the Houston Astros'
Summer League affiliate on the field, the essence of Dominican
baseball skips along a concourse in the stands. Alejandro Michel,
11, is bouncing a baseball off a concrete wall and deftly fielding
it. The ball, its horsehide cover worn off, is just a core wrapped
with white string that's slowly unraveling. On his left hand,
Alejandro wears his glove, which symbolizes both this country's
widespread poverty and its absolute obsession with baseball.
</P>
<P>
   It's a milk carton. An old carton, crushed and folded just so.
The ridges for Alejandro's fingers are visible. Forget Rawlings or
Wilson. As for many Dominican youngsters, his glove is a one-liter
Parmalat model.
</P>
<P>
   It's the same mitt Rafael Belliard and Danny Bautista used as
kids in the Dominican, long before they became Atlanta Braves. ``We
all had them,'' Bautista says.
</P>
<P>
   So did Dario Paulino. ``When I was growing up, that was the kind
of glove I was using,'' said Paulino, 27, once an infielder who
reached Class AA Greenville in the Braves' farm system, for four
years now a coach back home with San Pedro. ``A milk carton. Every
little kid uses it. Only if your father is middle class can you
afford a glove.''
</P>
<P>
   Alejandro's father is not middle class. There's virtually no
Dominican middle class, not even here, 45 miles east of the capital
of Santo Domingo, in this mill town with a population of 120,000
and seven sugar mills. Both of Alejandro's parents work in a hotel.
So he flashes milk carton, not leather. He backhands a short hop
and hopes to one day join the line of major-league San Pedro
shortstops, who are nearly as plentiful as hand-rolled Dominican
cigars.
</P>
<P>
   ``A baseball player,'' Alejandro, a fifth-grader, says when
asked his life's ambition. ``Because I'd be given the opportunity
to get some money for my family.''
</P>
<P>
   Just like Sammy Sosa, who grew up dirt-poor a few blocks from
the downtown stadium and is now chasing home-run history, secure in
his $42.5 million free-agent contract. Sosa has built a spacious
house here for his mother, which backs up to Plaza 30/30, his
three-story office building. The 30/30 includes ``Sammy Club,'' a
subterranean disco; ``Hit Bar,'' a tavern; and a courtyard fountain
in which stands a life-sized statue of Sammy at the bat that looks
nothing like Sammy in the flesh.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa is Alejandro's favorite player. ``Because he's from here,''
Alejandro said, ``and I like the way he plays.'' So Alejandro plays
as children here always have: nonstop, passionately, hoping to get
off the island and reach the big leagues.
</P>
<P>
   For today's Dominican League game, two of the most interested
observers are in the grandstand behind home plate. Deric Ladnier
and Jose Martinez are wearing Atlanta Braves polo shirts and
clicking their stopwatches incessantly. In front of them sits a
Braves pitcher aiming a JUGS gun so Ladnier and Martinez can gauge
the velocity of the starting pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``They play,'' said Ladnier, the Braves' director of
minor-league operations. ``I mean they play. That's the difference
between the kids in the States and here. In the U.S., they have all
these other things: basketball, football, movies, all these
luxuries. They don't have that here. They have baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you come down here and you're looking for baseball
players and you see people playing on street corners and in fields,
you think, `What a great place to come. They play.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unbelievable to come over to this country,'' said
Martinez, 57, a former major-league player from Cuba in his 39th
year of professional baseball. As the special assistant to the
general manager for player development, Martinez is John
Schuerholz's most valued Latin American liaison. ``Everywhere you
go, you see a guy playing baseball. I've never seen it like this
anywhere (else) in Latin America. Everywhere you go, baseball.
Being Spanish myself, that's the hope they've got for getting ahead
in life. I don't know if it's the right thing to say, but I don't
think they're interested in going to school.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the economy, the kids here have to go to work to help the
family. But this is their hope. Baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why hope swings eternal at the fastball, on the parched
fields and barrio street corners, in the vacant lots, anywhere kids
stuff a pair of socks and hit it with a bat that's sometimes a
broom handle, sometimes a tree branch. That's why Alejandro Michel
catches a frayed-string baseball with a milk carton, in range of a
JUGS gun.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hit the whole spectrum of baseball here,'' Ladnier said.
``Technology to ingenuity.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, 107 years after two Cubans brought the game to the
island, baseball talent here is as abundant as sugar cane. Despite
a population of just eight million and an area about the size of
West Virginia, the Dominican Republic had 89 major-leaguers in
1997, second only to California. Of the 1,200 players on 40-man
major-league rosters when spring training opened in February, 111
were Dominicans _ compared with 12 in 1968, when big-league scouts
were first scouring the island for talent.
</P>
<P>
   The galaxy of Dominican stars, past and present, is luminous.
The three Alou brothers. Juan Marichal. Ex-Braves Rico Carty,
Rafael Ramirez and Alejandro Pena. Pedro Guerrero. George Bell,
Joaquin Andujar and Julio Franco. Raul Mondesi and Montreal's
Guerrero brothers, Vladimir and Wilton. There were four Dominicans
in this year's All-Star Game: Sosa, Cleveland's Bartolo Colon and
Manny Ramirez, and Pedro Martinez, last year's NL Cy Young winner,
who signed a $75 million contract last winter with Boston, the
richest in baseball history.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez and Sosa are idolized here, for their humility, their
play and their paychecks. ``Here in San Pedro, people see baseball
as (a means) to be rich soon,'' Paulino said. ``It's the only way
to work hard and be rich.'' And when players fail? ``It's very,
very hard. They look at this as the way to get out of the poor
life.''
</P>
<P>
   That path begins with the baseball academies, and teams, that
all 30 major-league teams operate in the Dominican. Atlanta has had
a team here since the summer league was formed in 1985, practicing
and playing in the old downtown stadium. Players can sign when
they're 16 and play three years _ both summer and winter ball _
from ages 17-19. Many are often referred by buscones, or
``finders,'' bird-dog scouts who usually receive from $250 to $500
if a team signs a player.
</P>
<P>
   Like labor here, baseball talent is cheap and plentiful.
Dominican players traditionally have signed for bonuses in the
$2,000-$3,000 range, but that is changing. In separate bidding wars
after both players were found to have signed early with other
teams, Toronto signed a Dominican shortstop named Josephang
Bernhardt for $1.1 million in January 1997. Earlier this year, the
Yankees signed pitcher Ricardo Aramboles to a $1.52 million bonus.
</P>
<P>
   ``So it's all gone up,'' said Pedro Gonzalez, 58, the
ex-major-league infielder now in his 27th year in the Atlanta
organization, the last five in his hometown as GM and manager of
the San Pedro de Macoris Braves. ``But believe me, for $100,000 you
could sign 10 quality players for $10,000 each.''
</P>
<P>
   Dominicans are exempt from baseball's amateur draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other great thing about here is, you can sign 'em,''
Ladnier said. ``You don't have to wait for the draft.''
</P>
<P>
   There are 35 players, 30 of them active, on the Braves' summer
league roster, usually 30 to 32 for the winter league. It is
low-level rookie league ball, the lowest rung on Atlanta's
eight-team farm ladder.
</P>
<P>
   The summer league has a 72-game schedule, running June through
August. Teams play six mornings a week and take Sundays off.
There's a 70-game winter schedule from late October to early
February. Most players earn $850 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, 23 players _ 21 from other parts of the country and
two Venezuelans _ live in the San Pedro Braves ``dorm,'' a spare,
three-story building in the heart of the city at 104 Avenida
General Cabral. Right next door at No. 102: Pedro Gonzalez's house.
Local players live at home.
</P>
<P>
   At the dorm, players arise at 7 each morning for breakfast. By
8:30, they're on the field at the stadium, taking batting practice,
then infield and outfield, working on fundamentals. Games begin at
10:30, followed by running and conditioning. The locker room is
bare-bones, with a few free weights and exercise machines and no
showers. Players shower back at the dorm, where two cooks prepare
three meals a day; local players may eat there, too. A typical
lunch: rice, ladled with beef and beans from a huge pot, a salad
and water.
</P>
<P>
   In the afternoons, players take English classes twice a week and
an occasional social-skills class, lift weights or nap. ``They put
in a full day,'' Ladnier said.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to improve sufficiently to warrant a promotion to
the U.S. and justify using one of Atlanta's 28 visas for the
organization. ``They're a precious commodity,'' Ladnier said of the
visas. ``You've got to pick the right one.''
</P>
<P>
   Major-league teams must re-apply annually for visas; this year's
range is 23-30 per club. Ladnier said only one or two of the
Braves' Dominican players each year are promising enough to get a
visa. No player has ever started with the Dominican Braves and
worked his way through the farm system to reach Atlanta. Odaliz
Perez, 20, a left-hander from Las Matas de Farfan who was signed at
16 and recently was promoted to Class AAA Richmond, is one of
Atlanta's top three prospects and the most successful Dominican
signee by the Braves to date. He did not play in the summer league.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even without a home-grown, north-to-Atlanta success story,
signing and nurturing players here is a necessity. ``You have to,''
Ladnier said. ``It still comes down to the same thing. If you sign
the best players, you've got the best chance.''
</P>
<P>
   All kinds of players. Such as Hector Francisco, a catcher from
Esperanza who plays because, he said, ``I love baseball and to help
my mother financially.'' But Francisco is now 19, in his third
season and far more likely to get released than to get a visa after
this year. If so, ``I'll keep practicing (baseball) and be a
mechanic,'' said Francisco, the only wage-earner in his family.
</P>
<P>
   Players such as Miguel Bernard, 17, a converted third baseman
and promising catcher who lives on Calle O in the Restauracion
barrio, about a 10-minute walk from the ballpark where he first
watched games at the age of 7. ``It's my job, and I like this,''
said Bernard, who says he earns $400 a month. ``Baseball's the game
of the country, a culture game.''
</P>
<P>
   As a kid, Bernard sometimes broke wooden legs off tables to use
as a bat and hit bottle-cap balls. Calle O is an unpaved, dirt
road, but Bernard's house _ where he lives with his mother, Lydia,
and sister _ is neat, one of the nicest in the barrio and the only
two-story home. And if he doesn't succeed at baseball?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll return to the university and study architecture,''
Bernard said before walking around the corner to Calle K, where a
crowd has gathered to watch six barefoot boys play beisbol in the
street with a broken bat now sawed down the middle and a
stuffed-sock ball.
</P>
<P>
   And such players as Juan Santana, 18, a right-handed pitcher and
San Pedro's starter on the morning the Braves got to Boca Chica to
play Toronto's affiliate.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves drive 45 minutes along the coast highway in their
bus, an old Blue Bird Co. bus painted blue, without
air-conditioning or any working gauges. Turning off the highway,
the bus bumps slowly along a pot-holed dirt lane, passing goats,
chickens and dogs, past dilapidated shacks built from cinder blocks
or wood scraps. The dirt path then eases past cow pastures and
undergrowth before turning left to a gated entrance with a sign:
``Las Americas Baseball Academy.''
</P>
<P>
   Opened in 1997, the $1.6 million complex was built by the
Arizona Diamondbacks and Toronto Blue Jays and houses both clubs'
Dominican-league players in a huge dormitory with two roof-top
satellite TV dishes. Each team has two playing fields at the
four-diamond complex. The crowd consists of scouts and players
sitting in a tower in the middle of the four fields.
</P>
<P>
   Under a blazing Caribbean sun, Santana starts strongly, working
two scoreless innings. At 6 feet 3, he now weighs 170 pounds, up
from 160 when he signed at 16. Thanks to better nutrition and
weight training, his fastball has improved 3 mph to the 87-88
range. ``Ten pounds and three miles an hour,'' Ladnier said. ``Put
on another 10 pounds, it might be 91-92.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Ladnier, ``None of these are guys who you're going
to say, 'Let's consider them for our top 10 prospects.' But some
have better tools than others. But none make you stand up and go,
'Wow!' ''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Santana is pitching well until the third inning, when
he's knocked around, gives up six runs and departs with the bases
loaded. He then ices down his shoulder with some newly crushed ice;
trainer Jose Gil puts some ice cubes into a cut-off, taped-up
portion of a uniform pants leg, then pounds it with a sawed-off bat
barrel before pouring it into a plastic bag for Santana's shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   After the three-hour, 10-3 loss, Santana is quiet on the bus
ride home. He eats lunch at the dorm and accompanies two visitors
in a taxi to Bernard's house. Then the cab cautiously snakes
through the dirt alleys of Santana's barrio, Juan Pablo Duarte.
Naked babies play in the dirt outside shacks. Stray dogs pick
through the garbage that is everywhere. The cabbie, Tulio Mercedes,
avoids huge potholes still filled with day-old rainwater.
</P>
<P>
   There, on the right side of Calle Elia Gonzalez, is Santana's
home, a tiny, two-room cinderblock hovel he's shared with his
mother and aunt for five years. Still wearing his game uniform, his
blue satin Braves warmup jacket buttoned to the neck, Santana gives
a quick tour. He lives behind the little kitchen, in a bedroom
built from pieces of wood. He can lie on his bed and watch baseball
on a little TV. On the wall hangs a color action photo of himself,
in full windup.
</P>
<P>
   In the backyard, Santana's aunt wields a butcher knife, sawing
the jawbone off a cow's head. That explains the mysterious contents
of the pot on the stove. Cow's brains.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, when asked to describe his pitching style, Santana had
grinned and said, ``Like Pedro Martinez.'' Now, he says goodbye.
While slowly navigating Calle Elia Gonzalez, Tulio Mercedes gazes
about him. ``San Pedro de Macoris,'' the taxi driver says. ``Mucha
pobreza.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes. Much poverty in San Pedro. But much baseball, too. Here,
where it's 335 feet down the lines, 385 to center and light-years
to Atlanta, hope floats on the cool tradewinds and every blessed
at-bat.

 &HT;    MINOR LEAGUE SERIES: It's a global game now
 &HT;    By Guy Curtright
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The world is indeed shrinking. At least when it comes to the
search for major-league baseball prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are very few places on the globe now where teams aren't
actively pursuing potential players,'' Atlanta Braves general
manager John Schuerholz said. ``Maybe Iceland or Antarctica, but
I'm not sure a scout hasn't been there.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta has players under contract from 15 countries, plus
Puerto Rico. The 40-man roster includes 11 players born outside the
continental United States, slightly more than the major-league
average. The minor-league system is more than 30 percent
foreign-born, with players from the Dominican Republic, Venezuela,
Nicaragua, Colombia, Panama, Mexico, Brazil, South Korea,
Netherlands Antilles, Australia, New Zealand, Aruba and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten years ago, we were in the Dominican and Mexico, but that
was about it,'' said Paul Snyder, the Braves' director of scouting
and player development. ``Our scouting efforts have probably
quadrupled in the '90s. Now we're all over South America and in the
Far East, even Europe. It has really exploded.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball has finally caught up with the times,'' said Bill
Clark, the Braves' director of international scouting. ``Talent is
talent, no matter where it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta was in the forefront of international scouting, along
with the Dodgers and Yankees. ``It became a point of emphasis for
us,'' Schuerholz said.
</P>
<P>
   Every team is in on the talent search now. With only the United
States, Puerto Rico and Canada covered by the annual June draft,
the rest of the world is wide open to the most persistent or
highest-bankrolled scouts.
</P>
<P>
   Bonuses to foreign players were modest until 1993, when the
Braves gave $950,000 to Glenn Williams, a 16-year-old shortstop
from Australia. Now bidding wars are common.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no bargains out there anymore,'' said Snyder, who
has more than 25 foreign-based scouts.

 &HT;    MINOR LEAGUE SERIES: Danville players making it on their own
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DANVILLE, Va. _ In time, Doug Dent's preparation might become a
model for the Appalachian League. What better training than a
two-year Mormon mission in a remote town on an island in the
Philippines?
</P>
<P>
   ``This is probably better than some of the living conditions
over there,'' Dent said.
</P>
<P>
   In the town of Naga, he slept on a foam mattress, boiled his
drinking water, washed clothes by hand.
</P>
<P>
   Here, Dent rents a two-bedroom, one-bathroom, $500-a-month
apartment with four other Danville Braves pitchers. Starters
Derrick Truitt and Justin Willoughby share one bedroom, relievers
Mike Gray and Pat Schmidt another. The living room couch? That's
where Dent dreams nightly of the big leagues and sleeps quite
comfortably for someone who's 6-feet-8.
</P>
<P>
   The cramped quarters, lack of privacy, lone toilet, monthly
cable TV and phone bills and sporadic attempts at home cooking are
minor inconveniences. Here, Appy-ness is a radar gun reading of 90
mph and roomies who can relate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all get along,'' Willoughby said about life in Apt. D-37.
``We root for each other. They're our brothers, our family away
from home.''
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to Danville, home of the D-Braves, Atlanta's advanced
rookie-level team and the third stop up the organizational food
chain. Almost everything here is named the Dan something-or-other.
Even the ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   The Dan _ Dan Daniels Memorial Park _ sits on the Dan River and
offers $1 hot dogs, $2.25 24-ounce beers, $6 box seats and 50-cent
scorecards that include Baseball Bingo cards. At every home game,
one lucky fan wins a free dry cleaning.Elliott's Cleaners. Making
your world cleaner one garment at a time.
</P>
<P>
   And for every day of the 2 1/2-month, 68-game Appy season, the
D-Braves have to improve themselves one game at a time while
learning to live on their own. At least they are allowed to bring
their cars, which is not the case in the Gulf Coast League.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my first time away from home,'' said Truitt, 20, a
right-hander who pitched two years of junior-college ball in his
hometown of Columbia, Tenn., and signed with Atlanta after the
Braves picked him in the 24th round of the June draft. ``It's
different. You don't have mom and dad there to give you money. You
have to learn how to wash clothes for the first time. You have to
learn how to live with different types of people, too, from all
over the world. You may not live with 'em in the apartment, but on
the road you may have to room with a Latino. You have to learn to
cope.''
</P>
<P>
   For a decade, from the Mathews Motors Little League team through
Columbia Central High and then Columbia State, Truitt threw it to
one catcher, Todd Bell. Now he's coping with three new catchers,
four new roommates and 25 new teammates and pitching inside to
stronger, more disciplined hitters wielding wooden bats. He broke
up with his girlfriend, the 9 1/2-hour drive home proving too far
for comfort.
</P>
<P>
   Gray took the opposite approach. ``I got engaged a week before I
came here,'' said the 21-year-old, whose fiancee is back home in
California, where Gray pitched in junior college. ``So it's been
tough but not too tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Mainly because Gray uses a major coping device of the modern-day
minor-leaguer: prepaid phone cards. For $10, you can talk for 95
minutes; for $20, 190.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had a normal phone bill,'' he said, ``it would probably
be awful.''
</P>
<P>
   If not disconnected. But then, young minor-leaguers must learn
not only how to throw or hit a changeup but also how to budget.
Especially in reconciling a small paycheck and a big appetite. The
D-Braves' average salary is $900 a month; they're paid every two
weeks. Unlike the Braves' Gulf Coast Rookie team in Orlando, the
D-Braves must pay housing costs. Food is the next big budget item,
home and away.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest adjustment is eating,'' said Gray, who likes being
able to sleep in for the nightly 7 o'clock games, ``not having
home-cooked meals.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that they haven't tried in D-37. ``I'm the cook,''
Willoughby said proudly. His specialities? ``I cooked spaghetti. I
cooked the Hamburger Helper.'' One night, he offered exotic fare,
meat from a hunting trip last winter near his hometown of
Princeton, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to get Derrick to eat some deer steak,'' Willoughby
said. ``He put it in his mouth _ and headed to the trash can.''
</P>
<P>
   On overnight road trips, anywhere from two to five hours, the
D-Braves _ who travel in a modern, air-conditioned bus with three
TV screens _ get $15 a day meal money. For ``commutes,'' shorter
trips of 30 to 45 minutes when the team returns home after each
game, the per diem is $7.50. The longer the trip, the quicker the
per diem can disappear.
</P>
<P>
   The D-Braves stay at modest motels chosen for location as well
as for good rooms and rates. Because players can't afford cab fare,
they eat at restaurants within walking distance of the motel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever's closest,'' Gray said. ``Usually fast food. You eat
too many good meals, your money runs out.''
</P>
<P>
   Truitt tries to eat breakfast daily. ``It's important,
energy-wise,'' said Truitt, who eats again at 3:30 before going to
the ballpark. ``After the game is awful. Sometimes, games aren't
over 'til 10. We don't get back to the motel 'til 10:30, 10:45.
Everything closes at 10:30 or 11. One night we had to go to
Kroger's and eat a frozen ham sub.''
</P>
<P>
   In July, the D-Braves hit the road for nine days, their longest
road trip of the season. ``We had $135 to last us nine days,'' said
Truitt, who also brought along his paycheck of $230. By trip's end,
he'd spent all of his meal money and half his take-home pay.
</P>
<P>
   None of it bothers Dent, 21, who pitched at the University of
Utah, was drafted in the 13th round in 1997 and signed this summer
after returning from the Philippines. After not pitching for a
year-and-a-half, the right-handed starter reported to Orlando for
two weeks after signing, then came here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It actually feels like baseball for the first time,'' Dent
said. ``The crowd. The first time they played the national anthem
was nice. I'd forgotten that. They don't do that in the Gulf Coast
League.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably the biggest difference for most of these players is
every day,'' said D-Braves manager Franklin Stubbs, the ex-Dodger
in his first year as a minor-league manager. ``You've got to play
every every day. Most of 'em are used to playing three days a week,
maybe four. Their bodies aren't used to this.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen guys after 30 games hit that wall. You can see it.
Guys go, `Whoa!' You ask them how they're doing, they say, `Tired.'
I say, `Tired? You're 19!' ''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, 19, and on the couch, on your own, often for the first
time. ``You definitely find out a lot about yourself in the first
few weeks,'' said Schmidt, 19, of Bellefontaine, Ohio. ``You find
out if you love baseball.''

 &HT;    MINOR LEAGUE SERIES: Surviving the Gulf Coast League can be
tricky
 &HT;    By Guy Curtright
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO _ The team is based at Atlanta's spring-training home on
the edge of Disney World. But there is nothing big league or
magical about the Gulf Coast League, where most Braves hopefuls get
their first bittersweet taste of professional baseball under the
searing Florida sun.
</P>
<P>
   Games are played at noon in virtual privacy on a shadeless
practice field, not before screaming fans at the Braves' Wide World
of Sports Stadium nearby. And even if they had the time to make
regular visits, Disney World is out of the price range of most
players, who make just $850 a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a player can survive this, the rest seems almost easy as he
moves up,'' manager Rick Albert said. ``This league is a real
grind. It's a rude awakening.''
</P>
<P>
   As Johnny McGinnis prepares to deliver his first pitch, the
temperature under the noonday sun is already nearly 100 degrees and
the sapping humidity makes it feel even worse. The non-crowd
numbers five, including a groundskeeper watching from on top of his
mower near the third-base dugout. There is no national anthem,
because there is no sound system or flag hanging in centerfield.
The only cheering during the game comes from a youth-league
tournament game on a nearby field.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to get pumped up,'' said McGinnis, a lefthander who
was drafted in the fourth round in June after graduating from
Dacula High School in Gwinnett County. ``All your life, you are
used to having people cheer for or against you when you play. Now
you are in pro baseball, and there is no one.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bad teams in Little League have more people watching them than
we do,'' said Greg Dukeman, a relief pitcher from Long Beach,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   But the Gulf Coast League wasn't designed to draw crowds. The
goals always has been to develop young players in a
non-intimidating environment. Games are free and start as early as
possible to avoid Florida's regular late-afternoon thunderstorms.
Braves players get up shortly after dawn and board a bus for away
games on trips that last as long as five hours round trip. Games
are played Monday through Saturday, with Sundays off.
</P>
<P>
   Major-league stars Chipper Jones, Tom Glavine and Javy Lopez
each played his first minor-league season in the Gulf Coast League,
when the Atlanta team was based at Bradenton. The memories linger.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was terrible,'' Lopez remembers. ``No fans. Nothing to do
after the games. I got homesick after a couple of weeks. It wasn't
fun at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones said, ``The only thing I can liken it to, from what my dad
tells me about being in the Army, is boot camp.''
</P>
<P>
   Players are picked up at the nearby Days Inn Suites at 7:45 a.m.
and are expected to be on the field for workouts before home games
no later than 8:30 a.m. There is a break at 11 a.m. for a sandwich,
and the game begins at noon. Extra base-running or fielding
practice occasionally is held after games. The players, who have
kitchens in their suites, are on their own for supper. Curfew is 11
p.m., expect for midnight on Saturday. The fine is $25 for missing
the curfew the first time and doubles with each additional
violation.
</P>
<P>
   But players say missed curfews aren't common. First-year players
can't bring their cars, so they basically are confined to the
hotel. And a 10-hour day in the Florida heat leaves little energy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most nights I'm asleep by 11,'' said outfielder Ryan
Langerhans, a third-round draft pick from Round Rock, Texas, who
received near first-round bonus money ($775,000) to pass up a
scholarship to the University of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We only play 60 games,'' Albert, the manager, said, ``but it's
still a long season.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They aren't used to playing everyday,'' Albert said. ``Some
teams draft a lot of college players, but not the Braves. We take
mostly high-school kids and teach them to play our way. They
usually struggle a little at first, but potentially you get better
players in the long run. Sometimes, a feel like a first-grade
teacher. I just hope they remember me when they make it to the
majors.''
</P>
<P>
   Albert and his staff not only have to teach 18-year-olds how to
play the Braves way, but in many cases how to adjust to a different
country and a strange language.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves' 30-man Gulf Coast League active roster this season
has included players from 10 countries _ the United States, the
Dominican Republic, Venezuela, Nicaragua, Colombia, Panama, Mexico,
Brazil, South Korea and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Albert doesn't speak Spanish, so he relies heavily on coaches
Edison Renteria _ a Columbian and brother of the Marlins' Edgar
Rentera _ and Eddie Watt. To help players adjust off the field,
English classes are held two nights a week. The instructor is Lana
Hausterman, a native of Colombia and the wife of team
administrative assistant Dave Hausterman.
</P>
<P>
   Langerhans and McGinnis _ the top two draft choices on the team
_ share a two-room suite with Jung Bong, an 18-year-old from Seoul,
South Korea. He was spotted by the Braves during an international
youth tournament in Canada and signed to a six-figure bonus after
his family was assured that he would be allowed to finish high
school.
</P>
<P>
   Bong lived with an aunt, Mi Sook Kim, in Norcross last school
year and attended Masters Christian in DeKalb County. He admits his
English still has a ways to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's getting better,'' he said. ``I can understand more now.''
</P>
<P>
   Bong, who dreams of becoming the next Chan Ho Park, and McGinnis
both rank in the top 10 in earned run average in the league.
However, wins are hard to come by in the GCL, where starters rarely
go the required five innings early in the season to get credit for
a victory. But they do pitch long enough to get a loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've pitched OK, but my record doesn't look like it,'' said
McGinnis, who lost his first four decisions before getting his
first win last week.
</P>
<P>
   But statistics are virtually ignored in the league. Batting
averages can be as misleading as won-loss records.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of us are swinging wood bats for the first time and
facing better pitchers than we've ever seen,'' said outfielder
Damien Jones, a former Alabama high-school football star. ``It's
like starting with two strikes against you. It's really a learning
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   The chance to teach raw players the game away from the usual
glare of pro baseball is what pitching coach Watt enjoys about the
league.
</P>
<P>
   ``A player needs a place to break in where he can fail without
having fans boo him or having to read about how bad he is in the
paper,'' the former major-league reliever said. ``This is where you
learn the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Most players escape the Gulf Coast League after one season.
Catcher Scott Frawley wasn't so lucky. This is his second year and
he is one of the older players at 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``You definitely don't want to be here two seasons,'' said
Frawley, who loses nearly 10 pounds every game he catches because
of the heat. ``This is really the bottom of the ladder. There is
nowhere to go but up. When I signed, I expected to be playing
before crowds and under the lights. I haven't done any of that yet.
Sometimes it is hard to believe this is pro ball.''

   ARRAZOLA, Mexico _ He's the father of slithering serpents, giant
crabs, a ram with curled horns and sensual, almost human muscles.
</P>
<P>
   All his animals, says Claudio Ojeda, spring from the corners of
his mind and the chunks of wood his hands whittle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's spontaneous,'' the Mexican wood carver and Zapotec Indian
insists.
</P>
<P>
   But Ojeda also admits he finds inspiration in the hallucinogenic
mushrooms some Indians in this southern Mexican state consume for
spiritual and curative purposes.
</P>
<P>
   A beefy, friendly man who is proud of his craft and his
heritage, Ojeda is one of this village's most prosperous and
talented wood carvers.
</P>
<P>
   The village is Arrazola, and the state is Oaxaca (Wah-HA-ka),
where Zapotec and other Mexican Indians still reign when it comes
to culture.
</P>
<P>
   Seven miles southwest of the colonial city of Oaxaca, Arrazola
is home to a beloved Mexican craft: the production of
``animalitos,'' figures carved from the local copal tree and
painted in riotous colors.
</P>
<P>
   Carving is a centuries' old tradition, but in recent years the
artisans of Arrazola have elevated the art to a globally-desired
commodity. Their figures are sought by buyers from Europe, Asia and
all over the Americas.
</P>
<P>
   Most are small enough to fit on a shelf, but wild enough to
attract instant attention. Horses sprout wings, as if ready to take
flight. Dogs with florid coats throw back their heads and howl.
Rabbits play congas or blow trumpets.
</P>
<P>
   The animals carved by Ojeda and painted by his wife, Teresa, are
noted for their large size -- some are two feet tall or wide -- and
exquisite detail.
</P>
<P>
   When he began carving in earnest 10 years ago, Ojeda
experimented by fashioning one large animal instead of many small
ones. The piece sold quickly and fetched a high price. Now Ojeda
can show off a thick wad of business cards from international
buyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father carved, too,'' Ojeda said. ``But he couldn't even
eat from what he sold.''
</P>
<P>
   Ojeda has sold pieces to Disney World in Orlando, galleries in
Chicago and the San Francisco Bay Area, and diplomatic offices in
Texas. He's been asked to exhibit in Hong Kong and his pieces
decorate homes from New York to Paris to Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still raise some corn and beans. But we pretty much
dedicate ourselves to artisan work now,'' said Teresa Ojeda. As she
spoke, she was painstakingly decorating a large tortoise with three
frogs poised on its shell.
</P>
<P>
   As you approach Arrazola, you pass carts driven by oxen and
farmers carrying machetes. You begin to see signs in English and
Spanish inviting you into homes where the animals figures are
carved and sold.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, a cluster of boys greets you at the edge of town,
offering to accompany you to a favorite carver's house for a few
pesos.
</P>
<P>
   Arrazola's prosperity is striking. The roads are paved, the
houses sturdy, satellite dishes are perched on roofs to pick up
television stations.
</P>
<P>
   Claudio Ojeda drives a pick-up and his home is equipped with a
shower and modern bathroom, startling amenities in an Indian
community.
</P>
<P>
   But the Ojedas' workshop remains a traditional family affair. In
a studio behind sliding glass doors, the couple invite customers in
to browse.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike smaller animals, which run under $10, the Ojedas' animals
don't come cheap. Most are the equivalent of $40 and up, sometimes
pushing into the hundreds. But that's a fraction of a U.S. gallery
price, and, by visiting, you get to see the full range of the
couple's creativity.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the studio, a dragon sports a tail that has metamorphosed
into a snake. A crab with bulging eyes seems to scuttle across the
floor, unaware of the reptile perched on its back. Hippopotamuses,
lobsters, and all sorts of other creatures find their way out of
the wood.
</P>
<P>
   Teresa Ojeda is from a village where the pre-Hispanic tradition
of hallucinogenic mushrooms is still revered. She and her husband
both say mushrooms have given them visions of animals and colors
leaping and fusing. Neither takes this tradition lightly, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have a strong mind,'' Claudio said. ``But it's
something mystical. Scientists can't understand it.''
</P>
<P>
   HOW TO VISIT: In Oaxaca city, hire a taxi, take a city bus or a
tour many hotels offer to Arrazola, where you can browse at the
Ojedas' on Emiliano Zapata Street, or, for smaller animals, at
other families' workshops.

<P>
   SAN BARTOLO COYOTEPEC, Mexico _ A special place in the hills
here has been yielding light gray clay for thousands of years.
</P>
<P>
   And the people of San Bartolo Coyotepec, a village in Mexico's
Oaxaca (Wah-HA-ka) state, still harvest it and shape it into bowls
and figurines -- much the same as their ancestors did.
</P>
<P>
   But since 1953, the Zapotec Indians here have given their
pottery a different spin. That's when a tiny, wizened local potter
named Dona Rosa discovered that she could give the subdued black
color of her oven-baked pots a lustrous shine -- simply by rubbing
unfinished pieces with a quartz stone before their final firing.
</P>
<P>
   ``People loved it. And today, thanks to Dona Rosa, people can
live from their art,'' says the now famous potter's son, Valente
Nieto Real, 70, whose family is among the top producers of Mexico's
popular ``black pottery.''
</P>
<P>
   The home of black pottery is San Bartolo Coyotepec, and it is
seven miles south of the colonial city of Oaxaca.
</P>
<P>
   The village is a well-known tourist destination, but it has
managed to retain its small-town character. The families who make
black pottery welcome visitors into their shops to browse and buy;
at Dona Rosa's workshop, her family also offers demonstrations
showing how they make their pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Small pieces of black pottery are often sold in Mexican art
galleries in the United States. But a visit to San Bartolo
Coyotepec, which is an easy drive down Oaxaca's Highway 175, offers
tourists from all over the world a chance to see and purchase
pieces hard to find abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our parents showed us where the clay is, and their parents
showed them,'' said Nieto Real, as he eagerly demonstrated how he
shapes clay into large round pots, pitchers, candlesticks and other
shapes.
</P>
<P>
   The classic pieces of black pottery are orbs with fluted edges,
and they range from a few inches to nearly two feet tall. Many of
them are decorated with flowers or perforated with exquisite lacy
designs, so that you can place a candle in them that reflects beads
of light.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the pots, which range in price from less than a dollar
up to $40, are scored with elaborate designs that resemble South
Pacific tattoos.
</P>
<P>
   Dona Rosa's family ships pots to Mexico City for a modest price.
Shipping to the United States is very expensive, so if you really
want a pot be sure to leave room in your luggage for safe packing.
</P>
<P>
   The clay the villagers harvest -- and protect with municipal
taxes -- is placed in a tub of water and strained through a sieve
to rid it of debris, explained Nieto Real.
</P>
<P>
   He picked up a slab of clay and slapped it on a pre-Hispanic
potter's wheel: a clay plate that spins with another plate turned
upside down on top of it.
</P>
<P>
   Even the tools the potter's use are mostly pre-Hispanic, Nieto
Real said, grasping the clay, expertly turning it into a hollow
cylinder and inflating it by hand into an orb. Other than skilled
hands, the potters' tools include wooden sticks and clay discs
shaped like moons.
</P>
<P>
   The pieces must be dried for several days before they can be
decorated or before handles can be attached. The laborious process
includes rubbing the pots with quartz that comes from the same
hills as the clay, to give them their characteristic black shine.
</P>
<P>
   Shiny black pots are porous and cannot hold water, Nieto Real
said, so buyers should beware. But the traditional gray-black pots,
which some people still make here, had been used for centuries for
water or as vessels for mescal, the local hard liquor.
</P>
<P>
   Nieto Real is proud that figures of gods and goddesses made from
the same clay he uses have been unearthed from Monte Alban, the
majestic Zapotec Indian ruins near his village.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our culture,'' Nieto Real said, pointing at the clay.
</P>
<P>
   HOW TO GET THERE: Hire a taxi in downtown Oaxaca, take a city
bus or sign up for a tour at your hotel to go San Bartolo
Coyotepec, where signs point the way to Dona Rosa's shop on Benito
Juarez Street.

 &HT;    RUGS WOVEN FROM NATURE AND TRADITION MAKE OAXACAN VILLAGE A
FAVORITE TRIP
 &HT;    With MEXICO-ANIMALS-$ADV22, MEXICO-POTTERY-$ADV22; photos placed
in the International and Travel folders on the Cox Server.

Oaxaca state.

<P>
   TEOTITLAN DEL VALLE, Mexico _ Margarita Sosa Vasquez plucked a
tiny lime off a tree in her patio, sliced it and squeezed its juice
into a cauldron of boiling orange water.
</P>
<P>
   It was a simple, sudden gesture. But it was part of a very
deliberate process that unfolds here every day: the preparation of
colored wool and the weaving of Zapotec Indian rugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lime helps keep the colors firm,'' said Sosa Vasquez, who,
like so many families in this Mexican village, opens up her home to
strangers who want to buy her rugs and observe them being made.
</P>
<P>
   Teotitlan del Valle, a Zapotec town surrounded by green hills
and fields of spike-tipped maguey plants, is 16 miles east of
Oaxaca (Wah-HA-ka) city, the capital of the state of the same name.
It's a well-known tourist destination and a magnet for folk art
buyers.
</P>
<P>
   The rugs produced here, using techniques passed down for
generations, are similar to geometric-patterned Navajo rugs and
considered some of the finest in Mexican crafts. The town has
prospered with this trade, and some of the weavers have built
spacious homes and workshops that greet you as you roll into the
village.
</P>
<P>
   Books celebrate the weavers' skill, and many townsfolk have
printed business cards in English and Spanish to serve clientele
who return repeatedly or send friends to the village to browse
through racks and racks of rugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men used to weave before, but now everybody does it,'' said
Sosa Vasquez, who heads a large family of siblings and their
children, all who know how to dye the wool with natural substances
and operate the family's creaky old wooden looms.
</P>
<P>
   Tucked off an unpaved side street, the Sosa Vasquez home is
typical: chickens and children scamper in the patio and dogs snooze
lazily next to the looms and pots of scalding water where wool is
dyed. Inside the one-room home the family unfolds rugs of all sizes
and colors, offering prices that range from $25 to more than $200.
</P>
<P>
   Bargaining is expected.
</P>
<P>
   The patterns and colors are lovely, and so are stories behind
how each are made. To dye wool various shades of purple, pink and
red, the weavers scrape a pest off nopal cactus leaves called the
cochineal. The tiny pest, when crushed, creates a scarlet paste
that is added to boiling water.
</P>
<P>
   Blues and turquoises are derived from indigo leaves, greens from
alfalfa, orange from a local tree, and a rich brown comes from
crushed walnut shells.
</P>
<P>
   The wool is dyed, spun and then laboriously woven into mostly
geometric patterns on looms that are operated by foot pedals. Rugs
can take weeks or even months to complete.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four years old, and he's already weaving squares,'' Sosa
Vasquez said, helping her nephew, Luis Roberto Rivera Sosa, climb
onto a diminutive loom designed for children.
</P>
<P>
   The rugs' patterns traditionally include jagged stripes
symbolizing lightening bolts, diamonds and designs from ancient
Indian ruins here. The weavers also make rugs with flowers and fish
on them, and some have experimented with copies of Miro or Picasso
paintings.
</P>
<P>
   Buyers recommend you check a rug carefully to see that it is
tightly woven and doesn't shine too much. A sheen can be a sign
that synthetic fibers have been used instead of natural wool. In
addition to visiting family workshops, you can also browse and
bargain in a market in the town square.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very beautiful work, and very complicated and
time-consuming,'' said Sosa Vasquez, who clearly takes joy in her
art and her Zapotec tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``These rugs can last 100 years,'' she says with satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   HOW TO GET THERE: Hire a taxi, take a city bus or sign up for a
tour at your hotel in Oaxaca to take the 30-minute trip along
Highway 190 to Teotitlan del Valle. The Vasquez Sosa home is on a
cul-de-sac, Privada de Zaragoza.

them are decorated with flowers or perforated with exquisite lacy
designs, so that you can place a candle in them that reflects beads
of light.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the pots, which range in price from less than a dollar
up to $40, are scored with elaborate designs that resemble South
Pacific tattoos.
</P>
<P>
   Dona Rosa's family ships pots to Mexico City for a modest price.
Shipping to the United States is very expensive, so if you really
want a pot be sure to leave room in your luggage for safe packing.
</P>
<P>
   The clay the villagers harvest -- and protect with municipal
taxes -- is placed in a tub of water and strained through a sieve
to rid it of debris, explained Nieto Real.
</P>
<P>
   He picked up a slab of clay and slapped it on a pre-Hispanic
potter's wheel: a clay plate that spins with another plate turned
upside down on top of it.
</P>
<P>
   Even the tools the potter's use are mostly pre-Hispanic, Nieto
Real said, grasping the clay, expertly turning it into a hollow
cylinder and inflating it by hand into an orb. Other than skilled
hands, the potters' tools include wooden sticks and clay discs
shaped like moons.
</P>
<P>
   The pieces must be dried for several days before they can be
decorated or before handles can be attached. The laborious process
includes rubbing the pots with quartz that comes from the same
hills as the clay, to give them their characteristic black shine.
</P>
<P>
   Shiny black pots are porous and cannot hold water, Nieto Real
said, so buyers should beware. But the traditional gray-black pots,
which some people still make here, had been used for centuries for
water or as vessels for mescal, the local hard liquor.
</P>
<P>
   Nieto Real is proud that figures of gods and goddesses made from
the same clay he uses have been unearthed from Monte Alban, the
majestic Zapotec Indian ruins near his village.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our culture,'' Nieto Real said, pointing at the clay.
</P>
<P>
   HOW TO GET THERE: Hire a taxi in downtown Oaxaca, take a city
bus or sign up for a tour at your hotel to go San Bartolo
Coyotepec, where signs point the way to Dona Rosa's shop on Benito
Juarez Street.

 &HT;    RUGS WOVEN FROM NATURE AND TRADITION MAKE OAXACAN VILLAGE A
FAVORITE TRIP
 &HT;    With MEXICO-ANIMALS-$ADV22, MEXICO-POTTERY-$ADV22; photos placed
in the International and Travel folders on the Cox Server.
 &HT;    EDs: Teotitlan del Valle is one of three villages profiled in a
three-part look at the artisan tradition that thrives in Mexico's
Oaxaca state.
 &HT;    Moving in both the (i) International and (t) Travel categories
for use Saturday, Aug. 22 And Thereafter.

<TEXT>
<P>
   TEOTITLAN DEL VALLE, Mexico _ Margarita Sosa Vasquez plucked a
tiny lime off a tree in her patio, sliced it and squeezed its juice
into a cauldron of boiling orange water.
</P>
<P>
   It was a simple, sudden gesture. But it was part of a very
deliberate process that unfolds here every day: the preparation of
colored wool and the weaving of Zapotec Indian rugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lime helps keep the colors firm,'' said Sosa Vasquez, who,
like so many families in this Mexican village, opens up her home to
strangers who want to buy her rugs and observe them being made.
</P>
<P>
   Teotitlan del Valle, a Zapotec town surrounded by green hills
and fields of spike-tipped maguey plants, is 16 miles east of
Oaxaca (Wah-HA-ka) city, the capital of the state of the same name.
It's a well-known tourist destination and a magnet for folk art
buyers.
</P>
<P>
   The rugs produced here, using techniques passed down for
generations, are similar to geometric-patterned Navajo rugs and
considered some of the finest in Mexican crafts. The town has
prospered with this trade, and some of the weavers have built
spacious homes and workshops that greet you as you roll into the
village.
</P>
<P>
   Books celebrate the weavers' skill, and many townsfolk have
printed business cards in English and Spanish to serve clientele
who return repeatedly or send friends to the village to browse
through racks and racks of rugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men used to weave before, but now everybody does it,'' said
Sosa Vasquez, who heads a large family of siblings and their
children, all who know how to dye the wool with natural substances
and operate the family's creaky old wooden looms.
</P>
<P>
   Tucked off an unpaved side street, the Sosa Vasquez home is
typical: chickens and children scamper in the patio and dogs snooze
lazily next to the looms and pots of scalding water where wool is
dyed. Inside the one-room home the family unfolds rugs of all sizes
and colors, offering prices that range from $25 to more than $200.
</P>
<P>
   Bargaining is expected.
</P>
<P>
   The patterns and colors are lovely, and so are stories behind
how each are made. To dye wool various shades of purple, pink and
red, the weavers scrape a pest off nopal cactus leaves called the
cochineal. The tiny pest, when crushed, creates a scarlet paste
that is added to boiling water.
</P>
<P>
   Blues and turquoises are derived from indigo leaves, greens from
alfalfa, orange from a local tree, and a rich brown comes from
crushed walnut shells.
</P>
<P>
   The wool is dyed, spun and then laboriously woven into mostly
geometric patterns on looms that are operated by foot pedals. Rugs
can take weeks or even months to complete.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four years old, and he's already weaving squares,'' Sosa
Vasquez said, helping her nephew, Luis Roberto Rivera Sosa, climb
onto a diminutive loom designed for children.
</P>
<P>
   The rugs' patterns traditionally include jagged stripes
symbolizing lightening bolts, diamonds and designs from ancient
Indian ruins here. The weavers also make rugs with flowers and fish
on them, and some have experimented with copies of Miro or Picasso
paintings.
</P>
<P>
   Buyers recommend you check a rug carefully to see that it is
tightly woven and doesn't shine too much. A sheen can be a sign
that synthetic fibers have been used instead of natural wool. In
addition to visiting family workshops, you can also browse and
bargain in a market in the town square.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very beautiful work, and very complicated and
time-consuming,'' said Sosa Vasquez, who clearly takes joy in her
art and her Zapotec tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``These rugs can last 100 years,'' she says with satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   HOW TO GET THERE: Hire a taxi, take a city bus or sign up for a
tour at your hotel in Oaxaca to take the 30-minute trip along
Highway 190 to Teotitlan del Valle. The Vasquez Sosa home is on a
cul-de-sac, Privada de Zaragoza.

PUTTING THE GAME IN PERSPECTIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEVE CAMPBELL  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ It's all a matter of perspective.
</P>
<P>
   New York Giants coach Jim Fassel surveys the rubble of Friday's
24-10 exhibition defeat against the Jacksonville Jaguars and
declares, ``I'm not very happy right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The offensive line all but escorted Jaguars pass rushers into
the backfield. Running backs carried the ball gingerly, as if the
only holes available to them were shallow graves. The season is
coming too fast.
</P>
<P>
   Grimly, Fassel vows to light a fire that will singe the players'
backsides.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he'd feel a little better if he stepped back and took a
look at the other occupants of Giants Stadium. The New York Jets
suffered their worst exhibition defeat in 22 years Saturday. There
may have been the makings of a quarterback controversy before the
33-0 whipping by the Baltimore Ravens, but Glenn Foley and Vinny
Testaverde did everything in their power to quell that kind of
talk. For a true controversy to take hold, it helps if one
quarterback would make a difference over another.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am concerned,'' Parcells says, ``about everything that
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he'd feel a little better if he stepped back and took a
look at what's left of the Team of the '90s. The Dallas Cowboys
(6-10 last season) don't scare anybody anymore _ until they get off
the field. The latest escapade involves receiver Michael Irvin,
offensive lineman Everett McIver and a pair of barber's scissors.
</P>
<P>
   McIver was waiting for a teammate to give a free haircut and
ended up with his throat sliced. Maybe because the Cowboys have
applied a gag order on everybody involved, reports have circulated
that owner Jerry Jones arranged to pay off McIver so that charges
don't get filed against Irvin. Because if charges get filed, Irvin
runs the risk of getting thrown in jail for violating his
probation.
</P>
<P>
   ``You guys,'' Irvin complains to reporters, ``are working harder
to put me in jail than the police.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Irvin would feel a little less persecuted if he put
himself in the place of the hero of Super Bowl XXVI. Quarterback
Mark Rypien isn't in training camp this year because he has more
important things to do than a job. Rypien's 3-year-old son, Andrew,
has a brain tumor. Doctors have warned that Andrew probably won't
make it through August. His wife, Annette, is recovering from
recent surgery for cervical cancer. So Rypien has chosen to stay at
home, to spend every possible moment with his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about making Andrew happy,'' Rypien says, adding,
``We're praying for a miracle.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it would do everybody good once in a while to take a
longer look around. Former New York Jets defensive end Paul Frase
wishes he could spend his days in Florida with his 3-year-old son,
Joshua, who has a rare and life-threatening muscle and nerve order.
Instead, Frase has been in camp with the Green Bay Packers,
fighting for a job he desperately needs. He can't afford to stay
home.
</P>
<P>
   Frase must pay bills and remain insured while his wife, Alison,
tends to Joshua. It is round-the-clock duty. Joshua is on a feeding
tube, and he often cannot clear his lungs on his own. If Frase
makes the team, he will send for his wife and son.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I don't make the team this year,'' Frase says, ``that does
give me more time to spend with the family.''
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo Bills linebacker Chris Spielman is taking a leave of
absence this season to be with his family. Spielman made the
decision in July when his wife, Stephanie, was diagnosed with
breast cancer. Explains Spielman: ``My wife has supported me for 10
years unconditionally, and the least I can do is go through this
with her unconditionally. I want to be the one to take her to the
treatments, I want to be the one to hold her hand, and I want to be
the one to be with my kids when she can't be.''
</P>
<P>
   It's all a matter of perspective. Shortly after wowing Giants
coaches in a minicamp, running back LeShon Johnson was diagnosed
with a lymphoma. He has to fight for his life before he gets around
to battling for a spot on the team.

   NOTE: Martha Stewart, as every American knows, is a living
brand. In fact, with a 2.3 million-circulation magazine and
syndicated column bearing her name, a river of books and a stream
of television shows, Martha Stewart is a force of nature, the most
influential person alive in terms of giving shape to our living
spaces. She certainly has a knack for articulating our habitat
dreams. And she is way into materials _ premium, well-crafted stuff
such as flower-crystallizing kits. But what about liquid-crystal
displays? Any plans to expand from bedsheets to spreadsheets? I
caught up with the lifestyle queen on her car phone as she
navigated the streets of New York en route to a dinner party.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   KEVIN KELLY: Why are tech-minded people so interested in your
ideas?
</P>
<P>
   MARTHA STEWART: It is the technological age, but it is still an
age of people wanting to know how things are done. My readers think
in a modern fashion about old-fashioned values.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are you of the school that says flaunt your computer
equipment, or hide it?
</P>
<P>
   A: Oh, absolutely put it out in the open. Or hide it in the most
effective way possible. My office at home is an office in a closet.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So you hide it?
</P>
<P>
   A: Well, no, it is always out, except when I am having a dinner
party _ then I roll the shelves back in and close the door without
disturbing anything. I want real practicality and real simplicity.
So, invisible, appropriate, and simple, simple, simple.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's the appropriate color to go with computer beige?
</P>
<P>
   A: Why are you thinking only of beige? I have a beautiful new
black computer with all black components. And 1 have a very
beautiful new silver one. I think computers certainly could be more
appealing aesthetically and fit into rooms nicer.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Any thoughts on smart houses?
</P>
<P>
   A: I am restoring a house now that was a 1962 Bunshaft modern.
I've gutted it and am now installing silence.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Silence? How do you install silence?
</P>
<P>
   A: I want to have a silent environment where you don't hear
furnaces, you don't hear refrigerators, you don't hear dishwashers.
I am working very closely with all the different companies trying
to get them to enter the 21st century with a sense of adventure and
silence. It is a very difficult directive.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Besides silence, what else are you after? How about having
your refrigerator talk to your stereo?
</P>
<P>
   A: I don't want my refrigerator talking to me period. I don't
want it telling me that I am low on meatballs. I do have a brain.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do the same design principles you use in your other projects
also apply online?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. People respond to a pretty Web site, and they respond to
a simple Web site. I don't want talking parrots. I want it to be a
gentle, soothing kind of place _ functionality has to be good, but
it doesn't have to be invasive.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you find the Web sympathetic to that kind of soothing?
</P>
<P>
   A: I want to get across as much information as possible in as
short a period of time. I want it to be straightforward _ I don't
want to open drawers or doors. I hated ``Myst.'' It was so queer.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So you'd find no use for a virtual walk through a house?
</P>
<P>
   A: No, it isn't that. I do have plans for being able to wander
around a home. But I want to do it in a simple, very beautiful way
and a real way, not distorted. You could click on something in a
closet and be told what it was and where to buy it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What about e-mail?
</P>
<P>
   A: Oh, I have a server in my basement. I am really connected,
but I find the software to be abominably inadequate. I complain
about it a lot.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you find yourself surfing the Net much?
</P>
<P>
   A: I don't have a lot of time to sit and just sort of fool
around. When I get home at 11 p.m., which is normal, I go to my
computer to read mail, then answer as much as I have the energy to.
I'll usually get my answers in the morning before I go to work,
because I have a lot of friends and business associates on the West
Coast and in London.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Yet your magazine doesn't give the impression that you are so
techie _ you don't see computers on the table in your photos. Why
this disconnect?
</P>
<P>
   A: It is a little bit sparse, I must admit. But they are there
if you really look. Besides, there is still a big gap between the
35 percent of the public who have computers and the 65 percent who
don't. When that fault is fixed, I think you will see a lot more in
the way of female users and older people. And yet our readers know
that we are technically savvy. More than 50 percent of our
correspondence is reaching us by e-mail now, about 130,000 pieces
of e-mail correspondence a year. Which is very easy to respond to
and very pleasant to receive.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The question of the season: Microsoft monopoly _ thumbs up or
thumbs down?
</P>
<P>
   A: Listen _ if anybody who wants to be an explorer or a pioneer
has to go through what Microsoft is going through, I feel really
bad about it. Man wouldn't have gotten to the Moon, or invented the
telephone, if there had been a check at every step of the way. I
don't believe in this action at all.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Management guru Tom Peters preaches the ``brand of you'' _ if
there is anyone this applies to, it's you. What happens if you get
hit by a bus? Does the brand of you continue?
</P>
<P>
   A: I'm trying to make sure that my brand extension is broad
enough that if anything happens, or I decide to check out, it can
continue. We have taken the next five years of photographs of me
already, so if anything happened to me we have those closets full
of photos.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You could have yourself scanned to create a virtual
character.
</P>
<P>
   A: Cloning hasn't worked yet, but I'll be the first. The first
human Dolly will be me.

   Q: Besides silence, what else are you after? How about having
your refrigerator talk to your stereo?
</P>
<P>
   A: I don't want my refrigerator talking to me period. I don't
want it telling me that I am low on meatballs. I do have a brain.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do the same design principles you use in your other projects
also apply online?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. People respond to a pretty Web site, and they respond to
a simple Web site. I don't want talking parrots. I want it to be a
gentle, soothing kind of place _ functionality has to be good, but
it doesn't have to be invasive.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you find the Web sympathetic to that kind of soothing?
</P>
<P>
   A: I want to get across as much information as possible in as
short a period of time. I want it to be straightforward _ I don't
want to open drawers or doors. I hated ``Myst.'' It was so queer.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So you'd find no use for a virtual walk through a house?
</P>
<P>
   A: No, it isn't that. I do have plans for being able to wander
around a home. But I want to do it in a simple, very beautiful way
and a real way, not distorted. You could click on something in a
closet and be told what it was and where to buy it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What about e-mail?
</P>
<P>
   A: Oh, I have a server in my basement. I am really connected,
but I find the software to be abominably inadequate. I complain
about it a lot.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you find yourself surfing the Net much?
</P>
<P>
   A: I don't have a lot of time to sit and just sort of fool
around. When I get home at 11 p.m., which is normal, I go to my
computer to read mail, then answer as much as I have the energy to.
I'll usually get my answers in the morning before I go to work,
because I have a lot of friends and business associates on the West
Coast and in London.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Yet your magazine doesn't give the impression that you are so
techie _ you don't see computers on the table in your photos. Why
this disconnect?
</P>
<P>
   A: It is a little bit sparse, I must admit. But they are there
if you really look. Besides, there is still a big gap between the
35 percent of the public who have computers and the 65 percent who
don't. When that fault is fixed, I think you will see a lot more in
the way of female users and older people. And yet our readers know
that we are technically savvy. More than 50 percent of our
correspondence is reaching us by e-mail now, about 130,000 pieces
of e-mail correspondence a year. Which is very easy to respond to
and very pleasant to receive.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The question of the season: Microsoft monopoly _ thumbs up or
thumbs down?
</P>
<P>
   A: Listen _ if anybody who wants to be an explorer or a pioneer
has to go through what Microsoft is going through, I feel really
bad about it. Man wouldn't have gotten to the Moon, or invented the
telephone, if there had been a check at every step of the way. I
don't believe in this action at all.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Management guru Tom Peters preaches the ``brand of you'' _ if
there is anyone this applies to, it's you. What happens if you get
hit by a bus? Does the brand of you continue?
</P>
<P>
   A: I'm trying to make sure that my brand extension is broad
enough that if anything happens, or I decide to check out, it can
continue. We have taken the next five years of photographs of me
already, so if anything happened to me we have those closets full
of photos.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You could have yourself scanned to create a virtual
character.
</P>
<P>
   A: Cloning hasn't worked yet, but I'll be the first. The first
human Dolly will be me.

ago, when the United Nations _ struggling desperately to find a way
to cope with an AIDS epidemic that threatens the future of Africa _
took a giant step toward reversing them. After long deliberation,

CLINTON CHATTER SENDS THE INTERNET SPINNING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MATT BEER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ President Clinton's historic on-air speech
Monday night was followed by a historic on-line tidal wave of
reaction.
</P>
<P>
   News and Web sites such as Yahoo logged a crushing number of
visits from Web Wide Web users, who unleashed an outpouring of
sound and fury.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our biggest day ever,'' said Mary Kathleen Flynn, Internet
correspondent for MSNBC, recounting the day's on-line traffic in
various chat rooms and polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our busiest day ever,'' said Scott Woelfel, editor-in-chief of
CNN Interactive, the all-news cable channel's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The death of Princess Diana, the bombing of U.S. embassies, the
demise of Buffalo Bob. You name it, and Clinton's admission of an
inappropriate relationship with a former White House intern dwarfed
them in the realm of the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   A sampling of the outpourings, pulled from an MSNBC chat room,
ranged from the poignant to the, OK, see for yourselves:
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a sad day in America.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The president is a turd.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Cheese poofs.''
</P>
<P>
   On-line polls were jammed, logging hundreds of thousands of
electronic voters who weighed in with their picks.
</P>
<P>
   Though national polls showed support for Clinton _ about 60
percent to 40 percent were satisfied with the president's
explanation _ the Web-based polls consistently showed the polar
opposite.
</P>
<P>
   According to those running the sites, the on-line chatter is all
pretty much a computerized version of workplace gossiping.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a way for people to gather around and talk about what it
all means to them,'' Woelfel said. ``The benefit is hard to
describe at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people like having this virtual water cooler,'' Flynn
said. She said the most concrete benefit she had seen is people
asking each other how they were going to explain things like
presidential infidelity to their children.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, Woelfel said, the Web is empowering people to fight
back against that other tube, the television.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's a story that's gone on for seven months,'' he said.
``That's seven months of all these commentators talking about
nothing but this one story. The Web is a way for the common person
to be a pundit themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   But Woelfel added that no one should assume that the on-line
chatter was representative of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't call it democracy,'' he said. ``It doesn't
represent who we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Kim Alexander, president of the California Voter Foundation said
the instant reaction may not be that healthy for an informed body
politic, as blather substitutes for the hard work of trying to
analyze issues. The California Voter Foundation publishes facts
about politicians over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But Alexander couldn't resist a watery comparison.
</P>
<P>
   ``It lets people blow off steam,'' she said. ``It's great that
people don't have to sit around and shout at the television set.''

   EXOTIC-MARTINIS (Undated) _ First it was cool. Then it got hot.
Now it's bloated and out of control. The martini, sleekest and
suavest of cocktails, has entered the late-Elvis phase of its
once-splendid career, staggering under the weight of weird
garnishes, dazed and disoriented by years of experimenting with
chemicals like Jagermeister, Chambord and Kahlua. From sea to
shining sea, the bars of the United States are groaning under the
weight of horrible martinis. It's time to enter rehab. By William
Grimes.
</P>
<P>
   PEEKYTOE-CRAB (Deer Isle, Maine) _ The sun was just easing over
the horizon when Matthew Eaton hopped into his skiff and set off
into the glassy waters of Eggemogginn Reach. A short distance from
the shore, he reached his destination: a wooden platform where he
had suspended two traps the night before. Each held a small catch
of frisky, reddish crabs. It is the height of the lobster season,
when most Maine lobstermen let the little crabs go instead of
collecting them, as Eaton does. With so many lobsters, worth so
much more money, most lobstermen don't want to bother with crabs.
But Mr. Eaton is no fool; he knows his customer. Welcome to the
world of the peekytoe crab, where one man's trash is another man's
treasure. By Marian Burros.

   CRABBING (Undated) _ If the volatile stock market makes you
dizzy, just be glad you're not a crabber. Though America's
coastline and offshore waters boast more varieties of edible crabs
than any other part of the world, from year to year supplies
plummet, then soar, then plummet and soar again, for reasons known
only to nature. Yet there never seems to be enough crab to meet the
demand. By Florence Fabricant.

quench the thirst and rest light on the tongue. At their best, they
are fruity with just a hint of clove spiciness in the aroma. At
their less-than-best, they are so light that their flavor
disappears. We sampled 11 wheat beers, both American and European _
but only three stood out. By William Grimes and Elaine Louie.

   WINE-TALK (Perpignan, France) _ The French call this western
Mediterranean corner of their country the last frontier. It is a
vast expanse of arid, inhospitable land bounded by this city,
Carcassonne and the Spanish border. In the back country leading up
into the Pyrenees and in some former fishing villages along the
coast, the old people still speak Catalan, which has been described
as the language of the Roman foot soldier. The language may be as
close as we will ever come to the Latin argot of the Roman Empire,
but it isn't the only remnant of those times: vines were almost
certainly planted here by the Phoenicians and later the Greeks. By

   WASHINGTON
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-CAMPAIGN _ After his defiant nationally televised plea
to independent counsel Ken Starr to stop ``prying into personal
lives,'' President Clinton Tuesday began what is likely to be his
last campaign _ to save his embattled presidency by getting enough
credibility and traction with his party and the public in hopes of
being able to govern. Delaying his scheduled departure for a
Martha's Vineyard vacation, Clinton spent the morning on the
telephone in an attempt to shore up his Democratic Party base. It's
likely to be the first of many salvage operations. (Glass, Cox News
Service).
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-PRIVACY _ WASHINGTON _ Aside from whether he can restore
his credibility, President Clinton's televised appeal to end the
``prying'' into his private life no doubt struck a chord with many
Americans who feel the government and private industry have gone
too far in delving into things that used to be purely personal
matters. (Dart, Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-CENSURE _ Between the James Carvilles and Bob Barrs, a
growing number of people in Washington are looking for a middle
ground, a way of resolving this mess that is neither vindication
nor impeachment. Censure offers such a way and we look at those
calling for it and how it would work. (Sherman, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-PRIVATE _ Discussion of when the private becomes public.
Talking to those with experience: Barney Frank, Gary Hart, Bob
Packwood, Mike Bowers, Jim Bakker, Jimmy Swaggart. (Manuel, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-JACKSON _ In light of their midnight meeting after the
speech, is there more to do on the relationship between Jackson and
the Clintons? This might be where we can also deal more with
Chelsea and Hillary if there isn't enough to do a separate story.

   CLINTON-MEDIA _ Following TV coverage, overnight ratings, what
else is planned, etc. (Kloer, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

presidential crisis to kids. (Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

campaigning for vulnerable Republicans. (Sherman, Cox News

</P>
<P>
   CONGRESS _ There's a new barometer for reading which races the
national parties are most worried about _ tax-exempt expenditures.
We take a look at which races are attracting the most independent
issue advertising and what that may say about the Democrats chances
of re-taking the House. (Sherman, Cox News Service).

</P>
<P>
   ISRAEL-MIRABILIS _ JERUSALEM _ With recent software deals
pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into Israeli companies, the
new celebrities here are no longer army generals or politicians,
but high school dropouts. In June, America Online announced that it
bought Tel Aviv-based Mirabilis Ltd. for $287 million in cash and
up to another $120 million based on future growth. The two-year-old
company invented ICQ, an Internet chat service with more than 14
million users. Ninety percent of the money goes to its four
twenty-something founders _ two of whom never made it through 12th
grade _ and one of their parents. But, Mirabilis was topped _ in
dollars if not in cult fame _ last week when the more conventional
software company, Memco, was bought for $412 million in stock by
Illinois-based Platinum Technology. Memco makes software for
securing information stored on Internet servers. The two deals
highlight the growing Israeli software industry, where companies
are making their marks as acquisition targets or niche providers.

   WARMING _ It may not prove the case for global warming, but the
weather in the United States has certainly taken some odd twists
and turns this year. A report by the Sierra Club maintains that the
recent extreme conditions are a sign that the output from mankind's
smokestacks and automobiles is increasing the temperature of the
earth which could lead to dire consequences in the future.

<P>
   PARIS _ A cartoon published Monday on the front page of the
newspaper Le Monde shows a dazed-looking pair, Bill Clinton and
Boris Yeltsin, stripped of almost everything but their underwear.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened to you?'' Clinton asks. ``An intern?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No!'' Yeltsin replies. ``A devaluation.''
</P>
<P>
   The imagined scene of the American and Russian leaders facing
their respective moments of truth captured a widespread
international image of Clinton as a devalued leader.
</P>
<P>
   While they repeatedly deny it in official statements supporting
their fellow incumbent in Washington, foreign leaders are puzzled
and even resentful, officials say privately, about a chain of
events that has put Clinton on the defensive, crippled White House
initiative and deprived the West of attentive, sustained U.S.
leadership in a series of international crises.
</P>
<P>
   Their conflicting impulses _ the reflex of standing by the
democracies' leader and disappointment over Clinton's inability to
deliver internationally _ have been only partially mirrored in
media reaction.
</P>
<P>
   Since last weekend, foreign publications and television stations
have bored in on the dramatic moment when Clinton would become a
sitting president under interrogation, an unthinkable eventuality
in almost any other country.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, Europeans admit bafflement as they contemplate the
world's most powerful nation finding itself in near political
paralysis because of sexual antics involving a middle-aged leader
and a young, provocative woman of legal age.
</P>
<P>
   The theme of bedroom farce continued Monday when Elle, the
French women's magazine, published a full-page cut-out Monica
Lewinsky doll whose wardrobe includes Teflon jeans _ recommended
wear, the magazine said, around the president instead of a dress
that stains easily.
</P>
<P>
   But a new mood among Europeans, a slightly aggrieved sense that
Clinton's woes have started dragging them down in his wake,
surfaced in a sharp sound bite from the former French Minister of
Culture, Jack Lang.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American president's sex organ seems to have become the
center of the universe,'' he complained Monday on French radio.
</P>
<P>
   Most commentators seemed to believe that the saga will culminate
with Clinton's eluding any evidence of perjury and thus staying in
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can hear the slow tearing now'' as Clinton undoes Velcro
tapes meant to catch him, Andrew Sullivan wrote in London's Sunday
Times.
</P>
<P>
   But there has been a chorus of dire warnings about how the White
House could rebound dangerously. The French press revived its
warnings, which emerged during the confrontation with Iraq last
year, that Clinton might be tempted to engage in risky U.S.
muscle-flexing.
</P>
<P>
   The theme was echoed in British and German media, with the
suggested possible adversaries ranging from Fidel Castro's Cuba to
drug lords in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, diplomats and government officials in Europe said
that their leaders blamed Clinton for just the opposite: Creating
vulnerabilities that exposed the presidency to his domestic
political enemies and crippled U.S. ability to provided attentive,
sustained leadership in foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   In worrying aloud, these officials pointed out that their
complaints underscored their own governments' feeling of dependence
on U.S. leadership.
</P>
<P>
   But as a German official said, ``The president likes reminding
everybody that the United States is the indispensable nation, so
what do we do when that country is there too late or isn't there at
all?''
</P>
<P>
   None of these concerns, which underscores European leaders' need
for Washington's help, have been aired publicly. Instead, the media
concentrate on dangerous fallout from the Clinton saga such as the
risk of a rising tide of press snooping into politicians' private
lives _ a concern firmly espoused by most European leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The conservative Sunday Telegraph of Britain, highlighting the
danger of a rising sleaze factor in Western democracies, carried an
article by John O'Sullivan predicting that ``even if Clinton
survives, he will be remembered as a dirty joke.''
</P>
<P>
   But The Independent seemed to reflect a broader view, obviously
espoused by the Blair government, that Clinton's ``troubles are our
concern and it is right for America's allies to help him keep
dignity if he is to remain responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   For such self-proclaimed U.S. enemies as Iraq, the Clinton
combination of weakness at home and aggressiveness abroad has been
staple fare. But outside Europe, most countries seem too immersed
in local problems to follow the U.S. presidential tribulations.
</P>
<P>
   Even in India, currently at odds with Washington, coverage has
been largely factual. But an Indian editor cited as a revealing
clue to discussion among elites a comment by a businesswoman: ``We
know America is a dying society.''
</P>
<P>
   Tokyo and other Asian capitals have had little to say in recent
days about the drama in Washington as they concentrate on their own
economic urgencies and domestic political complications.
</P>
<P>
   Significantly for Asia, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin has
managed to keep some distance between the White House and himself,
enabling him to operate apparently undamaged as the czar of U.S.
policy in economics _ the aspect of U.S. power of greatest direct
interest in most Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
   The same tactics have not worked for Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, according to diplomats and European officials.
</P>
<P>
   Even if she has often operated well on her own, these sources
said, her credibility depends too much on presidential clout for
her to succeed long with a White House largely absorbed by domestic
concerns and a constant need to be planning legal defense
strategies.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, ``We don't want a lame duck president,'' The
Independent newspaper of Britain said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The implication of that editorial was that Clinton may have
already lost the degree of presidential authority necessary in an
era when the United States is expected to operate as the sole
superpower. &QL;

    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 950; UNCUT VERSION RUNS 1,075 WORDS.) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   Even in crises in which Washington forces showdowns, as it did
with Iraq last year, these sources noted, often the White House has
backed away later, as it currently seems to be doing with Saddam
Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   In places as different as Iraq, Kosovo, India and Israel, the
Clinton administration's reactions have often seemed to deliver too
little too late, according to U.S. diplomats and foreign officials
in European capitals.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the White House's reluctance to confront the
Pentagon helps to explain why Washington shunned intervening in
eastern Zaire last year and in effect let rule in the county pass
to Laurent Kabila. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ A cartoon published Monday on the front page of the
newspaper Le Monde shows a dazed-looking pair, Bill Clinton and
Boris Yeltsin, stripped of almost everything but their underwear.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened to you?'' Clinton asks. ``An intern?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No!'' Yeltsin replies. ``A devaluation.''
</P>
<P>
   The imagined scene of the American and Russian leaders facing
their respective moments of truth captured a widespread
international image of Clinton as a devalued leader.
</P>
<P>
   While they repeatedly deny it in official statements supporting
their fellow incumbent in Washington, foreign leaders are puzzled
and even resentful, officials say privately, about a chain of
events that has put Clinton on the defensive, crippled White House
initiative and deprived the West of attentive, sustained U.S.
leadership in a series of international crises.
</P>
<P>
   Their conflicting impulses _ the reflex of standing by the
democracies' leader and disappointment over Clinton's inability to
deliver internationally _ have been only partially mirrored in
media reaction.
</P>
<P>
   Since last weekend, foreign publications and television stations
have bored in on the dramatic moment when Clinton would become a
sitting president under interrogation, an unthinkable eventuality
in almost any other country.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, Europeans admit bafflement as they contemplate the
world's most powerful nation finding itself in near political
paralysis because of sexual antics involving a middle-aged leader
and a young, provocative woman of legal age.
</P>
<P>
   The theme of bedroom farce continued Monday when Elle, the
French women's magazine, published a full-page cut-out Monica
Lewinsky doll whose wardrobe includes Teflon jeans _ recommended
wear, the magazine said, around the president instead of a dress
that stains easily.
</P>
<P>
   But a new mood among Europeans, a slightly aggrieved sense that
Clinton's woes have started dragging them down in his wake,
surfaced in a sharp sound bite from the former French Minister of
Culture, Jack Lang.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American president's sex organ seems to have become the
center of the universe,'' he complained Monday on French radio.
</P>
<P>
   Most commentators seemed to believe that the saga will culminate
with Clinton's eluding any evidence of perjury and thus staying in
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can hear the slow tearing now'' as Clinton undoes Velcro
tapes meant to catch him, Andrew Sullivan wrote in London's Sunday
Times.
</P>
<P>
   But there has been a chorus of dire warnings about how the White
House could rebound dangerously. The French press revived its
warnings, which emerged during the confrontation with Iraq last
year, that Clinton might be tempted to engage in risky U.S.
muscle-flexing.
</P>
<P>
   The theme was echoed in British and German media, with the
suggested possible adversaries ranging from Fidel Castro's Cuba to
drug lords in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, diplomats and government officials in Europe said
that their leaders blamed Clinton for just the opposite: Creating
vulnerabilities that exposed the presidency to his domestic
political enemies and crippled U.S. ability to provided attentive,
sustained leadership in foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   In worrying aloud, these officials pointed out that their
complaints underscored their own governments' feeling of dependence
on U.S. leadership.
</P>
<P>
   But as a German official said, ``The president likes reminding
everybody that the United States is the indispensable nation, so
what do we do when that country is there too late or isn't there at
all?''
</P>
<P>
   None of these concerns, which underscores European leaders' need
for Washington's help, have been aired publicly. Instead, the media
concentrate on dangerous fallout from the Clinton saga such as the
risk of a rising tide of press snooping into politicians' private
lives _ a concern firmly espoused by most European leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The conservative Sunday Telegraph of Britain, highlighting the
danger of a rising sleaze factor in Western democracies, carried an
article by John O'Sullivan predicting that ``even if Clinton
survives, he will be remembered as a dirty joke.''
</P>
<P>
   But The Independent seemed to reflect a broader view, obviously
espoused by the Blair government, that Clinton's ``troubles are our
concern and it is right for America's allies to help him keep
dignity if he is to remain responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   For such self-proclaimed U.S. enemies as Iraq, the Clinton
combination of weakness at home and aggressiveness abroad has been
staple fare. But outside Europe, most countries seem too immersed
in local problems to follow the U.S. presidential tribulations.
</P>
<P>
   Even in India, currently at odds with Washington, coverage has
been largely factual. But an Indian editor cited as a revealing
clue to discussion among elites a comment by a businesswoman: ``We
know America is a dying society.''
</P>
<P>
   Tokyo and other Asian capitals have had little to say in recent
days about the drama in Washington as they concentrate on their own
economic urgencies and domestic political complications.
</P>
<P>
   Significantly for Asia, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin has
managed to keep some distance between the White House and himself,
enabling him to operate apparently undamaged as the czar of U.S.
policy in economics _ the aspect of U.S. power of greatest direct
interest in most Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
   The same tactics have not worked for Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, according to diplomats and European officials.
</P>
<P>
   Even if she has often operated well on her own, these sources
said, her credibility depends too much on presidential clout for
her to succeed long with a White House largely absorbed by domestic
concerns and a constant need to be planning legal defense
strategies.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, ``We don't want a lame duck president,'' The
Independent newspaper of Britain said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The implication of that editorial was that Clinton may have
already lost the degree of presidential authority necessary in an
era when the United States is expected to operate as the sole
superpower. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 950; UNCUT VERSION RUNS 1,075 WORDS.) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   Even in crises in which Washington forces showdowns, as it did
with Iraq last year, these sources noted, often the White House has
backed away later, as it currently seems to be doing with Saddam
Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   In places as different as Iraq, Kosovo, India and Israel, the
Clinton administration's reactions have often seemed to deliver too
little too late, according to U.S. diplomats and foreign officials
in European capitals.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the White House's reluctance to confront the
Pentagon helps to explain why Washington shunned intervening in
eastern Zaire last year and in effect let rule in the county pass
to Laurent Kabila. &QL;

   LONDON _ When it comes to sexual indiscretions, Bill Clinton may
have scored higher than most presidents, but his conduct has
differed only in degree from that of most of his White House
predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   A selection of American presidents surveyed in the Washington
Times newspaper shows all of them merited a black spot on a
scoreboard of sex crimes that range from the use of prostitutes and
fornication (defined as sex with an unmarried woman) through to
much more heinous misdeeds, such as group sex or being linked to
the ``unusual'' death of a lover.
</P>
<P>
   The republic's founding father, George Washington, receives only
one black mark for the crime, mild by the lax standards of the
eighteenth century, of adultery.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Jefferson, a relative libertine, on the other hand, was
awarded four, for mistresses, ``fornication,'' ``adultery'' (sex
with a married women) and fathering illegitimate children.
</P>
<P>
   America's presidents in the nineteenth century were, by and
large, an obscure group of men who seem to have made up for low
profiles by indulging in pecadillos.
</P>
<P>
   Grover Cleveland _ not a name much bandied about now _ earns
four black marks, for mistress, prostitutes, fornication and
illegitimate children.
</P>
<P>
   Though not on the straight and narrow, the presidents of the
last century were, it seems, straight; James Buchanan was the sole
American president in the entire list to stray into the column
denoting homosexual affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The private lives of U.S. leaders in both centuries pale into
insignificance compared to those of our own era. After the prim and
dreary milk-and cookie years of Roosevelt and Eisenhower, the
number of black marks rockets under Kennedy, Johnson and Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton gets seven marks _ for, among others, having a mistress,
using prostitutes, fornication, sex with White House Staff, group
sex ... narrowly beating Johnson who did not, as far as the
newspaper knows, have group sex.
</P>
<P>
   But even Clinton and Johnson fall short of JFK's awesome tally. &QL;

<P>
   Monday the President of the United States testified by video
before a Federal grand jury on whether he perjured himself when he
denied a sexual relationship with the White House intern Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   He now admits to some form of intimate relationship with
Lewinsky, though not to ``sexual relations.'' But the president's
opponents, the independent counsel, Kenneth Starr, and the
Republican Congressional majority, are guilty of a graver offense:
humbug masquerading as democratic vigilance.
</P>
<P>
   In the first place, Republicans do not really believe Clinton
committed a serious tort. His alleged perjury took place in a civil
suit Paula Jones filed under sexual-harassment law.
</P>
<P>
   When she charged that the then-Governor of Arkansas had
propositioned her in a hotel room, Clinton was required to answer
her questions about his sexual conduct since becoming president.
</P>
<P>
   Until Jones came along, Republicans had insisted that sexual
harassment was nothing more than a feminism-fuelled litigative
lottery that allowed some women to collect money when men they did
not fancy made passes at them.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican critique has won broad acceptance. Judges of both
political parties now generally respond to sexual harassment cases
_ as to Paula Jones's _ by chucking them out of court.
</P>
<P>
   In the second place, the Republicans once strenuously denied the
constitutionality of the independent counsel law, which was passed
in 1978 in the wake of Watergate. Kenneth Starr even wrote a brief
against the office he now occupies.
</P>
<P>
   Until Bill Clinton won the Presidency in 1992, and the
Republican campaign of calumny and detraction began, the view of
Congressional conservatives was that the independent counsel exists
outside the checks and balances envisioned in the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Clinton himself is no stranger to humbug. He did not
complain when the Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas was nearly
denied confirmation over a ``sexual harassment'' incident that
consisted of one dirty joke.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was he troubled when Ronald Reagan's presidency was crippled
after 1987 by the inquiry into the illegal raising of money and
arms for the Nicaraguan Contras.
</P>
<P>
   It is a telling parallel. Throughout the 1980s, Democrats warned
that Reagan was a doddering old warmonger. But that is what the
voters wanted _ a doddering old warmonger.
</P>
<P>
   In the Contra scandal, a Democratic congressional majority and a
power-hungry independent prosecutor, Lawrence Walsh, reckoned that
if Americans could not be made to see reason at the polls, then the
work of removing (or disabling) Reagan had best be done judicially.
It is a dangerously anti-democratic tendency.
</P>
<P>
   Starr and the Republicans are making the same mistake. Voters
have always been aware that Clinton is, as the Southern idiom has
it, a hard dog to keep on the porch. And they don't care. They have
prospered under his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   They may even value his goatishness as an antidote to all the
prudery and prohibitionism that travels under the ``family values''
rhetoric of both parties.
</P>
<P>
   Such rhetoric is not unknown in this country, of course. In the
current issue of the Spectator, the Greek-American playboy Taki
writes that the President's offense was that he had not restrained
his sexual impulses even though he is the head of a country with ``
its Christian values written in stone.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the United States is explicitly a non-Christian
country. The U.S. Constitution contains many noble sentiments, but
nowhere does it mention God, let alone Jesus Christ; and the First
Amendment insists on the separation of church and state.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that Bill Clinton, an avowed Baptist, might be
expected to take the injunctions of his religion rather more
seriously than he apparently does, but he is not the first Baptist,
nor the first president, to play away from home.
</P>
<P>
   There is indeed a moral question here, but the morality has been
muddied by the less attractive members of America's religious
right, and by those who cannot and will not reconcile themselves to
Clinton's victories in 1992 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans _ especially the Southern conservatives _ are
finding the Clinton ascendancy unbearable. They, after all,
represent the Americans who steered clear of the leftist,
hedonistic 1960s in order to uphold the old values, work
diligently, and fight communism.
</P>
<P>
   Surely, they felt, they would be vindicated, their virtue
rewarded. Then the Berlin Wall fell, and Americans handed the reins
of leadership to Mr. Didn't-Inhale and his clique of
abortion-promoting Ivy League millionaires. It was just too
frustrating.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton must be prosecuted to show that no one is above the law,
Republicans argue. This is, as Americans would say, baloney. That
no one is above the law is an important American principle, but it
gets flouted from time to time, with no lasting damage.
</P>
<P>
   That people have a right to the president they elected _
provided that he is not guilty of a crime or misdemeanor far more
serious than lying about sex _ is a principle of incomparably
greater importance in a democracy. America ignores it at its
peril. &QL;

<P>
   In the Contra scandal, a Democratic congressional majority and a
power-hungry independent prosecutor, Lawrence Walsh, reckoned that
if Americans could not be made to see reason at the polls, then the
work of removing (or disabling) Reagan had best be done judicially.
It is a dangerously anti-democratic tendency.
</P>
<P>
   Starr and the Republicans are making the same mistake. Voters
have always been aware that Clinton is, as the Southern idiom has
it, a hard dog to keep on the porch. And they don't care. They have
prospered under his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   They may even value his goatishness as an antidote to all the
prudery and prohibitionism that travels under the ``family values''
rhetoric of both parties.
</P>
<P>
   Such rhetoric is not unknown in this country, of course. In the
current issue of the Spectator, the Greek-American playboy Taki
writes that the President's offense was that he had not restrained
his sexual impulses even though he is the head of a country with ``
its Christian values written in stone.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the United States is explicitly a non-Christian
country. The U.S. Constitution contains many noble sentiments, but
nowhere does it mention God, let alone Jesus Christ; and the First
Amendment insists on the separation of church and state.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that Bill Clinton, an avowed Baptist, might be
expected to take the injunctions of his religion rather more
seriously than he apparently does, but he is not the first Baptist,
nor the first president, to play away from home.
</P>
<P>
   There is indeed a moral question here, but the morality has been
muddied by the less attractive members of America's religious
right, and by those who cannot and will not reconcile themselves to
Clinton's victories in 1992 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans _ especially the Southern conservatives _ are
finding the Clinton ascendancy unbearable. They, after all,
represent the Americans who steered clear of the leftist,
hedonistic 1960s in order to uphold the old values, work
diligently, and fight communism.
</P>
<P>
   Surely, they felt, they would be vindicated, their virtue
rewarded. Then the Berlin Wall fell, and Americans handed the reins
of leadership to Mr. Didn't-Inhale and his clique of
abortion-promoting Ivy League millionaires. It was just too
frustrating.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton must be prosecuted to show that no one is above the law,
Republicans argue. This is, as Americans would say, baloney. That
no one is above the law is an important American principle, but it
gets flouted from time to time, with no lasting damage.
</P>
<P>
   That people have a right to the president they elected _
provided that he is not guilty of a crime or misdemeanor far more
serious than lying about sex _ is a principle of incomparably
greater importance in a democracy. America ignores it at its
peril. &QL;

   Aside from the smutty jokes, President Clinton deserved our
sympathy as he faced the questioning of Special Counsel Kenneth
Starr across a video link Monday.
</P>
<P>
   It is not a question of morality or even of past lies. It is the
problem of the leader of the most powerful country of the world
being chased like a rat into the corner.
</P>
<P>
   There are those who believe that he is a rat, in his personal
morality and his character. There are those too who would argue
that truth is the greatest single ingredient in a democracy and the
law is its final guardian.
</P>
<P>
   Both may be true, although it should be said that the U.S.
public is the final arbiter in a democracy of what it does or does
not feel is important in the character of their leaders.
</P>
<P>
   There is little indication either that voters did not have a
fair view of Clinton before his election. The process of
investigation has become not so much a process of judgment as a
legalistic interpretation of what is truth and what is a lie.
</P>
<P>
   It is the process that matters to the world as much as to
America. For the rest of the world is probably reacting much like
the average American, bemused that it could come to this.
</P>
<P>
   If President Clinton stays on wounded and tarnished, it is not
just the prestige of the U.S. that suffers, it is also its ability
to act around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign policy remains the one area where the character of the
president does matter. So far Clinton's record in the field has not
been that strong, but nor has it been bad.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially a domestic president, he has seen it as his task to
turn America's victory in the Cold War to commercial effect through
pushing free trade. But he has resisted most temptations to meddle
dangerously in the internal affairs of other countries, he has
followed a reasonably ethical policy and has put his weight behind
peace where it matters.
</P>
<P>
   It was not entirely his fault that a Republican Congress has
continued to be so anti-U.N. or that Israeli politics have
prevented a breakthrough in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   The danger for the rest of the world of a humiliated president
is that it will be precisely at this time that Clinton may decide
to move from domestic to international concerns in a way aimed at
increasing his prestige rather than pursuing national aims.
</P>
<P>
   The bombings in Kenya, the continued troubles with Fidel Castro,
the war on drugs in Latin America and Asia, the edgy relationship
with Iran: all these could provide him with endless opportunities
to act tough to restore his image.
</P>
<P>
   His troubles are our concern and it is right for America's
allies to help him keep dignity if he is to remain responsible. &QL;

<P>
   SIMIANE-LA-ROTONDE, FRANCE _ ``In 1949, when I moved here, there
were children and shops,'' said Martin Gilbert, the retired mason
of Simiane-la-Rotonde, an ancient hilltop village in Provence
surrounded by fields of lavender.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a baker, two grocers, cafes... (but) the young have
all gone off to Marseilles, like my daughter. Now I rattle around
this big house with my wife,'' he said, jabbing a finger at a fine
17th-century stone four-story house shadowed by the bell tower.
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert is one of the few local people to be seen in the
village's charming but empty streets, carving miniature versions of
Provencal borries (stone huts) in a garage to sell to tourists.
</P>
<P>
   A photograph by Henri Cartier-Bresson, exhibited recently in a
London gallery, shows a gaggle of children in Simiane's old covered
market a few decades ago, prancing before the camera. Today the
market is pristine and silent, but for the sound of Gilbert
tap-tapping his borries in the street below.
</P>
<P>
   A similar silence envelops the village pump, where not that long
ago women gathered to wash their clothes.
</P>
<P>
   The church of Ste. Victoire is locked. At the turn of the
century it was a thriving parish, and the patron saint's feast day
was the high point of the year.
</P>
<P>
   A summoner clattered around the winding streets, shouting out a
long program of events which included the blessing of the entire
population of 1,300 in the square and a great procession headed by
four women carrying the reliquary of Ste. Victoire around the
village, followed by dancing and feasting.
</P>
<P>
   These days an old priest comes from the famous cheese town of
Banon once a month to say Mass to a congregation of about 20.
</P>
<P>
   At the neighboring hilltop village of Oppedette, the church is
shut all the time. ``Except for funerals,'' one villager said. ``We
lock it to keep out vandals _ unemployed people from the city.''
</P>
<P>
   With tourism unable to provide an income for many in villages
off the beaten track, the blue and purple fields of lavender that
unfold like a pleated peasant's skirt beneath the walls of Simiane
and Oppedette perhaps offer the only lifeline by which the local
communities will survive.
</P>
<P>
   A few decades ago, even this industry seemed on the edge of
extinction. Farmers were giving up the struggle to scratch a living
out of stony fields on steep hillsides, and then searching for an
often unscrupulous middleman to buy up the lavender and sell it on.
</P>
<P>
   The market was shrinking, as foreign firms turned to synthetic
substitutes for their oil, or to ultra-cheap ``cloned'' lavender
from Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
   But French lavender today is big business once again, as public
interest booms in herbs and alternative medicine. Synthetic
substitutes are out.
</P>
<P>
   In the nearby town of Apt, a few miles from the much-publicized
Museum of Lavender in Cordes, most shops heavily promote lavender
products. One is devoted to nothing else, selling lavender soap,
lavender shampoo, artful postcards showing lavender fields in
various shades of purple, oils of course, sprays for the kitchens
and potpourris.
</P>
<P>
   The piped music is of cicadas, presumably to give visitors the
feeling of being in a lavender field.
</P>
<P>
   The cognoscenti can muse over whether to buy bags of seeds of
``Lavandin'' (the hybrid, cheaper stuff) or pure ``lavande,'' the
infinitely more expensive wild variety, which only grows above 800
meters (2,500 feet).
</P>
<P>
   The church has tapped into a burgeoning ``New Age'' perception
that herbs, monks and alternative medicine are all intertwined.
</P>
<P>
   At the Cistercian abbey of Senanque and at Ganagobie, the monks
have opened sophisticated shops, selling a huge range of lavender
items far removed in quality from English cathedral shop tat.
</P>
<P>
   As well as their own generous range of lavender soaps, oils and
creams, the abbeys promote books in several languages on monastery
herb gardens and the ancient ``secrets'' of lavender, secrets
presumably preserved over the centuries only by the clergy (which
wouldn't be surprising, as the abbeys sit in fields of the stuff).
</P>
<P>
   Five drops drunk in a glass of wine, I read in one book, can
cure ``hysterical vapors.''
</P>
<P>
   The revival of the once moribund lavender industry of Provence
is not, however, a mere side-effect of the growing attraction to
New Age mysticism and alternative medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Simiane's farmers have helped themselves too, setting up a
co-operative that dispatched the middlemen to oblivion. Out, too,
went ``romantic'' looking scythes (except for folk festivals) and
fat copper stills.
</P>
<P>
   While the tourists trundle around Simiane's pottery shop, the
village farmers sweat in the burning August heat, taking their crop
to the large and distinctly unpicturesque modern distillery that
the co-op has set up on the edge of the village.
</P>
<P>
   Mothers and sons join in with their men, stacking the
fast-browning bales into the giant vat. Clouds of steam rise
through the stalks, carrying the precious oil in pipes through a
cold water tank to rows of barrels underneath.
</P>
<P>
   The undulating lavender fields of Simiane and Oppedette may look
as if they are kept on for the benefit of the heritage industry or
for tourists, but the product is, in fact, sold direct to Proctor &AMP;
Gamble and Colgate.
</P>
<P>
   The Cooperative Agricole des Plantes a Parfum de Provence and
its 290 members have seized almost a third of the total French
lavender oil production, three times more than before the co-op was
set up 15 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Its still a hard living,'' says Claude Coutant, a 30-year-old
farmer, laughing mirthlessly at the notion that the industry's
revival has ensured farmers a comfortable life.
</P>
<P>
   Perspiration streamed from his brow as the lavender was
pitchforked into the vat amid wafts of scalding steam. ``Whatever
money we make goes back into investing in equipment.''
</P>
<P>
   Coutant's father and grandfather farmed lavender before him, and
so will he. Lavender will guarantee the survival of a way of life,
if not prosperity. &QL;

lavender oil production, three times more than before the co-op was
set up 15 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Its still a hard living,'' says Claude Coutant, a 30-year-old
farmer, laughing mirthlessly at the notion that the industry's
revival has ensured farmers a comfortable life.
</P>
<P>
   Perspiration streamed from his brow as the lavender was
pitchforked into the vat amid wafts of scalding steam. ``Whatever
money we make goes back into investing in equipment.''
</P>
<P>
   Coutant's father and grandfather farmed lavender before him, and
so will he. Lavender will guarantee the survival of a way of life,
if not prosperity. &QL;

<P>
   SIMIANE-LA-ROTONDE, FRANCE _ ``In 1949, when I moved here, there
were children and shops,'' said Martin Gilbert, the retired mason
of Simiane-la-Rotonde, an ancient hilltop village in Provence
surrounded by fields of lavender.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a baker, two grocers, cafes... (but) the young have
all gone off to Marseilles, like my daughter. Now I rattle around
this big house with my wife,'' he said, jabbing a finger at a fine
17th-century stone four-story house shadowed by the bell tower.
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert is one of the few local people to be seen in the
village's charming but empty streets, carving miniature versions of
Provencal borries (stone huts) in a garage to sell to tourists.
</P>
<P>
   A photograph by Henri Cartier-Bresson, exhibited recently in a
London gallery, shows a gaggle of children in Simiane's old covered
market a few decades ago, prancing before the camera. Today the
market is pristine and silent, but for the sound of Gilbert
tap-tapping his borries in the street below.
</P>
<P>
   A similar silence envelops the village pump, where not that long
ago women gathered to wash their clothes.
</P>
<P>
   The church of Ste. Victoire is locked. At the turn of the
century it was a thriving parish, and the patron saint's feast day
was the high point of the year.
</P>
<P>
   A summoner clattered around the winding streets, shouting out a
long program of events which included the blessing of the entire
population of 1,300 in the square and a great procession headed by
four women carrying the reliquary of Ste. Victoire around the
village, followed by dancing and feasting.
</P>
<P>
   These days an old priest comes from the famous cheese town of
Banon once a month to say Mass to a congregation of about 20.
</P>
<P>
   At the neighboring hilltop village of Oppedette, the church is
shut all the time. ``Except for funerals,'' one villager said. ``We
lock it to keep out vandals _ unemployed people from the city.''
</P>
<P>
   With tourism unable to provide an income for many in villages
off the beaten track, the blue and purple fields of lavender that
unfold like a pleated peasant's skirt beneath the walls of Simiane
and Oppedette perhaps offer the only lifeline by which the local
communities will survive.
</P>
<P>
   A few decades ago, even this industry seemed on the edge of
extinction. Farmers were giving up the struggle to scratch a living
out of stony fields on steep hillsides, and then searching for an
often unscrupulous middleman to buy up the lavender and sell it on.
</P>
<P>
   The market was shrinking, as foreign firms turned to synthetic
substitutes for their oil, or to ultra-cheap ``cloned'' lavender
from Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
   But French lavender today is big business once again, as public
interest booms in herbs and alternative medicine. Synthetic
substitutes are out.
</P>
<P>
   In the nearby town of Apt, a few miles from the much-publicized
Museum of Lavender in Cordes, most shops heavily promote lavender
products. One is devoted to nothing else, selling lavender soap,
lavender shampoo, artful postcards showing lavender fields in
various shades of purple, oils of course, sprays for the kitchens
and potpourris.
</P>
<P>
   The piped music is of cicadas, presumably to give visitors the
feeling of being in a lavender field.
</P>
<P>
   The cognoscenti can muse over whether to buy bags of seeds of
``Lavandin'' (the hybrid, cheaper stuff) or pure ``lavande,'' the
infinitely more expensive wild variety, which only grows above 800
meters (2,500 feet).
</P>
<P>
   The church has tapped into a burgeoning ``New Age'' perception
that herbs, monks and alternative medicine are all intertwined.
</P>
<P>
   At the Cistercian abbey of Senanque and at Ganagobie, the monks
have opened sophisticated shops, selling a huge range of lavender
items far removed in quality from English cathedral shop tat.
</P>
<P>
   As well as their own generous range of lavender soaps, oils and
creams, the abbeys promote books in several languages on monastery
herb gardens and the ancient ``secrets'' of lavender, secrets
presumably preserved over the centuries only by the clergy (which
wouldn't be surprising, as the abbeys sit in fields of the stuff).
</P>
<P>
   Five drops drunk in a glass of wine, I read in one book, can
cure ``hysterical vapors.''
</P>
<P>
   The revival of the once moribund lavender industry of Provence
is not, however, a mere side-effect of the growing attraction to
New Age mysticism and alternative medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Simiane's farmers have helped themselves too, setting up a
co-operative that dispatched the middlemen to oblivion. Out, too,
went ``romantic'' looking scythes (except for folk festivals) and
fat copper stills.
</P>
<P>
   While the tourists trundle around Simiane's pottery shop, the
village farmers sweat in the burning August heat, taking their crop
to the large and distinctly unpicturesque modern distillery that
the co-op has set up on the edge of the village.
</P>
<P>
   Mothers and sons join in with their men, stacking the
fast-browning bales into the giant vat. Clouds of steam rise
through the stalks, carrying the precious oil in pipes through a
cold water tank to rows of barrels underneath.
</P>
<P>
   The undulating lavender fields of Simiane and Oppedette may look
as if they are kept on for the benefit of the heritage industry or
for tourists, but the product is, in fact, sold direct to Proctor &AMP;
Gamble and Colgate.
</P>
<P>
   The Cooperative Agricole des Plantes a Parfum de Provence and
its 290 members have seized almost a third of the total French
lavender oil production, three times more than before the co-op was
set up 15 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Its still a hard living,'' says Claude Coutant, a 30-year-old
farmer, laughing mirthlessly at the notion that the industry's
revival has ensured farmers a comfortable life.
</P>
<P>
   Perspiration streamed from his brow as the lavender was
pitchforked into the vat amid wafts of scalding steam. ``Whatever
money we make goes back into investing in equipment.''
</P>
<P>
   Coutant's father and grandfather farmed lavender before him, and
so will he. Lavender will guarantee the survival of a way of life,
if not prosperity. &QL;

 &HT;    By The Atlanta Journal
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   THE SPECTER of a president of the United States who looked the
American people in the eye and lied to preserve his political
viability does permanent damage to the office of the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Like Richard Nixon before him, Bill Clinton has frittered away a
national treasure: the respect a governed people have for a revered
institution. The president is wrong. This is not about sex. It is
not about a president's ``private'' life, as he asserted Monday
night. It's about trust. A president cannot look his people in the
eye and knowingly assert an untruth as fact, no matter how cleverly
drawn the lie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that my public comments and my silence about this
matter gave a false impression,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   This is a president who lives in the legalistic margins, who
masters the law to fit a lifestyle among its nuances and in its
loopholes, a man who would stand at the gates of hell quibbling
legal semantics with the devil. Even in his speech Monday, the
quibbling semanticist reasserted himself. After professing to take
``complete responsibility'' for all of his actions, the president
proceeded to characterize his past testimony as ``legally
accurate'' and only improper in that he ``did not volunteer
information.'' This is a president still in denial.
</P>
<P>
   It's primarily a Kenneth Starr vendetta, the president and his
protectors in and out of the media would have us believe. ``The
independent counsel investigation moved on to my staff and friends,
then into my private life,'' Clinton said. Deep denial.
</P>
<P>
   The question now, though, is: Where does the nation go from
here?
</P>
<P>
   Impeachment?
</P>
<P>
   Resignation?
</P>
<P>
   Two more years of the ceremonial and fund-raising president
without the credibility and the moral authority to lead?
</P>
<P>
   We are not yet ready to recommend impeachment. We will say,
however, if grounds are established _ obstruction of justice,
perjury or suborning perjury _ the House decision on whether to
bring charges should not be influenced one iota by public opinion
polls. Public opinion will catch up with principled adherence to
constitutional duty.
</P>
<P>
   Resignation? We don't demand it. The damage to the presidency is
done. Resignation won't repair it. On one measure, the president's
defenders are right. The essence of the man was known to the
American people when they voted for him a second time. The pattern
of behavior exhibited in the White House is consistent with his
previous life.
</P>
<P>
   The nation is faced, then, with a credibility-bereft president
serving out the remainder of his term. The nation can limp through
that. In the event of national emergency, the nation rallies to
common purpose _ and we will, whether the president is strong or
weak.
</P>
<P>
   Among the lawyers, journalists and politicians who gather in
Washington watering holes to fashion the instant talk-show analysis
that characterizes political debate, the cleverness of the dodge _
it's ``inappropriate contact,'' not a ``sexual relationship''; the
matter is ``private,'' and Starr is the villain _ may be an
admirable, get-off-the-hook political strategy.
</P>
<P>
   The chattering class may express admiration for the cleverly
spun evasion. But at every Waffle House in America, nobody's
fooled. This is not contrition. It is combative denial and a heavy
dose of wishful thinking.

   CASTANEDA-ESTATE (Undated) _ Once he began publishing his
best-selling accounts of his purported adventures with a Mexican
shaman 30 years ago, Carlos Castaneda's life and work played out in
a wispy blur of sly illusion and artful deceit. Now, four months
after he died and two months after the death was made public, a
probate court in Los Angeles is sifting through competing claims on
the estate of the author whose works helped define the 1960s and
usher in the New Age movement. His followers say he left the earth

   EXOTIC-MARTINIS (Undated) _ First it was cool. Then it got hot.
Now it's bloated and out of control. The martini, sleekest and
suavest of cocktails, has entered the late-Elvis phase of its
once-splendid career, staggering under the weight of weird
garnishes, dazed and disoriented by years of experimenting with
chemicals like Jagermeister, Chambord and Kahlua. From sea to
shining sea, the bars of the United States are groaning under the
weight of horrible martinis. It's time to enter rehab. By William
Grimes.

<P>
   PEEKYTOE-CRAB (Deer Isle, Maine) _ The sun was just easing over
the horizon when Matthew Eaton hopped into his skiff and set off
into the glassy waters of Eggemogginn Reach. A short distance from
the shore, he reached his destination: a wooden platform where he
had suspended two traps the night before. Each held a small catch
of frisky, reddish crabs. It is the height of the lobster season,
when most Maine lobstermen let the little crabs go instead of
collecting them, as Eaton does. With so many lobsters, worth so
much more money, most lobstermen don't want to bother with crabs.
But Mr. Eaton is no fool; he knows his customer. Welcome to the
world of the peekytoe crab, where one man's trash is another man's
treasure. By Marian Burros.

   CRABBING (Undated) _ If the volatile stock market makes you
dizzy, just be glad you're not a crabber. Though America's
coastline and offshore waters boast more varieties of edible crabs
than any other part of the world, from year to year supplies
plummet, then soar, then plummet and soar again, for reasons known
only to nature. Yet there never seems to be enough crab to meet the
demand. By Florence Fabricant.

Their tartness distinguishes them: With their lemony tang, they
quench the thirst and rest light on the tongue. At their best, they
are fruity with just a hint of clove spiciness in the aroma. At
their less-than-best, they are so light that their flavor
disappears. We sampled 11 wheat beers, both American and European _

   WINE-TALK (Perpignan, France) _ The French call this western
Mediterranean corner of their country the last frontier. It is a
vast expanse of arid, inhospitable land bounded by this city,
Carcassonne and the Spanish border. In the back country leading up
into the Pyrenees and in some former fishing villages along the
coast, the old people still speak Catalan, which has been described
as the language of the Roman foot soldier. The language may be as
close as we will ever come to the Latin argot of the Roman Empire,
but it isn't the only remnant of those times: vines were almost
certainly planted here by the Phoenicians and later the Greeks. By

   CASTANEDA-ESTATE (Undated) _ Once he began publishing his
best-selling accounts of his purported adventures with a Mexican
shaman 30 years ago, Carlos Castaneda's life and work played out in
a wispy blur of sly illusion and artful deceit. Now, four months
after he died and two months after the death was made public, a
probate court in Los Angeles is sifting through competing claims on
the estate of the author whose works helped define the 1960s and
usher in the New Age movement. His followers say he left the earth
with the same elegant, willful mystery that characterized his life.
The man he used to call his son says he died while a virtual

BANKER SEES CHINA AS SOURCE OF STABILITY AMID ASIAN WOES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAVID ARMSTRONG  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The economies of many East Asian nations _ and
now Russia _ may be bleeding, but timely intervention can staunch
the hemorrhage and eventually restore the patients to health.
</P>
<P>
   That was the assessment of James A. Harmon, chairman of the
Export-Import Bank of the United States. Harmon, a longtime
investment banker who took over as head of the government agency in
July 1887, said the Export-Import Bank was ready to help U.S.
companies deal with the Asian crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington-based agency offers guaranteed loans, insurance
and other services to American companies and foreign entities that
contract with U.S. corporations when the risk is too high for the
private sector.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech to the Pan American Society of San Francisco, Harmon
recalled that U.S. loans to crisis-ridden Latin America in the
1980s were 90 percent repaid, with salutary results for the region
and U.S. business.
</P>
<P>
   The same thing will happen in Asia, Harmon said in an interview.
Harmon visited China, Thailand and Japan last month. China is the
second-biggest recipient of Export-Import Bank loans, at $5.2
billion, after Mexico's $7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``My trip to China was a very productive trip. I was the first
senior U.S. government official to go there in the afterglow of
President Clinton's trip,'' Harmon said, referring to the
president's visit in early June.
</P>
<P>
   Harmon said he and high-ranking Beijing officials talked about
tighter environmental standards on Chinese infrastructure projects.
The Export-Import Bank and institutions such as the World Bank
refused to finance China's Three Gorges dam because of
environmental concerns and a lack of detailed information from
China.
</P>
<P>
   On his recent visit, Harmon said, Chinese officials expressed
interest in buying environmental equipment, hospital equipment and
other merchandise. ``U.S. manufacturers will make (these goods),
which will create jobs in the U.S.,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Harmon said the United States is pressing China ``to buy more of
our goods and services because our trade deficit with them is
growing.'' The deficit hit $20.4 billion through May 1998, up from
$16.9 billion at the same time last year.
</P>
<P>
   A chartered agency with 400 employees founded in 1934, the
Export-Import Bank operated last year with a budget of $635
million. It is comparatively small compared to the World Bank and
the International Monetary Fund, both international lending
agencies, but growing.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has asked for $808 million for the bank in the coming
year, bank spokesman Ken Murphy said. Murphy said the House and
Senate are talking about a $750 million budget.
</P>
<P>
   Harmon spent most of his Asian trip in China because, he said,
the United States sees China as a huge and relatively stable player
in Asia. China has so far resisted devaluing its currency, the
yuan. Even more than the just-devalued Russian ruble, a devalued
yuan could set off another deflationary round, Harmon said.
</P>
<P>
   Harmon also pointed to the Export-Import Bank's support of South
Korea as an example of efforts to help calm the Asian jitters. The
agency increased loans and guarantees to Seoul to $2 billion this
year, from just $50 million a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We extended letters of credit to South Korea because they
couldn't get raw materials from us,'' Harmon explained, saying he
believes the South Koreans ``are very creditworthy.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Harmon acknowledged that problems in East Asia remain. As
examples, he cited ethnic strife in Indonesia and Japan's stalled
economic engine.
</P>
<P>
   With 70 percent of the entire East Asian economy, Japan is by
far the biggest player in the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us are hoping that they take bolder action,'' Harmon
said, ``chiefly by effectively managing nonperforming loans at
their banks.''
</P>
<P>
   Harmon allowed that some Asian countries may have to restructure
their loans, taking more time to repay. But rescheduling, he noted,
is not the same as default.
</P>
<P>
   Harmon predicted Asia, which takes a third of U.S. exports,
would be growing again ``in the not-too-distant future.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that the fundamentals of the world economy, especially
in the United States, appear to be sound: ``This is the strongest
economy I've ever seen in my business life, including the '60s,
which I thought were quite good.''
</P>
<P>
   Asia and Russia, Harmon said, will slow the American economy but
won't stop it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There'll be a slowdown,'' he said. ``A soft landing.''

 &HT;    Clinton tarnishes legacy
 &HT;    (An editorial published Aug. 18, 1998, by The Atlanta
Constitution.)
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By The Atlanta Constitution
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   With nearly 29 months remaining in his second term, President
Clinton has come before the American people _ again _ to ask them
to forgive him for an extramarital affair and its accompanying
lies. The voters heard something similar from then-candidate
Clinton during the 1992 presidential campaign, when he and his wife
gave a remarkable interview to CBS' ``60 Minutes,'' during which he
admitted to causing ``pain'' in his marriage.
</P>
<P>
   These acts of contrition are less persuasive for their
frequency. If Clinton had been genuinely sorry in 1992, surely he
would have found the will to restrain himself from further
extramarital dalliances.
</P>
<P>
   He did not. Instead, he again embarrassed himself and humiliated
his wife and daughter. Because he is now the president, his latest
recklessness also demeaned the office he holds and distracted his
Cabinet from important business.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, in sworn testimony before a grand jury, the president
reportedly admitted that for seven months, he flat-out lied to the
public. If he could justify those lies as necessary to spare
himself the embarrassment of his own conduct and his family further
humiliation, he cannot justify lying to members of his Cabinet and
other close associates, colleagues who must be able to depend on
the president's honesty. Instead, he sent them out to defend him
with what he knew were lies.
</P>
<P>
   Now Congress and the American public must ask themselves whether
Clinton's immoral behavior requires that he leave office, either
through resignation or impeachment. The case for resignation is
strong. If Clinton cared deeply about the nation and the fate of
his own programs, he would hand the keys over to vice-president Al
Gore, who might be able to push some of those proposals, such as
Social Security reform, through Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But there is little in Clinton's history that suggests he will
choose that course. In fact, Clinton was less sorrowful than he was
combative in his short address to the nation Monday night. Seconds
after he uttered the words, ``I must take complete responsibility
for all my actions,'' he sought to mitigate his role in this tawdry
mess by pointing to a ``politically inspired lawsuit'' _ a
reference to the Paula Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he stuck to the line that his testimony in a
deposition related to that case _ testimony that is at the heart of
any perjury allegations _ was ``legally accurate.'' That strains
credulity.
</P>
<P>
   So, the question becomes: Should Congress impeach him? That
raises a different set of considerations, and based on the
information that has been made public, the answer is no. There is a
difference between behavior that is immoral and unseemly and
behavior that is illegal. So far, it seems, independent counsel
Kenneth Starr's investigation has not revealed substantial evidence
of the kinds of high crimes and misdemeanors that would warrant a
forced removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   There does not appear to be credible evidence that Clinton tried
to persuade Monica Lewinsky to lie under oath, which would lay the
groundwork for a case of subornation of perjury. That was the most
serious charge connected with the Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   Nor does it appear that Starr, whose office has been riddled
with leaks, has turned up evidence of wrongdoing in the
investigation of the Whitewater real estate deal. Indeed, if the
latest leaks are correct, his investigation, after four years and
$40 million, has turned up essentially nothing of substance on
topics ranging from the death of Vince Foster to ``travelgate.''
</P>
<P>
   Legally, then, what have we here? It appears that Starr has
caught the president in a lie about adultery. Because Lewinsky
never accused the president of sexual harassment, Clinton's
testimony about their relationship was immaterial to the Paula
Jones case, a civil suit alleging sexual harassment by Clinton
while he was governor of Arkansas. Moreover, Jones' suit was thrown
out of court.
</P>
<P>
   In short, the president's alleged perjury involves only
immaterial testimony in a dismissed civil case. That just does not
justify impeachment. If the president is not above the law, neither
is he below its protections. It is unlikely that any average
citizen would be prosecuted for perjury in these circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's up to Starr and Congress to wrap up this investigation
as quickly as possible. Starr should immediately present his
complete report to Congress, and its members should make that
report public. Though Clinton may never regain either the respect
or trust of the nation, a full public accounting of the Starr
investigation may help restore the voters' faith in the system set
in place to handle allegations of wrongdoing against a high-ranking
public official.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, the president has ensured that his dream of
assuming a prominent place in American history will never be
realized. But there are still important issues to which he must
attend as long as he is in office: including Social Security,
health care, global warming, and Asian and Russian economies in
crisis, not to mention global terrorism. Sadly, with his
credibility permanently damaged, his leadership in those areas may
be limited.

NEW CLANCY THRILLER FULL OF ACTION, LIGHT ON TECHNOJARGON 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: stands for BOOKS-REVIEW-MYSTERIES)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BOBBIE HESS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tom Clancy's ``Rainbow Six'' (G.P. Putnam's Sons, $27.95, 740
pages) starts with a hijacking on Page 4 and the pace rarely
slackens in this well-crafted, very readable thriller.
</P>
<P>
   John Clark has just been named to head Rainbow Six, a secret
international task force that fights terrorism from a base in
England. En route to the new assignment, three Spanish-speaking men
take over the aircraft and tell the pilot to fly them to the
Azores. But quickly Clark, his executive officer Alistair Stanley
and strike team leader Domingo (Ding) Chavez, Clark's son-in-law,
disarm the hijackers and instruct the pilot to reroute to Gander,
Newfoundland.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, 10 winos are being scooped up off the streets and
taken to an undisclosed medical facility where they are given clean
clothes, good food, lots of drugged booze and injections of a
plague virus known as Shiva. As the wino group begins dying, young
women get picked up at singles bars, drugged and taken to the
facility to be injected so the personnel can test Shiva on healthy
individuals.
</P>
<P>
   In England, Clark begins to put two strike teams together _ one
headed by Ding, the other by Briton Peter Covington. Within weeks,
Rainbow Six gets the first call for help. A bank robbery in Bern
has gone bad, a hostage has been killed and the robbers are
threatening to kill more. Ding leads the assault on the bank,
rescuing all the hostages and killing all four gunmen, former
members of the notorious German terrorist group Baader-Meinhof.
Watching the operation is former KGB agent Dimitry Popov, who
financed the terrorists at the direction of a tree-hugging
billionaire U.S. politician and scientist.
</P>
<P>
   Next a group of terrorists seize an Austrian castle and Rainbow
Six is called in. Soon after, Basque separatists take over an
amusement park in Spain and grab 33 French children and two
critically ill youngsters in wheelchairs. Of course, Rainbow Six
saves the day.
</P>
<P>
   These three seemingly unrelated incidents are too close together
to be a coincidence. But before Clark and crew can get some clues
on who is behind the incidents, IRA terrorists take over the
hospital where Clark's wife, a nurse, and his pregnant daughter, a
doctor, work. Popov is again watching, and when he learns prisoners
have been taken, he heads back to the United States and changes his
identify.
</P>
<P>
   Now Clark and crew begin a worldwide manhunt to find Popov, a
hunt that will bring them closer and closer to a band of
environmentalists set on killing most of mankind.
</P>
<P>
   As always, Clancy has created a band of very moral, but very
motivated characters who have no qualms when good people are in
peril. The pace never slows, even when Rainbow Six is doing routine
drills back at the base. Unlike most Clancy thrillers, ``Rainbow
Six'' is light on the technical jargon.
</P>
<P>
   There is some sloppy editing early on. And it is unbelievable
that such a top-notch strike force can't figure out that they need
helicopter support and cellular phones until after the second
mission. But that just proves that even Clancy isn't perfect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rainbow Six'' is No. 1 on the best-seller list for good reason
_ this a terrific yarn.

most Japanese, while fond of the alliance with the United States,

</P>
<P>
   (1,500 words) Benjamin Netanyahu's continued appeal is the great
paradox of Israeli politics today. Despite diplomatic blunders and
derailment of a peace process that is overwhelmingly supported by
Israelis _ nearly 60 percent, according to recent polls _ he
remains popular. Among his strongest supporters are Jews who left
the former USSR, and have painful memories of intense
anti-Semitism.

<P>
   (5,000 words) The symbol of the Chinese Communist Party's
economic policies has been an unbreakable iron rice bowl, standing

   &UR; ARE U.S. TROOPS NEEDED IN JAPAN? &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By Morihiro Hosokawa &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   (1,300 words) Many Americans see the presence of U.S. troops in
Japan as a gracious favor meant to underpin Japan's security. But
most Japanese, while fond of the alliance with the United States,
would like to see fewer U.S. troops on their soil.

   &UR; PREVENTING WAR in the TAIWAN STRAIT &LR;  &QL;

<P>
   (1,400 words) Taiwan seems convinced it can campaign for
independence with the military backing of the United States. If war
is to be prevented, Washington must convince Taipei as well as
Beijing that it is time for them to work out a mutually acceptable
relationship.

<P>
   &UR; Chas. W. Freeman, Jr., is co-chair of the United States-China
Policy Foundation. A former diplomat, he served as deputy chief of

   &UR; PROTECTING THE WORLD'S REFUGEES &LR;  &QL;

</P>
<P>
   (1,200 words) Today's crisis of internal displacement is no less
acute than the refugee crisis that confronted Europe after World
War II. Africa today counts about 10 million internally displaced
persons, Europe and Asia some 5 million each, and Latin America up
to 2 million.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Roberta Cohen is a guest scholar at the Brookings Institution.

   &UR; WHO ARE NETANYAHU'S STAUNCH SUPPORTERS? &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By Ehud Sprinzak &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   (1,500 words) Benjamin Netanyahu's continued appeal is the great
paradox of Israeli politics today. Despite diplomatic blunders and
derailment of a peace process that is overwhelmingly supported by
Israelis _ nearly 60 percent, according to recent polls _ he
remains popular. Among his strongest supporters are Jews who left
the former USSR, and have painful memories of intense
anti-Semitism.

   &UR; PALESTINIANS HAVE REACHED THEIR LIMITS &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By Khalil Shikaki &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   (1,450 words) As the grand old man of Palestinian nationalism,
Yasir Arafat's personal influence and political wiles have let him
dominate and change Palestinian politics in a way no other figure
could. But Arafat will not live forever, and Hamas, the radical
Islamist group, will not stay on the sidelines forever.

   &UR; POWER IN A TERRORIZED LAND &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By Lahouari Addi &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   (1500 words) Horrifying reports of violence in Algeria are
seldom fleshed out with any firm explanation of motives and
lawbreakers. Many say it is not Islamist rebels, but rather the
army that is the culprit. Of late, Algeria's generals have blocked
an international investigation to uncover the truth about the new
spree of village massacres.

 &UR; By Henry D. Jacoby, Ronald G. Prinn and Richard Schmalensee &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (5,000 words) The Kyoto pact on global warming is neither a
battle won nor a costly burden _ more like a quick political fix
for the vast problems of climate change. Reducing greenhouse-gas
emissions requires including the developing countries who sat out
Kyoto.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SMASHING THE IRON RICE BOWL &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By Neil C. Hughes &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (5,000 words) The symbol of the Chinese Communist Party's
economic policies has been an unbreakable iron rice bowl, standing
for cradle-to-grave social security. But with Beijing unable to
keep its state enterprises _ behemoths that employ about 76 million
workers _ afloat, China is teetering between economic reform and
social unrest.

   (6,000 words) So far China has avoided Southeast Asia's
financial crisis, but it shares many of the underlying weaknesses
that brought on the panic. Although it lacks capital convertibility
that imperiled other countries its weak banking system has issued a
mountain of bad loans.

 By OSCAR ARIAS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Despite the end of the Cold War, it is the international arms
trade in which power and position generate enormous profit to the
detriment of millions.
 &HT;    In developing countries, enough basic health services and
clinical care to save 10 million lives could be paid for with less
than half the yearly outlay on military weapons, equipment and
manpower. In developed countries, governments spend 10 times more
on their military ``defense'' than on development aid to the poorer
nations.
 &HT;    When war becomes business, for every individual who prospers,
millions despair.
 &HT;    How can the world spend more than $750 billion per year on
weapons and armed forces while 1 billion people languish in
poverty?
 &HT;    How can the developed nations spend as much on military power
each year as the poorest 2 billion people on our planet earn in
total income? How can we accept a world that spends 25 times more
on maintaining a soldier than it does on educating a child?
 &HT;    Surely the continued arms trade represents one of the most
pervasive forms of corruption.
 &HT;    But corruption requires at least two parties: the consumer and
the supplier. Political and military leaders in many countries,
ignoring the needs of their people, often encourage arms purchases
and stockpiling; we know that in many cases they have been able to
personally reap financial gain from such transactions. Meanwhile,
the weapons often become tools to thwart democratic processes and
oppress the people.
 &HT;    And which countries are behind the lucrative arms industry? The
nations that supply the majority of the world's conventional arms
deliveries are none other than the five permanent members of the
U.N. Security Council _ the United States, the former Soviet Union,
France, the United Kingdom and China.
 &HT;    The new political environment created by the end of the Cold War
allows for new perspectives and new priorities. It is imperative
that we take advantage of the world's unprecedented opportunity for
peace.
 &HT;    The people of all nations, both rich and poor, benefit when
resources are redirected from the pursuit of war to the pursuit of
education, development, health and peace.
 &HT;    For many years now, I have been proposing the establishment of a
Global Demilitarization Fund. In brief, the idea is to create a
fund that will allow the world to take advantage of the heralded _
but elusive _ peace dividend.
 &HT;    Nations would make voluntary contributions to the fund from
savings they earned through reductions in military spending. The
Fund could stimulate the decline in military spending by linking
money saved on weapons and military manpower to the consolidation
of world peace.
 &HT;    The nations of the world, both rich and poor, should commit
themselves to an annual reduction of at least 3 percent in
military-spending levels over the next five years.
 &HT;    The rich nations then should agree to earmark at least one-fifth
of these savings for a demilitarization fund which is under
international jurisdiction. Developing countries should also agree
to contribute a fraction, perhaps one-tenth, of these savings
toward such a fund.
 &HT;    In this manner, a portion of the peace dividend would be
available to commit to promoting global demilitarization and to
fund a U.N. standing force.
 &HT;    The Global Demilitarization Fund would be an important step
toward achieving human security. It might be managed by the World
Bank and U.N. agencies endowed with sufficient authority to
administer its resources justly and efficiently.
 &HT;    The goals of the Fund would be, first, to create and use the
peace dividend; second, to speed and encourage the global processes
of demilitarization, demobilization and conversion; and third, to
help less-developed countries further their own democratic and
human-development plans.
 &HT;    It is impossible to achieve development and peace when the
countries most desperately in need of resources fail to invest in
their people and instead allocate significant funds to buying
weapons from the developed nations. These shipments can only lead
to growing instability, decreased public security and the
possibility of increased death and destruction.
 &HT;    Corruption must be eradicated in all of its forms. It is a
deadly contradiction to promote war through the proliferation of
weapons while preaching the need for peace.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Despite the end of the Cold War, it is the international arms
trade in which power and position generate enormous profit to the
detriment of millions.
 &HT;    In developing countries, enough basic health services and
clinical care to save 10 million lives could be paid for with less
than half the yearly outlay on military weapons, equipment and
manpower. In developed countries, governments spend 10 times more
on their military ``defense'' than on development aid to the poorer
nations.
 &HT;    When war becomes business, for every individual who prospers,
millions despair.
 &HT;    How can the world spend more than $750 billion per year on
weapons and armed forces while 1 billion people languish in
poverty?
 &HT;    How can the developed nations spend as much on military power
each year as the poorest 2 billion people on our planet earn in
total income? How can we accept a world that spends 25 times more
on maintaining a soldier than it does on educating a child?

 By MELINDA JENNEBERGER  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    It's three minutes to air, and Randy Tate, head of the Christian
Coalition, is stuck in traffic on a Miami freeway, cheerfully
singing the toothbrushing song from ``Barney.'' (``While I'm
brushing my teeth and having so much fun, I never let the water
run. No, I never let the water run.'') He was to have been on a
morning radio show that reaches 15,000 Spanish-speaking
evangelicals _ folks the coalition desperately wants to enlist _
and his local organizer, who had insisted this drive would be just
a short hop, is on the cell phone begging the producer to let them
come anyway.
 &HT;    The answer is no, but Tate is perfectly pleasant about the lost
opportunity, just as he is later in the day when the same man makes
him so late for a lunch with some big-money donors that he can only
stay a few minutes before racing back to the airport.
 &HT;    The fact is, Tate is a perfectly pleasant guy. And no one would
tag him with the word critics"so routinely applied to his intense
predecessor, Ralph Reed: scary. (You can't help Thinking, on a day
spent hurtlijg nowhere, that Reed would never have put up with this
wasted motion.)
 &HT;    Back in Warhington, Tate has often been seen as a little too
nice _ and not too effec|ive. But after a year in the job, with
fall congressional elections just around the corner, he is trying
to change all that. And the centerpiece of his strategy seems to be
a lot of tough talk about homosexuals.
 &HT;    Tate was among the first to defend Trent Lott after the Senate
majoridy leader compared homosexuals to kleptomaniacs. He also
siened on to co-sponsor an ad campaign that says homnsexuals can be
cured through religious faith. ``It wasn't a tough call,'' Tate
says.
 &HT;    While that effort has put the Cjristian Coalition back in the
news, it has also added to doubts about Tate, con~incing his
critics that he is neither nice nor effective. Even Reed has siid
vhat remarks like those Lott made are a big tactical mistake.
 &HT;    With that strategy, Reed has said, ``the Republican Party has
tripped over its own shoelaces and found itself on the defensive.''
In an interview in his tiny Capitol Hill office, Tate sighs and
says he doesn't really like talking about gay people.
 &HT;    ``Fifteen years ago, this wasn't an issue _ it isn't like we
decided to bring it up,'' he says, tossing an empty Coke bottle
into the air and catching it. ``Is there foam coming down the side
of my mouth?'' he cracks.
 &HT;    But he has been bringing it up plenty lately. After Lott said
homosexuality is a sin, Tate sent him an ``atta boy'' and went on
``Good Morning America'' opposite Rep. Barney Frank, the
Massachusetts Democrat who is gay, to complain that it was Lott who
had been the true target of bigotry, discriminated against for his
Christian views.
 &HT;    ``Senator Lott expressed his private religious views,'' Tate
explained on the show, ``and the White House referred to him as
extreme because he believed in the Bible. It's the religious
intolerance that really bothers me in this debate.''
 &HT;    Tate calls the ad campaign that followed ``a message of hope,
love and tolerance'' for homosexuals, but when asked, several
times, says no, he himself has not ever really known a gay person
very well: ``I've known people I've worked with that are. If you
work in Washington, D.C., you're going to run into all kinds of
people.''
 &HT;    Still, Tate insists it is the ``other side'' that forced the
issue by calling Lott's remarks ``backward.'' And there have been
other recent provocations, he says.
 &HT;    In May, President Clinton signed an executive order protecting
federal workers from job discrimination on the basis of sexual
orientation. Last October, Vice President Al Gore gave a speech
praising the now-long-gone TV show ``Ellen,'' whose star, Ellen
DeGeneres, received almost Seinfeld-level coverage when she and the
character she played announced their sexual preference for women.
 &HT;    ``We needed to speak out and the issue took off,'' Tate says.
``But when people say this is done to energize the base, I'd say
this is being pushed by Clinton to energize their base because
homosexuals are a key constituency.''
 &HT;    The head of the liberal People for the American Way, Carole
Shields, believes all this talk about the gay agenda will help Tate
raise some quick cash and turn out conservative voters _ as he
must, if he is to prove the group is still strong under the current
management. But she believes it will cost him in the long run as
the coalition tries to grow.
 &HT;    Moderates in the Republican Party agree. And even some
conservatives are skeptical. Rep. Steve Largent, a Christian
conservative from Oklahoma, says he has to wonder if the issue
hasn't been resurrected to fill a vacuum in a campaign season short
on substance.
 &HT;    ``I really oppose the homosexual agenda, but I think it's wrong
for political purposes to try to capitalize on that, and I'm not
saying the Christian Coalition is doing that,'' he says. ``But if I
were the Christian Coalition, the week after I ran those ads I
would also run an ad about how destructive adultery is to families.
I don't think there's a hierarchy of sin.''
 &HT;    Especially in recent years, Reed worked overtime to position the
coalition as squarely in the mainstream. Though Tate too insists
the coalition is in the mainstream, he was hired to reheat the old
rhetoric. And his biggest problem is Reed.
 &HT;    In his eight years with the Christian Coalition, Reed used
political instinct and media savvy to build the mailing list left
over from Pat Robertson's presidential run into the most important
lobbying group on the right. As his successor, Tate is probably
bound to feel constantly compared with the other guy and found
lacking. As Largent says, ``I'm not sure anybody could fill Ralph
Reed's shoes.''
 &HT;    In a way, nobody did. When Reed left the coalition a year ago to
start a political consulting business, Robertson split his old job
in two. First he hired Tate, now 32, a true-believing,
old-fashioned retail politician from Washington State who was
looking for work after losing his congressional seat.
 &HT;    Then Robertson paired Tate _ undercut him, some say _ with
Donald Hodel, a 63-year-old former Reagan energy and interior
secretary.
 &HT;    As Robertson says in a telephone interview: ``Randy's a
different kind of guy. Ralph is more analytical and cerebral in
terms of political strategy. They're both young and energetic and
dedicated, but Ralph is unique. He has a strategic mind that few
have.''
 &HT;    And Tate? Robertson mentions his youth, tempered by Hodel's
experience, and then says: ``He really is an extremely dedicated
person, to the Lord, his family and American and conservative
values. He's constantly up, always cheery, and it seemed he could
help mobilize the troops.''
 &HT;    Cheery? Seemed? Some conservatives wonder if Robertson didn't
also choose Tate in part because he wanted to take back some of the
power that Reed had assumed. ``I have in my own, quiet way,''
Robertson says, ``been setting the agenda for a long time.''
 &HT;    Robertson also notes that Reed left the organization with a few
challenges beyond wondering how his successors could possibly
measure up. Contributions had dropped off steeply, perhaps because
Reed had announced he was leaving. But as his old boss sees it,
``The direct mail wasn't good, the vendor was poor and Ralph was in
transition and not focusing.''
 &HT;    And though Tate never speaks other than respectfully of the act
he has had to follow, his chief spokesman, Arne Owens, says that
Tate and Hodel inherited some major problems after years of
phenomenal growth, the result in part of poor financial planning
and a comptroller who embezzled from the group.
 &HT;    Last year at this time, Owens says, the organization was $1.2
million in the red. ``Don and Randy took over and that's what they
were greeted with,'' Owens says. ``That's versus about $1 million
in the black now.''
 &HT;    (The normally ultra-accessible Reed returned the umpteenth phone
call left for him over several weeks on a Friday evening, very much
like someone who wants to leave a message rather than talk to the
person they are calling. When the call was answered, he passed on
the chance to talk on the record.)
 &HT;    Whatever the true state of the coalition's books, which have
always been closed except for the tiny peek provided by a
bare-bones annual report, Robertson's decision to give Tate only
half of Reed's old job was seen as more evidence that Tate is not a
player on Reed's level.
 &HT;    The plan was that Hodel would raise money and oversee finances
and Tate, who had found his calling to the political life as a
volunteer in Robertson's 1988 presidential bid, would serve as
chief lobbyist, spokesman and operational head.
 &HT;    And things do seem to have gone well for Tate on the local level
in the last year, with major wins in helping defeat an Oklahoma
casino expansion bill and a gay-rights referendum in Maine, where
the coalition distributed some 250,000 voter guides.
 &HT;    But the lobbying and quote-mongering aspects of the job have
clearly not been such an easy fit, in no small measure because Tate
has failed to pull off Reed's great trick of magnifying the
strength of both his grass roots and lobbying with more or less
constant media attention _ which brought in more money, which
strengthened the grass roots and lobbying, which got him more
attention and so on.
 &HT;    When Tate calls on former colleagues, there is none of the
menacing background music that seems to thrill official Washington,
no sense that if attention is not paid, he could tie up every phone
line of the Hill and go home laughing.
 &HT;    Tate has also been drowned out by other voices on the right as
more-camera-ready conservatives have scrambled to fill the
personality void left by Reed. Gary Bauer of the Family Research
Council has been so encouraged by the new windfall of attention
that he's talking about running for president. (Robertson advises
that he should ``go take a cold shower'' instead.)
 &HT;    Before his stroke in June, James Dobson, the Colorado religious
broadcaster whose radio program reaches millions, was the man to
see. He was seen as the one who brought the Republican leadership
around to the religious right's agenda this spring, when he
threatened to bolt the party if his people were not romanced with a
little more feeling. Soon, Gingrich and the rest were vowing to
make good on their old promises, swearing they would kill the
National Endowment for the Arts this time.
 &HT;    Tate is disarming in appearance, a 5-foot-8, prematurely bald
guy who has trouble keeping weight on. He says he has felt picked
on as a Christian from the day he first announced for the state
legislature at age 22. ``I had horns,'' he says.
 &HT;    He feels particularly vilified by the press, and in Chesapeake,
Va., at his group's style-free concrete headquarters, where no
visitor could conceivably accuse the coalition of wasting money on
amenities, the local paper, The Virginian-Pilot, is better known as
The Virginia Plot.
 &HT;    Tate's wife, Julie, who stays home with their two young children
and meets him enthusiastically at the door in the middle of a
workday _ ``You're staying here till dinner, right?'' _ says she
thinks stereotypes about Christians are the result of plain old
guilt. ``People don't like to think there's a right and a wrong, so
imagine how they feel about Randy. But truth is truth, whether you
believe it or not,'' she says, serving espresso and almond bread on
the patio out in back of their new home in a new subdivision.
 &HT;    Tate grew up in Puyallup, in the state he calls ``the real
Washington,'' the third of five children in a highly political and
extremely religious family. His ambition coming out of school was
maybe to start a construction business with a few friends, but his
mom talked him into continuing his education while working full
time.
 &HT;    He met his wife, who calls herself ``the helpmate,'' at age 17
on a blind date set up by another girl Randy had dated a few times.
They are alike, it is easy to see, and convinced that God wants
them right where they are. Their life together is ordered, with the
kids in bed every evening at 6:30.
 &HT;    ``It's hard sometimes,'' Julie Tate says, ``like when he went to
the White House Correspondents dinner. He's meeting Sharon Stone
and I'm scraping Cheerios off the floor in my jammies. But I have
to keep in mind that he gets to go to that dinner because I'm
taking care of his kids. It's important to be a team.'' She adds
that she never thought their team would be in and out of Congress
by the time they were in their early 30s.
 &HT;    In this job, Tate allows, ``the odds are against us. I've kind
of been an underdog my whole life.'' Still, he can't help sounding
like a really good salesman when he talks about the virtually
untapped market of religious conservatives who aren't even involved
in the political life _ yet. The coalition wants to sign up 100,000
new contacts in churches around the country by the year 2000, and
is recruiting them at a series of small coffees, with a teaching
video starring Tate.
 &HT;    This low-tech approach, ``water cooler politics,'' as he calls
it, obviously appeals to Tate, who seems happiest recalling the
mornings he spent as a candidate, standing on traffic medians in
the rain, waving at potential voters. It is possible that Tate's
tactics will prevail, that they will strengthen the coalition
around the country.
 &HT;    But in Washington, perception _ as measured in television
appearances and phone calls returned _ is power. And the perception
there is that Randy Tate, unlike his predecessor, does not quite
understand that.

 By DAVID SAMUELS  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    In Washington, tennis is something of a ritual sport. And of all
the hardened Beltway competitors at the St. Albans Tennis Club,
from Jack Valenti to Vernon Jordan to Strobe Talbott, not one is
more famous for his flat-out desire to win than the middle-aged man
on court No. 8 serving this morning, down two games to one.
 &HT;    Facing the net, he fiddles with his glasses, then squares his
shoulders like a football lineman. He tosses the ball in the air,
grunts as he serves, rushes the net, then grimaces as the ball
whizzes by him.
 &HT;    ``Did you see him scamper?'' asks his opponent, Timothy Wirth,
the former senator from Colorado. ``It's nice to see him scamper
like that.''
 &HT;    Wirth looks like a senator, the one that Robert Redford played
in ``The Candidate,'' with aging good looks and a penumbra of
slightly fuzzy charm. He likes looking good on the court.
 &HT;    His opponent, Terry Lenzner, doesn't much care how he looks. The
object of his game is to win. When he hits his next serve long, his
eyes narrow.
 &HT;    ``Want to change the rules, Lenzner?'' Wirth asks.
 &HT;    Whether Lenzner plays by the rules is the subject of much
high-powered speculation in Washington these days. As the private
investigator hired by President Clinton's lawyers, Lenzner is a
front-line soldier in a new kind of war, in which embarrassing
information about political and legal opponents is provided for use
as ammunition in today's partisan culture of scandal.
 &HT;    Within the past year, Lenzner has testified before a Senate
committee about the president's legal-defense fund and, most
recently, before the grand jury of the independent counsel, Kenneth
Starr, about his activities on behalf of the president's lawyers.
 &HT;    It's a far cry from the young lawyer who sat at Sam Ervin's
elbow during the Senate Watergate hearings 25 years ago. In recent
months, the New York Times columnist William Safire has called
Lenzner a ``big bully'' for his aggressive style, while Safire's
colleague Frank Rich referred to him as a ``creep'' for
investigating the tobacco company whistle-blower Jeffrey Wigand.
 &HT;    ``To hire plumbers, to affect the trials of people through
adverse publicity, that's wrong,'' says Ronald Rotunda, a professor
of law at the University of Illinois who served with Lenzner on the
Senate Watergate committee and is currently a special consultant to
Starr. ``Assuming that it was all legal, and people weren't bribed
somewhere along the way, I still think it is wrong.''
 &HT;    Citing what he believes to be a deliberate tactic of digging up
dirt on the president's accusers, such as Paula Jones, and then
leaking it to the press, he adds, ``For Terry to be involved in
this is sad and appalling.''
 &HT;    Yet what Lenzner has actually done (or not done) for the
president remains a mystery. After a long series of denials,
half-denials and evasions, the president's lawyers, David E.
Kendall and Robert S. Bennett, admitted in a news release dated
Feb. 24, 1998, to having employed Lenzner and his company,
Investigative Group International (IGI), since 1994.
 &HT;    ``It is common for private counsel to retain commercial
investigative services to perform legal and appropriate tasks in
the defense of a client,'' they stated.
 &HT;    Dick Morris, the former Clinton strategist (and no stranger to
hyperbole), puts it a different way: He calls Lenzner the head of
``the White House secret police.''
 &HT;    Lenzner's activities _ at least now _ may not be quite as
extensive as many published reports have implied, according to a
prominent source close to the president's legal defense. The source
says that IGI has performed a variety of legal-defense-related
tasks, not all of them publicly reported, including digging up
information on Paula Jones' sexual history through interviews and
public-record searches, tracing the financing of the anti-Clinton
network surrounding the millionaire publisher Richard Mellon Scaife
and compiling public-record dossiers on ``likely courtroom
opponents'' _ presumably including the independent counsel.
 &HT;    This is, at first glance, strange work for a man who helped
solve the murders of three civil-rights workers in Philadelphia,
Miss., in 1964 (the ``Mississippi Burning'' case), who headed the
Office of Legal Services in 1970 and who slapped a subpoena on
Richard Nixon in 1974 as assistant chief counsel to the Senate
Watergate committee. If this sounds like the resume of a
soft-boiled idealist, however, Lenzner would be the first to set
you straight. He is not interested in ideals. He is interested in
facts.
 &HT;    Since 1984, when he founded a small investigative group with a
staff of three, Lenzner's empire _ his own private FBI _ has grown
to include nearly 100 full-time investigators working out of the
Washington headquarters of Investigative Group International, as
well as field offices in Los Angeles, New York, Boston, Chicago,
Seattle, San Francisco and London.
 &HT;    Among IGI's investigators are lawyers from some of the better
law firms in the country, as well as former police detectives and
FBI, CIA and DEA agents, reporters and news producers from ABC, NBC
and CBS. Raymond Kelly, now an under-secretary of the treasury
department, is a former IGI investigator, as is Brooke Shearer, now
at the Interior Department.
 &HT;    ``One of the real pleasures of this job, to me, is that I get to
deal with people that I've worked with for the last 25 years,''
says Larry Potts, a former deputy director of the FBI who now runs
IGI's worldwide operations. ``I get to work with people who left
the Bureau and became directors of security. I get to work with
former United States attorneys. I mean, to me, it's like being at
home. You're just working with the same folks you've always worked
with.''
 &HT;    If this morning's case meeting at IGI is not entirely
representative of the company's clientele (usually Fortune 500
corporations, high-tech firms, investment banks, law firms and
prominent politicians of both parties), it is a good example of how
the company does its work.
 &HT;    Seated around the long table in the conference room, with two
Robert Motherwell-like abstractions on the walls and a pair of
faceless Kabuki dolls on either side of the door, are two IGI
investigators and a freshly showered Lenzner. This morning's client
is Robert Nixon, who represents a Washington environmental group
and has agreed to the presence of a reporter.
 &HT;    The group wants IGI to look into a complicated real-estate deal
related to a mysterious London-based contessa, Bina Sella di
Monteluce, who has reportedly spent $11 million to persuade
Congress, the Interior Department and the District of Columbia City
Council to allow her to build an ``educational theme park'' on
national parkland in the Anacostia River.
 &HT;    In 1996, Congress passed a bill transferring the land _ now
known as Children's Island _ from the National Park Service to the
District of Columbia. Nixon explains that last December the City
Council voted to approve the contessa's lease, which included a
99-year term, plus a number of other sweetheart provisions. The
contessa's lobbyists, Nixon continues, include close associates of
Washington's mayor, Marion Barry.
 &HT;    ``We need to pull registration statements on all the lawyers,''
says Margot Critchfield, a former NBC news producer. ``There should
be an IRS Form 990 that has to be filed. That's one of the few tax
forms that's open to inspection.''
 &HT;    Lenzner is getting more excited. ``There's money moving
around,'' he says, tugging on his black-framed Nixon-era glasses
and slowly massaging the knuckle of the ring finger on his right
hand. ``There's legislation being introduced. There's Interior
Department movement.''
 &HT;    As he talks, I notice that the knuckle is swollen to two or
three times the normal size and that his ring finger is bent at a
distinct angle. It is an old football injury that never healed
right, and it gives him a slightly dangerous, back-alley look,
thoroughly in keeping with his broad shoulders and powerful hands.
With his glasses off, however, his eyes look surprisingly soft and
a little sad.
 &HT;    ``The ultimate question here,'' he says a moment later, ``is
what we can do with these facts to stop the development from
proceeding. Because getting the facts is only going to be helpful
if they meet some larger goal. There could be a PR strategy here.
There could be a legal strategy.''
 &HT;    This is the stuff of which politicians' nightmares are made. The
initial trace of the backgrounds and holdings of the people
involved in the project _ information such as their names,
addresses, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, the make and
the value of the cars they own, the value of the mortgages on their
homes, any federal political contributions they may have made, as
well as any mention of their activities in the news media _
involves little more than the press of a button.
 &HT;    ``Try the dentist,'' says Robert Walters, a former newspaper
reporter and syndicated columnist, referring to a man whose name
appears on the Children's Island corporation documents. ``I'm
fascinated by him.''
 &HT;    Connie Manwell, IGI's resident Washington information
specialist, taps a few keys on her computer and waits for the
information to download. The information services that IGI uses are
all commercially available. They include news and legal databases,
such as Dow Jones, Lexis-Nexis and Pacer, commonly used by
reporters and law firms.
 &HT;    They also include a service called Auto Track, which finds
current and previous addresses, allowing investigators to interview
neighbors, and which connects people to cars and property,
bankruptcy records and professional licenses. Another tool is CDB
Infotech, which provides financial information on individuals,
including the value and source of current mortgages and loans. And
there is more.
 &HT;    ``Some states will sell you driver's license information,''
Manwell explains, as she waits for the dentist's Auto Track file to
load, ''including your address, Social Security number, your
height, weight and the color of your eyes. Nearly anything you can
imagine is out there, including the illegal stuff, like your
medical records, credit-card bills, bank balances and the rest. We
don't touch it, but it's there.''
 &HT;    As the Children's Island investigation enters its initial phase,
Lenzner sits in his office and takes calls, his shoulders slightly
hunched, his attention tightly centered on the phone, as if he were
inhaling something vital from the receiver.
 &HT;    Scattered around his office are the big-game trophies of his
investigative career: the famous Nixon subpoena and a banner
headline, ``Alaska Wins, Oil Companies Lose,'' as well as a framed
picture of himself as the Harvard football captain, No. 60, making
a flying tackle of a quarterback from Yale.
 &HT;    On the other end of the line is Terrence Burke, a highly
decorated former CIA officer and onetime acting director of the DEA
who now runs IGI's foreign operations. Burke's active case file,
displayed on the screen on Lenzner's desk, reveals the company's
bread-and-butter casework: investigations into bid-rigging,
bribery, high-tech theft, counterfeiting and other possible crimes
in Egypt, Bangladesh, Singapore, China, Malaysia, Norway, Kuwait,
England, Chile, Macedonia, Serbia and Montenegro. Fees range from
several thousand dollars for a simple inquiry to hundreds of
thousands of dollars for a complex case.
 &HT;    IGI's ability to combine powerful computer technology with the
field experience of investigators such as Burke represents a
quantum leap over the gumshoe methods of a Philip Marlowe or Sam
Spade. It can also cause a great deal of trouble if you happen to
be the target of the investigation.
 &HT;    The Wigand investigation, conducted by IGI's New York office
under the direction of Ray Kelly, a former New York City police
commissioner, along with investigators not hired by IGI,
illustrates just how nasty this kind of work can get. Documents
portraying Wigand as a liar, shoplifter and wife-beater were leaked
to The Wall Street Journal, which published the allegations in
1996. While the documents were real, the accusations they were
intended to support were ultimately shown to be without substantial
basis in fact.
 &HT;    In Lenzner's opinion, however, the Wigand case could just as
easily have gone the other way. What if Wigand was a liar? What if
the tobacco company was right? ``I'm not quick to make moral
objections about people,'' he says. ``What drew me to Mississippi,
I'm going to be candid with you _ I had no moral compulsion to go
down there and save the world.''
 &HT;    It is this ability to see the world in dispassionate shades of
gray, without making assumptions, he says, that makes him a good
investigator. ``What you need to do is to think about what's going
on, understand it and learn more about it. And if you think about
it, that's what the civil liberties stuff was about. That's what
Watergate was about. I enjoy asking questions and getting
answers.''
 &HT;    Our conversation about his work for President Clinton takes
place during a two-hour interview, which I am not allowed to
record. It is an interesting performance, a display of toughness, a
chance to answer his critics and, most of all, to let off steam
after four years of rumors and half-truths.
 &HT;    He describes his February appearance before the grand jury with
a combativeness that echoes the most recent pronouncements by White
House sources.
 &HT;    ``I spent a lot of my time making eye contact with the grand
jury members,'' he says. ``And before I left, I told them that I
would be happy to see them again, but to please call me at my
office and not to send two FBI agents to my house with a
subpoena.''
 &HT;    When it comes to the questions asked by the special prosecutor
Jackie Bennett, Lenzner is unusually specific. ``They wanted to
know if I knew Sidney Blumenthal,'' he says. ``And I told them
that, yes, I do know Sid Blumenthal. I just met him 10 minutes ago
outside. And they wanted to know if I had ever investigated Ken
Starr, and whether I had ever conducted an investigation of the
other prosecutors. They seemed most interested in whether or not I
had investigated them. They also asked me, `When was the last time
you reported to the president?' And I told them that I've never met
the president, and I've never talked to him in my life.''
 &HT;    Asked if he is proud of the work that he did for the president,
however, Lenzner's answer is surprisingly ambivalent. ``The overall
answer is yes,'' he says. ``But I include in that the work we have
done for the DNC, as well as the Paula Jones case and other matters
in which we have been involved.''
 &HT;    What is most surprising is how normal Lenzner makes all this
sound. If Lenzner's rise tells us anything about the scandal wars
of the '90s, it may be that the power once held by J. Edgar Hoover
_ someone who worked behind the scenes, who knew all the secrets
and exerted enormous influence on public affairs _ has passed into
the hands of private men.
 &HT;    ``There's something satisfying about walking around with a
reserve bank of information that nobody else has, or few people
have,'' Lenzner says.
 &HT;    ``With an understanding of things that go on inside companies
and universities and charities and governments. But I never would
have had that chance if I hadn't become what I have become. And I
love that part. I'll be frank with you on that.''

 By D.T. MAX  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    For much of the past 20 years, Gordon Lish, an editor at Esquire
and then at Alfred A. Knopf who is now retired, has been quietly
telling friends that he played a crucial role in the creation of
the early short stories of Raymond Carver.
 &HT;    The details varied from telling to telling, but the basic idea
was that he had changed some of the stories so much that they were
more his than Carver's.
 &HT;    No one quite knew what to make of his statements. Carver, who
died 10 years ago this month, never responded in public to them.
Basically it was Lish's word against common sense. Lish had written
fiction too: If he was such a great talent, why did so few people
care about his work?
 &HT;    As the years passed, Lish became reluctant to discuss the
subject. Maybe he was choosing silence over people's doubt. Maybe
he had rethought what his contribution had been _ or simply moved
on.
 &HT;    Seven years ago, Lish arranged for the sale of his papers to the
Lilly Library at Indiana University. Since then, only a few Carver
scholars have examined the Lish manuscripts thoroughly. When one
tried to publish his conclusions, Carver's widow and literary
executor, the poet Tess Gallagher, effectively blocked him with
copyright cautions and pressure.
 &HT;    I'd heard about this scholar's work (and its failure to be
published) through a friend. So I decided to visit the archive
myself.
 &HT;    What I found there, when I began looking at the manuscripts of
stories such as ``Fat'' and ``Tell the Women We're Going,'' were
pages full of editorial marks _ strikeouts, additions and marginal
comments in Lish's sprawling handwriting. It looked as if a
temperamental 7-year-old had somehow got hold of the stories.
 &HT;    As I was reading, one of the archivists came over. I thought she
was going to reprimand me for some violation of the library rules.
But that wasn't why she was there. She wanted to talk about Carver.
 &HT;    ``I started reading the folders,'' she said, ''but then I
stopped when I saw what was in there.''
 -0- 
 &HT;    It's understandable that Lish's assertions have never been taken
seriously. The eccentric editor is up against an American icon.
When he died at age 50 from lung cancer, Carver was considered by
many to be America's most important short-story writer. His stories
were beautiful and moving.
 &HT;    At a New York City memorial service, Robert Gottlieb, then the
editor of The New Yorker, said succinctly, ``America has just lost
the writer it could least afford to lose.''
 &HT;    Carver is no longer a writer of the moment, the way David Foster
Wallace is today, but many of his stories _ ``Cathedral,'' ``Will
You Please Be Quiet, Please?'' and ``Errand'' _ are firmly
established in the literary canon. A vanguard figure in the 1980s,
Carver has become establishment fiction.
 &HT;    That doesn't capture his claim on us though. It goes deeper than
his work. Born in the rural Northwest, Carver was the child of an
alcoholic sawmill worker and a waitress. He first learned to write
through a correspondence course. He lived in poverty and suffered
multiple bouts of alcoholism throughout his 30s. He struggled in a
difficult marriage with his high-school girlfriend, Maryann Burk.
 &HT;    Through it all he remained a generous, determined man _
fiction's comeback kid. By 1980, he had quit drinking and moved in
with Gallagher, with whom he spent the rest of his life.
 &HT;    ``I know better than anyone a fellow is never out of the
woods,'' he wrote to Lish in one of dozens of letters archived at
the Lilly. ``But right now it's aces, and I'm enjoying it.''
Carver's life and work inspired faith, not skepticism.
 &HT;    Still, a quick look through Carver's books would suggest that
what Lish claims might have some merit. There is an evident gap
between the early style of ``Will You Please Be Quiet, Please?''
and ``What We Talk About When We Talk About Love,'' Carver's first
two major collections, and his later work in ``Cathedral'' and
``Where I'm Calling From.''
 &HT;    In subject matter, the stories share a great deal. They are
mostly about the working poor _ unemployed salesmen, waitresses,
motel managers _ in the midst of disheartening lives. But the early
collections, which Lish edited, are stripped to the bone. They are
minimalist in style with an almost abstract feel. They drop their
characters back down where they find them, inarticulate and alone,
drunk at noon. The later two collections are fuller, touched by
optimism, even sentimentality.
 &HT;    Many critics over the years have noticed this difference and
explained it in terms of biography. The Carver of the early
stories, it has been said, was in despair. As he grew successful,
however, the writer learned about hopefulness and love, and it
soaked into his fiction.
 &HT;    This redemptive story was burnished through countless retellings
by Gallagher. Most critics seemed satisfied by this literal-minded
explanation: Happy writers write happy stories.

 &HT;    Sitting under the coffered ceiling of the Lilly, I began pulling
out folders from the two boxes marked ``Carver.'' Here were the
stories from his first two collections as well as from
``Cathedral'' in versions from manuscript to printer's galleys.
 &HT;    I had previously seen some manuscripts in the Carver holdings at
Ohio State University, an archive to which Gallagher has said she
will ultimately give the Carver papers in her possession. The
manuscripts at OSU are clean, almost without editing marks, as if
they'd gone straight from author to typesetter. Where there are
multiple drafts of a manuscript, the procession is unremarkable:
The annotations in Carver's tiny handwriting drive the story
confidently from draft to draft until the story achieves its
finished form.
 &HT;    The Lilly manuscripts are different. There are countless cuts
and additions to the pages; entire paragraphs have been added.
Lish's black felt-tip markings sometimes obliterate the original
text.
 &HT;    In the case of Carver's 1981 collection, ``What We Talk About
When We Talk About Love,'' Lish cut about half the original words
and rewrote 10 of the 13 endings. ``Carol, story ends here,'' he
would note for the benefit of his typist.
 &HT;    In ``Mr. Coffee and Mr. Fixit,'' for example, Lish cut 70
percent of the original words. With a longer story, ``A Small, Good
Thing,'' in which a couple anxiously wait for their child to come
out of a coma, Lish cut the text by a third, eliminating most of
the description _ and all of the introspection. He retitled it
``The Bath,'' altering the story's redemptive tone to one of
Beckettian despair. In Lish's version, you no longer know if the
child lives or dies.
 &HT;    Lish was constantly on guard against what he saw as Carver's
creeping sentimentality. In the original manuscripts, Carver's
characters talk about their feelings. They talk about regrets. When
they do bad things, they cry. When Lish got hold of Carver, they
stopped crying. They stopped feeling.
 &HT;    Lish loved deadpan last lines, and he freely wrote them in:
``The women, they weren't there when I left, and they wouldn't be
there when I got back'' (``Night School''). Other times, he cut
away whole sections to leave a sentence from inside the story as
the end: ``There were dogs and there were dogs. Some dogs you just
couldn't do anything with'' (``Jerry and Molly and Sam'').
 &HT;    On occasion, Carver reversed his changes, but in most cases
Lish's handwriting became part of Carver's next draft, which became
the published story.
 &HT;    ``Fat'' was one of the first stories Carver gave Lish to edit.
It became the lead story in ``Will You Please Be Quiet, Please?''
In ``Fat,'' a restaurant waitress recounts to her friend Rita a
large meal she served to a ravenous but melancholy obese man. The
waitress's lover, Rudy, the restaurant cook, feels jealous. When
they get home, he insists on having sex with her, but her mind
remains with her experiences in the restaurant: The fat man has
touched her in some way, made her feel dissatisfied with her life.
This was how Carver wrote it, more as an anecdote than a story.
 &HT;    It proved excellent material for Lish's talents. Some of what
Lish does is technical: He moves the story into the present tense,
for example. And he eliminates the waitress's self-reflectiveness,
so we seem more involved than she does in what she is feeling.
(Critics would later declare such touches to be trademark
techniques of Carver.)
 &HT;    Most important, Lish picks up on the ``long, thick, creamy
fingers'' Carver gives the fat man, and finds in this the story's
core _ the connection between longing and sexuality.
 &HT;    ``My God, Rita, those were fingers,'' the waitress tells her
girlfriend, who herself has ``dainty fingers.'' At the end, when
Rudy gets into bed with her, she observes, ``Rudy is a tiny thing
and hardly there at all.''
 &HT;    These lines _ and several others _ were written by Lish. In
Lish's hands, fatness becomes sexual potency, fullness, presence.
He finds the resonance Carver missed.
 &HT;    If ``Fat'' was a successful _ if unusually extensive _ edit,
Lish's efforts on another story, ``Tell the Women We're Going,''
seemed closer to a wholesale rewrite. Written by Carver in the late
1960s or early '70s, the story was unusual for him, one of the few
in which the violence implicit in his characters becomes explicit.
 &HT;    The story first made an appearance as ``Friendship'' in
Sou'wester, a small literary magazine. By the time it appeared in
the ``What We Talk About'' collection, Lish had retitled it _ and
cut it by 40 percent.
 &HT;    As I thumbed through various manuscripts at the Lilly, my face
was flushed. I wanted Carver to win, whatever that might mean. He
had shown writers the value of measuring your words. He had come
along in the early 1970s when the first ``post-modern'' novelists,
writers such as John Barth and Donald Barthelme, dominated the
literary scene. Their cerebral stories were admirable, but they
were hard to love. Carver broke up their racket.
 &HT;    Overall, Lish's editorial changes generally struck me as for the
better. Some of the cuts were brilliant, like the expert cropping
of a picture. His additions gave the stories new dimensions,
bringing out moments that I was sure Carver must have loved to see.
Other changes, such as those in ``Tell the Women We're Going,''
struck me as bullying and competitive. Lish was redirecting
Carver's vision in the service of his own fictional goals. The act
felt parasitic.
 &HT;    Lish's techniques also grew tired more quickly than did
Carver's. After a while, the endless ``I say,'' ``he says'' tags
Lish placed on so much of the dialogue felt gimmicky. In all cases,
however, I had one sustained reaction: For better or worse, Lish
was in there.
 -0- 
 &HT;    Back in New York I contacted Lish. Much has changed for
``Captain Fiction,'' as the once-dapper Lish was nicknamed during
his Esquire heyday. Now 64, he is a widower, living alone in a
spacious apartment on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. He shuffles
around in his socks, his long white hair and loose clothes making
him look like a vanquished sorcerer.
 &HT;    ``I don't like talking about the Carver period,'' he said,
''because of my sustained sense of his betrayal and because it
seems bad form to discuss this. ... This puts me in an absolutely
impossible light,'' he continued. ``I can only be despised for my
participation.''
 &HT;    Lish already has plenty of enemies: By the 1990s his aggressive
editing, controversial private fiction seminars and taste for
publicity had cost him many friends. ``I said no to the people to
whom one doesn't say no,'' he said.
 &HT;    In 1994, after a decade in which the writers he was championing
found fewer and fewer readers, Knopf fired him. He now writes
fiction full time. His latest is titled ``Self-Imitation of
Myself.'' Reading his stories is like looking at the gears of a
clock that's missing a face.
 &HT;    It was in 1976 that Carver collected his stories in ``Will You
Please Be Quiet, Please?'' including a version of the title story
that Lish had cut.
 &HT;    In The New York Times Book Review, the novelist Geoffrey Wolff,
who would later become a friend of Carver's, hailed the stories,
describing them as ``carefully shaped'' and ``shorn of
ornamentation,'' marked by ``spells of quiet and tensed
apprehension.'' In fact, Wolff wrote, Carver's prose ``carries his
mark everywhere: I would like to believe that having read the
stories I could identify him on the evidence of a paragraph.'' The
collection was nominated for a National Book Award.
 &HT;    Carver was gaining confidence from his success and writing more
ambitiously. And he was finding out the world wasn't so harsh. He
had friends now, acolytes even. He separated from Maryann and
became involved with Tess Gallagher. He bought a boat and
celebrated it in a poem in which he imagined it filled with his
friends.
 &HT;    His editor's confidence was also growing. Lish thought of
himself as Carver's ventriloquist. ``I could not believe no one had
stumbled on what was going on,'' he says. A collision was
inevitable.
 -0- 
 &HT;    Initially, Carver had been grateful for Lish's help _ or perhaps
just compliant or cowed. Carver was in a bad place in his life,
beset by drink and poverty. Lish was his way to a readership.
Nevertheless, Carver's unease was evident from the beginning.
 &HT;    Responding to an edit in December 1969, Carver wrote:
``Everything considered, it's a better story now than when I first
mailed it your way _ which is the important thing, I'm sure.'' He
echoed these sentiments in January 1971. ``Took all of yr changes
and added a few things here and there,'' he wrote, taking pains to
add that he was ``not bothered'' by the extent of Lish's edit.
 &HT;    Carver had a role in keeping the romance going too. ``You've
made a single-handed impression on American letters,'' he wrote
Lish in September 1977. ``And, of course, you know, old bean, just
what influence you've exercised on my life.'' He even offered to
pay the charges for any work Lish sends out to be retyped.
 &HT;    After ``Will You Please Be Quiet, Please?'' they began work on a
second collection, which Lish would ultimately title ``What We Talk
About When We Talk About Love.'' (Carver had called it
``Beginners.'') By that time, Lish was editing more heavily. He
treated Carver as if he barely had a vote.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, Carver was becoming a known literary figure. In 1978
he won a Guggenheim Fellowship. The next year he became a professor
of English at Syracuse University.
 &HT;    Carver began to object to Lish's editing, but he wasn't sure
what to object to. He wrote a five-page letter in July 1980 telling
Lish that he could not allow him to publish ``What We Talk About''
as Lish had edited it.
 &HT;    He wrote, ``Maybe if I were alone, by myself, and no one had
ever seen these stories, maybe then, knowing that your versions are
better than some of the ones I sent, maybe I could get into this
and go with it.'' But he feared being caught.
 &HT;    ``Tess has seen all of these and gone over them closely. Donald
Hall has seen many of the new ones ... and Richard Ford, Toby
Wolff, Geoffrey Wolff, too, some of them. ... How can I explain to
these fellows when I see them, as I will see them, what happened?''
 &HT;    He begged to be let out of his contract or at least to delay
publication: ``Please, Gordon, for God's sake help me in this and
try to understand. . . . I've got to pull out of this one. Please
hear me. I've been up all night thinking on this. ... I'll say it
again, if I have any standing or reputation or cedibility (sic) in
the world, I owe it to you. I owe you this more-or-less pretty
interesting life I have (but) I can't take the risk as to what
might happen to me.''
 &HT;    In the same letter, he wrote imploringly, ``(M)y very sanity is
on the line here. ... I feel it, that if the book were to be
published as it is in its present edited form, I may never write
another story.''
 &HT;    Lish does not recall being moved. ``My sense of it was that
there was a letter and that I just went ahead.'' He knew what was
best for Carver _ even if Carver didn't see it that way.
 &HT;    In the end, ``What We Talk About'' was published much as Lish
wanted. The book received front-page reviews. Critics praised its
minimalist style and announced a new school of fiction. Even so,
Carver continued to press for stylistic control over his work. He
insisted that if Lish wanted to edit his next collection, he would
have to keep his hands off.
 &HT;    ``I can't undergo (that) kind of surgical amputation and
transplantation,'' he wrote Lish in August 1982. ``Please help me
with this book as a good editor, the best ... not as my ghost,'' he
pleaded two months later.
 &HT;    Lish reluctantly complied. ``So be it,'' he wrote in December
1982 after giving the manuscript to ``Cathedral'' only a light edit
_ although he wrote some acerbic criticisms in the margins. Even
then, Carver feared a sneak attack. ``I don't need to tell you that
it's critical for me that there not be any messing around with
titles or text,'' he warned Lish.
 &HT;    Publicly, Carver also began to make a break. He made a point of
telling interviewers that he controlled every aspect of his
stories, invoking the adage that he knew a story was finished when
he went through it once and put the commas in, then went through
again and took the commas out.
 &HT;    Lish was angered by Carver's rebellion. He began asking his
friends whether he should make his ``surrogate work'' public. They
advised him to keep quiet.
 &HT;    Once Carver ended his professional relationship with Lish, he
never looked back. He didn't need to. ``Cathedral'' was his most
celebrated work yet. Famous writers wanted to meet him; Saul Bellow
wrote him an appreciative note. The collection was nominated for
both a Pulitzer and a National Book Critics Circle Award.
 &HT;    Proudly, Carver wrote a letter to Lish in which he noted that
the title story ``went straight from the typewriter into the
mail.''
 &HT;    Indeed, many writers and critics see Carver's later work _
stories such as ``Blackbird Pie'' and ``Errand'' _ as his best
efforts, his final brilliant flowering. Seen in this light, the
Lish period, though responsible for bringing him to national
attention, was an apprenticeship to be transcended.
 -0- 
 &HT;    When interviewers used to ask Carver about his relationship with
``Captain Fiction,'' he always acknowledged Lish as a friend, a
talented editor, a man who had been there for him at a crucial
time. But he carefully avoided talking about the back-and-forth of
their editing relationship, why it had ended or what it might
reveal for those interested in his work.
 &HT;    In 1982, however, he came close. He was in a discussion with
students at the University of Akron and, in response to a student's
question, he began talking about the editor-writer relationship.
 &HT;    He ticked off all the famous examples of heavy editing: F. Scott
Fitzgerald's cutting of Ernest Hemingway's ``Sun Also Rises,''
Maxwell Perkins and Thomas Wolfe, Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot.
 &HT;    Carver quoted Pound's explanation of the process: ``It's
immensely important that great poems be written, but it makes not a
jot of difference who writes them.'' Then he paused. ``That's it.
That's it exactly,'' he said.

 By D.T. MAX  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    For much of the past 20 years, Gordon Lish, an editor at Esquire
and then at Alfred A. Knopf who is now retired, has been quietly
telling friends that he played a crucial role in the creation of
the early short stories of Raymond Carver.
 &HT;    The details varied from telling to telling, but the basic idea
was that he had changed some of the stories so much that they were
more his than Carver's.
 &HT;    No one quite knew what to make of his statements. Carver, who
died 10 years ago this month, never responded in public to them.
Basically it was Lish's word against common sense. Lish had written
fiction too: If he was such a great talent, why did so few people
care about his work?
 &HT;    As the years passed, Lish became reluctant to discuss the
subject. Maybe he was choosing silence over people's doubt. Maybe
he had rethought what his contribution had been _ or simply moved
on.
 &HT;    Seven years ago, Lish arranged for the sale of his papers to the
Lilly Library at Indiana University. Since then, only a few Carver
scholars have examined the Lish manuscripts thoroughly. When one
tried to publish his conclusions, Carver's widow and literary
executor, the poet Tess Gallagher, effectively blocked him with
copyright cautions and pressure.
 &HT;    I'd heard about this scholar's work (and its failure to be
published) through a friend. So I decided to visit the archive
myself.
 &HT;    What I found there, when I began looking at the manuscripts of
stories such as ``Fat'' and ``Tell the Women We're Going,'' were
pages full of editorial marks _ strikeouts, additions and marginal
comments in Lish's sprawling handwriting. It looked as if a
temperamental 7-year-old had somehow got hold of the stories.
 &HT;    As I was reading, one of the archivists came over. I thought she
was going to reprimand me for some violation of the library rules.
But that wasn't why she was there. She wanted to talk about Carver.
 &HT;    ``I started reading the folders,'' she said, ''but then I
stopped when I saw what was in there.''
 -0- 
 &HT;    It's understandable that Lish's assertions have never been taken
seriously. The eccentric editor is up against an American icon.
When he died at age 50 from lung cancer, Carver was considered by
many to be America's most important short-story writer. His stories
were beautiful and moving.
 &HT;    At a New York City memorial service, Robert Gottlieb, then the
editor of The New Yorker, said succinctly, ``America has just lost
the writer it could least afford to lose.''
 &HT;    Carver is no longer a writer of the moment, the way David Foster
Wallace is today, but many of his stories _ ``Cathedral,'' ``Will
You Please Be Quiet, Please?'' and ``Errand'' _ are firmly
established in the literary canon. A vanguard figure in the 1980s,
Carver has become establishment fiction.
 &HT;    That doesn't capture his claim on us though. It goes deeper than
his work. Born in the rural Northwest, Carver was the child of an
alcoholic sawmill worker and a waitress. He first learned to write
through a correspondence course. He lived in poverty and suffered
multiple bouts of alcoholism throughout his 30s. He struggled in a
difficult marriage with his high-school girlfriend, Maryann Burk.
 &HT;    Through it all he remained a generous, determined man _
fiction's comeback kid. By 1980, he had quit drinking and moved in
with Gallagher, with whom he spent the rest of his life.
 &HT;    ``I know better than anyone a fellow is never out of the
woods,'' he wrote to Lish in one of dozens of letters archived at
the Lilly. ``But right now it's aces, and I'm enjoying it.''
Carver's life and work inspired faith, not skepticism.
 &HT;    Still, a quick look through Carver's books would suggest that
what Lish claims might have some merit. There is an evident gap
between the early style of ``Will You Please Be Quiet, Please?''
and ``What We Talk About When We Talk About Love,'' Carver's first
two major collections, and his later work in ``Cathedral'' and
``Where I'm Calling From.''
 &HT;    In subject matter, the stories share a great deal. They are
mostly about the working poor _ unemployed salesmen, waitresses,
motel managers _ in the midst of disheartening lives. But the early
collections, which Lish edited, are stripped to the bone. They are

characters back down where they find them, inarticulate and alone,

''because of my sustained sense of his betrayal and because it
seems bad form to discuss this. ... This puts me in an absolutely
impossible light,'' he continued. ``I can only be despised for my
participation.''
 &HT;    Lish already has plenty of enemies: By the 1990s his aggressive
editing, controversial private fiction seminars and taste for
publicity had cost him many friends. ``I said no to the people to
whom one doesn't say no,'' he said.
 &HT;    In 1994, after a decade in which the writers he was championing
found fewer and fewer readers, Knopf fired him. He now writes
fiction full time. His latest is titled ``Self-Imitation of
Myself.'' Reading his stories is like looking at the gears of a
clock that's missing a face.
 &HT;    It was in 1976 that Carver collected his stories in ``Will You
Please Be Quiet, Please?'' including a version of the title story
that Lish had cut.
 &HT;    In The New York Times Book Review, the novelist Geoffrey Wolff,
who would later become a friend of Carver's, hailed the stories,
describing them as ``carefully shaped'' and ``shorn of
ornamentation,'' marked by ``spells of quiet and tensed
apprehension.'' In fact, Wolff wrote, Carver's prose ``carries his
mark everywhere: I would like to believe that having read the
stories I could identify him on the evidence of a paragraph.'' The
collection was nominated for a National Book Award.
 &HT;    Carver was gaining confidence from his success and writing more
ambitiously. And he was finding out the world wasn't so harsh. He
had friends now, acolytes even. He separated from Maryann and
became involved with Tess Gallagher. He bought a boat and
celebrated it in a poem in which he imagined it filled with his
friends.
 &HT;    His editor's confidence was also growing. Lish thought of
himself as Carver's ventriloquist. ``I could not believe no one had
stumbled on what was going on,'' he says. A collision was
inevitable.
 -0- 
 &HT;    Initially, Carver had been grateful for Lish's help _ or perhaps
just compliant or cowed. Carver was in a bad place in his life,
beset by drink and poverty. Lish was his way to a readership.
Nevertheless, Carver's unease was evident from the beginning.
 &HT;    Responding to an edit in December 1969, Carver wrote:
``Everything considered, it's a better story now than when I first
mailed it your way _ which is the important thing, I'm sure.'' He
echoed these sentiments in January 1971. ``Took all of yr changes
and added a few things here and there,'' he wrote, taking pains to
add that he was ``not bothered'' by the extent of Lish's edit.
 &HT;    Carver had a role in keeping the romance going too. ``You've
made a single-handed impression on American letters,'' he wrote
Lish in September 1977. ``And, of course, you know, old bean, just
what influence you've exercised on my life.'' He even offered to
pay the charges for any work Lish sends out to be retyped.
 &HT;    After ``Will You Please Be Quiet, Please?'' they began work on a
second collection, which Lish would ultimately title ``What We Talk
About When We Talk About Love.'' (Carver had called it
``Beginners.'') By that time, Lish was editing more heavily. He
treated Carver as if he barely had a vote.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, Carver was becoming a known literary figure. In 1978
he won a Guggenheim Fellowship. The next year he became a professor
of English at Syracuse University.
 &HT;    Carver began to object to Lish's editing, but he wasn't sure
what to object to. He wrote a five-page letter in July 1980 telling
Lish that he could not allow him to publish ``What We Talk About''
as Lish had edited it.
 &HT;    He wrote, ``Maybe if I were alone, by myself, and no one had
ever seen these stories, maybe then, knowing that your versions are
better than some of the ones I sent, maybe I could get into this
and go with it.'' But he feared being caught.
 &HT;    ``Tess has seen all of these and gone over them closely. Donald
Hall has seen many of the new ones ... and Richard Ford, Toby
Wolff, Geoffrey Wolff, too, some of them. ... How can I explain to
these fellows when I see them, as I will see them, what happened?''
 &HT;    He begged to be let out of his contract or at least to delay
publication: ``Please, Gordon, for God's sake help me in this and
try to understand. . . . I've got to pull out of this one. Please
hear me. I've been up all night thinking on this. ... I'll say it
again, if I have any standing or reputation or cedibility (sic) in
the world, I owe it to you. I owe you this more-or-less pretty
interesting life I have (but) I can't take the risk as to what
might happen to me.''
 &HT;    In the same letter, he wrote imploringly, ``(M)y very sanity is
on the line here. ... I feel it, that if the book were to be
published as it is in its present edited form, I may never write
another story.''
 &HT;    Lish does not recall being moved. ``My sense of it was that
there was a letter and that I just went ahead.'' He knew what was
best for Carver _ even if Carver didn't see it that way.
 &HT;    In the end, ``What We Talk About'' was published much as Lish
wanted. The book received front-page reviews. Critics praised its
minimalist style and announced a new school of fiction. Even so,
Carver continued to press for stylistic control over his work. He
insisted that if Lish wanted to edit his next collection, he would
have to keep his hands off.
 &HT;    ``I can't undergo (that) kind of surgical amputation and
transplantation,'' he wrote Lish in August 1982. ``Please help me
with this book as a good editor, the best ... not as my ghost,'' he
pleaded two months later.
 &HT;    Lish reluctantly complied. ``So be it,'' he wrote in December
1982 after giving the manuscript to ``Cathedral'' only a light edit
_ although he wrote some acerbic criticisms in the margins. Even
then, Carver feared a sneak attack. ``I don't need to tell you that
it's critical for me that there not be any messing around with
titles or text,'' he warned Lish.
 &HT;    Publicly, Carver also began to make a break. He made a point of
telling interviewers that he controlled every aspect of his
stories, invoking the adage that he knew a story was finished when
he went through it once and put the commas in, then went through
again and took the commas out.
 &HT;    Lish was angered by Carver's rebellion. He began asking his
friends whether he should make his ``surrogate work'' public. They
advised him to keep quiet.
 &HT;    Once Carver ended his professional relationship with Lish, he
never looked back. He didn't need to. ``Cathedral'' was his most
celebrated work yet. Famous writers wanted to meet him; Saul Bellow
wrote him an appreciative note. The collection was nominated for
both a Pulitzer and a National Book Critics Circle Award.
 &HT;    Proudly, Carver wrote a letter to Lish in which he noted that
the title story ``went straight from the typewriter into the
mail.''
 &HT;    Indeed, many writers and critics see Carver's later work _
stories such as ``Blackbird Pie'' and ``Errand'' _ as his best
efforts, his final brilliant flowering. Seen in this light, the
Lish period, though responsible for bringing him to national
attention, was an apprenticeship to be transcended.
 -0- 
 &HT;    When interviewers used to ask Carver about his relationship with
``Captain Fiction,'' he always acknowledged Lish as a friend, a
talented editor, a man who had been there for him at a crucial
time. But he carefully avoided talking about the back-and-forth of
their editing relationship, why it had ended or what it might
reveal for those interested in his work.
 &HT;    In 1982, however, he came close. He was in a discussion with
students at the University of Akron and, in response to a student's
question, he began talking about the editor-writer relationship.
 &HT;    He ticked off all the famous examples of heavy editing: F. Scott
Fitzgerald's cutting of Ernest Hemingway's ``Sun Also Rises,''
Maxwell Perkins and Thomas Wolfe, Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot.
 &HT;    Carver quoted Pound's explanation of the process: ``It's
immensely important that great poems be written, but it makes not a
jot of difference who writes them.'' Then he paused. ``That's it.
That's it exactly,'' he said.

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ A survey of recently published books:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; MANAGING MARTIANS &QL; 
 &UR; Donna Shirley (Broadway, $25)
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a sturdy little gal,'' says Donna Shirley about
Sojourner Truth, the 25-pound robot (it was the size of a microwave
oven) that sent remarkable images back to Earth from the planet
Mars last year. Shirley headed the team that had spent four years
designing and building Sojourner, which was a rip-roaring success,
broadcasting back to Earth 10 times longer than expected. It also
was a bargain at $25 million (the entire Mars misson cost less than
it took to make the movie ``Titanic''). This is Shirley's memoir.
Born in 1941 in Oklahoma, she grew up ``a smart, mouthy tomboy in a
2,500-person town where the ideal of womanhood carried with it a
lot of chiffon and mascara.'' At 10, she decided to become an
aeronautical engineer and build airplanes. At 16 she received her
pilot's license. A year later she started engineering school at the
University of Oklahoma, the only woman in her class. Her career in
space exploration began at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in
California, where she became manager of the Mars Exploration
Program. The ``Martians'' of her title are the creative people on
her team, who helped her realize her lifelong dream of getting to
Mars despite limited budgets and other obstacles. This is the
engaging story of a strong, confident woman who knew through it all
that she could, as she says, ``endure and even triumph over
anything.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; PASS THE POLENTA &QL; 
 &UR; Teresa Lust (Steer Forth, $24)
</P>
<P>
   Frances Mayes, author of the delectable ``Under the Tuscan
Sun,'' notes on the cover of this book that Teresa Lust is
appropriately named because her passion for food is in every word
she writes. And it's true, your mouth will water from start to
finish. The pages she devotes to the simple but exotically named
leftover, polenta (known in the southern United States, she reminds
us, as cornmeal mush), are downright intoxicating. Other subjects
include roast chicken, sauerkraut, homemade bread, wine, pie
crusts, soup and strawberry shortcake, all presented with a minimum
of pretense and an abundance of sensual delight in good home
cooking. Lust set out to write a traditional cookbook but in the
end produced a volume of essays, with some recipes thrown in at the
end. She calls it ``two parts memoir, one part recipe collection,
one part natural history and a pinch each of culinary trivia and
personal meditation.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ALIEN INVASION &QL; 
 &UR; Robert Devine (National Geographic, $24)
</P>
<P>
   It is, writes Devine, the least-known of the world's major
environmental issues. ``Alien invasion'' is the infiltration of
non-native, exotic, or non-indigenous animals or plants into a new
environment, with potentially disastrous effects on the ecosystem.
This sounds like an important issue, but unless you are an educated
environmentalist you probably won't get far into this book before
you pack up and retreat to blessed oblivion. Devine describes
threats and hazards and things run amok, complex problems with
complex symptoms and solutions. It's not easy to slog through, even
though he's aiming for general readers. (Alien weeds, we notice,
seem to be a particular problem _ weeds that are ``reaching the
upswing in their exponential growth curves'' with dire
consequences.) Bruce Babbitt has contributed a short, readable
introduction, but otherwise the message gets lost in the delivery. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; INTO THE WILDERNESS &QL; 
 &UR; Sara Donati (Bantam, $22.95)
</P>
<P>
   That's an endorsement from Diana Gabaldon at the top of the dust
cover, above Donati's name, above even the title, because there's
no one in the world Bantam would rather have associated with this
first novel. Gabaldon's audience is huge, and Donati's book is
practically a homage to the kind of story Gabaldon is known for:
It's long (700 pages) and set in the past (on the American frontier
in the late 1700s), has a strong heroine who finds love and great
sex with a virile and devoted man, is written well enough that it
doesn't insult a reader's intelligence (except in the sex scenes)
and has more adventure than any heroine should be able to survive.
And the coup de grace: The next installment is already in the
works. When Gabaldon says nice things about you, you can afford to
be bold. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; SMOKE SIGNALS: A SCREENPLAY &QL; 
 &UR; Sherman Alexie (Hyperion, $10.95)
</P>
<P>
   Alexie likes to say that the entire budget for his movie,
``Smoke Signals,'' was less than the cost of one chandelier on
``Titanic.'' And as for Alexie's movie tie-in _ well, there are no
towering photographs of sad-eyed lovers, no special effects and
hardly any water (much of this story is set in Phoenix), but you'll
get more for your buck and you'll learn about filmmaking that is
driven by heart and soul rather than cash and clout. Alexie
prefaces his script with a short essay that is full of his pleasure
over the fact that this movie _ the first feature film written,
directed and co-produced by Indians to receive major distribution _
was ever made. He says screenplays are more like poetry than
fiction. ``(They) rely on imagery to carry the narrative, rather
than the other way around. And screenplays have form. Like sonnets,
actually. Just as there are expectations of form, meter and rhyme
in a sonnet, there are the same kinds of expectations of
screenplays.'' We wonder if James Cameron ever thought of that. &QL;

URBAN ELEMENTS GIVE PORTLAND LOOK OF A GENUINE CITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD NILSEN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   What makes a city urban?
</P>
<P>
   We who live in the Western half of the country have to wonder
sometimes. For Phoenix, like Los Angeles _ and most
trans-Mississippi cities _ is fundamentally different from the core
cities of the East. Our cities are sprawling suburbs, spread like a
great tablecloth over the landscape.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't that they don't have character. LA has enough character
for a dozen smaller cities. And even Phoenix has its personality,
although it is that of a raw, unformed, undisciplined adolescent.
</P>
<P>
   But for anyone who grew up near New York, Philadelphia or
Boston, there is something urgently missing out here that prevents
the West from becoming authentically urban.
</P>
<P>
   Purists may argue that any concentration of population must be
considered urban. And they are technically correct. But walk the
Loop in Chicago or by the row houses of Baltimore and you instantly
sense the difference.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that there are small bits of citiness in the West _ a
neighborhood in Denver, a few sections of Seattle or San Francisco.
But these are fragments.
</P>
<P>
   There is one place that has undiluted citiness in concentration.
</P>
<P>
   On the banks of the Willamette River in Oregon is a true city.
Portland has a downtown that could be a relocated Pittsburgh,
bridges and all, and walking through its sinewed city center is a
glory of chattering urban detail, all screaming out that this is a
(itals) real (end itals) city.
</P>
<P>
   For it is the details that define the urban.
</P>
<P>
   Portland is filled with the tiled floors, fireplugs, storm
drains, eroded curbsides, overarching trees, root-buckled sidewalks
and brownstone stoops that make a city feel urban.
</P>
<P>
   It is all the more significant because the Portland downtown is
so tiny. You can walk almost anywhere you need to go.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in those 100 miniature city blocks _ less than a square mile
_ you can discover all the urban detail, ornament and design that
you need to serve as a madeleine to your Proustian nostalgia for a
citiness.
</P>
<P>
   Along the sidewalk, a checkerboard of frosted glass squares
underfoot illuminates an old basement.
</P>
<P>
   A brass fire-hose connection splits like a Brancusi torso.
</P>
<P>
   A dull iron streetcar track in the cobblestones is wheel-shined.
</P>
<P>
   An Art Deco 317 glows above the glass doors of the Loyalty
Building.
</P>
<P>
   The city is built of hard, durable metals and stone, yet all its
edges are softened and weathered.
</P>
<P>
   There is the steep ramp of the old brick parking garage.
</P>
<P>
   The spear points topping the black iron fences.
</P>
<P>
   The revolving clock-thermometer at the corner of the bank
building.
</P>
<P>
   The equestrian statue in the middle of the park, with its
benches and chess players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joy The Tailor'' is written in mosaic on the sidewalk in front
of an empty storefront. Who knows how many businesses have operated
in that building since Joy left?
</P>
<P>
   There is the neon ``pizza'' sign in the window, a neon ``Western
Union'' and a neon ``color copies.''
</P>
<P>
   In front of a blockwide pit being dug out by the steam shovel,
men on their lunch hours gather in a crowd behind a fence to stand
and stare. One of them is eating a Fig Newton.
</P>
<P>
   The one thing all those details speak of is age. The rounded
edges of the curbs, the worn writing on the manhole covers _ these
things come with maturity.
</P>
<P>
   The younger cities of the West _ or the cities such as LA that
seek eternal adolescence _ cannot achieve the respectable age of
the Eastern cities. It is a miracle that Portland survives.
</P>
<P>
   For in LA, as in Phoenix, any building older than our
high-school years tends to be flattened and replaced with one of
those brittle, obdurate, unweathered and machine-edged monoliths,
too juvenile to know better, too inexperienced to have the wisdom
time brings to sandstone and concrete.
</P>
<P>
   In a real city, you see the scoops of accumulated footfalls on
the marble museum steps, you see ailanthus trees growing in the
unattended spaces between buildings and moss on the gutters.
</P>
<P>
   A real city is a stage set for our lives. We eat at the lunch
counters, recline in the grassy parks, live when we are young or
very old in the plastered apartments above the storefronts, drink
grappa at night in the jazz bars.
</P>
<P>
   The urban city is a setting not only physically but also
historically. Its worn details, visible at every turn, remind us
that we live in history, too. The city was there before us and will
be after us.
</P>
<P>
   In a city of strident newness, like Phoenix, we can forget the
big picture and think we are all that matters. In a city full of
its own past, you are always reminded of your grandparents and
grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   And it is all in the details. &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Someone who hates washing dishes must have conceived
the idea for the immersion blender. Bringing the blender to the pot
rather than transferring the pot's contents into the blender saves
a lot of dishes.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder immersion blenders have been a hit with home cooks
over the last 10 years _ once we discovered that pumpkin soup could
be thinned to a silky puree right in the pot there was no going
back.
</P>
<P>
   The immersion blender has actually been used in professional
kitchens since the 1960s. When it is immersed partway into the
liquid, the action of the blade draws in the contents of the pot,
creating a sort of whirlpool as the food is smoothly blended.
</P>
<P>
   The immersion blender can also be used to make thicker vegetable
purees, milk shakes, and to emulsify sauces.
</P>
<P>
   It does not perform all the functions that a blender or food
processor can _ like grating and slicing _ and it does not aerate
drinks and shakes as well as a blender, but the immersion blender,
or hand blender, can be a very useful tool.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last year, manufacturers have greatly improved the
power and convenience of their home models. Cuisinart recently
introduced two designs, the Cordless Rechargeable Hand Blender
(CSB-44) and the SmartStick Extendable Shaft Hand Blender (CSB-55).
Braun also came out with a new model, the Multiquick Handblender
with Chopper and Whisk (MR430HC).
</P>
<P>
   I tested them against Cuisinart's tried-and-true model, the
Quick Prep Hand Blender (CSB-33). When put to action on a
watercress soup, a banana cardamom milk shake and whipped cream,
the differences among the four blenders were astonishing.
</P>
<P>
   The Quick Prep blender, the five-year-old senior in the group,
performed well on all three. The 135-watt blender, with high and
low speeds, was not the highest charged, but it worked consistently
and evenly, pureeing the soup and whipping up a fine milk shake.
</P>
<P>
   But the blade shaft does not detach from the handle, which makes
it difficult to clean, and it doesn't look nearly as sleek and
modern as the newer models. It is $45.99 at Vinegar Factory, 431
East 91st Street (York Avenue), (212) 987-0885.
</P>
<P>
   The Braun blender, the slimmest and lightest of the four, is 200
watts. Though it is equipped with a hand blender's typically small
blade, this blender is like the Tasmanian Devil. In the watercress
soup, it created an instant whirlpool.
</P>
<P>
   But because the top is light and the action is concentrated at
the blade end of the blender, it is difficult to control and tips
easily in the hand _ as I learned the hard way. I had watercress
soup all over my kitchen walls. In the milk shake, it plowed
through the bananas like a lawn mower.
</P>
<P>
   The blender shaft is detachable and is interchangeable with a
whisk attachment and a mini-chopper. The whisk whipped cream well _
and quickly _ but the chopper reduced a cup of walnuts to mere
crumbs in about three seconds. It would be difficult to get an even
rough chop. It is $34.99 at Bed Bath &AMP; Beyond, 620 Sixth Avenue
(19th Street), (212) 255-3550.
</P>
<P>
   With no cords to deal with and a detachable blade shaft, the
Cuisinart cordless hand blender is the best of the lot in terms of
pure convenience. But the nonslip handle, which has been redesigned
with the on/off button at the top of the handle like a joystick,
was actually not very comfortable _ in my hand, at least. I found
it thick and heavy, like a tennis racket grip that was too large.
</P>
<P>
   Working with its single speed, it pureed the soup efficiently
and made a smooth shake. It comes with a plastic disk attachment
for whipping cream and blending batter, which works fairly well.
But it whips so quickly that the cream can easily turn to butter.
Its list price is $82.
</P>
<P>
   Cuisinart's SmartStick was, by far, the best all around. It has
four speeds, a detachable shaft and comes with a chopper and a disk
for whipping cream. I am usually skeptical of equipment designed to
do so many tasks. But this one performed well on all levels.
</P>
<P>
   It pureed the soup and sliced through the bananas in the shake
with no effort. And with the slow speed option, it whipped cream
properly.
</P>
<P>
   The chopper, a fat, round container designed like a food
processor, worked like a dream, cutting through the walnuts evenly.
Its cord extends away from you, which makes it easier to keep the
cord out of the pot. You will probably never use the extendable
shaft, unless you are making soup for an army. The SmartStick's
list price is $90. &QL;

MAXIMALIST CHICKEN SALAD 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MARK BITTMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Standard chicken salad _ poached chicken, mayonnaise and celery
_ is about as minimalist as it gets. But so is the flavor.
</P>
<P>
   I'd rather make a chicken salad that has only one thing _
chicken _ in common with the familiar variety. My favorite contains
grilled chicken and a super-flavorful dressing based on soy sauce,
peanut or sesame butter, spices and cucumber for crunch. If you
combine the chicken and sauce while the chicken is hot, the flavors
marry perfectly, and their clarity remains even after the chicken
has been chilled. I like to make extra dressing and serve the
chicken on top of a bed of salad greens.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If possible, use boneless chicken thighs rather than breasts;
their flavor and texture is superior, and they remain moist during
grilling and brown perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   I prefer only a slight hint of heat in the dressing, and
therefore limit the hot sauce to a few drops, but you can add as
much as you like. Garlic, vinegar and sesame oil can also be added
to taste. Unless you must omit it for health reasons, you should
really include the sugar, which even in this minuscule quantity
adds a certain roundness that is otherwise lacking.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The combination of chicken and cucumber is near-perfect, but
bell pepper, celery or zucchini are all good additions. The
simplest, most effective garnish is minced cilantro, but basil
(especially Thai basil), mint or a combination of these herbs is
also great, as are some minced scallions.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ASIAN CHICKEN SALAD &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Time: 30 minutes (or longer if you want to serve it cold) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   1{ pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs or breasts
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons soy sauce
</P>
<P>
   1{ tablespoons peanut butter or tahini (ground sesame paste)
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon Asian sesame oil
</P>
<P>
   1 small clove garlic, peeled
</P>
<P>
   A few drops of hot sauce, like Tabasco
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   \ teaspoon sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon rice or other vinegar
</P>
<P>
   1 cucumber
</P>
<P>
   \ cup minced cilantro leaves.
</P>
<P>
   1. Start a charcoal or gas grill, or preheat the broiler. Cut
the chicken meat into {- to 1-inch chunks, and thread it onto
skewers. Put the skewers on a plate, and drizzle with 2 tablespoons
of the soy sauce.
</P>
<P>
   2. In a blender, combine the remaining soy sauce with the peanut
butter, sesame oil, garlic, hot sauce, salt, pepper, sugar and
vinegar. Turn the blender on, and add hot water, a teaspoon at a
time, until the mixture is smooth and creamy. (You will not need
more than 3 teaspoons of water.)
</P>
<P>
   3. Grill or broil the chicken, turning once or twice. Total
cooking time will be 6 to 8 minutes for breasts, 10 to 12 minutes
for thighs. Meanwhile, peel the cucumber (if it is waxed), slice it
in half the long way, and scoop out the seeds with a spoon. Cut it
into {-inch dice, and combine in a bowl with the sauce. When the
chicken is done, toss it with the sauce and cucumber. Taste, and
adjust seasoning if necessary; then, serve hot or cold, garnished
with the cilantro.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.

OH, FOR JUST PLAIN GIN AND DRY VERMOUTH  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM GRIMES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   First it was cool. Then it got hot. Now it's bloated and out of
control.
</P>
<P>
   The martini, sleekest and suavest of cocktails, has entered the
late-Elvis phase of its once-splendid career, staggering under the
weight of weird garnishes, dazed and disoriented by years of
experimenting with chemicals like Jaegermeister, Chambord and
Kahlua. It's time to enter rehab.
</P>
<P>
   From sea to shining sea, the bars of the United States are
groaning under the weight of horrible martinis. A modern Dante, if
so inclined, could tour the many circles of this cocktail hell and
come up with a truly compelling mixed-drink Inferno.
</P>
<P>
   Moving west to east, the tour might start with the Sea Watch
martini at Lola's in Los Angeles, a beguiling blend of vodka
infused with lime leaves and garnished with edible flowers. It's
worth a quick trip north to Seattle, where Oliver's, the bar in the
Mayflower Park Hotel, offers the Fortunella martini, a blend of
gin, vodka, limoncello and kumquat nectar.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, the pilgrim traveling this  &UR; via dolorosa &LR;  will find
the Martini Ranch, a Dallas establishment, whose manager says:
``The sky's the limit. If it's in a martini glass, it's a
martini.'' He ain't a-kiddin, either. One of the bar's standout
cocktails is the Mars Bar martini, a syrupy swirl of dark chocolate
liqueur, white chocolate liqueur, amaretto and Frangelico, served
in a glass whose rim has been dusted in chocolate flecks from
frozen Hershey bars that have been run through a blender.
</P>
<P>
   Farther east, in Atlanta, the Martini Club offers each customer
a hellish document: a martini menu that runs to 50 items. These
include a Garden Martini with a garnish of pickled asparagus spear
and a spicy green bean. The bar plans to expand the list to 100
martinis this week.
</P>
<P>
   Following the martini trail north, what do we find? In New York,
capital of glamour and sophistication, it is now possible to raise
a martini glass, hold it to the light and find oneself gazing at an
oyster. ``As you start to drink, the oyster gradually releases its
brine,'' says Jeff Shaffer, the owner of Shaffer City Oyster Bar
and Grill, home of the oyster martini. ``It's like stepping farther
and farther out into the ocean. And in the end, you get to eat the
oyster.''
</P>
<P>
   In a court of law, this plea is known as ``guilty, with an
explanation.'' It's a rather appealing explanation, with a touch of
poetry to it. But in the end, the case comes down to one cold,
squishy fact _ that martini has an oyster in it.
</P>
<P>
   A restaurant trade magazine recently devoted an issue to jazzy
new variations on classic cocktails. The section on martinis
carried the headline ``Improving on Perfection.'' It's a damning
phrase.
</P>
<P>
   For more than century, the martini has held sway in the world of
cocktails by virtue of its purity and simplicity. It has but two
ingredients, gin and vermouth. It can tolerate only one of two
garnishes, an olive or a twist of lemon. The only major alteration
in this formula, the substitution of flavorless vodka for vermouth,
made the drink even simpler.
</P>
<P>
   It was too good to last. As the martini gained a new following
in the last decade, the name became a powerful signifier. The
martini was Frank, Sammy and Dean. It was unfiltered cigarettes,
Vegas and curvy babes. In a messy, confusing world, it stood for
clarity. In a time of collapsing values, it maintained strict
standards.
</P>
<P>
   Pretty soon, everyone wanted a piece of the action. Bars began
serving brightly colored drinks and calling them martinis. Liquor
companies, keen to promote their liqueurs, began inventing garish
recipes and calling them martinis. The self-infatuated lounge
culture worked overtime to develop attitudinal martinis _ drinks
that require extensive annotation to be understood.
</P>
<P>
   A prime specimen of the genre is the ultra-ironic Brazen
Martini, found in ``Atomic Cocktails: Mixed Drinks for Modern
Times'' (Chronicle Books, 1998). The drink, a vodka martini made
with Parfait Amour (a violet liqueur) and garnished with a long
spiral of orange peel, comes with its own user's manual: ``It's one
of those sex-goddess drinks, the kind of martini that calls for a
lipstick print on the glass, a pair of hot pink maribou slippers
and the sound of `Mondo Mambo' pulsing in the background.''
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to imagine, but once there was a time when real people
simply approached the bar and ordered a dry martini. There were no
set designers, no sound engineers and credits did not roll at the
end of the drink.
</P>
<P>
   The martini in its decadent phase has appalled its most fervent
devotees. Barnaby Conrad 2d, the author of ``The Martini,'' has
often been called on to judge martini contests. It's not always a
pretty sight. ``In one, I remember, a pickled shrimp found its way
into the glass,'' he said. ``It was sort of an Asian angle. Another
one had a candied violet.''
</P>
<P>
   It was cruel but necessary to inform Conrad that the
pickled-shrimp martini, by current standards, was chaste. Until it
changed ownership recently, Fred's Beauty, in Manhattan, sported a
hallucinogenic martini menu that included something called the
Snowman: Finlandia vodka, white chocolate liqueur and a garnish of
three miniature marshmallows. ``That's not just bending the
rules,'' Conrad said. ``That's destroying the whole game.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Donohoe, the self-elected president for life of the
American Standard Dry Martini Club, has calibrated the martini's
downward slide for a decade. ``Everybody's having fun with this
stuff, but real martini drinkers are suffering,'' he said, speaking
on the telephone from club headquarters in Athens, Ohio. ``When you
say you're a martini drinker, that's supposed to mean something,
but all this silliness has degraded the whole concept of the
drink.'' Donohoe has proposed a march on Washington, but serious
martini drinkers are notoriously difficult to organize.
</P>
<P>
   Donohoe and his allies have already lost the gin battle. Most
people drink vodka martinis. And even the most
strict-constructionist martini drinker has to concede that some of
the rococo martinis are rather clever, like the Pixie Stick
martini, a combination of pineapple vodka, sour cherry syrup, fresh
lime and lemon juice. The drink, created at Candy Bar in New York,
is not the kind of cocktail you find in a Raymond Chandler novel,
but it has a certain offbeat appeal. The Lolita, a new addition to
the menu at Grange Hall, calls for 12-year-old Scotch and
hazlenut-flavored sherry, a sly allusion to the real name of
Nabokov's heroine, Dolores Haze. The drink, topped with a mildly
salacious garnish, wins a point or two for inventiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Let no one think for a minute, however, that playing with the
rules does not have consequences. At Liquid Kitty, a bar in West
Hollywood, the signature drink is a vodka martini served with an
unfiltered Camel on the side. ``People put them in the drink by
mistake,'' said Dave Childs, an owner of the bar. ``One guy was
really angry. He returned the drink and said, `This martini is no
good.'''
</P>
<P>
   These days, how would he know?

SAN FRANCISCO SAYS NO NEW MASSAGE PARLORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARIANNE COOSTANTINOU and GREGORY LEWIS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ From the outside, it sure looks like a brothel _
at least Hollywood's version of one from the Wild West or, if the
awning is to be believed, Gay Paree.
</P>
<P>
   Venus de Milo and her girlfriend, a bathing beauty, are in a
window, a crimson curtain the backdrop for their white alabaster
figures. A gilt rococo lamp with a bosomy prancing belle is the
star attraction of the other window, also festooned with a red
curtain.
</P>
<P>
   Red is the color of the door and the awning and the outdoor
carpet. And in a reminder of the red-light district of yore, red
light bulbs line the perimeter of the windows, beckoning the
passerby.
</P>
<P>
   The sign at this establishment in San Francisco's Tenderloin
district announces that it is Les Nuits de Paris Massage and Sauna.
It is one of 22 massage parlors in the neighborhood. To some
residents, 22 is plenty.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the city's Board of Supervisors agreed, voting
unanimously to place a moratorium on any future parlors in the
Tenderloin district, and to restrict existing ones when there is a
change in ownership. The board will review the bill next week for
final passage.
</P>
<P>
   City planning officials, as well as members of the board's
Housing and Neighborhood Services Committee, say their next focus
will be on limiting parlors in the Mission District and
Bayview-Hunters Point, which they anticipate will get an influx of
new massage parlors once the Tenderloin ban takes effect.
</P>
<P>
   In this city of most anything goes, massage parlors have long
been viewed as magnets of sleaze. The foes contend that some
parlors are fronts for prostitution, drugs and other illegal
activity.
</P>
<P>
   Sandwiched between the Civic Center area with its government and
cultural institutions, and the affluence of Nob Hill, Union Square
and the theater district, the Tenderloin neighborhood is struggling
to gain respectability and livability.
</P>
<P>
   The neighborhood is home to a large Asian population and a
growing number of Hispanics, most of them immigrants, about 5,000
of them children.
</P>
<P>
   Supervisor Leland Yee, who presented Monday's ordinance, said he
began work on it about a year ago after meeting with Tenderloin
neighbors who viewed the parlors as unsavory.
</P>
<P>
   Supervisor Amos Brown, a Baptist minister, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over-proliferation of massage parlors and too much massaging
will cause us to be socially and morally flabby,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Yee added that his ordinance was also aimed at bringing some
economic variety to the neighborhood, which has the highest
concentration of massage parlors in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want a diversity of businesses,'' Yee said. ``By putting a
cap on massage parlors, then other businesses can come in.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to banning new parlors, the ordinance would launch a
series of ``good-neighbor'' requirements that would kick in once a
parlor changes ownership, Those requirements include limiting hours
of operation to 7 a.m. to midnight, banning alcohol and prohibiting
sidewalk barkers from soliciting passersby.

<P>
   DEER ISLE, Maine _ The sun was just easing over the horizon when
Matthew Eaton hopped into his skiff and set off into the glassy
waters of Eggemogginn Reach. A short distance from the shore, he
reached his destination: a wooden platform where he had suspended
two traps the night before. Each held a small catch of frisky,
reddish crabs.
</P>
<P>
   It is the height of the lobster season, when most Maine
lobstermen let the little crabs go, instead of collecting them as
Eaton does. With so many lobsters, worth so much more money, most
lobstermen don't want to bother with crabs. But Eaton is no fool;
he knows his customer.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the world of the peekytoe crab, where one man's trash
is another man's treasure. This little crab is so beloved at
Restaurant Daniel, Jean Georges, the French Laundry, Spago and
other equally famous eating establishments that the chefs pay $12
to $14 a pound for something that has long been routinely
discarded.
</P>
<P>
   In just a few years the peekytoe, which weighs less than a
pound, has been transformed from a throwaway byproduct of lobster
fishing to a star in the culinary firmament.
</P>
<P>
   The crabs can be found all along the East Coast but are
especially abundant Down East, the waters off Maine, from Rockland
to Eastport. . Maine residents pinpoint Down East, particularly the
Penobscot Bay, as the source of their finest seafood.
</P>
<P>
   But until Rod Mitchell, the owner of the Browne Trading Co., a
seafood wholesaler in Portland, started calling one species of
Maine crab by its local slang name, no one knew or much cared which
kind of Maine crab they ate. Even Mitchell's competitors agree that
it was a brilliant marketing move to convince a handful of
influential chefs that a crab variously known as sand crab, mud
crab and rock crab, was really a peekytoe crab and more desirable
than any of the better known crabs from elsewhere like Chesapeake
blue, dungeness and Alaskan king.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started calling it that I never thought it would become
so much of a marketing tool,'' Mitchell said. ``Daniel is the one
who did it in New York,'' he added, a reference to Daniel Boulud,
the chef of Restaurant Daniel.
</P>
<P>
   Until last year, Ingrid Bengis, whose small but select seafood
company is located in Stonington at the southern tip of Deer Isle
in the Penobscot Bay, called peekytoe crab ``Maine crab meat.''
</P>
<P>
   One of her customers, Jean-Georges Vongerichten, had been using
it since 1985 but only knew it as Maine crab. Ms. Bengis became
aware of the term about a year ago. ``Chefs started saying to me,
`Is it peekytoe?''' she said. ``I never cared about branding but
now I realize other people care about those things and they are
important.''
</P>
<P>
   Today crab cognoscente like Vongerichten and Eberhard Mulle of
Lutece wax rhapsodic about it: ``Exceptional,'' ``incredible,''
``so sweet, so fresh.''
</P>
<P>
   Its delicate sweetness seems best suited to simple preparations.
Vongerichten uses it in his four New York restaurants, including in
a signature salad at Jo-Jo that is made with zucchini, tomato and
basil oil. At Le Bernardin, Eric Ripert makes a napoleon with
peekytoe salad between feathery rice-flour pastries. At Judson
Grill, the crab is used in a salad dressed with lemon verbena
vinaigrette.
</P>
<P>
   In Maine, things are even simpler: peekytoe crab is mixed with
mayonnaise and stuffed into a toasted, buttered hot dog bun, much
like a lobster roll.
</P>
<P>
   What really makes peekytoe crabs better than other crabs is the
care with which they are handled, cooked and picked _ essential
work, because the crabs are too fragile to be shipped live.
</P>
<P>
   In Maine, this is still a cottage industry and the best job is
done by lobstermen's wives. Until recently, the wives prepared the
crabs in their home kitchens. But since the new federal food safety
laws went into effect, the crabs are now prepared in structures
built next to lobstermen's homes.
</P>
<P>
   Chefs have their favorite pickers. Thomas Keller at the French
Laundry in the Napa Valley, Vongerichten and Muller are among those
who insist on the crab meat from Ms. Bengis, who collects from
several pickers on Deer Isle.
</P>
<P>
   Ripert and Boulud want only Linda Harford's crab meat, which is
sold under the name Mac's through Browne Trading. Her crab also
comes from the Penobscot Bay. The good pickers are in such demand
that Ms. Harford says that two years ago she was offered $5,000 by
a distributor to pick exclusively for his company. ``This business
has become so cutthroat,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of others who distribute peekytoe crab meat,
but their product does not have the same cachet. That's partly
because not all of them are so scrupulous about freshness, keeping
peekytoe separate from other kinds of crab and being vigilant about
pesky bits of shell that fall into the meat.
</P>
<P>
   Keller is so partial to crab prepared by Linda Gray, who picks
for Ms. Bengis, that he has asked her to sign each of the
containers she does for him.
</P>
<P>
   Not many of the pickers can hear the sound of a fleck of crab
shell when it lands in the bowl of crab meat. But Ms. Gray, who
picks for Ms. Bengis, almost never misses and it makes her
daughter, Tiffany Eaton, crazy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tiffany gets so mad at me because every once in awhile I yell,
`There's a shell,' '' Ms. Gray said, as she and her daughter picked
away on a Monday morning earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are different levels of crab meat because there are
different levels of pickers,'' Ms. Bengis said. ``It depends on how
well you drain your crab meat; how dry it is. If it's too moist it
spoils quickly. If it's too dry it loses its flavor. And freshness.
Restaurants will have what Tina picked today by tomorrow at 3
o'clock.''
</P>
<P>
   Every picker has a slightly different routine for processing the
crabs. Ms. Gray's are kept in the water until minutes before
cooking. As soon as Eaton brings the crabs he has stored at his
platform ashore he drives them to the home he shares with Ms. Gray
and their children, about five minutes away.
</P>
<P>
   The morning I accompanied him, he did not have many. As he
transferred them from the storage crates to baskets, he said he was
in trouble. ``There aren't very many and I'm gonna get chewed
out,'' he said. Ms. Gray has to have at least 12 crates a week to
fill her orders.
</P>
<P>
   The crabs went directly from the truck into the kettle. After
cooking, they were rinsed in circulating water to separate the crab
shell from the meat, Ms. Gray explained. ``If I didn't dip them in
cold water, the meat wouldn't come off,'' she said. ``Anyway,
that's my theory.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gray refers to the peekytoes as sand crabs but says the
local slang for them is not peekytoe but ``picked toe'' _ pick-ed
pronounced as if it had two syllables _ because the crab leg has a
very sharp point that turns inward ``Picked is Maine for pointed,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte Weed, another picker from Stonington, says her husband
calls them picket toe, but she added: ``Our accent might be a
problem. For all I care they can call them peeky boos as long as
they sell.'' (They practically do: Le Bernardin's menu calls them
``picky toe.'')
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gray and her daughter can pick between 20 and 25 pounds of
crab meat a day. ``The most I ever picked alone was 27 pounds, but
that will pretty much kill you,'' Ms. Gray said. In 1994, she was
crowned Queen Crabpicker at the annual Deer Isle fisherman's ball.
</P>
<P>
   Her problem in the summer, like that of Linda Harford, who lives
down the coast in Owls Head near Rockland, is not too many crabs,
but too few. Lobstermen can earn as much as $3,000 a day catching
lobsters at the height of the season, and they don't want to bother
with crabs that bring their wives around $200 a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fishermen tell their wives they aren't catching any,''
Eaton said as he drank his first cup of coffee at 4:30 a.m., before
he went to pick up the crabs. But what the fishermen have actually
done is let the crabs escape from their lobster traps by removing a
plug that is large enough to let the crabs go.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other lobstermen, Eaton has 12 separate traps for the
crabs because Ms. Gray picks in the summer, too. ``For two months
husbands make good money and the wives take the kids to the
beach,'' Eaton said. But not Ms. Gray.
</P>
<P>
   The future of this cottage industry is uncertain since the
federal government implemented its rules to improve the sanitary
conditions under which the crabs are processed. ``A lot of people
are going out of business because of the new rules, which say you
have to have a special building to cook and pick the crabs and have
to take classes,'' said Ms. Gray, who took the classes to learn the
new regulations called the Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those regulations are just common sense,'' she said. ``I built
my picking house because we just built a double-wide trailer and I
didn't want the picking in my house.''
</P>
<P>
   Like other pickers, Ms. Gray suspects ``the goverment is trying
to get home pickers out of business.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They would like to have a big company do it,'' she said.
``They wouldn't have to inspect so many people. But a big company
doesn't have a very good quality. They don't care as much as an
individual person.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gray's point was quickly proven in a sampling of
commercially distributed Maine crab along with the crab she and Ms.
Harford pick. Neither of theirs had shells. The two containers of
commercial Maine crab had at least 10 pieces of shell in each.
</P>
<P>
   One commercial container was peekytoe; the other held assorted
Maine crab, some combination of rock, Jonah and red. The contents
of that container certainly did not have the sweetness or delicacy
of peekytoe.
</P>
<P>
   Just as no one can agree on the best season for peekytoes and
whether they are sweeter before or after they molt in the spring,
there is no agreement on the real name for them.
</P>
<P>
   Ask two locals and you get two answers: sand crab or rock crab.
On only two things do they agree: a peekytoe is not a Jonah crab.
And you catch peekytoes in waters 20- to 40-feet deep, in traps
baited with bits of fish. Those who call it a sand crab say the
rock crabs are not anywhere near as delicate or sweet. Others say
the rock and the sand crab are the same.
</P>
<P>
   It took five phone calls to find a marine biologist who had even
heard the term peekytoe, one who could positively _ more or less _
identify it. Bob Baer, the director of the Lobster Institute and a
professor in the University of Maine's School of Marine Sciences,
came to the rescue.

 DEER ISLE: the rescue.

   ``Oh that's a bay crab,'' he said, ``cancer irroratus. It's a
bycatch of fishing for lobster. I've always wondered about these
crabs because they have so many different names. I suspect sand
crab and rock crab are the same thing.'' And the Latin name for
rock crab is cancer irroratus.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what it is, you and I cannot go to a fish market and
buy a container of peekytoe crab under that name. You can buy Maine
crab, but it could be red or Jonah as easily as peekytoe, or a
combination of all three.
</P>
<P>
   The alternative is a trip to a top restaurant, where you will
find it by name on the menu, or a trip to Maine. Along the coast,
look for signs that say ``crab meat'' posted on mailboxes. You may
have found the home of one of the many women who pick crabs for
America's fussiest chefs. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The only way to buy peekytoe crab, outside of a restaurant, is
from one of the many crab pickers along the Maine coast,
particularly in the area of the Penobscot Bay and Deer Isle. Look
for signs offering ``crab meat'' posted in front of houses here and
there (these small home businesses do not want their addresses
published, and do not do mail order).
</P>
<P>
   Since there is more peekytoe crab available after August, there
might be more signs in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   But whether the crab meat is peekytoe or some other kind, only
the picker knows for sure. The differences are subtle. Peekytoe
crab is more delicate and sweeter than other Maine crab.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the claws, there is no lump meat such as what you
will find in a Jonah crab. The meat is white with tinges of pink _
pickers say peekytoe is pinker than Jonah, although it seems to
vary. Like any other variety, peekytoe should smell sweet and
fresh.
</P>
<P>
   The following recipes will work well with other kinds of crab
meat _ Maine crab, stone crab or Dungeness crab in particular _ as
long as it is fresh and not pasteurized. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>

AMERICANS CAN'T SEEM TO GET ENOUGH CRAB 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By FLORENCE FABRICANT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the volatile stock market makes you dizzy, just be glad
you're not a crabber. Though America's coastline and offshore
waters boast more varieties of edible crabs than any other part of
the world, from year to year supplies plummet, then soar, then
plummet and soar again, for reasons known only to nature.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there never seems to be enough crab to meet the demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crab is THE American shellfish,'' said Clark Wolf, the
restaurant consultant. ``It has sweetness and richness. Chefs love
working with it because it's so versatile and easy.''
</P>
<P>
   And diners love crab meat so much that they are abandoning
regional loyalties and want crab cakes, soft-shell crabs and
Dungeness crabs wherever they go. Menu surveys by the National
Restaurant Association found shellfish on 91 percent of American
menus in 1997, with lobster, crab cakes and soft-shell crabs the
top three sellers.
</P>
<P>
   Partly to satisfy this seemingly insatiable hunger for crab in
any and all forms in a range of prices, fish markets and
restaurants are offering more varieties of crab than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike shrimp, crabs are not farmed, so the size of a catch
cannot be controlled or predicted. In this decade, the harvest of
blue crabs, which inhabit the entire Eastern Seaboard and account
for more than half the crabs and crabmeat eaten in this country,
has fluctuated by as much as 25 percent from one year to the next.
(Pfiesteria piscicida, the microbe that killed fish last year in
Cheasapeake Bay, does not seem to have any connection. ``It doesn't
affect crabs,'' said Noreen Eberly, the seafood marketing
specialist of the Maryland Department of Agriculture.)
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, after a long period of abundance, the
Dungeness harvest from the Pacific Northwest was down to about 40
million pounds in the 1996-97 season, compared with 72 million
pounds the year before. And in Alaskan waters, after years of
steady decline, snow crabs made a stunning comeback in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so much snow crab all of a sudden that you'll find it
sold in poly bags in Winn-Dixie supermarkets in the Southeastern
states,'' said Laura Fleming, a spokeswoman for the Alaska Seafood
Marketing Institute, a trade group.
</P>
<P>
   Wait a minute. What are bags of frozen snow crab legs doing in
places like Florida, the state that's known for stone crabs?
Probably the same thing that a salad of Jonah crab, a specialty of
Maine, is doing on the menu at the Water Grill in Los Angeles, or
why Maryland soft-shell crabs are served at Charles Nob Hill in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Crabs, which nature has limited to regional markets for
centuries, have gone national. And with all this choice of flavor
and texture, chefs and consumers are playing favorites _ hence the
rage for peekytoe crabs in top restaurant kitchens.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, for example, there were Dungeness crabs for sale at
the Seafood Shop in Wainscott, N.Y., on Long Island's East End,
where local crabbers bring in blue crabs by the bushel. ``Some
people ask for them, so I get them,'' said John Haessler, the owner
of the shop.
</P>
<P>
   Sol Amon, the owner of the Pure Fish Market in Seattle, which
sells wholesale and retail, said that for the last two years, the
demand for Dungeness crabs has exceeded the supply. ``The East
Coast has found out about how great they are,'' he said. His
company ships them all over the country.
</P>
<P>
   Overnight shipping and more sophisticated freezing techniques
have helped spread crab varieties around.
</P>
<P>
   In Crisfield, Md., on Chesapeake Bay, John T. Handy Co., the
country's largest producer of soft-shell crabs, has seen the
appetite for those fragile molted crabs, once strictly a regional
specialty, turn ravenous. And instead of being limited to a season
in the Chesapeake area from May to August, soft-shell crabs from
Florida and Louisiana now get things going in March.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone in this part of the country knew what soft shells
were, but now they're becoming popular everywhere,'' said Handy
president Carol Haltaman. ``One of our biggest markets is
California, and we also sell a lot in Chicago. It's like crab
cakes. I'm always amazed at where I'm seeing crab cakes in
restaurants lately.'' Though crab cakes are usually made from blue
crabs (which is why they were a Maryland specialty), Ms. Haltaman
said she had even seen them made from Dungeness crabs in Washington
state.
</P>
<P>
   One advantage to crab cakes is that they can satisfy the taste
for crab for a lot less money. The vast shifts in the numbers of
crabs scooped up from the deep or gathered inshore result in
constantly fluctuating prices. Right now, soft shells are
expensive, but snow crab is cheap.
</P>
<P>
   ``When lump crab meat gets to be $28 a pound, wholesale chefs
look for other crabs to serve,'' Wolf, the restaurant consultant,
said.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, because of the demand (and the prices paid),
fishermen are no longer throwing back some kinds of crabs like
deep-water Jonahs, which had been merely byproducts of lobstering.
In lower Manhattan's Chinatown, live Jonah crabs stroll in tanks
that once held similar but more costly Dungeness crabs. So in
Cantonese restaurants, Jonah, not Dungeness, crabs now arrive at
the table chopped into big hunks, glistening and bright red.
Picking and sucking the sweet white meat of the claws, legs and
back fin glazed with the saline richness of black bean sauce, you
hardly know the difference.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, about 15 years ago, when there was a drastic shortage
of the meatier Alaska king crabs, snow crabs gained a following.
Then, from 1994 to 1996 there were similar reverses for snow crabs,
which, for the moment, have rebounded.
</P>
<P>
   Are there new crabs sidling onto the plate? In Maine, spider
crabs, which are very popular in Europe, have long been caught with
lobsters in winter. Rod Mitchell, the owner of Browne Trading, a
seafood dealer in Portland, Maine, has started selling them to
chefs. ``Some chefs know what to do with them and want them,'' he
said. ``They're small and spiny, but they have great flavor.
Everyone wants crab constantly, and these are something different.
And they're only $3 a pound.''
</P>
<P>
   A new flavorful cheap crab? There'll be plenty of takers.

<P>
   Summer is the season for wheat beers. Their tartness
distinguishes them: With their lemony tang, they quench the thirst
and rest light on the tongue. At their best, they are fruity with
just a hint of clove spiciness in the aroma. At their
less-than-best, they are so light that their flavor disappears.
</P>
<P>
   We sampled 11 wheat beers, both American and European _ but only
three stood out.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the wheat beer ``is the entry-level
serious beer, the training wheel beer,'' said Bill Owens, publisher
of Beer, the Magazine, in Hayward, Calif. Not surprisingly, their
numbers have more than doubled in the last five years in this era
of microbreweries and brewpubs. Which doesn't mean they are all
successes.
</P>
<P>
   Labels can say wheat (or in German, Weizen) or white (in German,
weiss). By any name, it means a beer made with 40 percent to 60
percent barley, and a lesser percent wheat, Owens said. (Why wheat
beers are called white, however, is curious. One explanation is
that when it ferments, it produces a very pale foam, says the
beer-taster's bible, ``Michael Jackson's Beer Companion'' (Running

   Celis White lives up to its label, which promises an authentic
Belgian-style wheat beer brewed with herbs and spices. Belgians
have been brewing wheat beer for 500 years, sometimes spicing it
with orange peel and coriander. In 1991, when brewer Pierre Celis
moved from Hoegaarden, Belgium, to Austin, Texas, he brought with
him a recipe from 1453. He opened Celis Brewery the next year.
</P>
<P>
   Celis White has a fruity and spicy aroma, a full body, and a
spicy lemony flavor. It is gently, but not overwhelmingly tart, and
a 12-ounce bottle sells for around $1.50.
</P>
<P>
   Paulaner Hefe-Weizen Dunkel from Germany, a light amber in
color, has a yeasty aroma, a round malty body, and just the
faintest lemony aftertaste. Paulaner, which was founded in Munich
by monks in 1634, makes both a Hefe-Weizen, a pale straw color
wheat beer, and the Dunkel, a darker version. And it was the latter
which possessed the most flavor. It sells for $2 for a 16.9-ounce
bottle.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Hacker-Pschorr Weisse, a Munich beer made since the
19th century, has a light, clean _ pristine _ wheat aroma, a
feather-light body, but a nice tart bite throughout. A 12-ounce
bottle is $1.75.

DELIGHTING IN A REMOTE CORNER OF FRANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By FRANK J. PRIAL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PERPIGNAN, France _ The French call this western Mediterranean
corner of their country the last frontier. It is a vast expanse of
arid, inhospitable land in southern France bounded by this city,
the city of Carcassonne and the Spanish border.
</P>
<P>
   In the back country leading up into the Pyrenees and in some
former fishing villages along the coast, the old people still speak
Catalan, which has been described as the language of the Roman foot
soldier.
</P>
<P>
   The language may be as close as we will ever come to the Latin
argot of the Roman Empire, but it isn't the only remnant of those
times: vines were almost certainly planted here by the Phoenicians
and later the Greeks.
</P>
<P>
   But the locals like to think that the first commercial wine
producers were the former Roman soldiers who settled here after the
Gallic wars, some 2,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The major wine areas here are Corbieres and Roussillon, but
where one begins and the other ends has always been something of a
mystery. With one exception, their modern wine history is not
particularly edifying.
</P>
<P>
   In the first half of this century, the region contributed
enthusiastically to the vast ocean of bad wine produced in southern
France, much of it eventually burned off as surplus. The exception
was natural sweet wine.
</P>
<P>
   The Roussillon region still produces some 90 percent of all the
inexpensive sweet wine made in France, and along the country roads
there are stands selling a local selection of Rivesaltes, muscat de
Rivesaltes or Banyuls, a sweet wine made from grenache grapes.
</P>
<P>
   Corbieres and Roussillon have gone through the same changes that
have affected better-known wine regions to the east, like Provence.
Serious winemakers and grape growers, attracted by cheaper land and
assured of some government support, have come south from Bordeaux
and Burgundy to instill new life into these ancient vineyards. The
results have often been spectacular.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Paris restaurateurs, seeking to replace the
unconscionably expensive Bordeaux and Burgundies, have turned to
other wines of the southwest. Some of these, from places like
Cahors, Gaillac, Madiran and Irouleguy, have become familiar names,
thanks in part to their reasonable prices and in part to
enthusiastic promoters like the restaurateurs Alain Senderens and
Alain Dutournier.
</P>
<P>
   I've never shared their enthusiasm. To me, the wines always
seemed hard and tannic and deficient in fruit. And at the risk of
henceforth being seated by the kitchen at some these restaurants,
I'll say that some of the wines from Corbieres- Roussillon are much
better.
</P>
<P>
   At their best, they display richness, fruit and roundness rarely
encountered in many of the wines of the Southwest, and none of the
defects usually associated with hot-climate wines _ too much
alcohol, oxydization, dryness.
</P>
<P>
   At the Terrasse de Soleil, an old Catalan farm house converted
into a country inn in the hills above the village of Ceret, I had a
cabernet sauvignon from the Mas Sauvy, a relatively new estate of
some 200 acres at Villeneuve de la Raho, just a few miles south of
Perpignan.
</P>
<P>
   While merely a vin de pays, this was a delightful cabernet that
had been aged 12 months in oak. It would be welcome anywhere in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   The next day in Ceret _ where Picasso once lived and worked _ I
stopped at Les Feuillants, one of France's least-known restaurants
with two Michelin stars. Marie-Louise Banyols, the owner, presides
over a wine cellar like few others; her collection of the wines of
the Domaine de la Romanee Conti would make the owner of any
Burgundian three-star restaurant speechless with envy.
</P>
<P>
   She also has a fascinating collection of local wines. Her
assistant sommelier, Christine Cannac, chose a 1993 blend of
mourvedre and syrah from the Domaine du Mas Blanc that had the
richness and elegance of a Rhone wine by Jean-Luc Colombo or the
Perrin family at Chateau Beaucastel.
</P>
<P>
   Next day, at a dockside restaurant in Port Vendres, it was time
for a chilled bottle of a simple local white from the Chateau de
Jau at Cases de Pene, northwest of Perpignan. Probably made from
the macabeo grape, it had twice the character of the thin whites
sold at fish restaurants along the Cote d'Azur.
</P>
<P>
   The Chateau de Jau is one of the few wineries in this part of
France that sells regularly in the U.S. Its Jaja de Jau, a
delightful summer wine, is widely available.
</P>
<P>
   In the great rush to varietal names _ chardonnay, merlot,
cabernet _ the names of individual estates often are ignored. This
presents a particular problem for winemakers from an unfamiliar
region like Corbieres-Roussillon, who cannot get the wine-drinking
public's attention.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps quality does count in the end. If it does, we just
might see wines from this remote corner of France, like those from
Haut-Gleon, Clos des Paulilles or the Chateau la Boutignane, all of
them delicious and all of them relatively inexpensive, on our own
tables.

BERKELEY LAW SCHOOL SEES INCREASE IN MINORITY ENROLLMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT SELNA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERKELEY, Calif. _ Minority enrollment at the University of
California at Berkeley Law School will increase slightly in this
year over a year ago, admissions officials said.
</P>
<P>
   As the law school approaches a second year without affirmative
action in admissions, officials announced that minority admissions
will be up 32 over what they were at the beginning of the 1997-'98
school year.
</P>
<P>
   The increase brings the number of minority students enrolled at
the law school to 85 of the total 275 students enrolled.
</P>
<P>
   Law School Dean Herma Kay Hill said the results were
significant, but indicated that she believed they could improve.
</P>
<P>
   ``While these results are gratifying, they are still below the
level of traditionally underrepresented minority students enrolled
... prior to 1997,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   After the University of California Regents ended affirmative
action in graduate schools last year, minority enrollment at the
Berkeley law school dropped precipitously, and the school enrolled
only one black student _ the lowest black enrollment at since the
1950s.
</P>
<P>
   This put the school in the national spotlight and motivated
administrators to reevaluate some aspects of the admission
practices.
</P>
<P>
   Kay attributed this year's increased minority enrollment in part
to the revised policies, which included de-emphasizing the law
school admission test, or LSAT. She noted the school also
discontinued a formula used to weigh undergraduate grades according
to institutions attended and increased the pool from which the
faculty made its choices.
</P>
<P>
   Minority enrollment at the law school in the upcoming school
year increased across the spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanic enrollees went from 10 to 16 and African Americans
increased form one to nine. However, the biggest jump in minority
enrollment came from a category the school describes as ``Asian
Subgroups.'' These students, which include South Asian, Filipino,
Southeast Asian and Pacific Islanders, rose from six to 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``These changes, while relatively modest, were very important,''
Kay said. ``They helped dispel the false public impression that
(the law school at Berkeley) is hostile to minority candidates
...''
</P>
<P>
   California and Texas are the only states in the country that
have eliminated affirmative action from their public university
enrollment policies. Last year many minority students who had been
admitted said they declined to go to the law school at Berkeley
because they believed it would not be a supportive environment for
minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Kay said that this year, once minority students had been
admitted, law school faculty and students undertook aggressive
efforts to get them to enroll.

<P>
   The American lawn is a gift for folk psychologists. The clipped,
controlled sward in front of the family homestead, meticulously
mown and shorn of alien growths, makes a potent symbol of suburban
conformity and repressed individualism.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the North American tradition of open, unfenced lawns
running down to the roadside contrasts with the European taste for
private gardens bordered by impenetrable high conifers _ a neat
metaphor for setting an open society against one that is happiest
looking in on itself.
</P>
<P>
   All this provides grist for an absorbing exhibition, ``The Lawn,
Surface of Everyday Life,'' running until Nov. 8 at the Canadian
Center of Architecture in Montreal _ a proper city for comparing
the American psyche with the European.
</P>
<P>
   It reveals that over 32 million acres of lawn are cultivated in
North America, and $750 million spent every year on grass seed to
keep them in verdant, apple-pie order.
</P>
<P>
   The perennial grasses from which today's lawns are made were
unknown in North America until the European colonists came. They
found the native annual grasses insufficiently nutritious for their
cattle, so they imported varieties from the old country.
</P>
<P>
   Among them was poa pratensis, now better known as Kentucky
bluegrass; it is still one of the most popular lawn grasses in
America as well as supporting a thriving bloodstock industry.
</P>
<P>
   But what are lawns for? Surrounding a house with grass is
scarcely an obvious or a natural thing to do.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed in 1841, in his classic ``Treatise on the Theory and
Practice of Landscape Gardening,'' the American landscape artist
Andrew Jackson Downing wrote enviously of ``the unrivalled beauty
of the velvet lawns of New England.''
</P>
<P>
   When Charles Dickens visited New England the following year he
observed: ``The well-trimmed lawns and green meadows of home are
not there; and the grass compared with our ornamental plots and
pastures is rank, and rough, and wild.''
</P>
<P>
   The cylinder lawn mower had been invented in England in 1830 by
Edwin Budding, but the first American mowers were not patented
until 1868.
</P>
<P>
   By then, the earth was beginning to move for American lawn
lovers. In 1870 Frank Scott, a disciple of Downing, wrote ``The Art
of Beautifying Suburban Home Grounds on Small Extent.'' In it, he
laid down his golden rule: ``Of all the external decorations of a
house, a well-kept lawn is the most essential...
</P>
<P>
   ``If one could imagine Americans to live their married lives,
each pair in one home, what a pleasing variety might the changing
years bring them. An unbroken lawn around the dwelling should
typify the unwritten page in the opening book of earnest life.''
</P>
<P>
   Already then, the lawn was being promoted as a badge of
contented domesticity and virtue. In 1869 Frederick Law Olmsted and
Calvert Vaux, creators of New York's Central Park, designed a
development at Riverside, Ill., where the houses had front lawns
undivided by fences, one running into the next.
</P>
<P>
   The fashion was promoted by the City Beautiful Movement and
adopted nationally but it has not served the intended cause of
unifying communities. Because the front lawn is visible and shared,
families prefer to romp, picnic and play games in their private _
though often smaller _ backyards.
</P>
<P>
   So much for the communitarian ideal. Yet this image of empty
expanses of orderly grass proved attractive to corporate America
when, in the second half of the century, big businesses moved their
headquarters from the cities to the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Like its residential counterpart, the corporate lawn is seldom a
locus of activity and remains largely unoccupied, a green moat
subject to surveillance and receptive to control _ a ``power
lawn,'' in the words of the Montreal exhibition guide.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast the White House lawn ``has come to serve as the home
lawn for the entire country...exploited for photo opportunities and
news conferences, peace accords, treaty signings and celebrations
of nationhood.''
</P>
<P>
   The influence of the lawns is not always so benign. There are
snakes in the grass. The show includes a display of court documents
from cases where disputes over the condition of the lawn, the
standard of maintenance, unsightly weeds and unneighborly fencing
have led to litigation.
</P>
<P>
   Many communities enforce stringent regulations on such matters,
with heavy penalties for those who default on their citizen's
obligation to keep the mower-blade turning.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Diller, one of the show's curators, says that
defendants sometimes rely on the First Amendment right to freedom
of expression when confronted with ``an almost fascistic control''
in certain communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lawn is a surface on which a lot of ideas are already
encoded relative to conformity,'' she points out. ``and yet it is
on the lawn where individual identities are played out.''
</P>
<P>
   Something to ponder as, perched aboard your space-age power
mowers, masters of your own turf, you do your civic duty by cutting
each pesky blade down to size. &QL;

   Q: What is the difference between a Dvorak keyboard and a
regular keyboard?
</P>
<P>
   _ D.E., via the Internet
</P>
<P>
   A: A Dvorak keyboard has a different arrangement of keys that's
designed for easier typing.
</P>
<P>
   The traditional arrangement of keys is called the Qwerty
keyboard in reference to the order of the keys. It was designed by
Christopher Sholes to prevent machine jams by slowing down typists.
Sholes placed the most-used keys farther apart.
</P>
<P>
   In 1932, August Dvorak and William Dealey introduced a new key
layout that was the product of nearly two decades of research.
Although the Dvorak keyboard could be learned more quickly and
enabled faster typing, Qwerty has remained standard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tired of trying to do something worthwhile for the human
race,'' an April 1997 Discover Magazine article quotes Dvorak as
saying. ``They simply don't want to change!''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is the actor who plays Olivia on ``Sunset Beach'' the same
person who played ``Sister Kate'' on the Odyssey Channel?
</P>
<P>
   _ U.C., Worcester, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A: They're different performers: Olivia Richards is portrayed by
Lesley-Anne Down, whose credits include ``Dallas,'' ``Rough Cut''
and three ``North &AMP; South'' miniseries.
</P>
<P>
   The title character of ``Sister Kate'' was portrayed by
Stephanie Beacham, who has appeared on ``Dynasty,'' ``The Colbys,''
``Beverly Hills, 90210'' and the ``Jackie Collins' Lucky/Chances''
miniseries.
</P>
<P>
   Both performers were born in England: Beacham on Feb. 28, 1947,
in Herefordshire and Down on March 17, 1954, in London.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is it true that Harrison Ford was in ``E.T. The
Extra-Terrestrial''?
</P>
<P>
   _ N.T., Fort Worth
</P>
<P>
   A: Ford plays a biology teacher in the film, which was written
by his wife, Melissa Mathison.
</P>
<P>
   However, most of his work didn't make the final cut of the 1982
movie. In his biggest remaining scene, Ford's back is visible as he
says, ``the frogs won't feel a thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Another famous actor contributed to the film in a
less-than-obvious way. Debra Winger's voice was one of several that
were electronically combined to create E.T.'s speech.

</P>
<P>
   All this provides grist for an absorbing exhibition, ``The Lawn,
Surface of Everyday Life,'' running until Nov. 8 at the Canadian
Center of Architecture in Montreal _ a proper city for comparing
the American psyche with the European.
</P>
<P>
   It reveals that over 32 million acres of lawn are cultivated in
North America, and $750 million spent every year on grass seed to
keep them in verdant, apple-pie order.
</P>
<P>
   The perennial grasses from which today's lawns are made were
unknown in North America until the European colonists came. They
found the native annual grasses insufficiently nutritious for their
cattle, so they imported varieties from the old country.
</P>
<P>
   Among them was poa pratensis, now better known as Kentucky
bluegrass; it is still one of the most popular lawn grasses in
America as well as supporting a thriving bloodstock industry.
</P>
<P>
   But what are lawns for? Surrounding a house with grass is
scarcely an obvious or a natural thing to do.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed in 1841, in his classic ``Treatise on the Theory and
Practice of Landscape Gardening,'' the American landscape artist
Andrew Jackson Downing wrote enviously of ``the unrivalled beauty
of the velvet lawns of New England.''
</P>
<P>
   When Charles Dickens visited New England the following year he
observed: ``The well-trimmed lawns and green meadows of home are
not there; and the grass compared with our ornamental plots and
pastures is rank, and rough, and wild.''
</P>
<P>
   The cylinder lawn mower had been invented in England in 1830 by
Edwin Budding, but the first American mowers were not patented
until 1868.
</P>
<P>
   By then, the earth was beginning to move for American lawn
lovers. In 1870 Frank Scott, a disciple of Downing, wrote ``The Art
of Beautifying Suburban Home Grounds on Small Extent.'' In it, he
laid down his golden rule: ``Of all the external decorations of a
house, a well-kept lawn is the most essential...
</P>
<P>
   ``If one could imagine Americans to live their married lives,
each pair in one home, what a pleasing variety might the changing
years bring them. An unbroken lawn around the dwelling should
typify the unwritten page in the opening book of earnest life.''
</P>
<P>
   Already then, the lawn was being promoted as a badge of
contented domesticity and virtue. In 1869 Frederick Law Olmsted and
Calvert Vaux, creators of New York's Central Park, designed a
development at Riverside, Ill., where the houses had front lawns
undivided by fences, one running into the next.
</P>
<P>
   The fashion was promoted by the City Beautiful Movement and
adopted nationally but it has not served the intended cause of
unifying communities. Because the front lawn is visible and shared,
families prefer to romp, picnic and play games in their private _
though often smaller _ backyards.
</P>
<P>
   So much for the communitarian ideal. Yet this image of empty
expanses of orderly grass proved attractive to corporate America
when, in the second half of the century, big businesses moved their
headquarters from the cities to the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Like its residential counterpart, the corporate lawn is seldom a
locus of activity and remains largely unoccupied, a green moat
subject to surveillance and receptive to control _ a ``power
lawn,'' in the words of the Montreal exhibition guide.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast the White House lawn ``has come to serve as the home
lawn for the entire country...exploited for photo opportunities and
news conferences, peace accords, treaty signings and celebrations
of nationhood.''
</P>
<P>
   The influence of the lawns is not always so benign. There are
snakes in the grass. The show includes a display of court documents
from cases where disputes over the condition of the lawn, the
standard of maintenance, unsightly weeds and unneighborly fencing
have led to litigation.
</P>
<P>
   Many communities enforce stringent regulations on such matters,
with heavy penalties for those who default on their citizen's
obligation to keep the mower-blade turning.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Diller, one of the show's curators, says that
defendants sometimes rely on the First Amendment right to freedom
of expression when confronted with ``an almost fascistic control''
in certain communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lawn is a surface on which a lot of ideas are already
encoded relative to conformity,'' she points out. ``and yet it is
on the lawn where individual identities are played out.''
</P>
<P>
   Something to ponder as, perched aboard your space-age power
mowers, masters of your own turf, you do your civic duty by cutting
each pesky blade down to size. &QL;

<P>
   The American lawn is a gift for folk psychologists. The clipped,
controlled sward in front of the family homestead, meticulously
mown and shorn of alien growths, makes a potent symbol of suburban
conformity and repressed individualism.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the North American tradition of open, unfenced lawns
running down to the roadside contrasts with the European taste for
private gardens bordered by impenetrable high conifers _ a neat
metaphor for setting an open society against one that is happiest
looking in on itself.
</P>
<P>
   All this provides grist for an absorbing exhibition, ``The Lawn,
Surface of Everyday Life,'' running until Nov. 8 at the Canadian

FIRST-DAY ANXIETY A HAIRY SITUATION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MONICA ANDERSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first day of school has come and gone without a hitch.
Hooray.
</P>
<P>
   My kids actually said it was ``OK.'' I can live with that. We
all know that the first day of most anything is an incredibly
anxious time. The first day on the new job, the first day at boot
camp, the first day as a parent _ all produce a certain degree of
heart pounding and stomach churning.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, all of that stress soon becomes a dim memory as we
adapt to the routine of our new environment. Before long, the
hidden nervousness becomes outright boredom.
</P>
<P>
   Those eight hours that seemed to fly by at first become a third
of your day that just never seems to end. That last half-hour of
your shift creeps by slower than rush hour traffic in Los Angeles _
during a blizzard. Sometimes it takes all of your willpower not to
tear at your clothing and run head-first into the nearest wall over
and over again. Then there's that jerk _ oh, sorry, I'm getting off
the subject.
</P>
<P>
   First days, yes, of course. I only remember one of my many new
beginnings at school. It was the fourth grade. New neighborhood.
New elementary school. Mom dropped me off because I insisted that I
did not need an escort. Subsequently, I could not find my homeroom.
When I finally located it, in a trailer house in the parking lot
behind the school, I was 10 minutes late. The teacher, a lovely
lady with seven chin hairs, had already called the roll.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who are you?'' she barked when I stumbled through the door
wide-eyed and panting. One glance at her and I wanted to say, ``I'm
from Schick and I brought the razor you ordered.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mom had warned me about being a smart aleck, so I said,
``I'm Mo-nee-ka.'' She glanced at her attendance sheet and told me,
``You must be in the wrong class. I don't have any students by that
name.''
</P>
<P>
   Undaunted, I handed her the schedule that I had received in the
principal's office when I registered during the previous week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh Monica,'' she said. ``I thought you said Monique.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's `Mo NEE ka,''' I responded, emphasizing the second
syllable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, it's spelled like Monica. My sister's kid is named
Monica, and she spells it just like this: M-O-N-I-C-A.''
</P>
<P>
   Give me a break lady, I thought. By then, everyone was staring
at me and I just wanted to crawl into a hole and die along with my
weird name.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, `Mo nee ka,' go sit over there by James.''
</P>
<P>
   `It's Jamal,'' responded my new neighbor. Jamal and I shared a
sympathetic glance. ``Call me Pete,'' he told me.
</P>
<P>
   I don't remember much after that. I think we learned geography
and map reading that year, which might explain why I get lost all
the time. I do remember that my homeroom teacher mispronounced my
name the entire year. On several occasions she even called me
``James.'' I stopped correcting her after the first month and just
answered to whatever name she called me.
</P>
<P>
   It's been a long time since the fourth grade, and I'm sure the
emotional scars left from that ordeal have all healed.
</P>
<P>
   However, the last time I saw that teacher, just a couple of
years ago, she had a thick beard and a moustache. Maybe it's a
coincidence, maybe not, but when she asked me about ``James,'' I
swear that thing grew an inch. Hhmmm.

WHERE SANDWICHES AND DESSERTS ARE ALLOWED TO STAND OUT

<P>
   NEW YORK _ At Mitchel London Foods, 542 Ninth Avenue (40th
Street), white walls, blond wood and marble tables provide a
properly neutral setting for the main attraction, the inviting
desserts, sandwiches and quiches.
</P>
<P>
   London, a caterer who also has a shop by the same name at 22A
East 65th Street and who prepares the food for the Parlour Cafe at
ABC Carpet and Home in the Flatiron district, moved his main
kitchen from 42nd Street to the new location and carved out enough
space for a retail shop and cafe.
</P>
<P>
   It is stocked with his rustic apple tarts ($2 each), big peach
and berry pies ($16), sumptuous cupcakes ($2) and fudge marble
brownie tarts ($3.50). On the savory side there are individual
quiches ($3.95) and delicious dilled egg salad sandwiches ($4.95).
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the East 65th Street shop, the new operation has a
kitchen, in which London cooks and turns out an excellent hamburger
with fries ($4.95) or a half roast chicken ($8.95). Once things are
a bit more organized, there will be delivery in the neighborhood.

   Steven Chase, an owner of Peaceful Palate, 247A Columbus Avenue
(71st Street), described his life as being ``surrounded by hot
dogs.'' His grandfather, Leonard Pines, founded Hebrew National.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Chase and his partner, Michael Leopold, are also in the hot
dog business, but their hot dogs are made from naturally lean
ranch-bred buffalo meat in a partnership with Frontier Buffalo, a
top purveyor of buffalo meat.
</P>
<P>
   Each hot dog, about 2 ounces, has 70 calories and 4 grams of fat
(compared with 120 to 190 calories and 10 to 17 grams of fat for
many major brands). The sodium content, 190 milligrams, is about
half the usual amount in a hot dog, but the protein, 10 grams, is
higher than the typical 6 to 7 grams.
</P>
<P>
   Chase's hot dogs are very tasty, with good snap when bitten. He
sells them at his minuscule storefront for $2.50 each, including a
roll and choice of toppings.
</P>
<P>
   Within a few weeks they will also be sold retail, for about $4
for a package of five, at the store and at Fairway, 2127 Broadway
(74th Street) and 2328 12th Avenue (132d Street); Balducci's, 424
Avenue of the Americas (Ninth Street); Dean &AMP; DeLuca, 560 Broadway
(Prince Street), and Stew Leonard's in Connecticut, at 100 Westport
Avenue in Norwalk and 99 Federal Road in Danbury.
</P>
<P>
   As might be expected from someone whose family created Hebrew
National, Chase plans to introduce kosher Frontier Buffalo hot dogs
in about six weeks, and he is working on corned buffalo and
pastrami. &QL;

TOP 100 LIST SPURS RENEWED SUPPORT FOR BOWEN, WEST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY SWINDELL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The sound and fury that followed the Modern Library board's
selection of the 100 best novels in English appear now to have
waned, and the list soon may be almost forgotten. But of necessity,
there will be postscripts, and here's one.
</P>
<P>
   Along with a few hundred others who watch the book scene and
work on its periphery, I got in my licks and supposed I was done
with the issue. But three readers _ two women, one man _ contacted
me by letters (the women) and by telephone (the man), all on the
matter of Rebecca West.
</P>
<P>
   My contention was that Dame Rebecca West belonged on the list
with one or another book, identifying two works of hers that I have
read _ ``The Fountain Overflows'' (1936) and ``The Thinking Reed''
(1956). Although distanced by 20 years, they are consecutive in her
scattershot experience as a novelist. (Her first novel appeared in
1912, her seventh and last one in 1966).
</P>
<P>
   In rooting for West, I posed her as superior to a contemporary,
the Anglo-Irish Elizabeth Bowen, who also published seven novels
and did make the list with her 1938 novel ``The Death of the
Heart.'' I've never read that one, but I read her well-praised
``The Heat of the Day'' (1949) and found it clear and antiseptic in
the best Henry James tradition, but lacking the crackling energy of
Rebecca West's prose.
</P>
<P>
   The three respondents endorsed my support of West, but with
rider clauses. One woman believed West definitely should be on the
list because ``The Fountain Overflows'' easily is one of the best
100 novels in its language, but she rated Bowen as the better
novelist overall. The other woman had not read (or heard of)
Elizabeth Bowen, but was adamant that ``The Strange Necessity,'' a
West title from the late 1920s, is a wrongly neglected masterpiece.
</P>
<P>
   These two women may or may not be acquainted, but it's a
curiosity that neither wished to be identified in print. The male
caller may not have minded, but he didn't give his name. I became a
listener while he made a solid case for Rebecca West as a great
writer, but not so much a great novelist as a superstar journalist
and political philosopher whose nonfiction works cast a spell.
West's ``The Meaning of Treason'' (1949), published in the
aftermath of the Nuremberg war crimes trial, which she attended,
certainly fortifies that claim.
</P>
<P>
   She was an altogether remarkable woman, this woman who wasn't
Rebecca West at all, but was Cecily Isabel Fairchild, London-born
in 1892 with that well-known silver spoon in her mouth. She was a
precocious feminist, joining at age 16 the Women Writers Suffrage
League. At 19 she became a professional journalist (for ``The
Freewoman)'' and chose Rebecca West as her byline in homage to the
heroine of Ibsen's ``Rosmersholm.''
</P>
<P>
   She was 20 when her approving review of H.G. Wells' ``Marriage''
led to their meeting, which culminated in her 10-year love affair
with an undivorced man who was 26 years her senior. In 1914, she
bore a son, Anthony West, who eventually became a potboiling
novelist and his father's biographer. Some years after the liaison
with Wells, she had a long, childless and apparently placid legal
union with a London banker, but she continued to support Wells'
views against conventional marriage.
</P>
<P>
   For longevity, Rebecca West was the approximate literary
equivalent to Lillian Gish in the performing arts. Ever the
outspoken essayist, she contributed reviews past the 90th birthday
that was her last one. Since her death in 1983 (now I'm quoting
from the ``Oxford Companion to English Literature''), ``The
reputation of her `too intellectual' novels tends to have been
eclipsed somewhat by the aggressive panache of her reportage and
journalism, but feminist reassessments have admired her strong and
unconventional heroines, and her fine craftsmanship.''
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the ``list tizzy,'' I feel a need to read more
West, and more Elizabeth Bowen.

ROASTING SALMON WITH A TASTE OF THE WILD 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A few years ago, needing some days of fishing to
clear my head, I took my wife, Lisa, and our eldest son, Court, to
the San Juan Islands off the coast of Washington. This part of
America has some of the world's most spectacular natural scenery,
with a series of pristine, forested islands dotting the tranquil
waters of Puget Sound. We stayed in a small cabin on Orcas Island,
where I'd heard that the salmon fishing would be stupendous. It
was.
</P>
<P>
   Early every morning, I went out on a small boat with some local
fishermen. Not a day went by that we didn't catch more than our
fair share of salmon. In fact, one day I caught nine silver salmon
weighing three to seven pounds each, which were perfect for cooking
whole. Good fishing always gets my creative juices flowing. Right
up from the dock I would head to the garden next door to the cabin.
It was overflowing with ripe vegetables, which made it easy to put
together a feast.
</P>
<P>
   Silver salmon is quite fatty, so it didn't seem suited to the
pungent dill and rich sauce that frequently accompany salmon. I
thought that the scent of an aromatic herb like rosemary with its
lemony, pine flavor and a simple roasting over some garden-fresh
vegetables would better highlight my catch.
</P>
<P>
   I wrapped it in very thin slices of lean, home-cured bacon,
which added a wonderful smoky flavor to the succulent fish.
Although this preparation was inspired by wild salmon, the approach
turned out to be fine for the ordinary farmed Atlantic salmon and,
in fact, imparted to it a taste of the wild.
</P>
<P>
   The next day on the island, the leftovers inspired me to create
a composed salad served with a simple sauce of freshly picked
watercress minced into some homemade mayonnaise and a touch of
lemon juice. Either way, served with bottles of the local riesling,
perfectly chilled, this was great American food at its best.
</P>
<P>
   WHOLE ROASTED SALMON WITH ROOT VEGETABLES
</P>
<P>
   Time: 1{ hours
</P>
<P>
   1{ pounds whole baby turnips, well-washed and trimmed
</P>
<P>
   1{ pounds fingerling potatoes, well-washed
</P>
<P>
   1 6-pound whole salmon, cleaned, head and tail on
</P>
<P>
   3 5-inch branches fresh rosemary
</P>
<P>
   1 whole lemon, well washed, sliced crosswise
</P>
<P>
   Coarse salt and freshly ground pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   } pound very thinly sliced premium-quality bacon
</P>
<P>
   6 leeks, white part with a trace of green, split lengthwise and
well washed
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon fresh rosemary needles
</P>
<P>
   Cracked black pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   2 bunches arugula, well washed and trimmed, optional
</P>
<P>
   6 fresh lemon slices, optional.
</P>
<P>
   1. Place turnips in boiling salted water to cover. Simmer for 2
minutes, add the potatoes and simmer for 5 minutes longer. Drain
and pat dry. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   2. Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Rinse salmon and pat it dry.
Place 3 long sprigs of rosemary into the cavity. Cover rosemary
with lemon slices. Season to taste with salt and pepper, noting
that the bacon will add saltiness. Carefully wrap the salmon in
bacon strips, completely covering the top side.
</P>
<P>
   3. Place leeks, along with reserved turnips and potatoes, in a
shallow roasting pan large enough to hold salmon. Sprinkle
vegetables with rosemary needles, and season to taste with salt and
pepper, again noting that the bacon will add saltiness. Lay the
bacon-wrapped salmon on top of the vegetables. Season top with
cracked black pepper.
</P>
<P>
   4. Place pan in oven, and roast for about 15 minutes per inch of
thickness of the fish, or until the fish is just opaque by the
backbone. (An instant-read thermometer will register 135 degrees
when inserted into center of fish.)
</P>
<P>
   5. Remove fish from oven, and allow to rest for about 30 minutes
or until the fish and vegetables have come to room temperature.
</P>
<P>
   6. Place fish on a serving platter, and surround it with
vegetables. If desired, garnish platter with bunches of arugula or
any other bitter green and a few lemon slices. Serve at room
temperature.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 6 servings.

   Enfolds Yattarna Chardonnay 1995, South Australia. About $50. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   John Duval, the chief winemaker at Penfolds, says this is the
white wine equivalent of the winery's legendary Grange, whose
reputation as Australia's finest red wine has never been seriously
challenged. Grange, first released in 1955, has a track record;
this, the first commercialized vintage of Yattarna, has not.
</P>
<P>
   The grapes come from Adelaide Hills and McLaren Vale vineyards.
Aging was 10 months in French oak, some new, some used once before.
</P>
<P>
   This is a spectacular wine. It is profoundly rich; it has heft
and length and, at this stage of its development, beautiful
balance. It holds out the promise of considerable elegance a few
years hence.

IN SANTA FE, EARTH, SKY AND MUSIC ACHIEVE A HARMONIC CONVERGENCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LIZ STEVENS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA FE, N.M. _ The theater set is simple and inspired. Red
blankets cover nine cots. Five blue cypress trees divide the stage
diagonally. The yellow floor rolls wavelike into the distant
backdrop, where a violet sky sets off a silhouette of black
mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Credit designer Antony McDonald with the cots, trees and
flooring for the Santa Fe Opera's 1998 production of Berlioz's
``Beatrice and Benedict.'' Credit Mother Nature with the backdrop.
</P>
<P>
   A half-hour before the house lights dimmed, opera lovers milled
about Stravinsky Terrace, watching the sun set behind the Jemez
Mountains, its last rays turning the underbellies of the clouds hot
pink. To the east, a full moon rose over the Sangre de Cristo
peaks, cast lilac in the dusk.
</P>
<P>
   Two shows for the price of one.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere do opera and creation mingle so harmonically as the New
Mexican high desert. Since 1957, the outdoor Santa Fe Opera has
been known as much for its sublime locale as its artistic merit and
adventuresome spirit. Cradled in a natural amphitheater 10 minutes
north of the city, the opera delights in its relationship with the
land and sky. Lightning punctuates arias. Chilly evening breezes
toy with the sopranos' skirts.
</P>
<P>
   It used to be that the summer's frequent rainstorms regularly
doused patrons. The theater's original architecture left almost all
seats open to the elements, making umbrellas as prevalent as opera
glasses. Not anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen million dollars' worth of renovations this year bought
not only a new theater, minus the stage, but also a roof that
covers the entire audience. The revamped building _ partly inspired
by the nearby Puye Cliff Dwellings and suggesting Japanese design _
has generally received positive nods in the press. And most
opera-goers, when asked, expressed satisfaction with the changes.
But certain traditionalists are appalled by the new barrier between
the music and the stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, as with every other part of Santa Fe, (the opera) has
been sold to the tourists,'' wrote Santa Fe critic and writer John
Pen La Farge on the opinions page of the daily Santa Fe New Mexican
last September. ``After all, it is not we who complain of rain; we,
as we always have, find such to be part of the experience, and
prepare for it with gusto and pride.''
</P>
<P>
   True or not, attending an opera in Santa Fe remains a special
event, for neophytes and connoisseurs, locals and tourists. Forget
the stereotypical images of haughty opera patrons in black tie. The
SFO takes its cues from Santa Fe itself: earthy, spiritual, a
little bit funky. Where else would you find opera patrons wrapped
in blankets to ward off the cold desert air, or bundled in parkas,
or wearing baseball caps?
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just part of the Santa Fe experience _ a night like
this, this beautiful amphitheater out here, the views,'' says Paul
Roth, tailgating Santa Fe-style with wife Lucy before the
performance of ``Beatrice and Benedict.'' Seated on lawn chairs,
they dine on marinated chicken and spinach salad. The Roths, former
Dallas residents who retired to a home only minutes from the opera,
attend two or three of the five productions each summer.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every season includes two favorite operas, an opera by
Strauss, one premiere and one unusual or cutting-edge production.
In 1996, the SFO gave Thomas Picker's ``Emmeline'' its world
premiere. In 1970, the American premiere of Luciano Berio's
controversial ``Opera'' had patrons arguing its merits during the
performance. ``Opera's'' male nudity prompted one woman to threaten
to call the police.
</P>
<P>
   This night's performance puts a bit of a feminist twist on the
adaptation of Shakespeare's ``Much Ado About Nothing.'' In just a
couple of hours, native Texan Susan Graham will sweep onstage as
Beatrice in a red velvet riding coat and trousers, and launch into
melodius banter with Benedict, played and sung by Gordon Gietz. She
will tote a rifle and playfully swing a dead rabbit in a friend's
face _ not exactly ladylike.
</P>
<P>
   Even in English, opera can be difficult to dissect, but tonight
the words are less crucial than the music. The elegant curve of the
theater ceiling draws the principals' clear, rich voices up and
over the audience, and nearly lifts you from your seat. Song here
is a mortal rhapsody that complements the heavens.
</P>
<P>
   Opera may not be for everyone, but fans of the SFO say it's more
than just opera. Think of it as embracing the relationship between
earth, sky, art and humanity. Think about natural beauty vs. the
beauty we create.
</P>
<P>
   Or think about it this way: You can wear jeans.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   ONE MAN'S VISION: New Mexico was literally a cure for John
Crosby. During high school, chronic asthma prompted doctors to send
him west from Connecticut, and for the 1940-41 academic year,
Crosby attended school in Los Alamos, 15 miles west of Santa Fe. He
fell in love with the place.
</P>
<P>
   Crosby returned east, fought the war in Europe and attended Yale
and then Columbia University, where opera became his passion. In
1956, he conceived the idea for an outdoor summer opera festival in
Santa Fe. In addition to its beauty, he reasoned, Santa Fe had
fewer mosquitoes and less rain and air traffic than the outdoor
facilities back east.
</P>
<P>
   With a $200,000 loan from his father, Crosby bought the land and
built the opera in a natural amphitheater off the Tesuque Highway.
(Acoustician Jack Purcell determined the exact spot by firing a gun
at various points on the property and listening to the echo.)
</P>
<P>
   The original house seated 480 on wooden benches. Although the
repertory would extend from the traditional to the unorthodox, all
operas would be sung in English to make them more accessible, and
ticket prices would start at $2.40.
</P>
<P>
   In its first season, the opera gained a reputation for its
democratic setup (no one person maintained star status), its
penchant for physically appealing performers and its youth _ almost
everyone involved was under 35.
</P>
<P>
   Crosby, then 30, not only conducted, he also passed out
blankets, directed parking and fixed the plumbing. The first
night's performance of ``Madame Butterfly'' sold out, as did the
next five performances. Maestro Igor Stravinsky sat in during
rehearsals of his own work, ``The Rake's Progress,'' and developed
a close relationship with Crosby that lasted until Stravinsky's
death.
</P>
<P>
   Tourism in Santa Fe boomed, and the opera estimated that 70
percent of its audience that first season had never attended live
opera before.
</P>
<P>
   By 1958, the opera world still was not wholly convinced of Santa
Fe's legitimacy. ``There is no opera worth speaking of outside New
York City,'' the Metropolitan Opera's general manager, Rudolf Bing,
told the press. By the end of that same month, Bing had agreed to
serve on the SFO's Artistic Council.
</P>
<P>
   On July 27, 1967, the Santa Fe Opera burned to the ground. The
season continued in a school gymnasium, and eventually a new,
larger theater replaced the old, serving through the summer of
1997.
</P>
<P>
   In 42 seasons, the SFO has hosted eight world premieres and more
than two dozen American premieres. Its acclaimed apprentice program
for singers has graduated such opera luminaries as Sherrill Milnes,
Judith Blegen, Samuel Ramey, Ashley Putnam, Kurt Streit and James
Morris.
</P>
<P>
   The apprentice technician program accepts 60 young people a
season, and the opera's community-outreach programs serve tens of
thousands of children and adults every year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Santa Fe Opera is a major, major contributor to the
popularity of opera in the United States. It's a player on the
world stage,'' notes Fort Worth Opera general director Bill Walker.
``Santa Fe is a destination opera. You go there, and you know in
four or five days you're going to see three or four operas you want
to see. It's a thing that has become a tradition with people who
really enjoy opera and want to see what's on the cutting edge.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, Walker, a principal baritone with the Metropolitan
Opera, performed in ``La Traviata'' at Santa Fe, with Crosby
conducting. The opera founder, Walker says, ``has been a visionary
from the very beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   In September 2000, the 72-year-old Crosby will pass the baton to
Richard Gaddes, currently the opera's associate general director.
Gaddes, a graduate of England's Trinity College of Music, was 26
when Crosby asked him to move to New Mexico from London and join
the Santa Fe Opera as artistic administrator. Despite the initial
culture shock, Gaddes stayed from 1969 to 1978. He moved to
Missouri in the late '70s after co-founding the Opera Theatre of
St. Louis in 1976, but in 1988 he returned to Santa Fe.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the SFO's identity comes from the esprit created among
the artists, Gaddes emphasizes. The artists often move to New
Mexico for the season, and they ``bring their families here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's part holiday, part work,'' adds Gaddes. ``And why do the
artists come? Not for the money, because our fees don't compete
with the fees that are paid elsewhere. We're here for some reason
other than the big bucks.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the opera's $10 million budget this year, ticket sales from
the 40 performances will generate about half. (Among opera
companies, that's considered quite good, Walker says; the Fort
Worth Opera takes in between 30 and 40 percent of its $1.4 million
budget through tickets, he says.) The remainder comes from
corporate, foundation and private donors, the vast majority coming
from outside New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   As do most of the patrons. While one-third of the opera's
audience lives in New Mexico, two-thirds come from the 49 other
states and 24 foreign countries. They range from a group of Swedes
traveling to see the American premiere of Ingvar Lidholm's ``A
Dream Play,'' based on the play by August Strindberg, to the 28
members of the Opera Lovers of Midland, here to see hometown girl
Susan Graham star as Beatrice.
</P>
<P>
   MORE
</P>
<P>
   On average, patrons fill 90 percent of the opera's 2,126 seats
during any given performance.
</P>
<P>
   Part of Santa Fe's mission is to put up cutting-edge operas
other companies cannot or will not present.
</P>
<P>
   ``Santa Fe's greatest image,'' Walker says, ``is that they have
no fear.'' And Gaddes acknowledges the opera's freedom in this
regard. ``We draw a sophisticated audience from elsewhere, and
frankly it's our niche. It's what we do, and it's what we've done
since 1957.''
</P>
<P>
   RANCH WITH A DIFFERENCE: Director John Copley is running late.
He rushes from the administrative office to the outdoor rehearsal
space called The Sombra, where two of his apprentices practice a
scene from ``The Barber of Seville.'' The demonstrative Copley
mouths along with the libretto and bounces on the balls of his feet
to the intermittent piano accompaniment.
</P>
<P>
   The British director has spent his past 12 summers with Santa
Fe. This season he directs ``Madama Butterfly'' and the renowned
apprentice program. Today and on Aug. 23, the 40 apprentices will
perform a series of scenes before an audience that includes arts
administrators from around the country in search of new talent.
</P>
<P>
   The opera's ranch lies a short hike down the road behind the
theater. Here, the artists and apprentices have use of four
rehearsal halls, practice rooms, a cantina serving fresh-baked
scones for breakfast, even a swimming pool. (For instance, there's
the ``Magic Flute's'' Prince Tamino taking a dip.) During the
daytime, fluid singing voices wash over the grounds, emoting love,
rage and sorrow in various European languages.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Fe's ecological conscience extends to its opera as well.
The parking lot features non-sky-polluting lights. The huge sloped
roof catches thousands of gallons of rain each summer. And an
on-site wetlands cleanses the waste water, which irrigates the
shady flower-strewn grounds.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Thursday night, tailgaters begin filling the opera
parking lot two hours in advance of the performance. They include
opera virgins such as 20-year-old Ken Brodeur and 25-year-old Cindy
Zoldi, interns at the Los Alamos Laboratory this summer, eating
cheese and crackers in the back of a sport utility vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the way opera needs to be for everyone,'' Brodeur
insists.
</P>
<P>
   And they include the staff of Jones Intercable from Albuquerque,
being wooed by a prospective client with a catered dinner under a
white tent featuring bouquets of red roses and glasses of fume
blanc.
</P>
<P>
   And then there are the serious opera buffs attending the
weeklong seminar ``Opera: Drama, Music and Meaning,'' led by the
enthusiastic Mary Kime, a former music history professor at the
University of Denver. Kime's pupils attend four operas in a week
and critique each production the morning after.
</P>
<P>
   ``The drama of the setting is so spectacular that already you're
on another level when you come here,'' says Kime, who has been
leading groups here for 15 summers. ``You're looking at the
mountains, and as the night progresses you have the addition of all
the wonderful things that happen.''
</P>
<P>
   She recalls a production of ``Don Giovanni'' when, at the moment
the title character is condemned to hell, a bolt of lightning shot
through the clouds. Walker was in the audience for that, too. ``It
was wonderful,'' he recollects.
</P>
<P>
   Of the new theater, Kime says ``It's spectacular. Now the
acoustics are the best they've ever been.''
</P>
<P>
   Seated nearby, eating dinner on a parking lot curb, Jon and
Julie Thomas of Lubbock, Texas, remember their first visit to the
Santa Fe Opera in 1975 as part of a graduate-level class. ``It was
cold and rainy, and we had standing-room-only tickets,'' Julie
Thomas says. ``It was an exciting experience.''

   ``Sometimes you can see the lights in the mountains and you can
feel the breeze coming through the theater,'' adds her husband. ``I
like that. I like the outdoors.''
</P>
<P>
   Just before 9 p.m., the crowd begins filtering into the
amphitheater, packing the gift shop, mingling on the Plaza Cibola,
already wrapping themselves in quilts. ``Does it look like a flying
boat to you?'' one woman asks a friend, staring at the vast upward
sweep of the theater's pine ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something about doing opera outdoors,'' muses
marketing director Tom Morris, wearing one of the night's rare
tuxedos. ``There's a barrier that is taken away.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunset over, the full moon escorts latecomers to their seats;
lights in Los Alamos and Pojoaque twinkle in the distance; and
Santa Fe settles in for another night at the opera.
</P>
<P>
   As Beatrice sings her final aria _ admitting to herself she
loves Benedict after all _ the Big Dipper peeks under a corner of
the theater roof. Maybe the stars miss their view of the audience
as much as some in the audience miss the stars.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe they're just happy to listen.

 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ So now the world knows for sure what most of us had
suspected all along _ the president of the United States, the most
politically powerful man on the globe, is a lying lecher.
</P>
<P>
   What can we do about it? Does it matter?
</P>
<P>
   Does it say something sad about us as a nation if we simply
ignore the immorality of our elected leader? Or is public
humiliation a sufficient penalty for private misdeeds that posed no
constitutional crisis?
</P>
<P>
   There are no easy answers to those questions.
</P>
<P>
   An overnight instant USA Today-CNN-Gallup Poll after President
Clinton's partial confession Monday night suggests that a majority
of the public does not want to kick the president out of the high
office to which he was twice elected. Subsequent television
interviews also indicate a strong public inclination to drop the
whole subject and let Hillary deal with him.
</P>
<P>
   The president's personal favorability ratings dropped to 40
percent from 60 percent, but 72 percent of those surveyed said it
would be in the national interest for Clinton to finish the
remainder of his term. Only about a quarter favored impeachment or
resignation.
</P>
<P>
   The president himself shows no sign of giving up. He may be
cornered but he is still a fighter. In the past, that fighting
spirit has helped him to rebound from potential political disaster.
</P>
<P>
   And there's a lot left to fight about. We are not rid of the
Monica Saga yet. The probe of the president's indiscretions
continues. We do not know what evidence of misbehavior Independent
Counsel Kenneth Starr has accumulated or how the president
testified Monday before the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton did not answer all the questions from prosecutors,
leaving him vulnerable to yet another grand jury summons. And he
now has a vast credibility problem that may handicap his ability to
govern effectively, which in turn could undercut his high
job-performance approval ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, public opinion can be fickle. Those who live by the
polls can die by them.
</P>
<P>
   Voters may eventually turn against the president when they learn
more than he has yet told them about his 18-month dalliance with
former White House intern Monica Lewinsky. When they have had ample
time to ruminate on the enormity of his deceit, they may conclude
he's become an intolerable political liability.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Starr remains the least popular public figure
in the country. A majority of voters believe he is unfairly
hassling the president for partisan motives, which in the past has
helped immunize Clinton against public outrage.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton struck a combative tone in his statement that indicates
he will go down fists flailing, if he goes down at all. He meant to
warn those who are already writing him off as a lame-duck president
that they are being vastly premature. His usually cuddly persona
was replaced by a chilly, even cold, veneer.
</P>
<P>
   In many of his remarks he angrily attacked the legitimacy of
Starr's four-year probe, which Clinton and his wife see as a
partisan vendetta. This approach had its downside. It so irritated
Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch that he called
Clinton a ``jerk.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton's statement was a signal that he will not meekly
capitulate if the House Judiciary Committee decides to hold
impeachment hearings based on Starr's final report, expected to be
issued soon. The committee can recommend impeachment, censure or a
mild reprimand _ or clear the president's name.
</P>
<P>
   The sheer weight of the scandal and the inability to reach
closure so long as Clinton is in office may ultimately force his
resignation to rescue his party and elevate Vice President Al Gore
before the 2000 presidential election. But the president is clearly
not contemplating that yet.
</P>
<P>
   In his statement, Clinton finally conceded that despite his
previous denials he indeed had indulged in an improper relationship
with Monica Lewinsky. But he bristled defensively rather than seek
sympathetic understanding. And he was conspicuously not forthcoming
about his actions.
</P>
<P>
   He made the technical argument that he had been ``legally
accurate'' in prior statements and never told anyone to lie, but he
skipped the details that might have convinced us he was really
sorry and would not betray our trust again.
</P>
<P>
   In all, it was an unsatisfactory performance.
</P>
<P>
   What happens next is anyone's guess. No matter how many people
say they are bored by this story, the appetite for it has not been
sated.

   PERPIGNAN, France _ The French call this western Mediterranean
corner of their country the last frontier. It is a vast expanse of
arid, inhospitable land in southern France bounded by this city,
the city of Carcassonne and the Spanish border.
</P>
<P>
   In the back country leading up into the Pyrenees and in some
former fishing villages along the coast, the old people still speak
Catalan, which has been described as the language of the Roman foot
soldier.
</P>
<P>
   The language may be as close as we will ever come to the Latin
argot of the Roman Empire, but it isn't the only remnant of those
times: vines were almost certainly planted here by the Phoenicians
and later the Greeks.
</P>
<P>
   But the locals like to think that the first commercial wine
producers were the former Roman soldiers who settled here after the
Gallic wars, some 2,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The major wine areas here are Corbieres and Roussillon, but
where one begins and the other ends has always been something of a
mystery. With one exception, their modern wine history is not
particularly edifying.
</P>
<P>
   In the first half of this century, the region contributed
enthusiastically to the vast ocean of bad wine produced in southern
France, much of it eventually burned off as surplus. The exception
was natural sweet wine.
</P>
<P>
   The Roussillon region still produces some 90 percent of all the
inexpensive sweet wine made in France, and along the country roads
there are stands selling a local selection of Rivesaltes, muscat de
Rivesaltes or Banyuls, a sweet wine made from grenache grapes.
</P>
<P>
   Corbieres and Roussillon have gone through the same changes that
have affected better-known wine regions to the east, like Provence.
Serious winemakers and grape growers, attracted by cheaper land and
assured of some government support, have come south from Bordeaux
and Burgundy to instill new life into these ancient vineyards. The
results have often been spectacular.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Paris restaurateurs, seeking to replace the
unconscionably expensive Bordeaux and Burgundies, have turned to
other wines of the southwest. Some of these, from places like
Cahors, Gaillac, Madiran and Irouleguy, have become familiar names,
thanks in part to their reasonable prices and in part to
enthusiastic promoters like the restaurateurs Alain Senderens and
Alain Dutournier.
</P>
<P>
   I've never shared their enthusiasm. To me, the wines always
seemed hard and tannic and deficient in fruit. And at the risk of
henceforth being seated by the kitchen at some these restaurants,
I'll say that some of the wines from Corbieres- Roussillon are much
better.
</P>
<P>
   At their best, they display richness, fruit and roundness rarely
encountered in many of the wines of the Southwest, and none of the
defects usually associated with hot-climate wines _ too much
alcohol, oxydization, dryness.
</P>
<P>
   At the Terrasse de Soleil, an old Catalan farm house converted
into a country inn in the hills above the village of Ceret, I had a
cabernet sauvignon from the Mas Sauvy, a relatively new estate of
some 200 acres at Villeneuve de la Raho, just a few miles south of
Perpignan.
</P>
<P>
   While merely a vin de pays, this was a delightful cabernet that
had been aged 12 months in oak. It would be welcome anywhere in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   The next day in Ceret _ where Picasso once lived and worked _ I
stopped at Les Feuillants, one of France's least-known restaurants
with two Michelin stars. Marie-Louise Banyols, the owner, presides
over a wine cellar like few others; her collection of the wines of
the Domaine de la Romanee Conti would make the owner of any
Burgundian three-star restaurant speechless with envy.
</P>
<P>
   She also has a fascinating collection of local wines. Her
assistant sommelier, Christine Cannac, chose a 1993 blend of
mourvedre and syrah from the Domaine du Mas Blanc that had the
richness and elegance of a Rhone wine by Jean-Luc Colombo or the
Perrin family at Chateau Beaucastel.
</P>
<P>
   Next day, at a dockside restaurant in Port Vendres, it was time
for a chilled bottle of a simple local white from the Chateau de
Jau at Cases de Pene, northwest of Perpignan. Probably made from
the macabeo grape, it had twice the character of the thin whites
sold at fish restaurants along the Cote d'Azur.
</P>
<P>
   The Chateau de Jau is one of the few wineries in this part of
France that sells regularly in the U.S. Its Jaja de Jau, a
delightful summer wine, is widely available.
</P>
<P>
   In the great rush to varietal names _ chardonnay, merlot,
cabernet _ the names of individual estates often are ignored. This
presents a particular problem for winemakers from an unfamiliar
region like Corbieres-Roussillon, who cannot get the wine-drinking
public's attention.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps quality does count in the end. If it does, we just
might see wines from this remote corner of France, like those from
Haut-Gleon, Clos des Paulilles or the Chateau la Boutignane, all of
them delicious and all of them relatively inexpensive, on our own
tables.

<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE ELIZABETH, Maine _ Even on a warm, sunny August day, the
view of Two Lights Lighthouse here is, well, Hopperesque. Scenic
but somehow forlorn, frozen in a long-ago time, the lighthouse
evokes the sense of isolation inherent in so many classic Edward
Hopper paintings. Little wonder that ``Lighthouse at Two Lights,''
one of three major paintings and several watercolors he made of the
scene, hangs in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, was made into a
popular museum poster and is pictured on the 1970 6-cent postage
stamp marking Maine's sesquicentennial as a state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two Lights was a symbol of the solitary individual that faced
isolation in the industrial world,'' says Barbara Haskell, a
curator at the Whitney Museum of American Art, which owns two of
the watercolors (and the Hopper estate). ``It was also symbolic of
the vulnerability of that way of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Hopper was indeed prophetic. The Coast Guard automated the
beacon at Two Lights years ago and now, some 70 years after Hopper
painted a scene that became an icon of American art, the white,
gingerbread-trimmed keeper's cottage in it is facing a big change.
The owner plans to expand the house by about a third and add a
two-car garage. Neighbors are horrified.
</P>
<P>
   Workers are scheduled to begin demolishing part of the cottage,
which was built in 1873, on Sept. 8 and, here in Down East Yankee
country, there is little anyone can do legally to stop the owner,
William J. Kourakas Jr., a hometown boy who now works on Wall
Street, lives in Greenwich, Conn., and uses the house as a
year-round retreat.
</P>
<P>
   Kourakas, who bought the keeper's quarters in 1995, declined to
comment for publication, but he has told neighbors that the house
has already been altered and is no longer what Hopper painted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people around here are up in arms,'' said John Rich Jr., a
retired newspaper and television journalist whose front yard looks
out on the view in the Met's painting and who, as a 10-year-old,
witnessed Hopper painting it.
</P>
<P>
   Town residents are rueful, at least partly because their lack of
power is their own fault. When the town council of Cape Elizabeth,
a hamlet about 10 miles southeast of Portland, considered
safeguarding historic buildings in recent years, it sided with
private property rights over mandated preservation. An ordinance
passed last year simply requires anyone embarking on demolition or
construction of a landmark to give 45 days' notice to the town and
to the Maine Historic Preservation Commission. ``That ties my
hands,'' said Michael K. McGovern, the town manager.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Aug. 13, about 40 citizens gathered at the town
hall and decided to fight. Afterward, Thomas M. Egan, an insurance
agent who is becoming a de facto leader vowed: ``We'll do whatever
we must do to stop him.'' The group sent a three-man delegation to
plead the preservationists' case with Kourakas on Friday, but he
was unmoved. ``He said there would be no change in his plans and no
delay, which means there's going to be a fight,'' Rich said.
</P>
<P>
   Kourakas, the 43-year-old head of Morgan Stanley's high-yield
capital markets group (which floats junk bonds), has told neighbors
that he is not the villain here. Over the years, the farmland
surrounding the keeper's house was graded and turned into housing
lots, the assistant keeper's house that figures in some paintings
was destroyed and the keeper's house was renovated and expanded
somewhat. His plan, he argued, reverses some alterations, restores
some gingerbread and puts part of the roof line back where it was
in Hopper's day.
</P>
<P>
   Kourakas' blueprints, however, also extend one side of the
building 12 feet, add 16 feet to another side, turn a three-bedroom
house into a six-bedroom one and install a garage with a connecting
walkway to the house. ``The scope is just untenable,'' Egan said.
</P>
<P>
   Gail Levin, the author of eight books on Hopper, including his
biography and catalog raisonne, agreed. ``It's a shame he is
altering this major historic landmark,'' she said of Kourakas. To
Hopper, she said, there was ``something quintessentially American''
about lighthouses, especially this one. ``He painted many
lighthouses, but there's none he painted more than the lighthouse
at Two Lights,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Two Lights also marked something of a turning point in the
artist's career. As Ms. Levin writes in ``Edward Hopper: An
Intimate Biography'' (Knopf, 1995/University of California Press,
1998), Hopper and his wife, Jo, discovered Two Lights in 1927.
Hopper had just sold ``Two on the Aisle,'' which shows a pair of
elegant women in a near-empty theater and is in the Toledo Museum
of Art, for $1,500, his highest price thus far. The couple used the
money to buy their first car and set out from Nyack, N.Y., for
Maine.
</P>
<P>
   At Two Lights, he painted ``Lighthouse Hill,'' an oil in the
Dallas Museum of Art, and ``Captain Upton's House,'' an oil owned
by the actor Steve Martin. Hopper also painted watercolors and oils
of other parts of the Coast Guard complex at Two Lights, and he
returned in 1929 to paint the view that the Met purchased in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Ms. Levin said, ``legions of minor artists'' have
drawn inspiration from Hopper's lighthouses. And Hopper, of course,
went on to glory. ``His images have become part of the very grain
and texture of American experience,'' wrote the critic Robert
Hughes in ``American Visions'' (Knopf, 1997), ``and even today, 30
years after his death, it's all but impossible to see America
without some refraction through them.''
</P>
<P>
   The champions of Two Lights fear they have too little time to
stop Kourakas and say they are irked because they learned of the
problem only on July 22, when The Portland Press Herald reported
that the notification had been filed six days earlier. ``We're
trying to mobilize public opinion to let people see what's at stake
here, that this debate is much more than someone trying to block a
neighbor's view,'' said Paul McDonald, a lawyer who lives near the
lighthouse.
</P>
<P>
   The Cape Elizabeth Historical Society is circulating a petition,
The Press Herald has written editorials opposing Kourakas' plans
and Martha Deprez, the executive director of Greater Portland
Landmarks, a nonprofit organization, said she returned from a
two-weeks vacation on Monday to ``all sorts of messages'' seeking
her help, which she will give.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Egan, Rich and others are calling Maine's
senators and state legislators to ask their aid, since both the
lighthouse and the keeper's cottage are on the National Register of
Historic Places.
</P>
<P>
   Hopper fans and preservationists are hoping an emergency town
council meeting scheduled for Wednesday night will give them more
time. Council members say they will try to impose a 45-day or
90-day moratorium on any work at Two Lights.

HOW TO TAME YOUR PUSHY ZUCCHINI: MAKE SOUP 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By BARBARA KAFKA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Zucchini is the vegetable that doesn't know when to stop. A
backyard zucchini crop at this time of year can grow from merely
abundant to brazen, overtaking the garden and leaving the gardener
with more zucchini than anyone could ever need.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not necessary to resort to sneaking out in the dead of
night and leaving baskets of the stuff anonymously on an unwary
neighbor's doorstep. This is a problem that calls for a creative
solution, and that solution is called soup.
</P>
<P>
   As I have been working with soups lately, I have found that
there are many pleasant alternatives to stock for the base, and
some of these take advantage of produce that is abundant right now.
</P>
<P>
   Bases made from watery vegetables, like tomatoes, cucumber and
zucchini, have fresh, attractive flavors, along with the added
benefit of making our vegetarian friends very happy. These bases
can be made now when the vegetables are plentiful and inexpensive,
and they can then be frozen, if desired.
</P>
<P>
   Making the Zucchini Puree Soup Base requires a minimal amount of
cooking on a hot, late summer day: just saute the zucchini until it
is tender, and then puree it.
</P>
<P>
   Made with unpeeled zucchini, the puree and the soups it is added
to will have more color and intense flavor, with a slight, pleasant
hint of bitterness. Made with peeled zucchini, the base and soups
will be paler and milder.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere between a salad and a soup is Zucchini Gazpacho, cool
and refreshing. For the fullest flavor, chill the gazpacho
overnight, and then add strips of another summer favorite, basil,
on top just before serving it.
</P>
<P>
   Chilled Zucchini and Parsley Soup is ridiculously easy to make
and low in calories. Vegetarians should note, however, that this
recipe does use chicken stock, which gives the soup a fuller
flavor. Low-fat cottage cheese adds just a bit of creamy texture to
the soup, and hot pepper sauce provides some zip.
</P>
<P>
   And though no one wants to think of winter right now, keep the
zucchini puree in mind as the base for heartier cold-weather soups
in the months to come. One of my favorites is a soothing Cabbage
Dill Soup that warms the soul.
</P>
<P>
   By the time I make this soup, concerns about an overflowing
zucchini garden will be long gone, and the vegetable's aroma will
conjure up only pleasant memories of these summer days. &QL;

`SIMPLE MENUS FOR THE BENTO BOX': TREASURE-CHEST DINING 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By AMANDA HESSER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In ``Simple Menus for the Bento Box'' (William Morrow, $25),
Ellen Greaves and Wayne Nish have created their own kind of
cooking. That is, food colored with Asian, French and American
influences and designed to be served Japanese-style in a bento box.
</P>
<P>
   This book is not a treatise arguing that bento box meals are
healthier, spiritually sound or will improve your life. The authors
simply appreciate the esthetic qualities of the bento box meal and
have adapted their style to its spatial parameters.
</P>
<P>
   A bento box is a lacquered wooden box with four small
compartments and was derived from a farmer's seed box. Earlier this
century, Japanese cooks began using it to make a bento, or boxed
meal, with a different dish in each compartment, like steamed fish,
sticky rice or fried vegetables. In Ms. Greaves and Nish's bento
boxes, however, you may be alternating bites of grilled ham and
cheese and herb-steamed swordfish.
</P>
<P>
   Their real emphasis is visual. The pictures, taken by Nish, who
is the chef at March in Manhattan, beautifully represent the
authors' minimalist style, which, they write, incorporates ``an
interactivity of line, shape and color.'' There are clear
directions on how to arrange each dish, making it easy for home
cooks to replicate. Steamed sticky rice, for instance, is wrapped
in plastic wrap, molded into disks and the edges pressed with
chopsticks to make a flower shape.
</P>
<P>
   The attention to presentation provides a pleasant departure from
cooking, piling food on a plate and eating. It has a way of slowing
down the meal. Or as Ms. Greaves, the chef at Tea Box in Manhattan,
and Nish write, ``Through your artful effort, you can transform the
simple bento box into a treasure chest for every person at your
table.'' That is overly optimistic, perhaps, but when I cooked a
bento meal from the book, my guests did take time to remark on the
food before digging in.
</P>
<P>
   The recipes are arranged into four-dish menus. And the one I
tried _ chicken nuggets with spicy cucumber, curried acorn squash
with pecans, Japanese rice with salted peanuts and scallions, and
poached shrimp with navy beans, celery and saffron _ was a big hit.
</P>
<P>
   Separate, the dishes had blunt, candid flavors; but together,
the meal was well balanced with sweetness, acidity and spice. The
recipes were easy and worked well, but they made more than
indicated. The four bento dishes, meant to serve four people,
easily fed five.
</P>
<P>
   This is the kind of book you would use to add a twist to a
casual dinner with friends, much in the way you might use a fondue
pot or make fajitas. And it's not a bad excuse to go shopping for
the small, elegant dishes and a few bento boxes.
</P>
<P>
   CHICKEN NUGGETS WITH SPICY CUCUMBER
</P>
<P>
   Adapted from ``Simple Menus for the Bento Box'' by Ellen Greaves
and Wayne Nish (William Morrow, $25)
</P>
<P>
   Time: 25 minutes
</P>
<P>
   1 seedless cucumber
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon Vietnamese chili paste or Tabasco, more to taste
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons champagne vinegar or white wine vinegar
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 quart peanut or canola oil
</P>
<P>
   1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast or thigh
</P>
<P>
   Flour for dusting
</P>
<P>
   2 eggs, lightly beaten
</P>
<P>
   1 cup panko or dried breadcrumbs, more if needed.
</P>
<P>
   1. Cut cucumber lengthwise into quarters. Cut quarters into
1/8-inch slices on an angle. In a medium bowl, combine cucumber,
chili paste and vinegar, and toss well. Season with salt, pepper
and chili paste. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   2. In a 2-quart saucepan, heat oil to 350 degrees. Cut chicken
into 1-inch cubes, and season with salt and pepper. Dredge chicken
cubes in flour, dip them in beaten egg and roll in the bread crumbs
to coat evenly. Add half the chicken to the oil, and fry until
crust is golden brown, about three minutes for breast meat, five
minutes for thigh. Using a slotted spoon, remove chicken from oil,
and drain on paper towels. Repeat with remaining chicken.
</P>
<P>
   3. In each of four small bowls, place a small tight mound of
cucumbers. Divide chicken nuggets among bowls, propping them
against cucumbers. Serve.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 6 small servings.

`YOUR FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS': WAR BETWEEN THE SEXES _ NO PRISONERS
TAKEN  
</HEADLINE>
  (Editors: production notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In its coolly unapologetic sexual fury, Neil LaBute's ``In the
Company of Men'' was such a hard act to follow that his second
film, ``Your Friends and Neighbors,'' is of automatic interest.
</P>
<P>
   Once again exploring a chasm of bitterness separating men and
women, how much further could this savagely articulate filmmaker
go? Expanding his dramatic focus to accommodate twice as many
characters, three men and three women, LaBute indeed matches his
first film's shock value at several junctures and keeps the bile
flowing freely. But inevitably this scorched-earth terrain is more
familiar the second time around.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike ``In the Company of Men,'' which was fearlessly cruel in
ways that took the breath away, LaBute's latest film strains harder
to achieve its sting. Its opening sequence, in which a sweaty,
preening stud (Jason Patric) rehearses his sexual technique as the
ultimate masturbatory exercise, certainly sets a high standard for
revealing nastiness. Then the film introduces a drama teacher,
played by Ben Stiller in Mephistophelian facial hair, who believes
that sex is all that matters in any form of human transaction. And
it goes on to add a new obscene phrase to an otherwise rich
lexicon: best friend.
</P>
<P>
   Three men obsessed with one another's sexual performance are at
the film's core, with Aaron Eckhardt playing the third member of
the trio. Eckhardt, who looked much sleeker then, played the
vengeful Romeo in LaBute's first film.
</P>
<P>
   But here he turns up as a mousy, impotent middle-aged husband,
the kind of man who asks his wife (Amy Brenneman) whether he should
wear the loden or salmon shirt that day. United with her in a state
of sexually unsatisfying union, he finds himself playing host to an
equally uneasy couple:
</P>
<P>
   Stiller's character and the acerbic writer played by Catherine
Keener. The camera watches as each couple shares a miserable sexual
interlude before they all meet.
</P>
<P>
   The film's characters have no stated names, but that hardly
makes them unfamiliar. LaBute clearly means to present the
universal aspects of their hostility and their betrayals. So
Stiller is seen making a secret pass at Ms. Brenneman while
admiring the new home that she shares with his buddy.
</P>
<P>
   And in a dinner table conversation involving the gift of a
broken wristwatch, LaBute's screenplay consciously exposes all the
lying, sniping and self-deception that defines the speakers'
essential natures. The painting by Alex Katz that is incorporated
into the film's credits hauntingly compounds the sense of social
disjunction throughout the story.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your Friends and Neighbors'' is often so blunt or unrelievedly
talky and dark that it cries out for the velvet glove of
``Manhattan,'' a much more seductive film about sexual opportunism
and urbane cruelty. Yet even when LaBute's material feels mannered
(there are careful repetitions and symmetries) or unremittingly
sour, it sustains a psychic ferocity that commands attention. The
web of lies, failures and brutal revelations here is strong stuff,
and it's the work of an original filmmaker who takes no prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   When Patric, who is one of the film's two producers, turns up as
a macho gynecologist who treats an anatomical baby model like a
football, and who screams about the thread count of his sheets to a
sexual conquest who's gotten blood on them, it's clear that LaBute
is still ready to go for the jugular on every possible occasion.
</P>
<P>
   After all, these film's characters obsessively rate and boast
about their best sexual experiences _ and for one man, the zenith
turns out to be having committed homosexual gang-rape in a high
school locker room.
</P>
<P>
   The cast, photographed with deliberate warts-and-all harshness
by a mostly stationary camera, has the gutsy unself-consciousness
to make much of this angry material work. Catherine Keener, a queen
of independent film for her tart, funny work in Tom DiCillo's films
and ``Walking and Talking,'' establishes that LaBute can create
women as shrewd and poisonous as his men. As the beauty who works
in an art gallery and fields passes by most of the film's other
characters, Nastassja Kinski hints at what it means to be prize and
victim in these sexual wars.
</P>
<P>
   Stiller, who can bring so much sneaky allure to playing
unappealing characters, embodies many of the filmmaker's most
misanthropic notions, sharing with Patric and Eckhardt a physical
brutishness that turns sexual swagger into something monstrous. In
the end, these characters are devastatingly true to LaBute's idea
of self-annihilating manhood. They're hard to watch and even harder
to forget.
</P>

<P>
   CAPE ELIZABETH, Maine _ Even on a warm, sunny August day, the
view of Two Lights Lighthouse here is, well, Hopperesque. Scenic
but somehow forlorn, frozen in a long-ago time, the lighthouse
evokes the sense of isolation inherent in so many classic Edward
Hopper paintings. Little wonder that ``Lighthouse at Two Lights,''
one of three major paintings and several watercolors he made of the
scene, hangs in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, was made into a
popular museum poster and is pictured on the 1970 6-cent postage
stamp marking Maine's sesquicentennial as a state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two Lights was a symbol of the solitary individual that faced
isolation in the industrial world,'' says Barbara Haskell, a
curator at the Whitney Museum of American Art, which owns two of
the watercolors (and the Hopper estate). ``It was also symbolic of
the vulnerability of that way of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Hopper was indeed prophetic. The Coast Guard automated the
beacon at Two Lights years ago and now, some 70 years after Hopper
painted a scene that became an icon of American art, the white,
gingerbread-trimmed keeper's cottage in it is facing a big change.
The owner plans to expand the house by about a third and add a
two-car garage. Neighbors are horrified.
</P>
<P>
   Workers are scheduled to begin demolishing part of the cottage,
which was built in 1873, on Sept. 8 and, here in Down East Yankee
country, there is little anyone can do legally to stop the owner,
William J. Kourakas Jr., a hometown boy who now works on Wall
Street, lives in Greenwich, Conn., and uses the house as a
year-round retreat.
</P>
<P>
   Kourakas, who bought the keeper's quarters in 1995, declined to
comment for publication, but he has told neighbors that the house
has already been altered and is no longer what Hopper painted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people around here are up in arms,'' said John Rich Jr., a
retired newspaper and television journalist whose front yard looks
out on the view in the Met's painting and who, as a 10-year-old,
witnessed Hopper painting it.
</P>
<P>
   Town residents are rueful, at least partly because their lack of
power is their own fault. When the town council of Cape Elizabeth,
a hamlet about 10 miles southeast of Portland, considered
safeguarding historic buildings in recent years, it sided with
private property rights over mandated preservation. An ordinance
passed last year simply requires anyone embarking on demolition or
construction of a landmark to give 45 days' notice to the town and
to the Maine Historic Preservation Commission. ``That ties my
hands,'' said Michael K. McGovern, the town manager.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Aug. 13, about 40 citizens gathered at the town
hall and decided to fight. Afterward, Thomas M. Egan, an insurance
agent who is becoming a de facto leader vowed: ``We'll do whatever
we must do to stop him.'' The group sent a three-man delegation to
plead the preservationists' case with Kourakas on Friday, but he
was unmoved. ``He said there would be no change in his plans and no
delay, which means there's going to be a fight,'' Rich said.
</P>
<P>
   Kourakas, the 43-year-old head of Morgan Stanley's high-yield
capital markets group (which floats junk bonds), has told neighbors
that he is not the villain here. Over the years, the farmland
surrounding the keeper's house was graded and turned into housing
lots, the assistant keeper's house that figures in some paintings
was destroyed and the keeper's house was renovated and expanded
somewhat. His plan, he argued, reverses some alterations, restores
some gingerbread and puts part of the roof line back where it was
in Hopper's day.
</P>
<P>
   Kourakas' blueprints, however, also extend one side of the
building 12 feet, add 16 feet to another side, turn a three-bedroom
house into a six-bedroom one and install a garage with a connecting
walkway to the house. ``The scope is just untenable,'' Egan said.
</P>
<P>
   Gail Levin, the author of eight books on Hopper, including his
biography and catalog raisonne, agreed. ``It's a shame he is
altering this major historic landmark,'' she said of Kourakas. To
Hopper, she said, there was ``something quintessentially American''
about lighthouses, especially this one. ``He painted many
lighthouses, but there's none he painted more than the lighthouse
at Two Lights,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Two Lights also marked something of a turning point in the
artist's career. As Ms. Levin writes in ``Edward Hopper: An
Intimate Biography'' (Knopf, 1995/University of California Press,
1998), Hopper and his wife, Jo, discovered Two Lights in 1927.
Hopper had just sold ``Two on the Aisle,'' which shows a pair of
elegant women in a near-empty theater and is in the Toledo Museum
of Art, for $1,500, his highest price thus far. The couple used the
money to buy their first car and set out from Nyack, N.Y., for
Maine.
</P>
<P>
   At Two Lights, he painted ``Lighthouse Hill,'' an oil in the
Dallas Museum of Art, and ``Captain Upton's House,'' an oil owned
by the actor Steve Martin. Hopper also painted watercolors and oils
of other parts of the Coast Guard complex at Two Lights, and he
returned in 1929 to paint the view that the Met purchased in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Ms. Levin said, ``legions of minor artists'' have
drawn inspiration from Hopper's lighthouses. And Hopper, of course,
went on to glory. ``His images have become part of the very grain
and texture of American experience,'' wrote the critic Robert
Hughes in ``American Visions'' (Knopf, 1997), ``and even today, 30
years after his death, it's all but impossible to see America
without some refraction through them.''
</P>
<P>
   The champions of Two Lights fear they have too little time to
stop Kourakas and say they are irked because they learned of the
problem only on July 22, when The Portland Press Herald reported
that the notification had been filed six days earlier. ``We're
trying to mobilize public opinion to let people see what's at stake
here, that this debate is much more than someone trying to block a
neighbor's view,'' said Paul McDonald, a lawyer who lives near the
lighthouse.
</P>
<P>
   The Cape Elizabeth Historical Society is circulating a petition,
The Press Herald has written editorials opposing Kourakas' plans
and Martha Deprez, the executive director of Greater Portland
Landmarks, a nonprofit organization, said she returned from a
two-weeks vacation on Monday to ``all sorts of messages'' seeking
her help, which she will give.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Egan, Rich and others are calling Maine's
senators and state legislators to ask their aid, since both the
lighthouse and the keeper's cottage are on the National Register of
Historic Places.
</P>
<P>
   Hopper fans and preservationists are hoping an emergency town
council meeting scheduled for Wednesday night will give them more
time. Council members say they will try to impose a 45-day or
90-day moratorium on any work at Two Lights.

<P>
   With the exception of Richard Nixon's televised resignation
announcement on another August night 24 years ago, Bill Clinton's
Monday night confession was the most unsettling and pathetic
presidential address I've witnessed in my lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   He is a liar.
</P>
<P>
   A cheat.
</P>
<P>
   A conniver.
</P>
<P>
   A manipulator.
</P>
<P>
   And we love him.
</P>
<P>
   Whether you're dancing the dance of vindicated Clinton-bashers
today or weeping tears of disappointment because your dreams of
Camelot II have been forever tarnished, it really won't affect the
business of the country. The reality is, we have a pathological
liar in the White House _ and yet the great majority of the
citizenry doesn't mind because he's leading the country through
some of the most peaceful and prosperous times in our nation's
history.
</P>
<P>
   There will be no impeachment proceedings, no criminal
indictments, no resignation. Bill Clinton will finish his second
term and he'll have a prosperous post-presidency: sitting on the
boards of various companies; writing books; giving speeches at
$100,000 a pop; advising other presidents; maybe even pitching in
to build a house or two with Jimmy Carter.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing _ nothing _ Clinton can do will erase the word
``philandering'' from the first paragraph of his obituary. And that
of course is no one's fault but his own.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Approximately three seconds after Clinton finished speaking
Monday night, I received a call from a female friend who's about
the same age as Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``That Clinton is so [goshdarn] sexy!'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   I think she was kidding.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Can you believe that sign-off from Clinton? He sounded exactly
like Johnny Carson!
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you for watching, and good night,'' said the president.
</P>
<P>
   You almost expected to see him stand up and shake hands with the
producer as the band kicked in with some melancholy goodbye music.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Whether he's delivering a heartfelt tribute to the Americans who
were killed in the embassy bombings or confessing an extramarital
dalliance on live prime-time TV, Clinton is astonishingly assured
and polished _ rarely if ever stumbling on a line or committing any
sort of verbal misstep.
</P>
<P>
   There's something amiss in a world in which Academy
Award-winning actors can't give acceptance speeches without
screwing up every other line, while the president of the United
States is a one-take wonder.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Best line I heard from the hours of pre-game talk spread across
the dial came from Bob Woodward of the Washington Post, who
interrupted the hyperkinetic James Carville on ``Larry King Live''
and said, ``Let me ask you a question that will serve as a Valium
of sorts ...''
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Every so often I'm asked why I've never wanted to work in
Washington, considered by many journalists to be the ultimate
career destination.
</P>
<P>
   My reasons are myriad. But from now on when that question is
posed, I'm going to refer to the following verbatim transcript from
Monday morning's press conference with White House spokesman Mike
McCurry.
</P>
<P>
   Q. If the president makes a speech tonight, will the first lady
and Chelsea be with him?
</P>
<P>
   McCurry: As I've said earlier, I haven't heard any plans to that
effect.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Will they be sitting there if he's talking about oral sex,
for instance? That would be embarrassing for them.
</P>
<P>
   McCurry: I think it's embarrassing to hear the question posed
here.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Well, it's embarrassing to have the accusation on the record.
</P>
<P>
   McCurry: Anything else?
</P>
<P>
   Q. Russia?
</P>
<P>
   McCurry: OK, let's do Russia . . .
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Presidents who, according to most historians, fooled around:
Jefferson, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Kennedy and Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Presidents, who, according to most historians, didn't fool
around: Hoover, Nixon, Ford and Carter.
</P>
<P>
   I guess job performance really is separate from other types of
performance.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You had to love all those live shots of the White House we saw
Monday during the wall-to-wall coverage on the 24-hour news
channels. There were so many lingering shots of the White House
that I half-expected it to blow up a la ``Independence Day.''
</P>
<P>
   The only thing more entertaining than the live shots of
buildings are those arrival-departure deals, covered with a
breathless anticipation that used to be reserved for Apollo
flights. Yep, there's nothing more thrilling than watching a
newsmaker entering or exiting a nondescript sedan and ignoring the
throngs of reporters who are shouting questions like ``What are you
going to say in court?'' and ``Who did your hair?''
</P>
<P>
   Just once I'd like to see someone pull up in a Humvee, or maybe
a Chevy Blazer equipped with a $25,000 stereo system blaring out
the latest from the Wu Tang Clan. For variety's sake.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We keep hearing about ``improper'' or ``inappropriate'' sexual
relations between Clinton and Lewinsky. Just wonder: What would
constitute ``proper'' or ``appropriate'' relationships between the
wo? Signed notes of consent from her mother and his wife?
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In another example of actual developments far outstripping
anything imagined in recent political satires such as ``Primary
Colors,'' ``Wag the Dog'' and ``Bulworth,'' the Clintons' minister
was seen on TV this weekend, comparing our president to one of the
great Old Testament figures.
</P>
<P>
   From the Rev. J. Philip Wogaman: ``King David did something that
was much worse (arranging the death of his lover Bathsheba's
husband) than anything that President Clinton is alleged to have
done. And King David, if I read my Bible correctly, was not
impeached.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, he didn't have an intern program, either.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I don't know where Gennifer Flowers, Paula Jones, Kathleen
Willey, Lucianne Goldberg or Linda Tripp were Monday night, but
something tells me at least some of them must have had trouble
seeing the TV screen, what with all the champagne bottles that must
have been uncorked.

 &HT;    KING OF MEXICAN KIDNAPPERS, KNOWN AS THE 'EAR CUTTER,' IS
CAPTURED
 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS 
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ He is Mexico's most notorious suspected criminal,
a former cop and car thief who graduated to kidnapping -- and made
millions by slicing off his victims' ears and mailing them to
families to let them know he meant business.
</P>
<P>
   But now Daniel Arizmendi, known as Mexico's infamous ``ear
cutter,'' is in custody, judicial authorities announced here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a day of bad luck,'' Arizmendi told Mexico's Television
Azteca, as he was being transported to a maximum-security jail in
Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   Arizmendi's capture late Monday evening north of Mexico City is
the culmination of an intensive nine-month manhunt for a criminal
who came to symbolize cruelty, corruption and ineptitude on the
part of Mexican authorities.
</P>
<P>
   His capture represents ``a great effort in the fight against
impunity,'' said Samuel Gonzalez, federal director of Mexico's
organized crime unit.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez celebrated Arizmendi's downfall in a press conference
Tuesday in Mexico City with Jorge Madrazo, Mexico's Attorney
General.
</P>
<P>
   Madrazo said the arrest was made possible with the help of
Mexico's Law Against Organized Crime, which offered guarantees of
witness protection and gave several judges the power to authorize
extensive wire-taps of private telephone conversations among
suspects.
</P>
<P>
   Kidnapping has become a virtual industry in Mexico in recent
years, second only to Colombia in magnitude. Arizmendi and his
network of family and friends -- including his wife, a former nurse
who may have supervised the severing of victims' ears -- were
considered among the most brutal and successful in their field.
</P>
<P>
   Police have linked Arizmendi's gang to as many as 200
kidnappings, some of which resulted in killings. In June, police
seized more than $5 million in pesos and U.S. dollars from the
family, as well as more than two dozen homes and radio equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The 40-year-old Arizmendi, reportedly a former police officer in
Morelos state south of Mexico City, narrowly escaped capture during
a raid in May that netted his eldest son and his wife.
</P>
<P>
   On June 30, Daniel's brother, Aurelio, was wounded and captured
after police who were trailing him closed in and engaged him in a
shoot-out.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, a man reported to be Arizmendi's lawyer, Jose Angel
Vivanco -- a former Judicial Police commander -- was recently
arrested. Newspapers published a photo they obtained of Vivanco
posing with Arizmendi in a macho stance while holding automatic
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Mexicans are particularly outraged at reports of the widespread
police protection that Arizmendi enjoyed in various Mexican states.
Putting cops on his payroll gave Arizmendi critical support that
helped him elude justice while amassing as much as $40 million in
ransom money.
</P>
<P>
   The former chief of an anti-kidnapping unit in the state of
Morelos has also been arrested and is suspected of assisting
Arizmendi.
</P>
<P>
   When Arizmendi was captured Monday in Nacaulpan, a district in
the state of Mexico, police also detained 10 adults who are
suspected accomplices along with six minors.
</P>
<P>
   Madrazo said authorities have learned that the son of a
well-known businessman, Raul Nieto del Rio, was killed Aug. 6
during an attempt by the Arizmendi gang to kidnap him on a highway.
</P>
<P>
   Although they had killed their victim, gang members were
pretending Nieto del Rio was still alive and they were attempting
to collect $15 million in ransom from the family, Madrazo said.
</P>
<P>
   A man who claimed to be Arizmendi recently called Reforma
newspaper in Mexico City and gave detailed accounts of his
kidnappings and the gruesome practice of severing victims' ears.
</P>
<P>
   In published reports, the man claiming to be the kidnapper said
he was addicted to the money he earned through his bloody
enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that he feared ``jail and poverty,'' but not death.

   WASHINGTON
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-MAIN _ After his defiant nationally televised plea to
independent counsel Ken Starr to stop ``prying into personal
lives,'' President Clinton Tuesday began what is likely to be his
last campaign _ to save his embattled presidency by getting enough
credibility and traction with his party and the public in hopes of
being able to govern. Delaying his scheduled departure for a
Martha's Vineyard vacation, Clinton spent the morning on the
telephone in an attempt to shore up his Democratic Party base. It's
likely to be the first of many salvage operations. (Glass, Cox News
Service).
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-PRIVACY _ WASHINGTON _ Aside from whether he can restore
his credibility, President Clinton's televised appeal to end the
``prying'' into his private life no doubt struck a chord with many
Americans who feel the government and private industry have gone
too far in delving into things that used to be purely personal
matters. (Dart, Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-CENSURE _ Between the James Carvilles and Bob Barrs, a
growing number of people in Washington are looking for a middle
ground, a way of resolving this mess that is neither vindication
nor impeachment. Censure offers such a way and we look at those
calling for it and how it would work. (Sherman, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-PRIVATE _ Discussion of when the private becomes public.
Talking to those with experience: Barney Frank, Gary Hart, Bob
Packwood, Mike Bowers, Jim Bakker, Jimmy Swaggart. (Manuel, Atlanta

   CLINTON-JACKSON _ In light of their midnight meeting after the
speech, is there more to do on the relationship between Jackson and
the Clintons? This might be where we can also deal more with
Chelsea and Hillary if there isn't enough to do a separate story.

   ISRAEL-MIRABILIS _ JERUSALEM _ With recent software deals
pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into Israeli companies, the
new celebrities here are no longer army generals or politicians,
but high school dropouts. In June, America Online announced that it
bought Tel Aviv-based Mirabilis Ltd. for $287 million in cash and
up to another $120 million based on future growth. The two-year-old
company invented ICQ, an Internet chat service with more than 14
million users. Ninety percent of the money goes to its four
twenty-something founders _ two of whom never made it through 12th
grade _ and one of their parents. But, Mirabilis was topped _ in
dollars if not in cult fame _ last week when the more conventional
software company, Memco, was bought for $412 million in stock by
Illinois-based Platinum Technology. Memco makes software for
securing information stored on Internet servers. The two deals
highlight the growing Israeli software industry, where companies
are making their marks as acquisition targets or niche providers.

   MEXICO-KIDNAPPER _ MEXICO CITY _ Mexican judicial authorities

the notorious Daniel Arizmendi, infamous for cutting off his

Arizmendi is said to have led a family-run network of kidnappers
and money launderers, who collected millions of dollars in ransom
and enjoyed the protection of corrupt police. Mexico's Attorney
General said Arizmendi was captured after an intensive mine-month
campaign that included wire taps and witness protection to gain

 &HT;    CLINTON'S COMPLAINT ABOUT INVASION OF HIS PRIVACY STRIKES A
CHORD WITH MANY AMERICANS
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ By calling for a halt to ``prying into personal
lives'' in his address to the nation, President Clinton may have
struck a carefully chosen chord with a populace increasingly fed up
with invasions of their privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show Americans are increasingly tired of intrusions of all
kinds _ everything from telemarketing calls during dinner to
unwanted e-mail. And they're fearful that computers and the
Internet have provided prying eyes an easy look at formerly private
aspects of their lives _ from medical and financial records to
their phone logs and purchasing preferences.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are feeling there is no such thing as privacy in this
era of computers and credit card numbers,'' said Martin Pollner, a
former Treasury Department official who currently deals with
privacy issues as an attorney in New York City. ``I think the
president touched upon a raw nerve'' by demanding an end to
investigation of his private life.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the prying into Clinton's personal life stems from what
the president acknowledged Monday night in his nationally-televised
address as an ``inappropriate'' relationship with former White
House intern Monica Lewinsky. Independent counsel Kenneth Starr has
delved into such highly-sensitive areas as Clinton's sex life in an
attempt to determine whether the president committed perjury or
obstructed justice.
</P>
<P>
   After admitting to an improper relationship with Lewinsky,
Clinton said it was now a family matter and no longer a concern to
Starr.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is private and I intend to reclaim my family life for my
family. It's nobody's business but ours,'' Clinton said. ``Even
presidents have private lives. It is time to stop the pursuit of
personal destruction and the prying into personal lives and get on
with our national life.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, presidents are public figures and subject to a
different degree of scrutiny than private citizens. But some
experts say Clinton's plea to be left alone resonates with those
who face much less traumatic intrusions on a daily basis.
</P>
<P>
   Karlyn Bowman, who studies public opinion for the American
Enterprise Institute, said the ``stop the prying'' segment was one
of several parts of a speech that appeared crafted to conform with
polling data. Bringing up the cost of Starr's investigation and
emphasizing the need to ``move on'' were others, she said.
</P>
<P>
   On the privacy issue, a June national poll of adults from 1,014
households, sponsored by Ohio University and Scripps Howard News
Service found that 81 percent of the respondents doubted the
security of their personal information including credit ratings,
medical histories and financial records.
</P>
<P>
   ``Polls show people don't want the media delving too deeply into
private lives of not just this president but other public
officials,'' said Bowman. ``Interestingly, most people say they
don't want to know this personal kind of information but they think
their neighbors do.''
</P>
<P>
   Ari Schwartz, policy analyst for the non-profit Center for
Democracy and Technology, a Washington-based advocacy group
concerned with Internet issues, said the Clinton administration
``has has been focusing on privacy already. They know it's a
popular issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore last month endorsed an Electronic Bill of
Rights and told the audience that ``You should have the right to
choose whether your personal information is disclosed.''
</P>
<P>
   Surveys show that concerns about privacy are the number one
reason that people stay off the Internet and also the number one
worry of people on the Internet, said Schwartz.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's message on privacy ``probably had a receptive
audience,'' said Harold Krent, a professor at Kent College of Law
in Chicago and author of an article titled ``Diaries and
Databases'' that deals with privacy issues. ``People do recognize
that there should be a realm of self that is protected from prying
eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Just giving Starr a drop of blood to test for DNA material in
the semen alleged to have been on Lewinsky's dress, said Krent,
would have enabled investigators to find out all sorts of unrelated
genetic information about him.
</P>
<P>
   However, others doubted the effectiveness of Clinton's plea on
prying.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Clinton is hoping to tap into some nationwide passion for
privacy, I don't think it's there,'' said Robert Ellis Smith, a
Rhode Island attorney who publishes the ``Privacy Journal''
newsletter and wrote the book ``Our Vanishing Privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans are ambivalent about privacy,'' said Smith. ``The
polls show concern on a superficial level but if you scratch the
surface'' many people ``still think you have something to hide'' if
you raise privacy issues in a criminal case.

`ACHESON': A CLEAR-EYED SHAPER OF THE POSTWAR ERA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn.)   (Editors: publication notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The year was 1950, and Washington, caught up in the terrors of
McCarthyism, was not a generous or forgiving place. Alger Hiss, a
former State Department official who denied furnishing official
documents to the Soviet Union, had been convicted of perjury
because of that denial, and his former senior colleague, Dean
Acheson, had publicly announced that he would not turn his back on
the convicted man. Acheson was brought before a Senate committee to
``clarify'' his statement about Hiss, and he had this to say:
</P>
<P>
   ``The safe course is to avoid situations which are disagreeable
and dangerous. Such a course might get one by the issue of the
moment, but it has bitter and evil consequences. In the long days
and years which stretch beyond that moment of decision, one must
live with one's self. . . . It is not merely a question of peace of
mind, although that is vital; it is a matter of integrity of
character.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever you might think about Acheson's reluctance to turn
publicly against Hiss, his statement before the censorious senators
has a marvelously square, almost fusty kind of rectitude about it.
It seems to come from a different age. But James Chace's theory in
this sure-handed and readable biography of Dean Acheson, secretary
of state from 1949 to 1953, is that Acheson forged the
international order as we know it today, even if by now he seems,
stylistically and rhetorically, to be no longer a part of it.
</P>
<P>
   Chace, a former editor of Foreign Affairs who now teaches at
Bard College, has written a biography that also provides a useful,
clear history of the major events of the postwar world that Acheson
helped to shape _ from the creation of the Bretton Woods
international monetary system and of NATO to the decision to wage
the Korean War in 1950.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a book of startling new insights or challenges to
the accepted wisdom about a period of time that has been much
written about by numerous previous authors and memoirists,
including Acheson himself. But, like Acheson, Chace is a man of
good judgment and broad knowledge. His focus on Acheson provides a
clear window on the problems the United States faced in the postwar
world and the reasoning behind the decisions that were made.
</P>
<P>
   Acheson, despite his starched, upper-crust image, was, as Chace
puts it, ``not an American patrician.'' He was born in Middletown,
Conn., in 1893. His father was an Episcopal clergyman of a
nonconformist but detached disposition; his warmer mother came from
a prosperous family of English millers and distillers.
</P>
<P>
   While not patricians, the Achesons were the kind of New England
Protestants who could send their sons to Yale and Harvard Law
School, which Dean Acheson attended, even if he did graduate at the
bottom of his class at preparatory school, Groton. Acheson served
as a law clerk for Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis; spent a
few prosperous years in the law firm of Covington &AMP; Burling and,
when Franklin D. Roosevelt became president in 1933, began his long
career in government as undersecretary of the Treasury.
</P>
<P>
   When war broke out in Europe in 1939, Acheson quickly became
``fully and openly committed to the cause of aiding the Allies.''
He showed, in other words, the flexible common sense that would
guide him later when he became an architect of U.S. foreign policy.
He seems instinctively to have understood, as Chace puts it, ``that
the United States would have to learn new ways of exercising power,
both in the present conflict and in the postwar world.''
</P>
<P>
   When the postwar world did come, Acheson was at first
accommodationist toward the Soviet Union. He favored sharing the
secret of atomic energy (though not the actual engineering know-how
associated with that secret) with the Russians, believing that to
do otherwise would provide ``unanswerable evidence of an
Anglo-American combination against them.''
</P>
<P>
   But Acheson altered his view of the Soviets, turning from
moderate softness toward moderate hardness. The major event in the
transformation, in Chace's account, was the clumsy Soviet effort in
1946 to intimidate Turkey into effectively turning over control of
the Bosporus to Moscow. Acheson, Chace writes, played an eloquent
role at a crucial meeting with President Harry Truman, arguing the
case for an assertive U.S. role in combating what Acheson had come
to see as a threat to freedom everywhere. He was, in short, an
architect of containment, a pioneering strategist of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   As secretary of state, Acheson, in Chace's approving portrait,
struggled to steer a course among distracting impulses:
isolationism, anti-communist hysteria, the intrusions of domestic
politics. In late 1950, after the devastating Chinese intervention
in Korea, Republicans in the Senate and the House passed
resolutions to the effect that ``Acheson had lost the confidence of
the country and should be removed from office.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the attacks, Chace describes Acheson whistling
cheerfully to himself as he listened to the daily radio diatribes
again him. When John Carter Vincent, one of the State Department
experts wrongly accused of having ``lost'' China, came under fire
from Truman's Loyalty Review Board, Acheson wrote to the president,
defending him. It was not Vincent's job, he said, ``merely to
report success of existing policy but also to report on the aspects
in which it was failing and the reasons therefor.''
</P>
<P>
   As Chace covers this ground, brushes in only a few brief
passages on Acheson's personal life, his marriage, his children,
his love of woodworking. This is a book about public life, and
particularly about a figure of clear vision and strong character
who managed to support mostly the right policies when other
policies were being proposed. One can't help coming away from
reading this book feeling that Americans were lucky to have had
Acheson around when they needed him.

   On Tuesday, midday temperatures hovered near 60 degrees across
upstate New York as a chilly air mass swept into the region behind
a cold front. Wednesday, this push of cool air will advance
southeast to coastal New England and the northern Middle Atlantic
states. Despite abundant sunshine, afternoon readings should hold
in the 70s from Philadelphia to Boston. It will be even cooler over
the interior Northeast where a patchwork of puffy cumulus clouds
shades the sun at times.
</P>
<P>
   Scattered thunderstorms will erupt over the Carolinas on
Wednesday as a wedge of cool air advancing southward lifts humid
air in place over the region. Meanwhile, partly to mostly sunny
skies will cover the remainder of the Southeast. Isolated
thunderstorms will form in the sultry air.
</P>
<P>
   A large cluster of showers and heavy thunderstorms, fueled by a
flow of humid air from the Gulf of Mexico, will affect portions of
the upper Middle West on Wednesday morning. The cluster will tend
to dissipate by late morning. Additional strong to severe storms
will ignite over the northern Plains and Mississippi Valley on
Wednesday afternoon as a disturbance passes along the U.S.-Canada
border.
</P>
<P>
   Clouds and spotty thunderstorms will continue to temper the heat
across Texas and New Mexico. Farther north, however, afternoon
temperatures will soar past 100 degrees in parts of western Kansas
as a formidable high pressure system strengthens aloft.
</P>
<P>
   Dry and seasonable conditions will cover the Pacific Coast while
isolated thunderstorms occur in the mountains of the interior West.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: The Real Season
</P>
<P>
   There is a hurricane season within the hurricane season. For the
Atlantic basin, the official hurricane season spans from June 1
through November 30. Statistically, however, most hurricanes occur
between August 20 and October 20, the time corresponding to the
climatological crest in tropical sea-surface temperatures
(hurricanes derive energy from warm tropical seas). In Florida, for
example, 36 out of the 40 hurricanes that have struck the state
made landfall during this period, including all 17 of the major
hurricanes. A major hurricane harbors sustained winds of 110 mph or
greater.

BRUINS WILL PAY KHRISTICH $1.95 MILLION

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ As expected, the Bruins have decided not to cut Dmitri
Khristich loose as a free agent and will pay him the $1.95 million
he was awarded last week in arbitration.
</P>
<P>
   ``The arbitration process is not an easy one for either the team
or the player,'' said Bruins president-general manager Harry
Sinden, who was part of the Delaware North strategy team that met
Tuesday to prepare the company's bid for the National Football
League's expansion franchise in Cleveland. ``When the decision came
down, it was only prudent on our part to evaluate whether to accept
the award. We feel that the arbitrator was fair and that we can
accept the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look forward to having Dmitri back in uniform and
contributing this season.''
</P>
<P>
   It remains the Bruins' right, of course, to trade the
29-year-old Khristich any time before the March 1999 trading
deadline. But on a team with fragile scoring confidence,
Khristich's kind of offensive punch _ 29 goals and 66 points last
season _ can't easily be deleted from the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins were hoping to pay Khristich about $1.4 million, and
he was looking for some $2.8 million. Arbitrator Claude Foisy
essentially split the difference, and Khristich now will stay put,
almost ensuring that he'll be back in arbitration again next year.
</P>
<P>
   If the Bruins had exercised their right to ``walk away'' from
Foisy's ruling _ they had until Thursday morning to decide _ he
immediately would have been declared a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant GM Mike O'Connell said Monday following netminder Rob
Tallas's arbitration award ($625,000) that the club will refocus on
signing Group 2 free agents Kyle McLaren and Jason Allison.
</P>
<P>
   Just before July 1, McLaren and Allison both were offered the
minimum 10 percent increase over their 1997-98 salaries, figures
that neither accepted. In the last seven weeks, Allison's agent,
Bob Gerow, has returned with a counterproposal for his client, one
that O'Connell said the club will respond to imminently. O'Connell
said he has not heard from McLaren's representatives, the Messier
family (the father, brother, and sister of Canucks center Mark
Messier).

<P>
   KAKULU, Uganda _ This village is really just a muddy patch of
ground in the tall trees near where the Nile flows out of Lake
Victoria. The men work on coffee plantations. The women bear
children, fetch water from the well about a mile away and cultivate
cassava, potatoes and bananas.
</P>
<P>
   There is no running water, no electricity, no telephone. When
the long rains come each year, they wash out the dirt road for
weeks at a time. This is _ and has always been _ a place where
people who reach the age of 50 are old, and those who have seen a
doctor or swallowed a pill are rare.
</P>
<P>
   The basic rules of public health are clear in Kakulu: only drink
water from the well, not from the polluted Nile; and breastfeeding
is the best way to nourish an infant.
</P>
<P>
   At least those were the rules until a few weeks ago, when the
United Nations, struggling desperately to find a way to cope with
Africa's AIDS epidemic, took a giant step toward reversing them.
</P>
<P>
   After long deliberation, U.N. AIDS officials announced that
women infected with HIV should consider feeding formula instead of
breast milk to their babies.
</P>
<P>
   Even discussing such a fundamental shift in public health policy
has been agonizing for people who once staged protests in the
United States and Western Europe warning using infant formula in
the Third World _ where dirty water is often lethal _ would kill
thousands of children each year.
</P>
<P>
   Switching to formula would affect the basic behavior of millions
of women, and in theory at least, it makes sense. Three million
children have died from AIDS since the epidemic began, and last
year alone there were more than 600,000 new cases among babies,
many of whom received the virus from the milk in their mother's
breast. Had they been drinking uncontaminated formula instead _ or
had their mothers taken a short course of AZT to protect them just
before delivery _ more than a third might have been saved.
</P>
<P>
   But here, where theory quickly fades into the harsh reality of
the jungle, the math never seems to add up the right way. In
African villages there is no debate between breast and bottle and
no talk of using a drug like AZT.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, there has been a simple discussion about who will live
and who will die. Scarce funds make drug treatments that have
become routine in the United States almost impossible to
contemplate here. So people infected with the virus die, and
usually they die quickly. That makes prevention the only hope for
this continent _ where 30 million people have already been infected
and 10 million have died.
</P>
<P>
   Feeding formula to babies whose mothers have HIV could save tens
of thousands of children each year. So could providing a short
course of AZT, which prevents the AIDS virus from multiplying
rapidly in cells, to a woman in her final stages of pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   It may sound simple. But nothing about AIDS here ever is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would never be able to feed my baby with formula,'' said
Margaret Birungi Nannyongoi, a slightly overwhelmed 20-year-old
woman who sat on the mud floor of her home, nursing her three-day
old child, Dorothy Nalule.
</P>
<P>
   Dorothy is her third daughter - the first died, the next is a
listless, underweight two-year-old with flat, black eyes and a
constant cough. Dorothy, frail and pretty in a tiny cotton baby
dress, was delivered with the help of friends, on the only mattress
in the house.
</P>
<P>
   Like at least 95 percent of Uganda's village women, Mrs.
Nannyongoi has no idea whether she is infected with HIV. She has
never had prenatal care, nor has she ever taken a blood test. She
only knows about HIV because it killed two of her brothers. The
cost of formula for one child _ when it's available in Uganda and
when there is clean water to mix with it _ is on average 1.5 times
what a village family earns each year. Mrs. Nannyongoi said she has
never seen anyone use it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems so difficult to handle,'' she said, after hearing
what is necessary to keep formula safe for babies. ``How would I
have the time?'' She is currently feeding her baby 10 times a day,
and each of those days is filled with essential chores.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the formula were donated and delivered to her home, as
U.N. officials hope it would be, she says it would be difficult to
find a way to fetch the water, boil it and prepare the meals for
her infant while also working in the garden and cooking for her
husband, herself and her other daughter.
</P>
<P>
   But when she was asked if she would use formula if it meant
giving her child a better start in life, she said yes.
</P>
<P>
   That's because formula holds promise _ unfortunately its a
promise that is rarely realized in this part of the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh sure, it could be great,'' said Dr. Francis Miro, the chief
of obstetrics and gynecology at Makerere University Medical School
in Kampala, the Ugandan capital.
</P>
<P>
   Makerere is Africa's oldest university, and it was from here
nearly 20 years ago that the first vague reports of ``slim
disease'' _ as AIDS was called here before it had a name _ started
making their way to America. Since then, more than 2 million
Ugandans _ nearly 15 percent of the nation _ have become infected,
and of those, 1 million have died in this country where many
researchers think the AIDS epidemic may have begun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you know what I would love to be able to do all day?'' Miro
asked rhetorically. ``I would love to counsel every HIV positive
mother about her choices in life. I would love to tell her about
breast milk and about formula. Then I would love to have a
conversation with her about what would happen to her in her village
if she stopped breastfeeding. What would her mother in law say?
What would her husband do? And of course I would love to make sure
she understood the rules for keeping formula sterile and that she
complied with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would love to do all that,'' he concluded wearily. ``But
then I wouldn't be living in Uganda and I wouldn't be talking to my
own people. I would be living in America and I would be talking to
your people.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he thought it was always foolish to recommend formula
to women living in villages, he closed his eyes and reeled off the
numbers: ``Twenty seven percent of babies born to infected mothers
become infected from breastfeeding,'' he said. ``In rural areas 85
percent of babies will die from dirty water used in formula. I know
what they are trying to do, and I applaud the effort. But you don't
need a medical degree to figure out which of those odds to take.''
</P>
<P>
   All you really have to do is take a walk down the red dust roads
near Kakulu. There are no toilets and few outhouses. People live
literally from day to day. Water from still pools, the birthplace
of malarial mosquitoes, is often used to drink because its so far
to walk to the well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The temptation is great sometimes,'' Mrs. Nannyongoi
acknowledged. ``We try to boil the water, but sometimes we don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside, a man is raking about 50 pounds of coffee for bad
beans. Nearly a dozen children, mostly naked, play in the yard. In
a shack across the way, Halimah Namtovu, a 30-year-old woman
wrapped in black scarves, sits beneath a picture of Mohammed. Two
months ago she gave birth to the ninth of her children, all of whom
are still alive. She said she thought formula would be a good idea,
but she has trouble affording soy milk to give her older children.
A kilogram costs about a dollar and lasts less than week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all do what our mothers did,'' she said without any rancor.
``If there is a better way, I have never seen one.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the habits of millennia, Miro and countless colleagues
agree that something fairly drastic must be done to help protect
children from HIV. If mothers who are infected with the virus do
not breastfeed, their children will have a far better chance of
survival.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, AIDS experts now know that if a pregnant woman is
treated with a very inexpensive course of AZT during the final
stages of her pregnancy, during birth and for a few days after her
child is born, the chance of transmission of the virus to the child
is reduced by half. The cost of such a course of treatment was
until recently $200 per person, but with the help of the UN AIDS
program and the World Health Organization, the price is now $50.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the best life-saving program we have in the developing
world,'' said Dr. Joseph Saba, a clinical research specialist with
UNAIDS, who has coordinated the attempt to make drugs more
accessible to people in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot just say to these people you are too poor to live.
You have to say we are trying everything on earth to stop this
plague. They have to know that we are not condemning them to
death.''
</P>
<P>
   Saba comes often to Uganda to mediate between drug companies,
health officials and aid agencies in an effort to bring drug prices
down so that local governments and at least some people can afford
them. He knows as well as anyone that, as is the case with formula,
making AZT available to pregnant mothers raises almost as many
terrible new questions as it answers.
</P>
<P>
   And the biggest one is obvious: will AZT encourage women to have
children who will all either die or become orphans?
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the mother delivers, she will stop taking AZT; almost
no African women can afford to stay on it for long. That means she
will die, probably within two or three years, sometimes much
sooner. Her child will then almost certainly join the almost
unimaginably vast army _ in Africa alone the number is now past 8
million _ of orphans that the AIDS epidemic has unleashed upon the
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is worse?'' asks Dr. Edward Mbidde, the chief of Uganda's
Cancer Institute, and one of the countries medical leaders, ``to
let a baby die of AIDS when we can save it, or to let the baby into
the world just to become an orphan in a society that has been
overwhelmed with death? I have not yet run into anyone who is
qualified to answer that question.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody has. But like everywhere else, people in African villages
don't normally choose death when life is even remotely possible.
</P>
<P>
   Many rural families are large _ the birth rate here is still
higher than in most other places in the world _ and the concept of
family is defined very broadly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children is what villages in Africa are for,'' said Eelin
Berdall, the mother superior of the St. James School, a rural
private school deep in the bush of western Zimbabwe. ``When people
start asking questions about whether it's right to have children
under certain circumstances, they are just thinking Western. Nobody
here would ever think that way. Here, if somebody is going to die,
then their mother, father sister or brother will want children to
remember them.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Berdall, an Anglican, has been a leader in trying to help
get AIDS drugs to pregnant mothers and in trying to help people
think of families in unconventional ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here the child belongs to the family, it is the vehicle of the
tribe'' she said. ``If we can save a child, we have to save a
child. And with some very strong effort, we can save millions.''
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of youngsters are playing behind her in the baking midday
sun. Some of them walk barefoot distances up to 10 miles a day just
to attend the school. Their brown cotton uniforms are donated by a
variety of groups. The vaccines they receive are donated by the
government and by the World Health Organization. Their food is
brought by concerned friends and neighbors. Mrs. Berdall summons a
teacher to join her.
</P>
<P>
   ``This woman's sister just died of AIDS,'' the mother superior
said matter of factly. ``She left five children.''
</P>
<P>
   Sulfina Dube, 39, nods slowly. Her sister was one of the few
women in this part of the world who could afford formula, and who
lived in circumstances where it could be prepared properly and
regularly. ``My sister understood that it was her only chance to
save her baby,'' said Miss Dube, who now looks after Celie, the
youngest of the five children orphaned when her sister died of AIDS
this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was never a minute when any of us wondered whether it
was right for Celie to be born, or to survive. How could you even
ask something like that?''
</P>
<P>
   Others wonder how you cannot.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are really asking many women is do you want your baby
to die of a horrible disease or do you want him to starve to
death?'' said Sophia Mukasa Monico, the head of TAOS, Uganda's
unique AIDS support organization. TAOS has 27,000 clients and not
one of them receives drugs that are considered routine in the West.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it ethical to bring a baby into this world in that way?
Nobody will ever answer that question. We certainly are not going
to stop people from having babies. And it's wonderful that there
are ways to treat those children and protect them. But let's not
look at formula or a few AZT pills as an answer. It's really just a
question: Do women who don't breastfeeed want to bring orphans into
this world? Or do they want to risk killing their children by
caring for them? We're used to death around here. But this is a
choice only Idi Amin could have made.''

`PERICLES': THE PLAY THAT HAS EVERYTHING 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes at end of review.) 
(mk) 
 By D.J.R. BRUCKNER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If it's not in ``Pericles,'' maybe it isn't possible
in theater. This wonderful old bag of tricks has everything _
murder, kidnapping, drowning, lost children, resurrections,
political intrigue, divine vengeance, a bordello redeemed by a
virgin, admired rulers whose sex lives would arch Satan's eyebrow,
pimps, homicidal jealousy, labor induced by a hurricane, birth
onstage and eternal love. The opening scene portrays
father-daughter incest so vividly that television would have to
warn you to shield your children from it. What a play!
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it is a little disorderly, taking place in six
ancient cities and at sea over about 30 years and involving 40
characters. Shakespeare's name is usually attached to it since the
members of his theater company registered it as theirs in 1607, and
he probably did write a couple of striking scenes. But its language
tells you it was composed by at least a few hands over many years;
some lines are almost as medieval as the underlying wildly romantic
story, brought from the Continent into English by the poet John
Gower in the 14th century. And if the most sophisticated
playwrights and actors around Shakespeare knew his greatest plays
were Olympian while ``Pericles'' was pulp, ``Pericles'' was wildly
popular with the crowds down in the pit.
</P>
<P>
   The production directed by Jonathan Bank for the Kings County
Shakespeare Company as part of its three-show festival at the
Picnic House in Prospect Park lets you know why. Ten actors
revolving through all the roles _ occasionally pausing to tell the
audience where they are as the action hopscotches across the
Mediterranean _ carry viewers from helpless laughter to rigid
apprehension to mourning and back to mirth with scarcely a moment
of emotional disorientation.
</P>
<P>
   It is remarkable to see people gleefully cheering as a pander,
his house madam and a pimp are thwarted and then defeated by a
teen-age girl of terrifying virtue in an episode as funny as any in
Elizabethan theater, and then, minutes later, to shed tears as
Pericles, deprived of his wits by hopeless loss, recognizes that
this girl is the daughter he believed had perished at birth in a
storm _ a scene that embodies a poem as perfect as any in the
language.
</P>
<P>
   Bank has been working on this play for 10 years, and he and this
cast exploit the text as they ought to _ shamelessly and with an
eye to irresistible entertainment. They trim excessive or murky
speeches, borrow lines from a contemporary book that we would now
call a novelized version of the play and do not hesitate to let the
audience know how much they enjoy their work, especially when they
can seize the villainous roles. It had to be like this in
Shakespeare's time: No story stays at the top of the charts for 200
years without devotees who know how to make people feel happy to
hear it over and over.
</P>

GROUP CLAIMS RESPONSIBILITY FOR DEADLY OMAGH BOMBING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN   AND JOHN O'FARRELL  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OMAGH, Northern Ireland _ As people here began burying their
dead, a dissident republican group opposed to the peace process
claimed responsibility Tuesday for Saturday's car bomb that killed
28 people and injured some 200 others.
</P>
<P>
   The self-styled Real IRA admitted responsibility for the worst
atrocity in three decades of violence in Northern Ireland. It
apologized for killing civilians, but insisted it had given ample
warnings.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone call to the Dublin office of the Irish News, a
Belfast newspaper, a male caller using a recognized code word tried
to shift the blame onto police who unwittingly moved crowds of
shoppers near the bomb after being told the bomb was somewhere near
the town's courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite media reports, it was not our intention at any time to
kill any civilians,'' the caller said. ``It was a commercial
target, part of the ongoing war against the Brits. We offer
apologies to the civilians. There were three warnings put in. There
were 40-minute warnings on each of them.''
</P>
<P>
   The caller said the warnings had made clear each time that the
bomb was located 300 to 400 yards from the courthouse on the main
street, and never claimed the bomb was near the courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   But officials at Ulster Television, which received two of the
three calls, said the caller did not give a location for the bomb
in either warning.
</P>
<P>
   British Secretary of State Mo Mowlam called the attempt by the
bombers to blame others for the carnage ``contemptible and an
insult to the people of Omagh.''
</P>
<P>
   The Monaghan and Grimes families suffered staggering losses in
the Saturday bombings, and their funerals Tuesday began a week of
more funerals and public grieving, that will culminate with a
national moment of silence on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Avril Monaghan, 30, was holding her daughter Maura and standing
next to her 65-year-old mother, Mary Grimes, when the bomb
exploded, killing three generations of women from the same family.
Monaghan was eight months pregnant with twin girls.
</P>
<P>
   The family asked politicians not to attend the service at St.
MacCartan's Church in the picturesque village of Clogher, just
outside Omagh. In a statement after the funeral, Kevin Murnaghan, a
lawyer and family friend, said they wanted no one to use the
tragedy for political purposes.
</P>
<P>
   The silence of hundreds of mourners outside the small,
19th-century church and around the Celtic high crosses of the
adjacent graveyard was eerie. The funeral Mass was relayed by
speaker to the overflow crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. James Grimes, Avril Monaghan's uncle, who performed her
wedding ceremony, officiated at her funeral. He asked mourners to
forgive the bombers. He also prayed that the Omagh bombing would be
``the last of the terrible agonies our people have suffered over
the past 30 years.''
</P>
<P>
   As the two coffins were carried from the church, many people
broke into restrained sobs. There was a jarring juxtaposition of
colors: five altar boys with flowing red cassocks led a procession
of three priests in white, Bishop Joseph Duffy in purple vestments,
followed by the brown oak coffin of Avril Monaghan and, most
poignant, the tiny white coffin of Maura carried by two of her
uncles.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately behind, Avril Monaghan's husband, Michael, carried
his sleeping 3-year-old son, Patrick, on his shoulder, while two
other daughters, Aoibheann, 6, and Eilise, 4, walked behind. His
other shoulder was grasped by Mick Grimes, his father-in-law, who
will bury his own wife today in the same churchyard.

volatile food and energy costs, increased by the same amount. The
other shows that the trade deficit in goods and services narrowed
during June for the first time this year, shrinking to $14.15

   CONGO-ASSESS (Kinshasa, Congo) _ The leaders of the rebellion
are trying to present an ethnically diverse face to the country to
avoid the hostility a Tutsi-led regime would attract, but few
Congolese say they would accept any government that they believe is
installed by Rwanda. Instead, the outcome of this conflict, the
latest of many in a country whose history has been full of
uprisings, is likely to be decided by more powerful neighbors.
These countries have sharply divergent interests, but one trait in
common: during the rebellion that brought Kabila to power, they
grew used to playing kingmaker in Africa's third largest country.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: 'PRESIDENT'S OWN' MUSIC TELLS HISTORY OF OFFICE
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Put aside the legalities of did-he or did-he-not
commit perjury, the endless off-color jokes on late-night TV, and
the burst of Internet ads that use Oval Office sex for their sales
pitches. How's one to measure the stature of the presidency in the
era of Bill Clinton?
</P>
<P>
   Try the music test.
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, this is a president known for his love of music
and who only a few weeks back presided over a celebration of 200
years of stirring marches and anthems performed by the U.S. Marine
Band, so closely identified with the chief executive that it was
nicknamed ``the President's Own'' by Thomas Jefferson.
</P>
<P>
   First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton told the picnic celebration on
the South Lawn of the White House that her husband has on some
occasions played with them and secretly harbored a desire to be one
of the saxophonists. And she wrote in her weekly column, ``In the
White House, no occasion goes unmarked without the help of the
Marine Band.''
</P>
<P>
   So amid Clinton's admission of improper behavior with a White
House intern, a compact disk of Marine Band recordings given out
that July day becomes a measuring stick for the dignity and
endurance of the nation's highest office.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A performance of ``The President's March,'' written at the
time when George Washington, recalls the man who, more than any
other, set the tone for the office. Washington the war hero might
have been king, but he chose emphatically to be ``Mr. President.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Hail to the Chief,'' that arresting tune that alerts crowds
to the arrival of presidents, came into use under John Quincy
Adams, a president who failed to win popular support and was
defeated after a single term. Yet Adams was not too proud to take a
seat in the House of Representatives, where he served the rest of
his life.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A mournful march written at the time of Abraham Lincoln's
assassination offers a reminder of the nation's resiliency in
extremity. Not only did the nation lose the leader who had
struggled to bind the divided nation, but Lincoln's successor
Andrew Johnson was impeached and came within a single vote of being
thrown out of office.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A performance of a march written for Franklin D. Roosevelt
marked the only president to be elected four times. But unknown to
most voters during that last election, he was too weak to leave the
White House for his inaugural, and he died within months, with the
nation still fighting World War II. His little-known successor,
Harry S. Truman, had not even been told about the secret
development of the atomic bomb, but he led the nation to victory
and has since become an icon for politicians who admire his ``The
buck stops here'' motto.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Liberty Bell,'' a composition by the famed Marine Band
director John Philip Sousa, became a favorite piece for the
nation's Bicentennial in 1976. Just two years earlier, the
unthinkable had happened at the White House when Richard Nixon
became the first president to resign. Earlier, Nixon's first vice
president, Sprio Agnew, had been forced to resign and replaced by
the appointment of Gerald Ford. Yet with a minimum disruption, Ford
was sworn into the presidency, and he led the country in
celebrating both its birthday and the strength of its constitution.
</P>
<P>
   If the Marine Band's music history provides insights into the
past, toward the end of the recording is a rendition of ``America
the Beautiful'' that seems to offer an intriguing message for the
current White House crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Drawn from the poem by Katherine Bates, the opening verse that
begins ``Oh beautiful for spacious skies,'' is familiar to almost
every American. But Marine soloist Michael Ryan concludes with a
verse much less remembered:
</P>
<P>
   ``America! America!
</P>
<P>
   God mend thine every flaw
</P>
<P>
   Confirm thy soul in self-control
</P>
<P>
   Thy liberty in law.''

 &HT;    No summer break for aspiring athletes
 &HT;    By Bill Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCKY MOUNT, N.C. _ Summertime is a time for being lazy. Summer
is a time for trips to the beach, for lying in a hammock, running
through a sprinkler. Summertime is for fresh, fat, juicy peaches.
And not having to worry about school.
</P>
<P>
   Summer is a time to ... bust that behind.
</P>
<P>
   Say what?
</P>
<P>
   In these days of athletics as big business, there is no time for
a summer, or anything resembling time off from sports.
</P>
<P>
   Summer is the time for hosting and going to camps. Summer is the
time for hitting a hot, sweaty weight room. It's the time for
recruiting, restocking and rebuilding. Summer is the time for
refinishing the gymnasium floor or cultivating new grass on the
football or soccer fields.
</P>
<P>
   Because, as of this week and rapidly approaching weeks, it will
be too late.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past few months, I've been putting together stories
that check out what area players and coaches do during the
offseason. The primary thing I discovered was that the word
``offseason'' doesn't really apply if one plays sports at the upper
echelon of high schools or any level of college.
</P>
<P>
   That was the tack I took with my story last week on North
Carolina Wesleyan's John Thompson, my final piece in the informal
series. After going to Thompson's basketball camp in Greensboro, we
hopped in the car and steamrolled to Charlotte for the Prep Stars
recruiting camp. It was a great opportunity to see what coaches and
players go through, a one-day snapshot of big-time college
recruiting.
</P>
<P>
   I was dumbfounded. All the players were wearing jerseys with
numbers, so I went to a camp organizer to request a list of player
names so I could see if there were any kids from our area attending
the camp. The guy looked at me and said ``40 bucks.''
</P>
<P>
   Forty bills for a list of names? And that was the cheap list,
with just names and numbers. The expensive list included stats,
player bios and other info. An absolute necessity for college
recruiters, who had to shell out $125 for the good list. There was
a lot of paper running through that camp, and most of it was going
into the wallet of the guy who ran the show. Not only did the
coaches pay big money, but the players had to cough it up as well.
</P>
<P>
   We went to basketball camp at Northern Nash. N.C. State standout
Chasity Melvin was there to speak to the youngsters. Coaches can
sometimes talk until they are blue in the face and not command the
attention that a college or pro hero will grab.
</P>
<P>
   But sometimes camps will substitute star power for learning
power, which was obvious at another camp I attended. At that
particular camp, kids got autographs from folks like Jerry
Stackhouse and Vince Carter, but they didn't learn anything.
Another camp was the exact opposite. Former Harlem Globetrotter
Meadowlark Lemon concentrated on spreading love and the good word.
There too, the basketball lessons were secondary: But it was in a
good way.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the recruiting jaunt, my favorite trips for the summer
were to a summer hoops league at the YMCA and a football passing
league at Fike. Maybe it's because I miss those sports the most
during the summer.
</P>
<P>
   All the schools, coaches and players made one thing readily
apparent: One thing that doesn't happen during the summer is a
three-month vacation.

 &HT;    Collecting mementos and valuables not the same anymore
 &HT;    By Don McLeese
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Until the Sports Collectibles show last weekend
at Palmer Auditorium, I hadn't pulled out my collection of baseball
autographs for a decade or two. But I've always slept better
knowing it was there. When I was 9 and 10 years old _ even 11 _ I
would send double postcards, purchased at the post office, to as
many players as my allowance permitted. On one card, addressed to
the player's home ballpark, I would pledge my fandom and explain
how much an autograph would mean to me. The attached card would be
blank, prepaid and self-addressed.
</P>
<P>
   And so they responded, future Hall of Famers such as Warren
Spahn, Yogi Berra and Stan Musial (who stamped rather than signed
his). But my favorites were the rookies and second stringers of my
beloved Chicago Cubs, the guys who weren't deluged with autograph
requests, and thus took the time to deliver more of a personal
touch:
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear Don, Thanks for the card. Your Pal, Lou Johnson.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To Don, Best Always, Al Heist, Chicago Cubs.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure such mementos are worth much on today's burgeoning
collectors' market, but I'd guess that whatever is driving the
prices up _ into the hundreds and thousands of dollars for
particularly prized autographs _ is something different from the
boyhood devotion that made my collection priceless to me. As the
rows upon rows of autographed bats, balls, jerseys and baseball
cards in the bowels of Palmer made plain, yesterday's treasure is
today's commodity, tomorrow's investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's so remarkable about this business or hobby is that it
goes from 8 to 80 (years old),'' said show promoter Larry Dluhy,
whose Sports Collectibles store was the first of its type in
Houston 20 years ago. ``And they're not just sports nuts. You could
spend a couple of bucks or thousands and thousands of dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, the mass-produced trading cards that once dominated
are giving way to limited editions at higher prices, while the
proliferation of counterfeit autographs has put even more of a
premium on authenticity. At the booth run by the Austin Sports
Connection stores, a plastic-encased Dan Marino card with a
certified autograph was priced at two grand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even with the kids, the high-end stuff is what they really
want,'' said store manager Bobby Lo. ``Austin used to have more
than 20 baseball card shops, and now there's only four left.
(Actually, the phone book lists a half-dozen more.) Right now, the
biggest thing is those Beanie Babies.''
</P>
<P>
   Such variables and fluctuations mean little to Jim Murphy, who
drove directly from Dallas to Austin at midnight Friday after
learning that Lou Brock would be Saturday's featured attraction.
With a bat and two balls for Brock to sign, Murphy was paying
almost a hundred bucks for the privilege of receiving the Hall of
Famer's signatures. Unlike so many signees at such shows, Brock
took the time to chat and pose for pictures rather than rushing
through the hundreds in line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was born in St. Louis, and my grandfather brought me to see
Lou Brock in 1968,'' explained the 38-year-old Murphy. ``Here's the
chance to meet the guy and shake his hand. I'm hanging this bat on
the wall, and I'll save it for my son. It's something that I'll
remember forever. And it's how I'll remember my grandpa.''

 &HT;    CEO plans new name, focus, for PhyMatrix Corp.
 &HT;    By Phil Galewitz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH _ PhyMatrix Corp. has decided to get out of the
physician management business, which has been the core of the
company's operations since its founding in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the company headed by Palm Beach businessman Abe Gosman
will concentrate on its clinical trials business, which manages
sites that drug makers use to test their products.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview, Gosman said he also plans to change the
name of the West Palm Beach company, since the PhyMatrix moniker no
longer applies. And PhyMatrix's headquarters will move from
Phillips Point office center in West Palm Beach to PhyMatrix's
Medical Mall in Palm Beach Gardens, Gosman said.
</P>
<P>
   PhyMatrix also will expand its medical real estate development
company, Dasco, into non-medical areas as well. For example, Dasco
developed the Medical Mall as an outpatient health center but now
plans to add to other office towers mainly to house non-medical
offices.
</P>
<P>
   PhyMatrix is still considering whether it will keep Dasco or
spin it off into a separate publicly traded company. A company
source said a spin-off early next year is likely. Gosman, who is
chairman and CEO of PhyMatrix, has become CEO of Dasco, replacing
Bruce Rendina, who resigned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in diversification,'' Gosman said, in explaining
Dasco's move into non-health care real estate development.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street reacted to the changes with a shrug. PhyMatrix
(Nasdaq: PHMX) closed at $5.13, down 59 cents.

 &HT;    Fastball legend's nickname will go to his team
 &HT;    By Christian Davenport
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROUND ROCK, Texas _ After more than a month of voting in the
contest to rename the minor-league baseball team Nolan Ryan wants
to bring to Round Rock, his son Reid announced the new name Monday.
</P>
<P>
   (Drum roll please.)
</P>
<P>
   And the winner is . . .
</P>
<P>
   The Round Rock Express.
</P>
<P>
   The moniker comes from Nolan Ryan himself, the right-handed
Texas hero who was nicknamed the ``Ryan Express'' for his
locomotive-like fastball. The name is, as the future hall of
famer's oldest son pointed out, another in a long line of tributes
to the man _ the legend _ who is revered for his rectitude as well
as his celebrated career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't surprise me,'' Reid Ryan said at Damon's restaurant
in Round Rock, which was packed for the announcement with parents,
baseball fans, and children in baseball caps. ``When they had a
chance, the people of this area chose to honor Nolan Ryan.''
</P>
<P>
   As more than a hundred people looked on, with their stomachs
full of free food and drink, Reid Ryan with the help of a couple of
young fans unrolled the banner that stated the Express would be
``rolling into town the spring of 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet some at the restaurant said they were pulling for one of the
other three options on the ballots that have been circulating for
more than a month: the Fire Ants, the Round Rock Rattlers, and the
Texas Outlaws.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 2,862 votes, the Express garnered 628. In second place
was the Texas Outlaws with 487; third was Reid Ryan's favorite, the
Texas Fire Ants, with 417; and last was the Round Rock Rattlers
with 400 votes.
</P>
<P>
   Estevan Uriegas, 8, said he liked the Rattlers the best. His
11-year-old brother, Marcelo, said was rooting for the Outlaws.
Their father, Rudy, seemed to shy away from one name rather than
embrace the others: ``Fire Ants _ that one I might have had a
problem with.''
</P>
<P>
   There were also 930 write-in candidates for the team, a
minor-league affiliate of the Houston Astros. The Round Rock
Pioneers topped the write-in list with 55 votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since Nolan Ryan started it, it should be named for him,''
said Doris Harvey, who with her husband Dan, makes several trips a
year to Houston to see the Astros.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the tie with the team's famous owner, the Express
is a fitting name because trains following the Union Pacific tracks
rumble along U.S. 79, where the stadium is expected to be built. If
voters in November approve a measure that would allow the city to
finance its portion of the stadium with hotel-motel tax revenue,
the team, currently the Jackson (Miss.) Generals, will play its
first game in Round Rock in April 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Before the team name was announced, 7-year-old Casey Strong said
he liked the Rattlers the best. After the announcement he said he
had changed his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the Express now.''

JAZZING UP HER SELF-IMAGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GLENN WHIPP  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Diana Krall walked onto the stage of the Orange
County Performing Arts Center last February wearing a floor-length,
sleeveless black evening gown and a wry smile, and from the moment
she hunkered down at her piano, the sold-out audience sat straight
back and assumed the position of rapt attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peel me a grape,'' Krall sang in her hushed, smoky voice,
``crush me some ice, skin me a peach, save the fuzz for my
pillow.''
</P>
<P>
   She had them. They were hanging on every word. If a fruit vendor
had been wandering by at that moment, this crowd would have bought
every grape and peach and maybe even a few nectarines and cherries
for good measure and they would have peeled them, skinned them ...
they would have shined and polished them if it would have made this
woman happy. That's how far gone these people were.
</P>
<P>
   Funny thing is, the louder the crowd applauded, the more uneasy
Krall seemed to become. She could barely even look at them, much
less smile. She spoke occasionally between songs, but confined her
comments mostly to the music. Indeed, she seemed happiest when one
of her trio's musicians _ guitarist Russell Malone or bass player
Ben Wolfe _ did something unexpected with an instrumental phrasing.
Then she would light up like a Christmas tree. As for the standing
ovation at the end, she seemed appreciative, but mostly
embarrassed.
</P>
<P>
   All of this left some in the audience members scratching their
heads. Wasn't this the same sexy, sultry singer they had seen on
``Melrose Place''? Wasn't this the same woman whose leggy good
looks and Vidal Sassoon hair adorned her album covers? She should
be reveling in all of this attention and good will, shouldn't she?
</P>
<P>
   Well, in some ways, she was _ and is. During the past three
years, the Canadian-born Krall has become the biggest thing in jazz
by taking vintage songs, inhabiting them and making them her art.
She doesn't update the music, she simply makes it seem old and,
somehow, new at the same time with her old-fashioned glamour and
leisurely way of playing and phrasing.
</P>
<P>
   Her two albums for Impulse Records, 1996's Nat King Cole Trio
tribute ``All for You'' and last year's exquisite ``Love Scenes,''
each have sold more than 200,000 copies. While those numbers won't
exactly give the Backstreet Boys pause for thought, they are
astounding figures for a traditional jazz artist. And they have
left many purists, including Krall herself, looking for answers.
After all, real jazz isn't supposed to be popular, is it?
</P>
<P>
   ``She knows how to sing and phrase a song,'' says Los Angeles
jazz radio fixture Chuck Niles, who broadcasts on KLON (88.1 FM).
``The fact that she's an attractive person doesn't hurt, either.
Some people think visually and not just audibly.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds her producer, GRP Records president Tommy LiPuma: ``Whether
we're dealing with something that has a bit of nostalgia attached
to it or not, Diana has the charisma and the style and the
originality to pull it off. She just has a huge passion for this
music.''
</P>
<P>
   Krall, who shares the bill with jazz piano legend (and fellow
Canadian) Oscar Peterson at the Hollywood Bowl tonight, doesn't
quite know what to make of her remarkable success. But she bristles
at the suggestion that it has anything to do with those coquettish
photos that grace her albums.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody asked me the other day if I thought I was a flash in
the pan,'' the 32-year-old Krall says sharply. ``I think that comes
from someone who really hasn't listened to my music. You won't hear
me complaining about the attention, though. It's a gift, a great
gift, one that I appreciate. But I can't worry about sustaining it.
All I know is that it's certainly better than sitting around my New
York apartment, twiddling my thumbs, waiting for the phone to
ring.''
</P>
<P>
   If anything, Krall seems intent on expanding the gift and, along
with it, her audience. She will play two Lilith Fair concerts in
Canada this month and is squeezing in time to work on a new album
that will feature arrangements from legendary composer Johnny
Mandel. (She's hoping to have it in stores by late spring.)
</P>
<P>
   Krall also recently has switched management firms, moving from
the boutique-sized Jazz Tree Management to S.L. Feldman and
Associates, which guides Joni Mitchell among others. To purists
(jazz isn't supposed to be popular, is it?), it's another sign of
the apocalypse. To Krall, it's an attempt to have a long career,
ala Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard the people saying that I'm going pop,'' says the
shy, thoughtful Krall, who enjoys interviews almost as much as
standing ovations. ``But I didn't exactly get into jazz music
looking for Spice Girl success. I'm not selling out. I think as
long as I maintain artistic integrity in everything I do, the rest
of it doesn't matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Krall's success is even more remarkable considering that, just
five years ago, she couldn't find a record label in the United
States willing to release her first album, ``Stepping Out.'' In
fact, Krall admits that it wasn't until she made the Nat King Cole
album that she became comfortable with the idea of using her voice.
Prior to that, a Krall concert would feature several instrumentals
and the bare minimum number of vocals required by the show's
promoter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Singing is a very personal thing, and I never thought I had
the greatest instrument,'' Krall says. ``I can remember trying out
for the youth choir in fourth grade and being rejected because they
said my voice wasn't high enough and didn't have enough range. For
me, that proved it. I can't sing. It was a shame because if they
had stuck me in the back with the boys, I would have been fine _
and probably had a lot of fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in Nanaimo, British Columbia, Krall began playing
classical piano at age 4. Her mother and her father played as well,
and her grandmother was a singer. Krall spent a good many weekends
at her grandparents' home, singing Sinatra and Cole tunes around
the piano in a setting that would have been straight out of a
Norman Rockwell lithograph except for the animated card game going
on in the background and for the fact that alcohol, not apple
cider, was the beverage of choice.
</P>
<P>
   Krall landed her first paying gig when she was 15, and began to
play piano three nights a week at a hometown restaurant. Later that
year, she won a Vancouver Jazz Festival scholarship to study at
Boston's Berklee College of Music. Krall spent a year and a half
there before returning home.
</P>
<P>
   Her parents weren't completely sold on the idea of a career in
music, but they didn't discourage her, either. Soon, she moved to
Los Angeles to study with pianist Jimmy Rowles, considered one of
the best jazz accompanists. From there, it was hotel lounges,
restaurants and clubs until she made her first record in 1993.
(Then, of course, it was more hotel lounges, restaurants and
clubs.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I had encouragement every step of the way, first from my
family, who taught me I could do anything I set my mind to, and
then from musicians like Jimmy Rowles, Ray Brown (a veteran of
Oscar Peterson's band), John Clayton and Jeff Hamilton, guys who
were like big brothers to me and still are,'' Krall says. ``That's
the greatest thing about this music _ you never stop learning,
especially when there are so many people willing to offer their
wisdom and help.''
</P>
<P>
   If that sounds like some kind of Grammy acceptance speech
(something Krall will likely have to give one day _ she has already
been nominated twice), it certainly comes from her heart. Krall
tosses out praise as easily as she does her melancholy tunes,
putting in good words for bandmates Malone and Wolfe (who share the
spotlight quite equally with Krall during concerts), friends like
George Benson and influences such as the great Peterson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't even say I'm sharing the bill with him at the Hollywood
Bowl,'' she scolds, genuinely horrified at the suggestion.
</P>
<P>
   And it's that unbridled awe, combined with a nice way with a
song, a bona fide love of music and an endearing bashfulness, that
makes Krall such a promising figure on the jazz scene. Sure, she
looks great in a black evening gown. But if you peeled her a grape,
she probably would say thank you, and then peel you one, too.

By BOB STRAUSS 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Neil LaBute, the writer-director of the
earth-scorching, enjoyably evil ``In the Company of Men,'' lets
some ladies in on the fun with ``Your Friends &AMP; Neighbors,'' his
hilarious, merciless new study of how awful people can be.
</P>
<P>
   But this isn't just ``Company'' with mirrors, where bad boys
meet their female matches. Only one of the six principals in this
roundelay of rotten relationships and worse sex seems intentionally
cruel. And even Jason Patric's Cary probably doesn't think of
himself as all that mean; he's just the kind of calculating egotist
who plots an act of revenge for every perceived slight, then
justifies his sadism with the thought that ``common decency
dictated the whole thing.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the rest, they're just young adults in the big city
searching for satisfaction. And devastating anyone they think they
love in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Eckhart, who played the wicked deceiver in ``Company,'' is
cuddlier here as a chubby hubby named Barry who is very sweet to
his adorable wife Mary (Amy Brenneman) but sexually dysfunctional
nonetheless. Mary, naturally, finds this frustrating, so when good
friend Jerry (Ben Stiller) proposes an affair, she's intrigued.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry may be acting out of his own frustration. His live-in
girlfriend Terri (Catherine Keener) has a razor-sharp tongue and,
maybe as a result of that, a driving need for silence during
lovemaking. Being a drama teacher and, so, prone to dramatics,
Jerry tends to be vocal during intimacy. Things between these two
are rather strained.
</P>
<P>
   Circling the periphery of the couples like preying hawks are the
misogynistic Cary (he recites raunchy pillow talk into a cassette
recorder while exercising) and Cheri (Nastassja Kinski), a gay art
gallery employee whom just about everyone else in the movie
approaches at different times with almost the exact same pickup
lines _ Terri most successfully.
</P>
<P>
   As this synopsis indicates, the emphasis here is on words and
their power to excite, seduce, delude and, especially, to cut like
a Ginzu. There's also an odd formalism to the repetitive
conversational ploys, recombining couplings and unpleasant
character traits that don't change under different circumstances
with new partners. Filmed in appropriately inappropriate widescreen
_ every scene is just people talking _ it's like LaBute feels we're
all trapped in individual romantic rat mazes. It's a libidinized
``No Exit.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but within the constricting structures, what a bracing
variety of behavior. Patric and Keener have the showiest, most
overtly nasty roles, so of course things liven up whenever they
appear (and their one encounter, an atypically fluid Steadicam shot
in a bookstore, is the film's most relentlessly acrid).
</P>
<P>
   But Terri and Cary's monstrous selfishness is only the flash.
``Your Friends &AMP; Neighbors' '' depth lies in the creepy way it
keeps manipulating our feelings for the supposedly more likable
characters. Is Stiller's Jerry a heartless cad or a sympathetic
failure at the moving communication that's so important to him? Do
men let Brenneman's Mary down, or is she too impatient and
unforgivng to enable them not to?
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, ``Your Friends &AMP; Neighbors'' can indeed be
enjoyed as a co-ed ``Company of Men,'' a particularly vicious
comedy about the war between the sexes. But there's a richer, if
camouflaged tenderness in the new film. The sad choke you hear
accompanying the clever, well-crafted jibes is the sound of people
who desperately want to connect and couldn't be angrier that words
don't get the job done.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; It's further away than Christmas _ this year or
next _ but the countdown to the millennium has officially begun.
</P>
<P>
   Today, marking the 500th day until the year 2000, Bloomingdale's
is opening its Mark of the Millennium shops inside all 23
Bloomingdale's stores across the country.
</P>
<P>
   According to Valli Zale, manager of the Bloomingdale's store at
Fashion Square in Sherman Oaks, the shop-within-a-shop will receive
new merchandise each month to keep the excitement level high as the
M-date draws near.
</P>
<P>
   In a special retail partnership with Ken Walker, president of
01-01-00 Products, Bloomingdale's Millennium shops will feature
merchandise in a black-and-white color combination with the
01-01-00 logo by more than 45 designers, including Adrienne
Vittadini knitwear, Nicole Miller and Ferragamo ties, Crunch
athletic styles and Josie Natori sportswear.
</P>
<P>
   On display today will be T-shirts, caps, mugs and countdown
clocks. In October, shoppers will find backpacks, duffel bags,
wallets and pet dishes, said Zale, who added that Christmas gift
ideas with the countdown logo will be accented with touches of red
and silver.
</P>
<P>
   After making their debut at Bloomingdale's, 01-01-00 products
will be offered at J.C. Penney, Sears and Macy's, but each store
will have its own version of 01-01-00 merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   Macy's spokeswoman Merle Goldstone said Macy's will have a
millennium shop with the 01-01-00 logo on boxer shorts, jackets and
digital watches, as well as other novelties by the end of October.
</P>
<P>
   Items are priced from $6 to $250.

C.C. SMITH BRINGS `PLANET GROOVE' TO KCSN

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Northridge public-radio station KCSN-FM (88.5) has
added an international music program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Planet Groove'' can be heard at 8 p.m. Saturdays. The host is
C.C. Smith, editor of the Beat magazine and a former KCRW-FM (89.9)
world-music disc jockey.
</P>
<P>
   Smith describes the program's fusion of world dance music as
``reggae, soca, samba, soukous, ska, makossa and more,'' adding
that she focuses on special dance-party mixes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very different show than people are used to on KCSN,''
Smith said. ``In fact, all the weekend programming is different,
too, with country and American roots-music shows.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith says she tries to keep the music going nonstop with little
interruption.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a very wide range of music out there,'' she said.
``The part I tend to focus on is special dance mixes, plus a lot of
crossover fusion between genres. I'm trying to mix different
cultures and sounds.''
</P>
<P>
   THE BROTHER COPELAND: Longtime music-business veterans Miles,
Ian and Stewart Copeland are hosting an hourlong talk-radio show
during the month of August.
</P>
<P>
   The call-in program, `Sibling Rivalry,'' aims to dispel myths
about the three brothers. Among the regular features will be music
news and gossip, new records, unsigned bands and tips from the
pros.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe there has ever been a time when my brothers
and I have ever been at a loss for words or had nothing to say,''
said Miles Copeland, who manages Sting and is chairman of the Ark
21 Records label.
</P>
<P>
   Copeland brother Stewart was drummer for the Police and now
creates film soundtracks. Ian Copeland has been a booking agent for
such artists as the Verve and Snoop Dogg and recently opened a new
bar in Beverly Hills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sibling Rivalry'' is broadcast at 5:30 p.m. Fridays on
adult-contemporary KPLS-AM (830).

   CORBETT ON Y-107: Kat Corbett has joined the modern-rock Y-107
morning show, ``The Untitled Hardwick Cox Project,'' as news

LAW EXPERT SAYS HATE CRIMES LAWS ARE POINTLESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By NICOLE TSONG  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A leading expert on hate crimes said Tuesday that
felons should not be subjected to longer sentences because their
crimes stem from prejudice based on race, religion, gender, sexual
orientation, ethnicity or disability.
</P>
<P>
   James B. Jacobs, a New York University criminal law professor
and co-author of ``Hate Crimes: Criminal Law and Identity
Politics,'' said that it is ``really bizarre that two people are
beaten up and one crime is worse'' because of hate.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs, speaking at a policy forum sponsored by the Cato
Institute, a conservative think tank here, also said laws against
hate crimes are unnecessary because states and the federal
government already have statutes covering the offenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no law enforcement crisis calling out for these
laws,'' he said. ``All of these offenses ... are already a crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-nine states have laws that make it a crime to attack a
person based on race, religion, ethnic background, disability,
gender or sexual orientation. Most of these laws increase the
defendants' sentence if their attack was based on hate.
</P>
<P>
   Last month hate-crime victims and dozens of civic, church and
civil rights groups urged Congress to pass a bill making it a
federal crime to attack someone based on bias against gays, women,
or people with disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   But Jacobs argued that the definition of prejudice varies with
the statutes and that they can be ``counterproductive'' because
none of them covers all forms of hate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have some states, for example, that have (laws against)
racial and religious prejudice, but not homophobic prejudices,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Human Rights Campaign, the nation's largest gay
rights political group, 29 states do not have anti-gay-bashing
laws.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs said the movement for creating various categories of hate
crimes can pit interest groups against one another as each seeks
protection for itself.
</P>
<P>
   Also, he noted, people can commit crimes not because they hate
certain defined groups but because they hate individuals or such
categories of people as the wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   David Friedman, director of the Washington bureau of the
Anti-Defamation League, a New York-based civil rights group
fighting prejudice and discrimination, disagreed with Jacobs'
arguments.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman said there is no sign that the anti-hate-crime laws
have caused conflict among groups. The statutes, he said, actually
bring communities together.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that in Billings, Mont., someone in 1993 threw a brick
through a window that had a Menorah displayed in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people did not say this: `Oh, this is just a broken
window,''' Friedman said, adding that they ``cut out of their local
newspaper ... an image of a Hanukkah Menorah (and) put that image
in their windows.''
</P>
<P>
   Their action made a statement that such attacks will not be
tolerated, Friedman said.
</P>
<P>
   He argued that anti-hate-crime laws are needed because the
attacks they cover cause pain to a larger group of people than the
victims themselves. He cited a synagogue that was vandalized in a
Washington, D.C., suburb. The pain to Jewish people in the entire
area ``was palpable,'' he said.

   Their action made a statement that such attacks will not be
tolerated, Friedman said.
</P>
<P>
   He argued that anti-hate-crime laws are needed because the
attacks they cover cause pain to a larger group of people than the
victims themselves. He cited a synagogue that was vandalized in a
Washington, D.C., suburb. The pain to Jewish people in the entire
area ``was palpable,'' he said.

 &HT;    Would anyone read a book about 1930's ballgowns?
 &HT;    By Celestine Sibley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A writer friend of mine says when you're working on a book, some
of the best ideas you'll ever have come to you in the middle of the
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is that what I've been having, good ideas?'' I asked her. ``I
thought they were bad dreams.'' She said to keep a pencil and paper
handy, and when you awaken in the middle of the night, make haste
to jot down your dreams.
</P>
<P>
   My middle of the night dreams are less imaginative, less
creative than some writer's, I've decided. I dreamed I fell off the
ladder while washing the bedroom windows. That's good for a book? I
don't think so. I dreamed I was hungry, and awakened with my feet
on the floor, a start toward the refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   So far, no sizzling plots, no beguiling characterizations, have
come to me in dreams. When the glimmer of an idea hits me, I have
to go to the library or seek out an expert among my acquaintances.
Since I have been unnaturally interested in ballgowns for Mardi
Gras in Mobile(Ala.) in 1930, I have haunted the desk and
bookshelves of our fashion writer Marylin Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   The other day I asked Marylyn if French seamstresses are
superior to those in rural Alabama. I know their designers are
highly thought of, but when I was growing up, all women could sew,
some more skillfully than others, but anybody knew how to ply a
needle if the need arose. Our neighbor ``Miss Lily'' Myers would
have made a fortune if she had lived close to the market. She could
copy any garment she saw pictured in the Sears-Roebuck catalog or
the Mobile Register. And she never had a lesson. On my first trip
to New York _ $100 excursion with three other Mobile girls on the
Greyhound bus _ I was splendidly arrayed in costumes made for me by
Miss Lily. Could French seamstresses do as well _ or better?
</P>
<P>
   I asked Marylin, and she handed me one of her big books on the
subject. It's fascinating the amount of time, thought and prose
some people have put into clothes. The section on French clothes
was big and authoritative, and I didn't see anything I recognized
but the French seam, which in my day all girls were taught to make
when they were learning to sew. Plain, hidden and not chic by any
means. Certainly nothing to stand out on a Mobile Mardi Gras
ballgown.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is that I caught on to clothes late. I am somewhat
like my grandson, who is starting Georgia State University this
fall. ``Do you have enough clothes?'' I asked. He shrugged. He had
clearly given it no thought. He as going to register wearing blue
jeans out at the knees. Well, I know ragged blue jeans are
considered ``cool'' by the young, so why should I worry about them?
If you can wear holey blue jeans to college, my character's
preoccupation with a ballgown seems excessive. Except that was 1930
_ and I believe the young took clothes more seriously in those
days.
</P>
<P>
   World War II must have interrupted preoccupation with dress.
According to Marylin's book, the government started regulating how
long dresses could be, how full trousers, to save material.
Besides, there was nothing that surpassed a uniform for style and
glamour. I recall no hardship was involved in the government's
restrictions, except the loss of nylons. Even Hollywood stars who
came to town on bond-selling expeditions painted their legs and,
like the rest of us, saw the paint melt and run down in their shoes
on a hot day.
</P>
<P>
   But now ballgowns ... maybe I should take a nap and see if it's
true about dreams.

 &HT;    Sights galore at huge Texas fair
 &HT;    By Alan Patureau
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Colloquially called ``The Big One'' by residents of ``Big D,''
the State Fair of Texas will hold forth in Dallas from Sept. 25 to
Oct. 18, a mammoth event that fits the image of the biggest and
bragging-est state of the Lower 48.
</P>
<P>
   This fair boasts the tallest Ferris wheel (212 feet), the most
animals (10,000), the biggest IMAX screen (70 feet), the largest
crowd (3.5 million) and the tallest greeter, a 52-foot statue of
``Big Tex'' booming ``howdy, folks!''
</P>
<P>
   A highlight of this year's ``Puttin' on the Glitz'' theme will
be daily afternoon Coliseum shows by the Royal Lipizzaner
Stallions, 14 white horses performing spectacular leaps and
maneuvers in the style of the Spanish Riding School of Vienna.
</P>
<P>
   ``FutureVisions'' will be the main exhibit, a vast hall filled
with high-tech wonders such as a futuristic hospital operating room
and a display of high-definition TV sets. Other buildings will
feature shiny new cars and experimental vehicles, livestock shows,
IMAX films, exhibits of dinosaurs, doll houses, video games and
butterflies.
</P>
<P>
   There will be a nightly Starlight Parade through the park, with
lighted floats, marching bands and equestrian units. The midway
boasts 75 rides, including a new bumper car attraction called Carat
2000, with made-in-Paris cars and a kaleidoscope of colorful
lights. The Cotton Bowl, a focal point of the fairgrounds, will
offer college football games every Saturday, capped by the annual
``Red River Showdown'' Oct. 10 between the Universities of Texas
and Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   Two Texas-born stars will offer free 8 p.m. concerts, Clint
Black on Oct. 10 and LeAnn Rimes on Oct. 17, while the national
touring company of the recent Broadway version of ``Showboat''
plays nightly at 8 in the Music Hall; tickets are $30 to $70. A
popular free-flight bird show, ``Kings of the Wind,'' will be back
for a 10th year, with a new bird encounter area and a lorikeet
feeding aviary added.
</P>
<P>
   Tailor-made for families with children are attractions such as
``Alien Ballet,'' a gymnastics show set to music; ``Kid Fish,'' a
well-stocked fishing pond with child-sized poles; ``The Jamitors,''
a trash-drum band; and a birthing parlor addition to the Petting
Farm, where expectant nanny goats can be seen bringing their young
into the world.
</P>
<P>
   The fair is open daily from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m.; adults $9,
senior citizens and children under 4 feet tall $5, age 2 and under
free. Call 214-565-9931 or go to http://www.texfair.com.
</P>
<P>
   -- Fair enough: Dating to 1886, Fair Park is a 277-acre art deco
complex two miles east of downtown Dallas off I-30. It draws crowds
year round to the big Steam Railroad Museum; the Hall of State,
with murals, statuary and historical exhibits; the Dallas Museum of
Natural History; the Dallas Aquarium; the Science Place, filled
with hands-on exhibits for children and adults; the Dallas Civic
Garden; and the Music Hall, home of the Dallas Opera and concerts.
</P>
<P>
   -- Sightseeing: Dallas has finally acknowledged that its biggest
tourist attraction is the former Texas School Book Depository in
Dealey Plaza, where Lee Harvey Oswald allegedly fired the shots
that killed President John F. Kennedy. Called simply the Sixth
Floor, it's a multimedia museum with audio guide. Adults $8, senior
citizens and children $7. Call 214-747-6660 or go to
http://www.jfk.org.

 &HT;    He should be at Hillary's knees
 &HT;    By Maureen Downey
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Post crowned a photo of a downcast Hillary Rodham
Clinton on Tuesday with the damning headline ``HUMILIATED.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite such widespread catcalls, the first lady shouldn't be
embarrassed. She should be enraged. And not at Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   History will judge whether Bill Clinton proves a good president.
But the jury's already in on whether he's a good husband.
</P>
<P>
   The galoot cheated on his wife under their own roof with a young
woman not much older than daughter Chelsea, sputtered at the
allegations and then encouraged Hillary to hoist a megaphone in his
defense.
</P>
<P>
   It's plain Hillary loves the lout, despite his chronic failure
to keep his executive privilege under wraps. While he was buying
``Leaves of Grass'' for Monica Lewinsky, Hillary should have
thumbed through ``Smart Women, Foolish Choices.''
</P>
<P>
   The beltway bench warmers maintain that Hillary Clinton is too
sharp to have bought her husband's innocence. I disagree. If she
doubted him, she's far too bright to have voiced such a strong and
public stand on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Women are willing to accept that Hillary intends to stand by her
man again. It's just that they don't believe Bill should be
standing tall next to her.
</P>
<P>
   He should be on his knees _ begging for forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   He was her choice _ ours, too
</P>
<P>
   By Bo Emerson
</P>
<P>
   c. 1998 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   I don't buy the idea that Hillary Clinton was fooled about her
husband's peccadilloes. Hillary knew what she was getting when she
picked Bill Clinton. And so did we.
</P>
<P>
   We'd already had a faithful, Sunday school-teaching president
whose affairs were only in his heart. But pure-as-the-driven-snow
Jimmy Carter didn't keep us from humiliation overseas and a 17
percent prime interest rate.
</P>
<P>
   As if to underscore the point that private conduct does not
predict the ability to govern, we elected the allegedly
philandering Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The result: a booming economy and a balanced budget.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night he told us just what we wanted to hear, which
was as little as possible. Like an aggrieved spouse, we didn't want
the details. We just wanted him to say he was sorry.
</P>
<P>
   Now the pundits are descending like a cloud of magpies, claiming
that Hillary's bargain with Bill is a deal with the devil, that she
coolly looks the other way to continue to enjoy the perks of the
office.
</P>
<P>
   Hogwash. Though it was a craven move on Clinton's part to invoke
the sanctity of the family when he clearly doesn't respect the
institution himself, the irrefutable fact remains: We can't judge
their relationship. We don't have the facts and we never will.
</P>
<P>
   If Hillary chooses to forgive, that's up to her. And before we
disrespect her for her decision, we should look at ourselves.
Because we chose him too.

 &HT;    Estrogen won't cut risks for older heart patients
 &HT;    By Patricia Guthrie
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Hormone therapy does not help older women suffering
from coronary disease, concludes a major study that gives the most
definitive answers yet on estrogen's effect on women's hearts.
</P>
<P>
   Called the Heart and Estrogen/progestin Replacement Study, or
HERS,, the research found that treatment with the hormones _
estrogen plus progestin _ did not reduce the overall rate of heart
attacks or death in post-menopausal women who had already suffered
heart attacks, clogged arteries, stroke or other heart problems. In
fact, hormones appear to increase the risk of heart attack in the
first year of treatment, then decrease it after several years of
therapy, the four-year data shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hormone therapy did not overall change the outcome for women
taking it. There was basically no effect,'' said Dr. Nanette
Wenger, professor of medicine at Emory University(Ga.) and chief of
cardiology at Atlanta's Grady Memorial Hospital. ``This is very
important information.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a landmark study because it's the first really scientific
study of women randomly assigned to take hormones,'' said Wenger,
who conducted a portion of the study at Emory. ``Many physicians
were recommending hormone replacement therapy for cardiac
protection based on the previous observational studies.''
</P>
<P>
   Those observational studies, which looked at large groups of
women who chose to take hormones, concluded that estrogen decreased
the risk of heart disease 35 percent to 50 percent in
post-menopausal women, compared to women who did not take hormones.
But it remained unclear whether hormones were protecting women
against certain diseases or whether the women were healthier
because they exercised more, did not smoke and ate less fat than
women who did not take hormones.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers cautioned against applying findings from the study,
published in today's Journal of the American Medical Association,
to healthy women who may be taking hormones. Many women take
estrogen to ease symptoms of menopause, including hot flashes and
night sweats, but the choice is a difficult one because long-term
effects are unproved.
</P>
<P>
   Observational studies also have suggested that healthy women who
take estrogen may lower their risks of developing heart disease and
osteoporosis, the bone-thinning disease. Estrogen also may have
some benefits for preventing Alzheimer's disease, but research
suggests hormones could raise risks of endometrial and breast
cancers.
</P>
<P>
   Definitive answers for healthy women won't come until 2005, with
completion of the Women's Health Initiative, the largest study ever
undertaken on American women's health. Emory also is participating
in that study.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, women need to continue discussing with their doctors
the risks and benefits of taking hormone replacement therapy,
researchers emphasized. ``This study doesn't say anything about any
other hormone regimen or anything about how healthy women are
affected,'' Wenger said. ``It's confusing, we realize that. This
provides us with an answer, but it also raises more questions that
still have to be answered.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on the HERS findings, researchers recommend that women
with heart disease not begin hormone replacement therapy solely to
protect themselves from further coronary disease. However, they
also emphasized that women already taking hormones should not stop
such treatment because the benefits may kick in over time.
</P>
<P>
   The study also verified negative effects of taking hormones
suggested by observational studies: gallbladder disease and an
increased risk of blood clots in the legs or lungs.

   That's because of the unexpected findings of a national study
looking at hormone replacement therapy on postmenopausal women with
heart disease. Officially released today, the clinical trial found
estrogen and progestin did not have the protective benefit on their
cardiovascular system that had long been assumed. ``I had expected
to find out that hormonal replacement therapy would help you
against further heart disease,'' said Winecoff, 75, and one of 112
Atlanta-area women who participated in the Heart and
Estrogen/progestin Replacement Study, or HERS, study. ``I might
have started it. My doctor and I had discussed that, and we were
waiting for these results. But I'm not going to do that now. I
don't think it will do much good.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on the study, researchers now are advising doctors not to
prescribe hormones to women such as Winecoff, who suffered a major
heart attack six years ago and had never taken any artificial
hormones following menopause at age 48.
</P>
<P>
   However, women already taking such therapy with the hope that
it's helping their heart should not discontinue estrogen because
it's known to have other benefits, such as staving off
osteoporosis, and it appears to have long-term positive cardiac
effects, states an editorial in today's Journal of the American
Medical Association. Those women should discuss hormone therapy
with their doctors, but that discussion isn't urgent, the editorial
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The HERS results are important for women to consider in making
decisions about hormone replacement. Physicians need to review
carefully the HERS findings, but no woman, including those with
coronary disease, should abruptly cease use,'' writes Dr. Diana B.
Petitti of Kaiser Permanente Southern California research
department. ``Discussions of the HERS findings between women and
their physicians do not need to occur today, this week, or even
this month. HERS identifies no new risks, and there is no
emergency.''
</P>
<P>
   Winecoff, of Buckhead, was among the group of women taking an
inactive pill, or placebo, whose health was compared to those in a
comparable group of women taking Prempo, one of the most widely
prescribed estrogen-progestin oral medications. She was followed by
doctors and staff at Emory University and Grady Memorial Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The study involved 2,763 women in 20 sites. The Atlanta-area
participants are to be treated to a luncheon today on the Emory
campus to thank them for their contributions to science and women's
health.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think these women are heroines,'' said Dr. Nanette Wenger,
Emory professor of medicine and chief of cardiology at Grady
hospital. ``They were sick but they volunteered to participate, to
take medicine without knowing what it was, for the benefit of
future generations.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither researchers nor the women knew who received the hormone
pills in the randomized trial. However, participant Lee Caronia
said that, for her, it wasn't hard to figure out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew within three weeks (of beginning the unknown pills)
that I was taking hormones, ''said Caronia, 70, who suffered a
major heart attack 15 years ago. ``If you haven't had a period in
10 years years and suddenly you do, then you know.''
</P>
<P>
   Caronia didn't like going back to using sanitary pads, so she
asked to discontinue the hormonal therapy. To her surprise, the
Snellville resident said she wasn't dropped from the study but kept
on because researchers seemed interested in how she was handling
her post-heart attack health.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very interested in my condition and the HERS staff
seemed very interested, too,'' she said. ``I had always thought
women were second-class citizens when it came to heart conditions.
Doctors didn't seem to take our heart disease as seriously as
men.''
</P>
<P>
   After seeing the results delivered to her door Tuesday morning,
Caronia said she's glad she stopped taking the hormones. But she
added: ``I really think its a very personal decision for each
woman. Every one has to come up with their own conclusion about the
risks and benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the findings: Those taking the hormones experienced a
nearly 50 percent increase of heart attack during the study's first
year. But by the fourth year of treatment, women taking the drug
had a 40 percent reduction in heart attack risk.
</P>
<P>
   Reasons for the initial heart trouble are unclear. The gradual
improvement could be because it takes about one or two years for
estrogen to reduce cholesterol levels, which can trigger heart
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The $40 million HERS study was funded by Wyeth-Ayerst Research,
the makers of Prempo. An observational follow-up study on the women
is planned to see if the beneficial trend seen during the trial's
last two years continues.

 &HT;    Hormonal replacement therapy for heart disease may not be the
best course of action
 &HT;    By Patricia Guthrie

   Eleonore Winecoff waited four years for a prescription that
turned out too good to be true.
</P>

smart remedies.

 &HT;    Singer, now a surrvivor, is making a name for himself
 &HT;    By Miriam Longino
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nashville --This sunny Tennessee afternoon, singer T. Graham
Brown is standing in the kitchen of his home high in the hills
above Nashville, making a tomato and mayonnaise sandwich. At 43,
his face is still boyish, framing a devilish smile and the piercing
blue eyes that could charm a meter maid out of a ticket. He still
wears a let's-party Hawaiian shirt, though the shaggy hair has
turned gray. One other thing is different for this former
chart-topping country music star and Athens, Georgia frat band
legend: When he pours his drink into a plastic tumbler, he's not
putting vodka in it anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Brown is a man poised for a second chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It got real bad,'' he says. ``It was one big ol' rolling
party. It was great. I was young and strong and I could do it back
then. But it got to the point that I was getting up and pouring me
a drink first thing in the morning. I just got sucked in. I knew
what I was doing, but I said hey, I don't have a problem. Then God
got my attention.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 25 years he's been belting out his soulful sound _ first
in the Sam and Dave-inspired Athens party duo Dirk &AMP; Tony, then as
a bad-assed Southern rocker and, ultimately, as a hit-making
country music star _ Brown has been a survivor. Now, after a career
that stalled and crashed in a sea of partying, alcohol and changing
musical tastes, he's releasing his first album in seven years,
appropriately titled ``Wine Into Water.'' The title song, a
gut-wrenching anthem Brown wrote ``to get it all out of my
system,'' was released to radio Monday.
</P>
<P>
   At the high point of his career in the '80s, the Athens native
had a string of top Nashville hits such as ``Hell and High Water,''
``Don't Go To Strangers'' and ``Don't Go Out,'' a duet with Tanya
Tucker, who today calls Brown ``one of the best voices in country
music.'' In the 1970s, long before R.E.M. or the B-52s, Brown was
perhaps the most popular musical act in Athens, throwing back shots
of whiskey as UGA students partied hard to songs like ``Double Shot
of My Baby's Love.'' Athens producer John Keane (R.E.M., 10,000
Maniacs), who played guitar in Brown's country/rock band Reo
Diamond in 1980, recalls that Brown ``was the top draw in town'' at
that time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony was pretty wild,'' Keane says. ``One of his claims to
fame is he would open a bottle of Wild Turkey at the beginning of
the set and strum it like a guitar. By the end of the night, the
bottle was empty.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown's real fame came in a most unlikely role: as a pitch man.
In the late '80s, the fast food chain Taco Bell tapped him to sing
and star in the company's new ad campaign. The widely aired
television commercials _ raucous, technicolor spots in which Brown
drove across the nations screen in a convertible growling ``run for
the border'' _ made him a household face at the end of the Reagan
era.
</P>
<P>
   But by 1991, Brown's career stalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll never forget it,'' he says with a laugh. ``I was on
Capitol, and they had just brought in (legendary producer) Jimmy
Bowen. He had me over to the mansion for lunch, and told me `you
are the flagship of this label. We're gonna make beautiful music
together'.''
</P>
<P>
   Then came Garth.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the pep talk from Bowen, Capitol's newest artist,
Garth Brooks, won his first Country Music Association award. At the
party following the ceremonies, Brown remembers watching Brooks
walk in ``with his big white hat and long tails.'' Although he says
Bowen quipped that Brooks was ``just a flash in the pan,'' Brown
didn't realize that a revolution was taking place that would put
his career on the shelf. Soon, every label in town was looking for
a hat act, leaving little room for artists like Brown who were
churning out country blues.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden, nothing was happening,'' he recalls. ``They
put $80,000 into a new video, but they weren't working the
record.''
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated at the lack of support, Brown left his $900,000 deal
with Capitol and signed with Warner Bros. In his first meeting with
label execs, they had one request: Wear a cowboy hat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said `you got to be kidding. I don't wear a hat. That's not
who I am'.''
</P>
<P>
   It went downhill from there. Brown describes those years this
way: ``I was mad and I was drunk.'' As his record sales dropped,
Brown turned up the burner on his partying lifestyle. One of his
closest drinking buddies was country singer Keith Whitley, who
later died of acute alcohol poisoning. It was the start of a
wake-up call for Brown, who checked himself into the Cumberland
Heights recovery center in Nashville for one day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a real strong will, and I thought I could just quit,''
he says. ``Then I joined a group of alcoholics and drug addicts
that met every Monday right on Music Row, and I knew every one of
'em. But we were all still drinking, and it was expensive, so I
dropped out and kept right on.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown's parents, Royce and Jackie, who live in Commerce, had no
idea what was going on.
</P>
<P>
   ``He kept it hid pretty much,'' Jackie says. ``We never had any
inkling. We've always been a tight-knit family, but sometimes they
can wander away from that. Life on the road is very hard, we
understand that. I'm just thankful he realized in time that life's
too short not to enjoy each day.''
</P>
<P>
   The turning point came in 1994, when son Acme, now 9, was rushed
to the hospital for emergency surgery. Brown's wife, Sheila, a
University of Georgia student who married the singer in 1980, asked
him not to come to the hospital. She sat down and wrote her husband
an eight-page letter, pouring out her heart in concern over what he
had become, and how he was missing the opportunity to reach his
potential and watch his child grow up.
</P>
<P>
   Hung over, Brown read the letter and was shaken to his soul. He
hasn't had a drink since. ``All of a sudden, I felt a lot of
passion. I was able to sing all kind of ways, and it made me happy
inside. My soul was happy,'' he says of the months following the
intervention.
</P>
<P>
   Brown continued to tour, and made the decision with Sheila to
stick it out in Nashville in spite of the fickle musical climate.
The couple dipped into their savings in order for Brown to record
demos in his home studio. ``I believe in him,'' Sheila says.
``Everyone says he has one of the best voices in Nashville, but
he's not a cookie-cutter hat act. He doesn't sound like everybody
else.''
</P>
<P>
   One demo Brown cut two years ago is the song ``Wine Into
Water.'' It's a deeply personal tune, with lyrics that cut to the
heart of the matter:
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight I'm as low as any man can go/I'm down and I can't fall
much farther/Once upon a time you turned the water into wine/But
now on my knees I'm turning to your Father/Could you help me turn
the wine back into water.''
</P>
<P>
   The song caught the attention of executivesat the new Nashville
label, Intersound, who signed Brown to a deal.
</P>
<P>
   How likely is a comeback?
</P>
<P>
   Neil McGinley, operations manager for Atlanta's two country
radio stations, Kicks 101.5 and Y-106.7, says, ``I think anybody
can come back. Randy Travis and John Anderson are perfect examples.
Obviously, T. has talent. I think the new stuff is great. What you
have with these guys is that they all sound somewhat unique, their
singing styles and their voices. So many of the acts now all sound
and look alike; you can't tell one from the other. Sometimes the
pendulum does swing 180 degrees in the other direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown and his family seem deeply committed to the new project,
but exude an even more profound determination for a sober and
spiritual lifestyle. In the evenings, as the sun sets over the
rolling Tennessee hills, they often sit in a wooden swing
overlooking the lush bottom land of the Harpeth River.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call it our prayer swing,'' Sheila says. ``I guess you can
figure out what we do in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown talks like a man at peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``People our age are coming to a crossroads. Either you're gonna
keep living like that, or you're gonna get healthy. Really, that's
the only choice.''

   Comedy Central's new show goes to the edge
</P>
<P>
   By Bob Longinoc. 1998 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   Comedy Central's got the groove.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight it begins a new season of the outrageous ``South Park''
(10 p.m. EDT) and then launches the even more bizarre ``Upright
Citizens Brigade'' (10:30 p.m. EDT).
</P>
<P>
   ``UCB'' (as we're sure the requisite fan T-shirts will be
labeled in the days to come) is an outlandish long-form sketch
comedy show that's the kind of demented, well-executed programming
you want to see on Public Access Television but never do.
</P>
<P>
   It's decidedly original and certifiably sick. Wickedly funny,
too.
</P>
<P>
   ``UCB'' comes from a Chicago-bred comedy troupe. Their show
motto: ``Our enemy is the status quo; our only friend is chaos.''
Tonight's first 30-minute sketch introduces a small band of
space-flying geeks who do everything in their power to wreak havoc
on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine ``Mystery Science Theater 3000'' on speed.
</P>
<P>
   First, there's a pesky Bucket of Truth _ actually a white
plastic mop pail. The only thing known about the darned bucket is
this: ``whoever shall look into the bucket shall know unmitigated,
unadulterated, immutable truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like the quick route to madness, no?
</P>
<P>
   ``UCB's'' victims act wacko from the get-go. There's Capt.
Lunatic, the stressed-out cop, who curses God through clenched
teeth while hunting the world's notorious Bong Boy, a pot-smoking
dude who strangely shows up wherever tragedy strikes.
</P>
<P>
   There's Lunatic's 29-year-old ``high-on-life'' son Leonard,
whose ruminations spill from his fried brain. ``Daddy,'' he wonders
in spazspeak, ``how come at night when you put the barrel of your
gun in your mouth it makes you cry?''
</P>
<P>
   And there's Cassie, the girl scout, who while out selling
cookies winds up playing campout in the living room of the
Unabomber. ``Once I made a handpuppet out of an old sock and
macaroni,'' Cassie says. Her laughing playmate's reply: ``I once
blew off a man's hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Their adventures are fiendishly twisted and delivered in
non-stop, triple-shot-espresso comedy riffs.
</P>
<P>
   Many might call this edgy. Their half right.
</P>
<P>
   ``UCB'' does head straight for the edge. Then gleefully jumps
right off.

&HT;        RESIGN OR BE IMPEACHED, LEHIGH VALLEY LAWMAKER SAYS
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Paul Kane  
 &HT;    c. 1998 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Aug. 18 -- A House member from the Lehigh Valley has
become one of the first congressmen -- Republican or Democrat -- to
publicly call for President Clinton to resign from office or face
the harrowing prospect of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   As most Democrats tried to rally around the White House and
Republicans urged caution amid waiting for an impeachment report,
Rep. Paul McHale, D-Bethlehem, announced Tuesday he could no longer
support Clinton remaining in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   McHale, who served about five years in the Marine Corps and is
still a reserve officer, said he believed the president perjured
himself and ``almost certainly'' attempted to obstruct justice by
buying Monica Lewinsky's silence with job offers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perjury is not excused by an apology compelled by overwhelming
evidence and delivered under pressure,'' he said, adding: ``We
could spare the country a great deal of pain by abandoning the rule
of law. That's too high a price. With great sadness, I have
concluded that President Clinton should resign or face
impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   McHale's pronouncement does not carry a whole lot of political
weight on Capitol Hill -- he is a six-year House veteran who is
retiring at the end of the year -- but it was a bombshell just
because he's the first Democrat to publicly denounce Clinton.
McHale is not a member of the House Judiciary Committee, which
would take up any impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Most Democrats, however, fell in line with Clinton's call to
``turn away from the spectacle of the past seven months.'' Said
House Democratic Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo.: ``It is my most
fervent hope that this investigation can be brought to its long
overdue conclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Rep. Chaka Fattah, D-Phila., who had said all along that he
believed Clinton's original denials of a sexual relationship with
Clinton, does not think Clinton should suffer from an impeachment
proceeding based on perjury.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that's at the basis of all this, I think it's an
embarrassment to (Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr) and the
Republican Party,'' Fattah said.
</P>
<P>
   Since he is retiring from Congress, McHale is much more free to
speak his mind without any fear of retribution from the party
leadership. McHale could not be reached to further explain to his
decision, but speculation focused on his background with the
Marines -- the most rigid of all the services in its ``code of
honor'', including a tough anti-adultery and anti-lying policy.
</P>
<P>
   McHale served active duty from 1972 to 1974 and again in 1990
and 1991, when he resigned his seat from the state legislature to
reenlist for duty in the Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   He was at one time considered in the running to be secretary of
the Navy, but has apparently been ruled out by the Clinton
administration. Tuesday's comments will do little to endear him to
the White House, which said nothing would distract Clinton. ``He
said it's time to get back to the country's business, and that's
what he intends to do,'' said Kara Gerhardt, spokeswoman for
Clinton, who left Tuesday for two weeks vacation in Martha's
Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., however, noted that McHale's call for
Clinton to resign was noteworthy because it came from a fellow
moderate Democrat, and could not be discredited as a partisan
attack.
</P>
<P>
   And Specter said Clinton's extraordinary address to the nation
Monday night ``had all the earmarks of deception.'' Because Clinton
will not answer questions about specific sexual acts he had with
Lewinsky, Specter said, it becomes difficult to determine if
committed perjury when he testified that he never had ``sexual
relations'' with her.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to analyze what he says very, very closely,'' he
said.

LOUISIANA TEACHER SENTENCED TO LIFE IN PRISON IN HOUSTON SLAYING

<P>
   HOUSTON _ A Louisiana schoolteacher who closely followed the
O.J. Simpson case was sentenced to life in prison late Monday for
killing a Houston man that his estranged wife was dating.
</P>
<P>
   The sentencing of Roy Neal Shelling, 30, in the Nov. 30, 1997,
slaying of Carlos L. McMahon, 23, means that Shelling will not be
eligible for parole for at least 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   The body of McMahon, who worked at a local optical business, was
found by Shelling's estranged wife and a friend at his southeast
Houston apartment one day after his murder.
</P>
<P>
   McMahon's throat had been cut and he had been shot five times
and stabbed numerous times.
</P>
<P>
   One of the stranger aspects to the case, said prosecutor Vic
Wisner, was Shelling's intense curiosity about the criminal trial
of Simpson, the ex-football star and actor who was acquitted of
criminal charges in 1996 in the slayings of his former wife, Nicole
Simpson, and her friend Ronald Goldman.
</P>
<P>
   Shelling would videotape the televised Simpson trial during the
day and then watch the court proceedings late into the night,
according to testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some eerie similarities to the O.J. case,'' Wisner
said. ``Part of our theory was that he was very possessive of his
estranged wife and had threatened to harm anybody he ever caught
her with. We don't know if he modeled the crime after the O.J. case
consciously or unconsciously, or at all. But there are some
similarities.''
</P>
<P>
   Jealous confrontations, the fact that McMahon's throat was cut
and his numerous stab wounds were factors that mirrored the Simpson
case, Wisner said.
</P>
<P>
   Shelling also tried to have an alibi in place and left town
immediately after the murder, Wisner said. Shelling, who taught
elementary school, was later arrested in Louisiana. He also
disposed of the knife and gun used in the murder, and authorities
found no clothing that might have been stained with blood.
</P>
<P>
   Wisner said Shelling and his wife, a local school teacher, once
lived in Houston together. But when they split, the defendant moved
to Monroe, La., where other members of his family also work as
educators.
</P>
<P>
   The woman started dating McMahon, and Shelling promised he would
kill anyone he caught her with, according to testimony. Before the
murder, Shelling had already confronted a man he thought had left a
phone message for his wife. The message had actually been left by
McMahon, and Shelling intercepted it and went to the school where
his wife worked and confronted her with it.
</P>
<P>
   During the Thanksgiving 1997 holiday, Shelling and his wife went
to Chicago together and he asked her to reconcile with him, Wisner
said. But she told him it wasn't going to work.
</P>
<P>
   After they returned from the trip, Shelling told his wife he was
going back to Louisiana. But instead he went to McMahon's
apartment, according to testimony. After McMahon's attack, the wife
saw her husband driving away from the complex. She left and called
police.
</P>
<P>
   Officers knocked on the door that night and left after getting
no answer or spotting anything suspicious, Wisner said. The next
day police returned after Shelling's wife found McMahon's body.
</P>
<P>
   Wisner said forensic evidence indicated that McMahon was already
dying of the gunshot wounds when his throat was cut.
</P>
<P>
   A fingerprint from Shelling's pinky finger was found on a
compact disc case that was sitting on a kitchen ledge above the
body, Wisner said.

   FEATURE STORIES
</P>
<P>
   TANGLEWOOD-FESTIVAL (Lenox, Mass.) _ Tanglewood is, to be sure,
many things: first and foremost, a festival and retreat of the
Boston Symphony Orchestra here in the idyllic Berkshire Hills. So
when several respected teachers at the orchestra's venerable
training institute, the Tanglewood Music Center, loudly and angrily
resigned late last year in response to a redirection of the
center's activities by Seiji Ozawa, the longtime music director of
the Boston Symphony, it was not clear how much the average
festivalgoer's experience would be affected, if at all. By James R.
Oestreich. Photo.

<P>
   THEATER
</P>
<P>
   STUPID-KIDS-THEATER (New York) _ Written by John C. Russell, who
died of AIDS in 1994 at the age of 31, ``Stupid Kids'' opened Off
Broadway in June to a shaky start at the WPA Theater, where it
received several mixed reviews, with some critics complaining of a
thin story. Still, the 80-minute play, directed by Michael Mayer,
seemed to be finding its legs just as it closed in July. Now it has
been given another chance. It begins a commercial run on Tuesday at
the Century Theater with a gilt-edged pack of producers behind it.

<P>
   FILM AND VIDEO
</P>
<P>
   TEA-WITH-MUSSOLINI-FILM (Rome) _ ``Tea with Mussolini,'' which
is being directed by Franco Zeffirelli this summer in Rome and
Florence, is based on his memories of wartime and the years just
before, when he was an illegitimate, motherless young Florentine.
It's a homage to a group of eccentric English ladies who
essentially adopted him, and who tried to preserve their own
civility and Florence's treasures as war closed in around them. By
Alessandra Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   MOVIES-CRITICS (Undated) _ For better and worse, critics find
themselves integral to the process of promoting movies, and there
are times when we gratefully seize that opportunity. Consider
``Western,'' a beguiling, offbeat French film that I adore. By
Janet Maslin.
</P>
<P>
   CLASSICAL
</P>
<P>
   MUSIC-PLACE (Undated) _ If home is indeed where the heart is,
then the repertory in which a musician feels most at home may have
more to do with aptitude and sympathy than with where that musician
was born or lives. Yet sometimes a relationship between geography
and music holds true, and two new piano recordings, by Stephen
Hough and Leif Ove Andsnes, make a persuasive case for the power of
place. By David Mermelstein.
</P>
<P>
   RAKE'S-PROGRESS-OPERA (Undated) _ Igor Stravinsky was a slow
worker. He produced, on average, one major composition, or an
equivalent number of smaller ones, per year. Of course, he lived
many years, from 1882 to 1971, and produced many works, about 100,
though only a handful run longer than a half-hour. The longest by
far is his only full-length opera, ``The Rake's Progress.'' Each of
its three acts took a year to compose. By Anthony Tommasini.
</P>
<P>
   POP MUSIC
</P>
<P>
   ELLIOTT-SMITH-MUSIC (Undated) _ ``Everybody's dying just to get
the disease,'' sang Elliott Smith about the perils of fame in
``Pictures of Me,'' one of the most memorable pop songs of last
year. It appeared on ``Either/Or,'' Smith's third album, and it was
a startlingly advanced report of dissaffection sung in a high voice
by a slouchy 27-year-old Beatles fan from Portland, Ore., with a
pallid, wounded demeanor. By Ben Ratliff.
</P>
<P>
   LAURYN-HILL-MUSIC (Undated) _ On her solo debut album, ``The
Miseducation of Lauryn Hill,'' the rapper, singer and visionary
artist Lauryn Hill imagines herself as part of a very old story. It
transcends her own 23-year-old life, as stimulating as that may be
with the success of her hip-hop group, the Fugees, her highly
promising career as a musician and producer and her personal
happiness mothering a baby boy. By Ann Powers.
</P>
<P>
   TELEVISION
</P>
<P>
   PRINCESS-PEOPLE-TV (Undated) _ With Britain bracing itself for a
relentless barrage of Princess-Diana-related television programming
in the next few weeks, it is not surprising that ``The Princess's
People,'' one of the shows on offer, has generated a bit of
unflattering advance publicity. Maybe because it shows, among other
things, Londoners swearing at the television set during the
broadcast of the Princess of Wales's funeral last year. By Sarah
Lyall. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MIND-TRAVELER-TV (Undated) _ A four-part PBS series called
``Oliver Sacks: The Mind Traveler,'' begins Tuesday at 8 p.m. _
stories of people with autism or total color-blindness or Usher's
syndrome, another rare genetic condition, in which a person is born
deaf and then gradually goes blind in young adulthood. By Natalie
Angier.
</P>
<P>
   ART
</P>
<P>
   BAY-BRIDGE-ARCHITECTURE (San Francisco) _ When it comes to
bridge designers practicing in the world today, there's the Spanish
architect and engineer Santiago Calatrava and there's everyone
else. Isn't that awful? This fact has certainly lent an air of
independence, if not futility, to San Francisco's search for a new
design for the Bay Bridge. Why should Bay area residents settle for
genius and deprive themselves of the freedom to choose something
second rate? By Herbert Muschamp.

MARKET ADVANCES BROADLY ON SURGING TECH STOCKS, OVERSEAS RALLIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also ECON-REPORT) 
(JT) 
 By SHARON R. KING    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Led by a surge in technology shares, rallies overseas
and investor relief over a reprieve in the Monica Lewinsky scandal,
U.S. stocks rose for a second day Tuesday and helped the major
indexes erase most of the wrenching declines suffered over the
previous two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Although the market remains substantially below the highs
reached a month ago, analysts said investors apparently were
heeding reports pointing out how a wide array of stocks had fallen
to relatively cheap levels.
</P>
<P>
   The buying spree lifted the Dow Jones industrial average 139.80
points, a 1.6 percent gain, to 8,714.65, after a 1.8 percent gain
Monday. American Express, Sears, Roebuck, International Business
Machines, Hewlett-Packard and Aluminum Co. of America each added
more than 10 points to the blue chip gauge, as 16 of Dow's 30
stocks ended higher.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-company index rose 17.53 points, to
1,101.20, also a 1.6 percent increase. Microsoft, General Electric
and Pfizer led the advance.
</P>
<P>
   Led by strong gains among such bellwether technology issues as
Microsoft, Intel, Cisco and Dell, the Nasdaq composite index fared
better. The key technology barometer rose 37.06 points, a 2 percent
gain.
</P>
<P>
   Investors also felt more confident buying shares because
political uncertainty surrounding President Clinton had eased
considerably after he admitted during grand jury testimony on
Monday to having an ``inappropriate'' relationship with Ms.
Lewinsky, a former White House intern. In addition, the market's
nervousness was soothed by Russia's devaluation of its currency on
Monday, ending speculation about what steps that country would take
to avert an economic collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Stock markets in Europe were strongly higher, reflecting
investor optimism that Russia had taken decisive action, and the
momentum from those gains were felt on Wall Street when trading
began.
</P>
<P>
   Germany's benchmark equity index rose 3.1 percent to its highest
level in four months. Stocks gained more than 3 percent on London,
Amsterdam, and Paris exchanges. In Japan, stocks rose nearly 2
percent, erasing most of Monday's loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prices have reached attractive levels and cash has built up
and all of that conspired to get us to buy stocks,'' said Hugh
Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany Corp.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he said, ``the stage of being very alarmed about
Russia and Asia may be behind us.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors' renewed confidence in the market also helped smaller
company shares erase nearly all of last week's declines.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2,000 index of smaller company stocks rose 7.33
points, to 411.29 points, a 1.8 percent gain.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Skytel Communications, the Russell's leading gainer,
rose 5 points to 18 5/8 after the company announced that AT&AMP;T will
sell its nationwide paging services.
</P>
<P>
   The buying Tuesday was more broad-based than the previous
session, when the gains were largely confined to big stocks.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday investors ``stuck their toe in the water,'' said
Richard Cripps, chief market strategist at Legg Mason Inc. in
Baltimore. But Tuesday, he said, `'they were more willing to go
into small and mid-cap names.''
</P>
<P>
   He pointed to shares of United Rentals, a small equipment
leasing firm. This week, both Legg Mason and Salomon Smith Barney
recommended the stock to investors, pointing out that it had fallen
almost 40 percent from its high of $48 on July 20. Tuesday, United
Rentals closed at 32 7/8, up 3 7/8. Prior to Tuesday, individual
investors showed little interest in those shares, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, technology shares, financial services companies,
telecommunications companies and drug stocks were among the leading
gainers.
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange advancing issues outnumbered
declines by more than 2 to 1.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these gains, analysts remained cautious in their outlook
and and said investors were primarily seeking out shares of
companies that appear to have a relatively clear picture of future
earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Another sign of investors' defensive stance was a strong flow of
cash into large company stock funds, particularly index funds, said
AMG Data Services, a California research firm that tracks mutual
fund trends.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Adler, president of AMG, said these funds accounted for
the bulk of the $1.5 billion that flowed into equity mutual funds,
more than three times as much as in the previous week, AMG said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Adler, AMG Data's president. said the bulk of the cash
went into large stock growth and income funds, including index
funds.
</P>
<P>
   First Albany's Johnson said his recent buying was limited to
shares of Pepsi-Cola as he continued to hold a large number of
consumer staple stocks, which he believes will provide dependable
earnings regardless of market conditions.
</P>
<P>
   His holdings include drug stocks such as Merck, consumer
products companies like Procter &AMP; Gamble and food companies like
Sara Lee. He also likes larger technology companies such as Dell,
IBM and Compaq.

   Following are excerpts from newspaper editorials and columns on
President Clinton's statement Monday night about his relationship
with Monica Lewinsky:
</P>
<P>
   The New York Post
</P>
<P>
   ``I misled people,'' the president said. No, he didn't mislead
people. He lied to them. By using the word ``misled'' instead of
the word ``lied,'' the president lied to the American people.
Again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was,'' he said, ``very concerned about protecting my
family.'' The man who allows his wife to go on the ``Today'' show
to defend him against the charge that he had an extramarital affair
he did have was not concerned about protecting her. He was
concerned with protecting his presidency. By speaking those words,
he lied to the American people.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Daily News
</P>
<P>
   Column by Lars-Erik Nelson
</P>
<P>
   Yes, we could once say, he probably did it, but we don't care.
Now we know beyond any doubt that he did it _ that the president
had sex in the White House with a 21-year-old intern. Do we still
not care?
</P>
<P>
   Do we not care that our president lied to us for seven months
and allowed his closest friends and administration officials,
unwittingly, to lie for him?
</P>
<P>
   Up to now, polls have shown Clinton enjoying job-approval levels
of up to 70 percent. But that was when the Lewinsky affair was only
an accusation. Now we get our noses rubbed in it.
</P>
<P>
   The Helena Independent Record
</P>
<P>
   Montana
</P>
<P>
   OK. So President Bill Clinton has changed his tune, admitting an
improper sexual relationship with a White House intern less than
half his age, but denying any obstruction of justice or other
wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Big deal. In a sense, it doesn't really matter what if anything
President Clinton has to say on the subject of Monica Lewinsky.
When it comes to Clinton and women, most of us already have made up
our mind, and by now the president's protestations are about the
last thing to change it. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens in the end, Clinton will be remembered as a
president lucky enough to have served during prosperous economic
times, a president whose progressive policies were increasingly
undermined as much by his move to the center and beyond as by his
declining credibility and a president who shamed his wife and
daughter and his party and the people of the United States by his
mind-bendingly reckless inability to keep it in his pants.
</P>
<P>
   The San Jose Mercury News
</P>
<P>
   California
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has dishonored the presidency. He has diminished his
stature as a leader. He has damaged the trust that unites the
people who form his administration. He has embarrassed the country
he swore to protect and safeguard.
</P>
<P>
   He should be profoundly ashamed, and the shame should haunt him
for the rest of his life.
</P>
<P>
   USA Today
</P>
<P>
   The core of the president's argument is the tired White House
refrain that independent counsel Ken Starr's investigation has
``gone on too long, cost too much and hurt too many innocent
people.'' Yet if anything was obvious Monday night, it was that
Clinton could have brought it all to a quick close in January
simply by telling the truth then rather than having it dragged out
of him now.
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street Journal
</P>
<P>
   Legal technicalities aside, the public needs to know how its
government has been conducting itself. What acts may be impeachable
and what standards of evidence apply are questions the Congress
must decide, not ones for Mr. Starr to predetermine. On the other
hand, if Mr. Starr can exonerate Mr. Clinton on Filegate or
Travelgate, Americans deserve to know that too _ not merely have it
asserted by the same White House spinners who assured us Mr.
Clinton never had sex with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   Texas
</P>
<P>
   We are left with the presidential confession, the sad collection
of details and leaks and the spin game that whirls on all sides.
</P>
<P>
   To many of Clinton's political detractors it's an I-told-you-so
affirmation that the man is immoral and not fit to hold office.
</P>
<P>
   To many of his supporters, it's an it-doesn't-really-matter
confirmation that conspirators are desperate to discredit him and
are imposing an unfair standard upon the president's personal life
and foibles.
</P>
<P>
   For the nation, it's a sort of Super Bowl of sordidness,
complete with off-color analysis, play-by-play commentary and
endless _ endless _ on-the-field mayhem.
</P>
<P>
   The Charleston Daily Mail
</P>
<P>
   West Virginia
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has told the American people too little too
late. Months of lying, of stonewalling, of trying to shift the
blame and of spinning the truth have damaged his credibility beyond
repair.
</P>
<P>
   In a ghastly four-minute session, the president told the nation
no more than he had to. It was a calculated, carefully calibrated
effort at damage control.
</P>
<P>
   In was a hell of a comedown from a fireside chat with FDR.
</P>
<P>
   The Austin American-Statesman
</P>
<P>
   Texas
</P>
<P>
   True to form, Clinton offered a quick, weak apology for a
critical lapse of judgment in having the affair and misleading the
public, then attacked Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr for going
too far and hurting ``too many innocent people.'' But Mr.
President, who is to blame for that?
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Clinton fell back on a legal point to defend his
lies and placed the blame for his predicament elsewhere. That won't
endear him to anyone. The country Clinton leads deserves better
than the superficial finger-pointing performance he delivered
Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Des Moines Register
</P>
<P>
   Iowa
</P>
<P>
   It is almost beyond comprehension that Clinton is so lacking in
self-discipline, so reckless, that he engaged in a sordid liaison
with a youthful intern under the same roof with his own family, at
a time he was under scrutiny for alleged sexual misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the public was fully aware of Clinton's reputation and twice
elected him president. It is not Clinton's character alone that
brought about this sorry moment. Other factors are the president's
tenacious enemies and an overreaching independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   It should never have some to this _ but it did.
</P>
<P>
   The Detroit Free Press
</P>
<P>
   Michigan
</P>
<P>
   The legacy Clinton was pursuing in such important areas as
education and race relations will be forever tarnished by a sex
scandal. His mantra of taking ``personal responsibility'' rings
hollow.
</P>
<P>
   He has let the whole country down.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not Clinton got your vote in his two campaigns for
president, whether or not he is of your party or your political
ideology, if you are an American, he is your leader. You are
entitled to demand a lot from the person in such a job. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Clinton would like the country to move quickly beyond this
tawdry episode, enjoy the booming economy, and prepare for the next
century. The country probably will, but without its president in
any meaningful role.

CORPORATIONS SEEKING RESPECT VIA ADS ON NEWS TALK SHOWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Few fans of the upscale Sunday morning news programs and of
public television's weeknight ``Newshour'' can have more than a
vague notion of what Archer Daniels Midland Co. is up to off
camera. Its omnipresent soft-focused high-minded commercials croon
that Archer Daniels is a charitable institution, dedicated to
saving the universe even as it brings edifying television to a
select audience. Other companies have been inspired to mimic its
advertising strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Not so widely advertised is the giant grain processor's success
in seeding politicians of both parties with contributions and
lobbying to insure that its interests are attended to in
Washington; its television commercials fit snugly into that
high-power campaign. Such exertions are meant in part to repair the
image of big-scale price-fixing, for which Archer Daniels was fined
$100 million in 1996, an embarrassment that was recalled this month
by the Chicago trial of three former Archer Daniels executives.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution played a videotape that it says showed the
executives and their confreres from a major competitor, Ajinimoto
Co. of Japan, haggling over controlling the world market of a feed
additive called lysine. The executives having pleaded not guilty,
one must withhold judgment as to their culpability, but readers of
Kurt Eichenwald's report in The New York Times may have been struck
by a comment (caught on tape) to the Japanese executives by James
Randall, at the time the president of Archer Daniels: ``Our
competitors are our friends and our customers are our enemies.'' A
zippy line, worthy of the people who came up with ``supermarket to
the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Such blips are not noted in the commercials that extol Archer
Daniels as a global savior. Advertising professionals, after all,
are not in the business of biting the hand that feeds the world.
Archer Daniels is engaged in chronic image enhancement, identifying
itself with such respected institutions as ABC's ``This Week,''
NBC's ``Meet the Press'' and of course PBS's ``Newshour.'' It's a
form of lobbying.
</P>
<P>
   The contaminating influence of Archer Daniels is not confined to
price-fixing. Many admirers of David Brinkley were distressed early
this year to learn that he was capping his career in journalism by
signing on with Archer Daniels, even though his words were crafted
as infomercials with no direct plug for the company. He was being
used in much the way his former program, ``This Week,'' is used, as
a reach for reputation by association. The resultant criticism
caused ABC to drop the Brinkley psuedo-commercials for a while, but
they can now be seen, ``on behalf of ADM,'' on at least three
Sunday network programs, including ``This Week.'' All is forgiven.
</P>
<P>
   The sophisticated audience that depends on the Sunday morning
interviews to explore Monica Lewinsky and other ethical issues
understands that the programs, whatever their other qualities, also
do what they have to do to stay in business. If the revered
Brinkley, too, chooses to turn himself into a commercial enterprise
by selling his reputation to Archer Daniels, that's a reward of
stardom.
</P>
<P>
   When we come to public broadcasting, however, the apologia is
uncomfortable. The tendency in recent years has been for public
broadcasters to carry ever more expansive commercials, which go
smack against the rationale for what in more wishful times was
known as noncommercial television.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, public broadcasting, perpetually underfinanced and
scraping for cash with begfests and potboilers (even now on show),
needs the money. Alas, like everything else in the market, that
does not come free. As originally conceived, the hope of public
broadcasting was not just that it would supply programs that could
not make it in the marketplace, but that it would also respect its
audience by eliminating the hokum of advertising. PBS would be a
commercial-free, hypocrisy-free zone.
</P>
<P>
   But the tendency has been to make nonprofit broadcasting sound
ever more like for-profit broadcasting. Since the commercial has
become an accepted element on PBS, admirers of Jim Lehrer &AMP; Co.
must resign themselves to hearing senseless slogans as the price of
admission. Even when they do not achieve the rhapsodic appeal of
Archer Daniels, financial institutions in particular use vapid
pomposities as a sure route to the pockets of the moneyed classes.
Every night during ``Newshour,'' for example, Salomon Smith Barney
announces, ``Success is earned.''
</P>
<P>
   Surely if there is an implicit contract between viewers and
public broadcasters it must contain a provision against treating
the audience like saps. As the PBS promotions, which are themselves
increasingly adding to the on-screen clutter, put the case, ``If
PBS doesn't do it, who will?'' But no surge of resistance to hype
is observable. The underwriters' slogans go down easily in a nation
dosed on ``supermarket to the world.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, PBS programs are not interrupted by such ``messages'';
with adroit use of the mute button, you can spare yourself bushwa
to the effect that ``At the CIT Group, we believe that growth
begins with money well lent.'' And Jim Lehrer is not about to sign
on with Archer Daniels.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the direction is dire. (``The Nightly Business Report'' is
already a supermarket of plugs.) The commercialization is a bow to
reality: the nation doesn't want the purer form of television
enough to pay for it, and the merger of PBS ideals and business
interests is swallowed as readily as the Archer Daniels-Brinkley
merger.
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether PBS programmers can remain uninfluenced
by corporate largess in their choice of subjects to play up and
those to avoid and the spirit in which business news in particular
is treated.
</P>
<P>
   Can seepage into programming be resisted? On that account, an
analysis on ``Newshour'' of the motives, techniques and impact of
the advertising increasingly being directed at viewers like us
would be enlightening.

THE SOUL OF SUMMER IN A BURST OF SERENDIPITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By AMANDA HESSER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ How rare it is to come across a restaurant dish that
leaves you feeling refreshed as well as satisfied. Sensations are
deeply layered in Patroon's tomato watermelon salad: it is sweet
and wet, cool and filling all at once.
</P>
<P>
   Geoffrey Zackarian, the chef at the restaurant, at 160 East 46th
Street, said that one day recently the kitchen was loaded down with
tomatoes and watermelon. So, in the free spirit of summer, he
decided to combine the two.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting salad looks like a plate of glistening jewels,
with heirloom tomatoes (green, purple pear, jelly bean, yellow
pepper, yellow currant and red currant), yellow watermelon, basil,
currants, lamb's-quarters and mango.
</P>
<P>
   It is a bit of a hodgepodge, perhaps, but one that definitely
works _ and, it turns out, is easy to prepare. The acidity in the
tomatoes and the sugar in the watermelon keep each other in check,
the lamb's-quarters help the dish maintain the feeling of a salad,
rather than a fruit cup, and Lebanese extra virgin olive oil
smooths out any rough edges.
</P>
<P>
   It is an exquisite final burst of summer, and if you're staying
for a full meal at Patroon, your only chance at spa food before one
of Patroon's monstrous steaks arrives at the table. The salad,
which costs $10, will be on the menu until tomatoes run out,
sometime in September. &QL;

MYSTERY MAN'S DEATH: FIGHTING OVER CARLOS CASTANEDA'S LEGACY 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By PETER APPLEBOME   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Once he began publishing his best-selling accounts of his
purported adventures with a Mexican shaman 30 years ago, Carlos
Castaneda's life and work played out in a wispy blur of sly
illusion and artful deceit.
</P>
<P>
   Now, four months after he died and two months after the death
was made public, a probate court in Los Angeles is sifting through
competing claims on the estate of the author whose works helped
define the 1960s and usher in the New Age movement.
</P>
<P>
   His followers say he left the earth with the same elegant,
willful mystery that characterized his life. The man he used to
call his son says Castaneda died while a virtual prisoner of
cultlike followers who controlled his last days and his estate.
</P>
<P>
   Given that Castaneda's literary credibility, marital history,
place of birth, circumstances of death and almost everything else
about his life are in dispute, the competing claims _ including
questions about the authenticity of his will and his competence to
sign it _ are not surprising. But they are providing a nasty coda
to the life of a man whose books, which sold 8 million copies in 17
languages, are viewed as fact, metaphor or hoax.
</P>
<P>
   Admirers say the areas of dispute, most famously whether the
purported shaman and brujo (witch) Don Juan Matus ever existed, are
peripheral to the real issues Castaneda explored in his books.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carlos knew exactly what was true and what was not true,''
said Angela Panaro, of Cleargreen Inc., the group that marketed
Castaneda's teachings and seminars near the end of his life. ``But
the thing that's missing when people talk about Carlos is not
whether Don Juan lived or not, or who lived in what house. It's
about becoming a voyager of awareness, about the 600 locations in
the luminous egg of man where the assemblage point can shift, about
the process of depersonalization he taught.''
</P>
<P>
   The luminous egg, assemblage point and processes of
depersonalization are all part of the practice of Tensegrity, a
blend of meditation and movement exercises that Castaneda taught in
his final years as a way for people to break through the
limitations of ordinary consciousness. Skeptics say they sum up a
career characterized, in the end, by literate New Age mumbo jumbo
and artful deception.
</P>
<P>
   Even Margaret Runyan Castaneda, who had been married to him,
while admiring Castaneda and his work, says she doubts Don Juan
ever existed and thinks his name came from Mateus, the bubbly
Portuguese wine the couple used to drink.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Castaneda rocketed from obscure anthropology graduate
student at the University of California at Los Angeles to instant,
if elusive, celebrity in 1968 with the publication of ``The
Teachings of Don Juan: A Yaqui Way of Knowledge,'' a vivid account
of the spiritual and pharmacological adventures he had with a
white-haired Yaqui Indian nagual or shaman, Don Juan Matus. He said
he met Don Juan at a Greyhound bus station in Nogales, Ariz., in
the summer of 1960 when Castaneda was doing research on medicinal
plants used by Indians of the Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   In that book, its sequel, ``A Separate Reality,'' and eight
others, he described his apprenticeship to Don Juan and a spiritual
journey in which he saw giant insects, learned to fly and grew a
beak as part of a process of breaking the hold of ordinary
perception.
</P>
<P>
   Admirers saw his work as a gripping spiritual quest in the
tradition of Aldous Huxley's ``Doors of Perception.'' Skeptics
wondered how much was true.
</P>
<P>
   But despite Castaneda's obsessive pursuit of total anonymity _
he refused to be photographed or tape recorded and almost never
gave interviews _ he became a figure of international notoriety,
and the books continued to sell well after his vogue passed.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, he surfaced with a new vision, the teaching of
Tensegrity, which is described on the Cleargreen Web site as ``the
modernized version of some movements called magical passes
developed by Indian shamans who lived in Mexico in times prior to
the Spanish conquest.'' He even made public appearances and spoke
at seminars promoting the work.
</P>
<P>
   Tensegrity, its organizers say, allows followers to perceive
pure energy, ``zillions of energy fields in the form of luminous
filaments'' and break the chains of normal cognition.
</P>
<P>
   Unknown to customers who turned out for the seminars _ which
cost $600 and more, where they could buy Castaneda's books, $29.95
videos and Tensegrity T-shirts reading, ``The magic is in the
movement'' _ Castaneda was dying of cancer while describing his
route to vibrant good health.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, although only his inner circle knew about it for two
months, he died on April 27 at his home, surrounded by high hedges
in Westwood, a well-to-do section of Los Angeles, where he lived
for many years with some of the self-described witches, stalkers,
dreamers and spiritual seekers who shared his work.
</P>
<P>
   At a brief hearing in probate court in Los Angeles last week,
the man whom Castaneda for many years called his son challenged the
will Castaneda apparently signed four days before his death. The
judge set a hearing date of Oct. 15 for the case.
</P>
<P>
   C.J. Castaneda, also known as Adrian Vashon _ whose birth
certificate cites Carlos Castaneda as his father, although another
man was actually his father _ says Cleargreen became a cultlike
group that came to control Castaneda's life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those people latched onto him, stuck their claws in him and
rode him for all he was worth,'' said C.J. Castaneda, who operates
two small coffee shops in suburban Atlanta and calls himself a
powerful brujo. ``I don't believe the will has my father's
signature, and I don't believe he was competent to sign it three
days before he died.''
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Drooz, Carlos Castaneda's lawyer and executor of his
estate, said she witnessed the signing along with another lawyer
and a notary public. She said that Carlos Castaneda was completely
lucid when he signed the will, and that C.J. Castaneda had no
claims to the estate. She denied that Carlos Castaneda's followers
were anything akin to a cult and said C.J. Castaneda's claim did
not constitute a serious legal challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one, none, of Dr. Castaneda's followers participated in the
writing of the will,'' she said. ``And one thing that was very
clear for years was that Dr. Castaneda had not had a relationship
with C.J. Castaneda or Adrian Vashon for years, and he was very
clear he should not benefit from Dr. Castaneda's death.''

FATHER, SON KILLED IN EMBASSY BOMBING ARE BURIED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ESTELLA DURAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Va. _ Two red roses rested on the two identical metal
caskets. A father and son who died together in Kenya in the twin
bombings of US embassies in Africa were buried side by side Tuesday
at Arlington National Cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   Julian Bartley, 55, who was consul general of the embassy in
Nairobi, and his son, college student Julian Bartley Jr., 20, who
worked alongside his father this summer, were among the 12
Americans who died in explosions Aug. 7 that killed more than 250
people.
</P>
<P>
   About 150 family members and friends of the Bartleys attended
Tuesday's funeral, and the toll of the double loss was visible.
</P>
<P>
   ``My babies,'' wept Gladys Baldwin, the mother and grandmother
of the two victims.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Linda Sue Powell Bartley, the widow of the elder Bartley
and her daughter, Edith Bartley, 25, sat on either side of Baldwin.
</P>
<P>
   Julian Bartley Jr., known as ``Jay,'' was a student at the
United States International University in Nairobi and had hoped to
join the Foreign Service like his father. His father, who spent 24
years with the Foreign Service, had been stationed in Kenya for two
years and before that was in the Dominican Republic, Colombia,
Spain, Israel, and Korea.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton had approved waivers to allow the father and
son to be buried at Arlington National Cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   At a somber ceremony last week at Andrews Air Force Base,
Clinton described the Bartleys as ``a senior diplomat I had the
honor to meet twice, and his son, who proudly worked alongside him
this summer.''
</P>
<P>
   A third worker who died in the Nairobi explosion also was buried
at Arlington cemetery Tuesday. Prabhi Guptara Kavaler, 45, was a
general services office employee. Her family had requested a
private ceremony.

 UNDATED: Castaneda's death.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   By conventional standards, Castaneda's death was highly unusual.
</P>
<P>
   Invariably described as an impeccable person who kept his
affairs in perfect order, Castaneda apparently signed the will on
April 23, and then died at 3 a.m. on April 27 of what his death
certificate said was metabolic encephalopathy, a neurological
breakdown that followed two weeks of liver failure and 10 months of
cancer. The signature is partly obscured, and C.J. Castaneda and
his mother, Mrs. Castaneda, say it does not look like Castaneda's
signature.
</P>
<P>
   The death certificate is as much fiction as fact. It said he was
never married, when he was married at least once and perhaps twice;
that he was born in Brazil, when he was apparently born in Peru,
and that he was employed as a teacher by the Beverly Hills School
District, which has no record of his employment.
</P>
<P>
   He was cremated within hours of his death. His death was kept
secret for more than two months until word leaked out and was
confirmed by his representatives, who said the death was kept quiet
in keeping with Castaneda's lifelong pursuit of privacy.
</P>
<P>
   His will cited assets worth just over $1 million, a modest
figure for an author who sold so well and apparently lived simply.
All his assets were given to the Eagle's Trust, set up at the same
time as the will. It is not clear how much in additional assets had
already been placed in the trust, but a London newspaper recently
estimated his estate at $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   To C.J. Castaneda and his mother, the circumstances of
Castaneda's death are so suspicious as to suggest that his life was
being controlled by others.
</P>
<P>
   As to Don Juan's authenticity, many people believe Don Juan was
at best a composite of things Castaneda read and experienced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think there was no Don Juan,'' Mrs. Castaneda said.
``I think Don Juan was anyone with whom he had a conversation, like
the Dialogues of Plato. I told him Plato probably never had anyone
to talk with, but the Dialogues were his way of conveying both
sides of things. I think that's what Carlos did.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Given that the unusual was the routine for Carlos Castaneda,
extending to his own familial relationships, it is difficult to
know how to evaluate the discrepancies in his life.
</P>
<P>
   C.J. Castaneda's parents were Mrs. Castaneda, who wrote about
her life in a book, ``A Magical Journey with Carlos Castaneda''
(Millenia Press, 1996), and a businessman named Adrian Gerritsen, a
friend of Carlos Castaneda.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Castaneda said she and Gerritsen conceived the child after
she and Carlos Castaneda received a Mexican divorce she took to be
official but turned out not to be valid. Carlos Castaneda put his
own name on the boy's birth certificate, helped raise him for
several years, paid for his schooling and continued to express
affection in letters for many years, although the two seldom saw
each other in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   C.J. Castaneda said Carlos Castaneda's followers kept his father
away from him. Ms. Drooz said the author made it clear he did not
want to see him.
</P>
<P>
   Richard de Mille, an author who published two books questioning
Carlos Castaneda's veracity, said Castaneda filed legal papers
marrying a Peruvian girl with whom he conceived a child in the
1950s, making her his only legal wife. The two never divorced, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Castaneda originally said he was born on Dec. 25, 1935,
in Sao Paolo, Brazil, the son of a university professor and a woman
who died when he was 7. American immigration records indicated he
was born in 1923 in Cajmarca, Peru, the son of a goldsmith, and
that his mother died when he was 24.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from his dubious biography and shamanlike tales of having
doubles, pulverizing glass or powering cars with his spirit is the
question of what to make of his books.
</P>
<P>
   Few academics regard them as serious scholarship. Dr. Louis J.
West, a psychology professor at UCLA, who knew Castaneda when he
was completing his doctorate there, said the works were at least in
part ``science fiction.'' But that does not take away from their
virtues of conveying mysterious places and alternative realities,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carlos wrote beguilingly and well, and told very colorful
tales that hold the interest and give descriptions of people and
places and activities that are illuminating,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   De Mille is less forgiving.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't call him a fraud, because any sensible person would
see through it,'' he said. ``He could be charming and playful, but
that doesn't make him honest or defensible or anything like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Even admirers tend to be skeptical of the Tensegrity seminars.
Many find it hard to believe that Castaneda would spend almost
three decades conveying and refining Don Juan's teachings, only to
start marketing a whole new version of it at the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really seemed to me that the Carlos Castaneda that I met
and who was giving these workshops was not even the same person who
had written the truly fine books on the teachings of Don Juan,''
said Barry Klein, a Castaneda admirer who tried the Tensegrity
seminars briefly.

DEFENSE LAWYER IN KLAN TRIAL CHARGES POLITICAL PROSECUTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CURTIS WILKIE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HATTIESBURG, Miss. _ Minutes after Sam Bowers's lawyer began his
defense Tuesday by denouncing the aging Ku Klux Klan leader's
murder trial as a ``media-orchestrated and politically driven
prosecution _ a persecution,'' state prosecutors began laying out a
tapestry of testimony designed to link Bowers to the fatal
firebombing in 1966 of a local civil rights leader.
</P>
<P>
   In his opening argument, Travis Buckley, a quintessential
country lawyer who represents Bowers and has his own background as
a defendant in Klan cases, accused the state of ``appealing to
emotions'' and knuckling under to pressures to pursue the
32-year-old case involving the death of Vernon Dahmer, president of
the local NAACP chapter.
</P>
<P>
   Buckley, 63, was once indicted himself in the Dahmer case and
later convicted of kidnapping in another trial that grew out of an
attempt to intimidate a fellow Klansman in Bowers's unit. According
to a previous account by Billy Roy Pitts, a former Klansman
expected to testify against Bowers this week, the lawyer brandished
a hunting knife while Pitts administered a beating and Bowers
watched in an incident that took place in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Buckley's conviction was overturned by the Mississippi Supreme
Court and he has been able to continue to practice law.
</P>
<P>
   Buckley is a long-time associate of Bowers in Laurel, a tough,
working-class city in Jones County, 35 miles north of Hattiesburg.
After Dahmer's murder, the attorney told a local radio station in
1966 that FBI agents knew who was responsible but would not move on
the killers because it would be damaging to President Lyndon B.
Johnson and ``the racial-radical civil rights organizations.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Buckley had new theories in the case that has attracted
widespread attention in the South.
</P>
<P>
   Though Buckley did not mention Mississippi Attorney General Mike
Moore by name in his courtroom remarks, his reference to political
motivation was implicit because Moore has expressed interest in
seeking the Democratic nomination for governor in 1999. Moore's
decision a year ago to throw the weight of his office behind the
investigation was instrumental in bringing Bowers back to trial
three decades after he escaped conviction in three separate
mistrials.
</P>
<P>
   Since Mississippi is a state where a third of voters are black,
Buckley seemed to be suggesting that Moore was making an overt
appeal for black votes. Moore was not in the courtroom, but one of
his assistants is helping the county prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Bowers's attorney also singled out Jerry Mitchell, a reporter
for The Clarion Ledger newspaper in Jackson, for stoking interest
in the case. Mitchell has written a number of articles about the
Dahmer case since his reporting helped create a climate for the
1994 retrial of Byron de la Beckwith, another white supremacist,
that resulted in Beckwith's conviction for the assassination of
another NAACP leader, Medgar Evers, 30 years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Beckwith was sentenced to life imprisonment, and there are
echoes of his case in the prosecution of Bowers. Although Bowers is
charged with murder, the state is not seeking the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   After the selection of a racially mixed jury _ six whites, five
blacks, and one Asian-American _ was completed, the prosecution
began its case by setting the scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two a.m. A cold January morning,'' said assistant district
attorney Robert Helfrich, speaking in a quiet, laconic manner.
``Two cars with heavily armed Klansmen, Unit 4, Jones County White
Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, attacked the Dahmer property. They
came armed with pistols, shotguns, and 12 gallons of gasoline.''
</P>
<P>
   Dahmer died hours after his rural home near here was firebombed,
his lungs seared by flames.
</P>
<P>
   Helfrich promised that witnesses would relate details of the
raid, and declared that the testimony would show ``the attack was
ordered by this defendant, the imperial wizard of the White Knights
of the Ku Klux Klan.'' Across the courtroom, the 73-year-old Bowers
stared impassively.
</P>
<P>
   But Buckley countered that some of the state witnesses,
including the former Klansman Pitts, who have agreed to cooperate
with the prosecution, were ``like fish with a hook caught in their
mouth _ they'll go anywhere they're told to go.''
</P>
<P>
   The first three witnesses were members of Dahmer's family: his
widow, a son, and a daughter. They testified how Dahmer had fired
shots to defend the house and helped them through windows of the
burning building.
</P>
<P>
   Bettie Dahmer, who was 10 years old at the time of the
firebombing, tearfully recalled how her father sat on a bale of hay
in the relative safety of a barn behind the house after the
nightriders fled. ``I saw my house burning,'' she said. ``I saw
skin hanging off my daddy's arm.''
</P>
<P>
   When Buckley cross-examined the witness, he created the first
sparks of the trial. Although he expressed regret over Dahmer's
death, he and Dahmer's daughter clashed over whether the case
should be pursued.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to see my daddy done justice, just like everybody
else in America,'' she said. When Buckley remarked that nothing
could bring Dahmer back from the dead, she wiped away tears and
replied, ``That's right. Once he was dead, he was dead.''

IS GOLF THE LAST BASTION OF GOOD SPORTSMANSHIP?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By DAVID A. MARKIEWICZ 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The long history of professional golf has been so pure, so
apparently free of unsportsmanlike incidents on the course, that
what went down on an August day in 1995 in Akron, Ohio, had
everybody in shock.
</P>
<P>
   One touring pro accused another of cheating.
</P>
<P>
   To the novice, unfamiliar with the game's code of honor, it
might have seemed like a small thing. Greg Norman accused fellow
PGA Tour veteran Mark McCumber of touching his own putting line on
a seven-foot par putt during a round of the World Series of Golf.
</P>
<P>
   What it amounted to was this: Norman believed that McCumber
touched a piece of grass in the line of his putt, a violation of
golf rules. McCumber said Norman was mistaken; he had merely
squashed a bug.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to the vile conduct exhibited in other sports _
taunting, spitting, brawling _ it was almost hopelessly quaint. But
in golf, it caused an uproar.
</P>
<P>
   Norman refused to sign McCumber's scorecard. He even considered
withdrawing from the event because he was so upset. McCumber was
forced to defend his honor in public.
</P>
<P>
   While their positions on the incident differed, Norman and
McCumber agreed on the importance of the issue. And that spoke
volumes about how golf is different from other sports when it comes
to sportsmanship.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't do what is the right thing, the game might get
away from us,'' said Norman, speaking of the need to protect the
integrity of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game is played as a game of honor, and you have to rely on
the other players to go that way,'' said McCumber, adding, ``My
life speaks for itself. I have nothing to defend, nothing at all.''
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to imagine Dennis Rodman taking a head-butting act so
to heart. But that is basketball, and this is golf, perhaps the
last bastion of sportsmanship.
</P>
<P>
   The norm in golf is to abide by both the letter and spirit of
the law, golfers maintain. Even if no one else in the world would
know you're breaking the rules. Even if it would help you make a
lot of money, or win a tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Gay Brewer, the 1967 Masters Tournament champion and now a
member of the Senior PGA Tour, recalled being paired with Bruce
Crampton for the final round of the 1998 Southwestern Bell Dominion
tournament in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   At the ninth hole, Crampton's tee shot caromed off a tree into a
hazard. While Crampton headed to his ball, Brewer set out down the
other side of the fairway.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, Brewer turned and spotted Crampton chipping out
of the hazard. Brewer saw Crampton reach the green on the par-5
hole with his third shot, then watched him sink a long putt for
what he figured was a birdie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I turned to him and said, `Man, that was some birdie,'''
Brewer recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `That was a six.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Puzzled, Brewer asked what had happened. Crampton told him that
his caddie had removed a branch from the hazard while he was
preparing to hit his second shot, a two-stroke penalty under the
rules of golf.
</P>
<P>
   ``He called it on himself, and nobody even saw it,'' Brewer
said. ``The ball never moved. But if you pick something up in the
hazard, it's a two-shot penalty. The (caddie) was young and didn't
know what he was doing. It didn't affect his shot at all, but
that's the rule, so he called it on himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way these guys are. If you don't call it, you've
got to sleep with yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We pride ourselves a lot on that,'' PGA Tour commissioner Tom
Finchem said of sportsmanship's role in golf.
</P>
<P>
   Finchem attributes the level of honor in the game to ``the
caliber of people who play the game.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're blessed compared to other sports,'' Finchem said. ``Our
players are mature, educated. They've finished college, by and
large. To play the game at their level, you have a certain
evenness, a certain amount of restraint and control of your
emotions. If you don't, you can't play.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think golf is such a game of discipline that it disciplines
everybody,'' said Gary Player, one of only four players to win each
of golf's four major championships.
</P>
<P>
   Finchem said there is a practical, economic reason for golf to
maintain its tradition of sportsmanlike behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that the image of the players, as it contrasts to other
sports, gives us a significant leg up in the marketplace,'' Finchem
said. ``There is no hesitation by governments or by corporate
America to be involved in our sport because of that image.''
</P>
<P>
   Golf has had its share of hot-tempered individuals through the
years. ``Terrible'' Tommy Bolt and his club-tossing comes to mind.
Tom Weiskopf also flashed his emotions at times. There is even the
story of a skirmish between J.C. Snead and Dave Hill at a 1991
Senior PGA Tour event in Napa, Calif. There, an errant drive struck
on the practice range by Snead is reported to have incensed Hill
and led to what, for golf, amounted to a donnybrook as the two
tussled to the ground with spectators watching in amazement.
</P>
<P>
   Golf has also witnessed occasional acts of gamesmanship,
intentional or not. The best recent example came at last year's
Ryder Cup matches when Scotland's Colin Montgomerie appeared, in
interviews, to question the ability of certain Americans to perform
under pressure in the U.S.-European international competition.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did American players react negatively to Monty's
assessments, galleries at PGA Tour events picked up on his
observations and began to ride Montgomery verbally on the course.
</P>
<P>
   At the U.S. Open this year, one gallery member even told
Montgomery to ``go home.'' When a shocked Montgomery asked the fan
why he should, the fan replied: ``Because of the Ryder Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the tiff between golf fans and players was about as
unusual as Montgomery's frank assessment of the American team. In
no other sport are spectators and athletes as close to one another
as in golf, yet there have been few incidents of disrespect _ other
than an occasional murmur in the crowd during a shot, or a clicking
camera.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the now-standard shouts of ``You da man!'' still come
after a swing is completed, although there is growing concern that
inappropriate behavior might be on the rise, particularly among
alcohol-consuming spectators.
</P>
<P>
   In the main, though, golf is worlds apart from the on-field and
on-court antics of other major sports. Even in another country-club
sport, tennis, sportsmanship has declined.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, players have thrown their rackets at officials,
cursed linesmen, baited opponents and tanked matches. Bad boys such
as Ilie Nastase, John McEnroe and Jimmy Connors all were
celebrated, not just for their winning performances, but for their
breath-of-fresh-air attitudes toward what some regarded as a far
too stuffy sport.
</P>
<P>
   Women's tennis, which has lagged the men's game in
unsportsmanlike behavior, appears to be following suit. Venus
Williams' temper tantrum at this summer's Wimbledon tournament was
the latest in a growing list of examples of poor behavior on the
court.
</P>
<P>
   ``Times have changed,'' tennis great Billie Jean King says.
``Women's tennis is becoming more like the guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Golf has seen no such decline.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if sportsmanship in golf is unique among sports, LPGA
player Laura Davies said, ``I think so, definitely. There are no
referees in golf, for one thing, so it's up to each player to play
by the rules. There's not another sport like it.''
</P>
<P>
   TCU graduate and 1971 Masters winner Charles Coody explained,
``It's just that golf is an ethical sport and players do their best
to keep it that way. Maybe a guy might bend a rule here or there,''
Coody said, ``whether it was intentional or unintentional. But if
he does, another golfer will go up and say something to him on the
side. That's the way it should be.''
</P>
<P>
   Golfers don't just observe good sportsmanship by adhering to the
rules.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1969 Ryder Cup, an international competition that then
pitted a squad of top U.S. golfers against the best of Great
Britain, Jack Nicklaus and England's Tony Jacklin came down to the
final hole in the final match all square, with the Cup at stake.
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus knocked down a four-foot putt for par, seemingly
placing extraordinary pressure on Jacklin, who needed a two-footer
to give the British a tie.
</P>
<P>
   But Nicklaus, in an extraordinary display of sportsmanship,
conceded the putt, allowing the draw.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, in golf's most prestigious championship, the U.S.
Open, Tom Lehman and Steve Jones battled each other as playing
partners throughout the final round. Neither had won a major title
at the time, but Jones might have been more eager because he had
been out of the spotlight and winners' circle for a longer period.
</P>
<P>
   Although Jones was his foe on the course, Lehman went out of his
way to calm his friend down on the back nine holes, giving him
comfort and encouragement that likely helped Jones to the biggest
victory of his career. Lehman still hasn't won the Open.
</P>
<P>
   Grace in the most dire of circumstances continues to be on
display on the PGA Tour. This year, for example, area fans got to
watch Plano's Fred Couples cope publicly with a disappointing loss
at the Masters and, just a month later, another wrenching loss at
the GTE Byron Nelson Classic in Irving.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, Couples faced the media with class, though he may
have wanted to toss his bag in a lake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Golf's been a gentleman's game ever since it started,'' Brewer
said. ``It still is. I think it always will be.''

MEXICO'S MOST-WANTED CAPTURED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Daniel Arizmendi Lopez, Mexico's most notorious
fugitive and the alleged leader of a kidnapping ring known for
cutting off victims' ears to get families to pay ransoms, has been
captured, authorities said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The 39-year-old suspect, who has been accused of masterminding
dozens of kidnappings in recent years, was caught Monday night in
the northwestern Mexico City suburb of Naucalpan, the federal
attorney general, Jorge Madrazo, said Tuesday at a press
conference. Another 16 people, including Arizmendi's girlfriend and
six minors who are believed to be connected to the kidnapping ring,
were also detained that night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that with the work we have done so far,'' said
Samuel Gonzalez, chief of the federal organized crime unit, the
suspects ``will receive thousands of years in jail, and this is a
great effort to bring down this kind of impunity.''
</P>
<P>
   The government has seized about $5.7 million in cash, more than
100 one-ounce gold coins, and 25 houses.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Arizmendi's younger brother and alleged chief accomplice,
Aurelio, has said that the gang had cut off the ears of eight
hostage.
</P>
<P>
   Arizmendi's arrest ended an intense nationwide manhunt that had
grown increasingly dramatic over the last three months as
investigators from various federal and state police agencies closed
in on their suspect. But as details of the arrest were released
Tuesday, it appeared that the country's most wanted criminal was
caught not with a bang but in a quiet and high-tech manner.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview broadcast Tuesday afternoon by the network Radio
Red, Jorge Reyes Satayna, attorney general for the state of Mexico,
said police had tracked Arizmendi via a cellular telephone call
that he made late Monday to his accomplices, whom police had
arrested without his knowledge. When Arizmendi arrived at the
hideout later, about a dozen officers were waiting for him. He was
arrested without incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``The operation was so efficient that there was no violence,''
Satayna said. ``Arizmendi arrived in a disguise and didn't put up
any resistance. He was arrested easily.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizmendi, wearing a beard and shoulder-length hair, arrived in
Mexico City Tuesday in shackles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess today was a day of bad luck for me,'' he said in a
brief interview with TV Azteca.
</P>
<P>
   In May, law enforcement officials raided a half-dozen of
Arizmendi's hideouts and captured his wife and children, but failed
to catch Arizmendi, who slipped away in a stolen car. In late June,
police arrested Aurelio after an afternoon sidewalk shootout. And
last month, officials arrested Arizmendi's lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Arizmendi, a former Morelos state police officer, had become a
symbol of the crime epidemic that has swept through country since
the economic crisis of 1994. In a newspaper interview this summer,
he said he ``would rather be killed than go to jail.''
</P>
<P>
   Authorities also have voiced hope that the arrests would help
change the image of corrupt police. Arizmendi allegedly paid
several rank-and-file and top officers to either carry out
kidnappings or to provide him with tips on the investigations to
help him avoid being caught.
</P>
<P>
   Madrazo said that almost 40 members of the Arizmendi ring had
been arrested, and that 80 people have come forward claiming to be
victims and seeking their share of the recovered ransom.
</P>
<P>
   This month, Madrazo added, the gang kidnapped the son of a
wealthy gasoline executive and demanded a $15 million ransom from
the family despite having killed the victim the day of the
kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the news of Arizmendi's arrest, Mexico City is still
vexed with law enforcement problems. Dozens of brief kidnappings
and robberies committed in stolen taxis are reported daily, and a
record 120 bank robberies have been committed this year.
</P>
<P>
   Hours before Arizmendi's arrest on Monday, the federal
government and the Mexico City mayor's office announced plans to
invest more than $28 million to bolster anti-crime programs in
Mexico City.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Far from signaling the beginning of the end of the
Monica Lewinsky investigation, Monday's testimony and speech by
President Clinton, may only have ratcheted up the tensions between
him and the independent counsel, Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   The combative tone of the president's speech, in which he
continued to attack Starr as overzealous and partisan, was one sign
of continuing rancor. Another was the readiness of the special
prosecutor to press on with his investigation, calling Richard
Morris, former Clinton political adviser, before the grand jury on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm reminded of two heavyweights who are determined to go
fifteen rounds,'' said Stanley Brand, a Democratic lawyer who
served as general counsel to the House of Representatives.
``Whoever wins, they are both going to be terribly bruised at the
end of the fight. And the two institutions will never be the
same.''
</P>
<P>
   In the short term, several lawyers said, the battle between the
president and the special prosecutor could become even uglier, a
prospect no one relishes. One key reason would be the questions the
president did not answer, though it is not clear just what they
were.
</P>
<P>
   The independent counsel might decide that the president's
answers during his unprecedented grand jury testimony on Monday
were insufficient and Starr could move to reissue the subpoena that
he withdrew after the president agreed to testify.
</P>
<P>
   The White House could claim that such a subpoena is
unconstitutional and force another legal confrontation with Starr
lasting many more weeks. At the same time, it could spread the
story that all Starr wanted was more prurient details, a charge he
would find hard to rebut, even if false, because Judge Norma
Holloway Johnson is angry over leaks from his office.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Starr decides to wind down his investigation and file a
report with the House of Representatives, Clinton will surely paint
any impeachment referral to the House as a further intrusion into
his private life. Fighting in a political arena, he may enjoy the
upper hand. Starr, in turn, is likely to add weight to suspicions
that the president lied and covered up a relationship with former
White House intern Monica Lewinsky, framing his report around
perjury and obstruction of justice, not sex.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the immediate outcome, lawyers interviewed about the
long term effects of Starr's seven-month-long sex and perjury
investigation said that both institutions at the center of the
legal storm, the presidency and the office of the independent
counsel, had been grievously harmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both have been seriously hurt,'' said C. Boyden Gray, who
served as White House counsel to President Bush. Gray said he
doubted the independent counsel statue would be reauthorized when
it is set to be renewed in two years. He also said that the White
House's losing court battles to assert attorney-client privilege,
executive privilege and a protective privilege for the Secret
Service had all diminished the office of the presidency itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``The White House made a big mistake in litigating all these
things because it has weakened the presidency,'' Gray said.
``There's been a cutback in the leverage and bargaining power.
These things have been lost forever for every future president.
It's now clearly law.''
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd Cutler, a Democratic lawyer who served as Clinton's second
White House counsel, agreed that the court fights over these
privileges had hurt the office of the presidency in both the near
and long term, though he said the White House was not wrong to
litigate them. He emphasized a lack of prosecutorial discretion on
Starr's part.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody has ever pushed the envelope so far,'' Cutler said.
``No president has ever been subpoenaed before to testify about his
own alleged criminal conduct. I don't question the independent
counsel's right to do so. But there is such a thing as
prosecutorial discretion.''
</P>
<P>
   In resisting the independent counsel's attempts to question his
closest advisers and the agents who protect him, Clinton has
portrayed himself as fighting for political survival, against what
he and his wife have characterized as an unfairly intrusive,
partisan witch-hunt.
</P>
<P>
   The suspicions of bad faith on both sides have meant that the
White House and the independent counsel have both been determined
to fight every issue to the hilt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither one of them wants to give an inch,'' said E. Lawrence
Barcella Jr., a former federal prosecutor, who likened the struggle
to a cafeteria food fight. ``The independent counsel isn't going to
develop perspective and restraint he never had and the president
isn't suddenly going to decide to give in to this four-year
obsession.''
</P>
<P>
   While few would predict a victor in the battle, there was wide
agreement that when the independent counsel statute comes up for
re-authorization next year, it will face dim prospects for renewal
in its current form. Even Lawrence Walsh, the independent counsel
who spent six years and $40 million investigating the Iran-contra
affair, said he felt the statute should only apply to offenses
committed sitting presidents relating to their official duties. He
also said he worried that a long-term consequence of the Lewinsky
investigation was ``the burlesquing of law enforcement in this
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the inner workings of the White House have already
been affected by years of investigative scrutiny. For example,
White House lawyers are now careful not to take notes, Cutler said.
``When the attorney-client privilege with a government lawyer is
virtually destroyed, that means you don't dare take notes,'' he
explained. ``You are going to be cautious about what you say and
the president will be cautious about what he tells you. That's a
serious blow to the presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   However the battle between Clinton and Starr is decided, its
levels of harsh rhetoric and polarizing effects have further
coarsened the tone of political life.
</P>
<P>
   ``This episode, however it turns out, will be listed along with
Watergate and the Vietnam War as another benchmark of our cynicism
toward our institutions,'' lamented Sen. Fred Thompson, the
Republican chairman of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, a
former prosecutor who is thought to be considering a run for the
White House. ``It's another one of those public, traumatic events,
whatever or whoever's side you are on.''

 &HT;    CLINTON STRIVES TO SURVIVE SCANDAL
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON In the aftermath of his secret grand jury testimony
and his admission of having lied to the public about his affair
with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky, President Clinton
urgently sought on Tuesday to rally his political supporters and
salvage what remains of his beleaguered presidency.
</P>
<P>
   While in his Monday night remarks Clinton had forcefully called
for independent counsel Kenneth Starr to end his investigation and
for the nation to ``turn away from the spectacle of the past seven
months,'' there were signs that his call would not be heeded.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not over,'' one senior Democrat, Rep. Lee Hamilton of
Indiana, cautioned in undermining Clinton's bid to declare a
unilateral end to the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Another Democrat, retiring Rep. Paul McHale of Pennsylvania,
said ``perjury is not excused by an apology compelled by
overwhelming evidence and delivered under pressure.'' Clinton, he
added, ``should resign or face impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   Alone among congressional Republican leaders, House Republican
Whip Tom DeLay of Texas called on Clinton to resign. ``Clearly, the
president has done irreparable damage to the office of the
presidency. More troubling, the president has lied to his family,
his friends, his Cabinet, the Congress and the American people,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   But House Speaker Newt Gingrich cautioned fellow Republicans to
reserve final judgment on the president until they receive Starr's
investigative report, expected within weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that everyone would be best served if they waited for
Judge Starr's report and found out what all the facts were,''
Gingrich told reporters in his native Georgia. ``We'd all like to
get that done as quickly as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile Tuesday, First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, through
her spokeswoman Marsha Berry, said she ``believes in this
marriage'' despite her husband's most recent infidelity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her love for him is compassionate and steadfast,'' Berry said,
adding that Mrs. Clinton has forgiven her husband. ``She clearly is
uncomfortable with her personal life being made so public.''
</P>
<P>
   With Clinton's mid-afternoon departure for a 12-day vacation on
Martha's Vineyard, accompanied hand-in-hand by his wife and
daughter Chelsea, the focus returned to Starr and the legal options
open to the independent counsel in pursuing a perjury and
obstruction of justice case against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Starr promptly summoned Lewinsky, the 25-year-old woman behind
the scandal, to testify again on Thursday before the grand jury
under a broad grant of immunity. She had already told the grand
jury that she had a affair with Clinton, which the president
characterized on Monday as a liaison that was ``not appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   After Lewinsky testifies anew, Starr must decide whether to seek
a subpoena that would force the president to answer specific
questions about the sexual nature of his 18-month relationship with
her. Clinton's personal lawyers would almost certainly challenge
any such subpoena, which could drag out the case further while
raising fresh constitutional issues.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's private attorney David Kendall acknowledged that the
president did not answer in detail ``a very few highly intrusive
</P>
<P>
   questions'' put to him in his session with Starr's prosecutorial
team in the Map Room of the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Both Clinton and Lewinsky had denied the affair under oath in
January in statements in the Paula Jones sexual harassment suit.
But Lewinsky told the grand jurors on Aug. 6 that the two did in
fact have a sexual relationship and that they had discussed ways of
covering it up.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, the grand jury continued to meet on Tuesday, hearing,
for more than four hours, former Clinton adviser Dick Morris
describe his conversations with the president shortly after the
scandal broke in January. Morris, a former Clinton political
strategist, resigned from the re-election campaign in 1996 over his
own sexual scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not Starr succeeds in eliciting further testimony
from Clinton, he is well along in writing a report to Congress,
which should reach the lawmakers by mid-September. They must then
decide whether to deal with it quickly or to hold it in abeyance
beyond November's mid-term elections.
</P>
<P>
   On that score, Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., who chairs the House
Judiciary Committee, said on Tuesday that it would be foolish to
speculate now on how Congress will proceed until Starr actually
submits his report.
</P>
<P>
   ``If and when the independent counsel sends such a report, it is
reasonable to expect answers to many as yet unanswered questions,''
Hyde said. ``It is our constitutional duty to provide a fair, full
and independent review of these facts in their proper context.'' he
concluded.
</P>
<P>
   The law under which Starr was named requires that such a report
be based on ``substantial and credible evidence'' that the
president committed an impeachable offense.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Clinton is able to duck a full-scale impeachment
hearing, he must still show that he is an effective leader in light
of the damage cause by the Lewinsky affair and the subsequent
cover-up.
</P>
<P>
   For Clinton, that process began on Tuesday with calls to more
than a dozen key Democratic members of Congress who have been his
most stalwart supporters.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Mike McCurry said Clinton was ``very
encouraged by these exchanges'' in which the president again voiced
his regret over what he had done and accepted responsibility for
his actions.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also apologized individually to several senior members
of his staff who had been most vocal in their public backing of his
denials over the seven months since the scandal broke, McCurry
said.
</P>
<P>
   The president has placed a ``top priority'' on making amends to
Hillary, his wife of 20 years, and 18-year-old Chelsea, who will
begin her sophomore year at Stanford in September.
</P>
<P>
   Berry, the first lady's press secretary, said that Mrs. Clinton
still loved her husband deeply and was committed to him. ``This has
certainly not been the best day of her life,'' Berry said, but
added that she had a strong religious faith upon which she relied.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ For her loyalty to the president, Mary Allen had
endured the snickers and condescending smirks from friends, a
sister, her husband.
</P>
<P>
   A lifelong Democrat, she spent seven months believing and
defending Bill Clinton's denials of a sexual relationship with a
former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I feel pretty foolish,'' said Ms. Allen.
</P>
<P>
   As the 41-year-old woman watched President Clinton acknowledge
on television Monday that he ``misled people'' about his
relationship with Monica Lewinsky, she simply shook her head with
disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   Like the majority of Americans, Ms. Allen does not believe the
president should lose his job, or that the investigation
spearheaded by Ken Starr has been worth the time and money spent.
In fact, she still believes Clinton has done a good job as a world
leader and steward of the nation's economy.
</P>
<P>
   But she said she will never trust him again.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked us right in the eye and lied to us,'' said Ms.
Allen, recalling the president's impassioned, finger-wagging, ``now
listen to me'' insistence that he had never had sexual relations
with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   In this old Middle American city of smokestacks and church
spires, a hard-working place famous for making Harley Davidson
motorcycles and Miller beer, people seemed intrigued with the
steamy details of the president's predicament, even as they
professed a weariness about the long-running national soap opera.
</P>
<P>
   To most people, it amounts to a sorry mess that has no heroes
and plenty of villains: a flawed president, an overzealous
prosecutor, back stabbing co-workers, arrogant lawyers, spin
artists and intrusive journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from more than two dozen interviews in this metropolis
of about 1.4 million people _ at outdoor cafes on the trendy East
Side, on the broom-swept sidewalks of immigrant neighborhoods, at
the campus of Marquette University, inside the gleaming shopping
malls on suburban Bluemound Road _ many voters found Clinton's
televised talk to be rather disturbing.
</P>
<P>
   Most also expressed alarm at the president's apparent
recklessness and said they were disappointed in his actions, his
foot-dragging and what they saw as his half-hearted apology.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't help himself with this speech,'' said Terry Welch,
45, whose family owns a business that makes leather finishes in
Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   Characterizing the president's talk as more legalistic than
candid, Welch said Clinton is becoming something of a parody.
``When you have to listen to his tenses of speech _ subjunctive?
conditional? _ you've got some problems with credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   The host of a radio call-in show on WISN, Jerry Bott, noted that
Clinton's speech were conspicuously missing two words: ``I'm
sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   A caller named Patrice said she was angry about the president's
tone. ``He was defiant,'' she said, ``like he dared us to even
question him.''
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of voters say the president's private life is nobody's
business but his family's. Clinton's defenders, and even a few of
his political foes, expressed concern about a 90s brand of
McCarthyism _ inquisitors searching under every bed, not for
Communists, but for paramours.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a right to know who he's sleeping with,'' said
Jeff England, a 35-year-old stock trader. ``It makes government so
frivolous.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Van Hoof, a 45-year-old architect who lives in the leafy
Shorewood community along Lake Michigan, said there is a simple
explanation for Clinton's actions. ``Guys cheat on their wives,
that's just the way the world works,'' said Hoof, a married man,
who excepted himself from the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   But others accepted no such excuses. George Ziedonis, a
41-year-old warehouse worker who clutched a thermos as he waited
for the 7 a.m. bus, said Clinton's performance on Monday night was
characteristically riddled with wiggle words.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was true to form,'' said Ziedonis. ``He never tells the
whole truth. He lives in a fantasy world where he thinks he can go
by his own rules.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   To most people who voiced anger about Clinton, it was the lying
more than any sexual misdeed that caused the most harm.
</P>
<P>
   A city with strong Democratic leanings and a tavern on almost
every corner, Milwaukee is nonetheless known as a well-behaved,
follow-the-rules kind of town, a place where immigrants from
Germany and Eastern Europe brought their children up to respect the
flag, the police and the church. Milwaukeeans do not generally
tolerate the sorts of political shenanigans that are commonplace in
cities like Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   On the day of Clinton's address to the nation, the Milwaukee
Journal-Sentinel, a newspaper that has generally been friendly to
the president, published a searing editorial under the headline, ``
President, we've had enough.'' The next day, the newspaper's
editorial was titled, ``Clinton's speech falls woefully short.''
</P>
<P>
   If conservatives and liberals agree about anything on this case,
it is a shared lamentation that children can no longer read
newspapers or watch the television news without being confronted
with the sort of sexual talk that used to make people blush.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you imagine Walter Cronkite talking about oral sex and
semen stains?'' said Welch, the business owner.
</P>
<P>
   But on the campus of Marquette University, a Roman Catholic
institution run by the same Jesuit order of priests that educated
Clinton at Georgetown, young people say the Lewinsky case simply
reflects a looser culture, but did not shape it.
</P>
<P>
   Robyn Coleman, a 22-year-old physical therapy major at
Marquette, noted that most young people grew up watching such
risque shows as ``Melrose Place'' and ``Beverly Hills 90210.'' She
said Jerry Springer's show, a wild, profane tabloid talk show that
almost always focuses on sex, is the hottest show on campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sex is just part of life,'' said Ms. Coleman. ``People aren't
embarrassed to talk with each other about it. Unless maybe it's
with your parents, you know.''
</P>
<P>
   In this sordid case, the deepest sympathies among voters,
Democrats and Republicans, lie with the president's daughter,
Chelsea, a student at Stanford University. Most people voice
support for Mrs. Clinton. But there is even some measure of
disappointment with her.
</P>
<P>
   To Ms. Allen, the suburban homemaker, Mrs. Clinton has
disappointed those who cheered her as a symbol of strong womanhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's lost credibility on women's rights,'' said Ms. Allen,
the mother of two young children. ``How can you have any respect
for a woman who puts up with a marriage like that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Ralph Gross, a man who is in the business of hearing
confessions, voiced concern over the sense of righteousness and
angry judgment that seems to prevail among many Americans today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm troubled by this hunger for details,'' said the
54-year-old Catholic priest, adding that Clinton's acknowledgment
of having done wrong should suffice, without a specific accounting
of sexual misdeeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must be very careful about making judgments. People
struggle with different parts of their lives. For some people, it's
lust. For others, its racism or sexism. Let's be forgiving and
leave the judging to God.''

<P>
   A day after President Clinton's speech to the nation on his
relationship with Monica Lewinsky, members of his Cabinet who
expressed strong support for him after learning of the allegations
in January had this to say Tuesday:
</P>
<P>
   William M. Daley, Secretary of Commerce:
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a very difficult thing for the president, to address
the people and apologize for his actions. It's a difficult thing
for him, for his family, for all of us.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believed the president in January, as did the vast majority
of the American people, according to the polls. He has now come
forward and stated the facts. His apology and his statement are
enough for me. The facts turned out to be different from what we
were told and believed. But there is no reason for us to dwell on
something that was said seven months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish the situation was what he said in January. But it
isn't. So let's move on.
</P>
<P>
   ``My reaction is one of sorrow. The president has apologized. He
wants to move on and do what the American people elected him to do
_ govern.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew M. Cuomo, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development:
</P>
<P>
   ``The president's statement to the American people took real
courage. I respect and applaud him for taking responsibility for
his actions. My heart goes out to the president and his family at
this difficult time. The president has now spoken to the American
people. We should get on with the work of this nation, build on the
president's many achievements in office, and work to address the
serious issues that affect the lives of our people.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard W. Riley, Secretary of Education:
</P>
<P>
   ``The president made a a strong statement last night. He took
complete responsibility for what he called a `personal failure' on
his part. I am pleased that he came forward and took full
responsibility for his actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am relieved. We can now put this behind us so we can
continue to do our work on behalf of the American people. The
president's charge to the Cabinet all along has been to maintain
our focus on our work, and that's what I've been doing. Education
is a terribly important issue to the American people, and that's
where we need to keep our energy.''
</P>
<P>
   Madeleine K. Albright, Secretary of State, in Tanzania:
</P>
<P>
   ``This might not be the time or place to have this kind of
discussion. I have come to Africa on a mission of help and healing,
but I would like to state that I have complete confidence in the
president, and he is doing a terrific job for the United States,
both domestically and in terms of our foreign policy, and he has
urged all of us to put this behind us, and for all of us to do our
jobs, and that is what I think I am doing here.''

REPORTS CITE BENEFITS OF BETA BLOCKERS IN CORONARIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY TYE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of Americans die each year because doctors
fail to prescribe beta blocker drugs that can substantially improve
survival after a first heart attack, according to two reports that
are expected to reshape the way doctors treat heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   One of the studies, in the New England Journal of Medicine
published Wednesday, says the pills work so well that virtually
every heart attack patient should take them, even if they suffer
lung problems, diabetes or other severe conditions. Doctors
currently shy away from giving such patients beta blockers for fear
they will aggravate those conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The second report, in the Journal of the American Medical
Association, published Wednesday, also found strong evidence that
beta blockers are drastically underutilized. But it stopped short
of recommending use by heart attack survivors who have other severe
ailments.
</P>
<P>
   Taken together, the two studies ``are going to wake up people,''
predicts Dr. Valentin Fuster, president of the American Heart
Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened before is that many times we didn't give beta
blockers even to patients who didn't have risk factors. Now doctors
are going to be giving them,'' Fuster adds. ``If we do this right
we'll save tens of thousands of lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The JAMA study analyzed the nationwide pattern of use of beta
blockers, a class of drugs that lower blood pressure, reduce the
heart's demand for oxygen and otherwise spare it stress that can
produce additional attacks. The authors reviewed hospital discharge
records in 1994 and 1995 of 45,308 Medicaid patients who had
survived a heart attack and were considered ``ideal'' candidates
for beta blockers because they did not suffer severe asthma, very
low blood pressure or other conditions the drugs could aggravate.
</P>
<P>
   The most disturbing finding was that half of those elderly heart
attack survivors were not prescribed beta blockers when they
checked out of the hospital. The price they paid was clear: A year
after discharge, those who hadn't been given the drug were 14
percent less likely to be alive.
</P>
<P>
   Use of the drugs varied by region: doctors in New England
prescribed them to 72.6 percent of their patients, compared to just
30.3 percent in Mississippi and 33.5 percent in Arkansas and
Oklahoma. Patients admitted by cardiologists and internists,
meanwhile, were much more likely to be prescribed beta blockers
than those admitted by general practitioners.
</P>
<P>
   ``There seems to be a huge opportunity to do better'' in getting
the drugs to patients who could benefit, concludes Dr. Harlan M.
Krumholz, lead author of the JAMA study and associate professor at
Yale University School of Medicine. ``We wouldn't accept this level
of problem with the airline industry. We're trying to develop
systems in medicine that enhance this decision-making.''
</P>
<P>
   The New England Journal study examined 201,752 Medicaid records
of patients discharged after a heart attack, which included
patients who suffered other severe conditions that doctors fear
could make beta blockers dangerous. It zeroed in on a different
question: In the real world, do patients with such conditions
benefit from beta blockers despite the presumed risk?
</P>
<P>
   The answer was surprising and controversial. Patients with
pulmonary disease, diabetes and other ailments thought to preclude
them from taking beta blockers all had lower death rates taking the
drug than their counterparts who didn't. The reductions were as
high as 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Does that mean every heart attack survivor should be taking beta
blockers, regardless of their other medical problems?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is yes, since ``almost everybody'' will benefit,
argues Dr. Stephen S. Gottlieb, lead author of the New England
Journal study, which was released a day early to coincide with the
JAMA report. ``There are occasionally people who get side effects,
and if you're worried about somebody, watch them carefully. If
somebody does have side effects, you stop using the drug on that
particular person.''
</P>
<P>
   Fuster, the Heart Association president who runs the
Cardiovascular Institute at Mt. Sinai Medical Center in New York,
takes a similar view: ``You have to think about using beta blockers
on everybody, but using your clinical judgement. If a patient has
very severe cardiac failure or pulmonary disease, you might have to
be cautious.''
</P>
<P>
   Krumholz, who coauthored an editorial in the New England
Journal, is more reserved, echoing the recommendations of the Heart
Association and other groups. Gottlieb's study, Krumholz says,
fails to distinguish people with minor side effects from those with
severe ones. With the latter, he adds, ``it would be a mistake to
challenge them with beta blockers.''
</P>
<P>
   While they disagree about ``high-risk'' patients, those and
other heart specialists agree that far too few heart attack
survivors are taking beta blockers, in part because the pills are
available in generic form, which makes them so cheap that drug
companies feel it is unprofitable to promote them.
</P>
<P>
   A study released earlier this summer that doubted the
effectiveness of beta blockers also may have created confusion. But
that report dealt only with people who have high blood pressure but
not underlying heart troubles. ``There's no question in my mind
that beta blockers are a cornerstone for treatment'' in patients
who already have had a heart attack, says Dr. Franz Messerli,
author of that earlier study.

FOREIGN INVESTORS' WORRIES SLOW RUSSIA ON RESTRUCTURING PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: See also RUSSIA-MARKETPLACE, RUSSIA-DEBT) 
(mk) 
 By CELESTINE BOHLEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The Russian government Tuesday night put off the
announcement of its plan to restructure ruble-denominated
government debt, after alarm spread in the world's financial
community that Russia was prepared to discriminate against foreign
creditors.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Prime Minister Boris Fyodorov, now in charge of Russian
economic policy, said he would first review the plan with
representatives of J.P. Morgan and Deutsche Bank. Details of the
expected swap of treasury bills for longer-term securities, a key
element in Russia's anti-crisis program, were to be released
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors that the government was proposing a plan that would have
penalized foreign creditors in favor of Russia's own troubled banks
had swept through Moscow's foreign investment community Tuesday,
prompting warnings that such a plan would kill off any future
foreign investment in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   `'Everyone was becoming more and more nervous, and bitter,''
said one Western investment banker, who spoke on condition that he
not be identified. ``Had they gone ahead with the plan we were
hearing, it would have created enormous concerns in the investment
community. Now we feel that fairness and market practices will come
into play.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors said the government was considering proposals that
would have differentiated between foreign and Russian creditors, as
a way of shoring up its local banking system. The proposals, which
reportedly included a two-tier redemption schedule, were the
subject of heated debate Tuesday inside the government, one analyst
said.
</P>
<P>
   Trading in Russia's outstanding treasury bills was suspended on
Monday when the government announced a crisis program which imposed
a 90-day moratorium on privately held foreign debt, and set the
ruble free to float to as little as 9.5 rubles to the dollar, from
about 6.4 rubles recently.
</P>
<P>
   Russian banks and their foreign creditors are to discuss the
debt moratorium on some $4 billion in outstanding loans next
Monday. The government has stated that it will continue making
payments on its publicly-held foreign debt.
</P>
<P>
   As the value of the ruble skittered downwards at banks and
currency exchange booths across the country, shoppers and bankers,
Russians and foreigners were waiting to see who would be left
holding the bag.
</P>
<P>
   According to a countrywide survey aired on Russian television
news programs, not that many people rushed Tuesday to exchange
their rubles for dollars, preferring to wait and see where their
currency will eventually land.
</P>
<P>
   At Moscow's currency market, the value was fixed Tuesday at 6.8
rubles to the dollar _ roughly the same rate as on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, after a day of heavy trading in ruble futures.
The ruble rate in Moscow on Monday was 6.4 and in Chicago, 6.5.
</P>
<P>
   The Central Bank of Russia Tuesday said it would move against
currency traders who posted more than a 15 percent spread between
their buying and selling prices for currencies. It already had
restricted the sending of capital out of the country, and
lengthened to three days the time required to withdraw large dollar
sums from corporate bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts interpreted ruble rates of 9, 10 or even 15 to the
dollar posted at some banks and traders as the equivalent of
hanging an `out of order' sign on the teller window. `'Those are
`we don't want to trade' levels,'' said one analyst. `'Essentially,
people are waiting to see if things are going to calm down.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But for average Russians, lurking behind the devalued ruble is
the fear of inflation, similar to the kind that emptied their
pocketbooks in the early 1990s when Russia let go of Soviet-era
price controls.
</P>
<P>
   According to a survey published in Russia's leading financial
newspaper Kommersant, most food wholesalers are prepared to hold
their prices at current levels, unless the ruble ends up trading at
levels above 8 to the dollar. In interviews, traders noted that
their prices will ultimately be dictated by the market _ namely
what the average Russian can pay.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Harman, the American finance director of the
Russian-owned Cherkisovsky meat-processing company, which is
heavily dependent on imported raw meat, said the situation Tuesday
looked better than it did on Monday. `'It seems that they may have
deliberately set expectations low,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But in scattered cases, the ruble's drop was already showing up
on shelves, despite threats by the Russian tax police that they
will ride herd on those who raise prices in order to take advantage
of the confusion caused by the slide in the ruble.
</P>
<P>
   At a small grocery in central Moscow, Olga Larina, the store's
administrator, said she raised prices on imported goods 10 per cent
after suppliers announced that they would be increasing prices.
</P>
<P>
   `'We realized that this was the pattern when three of our
suppliers told us the same thing,'' she said. `'So we had to raise
our prices accordingly.'' Prices on domestically produced food,
such as milk and cheese, will stay the same at least until
September, she said.
</P>
<P>
   `'Everyone is worried,'' she said. `'You can imagine how it is
for pensions and families with many children. Imagine how worried
they are. Imagine how worried people who work in banks are.''

 &HT;    CONGRESSIONAL CENSURE OFFERS LAWMAKERS A MIDDLE GROUND ON
CLINTON
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Only if and when independent counsel Kenneth Starr
sends a report to Congress on the results of his investigation of
President Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky will
lawmakers have the means to determine the president's proper
punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Between the two most talked-about options _ the momentous step
of impeachment and doing nothing _ lies a novel political middle
ground.
</P>
<P>
   A resolution of censure, a well-established form of
congressional punishment of a lawmaker less severe than expulsion,
would be one way for Congress to express its distaste for Clinton's
actions. It would have no legal consequences, but would serve as a
``tangible sign of the dimunition of the president's political and
moral authority,'' said John Bolton, a former assistant Attorney
General in the Reagan and Bush administrations.
</P>
<P>
   The idea also drew support from Leon Panetta, Clinton's former
chief of staff, who told USA Today that a censure vote ``would be
to everyone's advantage'' because it would allow Clinton to remain
in office, Congress to express itself and healing to begin.
</P>
<P>
   The House has used the penalty to discipline members who have
been involved in inappropriate sexual relationships. In 1983, the
House censured Rep. Daniel Crane, R-Ill., for his affair with a
17-year-old female page and Rep. Gerry Studds, D-Mass., for his
sexual relationship with a 17-year-old male page.
</P>
<P>
   Crane lost his next bid for re-election. Studds served in the
House until 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Speaker Newt Gingrich, who as a junior Republican unsuccessfully
urged his two colleagues' expulsion in 1983, had his speakership
threatened by a potential vote of censure following his admission
in late 1996 that he violated House ethics rules.
</P>
<P>
   Republican rules bar members who have been censured from serving
as committee chairmen and by inference, in leadership positions. In
the end, the House voted to reprimand Gingrich, a lesser penalty.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with censuring the president, according to
congressional expert Thomas Mann and Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., is that
it is an empty gesture.
</P>
<P>
   Barr complained that some House members might opt for censure
because they ``don't have the backbone for impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of a fig leaf for those who don't want to do
anything,'' Barr said.
</P>
<P>
   Mann, a scholar at the Brookings Institution in Washington,
called censure a ``cop out'' that sounds like a middle ground, but
in fact would be an irresponsible exercise that, lacking any
evidence to impeach Clinton, would further weaken him.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you care about the well-being of the country you either
want to force the man out of office,'' Mann said, ``or allow him to
conduct the remaining years of his presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   The Constitution sets out impeachment as Congress's way to deal
with a wayward president. It says nothing about any other form of
discipline.
</P>
<P>
   One has to look back 164 years for any guidance. In 1834, the
Senate censured Andrew Jackson in a dispute over the Bank of the
United States. The House refused to go along with the Senate and
Jackson ignored the Senate vote.
</P>
<P>
   When Jackson's party recaptured the Senate in 1837, Jackson's
censure was expunged from Senate records.
</P>
<P>
   There also is scant historical background to advise Congress how
to proceed if it chooses censure.
</P>
<P>
   Bolton said it seemed most likely that a vote for censure might
follow from hearings by the House Judiciary Committee into Starr's
report.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, the punishment would reflect the committee's
belief that the evidence did not warrant impeachment, but demanded
some response from Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But Bolton said a resolution of censure would not have to come
from the Judiciary Committee or even originate in the House, as
would, for instance, articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The House and Senate can pass resolutions on anything,
including whether the moon is made of bleu cheese,'' he said.

 IT'S INEVITABLE: POPE WILL DIE SOMEDAY, AND TV'S GETTING READY

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Death, unlike taxes, is still certain in Italy. Even
popes must someday die. And when the pope is as towering a figure
as John Paul II, there is one other certainty: Every major
television news organization will someday need a room with a view.
</P>
<P>
   More precisely, American networks will need a large terrace with
a good view of St. Peter's Basilica. CBS News recently outbid its
rivals and signed a contract with the owner of the Atlante Star
hotel for exclusive use of its 5,000-square-foot terrace
overlooking the Vatican for live stand-ups by anchor Dan Rather and
others.
</P>
<P>
   The timing, obviously, is unknown. The price, says the owner,
Benito Mencucci, is about $180,000 for however long the news event
lasts. The fee also covers use of the terrace during the year 2,000
Jubilee. (CBS News officials said the figure was incorrect, but
declined to give a precise one.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I am relieved it's over,'' Mencucci said of the drawn-out
negotiations. ``It was all very embarrassing. For the past year and
a half, not a day went by without some TV person calling about the
terrace. First the Japanese, then the Germans, then the
Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he felt a special bond to the pope, whom he met at a
papal audience two years ago. ``But we had to reach a decision,''
he said. ``Unfortunately death is inevitable for all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Vatican officials view such talk as disrespectful to the
79-year-old pope, who, despite reports that he is suffering from
Parkinson's disease, nevertheless keeps up an astonishingly full
and vigorous schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is never great to talk about death,'' said a Vatican
spokesman, the Rev. Ciro Benedettini. ``I understand the exigencies
of news reporters but it is not a very pleasant subject for those
of us who work with His Holiness.''
</P>
<P>
   When dealing with the Holy See, television producers politely
refer to their contingency plans as preparation for the millennium
_ which the pope has made clear he has every intention of
celebrating on earth.
</P>
<P>
   But his health could fail before 2000. Network executives say
they cannot afford to neglect preparing for so momentous an event.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it happens, it will be a huge story affecting millions
and millions of people,'' said John Paxson, the London bureau chief
of CBS News, who is coordinating contingency Vatican coverage.
``Your ability to preorganize has a lot to do with how well you
cover the story.''
</P>
<P>
   As the unexpected and relentlessly broadcasted funeral of
Princess Diana most recently revealed, television coverage has
changed enormously since John Paul II was elected in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the United States had only three networks, and little live
coverage. Modern technology now allows even small stations and
network affiliates to cover events as they happen in many parts of
the world. In addition to CNN, many networks also have 24-hour
cable news shows.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals from 62 countries will be among the contenders to
replace John Paul II, and virtually all of those countries will
want their own networks to cover the conclave. The American
networks have been seeking positions that allow them to film the
white smoke drifting out of the Sistine Chapel that signals that a
new pope has been elected.
</P>
<P>
   Discreetly, but feverishly, American, British, Japanese and many
other broadcasters have been wheeling and dealing and wining and
dining in search for an edge on the competition _ staking out
camera positions, plotting feature pieces, signing up expert
commentators and making the right friends in high places. NBC News,
for example, hired as its Rome producer the son of the Vatican
official who is the gatekeeper for all photography and electronic
media.
</P>
<P>
   ABC News has reportedly won exclusive rights to the Hilton,
perched on a hill that overlooks Vatican City, though neither the
network nor the hotel management would confirm it.
</P>
<P>
   CNN producers also declined to reveal their planned location.
Rome is awash with rumors that the Atlanta-based news organization
is negotiating an arrangement to work out of a church-owned
property with an excellent view of the Vatican. If true, that would
be quite a coup.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best locations are the private houses, but most of them
are owned by the Vatican,'' one network producer in Rome said.
``But as long as the pope is alive, the Vatican is not going to
countenance any deals between foreign barbarians and themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The Italian press, however, is fascinated by foreign barbarians.
The Roman daily newspaper Il Messagero headlined a recent article
about the terrace wars with the words, ``The Pope: Heaven Can Wait,
the Networks Cannot.''
</P>
<P>
   Many other countries take a pragmatic view of preparing for the
death of national figures. The BBC, for example, conducts a
technical rehearsal of its coverage of the Queen Mother's funeral
every six weeks. But in superstition-prone Italy so blunt an
approach is considered by many as bad luck or bad form.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is so indelicate to write about such things,'' said Walter
Cantini, manager of the Hotel Columbus, three short blocks from the
Vatican, which owns the hotel. ``I find it squalid and ugly.''
</P>
<P>
   Cantini pointed out that his hotel, on Via della Conciliazone,
has no terrace, but he said that he would not allow any advance
negotiations for its use even if it did.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody at our hotel is hoping to profit from such an event,''
he said indignantly. ``It's ghoulish _ as if they are praying for
it to happen.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Yet even the Vatican has quietly undertaken some advance
preparations. In past conclaves, the 100 or so cardinals were
jammed into makeshift and uncomfortable quarters scattered across
the Apostolic Palace. Next time, they will reside inside the
Vatican walls in the recently completed motel-like St. Martha's
Residence several hundred yards from the Sistine Chapel, where the
deliberations take place.
</P>
<P>
   News media accommodations, however, are more difficult to plan,
and that is one reason most television producers seem to be praying
for the pope to live well into the 21st century. At least 5,000
journalists are expected to hurtle into Rome for a papal funeral,
and in the high season, hotel occupancy in Rome is normally 90
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican is already beginning to convert dozens of church
buildings into hostels in anticipation of the jubilee, when
millions of pilgrims are planning to visit the Holy City. Those
will not be ready much before 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the pope dies after the millennium, some of that space
could be made available to the media,'' one network producer in
Rome said. ``If he dies before then, it will be a logistical
nightmare.''

FORMER EAST GERMAN COMMUNISTS FACE ELECTORAL HURDLE 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   POTSDAM, Germany _ The red velvet curtain parted and Gregor Gysi
rode out on a baby elephant, circling the ring to the thunderous
applause of 800 or so supporters jammed into a sweltering circus
tent.
</P>
<P>
   With national elections six weeks off, things are going so
poorly for Gysi, 50, the head of the former East German Communist
Party, that the party has turned to a circus to draw attention.
Although the party has been successful locally in eastern German
states, Gysi said that the national vote is the biggest test for
the party since 1990, when it renamed itself the Party of
Democratic Socialism.
</P>
<P>
   A party qualifies for seats in Parliament by winning at least 5
percent of the vote nationwide, and recent surveys put Gysi's party
at about 4.4 percent. By a quirk in election rules, a party that
wins three head-to-head races is allowed its full proportional
share of seats, and that is the route the party took into
Parliament in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Under German electoral law, voters cast one vote for a candidate
and a second for a party.
</P>
<P>
   But if they are to solidify their position in national politics,
Gysi said in an interview, the Democratic Socialists must clear the
5 percent hurdle. ``Any less than that would not be a success,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd at the circus was a mix of longtime Communists and
others dissatisfied with some aspect of German unification. Gysi
said the party's roots in the east make it an advocate of eastern
concerns, like battling unemployment and challenging as
discriminatory the government's refusal to recognize professional
qualifications from the former East Germany.
</P>
<P>
   When Germany was unified eight years ago, many analysts expected
the former Communists to fade quickly. But they have grown to
considerable strength, playing a role in government in several
eastern states. Yet as Germany slowly knits together, the party's
roots in the east are weakening. ``People are moving away, new
people moving in, and there's a growing right-wing potential,''
Gysi said.
</P>
<P>
   In western Germany, where the party is still identified with
communism, Gysi says he would be happy to double the vote the party
received in 1994 _ to 600,000, from 300,000. But with 60 million
people in western Germany, he acknowledges that those numbers are
just a drop in the bucket. The big hope remains in the east, in
strongholds in Berlin and cities of Brandenburg state, like
Potsdam. Yet even here, Gysi (pronounced GHEE-zee) is running hard.
</P>
<P>
   Far-right parties are drawing a protest vote and cutting into
Democratic Socialist strength, and Gysi has come under fire from
his own left wing. When the party sent a letter recently to former
German President Richard von Weizsacker, acknowledging communist
responsibility for injustices in the former East Germany, the
leader of the party's left wing, Sarah Wagenknecht, denounced it as
a groveling gesture that would cost the party votes.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, recent surveys show that while Christian Democratic
Chancellor Helmut Kohl still trails his Social Democratic
challenger, Gerhard Schroeder, the gap is closing. Thus, some of
Gysi's followers, fearful that Schroeder's left-oriented Social
Democrats could lose their first chance in 16 years to lead the
government, appear set to split the ballots provided by German
electoral law, casting one for Gysi's candidates, and a second for
Schroeder's Social Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   In the former East Germany, Gysi carved out a niche for himself
as a maverick lawyer, defending dissidents and heading a Communist
Party committee that spearheaded a belated reform in 1989, just
before the Berlin Wall fell. But in some ways, his notoriety before
unification makes him a complication for a party seeking to free
itself of the old communist taint.
</P>
<P>
   Witty and acerbic, Gysi is credited with leading the party's
transformation to a democratic force, but he he has earned himself
many enemies. He has been accused repeatedly of informing for the
Stasi, the old communist secret police. He vehemently rejects those
charges, but a parliamentary committee recently concluded recently
that the charges were true.
</P>
<P>
   Gysi also happens to be one of the most prominent Jews in German
politics, and the polemics take on particular poignancy at a time
when reunited Germany is grappling with issues of national identity
and guilt.
</P>
<P>
   Gysi said he believes Schroeder's preferred outcome would be a
``grand coalition'' with the Christian Democrats. If that failed,
and Schroeder accepted the environmental Green Party as a partner
in a ``red-green'' coalition, then the Democratic Socialists would
support such a government issue by issue, he said.
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, could broaden the former Communists' role in
national politics. It is the only German party that opposes the
European single currency, the euro, not because it believes it to
be a bad idea, but because unification of European labor law is not
keeping step. It also opposes German participation in U.N.
peacekeeping missions.
</P>
<P>
   But as for a 1990 party platform that calls for the dissolution
of NATO, to follow that of the former Soviet-led Warsaw Pact, Gysi
is uneasy with that position today.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bit out of date,'' he said.

   ECON-REPORT (Washington) _ The Fed's policy-making committee
meets and is expected to leave interest rates unchanged. Two
economic reports are issued. One shows that consumer prices rose
0.2 percent last month and that the core rate, which strips out
volatile food and energy costs, increased by the same amount. The
other shows that the trade deficit in goods and services narrowed
during June for the first time this year, shrinking to $14.15
billion from a record $15.54 billion in May. Exports of goods and
services fell half a percent in June, while imports declined 2
percent. By Sylvia Nasar.

 By TODD S. PURDUM    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It was just over four minutes long, barely 500
words, the shortest big speech of Bill Clinton's presidency. It had
to satisfy the president's lawyers, his public and his wife, and it
came together only after a grueling day of testimony to a federal
grand jury and frantic final tinkering.
</P>
<P>
   But in its tone and content, in its blend of unapologetic
umbrage and tightly conditioned admission, the president's mea
culpa was minima, and deeply personal. Begun in his own
backward-slanting handwriting, annealed with the iron-willed anger
of his wife, the speech was pure Bill Clinton, for better and
worse.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, senior aides said, the president was
determined to vent his frustration at what he sees as Kenneth
Starr's unjustified investigation, an approach strongly seconded by
the first lady, Hillary Rodham Clinton, but by virtually none of
the White House staff.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton confidants said Tuesday that a subsequent draft,
prepared early Monday by the longtime adviser Paul Begala, struck a
softer, elegiac tone of regret for the trouble Clinton had caused
to an office he had dreamed of since he was a boy.
</P>
<P>
   But after the president spent more than four tense hours with
Starr and his investigators, and returned grim-faced to the
solarium in the family quarters, his lawyer, David Kendall, and
Mrs. Clinton pressed for a steelier tone. The first lady finally
sealed the question by telling her husband that it was his speech
and he should say what he wanted. It was precisely the advice she
had given him as he struggled to finish the longest speech of his
tenure, the 1995 State of the Union, which lasted 81 minutes, a
speech that journalists labeled a failure but one the public
ultimately embraced.
</P>
<P>
   ``The staff didn't want to say anything about Starr,'' one aide
said. ``But this is uniquely his, much more than any policy
address, uniquely his. I don't think he was desperately interested
in the entreaties of his advisers.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, aides said, it was Clinton's profound distrust of Starr
that had helped drive the president's seven-month strategy of
delay, denial and attack, because he worried that Starr would not
accept whatever he might say. In the end, Clinton was determined
that any concession get in his licks, too.
</P>
<P>
   From its emphasis on accepting responsibility to its closing
call to ``repair the fabric of our national discourse,'' the
speech's language and images echoed the notions of Clinton's 1992
and 1996 campaigns and his second inaugural address last year. The
attack on an investigation that has ``gone on too long, cost too
much, and hurt too many people,'' played to the public's
poll-tested distaste for Kenneth Starr and its desire for an end to
the drama.
</P>
<P>
   The president's rhetorical arguments _ in which he tried to
square ``legally accurate'' answers with confessions of a ``false
impression'' _ were also entirely consistent with Clinton's past
lawyerly responses to the crises of credibility that have
periodically bedeviled him: it was an apology for sex, lies and
audiotape that never used any of those words.
</P>
<P>
   ``The family feels that whatever the faults of the father and
the husband, the fact that the mother and the daughter have had to
endure this excruciating public venting of this issue _ Ken Starr's
responsible for that,'' one aide said, insisting on anonymity.
``The president probably said something that his wife wanted
said.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To paraphrase Queen Victoria, she was not amused,'' said James
Carville, one of the original architects of Clinton's 1992 victory,
who went to the White House to offer moral support in the hours
before the speech was delivered.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Mrs. Clinton complained that a ``vast, right-wing
conspiracy,'' was bent on her husband's downfall, and Clinton's
denunciation of the ``politically inspired lawsuit'' brought by
Paula Corbin Jones and his demand that ``it is time to stop the
pursuit of personal destruction and the prying into private lives''
amplified his wife's accusation.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton confidants said that Sidney Blumenthal, the White House
communications aide who has often fostered conspiracy notions, had
sent suggestions from his vacation in Italy. The Clintons' old
friends, the Hollywood producers Harry and Linda Bloodworth
Thomason, were on hand to provide informal advice, and sat in the
Map Room during the televised speech.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has been sampling public opinion throughout this
crisis and public polls suggest those arguments may carry weight
with one important part of Clinton's intended audience _ television
viewers and voters at home.
</P>
<P>
   A CBS News Poll last week found that two-thirds of the public
see ``this whole situation more as a private matter having to do
with Bill Clinton's personal life'' as compared to a public matter
relating to his job as president, although 7 in 10 Americans at
least leaned to the belief that Clinton had an affair with Monica
Lewinsky and nearly half said they thought that he encouraged her
to lie under oath.
</P>
<P>
   The same poll found that 6 in 10 Americans see Starr's
investigation as a partisan attempt to damage the president, and
two-thirds said that regardless of what the president might have
done, the country would have been better off if the Lewinsky
investigation had never begun.
</P>
<P>
   But most aides, who worried about the president's other audience
_ congressional Republicans _ regretted that he chose to lambaste
Starr's investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there were many people who thought he should
have complicated what was a heartfelt act of contrition'' by
talking about the independent counsel, one senior aide said. ``But
he was going to be honest in talking about how he felt. He's the
president and we're not.''

COURSE TAKES TOLL IN OPENING ROUND OF COLLEGIATE PLAYERS
TOURNAMENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By J. DOUGLAS FOSTER 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EULESS, Texas _ Rather than focusing on the competition in
yesterday's opening round of the Collegiate Players Tour National
Championship, most players found the Texas Star Golf Course to be
the real challenge.
</P>
<P>
   And in most cases, the course _ at least for this day _ walked
away victorious.
</P>
<P>
   Only two players in either the men's or women's fields shot
below par yesterday, the lowest of those scores being a 2-under-par
69 posted by C.W. Mallon of Trophy Club. Of the 84 players in the
field, 77 shot above par 71 in the first of three rounds of the
championship.
</P>
<P>
   Considering how tough Texas Star played, Mallon, a junior at
Rice, had to be more than pleased with his round. The 20-year-old
left-hander recorded birdies on the par-3 No. 3, the par-5 No. 7
and the par-4 No. 9 on the way to a 33 on the front. He recorded
two more birdies on the back to finish round one with a one-stroke
lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``The course is playing pretty hard, but I was hitting it pretty
well and I made some putts,'' Mallon said. ``I've just got to try
and keep the same mentality the last two days. You've just got to
keep it in play and make some putts.''
</P>
<P>
   Mallon leads Joe Liley of the University of Colorado, who shot
35 on both sides for a 1-under 70. Five players are tied at
even-par 71, including Michael Pruitt, an incoming freshman at
North Texas, and Dallas' Patrick Hawkins, who attends the
University of San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Duke's Anne Cardea grabbed a one-stroke lead in the women's
division with an even-par 71. The 20-year-old from Midlothian, Va.,
had two front-nine birdies to balance out two bogeys on the back
nine. She needed just 30 putts to finish the round.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't hit a bad shot until my 17th hole,'' Cardea said. ``I
hit it in the bunker there, but I still got it within 15 feet and
made par. I got up and down a lot today.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardea holds a one-stroke lead over Mansfield's Carrie Cole, who
leaves for the University of Tennessee after the championship, and
TCU golfer senior Shannon Fisher. Cole shot a 2-under 33 on the
front nine, but bogeyed three holes on the back _ including the two
par-5s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've just got to putt a little better,'' Cole said. ``I made
some good putts, but I also had a few three-putts. I've got to get
rid of those. I feel pretty good about how I'm hitting the ball. I
just need to be more consistent with my putter.''

TREASURY PRICES FALL ON FEAR THAT INFLATION COULD PICK UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ROBERT HURTADO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Prices of Treasury securities fell yesterday after a
smaller-than-expected trade deficit in June suggested that economic
growth was quickening. The news raised concern among some investors
that inflation could accelerate in the near term.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, market participants were focusing on the dollar, a
Treasury bill auction of new one-year bills and a separate report
on consumer prices.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the benchmark 30-year bond rose 6/32, to 99 7/32.
The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the
price, slipped to 5.55 percent from 5.54 percent Monday.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, Federal Reserve policy-makers left interest rates
unchanged at the end of their meeting Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Federal Reserve adhered to an unchanged monetary policy in
light of the perceived counterbalance between a slackening economic
advance, benign inflation environment, budget surplus and continued
fragility in overseas financial markets on one hand,'' said Donald
Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management, ``and robust
consumer spending and torrid housing activity on the other.''
</P>
<P>
   The dollar fell against the yen as Japanese officials said they
were ready to take action to bolster the currency. A weak dollar
makes dollar-denominated investments like Treasury securities less
attractive to foreign investors. Stocks in the United States also
gained for the second consecutive day, and that also eased some of
the flight to quality into the debt market.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the Treasury market, traders said the sale of a new
one-year bill Tuesday went off without a hitch, with the average
rate at 5 percent, the lowest since 4.965 percent on Jan. 29.

<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela _ Three weeks ago, Brazil celebrated Latin
America's largest privatization, selling its stake in the giant
phone company Telebras for almost $19 billion, roughly 70 percent
above the asking price.
</P>
<P>
   Optimism over Brazil's long-term economic prospects remains
high. But Telebras, along with a slew of other equities from here
to Buenos Aires, has taken a stomach-churning dive in value since
the auctioneer's gavel came down on July 30. Its American
depository receipts closed Tuesday at $95, down from $124.625 when
international phone companies seized the chance to buy stakes in
the Brazilian communications market.
</P>
<P>
   As the most liquid and widely traded of the Latin stocks,
Telebras _ formally Telecomunicacoes Brasilieras SA _ reflects a
broader skittishness toward emerging markets that has been building
all year, worsened by a recent new round of selloffs in Asia and
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Caracas, the market has fallen 55 percent this year.
Chilean shares are 21 percent lower, and Argentina's Merval index
has dropped by 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   This month alone, the main gauge of Brazilian equities, the
Bovespa index of Sao Paulo, dropped 19 percent. Mexican stocks,
hardest hit this year of all the major Latin American markets, have
lost 39 percent of their value. All those losses are in
local-currency terms; against the dollar, the damage is worse yet.
</P>
<P>
   Brazilian financial magazines are sounding alarms over the
``Yellow Fever'' and ``Red Hell.'' Some analysts, like Ernest
(Chip) Brown of Morgan Stanley, predict that Russia's decision
Monday to devalue the ruble as much as 34 percent and delay
payments on some debts will intensify pressure on Brazil, Argentina
and Mexico to devalue. Throughout Latin America, expectations of
economic growth have shrunk, in part because of Asian and Russian
problems, but also because domestic failures are becoming more
acute.
</P>
<P>
   In Mexico, for example, the government has raised reserve
requirements on banks for the third time this year, a move expected
to result in higher interest rates. In Colombia, four years of
Ernesto Samper's troubled presidency left public coffers empty.
With the sharp drop in oil prices, Venezuela is watching the bottom
fall out of its economy.
</P>
<P>
   Paulo Leme, chief of emerging markets at Goldman, Sachs, told
the Brazilian newspaper Gazeta Mercantil, ``Today, Russia presents
a 90 percent chance of not honoring its commitments, and, in Latin
America, there are cases in which this index reaches 50 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Eduardo Cabrera, chief Latin American strategist at Merrill
Lynch, said that despite the drop in price of Telebras shares, the
companies that bought chunks of the vast telecommunications holding
company _ MCI, Telefonica of Spain and others _ would have probably
paid the same premium Tuesday. ``Any phone company that wants to do
anything in Latin America has to be in Brazil,'' Cabrera said.
</P>
<P>
   Two months before presidential elections in Brazil, the economic
forecasts of President Fernando Henrique Cardoso and his finance
minister, Pedro Malan, are considered optimistic. Both insist that
despite international instability, Brazil, with its $70 billion in
international reserves, is far more secure than other Latin nations
or economies in Asia. They argue that investors have learned to
distinguish between Brazil's and other emerging markets.
</P>
<P>
   Investment flows in and out of Brazil, however, present a
different picture. In the first 10 days of August, investors took
out $133 million more than they invested in Brazilian equities. In
part that was general skittishness, but it also reflected a
worrisome failure on the part of Cardoso's government to control
spending and overhaul the Social Security system.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts contend that the government is holding the
Brazilian economy together with a special effort until the
elections on Oct. 4, but will be forced to devalue the currency,
the real, or finally come through with austerity measures after the
votes are counted.

IN-FLIGHT ENTERTAINMENT GOES HI TECH, BUT WITH SOME SNAFUS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ART ADV: Graphic showing what four airlines offer in in-flight
entertainment is being sent to NYT graphic clients. Non-subscribers
can make individual purchase by calling (888) 603-1036 or (888)
346-9867.)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jon Fjalstad recently boarded a Cathay Pacific Airways 747 for
the 12-hour flight from Hong Kong to Vancouver, British Columbia.
As he settled into his business-class seat facing a video screen
that normally serves up a choice of eight movies, Fjalstad was told
that the system was working for other passengers but his was on the
blink.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is almost better that you don't have it at all than that
you have it and it doesn't work,'' he later commented. ``Especially
if you see some people who have it working and yours isn't
working.''
</P>
<P>
   Virtually all the world's top airlines now offer sophisticated
systems that feature a video screen at every seat and a choice of
as many as 21 movies plus computer games, shopping and even
gambling. But the systems are expensive to install _ as much as
$4.5 million a plane _ and notoriously undependable.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the airlines feel they have little choice but to spend
hundreds of millions of dollars on them to attract and retain
customers like Fjalstad. One airline even offers first-class
passengers eyeglasses fitted with tiny liquid crystal displays.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why are the airlines crazy enough to invest in technology that
is never 100 percent reliable and extremely expensive?'' asked Karl
Laasner, the head of in-flight entertainment at Swissair, one of
the few airlines that now feature systems with video on demand.
``If you want the image of being the world's best,'' he added,
``you have to keep up.''
</P>
<P>
   Road warriors like Fjalstad, 29, an international business
consultant based in Minneapolis who flew 150,000 miles last year,
consider many factors when they are deciding which airline to fly.
Increasingly, they are thinking about which carrier has the best
selection of movies and television programs to make their long
flights more bearable.
</P>
<P>
   What used to be a battle in the skies over who served the best
steak and the finest red wine has become a war over who offers the
most films and Nintendo games.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few years ago, passengers trying to while away long hours
in the air were lucky to be able to see a single movie and to
listen to some scratchy music. Now, 80 percent of the electronics
on a new wide-body jet are in the passenger cabin, not the cockpit,
and there are more lines of code in the entertainment software than
in the programs flying the plane.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines are expected to spend $6 billion over the next five
years to equip 4,800 planes with a new generation of systems that
will deliver what vendors first promised five years ago: audio and
video on demand, an interactive system that enables passengers to
start, stop, rewind and fast-forward any one of scores of films and
TV programs at will.
</P>
<P>
   Industry executives predict that by early in the next decade the
systems will begin showing up in smaller, single-aisle planes
flying shorter routes. At the same time, passengers will also be
offered live television and Internet connections by satellite,
enabling them to watch live football games, send and receive
e-mail, surf the World Wide Web and trade stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Watching movies on airplanes dates back to the early days of
flight when a single 16-mm film was passed through a series of
projectors in the cabin at the same time. The idea of putting
dozens of personalized entertainment choices at the fingertips of
airline passengers was born in the late 1980s when the media
industry's top executives began promoting a vision of interactive
television.
</P>
<P>
   The systems were at first offered exclusively to passengers in
first and business class. Airlines like Virgin Group's Virgin
Atlantic and Singapore Airlines began making them available at
every seat on their wide-body planes in the early 1990s,
establishing a trend for the industry.
</P>
<P>
   But if offering 500 channels and movies on demand to homes on
the ground proved more difficult than many had thought, it was even
more challenging in the air.
</P>
<P>
   The video systems on planes place the equivalent of a personal
computer under every seat. Each seat is then linked to a central
computer over a high-capacity data network not that different from
the ones that connect the PCs in many offices. Complex software
determines which signal is sent to which seat.
</P>
<P>
   As many office workers know, such networks are still fairly
unreliable. At 35,000 feet, the vibration, heat and lack of
humidity in an aircraft make the environment even more hostile to
electronic equipment of all types. The personal video systems take
added abuse from spilled drinks and outright vandalism.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, vendors played down the difficulties of
making the systems work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry tempted people with things that have been a
little bit more difficult to get up and running on airplanes than
they anticipated,'' said Marco Lanza, executive vice president of
B/E Aerospace Inc., one of the largest suppliers of airplane
interiors and in-flight entertainment systems.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, B/E Aerospace spent three years developing a top-line
system for British Airways worth as much as $155 million before the
airline finally abandoned the effort last fall after numerous
delays. Northwest Airlines had a similar experience with
Hughes-Avicom, a division of the giant Hughes Electronics unit of
General Motors.
</P>
<P>
   And in 1996, United Airlines sued GEC-Marconi, a unit of General
Electric Co. of Britain when it failed to deliver on its promises
for an entertainment system designed for the first Boeing 777. (The
two sides settled their dispute out of court last fall.)
</P>
<P>
   The biggest problem with those early systems was that they
worked only 90 percent of the time, which meant that even on
flights where the systems were offered only in first and business
class, a half-dozen seats or more might out of order.
</P>
<P>
   Production delays and other problems with the systems have
caused major headaches for Boeing Co. and Europe's Airbus
Industrie, the two makers of commercial jets.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had reports of passengers who refused to get off
airplanes because their in-flight entertainment systems didn't
work,'' said Dave Sebring, the chief engineer for cabin systems at
Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   After those unhappy experiences, suppliers scaled back their
products, providing airlines with several dedicated channels of
movies and games that run simultaneously but cannot be stopped or
started at will by each passenger.
</P>
<P>
   In a wonderfully simple low-tech solution, many airlines provide
miniature videocassette players, enabling elite passengers to have
video-on-demand by choosing from a library of tapes.
</P>
<P>
   Reliability is still a problem, however. Singapore Airlines,
which prides itself on being on the leading edge of in-flight
entertainment, says its systems now function 99 percent of the
time. But the carrier's maintenance crews spend an additional 35
hours a week on each of its 56 wide-body planes meticulously
checking to make sure that every feature of the entertainment
system is working properly at every seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``My engineering colleagues told me that if they charged us the
cost I would be in shock,'' said Yeoh Teng Kwong, the airline's
manager of in-flight entertainment. Instead, the cost is part of
the company's overall maintenance budget.
</P>
<P>
   At Cathay Pacific, which Fjalstad said was still one of his
favorite carriers, reliability of its 13,000 in-seat video screens
has improved sixfold the last 18 months, according to Christopher
Gibbs, the general manager of engineering.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a painful period about two years ago,'' he added, ``but
we have gained a lot of experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Boeing and Airbus have had to step in when outside
suppliers chosen by the airlines failed to make their systems work.
Earlier this year, Frederick Mitchell, the executive who oversees
all of Boeing's commercial airplane production, said the biggest
obstacle holding up production of the wide-body 777 was in-flight
entertainment systems.
</P>
<P>
   The difficulties have led to a shakeout among the vendors.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Interactive Flight Technologies, a Phoenix-based
company that supplied Swissair with its industry-leading
video-on-demand system, said it was abandoning the in-flight
entertainment business to build a nationwide chain of dry cleaners.
</P>
<P>
   GEC-Marconi also decided to quit the business after its
difficult experience with United Airlines. And late last year,
Hughes-Avicom was bought by Rockwell-Collins, a division of
Rockwell International.
</P>
<P>
   Rockwell Collins, which also builds navigational and cockpit
systems for commercial jets, said that it studied the market for a
year before it decided to take the plunge. The company has spent
the last year refining a video-on-demand system developed by Hughes
that it is now selling to British Airways and other airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Sony Trans Com, a division of Sony Corp., spent four years
developing its new video-on-demand offering. Last month, the first
test system began flying on a South African Airways 747.
</P>
<P>
   Matsushita Avionics, a division of Matsushita Electric
Industrial Co. of Japan, also has a new video-on-demand system
scheduled for delivery next year. Singapore Airlines is testing a
version of the system on one of its 747s.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at Rockwell Collins, Sony Trans Com and Matsushita
Avionics said that they had learned from their mistakes and that
the new systems would deliver all the bells and whistles first
promised five years ago, but with unrivaled reliability.
</P>
<P>
   Yet some of the assurances sound naive. Sony's new Passport
system, for example, depends on software from Microsoft Corp.,
including the Windows NT operating system and Internet Explorer.
Yet many users have criticized the software, saying personal
computers that run it frequently crash.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Evers, director of marketing at Sony Trans Com, denied any
problems. ``I don't know of any operating system in use today that
is more robust,'' he said, referring to Windows NT.
</P>
<P>
   Many carriers hope that they can offset the expense of the new
systems with revenue generated by online advertising, shopping and
gambling. But airlines that have experimented with such features,
including Singapore Air and Swissair, have been disappointed by the
results so far.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, when it comes to in-flight entertainment, the top
airlines find it difficult to resist the siren song of newer,
better, cooler.
</P>
<P>
   In June, Japan Airlines began offering first-class passengers on
its U.S.-Japan and Europe-Japan flights special eyeglasses fitted
with tiny video screens. The airline says that using the glasses,
which are made by Japan's Olympus Optical Co. and cost $500 a pair,
is like watching a 62-inch screen.
</P>
<P>
   But that is the case only when the system is working. &QL;

CHOOSING PROSE OVER POETRY TO SPAN A BAY  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 23.) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By HERBERT MUSCHAMP   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ When it comes to bridge designers practicing in
the world today, there's the Spanish architect and engineer
Santiago Calatrava and there's everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Isn't that awful? This fact has certainly lent an air of
independence, if not futility, to San Francisco's search for a new
design for the Bay Bridge. Why should Bay area residents settle for
genius and deprive themselves of the freedom to choose something
second rate?
</P>
<P>
   In June, the Metropolitan Transportation Commission approved a
new design for the bridge's eastern span, the 2.1-mile stretch from
Yerba Buena Island to Oakland. Heavily damaged in the 1989
earthquake, this segment was judged unlikely to withstand an even
stronger quake that seismologists predict will occur within the
next century.
</P>
<P>
   The Bay Area regards the new $1.3 billion bridge as its major
millennial project, a public work intended to carry the region into
the next century and proclaim its culturally progressive spirit.
Unfortunately, the winning design is not yet up that ambition.
</P>
<P>
   If I had $1.3 billion lying around, I'd hire Calatrava and put
him to work. But public involvement in public works is one of the
Bay Area's glories. In recent years, San Francisco has built a new
main public library, a new museum of art, a performing arts complex
and an innovative water treatment plant, among other major
projects, all of them objects of lively public debate.
</P>
<P>
   But none aroused as much passion as the new Bay Bridge has:
newspaper columns and editorials, letters to the editor, civic
group newsletters, weird unsolicited proposals, grassroots
campaigns to include provisions for bicycles and rail transit. All
this should be regarded as a form of civic bridge-building. It has
helped reinforce the connections between people and place that make
this such a great place to live.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, it's not San Francisco's fault that Calatrava
did not respond to the commission's open call for proposals. But it
is not too late to bump it up a few notches. This scheme represents
only 15 percent of the eastern span. Its longest stretch, the other
85 percent, is a causeway that descends into Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   The design for this major section of the bridge is still in
development. And with Jerry Brown returned to active politics as
Oakland's mayor, there is even greater incentive to urge the
commission to insist on an innovative design.
</P>
<P>
   The western span, which extends from Yerba Buena Island to San
Francisco, will be structurally reinforced but retain its current
appearance. Though this section may lack the travel-poster panache
of the Golden Gate, it is a vibrant expression of the engineer's
art.
</P>
<P>
   Its dull gray color is perfectly suited to a city often shrouded
in fog. The tall towers, accented with cross-bracing, recede single
file into mist, beckoning the eye to follow. It is industrial, even
martial poetry, a reminder of the area's proud heritage.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the old eastern span would make a fine runner-up in
an amateur match-stick contest. With its roadway partly enclosed in
a hulking structural framework, it can't seem to decide whether
it's a bridge or a tunnel. Not much poetry there.
</P>
<P>
   The winning design, by the firm T.Y. Lin International/ Moffatt
&AMP; Nicol Engineers of San Francisco, is a suspension bridge,
featuring a single, tapering tower of four trapezoidal steel
columns connected by transverse beams. The tower is asymmetrically
placed, with the long part of the span reaching across the water.
</P>
<P>
   In technical terms, the tower is ``self-anchored''; the road
deck serves as a compression member. One large cable is draped from
the tower's peak; slender suspender cables attach the main cable to
girders beneath the road deck. The effect is delicate, even lacy.
</P>
<P>
   Funds have been allocated for a bicycle lane, and there are
provisions for future inclusion of rail. Construction could begin
in two years, and take three years to complete.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   There were three runner-ups in the competition. The first,
another single-tower design, was a cable-stayed structure, with
fan-shaped planes of cables splayed out from a concrete tower to
the road-deck's edges. (The effect is similar to a bridge Calatrava
designed for Bordeaux in 1991, but this was a swing bridge, and the
revolving motion of its central section gave functional meaning to
the tower's spindlelike form.)
</P>
<P>
   The other runner-ups were twin-towered designs, with slim
portals framing each roadway. Imagine the Brooklyn Bridge after a
hunger strike and you've got the picture.
</P>
<P>
   The weakest element in both schemes, however, is a clunky
causeway descending into Oakland. In each case, it would come
clomping through the water on stiff concrete columns like an
elephant wading in the ocean. One version has flaring supports at
the tops of columns _ Dumbo with harlequin shades. Either causeway
would be exhilarating to drive along, but neither would enhance the
landscape. Few would fault the earth if it tried to shake them off.
</P>
<P>
   This century has seen the flowering of two master bridge
builders: Robert Maillart and Calatrava. Maillart, born in 1872,
was Swiss, and his sturdy designs of reinforced concrete have a
solidly Protestant appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Calatrava, born in Valencia in 1950, is said to spend two months
a year in a convent retreat, and his work is discernibly Catholic
in spirit. His plan for a Science Museum in Valencia has the
fundamental elements of a great Gothic cathedral: light, ribbed
construction; nave, narthex and spire. Like Louis Kahn, Calatrava
brings to design the devotion of prayer.
</P>
<P>
   He was trained as an engineer as well as an architect. This is
not to suggest a hierarchical relationship between the two fields.
If anything, Calatrava's engineering background has given him a far
deeper grasp of the poetics of structure than most architects can
claim.
</P>
<P>
   ``Building a bridge is, in my opinion, a symbolic gesture,'' he
has written, ``linked with the needs of the people crossing and the
surmounting of an obstacle. Thus, the history of bridges is very
important, with their origin in that single stepping stone to cross
a quietly running stream.''
</P>
<P>
   A city seeking a new civic symbol should look deeply into the
subject of symbolism itself. ``We project our soul onto a
landscape,'' the Jungian psychoanalyst Marie-Louise von Franz wrote
in her book, ``The Way of the Dream,'' written with Fraser Boa.
</P>
<P>
   The most poetic element in the winning design for the Bay Bridge
is that the central tower embodies the symbolic form Dr. von Franz
called the Ladder to Heaven. Her interpretation springs from
Jacob's dream of angels climbing up and down a stair from the sky
to the place where he slept. On awakening, Jacob realized this was
a holy place. Or, in von Franz's terms, the ladder is the place of
``communication with the upper deities.''
</P>
<P>
   It's no illusion that crossing a bridge can induce an exalted
state. It's a mythical archetype that comes most vividly to life on
days when hazy light obliterates the border between sea and sky,
suspending the traveler in a state of blurred distinctions.
</P>
<P>
   Santiago Calatrava himself recalls another Jungian symbol: the
star, the person able to attract and hold the projections of
others. Calatrava holds the hopes of those who know how
transcendent the beauty of engineering can be. But many people
resent the idea of architecture stars. They equate stardom with
monster egos. But in Jungian terms the reverse is true: stars serve
something larger than their selves.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, San Francisco shouldn't have such a hard time with the
idea that talent is not evenly distributed. Look at the city
itself.
</P>
<P>
   For most Americans, San Francisco is Top Burg, the most
perfectly realized urban setting on the North American continent.
Here, little cable cars climb halfway to the stars. The new bridge
should strive to lift the traveler even higher.

   SAN JOSE DEL GUAVIARE, Colombia _ As leftist rebels occupied
Albert Schweitzer Hospital in the city of Miraflores 11 days ago,
using it as a vantage point to attack a military base across the
street, explosions and gunfire rained over the corrugated-tin roof
of the hospital. A plane dropped bombs in the distance. Outside
teen-agers fell dead and wounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you like our party?'' a witness recalled a guerrilla as
having said.
</P>
<P>
   After taking the hospital the rebels searched the rooms for
soldiers and police officers, said doctors, nurses and other
hospital employees who had fled here to San Jose from Miraflores, a
short plane ride away. In occupying the hospital and routing the
soldiers and police, the rebels turned it into a target in the
battle as well as now, more than a week later.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was panic, terror, because of the continuous
explosions,'' said a nurse's assistant who insisted on anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The battle continued for 23 hours, with the doctors and nurses'
cleaning, stitching and bandaging the wounded throughout the
period. For some the memory of a battle three years ago in which
the hospital burned came crashing back.
</P>
<P>
   In the final days of Ernesto Samper's presidency, which ended
last week when Andres Pastrana was sworn as as his successor,
rebels launched attacks in 17 of the 32 states in the country,
killing an estimated 140 soldiers and police officers, as well as
scores of civilians.
</P>
<P>
   The most stunning attacks were at the police and military bases
in Miraflores, which is critical to U.S.-backed efforts to
eradicate coca. In a visit here this week Drug Enforcement
Administrator Thomas Constantine pledged U.S. aid to rebuild the
bases.
</P>
<P>
   For the coca growers in Guaviare state, the bases at Miraflores
and here at San Jose are symbols of a U.S. war on drugs that, they
say, is being fought on their backs. Guaviare produces 65 percent
of Colombian coca, or 250 tons of coca paste, from 60,000 acres,
the Colombian government said.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the August offensive, police and soldiers were at
odds with residents of Miraflores, a coca-growing enclave carved in
the jungle 275 miles southeast of Bogota. Soldiers did not venture
out alone after dark. In the middle of the night snipers sometimes
shot at the base.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital workers called Miraflores ``an attack foretold,''
saying that in fliers and statements the rebels had warned
civilians to keep a distance from government security
installations. But with an unusual meeting last month between
Pastrana and the leader of the largest rebel group, the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, residents had grown
optimistic about the prospects for peace and may have thought that
the attack had been called off.
</P>
<P>
   Instead it was fierce. Shooting continued from one evening into
the next day, with 40 soldiers and officers killed and 129 taken
prisoner. Eventually the hospital workers overcame their terror and
sent a delegation to give the rebels an ultimatum, to take the
fight outside or the workers would stop treating injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ''They agreed, but they didn't really understand,'' a hospital
administrator said. ``They still kept shooting from the grounds of
our compound.''
</P>
<P>
   When the shooting stopped, workers said, the rebels took wounded
soldiers and officers to the hospital, chiding them for putting up
a fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you'd have surrendered, none of this would have happened,''
the guerrillas told them.
</P>
<P>
   The reproach was taken as an apology. ``I think they felt a bit
of solidarity with the wounded,'' said one doctor.
</P>
<P>
   The danger for the 40 workers who fled here did not end when the
guns quieted. Now the workers grapple with an amorphous dread, so
choked by violence that they are not sure whom to fear. They
insisted on anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   After the attack the military has been using the hospital
freely, the workers said. At first soldiers arrived with weapons,
breaking a rule that requires arms be left outside. The soldiers
argued that the hospital's neutrality had been broken.
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers' use of the hospital made health workers fear
another guerrilla attack or sniper fire.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time the workers know that the military or the
police could fault them because the rebels had chosen the hospital
building to stage their attack. The insurgents also occupied the
school at Miraflores in the battle. All the teachers resigned and
have been trying to reach San Jose for safety.
</P>
<P>
   ''In Guaviare we're living under three forces, the guerrilla,
the paramilitary and the state,'' said the local Roman Catholic
parish priest, the Rev. Jorge Vargas. Colombians, Vargas said, are
caught in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   The whole region and all the military bases in the country are
at a state of maximum alert, and there are rumors that another
attack on military installations may be coming. In Miraflores
shopkeepers pull down the shutters at 5 p.m. for the curfew that
begins at 6, and everybody entering and leaving the town goes
through government checkpoints.
</P>
<P>
   With the bases destroyed and guerrillas having seized guns,
ammunition, grenades, night-vision equipment and other supplies,
soldiers are stationed in foxholes covered by plastic sheets. Asked
what the soldiers were protecting, a health-care worker said
``themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The worst part, the refugees say, is maneuvering survival in a
war whose combatants are often quick-change artists, looking like a
neighbor by day and a killer by night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like it's calm, but beneath the surface, it's very
tense,'' said a hospital administrator.
</P>
<P>
   In the past military defeats have led to the paramilitary death
squads' executing suspected rebels. In the last year, people say,
paramilitary groups have infiltrated Guaviare, quietly killing an
estimated 100 people in piecemeal massacres called ``selective
deaths.'' The most recent was last week, but the families have
remained silent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here there is a law of silence,'' said Alejandro Ovalles, who
has quietly negotiated with the paramilitary groups to stop the
killing.
</P>
<P>
   Although Pastrana has pledged to open peace talks with the
rebels in an attempt to end the polarization, a senior military
commander in one of the most troubled areas said recently that
civilians who did not take sides were suspicious.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this war one cannot be neutral,'' the commander of the
First Division, Gen. Victor Alvarez Vargas, told El Tiempo, the
daily in Bogota, in a lengthy interview. He called Colombians who
tried to remain neutral ``either useful idiots or willing
sympathizers of the interests of subversive groups.''
</P>
<P>
   Alvarez's area covers the states of Bolivar, Cesar, Choco,
Cordoba, Magdalena and Sucre, as well as the Uraba area, where the
strength of right-wing paramilitary groups has soared. Human rights
groups say masked paramilitary death squads who appear carrying
lists of suspected guerrillas marked for execution are believed to
be responsible for 70 percent of the thousands of political
killings each year in the country, according to human rights
groups.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ If being cool translates as feigning indifference,
then Keith Nobbs _ a 19-year-old actor in ``Stupid Kids'' _ is
decidedly uncool. This live wire (``I have the metabolism of a
shrew,'' he volunteers cheerfully) is suddenly hot, in a satire
that examines the vagaries of coolness in the conformist atmosphere
of a suburban high school in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Written by John C. Russell, who died of AIDS in 1994 at the age
of 31, ``Stupid Kids'' opened off-Broadway in June to a shaky start
at the WPA Theater, where it received several mixed reviews, with
some critics complaining of a thin story. Still, the 80-minute
play, directed by Michael Mayer, seemed to be finding its legs just
as it closed in July. Now it has been given another chance.
</P>
<P>
   It begins a commercial run Tuesday at the Century Theater on
East 15th Street with a gilt-edged pack of producers behind it.
Shubert Organization chairman Gerald Schoenfeld is a fan, as are
the other producers: Scott Rudin, Roger Berlind, Robert Fox and ABC
Television. ``I saw it and found it very appealing,'' Schoenfeld
said. ``It's fresh, it's young. It's just the type of thing to
bring young people back to the theater.''
</P>
<P>
   Between bites of a cheeseburger at an East Village diner
recently, Nobbs talked about the reasons he thinks ``Stupid Kids''
has appeal. ``It's basically `Rebel Without a Cause' meets an '80s
teen movie, with the outcast as hero,'' he said. ``And I get to
wear lime-green Converse sneakers, which is excellent.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Stupid Kids,'' with its cast of four, tells the story of two
boys and two girls at a fictional high school on Long Island.
Nobbs' gay character, Neechee (as in Nietzsche: a knowing nod to
the outsider Plato in ``Rebel Without a Cause''), harbors an
intense crush on Jim, the big-man-on-campus (played by James
Carpinello). Neechee's counterpart, Kimberly (Mandy Siegfried), is
equally obsessed with Jim's girlfriend, Judy (Shannon Burkett).
Does this foursome manage to unscramble its collective libido?
Hardly.
</P>
<P>
   The performance by Nobbs has been singled out for praise.
Michael Feingold in The Village Voice said the actor worked ``with
a conviction and clarity that normally come only with decades of
experience,'' and Fintan O'Toole in The New York Daily News said
Nobbs was ``particularly good as the dreamy, awkward Neechee,
capturing perfectly the hurt and bluster of a fragile
personality.''
</P>
<P>
   Mention of Nobbs' reviews elicits a teasing, ``Aw, you make me
blush like a schoolgirl,'' a camp comment in keeping with the tone
of ``Stupid Kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobbs grew up in Kingwood, Texas, a suburb north of Houston, the
youngest of four children, and went to a school that prepared him
well for the outcast character he plays on stage. ``The kids were
like robots _ same hair, same jeans,'' he said. ``Ten minority
students out of 4,000. Nazi-land.''
</P>
<P>
   When he was 15, his family moved to Kew Gardens, Queens, and he
went to the High School of Performing Arts, from which he
graduated, winning the American Theater Wing's Isabelle Stevenson
Award. ``It's a totally different world,'' the actor said.
``There's so much mutual respect because everyone is working on his
art. I went from guys in Texas threatening to go gay-bashing to two
guys getting engaged at my senior prom.''
</P>
<P>
   Head constantly bobbing, hands thrashing the air in karate
chops, Nobbs peppers his speech with affirmations like ``groovy''
and ``bonus.'' But he has an introspective side. From his
first-year classes at the School of General Studies at Columbia
University, he said, he distilled an esthetic philosophy that he is
applying to his acting career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like art with no fingerprints,'' he said. ``Like
Michelangelo, who let David emerge from the stone, whereas
Bernini's David is imposed with all sorts of the artist's ego.
Imposing ego is bad acting _ the neurosis of, `How am I being
perceived?'''
</P>
<P>
   On the strength of his performance in ``Stupid Kids,'' he has
been sought out for auditions. But because he is such a new kid on
the block, Nobbs said, producers often ``don't know what I'm right
for, so they put me in a room and have me tell stories'' _ as
director Joe Mantello did recently when auditioning actors for
Terrence McNally's controversial new play ``Corpus Christi.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayer, who is also directing the current ``A View From the
Bridge'' and ``Side Man,'' has already cast Nobbs in the Roundabout
Theater Company's revival of ``The Lion in Winter,'' which will
begin performances in February with Laurence Fishburne in the lead
role. Mayer said of Nobbs that the author of ``The Lion in
Winter,'' James Goldman, ``his wife, the Roundabout's casting
director and I all thought, `He's the one,' independent of one
another _ and that never happens.''
</P>
<P>
   The East Village lunch was wedged between shooting an episode of
HBO's new hourlong drama ``The Sopranos'' and a callback for a
film. Is this an actor worried about running out of gas? ``Nah,''
he said, ``I just eat my breakfast of champions _ a bottle of Coke
and Reese's Peanut Butter Cups.'' Cool.

WHEN PHRASES THAT FLATTER ARE MISUSED  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 23.) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I hope there's some distinction to looking like the biggest fool
in the world of film. Because I had that honor in a recent
advertisement for the videotape of ``John Grisham's `The
Rainmaker,''' one that quoted me as describing ``The Rainmaker'' as
Francis Ford Coppola's ``best and sharpest film.''
</P>
<P>
   Now you, I, Coppola, Paramount Pictures and the man in the moon
all know this is untrue (a certain multipart masterpiece comes to
mind), but I had accidentally made the studio's advertising
department an offer it couldn't refuse. What I had written months
before in my review of the movie was, `` `John Grisham's ``The
Rainmaker''' is Coppola's best and sharpest film  &UR; in years &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   Fair game. It's cricket today, with print-media movie ads at
their most ruthless and breathless, to find phrases yanked from
reviews out of context, words picked out of separate paragraphs and
strung together, exclamation points sprinkled like confetti. There
are even gasps of admiration specially solicited to suit
advertising needs.
</P>
<P>
   As The Wall Street Journal pointed out recently in a scarifying
piece on the marketing of ``Armageddon,'' Disney so fancied the
image of an asteroid hurtling through a vowel that it simply
searched for a critic willing to say ``Wow!'' A friend of mine
points out that ``Lousy!'' would have done the job _ and a little
more accurately, too.
</P>
<P>
   We all learn the hard way that a flattering phrase tossed off
casually can become an advertisement nightmare somewhere down the
line. ``Can we watch this?'' my little sons asked a while ago,
waving an evil-looking video in my direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nope,'' I said, without even looking closer. ``Are you
 &UR; suuuurrre &LR;  you don't like it?'' they asked gleefully, and then
they turned over the box. There on the back was my name, attached
to the words ``It's fun!''
</P>
<P>
   Hasty research on this no-account horror film established that
what I had actually written in my review was a wee bit different.
</P>
<P>
   For better and worse, critics find themselves integral to the
process of promoting movies, and there are times when we gratefully
seize that opportunity. Consider ``Western,'' a beguiling, offbeat
French film that I adore.
</P>
<P>
   Currently hanging on semi-desperately at a single Manhattan
theater, this little treat has no easy selling points of its own.
The director, Manuel Poirier, is a Peruvian raised in France. And
like the film's two funny, sheepish stars, he is quite unknown here
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The title (``Western'' is set in western France) is useless to
the point of being a deterrent: cowboy fans may not be in the
market for a tender French road movie with an ending that prompts
tears of happiness, and moviegoers who gravitate toward foreign
films are perhaps scared away by the thought of cattle drives. So
in a case like this, an extra chance to be heard is all too
welcome. It's a privilege to help a struggling favorite by being
quoted with some version of ``Go!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Western,'' Hal Hartley's ``Henry Fool'' and the reissue of
Fellini's ``Nights of Cabiria'' offered the most transcendent
non-battlefield filmgoing experiences I've had this summer. (``The
Opposite of Sex'' and ``There's Something About Mary'' delivered
the dizziest laughs.)
</P>
<P>
   Yet those first three films, collectively, have grossed not even
$2 million in the United States (as compared with about $70 million
each for ``Six Days, Seven Nights'' and ``Lost in Space''). For all
practical purposes, at a time when audiences surely long for films
worth caring about, those three films have barely been seen.
</P>
<P>
   What better opportunity could there be to be involved in a
little drumbeating for a good reason? Trouble is, critics can't
save their credibility for the movies that matter.
</P>
<P>
   With the mania for rhapsodic quotes in ads at such a feverish
pitch, crying wolf is a serious occupational hazard, one to make us
wince at appearing to endorse films we think are negligible. Look
closely and you'll sometimes see the equivalent of ``The lights
went down! I watched it!'' being trumpeted to the skies.
</P>
<P>
   It's a good thing readers are the savviest participants in the
quote-ad sweepstakes. Surely you know the rules of this game. If
you can't make out the source of the quote without a magnifying
glass, chances are that it isn't your eyesight that's the problem.
And you know better than to trust ... any statement ... full of
holes ... like this. Beware of any form of quote-ad rapture that
originates too far before the film has opened, perhaps even before
it has been made.
</P>
<P>
   And know that certain buzzwords are a dead giveaway to so-so
sentiment. ``Compelling,'' ``worthy'' or ``engrossing'' are not the
language of a writer in love.
</P>
<P>
   If the laudatory words have come to sound awfully familiar,
that's because the quote-ad vocabulary is notoriously tiny and
tired. Even when a film does make the pulse quicken, must it really
be as brilliant, heart-stopping, bold and audacious a thrill ride
as all that?
</P>
<P>
   Phrases get flogged, borrowed and recycled until even the
simplest and mightiest of accolades (``Great!'') is reduced to
hype. I promise never to call anything ``wickedly funny'' again.
Even if it is.
</P>
<P>
   But there are certain forms of critical shorthand that
encapsulate an opinion quickly, even if they do it in
all-too-quotable form. ``Just saw `The Horse Whisperer' and found
it to be `voluptuously soapy,' '' my best friend from high school
wrote in a letter last month. ``You are definitely the master of
the adverb and adjective combo.''
</P>
<P>
   She was an English major, and she naturally takes a wry (another
word suffering critical injuries) view of this process. She also
knows this: Quotations should come from the sages who wrote ``The
quality of mercy is not strained'' or ``Do not go gentle into that
good night.'' Not from the writer who cried ``Wow!''

WELL-WISHERS WELCOME CLINTONS TO CAPE COD ISLAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ELLEN O'BRIEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDGARTOWN, Mass. _ One day after President Clinton confessed to
the nation, he found forgiveness on Martha's Vineyard, where he was
greeted by a few hundred well-wishers who turned out to greet the
First Family.
</P>
<P>
   It was, by all accounts, business as usual. And in some ways,
that was the biggest surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Washington insider and summer resident of Martha's Vineyard
Vernon E. Jordan Jr., who has been caught up in the controversy
over Monica S. Lewinsky, has been noticeably absent from Clinton's
side in recent months. But Tuesday, as he has in three summers
past, Jordan wore a golfing cap and was the first to greet the
Clintons as they got off the plane.
</P>
<P>
   While controversy continued swirling back in Washington, with
talk of impeachment, and polls across the country showing a drop in
Clinton's credibility ratings, the airport welcome was a clear
signal that many people here are hoping he can enjoy a pleasant
stay on the island.
</P>
<P>
   The plane touched down just after 5 p.m., and the Clintons and
daughter Chelsea emerged waving and smiling, though the president
was wearing a business suit. In years past, the president has
arrived in casual clothing, looking far more relaxed.
</P>
<P>
   As he does every time he arrives on this island, Clinton
lingered with the crowd assembled at the airport.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Casselli and his wife Dawn of Stratford, Conn., have
vacationed the last four years with the Clintons in Martha's
Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   Caselli was one of the first Americans to have the opportunity
to give the president a piece of his mind Tuesday, as he shook
hands and spoke with Clinton for several minutes at the Martha's
Vineyard Regional Airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him that what he said last night was a great apology,''
said Caselli, 64. ``I said, let's forget about all that stuff,''
Caselli went on as Clinton stood and listened. Caselli was
overheard telling the president that the economy was good, and that
just about everyone he knew could afford a new home.
</P>
<P>
   The crowds had been growing smaller each summer as the First
Family's presence has become more of a routine. Tuesday's crowd,
which began lining up two hours in advance for the president's
arrival was about the same in size as last year's of about 200,
many of them making the trip for the fourth time.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those dressed in red white and blue and carrying banners
said that it was more important than ever to greet Clinton Tuesday,
at a time when his presidency is vulnerable, and his family is
gathered after a legendary week of intense public scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really relieved to see the crowds. I came here and sweated
in line, to make sure that he knew he still had friends on the
island.'' said Barbara Courtney, whose husband Geno owns several
island shops and is renowned for his tacky T-shirts, designed for
the annual presidential vacation.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, though, has weightier issues on her mind. She said
that she brought along her daughter Lauren and this year the two
had to talk about extramarital affairs and sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``A month ago, she said to me with all the wisdom of a 12
year-old, `I think that that's between the president and Mrs.
Clinton, isn't it?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Chelsea Clinton greeted fans first, and as usual, teenagers were
thrilled to see her and gushed over her stylish clothing. She was
met by a couple of boys her age, who White House aides say are also
vacationing here.
</P>
<P>
   In summers past, the Clintons have made several public outings
during their vacations, with the president scheduling early golf
games and Mrs. Clinton and Chelsea enjoying afternoon shopping
trips. Tuesday, White House aides issued what the press corps
called ``the vacation Bible,'' a daily schedule of events. On each
page it was printed ``there are no public events on the schedule of
the president.'' indicating that, so far, the Clintons plan to keep
to themselves.
</P>
<P>
   However, several sources familiar with the presidential vacation
calendar say he is likely to schedule short departures from the
island during his stay. There will be a morning press briefing at
the Edgartown Elementary School, which will again serve as the
island press center.
</P>
<P>
   Richard L. Friedman, a Cambridge, Mass. businessman and real
estate developer, is once again the presidential host, and the
first family will stay in the main house on his Oyster Pond estate.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman, his wife, Nancy Klemm Friedman, and his son Alex were
also among those who greeted Clinton as he stepped from the plane.
Singer-songwriter Carly Simon, though recently diagnosed with
breast cancer, stood beside them and offered the Clintons hearty
hugs.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the smaller guest house on the property has been
filled with exercise equipment for the Clintons, according to those
who have visited the property recently. The Freidmans will stay in
another home on the prperty, and the antique farmhouse, already
filled with gifts from island residents, is where the Clintons will
stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most challenging issue for (Clinton) is going to be
Jenny,'' said Friedman, jokingly referring to the Norwegian
elkhound dog whose feisty personality is known to Oyster Pond
residents. The family brought along their own dog, Buddy a
chocolate Labrador.
</P>
<P>
   Islanders sent baskets of sunflowers and a painting of the
Oyster Pond property, which has become the summer White House.
</P>
<P>
   Though many residents and summer visitors relax on this island,
few experience the solitude that the Clintons can on the property
that sits at the end of a long and winding sandy road that
stretches uphill to Friedman's farm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know they will be able to relax'' Friedman said. ``That's
all that matters.''

RETHINKING A MOSTLY MOZARTEAN STRAVINSKY  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 23) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stravinsky was a slow worker. He produced, on average, one major
composition, or an equivalent number of smaller ones, per year. Of
course, he lived many years, from 1882 to 1971, and produced many
works, about 100, though only a handful run longer than a
half-hour. The longest by far is his only full-length opera, ``The
Rake's Progress.'' Each of its three acts took a year to compose.
</P>
<P>
   So by the time of the opera's premiere, in 1951 in Venice, with
a luminous cast including Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, Robert Rounsville
and Jennie Tourel, the musical world was immensely curious. The
most important living composer had essentially been silent for some
time. What had he been up to?
</P>
<P>
   Many cutting-edge modernists who attended, or heard reports,
were baffled. For 20 years, Stravinsky had been immersed in
Neo-Classicism, his breathtakingly brilliant effort to reanimate
classical genres and forms through reinvented tonal procedures and
complex shifting meters.
</P>
<P>
   To the modernists, ``The Rake's Progress'' seemed not just
Neo-Classical but a virtual pastiche of Mozartean opera. Stravinsky
admitted to having studied Mozart's operas closely as models and
declared himself ``Mozart's continuer.'' But the hostile reactions
of many composers and critics rattled him, and may have helped
provoke him to give up Neo-Classicism and investigate 12-tone
techniques.
</P>
<P>
   The true significance of ``The Rake's Progress'' has since
become clearer. The opera has had numerous prominent productions,
and last season, the Metropolitan Opera unveiled a new one,
directed by Jonathan Miller and conducted by James Levine. ``The
Rake's Progress'' now seems a work of incomparable genius, and the
release of two new recordings reinforces this assessment.
</P>
<P>
   On one, Seiji Ozawa conducts the Saito Kinen Festival Orchestra
and Chorus from Japan (Philips 454 431-2; two CD's); on the other,
Kent Nagano leads the Lyons Opera of France (Erato 0630-12715-2;
two CDs).
</P>
<P>
   What's more, these recordings affirm the opera's place within
the international repertory of the 20th century. This outcome is
all the more striking, since the piece is pervaded by a British
quality. Stravinsky was inspired to compose it when, in 1947, at an
exhibit in Chicago, he saw Hogarth's ``Rake's Progress,'' a series
of eight engravings depicting the ruination of a young English
gentleman.
</P>
<P>
   Here, at a stroke, the composer got the idea for an opera, a
title and the gist of a story: a loutish gentleman comes into an
inheritance, wastes his money on gambling, foolish luxury and
prostitutes, and winds up in a madhouse, where he is faithfully
visited by the forgiving woman to whom he was once betrothed.
</P>
<P>
   The libretto, by W.H. Auden and Chester Kallman, evokes with
fondness but also satire the ornate poetic style of Pope and
Congreve. So Stravinsky felt that he was writing a thoroughly
English opera, and he hoped for a premiere production in a small
New York theater, like that of Gian Carlo Menotti's ``Consul'' in
1950. But it failed to materialize.
</P>
<P>
   Important recordings of the past, including the two conducted by
Stravinsky, have used mostly English and American singers,
orchestras and choruses. And even the new recordings use native
English-speaking singers in the leading roles.
</P>
<P>
   Stravinsky's first recording, for Columbia, used the cast that
gave the work's Met premiere in 1953 and has long been out of
print. Stravinsky's 1964 recording, made in London for Columbia,
offered Alexander Young as Tom Rakewell, Judith Raskin as Anne
Trulove and John Reardon as Nick Shadow, with the Royal
Philharmonic Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   Still available on Sony Classical, it remains indispensable. The
performance is not flawless. Details in the orchestra are sometimes
unclear; Stravinsky sometimes fails to highlight arresting inner
lines and harmonies. Yet the conception has an organic quality, the
tempos work perfectly, and the cast sounds inspired.
</P>
<P>
   Other recordings also drew primarily on English or American
forces. Riccardo Chailly conducted the London Sinfonietta with the
English tenor Philip Langridge in the title role in a Decca/London
release from 1983, not now available in the United States. And
Robert Craft, whose professional association with the composer
began on March 31, 1948, the very day the libretto of ``The Rake's
Progress'' was delivered into Stravinsky's hands, and lasted until
his death, conducted the Orchestra of St. Luke's in an insightful
Musicmasters recording from 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Stravinsky might have been delighted to hear the Japanese and
French choristers in the new recordings working so diligently to
enunciate the English text. But the primary considerations in any
performance are musical, and here the opera, a marvelous creative
balancing act, presents a formidable challenge.
</P>
<P>
   On one level, ``The Rake's Progress'' is a sincere homage to the
18th-century ``number opera,'' in which the music unfolds in a
numbered series of arias, ensembles and choruses, connected with
recitatives; yet at the same time, Stravinsky pokes fun at the
number opera.
</P>
<P>
   The libretto is archly British and filled with florid poetic
language; yet Stravinsky sets the words with clipped rhythms and
fractured phrase lengths. Some cite this feature as an example of
his flawed skills at prosody, but it seems deliberate to me, and it
cajoles the poetry to sound surprising and modern.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The main characters in the tale are little more than emblematic:
Tom, a lazy Englishman of no means and less discipline; his
betrothed, Anne, the guileless, good-hearted daughter of a widower
from the country; and the Devil, in the guise of Nick Shadow, who
tempts Tom with wealth into a life of debauchery and ruin. They
might be stock players in a morality play.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Stravinsky's precise, lucid, emotionally restrained music
endows them with complexity and humanity. And the harmonic
language, while essentially rooted in diatonic keys, amounts to a
textbook in how to discombobulate and burst the tonal system.
</P>
<P>
   Ozawa has had a variable relationship with the Boston Symphony,
which he has directed for a quarter-century. But in the Philips
recording, the Saito Kinen players, from the festival named for
Ozawa's beloved teacher, are clearly enthralled. You can hear the
respect of these immensely talented younger musicians for Ozawa in
the involvement and precision of their playing.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Ozawa is scrupulously attentive to Stravinsky's
metronome markings and displays a keen ear for textures and inner
voices. He captures the dancelike quality of the accompanimental
figurations and negotiates the music's shifting meters and
asymmetrical phrases with ease. And the cool restraint he brings to
the score allows the music to seem at once beguilingly
Neo-Classical and startlingly modern.
</P>
<P>
   This is one of Ozawa's finest recordings, and it suggests that
he should be doing more Stravinsky and contemporary music in
general instead of overblown performances of Mahler and Brahms.
</P>
<P>
   His cast is headed by Anthony Rolfe Johnson, a distinguished
English tenor. Though captured here past his vocal prime, Rolfe
Johnson provides a quality of oratorical elegance, complete with
proper ornamentation, and projects the fragility in Tom's
character.
</P>
<P>
   The soprano Sylvia McNair, as Anne, sings with honeyed tone and
exquisite delicacy. The shamefully underappreciated bass Paul
Plishka brings his husky voice and vivid dramatic flair to the role
of Shadow. Jane Bunnell, as Mother Goose, and Jane Henschel, as
Baba the Turk, are solid. And the English tenor Ian Bostridge
transforms the small role of Sellem, the auctioneer, into an
intriguing portrait of a seductively slippery operator.
</P>
<P>
   Nagano, conducting the Lyons Opera Orchestra in the Erato
recording, delivers a clear-textured, tellingly paced performance.
He does not elicit as much detail and rhythmic precision from his
players as Ozawa does from his, but this is a fine account of a
difficult score.
</P>
<P>
   The singers in the three main roles will be familiar to those
who attended the recent Met performances. Dawn Upshaw is a deeply
affecting Anne, singing with her customary creamy soprano tone,
supple phrasing, unmannered diction and poignant vulnerability. The
bass Samuel Ramey is a superlative Shadow, bringing even greater
depth and vocal presence to the role than he did in the Chailly
recording.
</P>
<P>
   The performance that may divide listeners is Jerry Hadley's, as
Tom. Hadley, a gifted American tenor, has said that he feels closer
to this role than to almost any other he sings, and you feel that
engagement in his ardent performance. He has thought about every
phrase, every word, and he sings with bright sound, vital rhythm
and crisp diction.
</P>
<P>
   But his involvement may be too deep, for in bursts of sound that
occasionally blare, you sense him trying too hard. The renowned
mezzo-soprano Grace Bumbry, recorded here at 58, makes an earthy
Baba, and Anne Collins is a winning Mother Goose.
</P>
<P>
   Ozawa's Japanese chorus, on Philips, does surprisingly well by
the English text. If anything, its enunciation is slightly clearer
than that of its French counterparts, on Erato. But even the
English and American choristers on the earlier recordings had
trouble with lines like ``Many a duchess divested of gems/Has
crossed the dread Styx by way of the Thames.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Rake's Progress'' has clearly arrived as a masterpiece of
the international repertory, and collectors have two fine new
recordings to chose from. Yet if I could have only one of all the
available versions, it would still be Stravinsky's excellent
account from 1964, informed by a sense of history in the making.

DOROTHY WEST, AT 91; ONE OF LAST HARLEM RENAISSANCE AUTHORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TOM LONG  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dorothy West of Oak Bluffs, Mass., an author who was one of the
last living figures of the Harlem Renaissance movement, died Sunday
in New England Medical Center in Boston. She was 91.
</P>
<P>
   Miss West was born in Boston in 1907. She was the daughter of an
emancipated slave.
</P>
<P>
   Her first novel, ``The Living Is Easy,'' about the black middle
class in Boston, was published in 1948. Her second novel, ``The
Wedding,'' about the black aristocracy on Martha's Vineyard, was
published in 1995. ``The Wedding'' was adapted by Oprah Winfrey
into a TV miniseries broadcast earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Among her many fans was Hillary Rodham Clinton, who called her
``a national treasure'' at her 90th birthday party on Martha's
Vineyard last year, and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, who encouraged
her to write ``The Wedding.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1926, shortly after she graduated from Girls Latin School,
Miss West's short story ``The Typewriter'' tied for second prize in
a short story contest with Zora Neale Hurston.
</P>
<P>
   Hurston befriended Miss West and brought her to New York, where
she was befriended by the more established writers of the Harlem
Renaissance, including Richard Wright and Langston Hughes. Miss
West, the youngest of the group, was called ``The Kid.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't know it was the Harlem Renaissance, because we were
all young and all poor,'' Miss West told the Associated Press in
1995. ``We had no jobs to speak of, and we had rent parties'' to
raise rent money.
</P>
<P>
   She remained in New York for more than a decade, selling stories
to the New York Daily News and working as a welfare investigator,
then a relief worker during the Depression. She founded and edited
two black literary journals, ``Challenge'' and ``New Challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1930s, after the Depression had decimated Harlem's
economy and arts scene, she returned to Boston and settled down in
her family's summer cottage in Oak Bluffs on Martha's Vineyard.
Though she put a sign out in front of the little gray cottage that
read ``Please, no unannounced visitors,'' her house became a mecca
for fans.
</P>
<P>
   For more than 30 years, she wrote a weekly column for the
Vineyard Gazette. In the 1980s, her work caught the eye of
Doubleday editor and summer island resident Onassis, who became a
regular visitor to the cottage and eventually convinced her to
finish ``The Wedding,'' which she had begun to write in the 1960s
but dropped because she thought it would be misunderstood during
the heyday of the Black Panthers and other militant groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I liked about her is that she listened,'' Miss West said
of Onassis in a story published in the Globe on Oct. 11, 1995.
``I'd talk on about this or that, and she'd say, `Oh, you must
write that,' or `You must write this.' She was a listener. She was
a learner.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Wedding'' was published by Doubleday and dedicated to
Onassis. Shortly after, Miss West's short-story collection, ``The
Richer, The Poorer,'' was published.
</P>
<P>
   Some said Miss West's books were about race, but she said they
were about class. ``Color never mattered to me,'' she said in the
Globe article. ``Class is always more important than color.''
</P>
<P>
   A memorial service was planned for Saturday in Union Chapel in
Oak Bluffs.

<P>
   Clusters of uniformed men patrol on foot, clinging tightly to
their rifles, uncertain of their future as rebel forces threaten
the capital and President Laurence Kabila's hold on power. And
thousands of fresh recruits, still dressed in rags, mill about on
streets whose names still date from the last fallen dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to fight to save our nation from the Rwandans,'' said
Pierre Kunga, an 18-year-old who is one of the hordes of recent
recruits who haunt the streets at night but who have not been given
arms. ``This is no time to debate the flaws of our leaders. Our
country is about to be swallowed up.''
</P>
<P>
   Kabila has turned out thousands of volunteers in recent days for
what he says will be a ``long and popular war'' against a
Rwandan-backed rebellion. But these new ``fighters,'' many of them
teen-agers who have been trained with nothing more than rusty auto
mufflers to use as mock guns, are unlikely to be play a decisive
role.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders of the rebellion are trying to present an ethnically
diverse face to the country to avoid the hostility a Tutsi-led
regime would attract, but few Congolese say they would accept any
government that they believe is installed by Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the outcome of this conflict, the latest of many in a
country whose history has been full of uprisings, is likely to be
decided by more powerful neighbors. These countries have sharply
divergent interests, but one trait in common: during the rebellion
that brought Kabila to power, they grew used to playing kingmaker
in Africa's third largest country.
</P>
<P>
   When Kabila himself was swept to power at the head of an
alliance principally armed and manned by Rwanda, Uganda and Angola,
the United States seemed to applaud after a brief moment of
hesitation over the military overthrow of a longtime ally, Mobutu
Sese Seko. These were ``African solutions to African problems,''
according to a phrase that became fashionable in policy circles.
</P>
<P>
   As Kabila's star wanes, however, following a 15-month-long
presidency marked by erratic behavior, diplomatic blunders and
sinking popularity, it is those very same allies whose interests
are beginning to clash dangerously as the Rwandan-led effort to
overthrow Kabila gains pace.
</P>
<P>
   In launching the second rebellion in Congo in as many years on
Aug. 2, Rwanda quickly secured the allegiance of Kabila's biggest
army unit, the 10th Brigade, in the eastern city of Goma. Two days
later, rebel troops were being flown boldly to the opposite end of
the country, where they opened a front near Kinshasa in the west.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is unbelievable,'' gushed a Western diplomat, before the
evacuation last weekend of the U.S. Embassy here. ``They have
nearly achieved as much in seven days as the Kabila rebellion did
in seven months.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Rather than give up without a fight, as Mobutu did, what Kabila
has done in the last few days is to throw his energies into
rallying Angola and a number of other African countries behind the
idea that what Rwanda is doing is threatening stability on a grand
scale.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear whether Kabila's personal diplomacy comes too late
or will produce too little concrete support to save his own
government. Local businessmen and others with knowledge of military
supplies here say that Angola has been using its airplanes to ferry
troops for Kabila's army and has provided the government with a
battalion of so-called Katangese Gendarmes, longtime Congolese
exiles who have fought in Angola's army.
</P>
<P>
   What is becoming clear, however, is that there is a growing rift
within the continent separating countries like Rwanda and Uganda _
two of the United States' closest African friends _ from a series
of other countries, particularly in southern and central Africa,
like Angola and Zimbabwe, that resent their far-flung
interventionism.
</P>
<P>
   For now, say experts in African political affairs, Congo is the
theater of this tension, whose immediate effects are still mostly
unpredictable. What is to be feared, however, they say, is that the
rivalries and instability these tensions create will eventually be
played out on a far larger stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is happening now could lead to the breakup of the
Congo,'' said one senior Central African diplomat who spoke on
condition of anonymity. ``It could lead to a new explosion of the
civil war in Angola. It could backfire on Rwanda, exacting a
terrible price from a country that is ruled by a small minority.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the first scenario the diplomat cited, if Kabila's forces
are unable to hold the capital, they may simply decide to retreat
to Lubumbashi, the president's ethnic fief in southern Congo. That
would effectively turn Lubumbashi, a mining center and the
country's second largest city, into a de facto rival capital of
Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
   What is worse, these analysts say, however well masked by
hastily cobbled together coalitions, the imposition of a new
government in Kinshasa by a foreign power like Rwanda, which is
deeply despised by the population of much of this country, is
unlikely to produce stability.
</P>
<P>
   Although Angola, which has the region's largest army, has yet to
show its hand completely in the current crisis, African diplomats
say that country's primary interest here is in having a stable
government, and hopefully one that can secure the long common
border.
</P>
<P>
   This interest has begun to drive Angolan diplomacy in a separate
direction from Rwanda's.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, the bitter Angolan opposition movement known as
Unita, which was allied with Mobutu, would like to see a weak
regime in Congo, or at least one too disorganized to prevent
Unita's soldiers and diamond traffickers from using Congolese
territory for rear bases.
</P>
<P>
   The new rebel coalition that is fighting Kabila has had close
contacts with people who were dignitaries in Mobutu's regime,
making many suspect that their friends in Unita stand ready to
assist the rebellion against Kabila.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there is tiny, but powerful, Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the rebellion succeeds in toppling Kabila or not, many
here say that over the long term, Rwanda's interventions in Congo
politics are likely to come back and haunt it.
</P>
<P>
   Already, in Kabila's desperate efforts to save himself, his
government has openly made common cause with anti-Tutsi guerrilla
groups that have been attacking both Rwanda and Burundi for years
from Congolese soil.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rwanda has decided to make life difficult for us, and we have
understood that the only way for Congo to have peace is to make
trouble for Rwanda,'' said Jean-Baptiste Sondji, one of Kabila's
health minister, in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say the enemies of your enemy become your friends, well
we are going to work with the Hutu to end minority power in Rwanda
once and for all. We cannot let the massacres start up again, but
Congo must come to dominate Rwanda and not vice versa.''
</P>
<P>
   His bitter vow may not come true anytime soon, but for anyone
who has experienced the shrill hatred of Rwanda in this country
since the latest rebellion, it is not hard to imagine that a grudge
against that country will be held for many years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This war is a repeat of an already failed attempt to settle
the future of Congo by force,'' said one senior African diplomat.
``Instead, it has set people and whole regions against each other.
What we have now are nations and whole communities that are
learning to hate each other. The only hope for putting an end to
that is through talking.''

O'BRIENS SEEK DISBARMENT OF DA WHO LED PROSECUTION OF SON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ELLEMENT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The parents of Edward S. O'Brien Tuesday asked the
Board of Bar Overseers to begin the process of disbarring Middlesex
District Attorney Thomas F. Reilly for the way he oversaw the
murder conviction of their son for the killing of his Somerville
neighbor, Janet Downing.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly dismissed the move as a desperate attack by two
emotionally overwrought parents.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien's parents, Edward and Patricia O'Brien, Tuesday filed a
three-page complaint with the bar overseers, the board that
disciplines attorneys in Massachusetts. Should the board determine
that the O'Briens' complaint has merit, it would be passed on to
the Supreme Judicial Court.
</P>
<P>
   The O'Briens claim that Reilly violated numerous ethical
guidelines for prosecutors between July 23, 1995, when Downing's
body was found in her home on Boston Street, until Oct. 1, 1997,
when a Middlesex Superior Court jury convicted the teenager of
first-degree murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, we'd love to see him disbarred,'' the elder O'Brien
said of Reilly, in a telephone interview Tuesday. ``He's abused too
many people in his career -- all for political gain.''
</P>
<P>
   The O'Briens assert that Reilly violated ethical guidelines
calling for him to share evidence with the defense and avoid
pre-trial publicity.
</P>
<P>
   They also claim he violated ethical rules in his closing
argument, and, when a Somerville Juvenile Court judge ruled that
O'Brien should be tried as a juvenile, Reilly ``went shopping'' for
a tougher judge.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly is currently a candidate for the Democratic nomination
for attorney general. The elder O'Brien said he was not involved in
the political campaign, and was acting solely because he believed
it was in his son's best interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our son is serving life without parole,'' he said. ``I will do
anything, and I mean anything, to clear his name and get him home.
Both me and my wife will go to any extent to right this wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Reilly said in written statement Tuesday that the allegations by
the O'Briens are ``reckless and they are false.'' He added that
``we all know that the O'Briens are very emotional when it comes to
their son's case. And it's not unexpected that they would continue
to lash out at our office and me personally.''
</P>
<P>
   Reilly also said, ``It must be very painful for them, but Janet
Downing was brutally murdered by their son and her family has
suffered a great deal. ... Edward O'Brien received a fair trial and
was convicted on the evidence. Our job was to hold him responsible
for murdering Janet Downing and that is what we did.''
</P>
<P>
   Arnold Rosenfeld, bar counsel to the BBO, said Tuesday that his
office would not investigate the O'Briens' complaint about Reilly
until appeals courts rule on the case.
</P>
<P>
   If, however, the courts find that prosecutorial misconduct
occurred, then the BBO would likely become involved, he said.

 &HT;    Congressional censure offers lawmakers a middle ground on
Clinton
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Only if and when independent counsel Kenneth Starr
sends a report to Congress on the results of his investigation of
President Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky will
lawmakers have the means to determine the president's proper
punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Between the two most talked-about options _ the momentous step
of impeachment and doing nothing _ lies a novel political middle
ground.
</P>
<P>
   A resolution of censure, a well-established form of
congressional punishment of a lawmaker less severe than expulsion,
would be one way for Congress to express its distaste for Clinton's
actions. It would have no legal consequences, but would serve as a
``tangible sign of the dimunition of the president's political and
moral authority,'' said John Bolton, a former assistant Attorney
General in the Reagan and Bush administrations.
</P>
<P>
   The idea also drew support from Leon Panetta, Clinton's former
chief of staff, who told USA Today that a censure vote ``would be
to everyone's advantage'' because it would allow Clinton to remain
in office, Congress to express itself and healing to begin.
</P>
<P>
   The House has used the penalty to discipline members who have
been involved in inappropriate sexual relationships. In 1983, the
House censured Rep. Daniel Crane, R-Ill., for his affair with a
17-year-old female page and Rep. Gerry Studds, D-Mass., for his
sexual relationship with a 17-year-old male page.
</P>
<P>
   Crane lost his next bid for re-election. Studds served in the
House until 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Speaker Newt Gingrich, who as a junior Republican unsuccessfully
urged his two colleagues' expulsion in 1983, had his speakership
threatened by a potential vote of censure following his admission
in late 1996 that he violated House ethics rules.
</P>
<P>
   Republican rules bar members who have been censured from serving
as committee chairmen and by inference, in leadership positions. In
the end, the House voted to reprimand Gingrich, a lesser penalty.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with censuring the president, according to
congressional expert Thomas Mann and Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., is that
it is an empty gesture.
</P>
<P>
   Barr complained that some House members might opt for censure
because they ``don't have the backbone for impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of a fig leaf for those who don't want to do
anything,'' Barr said.
</P>
<P>
   Mann, a scholar at the Brookings Institution in Washington,
called censure a ``cop out'' that sounds like a middle ground, but
in fact would be an irresponsible exercise that, lacking any
evidence to impeach Clinton, would further weaken him.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you care about the well-being of the country you either
want to force the man out of office,'' Mann said, ``or allow him to
conduct the remaining years of his presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   The Constitution sets out impeachment as Congress's way to deal
with a wayward president. It says nothing about any other form of
discipline.
</P>
<P>
   One has to look back 164 years for any guidance. In 1834, the
Senate censured Andrew Jackson in a dispute over the Bank of the
United States. The House refused to go along with the Senate and
Jackson ignored the Senate vote.
</P>
<P>
   When Jackson's party recaptured the Senate in 1837, Jackson's
censure was expunged from Senate records.
</P>
<P>
   There also is scant historical background to advise Congress how
to proceed if it chooses censure.
</P>
<P>
   Bolton said it seemed most likely that a vote for censure might
follow from hearings by the House Judiciary Committee into Starr's
report.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, the punishment would reflect the committee's
belief that the evidence did not warrant impeachment, but demanded
some response from Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But Bolton said a resolution of censure would not have to come
from the Judiciary Committee or even originate in the House, as
would, for instance, articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The House and Senate can pass resolutions on anything,
including whether the moon is made of bleu cheese,'' he said.

 &HT;    Little Rock banking on public's fascination
 &HT;    By Anne Rochell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Even if the Monica Lewinsky scandal proves to be
President Clinton's undoing, officials in his home state of
Arkansas said Tuesday they will carry on with plans for his
presidential library.
</P>
<P>
   Little Rock, which beat out 40 other Arkansas cities and towns
vying to be the library site, is busy buying land along the
Arkansas River and preparing the way for construction.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always been a voice of opposition out there to the
project,'' said City Manager Cy Carney. ``But the City Council has
been unanimous in its support, and they are not making moves to do
anything but continue moving forward on the project. Our view is
this is eight years of American history that we can have here in
Little Rock.''
</P>
<P>
   Max Brantley, editor of the weekly Arkansas Times, said no one
has given any serious thought to the idea of not having a
presidential library in Little Rock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Presidential libraries have become a staple of the 20th
century,'' he said. ``And no president has been more fascinating
than Bill Clinton, except maybe Kennedy _ I didn't say `good' but
`fascinating' _ so it's hard to see why a Bill Clinton presidential
library wouldn't hold interest.''
</P>
<P>
   An impeachment or resignation could delay the project, however,
Brantley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if he is driven from the presidency, it certainly, in
the short run, will put a damper on the project, and will make the
fund-raisers' task more difficult. Clinton would have to go into
seclusion for a while before he hit the banquet circuit.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the 26 acres needed for the library have been purchased and
cleared, private donations will cover the $100 million needed for
construction and the establishment of an endowment. Fund-raising
efforts are under way, both in and out of the state.
</P>
<P>
   Many residents expressed opposition to the City Council's
initial announcement that it would issue more than $16 million in
bonds for the project, but a financing plan passed in March. A
lawsuit has been filed by a group that opposes taxes, but Carney
called it a ``nuisance suit'' that he expects to be thrown out of
court any day now.
</P>
<P>
   The city of Little Rock is banking heavily on the library to
attract visitors and give a boost to the local economy, so killing
the project could prove disastrous.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very important economic development project,''
Carney said. ``We project 300,000 visitors a year into the library,
so it's a key part of our redevelopment effort downtown.''
</P>
<P>
   For a presidential library to come into being, the municipality
chosen by the president must buy and clear the land for
construction. Private donations then pay for construction. Finally,
the National Archives has to approve the library and agree to staff
and run it.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton reportedly is shopping for a high-profiled architect to
design the library, banking on his Hollywood connections to land
one.
</P>
<P>
   There are 11 presidential libraries in the United States, all
opened in this century. The first federally designated library was
Franklin Delano Roosevelt's in Hyde Park, N.Y. The most recent
opened in 1997 in Texas for George Bush. Only Richard Nixon's
library is not supported by the National Archives.

 &HT;    Past headline-makers keep quiet on Clinton controversy
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When the details of a public figure's private life
become water cooler conversation, the topic of discussion often
ducks for cover _ for the moment and sometimes forever.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's admission Monday night of a relationship
with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky that ``was not
appropriate'' sent many reporters Tuesday in search of other public
figures who have been touched by private scandal.
</P>
<P>
   But even years after sordid private details circulated about
them, many of those once accustomed to the media circus now prefer
silence.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Republican Bob Packwood resigned from the U.S. Senate
amid accusations of sexual and ethical misconduct by women on his
staff. At the time, the Oregon legislator said, ``Am I sorry? Of
course _ if I did the things that they said I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Reached at his Washington office Tuesday, Packwood kept quiet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather not whine about the past,'' Packwood said. ``You're
generous to ask, but I'd rather not talk about it.''
</P>
<P>
   In one of the most salacious campaign scandals of the 1980s,
presidential hopeful Gary Hart dared journalists to follow him to
determine if he was involved in an extra-marital affair. He was
caught with mistress Donna Rice, who has since added the married
name Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not talking about any of that or the current situation
because it doesn't help with what I'm doing,'' said Hughes, now a
crusader against pornography on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Hart also refuses comparison of his situation with Clinton's,
despite nearly 30 media requests, his Denver law secretary said
Tuesday. In 1988, publicity about his affair capsized his
presidential campaign. He later called it a ``damn fool mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   On television in 1969, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) didn't
acknowledge driving his car into the Chappaquiddick River in an
accident that killed passenger Mary Jo Kopechne. ``The car that I
was driving went off a narrow bridge,'' Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   Just two months ago, Kennedy said, ``And I've indicated before,
you know, that I've accepted responsibility for it.''
</P>
<P>
   For many politicians, a straightforward apology, especially for
private lapses, is hard to deliver. Often, there's ``regret.'' But
to ``apologize'' is an art in politics. Some seized on that during
Clinton's address.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm surprised that he just didn't say, `I apologize,' or `I'm
sorry' to the American people,'' said Chris Cabbot, a student at
Pennsylvania's La Salle University. Some at the White House shared
his sentiment while others were content with his contrition.
</P>
<P>
   On TV, Clinton admitted a ``critical lapse in judgment and a
personal failure on my part for which I am solely and completely
responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That certainly sounded like an apology to me,'' said Ann
Lewis, White House communications director.

 &HT;    Talent in the national interest
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Kurylo
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Michael Favorov is a Russian doctor at the Centers for
Disease Control who helped discover a new strain of hepatitis.
</P>
<P>
   Yiannis Ventikos is a Greek scientist at Georgia Tech whose
research helps to save fish endangered by hydroelectric power
plants.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Cregan-O'Brien is a world-class Irish dancer who teaches
American children the traditional steps of her homeland.
</P>
<P>
   All came to Atlanta on a special immigrant visa available only
to the world's best and brightest in science, arts, education,
business or athletics. Known as the national interest waiver, it is
given to immigrants who can prove their skills and talents are so
unique that America would substantially benefit if they were here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It worked for me and I would say this is a great thing for the
United States, too,'' said Ventikos, 33, who has a doctorate in
fluid mechanics. His national interest waiver application was
approved last year and he became a U.S. permanent resident this
year.
</P>
<P>
   There are several paths to U.S. permanent residency, which can
lead to citizenship. The majority of immigrants are allowed to
enter because a family member is a U.S. citizen. Others are
sponsored by employers who have to prove the immigrants are not
taking jobs from Americans. That process, coordinated by the U.S.
Labor Department, is called labor certification.
</P>
<P>
   But skilled professionals who can prove their work is in the
national interest of the United States can get on the fast track
and bypass labor certification, which can take 18 months or more.
By contrast, national interest waivers can be approved in several
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not taking jobs from American workers,'' said Carolyn
Soloway, an Atlanta immigration lawyer whose firm has helped
hundreds of immigrants get national interest waivers. ``They are
granted the visa because they have something so unique and so
unusual to contribute that you can't just stick an ad in the
newspaper and find someone that can do the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of those who get national interest waivers are doctors,
scientists and researchers who work at the Centers for Disease
Control and research universities such as Georgia Tech, Emory and
the University of Georgia. The national interest waiver is also
open to artists and others who make cultural contributions.
Cregan-O'Brien, 24, qualified because she was able to prove that
she could make cultural and educational contributions through Irish
many lines step dancing. A competitive dancer for 20 years, she
also is qualified to teach. She arrived in Atlanta in July and has
started teaching students through the non-profit Irish Dancers of
Atlanta. Before she arrived, the school had been flying in Irish
dance teachers from Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``There aren't qualified teachers coming out of the woodwork,''
said Jack O'Neill, president of Irish Dancers of Atlanta. The
group, founded last year, includes about 60 families with 80
children. Most are of Irish extraction and their goal is to learn
Irish dancing and celebrate their heritage.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill advertised for an Irish dance teacher in the United
States but found no one who was willing to move to Atlanta. ``To
get the quality of teacher we wanted, we needed to go to Ireland,''
he said, adding that children who want to compete have to be taught
by certified instructors.
</P>
<P>
   Cregan-O'Brien's attorney, Benjamin Landey, was able to prove
that her talent would benefit America culturally and educationally.
She applied for a national interest waiver last November and was
approved in March.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an art form that's taken very seriously throughout the
world,'' said Landey. ``Among people of Irish descent, it strongly
assists them in maintaining their cultural roots. There aren't that
many qualified teachers around who can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Landey discovered that an eclectic array of immigrants had
gotten national interest waivers because of their cultural
contributions, including a Russian ballroom dancer, a folk dancer
from Mexico, a Filipino painter, a classical musician from India
and a Chinese composer. So he agreed to help Cregan-O'Brien get
one, too.
</P>
<P>
   Applicants must document their unique talents, educational
background and extraordinary contributions to their field. They
must also provide up to a dozen letters from experts who can
explain how their work will benefit the United States.
Cregan-O'Brien had letters from Irish dance experts in Ireland and
the United States, and officials from the Georgia Council for the
Arts, Callanwolde Fine Arts Center and the Fulton County Arts
Council. She also was endorsed by Georgia Sen. Max Cleland and Rep.
Joseph P. Kennedy II of Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Soloway said her clients submit letters from international
institutes and organizations in the private and the public sector
that have the expertise to determine whether a person's
contribution would be in the national interest. Scientists and
doctors, for instance, might ask officials from the World Health
Organization or UNICEF to vouch for their work, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like to show the person has a very wide and international
reputation by getting letters from experts in the field from as
many different countries as we can,'' Soloway said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the effort, Landey said, ``Not too many people qualify
for this. It is hard to prove.''
</P>
<P>
   There are no clear rules on who is eligible for a national
interest waiver, immigration officials in Washington said. Neither
Congress, which wrote the law in 1990, nor the Immigration and
Naturalization Service, which has to write rules to apply it, have
defined national interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``There aren't really any firm guidelines out there,'' said
Edward Skerrett, chief of the INS administrative appeals unit in
Washington, D.C., which reviews applications that have been denied.
``When we wrote the regulations, we said it was up to the
petitioner to demonstrate that a waiver of the job labor
certification would be in the national interest.''
</P>
<P>
   The requirements are vague and subjective. Decisions are made by
officers at INS centers across the country. Denials can be appealed
to INS officers in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've consistently looked for some substantial benefit to the
United States,'' said John Grissom, an INS official in Washington.
``It is a bit difficult to quantify.'' Although the INS could
provide no exact figures, Grissom said ``very few'' national
interest waivers get approved on appeal. ``They approve a lot of
them in the field. They get all the petitions and we only get the
bad ones. That's why we don't approve many.'' He recalled a
petition by a man who claimed to be ``the world's greatest
whistler'' whose application still was not approved on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, Congress wrote the law to include artists and
others who make cultural and educational contributions, which is
why dancers and scientists have an equal shot at getting a national
interest waiver.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look for a guy who's got some kind of track record, who can
submit evidence that his future work would be in the national
interest,'' he said. ``We look for evidence that indicates they are
a cut above the rest.''

 By SYLVIA NASAR    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Tuesday's good news about the U.S. economy was the
refreshing absence of bad news: The Federal Reserve did not raise
interest rates at this morning's monetary policy meeting. Inflation
did not rise much in July. And the trade deficit did not widen
further in June, as economists had expected.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the lowest unemployment rate in a generation, consumer
prices edged up just 0.2 percent in July, the Commerce Department
reported. Prices are up just 1.7 percent from a year ago, an
extraordinary &QL; 
performance for the seventh year of an economic expansion. And
despite the robust dollar and deepening depression in Asia, the
U.S. trade deficit fell by more than $1 billion in June to $14.2
billion. In dollars, that's still close to a record high, but as a
share of the economy _ a more meaningful yardstick _ the trade
deficit is still just two thirds of its 1980s peak. Exports fell
but at a far slower rate than in recent months. Imports fell as
well, as businesses purchased less equipment from abroad and oil
prices dropped another notch.
</P>
<P>
   Against that backdrop, the Federal Reserve announced that it was
leaving its target for the overnight lending rate known as the
federal funds rate _ a benchmark for all interest rates _ at 5.5
percent and the discount rate, the rate the Fed charges banks for
emergency loans, at 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, the central bank offered no explanation of its
decision, but hardly any economists were predicting a change in
policy. With inflation tame, the economy slowing but not in
immediate danger of slipping into recession, and turmoil in Russia
and elsewhere, the Fed's best action was inaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fed has been very successful ... and blessed,'' said
Robert di Clemente, co-head of U.S. economic research at Salomon
Brothers Smith Barney. ``Most of us feel that they would have been
compelled to tighten if it had not been for the shock from Asia.''
</P>
<P>
   Stocks rose sharply for the second day. Bute whatever the market
was celebrating, it probably wasn't economic news, which came as no
surprise to Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Inflation may well be leveling out after declining for much of
this expansion. Right now, however, the strong dollar and the
growing share of imports are helping to hold down prices. Consumer
prices for goods are up just 0.4 percent from a year ago. It's not
just that imports, like gasoline, clothing and consumer
electronics, are cheaper. It's also that inexpensive imports are
helping restrain domestic prices by intensifying competition.
</P>
<P>
   The most encouraging news in Tuesday's consumer price report is
that inflation in the service sector _ which accounts for
two-thirds of spending and more than four-fifths of employment _ is
a remarkably tame 3 percent. That's half the rate of inflation in
services at the end of the 1980s boom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Services inflation is very benign,'' said Maury Harris, chief
economist at PaineWebber. ``It's higher than goods inflation, but
it hasn't accelerated.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That's true across a wide range of services. From a year ago,
for example, housing is up 3.3 percent, car repair 2.4 percent,
haircuts and other personal services 2.2 percent and airline and
other transportation 1.2 percent. Even the prices of medical
services, a category in which economists expect heftier increases
now that the shift to managed care has pretty much been completed,
is up just 3.2 percent, faster than a year ago but moderate by past
standards.
</P>
<P>
   With labor markets tighter than they've been in decades,
employment in services in growing by more than 230,000 workers a
month, and wages are rising handily. So the absence of inflation in
services is a puzzle.
</P>
<P>
   Like Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, Harris said he suspects that
the productivity of workers in services may be rising faster than
the official measures are capturing. Competition in services is
also fierce, so businesses are having a tough time raising prices.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, cheaper imports are having an indirect effect on
wage-setting in the service industry by holding down the cost of
living.
</P>
<P>
   The trade deficit will almost certainly keep getting bigger as
the troubles in Asia deepen. Exports to Asia have already fallen 21
percent from a year ago, and exports to the rest of the world are
growing slowly. Imports are apt to bounce back. Imports from Asia
are beginning to head higher. Indeed, the trade deficit is apt to
remain the biggest drag on economic growth, as it was during the
year's first half. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The unexpected improvement in the trade deficit is a temporary
respite. June's smaller trade deficit implies that growth in the
second &QL; 
quarter, which slowed to 1.4 percent from 5.4 percent in the
winter, might have been a bit stronger than first estimated. But
one detail of Tuesday's trade report _ a sharp decline in imports
of capital goods _ implies that business spending on new equipment
may have been weakening at the end of last quarter. If that's so,
the effects would cancel each other out.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, the widening trade deficit has knocked 2.5
percentage points off economic growth. The negative effect is
likely to diminish over time but economists expect it to persist
well into next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's bad news for American manufacturers, but good news for
inflation,''said Pierre Ellis, senior economist at Primark Decision
Economics, an economic forecasting firm.

 &HT;    QB Leard prepared for first start
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUBURN, Ala. _ In an ideal world, Ben Leard's first start as a
college quarterback would be a low-key, low-pressure afternoon. One
of those directional Louisiana schools would be the opponent, and
the game would be over at halftime _ no TV and very little hype.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Leard's debut as Auburn's quarterback on Sept. 3 will
take place in the most visable of circumstances: against a highly
ranked team _ No. 16 Virginia _ on national televison (ESPN), on a
Thursday night when it's the only game in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``A writer asked me if I was going to be nervous, knowing there
would be millions of people watching if I screwed up,'' Leard said.
``I hadn't really thought about it that way. I like to think of
millions of people watching when we play well and win.''
</P>
<P>
   What others might view as a nerve-wracking moment on a national
stage, the sophomore from Hartwell sees as a golden opportunity
that has been two years in the making. He has served his
apprenticeship under Dameyune Craig, Auburn's No. 3 all-time
passer. Craig, said Leard, taught him patience, leadership and the
benefits of hard work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Backing him up for two years was one of the most beneficial
things that has ever happened to me in football,'' Leard said.
``Dameyune has a brilliant football mind. He prepared me for
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Craig left, he did something even more important for
Leard. After tutoring the young quarterback for two years, Craig
sent this message to the rest of the returning Auburn football
team: ``This guy can play. Treat him as you would me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Dameyune paid a lot of attention to me, and that got me some
respect, even though I hadn't played,'' said Leard, who attempted
only two passes in four games last season. ``Dameyune accepted me,
so they accepted me. It gave me the confidence to tell a 320-pound
offensive lineman to get his butt in gear.''
</P>
<P>
   Leard's steep learning and leadership curve is one reason that
coach Terry Bowden feels confident as he reshapes the Auburn
offense in 1998. Last season under Craig, 78.7 percent of Auburn's
offense was passing and the Tigers were an uncustomary 11th in the
SEC (73.83 ypg) in rushing offense.
</P>
<P>
   This Auburn offense will be more conventional and balanced. The
Tigers have a veteran offensive line and, they hope, an emerging
star at tailback in sophomore Demontray Carter. Leard's job,
particularly early in the year, will be to keep things simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job, especially at first, is not to lose the football game
for us,'' Leard said. ``I can't make stupid mistakes. I have to
make good decisions. I have to get the ball to the right people and
see the right things. If I can do that early, then later on I'll
get the opportunity to have the pressure on me to win the game.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bowden wants to make one thing clear about his new
quarterback. Leard is young, but he's not some guy to just hand the
ball off and get out of the way. Bowden says that when it comes to
describing Leard, he'll defer to Dameyune Craig: This guy can play.
</P>
<P>
   ``People forget that Ben was an outstanding recruit. A lot of
people wanted him,'' said Bowden, who is beginning his sixth season
at Auburn. ``He hasn't played much in two years, so maybe some
people forgot about him. When it comes time to play, I expect him
to have a lot of polish.''
</P>
<P>
   As a high school senior in 1995, Leard was one of four Southern
quarterbacks who had the recruiters burning the midnight oil. The
others were Tim Couch of Hyden, Ky., Quincy Carter of Atlanta and
Tee Martin of Mobile, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were the group of quarterbacks that everybody was
recruiting. We all traded information about where we were going.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the four quarterbacks, only Couch ended up where most
expected, when he signed with Kentucky after a flirtation with
Tennessee. Carter signed with Georgia Tech, played two years of
professional baseball and then enrolled at Georgia. Martin verbally
committed to Auburn and then signed with Tennessee. Leard, who grew
up dreaming of playing for Georgia, signed with Auburn. All four
could be starting for their respect schools this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Two major events on Nov. 18, 1995, converged to steer Leard away
from Georgia and into the arms of Auburn. Early on that Saturday, a
press conference was held in Athens, Ga. to announce that Ray Goff
had been dismissed after seven seasons as Georgia's head coach.
</P>
<P>
   That night, at the invitation of Auburn assistant coach Rodney
Garner, Leard attended his first Auburn-Alabama game. Auburn won
the game 31-27 at Jordan-Hare Stadium, and Leard was hooked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had been to all the big rivalries _ Florida-Florida State,
Georgia-Georgia Tech _ but I had never seen anything like that,''
said Leard, who visited Auburn again in January and decided to sign
with the Tigers despite a late push from the new staff at Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   More irony: Garner, the man who persuaded Leard to say goodbye
to Georgia and sign with Auburn, is now on the Bulldog coaching
staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tough decision at the time, but now I can't imagine
being anywhere else,'' Leard said. ``Some things just feel right.
And Auburn feels right for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Leard's decision to leave home begins to pay its first real
dividends on Sept. 3. That when the nation _ and any family members
who couldn't get tickets _ will be watching as Leard fulfills his
dream of being a starting college quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting a tremendous opportunity here, a better
opportunity than I could ever have imagined,'' Leard said. ``Now
it's up to me to take advantage of it.''

 &HT;    Some complaints follow the close of the PGA Championship
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Was obscure Sahalee Country Club a success last week
as the venue for the 80th PGA Championship? For the most part, yes,
particularly with reports of an $80 million impact to the Seattle
area. But don't confuse it with a Winged Foot or Riviera for total
contentment.
</P>
<P>
   Many players don't like a course where cramped conditions take
the driver out of their bags. There's something missing when
everyone tees off at the first hole of a major championship with a
long iron in their hands.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's unique with the trees, but I'm anxious to start hitting
drivers again,'' Mark Calcavecchia said Sunday afternoon before
flying to Castle Pines, Colo., for the Sprint International. ''I'm
looking forward to the International and lashing some 350-yard
drives off that first tee.''
</P>
<P>
   Anything else? Yes. Par-5's converted to par-4's were too severe
and didn't fit the topography. Especially the 475-yard 18th, which
required a good drive to reach the top of the slope, but offered
players a tiny landing area and beckoning rough. Plus, a long iron
to a green built for a shorter iron.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a really nice golf course,'' said Joey Sindelar, ''but
I personally wish they would leave the par-5's as par-5's. The 18th
would have been a cool par-5.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Sahalee's 18th became a par-4 more mostly for fan
access. With the 17th green directly behind the tee used for the
18th as a par-5, tournament officials did not feel fans could view
each without disturbing the other.
</P>
<P>
   One thing's certain: Sahalee was a smash compared to the PGA of
America's own Valhalla Golf Club in 1996. That the PGA has chosen
Valhalla to be its showcase venue for 2000 _ when Augusta National,
Pebble Beach and St. Andrews will house the other three majors _ is
a situation already gaining unpopularity.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just can't believe it,'' said Atlanta's Billy Andrade. ''I
thought Valhalla was awful compared to this.''
</P>
<P>
   ''They had some good holes there (at Valhalla),'' said
Calcavecchia, ''but I'd rather play here (Sahalee).''
</P>
<P>
   The PGA clearly gambles when it moves to the Crooked Sticks and
Valhalla's of the golf world. Being the last major of the year, the
PGA needs substance to maintain big-time interest, and places like
Riviera, Winged Foot or Medinah ('99) always make for better
championships. As the Atlanta Athletic Club, which has hosted a few
majors, is likely to do in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Just look at the last five years: Nick Price goes wire-to-wire
at Southern Hills in 1994. (Grade: A). Steve Elkington beats Colin
Montgomerie in a playoff at Riviera in 1995, birdieing the storied
18th (A+). Mark Brooks beats Kenny Perry in a playoff at Valhalla
in 1996 (C+). Davis Love III outduels Justin Leonard at Winged Foot
in 1997 (cue the rainbow, roll teary footage; A+); Vijay Singh
bests Steve Stricker at Sahalee in 1998 (B-).

 &HT;    Norman cleared to hit balls
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Greg Norman? Remember him? Out since April following surgery on
his right shoulder, Norman was given the OK to start hitting
pitching wedges with a full swing this week in Hobe Sound, Fla. He
plans to work up to longer clubs over the next two months and will
make the Shark Shootout Nov. 13-15 his return event, followed by
the Australian Open and the Presidents Cup at Royal Melbourne.
Caddie Tony Navarro, who's working for Jeff Sluman while his boss
mends, predicts he's ''really going to be ready.'' He wasn't
talking about Norman's physical condition, either. . . Marietta's
Larry Nelson will see Columbus orthopedic specialist Tom Boers
today for another opinion on the herniated cervical disk that took
him off the Senior Tour July 24. Working with light weights this
week to strengthen his shoulder, Nelson has felt the return of some
pain and therefore backed off earlier plans to start hitting
wedges. Frustrated with his progress, Nelson said, ''Each day or
each week I delay hitting balls pushes me a week further into the
year. Right now I don't see playing before Indianapolis (Sept.
11-13).'' Although Nelson and Orlando orthopedic specialist Norton
Baker feel surgery can be avoided, the two-time PGA and U.S. Open
champion said, ''Sometimes you think, 'Will you ever play the same
way again? Will I ever gain back the strength and distance I once
had?'
</P>
<P>
   It kind of worries you sometimes. I don't want to compete if I
can't compete at the level I was at before.''
</P>
<P>
   Singh speaks through his game
</P>
<P>
   Vijay Singh, the new PGA champion, would labor to gather votes
for golf's congeniality award. He is often grumpy with reporters
and is prone to refusing invitations to the media center. Beyond
that, Singh seems to blame reporters if they mention the accusation
of cheating on his scorecard during the 1985 Indonesian Open that
led to a suspension from the Asian Tour. Say this for Singh,
though. Sunday's pressure at Sahalee wasn't the most intense of his
life. As the story goes, back when Singh was making a couple of
hundred bucks a month as a club pro in Borneo, he supplemented his
income by gambling with well-to-do members. During one,
palm-sweating occasion he played the 18th hole of a match, as
Sports Illustrated's John Garrity chronicled, ''with $10 in his
pocket and $700 on the line.'' When Singh hit his first drive out
of bounds, he remembered thinking, ''How would I pay if I lost?
Would I lose my job? Would I tell my wife?'' Singh averted the
emergency by reloading, making ''eagle'' with his second ball for a
par and winning the match when his opponent hit into the water and
double-bogeyed. Said Singh. ''Now, whenever I'm in contention in a
tournament, I think about that.''

   KONA, Hawaii _ While many Americans spent a good part of Tuesday
mulling over President Clinton's speech, when he acknowledged his
relationship with a White House intern, Vice President Al Gore did
his best to continue avoiding the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who is on a two-week vacation with his family here on the
island of Hawaii, made a brief public appearance across the state
at the airport in Lihue on Kauai island.
</P>
<P>
   But he said little that was different from his remarks following
the president's speech Monday night, in which Gore expressed
support for Clinton and the hope that the nation would get beyond
the matter. He took no questions.
</P>
<P>
   For Gore, the likely Democratic presidential nominee in 2000,
the controversial developments swirling about the president are a
political minefield. Throughout the investigation into the
president's relationship with a former intern, Monica Lewinsky,
Gore has been a Clinton loyalist but has seemed to position himself
far enough to avoid being tainted by any fallout.
</P>
<P>
   Even his vacation plans, scheduled long ago, give at least the
appearance of separation. Hawaii is about as far from the White
House as Gore could have gone and still be in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But his trip here is serving another purpose. Unlike most other
places, the state economy in Hawaii is sagging, a condition that
has undermined support for Gov. Ben Cayetano in the governor's
race. Statewide polls show that Cayetano is trailing his Republican
challenger, Linda Lingle, the mayor of Maui.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving for the mainland next week, Gore is scheduled to
make several appearances with Cayetano, including one at a
fund-raiser. Gore is also scheduled to speak at the annual
convention of the American Federation of State, County and
Municipal Employees and at a school to drum up support for smaller
class sizes, a favorite issue of the administration.
</P>
<P>
   Before heading back to Washington on Aug. 27, Gore is planning
to make several appearances in the San Francisco Bay Area.

 &HT;    Minors see major fan boost
 &HT;    By Guy Curtright
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The major leagues are still trying to win back fans lost because
of the 1994 players' strike, but baseball is booming in the minors.
</P>
<P>
   Attendance at minor-league games averaged a record 3,475 last
season, continuing a revival that began in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The total attendance of 34,721,716 for 16 leagues was nearly a
60 percent increase from 10 years earlier and more than double the
figure of 20 years ago. The only time the minors drew more was the
late 1940s, when there were more than three times as many teams.
</P>
<P>
   Minor-league franchises, which had been guaranteed money losers,
now sell for as much as $8 million in Class AAA and $6 million in
Class AA. Even Class A teams go for $2 million to $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Most minor-league teams are privately owned, but Atlanta owns
three of its top four farm teams _ Richmond, Greenville and Macon.
</P>
<P>
   Class AAA Richmond and Class AA Greenville both are heading
toward franchise attendance records, even though the teams have
losing records.
</P>
<P>
   In the top 10 of minor-league attendance every season since the
12,000-seat Diamond opened in 1985, Richmond is on pace to better
its record of 540,489 set in 1993. The International League team is
averaging 7,390 per game.
</P>
<P>
   Greenville has drawn 224,244 for 56 dates, an average of 4,004.
The Southern League team's franchise record is 254,049 set last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Macon also would be in range of a franchise attendance mark if
not for five rainouts. The M-Braves' record is 129,723, set last
year. Macon, averaging 1,828, has drawn 109,688 this year with six
games left in the Class A South Atlantic League season.
</P>
<P>
   The minor-league attendance leader is Buffalo, averaging 10,478
in the International League. Buffalo is the only minor-league team
to draw 1 million in a season. The Bisons did it six years in a
row.

HUFFMAN ATTEMPTING TO CAST A NEW LOOK TO TCU FOOTBALL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By WHIT CANNING 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ At the end of another long, hot practice
session, TCU running back LaDainian Tomlinson leans against a
cyclone fence in the shade, waiting for a ride back to the locker
room.
</P>
<P>
   The serenity of the moment, however, is jolted by the sound of a
familiar voice: ``Hey L.T., you're gonna dye your hair pretty soon,
right?''
</P>
<P>
   Momentarily startled, Tomlinson smiles and says, ``Yeah, man,
I'm gonna dye it ... pretty soon.''
</P>
<P>
   And so, the disease spreads. The bleached blond malady that has
struck the TCU receivers will evidently soon infest the running
backs. And there are those higher in the organization who might be
in grave danger.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coaches have promised that if we go to a bowl or do
anything like that, they'll bleach theirs, too,'' said the
perpetrator, Royce Huffman, grinning widely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, Royce already hit me with that one on a TV show,'' coach
Dennis Franchione said, laughing, ``and, well, I guess I said yes.
He challenged us to do it, and if it helps us, I'll do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it will take more than blond hair to transform the
1-10 Frogs into princes, but Huffman is a key milepost on TCU's
road to recovery.
</P>
<P>
   He returns for his third season as the team punter and second as
punt return specialist. He is also running No. 1 at a slot receiver
position, and Franchione is disappointed that he was unable to try
out for the quarterback job during spring drills.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really would have liked to have him trying for that job,''
Franchione said. ``He was a good high school quarterback, and I
think he might have been a fit for our offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has good skills and he's extremely competitive. But the
biggest thing is that he just understands the game so well, and
he's a valuable person to have out there on the field. He picks up
things very quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, however, Huffman was busy gaining second-team
All-America status as TCU's sturdy third baseman _ hitting .420
with 17 home runs, 77 runs batted in and a .783 slugging
percentage.
</P>
<P>
   He candidly admits he was disappointed at not being drafted, but
the game ain't over yet.
</P>
<P>
   A junior in football eligibility, he will be a baseball senior
in the spring and _ barring injury _ is a virtual cinch to become
the school career leader in hits, doubles, home runs, total bases
and walks. He already holds the record for RBI. He also figures at
no worse than second in runs, batting average and slugging
percentage. Among the season's highlights were a 20-game hitting
streak and 27 multihit games, including 16 where he had three or
more hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be kind of stupid of me to say I wasn't disappointed
in the draft,'' he said, ``but I'm not going to dwell on it. It's
football season now, and this team is coming back.''
</P>
<P>
   If so, Huffman will doubtless be a major reason. After averaging
42.6 yards per punt in 1996, he averaged 41.6 on 81 punts last
season and ran down under five of them to make the tackle on a
startled return man. He averaged 5.6 yards on 31 punt returns,
earning second-team All-Western Athletic Conference honors. He
completed a pass and caught one.
</P>
<P>
   Hence the nickname, ``Slash,'' after the Pittsburgh Steelers'
multi-talented quarterback Kordell Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   Franchione admits to some misgivings about watching his star
punter run pass routes in a game but figures the return on the
investment could be beneficial for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Royce and I have sat down and discussed it a couple of times,
and he seems comfortable with it,'' Franchione said. ``Also,
(freshman) Joey Biasatti is coming along well and could probably
take over the punting if he had to.
</P>
<P>
   ``From my standpoint, we're in a situation where we need to put
our best people out on the field, and right now, Royce is running
No. 1 at three positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is also his value to the team in other ways. There is a
leadership council on this team, and in the spring his teammates
voted Royce onto the council, even though he's a junior and was off
playing baseball at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   And so, armed with Huffman's leadership and grooming skills, the
Frogs are ready for a brave new world. So is Huffman.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, the only real problem I have right now is that I'm so
excited I can't sleep,'' Huffman said.

 &HT;    AFC poised to go public after announcing buyout of Cinnabon
Int'l
 &HT;    By Mickey H. Gramig
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ AFC Enterprises is buying Cinnabon International for
$65 million, giving the Atlanta-based restaurant company the
country's largest cinnamon roll retailer and setting the wheels in
motion to take AFC public.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle-based Cinnabon, which posted $140 million in sales for
the 12 months ending March 31, has 358 retail cinnamon roll
bakeries in 39 states, Canada and Mexico. The 13-year-old company
specializes in high-traffic locations at malls, airports and
supermarkets; it owns and operates 214 of its stores and franchises
the remaining 144.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, set to close in late September, will give AFC six
brands with $2 billion in annual sales and roughly 3,200
restaurants, bakeries and cafes in 25 countries. It also will give
AFC the momentum it wants to achieve before an initial public
offering.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd probably be targeting sometime in second quarter or later
of next year, depending on market conditions,'' said Chief
Executive Frank Belatti.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly feel that we've accomplished the task of getting
ourselves ready for new growth,'' he added. ``This is kind of a
pivotal year for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Belatti helped form AFC, then known as America's Favorite
Chicken, in 1992. That year, the company's Popeyes Chicken &AMP;
Biscuits and Churchs Chicken chains posted a $32 million loss on
$1.1 billion in sales.
</P>
<P>
   AFC celebrated its five-year turnaround with 1997 net income of
$8.8 million, or 25 cents per share, on $1.6 billion in sales. AFC
also stepped up its growth strategy last year, by selling $175
million in 10-year notes to fund acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1997, AFC spent $11.8 million to acquire the Chesapeake
Bagel Bakery chain, which it overhauled and now calls Chesapeake
Bagels, Bakery &AMP; Cafe. Less than a year later, it completed its
purchase of Seattle Coffee, and its Seattle's Best and Torrefazione
Italia brand cafes, for an estimated $50 million to $75 million.
</P>
<P>
   This past spring, AFC announced a deal to buy the
California-based Paradise Bakery &AMP; Cafe chain. That acquisition,
which included 49 West Coast restaurants, was called off last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had been pursuing the Paradise transaction as well as
(Cinnabon) and one other opportunity,'' Belatti said. ``You never
really know which one will materialize.''
</P>
<P>
   Belatti said the Paradise deal was called off because the more
expensive Cinnabon deal came through.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, we just don't have the people to devote to doing two
integrations and all the work that needs to be done,'' he said.
``We have to target and focus our energies.''
</P>
<P>
   That will involve determining how AFC wants to leverage Cinnabon
in connection with the company's other brands. For example, it must
decide whether to replace Cinnabon's current coffee with Seattle's
Best or add the chain's cinnamon rolls and other offerings to AFC's
Chesapeake locations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea will be to take the brands we have and build brand
awareness for all of them...and make sure we're not cannibalizing
on the existing business,'' Belatti said.
</P>
<P>
   Cinnabon will continue to have offices in Seattle, as is the
case with Seattle Coffee, but some key executives likely will be
relocated to Atlanta. About 50 new Cinnabon locations will be added
each year for the next several years, and most will be franchises.

 &HT;    Intranets changing the way some conduct business
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It is euphemistically called busy work, but it can
drain a day in a bad way.
</P>
<P>
   A marketing rep needs an ad display for a trade show. But half a
dozen people are in charge of knowing what's available. Hours can
burn securing the right one.
</P>
<P>
   Nokia hopes to tighten that process, and others, with its
Intranet. An in-house network, Nokia's Intranet will give the
company's 3,500 employees in the Americas desktop-access to
companywide information such as human resources department forms
and company news and site-specific services such as reservation
lists for conference rooms and trade show displays.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a pretty easy sell,'' said Stephen McClintick, who will
head the eight people developing and maintaining Nokia's Intranet,
the password-protected part of the telecommunication company's
World Wide Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something that a lot of companies are doing and I
think everybody here saw the need for it,'' McClintick said.
``Improving employee communications was the main selling point.
It's fairly easy to point out to somebody that if you could reserve
a conference room on the Intranet by looking at a map, clicking on
a room and pulling up a schedule, it saves time and money.''
</P>
<P>
   Intranets are evolving, like their big brother the Internet, at
Pentium-like speed. Companies posted first versions in 1995. Early
sites were more or less electronic bulletin boards, static
documents electronically tacked for employees to read.
</P>
<P>
   The latest Intranets, like Ketchum Public Relations Worldwide's,
which went online in February, are becoming workday fixtures,
although the term Intranet is still not a common term outside the
online world. Ketchum PR's Intranet is called the Ketchum Global
Network, or KGN _ avoiding the use of the word Intranet altogether
to dilute the technospeak and confusion that comes from the
similarly named Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The Ketchum network has an electronic listing of names and
addresses, forms, e-mail addresses, media lists, company news
updated daily, management memos, and an in-house search engine,
which acts as a kind of corporate yellow pages, a way of preserving
institutional knowledge. If a public relations representative is
working on an airline account, he or she can search for others in
the company who have worked on similar accounts as well as read the
text of old presentations to airline accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our Intranet is an electronic equivalent of everything we do
at our desk on a daily basis,'' said Paul McKeon, president of
Ketchum PR's Crescent Communications in Atlanta. Ketchum PR has
developed a new media group that will coordinate and develop
Internet and Intranet marketing efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Creating an Intranet site can be expensive and time consuming.
The typical Intranet has a three-month gestation period and costs
about $100,00 for the consulting. And that does not include
hardware costs. Ketchum PR is consulting with Nokia on the
development of its Intranet, which will consolidate 30 networks
used by the Finnish company's American business groups.
</P>
<P>
   Two of Ketchum PR's full-time employees _ one in New York City,
one in Washington, D.C. _ update the global Web site daily. Any of
Ketchum's 1,000 employees can e-mail information for posting. The
two staffers also listen in on conference calls and write reports
for the company news section of the in-house network.
</P>
<P>
   Norcross-based Etech develops software to make Intranets more
user-friendly. Karla Mock, Etech director of business development,
said most companies use Intranets to improve efficiency in their
human resources, sales and marketing, manufacturing and accounting
departments.
</P>
<P>
   ``More tools and technology are available. It's not just
browsing and looking at information,'' she said. ``It allows more
intricate searches, functions like mortgage calculators and links
to related articles and company archives.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Benelli of Kinetic Design, a Web-design firm in Midtown
Atlanta, said she hops on her Intranet up to 20 times a day,
looking for client and prospect information and pulling up employee
schedules to track down a telecommuting worker with a call holding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intranets got a little bit of a slow start, but they've really
taken off,'' said Andy Roach, director of Ketchum PR's new media
group.
</P>
<P>
   ``They represent a kind of a sea change in the way people do
business. It gives them access to things they didn't have.
Companies are saying more and more that our greatest champions of
who we are as a company are our employees and they need to know
what we're doing from a strategic level and a marketing level,''
Roach said.
</P>
<P>
   For developers, an Intranet is a chance to work with a captive
audience. Intranets have fewer users and more of a built-in sense
of community than the Internet. And developers know the equipment
capabilities of their users.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the Web, you have to go with the lowest common
denominator,'' Roach said. ``Intranets are actually kind of fun for
developers because we can go to town on them.''

 &HT;    500 days and countingBy Rob Chambers
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Today is the 500th day before the millennium monster
begins biting vulnerable computer systems on Jan. 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Today's milestone is a serious reminder of the approaching
deadline. And it's more of a ceremonial date than a real one, since
Year 2000 problems have and will crop up before then. But it's a
good time to take stock. If your company is running behind, there
are some user groups in the area that can help you get started or
get the process completed.
</P>
<P>
   If your company is big or can benefit from the experience of
large organizations like Ford Motor Company, then the Information
Management Forum may be for you (http://www.infomgmtforum.com).
It's an Atlanta headquartered association of U.S. and Canadian
information technology professionals at Fortune 1000-sized
companies. In the metro area, Coca-Cola Enterprises, Equifax,
Georgia-Pacific, Life of Georgia, Southern Company, and SunTrust
Banks are members.
</P>
<P>
   This organization's Year 2000 group meets each quarter for two
days to share information. Written reports of the proceedings are
available.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, Day 500 indicates there's not a whole lot of time
left ... While there's 500 days until Jan. 1, 2000, before that
many systems will be affected by what we call millennium events,''
said James A. Jones, a director of the Information Management Forum
and head of its Year 2000 group.
</P>
<P>
   Before Jan. 1, 2000 many computer systems ``will have to
encounter or process a date in the year 2000 or beyond. So, for
example, business and inventory planning systems that go out 12
months or beyond could have trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones went on to say:
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a very large company and you haven't done anything
yet, you're in trouble. You have systems that are date impacted and
the time you have left isn't enough to make systems compliant.
There is still time, however, to get core systems compliant and to
develop contingency plans for those systems you will not have time
to make compliant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Small companies that use stand-alone PCs or small network
systems in their business still have plenty of time, but they have
to get going. And the issue for them could become the shortage of
people available to do the work and potentially a shortage of
parts.
</P>
<P>
   ``But in Atlanta at this time the companies in my group are not
experiencing a skill shortage at this time,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   A broader forum is offered by the Atlanta Year 2000 Users Group
(http://www.bytewise.com/atlyear2000/). It was organized by larger
companies, but it's open to all, said Paul Arne, a partner at the
Morris, Manning &AMP; Martin law firm and a board member of the Atlanta
Users Group.
</P>
<P>
   So where do most companies stand? On Day 500 the news is not
exactly good. Consulting giant Cap Gemini America unveiled a survey
last week showing that half of the interviewed companies plan to do
no Y2K testing. That's disturbing because virtually all the experts
in the field say that testing is the most essential part of the
cleanup process.
</P>
<P>
   Also last week the Gartner Group released the results of its
worldwide survey of 15,000 companies and government organizations
in 83 countries _ 23 percent of those who responded haven't done
anything about Y2K yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worry about those companies who are not fully aware of the
problem and who are not working hard,'' said Arne.

CONGRESS TRYING TO DECIDE HOW TO DEAL WITH CLINTON REVELATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The combination of President Clinton's defiant
attack on independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr and his failure to
explain why his sworn denial of an affair with a former White House
intern was ``legally accurate'' has infuriated key Republicans and
heightened the possibility that impeachment hearings will be held.
</P>
<P>
   Some members of Congress, meanwhile, were studying alternatives
to impeachment, including the possibility that hearings could lead
to a vote to reprimand or censure the president. That would be
comparable to what happened in 1983, when former Representative
Gerry Studds, a Massachusetts Democrat, was censured for having
sexual relations with a teenage male page.
</P>
<P>
   This reaction to Clinton's nationally televised admission Monday
night that he had an inappropriate relationship with Monica S.
Lewinsky is the opposite of what Clinton and his aides had desired.
Indeed, some Clinton allies Tuesday continued to express
astonishment at Clinton's decision to use more than half of his
brief address to attack Starr, whom many Republicans now believe is
a vindicated prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a showdown coming. ... Tuesday was not it,'' said
Representative Martin Meehan, a Massachusetts Democrat who sits on
the House Judiciary Committee that would consider whether to launch
impeachment proceedings. Meehan said Clinton did not provide
``enough detail'' for the issue to be resolved, yet Meehan stressed
that he does not see grounds for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   But Representative Bill McCollum, a Florida Republican who also
sits on the Judiciary Committee, said he would be compelled to vote
to impeach the president if it is proven that Clinton lied last
January when he swore in a deposition that he did not have sexual
relations with Lewinsky. While Clinton said Monday that his initial
denial was ``legally accurate,'' he did not explain what he meant,
possibly opening the door for Congress to examine details of the
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the president has clearly at the end of the day been guilty
of having committed perjury and lied under oath, then I would have
to vote for impeachment,'' McCollum said in an interview. McCollum
also said Congress has the authority to censure or reprimand,
noting that ``we condemn things every day.'' But McCollum stressed
that perjury should lead to impeachment, not just a censure.
</P>
<P>
   While Republicans were expected to be critical of the president,
the Democratic response to Clinton's admission clearly was not as
positive as the White House had hoped. House minority leader
Richard Gephardt said he was ``gratified'' the president testified
before the grand jury. ``I cannot condone the relationship the
president has acknowledged and am very disappointed in his personal
conduct,'' Gephardt said.
</P>
<P>
   Senate minority leader Thomas Daschle said he was
``disappointed'' that Clinton had not given a full explanation
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, who was assured by
Clinton in January that he did not have an affair with Lewinsky,
announced she no longer has the same degree of trust in the
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``My trust in his credibility has been badly shattered,''
Feinstein said &UR;  &LR; Tuesday. And Representative Paul McHale, a
Pennsylvania Democrat, said Clinton should ``resign or face
impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders such as House Speaker Newt Gingrich took
pains to stay above the fray: ``Everyone would be best served if
they waited for Judge Starr's report and found out what all the
facts were.''
</P>
<P>
   Senator Orrin Hatch, a Utah Republican who chairs the Senate
Judiciary Committee, said Starr has been vindicated by Clinton's
admission. And as he left a television studio in Utah Monday night,
Hatch said Clinton's attack on Starr was a huge mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the day-after reaction in Congress to Clinton's speech
focused on the president's assertion that his initial denial of an
affair with Lewinsky was ``legally accurate.''
</P>
<P>
   In his deposition for the Paula Jones lawsuit, Clinton was given
a definition of sexual relations that some Clinton defenders
maintain did not include acts such as oral sex. However, the
definition was broad enough to include ``contact with genitalia.''
But Clinton reportedly told the grand jury on Monday he didn't
think it was necessary to describe what kind of contact he had with
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Some legal analysts and a number of Democrats believe that no
matter what Clinton said in the deposition, it does not constitute
perjury because the Jones lawsuit was thrown out and the
president's statements about Lewinsky were not ``material'' to the
case. Meehan, a former prosecutor, is among those who hold this
view. In legal terms, he said, ``there is a difference between
lying and perjury.'' While Clinton admitted he lied to the public,
Meehan said, that does not mean the president committed perjury in
the legal sense. As a result, Clinton should not be impeached for
perjury, Meehan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on the evidence out there, it is highly unlikely that
even Republicans would vote for impeachment,'' Meehan said. He
added that Republicans might try to invoke a lesser penalty such as
censure of the president.

FBI MOB INFORMANT EXPECTED TO TESTIFY THIS WEEK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHELLEY MURPHY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It's an FBI whodunnit: Who was the unidentified FBI
agent who warned fugitive South Boston crime boss James J.
``Whitey'' Bulger to flee on the eve of his 1995 federal
racketeering indictment?
</P>
<P>
   Was it the same unnamed agent who routinely leaked confidential
information to Bulger and his partner, Stephen Flemmi, throughout
the 1970s and 1980s while they were moonlighting as FBI informants?
</P>
<P>
   The mystery could be solved as early as Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   That's when Flemmi is expected to detail in US District Court
his corrupt relationship with the FBI, his bid to convince a judge
to drop the racketeering case against him, the fugitive Bulger and
three other men.
</P>
<P>
   Since the FBI confirmed last year that Bulger and Flemmi were
longtime bureau informants, Flemmi has tantalized federal
prosecutors with four affidavits detailing a history of FBI
misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   In some instances Flemmi named names, but in other cases the
identities of agents who thwarted ongoing investigations with leaks
to Bulger and Flemmi were conspicuously absent.
</P>
<P>
   The omissions have fueled speculation that Flemmi is shielding
some agents or has been saving his biggest bombshells for his debut
on the witness stand. There's also the possibility that Bulger
didn't always identify his FBI leaks to Flemmi.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the 64-year-old Flemmi is, arguably, the most anticipated
witness since US District Judge Mark Wolf launched hearings last
January into Flemmi's claim that the FBI gave him and Bulger
permission to commit crimes, short of murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect that his testimony will track the information
contained in his affidavits and will be very powerful evidence,''
said attorney Anthony Cardinale, who represents reputed New England
Mafia Boss Francis Salemme, Flemmi's codefendant.
</P>
<P>
   Already, some witnesses called by the defense in the lengthy
pre-trial hearings have supported some of Flemmi's most explosive
allegations.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Disgraced former FBI supervisor John Morris, testifying under
immunity, admitted pocketing $7,000 in bribes from Bulger and
Flemmi between 1982 and 1988 and warning the pair that the FBI had
tapped the phone of a bookmaker who worked for them. But Morris
also claimed that FBI Special Agent John Connolly Jr., who served
as the handler for Bulger and Flemmi between 1975 and 1990,
delivered some of the bribes.
</P>
<P>
   It's a charge that Connolly vehemently denies. And Connolly
isn't mentioned in any of Flemmi's affidavits.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Connolly refused to testify in the pretrial hearings,
citing his fifth amendment right against self-incrimination. And
federal prosecutors have refused a defense request to immunize
Connolly, saying they first want to hear whether Flemmi implicates
Connolly in any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have nothing to fear if Flemmi tells the truth,'' Connolly
said during a recent interview. ``I think Stevie knows I was an
honorable person with these people. I don't think he has any
quarrel with me.''
</P>
<P>
   A key question for the court to decide is whether the FBI did
indeed authorize Flemmi and Bulger to commit crimes.
</P>
<P>
   In one affidavit, Flemmi claims that during a meeting at Morris'
Lexington home, the agent gave him and Bulger permission to do
anything they wanted ``so long as we didn't clip anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Flemmi wrote, ``On several occasions, in the course of similar
conversations, Mr. Bulger and I were assured that we could be
involved in any criminal activities short of committing murder and
we would be `protected.'''
</P>
<P>
   Morris denied making such a promise.
</P>
<P>
   Even Connolly, during an interview with the Globe, said Bulger
and Flemmi were never given immunity for all crimes except murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``The word was these people could operate a gambling and
loansharking syndicate with impunity,'' Connolly said. ``It wasn't,
`anything but murder.' There are a lot of other crimes they were
not given permission to commit.''
</P>
<P>
   In his affidavits, Flemmi claims the FBI began protecting him
almost as soon as he turned informant in 1965. Flemmi said the
agent who cultivated him, H. Paul Rico, warned him in 1969 to flee
because he was about to be charged with attempted murder.
</P>
<P>
   Flemmi was indicted for the 1968 car bombing that injured
Everett attorney John Fitzgerald. He evaded the charge by remaining
on the lam until 1974.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Flemmi said he surrendered only after Rico warned him it was
safe to return because the case against him was about to be
dropped. It was.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Testifying last January, Rico denied Flemmi's claims.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the allegations in Flemmi's affidavits involving
unidentified agents include:
</P>
<P>
   -- Flemmi was warned of ``the precise date'' the 1995
racketeering indictment would be returned, so he could flee.
</P>
<P>
   -- In 1989, Bulger was warned that South Boston real estate
agent Tim Connolly was ``wired up'' and he should stay away from
him. Connolly was allegedly extorted at knifepoint by Bulger and
had begun cooperating with the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   -- Between 1984 and 1989, unidentified FBI agents warned Flemmi
and Bulger about a number of drug investigations.
</P>
<P>
   -- In 1977, the FBI told Bulger that representatives of a
vending machine company urged the FBI to bring charges against him.
But FBI agents convinced the representatives not to pursue the case
because their lives would be in danger and they'd have to join the
Federal Witness Protection program.

<P>
   EDGARTOWN, Mass. _ Seeking solitude and a respite from the most
wrenching experience of his political life, President Clinton
departed Washington on Tuesday for a twelve-day vacation on the
resort island of Martha's Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who Monday evening made a combative admission of an
illicit relationship with a former White House intern, Monica
Lewinsky, strode from the White House in mid-afternoon clutching
the hand of his 18-year-old daughter, Chelsea. Chelsea, in turn,
was holding hands with her mother, First Lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton. Their Labrador, Buddy, bounded up the stairs of the
presidential helicopter before them.
</P>
<P>
   The televised tableau of family togetherness was designed to
convey a sense of an embattled family rallying together in one of
the most difficult hours of a political career and a marriage that
have survived repeated crises brought on by Clinton's infidelity
and his parsimony with the truth. But never before Monday's painful
confessional has the president's behavior been laid so bare before
his family _ and the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a family that has some healing to do,'' said Mike
McCurry, the White House press secretary who accompanied the
Clintons on Air Force One to Martha's Vineyard. He said the
president's first priority on his vacation is to find the privacy
he needs ``so he can do some repair work within the family.'' After
that, McCurry said, the president will begin a series of public
appearances designed to regain some momentum for his stalled agenda
and to try to rebuild the trust of the American people.
</P>
<P>
   Marsha Berry, a spokeswoman for Mrs. Clinton, said that the
first lady is ``committed to her marriage and she loves her husband
and daughter very much.'' Ms. Berry said Mrs. Clinton's love for
her husband is ``compassionate and steadfast'' but that she is
uncomfortable with the public airing of the family's soiled linen.
</P>
<P>
   The White House did not release any details of the first
family's plans during their stay on Martha's Vineyard. Aides are
preparing a small, private celebration of Clinton's 52nd birthday
on Friday. They indicated that it would not be a lavish,
celebrity-drenched affair like those marking earlier presidential
birthdays, but they would not reveal more.
</P>
<P>
   Among those greeting Clinton at the Edgartown airport was Vernon
Jordan, the Washington lawyer and presidential confidant, who
enveloped Mrs. Clinton in an enormous bear hug when she stepped off
Air Force One. Clinton waited silently and alone a few paces away
as Mrs. Clinton and Jordan spoke, apparently unwilling to wade into
the crowd without his wife by his side.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan was one of the first witnesses called before a federal
grand jury investigating the relationship between Clinton and Ms.
Lewinsky. Jordan helped secure a job for Ms. Lewinsky at Revlon,
where he is a director, at a time when she was under subpoena to
testify in the Paula Jones sexual misconduct lawsuit against the
president. Jordan has said that his efforts on Ms. Lewinsky's
behalf were a personal favor and not an attempt to influence her
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Singer Carly Simon also appeared to greet the Clintons. Hundreds
of other supporters turned out to welcome the first family at the
Edgartown airport in a small-scale demonstration of support that
the Clintons obviously relished.
</P>
<P>
   The three Clintons _ with Chelsea in the lead _ shook hands with
members of the crowd for about 35 minutes before getting into their
car and heading to the borrowed home where they are staying here,
an Oyster Pond waterfront compound owned by Richard Friedman, a
Boston property developer. Their visit here was their fourth since
Clinton assumed the presidency in 1993. The president and Mrs.
Clinton worked the crowd together without speaking to one another
or touching.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spent part of the day before leaving Washington taking
calls from Democratic members of Congress, who urged the president
to try to put the Lewinsky matter behind him, aides said. The tone
of the talks, according to a White House official, was similar to
that of the president's Monday address _ regretful but determined
to continue to challenge the legitimacy of the investigation of the
Whitewater independent counsel, Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   McCurry said the President also spoke privately with several
members of the White House staff who have ardently defended him
against the charges of public and private wrongdoing that have
seized the presidency since January. Those aides were subdued on
Tuesday, stunned by the president's admission but hardly surprised
that what many in Washington suspected turned out to be true.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's some sense of relief'' that the waiting for Clinton to
speak on the affair had ended, McCurry said. ``People just want to
get on with why they came here.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   McCurry has already announced his departure from the White House
in October. Joe Lockhart, the deputy press secretary and McCurry's
designated successor, parroted the official line. ``People are
generally relieved that we got through the day yesterday and
they're glad it's over,'' Lockhart said. ``People are satisfied
with the speech.''
</P>
<P>
   Rahm Emanuel, one of the president's most aggressive defenders,
said that opinion varied among White House staff members about the
president's statement, but said that he is content with the
explanation of his actions that Clinton gave.
</P>
<P>
   ``My feeling about the person is the same as the feeling was
before,'' Emanuel said, his tone lacking the usual combative edge.
``I was raised that you don't walk on a man when he's down. He
acknowledged that he misled his wife. I don't need more than that.
Do you? He doesn't have to say he's sorry for misleading me.''
Emanuel also is planning to leave the White House this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of how political Washington and the American public
receive Clinton's grudging confession of personal sin, those who
turned out to welcome them to their island escape were supportive
and sympathetic. Ann Sherman, a Martha's Vineyard resident and
retired pediatric nurse, said she had never gone to the airport to
welcome Clinton but came this time to show her support.
</P>
<P>
   ''People feel a little sorry for him and his family and they
want to let him have a vacation here,'' she said. ``He looked very
terrible last night. He's been wrung through the ringer.'' Ms.
Sherman added, ``He has to set an example but we are human. He made
a very very bad mistake, but he's got to get back to running this
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Judy Feingold, a summer resident and a managed health-care
consultant from Boston, said she was ``embarrassed'' for the
president but wanted to show solidarity. ''One wants to show a
sense of respect for Hillary and Chelsea and take one's cue from
them,'' Ms. Feingold said. ``I can't expect it's going to be a
celebratory time.''

   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton refused to answer several
questions before a grand jury on Monday on the ground that they
invaded his privacy, but legal experts generally agree that if he
were to appear before the grand jury under subpoena he would have
no recognized legal grounds to continue resisting.
</P>
<P>
   When ordinary citizens appear before a grand jury, usually under
subpoena, they are required to answer every question put to them
unless they invoke the Fifth Amendment right against compelled
self-incrimination or some other recognized privilege, like the one
that protects spouses from being required to testify against each
other. Subpoenaed witnesses may be compelled to testify against
their friends, siblings and children, and to disclose the most
embarrassing of personal details.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grand juries may ask just about anything,'' said Yale Kamisar,
a law professor at the University of Michigan. ``There's simply no
protection against embarrassing yourself or humiliating yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   In nearly five hours before the grand jury, President Clinton
acknowledged an inappropriate relationship with Monica Lewinsky but
pointedly refused to answer several of the prosecutors' questions
about the details of that relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was not under subpoena, however _ Whitewater independent
counsel Kenneth Starr had withdrawn it once the president agreed to
testify _ and so was not required to answer all questions. Yet he
did not resist on that ground. Instead, he made a broader claim
that the details of any sexual relationship were an unnecessary
intrusion by the prosecutor of his privacy rights.
</P>
<P>
   But legal experts said that if Clinton is forced to appear
before the grand jury under subpoena, that would quickly alter the
ground rules and oblige Clinton to provide the answers he declined
to give Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``In effect, you've got to tell them everything,'' Kamisar said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's lawyers may challenge any subpoena, arguing that under
the concept of separation of powers, the president, unlike any
other citizen, is immune to subpoenas.
</P>
<P>
   Kamisar said that he is unaware of any instances in which a
court allowed a witness to avoid answering questions on privacy
grounds. He said it would be a novel, ``even far-out strategy.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Nathan Lewin, a Washington lawyer who first publicly suggested
in an op-ed article in The New York Times that Clinton could resist
questions about the details of sexual events, said he still
believes there is a zone of privacy that may be used to block
prosecutors' questions. But even Lewin said he no longer believes
that would be appropriate for Clinton to do, because he has made
the details themselves an issue.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech Monday night, Clinton said that his answers during
a Jan. 17 deposition taken in the Paula Jones sexual misconduct
suit were ``legally accurate'' although they may have been
misleading. Clinton denied then that he had engaged in ``sexual
relations'' with Ms. Lewinsky, apparently relying on a definition
of sexual relations used that day that could be interpreted to
exclude their specific sex acts.
</P>
<P>
   Lewin, who said he had not discussed the issue with Clinton's
lawyers, argued that by relying on such specific wording issues as
to what constitutes sexual relations, ``it would be perfectly
reasonable for the prosecutors to ask Clinton about the details.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's careful explanation both before the grand jury and the
public of his denial of ``sexual relations'' was apparently
designed to avoid a perjury charge. There are many court cases
which establish the notion that one may mislead without committing
perjury.
</P>
<P>
   A 1973 Supreme Court case that has been cited many times by
lower courts established the premise that the burden is on the
questioner to pin down the details of a response and that a vague
or evasive answer is not necessarily perjury.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem that comes from Clinton's acknowledgment of a
sexual relationship with Ms. Lewinsky is how he squares that with
another statement he made on Jan. 17. In that statement he said
that he does not remember ever being alone with her except for
brief moments when she might have delivered documents in her role
as a White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   How can he acknowledge sexual contact with her but not remember
whether he was alone with her? Courts have increasingly held that
saying ``I can't remember'' does not necessarily end the inquiry
into whether perjury occurred.

PROMINENT DEMOCRATS ARE UNHAPPY WITH CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Prominent congressional Democrats, including some
of President Clinton's most loyal supporters, distanced themselves
from the president Tuesday and expressed deep disappointment in his
relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats said they were concerned that the Lewinsky matter
would impair Clinton's credibility and undermine his remaining two
years and five months in office. With the midterm elections some 10
weeks away, they were also worried that the president's
acknowledgement would upend the political terrain in dangerous and
unpredictable ways.
</P>
<P>
   Among the sharpest remarks were from Sen. Dianne Feinstein of
California, a longtime ally of Clinton who was described as even
more angry than her statement reflected. ``I was present in the
Roosevelt Room in January when the president categorically denied
any sexual involvement with Monica Lewinsky,'' she said. ``I
believed him. His remarks last evening leave me with a deep sense
of sadness in that my trust in his credibility has been badly
shattered.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the party's congressional leadership scolded the president.
House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt said, ``I cannot condone the
relationship the president has acknowledged and am very
disappointed in his personal conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   And Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle said that while the
president gave ``a more complete explanation of his relationship
with Monica Lewinsky,'' the senator was ``disappointed he did not
do so earlier.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the few prominent Democrats who put forth a virtually
unqualified defense of Clinton was Vice President Al Gore, who is
vacationing for two weeks in Hawaii and declared Tuesday night, ``I
am proud of him because he is a great president.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats around the country said that it was too early to tell
whether fallout from the scandal would diminish the party's
prospects in November.
</P>
<P>
   Several Democrats said they were grasping at findings in the
preliminary, and often unreliable, overnight polls that showed that
Clinton's job approval rating remained strong.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday morning, Clinton spoke by telephone to about a dozen
Democratic members of Congress, many of whom were described as
reassuring the president, according to White House aides.
</P>
<P>
   But White House officials said it was too early to know just how
Clinton's revelation Monday would be received by the public. ``As
far as the impact on voting patterns, it's too early to tell,''
said a senior presidential aide, speaking on condition of
anonymity. ``My gut tells me that we need to give it another
Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday. Candidates are going to do what's
in their interests to do. They'll wrap their arms around us _ or
they'll distance themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats also voiced concern that Clinton was not
sufficiently contrite in his public address after he testified
before a grand jury Monday, and they expressed fears that his
defiant remarks about the investigation by Independent Counsel
Kenneth Starr were a political miscalculation because they will
only agitate Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it would have been better had he left any reference
to the independent counsel out of his remarks,'' said Sen. John
Breaux, D-La., who is close to Clinton. ``But his admission that he
was solely and completely responsible was the right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., whom Clinton considered as his
running mate in 1992, said, ``I think the American people would
have liked to see the president not only admit his mistake but also
apologize. He misled the American people repeatedly, he misled his
own staff. I think the people expected an apology there. And I
expected one, frankly.''
</P>
<P>
   And Rep. Paul McHale, D-Pa., who is retiring, went as far as to
call on Clinton to resign. ``This is no longer a question of
private morality or political popularity,'' he said. ``Certainly,
we could spare the country a great deal of pain by abandoning the
rule of law. That's too high a price. With great sadness, I have
concluded that president should resign or face impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton hoped Monday's events would finally put the matter
to rest, Republicans around the country vowed to press on, and many
argued that the president's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky was not
a private matter but raised important moral issues that should be
openly discussed.
</P>
<P>
   ``While I welcome the president's statement, and hope that it
hastens the conclusion of this tawdry matter, I believe the
behavior he engaged in was deplorable,'' asserted Sen. John Chafee,
R-R.I., a moderate who has often voted in support of Clinton. ``I
do not agree with those who dismiss the significance of this affair
as being only about private matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Chafee went on to assert: ``This is a question about leadership,
not merely about legalities. This pattern has diminished the moral
authority the president needs if our nation is to confront
successfully such issues as the solvency of Social Security and
Medicare, the Asian debt crisis and America's overall leadership in
the world.''

TREASURY PRICES FALL ON FEAR THAT INFLATION COULD PICK UP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs to correct day in lede to Tuesday)  (bl) 
 By ROBERT HURTADO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Prices of Treasury securities fell Tuesday after a
smaller-than-expected trade deficit in June suggested that economic
growth was quickening. The news raised concern among some investors
that inflation could accelerate in the near term.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, market participants were focusing on the dollar, a
Treasury bill auction of new one-year bills and a separate report
on consumer prices.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the benchmark 30-year bond rose 6/32, to 99 7/32.
The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the
price, slipped to 5.55 percent from 5.54 percent Monday.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, Federal Reserve policy-makers left interest rates
unchanged at the end of their meeting Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Federal Reserve adhered to an unchanged monetary policy in
light of the perceived counterbalance between a slackening economic
advance, benign inflation environment, budget surplus and continued
fragility in overseas financial markets on one hand,'' said Donald
Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management, ``and robust
consumer spending and torrid housing activity on the other.''
</P>
<P>
   The dollar fell against the yen as Japanese officials said they
were ready to take action to bolster the currency. A weak dollar
makes dollar-denominated investments like Treasury securities less
attractive to foreign investors. Stocks in the United States also
gained for the second consecutive day, and that also eased some of
the flight to quality into the debt market.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the Treasury market, traders said the sale of a new
one-year bill Tuesday went off without a hitch, with the average
rate at 5 percent, the lowest since 4.965 percent on Jan. 29.

WIDOW TO KEEP $20M OF CONTESTED JACKPOT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILLIAM F. DOHERTY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It's official: Variety store owner Nick Havan may not
have hit the $21 million Mass Millions lottery jackpot last
February, but he got a $1 million payoff just for his persistence.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Paraskeve Kantges, the 72-year-old Watertown widow who
picked the winning numbers, was formally declared the winner of the
jackpot after Havan, the owner of a store where she bought the
winning ticket, withdrew his claim to the prize.
</P>
<P>
   But it also was announced that Kantges has agreed to share part
of the jackpot with Havan, who insisted he bought the winning
ticket after Kantges changed her mind and canceled the bet.
</P>
<P>
   Havan's lawyer, Laurence Johnson, said Kantges and Havan have
agreed to ``apportion'' the winnings and keep the details secret.
</P>
<P>
   But a source familiar with the settlement said Havan will get $1
million before taxes, less than 5 percent of Kantges's total
jackpot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a relatively small amount to make him just go away,'' the
source said. ``She is elderly and she wants to enjoy her winnings
while she can. She did the prudent thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The settlement brings to an end a six-month controversy over who
was entitled to the winnings, a dispute which could have dragged on
for years in the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Treasurer Joseph Malone said Kantges will get her first check in
a matter of days. ``Any side agreement she may have (with Havan) is
up to her,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The payment, about $704,000, will be the the first of 20 checks
issued to Kantges each year.
</P>
<P>
   Malone said he was ``delighted'' that Kanges was declared the
winner. ``Her story held together from day one, backed up by the
facts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Havan also appeared delighted Tuesday at his store, Coolidge
Provisions. He offered to buy a round of sodas for reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone want a drink?'' he asked gesturing toward the shelves.
``I can buy plenty of drinks now.''
</P>
<P>
   But Havan declined to say how much money he will get or what he
intends to do with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no comment,'' he said. ``I want to want to live like a
normal store owner and go on with my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Kantges, who will be 73 in October, could not be reached
Tuesday. Her lawyer, James Merberg, declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers in the case are expected to ask a Superior Court judge
to dissolve an injunction Kantges obtained in February, barring the
lottery from paying the winnings until the dispute was resolved.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement, reached Aug. 7, became public Tuesday after
retired Superior Court Judge Robert Steadman, who presided at the
Lottery Commission hearing last month, filed his recommendations
</P>
<P>
   Steadman told the commission it should reject the claim of a
third person, Sonya Bardakjian of Watertown, and award Kantges the
jackpot. The commission adopted his recommendations at a meeting
Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Kantges claimed she phoned in the winning Mass Millions bet to
Havan on Feb. 5, along with 95 other bets. But when she went to
pick up her tickets at Coolidge Provisions the next day, the
winning ticket was not among the pile.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like the legs had been cut out from under me,'' Kantges
testified at the July hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Havan claimed that Kantges had called back the night before the
drawing and canceled that bet, so he kept the ticket for himself.
</P>
<P>
   Kantges has records showing that she has played the winning
combination, 4-6-10-16-19-25, for years. She said the number
signifies her birth, at 4 a.m. on the sixth day of the week Oct.
16, 1925. She maintains she never canceled the winning bet.
</P>
<P>
   A longtime lottery player, Kantges has admitted she ran up a
$3,000 tab for lottery tickets at another Watertown store and quit
making payments after reducing her debt to $2,000. Watertown
officials also say she owes $10,000 in unpaid property taxes on her
condo.
</P>
<P>
   Bardakjian, the third claimant, gave the same story as Kantges.
She said she phoned in a bet on the winning number to Coolidge
Provisions along with 36 other bets Feb. 5, and that the next day
Havan gave her all the tickets except the winning one.
</P>
<P>
   But Steadman said a review of all Bardakjian's bets that day
established that she never played the winning number. She had
presented the lottery commission with 25 tickets and the corner of
a 26th ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Havan's license to sell lottery tickets was suspended when the
dispute erupted. Malone said that action might be reviewed ``down
the road.''

U.S. PRESSING AFGHANISTAN TO EXPEL BOMBING SUSPECT 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also AFRICA-BOMBING) 
(JT) 
 By PHILIP SHENON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAIROBI, Kenya _ The United States is urging the Taliban militia
in Afghanistan to expel a Saudi-born multimillionaire from the
country in hopes that he can be captured as a suspect in the
bombing of American embassies in East Africa, senior Clinton
administration officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright came close to making the
request public when she described the views of the man, Osama bin
Laden, as ``inimical to those of the civilized world'' and called
on Afghanistan to ``stop harboring those considered terrorists.''
</P>
<P>
   The State Department has called bin Laden ``one of the most
significant financial sponsors of Islamic extremist activities in
the world.'' American officials say he has sponsored terrorist acts
and militant groups around the world, from Algeria to the
Philippines. And a suspect in the twin embassy bombings, on Aug. 7,
has reportedly identified him as the mastermind of the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   He has threatened to strike American sites in and around the
Middle East and has applauded the bombings of American military
posts in Saudi Arabia in 1995 and 1996, which killed a total of 24
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Albright's comments came at the end of a whirlwind two-day trip
to Africa to tour the shattered embassies here and in Dar es
Salaam, Tanzania. The Kenyan police and FBI were continuing their
interrogation of the suspect who has reportedly linked bin Laden to
the embassy bombings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a war _ that's what it looks like,'' Albright said as she
wandered the charred rubble of the embassy complex in Nairobi,
drawing a comparison to her childhood during the Nazi blitz of
London, where her family had fled from Czechoslovakia. ``As
somebody who actually saw the bombs in London during the war,'' she
said, ``this is what it looks like.''
</P>
<P>
   While refusing at a news conference here to say directly that
bin Laden was a suspect in the bombing investigation, Albright had
no hesitation in offering a blunt public condemnation of the
shadowy Saudi millionaire, who has bragged of offering financial
support to terrorists who target Americans abroad.
</P>
<P>
   And she seemed eager to suggest that the Taliban, the
fundamentalist Muslim militia that controls most of Afghanistan and
is eager for American diplomatic recognition as its rightful
government, has no hope for formal ties to the United States unless
it expels bin Laden, who is reported to live in the war-ruined
Afghan city of Kandahar.
</P>
<P>
   `` Bin Laden's activities are inimical to those of civilized
people in the world and in the United States,'' she said. ``And
whatever the connection to this, I have said previously that his
funding of terrorism is something that the world is quite aware
of.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that if the Taliban wanted diplomatic relations with
the United States and other nations, ``it should not be in the
position of harboring any of those who are considered terrorists.''
Asked at the news conference specifically whether she wanted to see
bin Laden expelled from Afghanistan, Albright replied, ``I'm not
going to go into further details.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials have said that during a meeting
in Afghanistan with senior Taliban leaders last April, Bill
Richardson, the U.S. delegate to the United Nations, suggested that
the United States would not consider diplomatic relations of any
sort with the Taliban unless bin Laden were forced out of the
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can get bin Laden out of Afghanistan, our hopes of
bringing him to justice increase exponentially,'' a senior
administration official said Tuesday in Washington. Officials said
the United States would also require a dramatic improvement in the
human rights record of the Taliban, especially in its treatment of
women, if it wants diplomatic ties.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   American law enforcement officials have said that the suspect
who is now being held in Kenya, Mohammed Saddiq Odeh, appears to
have been an important figure in the Nairobi bomb plot and has
knowledge of most of the details of the attack, which killed more
than 200 people.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistani officials have said that he acknowledged participation
in the bombing when he was arrested shortly after landing in
Karachi on a flight from Kenya only hours after the bombings.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials in the United States have not disputed
reports from Pakistan that Odeh voluntarily confessed there and
that he had called bin Laden his spiritual guide in an Islamic holy
war against the United States. A prominent Pakistani newspaper, The
News, has reported that Odeh is a 34-year-old Palestinian engineer
who is married to a Kenyan and who described bin Laden as his
``supreme commander.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright would not comment on the arrest of Odeh. But after
meeting with senior FBI officials who are overseeing the criminal
inquiry here, she said that ``the investigation is proceeding
fairly well'' and that American, Kenyan and Tanzanian law
enforcement officials were cooperating closely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Together we pledge to bring to justice the murderers of our
loved ones, colleagues and friends,'' she said before laying a
wreath before the blackened hulk of the American Embassy in
Nairobi, a place she described Tuesday as ``a sorrowful and now
sacred location.''
</P>
<P>
   In her public appearances Tuesday, Albright struggled to end the
perception among many Kenyans and Tanzanians that American
officials were indifferent to the plight of all but the American
citizens who were injured in the bombings. The perception was
reinforced by news reports in Kenya that rescuers who had tried to
save people from the shattered embassy here minutes after the blast
were chased away by machine-gun-wielding marines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there's anger about what happened in the aftermath of
the bombing,'' Albright said. ``And I cannot say we acted
perfectly. But I believe the allegations of callousness are
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that the ``U.S. Marines limited access to the embassy
not out of indifference but because they were afraid that the
weakened building would collapse and trap new victims.''

cross, and she can't do it, and she can't even see that she can't
do it. She has a poor grasp of size, time and numbers. She veers
wildly from being impatient, uninterested and unable to concentrate
on anything for more than a moment to suddenly focusing in on a
task, like feeding a barnacle at the local aquarium, to the
sustained exclusion of anything around her.
</P>
<P>
   Heidi has Williams syndrome, a rare genetic condition that
leaves people, in the words of Dr. Oliver Sacks, with ``a curious
contrast of abilities and disabilities'': social gracefulness and
musicality mixed with extreme spatial, numerical and other
cognitive deficiencies.
</P>
<P>
   Their faces are distinctive, too, elfin and elastic: Jim Carrey
as a Cabbage Patch doll. They look and act more like one another
than they do like ``normal'' people, and they know it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people stare at me,'' a boy with Williams syndrome tells
Sacks, ``I feel like a weird medical specimen.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet here we are, the television multitude, staring at the boy
and his fellows in utter fascination, wanting to hear more about
Williams syndrome, to watch it in action. We are equally enthralled
by the other stories in the four-part PBS series called ``Oliver
Sacks: The Mind Traveler,'' which begins Tuesday at 8 P.M. _
stories of people with autism or total color-blindness or Usher's
syndrome, another rare genetic condition, in which a person is born
deaf and then gradually goes blind in young adulthood.
</P>
<P>
   We are enthralled partly because Sacks, the world's most famous
literary neurologist, is a gifted and compassionate tour guide, who
never takes the pat route and who tirelessly flings out new ideas
and angles on his topics.
</P>
<P>
   But in truth, we are also fascinated because the medical
conditions he describes, in his many best-selling books as well as
in the PBS series, are so, yes, weird. We like weird; we always
have. Doctors even have a term for a condition that is weird enough
to be frankly fascinating: a fascinoma.
</P>
<P>
   So it is fair to ask, as we watch Heidi fumble with her toy
blocks or Jessica Park, an autistic artist who paints somber,
uninhabited houses, explode in rage at her interviewer, what are we
looking at, anyway? How is what we are doing different from going
to a circus sideshow to gawk at Siamese twins and hermaphrodites?
And if there is an element of voyeurism to Sacks' appeal, is that
necessarily bad?
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think there is something of the old-style freak show'' in
Sacks' work, said Dr. Alice Dreger, a medical historian at Michigan
State University who has written about public perceptions of
disabilities. ``By that I mean it involves the exhibitor as a
willing participant. People obviously enjoy telling their
fascinomas to Sacks.'' And with his insight and his artistry, she
adds, ``he turns their story into something extraordinarily
beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   In one sense, Sacks' mining of life's aberrations follows
standard scientific protocol. Biologists can learn how things work
only by seeing what happens when they go wrong, or when they at
least stray from the opacity of the norm.
</P>
<P>
   Hippocrates, Galen, Aristotle and other early men of medicine
all described in considerable detail a host of human and animal
deformities, the better to elucidate by contrast the dimensions and
performance of the triumphant average. Today, cell biologists study
cancer cells to understand normal cell growth, and brain
researchers rely on patients with head injuries or hereditary
neurological disorders to give them windows on the brain. Case
studies are also enormously useful in explaining science and
medicine to a large audience.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Sacks' goal has never been straight didacticism, and he is
not a conventional science writer. He doesn't use his subjects as a
springboard for a course in basic neural anatomy or human genetics.
</P>
<P>
   The hourlong segment on Usher's syndrome, for example, doesn't
bother theorizing about why the gene for the disease causes
deafness first and blindness later. Instead, Sacks spends most of
his time delving into the humanity of his characters, their
specificity.
</P>
<P>
   Would Danny Delcambre, who is fast losing his sight to Usher's,
want it back if he could have it? Yes, most certainly. He was born
deaf, but would he want hearing if it could be given to him? ``No.
I'm a deaf person. I like a quiet world.''
</P>
<P>
   What exactly does Knut Nordby, who is stricken by a rare and
complete color-blindness called achromatopsia, see when he looks at
an ancient stone temple or a pair of loud striped socks? All of
which makes Sacks' stories that much more irresistible, but also
takes away the old cod-liver-oil excuse for liking him: ``I learn
so much about science!''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Sacks doesn't stop at telling stories. He also
engages in a kind of cerebral yoga, asking questions about the deep
meaning of the conditions he describes. If you lose your ability to
perceive the world through ear and eye, can life be properly
narrated through touch? What is the link between color and emotion?
</P>
<P>
   He forces his audience to identify with the people he portrays,
to parse themselves and find the threads of autism, confusion and
blind-sight within; alternatively, he makes his audience wistful,
realizing that the people on the syndromic outposts possess
perspectives and talents _ the genius of necessity _ that those on
the lazy hump of the bell curve utterly lack.
</P>
<P>
   Such empathy, though, can go only so far. In the end, many
viewers may feel quietly grateful that they are not the subjects
portrayed: They're not going blind. They're not trapped in an
obsessive fixation on electrical outlets.
</P>
<P>
   In that sense, too, Sacks' work may echo the appeal of the
sideshow or even the horror film: you encounter anomalous people,
immerse yourself in their predicament, thrill to the extremity of
it and its intimations of helplessness, loss, sorrow, death _ and
then walk away.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all live with fears about bodily integrity, about being
disfigured and becoming hideous,'' said David A. Gerber, professor
of history at the State University of New York in Buffalo, who has
studied the images of the disabled in American films. ``One of the
ways to deal with those fears is to live them at a remove. That's
part of the psychological attraction of freak shows and horror
movies. They allow us to act out dangers to our physical integrity
and security without having to experience them.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Sacks' philosophical bent, his effort to divine the subtext
or revelatory gist of a syndrome like autism or Tourette's, harks
back to an ancient practice, that of ascribing profound symbolic or
religious significance to the oddities among us.
</P>
<P>
   In the Middle Ages, the deformed were seen as examples of either
God's wrath or the glorification of His power. Dwarfs kept company
with princes; hermaphrodites were considered seers. In a not
dissimilar vein, Sacks asks the question about Williams syndrome:
``Should we try to force them into our own categories or see them
as unique, distinctive forms of life?''
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps what should be questioned, in exploring the sum of
Sacks' allure, is whether one species of curiosity is purer or more
tasteful than another. Not long ago, I wrote an article about
conjoined, or Siamese, twins and the debate over whether separation
surgery was always the best course.
</P>
<P>
   In reporting the article, I met with Lori and Reba Schappell,
sisters in their mid-30s who are joined at the head. I felt
justified, almost smug, in my use of them for the story. I wasn't
exploiting their condition for its lurid value, I told myself; I
was giving the Schappells a chance to have their say about wanting
to stay conjoined.
</P>
<P>
   The three of us walked around a Pennsylvania shopping mall and
ate lunch at Ruby Tuesday's. Everybody we passed stared, jaws
practically agape. And I remember thinking: ``Don't these people
have any manners? Do they think they're at the circus? How can they
be so cruel?''
</P>
<P>
   But when I later talked about my experience with Dr. Dreger, who
has written about conjoined twins, she pointed out that part of why
people stared was to try to make sense of what they were seeing,
which admittedly wasn't obvious on first glance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The brain is used to categorizing, and when something doesn't
fit any of the day-to-day boxes, you pause,'' she said. ``There's a
wonderful rush in that, of being alive. It's like seeing an
incredibly beautiful painting, or something completely new. It's
interesting; it's exciting; it's literally mind-blowing _ it blows
up the mind, it expands it.''
</P>
<P>
   In his restless quest to understand the Other, that rebel box
whose lid will not stay shut, Sacks makes the alien familiar and
the familiar new, and if we thrill at the sight of a stranger, that
is surely better than to turn away in revulsion or fear.

 By EDWARD WYATT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For the second time in a year, mutual funds that
invest in emerging markets have been snared in a foreign financial
crisis. And once again, their managers are trying to value
securities for which there is little, or in some cases no, real
market.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Russian securities are at issue. So far, the Russian
government has provided almost no information to help portfolio
managers gauge how much their investments are worth.
</P>
<P>
   That has left some mutual fund managers to place widely
different values on their Russian securities, possibly skewing the
real impact of Russia's decision on Monday to allow its currency to
fall in value and to call a debt moratorium. The full report may be
yet to come for investors, who have been pulling money out of
emerging-market debt and equity funds in recent weeks, according to
AMG Data Services, which tracks mutual fund cash flows.
</P>
<P>
   This is the third time in five years that investors in
emerging-market funds have been stunned by upheaval in what had
been a rapidly growing economy. In addition to a decline brought on
by a devaluation of certain currencies in Southeast Asia last year,
emerging-market funds plunged in late 1994 after Mexico devalued
the peso, leading to a tumble in most Latin American stock and bond
funds.
</P>
<P>
   The uncertainty is greatest now in portfolios that hold
short-term Russian government notes, known as GKOs. After the
Russian government decided on Monday to restructure the notes and
to allow the ruble to fall by as much as 34 percent in value, the
T. Rowe Price Emerging Markets Bond fund cut about 15 percent from
the market value of its Russian Treasury bills.
</P>
<P>
   That was only half the decline recorded by the Lexington Troika
Dialog Russia fund, which reduced the value of its GKO investments
by about one-third.
</P>
<P>
   Each fund could only estimate the value of these holdings at the
end of each day because the securities are not trading while the
Russian government irons out the details of a debt-restructuring
plan.
</P>
<P>
   The uncertainty is not likely to clear up soon. On Tuesday,
Russia said it would delay a debt announcement, originally planned
for Wednesday, until Monday. It is expected to convert the
short-term holdings, which were due to be redeemed by the end of
next year, into long-term bonds that are redeemed over the next
four or five years, fund managers say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with the restructuring is that we don't know what
we are going to get,'' said Michael Conelius, manager of the T.
Rowe Price fund. ``If we get ruble-denominated debt, that would be
negative,'' because fund managers would then be selling rubles to
hedge their currency risk, perhaps leading to a collapse in the
currency's value.
</P>
<P>
   If, however, the three-month GKOs are exchanged for five-year,
dollar-denominated Treasury bonds, Conelius said, ``the question
becomes how comfortable are we holding the longer-term bonds.''
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Bank AG, J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co. and Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co. have
been approached by the Russian government to provide advice as it
restructures its debt.
</P>
<P>
   Emerging markets traders and bankers said Tuesday that there had
been speculation that the Russian government would pay foreign
investors about eleven cents on the dollar for their GKOs, while
domestic investors would receive about 32 cents on the dollar. If
foreign investors wind up swallowing larger losses on the
securities than domestic investors, they will undoubtedly be
reluctant to reinvest in Russia anytime soon.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Many emerging-market debt funds that have invested in Russia
hold long-term government bonds, which are denominated in dollars
rather than rubles. Unlike the GKOs, these bonds have continued to
trade over the last two days, and have fallen sharply in value.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bonds that were priced at 30 cents on the dollar on Friday
fell to 25 cents on Monday and about 21 cents today,'' Craig Monro,
manager of the AIM Global High Income fund, said Tuesday. In April,
when Russian investments accounted for about 18 percent of the AIM
fund's $354 million in assets, the bonds were valued at 64 cents on
the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bonds have been trading, but certainly the liquidity is
nothing like it was a few weeks ago,'' Monro said. ``A lot of fund
managers are apparently being told to exit the market. This is a
classic end-of-a-meltdown phase we are going through.'' At least
for now, the AIM fund is holding onto its Russian bonds, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Emerging market funds that buy debt have suffered far more in
the Russian economic upheaval than funds that buy equities. Last
October, the Asian turmoil mainly dealt blows to investors in
emerging-market stock funds.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the biggest emerging-market debt funds declined in
value by 5.5 percent to 8 percent, according to Lipper Analytical
Services. Emerging-market equity funds declined by 0.5 percent to
3.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The big exception was the Lexington Troika Dialog Russia fund,
primarily a stock fund, which reported a decline of a whopping 13.5
percent that day. The fund, which already had fallen 72 percent
from the beginning of the year through Friday, plunged because
about 10 percent of its $30 million in assets are in short-term
Russian government notes.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Kantor, a spokesman for Lexington Asset Management,
said Lexington devalued the notes by about one-third on Monday to
conform to the lower end of the new trading range for the ruble.
</P>
<P>
   The T. Rowe Price fund took a different approach. Conelius said
the fund priced its GKO securities on Monday to yield about 220
percent, up from 150 percent on Friday. That resulted, he said, in
a 15 percent decline in the market value of the notes.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was consistent with the market for dollar-paying external
debt,'' he said, where ``everything went down Tuesday by 10 to 20
percent. Fifteen percent seemed prudent and seemed right.''
</P>
<P>
   Fund managers should be better able to determine the long-term
value of their investments after details of the restructuring are
announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement will also help banks gauge the value of their
portfolios. Even a complete writeoff would not be overly damaging
to the big U.S. commercial banks because they have limited Russian
exposure. BankAmerica Corp., for example, had about $668 million in
loans or investments in Russia at the end of June, an undisclosed
portion in GKOs. Chase Manhattan Corp. has less than $1 billion in
exposure to Russia.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, investors will remain skittish. According to
AMG Data Services, they withdrew an average of $4 million a week
over the past month from emerging-market debt funds. That was
before those funds lost an average of 8 percent of their value in
the week ended last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Withdrawals have been greater from emerging-market stock funds,
whose declines have been all the more striking as the U.S. stock
market has surged ahead. Over the past month, investors have taken
$90 million a week out of the stock funds, AMG said.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Rep. Charles Schumer turned up at a center for
the elderly in central Harlem Tuesday, he discovered more
television cameras crammed in one small room than he had seen
before during his entire campaign for Senate. The Brooklyn Democrat
read a brief statement attacking Republican policies on Medicare,
and then gestured to his audience of reporters and elderly New
Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's see, does anybody have any questions, any senior or any
of the press, on this subject?'' Schumer inquired. There was
silence. ``You didn't come here to hear my talk about Newt?''
</P>
<P>
   They did not. For the next two minutes, before the normally
camera-friendly lawmaker hustled his way out the door and to his
car, Schumer fielded questions not about Republicans and Medicare
but about about President Clinton and Monica Lewinsky and how that
issue might affect the Democratic race to unseat Sen. Alfonse M.
D'Amato, the New York Republican seeking a fourth term.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the president did was irresponsible and wrong,'' Schumer
said, in one variation of what he promised would be his ``one
statement'' on the matter. ``He apologized for it. He said he wants
to move on, and I agree with that, and start talking about issues
that are of great concern.''
</P>
<P>
   With obvious nervousness and uncertainty, the same Democratic
candidates for governor and the Senate from New York who had voiced
strong support for Clinton just two weeks ago moved to distance
themselves from the White House Tuesday. Faced with a politically
volatile situation in Washington just as their campaigns were
getting engaged in New York, the candidates expressed varying
degrees of disappointment with Clinton's behavior, and expressed
hopes that voters could move beyond the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was disappointed by his relationship with Monica Lewinsky,''
said Geraldine Ferraro, one of Schumer's rivals for the Democratic
nomination. ``And I was also disappointed by the fact that he
misled the public. But since he apologized, I think we should all
move on. Enough, already.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Green, the third contender for the Senate, described
Clinton, whom he has repeatedly called ``a friend,'' as an ``almost
always disciplined leader who made an obviously foolish personal
mistake, for which he and, in a sense, the country is now paying a
price.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Democrats and Republicans alike rained shame on
President Clinton Tuesday for his belated confession of sexual
misconduct and his defiant tone, as senior White House officials
tried to regroup in the face of what some privately said was a
betrayal by the president they had blindly defended.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr's
investigation steamed ahead, despite Clinton's pointed pleas for
closure. Former White House intern Monica W. Lewinsky has been
summoned back before the grand jury Thursday, according to an
associate familiar with the process. And former Clinton consultant
Dick Morris appeared before the panel Tuesday to discuss telephone
conversations with the president dating back to January.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, after spending all of Monday in his residence, arrived
in the Oval Office Tuesday morning for a lengthy briefing with his
senior policy advisers on issues ranging from Northern Ireland to
the Russian economy to East Africa. He met privately with some
political aides in an attempt to soothe feelings, and made about a
dozen calls to key senators and House members who were spread
across the country and the world on their summer holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the afternoon, Clinton, accompanied by his wife Hillary
and daughter Chelsea, boarded Marine One on their way to their
belated Martha's Vineyard vacation. Twice _ at the doorway of the
helicopter and again on the steps of Air Force One _ Clinton's hand
grazed his wife's back, but the two seemed barely to acknowledge
one another.
</P>
<P>
   In the White House, on Capitol Hill and around the nation,
opinions were mixed and slow to form on the ultimate impact of
Clinton's extraordinary five-minute address from the Map Room
Monday night, during which he admitted an inappropriate
relationship with Lewinsky, struck back at Starr and pleaded for
his privacy.
</P>
<P>
   In one public opinion poll, sponsored by CNN and USA Today,
Clinton's favorability rating plummeted 20 percentage points after
the speech, to 40 percent. In an ABC News poll, 52 percent of the
respondents said they did not believe Clinton when he said he did
not obstruct justice in the Paula Jones sexual harassment suit.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in the ABC poll, 59 percent of those interviewed said
Clinton had said enough about the situation, and another 53 percent
in the CNN/USA Today poll said they were satisfied with Clinton's
explanation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's a reaction, it will be a slow burn,'' said Richard
Neustadt, a presidential scholar at Harvard University. ``We're not
going to know tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   In one focus group conducted by Democratic pollster Peter Hart
during the speech, respondents registered strong approval when
Clinton accepted responsibility for his actions and sounded a note
of contrition. But when Clinton talked about Starr, the focus group
members registered disapproval.
</P>
<P>
   ``They already have an opinion of Ken Starr,'' Hart said
Tuesday. ``Those things that didn't relate to the president
himself, his family and his relationship with the public, they
thought that was outside the bounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Senior advisers inside and outside the White House, as well as
Democratic allies, expressed frustration with Clinton's tone in the
speech. Several said they had tried to mute his defiance, but were
overruled by Clinton and his wife in a climactic meeting Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
   In the speech, Clinton railed against the length and scope of
the investigation, saying, ``This has gone on too long, cost too
much and hurt too many innocent people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Was he right about the independent counsel? I think so,'' said
Mark Mellman, a Democratic consultant with ties to the White House.
``I don't know if anyone thinks the country was better off with
what Starr does. Tactically, was it smart? I'm not sure, but it was
heartfelt.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Representative Barney Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat:
``The criticism of Starr was intellectually legitimate, though not
tactically wise.''
</P>
<P>
   A few Republicans, led by former Vice President Dan Quayle;
Senator John Ashcroft of Missouri, a presidential aspirant; and
Senator Bob Smith of New Hampshire, called on Clinton to resign
Tuesday. Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, the House majority
whip, became the most senior lawmaker to call for the president's
resignation.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, House Speaker Newt Gingrich staked out a more
moderate position. ``It's premature for anyone to make any
judgment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Democratic opinion that White House officials likely
found the most disturbing. Throughout the seven-month probe, House
Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde of Illinois and Senate
Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch said Congress could not
seek impeachment without Democratic support, and some of that
support seemed to waver Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was present in the Roosevelt Room in January when the
president denied any sexual involvement with Monica Lewinsky,''
Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein of California said in a written
statement. ``I believed him. His remarks last evening leave me with
a deep sense of sadness in that my trust in his crediblity has been
badly shattered. My heart and thoughts go out to the First Lady and
Chelsea.''
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt said he was ``very
disappointed in his personal conduct.'' And Democratic
Representative Paul McHale of Pennsylvania said Clinton ``should
resign or face impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   In the White House, some advisers were still taking stock of the
situation. Asked if he had come to terms with Clinton's reversal,
press secretary Michael McCurry replied: ``No. I'll think about it
over the next couple of days.''
</P>
<P>
   White House communications director Ann Lewis, one of Clinton's
most vocal defenders since January, abruptly said, ``I'm not
getting into it,'' when asked whether she felt betrayed by the
president.
</P>
<P>
   Others, though, were more conciliatory. Deputy chief of staff
John Podesta said he privately told Clinton that he would continue
his admiration and respect for the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough deal,'' said Podesta. ``I felt badly for him. He
had a tough job to do and he did it. He talked to the American
people and we'll move on.''

<P>
   EDGARTOWN, Mass. _ Seeking solitude and a respite from the most
wrenching experience of his political life, President Clinton
departed Washington on Tuesday for a twelve-day vacation on the
resort island of Martha's Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who Monday evening made a combative admission of an
illicit relationship with a former White House intern, Monica
Lewinsky, strode from the White House in mid-afternoon clutching
the hand of his 18-year-old daughter, Chelsea. Chelsea, in turn,
was holding hands with her mother, First Lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton. Their Labrador, Buddy, bounded up the stairs of the
presidential helicopter before them.
</P>
<P>
   The televised tableau of family togetherness was designed to
convey a sense of an embattled family rallying together in one of
the most difficult hours of a political career and a marriage that
have survived repeated crises brought on by Clinton's infidelity
and his parsimony with the truth. But never before Monday's painful
confessional has the president's behavior been laid so bare before
his family _ and the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a family that has some healing to do,'' said Mike
McCurry, the White House press secretary who accompanied the
Clintons on Air Force One to Martha's Vineyard. He said the
president's first priority on his vacation is to find the privacy
he needs ``so he can do some repair work within the family.'' After
that, McCurry said, the president will begin a series of public
appearances designed to regain some momentum for his stalled agenda
and to try to rebuild the trust of the American people.
</P>
<P>
   Marsha Berry, a spokeswoman for Mrs. Clinton, said that the
first lady is ``committed to her marriage and she loves her husband
and daughter very much.'' Ms. Berry said Mrs. Clinton's love for
her husband is ``compassionate and steadfast'' but that she is
uncomfortable with the public airing of the family's soiled linen.
</P>
<P>
   The White House did not release any details of the first
family's plans during their stay on Martha's Vineyard. Aides are
preparing a small, private celebration of Clinton's 52nd birthday
on Friday. They indicated that it would not be a lavish,
celebrity-drenched affair like those marking earlier presidential
birthdays, but they would not reveal more.
</P>
<P>
   Among those greeting Clinton at the Edgartown airport was Vernon
Jordan, the Washington lawyer and presidential confidant, who
enveloped Mrs. Clinton in an enormous bear hug when she stepped off
Air Force One. Clinton waited silently and alone a few paces away
as Mrs. Clinton and Jordan spoke, apparently unwilling to wade into
the crowd without his wife by his side.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan was one of the first witnesses called before a federal
grand jury investigating the relationship between Clinton and Ms.
Lewinsky. Jordan helped secure a job for Ms. Lewinsky at Revlon,
where he is a director, at a time when she was under subpoena to
testify in the Paula Jones sexual misconduct lawsuit against the
president. Jordan has said that his efforts on Ms. Lewinsky's
behalf were a personal favor and not an attempt to influence her
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Singer Carly Simon also appeared to greet the Clintons. Hundreds
of other supporters turned out to welcome the first family at the
Edgartown airport in a small-scale demonstration of support that
the Clintons obviously relished.
</P>
<P>
   The three Clintons _ with Chelsea in the lead _ shook hands with
members of the crowd for about 35 minutes before getting into their
car and heading to the borrowed home where they are staying here,
an Oyster Pond waterfront compound owned by Richard Friedman, a
Boston property developer. Their visit here was their fourth since
Clinton assumed the presidency in 1993. The president and Mrs.
Clinton worked the crowd together without speaking to one another
or touching.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spent part of the day before leaving Washington taking
calls from Democratic members of Congress, who urged the president
to try to put the Lewinsky matter behind him, aides said. The tone
of the talks, according to a White House official, was similar to
that of the president's Monday address _ regretful but determined
to continue to challenge the legitimacy of the investigation of the
Whitewater independent counsel, Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   McCurry said the President also spoke privately with several
members of the White House staff who have ardently defended him
against the charges of public and private wrongdoing that have
seized the presidency since January. Those aides were subdued on
Tuesday, stunned by the president's admission but hardly surprised
that what many in Washington suspected turned out to be true.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's some sense of relief'' that the waiting for Clinton to
speak on the affair had ended, McCurry said. ``People just want to
get on with why they came here.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   McCurry has already announced his departure from the White House
in October. Joe Lockhart, the deputy press secretary and McCurry's
designated successor, parroted the official line. ``People are
generally relieved that we got through the day yesterday and
they're glad it's over,'' Lockhart said. ``People are satisfied
with the speech.''
</P>
<P>
   Rahm Emanuel, one of the president's most aggressive defenders,
said that opinion varied among White House staff members about the
president's statement, but said that he is content with the
explanation of his actions that Clinton gave.
</P>
<P>
   ``My feeling about the person is the same as the feeling was
before,'' Emanuel said, his tone lacking the usual combative edge.
``I was raised that you don't walk on a man when he's down. He
acknowledged that he misled his wife. I don't need more than that.
Do you? He doesn't have to say he's sorry for misleading me.''
Emanuel also is planning to leave the White House this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of how political Washington and the American public
receive Clinton's grudging confession of personal sin, those who
turned out to welcome them to their island escape were supportive
and sympathetic. Ann Sherman, a Martha's Vineyard resident and
retired pediatric nurse, said she had never gone to the airport to
welcome Clinton but came this time to show her support.
</P>
<P>
   ''People feel a little sorry for him and his family and they
want to let him have a vacation here,'' she said. ``He looked very
terrible last night. He's been wrung through the ringer.'' Ms.
Sherman added, ``He has to set an example but we are human. He made
a very very bad mistake, but he's got to get back to running this
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Judy Feingold, a summer resident and a managed health-care
consultant from Boston, said she was ``embarrassed'' for the
president but wanted to show solidarity. ''One wants to show a
sense of respect for Hillary and Chelsea and take one's cue from
them,'' Ms. Feingold said. ``I can't expect it's going to be a
celebratory time.''

 &HT;    A Special News for Kids Report: President Clinton and the Monica
mess
 &HT;    By Julie Bookman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ All year long, you've seen headlines wondering whether
President Clinton had done something bad.
</P>
<P>
   What's all the fuss?
</P>
<P>
   In short, Clinton got himself in a mess of trouble. Personal
trouble. And for many months, he said, he misled everyone,
including his best friends and, it seems, his wife.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble: Clinton had a relationship with a young woman who
worked in the White House. They weren't just friends. They had the
sort of relationship that husbands and wives have. It was a
romantic relationship.
</P>
<P>
   The woman is named Monica Lewinsky. She's been on the covers of
magazines because of her friendship with the president. Lewinsky is
25 now, but was 21 and fresh out of college when she became
romantic with Clinton, who is now 52.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-January, when Clinton had to testify in a court case, he
reportedly said under oath that he did not have that sort of
relationship with Lewinsky. Ten days later, after his friendship
with Lewinsky became known, Clinton told some reporters: ``I did
not have ... relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky.''
</P>
<P>
   But on Monday night, seven months after he denied the
relationship with Lewinsky, Clinton changed his story.
</P>
<P>
   Looking very serious from his seat in the White House, he
addressed the nation. In a speech just more than four minutes long,
the president said: ``Indeed, I did have a relationship with Ms.
Lewinsky that was not appropriate. In fact, it was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   He admitted that he ``misled people'' to protect himself from
embarrassment and also to protect his family.
</P>
<P>
   According to reports, the president waited until last weekend to
tell his wife, Hillary, and daughter, Chelsea, the truth. Now the
family is on vacation on Martha's Vineyard, Mass., an island.
</P>
<P>
   Where does the story go from here? That's a question on many
minds right now.
</P>
<P>
   Some people think a president should be a model citizen _ the
best our country has to offer and a hero young people can look up
to. Before Lewinsky came along, some people think Clinton lied
about a romantic involvement with another woman. Some think that
Clinton should not be president.
</P>
<P>
   Others think that if he has lied about his personal life, that
isn't important. They say our nation should focus on more important
things, such as dealing with terrorist bombings in Africa and
nuclear weapons in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons will take their vacation, and reporters will
continue to cover this story. Still to be determined: Will the
nation forgive Clinton? Did he tell a lie in the court case in
January?
</P>
<P>
   Telling the truth
</P>
<P>
   Many parents and teachers have had a hard time trying to explain
this ``Monica mess'' to kids. It's because the whole story involves
adult situations. Think of it this way: If this story were a movie,
it would be rated ``R.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is one lesson in the Clinton-Lewinsky episode that
does seem to be coming through loud and clear: the importance of
telling the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Have you ever lied about something you did or didn't do at home
or at school? Have your parents or teachers urged you to tell the
truth? Have you ever found out that you get in less trouble when
you tell the truth right away instead of waiting until you are
caught telling a lie?
</P>
<P>
   After watching President Clinton's speech Monday night, Eric
Dobbs, 34, of DeKalb County talked about the matter with his
9-year-old son, Eric II. He wanted his son to see that it was
Clinton's decision to mislead people that landed him in so much
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him the thing we can learn from this is: Honesty is
always the best policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Glossary
</P>
<P>
   Here are some names and terms you might have heard in stories
about the president and Monica Lewinsky:
</P>
<P>
   _ Kenneth Starr: the man who is investigating President
Clinton's relationship with Lewinsky and other matters. He is
sometimes called a ``special prosecutor'' or an ``independent
counsel.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Perjury: a crime. When someone who has sworn to tell the truth
tells a lie. Some people think President Clinton committed perjury
in describing his friendship with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   _ Impeachment: part of a process of removing someone from
office. Some people say Clinton should be impeached if he committed
perjury. For a president to be removed, he must be impeached by the
U.S. House of Representatives and convicted by the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   _ Grand jury: a group of people who decide whether a person
should be tried for a crime. Before his speech to the nation on
Monday, President Clinton answered questions in front of a grand
jury.

 &HT;    Falcons' No. 4 QB faces long odds
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ John Dutton finds himself on the fringe these days,
which is not the best place to be if you're a football player.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons rookie quarterback already has been cut once, and
the Falcons picked him up so late in training camp it would be an
upset if he made the team.
</P>
<P>
   But Dutton, 22, is used to this.
</P>
<P>
   He was a highly touted recruit at Texas in 1993, but ended up
redshirting and then transferring to Nevada-Reno after not playing
in '94.
</P>
<P>
   He put up big numbers in two years there, completing 444 of 701
passes (63.3 percent) for 6,276 yards, 42 touchdowns and just 12
interceptions. But that was in the Big West conference, and scouts
weren't convinced that the 6-foot-4, 222-pounder was as good as his
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   So he lasted until the sixth round, where the Dolphins took him.
</P>
<P>
   Now he's battling uphill on a team that already has starter
Chris Chandler and backups Tony Graziani and Steve DeBerg.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just need time to develop, and I know that,'' said Dutton,
who was waived last Tuesday by Miami, and claimed Wednesday by
Atlanta. ``I just need to stick somewhere and learn.''
</P>
<P>
   It figures to be tough for him to stick in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   He's only thrown in very basic drills, won't play Saturday at
Pittsburgh, and probably won't play next week against Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   It might be hard to get him on the practice squad because he
first must become a free agent, and other teams could outbid
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, Reeves is big on his quarterbacks being familiar with
every detail of his offense. That won't happen fast. The prospect
of keeping four quarterbacks is limited because it would leave
another position short.
</P>
<P>
   Dutton knows the odds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just going out every day, and ... trying to show that I
can make the throws at this level,'' he said. ``I've got a lot to
prove.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, next week I can get in there and throw with the
offense, and go from there. This is totally different from Miami.
(The offense is) much more complex, and the terminology is
different. If I do get waived, there will be 28 other teams, and
the World League.''

 &HT;    Zmeskal returns to gymnastics forefront at Championships
 &HT;    By Karen Rosen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ The squeak has left her voice, but the creak
hasn't set into her bones as Kim Zmeskal returns to the city of her
greatest triumph for another whirl at gymnastics.
</P>
<P>
   At age 22, once considered geriatric for a woman in her sport,
she'll compete in the U.S. Gymnastics Championships alongside girls
who once dreamed of becoming the next Kim Zmeskal. The event, which
ends Saturday, will be held at Market Square Arena, near the
Hoosier Dome where in 1991 the Houston teen became the first
American to win a World Championships all-around title.
</P>
<P>
   Before 1998, Zmeskal's last amateur competition was the
Barcelona Olympics. She had been favored to win individual medals,
but made errors that stunned her as much as it did her fans, and
came home only with a team bronze.
</P>
<P>
   ''The main thing is just that I really enjoy doing it still,''
said Zmeskal, who last year was on the pro tour and coaching
athletes she'll be up against here. ''There's just been a piece of
me that's been missing since I stepped away from competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Without prompting, Zmeskal addressed the obvious question: ''A
lot of people ask me if the reason I'm doing this is because I
didn't do what I had wanted to do in Barcelona... It really doesn't
have anything to do with that. I've been really fortunate that God
has blessed me with a body that's still intact and still able to
take the pounding that gymnastics requires, so I'm going to go for
it while I can.''
</P>
<P>
   Her coach, Mary Lee Tracy at Cincinnati Gymnastics, believes
that Zmeskal, who took third at a qualifying competition, ''has an
opportunity, if she hits (her routines) both days, to finish in the
Top 10.''
</P>
<P>
   Zmeskal's at a disadvantage because the start values of her
routines are not as high as those of her limber new rivals, and
said Tracy, an Olympic coach, ''the margin for error gets
reduced.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of a new code of points in gymnastics, ''If I was doing
the same routines as Barcelona, they would be worth nearly
nothing,'' Zmeskal said.
</P>
<P>
   The athlete whom Bela Karolyi called the toughest competitor he
ever coached had to sharpen her skills with a new body.
</P>
<P>
   Zmeskal grew only from 4-foot-7 1/4 to 4-9 1/2, but her body
gained a woman's curves.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not the little pixie 16-year-old that I was, but I feel
very in shape now,'' said Zmeskal, who, despite precautions on the
hard mat to protect her body, still sprained an ankle and tore a
miniscus recently. ''I've always been a strong, quick athlete, and
through the years I haven't really lost that.''
</P>
<P>
   Zmeskal tried a comeback in 1994, but soon tore the anterior
cruciate ligament in her right knee on a vault. She was an athletes
representative at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, staying with the
gold-medal winning U.S. team at their Emory house.
</P>
<P>
   ''As much as you get excited for everybody to do well, there's a
part that tears at you, 'Gosh, I wish I could have been out
there,''' Zmeskal said.
</P>
<P>
   Olympians Shannon Miller, who shot to glory in Barcelona when
Zmeskal faltered, and Amanda Borden are among Zmeskal's closest
friends. In fact, she was so sad about leaving the pro tour, where
Borden had helped make gymnastics fun again, that her boyfriend
suggested she join Borden in Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've never been as happy doing gymnastics as I am now,''
Zmeskal said. ''I was anxious, worried about how the reception
would be now that I'm older than the girls. It seems everybody is
cheering me on.
</P>
<P>
   ''The main thing is I don't want people to only see me as the
athlete that I was when I was younger.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Gymnastics Championships

 &HT;    2nd quarter earnings up at Home Depot 30%
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Home Depot reported better-than-expected earnings with
a 30 percent increase in profit for the second quarter, braced by
strong home sales and demand for kitchen, bath and flooring
supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street responded by boosting the stock $2 to $44.81 1/4.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based Home Depot, the world's largest do-it-yourself
home improvement retailer, said second-quarter net income was $467
million, or 31 cents a share, up from $358 million, or 24 cents, a
year ago. The results beat analysts' estimates by a penny.
</P>
<P>
   Sales increased 24 percent to $8.14 billion, up from $6.55
billion one year ago, and sales at stores open at least one year
increased 7 percent. Home Depot's pretax margin was 9.45 percent,
the company's highest second-quarter pretax margin in 16 years.
</P>
<P>
   For the first half of the fiscal year, Home Depot earned $804
million, or 53 cents a share, against $617 million, or 41 cents a
share. Sales totaled $15.26 billion in the first six months against
$12.21 billion a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Lowe's Home Improvement Warehouse, No. 2 in the home improvement
retailing business, also reported second-quarter earnings that
exceeded estimates. Lowe's announced Monday its earnings rose 31
percent to 47 cents a share, a penny over estimates.
</P>
<P>
   The housing supply retailers are cashing in on low interest
rates and vigorous home sales that are feeding demand from a
variety of customers, including do-it-yourselfers, contractors and
interior decorators.
</P>
<P>
   While its core supply products still propel earnings, Home Depot
is broadening its business with services.
</P>
<P>
   As a natural offshoot of its core supply business, Home Depot is
beefing up installation services, including a test dubbed ``At Home
Services,'' in which the company contracts with vendors that
specialize in roofing, vinyl siding and windows. Roofing is
currently offered through 125 Home Depots, including all metro
Atlanta stores. Home Depot is pushing the message by having
employees answer phone calls at some metro stores with a greeting
that says, ``We install.''
</P>
<P>
   Vinyl siding installations are being tested in 70 stores in the
Carolinas and Boston. Lowe's is also ramping up plans for
installation services.
</P>
<P>
   Installation, though, is a risky market that presents challenges
in customer satisfaction, something that Home Depot has built its
reputation on. ``It's not an easy business by any means,'' said
analyst Wayne Hood of Prudential Securities. ``Your installation
business is driven by how strong your installers are. It can create
all kinds of customer service problems, and there's potential to
lose money on call-backs,'' Hood said. Plus, it's difficult to
achieve consistency on a national basis in a highly fragmented
business dominated by independent contractors, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Other project-oriented work is being fueled through Home Depot's
Expo Design Centers, a long-term growth plan that picked up steam
this year.
</P>
<P>
   The company announced sites Tuesday for six new Expos, including
one in Marietta, that are scheduled to open next year. The street
location of the planned Marietta store was not disclosed. The city
of Alpharetta recently denied a zoning permit for an
87,900-square-foot Expo behind a 107,500-square-foot Home Depot.
Company spokesman Jerry Shields said the Marietta store does not
replace plans for Alpharetta.
</P>
<P>
   Other newly announced openings for next year include Houston,
Smithtown, N.Y., and Fairfax, Va., as well as two Los Angeles area
stores in Monrovia and Huntington Beach. The two California Expos
will be reformatted Home Depot stores. Expos will open in Boynton
Beach, Fla. and Plano, Texas, this year.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot has 16 percent of the $140 billion do-it-yourself
market in the United States. Experts expect it to ultimately have
half of the market as it continues to grab market share.
Head-to-head combat with Lowe's is proving to be good for both
companies so far, as well as consumers who are benefiting from
competitive pricing.
</P>
<P>
   PaineWebber analyst Aram Rubinson counts cars in the parking lot
each month at spots in metro Atlanta where a Lowe's has moved in on
Home Depot turf. Instead of putting a crimp on business, customers
flock to both retailers because it creates a destination, he said.
In some cases, his research shows Home Depot is busier than before
Lowe's came.
</P>
<P>
   ``It proves that these two can peacefully coexist across the
street from each other, but they end up beating up the little
guys,'' Rubinson said.
</P>
<P>
   In metro Atlanta, Lowe's has recently set up shop near Home
Depots in Lilburn and Woodstock and has plans to open a store next
spring near the Austell Home Depot by Cobb Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot will open its first store outside North America next
week in Santiago, Chile, with a second store opening in November.
Next month the first Home Depot in Puerto Rico will open in San
Juan.

NOT TOO EARLY TO TALK PEDRO AND CY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ At the request of Pedro Martinez, there will be only a
quiet mention of him becoming a 20-game winner. Why jinx him when
he probably has seven or eight starts left this season?
</P>
<P>
   But there is still nothing wrong with an old-fashioned campaign
on his behalf for the Cy Young Award. In Tuesday's matinee,
Martinez picked up his 16th victory, 4-1, and looked as sharp as he
has all year. Sure, he's still two wins behind David Cone, who
leads the majors with 18. But Cone and the Yankees will be coasting
to the American League East title in September while Martinez and
the Red Sox battle to retain their wild-card lead.
</P>
<P>
   Why am I backing Martinez? Well, chiefly because Martinez is
ahead of Cone in every one of those computer-generated numbers that
keep fantasy hackers awake at night: walk/strikeout ratio, hits per
inning, runners per nine innings, strikeouts per nine innings,
batting average vs. righthanders and lefthanders, and hits allowed
with runners in scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   Trust me. You won't see them on ESPN or the 11 o'clock news, but
these are numbers that count.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't believe them, then believe what the eyes of 33,201
at Fenway Park saw Tuesday. Martinez, improving to 16-4, worked 8
2/3 innings, giving up five hits, one run, and one walk. He struck
out 10 Rangers _ the seventh time this season he has reached double
figures. Martinez leads the AL with a 2.82 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, Martinez won last year's National League Cy Young
Award with a 17-8 record for a Montreal club that went nowhere.
This year he appears to be on his way to the playoffs for the first
time. Each victory down the stretch is important.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people have faith in you,'' said Martinez, ``and that's
where the challenge comes from. This is the closest you get to a
playoff game. That's what it is all about. I wasn't afraid of
anything today.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who champion Cone correctly mention his determination and
his return to excellence against all odds. But right now I like
Pedro.
</P>
<P>
   And here's why.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve days ago, Martinez suffered a 4-3 loss to Texas, a game
in which he struck out 13 but was taken out by manager Jimy
Williams after 6 2/3 innings. He left in a huff but he got over it.
Six days later, he wilted in a game in which the Sox gave him six
runs and was removed again. Boston eventually won, 8-7, but all
Martinez got was a no-decision. He got over that, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pedro hadn't come out to work on the sidelines in a long while
before those two starts,'' said pitching coach Joe Kerrigan. ``But
he saw things in his tape and said he wanted to come out and make
adjustments. I'm very glad that he did. That's why he's good. He
had the best curveball he's had all year.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers must have thought they got the wrong scouting
report. Martinez got six of his 10 strikeouts with curves. If you
have to watch out for his curveball, you're in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was in control of his delivery,'' said Williams. ``He
wasn't rushed and he was really consistent with most pitches. If he
happened to rush once in a while and his tempo slowed down the next
pitch, he made that correction on his own. It was a tribute to him
and his understanding going out there.''
</P>
<P>
   So why did Williams remove him with two on and two out in the
ninth, after 127 pitches, and bring in Tom Gordon?
</P>
<P>
   ``Because he'd done his job and we had a guy out there who has
been extremely effective all year long,'' said Williams. ``We like
to give Gordon a lot more breathing room than what we gave him. But
I also wanted to give Pedro a shot to finish the game, and once
they got two men on, it kind of made up your mind for you. It was a
shame because he pitched a great game.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez feels no remorse about leaving games. Maybe he never
did. He understands that he's going to have to do it again in five
days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was off on my mechanics,'' he said, ``and Joe and I went
back on the side for a couple of days. We corrected everything.
Dick Pole helped me a little bit. So did Bret Saberhagan. It all
came back all right. I was flying out and getting a little bit too
spread with my front leg. I had better command and more strength.
</P>
<P>
   That's how you win a Cy Young.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't mention it too loud,'' said Martinez. ``You're going to
jinx me.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The image of the day was of the President and
Hillary Rodham Clinton walking toward their helicopter with Chelsea
between them, holding their daughter's hands and looking straight
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Mrs. Clinton provided the text, issuing a
statement at the first lady's request that made it clear Mrs.
Clinton was steadfast but angry. She was standing by her husband
after he admitted an improper relationship with Monica Lewinsky _
but was also feeling deceived by Clinton, who some of her friends
say had not told his wife the truth of his relationship with the
former White House intern until this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was misled,'' said Marsha Berry, a spokeswoman for Mrs.
Clinton. ``She learned the nature of his testimony over the
weekend.'' When asked whether Mrs. Clinton was angry, Ms. Berry
said, ``She's a human being. Like I say, this is not an easy
time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons were on their way to Martha's Vineyard for a
two-week vacation. Two friends of the Clintons said that before
they left, the first couple was not communicating much, even as
Mrs. Clinton pitched in over the weekend to help prepare the
president for his testimony to the grand jury on Monday, though
others disputed that account.
</P>
<P>
   But even some Clinton supporters wondered whether it was
possible that Mrs. Clinton had not known at least the broad
outlines of her husband's involvement with Ms. Lewinsky. The Rev.
Jesse Jackson, who was called to the White House on Sunday night,
talked and prayed with Mrs. Clinton and Chelsea for two hours
before the three of them met briefly with the president. He said he
did not get the impression that any of the revelations were news to
Mrs. Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hillary's not naive,'' Jackson said. ``There was no one great
explosive shock and surprise moment. Hillary knows her husband well
and has for 25 years. The best evidence of that is that Sunday as
the drama was building, she was organizing his testimony, so she
knew what it was going to be.''
</P>
<P>
   And among the pundits, there was widespread speculation that the
statements from both Clintons that the president had misled his
wife were an effort to paint Mrs. Clinton as a victim _ a role she
is decidedly unaccustomed to _ rather than as someone who was less
than honest herself when she went on the ``Today'' show after the
scandal broke in January and attributed the accusations to a ``vast
right-wing conspiracy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a charade,'' said Arianna Huffington, a conservative
writer. ``It appears from a number of sources that she was
instrumental in the decision to move so quickly on the offensive,
so it doesn't add up that she was told this weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Berry said Mrs. Clinton called her on Tuesday morning and
asked that she release a statement saying ``she wanted some of her
thoughts to be out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Among them: ``This is a time that she relies on her strong
religious faith. She's committed to her marriage and loves her
husband and daughter very much and believes in the president and
her love for him is compassionate and steadfast. She clearly is
uncomfortable with her personal life being made so public but is
looking forward to going on vacation with her family and having
some family time together.''
</P>
<P>
   Several of Mrs. Clinton's friends spoke out to make the point
that she was having a hard time but holding up as well as anyone
could under the circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Lewis, the White House communications director, said Mrs.
Clinton was ``talking to people in a pleasant, smiling way'' on
Monday night, and even thought to ask whether Ms. Lewis had
received a souvenir Mrs. Clinton had sent her from their recent
trip to Seneca Falls, N.Y., to celebrate the 150th anniversary of
the declaration of women's rights.
</P>
<P>
   And Lisa Caputo, a former press secretary for Mrs. Clinton, who
was herself vacationing on Martha's Vineyard and saw the Clintons
just after their arrival, said: ``The point is that she knows all
the facts now and is deeply committed to her husband. She is deeply
in love with him and he is deeply in love with her. They are
simpatico, they have an incredible connection and chemistry to them
that carries them through a situation like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Two family friends who have spoken to Chelsea Clinton, one over
the weekend and one on Tuesday, said she seemed fine. One said she
was joking and laughing, completely at ease. As she and her parents
got off the plane at Martha's Vineyard, she walked ahead with her
father, sharing a laugh with him.
</P>
<P>
   Not long before the scandal broke last January, the Clintons
also went on vacation. Photographers on that trip to the Virgin
Islands captured the image of the couple slow-dancing on the beach.
But then, too _ even as the Clintons complained that their privacy
had been violated _ there was widespread speculation that the image
was an effort to manipulate the public, to show a happy couple
unconcerned by accusations of sexual misconduct by Paula Jones.

2 NEW SUSPECTS ARRESTED IN EMBASSY BOMBINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also AFRICA-ALBRIGHT) 
(mk) 
 By RAYMOND BONNER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan _ Pakistani authorities have arrested two
additional suspects in the bombings of the American Embassies in
Kenya and Tanzania, senior Pakistani officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The men were arrested Monday as they were trying to cross into
Afghanistan at Torkham, in the Khyber Pass, said the officials, who
insisted on anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   One suspect was a pivotal participant, an official said, adding
that the description was based on a statement by the previous
suspect arrested in the case, Mohammed Saddiq Odeh. Odeh, who was
seized Aug. 7 as he tried to enter Pakistan from Kenya with a fake
passport, named the two as accomplices when he was interrogated
last week, the official added.
</P>
<P>
   Odeh is a devotee of the Islamic fundamentalist Osama bin Laden,
a leading suspect in the embassy bombings who has vowed a holy war
against the United States. On Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright's trip to Africa to tour the shattered embassies in Kenya
and Tanzania, senior officials said Tuesday that the United States
was urging the fundamentalist government of Afghanistan to expel
bin Laden, so that the United States could try to capture him.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman at the American Embassy said that the Pakistani
government had not notified the embassy of the latest arrests.
Pakistani authorities declined to say whether they would make the
suspects available to the Americans. The government sent Odeh to
Kenya without making him available for questioning by the
Americans. But the Kenyans let the FBI interview him.
</P>
<P>
   A Pakistani official said Tuesday that Odeh had acquired a valid
visa from the Pakistani Embassy in Kenya. Pakistani officials are
investigating how Odeh, who had a fake Yemeni passport, obtained
the visa, an official said.
</P>
<P>
   When he first came to the Americans' attention, Odeh was said to
have had a slightly different rendering of his name, Mohammed Sadik
Howaida.
</P>
<P>
   The two other suspects also had fake Yemeni passports, Pakistani
authorities said Tuesday, but they had slipped past immigration
police in Karachi.
</P>
<P>
   One is a Saudi and the other a Sudanese, authorities said.
Officials would not release the suspects' names. But one official
described them as 25 to 35 and generally fitting the same profile
as Odeh, a devotee of bin Laden. American officials say they
believe that bin Laden has extensive wealth and an international
organization.
</P>
<P>
   The men are being interrogated by Pakistani intelligence, a
Pakistani official said. One aspect they want to know is what role,
if any, bin Laden had in the blasts.
</P>
<P>
   In a week of interrogation, Odeh reportedly told Pakistani
police that he had taken part in the operation and that bin Laden
had directed it. But since being sent back to Kenya on Friday, Odeh
has not made similar confessions to FBI interrogators.
</P>
<P>
   The new suspects entered the country on Aug. 7, the day of the
simultaneous bombings, which killed more than 250 people and
wounded 5,000. They were on the same flight from Kenya with Odeh,
an official said. Odeh was arrested when the immigration
authorities noted that the photograph in his Yemeni passport was
not of him.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As the investigation intensified, fears of further retaliation
against American officials resulted in more than 200 Americans'
leaving Pakistan Tuesday. The State Department ordered them on
Sunday to leave. Families waited at the airport for six hours
before the plane took off, carrying them and a score of their pets.

   ``It is a day that, of course, is sad for us,'' the American
ambassador, Thomas Simons Jr., said at the airport Tuesday morning.
``There will be a disruption of family life.''
</P>
<P>
   Simons is remaining, along with a scaled-down staff.
</P>
<P>
   But for other reasons the departures are not sad, said Simons, a
career foreign service officer whose father was a diplomat in
Karachi about 50 years ago. ``For those of us who are leaving,'' he
said, ``we are coming back, because the Americans always come back,
and we like Pakistan.''
</P>
<P>
   Interior Minister Shujat Hussain said he did not understand why
the Americans were leaving. ``We asked them,'' he said, ```Why are
you so panicky?'''
</P>
<P>
   Not all Americans are going home. In addition to ordering
diplomatic dependents to leave, the State Department strongly urged
all Americans to do so. But only a handful were on the official
plane Tuesday. The embassy said 6,700 Americans were in Pakistan.

OH, BABY! TIME REALLY DOES FLY 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   UNDATED - Time changed on me again recently.
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe not time itself. Presumably, a second still lasts
only a second, a minute a minute and so forth.
</P>
<P>
   It just doesn't seem like it anymore.
</P>
<P>
   To some degree, this happens to everyone. It depends on the
circumstance.
</P>
<P>
   An hour spent making yourself run in the middle of a scorching
Arizona day, for instance, certainly seems to last longer than the
hour it takes to watch ``E.R.'' even if a stopwatch tells you they
both last 60 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   That's not what I mean. I'm talking about long-term, seemingly
permanent changes in time.
</P>
<P>
   Supposedly if you listen to old folks talk about it, time passes
much more quickly as you age. And there is probably some truth to
that.
</P>
<P>
   Think about how you consider an hour. When you were squirming in
your desk in the third grade listening to your teacher drone on
about long division, and you looked up and saw that you still had
an hour to go until the bell rang, it seemed like forever. You
cannot convince me that the second hand on the clock didn't move
backward part of the time.
</P>
<P>
   Fast-forward to your adult life. You have one hour to complete
the report your boss just assigned you. Every time you glance at
your watch, another 15 minutes has passed. No one can convince you
that the digital second counter isn't speeding up on you. &QL; 
 &QL; 
On the run &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But nothing has thrown my internal clock out of whack like the
birth of my daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Now time really flies.
</P>
<P>
   Like everything else about fatherhood, people can try to tell
you about it all they want, but until you're actually in the
full-time diaper-changing business, you're not going to believe
them.
</P>
<P>
   (Speaking of things you won't believe until they happen, about
those diapers . . . nah. That's another column. Or not.)
</P>
<P>
   One of the things that struck me about the many books I read
while my wife was pregnant was the way the authors considered time:
Don't worry about the horrible, crusty, flaking rash that has
spread across your child's forehead, they say _ it'll pass in four
to six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever I read this, my reaction was: four to six weeks? weeks?
How do these people tell time? With a sundial?
</P>
<P>
   I'd calm down, figure things couldn't be as bad as they seemed,
and continue.
</P>
<P>
   And the authors would write blithely on, assuring the
prospective parent that a third eye growing out of the back of the
head usually closes of its own volition after the first year or
some such. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Race with clock &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Other parents treated time the same way. They talked about weeks
as if they were days, days as if they were minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I remember little Barney liked to strike matches and
throw them at the cat, but that only lasted a couple of months. We
were never worried.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, they were right. Suddenly, a week is a laughably
short amount of time. A day? Over before it starts.
</P>
<P>
   And I think I know why. Turns out _ and this is another one of
those things experienced parents warn amateurs about _ a baby keeps
you so busy all the time that you don't even notice the passage of
an hour or two. The hours turn into days, the days into weeks, and
there you have it.
</P>
<P>
   As eternal vigilance is the price of freedom, constant attention
is the cost of parenthood. Even when you're not coaxing a burp or
warming a bottle, even when you're trying to doze off for the
night, you're thinking of your baby, listening for telltale sighs
and coos and what they might mean. At work, you're busy wondering
if she's OK, and you can't wait to see her again.
</P>
<P>
   And it's well worth it. It's ironic _ the time that's passing so
fast is the best time you've ever had.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after my daughter was born, a friend in North Carolina
e-mailed me, asking if she could do any new tricks. Sure, I told
him, she can hold her head up a little and she's more alert.
</P>
<P>
   The next thing you know, he said, she'll have her driver's
license and want to borrow the car and be moving out.
</P>
<P>
   I'm sure he's right. But I won't try to guess how long it will
seem till then. &QL;

U.S. PLAN WOULD SHIFT MORE WORKING FAMILIES INTO PUBLIC HOUSING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Calif., Ill., Fla.)   (bl)  
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congressional negotiators and the Clinton
administration are very close to agreement on legislation that
would allow public housing authorities to put more working families
into apartments that in recent years have been reserved almost
exclusively for the very poor.
</P>
<P>
   The change has been sought by officials in many cities who
contend that large concentrations of extremely poor people in
public housing projects have shattered neighborhoods, sapped their
commercial vitality and left them devoid of stable families.
</P>
<P>
   For New York and other housing authorities, the changes would
free officials to set aside hundreds of more vacant units each year
for families making as much as $40,000 a year. The city's housing
authority considers the bill a necessary first step toward creating
a marketing strategy designed to encourage higher income families
to move into its housing projects.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation is also expected to give housing authorities
greater flexibility in setting rents on the nation's 1.2 million
public housing units, authorize mayors in some cities to take over
poorly run housing authorities and allow low-income people to use
federal housing vouchers to help pay the costs of buying a house.
</P>
<P>
   The public housing bill has been pressed mainly by congressional
Republicans over the opposition of Democrats and Housing and Urban
Development Secretary Andrew Cuomo, who have said that the
Republican bill would leave poor people without housing. But Cuomo
has negotiated changes in the bill that have made it acceptable to
many Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo is also on the verge of winning enactment of two other
housing measures that are likely to make it easier for
congressional Democrats and the Clinton administration to accept
the public housing bill.
</P>
<P>
   One would create about 15,000 new Section 8 housing vouchers,
which are federal rent subsidies for low-income tenants. If
approved, the increase would be the first in about five years.
Nearly 3 million households now receive housing vouchers. The
second would make federally insured mortgages available to at least
17,000 more home buyers a year.
</P>
<P>
   Though both of those measures would make relatively small
increases in public housing resources, Cuomo contends they are
important because the Republican-controlled Congress has
perennially talked of cutting housing programs.
</P>
<P>
   Lobbyists for housing authorities said the bill also includes a
provision sought by several cities, including Los Angeles and
Chicago, that would make it easier to demolish aging projects. And
housing officials across the country are pushing for the
legislation because they contend it will help them bring teachers,
municipal workers and other low-income working families into
projects. &QL;
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``We are trying to entice the public to come back to public
housing,'' said George McQuade, a spokesman for the Los Angeles
city Housing Authority.
</P>
<P>
   New York City has historically had a much more broader mix of
income groups in public housing than other large cities, and
housing experts say that diversity has helped make the city's
projects more livable than elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   But New York officials say that federal rules favoring the very
poor have caused the percentage of working families in the city's
public housing to plummet from half of all tenant households in
1983 to a third today. They contend that if the rules are not
changed, the city's projects will become bastions of deep poverty,
causing the kinds of problems that plague the nation's most
notorious housing systems, like those in Chicago and Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Public housing was never intended to be an enclave for the
very, very poor,'' said Hilly Gross, a spokesman for the New York
City Housing Authority, the nation's largest, with nearly 600,000
tenants. ``Historically, the public housing population reflected
the diversity of the communities, with people who carried lunch
pails, who were role models.''
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations on the 400-page public housing bill have reached a
delicate stage, with a number of thorny details still to be
resolved. But those involved in the talks expressed guarded
optimism late last week that the remaining differences would be
resolved and that a bill would reach the president's desk in
September.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would I say it is a certainty? No,'' said Cuomo. ``Am I
cautiously optimistic? Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the legislation would make some of the largest changes
to federal housing policy in many years, the negotiations have
often bogged down over political and symbolic issues.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans contend that the proposed changes would represent a
philosophical sea change in federal policy, moving away from
decades-old requirements that housing authorities focus their
resources almost entirely on the poorest of the poor. They contend
the bill would also provide incentives for tenants to find work and
buy homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hope is that the perception of housing authorities will be
restored to where it was in the '30s and '40s: a place where people
were proud to live,'' said Rep. Rick Lazio, R-N.Y., chairman of the
House subcommittee on housing and community development and the
lead House negotiator. ``Where you had teachers, policeman and city
workers living alongside people with no income.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats, led by Cuomo, and groups representing public
housing tenants have fought to preserve protections for the very
poor, including a requirement that housing authorities provide a
minimum number of units for the very poor and maximum limits on
rents. Cuomo had argued that an earlier draft of the House bill
would have left 1.8 million senior citizens and children without
housing.
</P>
<P>
   Many housing experts said that the compromise now taking shape
calls for narrowly drafted changes that could meet the political
needs of both sides. On the thorniest issue, for instance _ how to
bring more working families into public housing _ the proposed
changes would pare back federal requirements for housing the very
poor.
</P>
<P>
   But the changes would be incremental enough that they probably
would not be noticed for years because turnover in most housing
authorities is low and waiting lists are long.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not going to see any swift changes in composition,''
said Richard Nelson, executive director of the National Association
of Housing and Redevelopment Officials.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the compromises, some advocates for the poor say the
housing bill would still hurt very low-income families because it
would reduce the number of units available to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Poor folks would almost never have an opportunity to get into
public housing if the current provisions are passed,'' warned Ed
Williams, a founder of the New York City Public Housing Resident
Alliance, a tenant advocacy group. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Current federal rules strictly limit the number of vacant
apartments a housing authority can rent to the working poor,
defined as families earning more than 50 percent of a region's
median annual income. In New York City, the limit is 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government has also required housing authorities to
give preference to the homeless, people spending more than half
their income on rent, victims of domestic violence and people
displaced by government action. Those preferences were suspended
last year, but remain on the books.
</P>
<P>
   The compromise bill is expected to abolish the federal
preferences, allow local housing authorities to set their own
preferences and increase the number of units available to working
families by between 5 and 10 percent a year, negotiators said.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would not change current eligibility rules, under which
public housing is available only to people earning less than 80
percent of a region's median income.
</P>
<P>
   The bill is also expected to include a provision sought by New
York City that would let housing authorities set aside more units
for higher income families provided they exceeded federal
requirements for giving housing vouchers to the very poor.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo is also pushing a provision that would require housing
authorities to integrate higher income tenants into the lowest
income projects, to prevent authorities from segregating the
poorest tenants in the worst buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators said the bill will probably repeal a requirement
that links rent increases to increases in income, a rule that
Republicans say discourages people from working.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more contentious unresolved issues involves a
proposal by Lazio to allow mayors or county executives to assume
direct control of poorly run housing authorities, upon the
permission of the housing secretary. Housing officials and Cuomo
strongly oppose the idea, and are pushing a plan that would
restrict such takeovers to only the most troubled authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Another issue that has not been clearly resolved involves a
proposal to allow tenants in family housing projects to own pets.
New York City and other large housing authorities object to the
proposal, warning that vicious dogs could terrorize tenants and
housing police officers.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators said the bill was likely to leave the issue in the
hands of local housing authorities. But many housing officials
oppose that idea because they fear that political pressure from pet
owners will force them to allow pets in projects.
</P>
<P>
   Some officials said the negotiations have been complicated by
the fiercely competitive relationships entangling three of the
major players, all New Yorkers: Cuomo, Lazio and Sen. Alfonse
D'Amato, chairman of the Senate banking committee, which oversees
housing policy.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo and Lazio are considered potential rivals for the seat of
Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan if he chooses not to run in 2000.
D'Amato is responsible for helping to unseat Cuomo's father, Gov.
Mario Cuomo, in 1994. And D'Amato is widely thought to consider
Lazio an overly aggressive upstart from his political backyard of
Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   Because of tensions with Lazio, some officials said, D'Amato,
who traditionally has been very active in shaping housing
legislation, has ceded responsibility over negotiations to Sen.
Connie Mack, R-Fla., who is chairman of the Senate subcommittee on
housing and community development.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to all three New Yorkers said their personal relationships
had no impact on the housing negotiations.

AS FIRST VICTIMS ARE BURIED, IRA SPLINTER GROUP ADMITS BOMBING 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Spelling of Lliam in second-to-last graf cq.)

 By JAMES F. CLARITY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   AUGHER, Northern Ireland _ A pregnant mother and her baby
daughter, victims of the terrorist bombing on Saturday, were buried
Tuesday. Just hours later, a Catholic splinter group took
responsibility for the bomb, which killed 28 people and wounded 220
in the town of Omagh.
</P>
<P>
   The group, calling itself the Real IRA, said it had not intended
to kill people, but only to destroy property in the shopping
district of the town, 60 miles west of Belfast. The bombing was the
worst in 29 years of sectarian violence.
</P>
<P>
   The Real IRA, made up of about 100 nationalists, including some
skilled in bomb-making, split away from the Irish Republican Army
this year. The official view of both the British and Irish
governments is that the IRA and the Real IRA are separate groups,
based on intelligence reports and on information from Sinn Fein,
the political wing of the IRA
</P>
<P>
   The police said the warning they received on Saturday stipulated
the courthouse area as the target, leading them to move hundreds of
shoppers closer to the bomb, rather than away from it.
</P>
<P>
   The Real IRA, in a telephone call to a newspaper office in
Dublin, denied assertions by the authorities that it had
deliberately misled the police.
</P>
<P>
   The Real IRA spokesman, using a recognized IRA code word to
identify himself, said that in three telephone calls on Saturday,
two to Ulster Television in Belfast, it was made clear that the
bomb would be 300 to 400 yards from the courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Tuesday afternoon a Real IRA spokesman said that
``at no time was it said it was near the court house.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement continued: ``It was a commercial target. Despite
media reports it was not our intention at any time to kill any
civilians. It was a commercial target, part of an ongoing war
against the Brits. We offer apologies to the civilians.''
</P>
<P>
   The police and officials greeted the statement with scorn.
Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam said: ``I think it is a
pathetic excuse for mass murder. Responsibility for this atrocity
rests entirely with the bombers. The Irish and British governments
will do all they can to hunt them down.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts said it was possible that inexperienced terrorists made
ghastly mistakes in their operation, making unclear statements, or
placing the car bomb in the wrong place, fouling their own plan.
</P>
<P>
   The Irish Republican Army, which has been observing a cease-fire
for 13 months, often hit economic targets in the middle of business
districts in mainly Protestant towns, but only after giving the
police accurate information on the time and place. Some IRA
operations killed civilian passers-by. But none has approached the
Saturday attack in which the Real IRA, a Catholic group, hit the
center of a town that is 70 percent Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   Seven hours before the group's statement, several hundred
mourners, many weeping as they prayed, crowded around a small, gray
Catholic church and graveyard near this rural village to watch the
burial of Avril Monaghan, 30, her 18-month-old daughter, Maura, and
the twin girls in her womb, due to be born next month.
</P>
<P>
   The Monaghans were the first victims to be buried after the
attack. Mrs. Monaghan's mother, Mary Grimes, also was killed in the
bombing; she will be buried on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   No one could recall when a single attack had killed members of
three generations of the same family.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pray for forgiveness for those who caused that most awful
act of murder,'' said the Rev. James Grimes, Avril Monaghan's
uncle. ``We hope that this may be the last of the terrible agonies
that people have suffered during the past 30 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of mourners, with a view of several fields of grazing
cattle, gathered on the hillside outside the 200-year-old Church of
St. Macartan to listen to the Mass through loudspeakers. Some stood
guiltily on graves and leaned on headstones, straining for a look
at the burial.
</P>
<P>
   Many people broke down in tears as two coffins, a large wooden
one and a small white one, were carried out of the church to the
graveyard.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Monaghan, the husband and father, who has three
surviving children, two girls and a boy, lowered his head and was
guided by friends who held his arms.
</P>
<P>
   P.J. O'Connor, 45, a cousin of Monaghan who also works with him,
said he and others had sat up Monday night with the bereaved
father. ``He was taking it fairly well,'' O'Connor said. ``With
people around you, you're all right. We talked about other
things.''
</P>
<P>
   The police Tuesday were still questioning five men arrested in
the area on Monday in connection with the attack. The Irish and
British governments were preparing new security measures to curb
terrorism, but indicated that they would not now propose the
restoration of preventive detention or internment of terrorism
suspects without trials.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A neighbor, Lliam McConnell, who runs a pub here, said he had
just agreed to hire Mrs. Monaghan as a bookkeeper. He brought his
old mandolin to St. Macartan's Tuesday and played a traditional
Gaelic song of mourning.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday afternoon, Prince Charles visited Belfast and Omagh to
offer the British Royal Family's sympathy. He recalled that his
uncle, Lord Mountbatten, had been killed by the IRA in 1979, ``so I
do have some understanding of the awful horrors that people have to
put up with.''

<P>
   At best, Northern Ireland was stuttering and grumbling its way
toward a highly uncertain peace.
</P>
<P>
   Although it withstood one severe challenge this summer _ by a
very Irish kind of luck _ the Omagh bombing is a threat even more
tragic and perilous.
</P>
<P>
   April's Good Friday agreement, whose signing in Belfast was
celebrated on both sides of the Atlantic, did no more than sketch
out a middle ground on which unionists and nationalists who reject
violence might together govern this province of 1.6 million people.
</P>
<P>
   But that ground is narrow, and painful issues still must be
faced this year, while already, the renewed terrorism has all but
swamped the accord.
</P>
<P>
   The unresolved issues go to the heart of the relationship
between Protestants and Catholics, who roughly equate with
unionists and nationalists.
</P>
<P>
   The initial referendum on the peace accord gained the support of
71 percent of the province's voters. Most of the no votes were in
the unionist camp, which makes up between 55 percent and 60 percent
of the province. The unionists have many cavils with the agreement
and the structure of the assembly it sets up.
</P>
<P>
   But most of all they are concerned and often enraged by the vast
concessions being made to Sinn Fein, the political wing of the
Irish Republican Army.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA has waged continuous war on the United Kingdom and on
unionists for 30 years; many unionists cannot believe _ especially
now after Omagh _ that the IRA has given up and see in any
acquiescence to the agreement a sly opening gambit in a war by
other means.
</P>
<P>
   The two toughest elements for the unionists to swallow are the
release of terrorists, the majority of whom are republicans, and
the entry into the provincial government of leading members of Sinn
Fein, such as Gerry Adams.
</P>
<P>
   According to the cunningly wrought agreement _ which gives and
takes in roughly equal measure _ Northern Ireland is confirmed as
part of the United Kingdom. But there must be a development of the
cross-border institutions that unionists fear because nationalists
see them as embryos of an all-Irish government.
</P>
<P>
   Their basic fear may be well-founded: that the nationalists in
Northern Ireland will use the newly created assembly to advance a
nationalist and sectarian-Catholic agenda, rather than using it to
govern a divided province within the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, in other parts of the world, recent settlements and
negotiations have included some form of renunciation.
</P>
<P>
   For example, South African whites renounced their right to rule.
The Palestine Liberation Organization, at least in negotiations,
recognized Israel's right to exist. Mikhail Gorbachev let communism
die.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA, on the other hand, has agreed to take part in the
parliament of a province whose right to exist as part of the United
Kingdom it does not recognize. The IRA has neither formally nor
informally renounced its absolute opposition to British rule in any
part of Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Even the nationalist Social Democratic and Labor Party (SDLP),
which has always argued for peaceful politics, continues to press
for a united Ireland _ especially in the statements and speeches of
its leader, John Hume.
</P>
<P>
   It is, then, no mystery why unionists do not all gladly embrace
peace. They see the enemy against which they have fought for three
decades brought inside the pale of democratic politics and rewarded
with seats, ministerial posts and salaries _ without changing
position, apologizing for past murders or giving up any of its
large stock of weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The largest uncertainty in the unionist mind is Irish
nationalism. For all of this century, Irish nationalism has been
variegated and has spoken with different accents, but in the end
saw itself as a family that, when challenged, would always put
unity before agreement with opponents.
</P>
<P>
   In this version, no nationalist, no matter how reasonable,
peacefully inclined or constitutionally minded, would betray the
cause of a united Ireland, even if he might tut-tut at the methods
used by the IRA. The British were never a friendly neighboring
state or fellow member of the European Union. Where not the enemy
(as they were to the IRA), they were at least an obstacle to the
historic mission to unify.
</P>
<P>
   Both the SDLP and Sinn Fein sold the agreement to their
followers on the understanding that it would lead to a united
Ireland sooner or later. Gerry Adams won assent from his doubting
organization by persuading it that peaceful means could advance the
republican agenda better than war.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the IRA has not handed in any weapons and has
consistently refused to countenance doing so. Weapons surrender has
been the great failure of the talks. They were supposed to be
surrendered before the talks began, while they were taking place,
and before Sinn Fein takes the seats it won in the June assembly
elections and before Adams gets the ministerial position to which
Sinn Fein's vote entitles him. The lack of any progress on this
front fuels unionist fears.
</P>
<P>
   The only issue that aggravates the unionists even more than
weapons is the release of terrorist prisoners. Although both
republican and loyalist terrorists are to be released, the former
greatly outnumber the latter, and their release causes much more
outrage in unionist areas than loyalist releases do in nationalist
ones.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the men to be released killed policemen; others gunned
down part-time members of the army reserve. Some were enforcers
within the nationalist community, where punishment for crimes such
as drug dealing is a bullet through one or both kneecaps, or for
suspected betrayal, death. Their release causes revulsion,
especially among members of the police force (the Royal Ulster
Constabulary) and former members of the army reserve.
</P>
<P>
   There is also fear as Sinn Fein continues to strive to overtake
the SDLP as the largest nationalist party by stressing the
discrimination and exclusion many Catholics still say they feel.
</P>
<P>
   The rarely voiced but always present factor in Northern
Ireland's politics is the ticking clock of demographics. Catholics
were little more than 30 percent of the population in the 1920s, at
the time of partition; they now account for well over 40 percent
and are still growing relative to the Protestants.
</P>
<P>
   While a significant minority of Catholics probably vote for a
unionist party, the overwhelming majority votes nationalist and can
be expected to continue to do so. When the number of Catholics
approaches a majority, Protestants who cannot bear the thought of
becoming part of a united Ireland may turn to violence.
</P>
<P>
   Among unionists, loyalty to God, conscience, or both is more
highly esteemed than loyalty to a party leader. Further, the
messianism of republicanism is countered by a view that Ulster's
status as part of the United Kingdom is quasi-religious and
includes for many unionists a passionately felt loyalty to a
monarchy which remains Protestant (no Catholic can succeed to the
throne of Great Britain).
</P>
<P>
   These issues are large _ and the mood is delicate, especially in
the unionist camp. Indeed, the strains of mistrust and violence may
sink the peace process and produce a situation as dangerous as any
of the past 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   But it cannot be denied that, thus far, the changes are vast,
and the situation is more hopeful than in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Bombs used to go off nightly; the cities of Belfast,
Londonderry, and most towns and villages were saturated by police
and army troops, with endless roadblocks, body searches and random
questioning by patrols. The British and Irish governments were
coldly formal with each other; the old provincial parliament was
abolished and direct rule put in its place; much of the Catholic
working class was slipping toward the IRA, and Protestant
paramilitary groups were massing across the province.
</P>
<P>
   Today, though Belfast is not a showcase among British cities, it
has recovered something of its tranquillity and lost some of its
grimy, slummy industrial look _ rather like Glasgow, which it
resembles and whose industrial development was similar to its own.
</P>
<P>
   So much public money has been pumped into the province that its
infrastructure is better than most other parts of the United
Kingdom. The two great engineering plants in Belfast _ the
shipbuilders Harland and Wolff and the Shorts aircraft
manufacturers _ have been kept in existence through adroit placing
of state contracts. An erstwhile culinary desert and possessor of
thousands of smoky, men-only bars divided on sectarian lines now
has a rash of bistros, trendy restaurants, and comfortable hotels.
</P>
<P>
   A moderate nationalist has become mayor of Belfast, reflecting
both unionist division and a growing Catholic inner-city
population, and has won cautious assent from the moderate
unionists. The second main city, Londonderry, has been
nationalist-controlled for years. Apart from some flashpoints
around marching season, trouble has been relatively low.
</P>
<P>
   In all this visible improvement, ``relatively'' is the key word.
In all but the most solidly Protestant enclaves, which have been
largely untouched by the troubles, both communities are
distrustful, sometimes vengeful, with collective memories of
grievance that will last for decades.
</P>
<P>
   Time is needed in which the main political figures have _ or
should have _ some space in which to create, rather than merely
preserve.
</P>
<P>
   Entering the 21st century, peace is a tall order, but the
agreement still gives hope it might be done, at last.

<P>
   At best, Northern Ireland was stuttering and grumbling its way
toward a highly uncertain peace.
</P>
<P>
   Although it withstood one severe challenge this summer _ by a
very Irish kind of luck _ the Omagh bombing is a threat even more
tragic and perilous.
</P>
<P>
   April's Good Friday agreement, whose signing in Belfast was
celebrated on both sides of the Atlantic, did no more than sketch
out a middle ground on which unionists and nationalists who reject
violence might together govern this province of 1.6 million people.
</P>
<P>
   But that ground is narrow, and painful issues still must be
faced this year, while already, the renewed terrorism has all but
swamped the accord.
</P>
<P>
   The unresolved issues go to the heart of the relationship
between Protestants and Catholics, who roughly equate with
unionists and nationalists.
</P>
<P>
   The initial referendum on the peace accord gained the support of
71 percent of the province's voters. Most of the no votes were in
the unionist camp, which makes up between 55 percent and 60 percent
of the province. The unionists have many cavils with the agreement
and the structure of the assembly it sets up.
</P>
<P>
   But most of all they are concerned and often enraged by the vast
concessions being made to Sinn Fein, the political wing of the
Irish Republican Army.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA has waged continuous war on the United Kingdom and on
unionists for 30 years; many unionists cannot believe _ especially
now after Omagh _ that the IRA has given up and see in any
acquiescence to the agreement a sly opening gambit in a war by
other means.
</P>
<P>
   The two toughest elements for the unionists to swallow are the
release of terrorists, the majority of whom are republicans, and
the entry into the provincial government of leading members of Sinn
Fein, such as Gerry Adams.
</P>
<P>
   According to the cunningly wrought agreement _ which gives and
takes in roughly equal measure _ Northern Ireland is confirmed as
part of the United Kingdom. But there must be a development of the
cross-border institutions that unionists fear because nationalists
see them as embryos of an all-Irish government.
</P>
<P>
   Their basic fear may be well-founded: that the nationalists in
Northern Ireland will use the newly created assembly to advance a
nationalist and sectarian-Catholic agenda, rather than using it to
govern a divided province within the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, in other parts of the world, recent settlements and
negotiations have included some form of renunciation.
</P>
<P>
   For example, South African whites renounced their right to rule.
The Palestine Liberation Organization, at least in negotiations,

FEMA URGES `SAFE ROOMS' IN TORNADO-PRONE AREAS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Fla., Okla., Kan., Ga., Ala., Miss.)   (bl)  
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With weather forecasting and warning systems far
better than they were in years past, government officials are
taking an old-fashioned approach to reducing deaths in tornadoes:
They are encouraging people to build modern versions of the
traditional storm cellars.
</P>
<P>
   Construction of ``safe rooms'' in dwellings in tornado-prone
regions could cut down on fatalities, Federal Emergency Management
Agency Director James Lee Witt said Tuesday at the opening session
of the National Tornado Forum.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that 120 people have been killed in tornadoes in the
United States this year, Witt said, ``That's 120 lives too many.''
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging that safe rooms and cellars are useless if people
do not know a tornado is approaching, the agency is also
encouraging homeowners to buy weather-alert radios that turn on
automatically when tornado warning is transmitted by forecasters.
</P>
<P>
   Witt said his agency and the Wind Research Center at Texas Tech
University had developed plans for safe rooms that could provide
protection against tornado winds up to 250 miles an hour and
wind-driven objects flying up to 100 mph.
</P>
<P>
   A safe room could be built in a basement, a crawl space or a
room above ground. Depending on size and materials used, it could
cost $2,000 to $5,000 _ serious money for many homeowners. FEMA
spokeswoman Vallee Bunting conceded that financial incentives, like
rebates on homeowners' insurance, would be necessary to get a lot
of people to build safe rooms.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   National Weather Service Director John Kelly said warning
systems had improved dramatically in recent years, but ``even a
perfect warning is reduced to an academic exercise if people don't
receive it and react to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly recalled the twisters that killed more than 40 people in
Florida in late February. ``We had sirens out with good lead time,
but it was late at night, with no outdoor sirens, televisions
turned off and most of our citizens in bed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, FEMA is encouraging homeowners in vulnerable areas
to buy weather-alert radios, Ms. Bunting said. Though tornados have
occurred in every state, they are most frequent in Texas, Oklahoma,
Kansas and other Plains states, as well as the South.
</P>
<P>
   The session Tuesday and Wednesday follows a regional tornado
forum in Atlanta in April, after tornadoes killed more than 40
people in Georgia, Alabama and Mississippi. State officials and
representatives of the Department of Housing and Urban Development
and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration are taking
part.
</P>
<P>
   Information on building safe rooms will be available through
FEMA Publications (1-800-480-2520) in October and from the agency's
Web site (www.fema.gov) soon thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   Weather experts attributed the high number of tornado fatalities
so far this year in part to the frequency of tornadoes in the
South. The region has many mobile homes and homes without
basements, and because tornadoes in the South are apt to be driven
by cold fronts, they are more likely to occur at night when people
are asleep.
</P>
<P>
   The last year there were as many tornado-related deaths was
1984, when 122 people were killed. Though this year's death toll is
relatively high, it does not approach losses in years when weather
forecasting was less advanced. In 1925, nearly 800 people were
killed in a single day, March 18, as tornadoes raked the South and
Midwest.

 &HT;    Braves Notebook: Once again, Braves well-represented in Cy Young
hopefuls
 &HT;    By I. J. Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Cy Young Award ballots went out this week to 28
sportswriters around the country and what looked like a Greg Maddux
landslide a couple of weeks ago is suddenly become a pretty good
race.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to teammate Tom Glavine.
</P>
<P>
   Glavine, who gets the start tonight against the Giants, is
pitching his best baseball ever this late in the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   In his last six starts, he is 4-0, allowing five runs on just 25
hits covering 47 innings. He has thrown 23 straight scoreless
innings, and in a season where his team has the division wrapped
up, the Cy Young is on his mind. Also, San Diego's Andy Ashby
(16-6) and Kevin Brown (15-4) have to be considered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would love to win another one,'' he said. ``Doggy (Maddux)
is the favorite, but we have six weeks left.''
</P>
<P>
   Going into Tuesday's game, the numbers between Maddux and
Glavine were very close. Maddux had 15 wins, Glavine 16, Maddux has
a 1.67 ERA while Glavine is at 2.35. Opponents are hitting .206
against Maddux and .235 against Glavine. But Maddux does have five
shutouts to Glavine's two and 157 strikeouts to Glavine's 125. But
Glavine has been super in the clutch. He's 8-1 after a Braves loss
while Maddux is 5-4.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tommy is pitching as good as I have ever seen him,'' pitching
coach Leo Mazzone said. ``Of course, I have been saying that about
him for years.''
</P>
<P>
   A new Byrd
</P>
<P>
   Proving that Atlanta's discards can fit in elsewhere, Paul Byrd
and the Phillies shut out Randy Johnson and the Astros Monday
night. Was Braves general manager John Schuerholz surprised. ``He
pitched a good game against Florida for us (last year),''
Schuerholz said. ``I'm glad for Paul. But I probably talked to 21
clubs about deals and there was no interest in him.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves decided to place Byrd on waivers to make room on
their 40-man roster for veteran reliever Norm Charlton. Byrd was
claimed by several teams, the Phillies getting him because they had
the worst record.
</P>
<P>
   Said Byrd, who pitched a four-hitter against the Astros, ``I was
almost in tears when they gave me a standing ovation at the end of
the game.''
</P>
<P>
   This and That
</P>
<P>
   Former Brave Francisco Cabrera, who more than a month ago signed
with the Albany-Colonie Diamond Dogs of the Northwest League,
finally made to the club after a month of visa problems. Cabrera,
now 31, was expected to be in the lineup Tuesday night and feels
the independent league is his first step back to the majors. ``I
feel I can keep playing for maybe six, seven more years,'' he said.
... Shortstop Ozzie Smith used a bat made the company Hoosier.
Under his name on the bat are the words THE DREAM. ... Utility
infielder Rafael Belliard, who has been out since April 9 with torn
quadriceps, will leave today for a rehab assignment, possibly Class
A Macon. ... Reliever Russ Springer (bone spur in elbow), who is
eligible to come off the disabled list on Friday, threw again in
the bullpen Tuesday and had no problems. ...Since August 1993, the
Braves are 34-12 against the Giants.

sympathy than with where that musician was born or lives.
</P>
<P>
   Yet sometimes a relationship between geography and music holds
true, and two new piano recordings, by Stephen Hough and Leif Ove
Andsnes, make a persuasive case for the power of place.
</P>
<P>
   Hough's ``New York Variations'' explores music connected with
the city in which the pianist, who is English, spends half of each
year. Andsnes' ``Long, Long Winter Night'' is devoted to music by
five composers who were born in Norway, that pianist's homeland.
</P>
<P>
   Both CDs present unhackneyed fare. Indeed, two of the four works
Hough plays (John Corigliano's ``Etude Fantasy'' and George
Tsontakis' ``Ghost Variations'') are new to records. And though the
material Andsnes presents may be familiar to Scandinavians, most
Americans will not find it so.
</P>
<P>
   Hough's Manhattan paean (Hyperion CDA 67005) opens with
Corigliano's five-movement ``Etude Fantasy,'' from 1976, a work
that benefits from the pianist's focus and natural reticence.
</P>
<P>
   In the first etude, ``For the Left Hand Alone,'' a spare
six-note row yields to increasing intensity. Culmination comes when
the right hand enters to start the second etude, ``Legato.'' Here,
Hough imparts immense concentration, drawing the listener into
quiet music that in lesser hands might seem cerebral and
uninvolving.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifths to Thirds'' is a playful romp, and Hough reveals
virtuosity without ostentation. In ``Ornaments,'' he embellishes
the music with a painterly touch, shifting subtly to project
colors.
</P>
<P>
   For ``Melody,'' the final etude, Hough brings a brooding quality
to Corigliano's stark, melancholy strains. And as the music slows,
the piece ends before the listener even realizes it, as if carried
off by a gentle breeze.
</P>
<P>
   In Copland's lapidary Piano Variations of 1930, the best-known
work on the disk, Hough performs with his customary good taste. The
variations offer playful athleticism as well as more earnest
musical strivings, and he plays them soberly yet with an admirable
twinkle. In the coda, he lends keen edge to an ending fraught with
gravity.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Weber's 12-tone Fantasy of 1946, also a series of
variations, is a richer-sounding piece, and Hough graces it with a
kind of tempered bravura. Weber (born William Jennings Bryan),
though practically self-taught in composition, was an accomplished
stylist, and this lush work, a pastiche of influences, proves a
fine canvas for Hough's flourishes.
</P>
<P>
   The album aptly concludes with its biggest offering (at more
than 30 minutes), George Tsontakis' excellent three-movement
``Ghost Variations,'' from 1991, an expansive tonal work of fluid
contrasts and striking musical episodes.
</P>
<P>
   To this ambitious work, Hough applies his formidable technique
and fine interpretive sense to nearly overpowering effect.
</P>
<P>
   The first section is divided into five parts, ending with
variations on a snippet from the finale of Mozart's Piano Concerto
No. 22, a familiar, childlike theme that appears as if from
nowhere. The theme reappears in the two scherzos that follow, now
more ghostly than before and more fully woven into the structure of
Tsontakis' thickly textured, dynamic music.
</P>
<P>
   Hough renders these movements sonic collages, contrasting bold
colors with subtle hues worthy of the French Impressionists.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the often brash, dissonant, even acerbic world
Hough conjures in ``New York Variations,'' Andsnes' ``Long, Long
Winter Night'' (EMI Classics CDC-56541), brings to mind placid
environs of cool beauty.
</P>
<P>
   Andsnes, a young Norwegian pianist, begins this collection of
miniatures conventionally, with nine gems from Grieg. But instead
of excerpts from the famous ``Lyric Pieces,'' he offers selections
from the Norwegian Folk Songs (Op. 66) and the ``Peasant Dances''
(Op. 72). Essentially scenes of pastoral life, these little pieces
delight the ear.
</P>
<P>
   The jaunty ``Tomorrow You'll Marry Her'' (Op. 66, No. 10), for
instance, is full of charm, as is ``Halling From the Fairy Hill''
(Op. 72, No. 4). ``Lullaby'' (Op. 66, No. 17) sounds almost too
engaging to be soothing.
</P>
<P>
   Geirr Tveitt's 50 Folk Tunes From Hardanger, published more than
50 years after Grieg's efforts, spring from the same sylvan well.
Andsnes plays seven of these mini-sagas. By turns refined
(``Welcome With Honor''), jocular (``Tears and Laughter for a
Boat'') and rustically attractive (``The Long, Long Winter
Night''), these works stealthily embed themselves in the memory.
</P>
<P>
   Andsnes puts his characteristically deft touch to ideal use in
David Monrad Johansen's ``Pictures From Nordland,'' a suite from
1919. Especially in ``The Little Stone God,'' the pianist uses his
solid technique to expose nuance and accentuate drama. And in
``Reindeer,'' you can practically see the beasts scampering about.
</P>
<P>
   The most substantial work on the disk is Fartein Valen's 12-tone
Variations for Piano of 1936. As in so many other items on this CD,
the music starts out sedately, but tensions soon build.
</P>
<P>
   At less than eight minutes, the piece remains modest, even as
Andsnes' accomplishment transcends such limitations. In his
crystalline tone, every note matters.
</P>
<P>
   The disk concludes with music by Harold Saeverud, who died in
1993 and is the best-known composer here after Grieg. In selections
from Saeverud's ``Tunes and Dances From Siljustol,'' mostly
composed during World War II, ``Ballad of Revolt'' sounds like a
combination of ``When Johnny Comes Marching Home'' and
Rachmaninoff's Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini, and is pretty much
what its title suggests.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cotton Grass Plays on a Moonbeam,'' ``Thor and His
Hammer'' and ``Tone's Cradle Song'' revert to a more detached, less
martial esthetic.
</P>
<P>
   But it is the short ``Hymn Against the Boyg,'' from Saeverud's
1947 incidental music to Ibsen's ``Peer Gynt,'' that commands real
attention. With this score, a gloomy meditation that begins deep in
the bass and rises, Saeverud intended to forge a path for Ibsen's
themes that differed from Grieg's much-loved approach.
</P>
<P>
   To judge from this excerpt, he accomplished his goal, and
Andsnes plays the crisp music with a savvy sense of foreboding.
</P>
<P>
   Each of these albums makes a strong case for the place of
geography in music. They are stronger, more compelling statements
thanks to thematic threads that reveal something extra about the
performers. That the music is close to the players' hearts must be
obvious, but it is through repeated hearings that one realizes the
scope of that significance.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to Hough's and Andsnes' personal connection to these
scores, listeners may appreciate music they might otherwise never
have bothered with. That in itself is an achievement worth noting.

BRITAIN'S DIANA-MANIA, ANNIVERSARY EDITION  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 23.) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By SARAH LYALL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With Britain bracing itself for a barrage of
Princess-Diana-related television programming in the next few
weeks, it is not surprising that ``The Princess's People,'' one of
the shows on offer, has generated a bit of unflattering advance
publicity.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe because it shows, among other things, Londoners swearing
at the television set during the broadcast of the Princess of
Wales' funeral last year.
</P>
<P>
   Or, to quote The Sunday Mirror, a tabloid newspaper that prides
itself on its always tasteful (if somewhat relentless) coverage of
Diana in the post-Diana era: ``This filth on TV insults the memory
of Diana. So why are the BBC screening it?''
</P>
<P>
   Iconoclastic as ``The Princess's People'' may be (it makes the
apparently subversive point that some people in Britain were not
particularly upset about Diana's death), it is one of a vast sea of
specials planned as the first anniversary of her death approaches
and Diana-mania heats up in a way never seen before _ or, at least,
not seen since her actual death last Aug. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Though Diana rarely seems far from people's minds, and though
she has been a ghoulishly constant presence in the newspapers and
on television, Britain's five noncable television stations are
taking this opportunity to beat back to life every possible angle
on every conceivable aspect of her life and death.
</P>
<P>
   The shows range from the frankly spiritual (the BBC is
broadcasting a special edition of ``Songs of Praise,'' a religious
program that appears ever Sunday) to the faintly ridiculous
(Channel 5, the nation's youngest and scrappiest noncable station,
is presenting a Diana quiz show).
</P>
<P>
   In between are a vast army of documentaries, docudramas and
other specials focusing on particular aspects of the Diana story.
These, of course, will join the vast industy of Diana books, Diana
editions of magazines and Diana sections of newspapers that make up
Britain's Diana media juggernaut.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have two sets of programs running during the anniversary
period,'' said John Diamond, a columnist for The Times of London
and a television critic. ``The first commemorating the anniversary
of the death of a much-loved princess and the second asking why in
the world we're broadcasting the first.''
</P>
<P>
   If a prize were awarded for sheer volume of Diana programming,
Channel 5 would win. Still struggling to find its audience and to
establish itself as a real competitive presence, Channel 5 devoted
an entire evening to Diana-related shows last Sunday, using a
creative mix of genres in order, according to a publicity release,
``to reflect her true popularity and examine the influence she had
on her public.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to be ahead of everybody,'' said Greg Day, a
publicity executive at Channel 5. ``The problem is that since we're
still a small, growing station, we knew that if we tried to get our
programming out during the weekend that she died, we'd be dwarfed
and dominated by the other stations. We wanted to get in there
first, for commercial reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Channel 5 has given a great deal of thought to its programming
mix, Day said, based on its research into the responses to Diana's
death. ``Our programming stretches across different genres,'' he
said. ``The idea is to show her impact on every single area of TV.
There is something about Diana that pervades every single genre.''
</P>
<P>
   Hence, Channel 5's quiz show ``100 Percent Diana,'' the idea of
which has left some people ``shocked and disgusted,'' he said, but
which grew out of the network's interviews with children and
teen-agers. ``The kids said it would be a bit like a history
lesson; she's dead, but it would be interesting to know how much we
actually know about her,'' Day explained.
</P>
<P>
   ``100 Percent Diana'' is to feature 3 contestants and 100
Diana-trivia questions, along the lines of ``When she was 11, she
had a pet guinea pig. What was its name?'' (Answer: Peanuts.) Other
questions will focus on Diana's clothes, Diana's public utterances
and Diana's private life. The winner gets $160, to be donated to
charity.
</P>
<P>
   The network will also show ``I Dream of Diana,'' a one-hour
documentary in which, according to the network's press release, ``a
group of people talk about the dreams they've had of Diana since
her death, and how those dreams affect their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Another show, ``After Diana,'' is a documentary look at the
royal family's woeful post-Diana image problems and how it has
sought the help of the British government in boosting its appeal.
And ``The Diana Years'' is a three-hour documentary, to be shown
three Sundays in a row, that seeks to give an MTV-style
``rock-and-roll view of Diana's life from Shy Di to the world's No.
1 icon,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Using a quick-cutting camera style and a racy soundtrack, ``The
Diana Years'' uses interviews with Bob Geldof, Jeffrey Archer and
others to position Diana ``at the center of everything else that
was happening at the time, and what her impact was on theater,
music, film and the media generally,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the network plans to broadcast ``The People's
Princess,'' a two-hour dramatization of the wrenching final week of
Diana's life, with actors playing her, Dodi al-Fayed, who died with
her in the Paris car crash, and a raft of peripheral figures. The
show initially appeared on cable television last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's designed to appeal to an audience who sees it as a way to
honor the memory of her,'' Day said. ``It's a very sympathetic view
of her last week. It's extremely mainstream and very soft-focus.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Hello magazine on television,'' he added, referring to
Britain's popular weekly celebrity magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Channel 5 seems to be the only network to broadcast (or at least
to admit to broadcasting) a fictionalized account of Diana's death.
Most of the other stations are sticking strictly to fact-based
programming, competing to find angles that set them apart from the
pack.
</P>
<P>
   There's the tentatively titled ``Unseen Diana'' on ITV, which
uses, according to the network, ``never-before-seen video footage
of the People's Princess,'' compiled from members of the public who
met her and provided ITV with home videos of her showing up at
their houses, schools and hospital beds.
</P>
<P>
   There's another documentary, currently called ``Diana's
Children,'' also on ITV, which ``looks at the children whose lives
were touched by the Princess'' _ children she took care of before
her marriage, children she met during her charity work and others _
and explores the ``profound effect her tragic death had on them.''
</P>
<P>
   `Diana's life has been quite well trawled,'' said Steve
Anderson, controller for news and current affairs of ITV. ``But
we're heading into a period which will be quite poignant and quite
sad, and as a way to mark her life a year after her death, the two
shows we're airing focus on her relationships with people.''
</P>
<P>
   ITV's experience several months ago, when it broadcast a
much-criticized documentary investigation into the car crash that
killed Diana, proved how insatiable the public appetite was,
Anderson said. The program drew an audience of almost 15 million
people, about 53 percent of the audience share.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the program is right and it feels right and you pitch it
right and it doesn't seem too exploitative _ '' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Channel 4 is broadcasting a documentary about Diana's
role in the international campaign to ban land mines, one of her
favorite causes. And ``Diana: The Mourning After,'' written and
narrated by the journalist Christopher Hitchens, also on Channel 4,
is an effort to find some method in the madness surrounding the
media coverage of and reaction to Diana's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``The film looks in a fairly studied way at Diana and the impact
of her death and the way the media reported it,'' said Paul Smith,
a press officer at Channel 4, which is broadcasting the program.
``He's taking a step back from what was being reported at the time,
which represented such a monolithic view of Britain.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith added that he didn't believe that the British public was
likely to suffer from Diana overload. ``Everyone's doing their bit
to mark the anniversary, and this is what we're doing,'' he said.
``We're not directly competing with the other programs. People who
want to watch them will, and people who don't won't.''
</P>
<P>
   Of all the shows, ``The Princess's People'' has come in for the
most advance publicity and the most advance criticism. The
75-minute film, which gauges the reactions of ordinary people
around Britain on the day of Diana's funeral last year, is to be
shown on Sept. 6, the anniversary of the funeral, on BBC2. The
film, said Colin Luke, its director, is most definitely not about
Diana herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I'm not interested in saying anything about
Diana,'' he said. ``I'm bored stiff with seeing stuff about her on
film, and the last thing I would want is to make a film about
Diana. I'm interested in ordinary people, not stars and icons.''
</P>
<P>
   To that end, the film is the result of film shot at various
spots in London and around Britain during Diana's funeral. These
include a hairdresser's salon, a pub, the scene of a countryside
wedding and a newspaper store, as well as the streets of London,
filled with the sad, the indifferent and the curious.
</P>
<P>
   As several newspapers that have seen advance copies of the
program have pointed out, some of the people caught on camera have
been less then reverential about Diana and her funeral. One person,
for instance, mocks the so-called floral tributes left for her, and
another wanders through the crowds in search of celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives the lie to the notion that British people were united
in their grief,'' Luke said. ``But we tried to paint a fair
portrait. A lot of people were affected, and cried, and put flowers
out, but some people didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   People should draw their own conclusions,'' he added. ``One
conclusion is that human beings are wonderfully rich and complex
and varied, and all of us behave differently and have different
emotions. That is contrary to what our media and the world media
was saying about us, that we had all been overcome by some
collective emotion.''
</P>
<P>
   Is this the beginning of the end? When this is all over, will
Britain be able to get on with its life?
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, the interest in Diana and the payback for
television companies is too great,'' said Day of Channel 5. ``But
perhaps we'll see a lessening of interest as time goes on. I
certainly hope so.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When President Clinton strode into the Rose Garden
on August 6, his jazzy gold and navy necktie stood out sharply
against his white shirt and sent a jolt through certain lawyers
around town.
</P>
<P>
   They were not clotheshorses struck by a rare Washington fashion
statement. They were prosecutors in the office of Kenneth Starr,
wondering if the president might have dressed to obstruct justice _
by sending a secret signal to Monica Lewinsky as she testified
before the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky, the former intern at the center of the
investigation into sex and lies at the White House, had said during
her debriefings with prosecutors in recent weeks that she had given
Clinton the Zegna tie on his 50th birthday, in August 1996.
</P>
<P>
   According to what Ms. Lewinsky told a close friend, Ms. Lewinsky
told the president that because they would not be able to see each
other every day, ``when I see you wearing this tie I'll know that I
am close to your heart.''
</P>
<P>
   On the day of her testimony, Clinton was inveighing against
handguns in a televised ceremony. Prosecutors apparently wondered,
Was the tie a sign, a plea for solidarity?
</P>
<P>
   If it was, it did not work. Ms. Lewinsky did not learn of
Clinton's choice of neckties until she turned on the television
that evening and saw a clip of him in the Rose Garden, her friends
said. That day, she had contradicted her sworn affidavit,
testifying that she and the president had had an affair in the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   The necktie was evidently covered by a subpoena sent to the
White House for gifts and other evidence by prosecutors for Starr.
But apparently it was not turned over by Clinton at that time.
</P>
<P>
   Clothing has become something of a leitmotif in Starr's
investigation. He has pursued a great deal of circumstantial
evidence in his investigation of Clinton, including gifts like a
T-shirt that he gave her. One of Starr's potentially strongest
pieces of evidence is a navy blue dress, bought at the Gap, that
Ms. Lewinsky turned over to prosecutors. They are having it tested
to determine whether it bears stains from a sexual encounter with
the president.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, during more than four hours of testimony at the White
House, prosecutors asked Clinton why he chose to wear that
particular tie on that particular day, one Clinton adviser said. An
ally of Clinton described the inquiry into neckwear as an example
of how the Starr investigation had gone rambling along irrelevant
and peculiar byways. ``The obstruction of justice stuff was kind of
goofy,'' one Clinton adviser said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The President was said to have smiled at the question and
expressed some bafflement. Perry-Mason-style, the prosecutors then
pulled out a photograph of the tie. Clinton was said to have
indicated that it was possible she had given it to him but that he
certainly was not trying to communicate anything by wearing it. The
exchange was said to have provided a rare light moment in a
grueling session.
</P>
<P>
   But the tie has meant a lot to Ms. Lewinsky, who has looked at
television reports to see if the president was wearing it. In June,
Ms. Lewinsky had noticed that Clinton had worn the tie she had
given him on three occasions in recent months: on the day he left
for his trip to China, the day he returned from China and several
days later, in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky had given Clinton six ties during their 18-month
relationship, which began in November 1995.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief speech on Monday night, Clinton contradicted his
previous denials and acknowledged that he had had a relationship
with Ms. Lewinsky that was ``not appropriate'' and ``wrong.'' That
night, Ms. Lewinsky's friends were dismayed that he seemed to send
her no signals whatsoever.
</P>
<P>
   He wore a patterned blue tie, of undetermined provenance.

FAIR, CLEAN PLAY NEEDS TO HAVE ITS ROOTS IN YOUTH

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Do a Mark Gastineau-style sack dance over a fallen quarterback
and an NFL referee flags you 15 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Start a bench-clearing brawl by playing the batter a little too
much chin music and a major-league baseball umpire will eject you
from the game. The commissioner's office will likely follow with
fines and suspensions.
</P>
<P>
   Turn a blind eye when one of your college athletes accepts perks
from an overzealous athletic booster and you risk serious sanctions
from the NCAA.
</P>
<P>
   Even the NHL will lock your skates in the cooler for five
minutes if you mix it up too vigorously on the ice.
</P>
<P>
   Sports, from the professional level down to youth leagues, has
volumes of on-field and off-field penalties for illegal play and
poor conduct. Yet, by most accounts, the wave of unsportsmanlike
behavior is on the rise. All those rules just don't seem to be
working.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have too many rules,'' argues William Shelton, former
chairman of the NCAA Committee on Sportsmanship and Ethical
Conduct. It has gotten to the point, Shelton says, where athletes
and coaches believe that if there is no rule specifically
prohibiting an act, it must be acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   Even when the penalties for misconduct are clear, however,
athletes, coaches, fans and administrators sometimes flaunt the
rules. They deem the consequences of their actions worth the risk,
or they simply ignore possible penalties in the heat of the moment.
</P>
<P>
   If more and tighter rules aren't the answer to better
sportsmanship, what then?
</P>
<P>
   Many sports figures concerned with the issue suggest the
solution lies at the roots _ with young athletes, who must be
taught right from wrong.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to sportsmanship, Hall of Fame basketball player
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar says, ``They have to have it explained to them
as children.''
</P>
<P>
   Abdul-Jabbar states that much of the unsportsmanlike behavior
seen today is ``human nature,'' with players simply acting in the
moment. But, he adds, it is critical that athletes, particularly
when they are young, are taught ``to channel that fury into
competing, rather than acting out.''
</P>
<P>
   Rangers manager Johnny Oates says: ``It's about respect, and
when you have a lack of respect, that leads to a lack of
sportsmanship. Two words that mean a lot to me are respect and
integrity, and that's what we need to be teaching our children.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to go at it directly at the youth level,'' agrees
Craig Clifford, who teaches philosophy at Tarleton State University
and is co-author of the book ``Coaching for Character (Reclaiming
the Principles of Sportsmanship)''.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other place you target,'' Clifford adds, ``is the colleges
because they're turning out all the high school coaches.''
</P>
<P>
   John Mackovic, former University of Texas football coach and
chairman of the American Football Coaches Association Ethics
Committee, agrees that coaching is critical.

   ``Young people watch everything we do and listen for everything
we say,'' Mackovic says. ``We are developing leaders through
athletics, and the lessons we teach are real. We need leadership
from coaches at all levels to take our profession to higher
standards of sportsmanship and ethical conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   The young athlete's parents also have an important role,
athletes say. For it is the parents, they say, who must show
children the way to behave in life and on the playing field.
</P>
<P>
   Says tennis great Chris Evert, ``It's called parenting.''
</P>
<P>
   The hope is that by teaching sportsmanship at the youth level, a
code of behavior will develop and spread through the high school
and college ranks and even into the pros as those children mature
and carry their values with them into adulthood.
</P>
<P>
   Just as unsportsmanlike behavior subtlety infiltrated ballparks
and field houses over the years, so, too, can good sportsmanship.
But, experts say, it must start at the youth level.
</P>
<P>
   Darrell J. Burnett, a clinical and sports psychologist who works
with troubled youth, calls youth sports, ``the last vestige of
sportsmanship,'' adding, ``We're living in an age where the
preservation of traditional values can no longer be taken for
granted. It's no different in the world of sports. The traditional
value of sportsmanship is being challenged from all sides.''
</P>
<P>
   It is necessary, Burnett says, ``to guide our youth, reminding
them what sportsmanship is all about, rewarding them for showing
good sportsmanship and showing, by our example, that sportsmanship
is still alive and valued in youth sports today.''
</P>
<P>
   Burnett suggests a 10-item checklist for youths trying to
practice good sportsmanship:
</P>
<P>
   1. Abide by the rules of the game.
</P>
<P>
   2. Avoid arguments.
</P>
<P>
   3. Share in the responsibilities of the team.
</P>
<P>
   4. Give everyone a chance to play according to the rules.
</P>
<P>
   5. Always play fair.
</P>
<P>
   6. Follow the directions of the coach.
</P>
<P>
   7. Respect the other team's effort.
</P>
<P>
   8. Offer encouragement to teammates.
</P>
<P>
   9. Accept the judgment calls of game officials.
</P>
<P>
   10. End the game smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   Burnett defines sportsmanship as winning without gloating,
losing without complaining, and treating opponents with respect.
</P>
<P>
   Young athletes, he says, must be taught to not make excuses or
pout when they commit a mistake in a game, or lose the game. They
also should be taught to encourage teammates who fail, rather than
criticize them, and to avoid embarrassing a defeated opponent.
</P>
<P>
   The National Alliance for Youth Sports, a Florida-based
nonprofit organization that trains and certifies volunteer youth
coaches, has issued separate sportsmanship challenges to coaches
and to parents of young athletes.
</P>
<P>
   One is a list of the top 10 warning signs of a bad volunteer
youth coach. According to the Alliance, the bad volunteer coach:
Stresses winning at all costs; doesn't let every child play equal
time; yells at officials and argues with opposing coaches;
encourages cheating to win the game; physically punishes players
for losing; and doesn't shake the hand of the opposing coach after
the game.
</P>
<P>
   The pushy parent is one who: pushes a child to sports success in
order to win an athletic scholarship; gets into game-related
arguments with other parents; compares the child's performance to
that of other children; and forces the child to practice at home.
</P>
<P>
   While a ``winning is the most important thing'' philosophy might
be acceptable at the professional level, it is not at the youth
level, says John R. Gerdy, a New York educational consultant and a
former sports ethics fellow of the Institute for International
Sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``Challenging the belief that the final score is all that
matters is not about tearing down an ideal,'' Gerdy has written.
``It is not about de-emphasizing or trivializing sport. It is not
about settling for mediocrity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is, however, about regaining perspective. It is about
refocusing on the primary reason for participation in athletics.''

COMMENTARY: STAIN OF THE NATION  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK RICH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was probably too much to hope that the first line of
President Clinton's address to the nation would be: ``Thank you for
tuning in to my presidential dialogue on race.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead we got a speech, at once mortifying and legalistically
hairsplitting, that proved one thing: People do not change their
character. The same can be said for the media, which spent two days
prior to Clinton's four-minute speech busily manufacturing
entertainment in the guise of ``news.''
</P>
<P>
   And so there was no catharsis on Monday, no big Shakespearean
emotions that follow a tragic fall. If Watergate gave us ``a
cancer'' on the presidency as its metaphor, Clintongate has given
us ``wiggle room.'' We don't feel like crying, and we don't feel
like laughing (the summer's best semen-stained farce, by popular
acclamation, remains ``There's Something About Mary''). We mainly
feel like taking a bath.
</P>
<P>
   Now we're trapped in Groundhog Day. We know the story is over:
the public told pollsters its denouement (yes he's a liar, no to
impeachment) weeks ago. But the sordid melody will repeat itself
with variations for two more years. Kenneth Starr's report will be
finessed by both Clinton and Congress. There will be no dialogue on
race, or Social Security, or anything else _ just a lame duck
running out a second-term clock. And you know what? The Republic,
if not the immediate political prospects of the Democratic Party,
will survive.
</P>
<P>
   The only real suspense is whether Starr has anything to show for
the non-erotic investigations he spent $30 million or so pursuing
for three-plus years (Castle Grande, anyone?) before being turned
on to sex by Linda Tripp in January, and whether Al Gore, who chose
to spend this week checking out global warming in Hawaii firsthand,
will return to face the campaign finance music on the mainland. In
Gore's absence, the de facto vice president has been Jesse Jackson,
whose bulletins to the press of his prayerful sessions with the
Clintons would be touching if they weren't so reminiscent of the
absolution bestowed on the disgraced Richard Nixon by the late,
great Rabbi Baruch Korff.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with the rest of the marathon pre-speech countdown on
television, at least Jackson's lamentations had some news content.
CNN posted a digital clock on screen ticking off the ``time
elapsed'' of the president's testimony _ a gesture to blood-sport
fans that not only was pointless but inaccurate, since the
testimony was interrupted by breaks. On MSNBC, a Newsweek
journalist did a wrap-up of politicians' bimbos past. On Fox, the
figure who is most emblematic of this whole story, Clintonian
toe-sucker turned thumb-sucking pundit Dick Morris, retailed
innuendo about Orrin Hatch. It was also on Fox that another
Newsweek writer's ruminations were framed by rapid-fire graphics on
the ``alleged'' scandals of every president, not excepting Taylor
(nepotism) and Pierce, Andrew Johnson and Grant (a trifecta of
alcoholism).
</P>
<P>
   Writing in The Los Angeles Times on Sunday, William Schneider
noted that in a new Gallup Poll the news media's 74 percent
disapproval rating had surpassed Starr's 58 percent to approach Ms.
Lewinsky's. ``In the public's view, the press is no different from
Monica,'' he wrote. ``They're all tramps!''
</P>
<P>
   It's days like Monday that have led to this pass. If the biggest
lie of 1998 has been ``I did not have sexual relations with that
woman,'' the second-biggest lie is a pious talking head on TV
saying some version of ``Oh how we hate covering this story about
the president's sexual relations with that woman.'' The tone of the
coverage has been orgiastic from the moment the pope was dumped in
Cuba; for every factual development there have been days of
prurient speculation and open longing for what in the porno biz is
called ``the money shot'' (the still-elusive dress). On Monday,
even when there was no information to be had about what was going
on in the White House Map Room, TV anchors interviewed each other
or replayed a recondite piece about cyber-optic cable rather than
devote appreciable air time to, say, the ongoing story in Northern
Ireland or even the non-erogenous Clinton scandals.
</P>
<P>
   This saga has soiled everyone who has touched it _ and I
certainly don't exclude myself. Only the bipartisan majority of the
American people, who have been crying ``Enough!'' for months now
and whose number easily dwarfs the Nielsen ratings of the All
Monica show, are clean.

 &HT;    Little Rock banking on public's fascination
 &HT;    (EDS: CORRECTS dateline.)
 &HT;    By Anne Rochell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Even if the Monica Lewinsky scandal proves to be
President Clinton's undoing, officials in his home state of
Arkansas said Tuesday they will carry on with plans for his
presidential library.
</P>
<P>
   Little Rock, which beat out 40 other Arkansas cities and towns
vying to be the library site, is busy buying land along the
Arkansas River and preparing the way for construction.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always been a voice of opposition out there to the
project,'' said City Manager Cy Carney. ``But the City Council has
been unanimous in its support, and they are not making moves to do
anything but continue moving forward on the project. Our view is
this is eight years of American history that we can have here in
Little Rock.''
</P>
<P>
   Max Brantley, editor of the weekly Arkansas Times, said no one
has given any serious thought to the idea of not having a
presidential library in Little Rock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Presidential libraries have become a staple of the 20th
century,'' he said. ``And no president has been more fascinating
than Bill Clinton, except maybe Kennedy _ I didn't say `good' but
`fascinating' _ so it's hard to see why a Bill Clinton presidential
library wouldn't hold interest.''
</P>
<P>
   An impeachment or resignation could delay the project, however,
Brantley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if he is driven from the presidency, it certainly, in
the short run, will put a damper on the project, and will make the
fund-raisers' task more difficult. Clinton would have to go into
seclusion for a while before he hit the banquet circuit.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the 26 acres needed for the library have been purchased and
cleared, private donations will cover the $100 million needed for
construction and the establishment of an endowment. Fund-raising
efforts are under way, both in and out of the state.
</P>
<P>
   Many residents expressed opposition to the City Council's
initial announcement that it would issue more than $16 million in
bonds for the project, but a financing plan passed in March. A
lawsuit has been filed by a group that opposes taxes, but Carney
called it a ``nuisance suit'' that he expects to be thrown out of
court any day now.
</P>
<P>
   The city of Little Rock is banking heavily on the library to
attract visitors and give a boost to the local economy, so killing
the project could prove disastrous.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very important economic development project,''
Carney said. ``We project 300,000 visitors a year into the library,
so it's a key part of our redevelopment effort downtown.''
</P>
<P>
   For a presidential library to come into being, the municipality
chosen by the president must buy and clear the land for
construction. Private donations then pay for construction. Finally,
the National Archives has to approve the library and agree to staff
and run it.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton reportedly is shopping for a high-profiled architect to
design the library, banking on his Hollywood connections to land
one.
</P>
<P>
   There are 11 presidential libraries in the United States, all
opened in this century. The first federally designated library was
Franklin Delano Roosevelt's in Hyde Park, N.Y. The most recent
opened in 1997 in Texas for George Bush. Only Richard Nixon's
library is not supported by the National Archives.

   RUSSIA SET TO REVIEW DEBT PLAN WITH BANKERS
</P>
<P>
   The Russian government delayed announcing its plan to change the
repayment terms on its debt, after alarm spread amoung foreign
bankers and investors that Russia was prepared to discriminate
against foreign creditors. Deputy Prime Minister Boris Fyodorov
said he would first review the plan with representatives of
Goldman, Sachs, J.P. Morgan and Deutsche Bank. Details of the
expected swap of treasury bills for longer-term securities, a key
element in Russia's program, may be released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   DELL SURPASSES EARNINGS ESTIMATES
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Dell Computer fell $1 Tuesday before the computer
maker reported that its second-quarter earnings exceeded analysts'
estimates. After the markets closed, Dell said profits jumped 62
percent attributing the increase to the strength of its direct
sales model, in which the company bypasses distributors and dealers
and builds each computer to order. The stock rose sharply in
after-hours trading.
</P>
<P>
   PROFITS STRONG AT MOST RETAILERS
</P>
<P>
   Some of the nation's biggest retailers reported
better-than-expected second-quarter earnings, but J.C. Penney had a
steep decline in the quarter in part because of weak department
store and catalog sales.
</P>
<P>
   KPMG TO EXPLORE SELLING A STAKE
</P>
<P>
   The accounting firm KPMG Peat Marwick plans to hire an
investment banker to consider selling between 20 percent and 30
percent of its consulting business to either an outside investor or
to the public through a stock offering.
</P>
<P>
   KORN FERRY PLANS PUBLIC OFFERING
</P>
<P>
   The executive search firm Korn Ferry International has filed for
an initial public offering, which it expects will raise $230
million.
</P>
<P>
   LATIN AMERICA'S DIMINISHED ALLURE
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks after Brazil's triumphant sale of the Telebras phone
giant to investors for almost $19 billion, shares in Latin
America's largest privatization have fallen sharply. The decline
reflects a broad retreat in all Latin stock markets, worsened by
the selloffs in Russia and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   PARTY BOSS SAYS NO BANk CLOSINGS
</P>
<P>
   Taku Yamasaki, a power broker in the Liberal Democratic Party,
was quoted as saying the Japanese government has decided to prevent
the failure of any major Japanese bank. If his assertion is true,
it would mark the kind of ambivalence that has plagued Japanese
policy makers over the debt-laden banking system. Many analysts
have suggested an orderly closure of one of Japan's big, troubled
banks would send a strong message that the government is serious
about finding a solution to the problems of its ailing banking
system. Toyota Motor and Nissan Motor said they had made payments
to a company that has figured in two recent arrests involving
accusations of extortion against Japan Airlines.
</P>

   FEDERAL-MOGUL BUYING PARTS UNIT

   TREASURY BOND YIELDS RISE SLIGHTLY
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond increased to 5.55 percent

policy makers, as expected, left interest rates unchanged.

 &HT;    Cost of fixing millennium bug will be gigantic
 &HT;    By Cynthia Mitchell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Metro Atlanta's largest companies are starting to firm
up the price tag for fixing the millennium computer bug _ and, more
importantly, they're letting shareholders in on it.
</P>
<P>
   And the price tag will be enormous. With just a relative handful
of Atlanta companies reporting so far, the total cost for fixing
the bug in this area is impossible to estimate. But, the highest
estimates from just those companies reporting is already more than
$700 million.
</P>
<P>
   In the seven business days after the Securities and Exchange
Commission issued new guidelines on what companies should disclose
about their Year 2000 problems, 10 of the 11 large metro Atlanta
companies reporting quarterly earnings revealed either how much
they expect to spend, how much they've already spent, or both.
(Coca-Cola Enterprises, the only one that didn't include dollar
figures, said it's fixing the problem through an ongoing systems
update and doesn't expect the incremental costs to be
``significant.'')
</P>
<P>
   When told of the response from the Atlanta companies, SEC
spokesman Duncan King said:
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow. It's amazing they've been that responsive. We didn't
think we were going to see things really improve until
mid-September, because companies have 45 days to put together their
10-Q reports after the close of their business quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem itself is extremely complex. Companies have to
figure out how many of their computer systems will become confused
by dates beginning in the Year 2000 _ a situation that could wreck
havoc on everything from traffic lights to hotel reservation
systems. Besides worrying about their own systems, they have to
reassure themselves that every outside system they deal with won't
mess things up. And then, in what's viewed as the most critical and
expensive part, they have to test and retest to make sure things
will run smoothly when the clock hits midnight on Dec. 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   So assigning a cost to the problem has been akin to nailing down
Jell-O. The most common U.S. total cost estimate has a wide swing _
from $300 billion to $600 billion to fix both corporate and
government systems.
</P>
<P>
   It's not much different locally.
</P>
<P>
   Take BellSouth Corp. The telecommunications giant has an
estimated Y2K cost with a high range that is double its lowest _
$100 million to $200 million.
</P>
<P>
   Most of that swing, which the company started reporting in the
first quarter, is pure safety margin, says spokesman Clay Owen. The
company has 30,000 desktop personal computers, 3,000 mainframe and
midrange computers and 2,500 voice switches instrumental in
carrying phone calls from place to place.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can be on schedule and on budget throughout the entire
life and then when you get to your critical testing, you've got to
intensify your efforts to make sure everything goes right,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Because the new SEC guidelines officially apply to earnings
reports filed after Aug. 5, the picture should only get clearer.
Moreover, as the weeks go by, companies simply are getting a
clearer fix on where they stand.
</P>
<P>
   That's the case at Delta Air Lines. It disclosed in May it
expects to spend $110 million to $125 million to fix its internal
information technology systems, but said it was still assessing its
operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the way our Year 2000 program is going, we should have a
much better handle on a lot of those details the SEC is looking for
within the time frame they've specified,'' said spokesman Kip
Smith. ``We're aiming to have all of our critical systems
completely analyzed and remediated by the end of this year and
completely tested by the middle of next year. So as we go through
the remediation process, we will know more'' about exact costs.

CAR THEFTS LEAD ISRAEL TO WALL OFF WEST BANK 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By DOUGLAS JEHL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ A record number of car thefts has persuaded Israel's
right-wing government to abandon its longtime opposition to
erecting any new barriers between Israel and the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government had resisted the
idea fiercely out of concern that such a line could be interpreted
as a demarcation of Israel's future border. But it has shifted
course in the face of public outcry over the disappearing cars,
some 46,000 of which were stolen in Israel last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli police have said that nearly all of those cars end
up in Palestinian-controlled areas of the West Bank, but they have
been unable to recover more than a small handful of them, and had
called for new barriers as the only sure way to sever favorite
escape routes.
</P>
<P>
   That idea had seemed to echo calls by left-wing legislators for
a permanent dividing line between Israel and the Arab land it
captured in the 1967 war, and police officials said that
Netanyahu's government _ which opposes the idea of a Palestinian
state _ had rejected the calls as recently as two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   But last weekend, Netanyahu's government finally approved a
partial version of the plan, authorizing some 50 miles of walls,
ditches and fences along stretches of the 194-mile Green Line,
which divided Israel and the West Bank before the 1967 war.
</P>
<P>
   Because the new barriers will not be continuous, aides to
Netanyahu have said they should not be perceived as representing a
de facto border. Israeli newspapers have also reported that the
barriers will be erected ``a few kilometers'' to the east of the
old Green Line, to signal the current government's insistence on
maintaining a security buffer across the old border even under a
permanent peace accord with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the move has inspired taunts from Israeli leftists,
including Yossi Sarid, head of the Meretz Party, who described the
decision to build the new barriers as the ``last nail in the coffin
of the illusion called the Greater Land of Israel.'' That is a term
used by the most extreme among Israeli conservatives to claim
Israeli sovereignty over the West Bank and Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of separation has long found strong backing among the
Israeli public, with as many as 85 percent of people polled saying
that they favor the idea of a complete separation between Israel
and Palestinian-ruled territory.
</P>
<P>
   The idea has gained in support as the number of reported car
thefts in Israel soared to a record last year. The Israeli police
have said that as many as 80 percent of the stolen vehicles end up
in the West Bank after either passing across open fields or through
Israeli checkpoints, where soldiers usually scrutinize only
vehicles heading into Israel.
</P>
<P>
   In the first half of this year, according to police officials,
the Israeli police and their Palestinian counterparts launched 56
different anti-theft operations and arrested nearly 200 suspected
car thieves. But they have been able to recover only about 450
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   As part of new crime-fighting efforts, the Israeli police have
already assigned special squads of border police to try to
intercept suspected car thieves before they pass into
Palestinian-controlled areas. But the police have said that task
will become much easier if the traffic can be funneled into a
manageable number of choke points, with the remote crossing points
sealed with the construction of the new barriers.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials have said that the cost of the plan could
amount to more than $25 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   The approval of the initiative comes at a time of little
apparent progress in Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations, which
have been stalled for months over the extent of Israel's further
withdrawal of troops from the West Bank. The last high-level talks
between the two sides took place more than three weeks ago. In that
lull, both Netanyahu and Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader,
have once again asked Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to
intervene in an attempt to break the deadlock, but American
officials have said that the two sides must first make more
progress toward mending their divide.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Palestinian officials have criticized the idea of
building barriers between Israeli and Palestinian land, saying that
the only certain effect would be to make it easier for the Israeli
authorities to bar Palestinians from reaching jobs in Israeli
territory.
</P>
<P>
   In the current atmosphere, however, Jibril Rajoub, the
Palestinian chief of the Preventive Security Service in the West
Bank, has issued a clear endorsement of Netanyahu's decision.
Rajoub was quoted by Reuters as saying: ``I am for the separation
between them and us so that we can have our land.''

COMMENTARY: STAIN OF THE NATION  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating to add CLINTON to slug)   By FRANK RICH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was probably too much to hope that the first line of
President Clinton's address to the nation would be: ``Thank you for
tuning in to my presidential dialogue on race.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead we got a speech, at once mortifying and legalistically
hairsplitting, that proved one thing: People do not change their
character. The same can be said for the media, which spent two days
prior to Clinton's four-minute speech busily manufacturing
entertainment in the guise of ``news.''
</P>
<P>
   And so there was no catharsis on Monday, no big Shakespearean
emotions that follow a tragic fall. If Watergate gave us ``a
cancer'' on the presidency as its metaphor, Clintongate has given
us ``wiggle room.'' We don't feel like crying, and we don't feel
like laughing (the summer's best semen-stained farce, by popular
acclamation, remains ``There's Something About Mary''). We mainly
feel like taking a bath.
</P>
<P>
   Now we're trapped in Groundhog Day. We know the story is over:
the public told pollsters its denouement (yes he's a liar, no to
impeachment) weeks ago. But the sordid melody will repeat itself
with variations for two more years. Kenneth Starr's report will be
finessed by both Clinton and Congress. There will be no dialogue on
race, or Social Security, or anything else _ just a lame duck
running out a second-term clock. And you know what? The Republic,
if not the immediate political prospects of the Democratic Party,
will survive.
</P>
<P>
   The only real suspense is whether Starr has anything to show for
the non-erotic investigations he spent $30 million or so pursuing
for three-plus years (Castle Grande, anyone?) before being turned
on to sex by Linda Tripp in January, and whether Al Gore, who chose
to spend this week checking out global warming in Hawaii firsthand,
will return to face the campaign finance music on the mainland. In
Gore's absence, the de facto vice president has been Jesse Jackson,
whose bulletins to the press of his prayerful sessions with the
Clintons would be touching if they weren't so reminiscent of the
absolution bestowed on the disgraced Richard Nixon by the late,
great Rabbi Baruch Korff.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with the rest of the marathon pre-speech countdown on
television, at least Jackson's lamentations had some news content.
CNN posted a digital clock on screen ticking off the ``time
elapsed'' of the president's testimony _ a gesture to blood-sport
fans that not only was pointless but inaccurate, since the
testimony was interrupted by breaks. On MSNBC, a Newsweek
journalist did a wrap-up of politicians' bimbos past. On Fox, the
figure who is most emblematic of this whole story, Clintonian
toe-sucker turned thumb-sucking pundit Dick Morris, retailed
innuendo about Orrin Hatch. It was also on Fox that another
Newsweek writer's ruminations were framed by rapid-fire graphics on
the ``alleged'' scandals of every president, not excepting Taylor
(nepotism) and Pierce, Andrew Johnson and Grant (a trifecta of
alcoholism).
</P>
<P>
   Writing in The Los Angeles Times on Sunday, William Schneider
noted that in a new Gallup Poll the news media's 74 percent
disapproval rating had surpassed Starr's 58 percent to approach Ms.
Lewinsky's. ``In the public's view, the press is no different from
Monica,'' he wrote. ``They're all tramps!''
</P>
<P>
   It's days like Monday that have led to this pass. If the biggest
lie of 1998 has been ``I did not have sexual relations with that
woman,'' the second-biggest lie is a pious talking head on TV
saying some version of ``Oh how we hate covering this story about
the president's sexual relations with that woman.'' The tone of the
coverage has been orgiastic from the moment the pope was dumped in
Cuba; for every factual development there have been days of
prurient speculation and open longing for what in the porno biz is
called ``the money shot'' (the still-elusive dress). On Monday,
even when there was no information to be had about what was going
on in the White House Map Room, TV anchors interviewed each other
or replayed a recondite piece about cyber-optic cable rather than
devote appreciable air time to, say, the ongoing story in Northern
Ireland or even the non-erogenous Clinton scandals.
</P>
<P>
   This saga has soiled everyone who has touched it _ and I
certainly don't exclude myself. Only the bipartisan majority of the
American people, who have been crying ``Enough!'' for months now
and whose number easily dwarfs the Nielsen ratings of the All
Monica show, are clean.

 &HT;    Commentary: Easy cure for Clinton: Wear mitts
 &HT;    By John Kelso
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ If busy hands are happy hands, then Bill
``Pinocchio'' Clinton's fingers must be about half giddy.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that I don't like Clinton. It's just that he has this
problem with what to do with his hands. I suffered from the same
dilemma when I quit smoking 10 years ago. But at least with me it
didn't lead to the condition Clinton suffers from.
</P>
<P>
   I speak, of course, of the dreaded grabitis. Many people aren't
familiar with the heartbreak of grabitis and, therefore, aren't
sympathetic to grabitis sufferers.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there are probably many of y'all, because of a
misunderstanding of this condition, who figure the president should
get 99 years in the electric chair. Or belted over the head with a
rolling pin by his old lady.
</P>
<P>
   But I realize grabitis is treatable. So I don't think Bill
Clinton should be impeached. Instead, I say he should be sentenced
to a cold shower three times a day, or perhaps a daily dip in Lake
Michigan during winter.
</P>
<P>
   The other thing that could be done to cure the president would
be to make him wear a pair of huge barbecue mitts 24 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   This is a practical solution to the matter. That way, when he
saw a zipper he figured needed tending to, his hands would be tied.
</P>
<P>
   Is this a great idea or what? If the president had to constantly
wear a pair of enormous barbecue mitts, and some 21-year-old intern
showed up, she would be perfectly safe.
</P>
<P>
   Let's run a little test here, and you'll see what I mean. Put on
a huge pair of barbecue mitts and try to undo your pants. See? You
can't do it. Suddenly you are being held prisoner by your own
pants.
</P>
<P>
   And, if you couldn't undo your own pants, you wouldn't be able
to undo anybody else's pants, either.
</P>
<P>
   I think the barbecue mitts should be a bright orange so Clinton
would be easy for Hillary to spot, in case he began wandering.
</P>
<P>
   Another plus to this program?
</P>
<P>
   It's real tough to pick up chicks when you're wearing barbecue
mitts, because it doesn't look cool. This is why you hardly ever
see Kappa Sigs in expensive sports cars driving around wearing
these items.
</P>
<P>
   I know what you're thinking.
</P>
<P>
   You're thinking, ``Kelso, you large derriere of a horse. This
program wouldn't work because it would create a major embarrassment
for this great land of ours.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine having a U.S. president at state functions showing up
with a pair of barbecue mitts on.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would look funny on the Ted Koppel show, not to mention
in front of the Queen of England.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, well, so what? At least it would keep the president from
trying to give the queen a hickey. Also, Clinton could talk his way
around the embarrassment part.
</P>
<P>
   Let's say the ambassador of Togo shows up for a state dinner at
the White House, and he finds Bill Clinton dressed in a pair of
orange barbecue mitts.
</P>
<P>
   The president could explain his way out of this one by saying
he's fixing to grill some dogs.
</P>
<P>
   You know Hillary would go for it, because she could allow the
president to roam the grounds unattended.

COMMENTARY: SATURDAY NIGHT BILL  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By MAUREEN DOWD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ We are deep into psychobabble.
</P>
<P>
   Do we have closure, healing, catharsis? Are Bill and Hillary
Clinton still in denial? Is the first lady an enabler? Is her anger
at Kenneth Starr and the press simply transference? Through
confrontation, has the president broken his pattern of recovery and
loss, of compulsive, addictive, destructive behavior?
</P>
<P>
   Are we ready to give our bad boy in the White House a hug?
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton is the Grand Canyon of need. He can never stay
focused for long on running the country and the world because it
gets in the way of his favorite pastime, a warped little mind game
called ``How Much Do You Love Me?''
</P>
<P>
   The wild-child president enjoys dipping into his dark side _
``Saturday Night Clinton,'' Dick Morris calls it _ and engaging in
the sort of hooliganism that requires everyone around him to make
soul-wrenching compromises.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than tell the truth about a cheesy office affair seven
months ago, he dragged Washington and America into a stupid, phony
war. It's not a war about ideology or principles or privacy rights,
although the Clintons like to cast it that way. It's a war about
how much Bill Clinton can get away with and still keep our
affection. He's constantly testing the limits of our love.
</P>
<P>
   He wants to know if his aides and advisers will lie for him,
lose their good names for him, accrue legal bills for him, be saps
for him.
</P>
<P>
   Believe it or not, I remember a time when Ann Lewis was
respected as a straight shooter.
</P>
<P>
   To save his skin, the president forced government lawyers into
brawls that have forever weakened the White House and Secret
Service.
</P>
<P>
   He used Madeleine Albright and Donna Shalala to give him
feminist cover, and let them foolishly parade in front of the
cameras to declare their fealty.
</P>
<P>
   He turned feminists who fought so hard against Clarence Thomas
and Bob Packwood into risible hypocrites. He would give them
progressive public policies for women if they defended him on
regressive private behavior with women.
</P>
<P>
   Women in Congress who had stuck with Clinton through his seven
months of living dangerously were furious about Monica on Tuesday.
``It's the grossest kind of infidelity,'' one told me, ``just sheer
constant physical relief and satisfaction, really using in the
crudest way somebody who was obviously extraordinarily gullible and
obviously madly in love with him, somebody who would have done
anything for him, and doing this in the Oval Office. I'm having a
very hard time with it. I don't want to be an enabler.''
</P>
<P>
   The president gave his loyal, accomplished wife a choice between
the two roles she most dreads: victim or liar. Either this
superbrainy lawyer and strategist did not know her husband was
lying, making our most modern first lady a dupe in the oldest story
in the world. Or she did know, meaning that she lied when she
defended him on the ``Today'' show.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton presented a searing Hobson's choice to his lovely
daughter. She dutifully blessed him with her protection, holding
his hand on the way to the helicopter Tuesday, even though he
humiliated her mother with a girl close to her own age.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons attack Starr to deflect attention from the
president's immoral behavior. They appeal to decent American
impulses _ we do not like lynch mobs, we do not like
hate-mongering, we do not like women who rat out girl friends, we
do not like Big Brother peeking through bedroom windows. The
Clintons elicit our public-spirited impulses and use them for their
private political gain.
</P>
<P>
   But the choices they ask us to make are false ones.
</P>
<P>
   You can think the notion of impeachment is ludicrous and still
think that Clinton has acted with monstrous selfishness.
</P>
<P>
   You can think Starr's investigation has been scary and still
believe that a president should tell Americans the truth at the
first opportunity, not the last.
</P>
<P>
   You can think Linda Tripp rides on a broomstick and still
believe that a president should not ask an intern to service him.
</P>
<P>
   By expecting others to sacrifice so much to preserve his
political viability, Clinton has killed something worthy and
important in public life.
</P>
<P>
   All this carnage, and for what? To cover up some seamy
sexcapades?
</P>
<P>
   His game has grown exhausting. How much do we love him?
</P>
<P>
   Not THAT much.

8 SUICIDES UNDER OREGON'S DEATH WITH DIGNITY ACT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Oregon officials announced Tuesday that eight people
in the state had died after taking lethal medications prescribed
under the law allowing doctor-assisted suicide for terminally ill
people, which took effect last November.
</P>
<P>
   Two other people who were certified as terminally ill and who
had received state authorization to take the drugs died before
doing so, according to a report released by the Oregon Health
Division.
</P>
<P>
   The state law, officially known as the Death with Dignity Act,
is the only one in the nation allowing doctor-assisted suicide.
While advocates for the practice view the law as a potential
bellwether for other states that have considered similar measures,
opponents have fiercely criticized the Oregon law and fought _ so
far successfully _ against its adoption elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's report, the first to detail deaths under the law, was
described as a ``tragic development'' by a spokesman for the
state's Catholic Conference, but supporters said the relatively
small number of deaths disproved predictions by church leaders and
other opponents that the law would be abused or that sick people
would flock to their doctors to end their lives.
</P>
<P>
   The Oregon law applies to an adult of sound mind who has, in the
opinion of two doctors, less than six months to live. Doctors may
prescribe but not administer the lethal dose. Those wishing to die
fill out and sign a single-page form, titled, ``Request for
medication to end my life in a humane and dignified manner.''
</P>
<P>
   While no names of the 10 deceased people were included in
Tuesday's report, the report included a number of statistics that
offered a stark glimpse into legally assisted suicide, including
these:
</P>
<P>
   _ Five were men and five were women.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cancer was the underlying illness in nine of the 10 cases,
while the 10th person suffered from heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   _ The average age at death was 71.
</P>
<P>
   _ All received a medical evaluation by at least two doctors to
confirm their terminal condition, and their doctors judged each to
be capable of making and communicating health-care decisions, as
required by the law. All complied with the 15-day waiting period
between the first and second requests for the lethal drugs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Eight of the 10 had more than a high-school education.
</P>
<P>
   _ Of the eight who actually took lethal medication, the wait
between acquiring the prescription and death ranged from less than
a day to 16 days. The average wait was two days.
</P>
<P>
   _ The eight who who took the drugs died within seven hours of
doing so; the average time before death was 40 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The Oregon Health Division said Tuesday that it was conducting
in-depth interviews with the doctors involved in assisting or
attending the suicides, and that a more extensive report covering
all cases under the Death with Dignity Act would be made public
early next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are releasing this preliminary summary to inform the public
and those concerned about ethical, legal and medical aspects of the
act,'' said Dr. Katrina Hedberg, medical epidemiologist for the
division. But the law had confidentiality provisions that
explicitly prohibited the state from releasing many other details
of the suicides, she added. ``Release of more specific information
at this time would jeopardize this guarantee of protection,''
Hedberg said.
</P>
<P>
   The Oregon law was originally approved in a 1994 vote on a
narrow 51-49 percentage by state residents, but was promptly put on
hold by a series of court battles. The fight seemed to have been
settled last year, when Oregon voters, this time by a 60 percent to
40 percent majority, turned back a measure to repeal the law.
</P>
<P>
   A new wrinkle quickly developed when federal drug-enforcement
officials threatened to impose severe sanctions on any doctor who
prescribed suicide drugs, the Oregon law notwithstanding. But
Attorney General Janet Reno removed that obstacle in June,
effectively overruling the drug officials by declaring that no such
prosecutions would take place.

   Commentary: Clinton's scripted lies
</P>
<P>
   By Rowland Nethaway
</P>
<P>
   c: 1998 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ President Clinton's five-minute televised address
to the nation was an admission that he lied about having sex with a
White House intern, sort of.
</P>
<P>
   He apologized, nearly.
</P>
<P>
   He accepted responsibility, maybe.
</P>
<P>
   To say that Bill Clinton lies is like saying the Houdini
performed tricks.
</P>
<P>
   Both characterizations are woefully inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Clinton lies. It's in his nature. Scorpions sting.
Clinton lies.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton lies with practiced style. When it comes to lying,
Clinton is one of the best.
</P>
<P>
   In the same way a smooth bunko artist is respected by the
police, Clinton's ability to lie has earned the respect of his
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   One-time Democratic presidential candidate U.S. Sen. Bob Kerrey
of Nebraska once remarked in awestruck admiration, ``Clinton's an
unusually good liar. Unusually good. Do you realize that?''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently few Americans realized or cared.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later another war hero and Clinton opponent again
tried to warn Americans. ``Wake up, America,'' said Republican
presidential candidate U.S. Sen. Bob Dole. Clinton, he said,
``tells you one thing and does precisely the other, time after time
after time.''
</P>
<P>
   Political opponent Ross Perot doesn't sound quite so goofy now
that Hillary has blamed her husband's troubles on a vast
right-wing, anti-Arkansas conspiracy. Perot warned that a Clinton
second term would become ``a second Watergate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody believes he slept with this tootsie and lied about
it,'' said former New York mayor Ed Koch six months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Koch evidently has seen his share of slick confidence men
because everybody did not believe that the president of the United
States could really go on national television, look the American
public straight in the eye and lie through his teeth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not . . . have . . . sexual relations with that woman,
Miss Lewinsky,'' Clinton said on Jan. 26, looking stern and sincere
and waving an index finger for added effect.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Koch, many loyal Democrats and credulous Americans took
Clinton at his word.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton reinforced his televised denial with private eye-to-eye
conversations with his cabinet members, staff and closest
supporters. He said the accusations against him were lies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four days ago,'' one frustrated Clinton friend told the New
York Times, ``the president told me he never had sex with Monica.''
That was shortly before Clinton went on television to admit that he
had sex with Monica, sort of.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton never really said they had sex. He said they had
``inappropriate'' conduct. The word ``inappropriate'' was chosen
because Clinton emphatically told reporters in January that he did
not have an ``improper'' relationship with Lewinsky _ a lubricated
lie.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's habit of manipulating and misleading people for his
benefit now is aided and abetted by professional manipulators of
make believe.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's Jan. 26 finger-wagging denial speech was produced with
the expert help of Harry Thomason, Clinton's wealthy Hollywood
friend.
</P>
<P>
   Thomason polished Clinton's script and delivery so the president
could fool as many Americans from the White House as Thomason can
fool from Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Americans now know that the Jan. 26 denial speech was an acting
job and an Oscar-quality lie.
</P>
<P>
   In his Monday night televised White House contrition speech,
Clinton again asks the American people to believe him. Standing off
camera was Thomason and another Hollywood make-believe executive
watching their performer deliver another polished acting job.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has turned the White House into an X-rated movie set.
The nation deserves a better leading man.

   WASHINGTON _ Prosecutors opened a new line of inquiry into
President Clinton's actions on Tuesday, summoning Monica Lewinsky
to testify again to the federal grand jury here on Thursday. It was
one of several signs that President Clinton did not end his legal
or political troubles by acknowledging an intimate relationship
with her.
</P>
<P>
   The move to bring Ms. Lewinsky back to the grand jury reflected
a decision by the Whitewater independent counsel, Kenneth Starr, to
play off her testimony against the president's to see if there are
inconsistencies, according to people familiar with his strategy.
</P>
<P>
   That approach, a classic prosecutorial tactic, indicated that
Starr was trying to determine whether Clinton might have perjured
himself before the grand jury, a new approach in an investigation
that has already lasted seven months.
</P>
<P>
   New details emerged on Tuesday about what was described as a
warlike exchange during the president's testimony on Monday, which
was transmitted to the grand jury here. Although Clinton politely
shook hands with prosecutors before and after they squared off, the
questioning turned confrontational, with Starr threatening at
points to subpoena the president for further testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton declined to answer some of the prosecutors' questions
about the details of his sexual contact with Ms. Lewinsky. His
private lawyers signaled an end to the four-hour session before
Starr and his team had finished.
</P>
<P>
   While he acknowledged an intimate relationship with Ms.
Lewinsky, Clinton denied under oath, as he did later in his address
to the nation, that he had obstructed justice, lawyers said.
Specifically, they said, he testified that he had not asked his
personal secretary, Betty Currie, to retrieve from Ms. Lewinsky
some gifts that he had given her.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's private attorney, David Kendall, said on Tuesday that
the president did not decline to answer any questions about
possible obstruction of justice. ``As to a very few highly
intrusive questions with respect to the specifics of his relation
to Ms. Lewinsky, he gave candid but not detailed answers,'' Kendall
said. ``This was to preserve personal privacy and institutional
dignity.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Clinton family, the White House staff, and the country
began on Tuesday to absorb Monday's extraordinary events, friends
of Ms. Lewinsky, like many Republican and Democratic officeholders
here, expressed disappointment with the president's speech. They
said that the president should have apologized directly to Ms.
Lewinsky and her family for his role in shoving them into a
maelstrom of legal and media scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's four-minute address left even some Democrats
complaining on Tuesday that he fell short of an apology and spoke
more in anger than in sorrow. Some said that they would have to
await a report by Starr to Congress before deciding whether the
matter should be set aside without impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Hand in hand in hand, Clinton, his wife, Hillary, and their
daughter, Chelsea, strolled to a helicopter on the South Lawn on
Tuesday afternoon and departed for a twelve-day vacation on
Martha's Vineyard. Aides to the president said that he would
probably interrupt his trip for at least two public events, putting
into practice his argument Monday night that it was time to turn
from the investigation to ``important work.''
</P>
<P>
   Before departing on Tuesday, Clinton spent more than an hour
with his foreign policy advisers, and also worked the telephone.
His advisers said that he was mostly fielding supportive calls from
friends on Capitol Hill and elsewhere.

EX-KLANSMAN AGAIN ON TRIAL FOR ORDERING 1966 MURDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RICK BRAGG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HATTIESBURG, Miss. _ In the first day of testimony in the murder
trial of the aging former Ku Klux Klan leader accused of ordering
the firebombing that killed her husband, Ellie Dahmer described
that chilly night in 1966 when she woke up to the blaring of a car
horn at 2 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   There had been threats before against her husband, Vernon
Dahmer, a storekeeper who angered the Klan when he offered his shop
as a place that blacks could pay their poll tax and register to
vote. But this time, as the masked Klansmen outside in the dark
rushed into their yard carrying gallon jugs of gasoline, she sensed
that her worst fear had come true.
</P>
<P>
   ``I yelled for Vernon to get up,'' said Mrs. Dahmer, looking
down from the witness chair on the defendant, Sam Bowers, once a
feared leader of Klan activity in Mississippi, now 73, who
prosecutors believe ordered the burning of the Dahmers' home in the
Kelly Settlement community outside Hattiesburg in Forrest County.
She testified that she told her waking husband that, ``I believe
they got us this time.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the fifth time Bowers has been tried in connection with
Dahmer's death; the others ended in hung juries. Mrs. Dahmer,
fighting to keep her composure, told the jury Tuesday that she saw
her husband fire a shotgun over and over out a window as he shouted
for her to leave him, to take their two children out the back door.
She told the jurors how he kept firing as the flames from that
burning house burned into his arms.
</P>
<P>
   But what she could not say was that she saw Bowers there, among
the two carloads of Klansmen who rumbled up to their home armed
with shotguns and the 12 gallons of gasoline on Jan. 10, 1966.
``No,'' she said, when asked by defense lawyer Travis Buckley if
she saw Bowers take part in the crime. ``I didn't see him.''
</P>
<P>
   And that _ linking a man who was nowhere near the crime scene _
is the challenge that prosecutors face here in this historic old
courthouse, in an antiquated courtroom where the jury sits in the
middle of the room on the elevated jury stand, to decide Bowers'
fate.
</P>
<P>
   Bowers was not even in the Hattiesburg area that day, though law
enforcement officers who have tracked the case off and on for three
decades have said he was the driving force behind it. He helped
plan it in detail, and gave the word to go ahead when all was
ready, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This cowardly attack was ordered by Sam Bowers,'' said Bob
Helfrich, an assistant district attorney who is prosecuting the
case, in his opening statements.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Bowers' lawyer, Buckley, dismissed the new trial as
``media-orchestrated prosecution.''
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to link him, directly, to the murder and arson failed
in the past, as all-white juries could not reach verdicts. But
racism, more than any lack of lack of evidence, decided those
trials, Dahmers' family believes.
</P>
<P>
   All day Tuesday, people with gray in their hair _ both Dahmer
family members and now aged investigators who were at the crime
scene as it smoldered the morning after _ filed into the witness
stand, to talk about things they saw as children or very young men.
</P>
<P>
   It is fitting, spectators and lawyers agreed, that this case
from the past be decided in this setting, which looks more like a
scene from ``To Kill a Mockingbird.'' But while the courtroom is
something out of the past, much has changed outside that courtroom
that leaves prosecutors hopeful that this time, the outcome will be
different.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Bowers faces a jury of six blacks, five whites and
one Asian. The very thing Dahmer died for _ working to register
blacks to vote _ would one day lead to this diverse jury. Only
registered voters are summoned to jury pools, and at the time of
his murder, all-male, all-white juries often decided the fates of
blacks in Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors on Wednesday are expected to produce witnesses,
including at least one ex-Klansman who will testify, prosecutors
say, that Bowers was the mastermind of the crime. One of them is
former Klansman Billy Roy Pitts, who pleaded guilty to murder and
arson charges in connection with the killing. Three other men were
convicted in the killing.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday, what the courtroom did most was relive the past.
</P>
<P>
   Dahmer was not a nationally known civil rights figure like
Medgar Evers, whose killer, Byron de la Beckwith, was finally
convicted in Jackson in 1994, three decades after the 1963 murder.
(It was the success of that case, along with some new evidence,
that helped prompt prosecutors here to re-open the Dahmer
investigation.)
</P>
<P>
   Dahmer was a family man, storekeeper and local official with the
NAACP, who thought that allowing blacks to pay their $2 poll tax _
in itself a device intended by segregationists to hold down black
voters _ at his store would encourage them. They trusted him.
</P>
<P>
   Bowers was a businessman in Laurel, a small town near
Hattiesburg, and in 1964 had founded and become Imperial Wizard of
the White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, an organization linked to 10
murders, church burnings, assaults, and jury tamperings _ Klansmen
were believed to have contacted jurors in at least one of Bowers'
pervious trials in the late 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said he became angry when Dahmer began encouraging
blacks to register, and ordered his death. His murderers even went
through ``dry runs'' in which they rehearsed the killing, case
investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   It was never intended to just frighten the Dahmer family, but to
remove a local civil rights leader who had become troublesome,
prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   As the jugs of gasoline crashed through the windows, Dahmer
reached for the 12-gauge shotgun and revolver that he always kept
loaded, for a night such as this.
</P>
<P>
   He told his wife to get the children outside, ``while I hold
them off.''
</P>
<P>
   But the house was already engulfed. Their two sons tumbled out a
back window to safety, but a 10-year-old daughter, Bettie, had
already been burned on her arms and forehead by the time they all
made it outside. Mrs. Dahmer said she looked up to see her husband
there with her. He handed her their daughter, then went back to the
front of the house.
</P>
<P>
   As the flames engulfed him, he continued to fire the shotgun, as
masked men flashed through the yard.
</P>
<P>
   His daughter, Bettie Dahmer, then 10, recalled seeing him later,
sitting outside, ``with his skin hanging from his arms.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He never complained,'' she said from the witness stand. ``He
just wanted to know if we were all right.''
</P>
<P>
   The flames had seared his lungs. He died 12 hours later in a
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``I moved my chair around so that I could look at his face,''
said his widow, Mrs. Dahmer, of her husband's last moments. ``The
next thing I know he yells my name, he yells my name and fell back
into my arms,'' and died.
</P>
<P>
   Their home, car and the adjoining store were in ashes. An
elderly aunt, who had been in the store, barely escaped.
</P>
<P>
   Bowers did do prison time for his role in that violent era. He
served six years in prison for his behind-the-scenes role in the
much more highly publicized 1966 murders of three civil rights
workers, Michael Scheerner, James Chaney and Andrew Goodman.
</P>
<P>
   But he has not done time in connection with Dahmer's case. Until
his arrest last May on murder and arson charges, he had lived
modestly in a predominantly black section of Laurel, owner of a
video business.
</P>
<P>
   Most of his neighbors, apparently, did not even know he had
links to the Klan.
</P>
<P>
   But over the years, his family never stopped pushing for a
re-trial. Bettie Dahmer said she just wants his father ``to have
justice,'' no matter how long the wait.

UN SAYS IRAQ WILL HAVE MORE TO SPEND ON FOOD AND MEDICINE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By PAUL LEWIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ As Iraqi President Saddam Hussein continues to
defy arms inspectors and demand an end to the eight-year trade
embargo against his nation, the United Nations said Tuesday that
Iraq would have more money to spend on imported food and
humanitarian supplies this year than at any time since sanctions
began.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein's recent conduct makes it unlikely that the Security
Council will want to lift that embargo anytime soon, and the money
will be less than he had sought. But U.N. members also recognize
that public support for continued sanctions would rapidly evaporate
unless the harshest effects on ordinary Iraqis are mitigated by
allowing Iraq to sell some of its oil for food and other
necessities.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council introduced the ``oil for food'' program in
April 1995, allowing Iraq to sell a designated quantity of oil
under U.N. supervision every six months. Part of the oil money is
used to compensate victims of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, and to pay
the arms inspectors' costs.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of May, Iraq was authorized by the Security Council
to sell $5.2 billion worth of oil during the subsequent six months,
but it has only managed to sell $1.06 billion worth of oil because
of weak world demand and the damaged state of its oil industry.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, oil experts have warned the United Nations that the
country is unlikely to be able to raise more than $2.5 billion to
$3 billion during the current six month period.
</P>
<P>
   This means that if the United Nations is to succeed in its
objective of raising the nutritional value of the food ration each
Iraqi receives from the government from 2,030 calories a day in
1997 _ regarded as about the minimum for healthy living _ to 2,268
calories this year, it will need to allocate more money to food and
less to other humanitarian needs like medicine and health care.
</P>
<P>
   While two thirds of the money raised from oil sales is available
for buying food and other humanitarian goods, another 30 percent
goes into the Kuwait compensation fund and the remainder is spent
on the arms inspectors and administrative expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Because of weak oil world prices, Iraq is currently getting an
average price of only $9 to $10 a barrel for its oil compared with
$19 to $20 when it first started selling oil under the program in
December 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But another important factor, officials say, is the time it is
taking for Iraq to order, receive and install the $300 million
worth of spare parts that the Security Council allowed it to buy
last June to repair damage done to its oil industry by the Persian
Gulf war and the trade embargo.
</P>
<P>
   Officials point out, though, that raising between $2.5 billion
and $3 billion by the end of November will still give it
substantially more than the $2 billion it has been allowed to earn
during each of the three previous six month periods since May 1996.
That was when Iraq finally accepted the Security Council's oil for
food offer, 13 months after it was made.
</P>
<P>
   When it more than doubled the size of the program in May, the
Security Council acknowledged that its previous $2 billion limit
every half year was insufficient to provide Iraq with the level of
humanitarian imports needed to halt the catastrophic decline in
living standards Iraqis were suffering under the trade embargo.
</P>
<P>
   According to U.N. figures released Tuesday, Iraq has imported
6.5 million tons of food and $330 million worth of medical goods
since the first shipments under the program in March 1997.

 &HT;    American takes off after Southwest's customers
 &HT;    By R. Michelle Breyer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ American Airlines is still two weeks away from
taking off with new service between Austin and Dallas and Houston,
but already it's waging a war of words with rival Southwest
Airlines, the biggest carrier at Robert Mueller Municipal Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Starting Aug. 31, American will offer 14 daily flights between
Austin and Love Field in Dallas, where Southwest is based. On Sept.
9, the airline will start three daily flights between Austin and
Houston Hobby.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, American mailed tens of thousands of postcards to
American frequent flier members in Austin, Dallas and Houston,
offering them 2,500 extra miles for every five segments they fly
between Austin and either Dallas Love Field or Houston Hobby
between Aug. 31 and Dec. 15. The airline's top-tier frequent fliers
are being offered additional inducements to fly the routes.
</P>
<P>
   The airline also has launched a newspaper advertising campaign
in the three cities, using the theme ``To Austin with Love.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We know there are competitors in the marketplace, but we fully
expect to capture our share,'' said American spokes man Tim Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said the airline's sales staff also is meeting with travel
agencies to let them know abut the new service, touting the
differences between American and Southwest _ reserved and
first-class seating and the broader scope of its frequent flier
program.
</P>
<P>
   The Fort Worth-based airline currently offers jet service only
to Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport and Houston's George
Bush Intercontinental Airport, rather than the two urban-area
airports.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly 20 years, the Wright Amendment has restricted service
at Love Field, just north of downtown Dallas, to flights to and
from other Texas cities and four adjoining states _ Arkansas,
Louisiana, Oklahoma and New Mexico. The law was designed to
decrease competition for D/FW and to increase air safety between
the two airports. But last year, Congress added three more states
that can be served from Love Field: Alabama, Kansas and
Mississippi, prompting airlines like American to take notice.
</P>
<P>
   Some airline analysts said they think American will become a
major player in the market between Austin and Dallas and Houston _
a market long dominated by Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   ``American Airlines can do pretty much anything it wants to
do,'' said Edward Starkman, a director of Warburg Dillon Read, an
investment banking firm. ``It would be understating it to say they
have a strong frequent-flier base in Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Austin has been a good market for American. With the new
service, it will have 42 daily flights out of Austin, including
nonstops to Chicago, San Jose, Calif., Miami and Los Angeles. It
also is adding daily one-stop service to New York's LaGuardia
Airport beginning Sept. 9.
</P>
<P>
   American's market share has steadily grown, rising 4 percent
over the past year to 27.6 percent, according to the City of Austin
Department of Aviation, and currently it is Mueller's
second-biggest carrier behind Southwest. Through July, Southwest
had 33.9 percent of the Austin market, about the same as it did a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
   American officials said they must offer service to Love Field to
fend off competition. But they said expansion to a second Dallas
airport threatens the viability of 18,000-acre D/FW.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we're philosophically opposed to that, we do need to
compete,'' Smith said. ``Austin is a logical first choice.''
</P>
<P>
   For their part, Southwest Airlines officials say they are ready
to handle additional competition from American.
</P>
<P>
   ``Southwest isn't new to competition from American or another
airline,'' said Melanie Jones, spokeswoman for Southwest. ``We
compete with other airlines in every market we serve.''

GAILEY ISN'T ABOUT TO PANIC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By KEVIN LYONS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The offense appeared to be dismal. Again. Nobody
seemed to make a play on defense.
</P>
<P>
   And if you ever wanted to hear 106,000 people laugh at once,
just watch game tape of the bumbling, fumbling efforts of the
Cowboys' special teams in front of a packed house at Mexico City's
Azteca Stadium for the Cowboys' 21-3 loss against New England on
Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   But after returning to the United States to review the meltdown
against the Patriots, after burning videotape of another game that
yielded no offensive touchdowns and no defensive highlights, coach
Chan Gailey refuses to panic.
</P>
<P>
   For one, Gailey said, these preseason games still don't count in
the regular-season standings. Two, Gailey said he'll expect more
from his club when his starters play a full half against the St.
Louis Rams in Saturday's exhibition game in St. Louis. And three,
he added, panic is not a word he prefers to use in August.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think panic will ever creep in for me,'' Gailey said.
``And that's the wrong word. When you realize that you are
mathematically eliminated from the playoffs, that's when you start
to look and see things and evaluate them in a different light. And
that's the only time you start thinking about that kind of stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   The playoffs are indeed a long way off. But in three exhibition
contests, all losses, the Cowboys have shown little evidence that
they can make the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Cowboys' problems against the Patriots were a
microcosm of what has been a dreary summer. The offensive line
failed to sustain pass blocking. Wide receivers Billy Davis and
Ernie Mills couldn't get open much. First-round draft choice Greg
Ellis, at defensive end, couldn't rush the passer.
</P>
<P>
   With more things going wrong, is Gailey concerned with the
club's mental health, especially when it comes to confidence?
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want your players to start thinking that nothing is
going right,'' Gailey said. ``I hope that's not the case now.
They've seen enough on film to know if we do some things (right)
we'll be successful.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys, presumably, will get their last chance at success
before the regular season with Saturday night's game. It's the
next-to-last preseason game, but the first in which Gailey intends
to play Troy Aikman and the rest of the first-team offense for at
least two quarters. And it's the first game in which Gailey and his
coaching staff intend to employ more than a vanilla game plan.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, though, after three preseason games and two
scrimmages that have yielded mostly unfavorable results, the
Cowboys, Gailey admits, are not feeling too good about themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody that's a competitor and wants to do well wants to
win,'' Gailey said, ``and we're not right now, and they are hurting
in that respect.''

LAWMAKERS URGE CLINTON TO RESIGN AS STARR CONTINUES INVESTIGATION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
and GREG McDONALD 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A day after President Clinton's belated confession
of an improper relationship with a White House intern, independent
counsel Kenneth Starr pushed ahead with his sex-and-perjury
investigation Tuesday and a handful of conservative lawmakers
called for the president to resign.
</P>
<P>
   Polls taken after the president's admission indicated most
Americans want Starr to end his inquiry. But the prosecutor
summoned former presidential paramour Monica Lewinsky to appear
again Thursday before the grand jury examining whether Clinton
tried to cover-up their relationship.
</P>
<P>
   While congressional leaders cautioned the nation against
premature speculation about the possibility of Starr notifying
Congress of impeachable offenses, House Majority Whip Tom DeLay
joined four other Republicans and a Democrat in demanding Clinton's
resignation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is bad enough that our president is guilty of having an
extramarital sexual relationship with one of his young interns,''
said DeLay, R-Texas, ``but it is much more damaging that this
president looked the American people in the eye and knowingly lied
to us.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the good of the country, and to put this scandal behind
us, the president should resign,'' DeLay said.
</P>
<P>
   Similar calls were issued by Republican Sens. Bob Smith of New
Hampshire, Dan Coats of Indiana and John Ashcroft of Missouri. Also
urging the president to resign was former Vice President Dan
Quayle. Both Ashcroft and Quayle are considering Republican
presidential bids in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Rep. Paul McHale of Pennsylvania joined the chorus,
signaling the severity of Clinton's troubles. ``Perjury is not
excused by an apology compelled by overwhelming evidence and
delivered under pressure,'' said McHale.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton ``lied under oath and he almost certainly used
government resources and employment opportunities to encourage
Monica Lewinsky's silence,'' said McHale, who is not seeking
re-election this year. ``With great sadness, I have concluded that
President Clinton should resign or face impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   The calls for Clinton to quit the White House came as he and his
family left scandal-obsessed Washington for a two-week vacation at
Martha's Vineyard, an island off the Massachusetts coast.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving Washington, the president sought to reassure
members of the White House staff by ``reaching out particularly to
those people who had been particularly public in their defense of
him,'' said press secretary Mike McCurry.
</P>
<P>
   The president also spent several hours on the telephone urging
congressional Democrats and party leaders to stick with him in the
wake of Monday's grand jury testimony and national television
address in which he admitted engaging in a seven-month lie about
his relationship with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats on Capitol Hill made it clear the president was
damaged goods as they struggled to find words of support. And they
worried publicly that the worst may be yet to come in Starr's
investigation of whether Clinton or his associates tried to
illegally block the grand jury inquiry or the sexual harassment
lawsuit Paula Jones filed against the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``My faith in the president's credibility has been shattered,''
Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., said.
</P>
<P>
   Added Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., ``I'm
disappointed in not being told the truth. What he did was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., said most Democrats will continue
supporting Clinton, but ``it's not over.'' His fate depends on
``the quality of evidence'' being amassed by Starr and his team of
prosecutors, Hamilton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us are disappointed in the president's personal
behavior in the past few months. None of us approve of what he
did,'' Hamilton said. ``But I don't think that, at this point, that
the Democrats are going to walk away.''
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., said he ``cannot
condone the relationship the president has acknowledged'' and is
``very disappointed in his personal conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, the Illinois
Republican whose panel would handle an initial impeachment inquiry,
said many questions remain unanswered. Until Starr submits a report
``we simply should not speculate about how the House would
proceed,'' Hyde said.
</P>
<P>
   Among those called early Tuesday by Clinton was Vice President
Al Gore, who was vacationing in Lihue, Hawaii. Gore said the
president ``showed courage in acknowledging his mistakes ... and
accepting responsibility for his actions.''
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, disgraced former presidential adviser Dick Morris
spent more than four hours before Starr's grand jury recalling five
telephone conversations he had with Clinton shortly after initial
news reports of the Lewinsky sex scandal in January.
</P>
<P>
   In a Jan. 21 talk, Morris recalled in a Fox News interview, the
president said he ``just slipped up with that girl.'' In the same
conversation, according to Morris, Clinton denied lying in the
Jones lawsuit saying, ``I didn't do what they said I did, but I did
do something.''
</P>
<P>
   Morris, who was forced to resign from Clinton's staff in 1996 in
the middle of his own sex scandal, said he was told by Clinton that
``there would likely be gifts and messages on her answering
machine.''
</P>
<P>
   Opinion surveys in the wake of Clinton's televised address found
about two-thirds of Americans polled calling for Starr's
investigation to end now that the president has admitted his
involvement with Lewinsky. And a clear majority do not want him to
resign or face impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   An ABC News poll showed that 69 percent want the inquiry to end,
while 29 percent think it should continue. A Gallup Poll found 65
percent ready for Starr to quit the sex-and-perjury investigation
that grew out of his examination of Clinton's Arkansas business
dealings.
</P>
<P>
   The Gallup Poll found the number of people with a favorable
opinion of the president dropping by 20 points _ from 60 percent
favorability a week ago to 40 percent after his speech. But his job
approval rating remained above 60 percent. One-third of those
surveyed by Gallup said they lost confidence in Clinton as
president after his comments.
</P>
<P>
   The ABC News poll found 70 percent of Americans saying they do
not want him to resign or be impeached. A similar ABC News poll
over the weekend found 60 percent against resignation or
impeachment.

MEXICO SAYS IT HAS KIDNAPPER WHO CUT WEALTHY VICTIMS' EARS
</HEADLINE>
  (af)  
 By ANTHONY DePALMA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ A nine-month manhunt has ended with the capture of
a brazen and violent kidnapper who used scissors to cut off his
victims' ears and who had said he would never be captured alive,
the authorities announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Jorge Madrazo said at a news conference Tuesday
morning that a group of federal and state police officers had used
legal wiretaps and information gained from plea bargains with
jailed gang members to capture the fugitive, Daniel Arizmendi
Lopez.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said Arizmendi had carried out at least 18
kidnappings since 1996, often with the help of current and former
police officials.
</P>
<P>
   Arizmendi, 40, confessed to four murders Tuesday, officials
said. He was caught here on Monday, when he arrived at a meeting of
associates only to find the police waiting for him, the attorney
general of the State of Mexico, Jorge Reyes Santana, said in a
radio interview.
</P>
<P>
   Arizmendi pulled up in a Volkswagen, alone, and did not offer
resistance, Reyes Santana added.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities said 16 other people, including six youths, had
also been arrested in connection with the kidnappings.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities said Arizmendi's operations were complicated,
involving up to 12 members of his organization. They stopped a
potential victim's car by blocking its way with up to three trucks,
crashing into security vehicles that executives sometimes use for
protection and shooting bodyguards who tried to resist, the
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Hostages were usually taken to a safe house, where they were
stripped and isolated, the officials said, adding that at some
point the victim was told that it was time for ``some therapy,''
and an ear was severed and sent to the victim's family.
</P>
<P>
   Terrified executives who heard of the kidnappings demanded
police action, and one official said an order had come directly
from President Ernesto Zedillo to catch Arizmendi using whatever
means necessary.
</P>
<P>
   The first of several breaks occurred in May, when the police
captured Arizmendi's son and mother, as well as other members of
his organization. The police raided several safe houses used by the
gang in the state of Morelos and found more than $5 million in
ransom money.
</P>
<P>
   Reaction to the kidnappings pressured the authorities, who said
they were hampered by the gang's links to corrupt police officers
who had been bribed for protection. On June 2, with the police
throughout central Mexico looking for him, Arizmendi called a
newspaper here, Reforma.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll never give myself up,'' he said. ``I'm not afraid to
die.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of June the police acted on information from people
linked to the gang who had received reduced sentences or pardons in
return for their testimony. After a shootout with police,
Arizmendi's brother and righthand assistant, Aurelio Arizmendi
Lopez, was captured here.
</P>
<P>
   Aurelio Arizmendi told reporters that his brother used a pair of
scissors to cut the ears off his victims without anesthesia or
medication. ``But it wasn't to make them suffer,'' Arizmendi said.
``It was only to pressure them. That was our business.''
</P>
<P>
   Without his closest allies to turn to for help and with the
police pursuit intensifying, Daniel Arizmendi appeared to go into
hiding. But this month, the police said Tuesday, he kidnapped the
son of a wealthy executive from Queretaro, providing the police
with chance to detain him.
</P>
<P>
   Madrazo said that armed with the information from four
cooperating witnesses, along with Aurelio Arizmendi's cooperation,
authorities could trace Daniel Arizmendi's movements.
</P>
<P>
   Madrazo said that for some reason that is not clear the
kidnappers almost immediately shot and killed the victim, Raul
Nieto del Rio. The slaying did not prevent the kidnappers from
calling the family and demanding $15 million in ransom.
</P>
<P>
   After being arrested on Monday, Arizmendi was taken before a
judge in Queretaro, where he was charged in the kidnapping and
slaying of Nieto del Rio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday was a day of bad luck for me,'' Arizmendi told a
reporter from TV Azteca as he was taken to Mexico City, where he is
expected to face another judge on more charges before being sent to
a nearby maximum-security prison.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the organized-crime unit of the attorney general's
office, Samuel Gonzalez Ruiz, said 39 members of the Arizmendi gang
had been arrested. Some have been sentenced to the maximum 40 years
in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe,'' Gonzalez Ruiz said, ``that with the efforts that
have been made so far the other members of this organization will
receive long sentences too. This has been a great effort to put an
end to impunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said they planned to return the confiscated ransoms
to the victims and their families. Eighty claims have been
presented.

U.N. CASE HIGHLIGHTS REPRESSION IN MALAYSIA
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ A dispute between Malaysia and the United
Nations is casting light on how the Malaysian legal system is used
to stifle criticism, in this case by business interests.
</P>
<P>
   The secretary-general says that a U.N. human rights monitor, who
is a Malaysian, should be able to do his job free of legal
repercussions, but that Malaysia has failed to assert his immunity
before Malaysian courts, where he is facing lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Malaysia, which is expected to win a seat on the Security
Council this fall, says it wants to cooperate in ending the
impasse. The government has not objected to a recent decision by
the U.N. Economic and Social Council to refer the case to the
International Court of Justice in the Hague.
</P>
<P>
   Hasmy Agam, Malaysia's representative at the United Nations,
told the Economic and Social Council in July that his delegation
had ``deep regrets'' over the confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   Malaysia has had an uneasy relationship with human rights
bodies, whether national or international. The government has been
a proponent of writing a declaration of responsibilities to match
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of the case is Param Cumaraswamy, a well-known
Malaysian lawyer appointed in 1994 as the U.N. Human Rights
Commission's Special Rapporteur _ or monitor _ on the independence
of judges and lawyers internationally.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1995, Cumaraswamy said in an interview with a London
publication, International Commercial Litigation, he had received
complaints that powerful corporations were influencing judicial
decisions in Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
   Cumaraswamy was quoted in the article, which also encompassed
interviews with numerous experts on Malaysian law and business
practice, as saying that a particular case under review looked like
``a very obvious, perhaps even glaring example of judge-choosing.''
But he added that he had not finished his investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Four defamation suits were subsequently filed against him by
Malaysian companies in Malaysian courts, seeking a total of about
$80 million in damages.
</P>
<P>
   Although action on the cases has been stayed until September,
Cumaraswamy was told on Aug. 1 that he would be billed more than
$200,000 in court costs, according to a message on Aug. 3 from Kofi
Annan, the secretary-general, to the Economic and Social Council.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups say Cumaraswamy has been forced under the
pressure of litigation to resign from a law firm he founded in
Kuala Lumpur. His predicament is not unlike that of other lawyers
in Malaysia and Singapore whose practices have been destroyed after
they took controversial positions at home and abroad. In Malaysia,
there are close links between the governing party, the United
Malays National Organization, and businesses, some of which are
owned or partly owned by the party.
</P>
<P>
   Since the beginning of 1997, Annan and the U.N. legal counsel,
Undersecretary-General Hans Corell of Sweden, have told Malaysia
that Cumaraswamy had a ``global mandate'' to examine charges such
as those made against the Malaysian legal system and was protected
from lawsuits by international conventions.
</P>
<P>
   Malaysia was asked to inform its courts that Cumaraswamy is
immune from national suits.
</P>
<P>
   Early this year, Annan appointed a Canadian expert, Yves
Fortier, as a special envoy to handle the Cumaraswamy case, for
which the United Nations may be financially liable.
</P>
<P>
   Two trips to Kuala Lumpur convinced Fortier ``that the
government of Malaysia was not going to participate either in
settling this matter or in preparing a submission to the current
session of the Economic and Social Council,'' a report from the
Secretary General said on July 28.
</P>
<P>
   The Economic and Social Council, a usually quiet counterpart to
the Security Council, voted last week to ask the World Court for an
opinion. This is where the matter now rests.
</P>
<P>
   At the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights in New York, Stefanie
Grant, director of programs and policy, said the Cumaraswamy case
was important to all U.N. activities in human rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``As U.N. human rights work becomes more field-based, so the
vulnerability of U.N. experts, officials, criminal investigators,
becomes much greater,'' Ms. Grant said on Tuesday. ``If you're
going to have effective discharge of human rights tasks, people
must be able to be confident that they're not going to be put in
jail or charged with some offense, either at the time or much later
down the line.''

BOARD IS EXPECTED TO BAN USE OF LASER POINTERS  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Robert Brown has been dotted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shook out of my mind,'' said Brown, 20, of Harlem. ``I
was walking on Broadway and I looked at my pants, and I saw a red
dot. I was terrified. I was paranoid, looking around, but it was
just my friend putting one of those lasers on me.''
</P>
<P>
   For the last year, the little red dots _ emitted by hand-held
laser pointers that have migrated from the board room to the
classroom to the streets _ have been popping up on people's
clothing, on movie screens and even a few blackboards across the
country. It is called dotting, and it even made an appearance in a
``Seinfeld'' episode when George Costanza was frustrated by a dot
that kept showing up on his face.
</P>
<P>
   The people wielding the lasers say it is all in good fun, but
others see a more menacing side. Doctors say a laser trained
directly on the eye for several seconds could damage the retina.
Some people, most notably police officers, say the dots resemble
those produced by laser gun sights, making them think the red dot
is about to be followed by a bullet. Others just find being dotted
by strangers an intrusion and an annoyance.
</P>
<P>
   And while reports of injuries from the increasingly inexpensive
lasers are few, school districts across the country have banned or
say they plan to ban the pointers from classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   The New York City Board of Education is expected to vote
Wednesday to join several others that already prohibit students
from using the devices, a compact, high-tech replacement for the
wooden and metal pointers common in corporate offices.
</P>
<P>
   A board spokesman said that there had been no injuries reported
yet but that officials did not want to wait for someone to get
hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz of the Bronx has also introduced
legislation that would prohibit merchants from selling the pointers
to minors. A similar law was passed in June in suburban Westchester
County, which is believed to be the first municipality in the
country to restrict the sale of the devices. (Officials in Ocean
City, Md., enacted a law this month prohibiting the pointing of the
laser beam at people.)
</P>
<P>
   The New York City Police Department says its officers have been
increasingly harassed by people dotting them for sport, a
potentially lethal practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because some weapons are equipped with laser-type aiming
devices, officers are instructed and trained to treat each one of
these incidents as potentially life-threatening incidents,'' said
Inspector Michael Collins, a department spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the department has logged 96 incidents of officers
being dotted, with 61 people arrested for menacing, a misdemeanor
punishable by up to a year in jail.
</P>
<P>
   But from the classrooms of suburban Los Angeles to the hippest
Manhattan clubs, the laser craze shows little sign of abating.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Monahan, a 20-year-old Brooklyn construction worker,
recently had some fun with a pointer with his friends at the
expense of a man sitting in a bookstore.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were driving by Barnes &AMP; Noble and we flashed the dot on
his chest,'' Monahan recalled Tuesday. ``He was looking all around,
he looked real scared and then he just ducked under the table. He
had no idea what was going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Damion Miles, 15, who lives in Harlem and goes to school in
White Plains, N.Y., said restrictions on the devices would not faze
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like playing with it,'' said Damion, who owns two
lipstick-size pointers. ``I like to see people's reactions. They
start looking at their clothes and they wonder where it's coming
from. Sometimes they're in shock.''
</P>
<P>
   Technological advances have caused prices of the battery-powered
pointers, which are sold in office supply and electronics stores as
well as over the Internet and through mail-order catalogs, to drop
in the last year to less than $15 from more than $100.
</P>
<P>
   The devices come in various shapes, the most popular models
including pens, pointers and square ones with loop for keys. A
street vendor on Canal Street was recently seen selling them for
$8.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Williams, a Wisconsin distributor whose Internet
advertisement for the pens bills them as both fun and practical,
said he sold 400 to 500 a month, at $27 each, mostly to
adolescents. His pointers, he said, all carry warnings about aiming
in the eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were obviously initially designed as an aid to teach and
for professionals who needed to point out things on a wall or a
screen and who would rather not use a long stick,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And, of course, what people discovered is that kids and older
kids _ like myself included _ like to shoot it through puffs of
smoke because you can actually see the beam. Kids play a form of
laser tag with it.''

BUSINESS TRAVEL: INS EXPANDS INSPECTION SYSTEM; BOATING INTO
LONDON; SUSHI ON THE WEB; LOUNGING AROUND 
</HEADLINE>
  (Duplication warning: Also moved in ``t'' category.)

<P>
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service is expanding its
automated immigration inspection system, which speeds up processing
time for certain travelers arriving in the United States from
overseas.
</P>
<P>
   The system is currently available at Kennedy Airport in New
York, Newark Airport in New Jersey, Miami Airport and Los Angeles
Airport, as well as at INS preclearance sites at Pearson
International Airport in Toronto and Vancouver International
Airport in British Columbia. It will be offered at San Francisco
Airport by early October, and at Seattle-Tacoma Airport, Washington
Dulles Airport and Honolulu Airport by early next year.
</P>
<P>
   To use the system _ called the INS Passenger Accelerated Service
System, or INSPASS _ travelers proceed to a special kiosk upon
arrival at the airport and insert their enrollment card. They then
place their hands in a device that reads the geometry of the top of
the hand. If their identity is validated, the kiosk prints an
inspection receipt and travelers may go on their way. According to
the INS, the process takes 15 to 20 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   To enroll in the program, travelers must fill out an INS Form
I-823, which can be obtained from the agency or downloaded from its
World Wide Web site (www.usdoj.gov/ins/forms). The form and
supporting documents must be returned in person to an airport with
a special kiosk; an INS inspector will then interview the applicant
and obtain a photograph, fingerprints and hand geometry biometric
image, a digital picture of the top of the hand.
</P>
<P>
   Citizens of the United States, Canada and Bermuda can
participate in INSPASS, as can people who travel to the United
States three or more times a year and are citizens of the 26
countries that take part in the Visa Waiver Pilot Program of the
INS.
</P>
<P>
   Up the River
</P>
<P>
   Virgin Group's Virgin Atlantic is offering free boat service to
the City of London _ the British capital's financial district _ for
its first-class passengers flying into Heathrow Airport. Passengers
are transferred by limousine to Ferry Wharf in Brentwood, where
they board a boat with departures timed to incoming flights.
</P>
<P>
   Sailing up the Thames River, the boat leaves passengers at St.
Katherine's Dock in the City; upon request, it can also drop them
off at points like Chelsea Harbor or Canary Wharf. According to the
airline, the boat trip from Heathrow to the City takes one hour;
the same trip by car can take more than two hours, depending on
traffic. There is no charge for the boat service.
</P>
<P>
   Virgin Atlantic said it would offer the boat service on a trial
basis through the end of October. If it is popular, the carrier
plans to offer a larger boat that will operate all year.
</P>
<P>
   Tokyo Food Page
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to Tokyo can brush up on dining possibilities there on
the Web's Tokyo Food Page (www.twics.com/robbs/tokyofood.html). The
site lists 800 restaurants by cuisine and neighborhood, and also
tells where to buy wine and beer. Especially valuable for a
newcomer to Japanese food is a section on sushi.
</P>
<P>
   Continental Lounges
</P>
<P>
   Continental Airlines has opened its third lounge at Bush
Intercontinental Airport in Houston, on the south side of Terminal
C, and relocated its lounge Airport in Terminal B of Ronald Reagan
Washington National Airport. Both lounges have a conference room,
office equipment, private work stations and outlets for computer
hookups; the lounge in Houston also has shower facilities.

Dulles Airport and Honolulu Airport by early next year.
</P>
<P>
   To use the system _ called the INS Passenger Accelerated Service
System, or INSPASS _ travelers proceed to a special kiosk upon
arrival at the airport and insert their enrollment card. They then
place their hands in a device that reads the geometry of the top of
the hand. If their identity is validated, the kiosk prints an
inspection receipt and travelers may go on their way. According to
the INS, the process takes 15 to 20 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   To enroll in the program, travelers must fill out an INS Form
I-823, which can be obtained from the agency or downloaded from its
World Wide Web site (www.usdoj.gov/ins/forms). The form and
supporting documents must be returned in person to an airport with
a special kiosk; an INS inspector will then interview the applicant
and obtain a photograph, fingerprints and hand geometry biometric
image, a digital picture of the top of the hand.
</P>
<P>
   Citizens of the United States, Canada and Bermuda can
participate in INSPASS, as can people who travel to the United
States three or more times a year and are citizens of the 26
countries that take part in the Visa Waiver Pilot Program of the
INS.

</P>
<P>
   Virgin Group's Virgin Atlantic is offering free boat service to
the City of London _ the British capital's financial district _ for
its first-class passengers flying into Heathrow Airport. Passengers
are transferred by limousine to Ferry Wharf in Brentwood, where
they board a boat with departures timed to incoming flights.
</P>
<P>
   Sailing up the Thames River, the boat leaves passengers at St.
Katherine's Dock in the City; upon request, it can also drop them
off at points like Chelsea Harbor or Canary Wharf. According to the
airline, the boat trip from Heathrow to the City takes one hour;
the same trip by car can take more than two hours, depending on
traffic. There is no charge for the boat service.
</P>
<P>
   Virgin Atlantic said it would offer the boat service on a trial
basis through the end of October. If it is popular, the carrier
plans to offer a larger boat that will operate all year.

FIRST LADY `COMMITTED TO HER MARRIAGE' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDGARTOWN, Mass. _ Her eyes hidden behind dark glasses as the
first family arrived here Tuesday, Hillary Rodham Clinton for the
first time allowed White House officials to describe her feelings
about the president's disclosure of an inappropriate relationship
with a former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is committed to her marriage and she loves her husband and
daughter very much,'' said Marsha Berry, the first lady's
spokeswoman, adding that Hillary Clinton is relying on her
religious faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``She believes in the president. Her love for him is committed
and steadfast. She is certainly uncomfortable with how her personal
life has been made public,'' Berry said. ``This is not one of the
best days of her life.''
</P>
<P>
   Berry said the first lady was misled by her husband and did not
learn what the president's testimony to independent counsel Kenneth
Starr's grand jury would be until this past weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to make some of the first lady's thoughts public
came as the president and his wife tried to put the sordid affair
behind them _ a task that may not be easy. Joined by daughter
Chelsea, the Clintons began a 12-day vacation on Martha's Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is clearly a family that has a lot of healing to do,''
said White House spokesman Mike McCurry after the C-9 Air Force jet
ferrying the entourage landed.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday is Clinton's 52nd birthday.
</P>
<P>
   The president, drained from the previous day, slept late
Tuesday, worked out and spent time with his family before coming to
the Oval Office around 11 a.m. He delayed his vacation departure
for several hours while tidying up ``odds and ends'' and calling
more than a dozen senators to discuss his situation.
</P>
<P>
   McCurry said Clinton also met individually with some members of
the White House staff. ``He was reaching out particularly to those
who have been particularly public in their defense of him,''
McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say the president is gratified with the response to his
remarks last night. He did not expect public opinion to change
immediately but he's gratified by some indications that the
American public accepted what he had to say last night,'' McCurry
said.
</P>
<P>
   Independent public opinion surveys showed the president's
personal approval rating dropping sharply, but his job approval
ratings at more than 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   McCurry said the president feels the most important thing he can
do now is spend time with his wife and daughter ``so that he can do
some repair work within his family'' and begin thinking about ``how
he reinvigorates the agenda he laid before the country in the State
of the Union address this year.''
</P>
<P>
   A suggestion that Clinton travel this week for a campaign-style
event never made it on the itinerary. However, the president may
briefly interrupt his vacation next week to make a pitch for his
agenda.
</P>
<P>
   On arrival here, aides hurriedly moved clothes, golf clubs and
tennis rackets into waiting cars. The president descended the
stairs first, pulled along by his dog Buddy. Father, mother and
daughter plunged into a friendly crowd with Chelsea, 18, leading
the way. The president appeared to wait for the first lady before
moving toward the onlookers.
</P>
<P>
   McCurry made a plea for photographers to give the Clintons their
privacy. On recent vacations, photos have been taken of the
president and first lady on the beach.
</P>
<P>
   But every where around them were reminders of the Monica
Lewinsky mess. The Clintons were greeted at the airport by Vernon
Jordan, the powerful Washington, D.C., lobbyist. Jordan has been a
target of Starr's investigation because he helped Lewinsky find a
job in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of people gathered at the airport to welcome the
Clintons, including some wearing The Black Dog T-shirts from the
famous bakery and restaurant here. It was at The Black Dog gift
shop last year that Clinton, with his unsuspecting daughter in tow,
purchased gifts for Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   McCurry said that on the flight from Washington to Martha's
Vineyard, the president found a bittersweet message in the New York
Times crossword puzzle. The questioning clue on number 46 down
stopped him cold: ``Meal for the humble?'' Clinton turned to staff
members and said, ``Here's one that's appropriate for today.''
</P>
<P>
   The four-letter answer: Crow.

CHREBET THE MISSING JET IN PRESEASON  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By GERALD ESKENAZI    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ Coach Bill Parcells berated his sputtering
passing unit during a demanding Jets practice Tuesday, directing
most of his attention at Wayne Chrebet.
</P>
<P>
   Chrebet has only caught two preseason passes, none during the
Jets' embarrassing 33-0 loss to the Baltimore Ravens on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Chrebet has caught 208 passes in three seasons,
Parcells wonders how he will do as a full-time starter teamed with
Keyshawn Johnson in a two-receiver set.
</P>
<P>
   During training camp, Parcells has repeatedly said that there
would be more pressure on Chrebet as a starter. Chrebet is split
wide much of the time, while much of his early success came when he
lined up in the slot and became a spectacular underneath receiver.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to give him the opportunity and we will see,'' said
Parcells, who is concerned that the Jets' receivers had trouble
getting free against the Ravens.
</P>
<P>
   More important, Parcells knows that if opposing defenses sense
that the passing game is weak, they will gang up on Curtis Martin,
the premier running back who was the showpiece of the off-season
restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other teams are going to try to gang up on Curtis and see
if we can go outside,'' Parcells said.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells halted Tuesday's practice when his offense was not
working well. He punished the players by sending them to the next
field, 100 yards away and over a slight hill, at a gallop. Then
they trotted back.
</P>
<P>
   Then, before one pass play, Parcells shouted at Chrebet. Players
lined up. Chrebet dashed for the right sideline 35 yards downfield
and dived for a Glenn Foley pass. Cedric Donaldson grabbed Chrebet
by the ankles, but the receiver managed to hold on to the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Panting, Chrebet ran back near the huddle, expecting to sit out
the next play. Suddenly, Parcells bulled his way into the huddle
and chased away wide receiver Alex Van Dyke. He told Chrebet to get
back in.
</P>
<P>
   Again, the play called for Chrebet to charge down the right
sideline. This time, diving again, he caught a sideline pass.
</P>
<P>
   Before practice, Chrebet said he was not concerned about not
getting the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't read anything into it,'' he said. ``It's just a matter
of getting the timing down.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year in the off season, Chrebet spent considerable time
working out with Neil O'Donnell at a high school field and at the
quarterback's home in Madison, N.J. This year with Foley as the
quarterback, there may not be as much familiarity between passer
and receiver. Also, Foley enjoys going deep and seems to seek out
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Chrebet, whose contract is up after this season, contended that
he is not concerned about ongoing talks between his agent and the
Jets. He also said that the offense didn't ``pull a lot out of the
arsenal'' against the Ravens. Thus, there weren't too many chances
for the receivers, although three passes were thrown his way.
</P>
<P>
   Strange as it may sound, Parcells has real concerns about the
running game. There is a new quarterback, a new receiving tandem,
new fullbacks and a tight end corps he is not in love with. He has
tried to put in place sure-hands people, but if the offense can't
get together on a passing attack, the running game will suffer
dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   So Parcells kept the receivers after practice this morning
working on their routes. Despite the addition of Martin, the most
significant acquisition of a rising star in recent Jets history,
the ground game could be groundless if the Jets do not have a
receiving threat to counterbalance the defense.
</P>
<P>
   Chrebet has been such a popular player that his No. 80 jersey
outsells San Francisco's Jerry Rice and Johnson's. Indeed, in the
first six months this year, helped by the change to the original
Jets logo, Chrebet jerseys outsold everyone else's in the National
Football League except Green Bay's Brett Favre.

 WASHINGTON: and elsewhere.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Assorted characters who had faded from Clinton's long-running
political drama abruptly reappeared on the stage. Dick Morris, once
Clinton's most valued political adviser, testified for nearly five
ours at the federal courthouse here.
</P>
<P>
   Morris resigned during the Democratic National Convention in
August 1996, after it was disclosed that he had conducted an affair
with a prostitute. Starr's decision to call him to the federal
courthouse on Tuesday provided a sharp counterpoint to Clinton's
plea Monday night to turn away from seamier aspects of political
life.
</P>
<P>
   Paula Jones, whose sexual misconduct lawsuit against Clinton led
to the Lewinsky investigation, issued a rare public statement on
Tuesday. ``It is very important that Mr. Clinton and other men like
him learn that what Mr. Clinton did to me was wrong and that there
are consequences to taking advantage of other people,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Jones claimed in her lawsuit that in 1991, when he was
governor of Arkansas, Clinton lewdly propositioned her in a Little
Rock hotel room. Clinton denied the accusation, but during his
deposition in the suit in January he was asked whether he had a
sexual relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   He denied such a relationship under oath, unaware that Starr had
already begun investigating whether he had tried to obstruct
justice by covering up his ties to Ms. Lewinsky. Starr added the
possibility that Clinton committed perjury to his list of possible
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jones' lawsuit was dismissed by a federal Judge in Little
Rock on April 1, but she is appealing the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that Mr. Clinton's lack of remorse for his
wrongdoing shows why it is so important that the trial court's
decision in my case be reversed,'' Mrs. Jones said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   While he admitted in his testimony on Mondayto ``inappropriate,
intimate physical contact'' with Ms. Lewinsky, Clinton argued that
he had not committed perjury in the Jones deposition, lawyers
familiar with his sealed testimony said. The president said that
the type of contact he had with Ms. Lewinsky did not fit the
definition of sex used by the Jones attorney.
</P>
<P>
   ``While my answers were legally accurate, I did not volunteer
information,'' the president explained in his speech on Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
   About mid-way through the questioning, Clinton lost his
notoriously volcanic temper at a question posed by one of Starr's
prosecutors. Shortly afterward, there was a break in the testimony
for nearly one hour while Clinton huddled with his lawyers in the
doctor's office on the ground floor of the White House.
</P>
<P>
   While they talked, an electronic system maintained by the Secret
Service that tracks the president's movements showed that he had
gone to the doctor's office, raising concerns among White House
staff members that he had fallen ill.
</P>
<P>
   Morris testified on Tuesday for nearly five hours about five
conversations he had with the president in January, after the
Lewinsky accusations were disclosed. Although Clinton publicly
distanced himself from Morris after Morris' relationship with a
prostitute was disclosed, the White House has acknowledged that
they have talked from time to time.
</P>
<P>
   Morris appeared Tuesday night on Fox News, where he said that on
the morning of Jan. 21, the day the Lewinsky matter became public,
the president had acknowledged that `'something'' had occurred
between him and Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Morris said the president told him, ``I just slipped up with
that girl.'' But Morris said the president denied that he had urged
Ms. Lewinsky to lie under oath. ``I didn't do what they said I
did,'' Morris quoted the president as saying. ``But I did do
something.''
</P>
<P>
   That evening, Morris said that he conducted a poll, and found
that people were inclined to forgive the president if he had
committed adultery, but that they were concerned if he had lied
under oath. ``Then they wanted his scalp,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At 11:30 p.m. that night, Morris said he called the president,
and told him, ``Mr. President, if they feel that you lied under
oath, and they feel that you suborned perjury in any way, you're
cooked. They want you out.'' He said he added, ``Forgiveness won't
work.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton responded, ``Well, the charges aren't true,'' Morris
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I said,'' Morris continued, ``well, I think that a full
explanation of what you did with Lewinsky just won't work. I just
don't think this is going to fly.''
</P>
<P>
   In a conversation the following day, Morris said that he
believed the president was genuinely ``remorseful'' on Jan. 21.
``He felt very badly, he felt shame, contrition, none of the things
I heard on Monday night. But he really felt that stuff. And I think
he probably wanted to go before the American people and tell the
truth, and I think that he felt that he couldn't.''

KANELL KNOWS JETS GAME HOLDS SPECIAL MEANING  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By BILL PENNINGTON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Danny Kanell has read the newspaper stories
chronicling the untidy Jets quarterback situation this summer.
Kanell, whose Giants play the Jets on Thursday night at Giants
Stadium, has formed an opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I read the stories, and it made me feel very fortunate that
I'm in the situation I'm in,'' Kanell said Tuesday at Giants
training camp. And, Kanell credited Coach Jim Fassel with keeping a
quarterback controversy out of the mix of the Giants' camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``He played the position,'' Kanell said of Fassel, who was a
college and pro quarterback. ``He knows how emotional it can be to
go through something like that, and he knows the distraction it can
cause. He knows how important it is to avoid all that, and he's
done a good job making things go smoothly.''
</P>
<P>
   Kanell was asked if he had wondered what it would be like to
play under Bill Parcells, the Jets' coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would probably be totally the opposite _ different
styles,'' Kanell said with a wide grin. ``But they've both won.
Coach Fassel can be demanding, too. He looks quiet, but he knows
when to turn it on. He talks to you. He doesn't have to yell at
you.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this year, he has tried to make things calm for me in the
off season and in training camp. And I'm very thankful for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Kanell is one of the few Giants to acknowledge that Thursday's
game carries a special meaning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe it or not, I think we do care who wins _ as much as
the fans do,'' he said. ``You'll probably see a few more scuffles
on the field than you'd see in a regular preseason game. People
talk about bragging rights, and for the players there's something
to that.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know their players pretty well. We'll see them at
appearances and see them around the city. You don't want to have
them talking about their win in this game all year.''
</P>
<P>
   One other Giant, safety Sam Garnes, has openly embraced the
game's significance. Garnes grew up in the Bronx as a Jets fan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a midseason game to me,'' he said. ``I'll bet it is
for them, too. We both looked bad in our last preseason game, and I
expect both sides will come out swinging.''
</P>
<P>
   A sore shoulder has kept Garnes out of the first two preseason
games. He is expected back for the Jets game. ``I can't wait to hit
somebody, and hitting someone in a Jets game is even better,'' he
said. ``It's that kind of game around here.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassel, meanwhile, has done little to hype the match. ``It's
good for New York football,'' he said. ``And I know it's not just
like any other preseason game because we're playing the other team
in New York. I would venture to say that both teams will play with
more intensity.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when I walk around New York, the teams people bring up to
me are Dallas, Washington, the Eagles. No one brings up the Jets.''

SAMPRAS NEXT FOR TEEN-AGER  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By JACK CAVANAUGH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW HAVEN, Conn. _ When Lleyton Hewitt failed to draw Pete
Sampras in the opening round of the Australian Open last year, he
conceded that he was disappointed. Maybe his eagerness was a matter
of impetuous youth, since Hewitt was 15 years old at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, this past January, Hewitt was ecstatic when he was
matched against Andre Agassi in the semifinals of the Australian
Hardcourts Championships in his hometown of Adelaide, where he was
a wild card. Ecstatic but not overwhelmed, Hewitt upset Agassi _
whose picture he has hanging on a wall at home _ and then his
compatriot Jason Stoltenberg in the final.
</P>
<P>
   That not only sent Hewitt's hometown fans into a frenzy but also
made him _ at 16 years 10 months _ the third-youngest player after
Aaron Krickstein and Michael Chang to win an ATP tournament and, at
No. 550, the lowest-ranked one ever to do so.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Hewitt, now 17 and ranked 151st, will get his
chance to play Sampras, in the second round of the Pilot Pen
International here at the Connecticut Tennis Center. Hewitt, the
youngest player on the ATP Tour, earned the opportunity to play the
top-seeded Sampras when he beat Sargis Sargsian by 6-3, 6-4 on
Tuesday. Sargsian, who was born in Armenia, was the 1995 National
Collegiate Athletic Association singles champion as an all-American
at Arizona State.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take long for Hewitt to refocus on Sampras. ``It
should be a good experience,'' said Hewitt, who has an 8-7 record
on the ATP circuit. ``I'll just try to play my best, stay relaxed
and try to stay aggressive. There's no pressure on me because I
have nothing to lose, and he's got everything to lose.''

ADVERTISING: PROCTER &AMP; GAMBLE CALLS INTERNET MARKETING SUMMIT
MEETING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Ohio)   (af)  
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ An advertising behemoth is gathering hundreds of
executives for a one-of-a-kind conference with an ambitious goal:
improving the Internet as a marketing medium by hastening the
discovery of solutions to the panoply of problems that now vex
cyberpeddlers.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting, which begins Thursday, stems from the increasing
frustration of its sponsor, Procter &AMP; Gamble Co., at what is widely
perceived as the poky pace of efforts to eliminate the difficulties
confronted by marketers using online media to pitch products.
</P>
<P>
   P&AMP;G spends $3 billion a year on advertising but has been
recently spending only $3 million a quarter on interactive ads.
</P>
<P>
   The conference is significant because P&AMP;G _ the packaged-goods
powerhouse that sells such omnipresent brands as Tide detergent,
Crest toothpaste and Bounty towels _ is considered a leader among
mainstream marketers in such realms as building brands, developing
products and cultivating longterm relationships with agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that if you get a call from a Procter &AMP;
Gamble, you're going to pay attention,'' said Wenda Harris Millard,
executive vice president for marketing and sales at Doubleclick in
New York, a Web advertising network.
</P>
<P>
   ``The buzz among Internet companies is `Are you going?''' said
Ms. Millard, who was invited to attend. ``Nobody even says `To
what?'''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if she would indeed go, Ms. Millard replied, laughing,
``Have you ever heard me so excited about going to Cincinnati in
August?''
</P>
<P>
   The meeting is significant for another reason: P&AMP;G's well-known
reputation for media innovation. Indeed, the company's early
enthusiasm for radio was so ardent that soap operas still bear that
name in tribute to their initial sponsor's brands of soap and soap
flakes like Ivory, Oxydol, Duz and Dreft.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very savvy move on P&AMP;G's part because it puts a company
that carries an immense amount of weight at the forefront of an
evolving medium,'' said Evan Neufeld, practice director for online
advertising at Jupiter Communications, the Internet consulting
company in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Neufeld, who is scheduled to address the meeting, said: ``P&AMP;G is
telling us `We know this is important, but if you want our money
you have to be part of the solution and not part of the problem.'
Three years from now, we might look back and say that it all began
to make sense after the FAST forum.''
</P>
<P>
   His reference was to P&AMP;G's formal name for the meeting, the
Future of Advertising Stakeholders. Plans for the meeting were
announced in May at Adtech, a digital marketing conference in
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``If packaged-goods companies like P&AMP;G start moving ad dollars
into the Net, it could change the dynamics of all media,'' said
Chuck Martin, who was the chairman of the Adtech conference and has
written books about interactive marketing including the forthcoming
``Net Future: The Seven Cyber Trends that Will Drive Your Business,
Create New Wealth and Define Your Future'' (McGraw-Hill, 1998).
</P>
<P>
   The meeting is set to discuss the impediments to such
investments of ad dollars. They range from inconsistent standards
of measurement to incomplete data on effectiveness to infighting
among the advertisers, agencies and media.
</P>
<P>
   Some who will attend the meeting say they hope the agenda will
be expanded beyond those concerns. They note that 50 years after
Milton Berle first put on a dress, the ratings system that measures
television audiences remains fiercely disputed _ but that has not
kept TV from becoming the biggest ad medium.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are trying to get the Holy Grail of all media
measurement from the Web,'' said Chan Suh, chief executive of
Agency.com, an interactive agency in New York, who is to
participate in a panel on Friday. ``But it's so 1996 to fixate on
that. I hope we can get out of the meeting not only a `state of the
nation,' but also where we go from here.''
</P>
<P>
   Topics to be considered at the meeting are to include
measurement standards, advertising formats like banners, consumer
acceptance of online advertising (including privacy issues) and
making online media easier to buy.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the executives mentioned above, P&AMP;G invited to
the meeting about 400 representatives of such companies and
agencies as AT&AMP;T Corp., Clorox Co., Coca-Cola Co., Kraft Foods unit
of Philip Morris Cos., Levi Strauss &AMP; Co., McDonald's Corp., Modem
Media.Poppe Tyson unit of True North Communications, Ogilvy One
Worldwide unit of WPP Group PLC and Unilever.
</P>
<P>
   ``Industry conferences are always for the usual suspects,'' said
Rich LeFurgy, chairman of Internet Advertising Bureau in New York,
which represents more than 300 cyberplayers. ``This will be the
unusual suspects, and that in and of itself is very important.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The news here is that this is the first time within the
Internet industry that traditional advertisers, online media
companies, interactive agencies and service infrastructure
companies are coming together,'' said LeFurgy, who plans to attend
the meeting. ``It's an opportunity for us all to check our agendas
at the door and speak to the higher good of advertising on line.''

Samantha Reeves says her failed drug test was the result of an
``all-natural'' diet aid. The dietary product, it turned out, had
contained Nor-Andro 19, a variation on the classic steroid
nandrolone and one of the substances banned by the sport. ``I have
never knowingly done anything that would be harmful to my tennis
career,'' Reeves, 19, says in a statement released after her test
result was made public this summer. (Sally Washburn/Midland Daily

was ``not appropriate,'' many Americans are disappointed in his

PROMINENT DEMOCRATS ARE UNHAPPY WITH CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
 
(subs grafs 1, 2, 7 and 8 for amplification; inserts new sentence
after 5th graf; adds 2nd take of all-new material)  (bl) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Prominent Democrats around the country, including
some of President Clinton's most loyal supporters, starkly
distanced themselves from the president Tuesday and expressed deep
personal disappointment with his behavior, as well as political
anxiety about the future.
</P>
<P>
   Many said they were particularly concerned about whether the
Lewinsky matter would impair Clinton's credibility and undermine
his remaining two years and five months in office. With the midterm
elections some 10 weeks away, they were also worried that the
president's acknowledgement would upend the political terrain in
dangerous and unpredictable ways.
</P>
<P>
   Among the sharpest remarks were from Sen. Dianne Feinstein of
California, a longtime ally of Clinton who was described as even
more angry than her statement reflected. ``I was present in the
Roosevelt Room in January when the president categorically denied
any sexual involvement with Monica Lewinsky,'' she said. ``I
believed him. His remarks last evening leave me with a deep sense
of sadness in that my trust in his credibility has been badly
shattered.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the party's congressional leadership scolded the president.
House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt said, ``I cannot condone the
relationship the president has acknowledged and am very
disappointed in his personal conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   And Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle said that while the
president gave ``a more complete explanation of his relationship
with Monica Lewinsky,'' the senator was ``disappointed he did not
do so earlier.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the disappointment, no leading Democrats called for the
president to step down and only a handful of Republicans did so.
</P>
<P>
   One of the few prominent Democrats who put forth a virtually
unqualified defense of Clinton was Vice President Al Gore, who is
vacationing for two weeks in Hawaii and declared Tuesday night, ``I
am proud of him because he is a great president.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic lawmakers, strategists and party officials across the
nation said it was too early to tell whether fallout from the
scandal would diminish the party's prospects in November.
</P>
<P>
   Several Democrats said they were grasping at findings in the
preliminary, and often unreliable, overnight polls that showed that
Clinton's job approval rating remained strong. Mindful, no doubt,
of polls that showed Americans overwhelmingly want to put the
Lewinsky matter behind them, Democrat after Democrat echoed that
sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday morning, Clinton spoke by telephone to about a dozen
Democratic members of Congress, many of whom were described as
reassuring the president, according to White House aides.
</P>
<P>
   But White House officials said it was too early to know just how
Clinton's revelation Monday would be received by the public. ``As
far as the impact on voting patterns, it's too early to tell,''
said a senior presidential aide, speaking on condition of
anonymity. ``My gut tells me that we need to give it another
Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday. Candidates are going to do what's
in their interests to do. They'll wrap their arms around us _ or
they'll distance themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats also voiced concern that Clinton was not
sufficiently contrite in his public address after he testified
before a grand jury Monday, and they expressed fears that his
defiant remarks about the investigation by Independent Counsel
Kenneth Starr were a political miscalculation because they will
only agitate Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it would have been better had he left any reference
to the independent counsel out of his remarks,'' said Sen. John
Breaux, D-La., who is close to Clinton. ``But his admission that he
was solely and completely responsible was the right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., whom Clinton considered as his
running mate in 1992, said, ``I think the American people would
have liked to see the president not only admit his mistake but also
apologize. He misled the American people repeatedly, he misled his
own staff. I think the people expected an apology there. And I
expected one, frankly.''
</P>
<P>
   And Rep. Paul McHale, D-Pa., who is retiring, went as far as to
call on Clinton to resign. ``This is no longer a question of
private morality or political popularity,'' he said. ``Certainly,
we could spare the country a great deal of pain by abandoning the
rule of law. That's too high a price. With great sadness, I have
concluded that president should resign or face impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton hoped Monday's events would finally put the matter
to rest, Republicans around the country vowed to press on, and many
argued that the president's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky was not
a private matter but raised important moral issues that should be
openly discussed.
</P>
<P>
   ``While I welcome the president's statement, and hope that it
hastens the conclusion of this tawdry matter, I believe the
behavior he engaged in was deplorable,'' asserted Sen. John Chafee,
R-R.I., a moderate who has often voted in support of Clinton. ``I
do not agree with those who dismiss the significance of this affair
as being only about private matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Chafee went on to assert: ``This is a question about leadership,
not merely about legalities. This pattern has diminished the moral
authority the president needs if our nation is to confront
successfully such issues as the solvency of Social Security and
Medicare, the Asian debt crisis and America's overall leadership in
the world.''

   Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., said Clinton's political standing
has been so badly weakened that he lacks the credibility to press
for legislation like an overhaul of the campaign finance system.
``Moral authority is needed to pass legislation like that,''
Thompson said. ``You need a president to be able to put some fear
of the Lord in your constituents.''
</P>
<P>
   The remarks of most top Republican leaders in Congress were
unusually tame. Aides to some of those lawmakers said that
Clinton's actions spoke for themselves, and they were taking care
not to appear overly partisan, given the possibility of impeachment
proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to Starr's pending report to Congress, House Speaker
Newt Gingrich said, ``My deepest belief is that all of this is part
of a much bigger story, and we have to wait until the report is in
before we make judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott admonished Clinton for ``the
pain he has caused his family, his friends, his supporters and the
American people since January.'' But he cautioned that he would
wait until Congress reviewed Starr's report and then decide ``if
further action is necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., chairman of the House Judiciary
Committee, which would handle any initial impeachment inquiry, said
many questions remain unanswered and until Starr has submitted a
report, ``we simply should not speculate about how the House would
proceed.''
</P>
<P>
   But other prominent Republicans were particularly harsh in
denouncing Clinton. House Majority Leader Dick Armey said Clinton
``has brought shame to the presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   And House Majority Whip Tom DeLay was one of a handful of
Republicans who urged Clinton to resign, declaring, ``This
president looked the American people in the eye and knowingly lied
to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Michigan Gov. John Engler, a Republican, said Clinton ``is going
to be a very weak and forlorn figure _ I don't think he's in a
position to be laying down terms with the Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   While some Democratic challengers were reluctant to criticize
Clinton, Tim McCown, who is running for a House seat in Maryland,
was not bashful. He called for the president's resignation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not the sex thing,'' McCown said. ``That's between Bill
ad Hillary. It's the honesty thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, said he hoped that Clinton could put
the scandal behind him but he was worried that Republicans ``will
not be happy unless they put the president in stocks or have some
kind of public flogging for his sins.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the worries of disillusioned Democrats, a dozen or so
state party chairmen insisted Tuesday that they would still welcome
Clinton in their states.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Clinton is welcome to come to this state anytime he wants
to,'' said Ohio Democratic Party chairman David Leland. ``He'll be
a grand boost for our candidates. People will remember this man for
the good times, not his personal problems for which he
apologized.''
</P>
<P>
   But Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, a Republican who is a former
Baptist preacher and is seeking re-election this year, said he was
thrilled that Clinton campaigned in his state recently. ``I can say
I'm glad he was campaigning for my opponent and not for me,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those aren't pictures I would put in my campaign literature.''

DELL'S EARNINGS SURGE; PC MAKER SAYS IT TRAILS ONLY COMPAQ 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, N.Y., Calif.)   (af)  
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Defying the inventory glut and macroeconomic woes
that have waylaid its competitors, Dell Computer Corp. reported a
62 percent gain in earnings for its second fiscal quarter Tuesday,
exceeding Wall Street analysts' estimates.
</P>
<P>
   The computer maker, based in Round Rock, Texas, also announced
another stock split.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Dell cited market research showing that it had
moved into the No. 1 position in the United States in desktop
computer sales, and the No. 2 place over all, behind Compaq
Computer but ahead of IBM and Hewlett-Packard.
</P>
<P>
   But while those companies' PC operations have struggled to
maintain profitability in a tough retail environment, Dell gained
market share during the quarter while also improving its profit
margins.
</P>
<P>
   As evidence of Dell's strength, its revenue in the troubled
Asia-Pacific region grew 34 percent, compared with the similar
quarter a year earlier, even as most companies were reporting
double-digit declines.
</P>
<P>
   Dell officials attributed the earnings to the strength of their
direct-sales system, in which the company bypasses distributors and
dealers and builds each computer to order. Because Dell holds very
little inventory, it takes advantage of lower component costs and
is always selling a fresher product, which can command a higher
profit margin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a Dell market _ the right time, right place, right
customer,'' said Seymour Merrin, president of Merrin Information
Services, a PC industry consulting firm in Mountain View, Calif.
``Everybody else is not really coming to the table with the right
pricing and the right stuff. Virtually all of the more
sophisticated buyers today are buying from Dell.''
</P>
<P>
   The company announced its results after the market closed. Dell
ended regular NASDAQ trading at $109.5625, down $1, but in
after-hours trading it moved as high as $114.25. Dell announced a
2-for-1 stock split, its sixth in six years.
</P>
<P>
   For the quarter ended Aug. 2, Dell reported earnings of $346
million, or 50 cents a share, fully diluted, up sharply from $214
million, or 29 cents a share, in the similar period a year earlier.
The per-share figures reflected a decrease in the number of shares
outstanding. Revenue rose 54 percent, to $4.33 billion, from $2.81
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts surveyed by First Call had expected Dell to earn 46
cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the core, we were able to use the structural advantage of
the Dell direct model along with our great velocity to gain market
share,'' Tom Meredith, Dell's chief financial officer, said. ``We
believe we are now significantly larger than the No. 3 and 4,
I.B.M. and HP. It wasn't just a matter of gaining market share; it
was a matter of gaining market-share profitably.''

Samantha Reeves says her failed drug test was the result of an
``all-natural'' diet aid. The dietary product, it turned out, had
contained Nor-Andro 19, a variation on the classic steroid
nandrolone and one of the substances banned by the sport. ``I have
never knowingly done anything that would be harmful to my tennis
career,'' Reeves, 19, says in a statement released after her test
result was made public this summer. (Sally Washburn/Midland Daily

was ``not appropriate,'' many Americans are disappointed in his
actions, but still feel he has done a good job as president. ``Sex

 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Death, unlike taxes, is still certain in Italy. Even
popes must someday die. And when the pope is as towering a figure
as John Paul II, there is one other certainty: Every major
television news organization will someday need a room with a view.
</P>
<P>
   More precisely, American networks will need a large terrace with
a good view of St. Peter's Basilica. CBS News recently outbid its
rivals and signed a contract with the owner of the Atlante Star
hotel for exclusive use of its 5,000-square-foot terrace
overlooking the Vatican for live stand-ups by anchor Dan Rather and
others.
</P>
<P>
   The timing, obviously, is unknown. The price, says the owner,
Benito Mencucci, is about $180,000 for however long the news event
lasts. The fee also covers use of the terrace during the year 2,000
Jubilee. (CBS News officials said the figure was incorrect, but
declined to give a precise one.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I am relieved it's over,'' Mencucci said of the drawn-out
negotiations. ``It was all very embarrassing. For the past year and
a half, not a day went by without some TV person calling about the
terrace. First the Japanese, then the Germans, then the
Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he felt a special bond to the pope, whom he met at a
papal audience two years ago. ``But we had to reach a decision,''
he said. ``Unfortunately death is inevitable for all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Vatican officials view such talk as disrespectful to the
79-year-old pope, who, despite reports that he is suffering from
Parkinson's disease, nevertheless keeps up an astonishingly full
and vigorous schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is never great to talk about death,'' said a Vatican
spokesman, the Rev. Ciro Benedettini. ``I understand the exigencies
of news reporters but it is not a very pleasant subject for those
of us who work with His Holiness.''
</P>
<P>
   When dealing with the Holy See, television producers politely
refer to their contingency plans as preparation for the millennium
_ which the pope has made clear he has every intention of
celebrating on earth.
</P>
<P>
   But his health could fail before 2000. Network executives say
they cannot afford to neglect preparing for so momentous an event.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it happens, it will be a huge story affecting millions
and millions of people,'' said John Paxson, the London bureau chief
of CBS News, who is coordinating contingency Vatican coverage.
``Your ability to preorganize has a lot to do with how well you
cover the story.''
</P>
<P>
   As the unexpected and relentlessly broadcasted funeral of
Princess Diana most recently revealed, television coverage has
changed enormously since John Paul II was elected in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the United States had only three networks, and little live
coverage. Modern technology now allows even small stations and
network affiliates to cover events as they happen in many parts of
the world. In addition to CNN, many networks also have 24-hour
cable news shows.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals from 62 countries will be among the contenders to
replace John Paul II, and virtually all of those countries will
want their own networks to cover the conclave. The American
networks have been seeking positions that allow them to film the
white smoke drifting out of the Sistine Chapel that signals that a
new pope has been elected.
</P>
<P>
   Discreetly, but feverishly, American, British, Japanese and many
other broadcasters have been wheeling and dealing and wining and
dining in search for an edge on the competition _ staking out
camera positions, plotting feature pieces, signing up expert
commentators and making the right friends in high places. NBC News,
for example, hired as its Rome producer the son of the Vatican
official who is the gatekeeper for all photography and electronic
media.
</P>
<P>
   ABC News has reportedly won exclusive rights to the Hilton,
perched on a hill that overlooks Vatican City, though neither the
network nor the hotel management would confirm it.
</P>
<P>
   CNN producers also declined to reveal their planned location.
Rome is awash with rumors that the Atlanta-based news organization
is negotiating an arrangement to work out of a church-owned
property with an excellent view of the Vatican. If true, that would
be quite a coup.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best locations are the private houses, but most of them
are owned by the Vatican,'' one network producer in Rome said.
``But as long as the pope is alive, the Vatican is not going to
countenance any deals between foreign barbarians and themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The Italian press, however, is fascinated by foreign barbarians.
The Roman daily newspaper Il Messagero headlined a recent article
about the terrace wars with the words, ``The Pope: Heaven Can Wait,
the Networks Cannot.''
</P>
<P>
   Many other countries take a pragmatic view of preparing for the
death of national figures. The BBC, for example, conducts a
technical rehearsal of its coverage of the Queen Mother's funeral
every six weeks. But in superstition-prone Italy so blunt an
approach is considered by many as bad luck or bad form.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is so indelicate to write about such things,'' said Walter
Cantini, manager of the Hotel Columbus, three short blocks from the
Vatican, which owns the hotel. ``I find it squalid and ugly.''
</P>
<P>
   Cantini pointed out that his hotel, on Via della Conciliazone,
has no terrace, but he said that he would not allow any advance
negotiations for its use even if it did.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody at our hotel is hoping to profit from such an event,''
he said indignantly. ``It's ghoulish _ as if they are praying for
it to happen.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Yet even the Vatican has quietly undertaken some advance
preparations. In past conclaves, the 100 or so cardinals were
jammed into makeshift and uncomfortable quarters scattered across
the Apostolic Palace. Next time, they will reside inside the
Vatican walls in the recently completed motel-like St. Martha's
Residence several hundred yards from the Sistine Chapel, where the
deliberations take place.
</P>
<P>
   News media accommodations, however, are more difficult to plan,
and that is one reason most television producers seem to be praying
for the pope to live well into the 21st century. At least 5,000
journalists are expected to hurtle into Rome for a papal funeral,
and in the high season, hotel occupancy in Rome is normally 90
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican is already beginning to convert dozens of church
buildings into hostels in anticipation of the jubilee, when
millions of pilgrims are planning to visit the Holy City. Those
will not be ready much before 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the pope dies after the millennium, some of that space
could be made available to the media,'' one network producer in
Rome said. ``If he dies before then, it will be a logistical
nightmare.''

contained Nor-Andro 19, a variation on the classic steroid
nandrolone and one of the substances banned by the sport. ``I have
never knowingly done anything that would be harmful to my tennis

TURKISH DUEL OVER ISLAM SEEMS TO FADE
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ Three Turkish generals who led the military's
campaign against what it sees as the rising influence of Islamic
fundamentalism have retired or been transferred to provincial
posts, where they will presumably have little to do with politics.
</P>
<P>
   The transfers, part of a normal military rotation, have
nonetheless led some Turks to wonder whether the military will take
a lower profile in its battle against religious fundamentalism.
</P>
<P>
   Emerging from a four-day meeting earlier this month, military
spokesmen announced the retirement of the army's Chief of Staff,
Gen. Ismail Hakki Karadayi, who had served the prescribed four
years but whose friends had sought to prolong his active service;
the transfer of Gen. Cevik Bir, the second-ranking commander, to a
field command near Istanbul; and the appointment of Gen. Erol
Ozkasnak, secretary to the general staff, as chief of a cavalry
school.
</P>
<P>
   All three were major figures in the military-led campaign that
forced the resignation of Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan in June
1997. They accused him of plotting to undermine Turkish secularism.
</P>
<P>
   The generals then approved the new prime minister, Mesut Yilmaz,
and have continued to denounce what they describe as growing
fundamentalist influence in Turkish society.
</P>
<P>
   The military's own political influence has risen sharply in
recent years. Rivalries among civilian political factions have
weakened successive Turkish governments, and partly as a result the
military has taken on a larger role in key policy decisions. It is
principally responsible for policy toward Israel, Greece and nearby
countries. It also directs the war against Kurdish insurgents and
helps set the limits to political dissent.
</P>
<P>
   Because criticism of the military can be judged criminal, debate
over the legacy of the outgoing generals cannot be conducted freely
in public. Some Turks, however, believe they did what was necessary
to preserve secularism. Others feel they brought the military too
fully into politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd make your judgment according to what side of the
cleavage in Turkish society you're on,'' said Ilter Turan, a
professor of political science at Koc University in Istanbul.
``Secularists will tend to evaluate this as a great service to the
nation and enhancement of democracy. The more religious camp sees
it as an unsolicited intervention on the part of state elites.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Turkey's new military commander, Gen. Huseyin Kivrikoglu, and
his new deputy, Gen. Hilmi Ozkok, have served in NATO positions,
speak English and have many contacts in Western armies. The new
secretary of the general staff, Gen. Atila Isik, is less well
known.
</P>
<P>
   Military commanders have publicly rejected press reports
speculating that the incoming team might take a softer line toward
political Islam. The outgoing commander, Karadayi, asserted that
such reports ``encourage reactionary circles and lay the groundwork
for fundamentalism.''
</P>
<P>
   Western governments, joined by some Turks, have expressed
concern about the role that the Turkish military plays in civilian
politics. Perhaps in response, there have been tentative signs that
the military may be lowering its profile.
</P>
<P>
   ``The period is over,'' said Haldun Gulalp, a professor of
sociology at Bosporus University in Istanbul. ``Some people may
have said: `Take it easy. There's a limit to what we can do.'
Pressure on the civilian government has been reduced in the last
few months.''
</P>
<P>
   Gulalp said that as a sign of this loosening, a case filed
against a Muslim business federation accused of fomenting
fundamentalism might be dropped.

Samantha Reeves says her failed drug test was the result of an
``all-natural'' diet aid. The dietary product, it turned out, had
contained Nor-Andro 19, a variation on the classic steroid
nandrolone and one of the substances banned by the sport. ``I have
never knowingly done anything that would be harmful to my tennis
career,'' Reeves, 19, says in a statement released after her test
result was made public this summer. (Sally Washburn/Midland Daily

DOTTY, DETERMINED AND EXCESSIVELY FOND OF IL DUCE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 23.) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Why shouldn't Mussolini have an empire?'' asks Lady
Hester Random, an imperious British expatriate played by Maggie
Smith in a new Franco Zeffirelli film. ``All the best people in
Europe have empires.''
</P>
<P>
   The British upper class' passion for Italy has been invincible,
even at the time of World War II. There were 18,000 British people
living in Florence when the war broke out, and hundreds of them,
convinced that their Englishness _ and their admiration for Il Duce
and Fascism _ would shield them forever, stubbornly stayed put as
the Tuscan landscape darkened.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tea With Mussolini,'' which is being directed by Zeffirelli
this summer in Rome and Florence for release next year, is based on
his memories of wartime and the years just before, when he was an
illegitimate, motherless young Florentine.
</P>
<P>
   It's a homage to a group of eccentric English ladies who
essentially adopted him, and who tried to preserve their own
civility and Florence's treasures as war closed in around them.
Art-mad, dotty, deluded, these genteel Englishwomen, whom he called
the ``scorpioni'' for their stinging wit, were as much a part of
his childhood in the city as Dante, Botticelli and the Duomo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The story of these old ladies is something I've been wanting
to do all my life,'' Zeffirelli, 75, said here the other day as he
bustled around a basement warehouse that had been made up to look
like an internment camp in which the women ended up being confined
after Italy entered the war.
</P>
<P>
   He first began thinking of building a movie around them in the
1950s, but he didn't really get back to the idea until he wrote
about them in his 1986 autobiography. ``Even those who lived in
Florence forever never learned Italian; they lived in their own
world. We would shout `Guarda gli Inglesi!' as they strolled
downtown under their parasols.''
</P>
<P>
   The film, which has five strong parts for older actresses, is
also Zeffirelli's homage to some of the greatest divas he has
directed. He is perhaps best known for his 196Os film adaptations
of Shakespeare (``The Taming of the Shrew'' and ``Romeo and
Juliet'') and, more recently, his lavish opera productions and
opera movies, but he began his international career in the English
theater.
</P>
<P>
   Judi Dench, now 63, played Juliet in a 1961 production of
``Romeo and Juliet'' that was Zeffirelli's debut at the Old Vic.
And 30 years ago, Miss Smith, 63, and Joan Plowright, 68,
alternated in the part of Beatrice in his stage production of
``Much Ado About Nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   It was while visiting Zeffirelli at his villa in Positano with
her husband, Laurence Olivier, in the late 1980s that Miss
Plowright first became involved in the movie. ``Maggie and Judy and
I kept complaining that there weren't any parts for women over
45,'' she explained. ``Franco popped up and said I have a movie and
(italics)all(end italics) of you can be in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Miss Plowright conceded that she and her co-stars had played
upper-class English eccentrics before. ``I've played a few,'' she
said with a sly smile. ``One isn't frightened of it, but one hopes
to explore all the possibilities of her.''
</P>
<P>
   To spice up the mix in ``Tea With Mussolini,'' Zeffirelli and
his fellow screenwriter, the British novelist John Mortimer,
invented two American characters: Georgie, a sardonic lesbian
archeologist, played by Lily Tomlin, 58, and Elsa, a rich Jewish
art collector and former Ziegfeld girl with a passion for younger
men, played by Cher, 52.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the American women and the British ones
despise each other, but the war _ and their struggle to survive it
_ force them together.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I read the script, I loved it: I have never played a
character who was spoiled rotten before,'' said Cher during a break
from filming. ``Most of my characters have been nice, generous or
heroic.'' She added that she felt a bit nervous about playing a
woman who is not immediately sympathetic. ``I'm not sure how
audiences will react. It scared me. It still scares me.''
</P>
<P>
   Miss Plowright, who received an Academy Award nomination for her
performance in ``Enchanted April,'' a 1991 film set in Italy, said
she hoped she could prevent audiences from liking her too much. She
plays Mary Wallace, a character based on Mary O'Neill, the British
woman who was hired by Zeffirelli's father to teach him English and
who instilled in him a love of Shakespeare and the theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``I shall come off as a nice, good lady, if I'm not careful,''
she said. ``You need a bit of the Devil to be interesting, don't
you?''
</P>
<P>
   While the plot centers on the relationship between the women and
their young protege _ here called Luca and played primarily by
Baird Wallace, 17, an American newcomer whose parents are based in
Rome (Luca at a younger age is portrayed by Charlie Lucas) _ the
film also examines the cultural clashes between the upper-class
Englishwomen and the less classy Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Off the set and on, the production has highlighted the contrast
between the world of Hollywood and that of the British stage.
</P>
<P>
   Cher, who won the best-actress Oscar for her performance in
``Moonstruck'' (1987), was the only principal to arrive in Italy
with her own makeup artist, hairdresser and personal secretary. As
befits an American movie star, she originally asked to stay in a
rented villa but rejected it as inadequate after one night and
switched to the Excelsior.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, she moved to the equally grand Hotel Eden, where the
film's other stars were booked. (The hotel's staff was so flustered
at having so many titled English guests _ Miss Plowright is Lady
Olivier, and Miss Smith and Miss Dench are properly addressed as
Dame _ that the flowers they sent Ms. Tomlin were addressed to Lady
Tomlin.)
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The English actresses' costumes were designed by Jenny Beavan,
who won an Oscar for her work on ``A Room With a View,'' a
production that brought Miss Smith and Miss Dench, among others, to
Florence in the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Several top fashion designers, including Valentino, were
considered to design Cher's more flamboyant 30s look. Eventually,
Zeffirelli settled on Ermanno Daelli, a Florence designer. Even
then, Cher hired a professional costume maker to translate the
designer's high-fashion vision into costumes workable on a movie
set.
</P>
<P>
   Cast and crew members stressed the English stars' craftsmanship.
Cher was usually described as ``simpatica.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The English ladies are so experienced, so professional, so
talented,'' said Zeffirelli. He used the word ``adorable'' to
describe Cher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have problems with American actresses; they tend to
complicate issues,'' explained Zeffirelli, whose last film was
``Jane Eyre'' (1996), starring the French actress Charlotte
Gainsbourg. ``Most don't come from the stage; they don't have the
training to focus on what matters. It's a different approach, of
agonizing creativity.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that he found Cher good-natured and disciplined, but he
said: ``She is very insecure; she wants to express her talent. It's
constructive, but it can be an agonizing process.''
</P>
<P>
   Cher admitted she was intimidated by Miss Smith, Miss Plowright
and Miss Dench. ``I'm working with these idols, which keeps me at a
disadvantage,'' she said ruefully. ``They have been really, really
nice to me, but we don't really know each other. Those three have
been together for 30 years; they tell hilarious stories about
things that happened 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very difficult to act your part the way you need to when
you see them, doing what they do so perfectly.''
</P>
<P>
   The film's title derives from a scene Zeffirelli borrowed from
Violet Trefusis, one of Virginia Woolf's Bloomsbury friends, who
often boasted of a tete-a-tete with Il Duce.
</P>
<P>
   In the movie, Lady Hester travels to Rome to take tea with
Mussolini, and is reassured by his promises of safety _ and Earl
Grey. ``She is someone who is absolutely convinced she is right,''
Miss Smith explained. ``And is horrifyingly wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Miss Smith, who won an Oscar for her performance in ``The Prime
of Miss Jean Brodie'' (1969), has played passionate wrongheadedness
before. This time, she mixes it with some of the mad hauteur of
Oscar Wilde's Lady Bracknell.
</P>
<P>
   In life as in the film, Miss Smith is a daunting figure. During
filming of the opening scene, a ceremony in Florence at the grave
of the poet Elizabeth Barrett Browning where the English women
gather to pay their respects, a Swiss tourist brashly approached
Miss Smith between scenes for an autograph.
</P>
<P>
   ``Write something personal,'' he instructed her. She gave him a
withering smile and said, ``Shall I say, `See you soon'?''
</P>
<P>
   British understatement was also on vivid display on a searingly
hot day in the basement set in suburban Rome. Temperatures were
over 110 degrees outside, and the set, despite industrial-sized
fans, was about as cool as an incubator.
</P>
<P>
   The surrounding streets were too narrow to allow the stars'
trailers to park nearby, so Miss Smith, Miss Dench and Miss
Plowright sat on folding chairs in wigs, wool suits, period garters
and stockings and fur wraps waiting for their scenes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ladies are mad as hornets,'' one production employee
confided in a whisper. But if the actresses were upset, they never
betrayed it. Alongside a small army of elderly extras, mostly
British retirees in Rome who were recruited to play inmates in the
internment camp, they waited, fanning themselves with paper plates
and doing crossword puzzles.
</P>
<P>
   One scene, in which the ladies hear over the radio that the
Americans have declared war on the Axis powers after the bombing of
Pearl Harbor, required the actresses to convey shock, exhilaration
and severe cold. The three British stars put down their crossword
puzzles, delivered their lines flawlessly, then quietly resumed
their puzzles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We (italics)are(end italics) three eccentrics,'' Miss Dench
explained. ``We laugh a lot, and we complain about the heat, and
that is what we are likely to remember when all this is done.''

 &HT;    Opinions about Clinton-Lewinsky subject as varied as ever
 &HT;    By Steve Visser
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ President Clinton wants his extramarital relationship
to be a debate about privacy, and while many Atlantans agree with
him, some think its a question of whether there was perjury.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel that if in fact he lied under oath, then he should be
impeached,'' said businessman Charlie Loudermilk, who voted for
Clinton's opponent in both presidential elections. ``Probably our
most most sacred tenant of justice is that you don't lie under
oath.''
</P>
<P>
   Loudermilk, who said he has never trusted Clinton's character,
chuckled and said: ``I think that dress (that Lewinsky claimed was
stained during a visit with Clinton) might go into the Smithonian
as the dress that took down the presidency of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Atlantans as equally disgusted with Clinton as Loudermilk
think impeachment would be too time-consuming. ``I think he should
resign now,'' said Mike Nance, a high school teacher. ``He could
have come a long way to retrieving (with his speech), and I'm not a
big fan, if he had been forthright and he wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   `` I have to teach a course in government a week from today. I
don't know how I'm going to do it with a straight face. Can you
imagine the things kids are going to say to me?''
</P>
<P>
   Others agreed. ``He needs to go,'' said Amy Covington, a
helicopter pilot. `` He could have told the truth in January, but
he went on national television and he denied it. He made a bad
situation worse by lying about it because it makes people think
what else have you lied about. As a president, you have to have
credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody is perfect, but I expect the president of the United
States to exceed my standards.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Atlantans contacted in an informal telephone survey
weren't calling for Clinton's head and seemed to agree with the
national polls that showed that while Americans distrusted the
president's credibility, the majority thought he should stay in
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I truly believe he wants to do the right thing, and I believe
he has demonstrated a fair amount of sincerity, which is what the
country is looking for,'' said businessman Roger Key. ``The country
wanted him to say exactly what he said. The country wanted him to
admit to doing some wrong, and he did that.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Clinton supporters sounded a little disgusted by the whole
Monica Lewinsky affair, not wanting to know the seamy details of
the relationship and willing to write it off as a private matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point in time, I don't care what he is doing in his
bedroom and let's just let it be over,'' said Jenny Morrell, a
school teacher. ``I was satisfied with what he had to say. He
didn't seem overly distraught by the whole thing but he seemed
sincere.''
</P>
<P>
   Others were as equally troubled by Special Prosecutor Kenneth
Starr's investigation as they were with the president's ``improper
relationship'' with a young White House intern. At the same time,
they found Clinton's admissions a low point for the country and
blamed the president for not having the courage earlier to be
candid with the country _ or at least not mislead it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish he had told us earlier,'' said Tom Budlong, a librarian
and Clinton supporter. ``I still think Ken Starr should have stayed
out of his personal life. If he had done things like Iran-Contra,
where they had done things that actually hurt the country, it would
be better grounds for an investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Bills, an Arkansas native before moving to Atlanta, agreed
that Clinton shouldn't have tried running from the truth. `` I
think it would have basically been easier if he had just come out
and told the truth in the beginning,'' Bills said. ``He was being
pushed into the corner where the truth had come out sooner or
later.''
</P>
<P>
   But Budlong believed that as far as the president's evasions
went, if he had only mislead the country and the Paula Jones
lawyers about sexual improprieties, then there aren't grounds for
impeachment. He had always doubted Clinton on the Lewinsky matter
anyhow, Budlong said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was always an element of doubt given his track record
with other women,'' he said. ``On the other hand, I think if you're
going to have an affair in the first place, you're not going to
tell the truth about it. Not that it justifies it, but I think that
it's typical human behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is something troubling about taking advantage of the age
and power difference between him and a young intern, who is
flattered by his attentions. It was just stupid. It was a very
stupid thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Bills said that Clinton deserved a second chance for a
misleading the country about an embarrassing episode in his private
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt he was sorry for it and he did regret lying and felt
bad about what he had done,'' he said. ``I can't say it was because
he got caught or that guilt was eating him up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We all make mistakes.''``Even my self, if I had done something
like that, my first reaction would be to deny it.''

<P>
   LENOX, Mass. _ ``Escape to Tanglewood,'' advertisements have
beckoned this season with determined optimism and perhaps a touch
of defiance. Escape? After all the turmoil in the wake of the last
season?
</P>
<P>
   Tanglewood is, to be sure, many things: first and foremost, a
festival and retreat of the Boston Symphony Orchestra here in the
idyllic Berkshire Hills, at the opposite end of the state,
seemingly the opposite end of the planet, from its urban base.
</P>
<P>
   So when several respected teachers at the orchestra's venerable
training institute, the Tanglewood Music Center, loudly and angrily
resigned late last year in response to a redirection of the
center's activities by Seiji Ozawa, the longtime music director of
the Boston Symphony, it was not clear how much the average
festivalgoer's experience would be affected, if at all.
</P>
<P>
   Then a new book, ``Tanglewood: The Clash Between Tradition and
Change,'' by Andrew L. Pincus, the music critic of The Berkshire
Eagle, in nearby Pittsfield, Mass., questioned not only the recent
handling of the music center but also what Pincus saw as heightened
commercialism at the festival as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   Tanglewood, he suggested, was caught in the grip of a worsening
identity crisis, as ``one of the most ambitious music festivals in
the United States and one of the most staid, ... the home of the
East Coast's most important contemporary-music festival and the
purveyor of stars and easy-listening fare for tourists, ... a
highly pressurized school for the cream of the world's young
musicians and ... a theme park of classical music.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet as the Boston Symphony season winds down, ending next
weekend in a series of collaborations with the cellist and
conductor Mstislav Rostropovich, the orchestra has managed to put a
good face on most things. Indeed, virtually every veteran of past
seasons encountered in visits here throughout the summer attested
that with Ozawa, who studied at the center in 1960, more closely
involved in its activities than ever before, this has been one of
the most rewarding festival seasons in recent memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year is noticeably better than previous years in musical
results, attendance and enthusiasm,'' said Andre Previn, who
conducted the Boston Symphony on two weekends and coached
conducting at the music center.
</P>
<P>
   The youthful Tanglewood Music Center Orchestra produced
spectacular performances in works by John Adams, Elliott Carter,
Henri Dutilleux, Mauricio Kagel and others at the Festival of
Contemporary Music, two weeks ago, as it had in several concerts of
more standard fare.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Symphony concerts have by and large been well
attended (though the record set last year may be safe) and
favorably received. The interaction between the music center and
the parent orchestra seems to have developed fresh synergy and
generated excitement on both sides. Even the weather has usually
cooperated. (But blast those infernal mosquitoes!)
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, it's going well this summer,'' said Daniel R. Gustin,
the assistant managing director of the Boston Symphony and the
manager of Tanglewood, in one of the more grudging assessments.
</P>
<P>
   Gustin's restraint is understandable; he was personally and
professionally close to administrators and faculty members now
departed, including Richard Ortner, who was fired as administrative
director of the music center two years ago and was recently named
president of the Boston Conservatory; Gilbert Kalish, the pianist,
who resigned as chairman of the faculty last November, and Leon
Fleisher, the pianist and conductor, who resigned as artistic
director of the music center in December.
</P>
<P>
   Gustin's role has also been curtailed. Ellen Highstein, who was
named director of the music center last November, reports not to
him, as Ortner did, but to Mark Volpe, who took over as managing
director of the Boston Symphony a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been a difficult summer,'' Gustin said with obvious
understatement.
</P>
<P>
   Difficult on some level for everyone, it seems. Last year the
Juilliard String Quartet introduced its newest member, Ronald
Copes, the second violinist, at Tanglewood, and this year it
presented an intensive two-week quartet seminar at the start of the
music center season.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Joel Krosnick, the group's cellist, also resigned
from the center's faculty in sympathy with Kalish, a longtime
friend and collaborator. But Joel Smirnoff, the first violinist,
stayed on to coach chamber music.
</P>
<P>
   ``The break has been painful,'' Smirnoff said. ``It's hard for
us all. But great things are happening, and the biggest thing is
that Seiji Ozawa has taken a hold.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, those still connected with the festival have little
to gain from speaking ill of current trends or dwelling on
persisting problems. And of course, the Boston Symphony was eager
to put forward players, faculty members and others who would give
developments a positive spin, as they almost invariably did. Still,
the unanimity as to the depth and quality of Ozawa's involvement in
the music center season, which ended on Wednesday, was striking.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been wonderful,'' said Phyllis Curtin, the soprano, who
directs the vocal program. ``His decision to become more involved
was perfectly reasonable. This place becomes a part of you, and now
that he has reached the top of his profession here and abroad, he
wants to become a part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Others, too, have speculated that a concern with his legacy has
helped drive Ozawa's increased attention to the music center in
recent years. Ms. Curtin's program, in any case, has been a
particular beneficiary, with acclaimed productions of Britten's
``Peter Grimes'' in 1996 and Poulenc's ``Mammelles de Tiresias''
last summer, both conducted by Ozawa.
</P>
<P>
   This year, before he left, two weeks ago, to take up his other
major summer commitment, the Saito Kinen Festival in Japan, Ozawa
was by all accounts omnipresent at the music center. He hovered
over registration at the start and often ate with the students in
the cafeteria. He led or sat in on coaching sessions, rehearsals
and performances. He conducted at the contemporary festival for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
   And with him, Boston Symphony players have established a much
stronger presence at the music center, harking back, some say, to
the time of the sainted Serge Koussevitzky, who founded the
festival in 1934 and the Berkshire Music Center, predecessor to the
Tanglewood Music Center, in 1940.
</P>
<P>
   This season, symphony players coached at the center and sat in
on orchestral rehearsals and performances; some even drew their
young charges into rehearsals and performances of the Boston
Symphony. Some 40 symphony players were involved; 10 or 12 more
were turned away, too much for the system to accommodate.
</P>
<P>
   To judge from the evident excitement of several of the symphony
players, this initiative may be just the shot in the arm needed by
an orchestra whose individual members not infrequently look and
sound bored with their work. ``I've never been more tired or more
fulfilled,'' said Lawrence Wolfe, a double bassist from the
symphony, who had just spent most of his waking hours for two weeks
at the center and had joined its orchestra on electric bass in a
performance of Bernstein's ``Songfest.''
</P>
<P>
   It would go too far, no doubt, to see in the orchestra's early
and amicable contract settlement, reached last month at Tanglewood,
a nascent era of peace and good will. But many see the spirit of
this summer, extended into the future, as a big part of the
solution to whatever morale problems may exist in the orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a huge change,'' said Douglas Yeo, the bass
trombonist of the Boston Symphony Orchestra. ``The whole flow of
Tanglewood is much more BSO-centric.'' Yeo and others said that for
a decade or more, they had felt shut out of the music center, with
its great emphasis on chamber music.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, they were shut out,'' said Ortner, the former
administrator of the center. ``Seiji Ozawa always said that he
wanted a better orchestra. There is general agreement that the way
to improve an orchestra is to beef up the string players, and the
best way to do that was through chamber music.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a widespread feeling at the center, too, that symphony
players were not eager to become involved, any more than their
music director was. ``Perhaps we could have reached out more, but
they never asked to be included,'' Kalish said. ``And as for Ozawa,
it was hard to get him to commit time to the music center. He was
great with young people, and we wanted him involved, but he never
stayed for the new-music festival. So there was a separation, not
chosen by us.''
</P>
<P>
   Ozawa became music director of the Boston Symphony in 1973 and
always had the option to take full control of the center. Three
years earlier, with an infirm William Steinberg as the orchestra's
music director, Ozawa had been appointed artistic director of the
Tanglewood Festival, with Leonard Bernstein as artistic adviser,
and the composer and conductor Gunther Schuller as co-director of
the Berkshire Music Center. Schuller was given full control in
1974.
</P>
<P>
   Fleisher succeeded Schuller as artistic director of the center
in 1984. A restructuring and diminution of his responsibilities was
being discussed before he resigned last year. It would have
resulted in a largely honorific position in which he would have
reported to Ms. Highstein, the new director of the music center.
</P>
<P>
   Fleisher did not return repeated phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something Mr. Ozawa could have done, and arguably
should have done, in 1984, when Gunther Schuller left,'' Ortner
said of the maestro's taking control of the music center.
</P>
<P>
   Or if not then, perhaps in 1990, after the death of Leonard
Bernstein, suggested Volpe, the managing director of the Boston
Symphony, who was the executive director of the Detroit Symphony
while the Tanglewood troubles were brewing.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein _ with Koussevitzy and Aaron Copland, the other great
historic figurehead at Tanglewood _ maintained a connection at the
center in relatively brief jaunts and conducted his final concert
at Tanglewood, with the Boston Symphony.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a vacancy here,'' Volpe said, referring to a gap
more spiritual than material left by Bernstein's death, ``and it
was a missed opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   As it happened, the fracas generally cited as a watershed in
Tanglewood's time of troubles had Bernsteinian overtones.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Ozawa involved himself and the Music Center Orchestra
in ``Marsalis on Music,'' a major video project with the trumpeter
Wynton Marsalis and Sony Classical. A series of tapes of an
innocuously educational sort, it was vaguely modeled on Bernstein's
Young People's Concerts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the kind of thing Lenny would have grabbed at in a
minute,'' said Ms. Highstein, who was the executive director of the
Concert Artists Guild in New York before becoming director of the
music center. ``Everybody would have been on the bandwagon.''
</P>
<P>
   When Ozawa grabbed at the project, he reaped a whirlwind of
faculty complaints that the two-week recording project had left
students exhausted and the music center schedule in a shambles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt strongly about the Marsalis thing,'' said Krosnick, of
the Juilliard String Quartet. ``I said to Richard Ortner, `This is
not healthy.' But he and Dan Gustin defended Ozawa to the hilt.
They were unfailingly loyal. `Seiji wants this,' they said.''
</P>
<P>
   It did not help that the videos ran into production problems and
were from the outset widely judged a failure as either art or
entertainment. ``Nobody had any complaints beforehand,'' said
Richard Dyer, the music critic of The Boston Globe. ``The uproar
all started after the project was underway, when everyone saw that
it was eating up time and wasn't very good. If it had turned out
well, there would have been no complaints.''
</P>
<P>
   Ozawa, for his part, declined to say much about the troubles of
the recent past. As for his failure to take a hand sooner, he
explained that for a long time he did not feel comfortable teaching
conducting, so he did not see a clear-cut role for himself at the
music center, and withdrew. But more than five years ago, he began
to feel that a complacency had set in, that major changes were
needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would take great energy, and I wasn't sure it was
possible,'' he said. ``But when colleagues took me aside and said
the same thing, I realized it had to be done, and I was the only
one who could do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Those departed from the music center cite evidence, often at
second or third hand, that Ozawa read faculty complaints as
disloyalty rather than honest professional disagreements. Those
close to Ozawa say that what finally moved him to action was a
sense that too much power had concentrated in Ortner's hands,
partly because others were slacking off on their jobs; that Ortner
had developed a sense of ownership, and that a clubby atmosphere
had grown up around him.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, Ortner, the would-be peacemaker, became a lightning
rod. Ozawa fired him in 1996, and prominent faculty members began
to see the handwriting on the wall.
</P>
<P>
   Matters only worsened last summer, when Ozawa continued to press
for change, however well or ill defined, and met with resistance.
``The idea that change was needed was laughable,'' Julius Levine, a
veteran double bassist and yet another faculty member who resigned,
insists to this day. ``The program needed absolutely no changes.''
</P>
<P>
   To hear some of the students tell it, insurrection against the
administration was in the air, over an issue whose complexity well
represents the quagmire of miscommunications and contradictions
that awaits anyone trying to get to the bottom of the controversy.
Orchestral programming, the students said, left many of them,
especially brass players, with little to do but chamber music
(where there is also relatively little for brass players to do).
This year brought Valhalla, with big pieces like Mahler's Sixth
Symphony, Stravinsky's ``Rite of Spring'' and Bernstein's
``Songfest.''
</P>
<P>
   The root of the problem, Ortner and Kalish both argued, is that
Ozawa decreed years ago that the center's orchestral programming
should remain squarely based in the Classical repertory: Mozart and
Beethoven, mostly. ``It was out of my hands,'' Kalish said. What
was a poor brass player to do?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe that this story has villains,'' Ms. Highstein
said. That theory is convenient, but it may also be accurate. Even
those most strongly opposed to the outcome of Ozawa's actions grant
that he had every right to take them and that if he keeps up his
level of commitment, he will undoubtedly succeed.
</P>
<P>
   Nor are there unblemished heroes. Even those most strongly in
agreement that actions like Ozawa's were necessary grant that the
matter was handled badly, especially in the peremptory,
inadequately explained firing of the popular Ortner.
</P>
<P>
   ``One good thing that will come of this is that there is no way
now that they will let it fail,'' said Gustin, the Tanglewood
manager. ``The staff of the music center has been doubled. The
budget has been increased. The Boston Symphony Orchestra will not
let this be diminished in any way, and that's good and healthy,
however painful.''

   SAN FRANCISCO _ Netscape Communications Corp., the leading maker
of Internet browser software, reported third-quarter earnings
Tuesday that exceeded Wall Street estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape now gives away its browser but competes in the market
for corporate communications software and derives substantial
revenue from its Web site, Netcenter, which offers directory
services and sells advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the revenue side, they did a little bit better than Street
expectations,'' said David Readerman, an analyst with Nationsbanc
Montgomery Securities. ``They are both selling license software and
services and on the Netcenter side generating sponsorship and
advertising revenues.''
</P>
<P>
   Netscape, based in Mountain View, Calif., reported its results
after the market closed. In NASDAQ trading, shares of Netscape rose
$1.8125, to $32.125.
</P>
<P>
   For the quarter ended July 31, Netscape earned $88,000, or
break-even on a per-share basis, compared with a loss of $44.7
million, or 53 cents a share, in the quarter ended June 30, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue rose 10 percent, to $150.2 million. Analysts had
expected Netscape to report a loss of 2 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   The results were not a direct comparison because Netscape
changed to a fiscal year from Nov. 1 to Oct. 31 from a calendar
year to better align itself with the buying patterns of corporate
customers.

MIXED SIGNALS FROM JAPAN ON BANK-SYSTEM OVERHAUL 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's government, less than a
month old, already seems to be getting mired in foot-dragging,
waffling and confusion over how to cure the sickly banking system,
a predicament it had sought to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   The latest suggestion of trouble came Tuesday evening when Taku
Yamasaki, a power broker in Obuchi's dominant Liberal Democratic
Party, seized attention by telling reporters that the government
had decided to prevent the failure of any major Japanese bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``This morning, I contacted very important persons in the
Japanese government, and they said they had decided not to let
ailing major banks go bankrupt to avoid negatively influencing the
economic situation in the world, especially in Asia,'' the Kyodo
news agency quoted Yamasaki as having said through a spokesman on a
trip to Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   Kyodo later reported that Yamasaki's spokesman subsequently
clarified the remark, saying that measures to prevent such failures
were under discussion.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of clarification reflects the ambivalence that has
plagued Japanese policy-makers over how to repair the debt-laden
banking system, widely regarded as the heart of the nation's
economic ills. Many analysts have suggested that an orderly closing
of one of Japan's big, troubled banks would show that the
government is serious about a solution.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last few months, foreign investors have pushed Japanese
banking stocks down to their lowest levels in a decade, an
expression of doubt on the government's resolve.
</P>
<P>
   Akitaka Saiki, a spokesman for Obuchi, said Yamasaki did not
represent the government. Still, the party leader's quoted remarks
were likely to inflame debate in Parliament over six bills that, if
passed, would lead to creation of a ``bridge bank'' system to
dispose of bad loans, while strengthening failing financial
institutions to protect depositors and borrowers.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition parties, which control the upper house of Parliament,
are calling for much tougher measures, including the nationalizing
of insolvent banks and the closing of institutions with intractable
problems.
</P>
<P>
   In legislative debate on Monday, Naoto Kan, the popular leader
of the opposition Democratic Party, forced Finance Minister Kiichi
Miyazawa and Masaru Hayami, governor of Japan's central bank, to
concede that the proposed bridge banking system was probably not
the best solution for big banks with substantial international
exposure.
</P>
<P>
   Yoshito Sengoku, chairman of the Democratic Party's planning
committee, said that it and other opposition parties were willing
to let banks fail. But he also said that some bank failures must be
prevented to preserve order in the financial system.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just can't let all banks be liquidated because that would
be chaos,'' Sengoku said in an interview Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats are currently pursuing an alliance with smaller
opposition parties to block the banking bills in the upper house.
</P>
<P>
   The governing Liberal Democrats hold a 12-seat majority in the
lower house of Parliament and are reportedly trying to woo members
of the Communist Party in the upper house, which would give them a
majority there, too.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials have not specified whether they intend to
allow insolvent banks to fail. But the financial markets keep
pushing for some token of seriousness. Shares of Long-Term Credit
Bank, one of the most troubled, are now trading below par value,
and many investors seem to regard the bank as a sort of sacrificial
offering the government must make to prove its commitment to
revamping the system.
</P>
<P>
   ``This means it has been ordered by the market to close,''
Sengoku of the Democratic Party said.
</P>
<P>
   But he also said he foresaw a system-wide panic if the bank were
to go under and suggested that instead, the best solution would be
the nationalization proposed by his party.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi has repeatedly said he is willing to adopt opposition
policies that make sense, but he has so far bided his time. The
governing party is betting that the opposition will be forced to
accept most of its proposals or risk a voter backlash.
</P>
<P>
   But Sengoku predicted Tuesday that voters would instead
appreciate that the opposition was trying to repair the financial
system while the Liberal Democrats were just trying to carry out
``the same old bad policy.''

DOROTHY WEST, 91, HARLEM RENAISSANCE WRITER  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)   By ANDREW L. YARROW   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dorothy West, ``the Kid'' of the Harlem Renaissance circle of
writers and artists in the 1920s who was rediscovered seven decades
later when her novel ``The Wedding'' was published and became a
best-seller, died on Sunday night at New England Medical Center in
Boston. She was 91 and a longtime resident of Oak Bluffs, Martha's
Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. West, who began writing stories at age 7 in her family's
elegant four-story house in Boston, was not yet 20 in 1926 when her
short story ``The Typewriter'' won a prize from the Urban League's
Opportunity magazine. Encouraged, she moved to Harlem and joined
the poets, novelists, musicians and other artists forging a
cultural renaissance there. Long before her death, she was
frequently described as the last surviving member of that group.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought we were going to be the greatest writers in the
world,'' she told The Los Angeles Times in 1995. `We were all young
and we fell in love with each other. We all had the same ambitions:
writers and painters and so forth. We were free. ... We had an
innocence that nobody can have now.''
</P>
<P>
   Langston Hughes gave Ms. West the nickname ``the Kid'' and took
her to Russia in 1932. She asked him to marry her but he declined.
Soon she received a proposal from Countee Cullen, the poet who
received one of the first Guggenheim Fellowships given to an
African-American. She turned him down. She shared an apartment with
Zora Neale Hurston, the writer and folklorist, and when guests came
to the loft of Wallace Thurman, the novelist and editor, she was
always there, sitting on the floor. She had a bit part in the
original stage production of ``Porgy and Bess.'' Claude McKay,
already established as a poet and novelist, scolded her for not
writing more.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were a beautiful, young group,'' she told a Boston Globe
interviewer in 1989. `We drank too much, though. We drank too
much.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. West's first novel, ``The Living Is Easy,'' was not
published until 1948, when the Harlem Renaissance had long faded.
Her second, ``The Wedding,'' about the aspirations and anxieties of
black people living on Martha's Vineyard, appeared in 1995. Both
were written at her family's former vacation home on the Vineyard,
where she had lived year-round since 1947 and was a columnist for
The Vineyard Gazette.
</P>
<P>
   At her celebrity-studded 90th birthday party on the island in
1997, which drew hundreds of well-wishers, she was called ``a
national treasure'' by Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. West's stories and novels used brisk narratives, an eye for
detail and wit to explore the aspirations of well-to-do blacks and
the interplay of race, class and intraracial tensions in America.
Her work was not overtly political, tending to more lyrical
depictions of vanity, longing, love and misunderstanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Color is important, but class is more important,'' Ms. West
often said in the dozens of interviews she gave after ``The
Wedding'' was published by Doubleday and made into a miniseries by
Oprah Winfrey.
</P>
<P>
   Critics praised her storytelling and her pioneering descriptions
of conflict within the black middle class. ``There is an abundance
of psychological and historic richness to her characters,''
Elizabeth Benedict wrote in The Washington Post in 1995, ``and she
can be wickedly eloquent about the costs of living in a world where
the shadings in the color of one's skin are more important than the
bonds between blood relatives.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. West was born on June 2, 1907, in Boston, the only child of
Isaac and Rachel West. Her father, born a slave, built a fruit and
vegetable wholesaling business that lifted the family into the slim
ranks of Boston's black upper middle class. Her mother, a
generation younger, ``spirited, fearless, sassy and smart,''
brought many of her 18 siblings and their families to live with
them.
</P>
<P>
   Family members ``ranged in color from the blond child to me,''
Ms. West wrote in ``The Richer, the Poorer,'' a collection of short
stories and essays published in 1995. ``We were always stared at.
... My mother prepared us. As she marched us down our front stairs,
she would say what our smiles were on tiptoe to hear, `Come on,
children, let's go out and drive the white folks crazy.'
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``She said it without rancor, and she said it in that outrageous
way to make us laugh. She was easing our entry into a world that
outranked us and outnumbered us. If she could not help us see
ourselves with the humor, however wry, that gives the heart its
grace, she would never have forgiven herself for letting our
spirits be crushed before we had learned to sheathe them with
pride.''
</P>
<P>
   The sisters and cousins defended each other against outsiders,
but at home squabbles were melodramatic, Ms. West said.
``Surrounded by all these different personalities, each one wanting
to be first among equals, I knew I wanted to be a writer. Living
with them was like living inside a story.''
</P>
<P>
   Her work was first published when she was 14, in The Boston
Post, and she soon became a regular contributor. After graduating
from the Girls' Latin School at 16, she attended Boston University
and the Columbia University School of Journalism.
</P>
<P>
   In 1932, she and 20 other black Americans including Langston
Hughes, were invited to visit the Soviet Union to work on a
proposed movie about racism in America. The film was never made,
but Ms. West remained in the Soviet Union with Hughes for a year,
returning to the United States only when she learned of her
father's death.
</P>
<P>
   There remains some question about whether she and Hughes were
romantically involved; she proposed to him in a letter in 1933. In
a 1995 interview with The Boston Globe, she said that she never
particularly wanted to marry _ ``Seemed like the man just became
the woman's child'' _ but had wanted a child. The memory of how she
learned she could not was still painful decades later: the white
doctor telling her briskly: ``There are already enough black people
in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. West had no immediate survivors, although she remained close
to many of her cousins.
</P>
<P>
   In 1934, she founded Challenge, a quarterly magazine intended as
a showcase for younger black writers and ``to recapture in the
mid-'30s the literary vitality of the Harlem Renaissance, which had
not survived the Depression.'' Her subsequent magazine, New
Challenge _ which reflected the belief of its associate editor,
Richard Wright, that art is a weapon _ survived only briefly in
1937.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. West became a welfare investigator in Harlem (a job that was
the source for several short stories) and joined the Depression-era
Federal Writers Project. In 1940, she began contributing two short
stories a month at $50 apiece to The New York Daily News, an
association she continued until 1960.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1947, she left New York for good, moving to
Martha's Vineyard and the two-bedroom cedar-shingled cottage in Oak
Bluffs that her father had bought. She lived there the rest of her
life, once writing: ``I have lived in various places, but the
island is my yearning place. All my life, wherever I have been,
abroad, New York, Boston, anywhere, whenever I yearned for home, I
yearned for the island.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Living Is Easy'' was published the next year. In this
semiautobiographical tale, the strong-willed, light-skinned Cleo
Judson _ modeled on Ms. West's mother _ tries to remake her
darker-skinned daughter, and breaks up her own marriage to a former
slave who had made himself ``the Black Banana King.'' The book
satirizes upper-crust black Bostonians.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1940s, Ms. West began writing columns for The
Vineyard Gazette. While caring for ailing relatives in the
now-winterized cottage, she was also slowly writing another novel,
published as ``The Wedding'' in 1995. (``The Richer, The Poorer,''
gathering 13 essays and 17 stories Ms. West wrote between 1926 and
1987, came out later the same year.)
</P>
<P>
   Starting in 1992, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, then a book editor
for Doubleday, had visited the cottage once a week in the summers
to work on the long-stalled novel with Ms. West. Mrs. Onassis died
shortly before its publication, and Ms. West dedicated it to her
memory, writing, ``Though there was never such a mismatched pair in
appearance, we were perfect partners.''
</P>
<P>
   Set in the black community on Martha's Vineyard during the
1950's, the novel is a gently ironic story of a beautiful, blond,
privileged young black woman, Shelby Coles, who is torn about her
planned marriage to a white jazz musician. Using flashbacks from
the wedding day to many past generations, it delves into
interracial and intraracial bigotry. Ms. West's belief in
integration and her penchant for romance coalesced in the final
line she gave Shelby Coles: ``Color was a false distinction; love
was not.''
</P>
<P>
   Oprah Winfrey used the novel for a two-part miniseries this
year. ``It shows a world that most people have rarely seen, a world
where black families are all highly educated, very successful,
living in Martha's Vineyard,'' Ms. Winfrey said.
</P>
<P>
   An energetic conversationalist and inveterate storyteller who
was less than five feet tall, Ms. West kept her distance from the
political upheavals of her lifetime. She went to Communist Russia
with Hughes and the others, she wrote in ``The Richer, the
Poorer,'' because ``I liked them.'' In the 1960s and '70s, Ms. West
was not active in the civil rights movement and found radicals like
the Black Panthers discomfiting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a creative writer,'' she said late in life. ``I'm not a
black with a chip on my shoulder.'' Instead, she often said:
``Color is nothing when you know people.''

NORTH TEXAS LINEBACKER OVERCOMES SETBACKS
</HEADLINE>

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENTON, Texas _ Darron Hester had been an outstanding football
player out of Dallas Hillcrest High School in 1995, and once was
headed to play for Ohio State.
</P>
<P>
   After a few setbacks, he signed with North Texas four weeks ago,
and for this, Hester said, he's a better man.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a lot happen to me on my way here,'' Hester said, ``and
I'm better for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Hester experienced bitter disappointments and learned valuable
lessons on his way to UNT, where less than a week into practice, he
has crept onto depth charts as a possible starter at linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   ``No. 1,'' Hester said of his lessons, ``always take care of
business first.''
</P>
<P>
   It was this lack of attention to detail that almost buried him
back in Dallas three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   His trek to Ohio State ended abruptly when he failed to earn the
necessary test scores. He turned, instead, to Trinity Valley
Community College, and helped them win a junior-college national
championship in 1997, despite playing with a partially torn
anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee.
</P>
<P>
   Hester played through the pain in hopes of securing a Division
I-A scholarship, and it appeared his wishes had been answered when
the University of Houston expressed interest in signing him. He had
decided on Houston only to learn Houston had decided against him _
his knee was too risky.
</P>
<P>
   Hester said he once again felt like a child peering into a toy
store from the sidewalk. ``I thought that my last chance had come
and gone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So, he returned to Dallas with his transferable credits, and
went about settling into a job. It was there he stayed until UNT
secondary coach Gary DeLoach tracked him down in July.
</P>
<P>
   DeLoach had been his defensive coordinator at Trinity Valley
last season, and realized Hester's potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like he could help us out,'' DeLoach said. ``Now, he
has a long way to go. He's very much out of shape, and he's just a
newcomer.''
</P>
<P>
   He was like a Christmas present for UNT coaches, who had spent
all spring poring over linebacking depth charts that lacked depth.
Only sophomore Fred Pertile returns with any starting experience,
leaving two open linebacking spots, a half-dozen inexperienced
returners and Hester.
</P>
<P>
   Hester, a junior, said he can be an impact player at this level.
</P>
<P>
   He realizes he has gained a few pounds that need to be lost, and
that he lost a bit of an edge that needs to be regained.
</P>
<P>
   But the desire is there, maybe more so than ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``He probably knows that for college, this is his last
opportunity,'' UNT coach Darrell Dickey said. ``I think a lot of
times you go in and don't realize what you have until you don't
have it anymore and then to get another chance. He wants to do
something here at this stop.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   PURCELLVILLE, Va. _ Linda Chavez was one of the most powerful
Hispanic officials in the Reagan administration, with an
influential voice in Hispanic affairs. She even had an office in
the West Wing of the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Most conservatives respected her.
</P>
<P>
   Most Hispanic advocates resented her.
</P>
<P>
   And when the Reagan era ended, many thought her power had ended.
</P>
<P>
   But more than a decade after falling from the political
spotlight, Linda Chavez has returned as a conservative leader,
urging assimilation and the use of English among Hispanic
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a year, Chavez has been an adviser to Ron Unz, the
Silicon Valley millionaire who financially backed Proposition 227,
the successful California ballot measure that will put an end to
three decades of bilingual education in the state this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez's public-policy organization, the Center for Equal
Opportunity, which she founded in 1995, is providing legal support
against challenges to the proposition, and is helping New Mexico
parents who oppose bilingual education in that state. She also
promotes her views in a weekly syndicated column, which is
published in 50 newspapers nationwide, including the Philadelphia
Inquirer the Chicago Tribune and the Orange County Register.
</P>
<P>
   But Chavez, 51, brushes off any suggestion that she speaks on
behalf of a larger Hispanic community.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't speak for anyone but Linda Chavez,'' she said in an
interview at her home in Purcellville, where she lives with her
husband, Chris Gersten, who heads the Institute for Religious
Values, a public policy organization he recently founded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in the civil rights business since 1972,'' she
added, trying to explain her appeal. ``I am articulate, and people
are going to come to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of her appeal, her detractors say, is the combination of
her Hispanic heritage and conservative politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``A neoconservative with a Hispanic surname makes her big
news,'' said Raul Yzaguirre, president of the National Council of
La Raza, a Hispanic civil rights organization. ``It is sort of a
man-bites-dog story. This minuscule minority of thought drowns out
the major voices in our community, and in fact we become the silent
majority.''
</P>
<P>
   In her 1991 book, ``Out of the Barrio: Toward a New Politics of
Hispanic Assimilation,'' Chavez writes of a younger Hispanic
population more likely than their parents to assimilate and to
become part of the middle class and are less likely to view
themselves as ``helpless victims of societal pressures.''
</P>
<P>
   Her critics challenge such conclusions as the flawed views of
someone who is neither bilingual nor bicultural. Indeed, one of the
most frequent and persistent criticisms of Chavez as a Hispanic
leader is her lack of fluency in Spanish. They argue that her
message of assimilation, delivered from the comfort of the Virginia
suburbs, has little meaning for millions of Hispanic Americans
carving out a life in a new land.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her assimilation is apple pie and hot dogs,'' said Antonia
Hernandez, president of the Mexican-American Legal Defense and
Education Fund, which is trying to block implementation of
Proposition 227. ``Well, I am an American, and I like chili, and,
instead of apple pie, I like flan, and that doesn't make me less of
an American.''
</P>
<P>
   Abigail Thernstrom, the conservative co-author of ``America in
Black and White: One Nation, Indivisible'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, 1997)
and a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, has known Chavez
for almost two decades and counters that Chavez is ``deeply
committed to racial and ethnic equality and therefore to civil
rights.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't take simply as a given,'' Ms. Thernstrom said.
``that because some Hispanic activists are speaking in voices
different from hers they represent Hispanic public opinion and she
doesn't.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Chavez's experiences are far removed from those of most other
Hispanic Americans. Her father's ancestors came from Spain, and her
mother is of English and Irish descent. Neither spoke Spanish. And
although she is Roman Catholic, she has reared her three sons in
the Jewish faith of her husband.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez says her politics were shaped by her years in the White
House; in academia, where her Hispanic surname prompted
administrators to assign her to teach Chicano literature; and
growing up in Albuquerque, N.M.
</P>
<P>
   Her father, Rudolph Chavez, never graduated from high school and
worked in the family real estate company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Linda adored him,'' said her mother, Velma McKenna Chavez, who
lives in Albuquerque. ``Anything he thought, she thought the
same.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the family not speaking English, Mrs. Chavez explained,
``They had been here so long.''
</P>
<P>
   Chavez's ancestors emigrated to what is now New Mexico from
Spain in the 17th century, and have been primarily English speakers
since the 1870's, her mother said. In fact, after Chavez became
active in politics, she served as president of U.S. English, a
national lobbying group that has led campaigns to make English the
official language of various states.
</P>
<P>
   Her ancestors are like characters in a historical novel: a
great-uncle who fought, under age, in the Union Army in the Civil
War; a bootlegger during Prohibition; and a casino owner in Mexico
who was killed by his partners.
</P>
<P>
   There was also Gen. Manuel Armijo, Governor of the Mexican state
of Nueva Mexico in the early years of the Mexican War. When the
general failed to show up to fight the United States Army near
Santa Fe in 1846, it was not clear whether he had been bribed or
simply felt that the region could not be defended.
</P>
<P>
   ``He turned over the land to the United States,'' Chavez said
with a wry smile.
</P>
<P>
   When Chavez was in the fourth grade, her family moved to Denver,
closer to her mother's relatives. As an 18-year-old freshman at the
University of Colorado, Chavez met Chris Gersten. They married a
year later.
</P>
<P>
   Before entering college, Chavez had been oblivious to racial
differences, her mother said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody thought to ask anybody what they were,'' Mrs. Chavez
said. ``There was no such thing as Hispanic. That was not a word.
Linda started noticing that when she went away to school. Race
became important, and I think that is when the `Hispanic' word was
coined.''
</P>
<P>
   With the raising of racial consciousness in the late 1960's,
Mexican-American students felt empowered. Cesar E. Chavez, the
civil rights leader _ no relation to Chavez _ was organizing farm
workers. Students were protesting the Vietnam War and demanding
ethnic studies programs.
</P>
<P>
   As a college senior, Chavez joined Mexican-American and black
students in demanding affirmative action programs and teaching
remedial courses for minority students. But she said the classes
became what she now calls ``political indoctrination'' camps where
minority students segregated themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Disillusioned by the experience, Chavez some 10 years later
would become an outspoken opponent of racial preferences as the
staff director of the federal Commission on Civil Rights in the
Reagan administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't that I was a conservative,'' she said. ``I was a
liberal Democrat. I think it had to do with my sense of how you
succeed in life, and thinking of yourself as a victim and hating
those that have oppressed you doesn't get you anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from the University of Colorado, Chavez pursued
a Ph.D. in English literature at UCLA and was assigned to teach
Chicano literature. But she found the canon limited, so she
included not only Mexican-American writers in her syllabus, but
also non-Chicano authors who wrote about the Chicano experience.
The first week, 15 students walked out on her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I was more conservative than I knew,'' Chavez said,
``because I found this appalling.''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the semester, her class of 60 students had
dwindled to 15. After she failed a dozen students, she said, they
began ``terrorizing'' her, vandalizing her car and cutting off her
electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Fernando Chavez, son of Cesar Chavez, took an English class with
Chavez. She tried to teach, he said, but students did not take her
seriously and threw her graded papers on the classroom floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of students who were hard on her because they
didn't feel she was, quote, `Chicana enough,''' said Chavez, who is
now a lawyer in San Jose, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   After three semesters at UCLA, before finishing her degree, she
packed her bags for Washington, where her husband had taken a job
with the AFL-CIO.She went to work for Yzaguirre, the civil rights
advocate, who was operating a Hispanic research and consulting
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was somewhat aloof _ it's the kindest word I can think of
_ about her own ethnicity,'' Yzaguirre said. ``Her Hispanic
ethnicity is at most genetic and not cultural.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, Chavez was hired by the American Federation of Teachers
as editor of the union's publications. Albert Shanker, the union's
president, became her mentor and influenced her views on
affirmative action and bilingual education. She began to
re-evaluate her political views while editing work by
neoconservatives like Jeane Kirkpatrick, former chief U.S. delegate
to the United Nations; Judge Robert Bork, whose 1987 nomination to
the Supreme Court raised an acrimonious national debate, and
William Bennett, the former secretary of education.
</P>
<P>
   It was Bennett who recommended her for the job on the Civil
Rights Commission. Then, in 1986, she ran unsuccessfully in
Maryland for the United States Senate. She went to work for U.S.
English, lectured, wrote and discussed political issues on a
variety of television panels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always had a good sense that in Washington, people are
interested in you only because of the position you have,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   She resumed a more active role in politics when conservatives in
California sought her support for Proposition 209, the 1996
initiative that barred state and local governments from using
racial and sexual preferences in hiring, contracting and college
admissions.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez began to be compared with Ward Connerly, the black regent
of the University of California who emerged as a public figure
after strongly endorsing Proposition 209.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to view him as the black Linda Chavez,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   When Unz began to draft Proposition 227, the ballot measure that
sought to end bilingual education in California, he turned to
Chavez, who spoke on campuses and wrote columns advocating its
passage. In his campaign, Unz often cited data from ``The Failure
of Bilingual Education,'' a book published in 1966 by Chavez's
center.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is one of a handful of people who really followed this
issue all these years,'' Unz said. ``The fact that she's personally
from the Latino background means that she directly or indirectly
would be able to talk to some of the parents of these children who
are being forced into the programs.''
</P>
<P>
   Chavez is pleased with the role she played in Proposition 227.
</P>
<P>
   Her next project, will be a book on feminist ideology. The
working title is ``What Went Wrong on the Road to Liberation.''

   Following are excerpts from newspaper editorials and columns on
President Clinton's statement Monday night about his relationship
with Monica Lewinsky:
</P>
<P>
   New York Post
</P>
<P>
   ``I misled people,'' the president said. No, he didn't mislead
people. He lied to them. By using the word ``misled'' instead of
the word ``lied,'' the president lied to the American people.
Again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was,'' he said, ``very concerned about protecting my
family.'' The man who allows his wife to go on the ``Today'' show
to defend him against the charge that he had an extramarital affair
he did have was not concerned about protecting her. He was
concerned with protecting his presidency. By speaking those words,
he lied to the American people.
</P>
<P>
   New York Daily News
</P>
<P>
   Column by Lars-Erik Nelson
</P>
<P>
   Yes, we could once say, he probably did it, but we don't care.
Now we know beyond any doubt that he did it _ that the president
had sex in the White House with a 21-year-old intern. Do we still
not care?
</P>
<P>
   Do we not care that our president lied to us for seven months
and allowed his closest friends and administration officials,
unwittingly, to lie for him?
</P>
<P>
   Up to now, polls have shown Clinton enjoying job-approval levels
of up to 70 percent. But that was when the Lewinsky affair was only
an accusation. Now we get our noses rubbed in it.
</P>
<P>
   Helena Independent Record
</P>
<P>
   Montana
</P>
<P>
   OK. So President Bill Clinton has changed his tune, admitting an
improper sexual relationship with a White House intern less than
half his age, but denying any obstruction of justice or other
wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Big deal. In a sense, it doesn't really matter what if anything
President Clinton has to say on the subject of Monica Lewinsky.
When it comes to Clinton and women, most of us already have made up
our mind, and by now the president's protestations are about the
last thing to change it. ...
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens in the end, Clinton will be remembered as a
President lucky enough to have served during prosperous economic
times, a President whose pro- gressive policies were increasingly
under- mined as much by his move to the center and beyond as by his
declining credibility and a President who shamed his wife and
daughter and his party and the people of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose Mercury News
</P>
<P>
   California
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has dishonored the presidency. He has diminished his
stature as a leader. He has damaged the trust that unites the
people who form his administration. He has embarrassed the country
he swore to protect and safeguard.
</P>
<P>
   He should be profoundly ashamed, and the shame should haunt him
for the rest of his life.
</P>
<P>
   USA Today
</P>
<P>
   The core of the president's argument is the tired White House
refrain that independent counsel Ken Starr's investigation has
``gone on too long, cost too much and hurt too many innocent
people.'' Yet if anything was obvious Monday night, it was that
Clinton could have brought it all to a quick close in January
simply by telling the truth then rather than having it dragged out
of him now.
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street Journal
</P>
<P>
   Legal technicalities aside, the public needs to know how its
government has been conducting itself. What acts may be impeachable
and what standards of evidence apply are questions the Congress
must decide, not ones for Mr. Starr to predetermine. On the other
hand, if Mr. Starr can exonerate Mr. Clinton on Filegate or
Travelgate, Americans deserve to know that too _ not merely have it
asserted by the same White House spinners who assured us Mr.
Clinton never had sex with Monica Lewinsky.

   We are left with the presidential confession, the sad collection
of details and leaks and the spin game that whirls on all sides.
</P>
<P>
   To many of Clinton's political detractors it's an I-told-you-so
affirmation that the man is immoral and not fit to hold office.
</P>
<P>
   To many of his supporters, it's an it-doesn't-really-matter
confirmation that conspirators are desperate to discredit him and
are imposing an unfair standard upon the president's personal life
and foibles.
</P>
<P>
   For the nation, it's a sort of Super Bowl of sordidness,
complete with off-color analysis, play-by-play commentary and
endless _ endless _ on-the-field mayhem.

<P>
   President Clinton has told the American people too little too
late. Months of lying, of stonewalling, of trying to shift the
blame and of spinning the truth have damaged his credibility beyond
repair.
</P>
<P>
   In a ghastly four-minute session, the president told the nation
no more than he had to. It was a calculated, carefully calibrated
effort at damage control.
</P>
<P>
   In was a hell of a comedown from a fireside chat with FDR.

</P>
<P>
   True to form, Clinton offered a quick, weak apology for a
critical lapse of judgment in having the affair and misleading the
public, then attacked Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr for going
too far and hurting ``too many innocent people.'' But Mr.
President, who is to blame for that?
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Clinton fell back on a legal point to defend his
lies and placed the blame for his predicament elsewhere. That won't
endear him to anyone. The country Clinton leads deserves better
than the superficial finger-pointing performance he delivered
Monday night.
</P>

<P>
   It is almost beyond comprehension that Clinton is so lacking in
self-discipline, so reckless, that he engaged in a sordid liaison
with a youthful intern under the same roof with his own family, at
a time he was under scrutiny for alleged sexual misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the public was fully aware of Clinton's reputation and twice
elected him president. It is not Clinton's character alone that
brought about this sorry moment. Other factors are the president's
tenacious enemies and an overreaching independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   It should never have some to this _ but it did.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit Free Press
</P>
<P>
   Michigan
</P>
<P>
   The legacy Clinton was pursuing in such important areas as
education and race relations will be forever tarnished by a sex
scandal. His mantra of taking ``personal responsibility'' rings
hollow.
</P>
<P>
   He has let the whole country down.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not Clinton got your vote in his two campaigns for
president, whether or not he is of your party or your political
ideology, if you are an American, he is your leader. You are
entitled to demand a lot from the person in such a job. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Clinton would like the country to move quickly beyond this
tawdry episode, enjoy the booming economy, and prepare for the next
century. The country probably will, but without its president in
any meaningful role.

 PEAT MARWICK TO HIRE INVESTMENT BANKER 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By REED ABELSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ KPMG Peat Marwick, one of the nation's largest
accounting firms, announced Tuesday that it planned to hire an
investment banker to help it consider the sale of a minority stake
in its consulting business.
</P>
<P>
   Consulting, which brought in $1.5 billion in revenue in the
company's fiscal year that ended in June, accounts for about 40
percent of KPMG's sales.
</P>
<P>
   KPMG, which is based in New York, is contemplating selling
between 20 percent and 30 percent of the consulting business either
to an outside investor or to the public through a stock offering,
George J. Ledwith, a KPMG spokesman, said.
</P>
<P>
   Consulting firms, in need of capital to expand, have been in a
rush to go public. Among those that have recently completed initial
public offerings are International Integration Inc. and Answerthink
Consulting Group, which is made up some former KPMG consultants.
</P>
<P>
   As public companies, these businesses can raise capital to buy
other companies and to finance the expensive computer systems that
they need to serve clients. They are also able to issue stock
options as a way to attract top talent.
</P>
<P>
   If KPMG decides to sell a minority stake, the company said, it
should be able to raise several hundred million dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``This initiative will permit our consulting business to fully
unlock its potential to make acquisitions to grow the business, to
make more alliances with industry leaders like Cisco Systems and
Microsoft, and to implement our strategic initiatives,'' Stephen G.
Butler, KPMG's chairman and chief executive, said in a statement.
The plan was reported Tuesday by The Wall Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
   KPMG's move also seems to be an attempt to jump-start a
consulting business that some observers see as an also-ran, despite
KPMG's contention that its growth rivals that of any competitor of
similar size and scope.
</P>
<P>
   ``They desperately need to differentiate themselves in the
marketplace,'' said Tim Bourgeois, the director of research for
Consultants News in Fitzwilliam, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   If KMPG decides to take its consulting business public, it would
be the first of the Big Five accounting firms to do so. Other firms
have chosen to merge in order to pool their capital for expansion,
but KPMG's combination with Ernst &AMP; Young fell apart earlier this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could lead to a real wave among the other four,'' said
William K. Smith, a portfolio manager for the Renaissance IPO Fund,
noting the fierce competition among the large firms. ``This is a
race. They are all looking over their shoulders.''
</P>
<P>
   But most of the other accounting firms say that they have no
plans to follow KPMG's lead.
</P>
<P>
   Andersen Consulting, which has a much larger business and a
stronger brand name, insisted that it would not sell stock in its
business.
</P>
<P>
   PricewaterhouseCoopers said that it also had no plans for such
action and that it had fulfilled its capital needs through the
recent merger that created it. Ernst &AMP; Young said it considered
itself ``well-capitalized.'' Deloitte &AMP; Touche declined to comment.

GIULIANI'S METHADONE PROPOSAL IS BACKED BY LITTLE EVIDENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID M. HALBFINGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It took Diana, a 34-year-old recovering heroin addict
from the Bronx, exactly 95 days to wean herself from methadone at a
residential clinic on Manhattan's Lower East Side last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I counted every day,'' she says. ``On Dec. 8, they announced I
was drug- free. It was the greatest feeling in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Diana's success in getting off methadone in a little more than
three months would seem to support Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's call to
move 2,000 heroin addicts off methadone at city hospitals _ an
initiative grounded in a belief that most addicts would need only
about 90 days to achieve total abstinence.
</P>
<P>
   But Diana, who spoke on the condition that her last name be
withheld, is hardly typical of methadone users. She is a college
graduate with a long work history and a supportive family. And her
heroin use had lasted only six months, compared with a decade or
more for most recovering addicts taking methadone. Even so, it has
taken her more than a year of intensive counseling, training and
therapy to feel ready to return to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   Experience at the few methadone-to-abstinence programs in New
York shows that they produce lasting results in only a small number
of methadone users and that success comes much more slowly than
city officials might like to believe. Critics say that without any
research to back it, the administration's plan amounts to a risky
experiment in drug treatment on a vulnerable population.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not for everybody,'' said Ruben Medina, chief executive
of Promesa, a Bronx multiservice agency that offers
methadone-to-abstinence treatment along with open-ended methadone
programs. ``Some clients are very strong and prepared to move off
methadone quickly,'' he said. ``With others, who are marginalized
in virtually every definition of the word, you have to, in effect,
rebuild a whole human being.''
</P>
<P>
   The city's policy shift, which could take effect in as little as
two months, has drawn vehement criticism from drug treatment
experts in government and medicine who say it defies decades of
scientific research showing that methadone maintenance offers the
best hope for the vast majority of recovering heroin addicts. Of
those who stop using methadone, they say, more than four out of
five relapse within months, often with deleterious physical,
psychological and social effects.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor has characterized open-ended methadone treatment as an
exchange of one chemical dependency for another, and he has said
that the city would be doing addicts a disservice if it did not
urge them to free themselves of both heroin and methadone.
</P>
<P>
   The Giuliani administration's plan is based on the city's
experience with a methadone-to-abstinence program at Kings County
Hospital in Brooklyn that treats about 50 patients a year, Dr. Luis
Marcos, president of the Health and Hospitals Corp., said.
</P>
<P>
   The program, which lasts 6 to 12 months, is offered alongside a
larger methadone maintenance program that treats 700 people a year
at the same hospital and would be closed under the new plan.
</P>
<P>
   Under the city's plan, said Marcos, those weaned from methadone
in an average of 90 days would receive counseling afterward,
including referrals to so-called drug-free communities and other
rehabilitation programs.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Marcos was unable to provide data on the rate
of relapse among patients. ``We haven't done any scientific
studies, with controlled experiments and so forth,'' the
spokeswoman, Jane Zimmerman, said. ``We're a public hospital
system. We don't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Stephen Zukin, director of clinical and services
research at the National Institute on Drug Abuse, part of the
National Institutes of Health, said he knew of no rigorous studies
of such methadone-to-abstinence programs. He cautioned that such
research ought be done in small numbers, not ``by mayoral decree''
affecting hundreds or thousands of patients.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Vincent Dole, a retired professor at Rockefeller University
who in the early 1960s first promulgated methadone maintenance as a
treatment for heroin addiction, called the Giuliani
administration's plan ``a radical experiment with no research or
background and certainly not with the informed consent of any of
the subjects.''

CANON OFFERS 5 NEW HIGH-SPEED PRINTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Welcome another entrant to the free-for-all that
marketing copiers and printers has become.
</P>
<P>
   First Hewlett-Packard Co. weighed in with printers aimed at the
Xerox Corp.'s market for high-speed corporate applications. Then
Xerox aimed at Hewlett in the household printer market.
</P>
<P>
   Now Canon USA has roared in with five high-speed printers and
copiers that it says will grab $1 billion in sales, or 20 percent
of the high-speed corporate market, by the end of the year 2000.
Lest anyone doubt whose market that is, Canon's publicity slogan is
``X will no longer mark the spot.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've taken Xerox on as we never have before,'' Robert Bryson,
an executive vice president of Canon, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Canon's high-speed products are destined for central
reproduction departments, print-on-demand applications and pay for
print customers like Kinko's.
</P>
<P>
   They include color printers, a printer/copier/scanner hybrid
that can hook into computer networks, and a black-and-white copier
that Canon says will serve as an introduction to customers who will
later trade up to color copiers.
</P>
<P>
   Canon developed the higher speed products specifically for North
American customers, who typically copy five times as many pages as
their Japanese counterparts. Analysts applaud the strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``These new products are exactly what Canon needs to make it in
the exploding color printing and copying market,'' said Theodor J.
Kundtz, an analyst with Lehman Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   Xerox, which will introduce a new black-and-white copier
Wednesday, is not worried. ``These are me-too, follow-the-leader
products,'' said Jeffrey J. Simek, a Xerox spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Outsiders see it that way too. ``Canon is trying to make up for
lost time,'' said Frank Cannata, editor of The Cannata Report, an
information technology newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   That is a bittersweet role for Canon. Canon was one of the first
to offer color copiers, and to connect them to computer networks.
And, it was one of the Japanese companies that pushed Xerox out of
the low-priced copier market in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   But this decade, while Xerox developed corporate accounts, Canon
focused on lower-speed machines, and on making printer engines for
other manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Canon's new products do fill vacant niches. Its $50,000
24 page-per-minute copier fills the gap between Xerox's $38,000
nine page-per-minute product and Canon's $74,000 31 page-per-minute
product.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're inventing a new, mid-to-high end market,'' said Mason
Olds, a Canon assistant general manager.
</P>
<P>
   Reaching that market will not be easy, in that Canon's sales
force does not have the same long-time relationships with corporate
customers that Xerox has.
</P>
<P>
   ``Canon will have to pay a lot more attention to independent
distributors,'' Cannata said. ``Don't underestimate Canon's
commitment, but Xerox doesn't have much to worry about for now.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   When Samantha Reeves, a well-regarded amateur finding her way
through her freshman season on the women's professional tennis
circuit, wanted to hustle herself back into shape after sustaining
an ankle injury late in 1997, she said she decided to experiment
with a newfangled ``all-natural'' dietary supplement, apparently on
the recommendation of a friend.
</P>
<P>
   The product promised to help her burn fat and build muscle, and
it was readily available over the counter at health-food stores. It
sounded like the answer to her prayers: a training and diet aid
that would help her get fit fast and get back to the business of
cracking the top 100 in women's tennis.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Reeves' decision to use the product backfired badly.
Required to submit a urine sample at an event last December as part
of tennis' effort to detect improper drug use, Reeves failed the
test. The dietary product, it turned out, had contained Nor-Andro
19, a variation on the classic steroid nandrolone and one of the
substances banned by the sport. And so Reeves, despite her argument
that she had no intention of taking anything aimed at improperly
aiding her performance, became the first female tennis player ever
to have tested positive for steroids.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never knowingly done anything that would be harmful to
my tennis career,'' Reeves said in a statement that her family
released after her test result was made public this summer.
</P>
<P>
   The International Tennis Federation, which governs the sport,
ultimately did not suspend or otherwise discipline Reeves, who was
ranked No. 1 in the U.S. Girls 18's in 1996, is currently ranked
106th in the world, and is undecided about whether to accept a
college scholarship or turn pro.
</P>
<P>
   Citing her age _ she turned 19 earlier this year _ and
inexperience, and apparently accepting her claim that she was
unaware of the presence of steroids in the product, the ITF instead
called the long and embarrassing ordeal of testing, investigation
and public disclosure ``a sanction in itself.''
</P>
<P>
   ITF spokesman Alun James said the investigation ``proved Reeves
guilty of taking the banned substance and, although the decision
against any further punishment is arguably lenient, if caught
again, she could face a life ban as a second offender.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves' case highlights a little discussed but troubling
question for tennis: With the easy availability of illicit
steroids, and the simultaneous explosion of fitness and
muscle-building products that are sold legally but often with
little warning about what they contain, how many players are trying
to gain an inappropriate edge? Only one other player, Ignacio
Truyol of Spain, has ever been formally detected of having used
steroids.
</P>
<P>
   Can tennis fairly and effectively police such use and the
cheating _ either brazen or accidental _ that results?
</P>
<P>
   ``Tennis is a sport I would not have thought would be
steroid-involved, but there's tons of steroids out there these
days, and they're not all coming from the black market,'' said Dr.
Alan Jones, a pharmaceutics professor at the University of
Mississippi who acts as the toxicology consultant for the company
that administers drug testing for the men's ATP and women's WTA
tours and for the ITF.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said numerous high-tech or nouveau steroids are being
marketed as simple food supplements and training aids and sold
everywhere from the Internet to health-food stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's conceivable that a player could be oblivious to the fact
that they're using something that contains an anabolic substance,''
Jones said. ``They think: It's natural, it's pure, it's good for
me. And that is an absolute fallacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Considering the plethora of legal products, such as creatine,
available to athletes looking to boost their endurance, maximize
their workouts and stave off flab, athletes subject to drug testing
evidently cannot be too careful about what they ingest. Whether in
the guise of vitamins, hormone supplements or food additives, there
is apparently a synthetically engineered anabolic look-alike out
there for everyone, whether the athletes are looking to raise a
barbell or their tennis ranking.
</P>
<P>
   While less invasive than the EPO-type injectables that recently
tarnished cycling's Tour de France, or the substances currently
muddying the reputation of Irish swimmer Michelle Smith de Bruin,
anabolics such as norandrolone, which is not regulated by the Food
and Drug Administration, are far from benign. And once these legal
additives break down in the system, a steroid by any other name
tends to turn into a steroid.
</P>
<P>
   The Nor-Andro 19 in the supplement Reeves chose is a product
that, according to Jones, ``is the new kid on the block, the
popular one right now. It's not a testosterone type of steroid, and
the labs originally weren't testing for it. It's offered as a food
supplement and marketed as a performance and training enhancer that
increases muscle strength, mass and endurance.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones did say he was unaware of the product's ever having been
marketed as a weight-loss product.
</P>
<P>
   Tennis has stepped up its testing and the detection efforts of
its anti-doping program, which is modeled on the one used by the
International Olympic Committee. The ITF, in conjunction with the
WTA and ATP tours, conducts roughly 1,000 tests each year, all of
them random and 10 percent of them in locations other than the site
of tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   The cost to the three tennis organizations is approximately
$500,000 per year, and so far, the only other player found guilty
of using steroids is the 23-year-old Truyol, who said he took them
on the advice of his physician when recovering from an injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``No sport is immune anymore,'' said Dr. Donna Smith of
Substance Abuse Management, the company that administers tennis'
anti-doping program. ``Wherever you have issues of injury recovery
and athletes intent on maximizing their training, you're going to
see this stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our window of detection is small, because most of these
products clear the system within five days, and although we'd like
to do more off-site testing, it's prohibitively expensive. You
always feel like you're one step behind.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   According to the Reeves family, Samantha's use of the steroid
was purely accidental. The only people more surprised than the
player herself were her parents, Jack and Jill Reeves. Their
teen-age daughter was fixated on losing weight, Jack Reeves said,
and, unbeknownst to him and his wife, bought the supplement.
</P>
<P>
   When the family was notified, by fax, of the positive test and
was asked to provide a record of every medication Samantha had
ingested, steroids were not initially revealed as the culprit
behind the positive reading, Jack Reeves said. Then came a phone
call that informed them of the source of the positive result: The
illegal nandrolone metabolites in her system were traced to
Nor-Andro 19. Just after the conclusion of Wimbledon last month,
the ITF announced that Reeves had tested positive for anabolic
steroids.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought it was good news that they'd figured out how the
stuff got into her system; we thought that was the end of it,''
said Jack Reeves, who would not permit his daughter to be
interviewed. ``Then we were told the review board had decided to
pursue the case and test a second sample. It's a kind of
guilty-until-proven-innocent process where you're dealing with a
lot of nameless, faceless parties. They do hold a player
responsible for whatever is in their system, and they're not
particularly interested in how it got there. You'd have to be a
molecular biologist to know this would occur.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a very troublesome, frustrating experience; tennis
is such a mental game, and this has put a lot of extra pressure on
her,'' he said. ``These days, Samantha won't drink a glass of water
without having it analyzed.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Reeves had allowed their daughter to leave high school in
Wisconsin for Dennis Van Der Meer's Tennis Academy in Hilton Head,
S.C., after she was selected for the U.S. Tennis Association
National Junior Team in 1995 and '96. Then, her parents let her
take a year off between high school graduation in 1997 and college
to test the waters on the circuit while retaining her college
eligibility. They had expected to spend the first half of 1998
monitoring their daughter's progress on the WTA Tour; instead, they
spent it helping her weather the six-month investigation by the
ITF's anti-doping panel.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to being the first female tennis player ever to fail
a drug test of any sort, Reeves is also the first player to fail a
test but escape the mandatory one-year suspension for players found
guilty of using a Class One banned substance. On the men's side,
Truyol was suspended for a year in January 1997, and Mats Wilander
and Karel Novacek were previously fined and suspended after testing
positive for cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   If only two players have tested positive after thousands of
tests, does it mean that tennis can rest assured it has no steroid
problem? Some players say no.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Courier, who trained his way to the No. 1 ranking and four
Grand Slam singles championships without steroid shortcuts, said:
</P>
<P>
   ``If being big and strong were the main criteria for being a
good player, then weight lifters would be the best. But I can see
where this stuff might help out some of the more slight guys,
because it can make you train like an animal.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one worked harder on their training than I did, and it
disgusts me to think I may have lost matches to guys who've been
juicing and cycling it out of their systems in time for
competition,'' he said. ``Boris Becker once said that if he knew
for sure everybody else was using steroids, then he would too;
well, not me. I don't want kidney problems at 45.''
</P>
<P>
   Courier recalled a poll of Olympians that asked whether the
athletes would take a drug that guaranteed them a medal even if it
also guaranteed terminal health trouble by mid-life: ``I guess it's
the James Dean thing, live fast, die young, leave a beautiful
corpse _ and a gold medal.''
</P>
<P>
   Debbie Graham, a WTA Tour veteran, said:
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a lot of it going on because of the pressures
in women's sports, and not just to win. There's a lot of pressure
for a woman to look fit in front of a crowd.''
</P>
<P>
   As far as Samantha Reeves is concerned, she continued to play
sporadically this year and Tuesday received a wild-card berth for
the U.S. Open later this month. ``I'm anxious to put the entire
experience behind me,'' she said in a statement she gave to the
U.S. Tennis Association.
</P>
<P>
   Truyol, whose suspension ended in January, has not returned to
the ATP Tour and no longer holds a ranking.

SEEKING TO EXPAND, KORN FERRY FILES FOR INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif.)   (af)  
 By DANA CANEDY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Korn Ferry International, the giant executive search
firm, has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for an
initial public offering, the proceeds of which it plans to use to
expand its business.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which is based in Los Angeles, expects to raise
about $230 million from the offering to repay debt, redeem
preferred stock, expand to the Internet and make acquisitions,
according to the filing.
</P>
<P>
   The IPO would be the latest recent public offering or planned
stock sale by a professional services firm, including one by
another large executive recruiter, LAI Ward Howell, which went
public last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``You do, in general, tend to see companies from one industry
file close together,'' said Ken Fleming, a research analyst with
the Renaissance Capital Corp. ``One company sees that the
environment may be favorable and the same factors are going to be
affecting other companies in that area.''
</P>
<P>
   In the filing, Korn Ferry said its objective is ``to expand its
leadership position as a preferred global executive search firm by
offering a broad range of solutions to address its clients'
management recruitment needs.''
</P>
<P>
   The company has more than 380 consultants in 71 offices in 41
countries. It had revenue last year of $315 million, a 16 percent
increase from the year earlier, but net income declined 41 percent
to $5.2 million, according to the filing.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, the executive search business is booming because of a
strong economy and corporations' emphasis on casting a wide net to
fill top posts instead of simply filling them from within.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, revenues for the top 10 firms grew by 23 percent last
year, according to Hunt-Scanlon Advisers, publisher of Executive
Search Review newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the industry has become more competitive as clients
demand more for their money. That has forced firms to look for ways
to expand, which, of course, requires cash. And in an industry with
a high turnover rate, firms that can offer stock and options may
have an advantage to lure the best talent.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time Korn Ferry has ventured into the
equity markets. The company first went public in 1972, but it was a
much smaller business with thinly traded and volatile shares.
</P>
<P>
   Its founders, Lester Korn and Richard Ferry, found the swing in
the stock price distracting and later repurchased the shares and
took the firm private.
</P>
<P>
   Korn Ferry now wants to be traded as KFY on the New York Stock
exchange.

   It must be some sort of plot. Is it possible that David
Duchovny, star of ``The X-Files,'' doesn't actually like the show?
In an interview published on the BBC entertainment Web site,
Duchovny said his initial impression was that the hit show was
``silly.'' ``I assumed there was no way it would last,'' he said.
He added that he believed his character, Fox Mulder, is ``clearly
insane.'' ``I'd love to be off the TV show,'' he was quoted as
saying, ``but because of my greed I have to give them another two
years.'' Duchovny's manager, Melanie Greene, did not return several
calls seeking comment.

<P>
   Da Vinci's Debut?
</P>
<P>
   Leonardo da Vinci's legend hardly needs burnishing, but a new
book may add yet another credit to his resume. ``Leonardo da Vinci:
The Origins of a Genius,'' by David Alan Brown, asserts that the
young artist worked on Andrea del Verrocchio's ``Tobias and the
Angel,'' which is at London's National Gallery. He says he has
strong evidence of Leonardo's brush strokes on the figure of Tobias
and on a dog and a fish. Brown, curator of Italian Renaissance
painting at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, says
``Tobias'' would effectively be Leonardo's first painting. The book
is to be published next month by Yale University Press.

   Headed Home
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For evidence that American politics used to be more
fun, one need look no further than the story of Andrew Jackson's
missing head. On July 3, 1834, a partisan daredevil named Samuel
Worthington Dewey boarded the newly rebuilt Constitution (``Old
Ironsides''), docked in Boston, and cut off the head of a
woodcarving of President Jackson that adorned the hull. The prank
quickly became legendary, but the head disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom half surfaced at the Museum of the City of New York
in 1936, but the top half _ from just beneath the nose _ was
variously reported to be at a Massachusetts amusement park, at a
museum in Newark and in France. Until now. Starting Sunday, the
museum will display the noggin _ top united with bottom _ in an
exhibit that will also include a precise accounting of its travels.
</P>
<P>
   Striking Out
</P>
<P>
   About 5,000 employees of India's film industry took to the
streets of Bombay Tuesday to protest what they called the
government's failure to curb piracy of movies and music. The
protest, which included several prominent Indian actors, was led by
the Film Makers Combine, which represents technical and artistic
film workers. An official for the group said the industry was
suffering severe losses because of rampant video piracy. ``We are
fighting for our livelihood,'' Umesh Yadav, a sound technician,
told Reuters news service. The Indian film industry is the largest
in the world in terms of the number of movies it produces.

 &HT;    No. 200 doubly fun for Maddux
 &HT;    By I.J. Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ On paper it was a typical Greg Maddux performance.
Nothing fancy, just another efficient win.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this one was special.
</P>
<P>
   The best pitcher in baseball won his 200th game Tuesday night as
the Braves beat the San Francisco Giants 8-4 in their return to
Turner Field after a West Coast road trip.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux won his 16th of the season and lowered his ERA to 1.65 as
the Braves continued to beat up on the Giants this season, winning
for the seventh time in eight meetings.
</P>
<P>
   All nine of the Braves' hits were doubles, the most two-base
hits in a game by Atlanta since 1986.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants gave Maddux some trouble early, but it was the result
of some sloppy play in the field and an uncharacteristic wild pitch
by the Braves starter that let in a run. Maddux went seven innings
and gave up five hits and two runs, one earned, while walking three
and striking out six.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond Maddux, the show belonged to outfielder Gerald Williams,
who again made a case for more playing time. Williams doubled twice
in his first two at-bats, scoring both times.
</P>
<P>
   In the first inning, Giants center fielder Ellis Burks made one
of the best catches of the season. With Williams at third, Andres
Galarraga drove a ball to deep center that Burks tracked, then
leaped for right before the fence, his glove at the top of the
wall. Burks made the catch, crashing his head into the wall and
falling to the ground. He later had to leave the game because of
dizziness.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves scored two in the first off Giants left-hander Kirk
Rueter. Walt Weiss led off the inning with a double and scored on
the two-base hit by Williams, who would come home on Galarraga's
sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants closed within one in the third when Marvin Benard
made it to second on a double error by Braves second baseman Tony
Graffanino. Benard went to third on a groundout and scored on a
wild pitch by Maddux, who got to the plate to retrieve the throw
from catch Eddie Perez but applied the tag too late.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves pushed ahead by two again in the third when Chipper
Jones brought in Williams on a double. The Giants scored their
second run in the fifth when, with two out, Jeff Kent lined a ball
into left and Rueter was waved around third. The throw from Danny
Bautista was strong but it short-hopped Perez and Rueter was safe.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves then put it away in the next two innings, on a
two-run double by Bautista in the sixth, then a bases-loaded double
by Perez in the seventh.

 &HT;    Charlton's past not an issue with Braves
 &HT;    By Michael Lee
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Recently acquired reliever Norm Charlton arrived in
Atlanta this week for the first time since being called up last
Tuesday from Class AAA Richmond.
</P>
<P>
   Just getting settled in, Charlton is living in a hotel. His
locker, though loaded with shoes and home uniforms, doesn't even
have a name above it yet.
</P>
<P>
   All that could change soon. Especially if he could return to the
form that made him one of the ``Nasty Boys'' as a member of the
world champion Cincinnati Reds in 1990 and an All-Star in 1992. But
not, however, if he remains the pitcher whose career has taken a
dip since helping the Seattle Mariners to their first playoff
appearance in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason we brought him here is because he does have a lot
of experience, he's been through the wars. If we can get him back
on top of his game, he can be an asset to us,'' general manager
John Schuerholz said.
</P>
<P>
   Charlton has seen little action since Atlanta signed him Aug. 5,
eight days after he was released by Baltimore, where he went 2-1
with no saves and a 6.94 ERA. In 35 innings, he gave up 36 hits and
27 runs, while striking out 41.
</P>
<P>
   Last season with the Mariners, Charlton made a career-high 71
appearances but was 3-8 with a 7.37 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   He's thrown just three innings in his time in Richmond and
Atlanta combined. In his Braves debut last Wednesday against San
Diego, Charlton pitched one inning, allowing one run on two hits
and two walks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't as prosperous as I wanted,'' Charlton said, ``but
I'm looking forward to the second (outing).''
</P>
<P>
   And an opportunity to contribute to the Braves' stretch run. The
last time Charlton was released in the middle of the season was
1995, when the Phillies gave up on him. He went on to record 14 of
15 save opportunities for Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't expect to be released by Baltimore, (but) I'm
actually kind of happy to get out of there,'' Charlton said. ``This
is the place I wanted to be. Obviously, it's good to be on a team
that has a chance to go to the World Series.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitching coach Leo Mazzone downplayed Charlton's past, good and
bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doesn't matter if you're a veteran or a young'n. It matters
how you throw the baseball,'' Mazzone. ``Hopefully we can get him
going.''

METS ADD SOME POWER TO SHATTER ROCKIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (story will update later)  
 (bl)  
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New York Mets' lineup this season can hardly be
labeled a murderers' row. Going into the first game of Tuesday's
doubleheader at Shea Stadium, the Mets had hit just 91 home runs,
third fewest in the National League.
</P>
<P>
   But they flashed a good deal of muscle Tuesday as Edgardo
Alfonzo, Todd Hundley, John Olerud and Brian McRae hit home runs
off Pedro Astacio. And with Al Leiter (12-4) breaking nearly a
dozen Colorado bats with his pitching, the Mets defeated the
Rockies, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
   The first-game victory pushed the Mets (67-55) a season-best
dozen games over .500 for the second time this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the defense kept us in the game, the homers put us
in front and Al battled all the way against a very good-hitting
team,'' manager Bobby Valentine said between games.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Lopez and John Olerud provided the best defensive gems
behind Leiter, who surrendered 10 hits but allowed just 2 runs in 8
innings before Turk Wendell pitched a scoreless ninth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't particularly sharp,'' said Leiter, who labored
through 135 pitches in his first start in eight days. ``And I
didn't feel like I was as complete today. But any time you allow
two runs in eight innings against a Colorado team, I'll certainly
take it.''
</P>
<P>
   Early in the game, Leiter decided to abandon his changeup and
curve and, in his words, ``resort back to what you know best,
which, for me, is hard in.''
</P>
<P>
   That resulted in a lot of cruelty to some Colorado bats _
especially the ones swung by Mike Lansing, Dante Bichette and Larry
Walker.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm right and the ball's moving a lot, I break a few
bats,'' Leiter said. ``I got three of Lansing's and Bichette a
couple of times. And Walker might've been the most mad. He might
have had a lucky bat or something. I know for him tonight it was.''
</P>
<P>
   Not nearly as lucky as the Mets' bats were for Leiter.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley's second homer of the season was his first at Shea since
he hit his 30th (and last) home run on Sept. 8 last year, before
reconstructive elbow surgery. Tuesday, Hundley belted a 2-1 pitch
from Astacio into the bullpen in right to lead off the fourth and
give Leiter a 3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter had earned it. In the top of the fourth, the left-hander
had left the bases loaded after his defense failed him. Alfonzo
began the fourth by throwing high to first on a grounder to third
by Bichette and pulling Olerud off the bag at first. The miscue was
Alfonzo's first since June 28, snapping a streak of 42 games
without an error.
</P>
<P>
   Vinny Castilla followed with a double over third and just out of
Alfonzo's reach, putting two Rockies in scoring position in a 2-0
game.
</P>
<P>
   But Leiter bore back to strike out Todd Helton and retire
Lansing on a pop-up to short. After an intentional walk to Kirt
Manwaring, Leiter struck out Astacio to end the threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the whole game,'' Valentine said.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter said: ``Three years ago, if I had runners on second and
third with nobody out, they're both scoring. Just through lack of
confidence. And that's just the difference between having a good
year and a bad year.''
</P>
<P>
   In all, the Rockies went 0 for 6 in the first four innings with
runners in scoring position. The Mets, meanwhile, scored in the
first on a single by Mike Piazza that scored Tony Phillips from
third. Phillips had led off the inning with a single to center,
taken second when Alfonzo was hit by a pitch, and then taken third
on a force-play grounder.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets' next two runs came on solo homers by Alfonzo (his
ninth, to left, leading off the third) and Hundley.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley's homer took on added significance in the fifth, when
Colorado finally broke through for a pair of runs. Darryl Hamilton
led off with a double over first, was sacrificed to second by Neifi
Perez, then scored on a double by Walker that Hundley turned into
an adventure in left field.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley, the catcher turned outfielder, had dropped a liner by
Walker for a two-base error in the first. This time Hundley chased
the high fly to the warning track before watching it plop off the
fence. Walker _ who, like Bichette, is chasing Olerud in the race
for the National League batting title _ then took third on a
groundout, before Vinny Castilla drove him home with a single. All
of a sudden, it was a 3-2 Mets lead.
</P>
<P>
   Helton followed Castilla's single with a single that advanced
the potential tying run to second base. But Alfonzo made a nice
play on a grounder by Lansing, forced Helton at second and ended
the threat. And then, in the Mets' fifth, Olerud blasted a two-run
homer (his 17th) some 419 feet to straightaway center field two
batters before McRae looped his 19th home run, a solo shot, to the
opposite field in left.
</P>
<P>
   It gave Leiter a 6-2 cushion, more than enough, it turned out.

   CHICAGO _ When Sammy Sosa pays a visit to Mark McGwire on first
base, do the two men _ the talk of the baseball world, and beyond _
talk about the gross national product, matters of the heart, or
where they stand in relation to Roger Maris?
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, the Cardinals' first baseman, was asked this Tuesday
before the first game of the two-game series between his team and
Sosa's Cubs in Wrigley Field, a series in which, like the contests
between Alydar and Affirmed, or Ali and Frazier, they are dead even
going into the homestretch. McGwire and Sosa had hit 47 homers
each, and, if you're counting, it's a bunch of fingers and toes
away from Maris' single-season record of 61.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talk about things other than baseball,'' McGwire said.
Then, with a wink, he added, that they had made a pact ``to keep it
to ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The sluggers meet for a brief encounter now _ and as they did
two weekends ago in St. Louis _ and then go their separate and
dramatic ways. The conversation of McGwire, the redhead from the
California suburbs, and Sosa, the Cubs' right fielder from the
Dominican Republic, interests others beyond the growing horde of
reporters covering this story.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sammy doesn't speak great English,'' said Mark Grace, the
Cubs' first baseman, ``and I don't think Mark speaks great Spanish,
so I'm not sure of the extent of their conversation. It just might
be: `Hi, Mac.' `Hi, Sammy.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Gant, the Cardinals' outfielder, said, ``They probably talk
about anything but the record. I think they hear enough about
that.''
</P>
<P>
   When Sosa was asked, he said, ``We say that we're going to
retire together.'' Then he laughed, sticking, obviously, to the
pact.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa likes to say that he is pulling for McGwire to break the
record, and for the Cubs to reach post-season play. ``I'm not
thinking about chasing nothing,'' he said Tuesday. ``Just get in
the playoffs.'' But he admits to taking great pleasure in all the
attention surrounding this home run business.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a gift to me,'' he said. He has spoken often about
the mean circumstances in which he grew up in the little town of
San Pedro de Macoris, where he shined shoes and picked oranges to
help his widowed mother put food on the table. ``I'm happy to go do
my job and everyone go crazy. I love it. Oh, what a country!''
</P>
<P>
   And he does keep an eye on the competition _ watching sports
shows on television to keep abreast, like most fans, of the McGwire
doings. ``Sometimes I see that he is trying too hard to hit a home
run,'' Sosa said. ``Sometimes I wish he would relax more at the
plate.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, McGwire seeks to ease the pressure off himself by
saying that so much goes into breaking the record _ from staying
healthy, to getting pitchers not to walk you _ that it may be
beyond the hitter himself. ``A real accomplishment is hitting 50
homers in a season,'' he said. ``Only 16 players have ever done
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, yes, of course, but, Mark, if you did hit a 62d homer this
season? And so the questions go.
</P>
<P>
   ``What would you do with the ball?'' he was asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give it to the Hall of Fame,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And what would you pay for it?''
</P>
<P>
   ``In dollars? Nothing, but I would give bats, balls, a cap, a
jockstrap, some underwear _ the usual.'' And a smile appeared
within his red mustache and goatee.
</P>
<P>
   As he spoke, one observed the pneumatic forearms of the man,
forearms that would have made Popeye envious, and intrigued Olive
Oyl.
</P>
<P>
   ``Genetics,'' he said. ``My father is a big man _ he was a
boxer.''
</P>
<P>
   As for hitting home runs, he said that no one really tries to
hit homers. ``You see the ball, you try to center it on the bat _
and you run around the bases,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds easy. Why more batters don't do it, then, is a kind of
mystery.
</P>
<P>
   After Sosa took batting practice before Tuesday night's game, he
looked to the Cardinal side of the field, and saw the team doing
stretching exercises. He made a beeline for McGwire, who was
twisting on the ground. A phalanx of reporters and cameramen
followed Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get away! Get away!'' McGwire shouted, laughing. Then he got
up, and he and Sosa hugged. And then they parted. It seemed that
neither had time to whisper any kind of sweet nothing in the
other's ear.
</P>
<P>
   Watching nearby was Dan Radison, the Cubs' first-base coach, who
has had the best opportunity to eavesdrop on Sosa and McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't quite catch what they were saying,'' he said. ``It
can get noisy in the ball park.''

DEFENDANT DENIES WAR CRIMES AT NAZI CAMP 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Over 47 years, Jack Reimer, the retired businessman
who is accused of participating in Nazi atrocities, has told many
stories of his wartime experiences to many investigators _ so many,
he has maintained during four days of testimony in U.S. District
Court, that he was no longer sure of what he knew, when he knew it
and what he really meant to say.
</P>
<P>
   The struggle to pin Reimer down on his often contradictory
statements reached a peak Tuesday in his civil trial before Judge
Lawrence McKenna. Justice Department lawyers, who are seeking to
have Reimer's U.S. citizenship revoked, began a laborious
cross-examination that focused on inconsistencies in his various
accounts of what he did at the Polish concentration camp Trawniki.
</P>
<P>
   According to the government, Reimer, now a 79-year-old retired
restaurant manager, was a much-decorated officer and willing killer
who participated in the mass murder of Jews, the brutal crushing of
the Warsaw ghetto uprising and the training of guards who
terrorized Jewish inmates at notorious camps like Treblinka and
Sobibor.
</P>
<P>
   Reimer steadfastly denied that he had any knowledge at the time
of Nazi atrocities. He frequently testified about some event or
date during the war, only to say under questioning that he had no
recollection. What he knows, he often said, came from wartime
documents and witness statements gathered by the government over
the course of its long investigation.
</P>
<P>
   That Reimer worked for the SS officers who ran Trawniki from
mid-1941 to 1944 is not in dispute _ although Reimer has admitted
he does not remember if he mentioned it when he first applied for a
U.S. visa in 1951.
</P>
<P>
   Reports by U.S. military investigators at the time indicate that
Reimer did not tell them about Trawniki until a second round of
interviews in 1952. Reimer said he did not know why his initial
application listed his wartime whereabouts at two other Polish
cities that he could not remember ever visiting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't recall what I knew then,'' he told Edward Stutman, the
Justice Department lawyer who questioned him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are not my words,'' he added when shown the application
he now repudiates. ``Those are not my statements. They only got in
there by suggestion, by I don't know who.''
</P>
<P>
   Reimer has steadfastly maintained that he was merely a prisoner
of the Germans throughout his time at Trawniki and that except for
a brief period when he trained a group of fellow prisoners to serve
as guards for the Nazis, he spent the war as the Trawniki paymaster
and rarely left the isolated confines of the camp's administrative
office.
</P>
<P>
   Ramsey Clark, his lawyer, said the documents provided by the
Justice Department did not prove otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department contends that if it can be proved that
Reimer persecuted even one person during the war on the basis of
race, religion or national origin, he would be ineligible for U.S.
citizenship. Government lawyers said that whether the act was
voluntary or not, it would still disqualify him.
</P>
<P>
   At various times over the last six years, Reimer has made
contradictory statements on whether he took part in any atrocities.
One of the strongest pieces of evidence against him was his
statement during a 1992 interrogation by three Justice Department
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   He said then that he was at the site of a killing of 50 to 60
Jews at a pit outside Trawniki. But he said he overslept, arrived
late and saw only one Jew who seemed to be alive. Reimer said he
shot him.
</P>
<P>
   The story, including its most potentially damaging detail, has
evolved and shifted since then. In interviews with the news media
and in depositions, Reimer said at different times that all the
victims were dead when he arrived, that he fired over the heads of
the people in the pit to avoid killing them, and that the victims
were not Jews but Polish railroad workers.
</P>
<P>
   Questioned by Stutman on Tuesday, he said he remembered
stumbling on the way out of his barracks to the pit and was knocked
unconscious. He said he was brought out to the pit and forced by an
SS commander to shoot at the bodies inside, but that he was not
sure if he hit anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Reimer said his statement in 1992 _ that he knew he killed one
of the people in the pit _ was not true. ``It grew in me over 50
years,'' he said. ``Thinking about it, listening about it _ don't
you see how I exaggerate over the years?''

Ekes Out 
A Profit 
 eck,14p10 sw,17.3   
 Quarterly results beat 
analysts' expectations 
 ,14p10  By David Einstein 
   Chronicle Staff Writer 
   Showing signs of rebounding from a disastrous war with
Microsoft, Internet pioneer Netscape Communications beat Wall
Street expectations yesterday by reporting a token profit for the
third quarter.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mountain View-based Netscape said it eked out a net profit of
$88,000 (0 cents per share) on revenues of $150.2 million, although
it had an operating loss of $2.1 million. The net earnings exceeded
analysts' forecasts of a small loss.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Netscape lost $44.7 million (53 cents) on revenues of
$135.9 million in its quarter that ended in June. The company has
since moved its fiscal year ahead by one month.
</P>
<P>
   The results were released after the market closed. Netscape
shares gained $1.81 to $32.13 in yesterday's trading.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape, which sells Internet software to corporations and
operates a popular Web site, posted solid growth in both those
businesses. Revenues from software and associated services such as
consulting grew 16 percent from the previous quarter to $111.6
million, while the Netcenter generated $38.7 million, a 24 percent
increase.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; x  &LR; ``Overall, we are pleased with the results,'' said chief
executive Jim Barksdale. ``We're seeing strong momentum in both the
enterprise software and Netcenter businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Netscape, which pioneered the Web browser, was badly bruised in
a battle over browser market share with Microsoft. In fiscal 1997,
Netscape lost $115.5 million as the Redmond, Wash., software giant
ate into its business.
</P>
<P>
   Early this year, Netscape decided to give its browser away _
matching Microsoft's successful strategy _ and to concentrate on
selling more-expensive software used by companies to manage their
intranets.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; uncx  &LR; Netscape also embarked on a campaign to reinvent its Web
site as an Internet portal offering news, shopping, free e-mail and
financial services. The company believed its site, which is among
the most popular on the Web, could generate significant revenue
even while competing against other top portals such as Yahoo,
America Online and Excite.
</P>
<P>
   During the just-completed quarter, Netscape beefed up Netcenter
with a new look and signed several high-profile deals to obtain
content for the site. It enlisted Citibank to provide financial
services and arranged to get local content from AOL's Digital City.
</P>
<P>
   The earnings results, which were released after the market
closed, cheered analysts who had considered the third quarter
crucial to Netscape's stability.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like a good quarter,'' said Andrea Williams of Volpe
Brown Whelan. ``They exceeded both top and bottom line estimates.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; x  &LR; Williams said it is too early to say whether Netscape is out
of the woods, ``but there are positive indications that they're
getting traction on both sides of their business.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; uncx  &LR; ``It was what they needed to do to maintain credibility
and instill confidence in their strategy,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape also announced that Adobe Systems chief executive John
Warnock has resigned from the board of directors, to be replaced by
William Campbell, chairman of Intuit.

NOW IS TIME FOR RANGERS TO STEP IT UP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By GIL LeBRETON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The American League schedule has not been kind to those
prisoners of room service, the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Red Sox haven't been so kind to them lately, either.
</P>
<P>
   Matched against a division foe who roosts two time zones and one
Disneyland away, the Rangers were scheduled to return home today
after eight days in crowded, hostile places.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody was mugged. Nobody fumbled a punt in Spanish. But the
Rangers left Boston yesterday knowing their road trip could
have/should have been a lot more memorable than 2-and-6.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it does matter that the Rangers played the Cleveland
Indians, mighty New York Yankees and Red Sox to quasi-standstills.
Style points count when you're being surveyed for possible
postseason body language.
</P>
<P>
   But losses are losses. And teams with high aspirations need to
be making the defensive plays, delivering the clutch hits and
hurling the game-turning innings that make a team a champion.
</P>
<P>
   On the road trip, the Rangers were erratic on all three counts.
</P>
<P>
   And thus, here they make their pillow today, trailing the
Disney-owned Anaheim Angels and unable to salt away a division that
could have/should have been seized three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   For the next five nights, the opponents will be the Indians and
Yankees again. The home team needs to win at least three of the
five.
</P>
<P>
   Says who?
</P>
<P>
   Says Sigmund Freud, says Zonk, says anyone else who has tried to
study this team as it has treaded water this season.
</P>
<P>
   The loyal home fans _ and they have been more than loyal and
forbearing _ need to see some sign that their five-month vigil
isn't going to be in vain. They want to see this Rangers team, once
and for all, mark its own turf.
</P>
<P>
   The rumblings from the West Coast precincts are encouraging for
the Rangers. The Mariners' ship is starting to look like the Edmund
Fitzgerald. The Angels have plates spinning left and right.
</P>
<P>
   For all of their wishful talk in Seattle about mounting a
late-summer comeback, the fact is that the Mariners are still
palpably closer to having the worst record in the American League
than they are to contending for a wild-card spot. The talk in
Seattle these days isn't about playoffs, but rather when general
manager Woody Woodward is going to be lashed to the mast of the
Bremerton ferry and whether eager Mariners fans will get to see it.
</P>
<P>
   And now, it's really gotten cheeky. Assistant general manager
Lee Pelekoudas weighed in in ``The Seattle Times'' on his views
about Randy Johnson's ``resurgence'' in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing to see that someone's performance can turn around
so abruptly,'' Pelekoudas told ``The Times''.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had Randy pitched the way he's pitching now, this team would
be in a different position.''
</P>
<P>
   This unseemly remark came in the wake of the Mariners returning
from a 5-4 road trip, a trip in which they won the first four.
</P>
<P>
   But what nerve. The reason the Mariners are double digits under
.500 is because of Randy Johnson?
</P>
<P>
   Pelekoudas even chided the big thank-you ad that Johnson took
out in the Seattle newspapers after the trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest thanks he could have given the fans in Seattle,''
Pelekoudas said, ``was to go out strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Wait a minute. Isn't this the same Seattle front office that
somehow botched deals over the last year that could have brought
them Bartolo Colon, Mariano Rivera, Andy Pettitte or Ismael Valdes?
</P>
<P>
   In Anaheim, there apparently are no botched deals. Just the
plates spinning.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels responded to the Rangers' bold moves of acquiring
Esteban Loaiza, Todd Stottlemyre, Royce Clayton and Todd Zeile by
adding . . . Mike Fetters and Jeff Juden?
</P>
<P>
   With the AL West there for the taking, manager Terry Collins has
turned over the holes in the team's offense to Troy Glaus, Justin
Baughman and Todd Greene.
</P>
<P>
   But look who's in first place.
</P>
<P>
   For the Rangers, who launch their eight-game homestand tonight,
it might be time for that speech again _ that Johnny Oates speech
about not sitting on their posteriors, waiting for new owner Tom
Hicks' money to bail this thing out.
</P>
<P>
   Another deal might yet be coming. But the Rangers are amply
equipped for the weeks ahead with the bodies and arms they have
now.
</P>
<P>
   They simply need to rise to the occasion. They need their No. 1
pitcher, whether it's Stottlemyre, Loaiza or Rick Helling, to
perform the way the Indians', Yankees' and Red Sox' No. 1s have
just performed. They need their first baseman to deliver in the
clutch the way that Mo Vaughn did last night.
</P>
<P>
   They need to come home tonight and mark their turf.
</P>
<P>
   Style points and playing the Yankees ``close'' are fine. Seizing
first place, once and for all, would be so much better.

 CHRON - APPLE ADS  
 THE SELLING OF APPLE'S iMAC   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
Apple Computer is putting an extraordinary number of eggs in its
iMac basket.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Cupertino computer-maker's $100 million iMac advertising
budget represents an estimated 15.4 percent of this year's sales of
the chubby, teal-colored desktop. Most companies spend only 2
percent to 2.5 percent of product sales on advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoa,'' said advertising executive Alan May, when told of
Apple's expected advertising-to-sales ratio.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the outlay may make sense for Apple, which is struggling
to boost its 3.1 percent share of the PC market, down from a high
of 9.8 percent in 1988, according to Dataquest.
</P>
<P>
   Apple's marketing campaign is as important for re-establishing
the company's credibility as it is for selling iMacs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really kind of a make-or-break thing for Apple,'' said
May, media director at Anderson &AMP; Lembke, a San Francisco ad agency
that specializes in technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got to have a winner, so they're probably not even
worried about the advertising-to-sales ratio.''
</P>
<P>
   About $50 million of the ad budget will be spent in the United
States and Canada, with the other half going to Europe, Japan and
other international markets, according to Apple.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Microsoft spent an estimated $100 million to $200
million worldwide to advertise Windows 95 _ probably the biggest
product launch ever. It spent a paltry $10 million to promote
Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   Apple won't discuss specifics about its expected return on the
advertising. But Allen Olivo, senior director of worldwide
marketing communications, said ``the upside revenue potential is
absolutely huge'' given the tens of millions of potential customers
around the globe who will be exposed to the ads.
</P>
<P>
   So what kind of a return will Apple get?
</P>
<P>
   May estimated that the global campaign will generate about 10
billion ``impressions,'' the number of times consumers are likely
to see the ad.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Kunstler, an analyst with J.P. Morgan Securities in San
Francisco, expects the company to sell 500,000 iMac's this year at
$1,299 each, which will generate close to $650 million in revenue.
</P>
<P>
   The $100 million ad campaign would be 15.4 percent of that
revenue total.
</P>
<P>
   Kunstler estimates the gross profit margin _ before costs such
as advertising _ at about 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Apple won't disclose the line's expected net profits, other than
to say it expects a net profit this year on the iMac, even with the
hefty advertising budget.
</P>
<P>
   The foremost goal of the campaign ``is to signal that Apple is
back in the consumer marketplace with an absolute vengeance,''
Olivo said. ``We were the first computer marketed to consumers and
... we're coming back to claim that stake.''
</P>
<P>
   Olivo noted that companies including IBM, Microsoft and Intel
together are spending as much as 10 times more money to promote the
rival ``Wintel'' computer platform.
</P>
<P>
   ``So yes, this is a very big launch, but on the other hand, I
believe it is a very proportionate response.''
</P>
<P>
   Apple's primary targets are the 25 million consumers who already
own an Apple desktop and other people who have never owned a
computer but are looking to buy. Families with children are
expected to buy at least half of the iMacs sold and college
students will be another big segment, said Olivo.
</P>
<P>
   The first TV spots for the new iMac appeared on ABC's
``Wonderful World of Disney'' last Sunday. &UR;  &LR; In the next few months,
advertisements will appear on network and cable television, in
consumer magazines such as Newsweek and People, on the radio and on
billboards, but not in newspapers &UR;  &LR; or on the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   The primary message of the campaign is that the iMac is simple
and easy to use, particularly for surfing the Web. The look of the
ads reflects the simplicity message, generally showing one item
such as an iMac, a mouse or an outlet against a pure white
backdrop.
</P>
<P>
   The ads are designed to go hand in hand with the company's Think
Different branding campaign, which launched last fall. Those ads,
which feature black and white portraits of independent thinkers
such as Mahatma Gandhi, John Lennon and Amelia Earhart, will run
concurrently with the iMac spots.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; All of the ads were created by TBWA Chiat/Day of Venice.
</P>
<P>
   Kunstler said it's all well and good if the iMac is a success,
but ``the thing that's important to me is can they sustain the
momentum'' with future product introductions. ``That's not to say
that (the iMac) is a flash in the pan; I'm actually quite
hopeful,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Lim, a principal analyst with Cybermedia Convergence
Consulting, said the iMac ads should be effective because they
focus on the characteristics of the computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fail to see why anybody should be interested in buying a
computer just because they flash a picture of a dead person on the
screen,'' said Lim, a former Apple marketing executive, referring
to the Think Different campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Kunstler estimates total 1998 sales for Apple will reach $5.878
billion and net income will be $245.3 million, taking into account
a $10 million extraordinary item. Most of those sales come from the
Power Macintosh G3, a computer used in desktop publishing. Apple is
planning to launch a new portable computer early next year.

STREET SMARTS/MARK VEVERKA  
 AFTER VINEGARY IPO, GOLDEN STATE SHARES POISED TO POP A CORK 
</HEADLINE>
 CHRON - STREET SMARTS  Golden State Vintners has turned sour since going public last
month, but the company's first earnings report tomorrow and the
initiation of analyst coverage should give the wine concern some
legs.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The stock has been crushed by a moribund initial offering market
and by dour national press about the wine industry.
</P>
<P>
   But for those investors who are compelled to pick some grapes
for their portfolio (and judging by the response to an earlier
column, there are a lot of readers intoxicated with wine stocks)
Golden State certainly is in the bargain bin these days.
</P>
<P>
   After going public at $17 a share on July 22, Golden State went
sideways for three days before starting its precipitous descent.
(It had a brief pop above $18 on its first day of trading.)
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Golden State shares hit the bottom of the barrel on
August 5 at $10.88, before creeping back to the current price of
$12. That's still roughly a 30 percent discount to the IPO price,
which may entice stock pickers who were interested in the company's
prospects at $17.
</P>
<P>
   The stock is poised for a modest, short-term bounce. Earnings
for the Greenbrae company's fourth quarter ended June 30 are
expected to be in line with what management told institutional
investors during IPO road shows.
</P>
<P>
   And as long as that is better than last year's numbers, the
market should be content with the news. (Of course, analysts have
yet to publish their first research reports with financial
projections on the company.)
</P>
<P>
   Golden State's slowest quarters are during the second half of
the year. The company racked up only $10 million in sales during
the fiscal fourth quarter last year, nearly one-tenth of its total
annual sales of $95.8 million. Net profit for the fiscal year was
$6.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason why Golden State shares conceivably could get a
lift is because of bullish analyst reports. Brokerage researchers,
who are required to honor a 25-day quiet period after a company
goes public, are expected to initiate coverage after the company
releases its year-end results.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, if the underwriters' corporate finance departments
thought the stock was worth $17, their sell-side analysts
(researchers who recommend stocks for brokers to peddle) are likely
to fawn over the stock at $12.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  But what caused Golden State's shares to crash in the first
place?
</P>
<P>
   They fell victim to a double punch. First, timing was atrocious.
Non-Internet IPOs have struggled in recent weeks, and Golden State
was not immune to the downdraft despite lead underwriter Goldman
Sachs' support for the shares in the early go-ing.
</P>
<P>
   Second, Barron's ran a bearish cover story August 3 predicting
that a wine glut was imminent.
</P>
<P>
   The Barron's piece, which smacked the entire wine sector,
fixated on a 24 percent rise in the amount of new acres devoted to
growing wine grapes since 1991, predicting that oversupply would
lead to lower wine prices.
</P>
<P>
   But the bulls argue that Barron's failed to address the demand
side of the equation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The article was decidedly negative in tone and unfortunately
short on facts,'' according to a research note by analyst David
Goldman of NationsBanc Montgomery Securities, which was not a
Golden State underwriter.
</P>
<P>
   To the contrary, ``we are in the midst of a very serious
shortage of grapes. Sure, grape supplies could increase by 9
percent or so per year over the next three years, but demand for
California (premium) wines surged at an average of nearly 11
percent'' per year during the past decade, Goldman states.
</P>
<P>
   Those issues aside, Golden State faces a perception problem. It
isn't a name brand, such as other publicly held wineries like
Robert Mondavi or Beringer. What's more, the company is a bulk
producer, which means that it crushes grapes and ages wine but
doesn't usually bottle the stuff.
</P>
<P>
   But ``bulk wine'' shouldn't be confused with ``jug wine.'' In
fact, even though Golden State doesn't possess the brand sizzle of
Mondavi or Beringer, it is a huge supplier to premium winemakers.
</P>
<P>
   In turn, it theoretically is a wine play of less risk. Golden
State is a supplier and vendor to several big wineries, some of
them publicly held. If one has a bad year, Golden State's stock
doesn't necessarily head south because it isn't totally dependent
on that customer's performance. Its risk is spread over a range of
wineries.
</P>
<P>
   Caveat Emptor: Wine stocks are not necessarily the best
investments, because they are subject to the same unpredictable
whims as agricultural stocks, meaning that Mother Nature's future
performance is difficult to forecast. In addition, vino stocks
might be best suited for people who like wine and want to learn
more about the industry by being a shareholder.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
On the Rebound
</P>
<P>
   Monday's column on the prospects of a new basketball league that
would pay players to attend college sparked enormous response. It
will be nearly impossible to answer all of readers' queries about
the Collegiate Professional Basketball League, but I wanted to
address a couple of recurring themes in some of your missives.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, as an investment, the league is a high-risk
venture for a select group of sophisticated investors. To be sure,
the financial track records for new professional leagues are
dubious at best.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, this entrepreneurial league would not supplant
college basketball. At best, it might spur positive change in the
National Collegiate Athletic Association and give kids on the
margin more opportunity to play.
</P>
<P>
   That already may be happening. In yesterday's Wall Street
Journal, an NCAA official said the organization was reviewing its
policies about letting athletes earn money while in college.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, however, the purpose of the column was to
trigger debate about changing the economics of professional and
college sports. The idea was to provoke thought and reaction. And I
believe, judging by the passionate calls and messages, that it was
a layup.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, to the anonymous caller who suggested that I
``become a comedy writer'' because he thought the column's premise
was so hilarious: I think you're pretty funny, too.

(JT) 
 By DON VAN NATTA Jr. and JAMES BENNET   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When President Clinton strode into the Rose Garden
on August 6, his jazzy gold and navy necktie stood out sharply
against his white shirt and sent a jolt through certain lawyers
around town.
</P>
<P>
   They were not clotheshorses struck by a rare Washington fashion
statement. They were prosecutors in the office of Kenneth Starr,
wondering if the president might have dressed to obstruct justice _
by sending a secret signal to Monica Lewinsky as she testified
before the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky, the former intern at the center of the
investigation into sex and lies at the White House, had said during
her debriefings with prosecutors in recent weeks that she had given
Clinton the Zegna tie on his 50th birthday, in August 1996.
</P>
<P>
   According to what Ms. Lewinsky told a close friend, Ms. Lewinsky
told the president that because they would not be able to see each
other every day, ``when I see you wearing this tie I'll know that I
am close to your heart.''
</P>
<P>
   On the day of her testimony, Clinton was inveighing against
handguns in a televised ceremony. Prosecutors apparently wondered,
Was the tie a sign, a plea for solidarity?
</P>
<P>
   If it was, it did not work. Ms. Lewinsky did not learn of
Clinton's choice of neckties until she turned on the television
that evening and saw a clip of him in the Rose Garden, her friends
said. That day, she had contradicted her sworn affidavit,
testifying that she and the president had had an affair in the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   The necktie was evidently covered by a subpoena sent to the
White House for gifts and other evidence by prosecutors for Starr.
But apparently it was not turned over by Clinton at that time.
</P>
<P>
   Clothing has become something of a leitmotif in Starr's
investigation. He has pursued a great deal of circumstantial
evidence in his investigation of Clinton, including gifts like a
T-shirt that he gave her. One of Starr's potentially strongest
pieces of evidence is a navy blue dress, bought at the Gap, that
Ms. Lewinsky turned over to prosecutors. They are having it tested
to determine whether it bears stains from a sexual encounter with
the president.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, during more than four hours of testimony at the White
House, prosecutors asked Clinton why he chose to wear that
particular tie on that particular day, one Clinton adviser said. An
ally of Clinton described the inquiry into neckwear as an example
of how the Starr investigation had gone rambling along irrelevant
and peculiar byways. ``The obstruction of justice stuff was kind of
goofy,'' one Clinton adviser said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The President was said to have smiled at the question and
expressed some bafflement. Perry-Mason-style, the prosecutors then
pulled out a photograph of the tie. Clinton was said to have
indicated that it was possible she had given it to him but that he
certainly was not trying to communicate anything by wearing it. The
exchange was said to have provided a rare light moment in a
grueling session.
</P>
<P>
   But the tie has meant a lot to Ms. Lewinsky, who has looked at
television reports to see if the president was wearing it. In June,
Ms. Lewinsky had noticed that Clinton had worn the tie she had
given him on three occasions in recent months: on the day he left
for his trip to China, the day he returned from China and several
days later, in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky had given Clinton six ties during their 18-month
relationship, which began in November 1995.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief speech on Monday night, Clinton contradicted his
previous denials and acknowledged that he had had a relationship
with Ms. Lewinsky that was ``not appropriate'' and ``wrong.'' That
night, Ms. Lewinsky's friends were dismayed that he seemed to send
her no signals whatsoever.
</P>
<P>
   He wore a patterned blue tie, of undetermined provenance.

ARENA COULD BUILD NATIONAL TEAM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT FRENCH  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A huge decision should be forthcoming this week from Hawaii,
where U.S. Soccer's Annual General Meeting is taking place. Oh, and
a new president, someone to step in for Alan Rothenberg if such a
thing is possible will be selected, too.
</P>
<P>
   The most visible determination concerns the new national team
coach, either former U.S. boss Bora Milutinovic or D.C. United
coach Bruce Arena, if what appears to be so is so. Milutinovic
apparently was the frontrunner until Rothenberg met with Arena at
Major League Soccer's All-Star weekend, and now sources close to
discussions report Arena appears likeliest to get the post.
</P>
<P>
   That's good news. Arena is a winner who has proven adept at
developing talent and building teams with superior talent and
chemistry, skills that would serve him well at the international
level and in whatever role he might play with regards
</P>
<P>
   to Project 2010, U.S. Soccer's plan to become World Cup
contenders in the next 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   Arena, whose brusque manner has made him some enemies within the
federation, has some international experience he guided the 1996
U.S. Olympic team in a worthy showing against far stronger
competition but, most important, has won everywhere he's been. He
captured five NCAA titles at Virginia and won the first two MLS
crowns with D.C. United. And D.C. on Sunday won the CONCACAF
Champions Cup, the greatest accomplishment by an American club.
</P>
<P>
   Giving Arena the reins makes sense. He knows U.S. talent and can
begin to rebuild the squad in advance of the 2002 World Cup, using
a planned exhibition against Australia this fall and next year's
Confederations Cup in Mexico where World Cup finalists France and
Brazil are likely U.S. opponents to test his schemes and the player
pool. If, after two years, Arena hasn't done the job, it's not too
late to bring in Milutinovic, or perhaps Carlos Queiroz, to make
things right before heading to the Far East.
</P>
<P>
   The decision is primarily Rothenberg's, though Saturday when
either Dr. Bob Contiguglia or Larry Monaco is elected to a
four-year term as president he will no longer be in charge, at
least not officially.
</P>
<P>
   Contiguglia, 56, a Denver kidney specialist who chaired the U.S.
Youth Soccer Association in 1990-96, is the favorite in Saturday's
election, although Monaco, 60, a retired Washington-area lawyer and
a U.S. Soccer executive vice president, has plenty of support.
Ultimately, it may not matter who wins.
</P>
<P>
   After an eight-year reign, during which American soccer has
grown from a small, struggling organization into a rich and
powerful player in world sport, Rothenberg will continue to exert
heavy influence on the game. That, no matter what criticism of his
reign may be valid, is very good news, indeed.
</P>
<P>
   A `Super' millennium?
</P>
<P>
   What sounds like a European Super League, with all the best
teams on the continent, is two years from reality regardless of
whether anybody thinks it's a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   Plans for a 32-team venture, featuring Juventus, Manchester
United and Real Madrid of Europe, are more or less finalized, with
Bayern Munich manager Uli Hoeness whose squad would take part
confirming Italian and English reports that it's a done deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concept of the European league is developed to the last
comma,'' he told weekly magazine Focus. ``Even if the German
(federation) or UEFA refuse to support it, the league will start''
in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   If so, club soccer in the new millennium won't be much like it
is now, and that's not necessarily good news. The best of the best
will leave their national leagues to compete in a super Super
League, which would leave the sport's major leagues Italy's Serie
A, England's Premier League, Germany's Bundesliga and Spain's
Primera Liga decidedly minor. It could kill off some of the smaller
clubs, which would lose attention from media and fans and gate
receipts from its matches against the biggest clubs.
</P>
<P>
   There is probably too much money at stake for it not to happen.
How are these for numbers: revenues of $1.95 billion ... $57.3
million for the champion ... $22.7 million minimum to each
participant (more than Real Madrid got for winning the Champions
Cup last May) ... $1.1 billion TV package?
</P>
<P>
   UEFA, European soccer's governing body, is against the idea it
apparently plans to broaden its Champions League and combine the
Cup Winners Cup and UEFA Cup in response but Hoeness insists it
will happen whether UEFA, and by extension FIFA, approves. That
could lead to a schism in world soccer.
</P>
<P>
   The details: Sixteen teams would be permanent participants with
the remainder of the field filled in qualifying, and the competing
squads would cease playing in their national leagues. Two other
tournaments the ProCup and an unnamed event would replace the Cup
Winners Cup and the UEFA Cup. Among the names of those involved:
former Italian premier Silvio Berlusconi (owner of AC Milan),
Dodgers' owner Rupert Murdoch and German magnate Leo Kirch.
</P>
<P>
   The 16 ``permanent'' teams, according to Italian magazine
Tuttosport (which is owned by the same people who own Juventus):
Juventus, Inter Milan and AC Milan (Italy); Arsenal, Liverpool and
Manchester United (England); Barcelona and Real Madrid (Spain);
Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund (Germany); Paris-St. Germain
and Olympique Marseille (France); Ajax Amsterdam (Netherlands);
Benfica (Portugal); RSC Anderlecht (Belgium); and Panathinaikos
(Greece).
</P>
<P>
   Notes: America's England-based goalkeepers looked good in
Premier League openers over the weekend. Leicester City's Kasey
Keller
</P>
<P>
   shut out host Manchester United for 61 minutes Saturday before
leaving the game with a bruised knee; his teammates squandered a
2-0 loss, surrendering two goals in the final 12 minutes of a 2-2
draw. Liverpool's Brad Friedel
</P>
<P>
   also was victorious, helping the Reds to a 2-1 comeback
victorywin
</P>
<P>
   at Southampton.
</P>
<P>
   The Orange County Zodiac is playoff-bound for the first time
after improving to 15-9 with ALeague wins last weekend over San
Francisco Bay and New Orleans. Coach Mike Gartlan
</P>
<P>
   isn't satisfied. ``It's cool,'' he said after Friday's clinching
victory. ``What do you want me to say? We don't want to just get
in. We want to win it.'' Most likely ALeague champion is MLS
wannabe Rochester, which is 19-3 and has outscored opponentsfoes,
53-11.
</P>
<P>
   Marcelo Bielsa, coach of Spain's Espanyol, confirmed Monday that
he's been offered the Argentina job abandoned by Daniel Passarella.
Bielsa called the offer a ``dream,'' and Espanyol officials hinted
they'd let him out of his contract.
</P>
<P>
   Not a whole lot of competition awaits the U.S. women's team in
U.S. Women's Cup '98, which will be played at four East Coast
venues Sept.12-20. Only South American champion Brazil figures to
give the Americans much of a challenge Russia and Mexico are the
patsies. Four of the six matches will be televised: U.S.-Mexico
(Sept. 13 at noon, ESPN2), Brazil-Russia (Sept. 15 at noon, ESPN),
U.S.-Russia (Sept. 18 at 5 p.m., ESPN) and U.S.-Brazil (Sept. 20 at
noon, ESPN2 and Telemundo).

 &HT;    Chrysler to appeal recall ruling
 &HT;    By Mike Wagner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The Chrysler Corp. will appeal a federal judge's
$800,000 fine for failing to recall more than 90,000 cars that had
faulty rear seat belts.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Emmet G. Sullivan imposed the fine Monday
because Chrysler failed to recall Cirrus and Stratus cars after the
government told the company those vehicle seat belt systems were
unsafe.
</P>
<P>
   The fine is the largest penalty ever imposed on an automaker for
violating safety rules.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Cischke, Chrysler's executive director of vehicle safety,
said Tuesday the No. 3 U.S. automaker is planning to appeal the
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ` `We are essentially being penalized for using the only avenue
available to us _ legal recourse _ and our confidence in getting
relief from unreasonable regulatory actions has been shaken,''
Cischke said. She described Chrysler officials as ``shocked and
disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ricardo Martinez, head of the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration, praised the court's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Manufacturers should respond promptly to safety recalls,''
Martinez said. ``Seat belts are the most important pieces of safety
equipment in motor vehicles and this case was all about seat
belts.''
</P>
<P>
   The government had sought a $1.6 million penalty, $800,000
apiece for failing to obey the NHTSA order to recall the autos in
1996 and failing to notify owners of a recall. But the judge said
the failures were one ``related series of violations,'' and thus
deserved one penalty.
</P>
<P>
   The largest previous such civil fine imposed on an automaker was
$405,457 charged to General Motors Corp. in 1978 for failure to
recall some faulty Quadrajet carburetors prone to fuel leaks that
could cause fires. GM fought the recall and lost in court.
</P>
<P>
   Chrysler in March recalled the 1995 model year Cirrus and Dodge
Stratus autos after losing its court battle with the government.
</P>
<P>
   Chrysler is the only company ever to fight in court a recall
based on a car's failure to meet a safety test standard. NHTSA
wanted Chrysler to recall and fix the vehicles without charge
because the rear seat belt anchoring system failed a federal
strength test.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials were surprised when Chrysler announced in
1996 that it would fight the recall in court. The government's
anchor standard had been in effect for more than 25 years and,
during that time, had been violated 54 times. In every case, until
Chrysler refused, the car company recalled the vehicles to
strengthen the belt anchor.
</P>
<P>
   Chrysler said the anchor system was safe and had never failed in
cars on the road.

<P>
   BOISE, Idaho _ The Albertson Foundation, a $1 billion family-run
charitable trust, has announced a three-year pledge to award $110
million in grants to public schools in Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   While not the largest gift to public education, it would be the
largest commitment on a per-school basis, at $176,000 a school, if
spread over the 626 public schools in Idaho. In that respect, the
grants even top the Annenberg Foundation pledge of $500 million,
made in 1993; a typical grant to a school from that pledge is about
$50,000.
</P>
<P>
   Grants for four new programs in Idaho are beginning to filter
into public schools this summer, including about $80 million for
computer and software investments promised over the next three
years.
</P>
<P>
   The Albertson Foundation, based in Boise, emerged on the scene
unexpectedly last year, when Kathryn Albertson, the widow of the
grocery entrepreneur Joe Albertson, donated $660 million in company
stock to her husband's foundation. The gift made it one of the
Northwest's wealthiest foundations and among the nation's top 35.
Albertson, who built a grocery chain with stores in 21 states,
opened his first Albertson's store here in the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   Loren Renz, vice president of research at the New York-based
Foundation Center, a policy and research organization, said it is
unusual for a foundation to put its resources in one state and in
K-12 public education.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not many of them that large spend all of their money in one
state,'' Ms. Renz said. ``But it's a great benefit to the state
because you really know your grantees.''
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, 42 percent of private foundations focus on higher
education, compared to 27 percent for K-12 education, Ms. Renz
said. But since national attention in recent years has been focused
on the shortcomings of public schools, the number of gifts to
primary and secondary education is increasing, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Idaho's public schoolchildren fall roughly in the middle of all
students in terms of test scores, although the state is among the
bottom 10 in per-pupil spending, at $4,500 per student, and in
student-teacher ratios, with 18.8 students per teacher. In
addition, crumbling primary and secondary schools face a $700
million backlog in maintenance and repairs.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Mel Richardson, a Republican from Idaho Falls who is
on the budget committee that allocates funds for school computers,
said the Albertson gift provides a geometric leap in financing.
Until now, the Idaho Legislature has spent only about $10 million a
year on computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty-eight million is going to be spent immediately on
computer hardware and software,'' Richardson said. ``That means
we'll have a computer for every teacher in the state, and more
computers and software for students.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he does not want the foundation money to replace state
financing. ``The big battle is going to be to keep the funding
coming from the Legislature,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Split among 112 districts, the money for computers amounts to
$250,000 a district. To qualify, districts must have a technology
plan, which already is required by the Idaho Board of Education in
order to qualify for state money.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest grant that's
been given for technology in one state for education,'' said Rich
Mincer, bureau chief of technology services for the Idaho
Department of Education.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Three other new programs being financed by the foundation are:
education of preschoolers ($3.8 million), reading in the lower
grades ($24.5 million) and professional development for teachers
($2 million).
</P>
<P>
   The foundation is making it possible for 140 teachers to take a
rigorous training program offered through the National Board of
Professional Teaching Standards. Nationwide, only 914 teachers have
been certified under the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``The course made us look very critically at how we were
teaching, and whether we were getting through to our students,''
said Shanon Blosch, a third-grade teacher in Arco, Idaho. ``I never
could have taken the course without the Albertson's money. Now I'm
really excited for next year.''

   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, Aug. 19:
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. president is a person who sometimes must ask people in
the ranks to die for the country. The president is a person who
asks people close around him to serve the government for less money
than their talents would bring elsewhere. The president sometimes
requires that people out in the country sacrifice their dollars or
their convenience for national goals. All he is asked to provide in
return is trustworthiness, loyalty and judgment. These concentric
circles of the national family simply want the president to have
enough character not to abuse their devotion.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has failed that simple test abjectly, not
merely with undignified private behavior in a revered place, but
with his cavalier response to public concern. That is why the
cursory speech he made before departing on vacation probably did
him more harm than good. That is also why there is a tidal feeling
of betrayal and embarrassment running across the country today,
from the grass roots to the White House staff. All day Tuesday the
speech was panned on editorial pages and by talk-show callers in
states that Clinton carried. Rather than rallying to him, many
congressional Democrats were openly critical or sour and silent.
Although polls just after the speech looked all right, his Gallup
personal approval rating, which stood at 60 percent two weeks ago,
hit 40 percent Tuesday. The same poll found that 58 percent thought
Clinton should have made an outright apology.
</P>
<P>
   It was, instead, a speech that left no one happy, except perhaps
for that infallibly amusing ranter James Carville. Apology, the
essential word for such remarks, was missing entirely, as well as
any hint of awareness of the inexcusable carelessness with which
Clinton has treated people.
</P>
<P>
   Let us stipulate that lying to his family and evading questions
before the grand jury should be dealt with in other venues, and
consider only the violations of the contract of presidential
obligation. Expressing regret for creating a ``false impression''
is not an adequate response when he lied to the American people for
seven months. He lied to members of Congress in the Roosevelt Room.
He has sent federal employees out to lie on his behalf, dispatching
them like personal rather than public servants to argue
passionately a position he knew to be false.
</P>
<P>
   It is, perhaps, not surprising. Judgment and a sense of moral
proportion have always been missing elements in this
administration. Presidential incorrigibility puts a heavy burden on
the legislative and judicial branches to chart the country's course
through a political storm. We know now that Clinton has spoken
falsely on the lesser matter of his sex life and refused a full
public accounting on the portentous matter, obstruction of justice,
that will shape the future of his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   By this time, Kenneth Starr has a clear idea of whether he
thinks Clinton could be indicted. The time until he puts his report
on this key issue into the hands of Congress must, for the good of
the country, be measured in days or weeks, not months.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's handling of the office entrusted him has embarrassed
the nation. It is likely to remain a mystery locked inside a
personality that even he may not fully understand.
</P>
<P>
   Many have spoken of his story as having the shape of
Shakespearean tragedy. We are more reminded of a passage in W.H.
Auden's poem ``The Quest,'' about an expedition that had spent
months gathering equipment and laying plans to conquer expected
obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   ``In theory they were sound on Expectation,
</P>
<P>
   Had there been situations to be in;
</P>
<P>
   Unluckily they were their situation.''
</P>
<P>
   With his refusal to give an apology and explanation that were
presidential in scale, Clinton showed that his personality is his
situation. Given the fact that he is supposed to serve until Jan.
20, 2001, he is our situation as well.

FROM ART SOCIETY TO TIMES SQUARE, ELBOWS BARE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was probably inevitable that the man who invented
those lurid chartreuse stickers cemented to certain car windows
around town _ ``This vehicle violates NYC parking regulations!'' _
would not last forever as president of the Municipal Art Society.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that Brendan Sexton has no sense of esthetic decorum;
in fact, most preservationists agree that he has helped improve the
city's physical landscape in the three years that he has led the
art society. But ultimately, Sexton is an operations man, as they
say at City Hall, the kind of guy who likes to get his fingernails
dirty planning sanitation routes and figuring out traffic patterns
and engaging in the delivery of city services in a way not usually
practiced in the more rarefied world of the urban-design
association.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why many of his friends believe his next job as
president of the Times Square Business Improvement District will be
such a snug fit. Running one of these districts means supplying
basic services the city has neither the money nor the will to
provide, along with cheerleading and long-term planning. As Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani has recently come to realize, it's a bit like
being mayor of one of the city's best-known, most prosperous
neighborhoods, with $6 million in tax money to play with and no
daily news conferences.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a perfect match for Brendan,'' said Stanley Brezenoff,
who as a deputy mayor in the administration of Mayor Ed Koch was
Sexton's boss. ``When he was running the city's Office of
Operations, he reveled in figuring out how to make the agencies
work better, coming up with milestones and benchmarks for
sanitation and public safety and the general quality of life. He
likes digging into problems up to his elbows.''
</P>
<P>
   At just under five-and-a-half feet tall, Sexton, 53, is a feisty
and talkative man whose elbows are usually exposed by rolled-up
sleeves. He is careful not to denigrate the job he is leaving,
pointing out that the society played a major role in the design of
the structure that is to replace the Coliseum at Columbus Circle,
as well as the new Hudson River Park. But his role at the arts
society was primarily that of a negotiator and lobbyist, testifying
at hearings, writing beseeching letters to public officials, and
speaking with newspaper reporters. When he talks about his next
job, one can almost hear his heart pounding.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've seen in Times Square in the last several years is
what I think New York's next century will be very largely based
on,'' he said, sitting in the society's crisp midtown offices in
the Villard Houses, on Madison Avenue near East 50th Street.
``Times Square is the place where New York is both encouraging and
experimenting with the density of the future, the combination of
residents and visitors that makes this the global capital of world.
You get paid to be excited, to foster excitement, to make
excitement friendly and safe. The fact that I got this chance is
sort of amazing to me.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Sexton said he wasn't looking for a new job but had expressed
interest after a search firm called him, looking for a replacement
for Gretchen Dykstra, who is leaving after six years to move to San
Francisco. During Ms. Dykstra's tenure, the neighborhood scraped
off its grime and ousted its shabby restaurants and movie theaters
to become the city's new real estate playground, an overheated
greenhouse for developers, publishers and entertainment companies
thriving in the city's end-of-century exuberance.
</P>
<P>
   But both Sexton and Ms. Dykstra insist that the hard work is far
from over. The district's problems now involve managing its
success: finding sidewalk space for boisterous crowds that often
spill over the curb, planning for the day when economic growth
begins pressuring Eighth Avenue and Hell's Kitchen, getting ready
for the unimaginably large celebration of the new millennium that
will occur exactly 500 days from Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Sexton says he wants the district to grow without losing the
``little things that make you happy to be there,'' like the Colony
Record store or the musical instrument dealers on 48th Street.
</P>
<P>
   He will also have to accommodate the looming presence of
Giuliani, who recently shut down another improvement district after
its director was insufficiently deferential. But that should not be
an enormous problem for Sexton, who long ago learned to deal with a
mayor-sized ego when he worked in several posts for Koch.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the substantial salary that comes with the job, Sexton's
getting worried about convincing his children (there are seven,
including three from his wife's previous marriage) that he still
works for a living.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if the person in this job is more of a ringmaster
or a maitre d' at a really super party,'' he said. ``It's hard to
justify yourself to your kids when you tell them your job is to
make New York as much fun as possible.'' &QL;

TV NOTES: HOWARD STERN, SAVIOR;   RATHER LOBBIES FOR JOB; BEST WEEK
FOR CABLE;   'TOONS FROM ABROAD 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By LAWRIE MIFFLIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Declaring ``I am the savior of the Tiffany network'' and ``I'm
Ed Sullivan on acid,'' Howard Stern used about an hour of his
morning radio talk show Tuesday to promote his new late-night
television show, which starts on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Stern, who has made his reputation by taking vulgarity to new
levels on the radio and on the E! Entertainment cable network, also
said, ``It's very brave of CBS to put me on,'' and ``it could be
suicide.''
</P>
<P>
   But, despite his repeated references, the CBS network is not
putting Stern on the air. His show is syndicated _ meaning sold by
a production company to individual stations around the country _
and in most cities where it will appear, the show will not be on a
CBS-affiliated station.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the 14 stations that CBS owns, one in Salt Lake City, the
other in Green Bay, Wis., refused to broadcast the show, which is
being syndicated by Eyemark Entertainment, a CBS-owned company; the
other 12, including Channel 2 in New York City, will carry it.
Eyemark has sold it to stations covering more than 70 percent of
the country, including stations affiliated with Fox, WB, UPN and
ABC.
</P>
<P>
   Called ``The Howard Stern Radio Show,'' the television show will
combine recycled segments from his daily radio show, which is
already videotaped for use on his six-nights-a-week half-hour
E!-channel show, and new segments, including some animation.
``We're going to take some radio bits we've done in the past and
animate them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   What he will not do, Stern said emphatically, is sketch comedy _
a staple of NBC's ``Saturday Night Live,'' against which Stern's
show will compete in most cities, appearing at 11:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't do sketches about lesbians _ we haul in real
lesbians,'' Stern said. ```Saturday Night Live' sketches go on too
long and they're never funny.''
</P>
<P>
   Stern also called David Letterman, CBS' weeknight late-night
star, ``a crybaby,'' and Walter Cronkite, its retired news anchor,
``boring.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Walter Cronkite is calling Dr. Kevorkian and making an
appointment right now,'' Stern crowed. ``He hates me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the most valuable jewel in the Tiffany network.''
</P>
<P>
   Turn Back the Clock?
</P>
<P>
   Dan Rather, who was a ``60 Minutes'' correspondent from 1976 to
1981, wants to reprise that role for the second edition of the
venerable CBS news magazine, due early next year and informally
known inside CBS News as ``60 II.''
</P>
<P>
   Although such a move would make sense _ the executive producer
for ``60 Minutes II,'' Jeff Fager, was most recently executive
producer of ``CBS Evening News,'' anchored by Rather, and the new
program could benefit from the addition of such a well-known news
name _ it would also present daunting difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   Pieces reported for ``60 Minutes'' take considerable time, and
Rather's schedule is already overbooked. In addition to the
``Evening News,'' he also anchors ``48 Hours,'' the network's other
news magazine program, and he writes a syndicated newspaper column
and does commentary for CBS radio.
</P>
<P>
   And ``48 Hours,'' after struggling in the Nielsen ratings for
some years, made a strong comeback this past season _ a season in
which Rather devoted more time to it.
</P>
<P>
   Executives who work in the news division said that Rather would
like to have a prominent role on ``60 II,'' and that Fager and Don
Hewitt, the executive producer of ``60 Minutes'' who will supervise
``60 II,'' would like to have him. That makes the odds pretty good,
the executives said, that something will be worked out.
</P>
<P>
   Hot Wired
</P>
<P>
   Cable-network competition got pretty heated Sunday night, with
the Discovery Channel showing a live telecast of explorers roaming
the ruins of the Titanic deep under the North Atlantic ocean, TBS
opportunistically showing the romantic comedy ``The American
President,'' the all-news channels carrying programs about
President Clinton's scheduled grand jury testimony and the new Fox
Family Channel in the midst of its much-publicized weekend debut.
</P>
<P>
   All helped give basic cable its best week ever in the Nielsen
ratings, with an average prime-time share of 47, meaning of all
American households using television last week, an average of 47
percent were tuned to a basic cable channel in prime time. The six
broadcast networks combined had a 44 share in prime time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Titanic Live,'' a two-hour special, gave the Discovery Channel
its second-highest Nielsen rating ever, a 4.1, which means slightly
more than 3 million households. Fascination with the doomed Titanic
seems perennial; the only Discovery show to score a higher rating
was ``Anatomy of a Disaster,'' also about the Titanic, which got a
4.5 rating in April of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   On TBS, ``The American President'' had 4.96 million households
tuned in, for a 6.6 rating that was the highest ever for a
theatrical movie on basic cable. (And it drew another 3 million
homes for a second showing at 10:30 p.m.)
</P>
<P>
   On the new Fox Family Channel, formerly just the Family Channel,
a concert by the Spice Girls got a 1.8 rating, which, considering
the competition, pleased the network's president, Rich Cronin. He
was happier, though, about Saturday night, when Fox Family showed
the movie ``Mrs. Doubtfire'' and drew 2.4 million homes, tied for
13th on the list of most-watched shows in cable last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're thrilled,'' Cronin said Tuesday. ``We didn't know what
to expect. We knew our competitors would put good stuff up against
us, but we didn't see the whole thing with President Clinton coming
up.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said the network had doubled its rating on Saturday
among 18-to-49-year-olds and had tripled its audience of children
under 12, in relation to its third-quarter average so far, and to
the same date last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a while to build an audience but this was a great
start,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Nose Knows
</P>
<P>
   Ever wonder if the people who make cartoons are as crazy in
other parts of the world as they seem to be here? Nickelodeon, the
cable network for children, has some stake in finding out. And on
Saturday, Nickelodeon viewers can get some idea, too, when the
network shows a half-hour special featuring 10 animated shorts,
eight from Nickelodeon channels outside the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The special, ``Toons From Planet Orange'' (Saturday, 12 noon
Eastern time), includes four cartoons from Australia, two from
Latin America, one from Britain and one from Germany.
</P>
<P>
   As for themes, two of the cartoons feature maniacal plants (a
cactus and a zucchini), one stars three Martians, seven have animal
or insect stars (ranging from ants to toads) and two feature nasal
excretions. One Australian cartoon features a superhero piece of
nasal material who lives in the Sphinx's nose in Egypt; the German
entry, ``Helmut and the Killer Nose,'' has a main character that
annihilates whole cities with its excretions.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows what Nickelodeon fans will fancy?

MINORITY STUDENTS SCORING HIGHER ON ACT TESTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By WILLIAM H. HONAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   More minority students took the ACT college entrance examination
this year, and improved their scores slightly in the process,
according to data released Tuesday by ACT. Incorporated, one of the
two major nonprofit organizations that offer college entrance
tests.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley Hayden, a spokesman for the organization, said the that
number of students who placed themselves in a racial or ethnic
minority grew this year by 18,188m, or 8.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The national average score, a composite of tests in English,
mathematics, reading and science reasoning, remained constant at 21
out of a possible 36 points this year.
</P>
<P>
   But while most minority groups remain below that average, scores
continue to improve slightly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Minority students are increasingly thinking of themselves as
college material and are taking more college preparation courses in
high school,'' Hayden said.
</P>
<P>
   Over a five-year period, the average scores of American Indians
has risen to 19 from 18.5. African-American scores went up to 17.1
from 17. The scores of Asian-Americans rose to 21.8 from 21.7.
</P>
<P>
   The scores of Hispanic students could not be compared to past
years, Hayden said, because the categories defining ethnic
backgrounds changed this year.
</P>
<P>
   In another trend suggested by this year's tests, said Richard L.
Ferguson, the president of ACT, many students' career aspirations
seemed out of step with the job market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Large numbers are interested in entering crowded fields where
the available openings may decrease in the coming years,'' Ferguson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Students are asked to check off on accompanying questionaires
the careers they hope to pursue. A comparison to Labor Department
projections indicate that the top three occupations expected to
grow most rapidly between now and 2006 are all computer-related.
Yet relatively few students (3 percent) checked off computing and
information science.
</P>
<P>
   Students' first choice of career was health sciences (20
percent), followed by business and management (11.3 percent) and
education (9.6 percent).
</P>
<P>
   The test was taken by 60 percent of all high school seniors, or
just under a million, about 100,000 fewer than those who took the
SAT. The ACT test is more popular in central United States while
the SAT is the dominant test on both coasts.

GUILTY PLEA REPORTED IN SMUGGLING OF CHINESE INTO N.J. 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAVID W. CHEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ Intensifying their investigation of the smuggling
of Chinese immigrants into the United States, a federal prosecutor
said Tuesday that one of the crew members of a smuggling ship that
ran aground in New Jersey had pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges
and another was expected to plead guilty later this week.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the prosecutor, Carolyn Murray, an assistant
U.S. attorney in New Jersey, said that the 23 Chinese immigrants
who arrived aboard that smuggling ship and have since been detained
by the authorities as witnesses in the federal investigation would
probably be released on bond soon. Beginning next week, the federal
government plans to take depositions from some of the 23 in a
process that should take several weeks, and at its conclusion, will
allow the immigrants to be released.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole purpose of the depositions is to keep the amount of
time they spend in custody as witnesses to a minimum,'' Ms. Murray
said after a calendar conference with defense lawyers before Judge
Dickinson Debevoise in U.S. District Court here. So far, the
illegal immigrants have been detained for more than two months.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's proceeding was not a formal hearing; it was more a
matter of legal necessity to coordinate schedules and logistics as
the summer winds down. Even so, the conference hinted at how the
government is proceeding with its investigation into the smuggling
of illegal immigrants, and what lies ahead for the principal
players involved.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government is investigating the events surrounding
the evening of May 30, when a power boat carrying the illegal
immigrants ran aground in a soupy fog in the affluent town of Bay
Head, N.J., some eight miles north of the intended destination,
Belmar, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   The case attracted additional attention, no doubt, because of
its parallels with the case of Golden Venture, a larger ship that
was carrying 286 illegal Chinese immigrants when it sputtered to a
halt in Queens in 1993. There was cruel coincidence, too: The name
of the powerboat in this case was the Oops II.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the federal government indicted six men in a
conspiracy to smuggle the 23 Chinese men into the United States.
The six were accused of participating in an international smuggling
operation that solicited as much as $40,000 apiece from anyone
interested in being taken from Fujian province in southern China
via South America to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Five of the six are being held without bail in New Jersey jails;
the other, Charng Seon Choi, is still at large. One man facing
smuggling charges, Kim Jong Che, has said that he was born in Korea
but lives in Venezuela, while the backgrounds and residences of the
other defendants remain unclear.
</P>
<P>
   But last week, another of the six, Cho Yang Nam, pleaded guilty
to one conspiracy charge, acknowledging that he plotted with
unnamed others to smuggle the Chinese immigrants, according to
court documents. He has since agreed to cooperate with
investigators, which could pare his sentence from its maximum of 10
years in jail and a $250,000 fine, the documents show.
</P>
<P>
   Cho's guilty plea was not disclosed until Tuesday, however,
because of case strategy, Ms. Murray said. Another man accused of
smuggling, Nam Jick Cho of Bayside, Queens, may plead guilty this
week, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither of the Chos _ who prosecutors say are not believed to be
related _ appeared in court Tuesday. But the other three accused
men in custody _ Che, Piao Zhen Jia and Jiang Yong Zhu _ did show
up in the courtroom, looking stone-faced while listening to a
translator. The trial is scheduled to being on Nov. 17.
</P>
<P>
   As for the illegal immigrants, they were first held in an
Immigration and Naturalization Service detention center in
Elizabeth, N.J. Most were released in mid-July on bond by two
immigration judges, only to be immediately rearrested by federal
authorities as witnesses in the federal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the 23 men remain in government custody, most in the
Passaic County Jail. But some of the men briefly escaped the
loneliness of being imprisoned in a foreign land when they were
reunited last month with several relatives who appeared in
immigration court in Elizabeth to offer testimony to support the
men's release on bond.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the prospect of reunions lasting more than a few minutes,
and occurring outside of a courtroom, looms larger. Within a week
or so, federal prosecutors are expected to whittle the list of 23
to about 10 or so men from whom they plan to take videotaped
depositions.
</P>
<P>
   Those who are not deposed presumably will be released
immediately; those who are formally questioned will be released
after their depositions, assuming no further legal complications,
Ms. Murray said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the men still face deportation hearings by the INS.
But most have filed for political asylum.

OTTO WICHTERLE, INVENTOR OF THE SOFT CONTACT LENS, DIES AT 84 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MICHAEL T. KAUFMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Otto Wichterle, a Czechoslovak chemist who in 1961 used an
Erector set and a phonograph to produce the world's first soft
contact lenses, died Tuesday at his summer home in Sdradisko, a
Moravian village in the Czech Republic. Wichterle, a former
president of that nation's Academy of Sciences, was 84 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Wichterle died in his sleep after having suffered a heart attack
and a stroke within the last year, according to his grandson, Hynek
Wichterle, a doctoral candidate in neurobiology at Rockefeller
University.
</P>
<P>
   The consequences of Wichterle's kitchen-table experimentation
changed the way millions of people see and look. ``Before his
discovery, there were, of course, contact lenses,'' said Dr. Dwight
Cavanaugh, a professor of ophthalmology at the University of Texas
Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas. ``But they were made of
glass or hard plastic. They were difficult to make and to fit and
probably no more than 10,000 or 20,000 were being used. As a result
of what Dr. Wichterle achieved, a billion-dollar industry came into
being; today there are about 30 million people in the United States
and 100 million people around the world who use soft lenses.''
</P>
<P>
   As explained by his grandson, the discovery came about in a
difficult period for his grandfather. Until 1958, Wichterle had
been the dean of the Institute for Chemical Technology in Prague,
having acquired dozens of patents for various polymer materials,
among them Silon, a substance similar to nylon that he developed in
the late 1940s. But in that year Communist Party officials
dismissed him from his position, calling him politically
unreliable.
</P>
<P>
   About this time he discovered a polymer called HEMA, or hydrogel
poly-hydroxyethyl methacrylate, which was a hydrophilic, or
water-loving, plastic able to retain moisture. Wichterle, who had
long had an interest in finding materials that could be adaptable
to the body, realized that HEMA might be used to form a corrective
lens.
</P>
<P>
   With his wife, Lidia, who was trained as a doctor, he used his
newly found leisure to experiment with ways of forging the material
into soft and pliable lenses. Using the motor of an old phonograph
and a child's Erector set, he was able to discover the spin-casting
process, which forms the basis of soft lens manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
   Despite initiating the growth of a multibillion-dollar soft lens
industry, Wichterle never became very wealthy from his invention.
He patented both the material and the process in 1963. In 1960, he
published the results of his experiments in the journal Nature,
arousing interest among entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   Robert J. Morrison, an optometrist in Harrisburg, Pa., went to
Czechoslovakia and bought the patent rights to the material and the
process from the Czechoslovak government for what was reputed to be
$330,000. He ultimately sold those rights to the National Patent
Development Corp. of New York, which subsequently sold them to
Bausch &AMP; Lomb.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, many new patents have been obtained modifying both
the original material and the spin-casting process. According to
the inventor's grandson, Wichterle received no more than one-tenth
of one percent of what the Czechoslovak government had been paid
for his patent rights. He said his grandfather never complained
about this.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was never primarily interested in the money and he never
regretted not making more from his invention,'' Hynek Wichterle
said. ``He led a comfortable life and he enjoyed traveling and
visiting scientists and scholars in many parts of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Otto Wichterle was born in 1913, the son of an owner of a
factory that produced farm machinery. By the time he was in
elementary school, the Austro-Hungarian empire had collapsed and
the family members found themselves citizens of the new state of
Czechoslovakia.
</P>
<P>
   Fascinated by chemistry from an early age, he completed his
education at the Institute of Technology in Prague, where he
received his doctorate.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before Germany seized Czechoslovakia in the prelude to
World War II, Wichterle was hired by the Bata shoe company's
owners, who were pioneers in benevolent management and introduced
what would today be called research and development.
</P>
<P>
   Wichterle was hired to set up an independent polymer laboratory
in Zilin, the company's model town, where his discoveries might or
might not be used for shoes. It was there that he came up with
Silon, which was used to make socks and shirts in postwar
Czechoslovakia.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, he taught at the Institute of Chemical Technology
until his dismissal. Then after his invention of the soft lens
technology, as the political atmosphere grew somewhat more liberal,
Wichterle was permitted to establish and direct another laboratory,
the Institute of Macro-Molecular Chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   He was in this post when the Prague Spring, the short-lived
period of liberalization, flourished in Czechoslovakia in 1968. He
was one of the co-authors and circulators of a document called
``2,000 Words,'' which argued that strategies calling for a human
face on communism did not go far enough.
</P>
<P>
   When the arrival of Russian troops and tanks put an end even to
timid experimentation. Wichterle was dismissed as director of his
laboratory. But when Communist rule collapsed in 1989, Wichterle
was quickly elected to head the Czechoslovak Academy of Science.
When the country split in 1992, he became the first president of
the Academy of the Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, he is survived by two sons, Karil and
Ivan. &QL;

EDITORIAL: NORTH KOREA'S NUCLEAR AMBITIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, Aug. 19:
</P>
<P>
   North Korea seems to have been caught preparing to betray its
1994 commitment to trade in its nuclear weapons ambitions for $6
billion in international assistance. U.S. intelligence agencies
have detected construction of an elaborate underground nuclear
complex. If completed, the nuclear reactor and plutonium
reprocessing plant expected to be built there could allow the North
to produce as many as half a dozen nuclear bombs two to five years
from now.
</P>
<P>
   Washington must insist that work on this project be halted
immediately. If North Korea wants economic cooperation from the
United States it must honor its promise to renounce all nuclear
weapons activity.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea has not yet violated the letter of its 1994 nuclear
agreement with the United States. Reprocessing of spent nuclear
fuel from the North's existing, above-ground reactors into bomb
plutonium remains suspended. Construction work has not yet begun on
either the new reactor or new reprocessing plant. That means the
nuclear cooperation deal can be preserved, provided North Korea
stops work on the new site.
</P>
<P>
   The 1994 deal provided for North Korea to freeze all work on
suspect nuclear programs. In exchange a group of countries, led by
the United States and South Korea, agreed to provide fuel oil and
to build two replacement power reactors whose spent fuel cannot
easily be converted into bombs. Washington has fallen badly behind
on fuel oil deliveries, with less than half the annual amount due
by October so far delivered.
</P>
<P>
   The North has complained about this shortfall, and it is
conceivable that its recent construction work is intended to
pressure America into speedier oil deliveries. If so, it is a badly
misconceived tactic sure to stiffen Congressional resistance to
paying for more fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Later this week, Washington's special envoy for Korean nuclear
issues, Charles Kartman, will meet North Korean officials in New
York. Halting the newly discovered construction work will rightly
be high on his agenda. Beyond that, the Clinton administration
needs to proceed firmly but carefully, closely coordinating its
diplomacy with South Korea, whose new government remains committed
to expanding economic cooperation with the North.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea is a dangerous, unpredictable country. A breakdown
of the nuclear cooperation agreement would heighten tensions on the
peninsula, where 37,000 U.S. troops still stand guard. Washington
should make every reasonable effort to keep the nuclear deal alive.
But the agreement clearly cannot survive if North Korea still
imagines itself becoming a nuclear power.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ They were plied with platters of hot kebabs and
glasses of Johnnie Walker and served platitudes about the
prosperity of Indian immigrants in the United States. Then, the
doctors, diamond merchants and sundry other deep-pocketed
Indian-Americans who filled a room at the midtown Manhattan
restaurant Shaan the other night were delivered a remarkably simple
pitch: Make money. Help the motherland.
</P>
<P>
   For the last couple of weeks, in an effort to raise at least $2
billion through a government-guaranteed bond offering, officials of
the State Bank of India have been making similar offers all over
Indian New York.
</P>
<P>
   They have invited small clutches of Indian-American doctors to
the bank's Park Avenue offices. They have blitzed the local Indian
media with advertisements (``You don't need to be a financial
wizard,'' says one such ad. ``You need to be an Indian.'') and set
up booths at shopping strips and at last Sunday's India Day Parade.
They have even assembled local Indian-American movers and shakers
under the watchful eyes of the gods at one of the largest Hindu
temples in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   The Indian government has been trying for several years to raise
foreign investment from its expatriates _ Non-Resident Indians,
they are called, or less flatteringly in India, Never-Returning
Indians. The latest effort, however, is its most ambitious.
</P>
<P>
   As Western aid begins to shrink in the aftermath of New Delhi's
recent nuclear escapades, the Resurgent India Bonds, as they have
been dubbed, represent an effort by India's Hindu nationalist
government to compensate by turning to the expatriates among whom
it has long enjoyed considerable support.
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, the government is hoping to cash in on the
patriotic fervor among its departed native sons and daughters _
sentiments that, for many, have only been intensified by the
underground nuclear tests in May. But the investment plan it has
created does not count on patriotism alone.
</P>
<P>
   Offered only to overseas Indians, the Resurgent India Bonds
carry handsome returns and are guaranteed by the government of
India. They illustrate perfectly how the ties between immigrants
and their homeland are exploited for mutual economic gains _ and
how easily immigrant dollars that could be invested in this country
are whisked away.
</P>
<P>
   At the recent dinner meeting at Shaan, N.K. Puri, a senior State
Bank of India official who had flown in from Bombay, put it this
way: ``People who have prospered here,'' he declared from the
podium. ``We should try to help the country come up.''
</P>
<P>
   The audience responded with hearty applause. But in the back of
the banquet room, a prominent New York City doctor, who spoke on
the condition of anonymity, smiled knowingly. No amount of
patriotic fervor, he said, could compete with the profitability of
these five-year bonds. Their tax benefits are attractive, as is
their 7.75 percent interest rate, 2 percentage points higher than
comparable U.S. Treasury bonds. The doctor said he had invested
what he called a small amount even though he does not support the
nuclear test blasts; he called the tests ``the dumbest thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm Indian, I have all good wishes for India,'' he confided.
``But I'm only doing it because it makes sense to me. They knew
nobody would do this if it didn't make economic sense.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, this transaction resembles the remittances that
immigrants from all over the world send to their families back
home, often just a few dollars a week saved from their pay. The
Resurgent India Bond offering, however, is a shrewd effort by the
Indian government to tap into the wealthiest corners of its
diaspora. Investors must buy a minimum of $2,000; the average
purchase at the State Bank of India's New York City branch is about
$20,000.
</P>
<P>
   The bank did not exactly help its cause when it failed to make
application forms available at its New York City branches during
the first few days of the offering, which opened Aug. 5. Even so,
it succeeded in persuading Indians worldwide to kick in $2 billion
in less than two weeks. Now, the bank is hoping for $3 billion by
the time the offering ends next Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of the Resurgent India Bonds emerged shortly after the
government led by the Bharatiya Janata Party, or the BJP, detonated
five underground nuclear bombs in a northern desert of Pokhran in
May. With the tests, India proclaimed itself a nuclear nation. It
also drew a heap of condemnation and economic sanctions from the
United States and several other Western countries.
</P>
<P>
   By no means did the blasts enjoy universal support among Indians
in this country. Opponents demonstrated against nuclear buildup on
the subcontinent and published protest advertisements in the
Indian-American press. Supporters lobbied members of the U.S.
Congress and pledged to help the homeland.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the blasts at Pokhran seemed to offer a peculiar sense
of vindication to some. A few days after the explosions, Arish
Sahani, a Queens insurance salesman and a member of a group called
the Overseas Friends of the BJP, said the testing had ``boosted the
morale of some of the Indians, which has been very low.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes us feel very good.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials in New Delhi rallied citizens at home with patriotic
music videos and turned, with arms outstretched across the oceans,
to its sons and daughters abroad. A month after the blasts, a
senior Indian government official attended a dinner meeting
sponsored by the Overseas Friends of the BJP. The official, Jaswant
Singh, urged Indian-Americans to ``stand up for India at this
critical hour.'' Even a small ``symbolic'' financial contribution,
Singh, the deputy chairman of India's planning commission, told
them, would go a long way.
</P>
<P>
   Early this month, just one day before the world marked the
anniversary of the 1945 bombing of Hiroshima, the Resurgent India
Bonds went on sale. At the end of their five-year terms, they can
be recouped entirely in dollars; bonds are also available in
British pounds and German marks. The bonds can be purchased at
local branches of the State Bank of India as well as at Citibank
branches that offer Non-Resident Indian services. Government
officials say the proceeds are to be used for the construction of
roads, telephone lines and other infrastructure projects in India.
</P>
<P>
   The bank has not secured the Securities and Exchange
Commission's approval for the sale. Bank officials say they are not
required to, and they have not registered the offering with the
agency in Washington. Paul Dudek, the chief of the agency's office
of international corporate finance, declined to comment on whether
the SEC would crack down on the bank, but described an offering of
this magnitude as ``rare.''

   The bank did not exactly help its cause when it failed to make
application forms available at its New York City branches during
the first few days of the offering, which opened Aug. 5. Even so,
it succeeded in persuading Indians worldwide to kick in $2 billion
in less than two weeks. Now, the bank is hoping for $3 billion by
the time the offering ends next Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of the Resurgent India Bonds emerged shortly after the
government led by the Bharatiya Janata Party, or the BJP, detonated
five underground nuclear bombs in a northern desert of Pokhran in
May. With the tests, India proclaimed itself a nuclear nation. It
also drew a heap of condemnation and economic sanctions from the
United States and several other Western countries.
</P>
<P>
   By no means did the blasts enjoy universal support among Indians
in this country. Opponents demonstrated against nuclear buildup on
the subcontinent and published protest advertisements in the
Indian-American press. Supporters lobbied members of the U.S.
Congress and pledged to help the homeland.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the blasts at Pokhran seemed to offer a peculiar sense
of vindication to some. A few days after the explosions, Arish
Sahani, a Queens insurance salesman and a member of a group called
the Overseas Friends of the BJP, said the testing had ``boosted the
morale of some of the Indians, which has been very low.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes us feel very good.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials in New Delhi rallied citizens at home with patriotic
music videos and turned, with arms outstretched across the oceans,
to its sons and daughters abroad. A month after the blasts, a
senior Indian government official attended a dinner meeting
sponsored by the Overseas Friends of the BJP. The official, Jaswant
Singh, urged Indian-Americans to ``stand up for India at this
critical hour.'' Even a small ``symbolic'' financial contribution,
Singh, the deputy chairman of India's planning commission, told
them, would go a long way.
</P>
<P>
   Early this month, just one day before the world marked the
anniversary of the 1945 bombing of Hiroshima, the Resurgent India
Bonds went on sale. At the end of their five-year terms, they can
be recouped entirely in dollars; bonds are also available in
British pounds and German marks. The bonds can be purchased at
local branches of the State Bank of India as well as at Citibank
branches that offer Non-Resident Indian services. Government
officials say the proceeds are to be used for the construction of
roads, telephone lines and other infrastructure projects in India.
</P>
<P>
   The bank has not secured the Securities and Exchange
Commission's approval for the sale. Bank officials say they are not
required to, and they have not registered the offering with the
agency in Washington. Paul Dudek, the chief of the agency's office
of international corporate finance, declined to comment on whether
the SEC would crack down on the bank, but described an offering of
this magnitude as ``rare.''

MARTINEZ HELPS RED SOX SWEEP RANGERS 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES

<P>
   Pedro Martinez restored pace, passion, and purpose to the Red
Sox' pursuit of a wild card Tuesday afternoon. Mo Vaughn added some
late-night percussion, leading to a doubleheader sweep of the Texas
Rangers at Fenway Park that brought the Red Sox closer to those
playoff dates written in red on Jimy Williams's wall calendar.
</P>
<P>
   After Martinez won his 16th game, beating the Rangers, 4-1, in a
matinee played with a swiftness and sureness missing throughout
this languid homestand, Vaughn won the nightcap, 5-4, with a
tie-breaking home run that split sheets of rain and a stiff breeze
before settling into the screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pedro started it off early for us today, got us in the flow,''
said Vaughn, ``and these were big games, no doubt about it. We're
shooting for something and right in the thick of things, and it was
important to get these two. We knew going head to head against
these guys, we had to play well.''
</P>
<P>
   With 13 pitches, Tom Gordon saved both ends of the sweep, which
gave the Red Sox a 5-3 record for the homestand as they head to
Kansas City and Minnesota for a quick five-game swing.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn hit a 422-foot home run off reliever Danny Patterson to
lead off the seventh after the Red Sox fought back from a 4-2
deficit the inning before. It was Vaughn's 33d of the season, his
seventh against Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most teams have a Mo,'' said Rangers manager Johnny Oates,
whose team dropped eight games behind the Sox in the wild-card race
while the Orioles, 7-1 winners over the Twins, are seven back.
``But Mo is Mo, and he's put mo' hurtin' on us than most people,
especially with the long ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Bret Saberhagen was unable to duplicate Martinez's mastery in
the nightcap _ done in by back-to-back home runs in the fifth _ but
the Red Sox continued to play with an urgency that made the
evening's persistent showers tolerable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pedro set up the second game for us,'' said Saberhagen, who
gave up consecutive blasts to Luis Alicea and Roberto Kelly that
left him annoyed about not throwing his fastball more. ``He did
what he does best. He gets the ball into the late part of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We only had to use Flash (Gordon) for one out in the ninth
inning of the first game, which gave Jimy the chance to use a
variety of guys in the second game, especially after the day off
(Monday).''
</P>
<P>
   And use them Williams did: four relievers in the eighth inning
alone, when Derek Lowe, Greg Swindell, Dennis Eckersley, and Jim
Corsi all faced a batter apiece. The win went to Lowe, who also
pitched the sixth and seventh and allowed just one hit in 2 1/3
innings, while Gordon's saves now number 36, the last 33 in
succession.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can honestly tell you, against the Twins, we may have been
dragging a bit,'' said John Valentin, whose opposite-field double
was a vital piece of the jigsaw puzzle of a four-run rally with
which the Red Sox won the first game. ``We weren't sharp. We
weren't crisp. Today we knew we'd lost two, the team coming in was
very good, and we couldn't be flat. Basically, I told these guys,
`We've got to do it.'''
</P>
<P>
   That's a message carried out with much greater facility when
Martinez is on the mound. In the second inning, the Red Sox ace
gave up a 414-foot home run to Rangers strongman Gonzalez that
bounced off the camera well underneath the center-field flagpole.
But he did not allow another runner past first until there were two
out in the ninth inning.
</P>
<P>
   After allowing singles to Mark McLemore and Will Clark in the
ninth, Martinez yielded to Gordon as a sellout crowd of 33,201
registered their protest of Williams's decision.
</P>
<P>
   But those boos died along with Ivan Rodriguez's game-ending fly
ball to Troy O'Leary, whose single had broken a 1-1 tie in the
sixth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in a situation where we'd gotten into a little bad
streak,'' said Martinez, who gave up just five hits and walked one
to improve his record to 16-4 while lowering his ERA to an American
League-leading 2.82.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez also struck out 10, the seventh time this season he has
punched out 10 or more and the 34th time in his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``That long road trip had caught up with us,'' he said. ``The
bad weather, the time we spent traveling, the long games were
catching up with us. On the team, it showed. Everybody on the team
was a little tired.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the night off yesterday helped a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   The benefits of Monday's rainout did not show immediately as the
Red Sox were held to one hit _ Nomar Garciaparra's ground-rule
double _ by starter John Burkett through the first five innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I figured my team was going to get him,'' said Martinez,
who allowed only four balls to be hit to the outfield, not
including Gonzalez's 34th home run on a changeup that reversed
direction at warp speed. ``And I knew I had to have a long outing
to save our relievers for the second game.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez was right on both counts. Mike Benjamin's topped roller
down the third base line for an infield hit touched off the winning
rally in the sixth, one that was executed with optimum efficiency.
Darren Lewis bunted Benjamin to second, and Valentin, who has had a
miserable time of late _ batting just .190 in his previous 19 games
_ drove a 1-and-2 sinker into the right-field corner to score
Benjamin.
</P>
<P>
   Singles by Vaughn and O'Leary followed, and after Mike Stanley
was hit by a pitch, pinch hitter Damon Buford came up big with a
two-run double off lefty reliever Eric Gunderson.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn had spent much of the night coming up empty. He struck
out four times, twice in each game, and bounced into a double play
in the nightcap before hitting his game-winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``But a professional hitter separates himself from that,''
Vaughn said. ``He takes it at-bat by at-bat. They made a lot of
good pitches to me with men on base, but I got one mistake, and
that's the name of the game.''

UT's Williams strikes remarkable friendship with Doak Walker
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JONATHAN FEIGEN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
Every day when Ricky Williams reports to Texas' new football locker
room, he will see Doak Walker. But he won't see the old man whose
life has been taken over by paralysis. He won't even see the young
man whose 1940s magazine-cover-perfect photograph Williams ordered
to have pinned to the middle of his new locker.
</P>
<P>
   He sees a friend. He sees a mentor and inspiration, a role model
from a half century earlier whom Williams has chosen for his own.
</P>
<P>
   And every few weeks, sometimes more often and sometimes less,
when Walker's wife, Skeeter, reads her husband the letters and
faxes he has received in bulk since his horrible skiing accident
seven months ago, they find another note from Ricky Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``After what happened, I try to get something in the mail to him
just so he knows he's in my thoughts and in my prayers,'' said
Williams, who struck a friendship with Walker just days before the
accident. ``With what he accomplished and what he was, and the way
he was _ so selfless _ he is who I want to be.''
</P>
<P>
   As far as Williams was concerned a year ago, Doak Walker was
just the name of an award. But before Williams would accept the
honor last season as the nation's top running back, he decided to
learn about the player for whom the trophy was named. He read first
about the former SMU and Detroit Lions star's place in football
history as the first post-World War II sports hero, perhaps the
last before television made players legends.
</P>
<P>
   But when reading about Walker's personal style and values,
Williams recognized that what mattered most to him, he and Walker
shared. And when they met, first in Orlando, Fla., for one awards
ceremony and then in Dallas for the Walker Award, they clicked.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just became very good friends,'' Skeeter Walker said, as
if the mix of Walker, 72, and Williams, 21, were just that simple.
``They're very, very good friends. That's why Ricky's letters mean
so much to Doak.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked how Walker reacts to the letters, Skeeter would
rather not say. But the only interview Walker has agreed to since
the accident was for a cable-television piece about Williams. And
when he was asked about the letters, a man who makes hospital
visitors laugh to relax them was moved to tears.
</P>
<P>
   ``They sent me the tape,'' Williams said. ``I had to brush a
tear from my eye, too. I didn't know they had so much of an effect
on Doak.''
</P>
<P>
   That is what has bonded them, what they share. The player who 50
years ago was every mother's choice for her son's role model saw
through another generation's dreadlocks, tattoos and pierced body
parts to find much in common.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Williams has written Walker now, Walker wrote notes to
fans he had somehow touched or magazine editors he believed treated
him kindly.
</P>
<P>
   Both are dramatically shy, uncomfortable with the praise their
talents draw. Both even earn unrelenting grief from teammates about
their inexplicably high-pitched voices. Each seemed to appreciate
the other's ability to look beyond appearances to the basic
kindness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ricky writes his thoughts and thoughts between the two of
them,'' Skeeter Walker said. ``I think it's unbelievable. I'm very,
very fond of Ricky. I understand why they hit it off. They're both
very humble _ genuine and humble.''
</P>
<P>
   To Williams, there can be no greater compliment than to be
compared to Walker, particularly by the person closest to Walker.
And it has nothing to do with yardage, records or awards but rather
the reminder Williams plans for each time he opens his locker.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is,'' Williams said, ``the way I want to be every day of my
life, on and off the field.''

   Murray wrote book &QL; 
on sports columns
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
What does the artist say on the day when there is no genius hand to
pick up Picasso's brush and bring the canvas to life? Or the
musician when there is no Bernstein to stand before the orchestra?
Or the soldier without Patton to lead him on the next march?
</P>
<P>
   Jim Murray died Sunday night at the age of 78. He was a sports
columnist.
</P>
<P>
   No, he was the sports columnist.
</P>
<P>
   Murray was Babe Ruth always reaching the fences. He was Jim
Brown always running into the end zone. He was Secretariat at the
Belmont _ so strong, so graceful, so very far ahead of the rest of
the field while making it look so easy.
</P>
<P>
   He was a regular fixture in the Los Angeles Times since 1961 and
a regular god among his peers, and sitting next to him at the World
Series or the Super Bowl was, for any of us columnist wannabes,
like sharing a work space with Zeus on Mount Olympus.
</P>
<P>
   What can anyone write about Jim Murray that Jim Murray wouldn't
have written better himself? That he was a friendly, gentle soul
who used sports not as a way to keep track of life's wins and
losses but as a vehicle to entertain. With wry, insightful _ and
inciteful _ columns that for nearly four decades in LA, and via
syndication in newspapers across the country, made the morning
coffee taste a little better, even if the words were sometimes hard
to swallow.
</P>
<P>
   A keen observer
</P>
<P>
   Murray on the Indy 500: ``Gentlemen, start your coffins.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray on the sizable Merlin Olsen: ``He went swimming in Loch
Ness, and the monster got out.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray on Woody Hayes: ``Consistent. Graceless in victory and
graceless in defeat.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray on Iowa fans at the Rose Bowl: ``Thousands of people in
calico and John Deere caps in Winnebagos with pacemakers and potato
salad, looking for Bob Hope.''
</P>
<P>
   A week later, the governor of Iowa was still taking shots at
him. But like so many before and after, the Guv just didn't get it.
To be tweaked by Murray in a column was like being touched on the
shoulder with a sword by the queen. It was an honor. No city in
sports was ever truly on the map until Murray zinged it.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati: ``Closed for repairs.''
</P>
<P>
   Birmingham, Ala.: ``Gateway to the Ku Klux Klan, where evening
dress means bring a bedsheet with eyeholes.''
</P>
<P>
   Detroit: ``Should be left on the doorstep of the Salvation Army,
but I don't think they can save it.''
</P>
<P>
   The entire state of West Virginia: ``An area of such permanent
arrested economic development that the only way out is to wage war
on the United States and try to lose. Even the Confederacy didn't
want it.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray did it his way, strictly for amusement. He was a man who
found his way into his readers' consciousness through the world of
sports, where he took few things less seriously than himself.
</P>
<P>
   Admiration society huge
</P>
<P>
   While working as a Hollywood reporter for Time magazine in 1953,
he was having dinner with a young actress named Marilyn Monroe.
Late in the meal, Monroe asked, ``Would you mind if I went home
with someone else?'' ``Not as long as you introduce me,'' he
replied. So she waved, and a man approached the table. ``Jim,'' she
said, ``this is Joe DiMaggio.''
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn went home with the Yankee Clipper. Murray went home to
write his story and, eventually, a legacy that would earn him a
Pulitzer Prize. He played poker with John Wayne, had drinks with
Bogey. He received fan mail from Groucho Marx and Charlton Heston.
And all the while, he wrote with the style of Fred Astaire and the
humor of Jack Benny, also friends.
</P>
<P>
   He was the writer who other writers read, the columnist that I,
like so many other columnists, always wanted to be. The first time
I came across a Jim Murray column, as a teen-ager, it was like
finding the Rosetta Stone, discovering the key to a new language.
He was funny and fair. Like the late author John D. McDonald, he
could take the ordinary and make it extraordinary.
</P>
<P>
   He lost a son at age 29 to drugs. He lost a wife to brain
cancer. But never the sense of humor or the touch. He lost all of
his sight in one eye and most of it in the other. But he still saw
things better than the rest.
</P>
<P>
   It is a small, strange fraternity of disparate personalities
that fills the sports columns in America's dailies, sharing the
experiences, the deadlines, the responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   This from Murray's autobiography: ``A column is more than a
demanding mistress. It is a raging master. It consumes you. It is
insatiable. It becomes more than you. You are not a person, you are
a publicly owned facility. Available on demand.''
</P>
<P>
   Until now. The king is dead. My profession lost a beacon in Jim
Murray.
</P>
<P>
   I lost an idol.
