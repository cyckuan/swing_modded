<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Minister on Causes of Flood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Heavy rains and rising sea
levels in the Bay of Bengal are two major causes of the country's
prolonged flood this year, Water Resources Minister Abdur Razzaq
said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Other causes of the flood include the effect of the weather
phenomenon La Nina, the reduction of flood plain because of
unplanned construction of roads, bridges, culverts and homesteads
and the rise of riverbeds due to siltation, Razzaq told Xinhua in
an exclusive interview.
</P>
<P>
"Bangladesh is a country where people are living with flood"
and "we need limited flood every year, as flood carries siltation
to the agricultural plain and makes the land fertile," he said.
</P>
<P>
But when there is too much water, it creates havoc for
agriculture and for the life and property of the people and is
harmful for the country's economic situation, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The flood this year lasts much longer than before and has
caused heavier losses. The minister estimated the loss this year
in the water resources sector alone at 150 million U.S. dollars
and the country's total loss at as high as 2.2 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
On the measures Bangladesh has taken or to be taken to prevent
and control flood, Razzaq listed construction of embankments,
river dredging and river taming.
</P>
<P>
The country's major flood facilities are around 500 embankments
along major rivers, dikes and a 250-meter-long barrage in
northeastern Bangladesh, he said.
</P>
<P>
As the country concluded a 30-year water sharing treaty with
India in 1996, it has become possible for Bangladesh to consider
the construction of a Ganges barrage within the country, both for
flood control and for storing water for the dry season, he said,
adding that the feasibility study of the project would start soon.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that river dredging is also very important, as
construction of embankments alone could not contain flooding
waters.
</P>
<P>
There is no reservoir in Bangladesh so far, but the government
has planned to construct big ponds, one for each of the 4,451
unions (townships) and for each village if possible, to store
drinking water, as the ground water level is dropping and is
believed to be arsenic-contaminated in many parts of the country,
he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He said the government, which has drafted a national water
conservancy plan, has set up a flood forecasting and warning
center and an information gathering and distributing system to
increase flood awareness among the people and would construct
permanent flood shelters across the country.
</P>
<P>
He called on the international community, mainly Bangladesh's
donor countries and agencies and other friendly countries, for
help and cooperation in embankments building and river dredging
and taming in the low-lying country.
</P>
<P>
Forty-five of the country's 64 districts have been hit by flood
since the monsoon season began in the country in early July, with
more than 20.7 million people affected and a death toll of 451 so
far.
</P>
<P>
The flood has also damaged more than 227,000 hectares of crops,
more than 377,000 houses, 9,347 kilometers of roads, 4,121
kilometers of embankments, 4,652 bridges and culverts and 1,052
educational institutions, according to the Relief and Disaster
Management Ministry.

<HEADLINE> India Controls Mosquito-Borne Diseases With Curtain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Indian scientists at the
Malaria Research Center (MRC) here claimed to have controlled
mosquito-borne diseases in urban slum areas using curtains
impregnated with insecticide.
</P>
<P>
A two-year study by an MRC team found about 90-percent
reduction of disease-causing mosquitoes in a slum area in New
Delhi, the Press Trust of India (PTI) reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
PTI quoted team leader M. A. Ansari as saying curtains coated
with the insecticide, deltamethrin, is deadly against aedes
aegypti, the mosquito species causing dengue, as well as anopheles
stephensi and anopheles culicifacies, two well-known malaria
vectors.
</P>
<P>
Ansari said the insecticide-coated curtains could kill
mosquitoes within 15 minutes and also protect people from
cockroaches, house-flies and bed-bugs.
</P>
<P>
The effect of the insecticide lasts for nine weeks, after which
it can be re-sprayed. Only 25 milligrams of deltamethrin is
required to coat the curtain on both sides.

<P>
MANILA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada Thursday said he has already accepted the resignation of
Felipe Estrella as secretary of health.
</P>
<P>
Estrada told reporters in an interview that he has assured
Estrella that the Presidential Palace would announce his
replacement "as soon as possible."
</P>
<P>
But he did not identify Estrella's successor, saying only that
he is still scouting for a new secretary who is "pro-poor" and
whose expertise is on public health.
</P>
<P>
Estrella was reported to have submitted his resignation letter
to the president last week, but the chief executive's immediate
response was to ask him to go back to work and reconsider his
decision.
</P>
<P>
In subsequent media interviews, Estrella had claimed to have
formally asked Estrada to allow him to step down and retire from
public service so he could devote more time to his grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
"He said he was already sorry for his grandchildren. He could
no longer see them because he reports to his office at 5:30 a.m.,"
Estrada said.
</P>
<P>
"According to him, he is already old. He wants to spend the
rest of life with his children and grandchildren," Estrada said of
Estrella whose extensive record in public service include director
of the Philippine General Hospital.

BEIJING, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Li Lanqing has
urged governments of flood-stricken regions to fully implement
central government instructions regarding epidemic prevention and
extend every possible effort to prevent outbreaks of infectious
diseases.
</P>
<P>

The vice-premier called on officials and medical personnel to
promote a greater awareness of the need for personal hygiene and
sanitation. He also noted the importance of properly disposing of
waste and night soil in order to prevent epidemics.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that efforts should center on closely monitoring
epidemic conditions in disaster areas and pointed the need for
adequate medical supplies and instruments to prevent outbreaks of
infectious diseases.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Urges No Retreat From Globalization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Foreign Minister S
Jayakumar has called upon developing countries to learn to cope
with the onslaught of globalization and not withdraw from the
"inexorable" process.
</P>
<P>
In a statement made at the 12th Summit of the Non-Aligned
Movement in Durban, South Africa, and released here by the
Singapore Foreign Ministry Thursday evening, Jayakumar called
globalization a clear irreversible force.
</P>
<P>
"The response to globalization should not be to withdraw
inward" and "instead we should do what we can to prepare and equip
our people to face the challenges arising from the inexorable
process of globalization, or else we will suffer higher adjustment
costs in the long run," he said.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said it is wrong to place blame squarely
on globalization for the Asian financial crisis which he said "has
snowballed into a major financial crisis with swiftness and depth
of devastation that no one could have anticipated."
</P>
<P>
Jayakumar stressed, "It was the forces of globalization that
gave the developing countries in our region direct access to the
financial resources, technology and markets of the developed
world."
</P>
<P>
"It was also globalization that allowed many developing
countries, including those in East Asia, to enjoy decades of
sustained economic growth, rapid industrialization and massive
improvement in their standards of living, health and education,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Touching on the development of the NAM, Jayakumar noted that
its membership has increased from 25 to 114 and its population has
grown from 21 to 50 percent of the world's total since its
establishment in 1961, but its share of the global income has only
grown from 5 to 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his belief that the NAM can improve its record in
the new millennium.

<HEADLINE> ADB Holds Seminar in Nepal on Consulting Services </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank
(ADB) is organizing a seminar here in an effort to improve Nepal's
capacity in strengthening implementation performance of
development projects through the efficient use of consulting
services.
</P>
<P>
The bank said Thursday that 38 people from various ministries
of Nepal and 18 ongoing ADB-assisted projects in the country are
attending the seminar to discuss current government and bank
procedures and practices in the use of consultants in development
projects.
</P>
<P>
The three-day seminar which started Wednesday focuses on
identification of major constraints and issues affecting the use
of consulting services and attempt to reconcile the procedures of
the government with the ADB's and coming up with viable solutions,
the bank said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
It noted that while recruitment of consultants for ADB-assisted
projects in Nepal has improved in recent years, delays have still
been experienced by some projects, constituting one of the major
sources of delays in project implementation.
</P>
<P>
The seminar, organized jointly with the Nepali government, will
analyze the problems in further detail and formulate measures to
address them through a participatory approach involving government
officials directly or indirectly associated with implementation of
projects in general and selection of consultants in particular,
the bank added.
</P>
<P>
ADB began operation in Nepal in December 1966 and its
cumulative lending to the country has reached 1.6 billion U.S.
dollars for 92 projects with focus on agriculture and energy.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Workers Productivity Slows in Second Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. productivity of
nonfarm, nonsupervisory workers, rose at a 0.1 percent annual rate
in the second quarter, the smallest pace in nearly two years, the
Labor Department said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
That's better than advance estimates, released last month,
which speculated that productivity had actually fallen 0.2 percent
in the second quarter. But it's still the worst showing since the
third quarter of 1996, when productivity was unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The quarterly weakness followed a healthy 3.5 percent increase
in productivity during the first three months of this year.
</P>
<P>
Economists believe that productivity has slowed because
employers are hoarding workers, even though they may have less for
them to do.
</P>
<P>
Growth in workers' output dropped sharply in the second
quarter, to a 1.6 percent annual rate from 7 percent during the
first three months of the year.
</P>
<P>
Unit labor costs, a key measure of inflation pressure,
increased at a 3.9 percent annual rate from April through June.
They had grown at a modest 1.1 percent rate in the first quarter
of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Healthy productivity gains have been cited as a key to the
nation's prosperity in the last two years. After a slump during
which productivity grew at only about a 1 percent annual rate from
1974 to 1995, it picked up to a 2.4 percent rate in 1996.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Unemployment Claims Remain Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September (Xinhua) -- The U.S. unemployment claims
still remained low and the number of first-time applicants for
unemployment benefits rose by 1,000 to a seasonally adjusted
302,000 last week, the Labor Department reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
However, a four-week moving average of claims fell to 302,250
from 303,750 for the period ended one week earlier. That's the
lowest level in a year.
</P>
<P>
The financial trouble spreading from Asia has affected the U.S.
exports and as a result, U.S. economic growth slowed to a 1.6
percent annual rate in the second quarter from a robust 5.5
percent growth during the first three months of the year.
</P>
<P>
But jobs remain plentiful so far. Weekly unemployment claims
have hovered near 300,000 since settling back from this year's
high of 394,000, reached in two weeks during the General Motors
strike in late June and early July.
</P>
<P>
Even with the strike, the nation's unemployment rate in July
remained near a 28-year low, at 4.5 percent.

UNITED NATIONS, September 3 (Xinhua) -- There are more than 10
U.N. staff in the Swissair plane that crashed off Canada
Wednesday, killing all 229 aboard, U.N. sources said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
No names were immediately released. Officials of the
Geneva-based World Health Organization (WHO) said earlier that the
passengers included Dr. Jonathan Mann, funding director of WHO's
Global Program on AIDS, and his wife.
</P>
<P>
The New York-Geneva route is heavily traveled by U.N. staff and
diplomats flying between U.N. headquarters in New York and the
world body's European office in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
The airliner took off from New York's Kennedy airport at 7.53
pm EDT Wednesday. Swissair said the pilot had jettisoned fuel
before the crash.
</P>
<P>
The disaster was the worst in the history of Swiss aviation.
Swissair has one of the world's best safety records, and the crash
is the first disaster to hit it since October 1979 when a
Beijing-bound DC8 carrying 142 people crashed into a wire fence
while landing at Athens airport, killing 14 people.
</P>
<P>
Thursday morning at the headquarters of the United Nations in
New York, there are no flags of the member states flying in front
of the Secretariat building, and the U.N. flag is flying at
half-mast.

LONDON, September 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
arrived in Omagh Thursday afternoon to meet survivors and victims'
relatives of the bomb blast, according to a BBC report.
</P>
<P>
In his a few hours trip, he will also lay a wreath to the
victims of the car bombing that killed 28 people and injured 220
others on August 15 in the small town some 110 km west of Belfast.
</P>
<P>
Omagh has been struck by almost 30 bombs over the past 30 years
of guerrilla conflict, claiming 150 lives.
</P>
<P>
Clinton arrived in Northern Ireland Thursday morning for a
one-day trip to the British province to show his support for the
peace process after the deadly bombing in Omagh last month.
</P>
<P>
People of all ages paused Thursday to reflect on the
devastation to the town and the boost given by Clinton's visit,
part of his visit to Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Before he arrived in Omagh, Clinton and British Prime Minister
Tony Blair expressed their sorrow in Belfast over the crash of a
Swissair airliner into the Atlantic, killing all 229 passengers
and crew.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said in a speech that "our thoughts and prayers" are
with the victims and their families.
</P>
<P>
"We hope for the best and we are deeply grieved that this has
occurred," he said.
</P>
<P>

UNITED NATIONS, September 3 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan said Thursday that he was "deeply saddened" by the
deaths of more than 200 victims of the air disaster Wednesday
night near Halifax, Nova Scotia, including a number of members of
the United Nations family.
</P>
<P>
"These include United Nations staff who worked for the welfare

<HEADLINE> Development is Not Smooth: Chinese Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DURBAN (South Africa), September 3 (Xinhua) -- Economic
globalization has posed "serious challenges" to deeloping
countries, Tang Jiaxuan, head of the Chinese delegation to the
Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) summit, said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the summit, the Chinese foreign minister said that
as the trend toward the multi-polarity and globalization has
picked up speed, countries in the world are becoming all the more
inter-dependent.
</P>
<P>
While the developing nations as a whole are gaining strength
and playing a greater role in international affairs, economic
globalization has posed serious challenges for many developing
countries, he added.
</P>
<P>
"The gap between developed countries and developing ones
continues to widen," he said.
</P>
<P>
Tang told the summit that various destabilizing factors will
linger on while the world situation is moving toward relaxation.
</P>
<P>
He cited these destabilizing factors as stalemated Middle East
peace process, the escalating nuclear arms race in South Asia and
armed conflicts cropping up in certain regions in Africa and
Europe.
</P>
<P>
"All these are a constant warning for us that the road to
development is by no means smooth," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Despite the major changes on the international scene, the NAM
remains "a force not to be ignored on the international arena in
the political, economic and cultural fields", he said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese foreign minister expressed his belief that the
non-aligned countries will face up to the challenges, further
enhance their solidarity, continue to play a constructive role in
safeguarding the interests of developing countries and promoting
the establishment of a just and equitable new international
political and economic order.

<P>
ATHENS, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Greece's industrial production
increased by 4.5 percent during the first half of this year
compared with the same period in 1997, the Greek National
Statistics Service (NSS) announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In June this year, the country's industrial production rose to
6.4 percent compared to the same month last year.
</P>
<P>
The NSS attributed the rise in industrial production to the
devaluation of the national currency, drachma, last March which
boosted exports, and to the increase in exports to eastern
countries, especially those made during the first six months.

for establishing a private container terminal there.
</P>
<P>
The Chittagong Dock Bandar Sramik Karmachari Parishad (CDBSKP),
a platform of 22 trade unions strongly opposed to a government
decision to allow the construction of a private terminal nearby,
slapped a shutdown on the port in an instant protest, the
Associated Press of Bangladesh reported.
</P>
<P>
The clash occurred at about 10:30 a.m. local time near the
Bandar Bhaban (building) when a procession of CDBSKP staging a
black-flag protest confronted a white-flag procession of
Newmooring Patenga Terminal Implantation Council, a platform of
three trade unions favoring the establishment of the planned
private terminal.
</P>
<P>
Both groups used sticks and bricks in the rioting, which took
place also ahead of the arrival of a mission of the Asian
Development Bank (ADB) for a spot appraisal of its assistance for
the port sector.
</P>
<P>
The rival groups clashed once again when CDBSKP supporters were
holding a rally in front of the Bandar Bhaban at 10:45 a.m. which
lasted 15 minutes. Police fired tear shells and blank shots to
quell the rioters.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also confronted at Nimtala in the port area, this
time with firearms, at about 11:15 a.m. Police pacified the
situation by lobbing tear shells and firing in the air.
</P>
<P>
Ten seriously-wounded workers were admitted to Bandar Hospital
from where four in critical condition were shifted to the
Chittagong Medical College Hospital.
</P>
<P>
The CDBSKP leaders at an impromptu press conference gave an
indefinite strike call in the port and stopped work, resulting in
a deadlock at the seaport, the country's commercial heartland.
</P>
<P>
They said they would not call off the strike until the
government decision on the establishment of the private container
terminal is rescinded.
</P>
<P>
Their demands also included immediate resignation of Deputy
Shipping Minister Saber Hossain, whom they accused of trying to
"sell out the interests of the port," compensation for the wounded
workers and punishment of those involved in the attacks.
</P>
<P>
The deputy shipping minister arrived in Chittagong Wednesday to
hold a meeting with the eight-member ADB mission on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chittagong Port Authority officials were holding a
reconciliation meeting with CDBSKP while tensions mounted in the
port area with a huge contingent of police keeping watch on the
situation.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Drivers Freed by Taliban Arrive in Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Five Iranian drivers
released by the Islamic Taliban militia arrived here Thursday from
the southern Afghan city of Kandahar.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian drivers who flew in on a special plane along with a
joint Pak-Iranian delegation Thursday evening were greeted at the
airport by senior officials from Pakistan's Foreign Office and
the Iranian Embassy in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The Pak-Iranian delegation led by Ayaz Wazir, director of
Afghan affairs in the Pakistani Foreign Office, and Abdullahi, a
senior Iranian diplomat in Pakistan, went to Kandahar on the
special plane Thursday morning, a day after the Taliban
authorities announced that they would release the Iranians.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban's supreme leader, Mohammad Omar, announced
Wednesday that "as a goodwill gesture," the militia would release
three out of 30 Iranian drivers they arrested last month when they
overran Mazar-e-Sharif, headquarters of the rival Northern
Alliance.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban claimed that these Iranian drivers were sending
weapons to the pro-Iranian Northern Alliance while the Iranian
government said they were carrying humanitarian aid to northern
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Iranian government claimed that its 11 diplomats
in Mazar-e-Sharif, about 300 kilometers north of Kabul, have also
been kidnapped by the Taliban, which denied the accusation.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Kurdish Factions to Discuss Creating Joint </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of two rivaling Iraqi
Kurdish factions will meet soon in Washington to discuss creating
a joint administration in northern Iraq, Turkey's Anatolia News
Agency reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) Chairman Massoud Barzani and
Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) leader Celal Talabani will
attend the Washington meeting, KDP spokesman Sami Abdurrahman was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the meeting was held in Washington because
"the United States wants to mediate between the two groups".
</P>
<P>
He noted that the basic dispute between the KDP and PUK is the
sharing of the administration. "We wanted the joint administration
in 1992, but the PUK defended the view that the administration has
to be shared equally between the two sides," he said.
</P>
<P>
Barzani, who arrived here Wednesday night for a visit, will
travel to Washington on Saturday after concluding his talks with
Turkish leaders.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Barzani will meet with Turkish parliamentary Speaker
Hikmet Cetin, Deputy Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit and Foreign
Minister Ismail Cem to exchange views on the proposed joint
administration and the activities of the outlawed anti-Turkish
Kurdish Workers' Party in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In March, Talabani sent a letter to Massoud seeking a
broad reconciliation in a bid to set up a permanent peace in
northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, Talabani proposed a high-level meeting between
the two factions to sort out their differences.
</P>
<P>
The two groups have fought for control of northern Iraq
after the 1991 Gulf War undermined Baghdad's ability to exert
influence there.

<HEADLINE> Canadian PM Sad at Swiss Plane Crash Off Canadian Coast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien expressed Thursday sadness on behalf of the Canadian
people at the news that a Swissair jet had crashed into the ocean
off the coast of Nova Scotia.
</P>
<P>
The latest report said that 36 bodies have been recovered from
the crash. But there has been no survivors.
</P>
<P>
Swissair also confirmed that there were no survivors from the
crash. All 215 passengers and 14 crew aboard Flight 111 are
believed to have died.
</P>
<P>
The wide-bodied MD-11 jet crashed about 10:30 p.m.local time
(0130 GMT) Wednesday into the ocean 11 kilometers from Peggy's
Cove, a tiny fishing village on the south shore of Canada's Nova
Scotia province.
</P>
<P>
"The families and loved ones of those who have been lost in
this terrible disaster are in all of our thoughts and prayers,"
Chretien said in statement.
</P>
<P>
Chretien said he had written to Swiss President Flavio Cotti
expressing the deepest sympathies of the Canadian people, and
pledging that every resource at Canada's disposal is being devoted
to the recovery effort and the investigation.
</P>
<P>
The three-engine plane, en route from New York to Geneva,
reported smoke in the cockpit after a normal takeoff from the JFK
international airport in New York.
</P>
<P>
The crew decided to turn back to Boston. After being told that
the Halifax airport was closer, the plane flew in the direction of
Halifax, but crashed into the Atlantic about 60 kilometers short
of its target.
</P>
<P>
Military aircraft, coast guard vessels and fishing boats scoured
the crash waters through the night.
</P>
<P>
Yet the inky and rough water made it difficult for rescue teams
to navigate through the debris field, which spread a couple of
kilometers across the sea.
</P>
<P>
As dawn broke on the southwest coast of Nova Scotia, a
shoreline search got under way.
</P>
<P>
"At this point, our main focus is on recovering the bodies,"
said Roy Bears of Canada's Transportation Safety Board, one of the
lead agencies in the investigation.
</P>
<P>
Divers will be moved in to try to recover flight recorders from
the plane, the reports said. The water in the area is about 50
meters deep.
</P>
<P>
Canadian police appealed to the public Thursday to turn in any
debris from the crash, which might wash up the shore.
</P>
<P>
The weather there was reported to be overcast, with a light
sprinkle of rain.
</P>
<P>
Boeing, the maker of the jet, was sending a team of people to
Nova Scotia to help in the investigation of the crash.
</P>
<P>
The United States also sent a team of investigators to the
crash site, the reports said.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin Inspects Flood-Ravaged Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGDE (Hunan Province), September 3 (Xinhua) -- Chinese
President Jiang Zemin today urged continued vigilance along the
Yangtze River and pledged that the government will provide for the
daily needs of flood victims.
</P>
<P>
The president arrived in Hunan Province this morning to begin a
fact-finding tour of flood-ravaged areas. Local officials briefed
the president on flood control operations and Jiang said that
receding flood waters along the Yangtze do not indicate the end of
this year's flood season. He noted that water levels in many
sections remain above danger levels.
</P>
<P>
He called for continued vigilance and urged people engaged in
the flood control effort to take effective measures to ensure the
safety of levees and strive for ultimate success.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, who is also general secretary of the Chinese Communist
Party Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military
Commission, said efforts must be made to guarantee the basic daily
needs of people in flood-stricken areas.
</P>
<P>
"We must ensure victims have adequate food, clean drinking
water and clothing. They must have adequate shelter and access to
immediate medical care," Jiang told local officials, adding that
local governments should make arrangements to help victims cope
with the coming winter.
</P>
<P>
He pointed to the great importance in stablizing public order
and maintaining security in disaster areas. He said efforts must
be made to ensure that schools open on schedule and noted that
universities should provide assistance and provide financial aid
to students from disaster areas if necessary.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also discussed reconstruction and stressed that special
attention should be attached to reducing burdens on farmers.
</P>
<P>
Braving heavy wind and rain, President Jiang Zemin went to
flood-fighting scenes in Anxiang County, Hunan Province this
afternoon and met with armymen and civilians fighting floods on
the levees.
</P>
<P>
Jiang shook hands with soldiers on the levee that had been
breached in late July but were patched up after 11 day-and-night
efforts. He thanked the soldiers for their contributions to
fighting the floods and protecting people's lives and properties.
</P>
<P>
He also met with Wang Chixiang, wife of a local environmental
protection official who died on August 27 while fighting floods
on the levee.
</P>
<P>
Jiang later went to visit evacuation camps scattered on the
70-kilometer levee, where about 100,000 people are living in tents
or makeshift shelters.
</P>
<P>
He stopped to visit a temporary primary school where some 160
children were having classes in eight tents. The president asked
the students to treasure their chances to study.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also visited medical workers on the levee where they were
offering medical service to local patients.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
headquarters in New York Thursday morning flew the U.N. flag at
half-mast and took down all national flags of 185 member countries
in a sign of mourning over the deaths in the Swissair crash.
</P>
<P>
"The decision was made mid-morning," U.N. Spokesman Fred
Eckhard told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The 229 air crash victims included five U.N. staff members who
worked for the U.N. Children's Fund, the Intellectual Property
Organization and the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees and
Jonathan Mann, a famous American expert on AIDS, who worked with
the World Health Organization, he said.
</P>
<P>
Vladimir Petrovsky, director-general of the U.N. office in
Geneva, said that the U.N. flag would be flown at half-mast Friday
at the Geneva Office.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan gave a press conference in
South Africa Thursday morning (local time) to voice his sad
feeling over the air disaster, the spokesman said, adding that
Annan "was deeply moved as he knew some of the victims
personally." The U.N. chief is currently in Durban, South Africa,
to attend the Non-aligned Movement summit.
</P>
<P>
A Swissair plane with 229 people aboard Wednesday night crashed
off Nova Scotia, Canada, on a flight from New York to Geneva.
</P>

<HEADLINE> German Bankruptcy Wave Calms Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The steady increases in corporate
bankruptcies registered since 1991 in Germany are coming to a stop
gradually thanks to an improving economy, the German Statistics
Office said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The bankruptcies, which still rose at a record-setting pace
early this year, now concentrated more on smaller companies
instead of the big ones, a signal for a trend reversal as past
experience showed, said President of the Statistics Office Johann
Hahlen in Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
The office's latest data showed that a total of 13,998
companies declared bankruptcy in the first half of this year, up
only 3.1 percent from the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
By comparison, Germany's bankruptcy total increased by 7.6
percent in 1997 and 14.3 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
For the month of June alone, Germany registered only 2,180
corporate bankruptcies, down 16.7 percent from a year ago.

<HEADLINE> Greece Pledges to Stick to Target of Joining EMU </HEADLINE>

<P>
ATHENS, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Despite an economic crisis
hitting the world markets, Greece vowed Thursday that it would
stick to its target of joining the European Economic and Monetary
Union (EMU) by January 1, 2001.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after a cabinet meeting, Greek government
spokesman Dimitris Reppas said that the government would keep, as
this year, the same targets in its economic policy for 1999.
</P>
<P>
This was the only right recipe, he said, adding that this
year's economic policy aimed at cutting inflation and deficits,
shrinking the public sector and making structural changes to the
national economy.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the Greek government, which was
concerned at the financial fallout from Russia's crisis, could not
rule out the possibility of renewed turmoil, but believed any
fresh eruption could, to some extent, be controlled.
</P>
<P>
Greece has said that the drachmas' entry into the exchange rate
mechanism has strengthened the country's economic credibility and
is working as a shied against the current crisis.

<HEADLINE> Oil Prices Recover Amidst Worries Over Russian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 3 (Xinhua) - Oil prices seem to be staging a
recovery as potential long disruptions to Russian supplies began
to unnerve the markets.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark Brent burst above 13 U.S. dollars a barrel
Thursday for the first time in a month, trading at 13.01 U.S.
dollars at one time in the afternoon, up 55 cents over the day.
</P>
<P>
The rebound made some inroads into this year's price losses,
which have dragged Brent values a third below last year's average
of 19.30 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
A global stock glut built up early this year as Asian demand
fell away has been stifling any upturn, despite some 3 million
barrels per day of producer cuts aimed at rebalancing the market.
</P>
<P>
But prices have at last got a fillip from the threat that
Russia's financial crisis could seize up its 2.5 million bpd oil
export system, oil market analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Russian crude exports from its main Black Sea and Baltic
outlets have suffered severe cuts since August 28 as the chaos
among Russia's banks prevents lifters from getting hold of the
money to pay necessary customs dues, according to Reuters.
</P>
<P>
While the odd crude cargo is now loading, traders fear that the
problems could well persist given the scale of Russia's economic
problems.
</P>
<P>
Russia is also a key supplier of oil products such as gas oil
and fuel oil to Europe through the same outlets, although so far
product liftings have not been hard hit.
</P>
<P>
Prolonged problems with Nigerian supply are further draining
supplies to Europe.
</P>
<P>
Royal Dutch/Shell has had to stop some 600,000 bpd of export
from the West African state for around two weeks on technical
problems and pipeline sabotage by disaffected local communities.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Comforts Survivors of Omagh Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Thursday met and comforted about 500 survivors of the car bomb and
relatives of the victims at a leisure center in Omagh, 110 km west
of Belfast.
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by First Lady Hillary, and British Prime Minister
Tony Blair and his wife Cherie, Clinton said, "To all of you, we
thank you for standing up in the face of such a soul-searing loss,
and restating your determination to walk the road of peace."
</P>
<P>
Twenty-eight died and 220 were injured in the car bomb blast at
a shopping center in Omagh on August 15, the bloodiest day in
almost 30 years of Northern Irish strife.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who arrived earlier in the day in Northern Ireland to
show his support to the peace process, said he had come to Omagh
to support "your determined refusal to let a cowardly crime rob
you of the future you have chosen," according to a BBC report from
Omagh.
</P>
<P>
He also said it was "high time to stop yesterday's nightmares
from killing tomorrow's dreams."
</P>
<P>
"What happened here on August 15 was so incredibly
unreasonable, so shocking to the conscience of every decent person
in this land, that it has perversely had exactly the reverse
impact that the people who perpetrated this act intended.... It
galvanized, strengthened and humanized the impulse to peace,"
Clinton said.

<HEADLINE> Top Russian Official Warns of Food Shortage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 3 (Xinhua) -- A ranking Russian official said
Thursday that the current financial crisis may cause serious food
shortages in the country.
</P>
<P>
Andrei Kushnerenko, deputy head of the Ministry for Foreign
Economic Relations and Trade, said foreign firms are stopping
commodity shipments to Russia because they do not trust Russian
banks, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, higher customs payments which resulted in the sharp
devaluation of the ruble have left most importers unable to pay
the tariffs.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank of Russia set the official exchange rate for
Friday at 13.4608 rubles to the U.S. dollar, a drop of some 113.7
percent as compared to the rate half a month ago.
</P>
<P>
Kushnerenko called for radical measures to adjust the country's
customs tariffs policy.
</P>
<P>
As a provisional measure, Kushnerenko said, the government
should reduce customs import tariffs on raw materials for the
Russian food industry.
</P>
<P>
Russian food enterprises buy 60-65 percent of their raw
materials from abroad. The percentage for Moscow perches at 85-90
percent.
</P>
<P>
He warned that if the financial crisis persists and the customs
tariffs policy is not changed, import of Western foodstuffs into
Russia may stop completely.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Viktor Khlystun, director of the
Russian Institute of Agrarian Market Studies, said the financial
crisis will not make Russians starve, but food shortages are
inevitable.
</P>
<P>
Khlystun, a former agriculture and food minister, told Interfax
that shortages of vegetable oil and meat products may be
especially acute.
</P>
<P>
Many Russian consumers may no longer be able to afford imported
vegetable oil as prices, which already shot up on the world
market, rise even higher in the wake of the weak ruble, he said.

<HEADLINE> Canada Spends Billions to Defend Currency in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Canada spent a
total of 5.824 billion U.S. dollars in August to prop up the
Canadian dollar in August, the Finance Department said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Official government operations decreased reserves by 5,824
million U.S. dollars," the department said.
</P>
<P>
The central bank intervened actively during August "to promote
orderly markets for the Canadian dollar due to turbulence in
international financial markets and downward pressure on the
currency," it said.
</P>
<P>
Canada's official international reserves decreased by an amount
equivalent to 4.555 billion U.S. dollars during August to 17.965
billion dollars in August.
</P>
<P>
The reserves are made up of 11.903 billion U.S. dollars, 2.969
billion dollars in other currencies, 131 million dollars in gold,
1.047 billion dollars in special drawing rights and 1.915 in
reserve position in the International Monetary Fund.

<HEADLINE> Taliban, Iran to Try to Find Missing Iranians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Afghanistan's Islamic
Taliban militia and Iran agreed on Thursday to form a joint
investigating team to probe into the whereabouts of the 11 missing
Iranian diplomats in northern Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, five Iranians released by the Taliban arrived here
along with a Pakistani-Iranian joint delegation from the southern
Afghan city of Kandahar.
</P>
<P>
Three of the five were among the 30 Iranian drivers arrested by
the Taliban when the latter overran Mazar-e-Sharif, headquarters
of the pro-Iranian Northern Alliance, in early August. The other
two Iranians were taken by the hard-line militia in Afghanistan
last year.
</P>
<P>
"This is a good step, but it is not enough, they should go
forward," Abdullahi, Iran's deputy consul in Peshawar, who led the
delegation to the Taliban's stronghold to fetch the freed
Iranians, told reporters at the airport.
</P>
<P>
He said the Taliban have promised to give a final statement to
clarify all the earlier controversial ones concerning the 11
Iranian diplomats who have been missing since the Taliban's
capture of Mazar-e-Sharif, about 300 kilometers north of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
"In case they are unable to give the final results, a joint
delegation from the Taliban and Iran, with the participation of
the Pakistani brothers, will go to Mazar-e-Sharif to see what
happened to them," Abdullahi said.
</P>
<P>
Aziz Khan, Pakistan's ambassador to Afghanistan, also termed
the release of the five Iranians by the Taliban as a "good
beginning," saying this will help ease the tension between the two
sides.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban's envoy in Pakistan, Maulvi Saeed-ur-Rahman,
expressed the hope that this "goodwill gesture" taken by the
Taliban would help the militia and Iran to start negotiations on
the pending issues between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
He said the Taliban government wants to have good relations
with all the neighboring countries but it will not accept any
interference in Afghanistan's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban authorities have claimed that the arrested Iranian
drivers were involved in sending weapons to the Northern Alliance
while the Iranian government stated that they were carrying
humanitarian aid. Meanwhile, the Taliban have said they had no
knowledge of the 11 missing Iranian diplomats, but Iran accused
the militia of kidnapping them.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The Indian armed forces
would increasingly depend on information technology (IT) with the
information war heralding a new revolution in military affairs,
Indian Defense Minister George Fernandes said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating a conference and exhibition on "Information
Technology in Indian Army," the minister disclosed that his
ministry had established six joint task forces including one on IT
between Defense Services and Confederation of Indian Industry.
</P>
<P>
The Indian services would be a major contributor toward
providing connectivity to civilians in remote areas as part of the
decade-long National Information Technology Vision Program
(1998-2008), Fernandes said.
</P>
<P>
He said the armed forces were committed to establishing centers
of excellence with core competency in many security-related areas
of information technology.
</P>
<P>
As part of the national agenda of the Indian government led by
the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to make India an IT superpower by
2008, the government has approved a 108-point action plan prepared
by a task force dealing with software, hardware and human resource
development.

<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Agriculture Minister
Trilochan Dhakal said here Thursday that there will be no shortage
of chemical fertilizers for winter crops in the country.
</P>
<P>
He was quoted by the official RSS news agency as telling the
Lower House of Parliament that there used to be a shortage of
fertilizers in the country, but as the private sector has been
provided license for import of fertilizers, the supply system has
been strengthened.
</P>
<P>
At present the country has a stock of urea, potassium and other
chemical fertilizers and the private sector is importing
additional fertilizers, he said.
</P>
<P>
Inadequate supply of fertilizers used to be a serious problem
in Nepal, where 82 percent of the population depends on
agriculture for livelihood.
</P>
<P>
Early this year, the government formulated new policies
involving the private sector in importing fertilizers, thus
breaking the monopoly of the state-owned Agricultural Inputs
Corporation.

LAGOS, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Representatives of the Canadian
government are expected in Nigeria next Monday to discuss the
restoration of diplomatic relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
According to reliable sources, David Kilgour, Secretary of
State for Africa and Latin America, is to head the delegation.
</P>
<P>
Canada closed its embassy in Nigeria early last year as its
staff were allegedly unsafe following a spate of bomb blasts in
Nigeria and attacks on the Canadian embassy.
</P>
<P>
In September 1996, Nigeria closed its mission, saying that
Nigeria's economy could no longer sustain the maintenance of a
large number of diplomatic missions and personnel abroad.
</P>
<P>
Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy said on August 24
that his country would move to restore ties with Nigeria and be
offering financial and technical assistance towards successful
implementation of Nigeria's transition program.
</P>
<P>
Axworthy attributed the intention to restore relations with
Nigeria to measures taken by the present government to restore

<HEADLINE> WB to Assess Aid Needs of Bangladesh Flood Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 3 (Xinhua) --The World Bank (WB) will make
fresh aid commitments for post-flood rehabilitation in Bangladesh
only after the assessment of requirements, the Associated Press of
Bangladesh (APB) reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We'll assess with the (Bangladeshi) government what the needs
are (for the rehabilitation programs)," Pierre Landell-Mills, the
bank's country director, was quoted as saying in Dhaka.
</P>
<P>
Like previous years, the bank would extend assistance to
Bangladesh to help it heal the damage caused by this year's
floods, he said.
</P>
<P>
The bank has already written to the Bangladeshi government
asking for an outline where the donor agency could extend its
assistance for post-flood rehabilitation works, he added.
</P>
<P>
He further said an assessment of the requirements of aid is
needed for the bank to make any commitment because it cannot
specify any amount without knowing the needs.
</P>
<P>
He however suggested that the government use for the purpose
part of the funds approved by the bank for at least three projects
involving over 650 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The level of the bank's lending (to Bangladesh) has recently
been raised to 600 million-650 million dollars from the earlier
400 million-540 million dollars, showing nearly a 50-percent rise,
he stated. He added that the raise was justified considering the
size of the country's population, level of poverty and its
performance which is "always better than other countries."
</P>
<P>
The Bangladeshi government has appealed to donor countries and
international agencies for assistance to flood victims since the
nearly two-month-long severe flood has caused enormous losses to
the country.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's National Party Losing Ground: Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 3 (Xinhua) -- With the 1999 general
election less than a year away, the voter support for the
National Party (NP), South Africa's biggest opposition party, has
dropped below the psychological level of 10 percent, an opinion
poll showed.
</P>
<P>
The party had nine percent support as in July this year, down
from 10 percent in May and 12 percent in last November, Markinor,
a major independent research company in South Africa, said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The NP, the former ruling party in the apartheid era, won 20
percent of the votes in the country's first democratic election
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Markinor's latest survey showed the ruling African National
Congress (ANC) has increased its support to 57 percent in July
from 54 percent in May.
</P>
<P>
The party won 63 percent of the votes in the 1994 election.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Democratic Party, another white-based
opposition party, continued to gain ground, with six percent
support registered in July, up from five percent in May and three
percent in last November.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted by secret ballot among 3,499 people,
showed that undecided voters accounted for 13 percent of the
respondents.
</P>
<P>
Releasing the figures, the organization predicted the
political landscape would not change dramatically over the next
few months.
</P>
<P>
It said the ANC stood to re-affirm its position at around 60
percent in the next election, and the real battle lay between the
larger opposition parties running for the second place.
</P>
<P>
With its support continuing to fall and voters' confidence
shaken, the NP leadership could be expected to resort to "rather
desperate measures", such as a return to the government of
national unity, Markinor said.
</P>
<P>
The NP's popularity has been waning since its former leader F
W de Klerk decided to withdrew from the national government in
1996.

<HEADLINE> More Refugees Swarm into Tanzania from Congo (K) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The number of refugees
flowing into Tanzania from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)
has surpassed 2,400 since the outbreak of war in the country on
August 2, a United Nations refugee agency official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Vincent Parker, senior external relations officer of the
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), said in
Dar es Salaam that 379 Congolese refugees arrived in Tanzania
Tuesday and Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Among the new arrivals, 174 were adults and 205 were children,
he said, adding that they came to the Kigoma Region in west
Tanzania by boat from a village called Mboko in DRC's Fizi zone.
</P>
<P>
"The group reported that soldiers had allowed them to cross
into Tanzania," Parker said. "It is therefore expected that more
refugees would arrive from the Fizi zone."
</P>
<P>
The officer said that they have set aside two camps for
refugees, Nyarugusu and Lufugu, which have a total capacity to
accommodate 50,000 refugees.
</P>
<P>
"For the time being we do not have any problems concerning
food, treatment, shelter and water," he said.
</P>
<P>
The refugees crossed Lake Tanganyika by boat into Kigoma after
Tutsi-led rebels took up arms in the east of DRC to topple the
government of President Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, UNHCR officials said the influx of refugees is
manageable, as they are capable of handling even 1,000 new
arrivals a day.

<HEADLINE> UK Publishes Guidelines to Curb Use of Antibiotics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The British government Thursday
published new guidelines on the prescribing of antibiotics amid
fears of the emergence of drug-resistant "superbugs."
</P>
<P>
Doctors should not prescribe antibiotics for conditions caused
by viruses such as coughs, colds and sore throats, the Standing
Medical Advisory Committee of the Department of Health said in its
report, The Path of Least Resistance.
</P>
<P>
Other recommendations include a national education campaign to
explain to patients that they should not expect antibiotics when
they go to their doctors, and healthy women with uncomplicated
cystitis should only be prescribed antibiotics for three days.
</P>
<P>
The guidelines were issued ahead of a meeting of chief medical
officers from European Union nations next week in Copenhagen to
devise strategies to control the spread of antibiotic resistant
bacteria.
</P>
<P>
The British government is also trying to use the
recommendations for a national framework on antibiotic use, to be
announced later this year.
</P>
<P>
Antibiotics have revolutionized medical care in the 20th
century, but in recent years the drug-resistant "superbugs" have
been winning the battle against the medical profession.
</P>
<P>
"In the closing years of the century, there is an uneasy sense
that micro-organisms are `getting ahead' and that therapeutic
options are narrowing," The Path of Least Resistance report said.
</P>
<P>
The Public Laboratory in North London has collected figures
showing that the number of people with drug resistant infections
in Britain has quadrupled over the past two years.
</P>
<P>
Researchers in Japan have found that a strain of the common
bacterial infection staphylococus aureus did not respond to
vancomycin, one of the most powerful antibiotics.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Opposes Unilateral Intervention in DRC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni Thursday told the 12th Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) summit
that Uganda does not accept unilateral military intervention by
individual countries or sectional intervention by groups of
countries in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
He made the announcement when addressing the plenary session
at the NAM summit Thursday morning in Durban, South Africa, a
press release from the President's Office said.
</P>
<P>
NAM has always opposed the presence of foreign troops in
foreign lands, he said, because it always distorts the internal
politics of that country in such a way that the political
questions are not addressed.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, Museveni asserted, if foreign army intervenes in
any country, it should be under the very clear supervision of the
United Nations or of recognized regional bodies.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan president condemned the intervention of foreign
troops on the side of a government which is not elected by
popular mandate and urged the countries in the region to discuss
the deepening crisis in the DRC at appropriate regional fora as
they have already started doing.
</P>
<P>
He confessed that Uganda has had troops in eastern DRC for one
year following an understanding with President Laurent Kabila's
government in order to fight barbaric terrorists operating from
that area since the days of late dictator Sese Seko Mobutu.
</P>
<P>
Museveni proposed that the presence of those troops be
reviewed by mutual discussions especially if alternative
arrangements are made for the security of all affected by the
terrorist activities.
</P>
<P>
He pledged full support for the initiative raised by South
African President Nelson Mandela on seeking a political
resolution to the conflict.
</P>
<P>
Uganda has been accused by Kabila of fomenting the month-long
Tutsi rebellion and of sending troops to support the rebels, a
charge Kampala quickly denied.
</P>
<P>
With the military intervention in the DRC crisis by Zimbabwe,
Angola and Namibia in mid-August, the war began to turn against
the rebels who had advanced to the suburbs of capital Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Uganda said that it would send troops to the DRC if
the conflict there continues to regionalize and its national
security is under threat.

<P>
ANKARA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Mesut
Yilmaz is to visit Jordan, Israel and Palestine starting on Sunday
in a bid to play a role in the peace process, Turkish Foreign
Ministry said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said that bilateral relations, regional and
international issues would be discussed during Yilmaz's visit.
</P>
<P>
It added that several agreements would be signed with an aim to
enhance Turkey's cooperation in various fields with the three
sides.
</P>
<P>
During the three-day visit, Yilmaz is expected to meet with
Jordan's Crown Prince Hassan, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and Palestinian National Authority (PNA) President
Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Israel and Jordan have maintained closer ties with Ankara, but
the PNA is critical of the rapid expansion of the Turkish-Israeli
military ties.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Israel began their military cooperation since early
1996 after they signed a deal under which Turkey allowed Israeli
fighter pilots to train in its air space.
</P>
<P>
The past two years witnessed frequent exchanges of visits by
senior military officials between the two countries. The
Turkish-Israeli military cooperation has sparked widespread
protests from the Arab world.

<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 3 (Xinhua) -- In another step toward
restoring its ties with Iraq, Syria Thursday reopened its trade
center in Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Trade Minister Mohammed Mehdi Saleh and Director-General
of the Syrian head of Free Trade Zones Khalid Raad inaugurated the
center, where samples of Syrian-made medicine, foodstuff and
clothes were displayed.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, the Iraqi minister said the reopening of
the Syrian trade center in Baghdad would make contributions to the
expansion of the bilateral trade ties.
</P>
<P>
He said the trade volume between the two countries has amounted
to about 150 million U.S. dollars since last year, emphasizing
Iraq's wishes to broaden trade cooperation with Syria in the
future.
</P>
<P>
Raad said the reopening of the trade center was a step to
further strengthen the bilateral relations and that it could serve
as a window of Syrian goods for the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian official paid tribute to the efforts exerted by the
two sides to speed up the reopening of the center and an Iraqi one
in Syria's capital Damascus.
</P>
<P>
The diplomatic relations between Iraq and Syria were severed in
1980 due to Syria's support for Iran during the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq
War.
</P>
<P>
But the bilateral ties in the trade and economic fields have
been improving recently. Baghdad and Damascus have already agreed
to reopen oil pipelines linking Iraq's northern oil-fields and
Syria's Mediterranean ports.

<P>
MOSCOW, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Up to 15-20 percent of workers
in the Russian banking sector will lose their jobs in the wake of
the financial crisis, an industry official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"This is rooted in the government's erroneous moves, not in
poor bank management," Sergei Yegorov, Association of Russian
Banks President Sergei Yegorov said.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the layoffs to the banking crisis caused by the
collapse of the state securities market.
</P>
<P>
Interfax said the future of the banks and the number of workers
to be dismissed will depend on the degree of the population's
trust in commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, investors have closed about 15 percent of their
deposits with commercial banks, Interfax reported, quoting
prominent bankers.
</P>
<P>
In Moscow, leading employment agencies estimate that between
40,000 and 100,000 employees of banks and financial and investment
companies will lose their jobs in the next two months.

<HEADLINE> More Refugees Swarm into Tanzania from Congo (K) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The number of refugees
flowing into Tanzania from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)
has surpassed 2,400 since the outbreak of war in the country on
August 2, a United Nations refugee agency official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Vincent Parker, senior external relations officer of the
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), said in
Dar es Salaam that 379 Congolese refugees arrived in Tanzania
Tuesday and Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Among the new arrivals, 174 were adults and 205 were children,
he said, adding that they came to the Kigoma Region in west
Tanzania by boat from a village called Mboko in DRC's Fizi zone.
</P>
<P>
"The group reported that soldiers had allowed them to cross
into Tanzania," Parker said. "It is therefore expected that more
refugees would arrive from the Fizi zone."
</P>
<P>
The officer said that they have set aside two camps for
refugees, Nyarugusu and Lufugu, which have a total capacity to
accommodate 50,000 refugees.
</P>
<P>
"For the time being we do not have any problems concerning
food, treatment, shelter and water," he said.
</P>
<P>
The refugees crossed Lake Tanganyika by boat into Kigoma after
Tutsi-led rebels took up arms in the east of DRC to topple the
government of President Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, UNHCR officials said the influx of refugees is
manageable, as they are capable of handling even 1,000 new
arrivals a day.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Trade Ties With Neighbors Improving: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Trade Minister Mohammed
Mehdi Saleh said Thursday that Iraq's trade relations with
neighboring states have "progressively developed."
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi News Agency quoted Saleh as saying that many Arab
states have shown willingness to reopen trade centers in Iraq. The
minister made the remarks after attending the inauguration of the
Syrian trade center in Baghdad Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that Iraq and Saudi Arabia, one of its major
rivals, are holding negotiations on exporting Saudi foodstuffs to
Iraq within the framework of the U.N. oil-for-food deal.
</P>
<P>
But Saleh accused the U.S. and Britain of delaying approval of
contracts that Iraq has signed with foreign companies under the
oil-for-food deal.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council imposed sanctions on Iraq after its
invasion of Kuwait in 1990, but it signed the oil-for-food deal
with Iraq in December 1996 to allow it to export 2 billion
U.S. dollars worth of oil every six months to buy food, medicine
and other humanitarian supplies.
</P>
<P>
The ceiling was raised to 5.2 billion U.S. dollars in the fourth
phase, which began on June 3 this year.
</P>
<P>
Saleh noted that the value of contracts Iraq have signed so far
in the fourth phase has exceeded the allocations set aside from
the proceeds of oil sales due to the sagging oil prices.
</P>
<P>
But he said Iraq would commit itself to the implementation of a
decision made by the Arab Economic and Social Unity Council to cut
10 percent of tariffs on Iraqi commodities imported from Arab
countries.
</P>
<P>
He confirmed that Iraq would attend the meeting of the council
to be held in Cairo next week to discuss means of upholding the
decision. It also hopes to use the chance to further enhance its
ties with other Arab countries.

<HEADLINE> Envoy Expected to Discuss Nigerian-Canadian Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Representatives of the Canadian
government are expected in Nigeria next Monday to discuss the
restoration of diplomatic relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
According to reliable sources, David Kilgour, Secretary of
State for Africa and Latin America, is to head the delegation.
</P>
<P>
Canada closed its embassy in Nigeria early last year as its
staff were allegedly unsafe following a spate of bomb blasts in
Nigeria and attacks on the Canadian embassy.
</P>
<P>
In September 1996, Nigeria closed its mission, saying that
Nigeria's economy could no longer sustain the maintenance of a
large number of diplomatic missions and personnel abroad.
</P>
<P>
Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy said on August 24
that his country would move to restore ties with Nigeria and be
offering financial and technical assistance towards successful
implementation of Nigeria's transition program.
</P>
<P>
Axworthy attributed the intention to restore relations with
Nigeria to measures taken by the present government to restore
democracy in the West African country.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's National Party Losing Ground: Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 3 (Xinhua) -- With the 1999 general
election less than a year away, the voter support for the
National Party (NP), South Africa's biggest opposition party, has
dropped below the psychological level of 10 percent, an opinion
poll showed.
</P>
<P>
The party had nine percent support as in July this year, down
from 10 percent in May and 12 percent in last November, Markinor,
a major independent research company in South Africa, said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The NP, the former ruling party in the apartheid era, won 20
percent of the votes in the country's first democratic election
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Markinor's latest survey showed the ruling African National
Congress (ANC) has increased its support to 57 percent in July
from 54 percent in May.
</P>
<P>
The party won 63 percent of the votes in the 1994 election.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Democratic Party, another white-based
opposition party, continued to gain ground, with six percent
support registered in July, up from five percent in May and three
percent in last November.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted by secret ballot among 3,499 people,
showed that undecided voters accounted for 13 percent of the
respondents.
</P>
<P>
Releasing the figures, the organization predicted the
political landscape would not change dramatically over the next
few months.
</P>
<P>
It said the ANC stood to re-affirm its position at around 60
percent in the next election, and the real battle lay between the
larger opposition parties running for the second place.
</P>
<P>
With its support continuing to fall and voters' confidence
shaken, the NP leadership could be expected to resort to "rather
desperate measures", such as a return to the government of
national unity, Markinor said.
</P>
<P>
The NP's popularity has been waning since its former leader F
W de Klerk decided to withdrew from the national government in
1996.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Opposes Unilateral Intervention in DRC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni Thursday told the 12th Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) summit
that Uganda does not accept unilateral military intervention by
individual countries or sectional intervention by groups of
countries in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
He made the announcement when addressing the plenary session
at the NAM summit Thursday morning in Durban, South Africa, a
press release from the President's Office said.
</P>
<P>
NAM has always opposed the presence of foreign troops in
foreign lands, he said, because it always distorts the internal
politics of that country in such a way that the political
questions are not addressed.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, Museveni asserted, if foreign army intervenes in
any country, it should be under the very clear supervision of the
United Nations or of recognized regional bodies.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan president condemned the intervention of foreign
troops on the side of a government which is not elected by
popular mandate and urged the countries in the region to discuss
the deepening crisis in the DRC at appropriate regional fora as
they have already started doing.
</P>
<P>
He confessed that Uganda has had troops in eastern DRC for one
year following an understanding with President Laurent Kabila's
government in order to fight barbaric terrorists operating from
that area since the days of late dictator Sese Seko Mobutu.
</P>
<P>
Museveni proposed that the presence of those troops be
reviewed by mutual discussions especially if alternative
arrangements are made for the security of all affected by the
terrorist activities.
</P>
<P>
He pledged full support for the initiative raised by South
African President Nelson Mandela on seeking a political
resolution to the conflict.
</P>
<P>
Uganda has been accused by Kabila of fomenting the month-long
Tutsi rebellion and of sending troops to support the rebels, a
charge Kampala quickly denied.
</P>
<P>
With the military intervention in the DRC crisis by Zimbabwe,
Angola and Namibia in mid-August, the war began to turn against
the rebels who had advanced to the suburbs of capital Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Uganda said that it would send troops to the DRC if
the conflict there continues to regionalize and its national
security is under threat.

ANKARA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Mesut
Yilmaz is to visit Jordan, Israel and Palestine starting on Sunday
in a bid to play a role in the peace process, Turkish Foreign
Ministry said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said that bilateral relations, regional and
international issues would be discussed during Yilmaz's visit.
</P>
<P>
It added that several agreements would be signed with an aim to
enhance Turkey's cooperation in various fields with the three
sides.
</P>
<P>
During the three-day visit, Yilmaz is expected to meet with
Jordan's Crown Prince Hassan, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and Palestinian National Authority (PNA) President
Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Israel and Jordan have maintained closer ties with Ankara, but
the PNA is critical of the rapid expansion of the Turkish-Israeli
military ties.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Israel began their military cooperation since early
1996 after they signed a deal under which Turkey allowed Israeli
fighter pilots to train in its air space.
</P>
<P>
The past two years witnessed frequent exchanges of visits by
senior military officials between the two countries. The
Turkish-Israeli military cooperation has sparked widespread
protests from the Arab world.

ADDIS ABABA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian government
office spokeswoman Selome Taddesse on Thursday urged the
international community to press the release of 100 Ethiopians
who were taken away last Sunday (August 30) by the Eritrean
police.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here, the office said "691 Ethiopians
have been registered with the Eritrean immigration authorities in
Asmara since June but have been prevented from leaving for
Ethiopia."
</P>
<P>
It said, "about 100 of them had taken to sleeping outside the
Ethiopian embassy but on August 30 at 22:30 at night the police
took them away and they have not been seen since."
</P>
<P>
The office pointed out that "this is the second incident of
its kind," adding that "on August 23, 34 Ethiopians met a similar
fate".
</P>
<P>
The office said, "once again, we urge the international
community to press for their safe release and return of them all
to Ethiopia."
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia announced that the number of displaced Ethiopians
of the border dispute has reached to over 200,000, including
15,000 Ethiopians expelled from Eritrea, while Eritrea said over
17,000 Eritreans have been expelled from Ethiopia since May.

<P>
KAMPALA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni has outlined his country's development at the 12th
summit of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) in Durban, South Africa.
</P>
<P>
A press release from the President's Office said Thursday that
Museveni enumerated the four main objectives of Uganda's
development strategy: the development of human resources through
education for all, the development of infrastructure,
industrialization and development of the service sector as well
as the modernization of agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The president told the summit that Uganda has made modest
gains in the last 12 years. Its gross domestic product (GDP),
industrial and agricultural sectors have grown 6.5, 15 and 6.3
percents per annum respectively.
</P>
<P>
The inflation rate is maintained between three to five percent
while the primary school enrollment has been doubled, he added.
</P>
<P>
The fundamental change has been to accept private sector-led
growth which has moved the east African country away from a
command economy.
</P>
<P>
Judging by Uganda's development, Africa is capable of waking
up, he said, hoping the non-African members of the 113-member NAM
to be fully confident that they have reliable partners in Africa
in their quest for development and progress.
</P>
<P>
The NAM summit, which opened Wednesday, is expected to address
disarmament, development and regional conflicts.

LAGOS, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak has invited Nigerian military leader General Abdulsalam
Abubakar for an official visit to his country, the official News
Agency of Nigeria said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The letter of invitation was delivered to Abubakar Wednesday
in Durban, South, Africa, by Egyptian Foreign Minister Amre
Moussa, where both were attending the on-going 12th summit of the
Non-Aligned Movement.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar accepted the invitation but said a convenient date
would be set for the visit, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar discussed the recent political development in Nigeria
with Moussa, explaining that politicians in the west African
country had been given a free hand to form political parties and
participate in the transition to democratic civil rule process.
</P>
<P>
He also said that as a leading African nation, Nigeria would
make meaningful contributions to the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's international image got a major boost under the
leadership of Abubakar, who succeeded General Sani Abacha about
three months ago following the latter's sudden death of illness.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar, who has promised to hand over to a civilian
president on May 29, 1999, became the first Nigerian leader to

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia announced
Thursday that the second phase of the project on the sustainable
preservation and development of plant resources will be
undertaken in 1998/99 at a cost of 2.1 million U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The manager of the forest resources registration and strategic
planning project under the agriculture ministry, Sultan Tilimo,
told reporters here that the project covers 700,000 square
kilometers, or 62 percent of the total area of the country.
</P>
<P>
Sultan recalled that survey and strategy formulation were
carried out during the first phase of the project between 1991
and 1994 over an area covering 300,000 square kilometers in the
southern people's region, Gambella Region, 80 percent of Oromiya
Region and 30 percent of Benishangul Region.
</P>
<P>
The problem of fuel wood is growing to be critical unless
alternative measures are sought, the manager said, adding that
the project will also devise a strategy for the development of
the agricultural sector which is the mainstay of more than 80
percent of the people in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian government will allocate a total of 6.7 million
U.S. Dollars for the execution of the whole project which is
expected to be completed in 2002, according to Sultan.
</P>
<P>
Forestry coverage rate in Ethiopia is only three percent. The
nation loses 1.9 billion tons of soil to erosion every year.

currently put at 21.1 million is expected to grow to more than 22
million in 2000, a population report has said.
</P>
<P>
According to the state of the world report launched Wednesday

growth rate in Uganda stands at 3 percent.

Radio Uganda reported Thursday evening that the minister has

</P>
<P>
There has been no birth control program in Uganda where
polygamy is widely observed.
</P>
<P>
Families in the countryside tend to be very big although those
in cities are now apt to become smaller due to the heavy burden
of supporting large families.
</P>
<P>
Overpopulation is looming as a potential threat to Uganda's
future economic growth and now the government is encouraging
people to raise their living standards instead of giving birth to
many babies.

</P>
<P>
Cyprus is on the verge of joining the European Union, and with
its advantageous geographic location, it can serve as an ideal
bridge between Israel and the European countries, Tzur said.
</P>
<P>
"Closer commercial ties between our two countries will lead to
larger market access for Cypriot businessmen and in turn give
Israeli companies access to European and Middle East locations,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador expected that the seminar would promote the
understanding between business societies of the two countries,
and give Cypriots insight into the business opportunities and
prospects in Israel.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tzur spoke highly of the forthcoming economic
conference in Jerusalem in October, saying such a gathering would
provide an opportunity for businessmen across the world to expand
trade cooperation with the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus' relations with Israel have been enhanced since it
opened up an embassy in Tel Aviv five years ago and through the
exchange of visits by high-ranking officials.
</P>
<P>
Israeli President Ezer Weizman is due to visit Cyprus before the
end of the year.

<HEADLINE> Latin American Finance Officials Urge Market Calm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Latin American finance
officials urged investors on Thursday to be calm and not stampeded
into a blanket sell-off of all emerging markets by world-wide
market turmoil.
</P>
<P>
The officials from nine Latin American countries, Canada and
the U.S. began a two-day meeting at the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) here to try to calm the stock market across Latin
America.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials worried that the financial turmoil in Russia and
Asia will finally expand to the Latin America, the so-called
backyard of the United States.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters at the headquarters of IMF, Mexican
Finance Minister Jose Angel Gurria complained that markets were
overreacting to world financial problems.
</P>
<P>
"Markets are certainly overreacting and not discriminating at
all between countries that have done their homework and are taking
care of their fiscal positions, taking care to have a flexible,
modern and responsive exchange rate regime," Gurria said.
</P>
<P>
He denied that the meeting was designed to seek IMF funds to
ward off financial troubles. "We have not come to ask for money.
We have not come here to organize a great fund to support Latin
America."
</P>
<P>
"The main purpose of this meeting is to analyse the situation
of world markets and the impact it is having on Latin America and
to send a clear message to the market that they must differentiate
(between economies)," he said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said developments in the
Latin America were "profoundly important" to the United States.
</P>
<P>
"We have felt from the very beginning...that what happens in
Latin America is profoundly important for the United States,"
Rubin said. "For that reason, we have been extremely supportive
of the activities and programs in Latin America that deal with the
issue."
</P>
<P>
Rubin said many Latin American countries were equipped to deal
with the world financial situation.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was attended by finance officials from Argentina,
Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Peru, Uruguay and
Venezuela.

<HEADLINE> Denktash Urges Cyprus to Reconsider Confederation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash warned Thursday of eternal division of Cyprus if the
Cypriot government does not accept his proposal for creating a
confederation in the divided island.
</P>
<P>
"If they (the Greek Cypriots) do not accept confederation, the
two states on the island will go their own way," Denktash said in
a meeting with chief of the security forces of the Turkish
Cypriots Ali Nihat Ozeyranli, Turkey's Anatolia News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
He called on the Cypriot government to reconsider its position
on his proposal, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Denktash proposed on Monday setting up a confederation of
"equal and sovereign states" of the Greek Cypriots and Turkish
Cypriots as way to end the 24-year-old division of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
He called his proposal as "a final effort" to achieve a
"mutually acceptable" and lasting solution to the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government has flatly rejected the proposal,
dismissing it as an attempt to render an independent sovereign
state into two protectorates.
</P>
<P>
But Denktash insisted that his proposal is the "most realistic"
for reviving the negotiations between the two communities.
</P>
<P>
The bi-communal peace process came to a halt in the summer last
year when Denktash walked out of the talks with Cypriot President
Glafcos Clerides to protest the European Union (EU) decision to
start entry negotiations with Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Denktash said he would not return to the negotiations unless
his breakaway Turkish Cypriot regime in northern Cyprus is
internationally recognized and Cyprus stops the entry talks with
the EU.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island after a
failed coup by the Greek Cypriots seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
Only Turkey has recognized the breakaway "Turkish Republic of
Northern Cyprus," which was declared by Turkish Cypriots in 1983
against the internationally acknowledged Republic of
Cyprus. Turkey is now stationing 35,000-strong troops in the
norther allegedly to protect the Turkish Cypriots.

<HEADLINE> Syria, Iraq Working to Restore Diplomatic Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Syria and Iraq are working
toward the restoration of diplomatic ties, Syrian diplomatic
sources said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The sources said Syria reopened its trade center in Baghdad
Thursday and an Iraqi trade center is expected to open soon in
Damascus. The moves were widely seen as the latest sign of
growing ties between the two neighbors after a lapse of 17 years.
</P>
<P>
Syrian Director-General of Free Trade Zones Khalid Raad is in
Iraqi capital Baghdad now to prepare for an exhibition of Syrian
products, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq cut diplomatic relations with Syria in 1981 because of its
support for Iran in the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq war.
</P>
<P>
A thaw in the relations began after Syria sent a trade
delegation to Iraq in May 1997 and visits at ministerial level
have been exchanged.
</P>
<P>
Trade between the two countries has been picking up in the past
two years, during which Syria has exported 250 million
U.S. dollars worth of medicine, clothing and food to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's reopening of the Syrian trade center followed the
August 20 agreement between the two countries to re-start a
pipeline that carries Iraqi crude oil to Syrian Mediterranean ports.
</P>
<P>
The sources noted that officials from Syrian Foreign Ministry
will arrive in Baghdad within days to inspect the premises of the
Syrian embassy which was closed down 17 years ago.

<HEADLINE> Breakaway UNITA Faction Sets Up Renovation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Some members of the opposition
National Union for Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) who broke
up with their leader Jonas Savimbi set up the Committee for UNITA
Renovation here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the breakaway UNITA faction is to give up war,
keep onto the track of the peace process and remove Savimbi.
</P>
<P>
Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos who is attending the
12th Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) summit in Durban, South Africa,
congratulated the UNITA defectors on the establishment of the
Committee for UNITA Renovation, saying that his government will
only engage the committee in the pursuit of a lasting peace in
the southern African country.
</P>
<P>
A group of UNITA members who hold posts in the government, led
by Minister of Hotel and Tourism Jorge Valentim, released a
declaration calling on the patriotic UNITA members to choose the
right way of national reconciliation, to abandon Savimbi's
leadership which insists on fighting and to elect new leaders.
</P>
<P>
The declaration has been echoed in parts of the country. In
northern Uige Province, some UNITA members holding posts in the
provincial government wrote a letter Thursday to Governor
Cananito Alexandre, demonstrating their support for national
unity, the government of reconciliation and democracy.
</P>
<P>
In central Huambo Province, UNITA officials in the provincial
government also dismissed the war policy of Savimbi and declared
severance with him and his leading organ.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan peace process is facing the most serious crisis in
four years because the UNITA did not fully follow the 1994 Lusaka
Peace Accord. The opposition movement refused to disband all of
its troops and turn the cities and towns formerly controlled by
it over to the government.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government Monday decided to suspend the UNITA
members in the national congress and the government of national
unity and reconciliation.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Issues Stamps on Return of Axum Obelisk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian Postal
Service Thursday issued a set of three memorial stamps on the
return of the Axum Obelisk from Italy.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the launching ceremony, Minister of Information
and Culture Woldemechael Chemu said that the governments of
Ethiopia and Italy have been working closely to make sure that
the Axum Obelisk returns to its rightful owner, Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
Final preparations are being made to ensure the safe return
from Italy to Ethiopia of the obelisk, Woldemechael said, adding
that the obelisk will be dismantled, packed and transported to
Ethiopia in a few months time.
</P>
<P>
He said that an international relic study and research center
entrusted with the task of dismantling and shipping the obelisk
back to Ethiopia is making the necessary studies.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian people are ready to warmly welcome their obelisk
back home, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
The Axum Obelisk which now stands in front of the United
Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) headquarters in
Rome, Italy, is one of the three obelisks erected in the ancient
town of Axum of northern Ethiopia centuries ago.
</P>
<P>
The obelisk looted from Axum Town in 1937 by the invading
Italian forces under the direct command of Mussolini is 24 meters
tall and weighs 144 tons.
</P>
<P>
The governments of Ethiopia and Italy reached an agreement for
the return of the Axum Obelisk in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The largest of the three obelisks which has fallen measures 34
meters in length and weighs 520 tons. The other which is 23
meters high is still standing in Axum.
</P>
<P>
The monolithic obelisks are cut out of granite which comes
from a high rocky stretch of land known as Gebedera, five
kilometers away from Axum.

<HEADLINE> 3 Foreigners Killed on S. African Train </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Three foreigners, two
from Senegal and one from Mozambique, were killed on a train near
Pretoria Thursday after a mob accused them of stealing jobs from
South Africans, South African media reported.
</P>
<P>
Two of the victims were electrocuted by overhead wires when
they tried to escape the mob by climbing on to the train roof. A
third man fell or was thrown out of the window and run over by an
oncoming train, South African Press Association (SAPA) said.
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred at 4.30 p.m. (1430 GMT) on a train
traveling from Pretoria to Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
There have been no arrests.
</P>
<P>
"People on the train are reluctant to come forward with
evidence, and the information we have at present is vague,"
police spokesman George Francis was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said two placards were found near the train after the
incident. They read "Down with foreigners, they are taking our
jobs" and "We will take the law into our hands."
</P>
<P>
Pretoria Metrorail spokeswoman Margaret Dingalo said that a
number of people who participated in a protest march to the
offices of the departments of labor and home affairs in Pretoria
earlier in the day to demand job creation were on the train.
</P>
<P>
The marchers were members of an organization called Unemployed
Masses of South Africa, which claims to represent 32,000 jobless
people.
</P>
<P>
Trains on the central line between Pretoria and Johannesburg
came to a standstill during the peak commuter hour while police
removed the bodies.
</P>
<P>
Trains were delayed for 2.5 hours and about 30 trains were
affected, said Dingalo.

<HEADLINE> European Shares Fall Sharply but off Lows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Major European stock markets
closed sharply lower, but off the day's lows after an overnight
fall on Wall Street and a fresh slide as the U.S. market opened on
Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
London's FTSE 100 index ended 117.1 points lower at 5188.7. It
had stood 146.5 points down just a few minutes before trade ended.
The FTSE 250 was 63.2 down at 4648.8, and the FTSE Small-Cap 13.1
lower at 2068.2.
</P>
<P>
The Dow was around 100 points lower as London closed.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, German stocks clambered off their lows, too,
encouraged by Wall Street's rebound from early lows, but remained
very weak on general global bearishness.
</P>
<P>
The electronically-traded Xetra Dax index finished at 4797,
down 151 after Germany's central bank left interest rates steady.
</P>
<P>
A Frankfurt-based trader said that while a retreat was expected
after Wednesday's gains, investors remain concerned in light of
Russia's economic and political tribulations.
</P>
<P>
While the weight of the Russian bear is felt in economies the
world over, it presses heaviest on near-neighbors like Germany,
whose bank sector has borne the brunt of investor concern over its
extensive credit exposure to Russia.
</P>
<P>
In Paris, French stocks were down but off lows with investors
still sidelined and now focused on markets in Latin America. The
leading Cac-40 index closed at 3646, down 83 points.
</P>
<P>
The market took little notice of the Bank of France's
as-expected decision to hold interest rates steady.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, preliminary French gross domestic product expanded
by 0.7 percent in the second quarter and rose 3.0 percent
year-on-year. These increases were in line with expectations.
</P>
<P>
"People are concerned about Latin America" where a crisis is
"inevitable," one trader at a French bank was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The financial crises in Asia and Russian are spilling over to
Latin America where "the economic scenario hasn't cleared up," he
added.
</P>
<P>
As a result, "even the most daring (investors) have chilled,"
the trader noted. But he also said that investors aren't selling
off in panic despite the recent stock-market plunge.

<HEADLINE> U.S., UK Submit Draft Resolution on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The United States and
Britain on Thursday submitted to the Security Council a draft
resolution on Iraq, and the 15-member council is expected to
resume consultations on the matter early next week.
</P>
<P>
The statement came as Hans Pahlgren, president of the Security
Council in September, briefed reporters on the first consultations
held by the Security Council in this month.
</P>
<P>
"That draft resolution is now being considered by delegations
and in capitals, and we will resume consultations on that matter
early next week," said Pahlgren, who assumed office of the
rotating council presidency on September 1.
</P>
<P>
The draft resolution proposed the suspension of periodic
reviews of sanctions against Iraq until Baghdad resumes full
cooperation with U.N. arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council every 60 days reviews the sanctions
imposed on Iraq following its 1990 invasion of Kuwait. The next
review is expected to take place next month.
</P>
<P>
Also on Thursday, chief U.N. inspector Richard Butler told the
Security Council that Iraq had refused three times over the last
month to allow his inspectors to check sites they had visited
previously.
</P>
<P>
West diplomats on Thursday said that the Iraqi stance was
"totally acceptable" in a statement which echoed a U.N. resolution
calling for an Iraqi policy shift to fully work with the U.N.
Special Commission (UNSCOM) over weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
Iraq announced on August 5 to halt its cooperation with the
UNSCOM in a bid to reduce what it called American influence on the
inspection team.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Denies Bomber Order Linked to DPRK Missile Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The Pentagon denied on
Thursday that its "short-notice" order to send six heavy bombers
to Guam this weekend was linked to a new test of missiles by the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).
</P>
<P>
The Joint Chief of Staff sent a short-notice order to the Air
Force late on Wednesday that three batwing B-2 stealth bombers
and three eight-engine B-52s be sent to Andersen Air Force Base,
Guam, from bomber bases in Louisiana and Missouri. The order was
issued just two days after the DPRK's Taepo Dong 1 test missile
passed over Japan.
</P>
<P>
The defense officials said the mission was simply another in
a series of air power projection exercises and not meant as a
warning to Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
"It was not prompted by the North Korea missile test," one of
the officials said.
</P>
<P>
"They were not directly connected" with the DPRK's test of
the new missile, another official said. "But if people take
inferences that America can respond quickly with all of its
assets anywhere in the world, then so be it."
</P>
<P>
All the six planes, which will be refueled in the air during
non-stop flights to Guam, are capable of dropping bombs and
launching cruise missiles. They will likely take part in weapons
exercises at a range in the Northern Marianas Islands, the
officials said.

<HEADLINE> BT Launches New Digital Internet Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 3 (Xinhua) -- British Telecom Thursday
launched its new BT Highway mass market digital communication
service, which is designed to allow people to surf the Internet at
high speed and use the telephone simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
The service, to begin from September 15, will transform a
customer's existing telephone line into a new fast and
multi-functional digital Internet and multimedia connection, the
company said.
</P>
<P>
BT Highway offers customer choices of using combinations of
analogue or digital connections over a single telephone line,
which means families or small businesses could surf the Internet
or send e-mails and make calls at the same time.
</P>
<P>
Currently, users with a single analogue telephone line have to
disconnect from the Internet when they are using the phone.
</P>
<P>
The new service will operate at a minimum speed of 64 kilobits
per second, or a maximum of 128 kilobits per second, much faster
than the fastest modems working on ordinary telephone lines.
</P>
<P>
"BT Highway is a major step towards mass digitalisation of the
UK." Afshin Mohebbi, Managing Director of BT's Business Division,
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Though Internet growth has been phenomenal, only 1.8 million UK
households are connected. BT hopes that its new service will help
bridge the gap.
</P>
<P>
"Our aim is to connect the majority of UK households with the
latest high-quality, high-capacity digital communications by the
year 2003." the company said.
</P>
<P>
At the moment ten percent of all telephone usage in the UK is
for data, but BT expects data to become the most important aspect
of the network some time before 2003.

<HEADLINE> FBI Chief Expects More Charges against Bombing Suspects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The chief of the U.S.
Federal Bureau of Investigation said on Thursday that additional
charges may be brought against suspects in the bombing of U.S.
embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
"We have a number of other individuals in various countries
who we are interested in speaking to ad may result in additional
charges," FBI Director Louis Freeh told a Senate panel about
investigation of last month's twin bombings.
</P>
<P>
He also praised cooperation of the governments of Kenya and
Tanzania, saying it was "outstanding".
</P>
<P>
Last week, two suspects -- Mahamed Rashed Daoud al-'Owhali
and Mahamed Sadik Odeh -- were brought to New York from Kenya
for trial.
</P>
<P>
They were accused of linkage with Osama bin Laden, the exiled
Saudi multimillionaire, who was alleged to have masterminded the
bombings in Kenya and Tanzania, killing more than 260 people,
including 12 Americans, and injuring well over 5,000.
</P>
<P>
Freeh told the Senate Judiciary Committee that there
certainly would be reprisals for the arrest of the two suspects
and for U.S. cruise missile attacks on "terrorist-related"
targets in Sudan and Afghanistan, allegedly linked to bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
"I think we can predict with some certainty that we will see
a reaction," he said. Some loosely organized groups such as bin
Laden's "may pose the most urgent threat" because they are
difficult to infiltrate and track, he added.
</P>
<P>
The FBI has warned U.S. corporations with overseas offices to
be on the alert for possible terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
Freeh said he will be asking Congress for funds to buy
airplanes that would enable agents to reach any place in the
world in 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
Domestically, the FBI estimated there are 25-30 groups
operating that the government considers to be terrorist
organizations.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 3 (Xinhua) -- At least one person was
killed and 12 others injured Thursday evening when Lesotho police
opened fire on a crowd of protesters outside the royal palace in
Maseru, South African Press Association (SAPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
SAPA quoted an unnamed diplomatic source as saying that police
opened fire on about 500 people at about 5 p.m. (1500 GMT) after
shots were fired from the crowd.
</P>
<P>
The source could not confirm reports that the shooting
involved soldiers and police firing at each other.
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the three main opposition parties have camped
outside King Letsie III's palace since August 4 to protest the
results of the May 23 general election.
</P>
<P>
They claim that the results were rigged in favor of the ruling
Lesotho Congress for Democracy which won 79 of 80 seats in the
National Assembly.

<HEADLINE> Kohl and His Rival in Pre-Election Duel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 3 (Xinhua) -- German Chanceller Helmut Kohl and
his election contender Gerhard Schroeder Thursday engaged in their
only face-to-face debate before the September general elections,
both portraying themselves as the right choice to lead Germany
into the next century.
</P>
<P>
With the German national elections just 24 days away, Kohl's
centre-right ruling coalition and the main opposition Social
Democratic Party (SPD) on Thursday made the last session of the
current German parliament into a battle field to vie for voters'
support.
</P>
<P>
In his hour-long speech to the parliament, Kohl drew a positive
balance of his 16-year leadership and described his
conservatives-led ruling coalition as the security anchor for
Germany in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Brushing aside attacks on his failure to cut Germany's
record-high unemployment, Kohl stressed that reforms conducted by
his government had brought about not only a recovery in the
economy, but also a trend reversal on the job market.
</P>
<P>
He also attacked Schroeder as being ambiguous in his policies.
"The country needs sound and solid policies, not experiments,"
Kohl said.
</P>
<P>
In reply, Schroeder described Kohl as "a chancellor of
unemployment" and a worn-out politician who lost his grasp of
Germany's current social problems after 16 years in power.
</P>
<P>
"Your record is modest, therefore Germany cannot afford another
four years of Kohl," Schroeder said.
</P>
<P>
Stressing his party's faith in Germany's social welfare system,
Schroeder also vowed to conduct his own reforms to combine
modernity with more social justice.
</P>
<P>
With the election day approaching, Kohl is still trailing
Schroeder by three to six percentage points in opinion polls,
though the gap has been narrowed when compared with earlier this
year.
</P>
<P>
Betting his chances on many voters who have not made up their
mind, Kohl has stressed the election would be decided only in the
final weeks.

<HEADLINE> ADB Finances Drinking Water Project for Nepali Towns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank
(ADB) has agreed to grant a technical assistance of 600,000 U.S.
dollars to help the Nepali government design a small town water
supply and sanitation project for possible ADB financing, the bank
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The assistance aims to establish a water-supply and sanitation
sector plan and five-year investment programs for small towns in
Nepal and reach general agreement among the stakeholders on the
implementation and financing arrangements for the project, the
bank said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
It also aims at preparing feasibility studies and preliminary
designs for sample sub-projects and assisting the Department of
Water Supply and Sewerage in implementing drinking water quality
and sanitation standards, it said.
</P>
<P>
The technical assistance project is expected to start in
January 1999 and be completed in September 1999, it said.
</P>
<P>
The bank has been the lead development institution for rural
water supply and sanitation development in Nepal.
</P>
<P>
Since 1985, it has provided four concessional loans and seven
technical assistance grants totaling more than 65 million dollars
for rural water supply and sanitation development in the country,
the bank said.
</P>
<P>
"Small towns have emerged over the years along the major
national highways in the country which have not yet been covered
by any program in the water supply and sanitation sector," it
noted.
</P>
<P>
"The technical assistance is an initiative to address the water
supply and sanitation needs of the population living in these
emerging towns, which will help improve their health profile and
foster economic growth and social development in these
communities," it added.
</P>
<P>
Lack of safe drinking water is a big problem facing Nepal, in
particular the rural areas.

<HEADLINE> DPRK Statement on Successful Launch of Satellite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) Thursday stood up for its
"internationally recognized right" of owing an artificial
satellite.
</P>
<P>
It criticized "hostile forces" for spreading "rumors" about the
alleged missile firing.
</P>
<P>
A Foreign Ministry spokesman said in a statement that the
satellite launch is DPRK's "one more fruit" of independent economy
and "a 100-percent product of Korean technology and efforts."
</P>
<P>
It gives pride and delight to the Korean nation and its
friends, it added.
</P>
<P>
However, it said, some people around the DPRK are "making a
fuss" about the satellite and remain ignorant of this "valuable
success of science and technology which will add to the common
treasure house of humanity."
</P>
<P>
Those people suspect it to be a ballistic missile
test-launching, express "apprehensions" and describe it as a
"serious event." Their rash behavior reminds one of the saying
"once bitten, twice shy," he said.
</P>
<P>
Some people in the United States talk as if the DPRK satellite
launching has made it difficult for them to fulfill their
obligation under the DPRK-U.S. framework agreement, and try to
link this matter with food assistance which they described as a
purely humanitarian issue, it said.
</P>
<P>
The statement described Japan's behavior as "more intolerable."
It said the Japanese authorities, although having no information
on what happened, blindly accepted rumors about the ballistic
missile test-launching in the DPRK and threatened to bring the
issue to the U.N. Security Council and take "countermeasures."
</P>
<P>
The statement pointed out that before announcing that it would
"put off" negotiations for normalization of diplomatic ties, Japan
must not forget that it is the DPRK's right to demand apologies
and compensation for its past crimes.
</P>
<P>
Saying the launch and use of an artificial satellite is in line
with the trend of developing modern science and technology, the
satement said the DPRK has never criticized the United States and
Japan for having launched artificial satellites, though it is well
aware that the satellites have been used for espionage on it.

<HEADLINE> India Concerned Over WHO Fund Cut for Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW Delhi, September 4 (Xinhua) -- India is concerned over a
proposed cut in World Health Organization (WHO) funds for the
South East Asia region, the Press Trust of India (PTI) reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The real issue is not the amount of money that has been
reduced, but the basis on which cuts have been proposed for the
countries in the South East Asia regioin, which are facing severe
health problems, PTI quoted health officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
In the case of India, which receives 15 million U.S. dollars
each year from WHO, the funds have been slashed by 9.75 percent,
or some 1.5 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
PTI said the funds are being diverted to Africa and East Europe
and Indian officials are worried that this diversion reflected a
lack of understanding of the disease burden of the region.
</P>
<P>
The officials said some countries have expressed their concern
over the issue to India which is to host the 16th conference of
health ministers of the region.
</P>
<P>
These countries hoped that the issue be discussed with WHO
Director General Bro Harlem Brundtlandt who is scheduled to arrive
in New Delhi Friday night to address the conference as well as the
51st session of the WHO regional committee for the South East Asia
region in the coming week.

<HEADLINE> Kazakhstan Banks Rush to Buy Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Kazakhstan banks have set off
a panic dollar-buying spree Friday despite the announcement by the
government that the Russian financial crisis put limited influence
on the country.
</P>
<P>
The agitation was caused by the worry over the future of
Russia's financial crisis and inflation, the RanoRana newspaper
said.
</P>
<P>
Although the National Bank, the only seller in the foreign
exchange market, has raised the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar
to local currency Tenge, the demand for dollar is experiencing
continuous increase.
</P>
<P>
In the past week, the daily volume of foreign exchange
transaction far exceeded the average level, with the highest
reaching 14.495 million dollars. The Tenge to dollar rate fell by
20 percentage points, floating at the high level of 78.50 to 79.91
to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
On the whole, the future of the Kazakhstan monetary market will
be decided by the development of outside situation, economists
here said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Unemployment Rate Remains at 4.5 percent in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. unemployment rate
remained steady at 4.5 percent in August, the Labor Department
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
August's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was the same as
in June and July when about 150,000 workers in the General Motors
factories were either on strike or laid off.
</P>
<P>
Although most of the strike-idle workers returned to work in
August, the unemployment rate did not recover to the 4.3 percent
of April and May, the lowest since 1970.
</P>
<P>
Net job growth across all sectors in August was 365,000,
compared to a gain of 68,000 jobs in July.
</P>
<P>
But the gain of 95,000 manufacturing jobs in August would have
actually been a loss of 55,000 without the return of workers after
GM settled its labor disputes on July 25.
</P>
<P>
Clothing and other textile manufacturing jobs dropped by 18,000
in August. Employment in the manufacturing of electronic equipment
components cut 6,000 jobs, and food and related products
manufacturing lost 4,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
Construction employment, however, was up again in August, by
another 16,000 jobs, in part reflecting a boom in home sales.
Since October, the construction industry has added 261,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
Also growing in August was employment in the service sector,
which jumped by 135,000 jobs. Temporary-help services led the
gain, adding 42,000 jobs. Computer and data-processing services
jobs were up by 11,000.
</P>
<P>
Transportation and public utilities added 24,000 jobs in
August, with about 12,000 of those coming in trucking and
warehousing.
</P>
<P>
Retail employment, including at bars and restaurants was little
changed in August.
</P>
<P>
Employment grew by 13,000 jobs in finance, insurance and real
estate, but that was a substantially smaller rise than monthly
average gains of 23,000 during the previous 12 months.
</P>
<P>
Government employment, boosted by teachers returning to work,
was up by 57,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
Although U.S. economic growth slowed down from a robust 5.5
percent annual rate during the first quarter of this year to a 1.6
percent rate from April through June, the impact on U.S. jobs has
been minimal.
</P>
<P>
In August, average hourly wages grew by 7 cents to 12.86
dollars, a faster pace than the 3-cent increases recorded in each
of the previous three months. The average work week of 34.6 hours
was unchanged in August.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Shuttlers March to Asian Badminton Finals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese shuttlers edged
their ways to all five finals in the 136,000 US dollars JVC Asian
Badminton Championships after winning their semi-finals
respectively here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Ye Zhaoyin luckily entered the women's singles' final after
Dai Yun, another Chinese player quit the semi-final because of
illness.
</P>
<P>
Ye will vie for the title against Gong Zhichao, also Chinese,
who won over her teammate Gong Ruina in the semi-final.
</P>
<P>
Chen Gang of China ousted his compatriot Luo Yigang and will
meet Marleve Mainaky of Indonesia to vie for the men's singles
title after Mainaky upstaged another Idonesian player Taufik
Hidayat in another semi-final.
</P>
<P>
The men's double semi-final match pitted Chinese Zhang Jun and
Zhang Wei against Indonesia Flandy Limpele and Eng Hian for a
fierce battle which the Chinese duo won eventually 17-15, 9-15
and 15-12.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Jun and Zhang Wei will compete, in the final match of
men's double, against South Korean Kang Kyung Jin and Ha Tae Kwon
who crushed Indonesian Tony Gunawan and Halim Heryanto for
another final berth.
</P>
<P>
Ge Fei and Gu Jun edged Indonesian Elysa and Deyana Lomban in
the women's doubles semi-final, while their teammates Qing Yiyuan
and Tang Hetian overpowered South Korean Yimkyung Jin and Chung
Jae Hee.
</P>
<P>
Chinese coach Li Yongbo told Xinhua that up to now he was
generally satisfied with the performance of the Chinese players
who he said had given full play to their skills in the tournament.
</P>
<P>
But Li said top Chinese shuttler Sun Jun's defeat to
Indonesian Marleve Mainaky showed that Sun lacked "systematic and
scientific training".
</P>
<P>
Marleve, ranking 15th in the world, eliminated Sun, winner of
this year's All-England, from the men's signle semi-final on
Thursday.

HANOI, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Both Thailand and Indonesia
were each fined on Friday 40,000 US dollars for their fake match
in the Tiger Cup soccer tournament earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN Football Federation, the regional body governing
football in South East Asia, imposed the fine after Indonesia
deliberately lost 3-2 to Thailand with a last-minute own goal on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Both teams were planning to appeal the decision while the
ASEAN will be looking at the rules of the competition to ensure
there is no repeat of the farcical scenes.
</P>
<P>
Thailand won the game in Ho Chi Minh City when an Indonesian
defender scored a deliberate own goal in injury time for his side
to finish second in Group A.
</P>
<P>
Neither team wanted to win the group in order not to play the
hosts in the semifinal by travelling from Ho Chi Minh City to
Hanoi.
</P>
<P>
However, neither team entered the final eventually as
Singapore defeated Indonesia 2-1 in the first semifinal while
Vietnam beat Thailand 3-0.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Confident of N. Irish Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said on Friday in Dublin he was confident about the prospects for
peace in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
He made the statement at a press briefing following a meeting
with Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern in the Dublin Castle on the
second day of his visit to Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic.
</P>
<P>
Clinton hinted that he expected Northern Irish Protestant
leader David Trimble and his arch political rival, Sinn Fein
President Gerry Adams, to break another long-standing taboo next
week by meeting face to face for the first time.
</P>
<P>
"The statements in the last few days by Gerry Adams and Mr
Trimble's response make me quite hopeful about next week, and then
after that we'll just have to see where we go from there," BBC
quoted Clinton as saying.
</P>
<P>
He added that he hoped his current visit, the second in less
than three years, would help maintain the momentum for peace in
Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. president also said the Irish peace could set an
example for warring peoples in the Middle East and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
"The potential impact of resolving this could wash over many
more people than live on this island," he said.
</P>
<P>
At the joint press briefing, Ahern paid tribute to Clinton for
his efforts in pushing forward peace process in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
"What the president's visit has done is that it has got the
parties to move, on what might have taken weeks and months, over a
very short period," the Irish prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton will visit an American computer company near Dublin
airport in the afternoon. On Saturday he intends to fulfil another
pledge made on that visit -- to play a round of golf at
Ballybunion before heading back to Washington.

<HEADLINE> Plan Launched to Revitalize Angola's Rural </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- A plan has been mapped out in
Angola to revitalize the war-torn rural economy from 1998 to
2000.
</P>
<P>
The plan, which was forwarded by the Angolan Agricultur and
Rural Development Ministry, is to achieve its goal by heavily
investing in rural economy.
</P>
<P>
According to the "Symposium on Current Situation and Future of
Angolan Economy", which is being held here, the plan involves a
rural loan system by the government, the construction of
agricultural infrastructure with irrigation system as the major
works and the strengthening of supply system of means of
production.
</P>
<P>
To encourage home and foreign investors, especially private
financial institutions to invest in agriculture, the new loan
system would allow those who want to borrow money to use their
farming land as mortgage.
</P>
<P>
A preferential two-year loan with a rate of less than 7.5
percent would be guaranteed according to the plan.
</P>
<P>
The government would give priority in building irrigation
projects in provinces like Luand, Bengo and Benguela.
</P>
<P>
It would also promote the breeding of farm cattle and develop
local industry making farm tools for the household and
labor-intensive economy.
</P>
<P>
The introduction of foreign investment and the restoration of
traditional export-oriented coffee and sugar-cane planting would
be encouraged, according to the plan.
</P>
<P>
Angola used to be a big farm country, ranking third in coffee
export in the world, with self-sufficient grain production. But
long years of civil war has rendered in a lot of land abandoned
and farmers fleeding as refugees.
</P>
<P>
The country needs about 470,000 tons of grain from outside in
1998.

<HEADLINE> DPRK Successfully Launches First Artificial Satellite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) sent its first artificial satellite into
orbit on August 31, transmitting revolutionary songs back to the
Earth, the Korean Central News Agency reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
A three-stage rocket carrying the satellite blasted off in the
direction of 86 degrees at a launching station in the Musudan-ri
village, Hwadae County, North Hamgyong Province at about 12
a.m. local time (0300 GMT).
</P>
<P>
The satellite went into orbit four minutes 53 seconds later.
</P>
<P>
The first stage of the rocket was separated 95 seconds after
lift-off and fell on the open waters of the Sea of Japan.
</P>
<P>
The splash spot is 253 kilometers off the eastern coast of
DPRK, at 40 degrees 51 minutes north latitude and 139 degrees 40
minutes east longitude.
</P>
<P>
The second stage opened the capsule in 144 seconds, separated
itself from the rocket in 266 seconds. It fell on the open waters
of the Pacific Ocean 1,646 kilometers off the launching site, at
40 degrees 13 minutes north latitude and 149 degrees 7 minutes
east longitude.
</P>
<P>
The third stage put the satellite into orbit 27 seconds after
the separation of the second stage.
</P>
<P>
The satellite is flying along an oval orbit 218.82 kilometers
in the nearest distance from the Earth and 6,978.2 kilometers in
the farthest distance. Its period is 165 minutes 6 seconds.
</P>
<P>
The satellite reportedly carries with it sounding equipment,
with an aim to promoting scientific research for peaceful use of
outer space.
</P>
<P>
The report said that it is also instrumental in confirming the
calculation basis for launching practical satellites in the future.
</P>
<P>
The satellite is now transmitting revolutionary hymns "Song of
General Kim Il Sung" and "Song of General Kim Jong Il" and the
Morse signals "Juche Korea" in 27 Mhz.
</P>
<P>
The satellite and the rocket were 100 percent made by DPRK
scientists and technicians, the report said.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: China Eyes Deficit Policy on Economic Growth (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government today
issued the first round of 10-year treasury bonds totaling 100
billion yuan in a bid to support infrastructure construction.
</P>
<P>
Finance officials and noted economists agree that the
measure will promote a new round of investment and will have a
positive impact on the nation's economic growth.
</P>
<P>
"The bonds and an equal volume of bank loans as supporting
projects funds will contribute more than two percentage points to
this year's GDP growth," according to Finance Minister Xiang
Huaicheng.
</P>
<P>
The 50 billion yuan in bonds set for issue as part of this
year's state budget will raise the financial deficit from the
original 46 billion yuan to 96 billion yuan. The figure will
considerably exceeding debt and deficit ceilings ratified during
the first session of the Ninth National People's Congress,
according to Xiang.
</P>
<P>
Prominent economists contend that current deflationary
conditions, combined with increased net withdrawals of cash money
from circulation, and the serious deficiency in capital for
construction projects make it necessary for the government to
engage in deficit spending in order to increase inputs for
infrastructure projects.
</P>
<P>
China's economic growth rate for the first half of 1998 stood at
only seven percent due to the negative impact of the Asian
financial crisis in the first half of 1998. The six-month figure
was substantially lower than the projects target set earlier this
year.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government thus decided to invest heavily in
infrastructure projects to stimulate the economy. As a result, a
five-fold investment growth was registered for water conservancy
projects, with a corresponding 2.8-fold rise for urban
construction and a 17.5-fold increase for grain reserve storage
projects.
</P>
<P>
Yang Qixian, deputy director of the Chinese Society for
Research on Restructuring the Economic System, noted that
investments will be the major contributor to annual targets due to
sluggish exports and domestic consumption.
</P>
<P>
"The treasury bond issue will create at least two million
additional job opportunities, and large investments in
infrastructure projects will improve working and living conditions
for Chinese citizens." said Yang.

The Agricultural Bank of China (ABC) and the Construction Bank
of China (CBC) have each purchased bonds valued at 20 billion
yuan. The latter plans to provide additional funds totalling 29
billion yuan for post and telecommunications, power generation and
urban construction projects.
</P>
<P>
ABC Vice-President Li Dianjun said that pumping funds raised
from the bond issue into infrastructure construction will help
reduce loan risks and improve the overall operations of commercial
banks.
</P>
<P>
Xiang discounted the possibility that the bond issue will spark
a new round of inflation. He pointed out that the volume of
currency in circulation is under control, the nation enjoys a
negative inflation rate and, in addition, there is ample room to
fulfill the loan quota set by the central bank.
</P>
<P>
Officials and economists are also bullish on the government's
ability to retire debt, and they share the view that the 100
billion yuan will occupy only a small proportion of China's debt
in this decade.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the overall efficiency of the national economy
will rise over the next three years in line with the anticipated
successful reform of state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
China also plans to establish a debt repayment fund, according
to Xiang.

<HEADLINE> Vote on Chernomyrdin' Nomination Postponed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The Russian State Duma decided
on Friday to postpone the second round of vote on Viktor
Chernomyrdin's nomination as prime minister to next Monday.
</P>
<P>
The postponement was made at a request of the Russian president.
</P>
<P>
The State Duma, or lower house of parliament, took the
decision with 294 votes for, 51 against and three abstaining.
</P>
<P>
Speaker of the State Duma Gennady Seleznyov had a
conversation with President Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
The president suggested to hold a roundtable meeting of leaders
of the Duma factions and deputy groups, as well as members of the
Federation Council on Monday morning, and then hold the debate on
premier's nomination later in the day.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin also suggested that a roundtable be held among
representatives of Duma groups, the Federation Council and
political parties to discuss appointment of the new premier.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party faction in the Duma agreed to take part in
the roundtable meeting to see if the president will offer
something new, according to Chairman of the Communist Party
Gennady Zyuganov.
</P>
<P>
The left-wing opposition in the State Duma, said Zyuganov, will
reject Chernomyrdin on the second ballot, and has not believed and
does not believe any promises from the president.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Communist Party agreed to hold consultations
with Yeltsin only because the situation in the country is
"extremely tense."
</P>
<P>
The report said that the Federation Council, or upper house of
parliament, Friday passed a resolution in favor of Chernomyrdin's
appointment as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Before the Duma session, Yeltsin had a meeting with
Chernomyrdin in the Kremlin to hear the results of visit by the
acting prime minister to the Federation Council.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin on Friday made a report on social-political
situation in the country at a meeting of the Federation Council,
where he asked the deputies to support him and give its consent to
urgent actions of the government.
</P>
<P>
He is confident that he will be supported by most governors
and be approved by deputies of the Duma.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin was named by the Russian president as prime
minister on August 24 after the government led by Kiriyenko was
sacked and his nomination was rejected by a majority of the Duma
deputies at the first ballot on Monday.

<TEXT>
<P>
JI'NAN, CHINA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Top two seeds Kong
Linghui and Liu Guoliang advanced to the third round of the
Chinese Table Tennis Grand Prix while their fellow Chinese Wang
Chen and Yang Ying, seeded second and third respectively, were
eliniminated in their openers here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Kong, ranked third in the world, had little trouble in the
first set, beating Poland 's L. Blaszczyk 21-13.
</P>
<P>
But Blazczyk, who set up the clash with the 1995 world
champion after beating qualifier K. Nakamura of Japan earlier,
fought back in the second when Kong made a lot of errors, winning
21-16.
</P>
<P>
Kong, who won the Australia Open last week, regained his
rhythm again and overwhelmed the Polish in the last two sets
21-14, 21-11 with his solid defence and strong topspin attack.
</P>
<P>
Olympic champion Liu held off fierce challenge from
chopper-plus-attacker Syed Matthew of England in the first two
sets before advancing to the third round with a 21-15, 21-15,
21-13 straight victory.
</P>
<P>
World No.5 Liu, well known for his wickedly deceptive service,
was forced into many errors by the patient Matthew. Liu had to
match the unknown English Paddler stroke for stroke and the two
sides exchanged lead time and again in the beginning of the first
two sets.
</P>
<P>
Matthew, a winner over qualifer N. Tsiokas of Greece in the
first round, faded in the last set before the powerful smash of
his Chinese oppenent, a beaten semifinalist in the Australia Open.
</P>
<P>
Wang and Yang, ranked fourth and sixth respectively in the
world , became the day's two biggest casualties, with Wang losing
to K. Okazaki 19-21, 24-22, 21-16, 19-21, 16-21, and Yang to Song
Ah Sim 17-21, 21-14, 21-14, 17-21, 15-21 in the women's second
round competition.

<P>
TOKYO, September 4 (Xinhua) -- South Korea edged China 1-0 on
a sole goal by centre forward Shim Eui-Sik in the opener of the
Asian Cup ice hockey tournament on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The goal came 15:25 into the third period as Chinese keeper
Geng Hua fell on the ice after saving a Korean onslaught when
Shim fired home a Kim Chang-Bun pass from close range in front of
the goal.
</P>
<P>
It was a sweet revenge for the Koreans, who lost to China 0-6
when they played each other last time at the World Championships
Pool C match in March.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese showed better formation and passing play, while
the Koreans retaliated with power play, but both sides fell short
of shooting accuracy in the first two periods.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese team is always stronger and better than us and we
rarely defeated them. Today, we tried to beat them mentally and
physically. We were able to stop their rhythm," said Korean head
coach Kim Sea-Il.
</P>
<P>
Chinese coach Wang Jin-Gang said: "This is only our second
game since we started practicing together three weeks ago and my
players were a bit nervous in the first period. Our keeper did
his job very well giving only one goal."
</P>
<P>
China will face Japan on Saturday at the Higashi Fushimi Ice
Arena in the three-nation event.
</P>
<P>
The winners will take a berth in the World Championships Pool
A, while the other two teams will play in Pool C.

<HEADLINE> HIV Carriers Must Tell Partners: Canadian Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The Supreme Court of Canada has
ruled that people carrying the AIDS virus must tell their partners
about it.
</P>
<P>
The top court, calling such behavior dangerous and deplorable,
said HIV carriers who have sex with unwitting partners can be
found guilty of assault.
</P>
<P>
The court made the ground-breaking ruling Thursday in ordering
a new trial for Henry Cuerrier of British Columbia Provice, an
HIV-positive man acquitted of aggravated assault after having sex
with two women unaware of his illness.
</P>
<P>
"In this case the complainants were exposed to a significant
risk of serious harm to their health," Justice Peter Cory wrote
for a majority of the court.
</P>
<P>
"Indeed, the potentially fatal consequences are far more
invidious and graver than many other actions prohibited by the
Criminal Code. The risks of infection are so devastating that
there is a real and urgent need to provide a measure of protection
for those in the position of the complainants," said Justice Cory.
</P>
<P>
Henry Cuerrier tested positive for the virus in August
1992. But he continued to have unprotected sex without telling
partners he was HIV-positive, even after a public health officer
ordered him to use condoms and inform lovers of his illness.

<HEADLINE> SES Announces Halt of CLOB Malaysian Share Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, September 4 (Xinhua) --The Stock Exchange of
Singapore (SES) Friday announced that trading of Malaysian stocks
on Singapore's over-the-counter market known as CLOB will cease.
</P>
<P>
In a press statement, SES said that after extensive
consultation with the industry, the SES has concluded that it will
no longer be viable for it to provide Singapore investors with the
facility to trade Malaysian shares on CLOB.
</P>
<P>
The SES also set forth an arrangement under which trading of
Malaysian shares on CLOB will resume for one week from a date to
be determined and thereafter trading of Malaysian stocks will
cease.
</P>
<P>
The SES statement came after Malaysia announced measures to
curb capital outflows and placed a ban on overseas transactions in
its currency and stocks.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian Central Depository announced new measures to
regulate the trading of Malaysian shares on August 31. This was
followed by Bank Negara Malaysia's announcement of foreign
exchange controls on September 1, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Singapore and Malaysia have been disputing over the trading of
Malaysian shares on CLOB. Malaysia holds that CLOB has been
detrimental to Malaysia because it has facilitated the short
selling of Malaysian shares and taken away business from brokers
of the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange. But Singapore argued that the
existence of CLOB has benefited Malaysian shares as CLOB has
increased Singapore investor interest in these shares and provided
liquidity and price support to them.
</P>
<P>
The SES said it will continue to develop new Singapore and
Asian products so as to provide investors with a wide range of
investment alternatives and strengthen its position in Asian
capital market.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Pak Economy Beset With Difficulty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's economy, beset
with difficulties, is getting worse because of an acute shortage
of revenue due to economic sanctions imposed on it by some
countries after its May nuclear tests and the poor export
performance.
</P>
<P>
Despite assurances by the government of an early improvement in
the economy, this South Asian nation's financial picture is
getting murkier along with the larger economic scene.
</P>
<P>
The most conspicuous feature of this negative development is
the ever increasing borrowing from domestic commercial banks by
the central and provincial governments.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that the government has raised a total of
 30.47 billion rupees (46 rupees equal one U.S. dollar) through
bank borrowing or printing of money in the first five weeks of the
1998-99 fiscal year beginning July 1.
</P>
<P>
The budget ceiling for the government's bank borrowing in the
current fiscal year is 12 billion rupees and the total bank credit
for the fiscal year is 56 billion rupees.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the four provincial governments are reported to
have borrowed 9.37 billion rupees from the state bank as the
central government does not have enough funds to release to them.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, borrowing from commercial banks by the private
sector in the same period stood at 32.8 billion rupees, indicating
reduced industrial and commercial activities which would result in
lower tax revenues, reduced exports and shrinking employment
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan, with its economy largely dependent on foreign
assistance, can not afford a lower economic growth, particularly a
lower industrial growth. Yet such low borrowing by the private
sector also means financial losses to banks.
</P>
<P>
Official revenues have fallen sharply because of lower tax
payments and poor performance of the export sector. Imports in
July dropped by almost 50 percent, leading to declines in customs
revenues and sales tax.
</P>
<P>
With an unfavorable balance of payments position in years,
Pakistan has long been looking toward the export arena to boost
its incomes.
</P>
<P>
Export, as the pulse of any economy, plays a crucial role in
Pakistan's gross domestic product. However, for many years,
Pakistan's export growth has been sluggish and very little money
has entered the country in terms of foreign exchange to finance
its heavy debt of 30.7 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
In the 1997-98 fiscal year, Pakistan's growth rate of export
was only 2.61 percent against the targeted 15 percent. And this
growth was registered mainly due to an increase in the exports of
rice and raw cotton.
</P>
<P>
During last fiscal year, manufactured goods declined by a
significant margin and textile export which makes up 65 percent of
the country's total exports went down from 81 percent to 78
percent.
</P>
<P>
Over the years, Pakistani exporters have faced problems abroad
but this year a number of elements have brought endless
frustration to the exporters and seriously affected exports.
</P>
<P>
The worsening law and order situation in the commercial city of
Karachi, the growing number of strikes and power supply
disruptions affected the industrial units in Karachi, causing
billions of dollars in losses.
</P>
<P>
Local economists believe that to achieve a favorable economic
growth rate and balance of payments position, it is of great
importance to develop the export industry. For this end, long-term
planning is crucial at this point.

<HEADLINE> hke090454 - Flood Situation May Aggravate Further in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The overall flood situation in
Bangladesh is likely to aggravate further Friday with rise of
water levels in three major river basins due to the active monsoon
and impact of full moon, the official BSS news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The flood situation along the Brahmaputra-Jamuna and districts
along the Padma River may deteriorate further, the Flood
Forecasting and Warning Center (FFWC) was quoted as saying in its

</P>
<P>
The situation in the downstream of the Meghna basin from
Bhairab Bazar and in the central part of the country as well as
around the capital city of Dhaka is expected to worsen further,
the FFWC cautioned.
</P>
<P>
The FFWC, however, stated that the flood situation in the upper
part of the Meghna basin may continue to improve.
</P>
<P>
The on-going devastating flood, which has lasted for nearly two
months and hit about 60 percent of the country's area, has so far
affected more than 21.5 million people in 45 of the country's 64
districts, with the death toll rising to 451, according to the
latest figures issued by the Ministry of Relief and Disaster
management.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the flood has also damaged more than 227,000 hectares
of crops, more than 377,000 houses, 9,347 kilometers of roads,
4,121 kilometers of embankments, 4,652 bridges and culverts and

<HEADLINE> Chinese Media Addresses Sexual Harassment (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chen Kuizun, member of the National People's Congress (NPC)
Standing Committee, recently proposed attaching related amendments
to appropriate laws.
</P>
<P>
When the NPC deliberated the draft Law on Doctors in June, Chen
suggested that individuals guilty of sexual harassment should be
subject to punishment clearly defined by law.
</P>
<P>
Consultation and complaint records have accounted for a mere
one percent of calls to a Beijing hot line for women established
some six years ago, according to Wang Xingjuan, director of the
Beijing Institute of Women. Wang made the comment in a letter to
the Nanfang Weekend Newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Many women complain they have no place to turn when seeking
redress for harassment cases.
</P>
<P>
Statistics for 1996 show that over half of sexual harassment
cases involved the work place, with 36 percent of the total
involving high-level male officials and an additional 14 percent
attributed to male colleagues.
</P>
<P>
The majority cases involved single women under the age of
30. Fifty percent of victims reported inappropriate physical
advances and a number of women claimed they were forced to have
sex with male colleagues.
</P>
<P>
"Males bent on harassment most often entice female subordinates
with higher wages or promotions, and in some cases threaten fire
women or otherwise smear their reputations," according to Wang.
</P>
<P>
The rising number of complaints obviously indicates the urgent
need for legislation, said Wang.
</P>
<P>
"Sexual harassment is a serious subject," according to Chen,
who also serves as vice chairman of the Jiangxi People's Congress
Standing Committee. Chen's remark was carried in report released
by Jiangxi Daily.
</P>
<P>
No precedent exists for China to attach sexual harassment
articles to existing laws. However, the legislature has the option
to introduce new regulations and stipulate punishment in special
laws and to formulate a separate law at a later date.

<HEADLINE> Tung Promises to Take Care of Elderly in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Chief Executive Tung Chee
Hwa of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) said
Friday that the SAR government will continue its efforts to
promote the elderly health services.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the launching ceremony of the Elderly Health
Services of the Department of Health, Tung said the government
shall work even harder to further honor the pledges of "caring for
the elderly" put forward by him in the Policy Address delivered
last year.
</P>
<P>
"To achieve our goal of providing a feeling of health and
worthiness, we must ensure that the elderly are physically and
mentally healthy," Tung said.
</P>
<P>
With rapid socio-economic development, growing sophistication
in medical technology and continuous improvement in environmental
hygiene, the life expectancy in Hong Kong is increasing.
</P>
<P>
At present, the number of people aged 65 and above exceeds
600,000 and accounts for about 10 percent of the total
population. It is forecast that the population of the elderly in
the SAR will reach 840,000 in 10 years' time.
</P>
<P>
"The new Elderly Health Services are hence launched by the
Department of Health with the aim of fulfilling our policy
objective of caring for the elderly," the chief executive said.
</P>
<P>
Seven elderly health centers have been set up and 7 elderly
health visiting teams have started reaching out for the elderly
since July 2 this year.
</P>
<P>
Tung said that in the coming 19 months, the government will set
up 11 additional elderly health centers and 11 additional elderly
health visiting teams so that each of the 18 districts within the
SAR shall have its own center and visiting team.
</P>
<P>
Professionals like doctors, nurses, dietitians, occupational
therapists, physiotherapists and clinical psychologists are
working together at each center to look after the various needs of
the elderly.
</P>
<P>
The elderly health visiting teams help to promote the concept
and awareness of health care among the elderly living in the
community and at homes for the aged, and offer more assistance to
the family of the elderly.
</P>
<P>
"I am glad to know that the membership of the 7 elderly health
centers, which started operation in July, has now reached 70
percent of the expected size," Tung said.
</P>
<P>
It proves that the elderly health services are generally
welcomed by the elderly, he added.
</P>
<P>
It is encouraging to note that within a short period of time,
the Department of Health is able to provide such well-received
services, which cater for the needs of the elderly.
</P>
<P>
"I have confidence that with the concerted effort and full
cooperation of all parties concerned, the elderly of Hong Kong
will lead a healthier, richer and more meaningful life," Tung
concluded.

</P>
<P>
The benchmark Straits Times Index (STI) lost 7.56 points to

concerns over their Malaysian exposure.

<P>
The total turnover declined to 117.75 million units valued at

Gainers outnumbered losers by 126 to 87 with 373 counters
unchanged.

<P>
SingTel remained the most active stock of the day with a volume
of 10.14 million stocks traded. It was followed by OCBC F that had
6.47 million units done. EnerSave was next with 5.77 million
counters changing hands.
</P>
<P>
Asean was the top gainer of the day as it gained 90 cents to
close at 3.90 U.S. dollars. Creative 50 went up by 30 cents to
close at 17.10 Singapore Dollars. ICB inched up 23 cents to end at

ban on equity trading overseas remained strong.

The suspension of Malaysian shares on Singapore's
over-the-counter market known as CLOB thinned volumes since the
actively traded stocks account for some 40 per cent of the l
volume, they said.

withdrawal from the West Bank, Arafat said: "Actually they
(Israelis) are saying so, but the gaps are still very wide."
</P>
<P>
During a visit to Northern Ireland Thursday, U.S. President
Bill Clinton announced he was sending Ross back to the
Middle East next week to help the sides to advance the stalled
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources here said that Ross is expected to arrive in
the region on next Tuesday, or Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Ross' return was called for by both the Israelis and
Palestinians, who have failed to clinch a deal over the long
overdue redeployment since they resumed direct talks on July 19.
</P>
<P>
The outstanding obstacle blocking an agreement was believed to
be the dispute over the scope of the pullback.
</P>
<P>
While the Palestinian side has already accepted the
U.S. initiative on a 13.1 percent pullback, Israel first rejected
the scope citing security concerns, then demanded that 3 percent
of the proposed territories be turned into natural reserves to
restrict the Palestinian control.
</P>
<P>
Still, Arafat has rejected the Israeli compromise, ruling out
further Palestinian compromise on the U.S. initiative since it is
already a compromise in the view of the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Optimism surfaced in the past week for a breakthrough as media
reports disclosed that Israeli and Palestinian officials continued
secret negotiations on clinching a deal and made significant
progress.
</P>
<P>
A senior Palestinian official was quoted by Israel Radio as
saying Friday that a draft agreement had been reached in
principle, but internal disputes among Palestinian officials have
prevented it from being finalized.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that senior Palestinian officials, including
Arafat's deputy Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen) and senior Palestinian
negotiator Saeb Erekat, have expressed their objection to the
draft agreement.
</P>
<P>
The same Palestinian official said 10 secret meetings were
held in the past two weeks between the two sides, three of which
held between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Abu
Ala, speaker of the Palestinian Legislative Council.
</P>
<P>
The other meetings were held between Abu Ala and Netanyahu's
confidant and attorney Yitzhak Molcho, some of which were attended
by Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, a dove in the
government.
</P>
<P>
In return for its agreement to accept the 13 percent
withdrawal, Israel wants to obtain the Palestinian promise to
crack tougher down on Islamic militants and revise the clauses in
the Palestinian Covenant calling for Israeli destruction.
</P>
<P>
David Bar-Illan, media adviser to Netanyahu, has said that
a deal would be possible if the Palestinians were prepared to
meet their security commitments.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Closes on Positive Note </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar shot
above the 59 U.S. cent level for the first time in two weeks
Friday, buoyed from stronger commodity prices and Australia's
recent better than expected growth.
</P>
<P>
The local currency gained more than three U.S. cents over the
week to close trading Friday at 59.06 U.S. cents from 55.99 U.S.
cents last Friday and 58.36 U.S. cents in Sydney Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The rebound in the domestic unit from its new record post-float
low of 55.30 U.S. cents, recorded on August 28, was assisted by
higher commodity prices, traders said.
</P>
<P>
Treasurer Peter Costello also released figures this week
showing that the economy grew by 3.9 percent in the fiscal year of
1997-1998 ending on June 30, 1998, exceeding the budget forecast
of 3.75 percent.
</P>
<P>
On the cross rates, the Australian dollar was at 79.74 Japanese
yen from 79.63 yen and was buying 1.0237 German marks from 1.0161
marks.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The Australian sharemarket
closed lower Friday as investors swapped from industrial stocks to
oversold resource stocks.
</P>
<P>
The sharemarket would have fallen even further if not for a
slight strengthening of the Australian dollar, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark all ordinaries index dropped 9.3 points to
2,504.0 after trading within a range of 2,490.6 and 2,521.0 during
the day.
</P>
<P>
"The rise in the dollar cushioned our market from falling the
amount it usually would have with a 100 point drop on Wall
Street," Macquarie Equities client adviser Rob Graham said.
</P>
<P>
The volatile Australian dollar pushed up through the key level
of 59.00 U.S. cents for the first time in two weeks Friday to
close at 59.06 U.S. cents from 58.38 U.S. cents Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The all industrials index tumbled 34.4 points to 4,408.2, while
the all resources index firmed 14.3 to 966.4.
</P>
<P>
Resource stocks were also buoyed Friday by generally stronger
metals prices overnight with resources giant BHP climbing 13.6
cents to almost 12.87 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
Anglo-Australian mining giant Rio Tinto went against the trend,
sliding 4.2 cents to 17.70 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
Gold stocks were stronger almost across the board, with the
gold index soaring 51.7 to 933.2 points on the back of a surge in
the price of the precious metal.
</P>
<P>
The spot price of gold bullion in Sydney closed Friday at
285.55 U.S. dollars an ounce, a big leap from Thursday's 278.65
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Two of the major bank stocks took a battering, with National
Australia Bank sliding 55 cents to 20.95 Australian dollars and
Westpac bank shedding 24 cents to 9.00 Australian dollars, both
helping drag the bank index 67.1 points lower to 5,419.9.
</P>
<P>
ANZ bank gained three cents to 8.55 Australian dollars and
Commonwealth Bank of Australia firmed 8.4 cents to just over 19.33
Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
National turnover was 260.85 million stocks traded for 862.03
million Australian dollars (509.11 million U.S. dollars), with
rising stocks outnumbering falling stocks 539 to 472 and 371
stocks remaining steady.

KATHMANDU, September 4 (Xinhua) -- An earthquake measuring 5.6
on the Richter scale Thursday night hit Solukhumbu district, about
160 kilometers east of Kathmandu, the official RSS news agency
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The epicenter was in the neighborhood of Mt. Chamlang in the
north-east of the district, RSS said.
</P>
<P>
The tremor was felt in the capital city as well.
</P>
<P>
A Home Ministry spokesman told Xinhua that the ministry

<P>
Several minor earthquakes have struck the Himalayan kingdom
this year.
</P>
<P>
Both local and international seismic experts had predicted a
considerably large-scale earthquake in the near future in the
Kathmandu Valley, which lies in the seismic belt.

<HEADLINE> China Warned to Mind Post-Waldner Era </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By Sportswriter Wang Zijiang
</P>
<P>
JI'NAN, CHINA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Once all-time great
Jan-ove Waldner retired, a powerful table tennis empire Sweden
would vanish from the world. Then table tennis will be the
monopoly of China, the Scandinavian nation's traditional rival.
</P>
<P>
Many Chinese fans hope it comes true.
</P>
<P>
But it's impossible, warned Kiell-Ake Waldner, Jan-Ove's
brother and coach of the national women's team.
</P>
<P>
The 34-year-old Kiell-Ake, two years older than Jan-Ove, said
they have enough young hopeful players and Sweden never lacks
table tennis talents.
</P>
<P>
"In Sweden, there are more than 1,000 table tennis clubs. More
than 10,000 players often take part in big tournaments. All of
them want to play in international arena, not just for fun," said
Kiell-Ake, who was competing in the ongoing Chinese Grand Prix
here with his players.
</P>
<P>
Considering the fact that Sweden has only a population of nine
million, it's an impressive figure.
</P>
<P>
The coach said that Sweden has a long tradition of playing
table tennis, it will remain a force to reckon with even after
his brother retired.
</P>
<P>
"In 1971 when Stellan Bengtsson, another great paddler in
Sweden's history retired, many people also thought the Sweden
will never win the world champion again. But Waldner made it,"
said Kiell-Ake, who took over the national team last year.
</P>
<P>
In the past decade, Sweden won three successive team titles in
1989, 1991 and 1993. But besides Jan-Ove, Peter Karlsson and
Jorgen Persson, there is no sign to show they have young talents
to help maintain Sweden's status as a table tennis powerhouse in
the post-Waldner era.
</P>
<P>
"It is because the three veterans are still in good form,"
Kiel-Ake said. "The young players haven't many chances to compete
in big international tournaments. But if they retired, the young
will get mature very soon."
</P>
<P>
He said that it will not take a long time before a young Swede
emerges to become a new world champion as long as he is confident.
</P>
<P>
"My brother said to himself when he was very young that he can
do better than Bengtsson. And now he has become the most
successful player," he said.
</P>
<P>
Jan-Ove Waldner, the world's only male paddler who won a grand
slam of the world championships, Olympics and World Cup titles,
did not enter the Grand Prix because of a "tough schedule".
</P>
<P>
The current world champion, a second-round loser to world NO.
40 Peter Franz of Germany in last week's Austalia Open, skipped
the event to prepare for the European Masters Championships next
week, Kiell-Ake said.
</P>
<P>
Jan-Ove took part in the Chinese Grand Prix in 1992 and 1995,
only to be defeated by Chinese young players on both occasions.
But his brother denied his withdrawal this time was to avoid a
third humiliation by the host players.
</P>
<P>
"He was very, very tough mentally," the older brother said.
"It doesn't matter where he plays."
</P>
<P>
So far, the coach said, Waldner has not thought of retiring
from the sport that he began to play at the age of six.
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps when he feels he can not win a world champion or when
he has not strong motivation, he will call it quit." the brother
said.

<HEADLINE> EU Proposes Fuel-Economy Labelling for New Cars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission
required on Friday European Union member states to provide
consumers with fuel-economy information about new cars.
</P>
<P>
The proposed requirement, designed as an integral part of the
15-nation union's strategy to reduce carbon dioxide emissions,
aims at making fuel-economy information available to consumers in
four ways.
</P>
<P>
The commission, the executive body of the European Union,
required that a label should be attached to all cars at the point
of sale; a fuel-economy guide must be available free of charge on
new car market; a poster containing the fuel efficiency and carbon
dioxide emissions information should be available at the dealers',
and official fuel consumption information should be included in
promotional literature.
</P>
<P>
European Environment Commissioner Ritt Bjerregaard said that
the aim of the commission's proposed requirement is to provide
potential purchasers of new passenger cars with the relevant
information on fuel consumption so as to influence their choice
toward more fuel efficient models.
</P>
<P>
Consumer choices are based on factors such as lifestyle and
personal needs but many consumers might be unaware of the
significant variation in fuel consumption between similar cars and
even between cars in the same model range.
</P>
<P>
Carbon dioxide emissions from passenger cars now account for
half of all carbon dioxide emissions from the transport sector and
approximately 12 percent of carbon dioxide emissions from all
sources in the European Union, according to EU statistics.
</P>
<P>
Carbon dioxide emissions from the transport sector are expected
to continue to increase between now and the year 2010 and the
increase could undermine the European Union's commitments made at
the 1997 Kyoto World Environment Conference, commission officials.
</P>
<P>
The commission has set out 120 grams of carbon dioxide emission
per kilometer run by passenger cars as the benchmark for 2005 for
the new car fleet.
</P>
<P>
The commission has also decided to conclude an environmental
agreement with the European Automobile Manufacturers Association
as a further contribution toward achieving the objective of carbon
dioxide emissions.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Media Addresses Sexual Harassment (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The Tuesday edition of a
popular Beijing-based newspaper carried a special report advising
female employs to avoid "coquettish behavior in the office, dress
appropriately, fulfill all job requirements and refrain from
discussing personal affairs with male colleagues."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, delegates to the ongoing Eighth National Congress of
Chinese Women have actively engaged in heated discussions
concerning sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
"Sexual harassment issues have surfaced throughout history and
have increasing concern in recent years." according to the Beijing
Youth Daily which has carried two in-depth commentaries on related
topics over the past month.
</P>
<P>
Women have gained an increasing awareness about male colleagues
sometimes making indecent and insulting remarks.
</P>
<P>
A number of other influential newspapers have also exhibited
great interest in the subject.
</P>
<P>
"Sexual harassment cases represent only the tip of the iceberg
in modern China," according to one south china newspaper, which
also addressed the possibility of related legislation.
</P>
<P>
On July 22, Shanghai Oriental Television carried a live talk
show featuring well-known legal scholars, attorneys and women
rights advocates. The panel called for the enactment of sexual
harassment legislation at the earliest possible date.
</P>
<P>
The Guizhou City Newspaper, a popular publication in
southwestern Guizhou Province, published a lengthy commentary
detailing sexual harassment in the entertainment field.
</P>
<P>
The report claimed that sexual harassment is common in the
field. However, the report played down the severity of related
acts and noted that the law fails to stipulate punishment for
related conduct.

<HEADLINE> Northeast China Province Guards Against Hemorrhagic Fever </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The Health Department of
northeast China's Heilongjiang Province has issued an emergency
circular requiring the flooded areas to guard against an epidemic
of hemorrhagic fever.
</P>
<P>
According to a Ministry of Health official, hemorrhagic fever
is spread among mice and enters the human body through agents such
as mites.
</P>
<P>
The mice population in the flood-stricken areas has risen
sharply, and the chance of contact with mice has been greatly
increased, so many regions in the province face the danger of an
outbreak of this disease, the health official said.
</P>
<P>
Experts say men in their prime are most likely to contract
hemorrhagic fever, a very complicated condition with a high
fatality rate. There is no effective treatment for this disease.
</P>
<P>
The circular asks that great attention be paid to the
prevention and control of the disease. Health departments are
expected to make scientific reports on the disease situation and
offer suggestions to local governments.
</P>
<P>
It is also required that the mice be wiped out, and
vaccinations offered to people in susceptible regions.

<HEADLINE> 330,000 Industrial Workers Laid Off in Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Some 330,000 workers of the
Thai industrial sector were laid off between January 1997 and July
this year, the Labor Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The number will reach 400,000 at the end of this year as the
economic slump continues, the ministry said in a report available
Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, 20,000 to 30,000 employees of the
industrial sector will lose jobs each month, so the number of
laid-off industrial workers since last year will rocket to 400,000
by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
The report said a total of 165,845 workers were sacked last
year and about 170,000 others lost jobs between January and July
this year.
</P>
<P>
Out of all 17 industries, the automobile, property development
and construction, cleaning and security service, and electronics
industries ranked tops in terms of the number of laid-off workers.
</P>
<P>
The manufacturing and export industries are facing problems of
unskilled labor, liquidity, high import tariffs and slow tax
refund process, as well as lack of overseas markets, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the laid-off industrial workers, Thailand has
about 1.7 million other unemployed people in other sectors. The
total number is expected to jump to 3 million next year as the
economic crisis worsens.

<HEADLINE> Australian Car Sales Dip in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- August proved a tougher month
for sales of new cars and trucks in Australia but retailers would
still be smiling at the underlying strength in the vehicle market.
</P>
<P>
In its latest sales bulletin, the Federal Chamber of Automotive
Industries (FCAI) said Friday 64,965 new vehicles were sold last
month, down 8.5 percent from 71,040 in July.
</P>
<P>
But the result was still up 15.7 percent on the 56,123 sold in
August last year and put demand over the first eight months of
1998 up 16.1 percent to 535,585 units.
</P>
<P>
The market's performance also seemed to go against suggestions
the continuing Asian crisis, concerns over the introduction of
taxation changes and fears of interest rate rises might force a
significant downturn.
</P>
<P>
Some slowdown was highly likely in the remaining months but
most industry analysts and car companies were still tipping a
total market for the year of about 780,000, a record result and up
about 60,000 units on 1997.
</P>
<P>
The FCAI said it believed total sales would reach 790,000 units
with all sectors except sports cars showing an improvement this
year.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea to Merge Two Ailing Guarantee Insurance Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean government
Friday announced its decision to merge the country's two ailing
guarantee insurance companies as a further step to clean up the
insurance sector.
</P>
<P>
The Financial Supervisory Commission said it has required the
two insurers -- Korea Guarantee Insurance Co. and Hankuk Fidelity
Surety Co. -- to submit revised restructuring programs outlining
the merger timetable and management replacement, staff and outlet
cuts by next Friday.
</P>
<P>
For the merger, the government will buy the two insurers'
deferred bonds up to 1.6 trillion won (1.2 billion U.S. dollars)
with public funds.
</P>
<P>
The merger is expected to be realized in December this year as
employees must be informed of layoff at least two months in
advance.
</P>
<P>
The two companies are now coordinating their restructuring
plans before submitting a final report to the commission.
</P>
<P>
The commission in charge of financial reforms, which has shut
down 14 merchant banks, five commercial banks and four insurance
companies since the country started suffering the current
financial crisis late last year, is expected to restructure
securities houses, leasing firms and other non-banking
institutions.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Women Need More Psychological Care </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Delegates attending the
ongoing Women's Conference here agreed that more psychological
care should be given to laid-off women since unemployment has been
having a negative affect on women's status in society and the
family.
</P>
<P>
Tan Lin, a scholar with the Tianjin Nankai University, said
unemployment has put great pressure on women, and in some families
has even led to violence against women and children.
</P>
<P>
"Men have become more hot-tempered than before, even though
their wives volunteer to do all the household chores." said Qu
Sufen, vice-chairwoman of the women's federation in east China's
Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
A survey in east China's Fujian Province revealed that 23.3
percent of the 120,000 women laid-off there thought their position
in the family had been lowered. At the same time, quarrels between
couples have increased and the divorce rate has risen.
</P>
<P>
Chinese women are most greatly affected during the transition
period, as they represent a considerable proportion of the work

</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, among the 5.77 million registered
laid-off and unemployed workers in China, 52.7 percent were female.
</P>
<P>
"Women feel upset and discouraged when they became unemployed.
The middle-aged especially have a sense of terror about job
hunting and fell great competition if they lack skills," said a
delegate from Tianjin, a major port city in north China.
</P>
<P>
Delegates say they hope the government, organizations and
enterprises can create more jobs for women, provide necessary
psychological counselling, and help them and their families adopt
a positive attitude towards temporary unemployment.

<HEADLINE> N. Irish Peace "Falling into Place:" Canadian General </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian general in charge
of Northern Ireland's decommissioning process, Jean de Chastelain,
said on Friday he believed the peace process "is slowly falling
into place."
</P>
<P>
General Jean de Chastelain, speaking a day after U.S. President
Bill Clinton's visit to the province, said, "I think there is
going to be decommissioning."
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Irish News that was published on
Friday, Chastelain said Clinton's trip and the two moves by Sinn
Fein, the Irish Republican Army's political wing, have helped
boost the peace process in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Clinton paid a one-day visit to Northern Ireland on Thursday
and delivered a keynote speech in Belfast, urging people there to
show their courage and reconciliation in the path to peace.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein has recently announced it is time to consign violence
to the history books and appointed a senior party figure to liaise
with the international commission set up to disarm guerrilla
groups.
</P>
<P>
"So far all of the things required in this process and which
people thought might never happen are in fact falling into place
and I think decommissioning is one of them," the disarmament chief
said.
</P>
<P>
Under the Northern Ireland peace accord reached last April by
the province's political parties, May 22, 2000, is the final date
for handing in all weapons.

<HEADLINE> Worldwide Depression Unlikely: German Central Bank Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 4 (Xinhua) -- German central bank president
Hans Tietmeyer has said that he did not expect the financial
crises in Russia and Asia to trigger a global recession, German
media reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to financial journalists Thursday evening in
Frankfurt, Tietmeyer said that despite all the challenges, the
euro zone had retained a "relatively high degree of stability" with
sustained growth clearly under way.
</P>
<P>
Growth in the United States was also continuing despite the
economic problems in other regions, Tietmeyer added.
</P>
<P>
The central bank chief also did not view the big losses on
international stock markets as a crisis symptom, but rather a
signal for corrections of the high rides earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
"I see no worldwide depression in sight at the moment,"
Tietmeyer said.
</P>
<P>
A leading German economic research institute, however, said
Friday that the Russian crisis could trim the German economic
growth this year by about 0.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Lutz Hoffmann, president of the Berlin-based German Institute
for Economic Research DIW, predicted that the German economy was
likely to grow only by 2.0 percent this year instead of 2.5
percent expected earlier.
</P>
<P>
He also feared that the Russian crisis would effect other
countries in eastern Europe and hold the danger to trigger a
worldwide economic crisis.

BEIJING, September 4, (Xinhua) -- Zubin Mehta, one of the
world's most renouned conductors, will conduct Verdi's Requiem
Mass at the Great Hall of the People on September 13 as part of a
concert titled "The World Becomes One Family." The proceeds from
the concert will all be donated to Chinese flood victims.
</P>
<P>
Zubin Mehta came to China to conduct the opera "Turandot,"
whose heroine is an ancient Chinese princess. Because of the
severe flooding in China this summer, Mr Mehta decided to also
hold this benefit performance as an expression of concern for the
victims and respect for the flood-fighting heroes.
</P>
<P>
According to China's Ministry of Culture, Ministry of Civil
Affairs and the People's Daily, this will be the first benefit
performance by foreign artists since China's floods began in June.
</P>
<P>
This Bombay-born maestro paid his first visit to China in 1992,
and also attended the performance of "1996 Chinese Symphonic Year"
with the Vienna Philharmonic, and today said he will personally
donate 20,000 U.S. dollars and call for more personal donations.
</P>
<P>
The cast of "Turandot" will attend the Great Hall performance
which will also include four world-renouned solo singers from the
Metropolitan, Chicago, and Florence Maggio opera houses.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Bans Ads for 100 Days in Office </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has
barred the newly-appointed ministers from celebrating their one
hundred days in office through paid advertisements on mass media
in a bid to cut expenditures, press reports here said Friday.
</P>
<P>
In a circular announcing the order in capital Abuja Thursday,
Alhaji Gidado Idris, Secretary to the Federal Government,
requested all ministers, heads of parastatals and government
agencies to take note of this directive and comply with it
accordingly.
</P>
<P>
Over the years, celebration of 100 days in office by ministers
had always been a media celebration as several organizations buy
newspaper pages and air times in the electronic media to
congratulate those involved.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the Office of the Head of State had been
inundated with piles of requests for approval to incur
expenditure on congratulating the Commander-in-Chief on the
occasion of his administration's first 100 days in office.
</P>
<P>
The whole idea was turned down by the government in accordance
with the recommendation of the Program Implementation and
Monitoring Committee, saying it was "too expensive for government
to embark upon at this material time."
</P>
<P>
In the past, several millions of Naira (local currency) had
been lost by the government in such celebrations.

<HEADLINE> Uganda's External Debt Hits 3.6 Billion Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- With the rapid development of
its economy, Uganda's external debt burden has hit 3.6 billion
U.S. Dollars, a report by Uganda Debt Network (UDN) has said.
</P>
<P>
The majority of the debt is owed to the International Monetary
Fund and the World Bank which insist on servicing the debt
annually, Friday's New Vision daily quoted the report as saying.
</P>
<P>
It says Uganda pays over 140 million Dollars in debt service
each year and each citizen in the country owes more than 180
Dollars to international creditors.
</P>
<P>
UDN has spearheaded the campaign for the international
financial institutions to write off the Uganda debt together with
other Sub-Sahara countries to boost their economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The economies in this region are so depressed and impoverished
that only when they begin to develop can they provide big markets
for the developed economies, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's annual growth rate of Gross Domestic Product has
stood at 6.5 percent over the recent years with more
liberalization of its economy, one of the few success stories on
the African continent which is mostly associated with
backwardness.

JOHANNESBURG, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Lesotho police and
soldiers were engaged in heavy shooting Friday outside King
Letsie III's palace in Maseru as hundreds of people made their
way to work, South African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
Along Maseru's main street, Kingsway, vehicles turned back as
intense bursts from machine-guns were heard at about 7.30 a.m.,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said a policeman was seriously injured in the
shooting, and windows at an office block near the palace were
shattered by bullets.
</P>
<P>
Soldiers guarding the palace gate allegedly fired at a group
of police as they tried to remove a land rover outside the palace
gate, where it had been parked since Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
It was earlier reported that one person was killed and more
than 10 others were injured Thursday when police and soldiers
clashed outside the palace.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's shooting started at about 5 p.m. and continued for
about three hours. It sent a crowd of about 500 people, who were
protesting against the results of Lesotho's May election outside
the palace, cowering for cover behind the palace wall.
</P>
<P>
It appeared that soldiers guarding the palace fired on police
after they opened fire on the protesters, and they opened the
gates of the palace to let the crowd in to escape the gunfire,
some reports said.
</P>
<P>
There has been no official report on the incident from the
police.
</P>
<P>
Lesotho has been volatile since August 4 when the country's
opposition parties staged protests against the ruling Lesotho
Congress for Democracy's landslide victory in the May polls.
Opposition parties claimed the polls were rigged.

MANILA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' year-on-year

<P>
DURBAN, South Africa, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The "Durban
Declaration for the New Millennium", issued at the end of the
12th Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) summit, reiterates that the
principles laid down by the founders of NAM remain valid.
</P>
<P>
It also reaffirmed that the ideas and goals articulated then,
continue to guide the Movement.

resulted in adverse social and economic consequences, which add
to the burdens of everyday life in much of the South.
</P>
<P>
"While globalization holds out the promise of prosperity, it
brings with it severe challenges for the devloping countries,
the declaration added.
</P>
<P>
It called on the NAM countries to take up the challenge to
transform international relations, so as to eradicate aggression,
racism, the use of force, unilateral coercive measures and unfair
economic practices in order to achieve a world of peace, justice
and dignity for all.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Bans Ads for 100 Days in Office </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has
barred the newly-appointed ministers from celebrating tnSIz\5R+FW$YX $Z7 office
through paid advertisements on mass media
in a bid to cut expenditures, press reports here said Friday.
</P>
<P>
In a circular announcing the order in capital Abuja Thursday,
Alhaji Gidado Idris, Secretary to the Federal Government,
requested all ministers, heads of parastatals and government
agencies to take note of this directive and comply with it
accordingly.
</P>
<P>
Over the years, celebration of 100 days in office by ministers
had always been a media celebration as several organizations buy
newspaper pages and air times in the electronic media to
congratulate those involved.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the Office of the Head of State had been
inundated with piles of requests for approval to incur
expenditure on congratulating the Commander-in-Chief on the
occasion of his administration's first 100 days in office.
</P>
<P>
The whole idea was turned down by the government in accordance
with the recommendation of the Program Implementation and
Monitoring Committee, saying it was "too expensive for government
to embark upon at this material time."
</P>
<P>
In the past, several millions of Naira (local currency) had
been lost by the government in such celebrations.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Hunger and disease have killed
at least 100 people, mostly children, over the past two weeks in
rebel-held Kailahun district of Sierra Leone, health officials in
the eastern part of the country said.
</P>
<P>
A report reaching here Friday quoted authorities in Kenema,
240 kilometers east of Freetown, capital of Sierra Leone, as
saying that the deaths from starvation and diarrhoea disease
occurred in the Kailahun district which is a bastion of the
country's rebels.
</P>
<P>
Dominic Ngomsu, an official in the area, said, "it would not
be surprising to learn that children are dying every day in
Kailahun" due to lack of foods and medicines.
</P>
<P>
A non-governmental organization, Christian Relief Services,
has sent foods and medicines into the rebel-held areas in the
country, but aid workers are fearful of setting foot there
because of insecurity.
</P>
<P>
In Sierra Leone, President Ahmad Kabbah returned to power last
March after the west African peace-keeping force ECOMOG ousted a
junta, but renegade soldiers are still creating havoc in
up-country parts of Sierra Leone.

<HEADLINE> Australian Wool Prices Tumble to Four-year Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Australia's wool prices
plunged to a four-year low at this week's sales following the
Australian government's failure to freeze sales of the wool
stockpile during this year.
</P>
<P>
The eastern market indicator slid 26 cents to close at 537
Australian cents a kilogram clean.
</P>
<P>
Exporters attributed the fall to subdued demand.
</P>
<P>
The government tried to freeze the sales last month in a bid to
support weak wool prices but it failed to get the approval
required by law to implement the ban from the parliament since it
was dissolved on August 30 for an October 3 election.
</P>
<P>
But wool broker Wesfarmers Dalgety said resumed sales from the
1.1 million bale stockpile played a role, although to a lesser
degree than the large amount of wool on offer and continuing
subdued world demand for raw wool.
</P>
<P>
About 18 percent of the 89,000 bales of raw wool on offer were
passed in while state-owned Wool International Company sold 9,094
of the 16,000 bales.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Council of Wool Exporters (ACWE) weekly market
review said it remained difficult to predict when a lasting
recovery in demand would happen, due to continued global economic
turbulence.
</P>
<P>
The review said relatively good competition for coarser micron
wool, coupled with continuing interest from China, provided some
encouragement for next week's sales in Sydney and Adelaide where
61,000 bales would be offered.
</P>
<P>
Wesfarmers Dalgety's weekly wool report said increasing
supplies of spring shorn wool would soon enter the market.
</P>
<P>
But it said next week's smaller offering should help support
the market.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Trade Union Threatens to Intensify Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Israeli General Trade Union,
or Histadrut, has threatened to intensify a general strike if the
government continues to reject its demand for a significant wage
hike, Israel Radio reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
After the talks between the Histadrut and the Fiance Ministry
ended in failure Thursday night, Histadrut Chairman Amir Peretz
said he decided to suspend the strike for the weekend to ease the
suffering of the public.
</P>
<P>
But he warned that if the scheduled talks with the Finance
Ministry on Saturday fails again, the strike would continue on
Sunday morning in a full scale.
</P>
<P>
The Histadrut launched the general strike on Thursday in
protest against the low wages of the workers employed in the
public sector.
</P>
<P>
The strike kept 300,000 workers away from their jobs and left
the country in a virtual standstill as all government offices,
post offices, railways, ports and public hospitals were closed.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Federation of Chambers of Commerce estimated that the
strike costs the economy 25 to 30 million shekels (about 6.5 to
7.9 million U.S. dollars) per day.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry had agreed to only 1.25 percent wage hike
for the public sector workers, while the Histadrut is demanding a
8 percent rise.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
began his official visit to the Irish Republic on Friday by
holding talks with Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern.
</P>
<P>
Clinton arrived in the republic Thursday evening after ending
his one-day trip to Northern Ireland where he toured provincial
capital Belfast and western town Omagh, a place of last month's
blast that killed 28 people.
</P>
<P>
During Friday's talks, Clinton and Ahern were expected to
discuss the peace process, including security measures approved in
London and Dublin which the countries' leaders have described as
"draconian."
</P>
<P>
This is Clinton's second trip to both Ireland and Northern
Ireland and it had not been expected to match the excitement of
late 1995 when thousands of people turned out to see the president
who had made ending the "troubles" in the north a focus of his
foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
Clinton and Ahern planned to attend a reception together
with several hundred people from Ireland's government, business,
trade union and farming communities.
</P>
<P>
Later on Friday, Clinton was expected to visit the European
center of U.S. computer company Gateway 2000 on the outskirts of
Dublin.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Clinton will visit the western city of Limerick
and then get in his game of golf before heading back to
Washington.

JOHANNESBURG, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Cuban President Fidel
Castro began a two-day state visit Friday to South Africa after
attending the 12th summit of the Non-Aligned Movement in Durban.
</P>
<P>
South African President Nelson Mandela described Castro as one

Mandela's office in Cape Town, Tuynhuys, South African Press
Association (SAPA) reported.

Strict security measures were enforced by police around
parliament, and a group of members of the South African Communist
Party and Congress of South African Trade Unions stood at the
main gates of the complex with banners welcoming Castro.
</P>
<P>
Castro was scheduled to address a joint sitting of parliament
Friday.
</P>
<P>
South African political parties traded fire in the National
Assembly only hours before Castro's address were expected to
begin.

Traditionally white-based opposition parties demonized the
Cuban leader while the ruling African National Congress welcomed
the visit.

<HEADLINE> New Anti-terror Bills Approved in UK, Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Both Britain and the Republic
of Ireland approved new anti-terror laws on Friday following the
terrorist bombing which killed 28 people in the Northern Ireland
town of Omagh last month.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Tony Blair and Irish Prime Minister
Bertie Ahern announced the bills in their respective country.
</P>
<P>
The bills will make it easier to convict people of belonging to
outlawed guerrilla groups by giving courts the right to rely on
evidence given by a senior police officer and allowing them to
take an accused person's refusal to answer questions as an
indication of guilt.
</P>
<P>
The Criminal Justice (Terrorism and Conspiracy) Act gained
Royal Assent after clearing all its stages in Britain's House of
Lords in the early hours of Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
In the Irish Republic, similar "draconian" measures became law
with equal haste.
</P>
<P>
The Senate, the upper house of the Irish parliament, approved
the anti-terror bill without a vote on Thursday evening - just
minutes after U.S. President Bill Clinton arrived in Dublin on his
Irish tour. The bill was approved by the Dail, the lower house, a
day earlier.

<HEADLINE> Women's Conference Considers Restrictions on Divorce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The revised marriage law
should make people take marriage more seriously and reduce the
number of hasty marriages and divorces, women representatives
attending the ongoing Eighth National Congress of Chinese Women
proposed today.
</P>
<P>
The new code on marriage and the family defines living
separately for three years as a condition for divorce, and
stipulates that married couples must be faithful to each other,
said Wu Changzhen, a female professor of law at the China
University of Political Sciences and Law and one of the authors of
the proposed code.
</P>
<P>
The code should include "mutual faithfulness" as one of the
duties for married couples, which is intended to make extramarital
sexual relations illegal. If one partner has an affair, the other
partner must be compensated if there is a divorce.
</P>
<P>
"Most complaints from women involve extra-marital affairs, and
the revision of the Marriage Law should put severe restrictions on
the subject," said Li Li, vice-chairperson of the Shanghai
Municipal Women's Federation. She said family stability and
happiness should be sought through comprehensive means instead of
solely by legal efforts.
</P>
<P>
Chinese have little self-protection awareness, and sexually
related diseases could run rampant if extramarital sex is not
checked, said Lin Huizhu, vice-chairperson of the Guangdong
Women's Federation.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Stock Market Gains in August From Easing of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus Stock Market
marked an ascending course in August amidst vivid investment
activities triggered by easing of the political tension, a monthly
market report said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The market review, issued by Cyprus Investment and Securities
Corporation Limited (CISCO), said the CISCO All-Share Index
closed on August 31 at 446.4 points, registering a notable monthly
rise of 23.3 points, or 5.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
During the month, the level of 440 points was surpassed for the
first time since mid-May when the market was experiencing a steep
decline due to the tension sparked by Cyprus' determination to
deploy the Russian-made anti-aircraft missiles as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
The highest monthly level was recorded on August 27 when the
market closed at 451.9 points, which is only 22 points short of
this year's record of 473.9 points.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the market engaged on a gradual unwinding which
naturally follows periods of continuous and uninterrupted
ascents. Therefore, the market lost some ground and the CISCO
All-Share Index closed on Thursday at 442 points.
</P>
<P>
The review said that investment euphoria during August was
primarily supported by the easing of political tension regarding
the issue of the arrival of the Russian-made S-300 missiles,
which seems at present to be shelved.
</P>
<P>
Investors seemed to be relieved from the latest
developments. And as soon as the possibility of postponing the
missile deployment emerged, they rushed in, channeling their
available funds towards selected stocks, the review said.

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Continue Falling in Tokyo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices continued falling
in Tokyo Friday as the collapse of Toa Steel Co. and the sharp
drop in Wall Street overnight depressed investors.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange fell 218.33 points, or 1.53
percent, from Thursday's close to end at 14,042.91.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, lost 19.30 points or 1.73 percent to
1,094.47.
</P>
<P>
Volume on the major section went up to an estimated 430 million
shares from Thursday's 376.02 million shares.
</P>
<P>
Toa Steel's decision late Thursday to fold next March made it
the fifth listed Japanese company this year to go belly up and
dealt a strong blow to steel shares. Its parent company, NKK, was
the day's most heavily traded issue.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the 1.29 percent decline in the Dow Jones Industrial
Average in New York spurred selling in shares of multinational
blue chips.
</P>
<P>
Of the 1,341 issues listed on the First Section, losers
outpaced gainers 972 to 196, with 118 issues remaining unchanged.

<HEADLINE> Chernomyrdin: Russia to Enter "Economic Dictatorship" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Acting Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin said here Friday that Russia "will switch over to
economic dictatorship" from January.
</P>
<P>
"I am prepared to shoulder the responsibility for the
realization of this course," he told the Federation Council, or
upper house of parliament, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin asked the Federation Council to support him and
give its consent to urgent actions of the government.
</P>
<P>
"At my age of 60 there is no need for me to bluff. I fully
realize the degree of responsibility," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is true that our measures will be unpopular. It is true
that everybody, from top to bottom, will scold us. But do not
catch the government by the hands," Chernomyrdin said.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin, nominated prime minister last week, was rejected
overwhelmingly on Monday by the State Duma, or lower house of
parliament.
</P>
<P>
"Give us time, give us a chance to start working," he said.
</P>
<P>
The State Duma is set to debate and vote on Chernomyrdin's
nomination later Friday. Many opposition parties have indicated
they will vote against him.
</P>
<P>
Under Russian constitution, if the State Duma blocks the
nomination three times, the president will have to either submit a
new nominee or dissolve the lower house.
</P>
<P>
"I am telling everybody, including the president and the
legislative branch: let the country retreat from the edge of the
abyss."
</P>
<P>
As the political haggling goes on in Moscow, Russia's economic
and financial crisis worsened.
</P>
<P>
On the Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange, the ruble was traded
at 16.99 to one U.S. dollar on Friday, a fall of some 170 percent
as compared to the pre-crisis level.
</P>
<P>
Prices soared and some staple food products are vanishing from
the shelves of grocery stores amid reports of poor harvest and
looming food shortages.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin warned that if panic is not stopped in the next
few days and stocks of materials and food are not gathered for the
winter, the country could slip back to the miserable situation
prevailing at the end of 1980s.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 4 (Xinhua) -- China's urban air quality has
dropped slightly over the past week, according to the China
Environmental Monitoring Center.
</P>
<P>
The center's latest air-quality report said that as the
rainfall belt moved to the southern part of China from Aug. 28 to
Sept 3, some northern cities' air quality worsened compared with
the preceding week.
</P>
<P>
Cities such as Huhhot, Xi'an, Shanghai, Chongqing and Guangzhou
suffered from slight air pollution during the past week, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
The major problem in Guangzhou and Shanghai was nitrogen oxide
and Chongqing suffered from sulphur dioxide. Other cities all
reported high levels of suspended particles.
</P>
<P>
Nine cities -- Fuzhou, Ningbo, Shantou, Guilin, Wenzhou,
Zhanjiang, Xiamen, Haikou and Beihai -- enjoyed excellent air
quality during the period.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-seven cities -- including Beijing, Tianjin, Nanjing,

<HEADLINE> Intel Names Head of China Research Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Intel, the world's largest
chip maker, named Dr. Robert Yung, a former Sun Microsystems
researcher, head of the newly-established Intel China Research
Center on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Intel has planned to invest 50 million U.S. dollars during the
next five years in the center, which will focus on research on
applied technology.
</P>
<P>
Intel's worldwide research and development effort during the
next five years will cost 2.8 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
"China is a big and fast-growing market with a rich supply of
well-trained scientists and engineers. The Chinese language also
poses special challenges in computing, and we're looking forward
to doing some research that will benefit both China and other
countries as well." Yung, a 36 Chinese-American, said in a
telephone interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
In the past two years, Yung said, he met many smart, talented
and well-informed people in China's academia and business
community as well as in the government.
</P>
<P>
"That's one of the reasons I want to go to China," he said.
</P>
<P>
Yung said that the center will fund projects at China's leading
universities and research institutes as well as conducting its own
research.
</P>
<P>
"We intend to work very closely with the nation's academic
community," he said.
</P>
<P>
Immediately prior to joining Intel, Yung was Sun Microsystems'
chief technology officer for the Asia region and was a researcher
at Sun Microsystems' Laboratories.
</P>
<P>
He immigrated from Hong Kong to the United States when he was
11. He earned his Ph.D. in electrical engineering and computer
science from the University of California at Berkeley, and has
been a visiting professor at the university since 1995.

<HEADLINE> Archeological Finds Provide Evidence for Dating Ancient Dynasties (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 4 (Xinhua) -- A group of leading
archeologists recently came upon several cultural sites and relics
dating back as far as 4,000 years ago. These finds may possibly
provide evidence for precise dating of the first three dynasties
in China.
</P>
<P>
The Institute of Archeology under the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences (CASS) did excavations at the Erlitou sites and the
ancient town of the Shang Dynasty, both in Yanshi in central Henan
Province, another ancient town ruins of the late Shang Dynasty,
and the Fenghao ruins in Xi'an in northwestern Shaanxi Province,
Miao Yajuan told Xinhua today.
</P>
<P>
"The latest archeological finds have made great contributions
to the nation's endeavor to unravel the complete chronology of its
5,000-year history," she said.
</P>
<P>
A research project has been organized to determine precise
dates for the Xia (21th-16th Century BC), Shang (16th to 11th
Century BC) Zhou (11th Century-226 BC) dynasties which have
inspired many legends and anecdotes. The major study focuses on
events some 2,800 to 4,000 years ago to gain accurately
apportioned time-frames for the three dynasties.
</P>
<P>
The existing historical chronicles for China, one of the
world's four ancient civilizations, begins in 841 B.C., so there
is no precise record for nearly half of the nation's remote
history.
</P>
<P>
"The Erlitou sites are always principal research targets for
tracing cultural development in the Xia Dynasty (22th-17th century
B.C.)," Miao said.
</P>
<P>
After 30 years of excavations at these sites totalling about
three sq km, researchers spotted traces of the ruins of two
palaces, workshops for manufacturing bone tools, sacrificial
places and hundreds of tombs, and unearthed bronzes, jade objects,
lacquerware and other relics.

<P>
At the same sites they found a series of cultural layers at the
first to fifth stages of development.
</P>
<P>
In addition, archeologists found the city wall, city gates and
palaces inside the city, and residential houses at the ruins of
the Shang Dynasty town (17th-11th century B.C.), five kilometers
from Erlitou.
</P>
<P>
They also found an inner town, 1,100 meters by 740 meters,
inside the previously discovered town. "Study shows that the inner
city was built much earlier than the large one," Miao said.
</P>
<P>
Thus, experts have ascertained that the town was the capital of the
early Shang Dynasty.
</P>
<P>
At the ruins of Yinxu in the city of Anyang, Henan Province,
which was regarded the capital of the late Shang Dynasty, experts
unearthed a great number of cultural relics, giving them greater
knowledge of the scale, layout and cultural stages of the ancient
town.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, some prime samples dating from the reigns of King Wu
of the Shang Dynasty and other kings of the Western Zhou Dynasty
(B.C.11th Century-771 B.C.) were collected at the Fenghao ruins in
Shaanxi.

<HEADLINE> NATO to Hold Joint Exercise in Macedonia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 4 (Xinhua) -- NATO will exercise its
infantry together with its equivalent from Partnership for Peace
nations in Macedonia from September 10 to 18.
</P>
<P>
The joint military exercise, named Cooperative Best Effort 98
and drawn participation from 26 countries, will be held at
Krivolak, a permanent training center for NATO's Partnership for
Peace (PFP) program.
</P>
<P>
The exercise aims at coordinating troops from different
countries in a typical peacekeeping scenario and focuses on
fostering mutual understanding and improving interoperability.
</P>
<P>
NATO officials said that the Macedonia exercise would also
demonstrate the important contribution NATO's PFP can make to the
fostering of stability and security in the region.
</P>
<P>
Fixed-wing NATO aircraft will fly by Krivolak to demonstrate an
air-borne parachute drop during the exercise.
</P>
<P>
Those already confirmed participation include, on the NATO
side, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, the
Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Turkey, Britain and the
United States; and on the PFP nation side, Albania, Austria,
Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Estonia, Macedonia, Georgia, Hungary,
Latvia, Moldova, Poland, Romania and Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
Finland, though not participating, will provide the exercise
with technical support.
</P>
<P>
NATO held a joint exercise in mid-August in neighboring Albania
to demonstrate the western military alliance's concern over the
crisis in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo and its readiness to
deploy what it describes as a preventive troop to the region to
fend off the possible spillover of the crisis.

<HEADLINE> Slump Wipes Out 7-Year Gains in Thailand: Economists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The economic crisis in
Thailand has wiped out productive gains of the last seven years,
Thai economists said Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Right now, it's as if the Thai people are working and
manufacturing for free. Nothing has increased over the past seven
years," Staporn Kavitanon, secretary-general of the Board of
Investment, told a seminar on economic trends hosted by Thammasat
University.
</P>
<P>
For 1998, public income would be about 113 trillion baht (2.82
trillion U.S. dollars), equal to that posted in 1991, and a stark
contrast to the 183 trillion baht (4.755 trillion U.S. dollars) in
1996 before the crisis erupted, according to the seminar.
</P>
<P>
Staporn said he expected the value of exports this year to be
worse than expected as revenue in dollar terms would fall by eight
percent from last year's level.
</P>
<P>
Government forecast show export revenue in dollar terms
dropping by less than three percent to about 53 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The collapse of the credit system in trade had magnified falls
in sales, trade and working capital, Staporn said. As a result,
companies would have to move immediately to ease liquidity, rather
than wait for government efforts to take effect.
</P>
<P>
Banthoon Lamsam, president of Thai Farmers Bank and head of the
Thai Bankers' Association, said two problems were faced by
industrial firms.
</P>
<P>
Some firms were squeezed by a lack of credit and falling
cashflows, while others had seen their markets vanish, or were
making products that could sell but only at low prices.
</P>
<P>
He said fixing the credit system was essential for recovery.
But firms also had to adjust to the demands of the market by
improving services and product quality.
</P>
<P>
Banthoon said new loans by local banks would most likely come
in the form of working capital as few institutions would lend to
help firms build new factories, given the excess production
capacity within the economy.
</P>
<P>
The experts agreed that collective measures were needed by the
business sector to rebuild the economy. Firms now might extend
credit to just five out of every 100 customers. If every company
collectively chose to give credit to 10 out of every 100, the
overall benefit would be enormous.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government was in danger of falling into a
"snowballing effect" where the problems, both domestic and
external, would continue building up, the experts warned.
</P>
<P>
They said if people wait until the worst occurs before they
think about it, there will be no chance they can deal with things
on time.

<HEADLINE> NZ Disappointed at Cancellation of Defense Exercise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, September 4 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand was
disappointed at Malaysia's cancellation of this year's joint
defense exercise of New Zealand, Australia, Britain, Malaysia and
Singapore, The Evening Post reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Wellington-based newspaper quoted New Zealand foreign
affairs spokesman James Funnell as saying that New Zealand's High
Commissioner in Kuala Lumpur had delivered a message to the
Malaysian Government, expressing New Zealand's disappointment.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper criticized Malaysia for freezing its involvement
in the 27-year-old Five Power Defense Arrangement (FPDA), forcing
the last-minute cancellation of "a major annual defense exercise."
</P>
<P>
According to the newspaper, many ships and aircraft which were
to have taken part in the Stardex 98 naval-air exercise, scheduled
September 20-October 4, were in transit when the cancellation was
announced.
</P>
<P>
It quoted New Zealand Defense Spokesman John Seward as saying
that no alternative exercises were planned, although an exercise
with Singapore scheduled to start on September 14 would be
extended a few days.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Coca-Cola Company has
suspended its plans to undertake a 75 million U.S. Dollars
investment program in Zambia and is scaling down its operations
in the country.
</P>
<P>
This decision followed the Zambian government's failure to
honor a pledge to reduce the excise duty on the company's
products, The Post paper said Friday.
</P>
<P>
And the price of all Coca-Cola soft drinks will be increased
from the current 500 Zambian Kwacha (one dollar equals to 2,000
Kwacha) to 900 Kwacha with effect from Monday or September 7.
</P>
<P>
The company's Africa President Carl Ware told the paper
Thursday that they would scale down the operations in Zambia,
citing high operating costs.
</P>
<P>
"We are extremely disappointed to learn that the government of
Zambia rather than ratifying the agreement made with us in May
this year, has instead referred the matter of excise taxation
back to Zambia Revenue Authority," said Ware.
</P>
<P>
He was making reference to the government's commitment to
redut&AMP;
H8ercent rate of excise
duty were not viable and the government's failure to reduce the
duty would have facilitated the company's departure from the
country, according to Ware.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Army to Kill Aggressors: General </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Uganda People's Defense
Forces (UPDF) will kill all those threatening the country's
security on its western border, a major general has said Thursday
evening.
</P>
<P>
Salim Saleh, President Yoweri Museveni's brother and the
presidential adviser on military affairs, made the remarks from
his headquarters in northern Gulu district.
</P>
<P>
He warned Zimbabwean and Angolan troops in the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC) that they will meet a tough response from
Ugandan army if they pose any threat to Uganda's security,
Friday's Monitor daily reported.
</P>
<P>
Salim described the threats by Zimbabwean commander Mike
Nyambuya of looking forward to an eastern offensive as a move
aimed to cover the failures the allied forces had suffered along
the western front-line.
</P>
<P>
In a few days, these Angolan and Zimbabweans will realize that
they have involved themselves in a situation they cannot easily
walk away from, he added.
</P>
<P>
But he reportedly shunned the question of whether Ugandan army
still remains deep in Congo (K) as he confessed last week.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, President Y. Museveni said in a press release
Thursday that his country could conditionally discuss Ugandan
military presence in Congo with parties concerned.
</P>
<P>
This move was made in response to the sharp turn of attitude
by South Africa toward the Congo conflict and to some other
countries in the Southern African Development Community who have
come to side with President Laurent Kabila by supporting foreign
military intervention.

<P>
ANKARA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Iraq's Kurdistan Democratic
Party (KDP) leader Massoud Barzani has complained about Iranian
interference in northern Iraq, local Daily News reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Barzani lodged his complaint in meetings with western diplomats
in Ankara, which was particularly directed at the Iranian
influence on KDP's rival Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) led by
Jalal Talabani.
</P>
<P>
Barzani, who arrived here Wednesday night for a four-day
visit, will travel to Washington on Saturday to discuss creating
a joint administration in northern Iraq with Talabani under the
mediation of the United States.
</P>
<P>
The KDP and PUK have been fighting for the control of northern
Iraq since 1991 Gulf War after the region became a power vacuum.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted the western diplomats who met with Barzani
as saying that the KDP leader also complained about the PUK
support for the outlawed anti-Turkish Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK)
in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Barzani seemed to be satisfied with the cooperation with
Turkey in fighting against the PKK, the diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
KDP Spokesman Sami Abdurrahman said Thursday here that the
basic dispute between the KDP and PUK is the sharing of the
administration.
</P>
<P>
"We wanted the joint administration in 1992, but the PUK
defended the view that the administration has to be shared equally
between the two sides", he said.
</P>
<P>
The KDP controls two-thirds of the Kurdish-controlled area in
northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In March, Talabani sent a letter to Barzani seeking a broad
reconciliation with the KDP in a bid to set up a permanent peace
in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, Talabani proposed a high-level meeting between
the two factions to sort out their differences.

<HEADLINE> Poverty, Not Immigrants, To Blame for TB: NZ Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The Dominion newspaper
Friday quoted an Auckland medical expert as saying that poverty,
not immigrants, is to blame for an outbreak of tuberculosis in New
Zealand.
</P>
<P>
Since December, seven students at Tangaroa College in Otara,
South Auckland, have been diagnosed with tuberculosis and a
further five students have the infection in the first mass
outbreak of tuberculosis in New Zealand in a decade.
</P>
<P>
This week, an immigrant pupil at Mt Roskill Intermediate in
Auckland was also diagnosed with the illness.
</P>
<P>
Mass tuberculosis screenings are being done in parts of the
North Island, according to local media reports.
</P>
<P>
Some health authorities, including the Communicable Disease
Center and Auckland medical officer of health Lester Calder, have
blamed emigration from the Pacific and Asia for the prevalence of
tuberculosis in New Zealand, sparking calls for all immigrants to
be screened for the disease.
</P>
<P>
But the Dominion quoted Dr Colin Tukuitonga, senior lecturer at
Auckland University school of medicine, as saying that it was "a
Load of rot" to blame Pacific and Asian immigrants for
tuberculosis in New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
Dr Tukuitonga said the real cause of tuberculosis was poverty.
Conditions contributing to the spread of the disease, such as
overcrowded housing, poor nutrition and general health, and lack
of access to health care, were rife in some New Zealand
communities, particularly in urban South Auckland.
</P>
<P>
"It's a load of rot to say it is imported, when the problem is
here in New Zealand," he said.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand Minister of Immigration Tuariki Delamere was quoted
as saying that he did not support calls for the screening of
immigrants for the disease.
</P>
<P>
Figures issued by the New Zealand Ministry of Health show that
last year 330 cases of tuberculosis were recorded in the country,
compared to 355 in 1996 and 375 in 1995. The figures were well
down on recent decades. In 1960, 1,400 cases were notified.

<HEADLINE> U.S. firm TCL, to Invest in Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The U.S.-based
Telecommunication company, TCL, has signed a protocol worth 419
million U.S. dollars with the Taliban authorities for the
installation of mobile telephone facility in war-torn Afghanistan,
the Frontier Post reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Under the protocol which was signed in the Afghan capital of
Kabul Wednesday, the project is expected to be completed within
three years in two stages, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The first stage involves an investment of 175 million U.S.
dollars for the installation of satellite-operated mobile phone
facility in Afghanistan's 14 provinces.
</P>
<P>
In the second stage, a total of 244 million U.S. dollars will
be spent on expanding the facility to the whole of Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
According to initial estimates, American manpower to be
involved in the project would account for only one percent of the
whole, whereas 99 percent of the development work would be carried
out with the assistance of Afghan engineers and technicians. The
project is expected to create as many as 20,000 jobs for the
Afghans.
</P>
<P>
TCL will bear almost 80 percent of the cost while the Taliban
authorities' share would be around 20 percent, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Pro-Israeli Lebanese Militia Chief Frees Woman Assassin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 4 (Xinhua) -- A Lebanese woman who attempted
to kill the leader of the Israeli allied South Lebanese Army (SLA)
Antoine Lahd has been released, the Daily Star reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Suha Beshara, 31, was driven by the International Committee of
the Red Cross to Beirut Thursday via the Bater crossing, north of
the country's central area of Jezzine controlled by SLA.
</P>
<P>
She received a hero's welcome by her family, friends and
Lebanese officials, including Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik
Hariri.
</P>
<P>
Her release was reportedly secured after Hariri sought the
help of French President Jacques Chirac who threatened to revoke
the French citizenship of Lahd if he didn't free Beshara.
</P>
<P>
Lahd's family is living in France and he is expected to
move there once Israel withdraws from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel is occupying a 1,200-square-kilometer border strip in
south Lebanon backed by the Lahd-led SLA to allegedly protect
its north from cross-border attacks by Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Lahd, 68, has been sentenced to death in absentia by a
Beirut military court for collaborating with the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Having befriended Lahd's wife and become a tutor to her
children, Beshara, a secret member of the Lebanese Communist
Party, made the assassination attempt on Lahd on November 7,
1988.
</P>
<P>
Lahd was wounded in the arm and shoulder and Beshara was
detained at the SLA prison at Khiam village in the south.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference after being released, Beshara said she had
no regret for what she had done. And she vowed to continue her
struggle until her country was fully liberated from Israeli
occupation.

<HEADLINE> China to Turn One-Million Lumberjacks Into Tree Planters (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 4 (Xinhua) -- China plans to begin a
gigantic forest-conservation project this year which is expected
to turn one-million-odd lumberjacks into tree planters.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, the first-phase of the project, from
1998 to 2000, will require 19.5 billion yuan (about 2.3 billion
U.S. dollars) of investment.
</P>
<P>
This project was adopted by the State Forestry Administration
and includes the stopping of logging operations of 65 lumber
businesses and reducing the lumber production of another 70 lumber
businesses by 10 million cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from forestry departments indicate that with the
implementation of this forest-conservation project, over one
million people now employed by the forestry industry will lose
their present jobs by 2000.
</P>
<P>
Li Yucai, Deputy Director of the State Forestry Administration,
said most of those laid-off will have new jobs as tree planting,
forest-tenders, and other related work.
</P>
<P>
He said Heilongjiang, Jilin and Sichuan provinces, which have
vast primitive forests, have made preparations for the start of
the biggest forest-conservation project in China this century.
</P>
<P>
Li added that the central government has provided over 6
billion yuan (about 723 million U.S. dollars) in addition to
special funds for the project this year.
</P>
<P>
"This unprecedented largest sum of investment for forestry
since the founding of New China indicates the central
government is determined to protect the forests," Li said.

TAIYUAN, September 4 (Xinhua) -- China recently discovered a
huge coal gas field in northern Shanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
The field, located near the cities of Jincheng and Changzhi in
southeast Shanxi, has an area of more than 1,200 square kilometers
and proven gas reserves of more than 200 billion cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
The discovery came after more than two years of geological
exploration. Experts say that the field can generate up to one
billion cubic meters of coal gas each year, and that this amount
is large enough to meet the industrial and civilian needs of the
major cities in southeast Shanxi.

<P>
Li said that when the second phase of the project is completed
in 2010, China's forests will be better protected and lumber
production will rely mainly on the newly planted forests.
</P>
<P>
China has 87.26 million hectares of forests, accounting for 9
percent of its land territory.
</P>
<P>
One forestry expert warns that if logging continues at the
present rate, the Chinese people will not see a single forest
left in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that this project will benefit 61 percent of
China's major forests.
</P>
<P>
Forestry experts have also called for state-level protection of
the other 39 percent of the forests under the administration of
local governments.
</P>
<P>
Experts have stressed the importance of forests in retaining
water resources, maintaining ecological balance, and reducing soil
erosion.
</P>
<P>
They say that a huge tree can store 4 tons of water, while the
logging of one cu. m. of lumber will add 0.4 tons of silt to
a river annually.
</P>
<P>
The State Forestry Administration believes that the devastating
floods in China this summer are due, at least in part, to
deforestation and the serious damage it has done to vegetation
along the upper reaches of the Yangtze and other rivers.
</P>
<P>
He announced that China will impose a forest-logging ban in the
Yangtze and Yellow rivers valley areas and focus on planting more
trees in farmlands where forests have formerly flourished.

<HEADLINE> Scientists: Fish Oil May Reduce Psychiatric Disorders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Three scientists reported
their studies Thursday that the consumption of fish and fish oil
may reduce the symptoms of variety of psychiatric illnesses,
including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and depression.
</P>
<P>
The studies were released at a seminar sponsored by the
National Institutes of Health in Bethesds, Maryland.
</P>
<P>
The first study, conducted by Dr. Andrew Stoll of the Harvard
Medical School in Massachusetts, found that fish oil
supplementation could help alleviate the symptoms of bipolar
(manic-depressive) disorder.
</P>
<P>
Stoll said he gave 14 bipolar patients daily supplements of
fish oil for a 4-month period, 9 of the patients responded
favorably, compared to only 3 of 16 bipolar patients receiving
placebo.
</P>
<P>
The second study, conducted by Dr. Malcolm Peet of Northern
General Hospital in England, concluded that, following 3-month
period, fish oil improved patients with schizophrenic symptoms.
</P>
<P>
The third study, conducted by Dr. Joseph Hibblen of the
National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism in Maryland,
said that some suicidal patients may reduce their suicidal risk
with the consumption of fish oil.
</P>
<P>
Hibblen explained that dietary intake of omega-3 fatty acids,
found in fish and fish oil, may influence serotonin function in
the brain.
</P>
<P>
"Such an alteration in serotoninergic function may possibly
reduce depressive, suicidal and violent behavior," he said, but
admitting that these changes have not yet been demonstrated in
clinical trials.

<P>
Machungwa came out in support of earlier warnings from Legal
Affairs Minister Vincent Malambo and Dav{D$Mpamba, Minister of

Monday that the government would not permit homosexual activities
because they were illegal and an abomination of African culture.
</P>

advocated the existence of an association for gay people risked
facing the law.

<HEADLINE> Second Man Files Suit Against Tyson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 3 (Xinhua) -- A second man who says he
was assaulted by Mike Tyson following a minor traffic accident
filed a criminal assault charge against the former heavyweight
boxing champion Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Abmielec Saucedo, 62, says Tyson punched him in the
face"without warning" as Saucedo talked with another driver
following the accident on Monday in Maryland suburb.
</P>
<P>
Saucedo's car struck a car driven by Richard Hardick, which
then struck a Mercedes driven by Tyson's wife.
</P>
<P>
Hardick, 50, filed a similar complaint against Tyson on
Wednesday, saying Tyson kicked him in the groin following the
accident.
</P>
<P>
But Tyson denied the allegations. "I did not kick anyone. I
did not punch anyone," Tyson said in a statement released
Wednesday through his lawyer John G. Branca. "My wife and I were
the victims of a traffic accident. I am distressed by these false
allegations. I did not touch anyone," he said.
</P>
<P>
His wife said:"Mike did not punch, kick or touch anyone at any
time."
</P>
<P>
Saucedo said in his complaint:"I was talking with the driver
of the car in front of me when Mr. Tyson came at me. Without
warning he punched me in the face with his fist. I saw stars, cut
my upper lip and I was bleeding."
</P>
<P>
A preliminary hearing on both charges has been set for October
2. However, Paul Kemp, the lawyer representing Tyson in both
cases, says it's likely that hearing will be canceled and a trial
date set.
</P>
<P>
Tyson faces up to 10 years in prison or a $2,500 fine on each
assault charge.

<HEADLINE> Sampras, Hingis Advances to Third Round at U.S. Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Top seed Pete Sampras of
the United States continued his quest for a record-tying 12th
Grand Slam title later today when he eliminated unseeded
countryman Paul Goldstein 7-6 (7-4), 2-6, 6-3, 6-3 in the second
round of the U.S. Open tennis championships in New York.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, top seed and defending champion Martina Hingis of
Switzerland survived a shaky first set to beat 1997 French Open
champion Iva Majoli of Croatia in the second round.
</P>
<P>
Sampras, who is also looking to finish as the top-ranked
player a record sixth straight year, found Goldstein was a hard
nut to crack today. Goldstein, who won his first Grand Slam match
Monday, took advantage of several unforced errors by Sampras to
force a tie-breaker. But Sampras rode his big serve for a 5-0
lead and won the set when Goldstein's forehand sailed long.
</P>
<P>
The 22-year-old Goldstein rebounded in the second set,
breaking Sampras in the fourth game. He took a 5-2 advantage when
Sampras double-faulted, his second of the game.
</P>
<P>
However, Sampras found his composure and dominated the rest of
the match, claiming third-set service breaks in the seventh and
ninth games. He closed out the match in two hours, eight minutes
when Goldstein's forehand landed wide.
</P>
<P>
Sampras fired 23 aces but committed 10 double-faults. His
first serve was practically untouchable as he won the point 91
percent of the time. He made 43 unforced errors through the first
two set, but just 14 thereafter.
</P>
<P>
Sixth seed Greg Rusedski of Britain, who was beaten by Rafter
in last year's final, won his second straight five-set match 4-6,
6-3, 4-6, 6-2, 7-5 today over Bohdan Ulihrach of the Czech
Republic.
</P>
<P>
"I was thinking about joining the women's tour," joked
Rusedski. "You only have to play three sets, maximum. But a win
is a win. I knew I had a difficult match today."
</P>
<P>
Hingis was pushed to a first-set tie-breaker before responding
with a 7-6 (7-4), 6-0 victory over the unseeded Majoli. "I didn't
feel like I controlled the game," said Hingis, who has won six of
eight career matches from Majoli. "I was just very nervous the
first set. I was still also in the second. I kind of loosened up
and everything started to go in."
</P>
<P>
The Swiss teenager broke Majoli's serve in the fourth game of
the first set but the 20-year-old Croatian broke back three games
later. Both players held serve as the set went to tiebreaker,
which Hingis won when Majoli's forehand went outside.
</P>
<P>
"I didn't let her back in the game," Hingis said. "I was
focused from the first game on."
</P>
<P>
In a first round match that began yesterday but was postponed
by rain, seventh seed Alex Corretja of Spain rallied past Italy's
Gianluca Pozzi 2-6, 6-3, 7-5, 7-5.
</P>
<P>
Eighth seed Andre Agassi of the United States won his first
five-setter of the year 6-3, 6-2, 6-7 (6-8), 3-6, 6-1 over
tenacious Frenchman Guillaume Raoux.
</P>
<P>
Agassi, who improved to 42-11 at the U.S. Open, fell to
Alberto Berasategui at the Australian Open and 18-year-old
Russian Marat Safin at the French Open in his previous five-set
matches.
</P>
<P>
"I was really frustrated with myself for letting it get to the
fourth," Agassi said. "You can't affort to have that happen. But
I don't mind it being this way. It wasn't tremendously fatiguing
match, which normally five-setters. You worry about just playing
too much. I think it was certainly a wake-up call of sort for me
to be up two sets and not to close it out and find myself in a
three-hour battle."
</P>
<P>
No.9 Karol Kucera of Slovakia downed France's Jerome Golmard
7-5, 6-3, 6-0 and No.12 Jonas Bjorkman of Sweden posted an easy
6-2, 6-3, 6-1 win over American Jonathan Stark.
</P>
<P>
On the women's side, second seed Lindsay Davenport of the
United States cruised past countrywoman Lori McNeil 6-1, 6-1.
Fourth seed and 1994 winner Arantxa Sanchez Vicario of Spain
defeated Colombian Fabiola Zuluaga 6-3, 6-2 and 1997 runner-up
Venus Williams of the United States, the fifth seed, dispatched
Luxembourg's Anne Kremer 6-1, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
Seventh seed Conchita Martinez of Spain beat American
Jacqueline Trail 7-6 (7-4), 6-1; No.10 Nathalie Tauziat of
France, the Wimbledon finalist, overcame Olga Barabanschikova of
Belarus 6-7 (4-7), 6-2, 6-3; No.12 seed Mary Pierce of France
eliminated Zimbabwe's Cara Black 6-1, 6-1. No.13 seed Amanda
Coetzer of South Africa beat Raluca Sandu of Romania 6-0, 6-2.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Distributes Relief Grains, Money Among Flood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi Ministry of
Relief and Disaster Management has so far distributed 43.45
million taka (924,450 U.S. dollars) in cash and 66,018 tons of
rice among the flood victims.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed by the state minister of the ministry at a
meeting of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on the ministry
held here Thursday, press reports said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The government has decided to distribute more vulnerable group
feeding (VGF) cards among the flood-affected people especially in
the worst-hit areas of the country, the reports quoted the state
minister of the ministry as saying.
</P>
<P>
Three hundred people of every flood-hit unions (townships) are
now holding VGF cards, while each of them receive about 15
kilograms of rice per month, he said.
</P>
<P>
The government has so far distributed a total of 777,470 VGF
cards among the poor and it would start distributing more cards
soon, he stated.
</P>
<P>
More than 21.5 million people have been affected by the current
devastating floods in the country since July 12 in 45 of the
country's 64 districts, with the death toll rising to 451 so far.
</P>
<P>
The country's food aid requirement has been estimated to be
around 1.38 million tons in the current fiscal year since crop
loss caused by nearly two-month-long floods might stand at three
million tons because 60 percent of rice crop has been severely
affected.
</P>
<P>

dollar-aid from outside for post-flood rehabilitation work, and
foreign aid for Bangladeshi flood victims has so far reached 84

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Strives for Effective Forest Conservation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Yangon, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar has been striving for
effective forest conservation to maintain sustainable yield of
forest products by extending reserved forest area and carrying out
natural forest regeneration and artificial forest plantation.
</P>
<P>
The country's total reserved forest area was extended to
106,288 square kilometers (sq.-km) in March, the end of 1997-98
fiscal year, increasing by 2,333 sq.-km at the same period of the
previous year, according to a latest annual official report on
the country's forestry condition.
</P>
<P>
During the fiscal year, area under natural regeneration for
valuable tree species was extended by 8,748 hectares, while that
under artificial forest plantation expanded by 33,987 hectares,
on which plantation of 1.26 million teak trees and 2.52 million
hardwood trees were carried out.
</P>
<P>
The plantation of the two main kinds of trees added up to 29.16
million and 39.7 million respectively at the end of the fiscal
year.
</P>
<P>
Other 11.3 million saplings were also planted by the public
during the year.
</P>
<P>
For systematic conservation of forest in the country's arid
zone, the State Forestry Department has been implementing since
the 1992-93 a greening and environmental control project in 13
districts of the zone constituted with three central divisions of
Mandalay, Sagaing and Magway.
</P>
<P>
The projects include the establishment of nurseries,
conservation of remaining natural forest from further
deterioration, replacement of fuel wood, restoration of watershed
areas and establishment of water resources.
</P>
<P>
The project covers a total area of 9,142,380 hectares. Of
these, 1,529,879 hectares are reserved forest, 3,281,135 hectares
land outside them and 4,331,366 hectares cropping areas.
</P>
<P>
In addition to these, Myanmar also carried out protection of
wild life and wild plants and conservation of natural area,
establishing seven natural and wildlife sanctuaries and six
national parks.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has begun implementation of another 12-year greening
project from 1997-98 to 2008-09.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar promulgated the Forest Law in 1992 to effectively
conserve and preserve the forest which covers about 51 percent of
the total land area.
</P>
<P>
According to the statistics, Myanmar's forestry rose 1.3
percent in its production in the 1997-98, accounting for 1 percent
of the country's gross domestic product.

<HEADLINE> Mother May Pass Lead to Baby Through Breast Milk: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Women who have been
exposed to high lead levels may pass the substance to their
infants through breast milk, according to a study released
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The study, funded by the U.S. National Institute of
Environmental Health Sciences, said lead can accumulate in bones
and may be released into the blood when bone minerals tend to
mobilize to ensure an adequate calcium supply in breast milk.
</P>
<P>
Breast milk is considered the best infant nutrition and will
only contain lead if the mother's "exposures are very high, such
as around smelters, house renovations with leaded paint, dietary
sources from lead-glazed pottery, cosmetics and traditional
medicine", said Dr Brian Gulson, an Australian scientist who
helped conduct the study.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-four Australian infants and 21 mothers, including 15
immigrant women, took part in the study.
</P>
<P>
"We have found that breast milk was responsible for about 36 to
80 percent of the lead in the infants' bodies in the first 60 to
90 days after birth," the researchers said, suggesting that it
would be worthwhile to measure lead concentration in breast milk.

QUITO, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Inflation in August, the first

Ecuador Statistics and Census Institute (INEC).
</P>
<P>
It was slightly higher than July's inflation, but equal to that
of August, 1997.
</P>
<P>
This year's accumulated inflation amounts to 24.7 percent,

</P>
<P>
Economic authorities forecast that the annual inflation would

</P>
<P>
However, inflation will depend on measures adopted by the
government of President Jamil Mahuad. Investors are waiting for
the government's economic plan to decide on their investments.
</P>
<P>
Figures from INEC show prices of 163 items rose in August,
including food, house rents, medicines and water.
</P>
<P>
The local press expects September's inflation to be very high
because of the payment of school fees to various education
centers.

<HEADLINE> Persistent Efforts Urged to Achieve Full Victory over Floods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Minister of Water
Resources Niu Maosheng urged flood-fighters to remain alert and to
exert themselves to achieve a complete victory.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with "People's Daily," Niu, who is also deputy
commander-in-chief of the State Flood Control and Drought Relief
Headquarters, said flood-fighting has been a success so far, but
vigilance must remain high receding water levels in Yangtze River,
Nenjiang and Songhua rivers. Embankments, which have soaked in
floodwaters for extended days, are prone to collapse and could
cause major damage in the later periods of the flood season.
</P>
<P>
According to the newspaper, the 3,600 kilometers of main
embankments built along the Yangtze and major dikes built along
Dongting and Poyang lakes have been containing floodwaters which
have exceeded the danger line for more than 60 days. In some
places, more than 300 kilometers of secondary dikes have been
built to hold back floodwaters.
</P>
<P>
And the main levee built along the Songhua River has also been
operating for over one month with water levels above the danger
line. To hold back floodwaters, 600 kilometers of additional dikes
have been constructed along the river.
</P>
<P>
To achieve a complete victory against flooding in forthcoming
days, it is essential to increase meteorological and hydrological
forecasts and monitoring in accordance with the development of
floods and to intensify flood management, said Niu.
</P>
<P>
Different localities should continue to patrol the main
embankments around the clock, he said, and effective measures
should be practiced to prevent collapse while the floodwaters
recede. Materials for rescue work should be made ready for actions
when necessary, he added.
</P>
<P>
Niu also called for construction of water control facilities
across the country after the flood season is over.

<HEADLINE> Thai Rice Exporters to Negotiate with Malaysia Buyers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Thai rice exporters are to
negotiate with Malaysian buyers over the settlement of previous
deals following the adoption of fixed ringgit exchange rate, a
source from Thai Rice Exporters Association told Xinhua Friday.
</P>
<P>
The source said the date for talks is yet to be set.
</P>
<P>
Exporters are now closely monitoring the situation to avoid
increased risks, he said.
</P>
<P>
Thai rice markets was nervous after its third-largest rice
buyer, Malaysia, set controls on the ringgit and exporters
pondered the fate of unsettled deals.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia imports 400,000 to 500,000 tons of high quality rice,
fragrant rice and 100-percent white rice worth over 4.5 billion
U.S. dollars from Thailand each year.
</P>
<P>
The export volume reached 250,000 tons worth 3.75 billion baht
(93.75 million dollars) during the first seven months of this
year.
</P>
<P>
Payments between the two neighbors have traditionally been in
three currencies: baht, U.S. dollar and ringgit.
</P>
<P>
With ringgit set to lose its value outside Malaysia from
October 1, it was unclear what currency Malaysia planned to use in
settling previous deals and at what rate.
</P>
<P>
However, the source said the Thai rice exports will not be
seriously affected by the Malaysian currency policy since rice is
one of the most important foodstuffs of the Malaysian people.

<HEADLINE> No Survivors Found in Swiss Plane Crash Off Canadian Coast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Almost 24 hours after the
tragic crash of Swissair Flight 111 off Canada's east coast, no
survivors have been found of the 229 passengers and crew aboard,
and there has been no word about what caused the catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
Latest reports said that about 44 bodies had been recovered
from the Atlantic sea off Peggy's Cove, a tiny fishing village on
the south shore of Canada's Nova Scotia province.
</P>
<P>
Though it seemed almost impossible to find any survivors,
Canadian searchers were still looking for miracles, hoping that
some would survive the huge impact of the crash and cold waters.
</P>
<P>
Swissair said there were no survivors from the crash. "We have
to suppose that there are no survivors," said Philippe Bruggisser,
chief executive officer of the Geneva-based airline.
</P>
<P>
Of the 215 passengers and 14 crew aboard the jet, there were
136 Americans, 39 Swiss nationals, 30 French citizens, and people
from Britain, Canada, Germany, Italy, Greece, Saudi Arabia,
Yugoslavia, Afghanistan, Iran, Spain, St. Kitts and Russia.
</P>
<P>
The three-engine plane, enroute from New York to Geneva,
reported smoke in the cockpit after a normal takeoff from JFK
international airport about 8:18 p.m. EDT Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The crew decided to turn back to Boston. After being told that
the Halifax airport was closer, the plane flew in the direction of
Halifax.
</P>
<P>
The wide-bodied MD-11 jet crashed about 10:30 p.m. local time,
(0130 GMT) Wednesday into the ocean several kilometers from
Peggy's Cove, about 60 kilometers short of the Halifax airport.
</P>
<P>
Roy Bears of Canada's Transportation Safety Board said early
indications are that the Swissair crash was not the result of a
terrorist act.
</P>
<P>
"There were 16 minutes elapsed from the time they initially
declared an urgent situation -- smoke in the cockpit" to the time
the plane disappeared from radar.
</P>
<P>
"At this point...the crew don't think they have anything that
would indicate a terrorist act," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Canadian military aircraft, coast guard vessels and fishing
boats scoured the crash waters through the night and day.
</P>
<P>
The inky and rough water made it difficult for rescue people
navigate through the debris field, which spread a couple of
kilometers across the sea.
</P>
<P>
"When you saw how small the pieces of fragments were, you could
tell it must have been a pretty horrific crash," said Jim Buckley,
a fishing boat skipper.
</P>
<P>
Almost 24 hours after the crash, about 44 bodies, some only
body parts, had been recovered from the choppy waters, Canadian
police said.
</P>
<P>
The bodies were taken to a temporary morgue at the Canadian
Forces Base Shearwater. Dozens of doctors, including dentists and
pathologists, worked to identify remains.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar to Open More Branch Banks in Industrial Zones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Yangon, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The Myanmar Industrial
Development Bank (MIDB), a state-private capitalized financial
institution, is planning to open its more branches in industrial
zones in the country to widely disburse loans to local industries
as a support to them for their engagements.
</P>
<P>
The MIDB, established in February 1996 involving shares of
government and private sector, has recently opened its first
branch bank in the Meiktila Industrial Zone in central part, one
of the 17 in the country.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar Minister of Industry Major-General Hla Myint Swe was
quoted by Friday's The New Light of Myanmar newspaper as saying
that the bank has raised the interest rate by 15 percent to
attract more savings.
</P>
<P>
The MIDB is also one of the seven local private banks allowed
to undertake foreign exchange transaction, thus favoring
industrialists in their relative trade activities.
</P>
<P>
In line with the market-oriented economic policy, Myanmar has
reformed its financial system by enacting new banking and
financial institutions law in July 1990 to promote private
sector's economic activities.

<HEADLINE> Environmental Protection Station in Qinghai's Unpopulated Hoh Xil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, September 4 (Xinhua) -- An environmental protection
station is well established in the unpopulated area of Hoh Xil
near the source of the Yangtze River in Qinghai Province.
</P>
<P>
Facilities at the station include workshops, with a combined
floor space of over 80 sq. m., a multi-purpose hall with a floor
space of 50 sq. m., a 28-meter-high watchtower, and equipment for
telecommunications, power generating and heating.
</P>
<P>
The station is named after Gyaisang Soinamdaje, a former deputy
Party secretary of Zhidoi County, Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in
Yushu, who died of protecting the wildlife in Hoh Xil.
</P>
<P>
It was built with donated funds by young volunteer workers,
including a group of college students from Beijing, Qingdao,
Chengdu, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen.
</P>
<P>
Located in the northwestern part of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau
and with an average elevation of over 5,000 m., Hoh Xil is
considered the largest unpopulated area in China, and a place best
suited for protecting animals in the extremely cold climate unique
to the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau.
</P>
<P>
The area is home to about 250 varieties of mammals, birds and
high-grade plants, and the number of wild animals here is
estimated at between 30,000 and 40,000, including some listed
under state top protection, such as the yak, the Tibetan wild
donkey, the Tibetan antelope, and snow leopards.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the station has created favorable
conditions for protecting the natural environment at the source of
the Yangtze River and for protecting wildlife and plants in Hoh
Xil.
</P>
<P>
It will also help stop illegal hunting and facilitate wildlife
studies, said an official with the Qinghai Provincial Bureau for
Wildlife Protection.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Gives Moral Support on Ukraine Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, September 3 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
called on Thursday for Russia to carry out urgently needed
economic reforms while praising the progress made in neighboring
Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
Chirac, who arrived in the Ukrainian capital, Kiev, on
Wednesday was speaking after talks with Ukrainian President Leonid
Kuchma on the Russian economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time a French president has visited Ukraine
since it became independent seven years ago and was greeted in the
Ukrainian media as a display of "moral support".
</P>
<P>
On Thursday morning, the two presidents held talks and
signed four agreements on cooperation in the utilization of
nuclear energy, the power industry, nuclear safety, and the
administration of justice.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said France fully supported the 2.2 billion U.S. dollar,
three-year fund facility which the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) intended to provide Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
The Ukraine government and the IMF reached a rough agreement in
July despite the IMF's caution amid the growing economic turmoil
in the region.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma said the French President expressed an understanding of
Ukraine's desire to join the European Union. The two presidents
pledged to break down any artificial demarcation lines in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said the international community should help Russia
overcome the crisis and prevent it spreading to neighboring
states. He also pointed out that Russia should realize the
necessity for reform.
</P>
<P>
Chirac will hold further discussions with Kuchma before leaving
on Friday, for Kishinev, the capital of Moldova.

<P>
COLOMBO, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's capital Colombo
had over 300 fires during the first eight months of his year,
according to local fire department Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Colombo Fire Brigade sources said that they were called in
to snuff out 325 fires during this period. Most of the fires had
resulted from gas leaks and electrical short circuits.
</P>
<P>
There is an upward trend in the incidents in comparison to the
previous years.
</P>
<P>
In 1996 there were 426 fires and in 1997 there were 446. The
325 fire during the first eight months of this years is relatively
high compared with the two previous years, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The department receives at least two fire emergency calls each
day. The incidents varied from major fires to small fires which
nevertheless pose a threat to the public.
</P>
<P>
The Colombo fire Brigade has purchased three new fire engines
from Indonesia last month to strengthen the brigade.

<HEADLINE> Billions of Yuan Saved by Avoiding Flood Diversion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The reversal of a major flood
diversion decision last month helped save tens of billions of yuan
in economic losses, according to Chinese water conservation
experts.
</P>
<P>
The diversion was planned for August 16 when the Yangtze River
water level at Shashi in Hubei Province surpassed the danger level
of 45 meters.
</P>
<P>
A diversion would have resulted in the inundation of vast areas
of the Jinjiang River Flood Diversion Area, a developed area
covering 921 square kilometers with a population of
510,000. Because of the possible diversion, 350,000 people had
been evacuated.
</P>
<P>
According experts, the State Council made the final decision
against diverting floodwaters after taking into full consideration
the opinions of water conservation experts.
</P>
<P>
Based on scientific analysises, the experts concluded that the
flood crest would not last long enough to require a diversion.
</P>
<P>
"This indicates the central government leaders attach great
importance to scientific ideas," one expert said.
</P>
<P>
The experts also attributed the avoidance of the flood
diversion to the tenacious efforts of millions of flood-fighters
defending the Yangtze embankments and to sound flood-control
facilities.

QUITO, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Ecuador's health authorities
will implement an emergency plan of spraying its malaria-affected
areas, especially the coastal areas, health authorities said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Malaria cases have increased in Ecuador during recent
weeks. So far there have been 19,427 laboratory confirmed cases,
of which about 15,000 happened in littoral provinces, such as
Esmeraldas, Manabi, Guaya, and El Oro, Malaria Eradication Service

<HEADLINE> American Countries Pursue Growth Amid Financial Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Eleven American nations
vowed on Thursday to promote "sustained growth" through sound
fiscal policies in a bid to ward off the economic crises
enveloping Asia and Russia.
</P>
<P>
In a communique after the first day of their meeting, finance
officials from nine Latin American countries, Canada and the U.S.
said they would pursue "continued macroeconomic stability" and
implement "sound fiscal policies" in order to gain economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The countries -- including Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia,
Ecuador, Mexico, Peru, Uruguay and Venezuela -- would also
maintain their current exchange rate policies and regimes, open
capital markets and continue their structural reforms.
</P>
<P>
The communique said, "The external environment has deteriorated
further in recent weeks, especially reflecting market reactions to
the crisis in Russia."
</P>
<P>
The officials agreed on the importance of strategies to better
manage risks associated with the volatility of international
capital flows.
</P>
<P>
"They call upon the international financial institutions to
continue to look at possible ways to respond to such volatility
and to report back on possible strategies and mechanisms," said
the communique.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the two-day meeting at the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) was "to discuss recent global economic
developments and current prospects, their impact on the Western
Hemisphere, and the strategies of the countries in the region to
adapt to the more difficult external environment", it noted.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials were worried that the financial turmoil in
Russia and Asia would extend to Latin America, the so-called
backyard of the United States.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the headquarters of IMF earlier in the day, Mexican
Finance Minister Jose Angel Gurria complained that markets were
overreacting to world financial problems.
</P>
<P>
"Markets are certainly overreacting and not discriminating at
all between countries that have done their homework and are taking
care of their fiscal positions, taking care to have a flexible,
modern and responsive exchange rate regime," Gurria said.
</P>
<P>
He denied that the meeting was designed to seek IMF funds to
ward off financial troubles. "We have not come to ask for money.
We have not come here to organize a great fund to support Latin
America."
</P>
<P>
U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin told reporters
developments in the Latin America were "profoundly important" to
the United States.
</P>
<P>
"We have felt from the very beginning ... that what happens in
Latin America is profoundly important for the United States,"
Rubin said. "For that reason, we have been extremely supportive
of the activities and programs in Latin America that deal with the
issue."
</P>
<P>
Rubin said many Latin American countries were equipped to deal
with the world financial situation.

<HEADLINE> Costa Rica, Nicaragua Ministers To Meet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers of Costa
Rica and Nicaragua will meet soon to discuss the border dispute
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rican Foreign Affairs Minister Roberto Rojas said
Thursday that his Nicaraguan counterpart accepted an invitation to
come to San Jose, and the meeting would be held at the end of next
week.
</P>
<P>
This would be Rojas's first meeting with the Nicaraguan foreign
minister, Eduardo Montealegre, who took the portfolio last
September.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the two countries became tense last month,
when Nicaragua decided to ban the transit of armed Costa Rican
policemen along the border San Juan River, over which it exerts
full sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica has a right to navigate freely on the river, and
this includes, according to its authorities, the transit of
policemen carrying their regulation armaments.
</P>
<P>
The Nicaraguan defense minister and the Costa Rica minister of
public security reached an agreement on the river last July 30,
but the Nicaraguan Foreign Ministry later invalidated that
agreement, which worsened the situation.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rican President Miguel Angel Rodriguez said Thursday that
he met last weekend in Puerto Rico with Nicaraguan Vice President
Enrique Bolanos and discussed the issue.
</P>
<P>
"Both of us are collaborating to cool this situation and find
the best solution for Costa Rica," said Rodriguez.

<HEADLINE> Flood-Hit Chinese Farmers Preparing To Rebuild Homes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Liu Yungui, a village woman
from Lixian County in central China's Hunan Province, barely
restrained herself from tears when she saw floodwaters inundating
her house and her pet, a yellow dog.
</P>
<P>
With the help of neighbors and relief workers, Liu managed to
move to a dike along Dongting Lake. Since then, she has tried to
adapt herself to living on the levee, where small shops, barbers
and some other makeshift facilities have been set up.
</P>
<P>
Despite the inconveniences of living on the dike, Liu and her
fellow villagers have been working hard to dry up the crop seeds
they pulled out of the floodwaters.
</P>
<P>
"Just like a climber, we have reached the flat ground after
surmounting a mountain," said Liu. "Now we are sure to defeat the
floods and resume our normal life."
</P>
<P>
Currently, Liu is busy sowing rape seeds on a plot of land she
borrowed from a local farmer near her makeshift lean-to on top of
the dike. She plans to transplant rape seedlings to her own
farmland some two kilometers away once the floods have receded.
</P>
<P>
"Although the government is distributing food every day, we
shouldn't be wholly dependent," said the woman, "and we must do
something to help ourselves and alleviate the burden on the
government."
</P>
<P>
Liu's efforts are a normal sight in the flood-ravaged areas of
the country. While millions of civilians and soldiers are
continuing their battles against the gradually retreating floods,
farmers in some stricken areas are busy preparing to rebuild their
houses and resume production.
</P>
<P>
Wherever it is possible, farmers in these areas are seen
ploughing, sowing, spreading manure and replenishing small-fish
stock. In Lixian county, local villagers have sown 13,000 hectares
of drained land with corn and beans.
</P>
<P>
They have used bulldozers and pumps to reinforce dikes and
drain floodwaters form farmlands, while the Lixian county
government has allocated more than 300,000 yuan to purchase seeds
for various autumn crops for the farmers.
</P>
<P>
According to official figures, this year's summer floods, the
worst in China since 1954, have devastated 29 of the country's 31
provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities, claimed 3,004
lives, damaged nearly five million houses, submerged 21 million
hectares of farmlands, and affected a total of more than 223
million people.
</P>
<P>
With the end of the flooding in sight, the task of rebuilding
has already been put on the agenda of the central government. The
State Council has sent special groups to affected areas to assess
the damages and work out plans for reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
During a recent trip to the flooded areas, Premier Zhu Rongji
stressed that rebuilding is not just a duplication of the past,
but should be carried out through scientific and rational
planning.
</P>
<P>
Rebuilding must be aimed at bringing anti-flood capabilities
and economic power in the flood-stricken areas to a higher level,
he noted.
</P>
<P>
In related developments, China's central bank, the People's
Bank of China, has issued an emergency circular, ordering all
domestic financial institutions to assist the rebuilding effort by
providing affected farmers with low-interest loans.

<P>
OTTAWA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Canada announced Thursday that
it would provide 750,000 Canadian dollars (487,500 U.S.dollars) in
additional emergency relief aid to help flood victims in China.
</P>
<P>
"The massive displacement of people caused by severe flooding
has brought a sense of uncertainty to millions of Chinese," said
International Cooperation Minister Diane Marleau.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy said: "These funds,
together with those of Canadian non-governmental organizations and
the private sector, express the deep concern Canadians feel for
the people of China, now, and as they begin to re-build their
cities and their lives."
</P>
<P>
Canada, through the Canadian International Development Agency
(CICA), will provide 300,000 Canadian dollars (195,000 dollars) to
World Vision Canada to purchase Canadian medicines which will be
distributed by World Vision China to flood victims. An additional
450,000 Canadian dollars (292,500 dollars) will go to the
International Federation of Red Crescent Societies in support of
their efforts to help the flood victims.
</P>
<P>
This new contribution is in addition to the 250,000 Canadian
dollars in aid announced by CIDA earlier this summer, and the
310,000 Canadian dollars in public contributions to the Canadian
Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
These bring Canada's total humanitarian assistance to China's
flood victims to 1.6 million Canadian dollars (1.04 million
dollars) since July, and include additional public contributions
through World Vision Canada and the Canadian Red Cross.

<P>
SHANGHAI, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Chain stores have been
expanding rapidly in China as the number of chain-store businesses
in the country exceeded 1,000 by the end of 1997, with over 15,000
business outlets, according to a recent national retail sales
conference in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
These figures represented 42 percent and 50 percent increases
over 1996 statistics, respectively. These enterprises realized 42
billion yuan in sales last year, according to the conference.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-one of these chain store enterprises now have more than
50 retail outlets, and 56 of them are capable of doing over 100
million yuan in sales annually.
</P>
<P>
Chain stores are more developed in major cities like Beijing,
Shanghai, and Guangzhou and in economically advanced coastal areas
where people are more ready to accept this form of shopping.
</P>
<P>
And the types of chain store businesses have expanded from
commercial retailing to services like catering, hotel services,

operations, marketing and training of personnel, has now formed in
most of these areas.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, more and more transnational chain-store
corporations have chosen China for expansion of their businesses
since the early part of the decade, making competition in China
fiercer and in turn giving impetus to business growth.
</P>
<P>
Xiang Xin, a senior official with the State Economic and Trade
Commission, predicted that the next five to ten years will be
crucial for the growth of China's chain-store businesses.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Controversial Chinese
athletics coach Ma Junren will not lead his renowned family army
to this year's Asian Games in Thailand, the country's athletics
authorities confirmed here today.
</P>
<P>
Ma and his women middle and long distance runners have been
automatically disqualified from competing at the Bangkok Asian
Games in December after they skipped the national athletics
championships, which is ongoing here to serve as the
qualification event for the Games, vice-manager of the national
athletics administration center Shang Xiutang said.
</P>
<P>
"We will not change the rules to let Ma's team to go," Shang
insisted.
</P>
<P>
The authorities also accused Ma, who failed to bring his world
record-beating team to any of this season's national Grand Prix
event, of ignoring the sports rules and said he missed the
continental sports gala only with himself to blame.
</P>
<P>
An athlete must attend at least two out of six nationl Grand
Prix events and finish in the top eight in the overall standings
to qualify for the Grand Prix finals, which send its top athletes
to the national championships.
</P>
<P>
It has been reported in some media that Ma has lost interest
in competing at the continental events and now has only the 2000
Olympics on his agenda.
</P>
<P>
Last October, Ma guided his team to shatter 5000m race world
record twice in the National Games.

<HEADLINE> Training Benefits Laid-off Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Plunging into "help needed"
classified ads after being laid-off is important, but a little
time for psychological readjustment before that will be beneficial.
</P>
<P>
Today's China Daily said this is the message being conveyed
during discussions of the ongoing Eighth National Congress of
Chinese Women concerning the much-talked-about topic of laid-off
female workers.
</P>
<P>
Chinese women become mostly affected in this transitory period,
as they represent a considerable proportion of the working force
in chopped sectors such as the textile industry.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, among the 5.77 million registered
laid-off and unemployed workers in China, 52.7 percent were female.
</P>
<P>
With the help of local women's organizations, many have been
re-employed. During the past two years, the All-China Women's
Federation has helped about 480,000 laid-off women find new jobs.
</P>
<P>
Most of these jobs are in the tertiary industry, such as
household helpers and community workers, requiring little skills.
</P>
<P>
"Women should break the shackles they have made for themselves
in finding jobs, and state-owned enterprises are not the only
choice," said Qu Sufang, vice-chairperson of the Zhejiang Women's
Federation.
</P>
<P>
Limited education has affected middle-aged women -- the
majority of Chinese laid-off women -- in their competitiveness in
the market place.
</P>
<P>
Women's federations have mainly chosen to help laid-off female
workers by providing them with skill training.

<HEADLINE> Beijing's Courts Pursuing Debtors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Beijing's courts recently
launched a mass campaign to ensure debtors cannot repudiate their
obligations, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, 170,000 yuan (20,482 US dollars) in outstanding
debts was repaid in the Fengtai district People's Court, where
many cases were brought for resolution.
</P>
<P>
According to Wang Zhongshan, president of the Fengtai District
People's Court, more debt resolution cases cannot be settled in
court each year, with an increase of 30 percent between this year
and last.
</P>
<P>
"The debtors often try every means to conceal their real
financial situations and put off repayment as long as possible,"
said Fang Youquan, the president judge of the settlements
department of Fengtai District People's Court.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday morning, more than 100 debtors appeared before the
Fengtai District People's Court. Some of them placed their hopes
on drawing the sympathies of their creditors before they realized
that the court would not waste time on negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Some turned pale at the announcement of one man's detention by
the court, while others dropped their heads in the light of the
media's cameras.
</P>
<P>
After four debtors were detained, another seven agreed to make
restitution before the court. An old man pulled 30,000 yuan (3,614
US dollars) from his pockets and submitted it to the bench.
</P>
<P>
By 3 p.m. on Wednesday, 22 people had turned over 71,914 yuan
(8,664 US dollars) in cash and 106,230 yuan (12,799 US dollars) in
checks to resolve their outstanding obligations. Seventy percent
of them wrote letters of guarantee to the court, pledging to pay
their debts.
</P>
<P>
"It's a shame to have paid these debts in the presence of so
many members of the media," one man who did not give his name said.
</P>
<P>
Fifteen of the cases were completely resolved and seven cases
were partially settled.

<P>
BEIJING, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Foreign investment in China
continues to grow despite the impact by the Asian financial crisis,
according to a report by the State Administration for Industry and
Commerce.
</P>
<P>
The report, published in a recent edition of the China
Information newspaper, said that China approved 9,196
foreign-invested companies in the first half this year with a
total investment of 28.82 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
By the end of June, China had had 236,400 foreign-invested
businesses, a rise of 0.32 percent over the end of last year, said
the report, while the amount of foreign investment grew 2.29
percent to 770.742 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
As Asian countries decrease their investment in China, American
and European countries are increasing theirs, with North American
countries setting up 1,393 businesses in China in the six-month
period, a year-to-year rise of 12.25 percent, according to the
report.
</P>
<P>
Foreigners also tend to adopt long-term investment strategies
in China, with more money spent on agriculture, transport and
communications, storage and warehousing, posts and
telecommunications, and social services, said the report.

<HEADLINE> Liquor Donated to Flood-Fighting Soldiers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Six leading Chinese liquor
producers have decided to donate over one million bottles of
spirits to soldiers and armed police still fighting the worst
flooding in 40 years along the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
These distilleries, including makers of the brand-named
Wuliangye, Luzhou Laojiao, and Jiannanchun, are all located in
southwest China's Sichuan Province, where the Yangtze flows
through. Previously, they donated huge amounts of
flood relief funds and materials.
</P>
<P>
The 1.1434 million bottles of liquor, weighing 571.7 tons and
valued at 34.68 million yuan (about 4.2 million U.S. dollars),
will express high respect and sincere gratitude from the 80
million Sichuan people to the 270,000 flood-fighting soldiers and
armed policemen, said a spokesman of the provincial government,
who suggested and mobilized the liquor donation.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan is one of China's major liquor production bases,
and has one of China's largest liquor-drinking populations.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the six leading distilleries turned out a combined
340,000 tons of spirits, with sales amounting to 8.3 billion yuan,
and pre-tax profits of 3.1 billion yuan.

<HEADLINE> Sacked Malaysian Deputy PM Expelled from Ruling Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's ruling United
Malays National Organization (UMNO) Friday expelled former Deputy
Prime Minister and Finance Minister Anwar Ibrahim from the party.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Prime Minister and UMNO President Mahathir Mohamad
announced the decision taken by the UMNO Supreme Council at its
four-hour meeting here which ended at about 1 am Friday.
</P>
<P>
Anwar, who was sacked as Deputy Prime Minister and Finance
Minister on Wednesday, attended the meeting as UMNO deputy
president and was given an opportunity to defend himself against
allegations leveled at him. He left the meeting about 15 minutes
before it ended.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the decision at a news conference attended by all
the council members who were at the meeting, Mahathir said "This
is to show that the council's decision was a consensus that all
members supported the decision without exception," he said.
</P>
<P>
Asked by reporters why Anwar was expelled from the party,
Mahathir said he need not give reasons as it was a party matter.
</P>
<P>
"The decision was made after Anwar was given ample
opportunities to explain the allegations brought against him," he
said, adding all Supreme Council members who attended the meeting
were also given a chance to express their views before voting.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said that following Anwar's expulsion, the deputy
president's post would be left vacant until next year's party
elections and that the post of Deputy Prime Minister would most
likely not be filled.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said that he would be the Acting Finance Minister for
the time being.
</P>
<P>
When asked to comment on Anwar's claims that there was a
conspiracy at the highest level to ruin him, Mahathir said: "That
is his right to make allegations. You have to prove it, I think he
will be given an opportunity in a proper forum".
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Anwar told his supporters after the council meeting
he was innocent and was not prepared to leave UMNO or resign as
party deputy president.
</P>
<P>
"I know they'll continue to run me down through the local media
with the wildest of allegations. "I'll have to fight to the end,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
In several affidavits filed at the High Court Thursday, Anwar
was alleged to have been involved in sexual improprieties,
undermining national security, leaking national secrets and
accepting bribes.

VIENNA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Austrian Chancellor Viktor
Klima said Thursday Austria was working with the other 14 European
Union members to prepare a statement on Russia's situation.
</P>
<P>
Klima, who is rotating president of the European Union, urged
Russia on behalf of the EU to continue its reform.

<HEADLINE> Venus Williams Patches up Patch Problems with WTA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Venus Williams of the
United States, world number 5 player and runner-up last year,
attached the tiny rectangular logo to the shoulder strap of her
lime-green outfit in the second round match today at the U.S.
Open tennis championships in New York.
</P>
<P>
The 18-year-old fashion designer had to pay 100 U.S. dollars
for failing to wear a WTA patch in her opener. She beat qualifier
Anne Kremer 6-1, 6-3 easily today.
</P>
<P>
Williams faced a $500 fine if she did not display the patch
Thursday. The fines would have escalated to $ 25,000 had she
continued to pass on the patch.
</P>
<P>
"It just seems I am always in the middle of controversy, so it
is nothing new for me," she said. "I am separate from those type
of things. Generally, I do my practicing and I play tennis."
</P>
<P>
WTA orders players to wear the logo as part of its sponsorship
contract. Only Nike players are exempted from the patch
requirement because of a company policy that predates the WTA
deal.
</P>
<P>
Reebok, which has a multimillion dollar sneaker and clothing
contract with Williams, designed a seven outfit wardrobe for her
at the Open and defended the logo-less look, arguing that wearing
one would violate the company's agreement with her.
</P>
<P>
Williams overpowered Kremer today with her big
serve-and-volley match. Her serve reached at speeds up to 117
mph, the fastest for women players in the world.
</P>
<P>
"Everything is going very well," Williams said. "I think
everything is solid. I am trying to work more on serve and
volley,and some coming into the net more. I would definitely like
to play better."
</P>
<P>
She needed only 58 minutes to beat Kremer. "My matches haven't
been too tough so far. I think tougher your match, maybe the
better you play. I just want to make sure that I am doing what I
should on every point and not losing any focus," she said.

<HEADLINE> Hingis Advances to Third Round of U.S. Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Top seed and defending
champion Martina Hingis of Switzerland survived a shaky first set
to beat 1997 French Open champion Iva Majoli of Croatia today in
the second round of the 14 million U.S. dollars U.S. Open tennis
championships in New York.
</P>
<P>
Hingis was pushed to a tie-breaker in the first set before
responding with a 7-6 (7-4), 6-0 victory. The unseeded Majoli
defeated Hingis in last year's French Open final. Hingis will
play 18-year-old Amelie Mauresmo of France in the fourth round.
</P>
<P>
"I didn't feel like I controlled the game," said Hingis, who
has won six of eight career matches against Majoli. "I was just
very nervous the first set. I was still also in the second. I
kind of loosened up and everything started to go in."
</P>
<P>
Hingis, who captured three of four Grand Slam titles last
year,is looking to recapture her early-season form. She started
1997 strong, defending her Australian Open crown and picking up
three other titles. But Hingis has not won a title since May and
her 3,000-point lead for the No. 1 ranking has shrunk to just 500.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss teenager broke Majoli's serve in the fourth game of
the first set but the 20-year-old Croatian broke back in the
seventh game. Both players held serve as the set went to a
tie-break, wich Hingis won when Majoli's forehand went wide.
</P>
<P>
Dropping the set appeared to deflate Majoli, who won just 12
points in the second set.
</P>
<P>
"I didn't let her back in the game," Hingis said. "I was
forced from the first game on. She would serve -- by 30-Love up
-- and I still kind of came back and won the game."
</P>
<P>
Fifth seed Venus Williams moved easily into the third round
with a 6-1, 6-3 victory over qualifier Anne Kremer of Luxembourg.
Fourth seed and 1994 winner Arantxa Sanchez Vicario of Spain beat
Colombian Fabiola Zuluaga 6-3, 6-2. No. 13 Amanda Coetzer of
South Africa downed Raluca Sandu of Romania 6-0, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
In the men's section, sixth seed Greg Rusedski of Britain
ousted Bohdan Ulihrach of the Czech Republic 6-4, 3-6, 6-4, 2-6,
7-5.Seventh seed Alex Corretja of Spain beat Italy's Gianluca
Pozzi 2-6,6-3, 7-5, 7-5 in a first round match completed today.
</P>
<P>
Eighth seed American Andre Agassi, the 1994 champion, was
fully stretched in a five-set battle before edging Guillaume
Raoux of France 6-3, 6-5, 6-7 (6-8), 3-6, 6-1. No. 9 Karol Kucera
of Slovakia downed France's Jerome Golmard 7-5, 6-3, 6-0, and No.
12 Jonas Bjorkman of Sweden beat American Jonathan Stark 6-2,
6-3, 6-1.

<P>
CANBERRA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Australian newspapers Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Australian:
</P>
<P>
-- The Australian government is about to make major political

claw back support in the bush and among women voters.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald:
</P>
<P>
-- The federal government is poised to spend 230 million
Australian dollars (131.1 million U.S. dollars) to boost the
amount specialist doctors receive from medicare as new statistics

Australian dollars (0.57 million U.S. dollars) a year in public
money.
</P>
<P>
The Age:

<HEADLINE> Australian, U.S. Study Finds Lead Risk in Mothers' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Lead which has accumulated in
a woman's bones can be released during pregnancy and transfered to
breast milk during lactation, according to the result of an
Australian and U.S. study released here Friday.
</P>
<P>
That can cause increased exposures for breast-fed infants whose
mothers have a long-term history of lead exposure, the Australia's
Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization
(CSIRO) said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The study, by Australian and American scientists, appeared in
the latest on-line version of the October issue of Environmental
Health Perspectives, the monthly journal of the National Institute
of Environmental Health Sciences.
</P>
<P>
"Breast feeding is still an important option for healthy
mothers," said Brian Gulson, a CSIRO toxicologist.
</P>
<P>
"Breast-fed infants are only at risk if the mother has been
previously exposed to high concentration of lead from external
sources such as leaded paint, pottery, or, in many other
countries, industrial sources and leaded gasoline."
</P>
<P>
Excessive lead is harmful to the development of children's
health, particularly to their intelligence development.
</P>
<P>
Previous research has demonstrated that lead is stored in
bones, but scientists could not quantify its release into the
blood and other bodily fluids.
</P>
<P>
To answer the question, the Australian and U.S. scientists
compared second-generation Australian women with women who had
migrated to Australia from Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
Lead found in Eastern Europe has a slightly different atomic
weight from lead found in Australia, so scientists were able to
differentiate between skeletal lead deposits that had accumulated
from the immigrants' earlier exposures while in their native
country, and more recent exposure.
</P>
<P>
Earlier data from the same study had shown that as much as
40-70 percent of the blood lead in pregnant women can come from
lead that has accumulated in the bones.
</P>
<P>
Because the study participants' blood lead concentrations were
relatively low, most had values less than 5 micrograms lead per
deciliter of blood and the lead concentrations in their breast
milk were also low, 0.7 parts per billion on average.
</P>
<P>
These concentrations were not significantly different from
those found in various kinds of infant formulae.
</P>
<P>
In spite of these low concentrations, the researchers found a
strong correlation between the amount of lead in the mothers' milk
samples and the corresponding blood lead levels of the infants.
</P>
<P>
Calculations based on the first 60 to 90 days postpartum
indicated that 36-80 percent of the infants' total blood lead was
coming from breast milk or formula.
</P>
<P>
The study also produced preliminary evidence suggesting that
calcium supplementation can have a protective effect by slowing
the release of lead from skeletal stores.
</P>
<P>
The Australian researchers are planning additional studies to
determine calcium's effectiveness in pregnant and nursing mothers.

<HEADLINE> Latin American Economic News Briefs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The following are the
major economic news briefs from Latin American countries for the
past few days:
</P>
<P>
BRASILIA -- Brazil has been losing an average of one billion
dollars a day from its international reserves in the last two
weeks, which amounted to more than 70 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The "Folha de Sao Paulo" newspaper reported Thursday that these
reserves are now a little above 60 billion dollars, so the
Brazilian government is bound to adopt stronger measures to
contain the depletion of its international reserves.
</P>
<P>
CARACAS -- The investment foreseen for the next ten years in
the Pequiven Petrochemicals firm business plan will be 8.3 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The firm could expand its capital, according to the law, by
going public in the stock market for the development of the
projects including the production of fertilizer, methanol,
oleofines, and their byproducts.
</P>
<P>
The Venezuelan petrochemical industry is the third source of
hard currency in the industrial field and represents 15 percent of
the non-oil exports.
</P>
<P>
SANTIAGO -- Chile's unemployment rate reached 6.4 percent
during the May-July 1998 period, according to data from the
National Statistics Institute.
</P>
<P>
Unemployment in the 15-19 years olds range was three times
the national index (20.3 percent).
</P>
<P>
The sectors with the highest range of unemployment were gas,
electricity, water, mines and manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
MEXICO CITY -- The Interamerican Development Bank (IADB) since
opening business has invested some 70 billion dollars in
development projects in 26 Latin American countries, said its
representative in Mexico Bolivar Santacruz.
</P>
<P>
According to the representative, Mexico has received 12 billion
dollars in credits for development projects in water, drainage and
electrification. The IADB will grant Mexico loans worth 900
million dollars.

<HEADLINE> Tight Security in Place for Athletics World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Security at the
athletics World Cup to be held in Johannesburg next week will be
the biggest operation of its kind mounted for a sporting event in
South Africa,South African officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Nobody need to worry about his or her security at the World
Cup as tight security measures are being taken to ensure the
safety of all athletes and spectators, a top security official of
the Gauteng province, where Johannesburg is located, said.
</P>
<P>
Local police will join hands with national police and defense
force in the operation, which will be controlled from a center
within the Johannesburg Stadium, the venue of the competition.
</P>
<P>
Medical, traffic and private security people will also be
under command of the controlling center.
</P>
<P>
Many of the world's leading track and field stars will
participate in the eighth International Amateur Athletics
Federation (IAAF) World Cup in Athletics from September 11 to 13.
</P>
<P>
But worries have been voiced over the security of competitors
after a bomb blast in a Cape Town restaurant last week, which
claimed two lives and left 26 injured.
</P>
<P>
Adding to the fears are a string of bomb scares which have
been received during the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) summit
currently under way in Durban, a seaport in eastern South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The United States Athletics Federation, concerned about the
safety of its team, is reportedly considering a withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Danie Malan, chairman of the event's coordinating committee,
said a safe World Cup must be guaranteed as it would affect other
sporting bodies' decisions when considering bringing events to
South Africa.
</P>
<P>
"The eyes of the sporting world will be on the World Cup...The
events next week will influence other sporting institutions which
may be looking at staging major international tournaments in
South Africa,such as the World Cup soccer," Malan said.
</P>
<P>
South Africa is one of the favorite candidates expected to
host the 2006 World Cup soccer. Germany and Britain are also
bidding to host the event.

<HEADLINE> Hoddle Stalls on Contract Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 3 (Xinhua) -- England manager Glenn Hoddle
told the Football Association (FA) that he wanted to delay talks
on extending his contract.
</P>
<P>
Hoddle's current contract runs until the European
Championships and the FA want him to agree an extension until the
World Cup in 2002.
</P>
<P>
FA chairman Keith Wiseman confirmed: "Glenn has said he does
not want to talk at the moment.
</P>
<P>
"Glenn's perspective, which is one I can understand very
easily,is that `I'm not sure whether I want to make a final de
cision about it now when it's still got two years to go'."
</P>
<P>
Hoddle is in the middle of a rocky period as England coach.
The row over his controversial World Cup Diary had only just died
down when he came in for criticism in another book, written by
Arsenal's England defender Tony Adams.
</P>
<P>
The England team flew off to Sweden on Thursday ahead of their
first European Championship qualifier in Stockholm on
Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Red Card Given to Breakaway Super League </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The breakaway European Super
League was given a red card on Thursday when England's 20 Premier
League clubs agreed unanimously that any new European League
should be run under the auspices of UEFA, European soccer's gover
ning body.
</P>
<P>
The English clubs also expressed doubt that the financial plan
outlined by Media Partners, the organisation promoting the new
league,was viable. They said that any future negotiations would
be carried out by the premier league and not by individual clubs.
</P>
<P>
Manchester United, Liverpool and Arsenal had been in
discussion with Media Partners as recently as Monday.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of Media Partners and Gerhard Aigner, UEFA's
general secretary, addressed a meeting of the premier league
clubs' chairmen on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Chief executive Peter Leaver said afterwards: "The meeting
listened very carefully to both presentations and noted the
points made.
</P>
<P>
"There was clear, unanimous opposition to the suggestion of a
breakaway but it was agreed that reform of the European club
competitions was needed.
</P>
<P>
"The clubs stressed that playing under the current governing
bodies was very important and that the future of the European
competitions would be through UEFA."
</P>
<P>
The clubs also rejected the central tenet of Media
Partners'plan that half of the 36 Super League clubs would be
guaranteed a place for three years based on their performance
during the last 10 years.
</P>
<P>
"The meeting stressed the importance of the integrity of
domestic competitions and were absolutely firm on the need for
European qualification to be based on sporting merit from the
previous season only," said Leaver.
</P>
<P>
Rodolfo Hecht, head of Media Partners, said on Wednesday that
the new league would triple the income of participating teams.
</P>
<P>
But Leaver said he had "very grave doubts" about their ability
to generate those figures.
</P>
<P>
Premier league spokesman Mike Lee added that the clubs "were
not convinced" by the answers given by Media Partners to
questions about its financial model.
</P>
<P>
Despite the reservations, however, Leaver said the clubs
accepted that there were going to be major changes in European
competition.
</P>
<P>
In something of a contradiction to his earlier statement, he
said: "We are not ruling anything in and not ruling anything
out. We have a blank piece of paper."
</P>
<P>
The clubs said they would now await the report of UEFA's Task
Force, of which Leaver is a member.
</P>
<P>
The Task Force will make an initial report to UEFA's executive
committee meeting on October 6 with a view to preparing a
concrete proposal by the next meeting on December 10.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Media Partners had a different view of the
meeting, saying: "The premier league was very keen to become
involved in the European Football League project.
</P>
<P>
"This is the clubs' project and we are delighted to welcome
the premier league into the discussions."

<HEADLINE> US Reports Rapid Reduction of Land Mines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The number of land mines
worldwide has declined rapidly thanks to international efforts,
leading to an expectation that the world could get rid of it in
years rather than decades, the United States State Department said
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In a report entitled "Hidden Killers 1998: The Global Landmine
Crisis," the State Department said more accurate information shows
that the number of land mines is 30 to 50 percent fewer than
originally projected. Initial estimates put the number at 100
million.

<HEADLINE> Study Finds European Executives Wary of E-commerce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, September 3 (Xinhua) -- In a study of European senior
executives released Wednesday, a global consulting organization has
found the greatest barrier to the continent's success in the emerging
electronic economy is a hesitancy among the business leaders there.
</P>
<P>
According to Andersen Consulting, despite their enthusiasm for the
future potential of e-commerce, European executives are still standing
on the sidelines, jeopardizing the continent's long-term
competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
In a survey of more than 300 European senior executives between
December 1997 and July 1998, Andersen found only 39 percent are taking
steps to incorporate e-commerce into their current operations and
strategies, although 82 percent of them believe that e-commerce will
have a strategic impact on their businesses in the future.
Furthermore, only 19 percent of them regard e-commerce as a serious
competitive threat to their business today.
</P>
<P>
Andersen suggested several causes for the hesitation. Half of
respondents blamed a lack of consumer understanding about e-commerce.
A majority see privacy, security and the lack of regulatory framework
as key barriers. More than 80 percent cite the need for governments to
work together for a common international framework.
</P>
<P>
Still, the study identified several European advantages in Net
commerce, including the broad use of smart cards -- credit card-sized
plastic cards with a computer chip embedded. Smart cards are seen as
both a security device and a way to store personal data or electronic
cash. Andersen also cites Europe's lead in use of digital mobile
telephone and a strong position in e-commerce applications for digital
TV and Web phones.
</P>
<P>
The burgeoning worldwide potential for e-commerce is obvious,
Andersen said in the report. In the past five years, it said, the
Internet has surged from a network of 3 million predominately
U.S.-based users to a commercial mass medium with more than 100
million users worldwide, including more than 25 million across Europe.
Worldwide e-commerce is currently estimated at about 10 billion U.S.
dollars and is expected to reach 500 billion dollars by 2002.
</P>
<P>
Urging quick action, Andersen outlined recommendations for both the
European governments and the private sector.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Andersen said, European governments need to work with
businesses to create a regulatory regime that facilitates global
e-commerce, encourages new venture capital markets, adopts e-commerce
itself, ensure adequate training and retraining, and promotes
-commerce with both business and the public.

<HEADLINE> Senate Democrat Calls Clinton's Behavior "Immoral" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Democratic Senator Joseph
Lieberman on Thursday called U.S. President Bill Clinton's
behavior in the Monica Lewinsky scandal "immoral," but said
Congress should withhold action on it until the full story is
known.
</P>
<P>
In a Senate floor speech Lieberman said Clinton's behavior was
"immoral," "harmful" and deserves public rebuke.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Lieberman said it is premature for Congress
to take any action before Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr
submits a report to lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
"While the legal process moves forward, it is important that we
provide the president with the time and space and support he needs
to carry out his most important duties and protect our national
interest and security," said Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
"The conduct the president admitted to that night was serious
and his assumption of responsibility inadequate," Lieberman said
of Clinton's August 17 nationally televised confession of his
affair with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
Lieberman said Clinton's behavior may have "jeopardized his
administration's historic record of accomplishment."

<HEADLINE> Attorney General Reviewing Clinton Campaign-Finance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Attorney General Janet
Reno is reviewing whether to seek an independent counsel to
investigate fund-raising activities in President Bill Clinton's
re-election campaign in 1996, Justice Department officials said on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Reno is specifically considering whether so-called issue ads
televised during Clinton's 1996 campaign violated federal
campaign-spending laws and limits.
</P>
<P>
"There is a review of new information regarding issue advocacy
in the 1996 election," Justice Department spokesman Bert
Brandenburg said of the almost two-year White House fund-raising
allegation.
</P>
<P>
Republicans in the Senate have charged that Clinton and his top
political aides controlled the 44 million dollars in advertising
that was paid for by the Democratic Party, but was aimed at
advancing Clinton's re-election effort, circumventing the spending
limits on individual campaigns.
</P>
<P>
At a weekly Justice Department news conference, Reno said, "All
I can say is we have new information that I cannot comment on."
</P>
<P>
James Kennedy, a spokesman for the White House counsel's
office, defended the use of the issue ads as "entirely legal and
appropriate."
</P>
<P>
He said, "The ads focused on real issues before Congress and
the American people and they made clear the differences between
Democrats and Republicans on balancing the budget, Medicare,
welfare and other policy concerns. They were cleared by legal
counsel."
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Kennedy said, "There was no violation of
campaign spending limits. We are confident that, at the end of its
review, the Justice Department will arrive at a fair conclusion
based on the facts and the law."
</P>
<P>
Democrats have complained that Robert Dole's presidential
campaign and the Republican Party in 1996 used similar tactics to
get around federal spending limits.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the review focused only on the Democrats or
covered the Republicans as well, Reno replied, "We're following
every lead."
</P>
<P>
Reno, who has been under immense political pressure from
Republicans in Congress to hand over the investigation to an
independent counsel, said she would make her decision based on
what the law requires.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Leaves Northern Ireland for Dublin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
wound up a whirlwind morale-boosting tour of Northern Ireland and
left for Dublin Thursday night to continue his visit to the Irish
Republic.
</P>
<P>
Before he started off, Clinton was given a rapturous reception
by thousands in the ancient cathedral town of Armagh, the
spiritual home of Irish Protestants and Catholics alike.
</P>
<P>
He said the province's achievement in drawing a line under
three decades of sectarian bloodshed was a beacon for other areas
of conflict from the Middle East to the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
"When I go now to other trouble spots, I point to you as proof
that peace is not an idle daydream. For your peace is real. It
resonates around the world and echoes in the ears of people hungry
for an end to strife in their own countries," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
An impassioned Clinton said his message to politicians locked
in seemingly intractable conflicts was the same the world over:
"Do not tell me it has to be this way -- look at Northern
Ireland... a new day has dawned!"
</P>
<P>
Clinton and his wife Hillary, accompanied by British Prime
Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie, earlier visited Omagh to
meet with survivors and relatives of those killed by the bomb on
August 15. Twenty-eight died and 220 injured in the deadliest
atrocity in Northern Ireland's 30-year conflict.
</P>
<P>
While in Omagh, Clinton unveiled a black-draped golden plaque
commemorating the dead.
