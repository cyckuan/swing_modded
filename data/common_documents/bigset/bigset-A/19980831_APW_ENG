Japan's industrial output resumes fall in July; retail sales down
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ In the latest sign of Japan's economic troubles,
production at the nation's factories and mines in July slipped 0.8
percent from June, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry
said Monday.
	   The decline was greater than forecast by economists surveyed by
Dow Jones Newswires, who projected on average that industrial
production would decline 0.4 percent compared with the prior month.
The figures were adjusted for seasonal factors.
	   A month earlier, output rose 1.7 percent, the first gain in four
months.
	   In the latest report, the ministry said production would likely
remain on a declining trend as manufacturers focus on reducing
inventories of unsold goods.
	   The ministry forecast output would fall 0.4 percent in August
from July, although it said production would rise 2.5 percent in
September.
	   Japan is suffering its worst recession in decades amid a
stubborn slump in consumer demand and growing worries about the
health of the country's debt-ridden banks.
	   In another sign of economic weakness, the ministry announced
Monday that retail sales fell 3.7 percent in July from a year
earlier to 12.02 trillion yen (dlrs 85.1 billion), the 16th
straight month of declines.
	   Falls were recorded in all categories of goods in July,
including a 6.4 percent dip in car sales and a 4.8 percent decline
in sales of electronics.
	   Wholesale sales dropped 4 percent in July from a year earlier to
40.67 trillion yen (dlrs 288 billion), marking the ninth straight
month of declines.
	   Meanwhile, sales at Japan's major department stores and
supermarkets, adjusted for changes in the number of stores, fell
3.9 percent in July from a year earlier.
	   Department store sales have fallen in all but one month since
April 1997.

Loader back in form for Commonwealth Games
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ New Zealand's dual Olympic swim
champion Danyon Loader is approaching his best form in time for a
showdown with his Australian rivals at the Commonwealth Games
starting Sept. 11.
	   Loader won the 200- and 400-meter freestyle double at the
Atlanta Olympics but will face two in-form Australian world
champions, Michael Klim (200) and Ian Thorpe (400), at the Kuala
Lumpur Games.
	   Loader missed the world championships this year, where Klim was
outstanding as swimmer of the meet. But last weekend Loader broke
two national shortcourse records and swam the second-fastest
400-meter of his career.
	   ``The Aussies are a bit quicker, but once you're at the games,
it's all even-stevens,'' national coach Mark Bone said of Loader's
prospects. ``Times count for nothing. His times at Atlanta were not
the fastest in Olympic history, but they still won the gold medals.
	   ``I have no doubts the Aussies will be worried. Danyon Loader at
his best always makes the Aussies worried. And that's a fact. And
he's back to his best.''
	   Loader's shortcourse 800-meter record of 7 minutes, 53.12
seconds walloped his own time of 7:56.54, set more than five years
ago.

Four ex-prime ministers sign anti-racism open letter
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Australia-Election

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Four former prime ministers signed an
open letter Monday urging voters to put candidates supporting
racism last in the Oct. 3 national election.
	   It made no direct reference to Pauline Hanson's new right-wing
populist One Nation party, which urges a cutoff in Asian
immigration and welfare for Aborigines.
	   The letter _ signed by Gough Whitlam, Malcolm Fraser, Bob Hawke
and Paul Keating _ said racism was destructive and did Australia
significant harm.
	   ``Racism is an unmitigated evil, it is immoral, it does
Australia significant harm through Asia and in the wider world,''
the letter said.
	   ``We know that politicians have to be pragmatic on many issues.
They often need to adjust policy to take into account differing
views,'' it said.
	   The letter went on to say: ``Racism however is a different
matter, it is beyond compromise. Once it becomes part of the body
politic it grows and it spreads in violent and tragic ways.''
	   The letter also said there was no place for racism in a diverse
multicultural society enriched by contributions by people from all
corners of the Earth.
	   ``We ask you not to forget the racist debates that have grown in
Australia in recent times,'' it said.
	   ``At this election everyone has the opportunity to demonstrate
that there is no room for racist politics in Australia.
	   ``We therefore urge you to put any candidate supporting any
element of racism last in the election both to the Senate and the
House of Representatives,'' the letter said.
	   Three of the former prime ministers _ Whitlam, Hawke and Keating
_ headed Labor governments, while Fraser served under the Liberal
Party.

Report: Thailand's top crime boss wants top Cabinet post for son
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's reputed top crime boss says
he is being courted by the Democrat Party of Prime Minister Chuan
Leekpai, the Bangkok Post reported Monday.
	   Somchai Khunpluem _ known widely as Kamnan Poh _ told the paper,
however, that he would remain loyal to the Chart Thai (Thai Nation)
party as long as his son Sonthaya is one of the top five candidates
for a Cabinet post after the next election.
	   A Democrat Party spokesman could not immediately be reached for
comment.
	   Kamnan Poh's son is already deputy communications minister as a
member of Chart Thai. The party, led by former Prime Minister
Banharn Silpa-archa, is part of the coalition government.
	   If Sonthaya were one of the party's top five candidates, and the
party was included in the next coalition government, he would most
probably be a full minister.
	   No election is scheduled before 2000, but no elected Thai
government has ever completed its term of office.
	   Kamnan Poh is based in the city of Chonburi, 70 kilometers (44
miles) south of Bangkok, in Thailand's industrial heartland. He
claims to have more than half a million supporters, the paper said.
	   Attempts to imprison him on various charges have failed. He
reportedly runs a criminal empire that controls gambling,
prostitution and smuggling in the area.
	   He revels in his reputation as a godfather, and has made an
autobiographical movie in which he starred as himself.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Four Israeli military personnel were injured
early Monday when their helicopter missed its landing-pad in south
Lebanon, hit the ground nearby and overturned, the army spokesman
said.
	   The American-manufactured Bell-206 was bringing two soldiers to
an Israeli strong point in the strip of land which Israel occupies
in south Lebanon to protect its northern border against attacks by
Lebanese and Palestinian guerrillas.
	   The pilot and co-pilot and the two soldiers were injured. One of
them suffered medium injuries. The others were lightly injured, a
hospital official said.
	   The accident happened at night and its cause has not yet been
established, the army spokesman said.

Big tumble in Hong Kong, as Asia's markets begin another week
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos Planned
 &UR; By THOMAS WAGNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO _ After last week's global stock market rout, Hong Kong
stocks opened sharply lower Monday, but other key indexes in Asia
either rose or remained fairly stable, despite more bad news about
Russia's economic and political stability.
	   After only seven minutes of trading in Hong Kong, the blue-chip
Hang Seng Index was down 5.7 percent, or 443.14 points, to
7,386.60.
	   But on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, where the benchmark 225-issue
Nikkei Stock Average had sunk to a 12-year low Friday, stock prices
rose moderately, gaining 87.02 points, or 0.63 percent, to close
the morning session at 14,002.65.
	   And in Singapore, where the benchmark index had crashed through
the crucial 900-point level for the first time in more than 10
years Friday, shares opened only slightly lower. The 55-stock
Straits Times Index was at 882.39, down only 2.87 points.
	   ``Given the big falls we had last week, world markets may be
taking a breather. But generally, the fundamentals in Japan and
Asia as a whole remain bleak,'' Peter Morgan, a senior economist at
HSBC Securities Japan, Ltd., said in an interview.
	   Across Asia, Europe and the Americas stock markets fell by big
percentages last week. That left some people wondering if the
year-old Asian financial crisis, and the recessions it has caused
in regional powerhouses such as Japan and Hong Kong, could spread
to the West and sour its economies.
	   In the United States, the Dow Jones Industrial average dropped
357 points Thursday and 114.31 points Friday, leaving it at
8,051.68. That shrank 1998's gain to 1.8 percent. At July's peak,
the Dow had been up 18.1 percent.
	   To make matters worse, the ruble recently collapsed in Russia,
setting off political and economic instability there.
	   On Saturday, Russia's new acting prime minister, Viktor
Chernomyrdin, began negotiating a power-sharing agreement with the
Russian parliament and reassured markets around the world that the
country would not return to a Soviet-style economy.
	   But on Sunday, hours after the interim government and
parliamentary leaders agreed to a tentative, 18-month truce that
would leave President Boris Yeltsin in control and give the
administration time to try to end the crisis, the agreement
appeared to collapse after the Communists rejected it.
	   In Hong Kong on Monday, the Hang Seng Index seemed to fall
sharply because the government has reduced its role in trading.
	   For two weeks, Hong Kong's government had been buying stocks to
drive the Hang Seng Index to a level at which speculators who bet
on stock prices falling would lose money.
	   On Friday, that aggressive government buying pushed trading
volume to a record U.S. dlrs 10.1 billion. Traders estimated the
government spent dlrs U.S. 9.1 billion.
	   Although the stock market still closed 1.2 percent lower Friday
at 7,829.74 points, the prolonged intervention has lifted the main
index 1,200 points higher than two weeks ago.
	   Traders said the authorities had spent about 15 percent of the
territory's U.S. dlrs 96 billion reserves in punishing speculators
and protecting the territory's currency.
	   On Monday, speculators suddenly found it more expensive to bet
against Hong Kong markets because of new measures taken by the
Futures Exchange over the weekend to curb manipulation.
	   On Saturday, the futures exchange announced it would require
market players to come up with more cash when buying or selling
more than 10,000 futures contracts.
	   In addition, it is now requiring members to report and identify
anyone holding 250 contracts or more. Previously, the reporting
level had been 500 contracts, and market players could remain
anonymous.
	   Even though stocks prices seemed far more stable in Tokyo and
Singapore on Monday, signs of gloominess and fear about the world's
economic future also remained high in some areas.
	   ``I'm worried,'' said Kazuomi Kobayashi, a 52-year-old Tokyo
barber who dabbles in stocks.
	   Standing in front of a large electronic board in downtown Tokyo
showing the latest Nikkei numbers, he said: ``I've lost so much.
When I buy, it goes down. When I buy again, it goes down again.''
	   Kobayashi said he hoped the market will recover in the next few
years but predicted the Nikkei could first fall as low as 13,000.
	   ``This is bad. It gives me the shudders,'' said Masao Sakata,
52, a businessman also watching the blinking minus signs on the
board at Wako Securities Co. near Tokyo's main train station.
	   Even in Singapore, where newspapers often work with the
government to keep people calm, signs of panic prevailed.
	   ``World markets sent reeling: World faces global meltdown as its
leaders fail to find solutions to Russia's worsening crisis,'' said
the front-page headline in Saturday's The Straits Times.
	   ``Fear of complete meltdown rules markets,'' said a headline in
The Business Times on Monday over R. Sivanithy's column.
	   In Hong Kong's bustling financial district, many people stopped
at interactive terminals to check their shares on the Hang Seng.
	   One man said the government's recent intervention in Hong Kong's
markets had left it nearly impossible for people to know their real
value and whether to buy or sell shares.

Cambodian king urges end to demonstrations against Hun Sen
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ King Norodom Sihanouk urged dialogue
between rival political leaders Monday in a bid to end daily
anti-government protests he said were bringing shame to the nation.
	   The plea came one day after opposition politician Sam Rainsy led
15,000 protesters in a march through the streets of Phnom Penh.
Rainsy and his supporters are calling for the ouster of strongman
Hun Sen, whom they accuse of fraud in July 26 national elections.
	   The nonviolent rallies ``have prompted members of the
international community and our foreign friends to strongly scorn
us and to lose any intention to help Cambodia any more,'' Sihanouk
said by fax.
	   ``For our impoverished people they will remain poorer and more
miserable,'' he wrote. ``I wish to beg our politicians to use
brotherly negotiation in solving the differences and to please
rescue our nation from sinking.''
	   Sunday's march capped a round-the-clock vigil by thousands of
protesters outside the National Assembly. The sit-in entered its
eighth day Monday.
	   The protest nearly turned violent Sunday when a statue of
Vietnamese soldiers _ who occupied the country from 1979 to 1989 _
was smashed and burned. The monument was built to commemorate
Vietnamese-Cambodian friendship.
	   Though Vietnam's invasion drove the genocidal Khmer Rouge from
power, many Cambodians regard their neighbors with suspicion and
hate. Hun Sen came to power during the harsh occupation and many
consider him too pro-Hanoi.
	   The king said renewed violence will ``cause further division
within society pushing it into deeper political, economic and
social crisis.''
	   Opposition leaders Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy
refuse to accept Hun Sen's official victory in last months polls.
	   The campaign was marred by violence and intimidation against
their supporters, and they say there were hundreds of voting and
counting irregularities.
	   The Hun Sen-packed National Election Committee has rejected
their charges. The Constitutional Council, the country's highest
appeals body, also stacked with Hun Sen's supporters, was
deliberating Monday morning.
	   Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party won a slight majority with 64
of the 122 National Assembly seats in last month's polls, not
enough for the two-thirds needed to form a new government.
	   Ranariddh and the Sam Rainsy Party have threatened to boycott
the assembly and have refused offers for their parties to join a
coalition, meaning Cambodia could have no legal government when the
assembly meets for the first time Sept. 24.
	   Hun Sen deposed Ranariddh as co-prime minister last year in a
bloody coup. The prince won U.N.-sponsored elections in 1993, but
Hun Sen muscled his way into a tense coalition by threatening civil
war.

Scientists warn on new ozone layer threat from halon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Australian scientists said Monday
they are mystified by the rapid rise of an ozone-destroying
chemical in the atmosphere which threatens to delay the recovery of
the Earth's precious ozone layer.
	   Measurements of pristine air collected at the Bureau of
Meteorology's Cape Grim baseline air pollution station in northwest
Tasmania found a five-fold jump in the level of halon-1202 in the
atmosphere since the late 1970s.
	   During the past two years, the atmospheric concentration of
halon-1202 had grown 17 percent a year, Paul Fraser of Australia's
federal science agency said.
	   ``The international community will have to consider extending
the ban on production of halons to halon-1202 if we are to protect
the ozone layer,'' Fraser said.
	   Fraser said the source of the new halon remained a mystery,
speculating the gas could be a by-product of inefficient production
of other halons in developing countries.
	   Some countries might also be manufacturing halon-1202 for
military applications, he said.
	   Halon-1202 has an ozone-depletion potential of about half that
of common chlorofluorocarbons.
	   But unlike other halons used in the past for fire fighting,
halon-1202 was not controlled by the Montreal Protocol -- which
gives developing countries until 2010 to completely phase out halon
production.
	   Fraser said measurements showed most chlorofluorocarbons were
slowing down their atmospheric growth rate, had stabilized in the
atmosphere or were even dropping in concentration.
	   This meant ozone recovery was likely to be detected in the next
10 to 20 years.
	   ``However, continued emissions of halons will delay this
recovery,'' he said.
	   The ozone layer, located about 15 miles (24 km) above the Earth,
is a shield against the sun's deadly ultraviolet radiation.
	   A thinning ozone layer can let in enough UV light to cause skin
cancers and cataracts.

Carroll facing sanctions over Games withdrawal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Nicky Carroll, the winner of this
year's Paris women's marathon, is facing sanctions over a decision
to withdraw from Australia's team for the Commonwealth Games
starting Sept. 11.
	   Carroll, selected after winning the Paris marathon in April in
an impressive time of two hours, 27 minutes, 06 seconds, said she
did not want to compete in Kuala Lumpur because of fears over high
heat and humidity.
	   Carroll, 26, was rated a gold medal favorite for the Games
marathon but said she has liver and kidney problems from an
accident when she was 18 and suffers when she becomes even slightly
dehydrated.
	   ``I haven't really wanted to go at all,'' Carroll told The Age
newspaper. ``I realize I should have made up my mind a lot earlier,
but there was so much pressure from people saying `you should run
the Commonwealth Games', and I didn't.
	   ``I didn't want to let anyone down, but I'm just not confident
about it.''
	   Carroll will be barred from running another marathon in
September and might also have her funding from the Australian
Institute of Sport (AIS) reassessed.
	   ``I'll lose my scholarship,'' Carroll said. ``I obviously won't
get selected for another Australian team.''
	   Carroll said she would have to live with any further
consequences and accepted her decision might cost her selection in
Australia's team for the 2000 Olympics.
	   AIS distance coach Dick Telford said he tried to convince
Carroll that the conditions in KL would not be as bad as she
imagined.
	   Telford said Carroll was concerned that running in KL could
drain her for future races.
	   ``Everyone's telling me I can win the gold medal but I'm just so
negative about running in the hot and humid conditions of KL,''

Sabotage suspected in train crash, 7 killed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Suspecting sabotage, Sri Lanka's
railroad authority ordered an inquiry Monday into a collision
between two passenger trains that killed seven people and left 20
injured.
	   Initial investigations into Sunday's accident at Mirigama, about
50 kilometers (30 miles) northeast of Colombo, indicated tampering
with the rail track, the general manager of the railways, W.K.B.
Weragama, was quoted as saying by The Island newspaper.
	   It was the second incident in one month on Sri Lanka's small
rail system, which has just 1,200 kilometers (750 miles) of track.
In late July, a bomb derailed a train in the tea-growing mountains
of central Sri Lanka. Most of the 40 passengers in the seven-car
train escaped with minor injuries. No one claimed responsibility.
	   Sri Lankan security officials had warned of infiltration into
the central district by the Liberation Tiger of Tamil Eelam, a
Tamil rebel group fighting for the secession of Tamil majority
areas in northern and eastern Sri Lanka.
	   Tamils in the tea estates, who migrated from India, are not
generally involved in the separatist insurrection, but their area
has witnessed increasing bomb attacks. At least five telephone
exchanges have been damaged in attacks in the last two months.

Major bank to turn to Toyota, Mitsui for help
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS to LEAD with press conference, details of plan to
strengthen bank

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Sakura Bank Ltd. is asking major shareholders for
an emergency infusion of more than 300 billion yen (U.S. dlrs 2.1
billion) in new capital to rescue its international reputation and
help it pay for losses on bad loans.
	   Sakura, a major Japanese lender, is negotiating to sell that
amount in new shares to Toyota Motor Corp. and members of the
Mitsui group of companies, Sakura Bank President Akishige Okada
said on Monday.
	   The capital infusion would strengthen the bank's financial
standing and help it meet requirements to continue operating
abroad.
	   Moody's Investors Service cut its credit rating on Sakura three
months ago, citing worries about its dwindling capital.
	   Along with the share sale, the bank may also drastically reduce
operations in the United States and Europe and instead ``increase
its weight'' in Southeast Asia, Okada said.
	   Sakura Bank is at the core of the Mitsui group of companies,
which includes Toyota, Mitsui Real Estate and Mitsui Life
Insurance. Many of the firms are already among Sakura's biggest
shareholders and most important customers and would therefore have
a strong interest in helping the bank.
	   The move comes as Japan is scrambling to put together a plan to
clean up its debt-ridden financial system.
	   The private-sector initiative seemed likely to be welcomed by
Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's government which has struggled to win
acceptance for a plan to use public money to bail out the troubled
Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd.
	   Sakura Bank has been in talks with Toyota and the other
companies since the end of July about the capital infusion but the
companies have yet to decide whether they will take part, Okada
said.
	   Along with the call for capital, the bank is also considering
speeding up restructuring efforts, including writing off more bad
loans than planned this year.
	   The bank hopes the measures will boost its credit rating and
raise its capital adequacy ratio _ the bank's capital divided by
its outstanding loans _ to 10 percent within two years, Okada said.
International banking rules require a capital ratio of at least 8
percent. Sakura's ratio as of March 31 was 9.12 percent.

Russian parliament to consider Chernomyrdin nomination
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: PMs. UPDATES throughout &QL; 
 &UR; By BARRY RENFREW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia faced more political chaos Monday as the
hard-line opposition said it would block the approval of a new
prime minister after a proposed political truce with Boris Yeltsin
collapsed.
	   With the Russian economy crumbling, key parliamentary groups,
led by the Communists, rejected the proposed agreement Sunday that
would have paved the way for 18 months of political peace.
	   The breakdown appeared likely to usher in a period of political
head-butting and bargaining similar to the one that surrounded the
nomination of the previous prime minister, Sergei Kiriyenko, last
spring. This time, though, the economic situation is substantially
worse.
	   Government and opposition leaders had agreed on a pact earlier
Sunday under which parliament would approve the new government and
give it a chance to solve the economic crisis. In return, President
Yeltsin was to give parliament a bigger role in approving the
Cabinet.
	   Within hours, however, Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov had
backed off, saying his party's leadership could not support the
pact because there was no firm guarantee Yeltsin would abide by its
provisions. He said the Communists would vote against confirming
acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin.
	   Under the constitution, the lower house of parliament, the State
Duma, can vote three times on a prime minister's nomination. In the
case of Kiriyenko, the Communist-led Duma twice voted no, then
caved in on the third vote after trying to wrest concessions from
the government.
	   Zyuganov kept up his rhetorical pressure on Yeltsin on Sunday,
telling the television program ``Itogi'': ``Let Yeltsin's family
convince him to resign and not to drag the entire country into the
grave by his bony hand.''
	   However, he did not rule out further talks on a power-sharing
agreement.
	   The nationalist Liberal Democratic Party joined the Communists
in vowing not to sign the deal, as did the social democratic
Yabloko party. Yabloko leaders had said from the start that they
wouldn't support Chernomyrdin's nomination.
	   The political stalemate couldn't come at a worse time for the
Russian government, which is trying to stabilize an economy that
has been seriously damaged by the devaluation of the national
currency, the ruble, and the government's default on its debts.
	   Chernomyrdin said swift formation of a new government was vital
to tackle the crisis.
	   ``We must resolve financial problems. The ruble is hanging by a
thread,'' he said. ``So if we have a political agreement and the
president accepts it _ let's start working.''
	   The proposed three-page agreement would have given the State
Duma, parliament's lower house, more say in Cabinet appointments,
but leave Yeltsin with substantial power, despite earlier
opposition calls for his removal.
	   In particular, the president would have retained control of the
security forces with the right to fill three key posts _ the
defense, foreign and interior ministries. In exchange, Yeltsin
would have agreed to Duma approval of most Cabinet appointments for
the first time, according to lawmakers and media reports.
	   The draft, which was not made public, would also have obliged
both sides to maintain a political truce. The Duma would not try to
vote the government out of power until parliament's term ends in
late 1999, while Yeltsin would not use his right to dissolve the
legislature _ although he apparently would not lose this power.
	   But the deal was on paper only and Yeltsin would have retained
his powers to dissolve the Duma.
	   The ruble appeared to gain Sunday and exchange points across
Moscow were buying U.S. dollars at an average 8 rubles, giving them
a value of 12.5 cents, down from an average 8.5 rubles to the
dollar the day before. The rate had been 6 rubles to the dollar
before the collapse.
	   There had been no immediate confirmation that Yeltsin would
accept the deal, even though it left him with a firm grip on power.
But he appeared reluctant to accept many of the provisions,
according to Russia media.

Russia's army sinks deeper into despair

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Within view of the Kremlin, two skinny, young
soldiers are panhandling on Moscow's upscale Tverskaya Street.
	   ``Spare some kopecks for cigarettes?'' asks 21-year-old Oleg
Derzhanov, palm thrust out unabashedly. ``What we get paid can't be
called money.''
	   Although it was unthinkable a few years ago, the sight of
soldiers begging on the streets has become so common that Russians
have become accustomed to it. Most trudge past without slowing.
	   Such is the state of an army that once patrolled a far-flung
empire. Officers routinely go months without wages. Small or late
paychecks are a part of Russia's military miseries, which include
inefficiency, corruption, draft-dodging, desertion, and thousands
of deaths every year from beatings, starvation, malnutrition or
suicide.
	   Now, with the government and the economy in disarray, conditions
could get worse.
	   Many wonder how much more the downtrodden military can take.
Will the economy's sudden meltdown be the catalyst for a rebellion,
even a takeover?
	   For now, the worst-case scenario for the world's No. 2 nuclear
power is unlikely
	   The military remains a political bystander, with no evident
interest in staging a coup or playing czar-maker in the struggle to
determine who rules Russia.
	   ``As far as an organized coup, that's pretty much impossible in
Russia. The military doesn't take part in domestic political
disputes,'' said Oksana Antonenko, a researcher at the
International Institute for Strategic Studies, an independent think
tank in London.
	   But experts say if the crisis drags on and the army's financial
state gets worse, the military could be drawn into the fray.
	   ``These conditions are very dangerous because they make the
armed forces more unstable, they loosen the lines of control,''
says Pavel Felgenhauer, a military analyst for the daily Segodnya.
	   ``It's like (Congolese President Laurent) Kabila's army, only
their soldiers have Kalashnikovs _ ours have nuclear weapons.''
	   Besides its nuclear stockpile, the military hasn't been much of
a force to be reckoned with since the fall of communism ended its
bottomless budget.
	   Pulled out of East Europe and the Baltics and humbled by a
ragtag army of separatist rebels in Chechnya, the Russian army has
been cut roughly in half to about 1.2 million personnel, the
London-based IISS estimates.
	   But the crippling lack of funds has created new chaos in the
transition to a smaller army.
	   The backlog of unpaid wages is soaring, the government has
failed to come through with much of the money it earmarked for the
military in the 1998 budget, and more than 150,000 military
personnel are still waiting for promised housing as part of their
retirement packages.
	   A delayed pension forced a retired lieutenant colonel in
fatigues and army cap to sell mushrooms displayed on a box on the
sidewalk.
	   ``Please buy something,'' said the man, who gave his name only
as Danil. ``I haven't received my military pension for three
months.''
	   In a one-man revolt, an army major took to the streets with a
tank last month in central Russia to protest the failure to pay
wages.
	   Military officials quickly came up with the cash to pay the
major and his whole unit. They have taken a similar approach with
the most elite troops, paying higher, prompt wages to special
forces in charge of nuclear weapons and others whose loyalty is
deemed critical.
	   But the ruble's collapse leaves that strategy in jeopardy.
	   ``If things continue deteriorating as fast as they have in the
past two weeks, if the collapse of banks and the economy is not
stopped, you could have some unrest involving the military,'' says
Alexander Pikayev, a military analyst at the Moscow branch of the
Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a U.S. think tank.
	   ``If this were the case, it could affect nuclear troops as
well.''
	   Russian tanks have already rolled twice in Moscow this decade.
Both times military loyalty turned the tide: the thwarting of a
hard-line coup attempt in 1991 and the crushing of a parliamentary
rebellion in 1993.
	   Mindful of those key alliances, the government reportedly is
taking steps to ensure that troops are both loyal and ready to take
part for the first time in quelling possible civil unrest.
	   Acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin has promised to pay
off back payments owed to the military, according to the Russian
media. He also reportedly agreed to take the job only after being
given control over the security forces.
	   In addition, Russian commentators note that President Boris
Yeltsin's recent visit to the Northern Fleet appeared to duplicate
a trip and strategy he employed before the 1993 showdown to secure
the army's backing.

HIV-positive footballer fights ban
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) - An amateur footballer who is
HIV-positive has taken legal action after being banned by his state
association because of his condition.
	   Matthew Hall, who plays Australian Rules football, is fighting a
ban by the Victorian Amateur Football Association in an
anti-discrimination tribunal.
	   An AIDS expert told the tribunal Monday that there was no
justification for the ban.
	   Professor John Dwyer, who is the medical director of Prince
Henry's Hospital in Sydney and head of medicine at the University
of New South Wales, told the tribunal he would advise football
coaches that the risk of an HIV-positive footballer infecting his
teammates was infinitesimal.
	   ``We're talking totally extraordinary odds,'' Dwyer told the
tribunal. ``I'm very comfortable with telling people who ask my
opinion that people with HIV should be allowed to play their code
of football.''
	   Dwyer said the World Health Organization had stated there was no
scientifically verified case of HIV being transmitted in a sporting
arena.
	   He said there was overwhelming evidence to show the vast
majority of infections occurred through sexual contact and the
sharing of needles.
	   Professor Dwyer said if Hall was denied the right to play
football it would have a detrimental impact on the inroads made in
public health policy since the AIDS virus was first detected in the
1980s.
	   ``The minute it's detrimental to come forward and be tested
because you run the risk of discrimination, you run the risk of
increasing the epidemic,'' Dwyer said.

Tents, lean-tos are home for many as floods surge again in China
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHARLES HUTZLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JIANLI, China (AP) _ For the 2,000 people living in tents on a
soggy field on the outskirts of this central city, Monday's new
crest on the nearby Yangtze River meant the beginning of the end of
China's summer floods was still nowhere in sight.
	   The floods that have devastated the Yangtze basin, China's
northeast and Tibet are not expected to recede for weeks. The
government estimates more than 3,000 people have died and 5 million
houses have been destroyed in the worst floods in decades.
	   ``About 85 percent of our house has been destroyed and all our
crops have been damaged,'' said Li Peixiang, 34, a woman housed in
one of about 40 government-issue blue tents that make up the camp.
Li was crowded into a tent about 12 by 5 feet (about 4 by 1.5
meters) with her two children and four other members of her
extended family.
	   Everyone in the camp had been evacuated from Xinzhou village on
Aug. 5 when government flood control officials ordered a secondary
embankment opened to divert floodwaters and relieve pressure on the
main Yangtze River dikes and protect the city of Wuhan.
	   Before they let the floodwater in, soldiers and police evacuated
11,000 people, 2,000 cattle, 16,000 pigs and some movable property,
said Xiao Renbai, mayor of Rongcheng city, which oversees Xinzhou.
	   Medical teams working in open-air clinics under umbrellas
dispensed medicines and bandaged wounds. They reported treating eye
infections, diarrhea and colds, but nothing more serious.
	   Farmers living in the refugee camp have some cooking pots,
bedrolls and not much else.
	   Dong Huisong, a farmer at the camp with his extended family of
seven, said most of the places in the village were under seven or
eight meters (about 20 feet) of water.
	   ``Our biggest worry is what will we do when we have to rebuild
our homes,'' he said. ``We'll have to rely on the government for
food, but they may not have enough money to help us with housing.''
	   Most of the evacuees said they had received adequate food and
water and some clothing, but did not expect to go home for a month.
	   Flood relief officials predicted the Yangtze would not reach
record heights in the eighth and latest flood crest raging
downstream this week. Water would be diverted into reservoirs on
tributaries to reduce the flow, state media reported.
	   In Hunan province, also in central China, more than 1 million
people have been evacuated, and about half of them are living in
tents, the China Daily reported Monday.
	   Tents and lean-tos also house evacuees in China's northeast,
where rare heavy flooding has left them unprepared for the far
north's early frost and sub-zero winter temperatures.
	   In Tuolihe Village, near the city of Qiqihar in Heilongjiang
province in the far northeast, the teacher at the village primary
school will greet children for the first day of classes in a large
tent with a sign saying ``xuexiao'' (school) over the door. A photo
in Monday's China Daily showed grinning children outside the tent
holding new books and supplies.
	   Soldiers and civilians stayed on alert on important dikes in the
flood zones to spot leaks and repair them. The dikes are especially
vulnerable now as the waters are going down because they have been
waterlogged for more than two months.
	   State television on Sunday night showed young soldiers in orange
life vests in rapidly flowing chest-high water as they struggled to
grip a rope strung across a breached dike. The soldiers were using
their bodies to try to hold back some of the flow while others
filled the gap with sandbags.

Dubious insurance may be linked to curry poisoning: Reports
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The mystery behind the deaths of four people from
arsenic-laced curry served at a community picnic has taken a
bizarre turn with the discovery of the same poison _ arsenic _ in
other illnesses that look suspiciously like insurance fraud.
	   The Mainichi newspaper reported Monday that 150 million yen
(dlrs 1 million) was paid from about 10 insurance companies to a
resident of the same town, where the curry-poisoning struck a July
25 summer festival.
	   Four people, including a 10-year-old boy, were killed and dozens
of people fell ill from the curry served at the event in Wakayama,
a coastal city 450 kilometers (300 miles) southwest of Tokyo.
	   The Mainichi said the alleged payments included 140 million yen
(dlrs 990,000) the resident received for the October 1996 death of
his relative from leukemia and about 10 million yen (dlrs 70,000)
for a 35-year-old man, who was hospitalized for arsenic-poisoning
separate from the curry-poisoning.
	   The insurance deals had been set up without that man's
knowledge, the Mainichi said.
	   The Asahi newspaper reported Monday that police were
investigating other such dubious insurance policies, totaling as
many as 16 people _ all made out to the same ``third party''
beneficiary.
	   The beneficiary is suspected of receiving several hundred
million yen (several million dollars) in insurance payments,
according to the Asahi.
	   Police refused to comment on the reports.
	   Although there has been nothing in the media reports that show a
direct connection between the curry poisoning and illnesses
involving the insurance, the reports stress that they happened in
the same region involving the same poison.
	   It is unclear whether anyone who ate the curry also had any
dubious insurance policies.
	   Japanese media reported earlier that two men suddenly fell sick
from arsenic-poisoning while visiting a home in Wakayama and that
both were covered by strange insurance policies.
	   For weeks, the nation has been riveted by the curry-poisoning.
	   Japan, a society that has relatively little crime, has been
shaken by the sheer idea that food served at a neighborhood event
may be unsafe. Some summer festivals were canceled.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ North Korean forces fired a ballistic missile
toward Japan on Monday, and it landed in the Sea of Japan, the
Japanese Defense Agency said.
	   Quoting unidentified U.S. military officials, the agency said
the missile was fired around noon (0300 gmt) and landed about half
way between North Korea and the coast of northwestern Japan.
	   No other information was immediately available. Japan's Foreign
Ministry, the U.S. military in Japan, and the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo
declined to comment, saying they were looking into the report.
	   In 1993, Pyongyang conducted a test firing of a Rodong missile
toward the Sea of Japan, which divides the peninsula from Japan.
The missile has a range of 1,000 kilometers (620 miles).
	   In 1996, the United States began talks with North Korea aimed at
persuading the secretive Communist country to freeze its missile
program and to join an international agreement designed to restrict
missile proliferation. The talks stalled.
	   Japan is currently boosting its budget for joint development of
a theater missile defense system with the United States, and has
reportedly earmarked 500 million yen (dlrs. 3.6 million) for the
project next year.

Gunmen kill editor in Bangladesh
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Gunmen killed a newspaper editor with a
barrage of machine gun fire as he was riding home in a rickshaw in
western Bangladesh, an official said Monday.
	   No one claimed responsibility for Sunday's assassination. But
Saiful Alam's Bengali-language daily, The Runner, had recently
published a series denouncing the outlawed Maoist guerrillas
operating near his town of Jessore. 80 miles (130 kilometers) west
of Dhaka.
	   Alam died on the way to the hospital, the area's government
administrator Abdul Malek said. The unidentified gunmen escaped.
	   Police did not immediately link the killing to the paper's
campaign. The Maoists advocate armed revolution to overthrow the
democratic system established in this predominantly Muslim country
in 1991 after years of military-backed autocracy.

Malaysian government to hold emergency Cabinet meeting
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The Cabinet will meet in special
session Tuesday, after a rocky week in which the Southeast Asian
nation officially fell into recession and its two top bankers
resigned.
	   Government officials celebrating National Day on Monday with
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad on the northwestern resort island
of Penang confirmed the Cabinet meeting.
	   Although they wouldn't indicate what would be on the agenda, it
is likely that Cabinet ministers will discuss the resignations of
the country's top two central bankers.
	   Bank Negara governor Ahmad Mohamed Don and his deputy, Fong Weng
Phak, quit last week. Mahathir has admitted that there was a rift
over monetary policy between Bank Negara and the government.
	   Mahathir and special economics minister Daim Zainuddin have been
pushing for lower interest rates as part of an initiative to jump
start the country's sagging economy, which contracted 6.8 percent
in the second quarter this year.
	   Ahmad and Fong were uncomfortable with that strategy and
preferred to quit Bank Negara, sources close to the central bank
have said.
	   The sudden meeting comes amid mounting speculation that Malaysia
may opt to impose capital controls to restrict the amount of money
leaving the country.
	   Economists say that may be the only way to protect the faltering
ringgit if interest rates are cut further. The currency has already
lost 40 percent of its value over the past 14 months.

Rights activists urge military to court-martial Suharto relative
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A human rights group Monday pressed
for tougher action against a son-in-law of former President Suharto
who has been implicated in the kidnappings of political activists.
	   Former Lt. Gen. Prabowo Subianto was dismissed from the armed
forces last week after a military investigation of the abductions,
which were carried out before Suharto quit in May.
	   Military investigators have not ruled out legal action against
Prabowo, the former head of Indonesia's special forces. They say
Prabowo told them he kidnapped nine opponents of the autocratic
president. Fourteen activists remain missing and are feared dead.
	   Hendardi, a lawyer at the Indonesian Legal Aid and Human Rights
Association, said the military should not hesitate to court-martial
Prabowo.
	   Hendardi said a pro-democracy activist who was kidnapped and
later released, Pius Lustrilanang, was considering whether to file
a lawsuit against Prabowo in a civil court.
	   ``Prabowo has to be brought to a military tribunal, and at the
same time we can file a lawsuit against him,'' Hendardi said.
	   More evidence against Prabowo could emerge when 11 members of
the special forces who have been implicated in the abductions go on
trial in a military court.
	   ``Then we'll know who the mastermind is and their political
motive'' the official Antara news agency quoted Gen. Subagyo
Hadisiswoyo, the chief investigator, as saying.
	   The activist Pius was kidnapped Feb. 4 while waiting for a bus
in the capital city of Jakarta. Two months of torture and
interrogation followed, including electrical shocks, beating,
kicking, and a constantly blaring radio, he said.
	   After his release, Pius toured the United States and Europe to
urge condemnation of Suharto, who was forced out of office
following riots and student protests against his rigid rule.
	   Prabowo reportedly left Indonesia last week on a Muslim
pilgrimage to Mecca, Islam's holy site in Saudi Arabia.

 &UR; North Korea fires missile into the Sea of Japan, Japan says
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with officials saying they believe the missile was

officials in Washington refusing comment. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ North Korean forces fired a ballistic missile
toward Japan on Monday, and it landed in the Sea of Japan, the
Japanese Defense Agency said.
	   Japan's Kyodo News quoted unidentified Defense Agency officials
as saying they believe the missile was aimed at the open seas
between Russia and Japan.
	   Quoting unidentified U.S. military officials, the Defense Agency
said the missile was fired around noon (0300 GMT) and landed about
halfway between North Korea and the coast of northwestern Japan.
	   That would be 375 kilometers (230 miles) east of Kimchaek city
in North Korea, 450 kilometers (280 miles) west of Akita, Japan,
and 350 kilometers (220 miles) southeast of Vladivostok, Russia.
	   No other information was immediately available.
	   Japan's Foreign Ministry, U.S. military officials in Japan, the
South Korean government and Washington declined to comment, saying
they were looking into the report.
	   If confirmed, it would be North Korea's first test firing of its
Rodong ballistic missile in five years.
	   The missile, with a range of 1,000 kilometers (620 miles), was
last test fired in 1993, and also landed in the Sea of Japan, which
divides the Korean Peninsula from Japan.
	   In 1996, the United States began talks with North Korea aimed at

missile proliferation. The talks stalled.
	   Japan is currently boosting its budget for joint development of
a theater missile defense system with the United States, and has
reportedly earmarked 500 million yen (dlrs. 3.6 million) for the
project next year.
	   The United States has 37,000 troops stationed in South Korea,
many of them based near its border with North Korea.

Scientists warn of new ozone layer threat from halon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Australian scientists said Monday
they are mystified by the rapid rise of an ozone-destroying
chemical in the atmosphere which threatens to delay the recovery of
the Earth's precious ozone layer.
	   Measurements of pristine air collected at the Bureau of
Meteorology's Cape Grim baseline air pollution station in northwest
Tasmania found a five-fold jump in the level of halon-1202 in the
atmosphere since the late 1970s.
	   During the past two years, the atmospheric concentration of
halon-1202 had grown 17 percent a year, Paul Fraser of Australia's
federal science agency said.
	   ``The international community will have to consider extending
the ban on production of halons to halon-1202 if we are to protect
the ozone layer,'' Fraser said.
	   Fraser said the source of the new halon remained a mystery,
speculating the gas could be a by-product of inefficient production
of other halons in developing countries.
	   Some countries might also be manufacturing halon-1202 for
military applications, he said.
	   Halon-1202 has an ozone-depletion potential of about half that
of common chlorofluorocarbons.
	   But unlike other halons used in the past for fire fighting,
halon-1202 was not controlled by the Montreal Protocol _ which
gives developing countries until 2010 to completely phase out halon
production.
	   Fraser said measurements showed most chlorofluorocarbons were
slowing down their atmospheric growth rate, had stabilized in the
atmosphere or were even dropping in concentration.
	   This meant ozone recovery was likely to be detected in the next
10 to 20 years.
	   ``However, continued emissions of halons will delay this
recovery,'' he said.
	   The ozone layer, located about 15 miles (24 km) above the Earth,
is a shield against the sun's deadly ultraviolet radiation.
	   A thinning ozone layer can let in enough UV light to cause skin
cancers and cataracts.

Vietnam protests destruction of friendship monument
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Vietnam has strongly denounced an attack
on the Friendship Monument in Cambodia's capital, branding it a
shameful and contemptible action, the Communist Party newspaper
Nhan Dan reported Monday.
	   The statue of Vietnamese soldiers _ who occupied the country
from 1979 to 1989 _ is supposed to be a symbol of bilateral unity
and friendship.
	   Relations with Vietnam became an issue in Cambodia's recent
elections, with opposition politicians criticizing leader Hun Sen's
alleged pro-Hanoi ties.
	   Nhan Dan said the Vietnamese Embassy in Phnom Penh sent a letter
to Cambodia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International
Cooperation on Sunday.
	   The letter called the incident, during Cambodia's largest
demonstration in memory Sunday, an act of sabotage that once again
exposed the extreme anti-peace, anti-cooperation nature of the
protest's organizers.
	   The statue was smashed and burned after the march, demanding the
ouster of Hun Sen, concluded outside the National Assembly.
	   The Vietnamese note claimed the action would be strongly
denounced by the peoples of Cambodia, Vietnam and the world.
	   The embassy urgently requested that the Cambodian government
take measures to protect the monument and have it repaired quickly,
said the note.
	   Nhan Dan said the attack was an obvious racial action.

	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ Prime Minister John Howard is the
odds-on favorite to retain government when Australia's 12 million
voters go to the polls on Oct. 3.
	   Northern Territory bookmakers CentreBet and Darwin All Sports on
Monday agreed the Howard-led conservative coalition was well ahead
of Labor and the right-wing populist One Nation in the early
``punters' poll.''
	   ``The punters' poll is the best guide because people part with
their hard earned'' (money) said CentreBet manager Gerard Daffy,
whose Alice Springs agency was swamped by 30,000 Australian dollars
(17,400 U.S. dlrs) in election bets Sunday.
	   Daffy said 90 percent of bets written over the weekend were on
Howard and the conservatives.
	   However one Norwegian who ``bets on anything'' placed 10
Australian dollars (5.80 U.S. dlrs) on One Nation to win
government, at odds of 140-1.
	   CentreBet on Monday was offering odds of 1-2 about Howard's
conservatives being returned, 14-10 about the Labor Party and 150-1
about Pauline Hanson's One Nation.
	   ``If you believe the early trend, Howard will go to the barrier
a short-priced favorite,'' said Daffy. ``If the election was run
today, you'd have to say he'd win it comfortably.''

North Korea fires missile into the Sea of Japan

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ North Korea fired a ballistic missile into open
seas between Russia and northwestern Japan on Monday, possibly to
test a new missile now under development.
	   Japan's Defense Agency, quoting unidentified U.S. military
officials, said the missile was fired around noon (0300 GMT) and
landed about halfway between North Korea and the coast of
northwestern Japan.
	   The missile was believed to have been aimed at open seas between
Russia and Japan.
	   Japan's Kyodo News quoted unidentified sources as saying the
missile may have been a ``Daepodong,'' a new type now under
development by the North.
	   But it said that because the missile landed closer to Russia,
government officials said Japan could not send military ships or
planes to investigate.
	   Defense Agency officials refused to comment on that, or provide
any further details. South Korean and American officials would also
only confirm there had been a launch.
	   ``We can confirm that it did happen. The Defense Department
feels it is a serious development and will be evaluating the
situation,'' U.S. Defense Department spokesman Jim Kout said in
Washington.
	   The missile was believed to have hit waters 375 kilometers (230
miles) east of Kimchaek city in North Korea, 450 kilometers (280
miles) west of Akita, Japan, and 350 kilometers (220 miles)
southeast of Vladivostok, Russia.
	   No other information was immediately available.
	   Very little is known about North Korea's missile capabilities,
and what the new missile might be able to do.
	   North Korea's best known ballistic missile is the Rodong, which
has a range of 1,000 kilometers (620 miles). It was last test fired
in 1993, and also landed in the Sea of Japan, which divides the
Korean Peninsula from Japan.
	   In 1996, the United States began talks with North Korea aimed at
persuading the secretive Communist country to freeze its missile
program and to join an international agreement designed to restrict
missile proliferation. The talks stalled.
	   Japan is currently boosting its budget for joint development of
a theater missile defense system with the United States, and has
reportedly earmarked 500 million yen (dlrs. 3.6 million) for the
project next year.
	   The United States has 37,000 troops stationed in South Korea,
many of them based near its border with North Korea.
	   With its 1,000 kilometer range, the Rodong I missile, a modified
Scud system, could strike South Korea and much of Japan.
	   North Korea is also believed to have developed and deployed
Soviet-designed Scud B and Scud C missiles, with ranges of 340
kilometers (210 miles) and 500 kilometers(310 miles), respectively.

Big tumble in Hong Kong, as Asian stock markets try again
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with stocks lower in Singapore and Hong
Kong at midday, closing day higher in Tokyo. TRIMS.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ As Asian markets reopened Monday after last week's
global stock market rout, share prices fell sharply in Hong Kong
and Singapore. But they rose in Japan, despite more bad news about
Russia's economic and political stability.
	   After only seven minutes of trading in Hong Kong, the blue-chip
Hang Seng Index was down 5.7 percent, or 443.14 points, to
7,386.60. By lunchtime, the index had fallen even further, shedding
475.32 points, or 6.1 percent, to 7,354.42.
	   In Singapore, where the benchmark index had crashed through the
crucial 900-point level for the first time in more than 10 years
Friday, shares opened only slightly lower Monday, then fell 10.38
points, or 1.2 percent, to 874.88, by the midday break.
	   However, on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, where the benchmark
225-issue Nikkei Stock Average had sunk to a 12-year low Friday,
stock prices rose moderately, gaining 192.26 points, or 1.38
percent, to close the day at 14,107.89.
	   ``Given the big falls we had last week, world markets may be
taking a breather. But generally the fundamentals in Japan and Asia
as a whole remain bleak,'' Peter Morgan, a senior economist at HSBC
Securities Japan, Ltd., said in an interview.
	   Across Asia, Europe and the Americas many stock markets fell by
big percentages last week. That left some people wondering if the
year-old Asian financial crisis, and the recessions it has caused
in regional powerhouses such as Japan and Hong Kong, could spread
to the West and sour its economies.
	   On Sunday, Japan's chief economic planner, Taichi Sakaiya,
proposed an emergency summit of major industrialized countries to
address the chaos roiling world financial markets.
	   In the United States, the Dow Jones Industrial average dropped
357 points Thursday and 114.31 points Friday, leaving it at
8,051.68. That shrank 1998's gain to 1.8 percent. At July's peak,
the Dow had been up 18.1 percent.
	   To make matters worse, the ruble recently collapsed in Russia,
setting off political and economic instability there.
	   On Saturday, Russia's new acting prime minister, Viktor
Chernomyrdin, began negotiating a power-sharing agreement with the
Russian parliament and reassured markets around the world that the
country would not return to a Soviet-style economy.
	   But on Sunday, hours after the interim government and
parliamentary leaders agreed to a tentative, 18-month truce that
would leave President Boris Yeltsin in control and give the
administration time to try to end the crisis, the agreement
appeared to collapse after the Communists rejected it.
	   In Hong Kong on Monday, the Hang Seng Index seemed to fall
sharply because the government has reduced its role in trading.
	   For two weeks, Hong Kong's government had been buying stocks to
drive the Hang Seng Index to a level at which speculators who bet
on stock prices falling would lose money.
	   On Friday, that aggressive government buying pushed trading
volume to a record U.S. dlrs 10.1 billion. Traders estimated the
government spent U.S. dlrs 9.1 billion.
	   Although the stock market still closed 1.2 percent lower Friday
at 7,829.74 points, the prolonged intervention has lifted the main
index 1,200 points higher than two weeks ago.
	   On Monday, speculators suddenly found it more expensive to bet
against Hong Kong markets because of new measures taken by the
Futures Exchange over the weekend to curb manipulation.
	   On Saturday, the futures exchange announced it would require
market players to come up with more cash when buying or selling
more than 10,000 futures contracts. In addition, it is now
requiring members to report and identify anyone holding 250
contracts or more. Previously, the reporting level had been 500
contracts, and market players could remain anonymous.
	   Even though stock prices seemed far more stable in Tokyo on
Monday, signs of gloominess and fear about the world's economic
future also remained high in some areas.
	   ``I'm worried,'' said Kazuomi Kobayashi, a 52-year-old Tokyo
barber who dabbles in stocks.
	   Standing in front of a large electronic board in downtown Tokyo
showing the latest Nikkei numbers, he said: ``I've lost so much.
When I buy, it goes down. When I buy again, it goes down again.''
	   ``This is bad. It gives me the shudders,'' said Masao Sakata,
52, a businessman also watching the blinking minus signs on the
board at Wako Securities Co. near Tokyo's main train station.
	   Even in Singapore, where newspapers often work with the
government to keep people calm, signs of panic prevailed.
	   ``World markets sent reeling: World faces global meltdown as its
leaders fail to find solutions to Russia's worsening crisis,'' said
the front-page headline in Saturday's The Straits Times.
	   ``Fear of complete meltdown rules markets,'' said a headline in
The Business Times on Monday over R. Sivanithy's column.
	   In Hong Kong's bustling financial district, many people stopped
at interactive terminals to check their shares on the Hang Seng.
	   One man said the government's recent intervention in Hong Kong's
markets had left it nearly impossible for people to know their real
value and whether to buy or sell shares.

Suharto son's role in loan deal comes under scrutiny
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) - A son of former President Suharto
might have to testify about alleged wrongdoing in a multi-million
dollar loan deal, the official Antara news agency reported Monday.
	   Prosecutors say Sigit Harjojudanto, the eldest of Suharto's
three sons, was involved in soliciting the loan, allegedly to
subsidize a real estate development company he partly owns.
	   However, local residents reported in 1996 that no construction
crews ever appeared in the area earmarked for development and
nothing was built, Antara said. The 105 billion rupiah (dlrs 9.5
million) loan was issued by the state North Sumatra Development
Bank.
	   Prosecutors are trying to find out what happened to the money.
	   The business dealings of Suharto's family have come under
scrutiny since the autocrat quit in May after riots and student
protests.
	   The former president's relatives built a huge economic empire
during his 32 years in power, and critics say alleged corruption in
the government contributed to Indonesia's economic crisis.
	   Sigit is a shareholder in PT Victor Jaya Raya, a real estate
company that was supposed to build houses in the Sumatra island
city of Deli Serdang, said Bismar Manu, deputy chief of the public
prosecutor's office in North Sumatra province.
	   ``Whoever is involved, we will soon process and summon them to
court,'' Antara quoted Manu as saying. Sigit might be asked to
testify, he said.
	   ``Several other sons of high-ranking state officials and
prominent businessmen in this province have taken part in buying
shares of the company,'' Manu said.
	   In another investigation, government prosecutors in Jakarta are
looking into more than a dozen charitable foundations set up and
controlled by Suharto amid allegations they were used for corrupt
purposes.
	   The government is also investigating Hartomo, a brother-in-law
of Suharto, for the allegedly illegal issue of dlrs 3 billion in
promissory notes in 1985.

More than 1.5 million marooned in north Indian flood
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HEMA SHUKLA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Aid workers hoping to reach 20 towns
reportedly submerged by floodwaters found nothing but open water
and bloated bodies Monday, where tens of thousands of people once
lived.
	   ``The destruction is so overwhelming that rescue efforts seem
futile,'' said Kripa Shankar Pandey, a local reporter who lives in
Gorakhpur at the center of the disaster zone.
	   Working with about 1,500 boats _ most of them aging, cracked
rowboats _ government workers and private aid organizations tried
to reach the north Indian villages in Uttar Pradesh, India's most
populous state and one of its poorest. But there were no signs of
the villages in the unending stretch of flood water.
	   Rescue workers, overwhelmed by the havoc caused by torrential
rains, could do little more than recover bodies from the turbulent
waters believed to have killed more than 1,000 people in three
weeks.
	   Jeetendra Singh, a government administrator in Gorakhpur, said
an estimated 1.5 million villagers were surrounded by flood waters
and marooned. Authorities were trying to fly in at least 300
sturdy, motorized boats from Calcutta and Bombay on air force
planes. Currently, only 11 motorized boats are available for rescue
operations, said Singh.
	   Thousands of acres of standing crops were submerged, along with
tens of thousands of homes. Officials had not begun estimating the
amount of damage to property and livestock.
	   Based on the number of corpses recovered, officials put the
number of dead at 119. But residents and local newspapers reported
as many as 1,020 dead.
	   Singh admitted the administration was overwhelmed by the
magnitude of the problem. Rescue work was slow, he said, but
several hundred people had been brought to dry areas and were being
housed in government shelters where they received food and
medicines.
	   At least one hastily built shelter was itself submerged, said
Pandey. Refugees from the shelter swam to higher areas and were
forced to spend the night in the rain, he said.
	   Air force helicopters dropped food and tarpaulins to people
marooned on their rooftops, Singh said.
	   Rivers in eastern Uttar Pradesh state continued to rise. The
Rapti River, which flows through Gorakhpur, broke its embankment in
20 places. A power station south of Gorakhpur was shut down because
of the rising water and a railway station was submerged.
	   Two thousand trucks loaded with food and supplies were stranded
on a national highway.
	   Authorities blocked underground sewers, fearing that flood water
would rush into areas in Gorakhpur city that were still dry. But,
residents complained that it caused refuse to flow back into their
neighborhood and homes and contaminate drinking water.
	   Municipal authorities were trying to pump back the sewage, Singh
said.

Hailstorm sparks rumors that world is ending
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ The first hailstorm in memory caused
serious damage in a southern Vietnamese village and sparked rumors
that it was a harbinger of doomsday.
	   The chief of the provincial Weather Forecast Station was forced
to visit Hiep Thanh, in the Mekong Delta province of Bac Lieu, and
appear on local television to explain that it was a natural
phenomenon, an official of the forecast station said.
	   The hail destroyed 11 thatched homes and damaged 19 others. All
of the village's vegetable gardens were damaged, as were other
crops.
	   Typhoon Linda, the worst storm to hit the Mekong Delta in a
century, caused more than dlrs 600 million in damage last year.

Dollar lower, Tokyo stocks higher
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with closing stocks, afternoon bond and dollar rates

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar fell against the Japanese yen
Monday amid profit-taking set off by uncertainty about the outlook
for stability in Russia and on Wall Street. Japanese stock prices
rose moderately.
	   The dollar bought 141.71 yen in afternoon trading, down 1.61 yen
from late in Tokyo on Friday and also below its level of 141.85 in
late New York trading Friday.
	   The dollar jumped only briefly on news that Japan's Defense
Agency said North Korea fired a missile toward the Sea of Japan.
Investors tend to seek the dollar as a haven during times of
international crisis.
	   Dealers cashed in dollar holdings on lingering concern about the
drop on Wall Street last week and the dim outlook for political
stability in Russia, traders said.
	   The Dow Jones Industrial Average extended its slide Friday,
falling 114.31 points to 8,051.68. In Russia, a compromise deal
between key parliamentary leaders and President Boris Yeltsin fell
apart late Sunday.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the benchmark 225-issue Nikkei
Stock Average recovered moderately from its fall to 12-year lows
Friday. The Nikkei gained 192.26 points, or 1.38 percent, to close
at 14,107.89 on Monday.
	   On Friday, the index lost 498.16 points, or 3.46 percent, to
13,915.63 _ its lowest finish since March 6, 1986.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section of the exchange rose 19.50 points, or 1.79 percent,
to 1,106.49. It had fallen 29.98 points, or 2.68 percent, to close
at 1,086.99 Friday.
	   Stocks rebounded after Sakura Bank Ltd. said it was negotiating
for a massive infusion of new capital from Toyota Motor Corp. and
other Mitsui group firms.
	   ``The report about Sakura Bank and the yen's rebound are seen as
bullish for major bank shares,'' said Yasuo Ueki, a general manager
at Nikko Securities Co.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond declined to 1.050 percent from Friday's finish of
1.070 percent, driving its price up to 112.79 yen from 112.65 yen.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Communists saying it will block premier's
confirmation, opposition ready for more talks, Yeltsin at Kremlin,
new details throughout, deletes material &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Communist opposition said Monday it would
block the approval of a new prime minister following the collapse
of a proposed truce with Boris Yeltsin, despite Russia's growing
economic crisis.
	   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov said his party and other
hard-line groups would vote against confirming acting Prime
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin because the government had not made
enough concessions on reducing Yeltsin's powers.
	   The government insisted it remained in control and that work on
tackling the country's economic crisis was going ahead. ``It is
business as usual for government headquarters,'' said government
spokesman Igor Shabdurasulov.
	   Zyuganov said the opposition would vote Monday against
Chernomyrdin's appointment, but indicated he was ready for more
negotiations on a deal, signaling a deal was still possible.
	   ``There's no guarantee that full agreement will be reached
today. We're ready to take another look at it today,'' he told
reporters.
	   Chernomyrdin met with several leftist factions Monday behind
closed doors, attempting to salvage the truce. He also planned to
meet with Yeltsin, who was at work Monday in the Kremlin, according
to officials.
	   There was no sign of panic in Moscow and other cities Monday as
people headed to work. The Russian currency staged a mild recovery
after last week's sharp falls.
	   Government and opposition leaders reached tentative agreement
Sunday on a pact under which parliament would approve the new
government and give it a chance to solve the economic crisis. In
return, President Yeltsin was to give parliament a bigger role in
approving the Cabinet.
	   But the Communists rejected the deal Sunday evening. Zyuganov
said his party's leadership could not support the pact because
there was no firm guarantee Yeltsin would abide by its provisions.
	   The breakdown appeared likely to usher in a period of political
head-butting and bargaining similar to the one that surrounded the
nomination of the previous prime minister, Sergei Kiriyenko, last
spring. The Communists want maximum concessions from the government
and don't want to anger their supporters by appearing to give in
too easily.
	   Under the constitution, the lower house of parliament, the State
Duma, can vote three times on a prime minister's nomination.
	   In the case of Kiriyenko, the Communist-led Duma twice voted no,
then caved in on the third vote after trying to wrest concessions
from the government.
	   Zyuganov kept up his rhetorical pressure on Yeltsin on Sunday,
telling the television program ``Itogi'': ``Let Yeltsin's family
convince him to resign and not to drag the entire country into the
grave by his bony hand.''
	   The nationalist Liberal Democratic Party joined the Communists
in vowing not to sign the deal, as did the social democratic
Yabloko party. Yabloko leaders had said from the start that they
wouldn't support Chernomyrdin's nomination.
	   The political stalemate couldn't come at a worse time for the
Russian government, which is trying to stabilize an economy that
has been seriously damaged by the devaluation of the national
currency, the ruble, and the government's default on its debts.
	   Chernomyrdin said swift formation of a new government was vital
to tackle the crisis.
	   ``We must resolve financial problems. The ruble is hanging by a
thread,'' he said. ``So if we have a political agreement and the
president accepts it _ let's start working.''
	   The proposed three-page agreement would have given the State
Duma, parliament's lower house, more say in Cabinet appointments,
but leave Yeltsin with substantial power, despite earlier
opposition calls for his removal.
	   In particular, the president would have retained control of the
security forces with the right to fill three key posts _ the
defense, foreign and interior ministries. In exchange, Yeltsin
would have agreed to Duma approval of most Cabinet appointments for
the first time, according to lawmakers and media reports.
	   The draft, which was not made public, would also have obliged
both sides to maintain a political truce. The Duma would not try to
vote the government out of power until parliament's term ends in
late 1999, while Yeltsin would not use his right to dissolve the
legislature _ although he apparently would not lose this power.
	   But the deal was on paper only and Yeltsin would have retained
his legal powers to dissolve the Duma.

Berlin may be unexpected last stop for track stars on Grand Prix
</HEADLINE>
circuit &QL; 
 &UR; By ROY KAMMERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Berlin's ISTAF meet Tuesday wasn't supposed to be
the place where some of track's biggest names ended their lucrative
Grand Prix track season.
	   But that could happen if they follow through on their threat to
skip the final event in Moscow because of Russia's economic
turmoil.
	   ``I don't believe anyone in Russia is interested in watching
athletics. It's like an insult: They're fighting for survival while
we earn millions,'' said Michael Johnson after capturing the
400-meter race three days ago in Brussels.
	   Johnson and Morocco's undefeated 1500-meter ace Hichael El
Guerrouj were among 50 track stars that signed a petition in
Brussels. They want Saturday's final shifted from Moscow to a safer
venue.
	   But whether stars like the double Olympic champion show up in
Russia _ Johnson says he won't _ most of track's biggest names are
expected to flash their skills in Berlin.
	   El Guerrouj is among the four athletes still chasing a dlrs 1
million jackpot awarded for sailing through the Grand Prix circuit
unbeaten.
	   His rivals for a share of the jackpot are the U.S. stars Marion
Jones in the 100 and Bryan Bronson in the 400 hurdles, along with
Ethiopia's Haile Gebrselassie in the 3,000.
	   Jones _ who says she will compete in Moscow _ will face one
obstacle less to winning the dlrs 1 million in Berlin. Her touted
French rival, Christine Arron, has pulled out of the meet
	   One of the biggest names to run at the event will actually be
interrupting his retirement.
	   Linford Christie, Britain's former Olympic 100-meter champion,
will anchor a 4-by-100 relay team composed of the young proteges he
trains in his management company called ``Nuff Respect.''
	   Kenya's 3,000-meter world record holder Daniel Komen is another
star that signed the petition, but will run in Berlin.
	   Whether Komen, El Guerrouj or other world or Olympic champions
on the list boycott Moscow remains an individual choice, according
to Jon Drummond.
	   The U.S. 200-meter star, who organized the petition, and Johnson
cited safety factors as a reason to skip the final in Russia. ``As
Americans we don't feel safe there,'' Drummond said.
	   He mentioned the bombings of two U.S. embassies in Kenya, as
well as the disco in South Africa.
	   Despite the gathering of big names at the meet, there probably
won't be any assaults on the record books because of rain and cold
expected to sweep Berlin's historic Olympic Stadium.

Govt says Myanmar cannot be ruled without the military
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ The military regime declared Monday that
the opposition led by Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi could not
rule the country without a partnership with the armed forces.
	   Commentaries in official newspapers warned that the army, which
has ruled Myanmar since 1962, would not tolerate any attempt by Suu
Kyi to instigate civil unrest to end military government.
	   The warnings come amid a stepped-up campaign by Suu Kyi's
National League for Democracy to pressure the government to allow a
parliament elected in 1990 to convene.
	   The opposition overwhelmingly won the election, but the military
_ known as the Tatmadaw _ refused to relinquish power.
	   ``It is not the right time to convene a parliament. If the
parliament cannot be convened, will the NLD incite civil strife
with the assistance of alien nations?'' the commentaries said.
	   ``Will the Tatmadaw tolerate such attempts? It should not be
forgotten that the welfare of the people is the most important,''
they said. ``The public is inseparable from the Tatmadaw and so is
the government from the Tatmadaw.''
	   The commentaries claimed that Myanmar's people regarded Suu Kyi,
53, as a troublemaker and urged her to change her ``negative
attitude.''
	   Suu Kyi is regarded around the world and inside Myanmar, also
known as Burma, as the leader of the pro-democracy movement, but
the military has refused her requests for a dialogue.
	   The government has infrequently met with other party officials,
but steadfastly refuses to speak to Suu Kyi, viewing her as a tool
of Western powers they feel are bent on re-colonizing Myanmar.
	   Diplomats briefed by the government last week expressed
skepticism that recent meetings were a steppingstone to a real
dialogue, noting threats of prison and banning the NLD were made.
	   Suu Kyi has been recovering from a 13-day roadside standoff with
the authorities, part of a new anti-government campaign to coincide
with the 10th anniversary of a failed uprising against military
rule. An estimated 3,000 people were killed.
	   Myanmar's people fear taking to the streets again, though 200
students held a protest a week ago for the first time in two years.
A student exile group in Thailand said later that some had been
arrested.

Strongman pledges not to use violence against Cambodian protesters
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES throughout with Hun Sen pledging to let
protest run course free of violence, appeals body rejects
complaints.
 &UR; By KER MUNTHIT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Strongman Hun Sen pledged Monday not
to use violence against thousands of demonstrators staging a
round-the-clock vigil for the past week demanding his ouster.
	   But Hun Sen vowed he would not step down and insisted he would
rule the country as the sole prime minister following his declared
victory in parliamentary elections July 26.
	   The stage was set for more turmoil when the Constitutional
Council, the country's highest appeals body and stacked with Hun
Sen's supporters, rejected all opposition complaints of electoral
fraud Monday.
	   Hun Sen told reporters following a two-hour meeting with the
U.N. special representative in Cambodia, Lakhan Mehrotra, that the
opposition was trying to provoke a violent response, apparently to
undermine his international legitimacy.
	   Security forces have been ordered not to use violence as long
the demonstrations stay peaceful, Hun Sen said.
	   ``There won't be any response by arms from the part of the
government,'' Hun Sen said. ``If they can do it peacefully, no
problem if it goes on for three months, six months or even one
year.''
	   Earlier, King Norodom Sihanouk urged dialogue between rival
political leaders in a bid to end the protests, which he said were
bringing shame to the nation.
	   The demonstrations, unprecedented in size and duration, have
turned a park outside the National Assembly into a tent city at
times swarming with as many as 15,000 people.
	   They are demanding that Hun Sen step down and that opposition
complaints of massive fraud by the ruling Cambodian People's Party
in the elections be properly investigated.
	   The opposition leaders, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, the king's
son, and Sam Rainsy have also demanded that a controversial formula
giving the CPP a majority of 64 of the 122 National Assembly seats
with just 41 percent of the vote be modified.
	   International observers gave the polls a generally credible bill
of health, but issued their assessments well before counting _
which took 10 days _ was completed.
	   The protest showed the first sign of turning violent Sunday,
when about a dozen people attacked a Vietnamese soldier depicted in
a Vietnam-Cambodian friendship statue in the park.
	   In Hanoi, the Communist Party newspaper Nhan Dan reported Monday
that Vietnam has strongly denounced the attack, branding it a
shameful and contemptible action.
	   Suspicion and hatred of Vietnam, Cambodia's historic enemy, runs
deep. Though Vietnamese troops toppled the genocidal Khmer Rouge in
1979, a harsh, decade-long occupation followed.
	   Hun Sen rose to power under the occupation and is regarded by
many of his countrymen as too pro-Hanoi.
	   Sihanouk claimed in a fax that the nonviolent rallies have led
the international community ``to strongly scorn us and to lose any
intention to help Cambodia any more.''
	   The result can only be more misery for the poverty-stricken
nation, Sihanouk said, urging the political leaders to negotiate
their differences.
	   Ranariddh, who was deposed as co-prime minister last year in a
bloody coup, and Sam Rainsy are withholding the two-thirds majority
support Hun Sen needs in the assembly to form a new government. The
assembly meets for the first time Sept. 24.
	   The park where the demonstration is being held, dubbed Democracy
Square by the protesters, is the site of a grenade attack last year
against a rally Sam Rainsy was leading.
	   At least 16 people were killed and more than 100 wounded,
including Sam Rainsy. Hun Sen has widely been accused of the
attack. He denies it.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Communist opposition said Monday it would
block the approval of a new prime minister following the collapse
of a proposed truce with Boris Yeltsin, despite Russia's growing
economic crisis.
	   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov said his party and other
hard-line groups would vote against confirming acting Prime
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin because the government had not made
enough concessions on reducing Yeltsin's powers.
	   President Yeltsin promptly said he would nominate Chernomyrdin
again if the lower chamber of parliament, the Duma, votes against
the acting premier, aides said.

North Korea fires missile into the Sea of Japan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with South Korea defense ministry saying the the
missile was likely a ``Daepodong'' in 3rd graf
 &UR; By TODD ZAUN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ North Korea fired a ballistic missile into open
seas between Russia and northwestern Japan on Monday, possibly to
test a new missile now under development.
	   Japan's Defense Agency, quoting unidentified U.S. military
officials, said the missile was fired around noon (0300 GMT) and
landed about halfway between North Korea and the coast of
northwestern Japan.
	   The missile was believed to have been a ``Daepodong,'' a new
type now under development by the North, said a South Korea Defense
Ministry official, who requested anonymity. It was likely aimed at
open seas between Russia and Japan.
	   A Japan defense agency official said Japan had not dispatched
any military ships or planes to the area.
	   South Korean and American officials confirmed there had been a
launch but would provide no other details.
	   ``We can confirm that it did happen. The Defense Department
feels it is a serious development and will be evaluating the
situation,'' U.S. Defense Department spokesman Jim Kout said in
Washington.
	   The missile was believed to have hit waters 375 kilometers (230
miles) east of Kimchaek city in North Korea, 450 kilometers (280
miles) west of Akita, Japan, and 350 kilometers (220 miles)
southeast of Vladivostok, Russia.
	   No other information was immediately available.
	   Very little is known about North Korea's missile capabilities,
and what the new missile might be able to do, though the Daepodong
missiles are thought to have a range of more than 2,000 kilometers
(1,240 miles).
	   North Korea's best known ballistic missile is the Rodong, which
has a range of 1,000 kilometers (620 miles). It was last test fired
in 1993, and also landed in the Sea of Japan, which divides the
Korean Peninsula from Japan.
	   In 1996, the United States began talks with North Korea aimed at
persuading the secretive Communist country to freeze its missile
program and to join an international agreement designed to restrict
missile proliferation. The talks stalled.
	   Japan is currently boosting its budget for joint development of
a theater missile defense system with the United States, and has
reportedly earmarked 500 million yen (dlrs. 3.6 million) for the
project next year.
	   The United States has 37,000 troops stationed in South Korea,
many of them based near its border with North Korea.
	   With its 1,000 kilometer range, the Rodong I missile, a modified
Scud system, could strike South Korea and much of Japan.
	   North Korea is also believed to have developed and deployed
Soviet-designed Scud B and Scud C missiles, with ranges of 340
kilometers (210 miles) and 500 kilometers(310 miles), respectively.

Howard is the odds-on favorite to win election

 &UR; With BC-Australia-Election

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ Prime Minister John Howard is the
odds-on favorite to retain control of the government when
Australia's 12 million voters go to the polls on Oct. 3.
	   Northern Territory bookmakers CentreBet and Darwin All Sports on
Monday agreed the Howard-led conservative coalition was well ahead
of Labor and the right-wing populist One Nation in the early
``punters' poll.''
	   ``The punters' poll is the best guide because people part with
their hard earned (money),'' said CentreBet manager Gerard Daffy,
whose Alice Springs agency was swamped by 30,000 Australian dollars
(17,400 U.S. dlrs) in election bets Sunday.
	   Daffy said 90 percent of bets written over the weekend were on
Howard and the conservatives.
	   However one Norwegian who ``bets on anything'' placed 10
Australian dollars (5.80 U.S. dlrs) on One Nation to win
government, at odds of 140-1.
	   CentreBet on Monday was offering odds of 1-2 about Howard's
conservatives being returned, 14-10 about the Labor Party and 150-1
about Pauline Hanson's One Nation.
	   ``If you believe the early trend, Howard will go to the barrier
a short-priced favorite,'' said Daffy. ``If the election was run
today, you'd have to say he'd win it comfortably.''

Stocks dive as government halts buying spree

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong stocks dived early Monday as the
government halted its two-week stock buying spree, with the key
index plunging more than 6 percent, analysts said.
	   Meanwhile, analysts and researchers are split as to whether new
measures intended to curb futures speculation go far enough.
	   To fend of speculators, the government started scooping up huge
amounts of shares in the past two weeks, and successfully drove up
prices to a level at which speculators who bet against the market
suffered huge losses.
	   To further protect the market, the Hong Kong Futures Exchange
announced at the weekend new measures to make it more expensive for
speculators to place bets in the futures market.
	   It said it would require investors to come up with more cash
when buying or selling more than 10,000 futures contracts.
	   In addition, it is now requiring members to report and identify
anyone holding 250 contracts or more. Previously, the reporting
level had been 500 contracts, and market players could remain
anonymous.
	   Josephine Hui, research director of Celestial Asia Securities,
said speculators still could easily evade the new reporting rules
by spreading their purchases among several brokerages. Tracking
down these speculators would be extremely time-consuming, she said.
	   ``They would need a lot of time, resources and manpower to catch
thieves. We're fighting a quick battle, but these measures would
allow speculators to buy time to come up with new strategies,'' she
said.
	   Norman Chan, associate investment research director at Allen
Perkins Ltd., said the new measures would drive off genuine
investors and further hurt market sentiment. The measures can plug
loopholes but could do little to bring order to chaotic futures
trading.
	   ``Investors start to flee when they see the government changing
the rule of the game,'' at a time when market sentiment is
extremely negative, Chan said.
	   Ho Lok-sang, head of the economics department at Lingnan
College, said the government, as an active market player, would
have an unfair advantage over other market players with the new
reporting rules.
	   But he said ``I don't see any problem as long as the government
can separate its dual role as a market player and a market
regulator.''
	   On Monday, at the cramped quarters of the futures exchange,
futures traders in striped jackets emblazoned with the colors of
their firms were hastily dashing around, calling out and signaling
their orders.
	   At midday, the blue-chip Hang Seng Index dropped 475.32 points,
or 6.1 percent, to close morning trading at 7,354.42, as the
government stopped buying shares.
	   On Friday, the index shed 1.2 percent, even though government
buying pushed trading volume to a record U.S. dlrs 10.1 billion.

down these speculators would be extremely time-consuming, she said.
	   ``They would need a lot of time, resources and manpower to catch
thieves. We're fighting a quick battle, but these measures would
allow speculators to buy time to come up with new strategies,'' she
said.
	   Norman Chan, associate investment research director at Allen
Perkins Ltd., said the new measures would drive off genuine
investors and further hurt market sentiment. The measures can plug
loopholes but could do little to bring order to chaotic futures
trading.
	   ``Investors start to flee when they see the government changing
the rule of the game,'' at a time when market sentiment is
extremely negative, Chan said.
	   Ho Lok-sang, head of the economics department at Lingnan
College, said the government, as an active market player, would
have an unfair advantage over other market players with the new
reporting rules.
	   But he said ``I don't see any problem as long as the government
can separate its dual role as a market player and a market
regulator.''
	   On Monday, at the cramped quarters of the futures exchange,
futures traders in striped jackets emblazoned with the colors of
their firms were hastily dashing around, calling out and signaling
their orders.
	   At midday, the blue-chip Hang Seng Index dropped 475.32 points,
or 6.1 percent, to close morning trading at 7,354.42, as the
government stopped buying shares.
	   On Friday, the index shed 1.2 percent, even though government
buying pushed trading volume to a record U.S. dlrs 10.1 billion.

Big tumble in Hong Kong, as Asian stock markets try again

	   TOKYO (AP) _ As Asian markets reopened Monday after last week's
global stock market rout, share prices fell sharply in Hong Kong
and Singapore. But they rose in Japan, despite more bad news about
Russia's economic and political stability.
	   After only seven minutes of trading in Hong Kong, the blue-chip
Hang Seng Index was down 5.7 percent, or 443.14 points, to
7,386.60. By lunchtime, the index had fallen even further, shedding
475.32 points, or 6.1 percent, to 7,354.42.
	   In Singapore, where the benchmark index had crashed through the
crucial 900-point level for the first time in more than 10 years
Friday, shares opened only slightly lower Monday, then fell 10.38
points, or 1.2 percent, to 874.88, by the midday break.
	   However, on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, where the benchmark
225-issue Nikkei Stock Average had sunk to a 12-year low Friday,
stock prices rose moderately, gaining 192.26 points, or 1.38
percent, to close the day at 14,107.89.
	   ``Given the big falls we had last week, world markets may be
taking a breather. But generally the fundamentals in Japan and Asia
as a whole remain bleak,'' Peter Morgan, a senior economist at HSBC
Securities Japan, Ltd., said in an interview.
	   Elsewhere in Asia, the key stock index in Taiwan fell 2.8
percent to finish at a 22-month low, and stocks ended up rising 1.8
percent in South Korea, falling 1.4 percent in Australia, and
remaining nearly unchanged in the Philippines.
	   Last week, across Asia, Europe and the Americas many stock
markets fell by big percentages. That left some people wondering if
the year-old Asian financial crisis, and the recessions it has
caused in regional powerhouses such as Japan and Hong Kong, could
spread to the West and sour its economies.
	   On Sunday, Japan's chief economic planner, Taichi Sakaiya,
proposed an emergency summit of major industrialized countries to
address the chaos roiling world financial markets.
	   In the United States, the Dow Jones Industrial average dropped
357 points Thursday and 114.31 points Friday, leaving it at
8,051.68. That shrank 1998's gain to 1.8 percent. At July's peak,
the Dow had been up 18.1 percent.
	   To make matters worse, the ruble recently collapsed in Russia,
setting off political and economic instability there.
	   On Saturday, Russia's new acting prime minister, Viktor
Chernomyrdin, began negotiating a power-sharing agreement with the
Russian parliament and reassured markets around the world that the
country would not return to a Soviet-style economy.
	   But on Sunday, hours after the interim government and
parliamentary leaders agreed to a tentative, 18-month truce that
would leave President Boris Yeltsin in control and give the
administration time to try to end the crisis, the agreement
appeared to collapse after the Communists rejected it.
	   In Hong Kong on Monday, the Hang Seng Index seemed to fall
sharply because the government has reduced its role in trading.
	   For two weeks, Hong Kong's government had been buying stocks to
drive the Hang Seng Index to a level at which speculators who bet
on stock prices falling would lose money.
	   On Friday, that aggressive government buying pushed trading
volume to a record U.S. dlrs 10.1 billion. Traders estimated the
government spent U.S. dlrs 9.1 billion.
	   Although the stock market still closed 1.2 percent lower Friday
at 7,829.74 points, the prolonged intervention has lifted the main
index 1,200 points higher than two weeks ago.
	   On Monday, speculators suddenly found it more expensive to bet
against Hong Kong markets because of new measures taken by the
Futures Exchange over the weekend to curb manipulation.
	   On Saturday, the futures exchange announced it would require
market players to come up with more cash when buying or selling
more than 10,000 futures contracts. In addition, it is now require
members to report and identify anyone holding 250 contracts or
more. Previously, the reporting level had been 500 contracts, and
market players could remain anonymous.
	   Even though stock prices seemed far more stable in Tokyo and
South Korea on Monday, signs of gloominess and fear about the
world's economic future still seemed widespread.
	   ``I'm worried,'' said Kazuomi Kobayashi, a 52-year-old Tokyo
barber who dabbles in stocks.
	   Standing in front of a large electronic board in downtown Tokyo
showing the latest Nikkei numbers, he said: ``I've lost so much.
When I buy, it goes down. When I buy again, it goes down again.''
	   ``This is bad. It gives me the shudders,'' said Masao Sakata,
52, a businessman also watching the blinking minus signs on the
board at Wako Securities Co. near Tokyo's main train station.
	   Even in Singapore, where newspapers often work with the
government to keep people calm, signs of panic prevailed.
	   ``World markets sent reeling: World faces global meltdown as its
leaders fail to find solutions to Russia's worsening crisis,'' said
the front-page headline in Saturday's The Straits Times.
	   ``Fear of complete meltdown rules markets,'' said a headline in
The Business Times on Monday over R. Sivanithy's column.
	   In Hong Kong's bustling financial district, many people stopped
at interactive terminals to check their shares on the Hang Seng.
	   One man said the government's recent intervention in Hong Kong's
markets had left it nearly impossible for people to know their real
value and whether to buy or sell shares.

Twenty-five people hospitalized after chlorine leak
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Twenty-five people were hospitalized and 350
people were evacuated following a chemical leak in a factory
Monday, radio reports said.
	   Fire officials said the leaked chlorine was suspected to have
come from the sewage treatment facility in the basement of the
factory, which is in an industrial area, state-owned Radio Hong
Kong reported.
	   The chlorine was not in highly concentrated form, Lau Fei-lung,
chief of service at United Christian Hospitals, where 21 of the
people were hospitalized, told the radio. He added inhalation of
the chemical in highly concentrated form could be fatal.
	   The radio reported that a 41-year old woman was in critical
condition and receiving treatment in intensive care, and 20 others
were in stable condition. The condition of four others was not
known, it said.
	   The leak caused no danger to the surrounding area, fire
officials said. No other details were available.

Kia Motors auction seen as failing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Creditors have apparently failed to
auction off bankrupt Kia Motors Co., South Korea's second largest
automaker, news reports said Monday.
	   Ford Motor Co. and three South Korean carmakers _ Hyundai Motor
Co., Daewoo Motor Co. and Samsung Motors, Inc. _ submitted bids for
Kia in mid-August.
	   The successful bidder was to be announced Tuesday.
	   But state-run Yonhap News Agency and several independent
newspapers reported that all of the bidders failed to meet terms
set by Kia's creditor banks.
	   Ford and Hyundai submitted bids below the minimum price set by
the creditors, and all four bidders demanded that creditors write
off more of Kia's debt, Yonhap reported.
	   Officials at Kia and its creditor banks refused comment, saying
an official announcement will be made Tuesday.
	   To make the failed company more attractive to bidders, the
creditor banks agreed to write off nearly half of Kia's dlrs 6.7
billion debt. Kia has dlrs 5.9 billion in assets.
	   In July, five companies, including General Motors Co., said they
would bid for Kia and its commercial vehicle arm, Asia Motors Corp.
But GM pulled out in the last minute.
	   The successful bidder must buy at least 51 percent of the equity
of Kia and Asia Motors through the auction. Ford already owns 16.9
percent of Kia.
	   Kia's collapse in July, 1997, helped erode investors' confidence
in South Korea's bloated, inefficient industries, leading to a
flight of capital.
	   South Korea called in the International Monetary Fund in
December to organize a record dlrs 58 billion bailout of its
economy.
	   The move to sell Kia is part of the government's effort to
restructure the economy under the IMF bailout terms.
	   Kia produced 780,000 cars in 1997. Asia Motors can turn out
250,000 vehicles, mostly trucks and buses. The two companies employ
more than 18,000 workers.

Grand Champions Takanohana, Akebono take top seats in Tokyo tourney
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO, Japan (AP) _ Grand champion Takanohana will compete in
next month's sumo tournament as the top-ranked yokozuna of the
east, while rival Akebono, or Hawaii-born Chad Rowan, leads the
contingent of wrestlers from the west, the Japan Sumo Association
said Monday.
	   The 25-year old Takanohana's bid for a perfect record in last
month's Nagoya Grand Sumo Tournament was spoiled by a final round
loss to Akebono, forcing the yokozuna to settle for a 14-1 record
in clinching his 19th tournament title.
	   Akebono, 29, who became the first foreign-born wrestler to reach
yokozuna (grand champion) rank in 1993, ended at 11-4.
	   A rematch between Akebono and Takanohana was expected to be
among the highlights of the upcoming 14-day Grand Sumo Tournament
in Tokyo, which gets underway Sept. 13 at Tokyo's Ryogoku Kokugikan
Sumo Area.
	   Ozeki Musashimaru, or Fiamalu Penitani from Hawaii, was ranked
third in the east behind 27-year old yokozuna Wakanohana, the older
brother of Takanohana.
	   Musashimaru, also 27, finished last month's tournament with a
12-3 performance after defeating Wakanohana in the final round.
Wakanohana chalked up a 10-5 record.
	   Takanonami, 26, who finished at 9-6 in Nagoya, will hold the top
ozeki spot in the west. Then comes Dejima, who was promoted to
komusubi from No. 4 maegashira, or senior wrestler, after a 10-5
record last month which won him a second Outstanding Performance
Award.
	   Kyokushuzan, or Mongolian Batbayar Davaa, was promoted to No. 5
maegashira from No. 11 after a 9-6 record in the previous tourney.
	   Fellow Mongolian Kyokutenho, or Tsevegnyam Nyamjav, fell back to
No. 5 in the juryo division, the lowest-ranking senior division,
from the No. 15 maegashira spot. He finished 4-11 in Nagoya.
	   Hoshitango, or Argentine Imach Marcelo Salomon, was promoted to
No. 13 juryo from No. 2 in makushita, the top junior division,
following his 6-1 performance last month.
	   In makushita, Yamato, or American George Kalima, was demoted to
No. 49 from No. 9 after sitting out the previous tournament.
	   Hoshiandesu, or Argentine Jose Antonio Juarez, rose to No. 7
from No. 10 for his 4-3 record.
	   Kaishinzan, or American Henry Armstrong Miller, was promoted to
No. 12 from No. 16 after finishing 4-3 in Nagoya.
	   Wakaazuma, or Yoshinobu Kuroda from Brazil, rose to No. 20 from
No. 27 for his 4-3 record. Compatriot Ikemori, or Luis Go Ikemori,
was demoted from No. 50 in makushita to No. 2 in the sandanme, or
second-highest junior division, for a 3-4 record.
	   Kitaazuma, or Brazilian Tetsuya Takeda, climbed to No. 45 in
makushita from No. 56 after a 4-3 showing in the last tourney.
	   In sandanme, Kyokutenzan, or Mongolian Enkhbat Batmunkha, rose
to No. 6 from No. 17 for a 4-3 record. Azumakaze, or Brazilian
Tussato Guiuliano Kotinda, rose to No. 33 from No. 65 after a 5-2
performance.
	   Kuniazuma, or Brazilian Vader Ramos, fell from No. 67 in
sandanme to No. 27 in jonidan, the third-highest ranking junior
division.

Army officer suspected of murdering researcher surrenders
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A Thai army officer, who is also a
convicted heroin smuggler, turned himself into police Monday for
questioning in the murder of a researcher at the country's top
think tank.
	   Smiling at reporters and looking confident, Patchara Phrompao, a
captain attached to the military's Supreme Command office,
surrendered to police in Bangkok on Monday. His surrender was
carried on several Thai television stations.
	   An alleged accomplice, already in custody, has said that in
early August Patchara beat the researcher to death after raping
him.
	   The researcher, Poolsawad Jiraporn of the Thai Development and
Research Institute, got into a quarrel with the officer and his
friends at a Bangkok discotheque, the accomplice told police
according to Monday's The Nation newspaper.
	   Patchara was originally named Manas Bophrom. He was arrested in
Sydney, Australia, in 1993 for attempting to smuggle 3.5 kilograms
(7.7 pounds) of heroin into the country and ended up serving four
years in an Australian prison, according to an officer with the
Supreme Command who spoke only on condition of anonymity.
	   Patchara was a captain in the military at the time of his
arrest.
	   After he was released, he returned to Thailand, changed his name
and was reinstated into the Thai military and assigned to the
Supreme Command.
	   The officer told The Associated Press that the Supreme Command
usually does a background check on personnel assigned to work
there, and didn't know why this wasn't done in Patchara's case.
	   The Supreme Command would have to investigate how ``this
mistake'' happened, he said.

A year later: Princess Diana mourned in public and in private
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with new quotes and material &QL; 
 &UR; By AUDREY WOODS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CRATHIE, Scotland (AP) _ A year after Princess Diana's death,
thousands of people commemorated one of the most public lives of
modern times Monday, while those who knew her best marked the
anniversary of a very private grief in the seclusion of their
Scottish castle.
	   Diana's beloved boys, Prince William, 16, and Prince Harry, 13,
were with the rest of the royal family at Balmoral Castle, where
their father woke them last Aug. 31 to tell them of their mother's
fatal car crash.
	   The pile of flowers at the gates of the princess' former home at
Kensington Palace in London grew to about a thousand bouquets
Monday morning. Messages in many languages, photographs taken from
newspapers, and paper hearts adorned the black and gold palace
gates. Scores of well-wishers held an all-night candle-lit vigil,
and public memorial services were planned at the city's great
cathedrals.
	   The national flag, the Union Jack, flew at half staff on
government buildings and royal residences, as an official symbol of
the personal and public remembrance of Diana. Queen Elizabeth II
was criticized after the princess' death for not lowering the royal
standard at Buckingham Palace in her memory.
	   But for Diana's family it was a day for quiet reflection _
private prayers for her sons at the tiny stone church of Crathie
parish, just outside Balmoral Castle's gates and across the rushing
waters of the River Dee, and a private service near her island
grave at her family's ancestral home, Althorp, for her brother and
sisters.
	   The queen on Monday thanked people who have sent many messages
of sympathy, through the royal website as well as in the mail.
	   ``The queen and the royal family, particularly the Prince of
Wales, Prince William and Prince Harry, would like to thank people
for their messages and kind gestures of sympathy at this sad time
and for sharing their remembrance of the Princess of Wales,'' said
a royal statement.
	   Crowds and congregations in London, Paris and at Balmoral
remembered Diana Sunday and early Monday with tears, flowers and
prayers. But there were no repeats of last year's huge crowds _
just a constant stream of people visiting Kensington Palace,
Althorp and to the scene of the Paris car crash a year ago.
	   When the royal party left for Crathie church on Monday morning,
there were only about 20 spectators and half a dozen bouquets
against the wall.
	   ``I feel disappointed for the royal family that more people
aren't here.,'' said Tim Bunday, 31, who was on vacation from
southern England and brought his two-year-old son, Toby, to see the
royals. ``Maybe people think it's more respectful not to be here
today.''
	   At Crathie church on Sunday, the royal family heard the Rev.
Robert Sloan pray for them.
	   ``Hear our prayers for those grieving the loss of a loved one in
circumstances known to the world but only experienced by a few,''
Sloan said, as William and Harry sat on either side of their
father, Prince Charles, in the front pew.
	   Balmoral, Queen Victoria's ``dear paradise'' of mountains,
moorlands, forests and salmon streams, has been a vacation retreat
for the royal family since 1855 and they visit off and on during
the year, particularly in late summer.
	   But they came together en masse, with spouses and children, to
be present for the anniversary of Diana's death. Prime Minister
Tony Blair and his wife, Cherie, who were at Balmoral for the
annual prime ministerial weekend, also attended the family prayers
Monday morning.
	   At Althorp, 75 miles (120 kms) north of London, away from the
public gaze, Diana's brother, Earl Spencer and her sisters, Lady
Sarah McCorquodale and Lady Jane Fellowes, planned a service near
her burial site on an island in an ornamental lake. The estate and
the museum in Diana's memory closed for the season on Sunday after
receiving 152,000 visitors who paid up to 9 pounds (dlrs 15.75)
each.
	   At St. James's Palace, where Harry and William live in London
with Prince Charles, Diana's former employees and other members of
the royal household were expected to attend a service of
remembrance in the chapel where the princess's coffin rested before
her funeral.
	   Diana's face appeared on front pages of most of the national
newspapers on Sunday, and half a dozen special programs were
offered on television.
	   Sir Elton John, whose adaptation of ``Candle in the Wind'' in
memory of Diana captured the grief of millions around the world,
criticized her family's decision to bury her on a tiny island far
from her sons and her adoring public.
	   The rock star, in an interview with The Sunday Telegraph, said
Diana should have been buried in Westminster Abbey, where her
funeral took place.
	   ``I just feel it's sad that she's on that island _ it's as if
she's all alone again,'' he was quoted as saying.
	   A granite and bronze sculpture of Diana and Dodi Fayed, the
lover with whom she died, was unveiled Monday at Harrods, the
London store owned by Fayed's father.
	   It was a public ``bank'' holiday on Monday and commemorations
seemed modest, reflecting recent opinion polls indicating many
Britons found last year's mourning excessive.
	   The Daily Telegraph on Friday published the results of a
telephone survey by Gallup which found that 94 percent of those
questioned said they had no plans to mark the anniversary. While 28
percent wanted the day to be an occasion for national remembrance,
69 percent thought it should be left for individuals to mark as
they choose.

	   One of Diana's closest friends, Rosa Monckton, the president of
Tiffany's London operation, said the princess would be appalled at
the cult that has grown up around her since her death.
	   ``This whole Diana industry, which is so sordid, should stop and
she should rest in peace,'' Monckton told BBC Radio 4.

Malaysia observes national day amid economic gloom

	   GELUGOR, Malaysia (AP) _ Thousands of Malaysians turned out
Monday for National Day celebrations, craning their necks to
glimpse F-18 jets shrieking above rain clouds and standing at
attention as the national anthem was played.
	   Army helicopters clattered nearby. Soldiers marched down the
street, barking commands. Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad smiled
and waved as marching bands and school children paraded by on the
northwestern resort island of Penang.
	   But for most of Malaysia's 22 million citizens, giddiness over
their nation's breakneck economic growth in recent decades has long
turned to sober preparations for stormier days.
	   At this year's celebrations marking independence from Britain in
1957, a sense of foreboding cast a shadow over the colorful
festivities.
	   Malaysia's export-driven economy has ground to a halt, with its
booming 8 percent growth for the last decade shrinking by nearly 7
percent this quarter, pitching the country into full-blown
recession.
	   Since Malaysia caught the Asian contagion that has swept the
region since July 1997, its currency, the ringgit, has fallen
nearly 40 percent. Share prices on the stock exchange have dived.
	   ``You see the ringgit going up, going down,'' said Winnie Tan,
28, an accountant, as she watched the school children and police
battalions parade past her.
	   ``But I didn't really see how bad things were until I saw my own
friends losing their jobs.''
	   Malaysians are now bracing for a wave of bankruptcies, rising
inflation and unemployment rates. More than 2,600 people lose their
jobs every week, according to the latest Human Resources Ministry
report.
	   Still, Mahathir remains stoic.
	   ``Thank God, so far we have managed to defend our country,'' he
said in his nationally televised National Day speech.
	   ``We must strive on our own to revive our nation's economy and
defend our sovereignty and independence,'' he said.
	   The 72-year-old leader _ at the helm for 17 years and currently
the world's longest-ruling elected head of a democratic government
_ is credited for having led Malaysia out of the rubber plantations
and into the global markets.
	   Mahathir has vowed to get the economy back on track before he
steps down, and for months he has waged a war of words against
foreigners whom he blames for the downfall.
	   Malaysia's enemies, Mahathir said in his speech, are invisible
hedge-fund operators and currency speculators who rule the global
financial system with impunity as they attempt to ruin leaders and
topple governments.
	   ``Outsiders never wish to see Malaysia recover, by continuously
attacking the country's currency and the stock market whenever the
government initiates measures to revive the nation's economy,''
said Mahathir, in a familiar theme.
	   He called on Malaysians to stand tall and prepare for difficult
times.
	   ``The government's ultimate aim is to revive the economy and
restore the dignity of the race and the nation,'' he told his
compatriots.
	   Then Mahathir and his Cabinet ministers raced back to the
capital, Kuala Lumpur, to prepare for an emergency Cabinet session
Tuesday.

	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Credit Suisse Group Monday said
Winterthur Insurance has indicated its intention to sell its
reinsurance business to Bermuda-based Partner RE for 1.13 billion
Swiss francs (dlrs 754 million).
	   The sale represents a second important step towards
concentrating on Winterthur's core insurance activities, Credit
Suisse said in a press release.
	   Winterthur has sent a letter of intent to sell and a final
contract is expected to be signed by Oct. 1, Credit Suisse said.

Europe.
	   One of the main activities of reinsurance businesses is insuring
insurance companies.

Australian insurer HIH Winterthur in July. Partner RE is a unit of
Partnerre Ltd.
	   Credit Suisse banking group announced its takeover of
Winterthur, Switzerland's second biggest insurance company, last

North Korea rejects Seoul's proposal to exchange special envoys
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ North Korea officially rejected Monday
a South Korean proposal to exchange special envoys to discuss peace
on the divided Korean peninsula.
	   The North's official Korean Central News Agency said Monday that
the proposal, made by South Korean President Kim Dae-jung in an
Aug. 15 Independence Day address, had been ``unanimously rejected''
because of its ``fantastic, contradictory and deceptive nature.''
	   The KCNA said rapprochement talks between the two Koreas are
meaningless unless South Korea changes its policy of relying on
``outside forces'' for reunification of the peninsula.
	   North Korea has consistently demanded an end to the U.S.
military presence in South Korea. About 37,000 U.S. troops are
stationed in the South under a mutual defense treaty.
	   The Korean states remain arch-rivals since the division of their
peninsula into the communist North and the capitalist South in
1945. They fought a three-year war in the early 1950s.

Defiant and confident, Congolese rebels prepare for long war
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Congo

<TEXT>
	   GOMA, Congo (AP) _ From the capital, Kinshasa, government
victory may seem at hand. But from rebel-held eastern Congo,
insurgents plotting their next move say time is on their side.
	   ``The war is going on,'' rebel leader Ernest Wamba dia Wamba
told The Associated Press.
	   ``The government forces would've been by now completely out if
were not for the Angolans and Zimbabweans,'' troops sent in to
fight alongside those of President Laurent Kabila, Wamba said
Sunday.
	   ``But they cannot stay long. And we're going to continue
fighting no matter what.''
	   On Sunday, the rebels suffered a major defeat in a month-old
campaign to topple Kabila when they pulled out of Matadi, 350
kilometers (210 miles) southwest of Kinshasa _ the only remaining
air base in western Congo under their control.
	   Wamba said the rebel force in western Congo _ believed to number
between 6,000 and 9,000 troops _ had to withdraw to avoid being cut
in half by Angolan troops.
	   The result will be change in tactics: the rebels will split into
smaller, mobile groups ready to strike Kinshasa at times,
infiltrate the city and lie low until the departure of Kabila's
allies, he said.
	   ``It's a matter of what kind of war,'' the 56-year-old former
Harvard political economy lecturer said. ``It is my understanding
that now, we are conducting the guerrilla-type war.''
	   ``Nobody can rule effectively only with foreign support,'' he
said. ``Zimbabwe cannot stay for a long time. Angola may not stay
for longer either. They have too many fronts open against them:
they have to be in Congo-Brazzaville, they have to deal with
(separatists) in Cabinda, they have to deal with Congo-Kinshasa,
and they are only 11 million people.''
	   Since the rebels _ a coalition of ethnic Tutsis, exiled
politicians and disenchanted members of Kabila's army _ took up
arms a month ago, they seized eastern Congo and closed in on
Kinshasa from the Atlantic Ocean, where they had airlifted
thousands of troops and equipment.
	   But the intervention of Angola and Zimbabwe appeared to have
warded off rebel advances at Kinshasa and saved Kabila _ at least
for time being.
	   The result could be a long and exhausting war.
	   ``We are trying to tell our people that this may not be a few
weeks' affair. It could be months, it could be years. The more
people get that sense that this is a worthwhile struggle, the
people will continue struggling,'' he said.
	   The rebels still control a string of towns in eastern Congo,
including the third-largest city of Kisangani from where supplies
can be ferried on the Congo River to rebels around Kinshasa, and
were reportedly advancing on the southern fronts.
	   The rebels accuse Kabila of power-grabbing, nepotism and
promoting his kinsmen from southern Katanga province in the
government, security services and the army.
	   ``Fundamentally, this is a problem of how power is being
misused,'' Wamba said. ``We need responsible leadership if we want
to have stability in Congo and regionally.''
	   Kabila accuses his erstwhile allies in Rwanda and Uganda of
sponsoring the rebellion and invading the country. Both countries
have threatened to intervene openly to protect their borders.
	   ``The very existance of Rwanda and Uganda requires at least in
Congo stability and peace,'' Wamba said. ``The hope of the region
was that with Kabila, security and peace of the area will be
established. But they are not there.''
	   Financing the war may not be so easy.
	   Wamba said the rebels controlled gold mines around Kisangani and
were collecting custums taxes to bankroll the rebellion as well as
negotiating international loans. He did not elaborate.
	   ``It is possible, if we organize ourselves very well, to
generate money which would have us sustain costs in a long (term)
way,'' he said.

Indonesian police battle protesters, dozens injured
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Police on Monday battled hundreds of
people protesting the inauguration of a governor in a provincial
capital, the official Antara news agency reported. Dozens of
people, including three police officers, were injured.
	   Violence broke out after crowds gathered at the local Parliament
building in Mataram, a coastal city on Lombok island, which is a
popular destination for tourists.
	   Protesters said the new governor, Harun Al-Rasjid, had been
elected in a rigged poll. A former vice governor of Jakarta, Harun
was elected by the local Parliament.
	   Antara quoted police chief Lt. Col. Junaidhy Thiansyah as saying
that dozens of people were injured, including three police officers
hit by stones. Seven cars were damaged.
	   Home Affairs Minister Syarwan Hamid was inside the Parliament
building and attending the inauguration during the riot.
	   Mataram, the capital of West Nusa Tenggara province, is 1,000
kilometers (625 miles) east of Jakarta.
	   There has been scattered unrest in several other areas of
Indonesia over the past week, some involving looters.
	   Indonesia is enduring the worst economic turmoil in decades and
deadly riots stemming from the hardship helped oust former
President Suharto in May.
	   Suharto's successor, B.J. Habibie, is moving Indonesia toward
democracy, freeing some political prisoners and scheduling general
elections next year.

Dollar lower, Tokyo stocks higher
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with late dollar, closing bond, comment, other
details &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ News that a major Japanese bank may get new capital
helped push Tokyo share prices moderately higher Monday. The U.S.
dollar fell against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average recovered some of
the ground it lost last Friday when it nose-dived to a 12-year low.
The Nikkei finished at 14,107.89 points, up 192.26 points, or 1.38
percent.
	   On Friday, the index lost 498.16 points, or 3.46 percent, to
13,915.63 _ its lowest finish since March 6, 1986.
	   Stocks rebounded after Sakura Bank said it was negotiating for a
massive infusion of new capital from Toyota Motor Corp. and Mitsui
Group firms.
	   ``The report about Sakura Bank and the yen's rebound are seen as
bullish for major bank shares,'' said Yasuo Ueki, a general manager
at Nikko Securities Co.
	   Dealers said people were hopeful that other banks would follow
suit and strengthen their finances. Sakura Bank shares rose in
Monday's trading but so did those of other banks.
	   They warned, however, that the risk of another drop remained.
	   Worries about the massive bad debt problem ailing banks at home
as well as the financial turmoil abroad _ which had set off the
massive selloff last Friday _ were likely to weight down on the
Nikkei's further rise, said Sachio Ishikawa, general manager at
Chuo Securities.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section of the exchange rose 19.50 points, or 1.79 percent,
to 1,106.49. It had fallen 29.98 points, or 2.68 percent, to close
at 1,086.99 Friday.
	   Volume on the first section was estimated at 433 million shares,
down from 565.82 million shares Friday. Advancers beat declining
issues 876 to 295, while 144 issues were unchanged.
	   In currency trading, the dollar cost 141.52 yen in late trading,
down 1.80 yen from late in Tokyo on Friday and also below its level
of 141.85 yen in late New York trading Friday. During the day, it
ranged from 140.77 yen to 141.90 yen.
	   The dollar jumped briefly on news midday that Japan's Defense
Agency reported North Korea fired a missile toward the Sea of
Japan. Investors tend to seek the dollar as a haven during times of
international crisis.
	   But other factors as lingering worries about the drop on Wall
Street last week and the dim outlook for political stability in
Russia were a dampener on the dollar's rise, traders said.
	   The Dow Jones Industrial Average extended its slide Friday,
falling 114.31 points to 8,051.68. In Russia, a compromise deal
between key parliamentary leaders and President Boris Yeltsin fell
apart late Sunday.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond declined to 1.040 percent from Friday's finish of
1.070 percent, driving its price up to 112.86 yen from 112.65 yen.

	   MATADI, Congo (AP) _ Angolan troops fighting on behalf of
President Laurent Kabila are prepared to attack rebel-held
territory in eastern Congo after capturing key rebel positions in
the west, a senior commander said.
	   ``The only way for life to become normal is to end this
conflict,'' said Angolan army chief of staff Joao de Matos. ``We
are ready to move east to do that.''
	   Kabila's cabinet director, Abdoulaye Yerodia on Monday said a
counter-offensive in the east was in the works _ a push that would
move this central African country's civil war away from the capital
and into rebel-dominated terrain.
	   A rebel coalition backed by Rwanda and Uganda had been poised
just weeks ago to topple Kabila's government and capture the
capital, Kinshasa.
	   Kabila regrouped and enlisted the help of Angola, Zimbabwe and
Namibia _ a move that turned the tables on the rebels, but has also
internationalized Congo's war and threatens the stability of an
already troubled region.
	   Yerodia said Congo's Angolan allies had offered to come here to
fight the rebels where necessary, even if it takes them to Congo's
eastern border with Rwanda.
	   ``Our Angolan and Zimbabwean allies are hear to kick out the
Rwanda-Ugandan aggressors,'' Yerodia said. ``They are not selective
about where they have to do that.''
	   Angolan troops and tanks rumbled into the strategic Congolese
port town of Matadi after the rebel forces deserted their
positions.
	   The loss of Matadi, one of the last major rebel strongholds in
Congo's southwest, is a blow to the insurgent force.
	   A fire at Matadi's port _ the only major Congo River port
serving inland southwestern Congo _ raged in one warehouse, but the
shipping facility was otherwise undamaged and city streets were
deserted.
	   Several gunmen from the Angola's UNITA rebel force were arrested
in Matadi, confirming suspicions that Congo's insurgents had been
cooperating with the UNITA movement.
	   Away from Matadi, Angolan troops also were in control of a
massive power dam at the town of Inga, which provides electricity
to much of southwestern Congo and the neighboring Republic of
Congo.
	   Electricity in Kinshasa was still off due to a technical fault
in the power lines linking to capital to Inga, the dam's director
Daniel Yeuga Massawpu said.
	   The rebels acknowledged the loss of Matadi and Inga.
	   ``We have tactically withdrawn from Matadi and Inga so our
forces can concentrate on Kinshasa,'' the rebel leader Ernest Wamba
dia Wamba said.
	   The capital Kinshasa was quiet Monday morning after days of
pitched combat on its western and eastern suburbs left bodies
scattered through the streets and triggered a vicious spree of
lynching and summary executions.
	   Rebel leader Jean-Pierre Ondekane, however, remained defiant and
insisted the fight to oust Kabila would continue.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Communist opposition said Monday it would
block the approval of a new prime minister following the collapse
of a proposed truce with Boris Yeltsin, despite Russia's growing
economic crisis.
	   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov said his party and other
hard-line groups would vote against confirming acting Prime
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin because the government had not made
enough concessions on reducing Yeltsin's powers.
	   President Yeltsin said he would nominate Chernomyrdin again if
the lower chamber of parliament, the Duma, votes against the
premier, aides said.
	   Both sides warned that popular discontent could explode if the
crisis continues. ``If we fail to reach an agreement here
everything will spill out to the streets,'' Zyuganov said.
	   Yeltsin's parliament envoy Alexander Kotenkov warned the
opposition that both sides could be swept aside if there is no
swift action to end the crisis.
	   ``If this chaos lasts for several more weeks, it may happen that
there will be neither Communists nor us,'' he said. ``I mean a
popular uprising, merciless and senseless.''
	   Some Communist leaders said they were not afraid of government
threats to dissolve the legislature because they were confident of
winning the elections that would follow.
	   The government insisted it remained in control and that work on
tackling the country's economic crisis was going ahead. ``It is
business as usual for government headquarters,'' said government
spokesman Igor Shabdurasulov.
	   Zyuganov said the opposition would vote Monday against
Chernomyrdin's appointment, but indicated he was ready for more
negotiations on a deal, signaling a deal was still possible.
	   ``There's no guarantee that full agreement will be reached
today. We're ready to take another look at it today,'' he told
reporters.
	   Chernomyrdin met with several leftist factions Monday behind
closed doors, attempting to salvage the truce. He also met with
Yeltsin, who was at work Monday in the Kremlin, according to
officials.
	   There was no sign of panic in Moscow and other cities Monday as
people headed to work. The Russian currency staged a mild recovery
after last week's sharp falls.
	   Government and opposition leaders reached tentative agreement
Sunday on a pact under which parliament would approve the new
government and give it a chance to solve the economic crisis. In
return, President Yeltsin was to give parliament a bigger role in
approving the Cabinet.
	   But the Communists rejected the deal Sunday evening. Zyuganov
said his party's leadership could not support the pact because
there was no firm guarantee Yeltsin would abide by its provisions.
	   The Kremlin said Monday that Yeltsin would not accept the truce
until the opposition accepted it.
	   The breakdown appeared likely to usher in a period of political
head-butting similar to the one that surrounded the nomination of
the previous prime minister, Sergei Kiriyenko, last spring. The
Communists want maximum concessions from the government and don't
want to anger their supporters by appearing to give in too easily.
	   Under the constitution, the lower house of parliament, the State
Duma, can vote three times on a prime minister's nomination.
	   In the case of Kiriyenko, the Communist-led Duma twice voted no,
then caved in on the third vote after trying to wrest concessions
from the government.
	   The nationalist Liberal Democratic Party joined the Communists
in vowing not to sign the deal, as did the social democratic
Yabloko party. Yabloko leaders had said from the start that they
wouldn't support Chernomyrdin's nomination.
	   The political stalemate couldn't come at a worse time for the
Russian government, which is trying to stabilize an economy that
has been seriously damaged by the devaluation of the national
currency, the ruble, and the government's default on its debts.
	   Chernomyrdin said swift formation of a new government was vital
to tackle the crisis.
	   ``We must resolve financial problems. The ruble is hanging by a
thread,'' he said. ``So if we have a political agreement and the
president accepts it _ let's start working.''
	   The proposed three-page agreement would have given the State
Duma, parliament's lower house, more say in Cabinet appointments,
but leave Yeltsin with substantial power, despite earlier
opposition calls for his removal.
	   The president would have retained control of the security
forces. In exchange, Yeltsin would have agreed to Duma approval of
most Cabinet appointments for the first time, according to
lawmakers and media reports.
	   The draft, which was not made public, would also have obliged
both sides to maintain a political truce. But the deal was on paper
only and Yeltsin would have retained his legal powers to dissolve
the Duma.

Opposition shifts tactics as strongman pledges no violence
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with opposition condemns appellate ruling, shifts
tactics, grafs 4-7. Trims
 &UR; By KER MUNTHIT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Strongman Hun Sen pledged Monday not
to use violence against thousands of demonstrators staging a
round-the-clock vigil for the past week demanding his ouster.
	   But Hun Sen vowed he would not step down and insisted he would
rule the country as the sole prime minister following his declared
victory in parliamentary elections July 26.
	   The stage was set for more turmoil when the Constitutional
Council, the country's highest appeals body and stacked with Hun
Sen's supporters, rejected all opposition complaints of electoral
fraud Monday.
	   Opposition leader Sam Rainsy condemned the ruling, noting that
the council had ignored requests to delay its decision by one day
and that opposition representatives were not present.
	   ``We have no other alternative than to express our frustrations
through demonstrations,'' Sam Rainsy said at a news conference.
	   Significantly, Sam Rainsy indicated that the opposition was also
ready to give up plans to boycott the National Assembly when it
convenes Sept. 24. The opposition will control enough votes to deny
Hun Sen the two-thirds majority needed to form a government.
	   Hun Sen's cash-strapped administration will find itself in a
crunch unless it meets some opposition demands, Sam Rainsy said.
	   Hun Sen told reporters following a two-hour meeting with the
U.N. special representative in Cambodia, Lakhan Mehrotra, that the
opposition was trying to provoke a violent response through the
demonstrations, apparently to undermine his international standing.
	   Security forces have been ordered not to use violence as long
the demonstrations stay peaceful, Hun Sen said.
	   ``There won't be any response by arms from the part of the
government,'' Hun Sen said. ``If they can do it peacefully, no
problem if it goes on for three months, six months or even one
year.''
	   Sam Rainsy later scoffed: ``I don't think Hun Sen will be in
power in three to six months. In a matter of days and weeks, we
will hopefully break the present political deadlock.''
	   Earlier, King Norodom Sihanouk urged dialogue to end the
protests, which he said were bringing shame to the nation.
	   The demonstrations, unprecedented in size and duration, have
turned a park outside the National Assembly into a tent city at
times swarming with as many as 15,000 people.
	   They are demanding that Hun Sen step down and that opposition
complaints of massive fraud by the ruling Cambodian People's Party
in the elections be properly investigated.
	   The opposition leaders, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, the king's
son, and Sam Rainsy have demanded that a formula giving the CPP a
majority of 64 of the 122 National Assembly seats with just 41
percent of the vote be modified.
	   International observers gave the polls a generally credible bill
of health, but issued their assessments well before counting _
which took 10 days _ was completed.
	   The protest showed the first sign of turning violent Sunday,
when about a dozen people tried to destroy a Vietnamese soldier
depicted in a Vietnam-Cambodian friendship statue in the park.
	   In Hanoi, the Communist Party newspaper Nhan Dan reported Monday
that Vietnam has strongly denounced the attack, branding it
shameful and contemptible.
	   Suspicion and hatred of Vietnam, Cambodia's historic enemy, runs
deep. Though Vietnamese troops toppled the genocidal Khmer Rouge in
1979, a harsh, decade-long occupation followed.
	   Hun Sen rose to power under the occupation and is regarded by
many of his countrymen as too pro-Hanoi. But he remains Cambodia's
most powerful politician, toppling the Ranariddh as co-prime
minister in a bloody coup last year.
	   Sihanouk claimed in a fax that the nonviolent rallies have led
the international community ``to strongly scorn us and to lose any
intention to help Cambodia any more.''
	   The result can only be more misery for the poverty-stricken
nation, Sihanouk said.

North Korea fires missile into seas between Russia and Japan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with reports Japan has sent ships; South Korea
confirms the type of missile; RECASTS throughout &QL; 
 &UR; By TODD ZAUN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ North Korea test-fired a newly developed,
long-range ballistic missile into seas between Russia and
northwestern Japan on Monday, seriously upping the security stakes
in an already volatile corner of Asia.
	   The launch just after noon (0300 GMT) was confirmed by Japanese,
South Korean and United States defense officials.
	   Japan's Defense Agency, quoting unidentified U.S. military
officials based here, said the missile was probably aimed at open
seas between Russia and Japan.
	   It was believed to have landed in waters about 300 kilometers
(190 miles) southeast of Vladivostok, Russia.
	   The missile was ``confirmed to be a brand-new `Daepodong I' with
a range of 2,000 kilometers (1,240 miles),'' the South Korean
Defense Ministry said in a statement. That range is twice as long
as the North's previous staple ``Rodong'' series missiles.
	   It was the secretive North's fourth test-firing of a missile
since 1984 and its first in five years.
	   Japanese media quoted military sources as saying two patrol
boats and an airplane were immediately dispatched to the area where
the missile hit. But it was unclear whether they could actually go
to the site _ which was believed to be close to or possibly inside
Russian waters.
	   Defense Agency officials refused to comment on what measures
Japan had taken.
	   American officials would only confirm there had been a launch.
	   ``We can confirm that it did happen. The Defense Department
feels it is a serious development and will be evaluating the
situation,'' U.S. Defense Department spokesman Jim Kout said in
Washington.
	   Japanese media quoted a senior Defense Agency official as saying
the launch was not totally a surprise _ security experts, he said,
had been expecting the North to conduct some kind of training
exercise earlier this month.
	   But very little is known about North Korea's missile program,
and its possession of a significantly better missile would be a
matter of serious concern throughout the region.
	   North Korea's best known ballistic missile is the Rodong, which
has a range of about 1,000 kilometers (620 miles). It was last test
fired in 1993, and also landed in the same area of the Sea of
Japan, which divides the Korean Peninsula from Japan.
	   In 1996, the United States began talks with North Korea aimed at
persuading the secretive Communist country to freeze its missile
program and to join an international agreement designed to restrict
missile proliferation. The talks stalled.
	   Japan is currently boosting its budget for joint development of
a missile defense system with the United States, and has reportedly
earmarked 500 million yen (dlrs 3.6 million) for the project next
year.
	   The United States has 37,000 troops stationed in South Korea,
many of them based near its border with North Korea. It has roughly
another 50,000 troops in Japan.
	   With its 1,000 kilometer (620-mile range), the Rodong I missile,
a modified Scud system, could strike South Korea and much of Japan.
	   North Korea is also believed to have developed and deployed
Soviet-designed Scud B and Scud C missiles, with ranges of 340
kilometers (210 miles) and 500 kilometers(310 miles), respectively.

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Swisscom, the state-owned Swiss
telecommunication giant planning to go public in the fall, is
valued at around 31-36 billion Swiss francs (dlrs 20.7-24 billion),
according to estimates in a report released Monday by U.S.
investment bank J.P. Morgan.
	   Earlier estimates from analysts had put Swisscom's total equity
value at around 20 billion Swiss francs (dlrs 13.4 billion).
	   J.P. Morgan said its estimate is based on an analysis of the
European telecom peer group's cash flow and earnings multiples,
with tax-adjusted multiples suggesting higher valuations.
	   J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co., together with Warburg Dillon Read and Credit
Suisse First Boston, act as joint lead manager for Swisscom's
initial public offering in North America, while J.P. Morgan
(Switzerland) is one of the co-leads for the initial public
offering in Switzerland.
	   The government plans to sell up to 49.9 percent of Swisscom
shares at the IPO.
	   Swisscom, formerly the telecommunications arm of the Swiss
government's postal service, confirmed in June its intention to
float on the stock market. It would represent Switzerland's biggest
privatization to date.

Report: Thailand's top crime boss wants top Cabinet post for son
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: ADDS Democrat denial in graf 4; Raises reference to number of
Kamnan Poh's supporters &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's reputed top crime boss says
he is being courted by the Democrat Party of Prime Minister Chuan
Leekpai, the Bangkok Post reported Monday.
	   Somchai Khunpluem _ known widely as Kamnan Poh _ told the paper,
however, that he would remain loyal to the Chart Thai (Thai Nation)
party as long as his son Sonthaya, a Chart Thai member of
parliament, is one of the top five candidates for a Cabinet post
after the next election.
	   Kamnan Poh, who says the Democrats approached him recently for
his supprt, claims to have about a half million followers in his
hometown of Chonburi, 70 kilometers (44 miles) south of Bangkok, in
Thailand's industrial heartland.
	   The Democrats have the cleanest reputation among Thai political
parties. Party spokesman Laddawan Wongsriwong said she is not aware
of any dialogue between the party and Kamnan Poh.
	   Kamnan Poh's son is already deputy communications minister.
Chart Thai, led by former Prime Minister Banharn Silpa-archa, is
part of the coalition government.
	   If Sonthaya were one of the party's top five candidates, and the
party was included in the next coalition government, he would most
probably be a full minister.
	   No election is scheduled before 2000, but no elected Thai
government has ever completed its term of office.
	   Attempts to imprison Kamnan Poh on various charges have failed.
He reportedly runs a criminal empire that controls gambling,
prostitution and smuggling along the Eastern Seaboard.
	   He revels in his reputation as a godfather, and has made an
autobiographical movie in which he starred as himself.

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Credit Suisse Group Monday said
Winterthur Insurance has indicated its intention to sell its
reinsurance business to Bermuda-based Partner RE for 1.13 billion
Swiss francs (dlrs 754 million).
	   The sale represents a second important step towards
concentrating on Winterthur's core insurance activities, Credit
Suisse said in a press release.
	   Winterthur has sent a letter of intent to sell and a final
contract is expected to be signed by Oct. 1, Credit Suisse said.
	   The sale is subject to regulatory approval in the U.S. and
Europe.
	   One of the main activities of reinsurance businesses is insuring
insurance companies.
	   The sale follows Winterthur's sale of its 51 percent stake in
Australian insurer HIH Winterthur in July. Partner RE is a unit of
Partnerre Ltd.
	   Credit Suisse banking group announced its takeover of
Winterthur, Switzerland's second biggest insurance company, last
year.

Stocks dive as government halts buying spree
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with closing figures, lede, grafs 14-6 &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos101-4
 &UR; By PRISCILLA CHEUNG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong stocks dived Monday as the government
halted its two-week stock buying spree, with the key index plunging
more than 7 percent, analysts said.
	   Meanwhile, analysts and researchers are split as to whether new
measures intended to curb futures speculation go far enough.
	   To fend off speculators, the government started scooping up huge
amounts of shares in the past two weeks, and successfully drove up
prices to a level at which speculators who bet against the market
suffered huge losses.
	   To further protect the market, the Hong Kong Futures Exchange
announced at the weekend new measures to make it more expensive for
speculators to place bets in the futures market.
	   It said it would require investors to come up with more cash
when buying or selling more than 10,000 futures contracts.
	   In addition, it is now requiring members to report and identify
anyone holding 250 contracts or more. Previously, the reporting
level had been 500 contracts, and market players could remain
anonymous.
	   Josephine Hui, research director of Celestial Asia Securities,
said speculators still could easily evade the new reporting rules
by spreading their purchases among several brokerages. Tracking
down these speculators would be extremely time-consuming, she said.
	   ``They would need a lot of time, resources and manpower to catch
thieves. We're fighting a quick battle, but these measures would
allow speculators to buy time to come up with new strategies,'' she
said.
	   Norman Chan, associate investment research director at Allen
Perkins Ltd., said the new measures would drive off genuine
investors and further hurt market sentiment. The measures can plug
loopholes but could do little to bring order to chaotic futures
trading.
	   ``Investors start to flee when they see the government changing
the rule of the game,'' at a time when market sentiment is
extremely negative, Chan said.
	   Ho Lok-sang, head of the economics department at Lingnan
College, said the government, as an active market player, would
have an unfair advantage over other market players with the new
reporting rules.
	   But he said ``I don't see any problem as long as the government
can separate its dual role as a market player and a market
regulator.''
	   On Monday, at the cramped quarters of the futures exchange,
futures traders in striped jackets emblazoned with the colors of
their firms were hastily dashing around, calling out and signaling
their orders.
	   The blue-chip Hang Seng Index fell 7.1 percent, or 554.70
points, to close at 7,275.04, as the government stopped buying
shares.
	   Trading volume plunged to 6.57 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S.
dlrs 842 million), a fraction of Friday's 79.0 billion (U.S. dlrs
10.1 billion) when the government intervention reached a climax.
	   The index shed 1.2 percent Friday, but was 1,200 points higher
than two weeks ago.

Big tumble in Hong Kong and Singapore, but Tokyo prices rise

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ As Asian markets reopened Monday after last week's
global stock market rout, share prices fell sharply in Hong Kong
and Singapore. But they rose in Japan, despite more bad news about
Russia's economic and political stability.
	   After only seven minutes of trading in Hong Kong, the Hang Seng
Index was down 5.7 percent. By closing, it had fallen even further,
shedding 7.1 percent, or 554.70 points, to 7,275.04.
	   In Singapore, where the benchmark index had crashed through the
crucial 900-point level for the first time in 10 years Friday,
shares fell 28.83 points, or 3.25 percent, to a new low of 856.43.
	   However, on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, where the benchmark
225-issue Nikkei Stock Average had sunk to a 12-year low Friday,
stock prices rose moderately Monday, gaining 192.26 points, or 1.38
percent, to close the day at 14,107.89.
	   ``Given the big falls we had last week, world markets may be
taking a breather. But generally the fundamentals in Japan and Asia
as a whole remain bleak,'' Peter Morgan, a senior economist at HSBC
Securities Japan, Ltd., said in an interview.
	   Elsewhere in Asia, the key stock index in Taiwan fell 2.8
percent to finish at a 22-month low, and stocks ended up rising 1.8
percent in South Korea, falling 1.4 percent in Australia, and
remaining nearly unchanged in the Philippines.
	   Across Asia, Europe and the Americas, many stock markets fell by
big percentages last week. That left some people wondering if the
year-old Asian financial crisis, and the recessions it has caused
in regional powerhouses such as Japan and Hong Kong, could spread
to the West and sour its economies.
	   On Sunday, Japan's chief economic planner, Taichi Sakaiya,
proposed an emergency summit of major industrialized countries to
address the chaos roiling world financial markets.
	   In the United States, the Dow Jones Industrial average dropped
357 points Thursday and 114.31 points Friday, leaving it at
8,051.68. That shrank 1998's gain to 1.8 percent. At July's peak,
the Dow had been up 18.1 percent.
	   To make matters worse, the ruble recently collapsed in Russia,
setting off political and economic instability there.
	   On Saturday, Russia's new acting prime minister, Viktor
Chernomyrdin, began negotiating a power-sharing agreement with the
Russian parliament and reassured markets around the world that the
country would not return to a Soviet-style economy.
	   But on Sunday, hours after the interim government and
parliamentary leaders agreed to an 18-month truce that would leave
Boris Yeltsin in control and give the administration time to try to
end the crisis, the agreement collapsed after the communists
rejected it.
	   In Hong Kong on Monday, the blue-chip Hang Seng Index fell
sharply when the government largely reduced its role in trading.
	   For two weeks, Hong Kong's government had been buying stocks to
drive the index to a level at which speculators who bet on stock
prices falling would lose money.
	   On Friday, that aggressive government buying pushed trading
volume to a record U.S. dlrs 10.1 billion. Traders estimated the
government spent U.S. dlrs 9.1 billion.
	   Speculators suddenly found it more expensive Monday to bet
against Hong Kong markets because of new measures taken by the
Futures Exchange over the weekend to curb manipulation.
	   On Saturday, the futures exchange announced it would require
market players to come up with more cash when buying or selling
more than 10,000 futures contracts. In addition, it is now
requiring members to report and identify anyone holding 250
contracts or more. Previously, the reporting level had been 500
contracts, and market players could remain anonymous.
	   Even though stock prices seemed far more stable in Tokyo Monday,
signs of gloominess and fear about the world's economic future also
remained high in some areas.
	   ``I'm worried,'' said Kazuomi Kobayashi, a 52-year-old Tokyo
barber who dabbles in stocks.
	   Standing in front of a large electronic board in downtown Tokyo
showing the latest Nikkei numbers, he said: ``I've lost so much.
When I buy, it goes down. When I buy again, it goes down again.''
	   Even in Singapore, where newspapers often work with the
government to keep people calm, signs of panic prevailed.
	   ``World markets sent reeling: World faces global meltdown as its
leaders fail to find solutions to Russia's worsening crisis,'' said
the front-page headline in Saturday's The Straits Times.
	   ``Fear of complete meltdown rules markets,'' said a headline in
The Business Times on Monday.

Report: Creditors fail to auction off Kia Motors
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with report that auction failed

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Creditors have failed to auction off
bankrupt Kia Motors Co., South Korea's second largest automaker,
news reports said Monday.
	   State-run Yonhap News Agency said the auction was cancelled
after all four bidders failed to meet terms set by Kia's creditor
banks.
	   Ford Motor Co. and three South Korean carmakers _ Hyundai Motor
Co., Daewoo Motor Co. and Samsung Motors, Inc. _ submitted bids for
Kia in mid-August.
	   The successful bidder was to be announced Tuesday.
	   Ford and Hyundai submitted bids below the minimum price set by
the creditors, and all four bidders demanded that creditors write
off more of Kia's debt, Yonhap reported.
	   Officials at Kia and its creditor banks refused comment, saying
an official announcement will be made Tuesday. Yonhap said the
creditors are likely to invite new bids.
	   To make the failed company more attractive to bidders, the
creditor banks agreed to write off nearly half of Kia's dlrs 6.7
billion debt. Kia has dlrs 5.9 billion in assets.
	   In July, five companies, including General Motors Co., said they
would bid for Kia and its commercial vehicle arm, Asia Motors Corp.
But GM pulled out in the last minute.
	   The successful bidder must buy at least 51 percent of the equity
of Kia and Asia Motors through the auction. Ford already owns 16.9
percent of Kia.
	   Kia's collapse in July, 1997, helped erode investors' confidence
in South Korea's bloated, inefficient industries, leading to a
flight of capital.
	   South Korea called in the International Monetary Fund in
December to organize a record dlrs 58 billion bailout of its
economy.
	   The move to sell Kia is part of the government's effort to
restructure the economy under the IMF bailout terms.
	   Kia produced 780,000 cars in 1997. Asia Motors can turn out
250,000 vehicles, mostly trucks and buses. The two companies employ
more than 18,000 workers.

U.N. report predicts 66 percent poverty rate in Indonesia in 1999
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER TORCHIA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ About 140 million people, or two out
of every three Indonesians, are likely to be living in poverty in
1999 because of economic turmoil, according to a report released by
the United Nations on Monday.
	   The forecast was one of the bleakest since the Indonesian rupiah
and other Asian currencies plunged more than a year ago, launching
a crisis that some fear could now spread to the West.
	   In another piece of bad news, the government announced Monday
that inflation for the year was 69.1 percent. Millions of people
have had to cut back on food because prices are so high.
	   Plagued this year by riots and political upheaval that ousted
former President Suharto, Indonesia has suffered more than its
Asian neighbors and efforts to revive the economy have been slow.
Unemployment is about 20 percent.
	   In a U.N.-commissioned report, the International Labor
Organization warned that more hardship will follow because economic
growth is not expected for at least two years.
	   ``The equivalent of a tenth to a quarter of the entire
Indonesian economy has vanished,'' the report said.
	   There have been scattered riots over the last week, and worries
abound that social unrest will intensify as conditions worsen.
	   Thirty-seven percent of the population, or 75 million people,
are already below the poverty line and the figure could rise to 66
percent next year, according to the report. Such levels of poverty
have not been seen in Indonesia since the 1960s.
	   The number of people living in poverty was 11 percent in 1996,
before the economic crisis erupted, according to official
statistics.
	   In the report, a poor person was defined as earning less than
dlrs 1 a day in the cities, or 80 U.S. cents in rural areas.
	   The price of rice and other staple foods is rising faster than
housing or transport despite subsidies provided under a
multi-billion dollar aid package led by the International Monetary
Fund.
	   ``This is clearly a major problem for the government in coming
months,'' said Anne Booth of the School of Oriental and African
Studies, who worked on the report.
	   The authors said a total of 5.4 million workers will lose their
jobs this year and that over 20 percent of the nation's 92 million
work force is now jobless. The most affected workers are in the
service, manufacturing and construction sectors.
	   The report urged the government to focus on agricultural
development, public works programs as well as labor relations in a
bid to get the economy moving again.
	   Trade unions have flourished since President B.J. Habibie
disavowed his predecessor's autocratic style and began instituting
democratic reforms. Workers are demanding more rights and better
pay.

More than 1.5 million marooned in north Indian flood

	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Police and aid workers hoping to reach
20 towns reportedly submerged by floodwaters found nothing but open
water and bloated bodies Monday, where tens of thousands of people
once lived.
	   ``The destruction is so overwhelming that rescue efforts seem
futile,'' said Kripa Shankar Pandey, a local reporter who lives in
Gorakhpur at the center of the disaster zone.
	   Officials in Lucknow, the state capital, put the death toll at
1,020 as of Sunday.
	   Working with about 1,500 boats _ most of them aging, cracked
rowboats _ government workers and private aid organizations tried
to reach the north Indian villages in Uttar Pradesh, India's most
populous state and one of its poorest. But there were no signs of
the villages in the unending stretch of flood water.
	   Rescue workers, overwhelmed by the havoc caused by torrential
rains, could do little more than recover bodies from the turbulent
waters .
	   Jeetendra Singh, a government administrator in Gorakhpur, said
an estimated 1.5 million villagers were surrounded by flood waters
and marooned. Authorities were trying to fly in at least 300
sturdy, motorized boats from Calcutta and Bombay on air force
planes. Currently, only 11 motorized boats are available for rescue
operations, said Singh.
	   Thousands of acres of standing crops were submerged, along with
tens of thousands of homes. Officials had not begun estimating the
amount of damage to property and livestock.

Popular comedy shows two Egypts and angers Israel
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A hit film that pokes fun at Westernized
Egyptians has managed to anger Israel and the American University
in Cairo as well as point up deep differences in this Arab
country's society.
	   ``Saidi at the American University,'' tells the story of Khalaf,
a bumpkin southern Egyptian who wins a scholarship to study at the
university whose students _ many from Cairo's upper class _ are
known for their Americanized attitudes.
	   The ``saidi,'' the Arabic word for a southern Egyptian, runs
into trouble from his first day. Wearing a tie and yellowish suit,
he draws giggles from fellow students in casual college dress.
	   ``Did you fall into a mustard jar?'' one asks Khalaf.
	   But audience reaction, as reported in the Cairo press, has
turned the tables on the students' derision _ with cheers for
Khalaf and boos for his detractors.
	   Both film and reaction speak to the contrast between upper
middle class Cairenes who go to bars and American fast-food
restaurants and the vast number of Egyptians who are conservative
Muslims.
	   Khalaf _ definitely in the second group _ doesn't drink alcohol,
speak English to fellow Egyptians, or dance with girls. In his
hometown of Sohag, Khalaf never saw men and women dance together.
	   Some who have seen the film feel that Khalaf is the real
Egyptian while the university's students represent an alien
culture.
	   ``They are from a different world. They want to imitate
everything Western,'' said Mona Mohammed, a 21-year-old student at
a technical university in Cairo.
	   Whatever the reaction, the film is so popular that tickets must
be bought days in advance. Showing at 25 movie theaters, it made
nearly dlrs 600,000 in its first week, very high by Egyptian
standards.
	   Mohammed Hineidy, who plays Khalaf, is said to have doubled his
salary per film to dlrs 58,000. Hineidy, 36, is now seen as a rival
to Adel Imam, Egypt's top comedian.
	   And many people in Cairo are singing one of the film's songs,
``Casuawilouh,'' an Arabization of the word ``casual'' that means
``make him dress casual.''
	   The song plays as Khalaf, making peace with fellow students,
visits one of Cairo's shopping malls to trade his old-fashioned
clothes for jeans and polo shirts.
	   Not everyone is happy with the film.
	   The American University in Cairo, which was founded in 1919 and
sees itself as having educated generations of Egyptian society,
sued to stop distribution of the film using its name. But it
withdrew the lawsuit this week after the filmmaker said he intended
no harm to the university.
	   The film's producer, Mohammed el-Adl, was quoted in the press as
saying the university refused to allow photos to be taken on campus
to help design sets. Some scenes were shot at Cairo's Russian
Embassy, which looks like AUC's older buildings.
	   The movie's main scene also angered Israel. It shows an
anti-Israeli demonstration on the 50th anniversary of the Jewish
state earlier this year. One student organizer is arrested but
manages to throw an Israeli flag to Khalaf, who sets it ablaze.
	   Israeli Embassy spokeswoman Ayellet Yehiav said such a film
should not be shown ``after nearly 20 years of peace and
relations,'' referring to Israel's 1979 peace treaty with Egypt,
the first with an Arab state.
	   ``I can only regret the fact that in a film that is supposed to
be a comedy, there is a scene that is not funny at all in which
they burn our flag,'' she said.
	   The director, Saeed Hamed, has said audiences often applaud and
stamp their feet at the flag-burning, reflecting Arab frustration
over Israel's stalled peace talks with Palestinians.
	   ``When they burnt the Israeli flag, we began to clap. There was
a feeling inside us. I had tears in my eyes because of what is
happening in Palestine,'' said 19-year-old law student Ibrahim
Mohammed Talib.
	   After the protest, Khalaf tells police: ``I have nothing to do
with demonstrations or politics. But after burning the Israeli
flag, I felt relieved.''
	   The film ends with Khalaf, who came first in the political
science exam, giving a graduation speech.
	   ``When I first came here, I was overwhelmed by America. But
after three years,'' he says, ``I would like to say that we don't
hate anyone ... but we hate those who call us backward people.''

Albright delivers indirect criticism of Germany over refugee
</HEADLINE>
return &QL; 
 &UR; By SRECKO LATAL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright has indirectly criticized Germany for its policy of
repatriating Bosnian refugees regardless of whether they can return
safely to their original homes.
	   In a speech here Sunday, Albright warned Bosnian Serb, Croat and
Muslim leaders to uphold to the 1995 Dayton peace accord, which
ended the 3 1/2-year Bosnian war and which provided for the safe
return of refugees.
	   She criticized leaders of all three ethnic groups for not doing
enough for the return of refugees.
	   ``It is wrong to stop refugees from coming home,'' she added.
``But I hope our European allies will recognize that it is also
irresponsible to force them to return where there is no security,
no housing, and no jobs.''
	   Aides said her remarks were directed against the German
government.
	   U.S. officials have expressed concern over the accelerated pace
this year of refugee returns from Germany to Bosnia _ about
one-third of the 75,000 repatriations occurring in July alone.
	   Some deportees were given financial incentives to go home while
others were forced back, U.S. officials have said.
	   Earlier this month, a State Department spokesman, James Foley,
said many returnees from Germany are not properly registered in
their temporary residences for elections set for Sept. 12-13.
	   This has produced problems for the election supervision effort
of the Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe, he said.
	   Thousands of refugees have returned to their homes in Bosnia
without difficulty in cases where they were part of the ethnic
majority. Where they are an ethnic minority, the process has been
far more difficult, a major source of frustration for U.S. and
other officials who are eager for full implementation of the Dayton
peace process.
	   German officials have expressed anger at the American concerns,
pointing out that their country has been far more hospitable than
any other in accepting Bosnian refugees.
	   German Interior Minister Manfred Kanthar has pointed out that
the country that has taken in 350,000 fleeing Bosnians needs no
advice on how to deal with the issue.
	   Foley said uncoordinated actions that send refugees where they
don't belong ``play into the hands of the hard-liners and move us
away from the creation of a truly single Bosnia with two truly
multi-ethnic entities.''
	   During her visit here, Albright said the upcoming election
offers ``a real choice between two very different visions of
Bosnia's future.'' She urged Bosnians to choose forces of democracy
and pluralism instead of ethnic hatred and nationalism.

Police round up activists promoting peace with Kurdish rebels
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Riot police detained some 200 activists on
Monday who planned to ride buses on a peace mission to the
southeast to promote a political solution to the Turkish-Kurdish
war there, an activist said.
	   The activists were planning to reach the main southeastern city
of Diyarbakir by buses on Tuesday to coincide with the start of a
unilateral Kurdish rebel cease-fire.
	   ``They rounded up us before we could get on the buses,'' said
Osman Baydemir, an official from the independent Human Rights
Association.
	   Baydemir, who was among the detained, spoke from the police
station by mobile phone.
	   The Turkish government, which blocked a similar initiative last
year, insisted the peace mission was a thinly disguised propaganda
ploy by Kurdish rebels.
	   Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz has already rejected the truce offer
by Kurdish rebels, announced on Friday, calling on them to
surrender and end their 14-year war for autonomy.
	   The government refuses to negotiate with the rebels, whom they
denounce as terrorists.

Document adopted for funding of nuclear reactors in North Korea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ An international consortium building
two nuclear reactors in North Korea adopted a resolution Monday on
funding of the dlrs 4.6 billion project, Seoul officials said.
	   The resolution was the first official document detailing how to
finance the project promised as a reward for North Korea's 1994
pledge to freeze and eventually dismantle its suspect nuclear
weapons program.
	   Virtually all of the estimated cost will be borne by four key
members of the consortium, called the Korean Peninsula Energy
Development Organization _ the United States, Japan, South Korea
and the European Union, South Korean officials said.
	   South Korea will assume dlrs 3.22 billion, or 70 percent, of the
cost, Japan dlrs 1 billion and the European Union dlrs 80 million,
they said.
	   The United States will organize financing of the dlrs 300
million difference between the new budget and the total amount
committed by the member countries, the officials said.
	   The United States also will be responsible for 500,000 tons of
fuel oil to be given North Korea annually until the first of the
two reactors, with a rated capacity of 1,000 megawatts, is built by
2003, they said.
	   The reactors will be built in Sinpo, a seaside village in a
northeastern tip of North Korea. Ground leveling has been
completed, with main construction work due to start in October.
	   The new light-water reactors will replace North Korea's
Soviet-developed graphite reactors which produce greater amounts of
weapons-grade plutonium, a key ingredient for atomic bombs.
	   Despite repeated denials, the North's communist government is
believed to have obtained enough plutonium to make at least one
bomb before its nuclear program was frozen under the 1994 agreement
signed with the United States.

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Shoppers looking for final discounts lined up
in sweltering heat Monday outside the Japanese department store
Matsuzakaya, which is closing after 23 years in Hong Kong.
	   Matsuzakaya, which will closed its doors on Tuesday, was one of
the several department stores to fall victims to the retail slump
caused by the prolonged economic crisis in the region. It employed
100 people in Hong Kong.
	   Last November, another Japanese retailer, Yaohan Department
Stores, closed all of its nine Hong Kong outlets and one in nearby
Macau, throwing 2,700 people out of work.
	   Daimaru, the first Japanese department store to open in the
territory after World War II, also announced it would pull out of
Hong Kong at the end of this year.
	   The government reported last week that retail sales fell 16
percent in June from the same month last year, with sales at
department stores plunging 29 percent in value and 30 percent in
volume.
	   It was the eighth consecutive monthly decline since October when
consumer confidence began to falter.
	   Many retailers have been laying off staff and cutting salaries
to ride out the retail slump. Tourist arrivals fell by more than 20
percent in the first half of 1998. The government and some property
giants have cut rent for retail stores.
	   Unemployment in Hong Kong is at a 15-year high of 4.8 percent,
and is expected to climb further. The government announced Friday
the economy shrank by 5 percent in the second quarter in an
official confirmation that the territory is in recession.

Wallabies set for World Cup qualifying
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australia's rugby team has little time
to celebrate a stunning 3-0 series sweep of New Zealand's All
Blacks, with Rod Macqueen's squad turning its attention to World
Cup qualification.
	   Despite scoring the first Bledisloe Cup sweep since 1929,
following on from record wins over England and Scotland, Australia
has been forced to qualify for its place at next year's World Cup
in Britain and France.
	   Now rated second best in the world behind South Africa,
Australia's qualifying route was sealed back in 1995 when it lost
to England in the quarterfinals of the previous World Cup.
	   Australia must face Fiji, Western Samoa and Tonga in September,
and the top three teams advance. Their placings in the round robin
series will determine which team plays in which group in the late
1999 finals.
	   If Australia finishes top it will play in the preferred Irish
pool and victory there would advance it, on seedings, to a
quarterfinal against Wales and a semifinal against South Africa.
	   Macqueen plans to make the most of a 30-man squad during the
South Pacific qualifiers, which means games are likely for regular
test reserves Chris Whitaker, Nathan Grey, Damian Smith, Jeremy
Paul and Owen Finegan.
	   But there are two certain losses _ fullback Matthew Burke and
winger Ben Tune.
	   Burke should know Thursday if he needs rehabilitation or a full
reconstruction to his right shoulder after suffering the injury as
he scored Australia's late try against New Zealand on Saturday.
	   ``With a rehabilitation program possibly with telescopic surgery
it could be 6-12 weeks and a worst case scenario could be a full
reconstruction which would give him an excellent result but
generally recovery time is six months,'' team doctor John Best
said.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ In the latest sign of Japan's economic troubles,
production at the nation's factories and mines in July slipped 0.8
percent from June, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry
said Monday.
	   The decline was greater than forecast by economists surveyed by
Dow Jones Newswires, who projected on average that industrial
production would decline 0.4 percent compared with the prior month.
The figures were adjusted for seasonal factors.
	   In the most recent previous figures last month, output rose 1.7
percent, the first gain in four months.
	   In the latest report, the ministry said production would likely
remain on a declining trend as manufacturers focus on reducing
inventories of unsold goods.
	   The ministry forecast output would fall 0.4 percent in August
from July, although it said production would rise 2.5 percent in
September.
	   In another sign of economic weakness, the ministry announced
Monday that retail sales fell 3.7 percent in July from a year
earlier to 12.02 trillion yen (dlrs 85.1 billion), the 16th
straight month of declines.
	   Falls were recorded in all categories of goods in July,
including a 6.4 percent dip in car sales and a 4.8 percent decline
in sales of electronics.

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Creditors have apparently failed to
auction off bankrupt Kia Motors Co., South Korea's second largest
automaker, news reports said Monday.
	   Ford Motor Co. and three South Korean carmakers _ Hyundai Motor
Co., Daewoo Motor Co. and Samsung Motors, Inc. _ submitted bids for
Kia in mid-August.
	   The successful bidder was to be announced Tuesday.
	   But state-run Yonhap News Agency and several independent
newspapers reported that all of the bidders failed to meet terms
set by Kia's creditor banks.
	   Ford and Hyundai submitted bids below the minimum price set by
the creditors, and all four bidders demanded that creditors write
off more of Kia's debt, Yonhap reported.
	   Officials at Kia and its creditor banks refused comment, saying
an official announcement will be made Tuesday.
	   To make the failed company more attractive to bidders, the
creditor banks agreed to write off nearly half of Kia's dlrs 6.7
billion debt. Kia has dlrs 5.9 billion in assets.
	   The successful bidder must buy at least 51 percent of the equity
of Kia and Asia Motors through the auction. Ford already owns 16.9
percent of Kia.

	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Business expectations for the
September quarter fell sharply with the Asian currency turmoil
hitting home in Australia, a survey released Monday showed.
	   The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry said its
national survey of business expectations had fallen from an index
of 48.9 to 39.9.
	   That reflected the consensus in business that Australian
economic growth would slow from the rate of 4.9 percent achieved in
the year to March.
	   A growth rate of around half that level now looks a far more
likely outcome for 1998-99, the Chamber said.
	   It said a steep fall in output in the Asian region, which is
spreading to markets around the world, will hurt business
confidence.
	   It said exports appeared hardest hit with a negative 10.8 net
balance.
	   For employment there was a negative net balance of 5.1 in the
last quarter, with expectations it would further deteriorate in the
coming quarter.
	   But sales and investment were more positive, indicating the
economy was showing resilience in the face of the external
problems.
	   The sales expectation figure showed a positive net balance of
14.1, while investment expectations held a positive net balance of
5.8.

Australian team hit by walkouts, injuries and court action
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY HARPER &QC;

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Sprinter Nova Peris-Kneebone will take
Athletics Australia to court Tuesday in the latest disruption to
the country's track and field team for the Sept. 11 Commonwealth
Games.
	   Australia is unlikely to win a medal on the track at Kuala
Lumpur with its main chances either out of action or close to being
ruled out.
	   World 400-meter champion Cathy Freeman succumbed to a foot
injury last week while Barcelona Olympics high jump bronze medalist
Tim Forsyth and former world indoors medalist Melinda
Gainsford-Taylor are rated no better than 50-50 to beat injuries.
	   Peris-Kneebone, who won a gold medal with Australia's women's
hockey team at the Atlanta Olympics before switching to the
sprints, will take AA to the Court of Arbitration for Sport over
the governing body's selection procedures.
	   Peris-Kneebone, already selected for the 200-meters to replace
Freeman, ran a qualifying time for the 100-meter event but missed
out to another athlete, Tania Van Heer. Van Heer failed to qualify
but was selected for beating Peris-Kneebone at the trials.
	   Peris-Kneebone's legal challenge, irrelevant if Gainsford-Taylor
is ruled out, upset Van Heer so much she had to be talked out of
quitting the team.
	   The track team was further hit Monday when Nicky Carroll, winner
of the Paris marathon in April and a KL medal favorite, pulled out,
citing fears of the heat and humidity in Malaysia.
	   Coach Chris Wardlaw denied that Carroll's withdrawal, injuries
to three other stars and a court dispute between two others had
left the team in turmoil.
	   ``I personally wouldn't use the word 'turmoil' at all, these
sorts of things are very difficult for the people concerned _ and
it's disappointing that they have happened to our stars - but it
doesn't wash over to the team in general,'' Wardlaw said. ``(Track
and field) is a very individual sport with everyone concentrating
on their own events.''
	   Gainsford-Taylor has been forced to reschedule her buildup to
the games because of a knee injury and she will be unable to race
in a test run Thursday.
	   Forsyth arrived at the team's Darwin base Monday on crutches
after spraining his ankle in training 10 days ago.
	   Australia's concerns come less than year after AA suffered a
major embarrassment by choosing a drug-tainted East German as its
new head coach. Ekkard Arbeit was eventually dropped in the face of
public pressure but the job is still yet to be filled.

Malaysian government to hold emergency Cabinet meeting
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with finance minister denying resignation rumors

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The Cabinet will meet in special
session Tuesday, after a rocky week in which the Southeast Asian
nation officially fell into recession and its two top bankers
resigned.
	   Government officials celebrating National Day on Monday with
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad on the northwestern resort island
of Penang confirmed the Cabinet meeting.
	   Although they wouldn't indicate what would be on the agenda, it
is likely that Cabinet ministers will discuss the resignations of
the country's top two central bankers.
	   Meanwhile, Finance Minister Anwar Ibrahim on Monday denied
rumors that he had resigned, the national news agency reported.
	   ``I have also heard such talk many times but it is not true,''
he told reporters.
	   Anwar said that he would continue to discharge his duties as
deputy prime minister and deputy president of the governing United
Malays National Organization party as well, Bernama news agency
reported.
	   There has been speculation about about Anwar's departure since
the resignation of governor of the central bank and his deputy.
	   Bank Negara governor Ahmad Mohamed Don and his deputy, Fong Weng
Phak, quit last week. Mahathir has admitted that there was a rift
over monetary policy between Bank Negara and the government.
	   Anwar had earlier backed the central bank's tight monetary
policy.
	   Mahathir and special economics minister Daim Zainuddin have been
pushing for lower interest rates as part of an initiative to jump
start the country's sagging economy, which contracted 6.8 percent
in the second quarter this year.
	   Ahmad and Fong were uncomfortable with that strategy and
preferred to quit Bank Negara, sources close to the central bank
have said.
	   The sudden meeting comes amid mounting speculation that Malaysia
may opt to impose capital controls to restrict the amount of money
leaving the country. Economists say that may be the only way to
protect the faltering ringgit if interest rates are cut further.
The currency has already lost 40 percent of its value over the past
14 months.

Turkish Cypriot leader offers confederation to Greek Cypriots
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ The leader of the breakaway Turkish
Cypriot state on Monday proposed setting up a confederation of
equal states as a way to end the 24-year-old division of this
Mediterranean island.
	   ``We propose the establishment of a Cyprus confederation
composed of two peoples and two states,'' Rauf Denktash told a news
conference held with Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem. ``The
framework of our proposal is open to negotiation.''
	   The offer is a modified version of the Turkish proposal for a
two-zone, bi-communal federation.
	   ``It is time that they recognize that we are the legal
government of the Turkish Cypriots,'' Denktash told private NTV
television.
	   Under the offer, the Turkish Cypriot still insists on
international recognition but abandons its long opposition to
joining the European Union before Turkey can.
	   Turkey and Turkish Cypriots have been arguing that EU membership
for Greek Cypriots would amount to unification with Greece, already
an EU member.
	   The Denktash proposal also foresees the establishment of
``symmetrical ties'' between Greek Cypriots and Greece and between
Turkish Cypriots and Turkey.
	   Cyprus has been divided in Greek and Turkish sectors since 1974
when Turkey invaded the Mediterranean island following a
short-lived coup backed by supporters of union with Greece.

Israeli defense minister arrives in China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ Israel's defense minister toured a
Chinese missile cruiser Monday, the first day of a visit to discuss
the Middle East, combatting terrorism and other issues.
	   Yitzhak Mordechai traveled to China, an important market for
Israeli weapons, with a delegation of weapons company executives
and other business people. But Israeli officials gave no indication
that any new military deals were expected during the four-day
visit.
	   ``We came to speak generally, not to make deals,'' said Avi
Benayahu, Mordechai's spokesman. He said topics would include
terrorism and the Middle East.
	   Mordechai was invited to China by Defense Minister Chi Haotian,
whom he will meet Wednesday.
	   Mordechai's trip comes three months after a visit by Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The defense minister told
Israeli army radio before his departure that China asked ``a number
of times that I come for discussions.''
	   Mordechai said he would meet senior Chinese security officials,
as well as representatives from Chinese military industries and
``other areas which are important to Israel.''
	   ``Our relations with China are very important,'' Mordechai said.
``China is developing as a great power.''
	   Israel's embattled state-owned arms industry and private arms
firms that also have been facing intense competition view China as
a major market. China's 2.9-million member military is trying to
become a better equipped, more modern fighting force.
	   At a refuelling stop Monday in Beijing on his way to the
financial center of Shanghai, Mordechai handed over 700 kilograms
(1,540 pounds) of antibiotics to the Chinese army to treat victims
of this summer's devastating floods in China, said Benayahu.
	   Mordechai spent more than an hour Monday visiting a Shanghai
naval base, and saw a missile cruiser's weapons systems and control
center and spoke to naval officers, he said.
	   Mordechai also was to tour Shanghai's newly renovated Ohel
Rachel Synagogue.
	   In World War II, Japanese soldiers used the synagogue as a
stable; until recently, it was used as a storage building. It is
one of the last links to an era when Shanghai was home to tens of
thousands of Jews who played a prominent role in its business and
cultural life.
	   Mordechai was to leave Shanghai on Tuesday for Xi'an, where he
will visit the famed terracota warriors, and then travel onto
Beijing, the capital, for his official meetings. He leaves China on
Friday morning.

	   MATADI, Congo (AP) _ Angolan troops fighting on behalf of
President Laurent Kabila are prepared to attack rebel-held
territory in eastern Congo after capturing key rebel positions in
the west, a senior commander said.
	   ``The only way for life to become normal is to end this
conflict,'' said Angolan army chief of staff Joao de Matos. ``We
are ready to move east to do that.''
	   Kabila's cabinet director, Abdoulaye Yerodia on Monday said a
counter-offensive in the east was in the works _ a push that would
move this central African country's civil war away from the capital
and into rebel-dominated terrain.
	   A rebel coalition backed by Rwanda and Uganda had been poised
just weeks ago to topple Kabila's government and capture the
capital, Kinshasa.
	   Kabila regrouped and enlisted the help of Angola, Zimbabwe and
Namibia _ a move that turned the tables on the rebels, but has also
internationalized Congo's war and threatens the stability of an
already troubled region.
	   Yerodia said Congo's Angolan allies had offered to come here to
fight the rebels where necessary, even if it takes them to Congo's
eastern border with Rwanda.
	   ``Our Angolan and Zimbabwean allies are here to kick out the
Rwanda-Ugandan aggressors,'' Yerodia said. ``They are not selective
about where they have to do that.''

More Indonesian troops withdraw from northern province
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ More than 600 soldiers left a northern
province on Monday in a conciliatory gesture by the military, which
is accused of human rights violations in the region.
	   The departure wrapped up a partial troop withdrawal from Aceh,
where government investigators have unearthed bones of victims
allegedly killed by the military and dumped into mass graves.
	   In another sign that the military is easing up, 12 villagers in
Aceh who had been in military detention were released this past
weekend in the town of Pidie.
	   Human rights lawyer Abdurrahman Yacob said they had been
illegally arrested this year because of suspected anti-government
activities.
	   Earlier this month, armed forces chief Gen. Wiranto apologized
for wrongdoing during a military campaign against Islamic
separatist rebels in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
	   Wiranto also pulled out 250 soldiers on Aug. 20, mindful of the
bitterness many Acehnese feel for the military. In the wake of the
May downfall of former President Suharto, succesor B.J. Habibie has
pledged democratic reforms and greater accountability.
	   On Monday, 664 troops left Aceh, including 34 members of
Indonesia's special forces, known as Kopassus.
	   Lt. Col. Agus Ramadhan said by telephone that the regular
soldiers will be deployed to bases in neighboring North Sumatra
province while the elite troops will return to Jakarta, the
Indonesian capital.
	   Agus said 2,000 troops remain in Aceh, which is 2,000 kilometers
(1,250 miles) northwest of Jakarta.

Russian soldiers in revolutionary mood, warns Lebed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Russian nationalist leader Alexander Lebed, in an
interview published Monday, said Russian soldiers are ``in
revolutionary mood,'' but gave his backing to acting Prime Minister
Viktor Chernomyrdin.
	   ``What mood do you think the army is in when officers haven't
been paid for five months?'' Lebed said in an interview with French
daily Le Figaro.
	   ``Wives are storming the division headquarters and the commander
says: as long as you've got earrings you've got nothing to complain
about.
	   ``The army is in revolutionary mood,'' Lebed was quoted as
saying.
	   Lebed, a retired general and governor of the Krasnoyarsk region
in Siberia, said Russia was ``on the verge of social explosion,''
and that ``power could collapse within 24 hours.''
	   ``The country is falling, and only a heavyweight can slow its
fall. For various reasons, all the heavyweights are out of the
game. Only Chernomyrdin remains,'' he said.
	   ``He has a small chance to slow the collapse ... and it's in
everybody's interest to support him. If not, we're going to
drown.''
	   Lebed, a likely future presidential candidate, has often issued
dire warnings claiming that Russia was on the verge of collapse.
	   While the current crisis is inflicting additional economic pain
on Russia's hard-pressed citizens, there have been no outbreaks of
social unrest.
	   He compared the current situation to the hard-line, August 1991
coup attempt against Mikhail Gorbachev.
	   ``After the 1991 putsch, power collapsed in a matter of hours.
Today, the situation is identical, but this time it could collapse
in 24 hours,'' Lebed said.
	   Lebed said Yeltsin's future ``depends on his ability to avoid
abrupt gestures, like the dissolution of the Duma.''
	   And he urged other regional governors to come up with
money-spinning projects to help the national economy.
	   But he said Yeltsin would come under intense pressure to resign.
	   ``You will have heard of the letter sent by the Siberian miners,
demanding that the president resign,'' Lebed said. ``There will be
other letters _ from metal workers, from doctors, from teachers.''

Share prices tumble
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Share prices tumbled Monday as the government
took a breather from its battle with speculators.
	   The Hang Seng Index, the market's key indicator of blue chips,
fell 554.7 points, or 7 percent, closing at 7,275.04. On Friday,
the index had lost 93.23 points.
	   Turnover fell to 6.57 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 842
million), down from Friday's record 79.0 billion Hong Kong dollars
(U.S. dlrs 10.1 billion).
	   In the past two weeks, the government had intervened massively
to prop up shares in a bid to punish speculators who had bet that
the market would fall.
	   Brokers said Monday's fall was expected as the government has
spent an estimated 15 percent of its U.S. dlrs 97 billion foreign
reserves in the stock and stock futures markets.
	   Joseph Yam, chief executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority,
the territory's de facto central bank, said Sunday that the
government would not hesitate to intervene in the markets again if
necessary.
	   By buying shares, the government was targeting those who were
sort selling the stock and futures markets and the Hong Kong
currency.
	   Speculators will now find it more expensive to bet against the
Hong Kong markets after the futures exchange said it will require
markets players to come up more cash when buying or selling more
than 10,000 futures contracts.
	   Among losers, HSBC Holding fell 9.00 Hong Kong dollars to
164.50, Hutchison Whampoa fell 4.20 dollars to 33.60, Cheung Kong
fell 3.20 Hong Kong dollars to 30.00, and Hang Seng Bank fell 2.60
dollars to 41.70.

Swiss say no surveillance of Scientology needed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Switzerland said Monday that, unlike
neighboring Germany, it sees no need to place the Church of
Scientology under nationwide surveillance by counter-intelligence
agents.
	   Scientology shows totalitarian traits and has its own spying
network, but there is no basis for police surveillance, a
government commission said in its report. However, it said the
situation would be reviewed at an unspecified future date.
	   In June 1997, Germany placed Scientology under national
scrutiny, citing its alleged anti-democratic aims and its intention
to infiltrate government.
	   In contrast, extreme and totalitarian views can only be
monitored in Switzerland if they involve crimes against the state
or violence.
	   Switzerland's Consultative State Protection Commission concluded
that church members are often under huge pressure to buy new
services and books, but that Scientology spying activities don't
endanger state security.
	   Last year, the commission announced similar conclusions in its
preliminary findings.
	   It estimated the number of active Scientologists in Switzerland
at less than 4,000, but said an exact figure couldn't be given with
the information available. Previous estimates have put the number
between 5,000 and 10,000.
	   Last April, a German security agent was arrested in Basel,
Switzerland, for attempting to spy on the church.
	   The agent was arrested after meeting with two Swiss women, one
of whom was also charged.
	   Germany apologized to Switzerland for the incident. The agent,
employed by the Baden-Wuerttemberg branch of Germany's domestic
security agency, was bailed three days later after the state's
interior ministry guaranteed he would return to stand trial.
	   The U.S. government, which has extended Scientology tax-free
status as a religion since 1993, has criticized Germany's treatment
of the Scientologists.
	   The Church of Scientology, which claims 8 million members
worldwide, was founded in 1954 by the late science fiction writer
L. Ron Hubbard. Supporters say it is a legitimate religion, while
critics charge it is a cult.
	   It has mounted an advertising campaign denouncing German
treatment of its 30,000 adherents, such as banning them from public
jobs.

Markets stable, volume low due to British holiday, Russian
</HEADLINE>
uncertainty &QL; 
 &UR; By TOM COHEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ A bank holiday in England and uncertainty
over Russia's political deal meant low-volume trading Monday
morning in most central European financial markets.
	   Foreign investors who caused currency and share prices to fall
last week by pulling out their money due to the Russian economic
crisis took the day off in London and were waiting to see what
happens in Russia, dealers said.
	   In Hungary, where the government intervened twice last week to
bolster the sagging forint, a weekend announcement reducing the
currency's monthly devaluation rate gave it a boost early Monday.
	   The forint, which fell sharply last week, strengthened to 1.4
percent on the negative side of its trading band with five Western
currencies. It closed Friday at 1.8 percent below the middle level.
	   Dealers said the government's decision to reduce the monthly
devaluation rate calmed fears that it might announce a one-time
devaluation, similar to the way Russia devalued the ruble two weeks
ago.
	   But they warned the rough ride would likely continue.
	   ``Until the situation settles down in Russia and the Far Eastern
markets, the forint is on track to weaken,'' said Istvan Hideg,
currency dealer at Mezobank Rt. in Budapest.
	   Share prices on the Hungarian stock exchange also rose Monday,
with investors buying low after last week's sell-off. The BUX index
of 20 major shares increased 4.9 percent by late morning.
	   Poland's zloty currency opened stronger against its basket of
five Western currencies on a low-volume morning.
	   Andrzej Fiderkiewicz, a dealer at SG Bank in Poland, blamed the
London bank holiday for ``less volume, less trades.''
	   ``We could see a weakening of the zloty'' (on Tuesday),
Fiderkiewicz said, depending on what happens in Russia when the
parliament votes later Monday on President Boris Yeltsin's nominee
for prime minister, Viktor Chernomyrdin.
	   The Communist opposition says it will block Chernomyrdin's
approval, delaying the formation of a new government to deal with
the collapse of the ruble currency and potential economic meltdown
in Russia.
	   All regional currencies and shares took a beating last week due
to the Russian crisis, mostly because investors abandoned their
stakes. Analysts described the reaction as panic over emerging
markets, rather than an indication of problems underpinning
regional economies.
	   In Prague, the Czech koruna strengthened slightly against the
dollar while weakening against the German mark on Monday. Volume
was so low that the changes were considered insignificant.
	   Romania's leu currency also opened slightly stronger against the
dollar, with dealers predicting further volatility as the week
progresses.

Albright delivers indirect criticism of Germany over refugee return
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Albright activities Monday; TRIMS. no pickup &QL; 
 &UR; By SRECKO LATAL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ After delivering veiled
criticism of Germany for repatriating Bosnian refugees, U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright urged Bosnia's leaders Monday
to allow people to return to the homes they fled in the bloody war.
	   ``Now it is time for Bosnia's people to get back what they had
before the war: their homes, their security, their freedom to
travel and work where they choose,'' Albright told reporters after
meeting Muslim and Croat members of Bosnia's joint presidency.
	   ``And it's time for Bosnia to have something it didn't have
before the war; a chance to be a free country that is fully a part
of Europe,'' she added.
	   Albright traveled to the Serb-ruled part of Bosnia and then on
to the territory governed by the Muslim-Croat Federation to give a
boost to candidates in this month's election who support the 1995
Dayton Peace Accords which ended the 3 1/2-year war.
	   In a speech here Sunday, Albright criticized leaders of all
three ethnic groups for not doing enough for the return of
refugees, which Washington considers the key to rebuilding a
multi-ethnic state.
	   She also delivered some veiled criticism of Germany for its
efforts to repatriate Bosnian refugees who fled there during the
1992-1995 conflict.
	   ``It is wrong to stop refugees from coming home,'' she added.
``But I hope our European allies will recognize that it is also
irresponsible to force them to return where there is no security,
no housing, and no jobs.''
	   Aides said her remarks were directed against the German
government.
	   On Monday, Albright met with the Croat member of the presidency,
Kresimir Zubak, who split from the ruling Bosnian Croat hard-line
party and formed a new moderate party. She then conferred with the
Muslim member of the presidency, Alija Izetbegovic.
	   Albright said she urged Izetbegovic and Zubak to build joint
institutions, a market economy and free and fair elections Sept.
12-13.
	   Protocol would have normally required that she meet first with
Izetbegovic as the chairman of the presidency. Meeting first with
Zubak was seen as an attempt to show U.S. support for him against
Croat hardliners.
	   After his meeting, Izetbegovic said he asked for U.S. help in
establishing a unified border police to prevent ``unwanted people''
and terrorists from entering the country.
	   U.S. officials have expressed concern over the accelerated pace
this year of refugee returns from Germany to Bosnia _ about
one-third of the 75,000 repatriations occurring in July alone.
	   Some deportees were given financial incentives to go home while
others were forced back, U.S. officials have said.
	   Earlier this month, a State Department spokesman, James Foley,
said many returnees from Germany are not properly registered in
their temporary residences for elections.
	   This has produced problems for the election supervision effort
of the Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe, he said.
	   Foley said uncoordinated actions that send refugees where they
don't belong ``play into the hands of the hard-liners and move us
away from the creation of a truly single Bosnia with two truly
multi-ethnic entities.''
	   German Interior Minister Manfred Kanthar has pointed out that
the country that has taken in 350,000 fleeing Bosnians needs no
advice on how to deal with the issue.

North Korea fires missile into seas between Russia and Japan

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ North Korea test-fired a newly developed,
long-range ballistic missile into open seas between Russia and
northwestern Japan on Monday, seriously upping the security stakes
in an already volatile corner of Asia.
	   The launch just after noon (0300 GMT) was confirmed by Japanese,
South Korean and United States defense officials.
	   Japan's Defense Agency, quoting unidentified U.S. military
officials based here, said the missile was probably aimed at waters
between Russia and Japan and landed about 300 kilometers (190
miles) southeast of Vladivostok, Russia.
	   The missile was ``confirmed to be a brand-new `Daepodong I' with
a range of 2,000 kilometers (1,240 miles),'' the South Korean
Defense Ministry said in a statement.
	   That range is twice as long as the North's previous staple
``Rodong'' series missiles.
	   Japanese Coast Guard patrol boats airplanes were immediately
dispatched to the area where the missile hit. But it was unclear
whether they could actually go to the site _ which was believed to
be close to or possibly inside Russian waters.
	   ``We see this as a very dangerous act,'' said chief government
spokesman Hiromu Nonaka. He said Japan would express its concern to
the North through diplomatic channels.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, visiting Sarajevo,
told reporters she was also alarmed by the test launch.
	   ``This is something that we will be raising with North Koreans
in the talks that are currently going on,'' she said.
	   Those talks, in New York, are over a proposal for the North to
suspend missile development in exchange for nuclear energy
know-how, and some Korea watchers said they suspect the launch was
timed to up the stakes.
	   ``Kim is good at brinksmanship,'' said Hajime Izumi, a noted
North Korea watcher and professor at Shizuoka University. ``This
shows that North Korea can make effective missiles. What remains to
be seen is if they can mass produce them, or deploy them.''
	   Masahiro Akiyama, deputy director of Japan's Defense Agency,
said the launch was not totally a surprise _ security experts, he
said, had been increasing their surveillance of the North since
earlier this month.
	   Stalinist North Korea, which over the past few years has been
foundering under devastating famines, is to convene its newly
elected parliament on Sept. 5, and are expected to elect leader Kim
Jong Il as the country's president.
	   In June, North Korea also admitted for the first time that it
has sold missiles abroad. It had long been suspected of selling
missiles to Iran and Syria.
	   But very little is known about North Korea's missile program,
and its possession of a significantly better missile would be a
matter of serious concern throughout the region.
	   North Korea's best-known ballistic missile is the Rodong, which
has a range of about 1,000 kilometers (620 miles). It was last test
fired in 1993, and also landed in the same area of the Sea of
Japan, which divides the Korean Peninsula from Japan.
	   With its 1,000 kilometer (620-mile range), the Rodong I missile,
a modified Scud, could strike South Korea and much of Japan. The
newer missile would put even more of Japan within range.
	   In 1996, the United States began talks with North Korea aimed at
persuading the secretive Communist country to freeze its missile
program and to join an international agreement designed to restrict
missile proliferation. The talks stalled.
	   Japan is currently boosting its budget for joint development of
a missile defense system with the United States, and has reportedly
earmarked 500 million yen (dlrs 3.6 million) for the project next
year.
	   The United States has 37,000 troops stationed in South Korea,
many of them based near its border with North Korea. It has roughly
another 50,000 troops in Japan.
	   Monday's was the secretive North's fourth test-firing of a
missile since 1984 and its first in five years.

comply with ship safety standards, the head of the International
Maritime Organization said Monday.
	   Many flag states _ countries that use their sovereign right to
certify ships _ have substandard safety regulations because they
lack experience or simply don't care, said William O'Neil,
secretary general of the IMO.
	   But the world's shipping regulatory body's ability to protect
seas from rogue flag nations is limited, he said in a speech to the
Singapore Shipping Association.
	   ``I don't see us being given the role of being a policeman
anymore than we are,'' said O'Neil, a Canadian, in his speech on
the relevance of the IMO in the next century.
	   ``All of us can point our fingers to several flag states that
shouldn't be in the business, but life's not that simple,'' O'Neil
said
	   The world organization can impose sanctions under only one
maritime code section. So other pressures _ such as cancellation of
insurance, refusal of business, detention of unsafe vessels by port
authorities _ must be brought to bear, he said.
	   He said the port state control system, which allows countries to
detain or ban unsafe or polluting vessels ``is here to stay'' and
is helpful.
	   ``When a ship is detained it's costing someone money,'' he said.
	   Now there is an incentive for cargo owners to choose the
cheapest carriers, which often come from flag states that do not
recognize their responsibilities to regulate their fleets, he said.
	   But if enough defective ships are detained, it may become more
cost effective for cargo owners to choose safer, rather than
cheaper carriers, he said.
	   In the 50 years since the IMO was founded, many new countries
have been formed that have the sovereign right to certify ships,
but they have no maritime traditions.
	   ``No government sets out to create a substandard fleet,'' he
said. But some countries lack the experience, resources and capital
to enforce standards. Others simply see the fleets as revenue
sources and don't recognize they have any responsibility.
	   O'Neil said this is one reason why the IMO has recently switched
its emphasis from government action to company management.
	   ``The ISM code is changing to ensure that company management is
held accountable for the safety of their ships,'' he said.
	   One of the most notable factors contributing to mistakes is the
unusually long periods of time that ship masters and officers
remain on duty, despite standards calling for them to get adequate
rest, he said.
	   ``It has become normal for ship masters to approach the most
critical part of the voyage, the approach to port, without being at
their peak of performance,'' O'Neil said.

Biggest Singapore refinery to reduce processing to 49 percent
</HEADLINE>
capacity

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Shell Eastern Petroleum said Monday it will cut
crude oil processing at the country's biggest refinery to 49
percent of capacity, reflecting the dwindling regional market for
petroleum products.
	   The Bukom refinery, run by a unit of Royal Dutch/Shell Group,
will process about 29,000 metric tons a day in September, or 49.2
percent of design capacity.
	   In August, Bukom had an operating rate of 42,000 to 43,000 tons
a day, or 71.2 to 72.9 per cent of capacity.
	   The refinery, designed to process 59,000 tons or 433,000 barrels
a day, has been operating at below capacity for most of the last
year because of low prices and a weak export market.
	   But the September operating level, announced by a Shell
spokesman because of ``continuing adverse market conditions,'' will
be the lowest monthly output for the year.
	   Among Singapore's other three refiners, Singapore Refining Co.
and Mobil Corp. have cut crude runs by 15-16 percent. Figures for
Exxon Corp. were not immediately available.

Swiss say no surveillance of Scientology needed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Switzerland said Monday that, unlike
neighboring Germany, it sees no need to place the Church of
Scientology under nationwide surveillance by counter-intelligence
agents.
	   Scientology shows totalitarian traits and has its own spying
network, but there is no basis for police surveillance, a
government commission said in its report. However, it said the
situation would be reviewed at an unspecified future date.
	   In June 1997, Germany placed Scientology under national
scrutiny, citing its alleged anti-democratic aims and its intention
to infiltrate government.
	   In contrast, extreme and totalitarian views can only be
monitored in Switzerland if they involve crimes against the state
or violence.
	   Switzerland's Consultative State Protection Commission concluded
that church members are often under huge pressure to buy new
services and books, but that Scientology spying activities don't
endanger state security.
	   Last year, the commission announced similar conclusions in its
preliminary findings.
	   It estimated the number of active Scientologists in Switzerland
at less than 4,000, but said an exact figure couldn't be given with
the information available. Previous estimates have put the number
between 5,000 and 10,000.
	   Last April, a German security agent was arrested in Basel,
Switzerland, for attempting to spy on the church.
	   The agent was arrested after meeting with two Swiss women, one
of whom was also charged.
	   Germany apologized to Switzerland for the incident. The agent,
employed by the Baden-Wuerttemberg branch of Germany's domestic
security agency, was bailed out three days later after the state's
interior ministry guaranteed he would return to stand trial.
	   The U.S. government, which has extended Scientology tax-free
status as a religion since 1993, has criticized Germany's treatment
of the Scientologists.
	   The Church of Scientology, which claims 8 million members
worldwide, was founded in 1954 by the late science fiction writer
L. Ron Hubbard. Supporters say it is a legitimate religion, while
critics charge it is a cult.
	   It has mounted an advertising campaign denouncing German
treatment of its 30,000 adherents, such as banning them from public
jobs.

Hart gets support from chairman
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ All Blacks coach John Hart has
the support of New Zealand rugby chairman Rob Fisher despite an
unprecedented run of five straight losses.
	   Hart said he would stand down if the NZRFU wanted him to, but
Fisher said Monday that Hart would be expected to continue with a
three-year contract taking him up to next year's World Cup.
	   Hart's team lost the Bledisloe Cup series 3-0 to Australia for
the first time since 1929 and also fell twice against South Africa.
The five losses came after it started the domestic season with two
wins over England.
	   ``I don't think his position is under threat,'' Fisher told New
Zealand radio. ``It certainly isn't as far as I am concerned. He
does have a three-year contract.''
	   Fisher said the five losses were unacceptable, but the fact New
Zealand squandered winning chances in four of them had helped Hart.
	   ``Had we lost five tests and lost them all badly I think that
may be a different issue,'' Fisher said. ``Five losses are very
hard to take, but what was so aggravating was that it was
conceivable we could have won four of those five tests. While there
is a lot of emphasis on the World Cup no one should ever say it's
OK to lose tests on the way through because we just want to win the
World Cup.''
	   Fisher said he had spoken to all but one board member since
Saturday and no one had expressed a desire to have Hart removed.
	   ``If anyone had felt differently they would have raised it with
me,'' Fisher said. ``My impression was one firmly of support.''

Tents, lean-tos are home for many as floods surge again in China
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with refugees on dikes, quote, other details in grafs
5-8
 &UR; By CHARLES HUTZLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JIANLI, China (AP) _ For the 2,000 people living in tents on a
soggy field on the outskirts of this central city, Monday's new
crest on the nearby Yangtze River meant the beginning of the end of
China's summer floods was still nowhere in sight.
	   The floods that have devastated the Yangtze basin, China's
northeast and Tibet are not expected to recede for weeks. The
government estimates more than 3,000 people have died and 5 million
houses have been destroyed in the worst floods in decades.
	   ``About 85 percent of our house has been destroyed and all our
crops have been damaged,'' said Li Peixiang, 34, a woman housed in
one of about 40 government-issue blue tents that make up the camp.
Li was crowded into a tent about 12 by 5 feet (about 4 by 1.5
meters) with her two children and four other members of her
extended family.
	   Everyone in the camp was evacuated from Xinzhou village on Aug.
5 when government flood control officials ordered a secondary
embankment opened to divert floodwaters and relieve pressure on the
main Yangtze River dikes and protect the city of Wuhan.
	   In all, the blowing up of dikes in four sections of Jianli
county, of which Xinzhou is part, made 96,000 people homeless and
submerged 331 square kilometers of land (132 square miles).
	   Some refugees were housed in other villages and in schools. But
many were living atop a 150-kilometer- (93-mile-) long stretch of
dikes. Some were huddled in ramshackle lean-tos.
	   Some villagers were bitter that their homes were flooded to save
a city, but most were just resigned.
	   ``There was no other way,'' said Ouyang Junzhuang, a refugee.
``We're living day by day.''
	   Medical teams working in open-air clinics under umbrellas
dispensed medicines and bandaged wounds. They reported treating eye
infections, diarrhea and colds, but nothing more serious.
	   Farmers living in the refugee camp have some cooking pots,
bedrolls and not much else.
	   Dong Huisong, a farmer at the camp with his extended family of
seven, said most of the places in the village were under seven or
eight meters (about 20 feet) of water.
	   ``Our biggest worry is what will we do when we have to rebuild
our homes,'' he said. ``We'll have to rely on the government for
food, but they may not have enough money to help us with housing.''
	   Most of the evacuees said they had received adequate food and
water and some clothing, but did not expect to go home for a month.
	   Flood relief officials predicted the Yangtze would not reach
record heights in the eighth and latest flood crest raging
downstream this week. Water would be diverted into reservoirs on
tributaries to reduce the flow, state media reported.
	   In Hunan province, also in central China, more than 1 million
people have been evacuated, and about half of them are living in
tents, the China Daily reported Monday.
	   Tents and lean-tos also house evacuees in China's northeast,
where rare heavy flooding has left them unprepared for the far
north's early frost and sub-zero winter temperatures.
	   In Tuolihe Village, near the city of Qiqihar in Heilongjiang
province in the far northeast, the teacher at the village primary
school will greet children for the first day of classes in a large
tent with a sign saying ``xuexiao'' (school) over the door. A photo
in Monday's China Daily showed grinning children outside the tent
holding new books and supplies.
	   Soldiers and civilians stayed alert on important dikes in flood
zones to spot and repair leaks. The dikes are especially vulnerable
now as waters recede because they have been waterlogged for more
than two months.

Riots breaks out in Indonesian town after troops pull out
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with street violence after troop withdrawal, ADDS
byline.
 &UR; By IRWAN FIRDAUS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Thousands of people who turned out to
watch a troop withdrawal in a northern town rioted Monday, hurling
stones at shops and burning a hotel, an office of the ruling party
and other buildings.
	   Many of the stores attacked in Aceh province are owned by
members of the ethnic Chinese minority, which has become a
scapegoat for Indonesia's economic ills, partly because it
dominates business.
	   Chinese were targeted during deadly riots in May in Jakarta and
other cities that helped oust former President Suharto.
	   The rioting in the town of Lhoksemauwe erupted after a
contingent of 600 soldiers left Aceh in a conciliatory gesture by
the military, which is accused of human rights violations there.
Many people deeply resent the armed forces.
	   Crowds gathered to see the soldiers line up for a farewell
ceremony in a field, then swarmed into the streets after the troops
boarded trucks and left. Police kept their distance as they threw
stones at stores.
	   ``Many windows were broken, while heaps of debris and stones
were scattered along the streets,'' Sugito, a witness, said by
telephone.
	   ``Smoke billowed into the sky after people burned a hotel,'' he
said.
	   Mobs blocked fire trucks that tried to reach the hotel, a fire
brigade official said by telephone. Some shops were also burned, he
said.
	   Another witness said students in school uniforms torched the
office of the ruling Golkar party, which has lost credibility
because of its role in buttressing Suharto's autocratic rule.
	   The troop departure wrapped up a partial military withdrawal
from Aceh, where government investigators have unearthed bones of
victims allegedly killed by the military and dumped into mass
graves.
	   In another sign that the military is easing up, 12 villagers in
Aceh who had been in military detention were released this past
weekend in the town of Pidie.
	   Human rights lawyer Abdurrahman Yacob said they had been
illegally arrested this year because of suspected anti-government
activities.
	   Earlier this month, armed forces chief Gen. Wiranto apologized
for wrongdoing during a military campaign against Islamic
separatist rebels in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
	   Wiranto also pulled out 250 soldiers on Aug. 20. In the wake of
the May downfall of Suharto, succesor B.J. Habibie has pledged
democratic reforms and greater accountability.
	   On Monday, 664 troops left Aceh, including 34 members of
Indonesia's special forces, known as Kopassus.
	   Lt. Col. Agus Ramadhan said 2,000 troops remain in Aceh, which
is 2,000 kilometers (1,250 miles) northwest of Jakarta.

Albright resists partition
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BARRY SCHWEID &QC; 
 &UR; AP Diplomatic Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright on Monday strongly rebuffed lingering Serb and
Croat sentiment to partition Bosnia. ``There will be no revision of
the Dayton Accords,'' she said.
	   Also, Albright said after talks with Muslim and Croat leaders, a
just peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina requires that the capital be an
open city, hospitable to all ethnic groups.
	   Overall, Albright and her advisors are pleased with what they
have seen in a two-day trip to Croatia and Bosnia. Refugees are
returning in the aftermath of a bloody conflict that ended nearly
three years ago, and with U.S. and other assistance, there is
rebuilding of homes and of industries.
	   The German manufacturer, Volkswagen, formally resumes auto
production Monday in Sarajevo, the only major prewar industry, and
German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel is visiting to make the
occasion.
	   Albright, at a news conference, said the city ``looks more
normal'' since her visit in May 1997. ``It has achieved peace,''
she said. ``Now it is important that the people get what they had
before the war, security and the right to travel.''
	   Appearing with her were Alija Izetbegovic and Kresimir Zubak,
the Muslim and Croat presidents in a three-way power-sharing
arrangement. The Serb, Momcilo Krajisnik, was pointedly shunned.
	   ``Those who support Dayton are the ones to carry this country
into the new century,'' Albright said.
	   In the national elections that will be held in two weeks, the
United States is supporting Serbs in Bosnia who they consider more
amiable than Krajisnik.
	   Izetbegovic said he told Albright some changes in administration
and the judicial system were needed, as well as a better
arrangement for border police to guard against terrorist
infiltrators. Zubak called separately for equal access to the media
for Bosnia Croats.
	   Croatian and Muslim forces, by uniting, were able to beat back
Serb rebels and fight them to a standoff in the 3 1/2-year ethnic
war, setting the stage for the peace accords the United States
engineered in talks near Dayton, Ohio, in 1995.
	   But some Croatians have not lost their appetite for a ``greater
Croatia,'' one that at least would have tied parts of Bosnia to
neighboring Croatia or possibly annex them.
	   The accords set up a central government and two republics -- one
Serb and the other a combined Muslim-Croat enclave.
	   Before flying to Moscow to join President Bill Clinton at summit
talks, Albright was meeting with the NATO commander, Gen. Wesley
Clark to accelerate contingency plans for an attack on Serb forces
in the embattled Yugoslav province of Kosovo.
	   Renewing an old warning, Albright said Sunday that ``there is
beginning to be identification of the forces'' that would be used
in an attempt to halt a Serb offensive that has claimed a high
civilian toll and left tens of thousands of people homeless
refugees.
	   ``Neither the United States nor the European allies can tolerate
this much longer,'' she said on a busy day in the Balkans that was
marked also by positive signs.

Background on North Korea's missiles
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Here's a look at what kind of missiles North Korea
is believed to either have already produced or is currently
developing:
	   _THE DAEPODONG. South Korean officials said the missile launch
Monday was the first flight of this two-stage, liquid fuel missile
that would significantly increase the range of North Korea's rocket
forces. According to Jane's Strategic Weapon Systems, the Daepodong
1 could throw a 1,000 kilogram (450 pound) warhead 1,500 to 2,000
kilometers (950 to 1,250 miles), far enough to reach any target in
Japan and most major cities in China. A payload of that size is
large enough to carry nuclear and chemical weapons, as well as
conventional explosives. A much larger variant being developed
could possibly send a 1,500 kilogram (680 pound) warhead 3,500 to
6,000 kilometers (2,200 to 3,750 miles), or as far as southern
Alaska.
	   _THE RODONG. The Rodong 1 was test launched in 1993 and entered
service a year later. This single-staged liquid fuel missile can
fire a 1,000 kilogram (450 pound) warhead up to 1,000 kilometers
(620 miles), though it has never been fired more than 500
kilometers (310 miles). The Rodong 2 has a longer range of up to
1,500 kilometers (940 miles) but carries half the payload.
	   _SCUDS. Scuds B and C are North Korean variations on the
well-known Soviet design that saw service by Iraq in the 1990 Gulf
War. The two Scud types have ranges of 340 kilometers (210 miles)
and 500 kilometers (310 miles), respectively.

Bangkok Bank will turn small finance company into major player
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Bangkok Bank, Thailand's largest
commercial lender, said Monday it would acquire a 96.8 percent
stake in a small unlisted finance company it intends to turn into a
major player in the sector.
	   The bank said in a statement it would increase its current 10
percent holding in Thanksin Finance through subscribing to new
shares worth 676 million baht (dlrs 16 million).
	   Following a write down of Thaksin's existing capital by 90
percent the finance company's net assets were 1.28 billion baht
(dlrs 30.4 million) as of July 31.
	   The statement didn't mention the number of new shares or the
price per share.
	   ``The increased holding in Thaksin represents a strategic
business opportunity to establish the bank in the area of leasing
and hire purchase in which it previously has had limited
involvement,'' the statement said.
	   ``Thaksin offers access to a large and lucrative market and it
is the bank's objective to build Thaksin from a small niche player
into a large retail finance company,'' it added.
	   Meanwhile, Laem Thong Bank, one of Thailand's smallest banks,
requested Monday an extension of the deadline to submit first half
audited results to the stock exchange, following a government plan
to nationalize the bank.
	   ``LTB has requested an extension period for filing its financial
statements because the bank is in the process of raising capital as
instructed by the Bank of Thailand,'' the Stock Exchange of
Thailand said in a statement.
	   Normally, audited first half financial statements must be
submitted to the SET by Aug. 31. Laem Thong reported an unaudited
first half net loss of 1.58 billion baht (dlrs 37.6 million) on
July 22 this year.
	   The government has announced a banking sector reform package
which includes forcing debt-ridden Laem Thong Bank to merge with
state-owned Radhanasin Bank.
	   Also on Monday, Thai Farmers Bank said it is lowering its
minimum lending rate 0.25 percentage points effective Sept. 1 to
14.5 percent, the lowest prime rate seen at major commercial banks
since Sept. 1997.
	   The reductions in rates is the latest in a series of cuts that
have come since the Bank of Thailand eased monetary policy in
mid-June.

Western Europe fears Russia's growing crisis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANNE THOMPSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Chancellor Helmut Kohl reviewed Russia's worsening
economic crisis with U.S. President Bill Clinton over the weekend,
and Europe's finance chief called Monday for a meeting of EU common
currency nations.
	   Kohl spoke with Clinton just days before the U.S. president was
to begin a Moscow trip Tuesday for meetings aimed at helping
stabilize a Russian economy wrecked by the devaluation of the ruble
and the government's default on its debts.
	   The German chancellor also spoke with Russian President Boris
Yeltsin and with British Prime Minister Tony Blair, a Kohl
spokesman said Monday.
	   On the eve of the U.S. visit, however, European Union Finance
Commissioner Yves-Thibault de Silguy warned that Europe _
particularly the 11 nations set to adopt the euro next year _ has
more at stake in Russia's economy than the United States.
	   ``Forty percent of Russia's foreign trade is with Europe, and
only five percent is with the United States,'' he said Monday in an
interview with French radio Europe-1. ``But it's Clinton who's
going to Russia on Tuesday. And we have the means to act.''
	   Kohl, just weeks away from Sept. 27 national elections, also was
to speak with French President Jacques Chirac and Russian prime
minister-designate Viktor Chernomyrdin.
	   After dissolving the government, Yeltsin brought Chernomyrdin
back as prime minister a week ago because he hoped the familiar
figure would restore confidence in the government, badly damaged by
the ruble's sharp decline.
	   The communist party, however, said Tuesday it would block the
approval of a new prime minister _ despite the growing economic
crisis _ following the collapse of a proposed truce with Yeltsin.
	   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov said his party and other
hard-line groups would vote against Chernomyrdin because the
government had not made enough concessions on reducing Yeltsin's
powers.
	   Kohl said Monday he warned Yeltsin that Russia would receive no
infusion of financial aid from abroad unless he proceeded with
political reforms.
	   Former French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing, in an
interview Monday with radio station RTL, urged caution in any
rescue package for Russia. ``One mustn't help Russia
unconditionally because that would be useless,'' he said.
	   Some European commentators saw no other option.
	   ``As absurd as it sounds, there is nothing further for the West
to do but to pump money into Russia,'' read an editorial in the
Vienna newspaper Der Standard. ``Not because this time there is a
more trustworthy debtor. But the alternatives will be further
hysterical reactions on the international finance markets.''

Man sentenced to death for raping daughter
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ A man has been sentenced to die for raping
his 16-year-old daughter just two months after he had served a
10-year sentence for robbery and rape, a court official said
Monday.
	   Nguyen Van No, who was arrested in December, was sentenced to
death Saturday in Ho Chi Minh City. He has 15 days to appeal.
	   The government has vowed to crack down on child sex abuse, which
is on the rise in Vietnam. Some children have been sold to brothels
inside the country; others to work as prostitutes in neighboring
countries.

North Korea fires missile into seas between Russia and Japan
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By TODD ZAUN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ North Korea test-fired a newly developed,
long-range ballistic missile into open seas between Russia and
northwestern Japan on Monday, seriously upping the security stakes
in an already volatile corner of Asia.
	   The launch just after noon (0300 GMT) was confirmed by Japanese,
South Korean and United States defense officials.
	   Japan's Defense Agency, quoting unidentified U.S. military
officials based here, said the missile was probably aimed at waters
between Russia and Japan and landed about 300 kilometers (190
miles) southeast of Vladivostok, Russia.
	   The missile was ``confirmed to be a brand-new `Daepodong I' with
a range of 2,000 kilometers (1,240 miles),'' the South Korean
Defense Ministry said in a statement.
	   That range is twice as long as the North's previous staple
``Rodong'' series missiles.
	   Japanese Coast Guard patrol boats airplanes were immediately
dispatched to the area where the missile hit. But it was unclear
whether they could actually go to the site _ which was believed to
be close to or possibly inside Russian waters.
	   ``We see this as a very dangerous act,'' said chief government
spokesman Hiromu Nonaka. He said Japan would express its concern to
the North through diplomatic channels.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, visiting Sarajevo,
told reporters she was also alarmed by the test launch.
	   ``This is something that we will be raising with North Koreans
in the talks that are currently going on,'' she said.
	   Those talks, in New York, are over a proposal for the North to
suspend missile development in exchange for nuclear energy
know-how, and some Korea watchers said they suspect the launch was
timed to up the stakes.
	   ``Kim is good at brinksmanship,'' said Hajime Izumi, a noted
North Korea watcher and professor at Shizuoka University, referring
to North Korea's leader Kim Jong Il.
	   ``This shows that North Korea can make effective missiles,'' he
added. ``What remains to be seen is if they can mass produce them,
or deploy them.''
	   Masahiro Akiyama, deputy director of Japan's Defense Agency,
said the launch was not totally a surprise _ security experts, he
said, had been increasing their surveillance of the North since
earlier this month.
	   Stalinist North Korea, which over the past few years has been
foundering under devastating famines, is to convene its newly
elected parliament on Sept. 5, and are expected to elect Kim as the
country's president.
	   In June, North Korea also admitted for the first time that it
has sold missiles abroad. It had long been suspected of selling
missiles to Iran and Syria.
	   But very little is known about North Korea's missile program,
and its possession of a significantly better missile would be a
matter of serious concern throughout the region.
	   North Korea's best-known ballistic missile is the Rodong, which
has a range of about 1,000 kilometers (620 miles). It was last test
fired in 1993, and also landed in the same area of the Sea of
Japan, which divides the Korean Peninsula from Japan.
	   With its 1,000 kilometer (620-mile range), the Rodong I missile,
a modified Scud, could strike South Korea and much of Japan. The
newer missile would put even more of Japan within range.
	   In 1996, the United States began talks with North Korea aimed at
persuading the secretive Communist country to freeze its missile
program and to join an international agreement designed to restrict
missile proliferation. The talks stalled.
	   Japan is currently boosting its budget for joint development of
a missile defense system with the United States, and has reportedly
earmarked 500 million yen (dlrs 3.6 million) for the project next
year.
	   The United States has 37,000 troops stationed in South Korea,
many of them based near its border with North Korea. It has roughly
another 50,000 troops in Japan.
	   Monday's was the secretive North's fourth test-firing of a
missile since 1984 and its first in five years.

IOC refutes de Merode's comments, makes up with Spanish officials
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ On a peace-making mission with
Spanish officials, the International Olympic Committee on Monday
publicly announced that the ``outstanding progress in Spanish sport
has nothing to do with doping.''
	   The statement was made following a meeting Sunday between IOC
and Spanish officials in an effort to smooth ruffled feathers after
Prince Alexandre de Merode, the IOC's anti-drug chief, accused
Spanish sports doctors of encouraging the use of banned substances.
	   The meeting, attended by IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch;
the President of the Spanish Olympic Committee Carlos Ferrer;
Santiago Fisas, the Spanish secretary of state for sports; IOC
vice-president Keba Mbaye and de Merode, was a final effort to end
the on-going quarrel.
	   In an obvious attempt to reconcile with Spanish officials, the
IOC statement issued Monday refuted de Merode's inflammatory
comments, praising Spain's athletes and sporting principles.
	   ``In the last 10 years, Spanish sport has made outstanding
progress, which has been internationally recognized,'' the
statement read. ``This is due to the individual effort of Spanish
athletes ... together with the unanimous acceptance of Sport by
Spanish society, which regards its athletes as role models and
firmly supports them.
	   ``This progress has nothing to do with doping or with any other
practice contrary to the principles of fair-play.''
	   The IOC insisted that Spain ``maintains a firm commitment to the
fight against this harmful practice (doping), and closely
collaborates with the International Olympic Committee in its
eradication.''
	   The fact that Spain was home to two of the IOC's 26 officially
recognized doping-control laboratories worldwide was proof of the
nation's commitment, the statement said. (Germany and the United
States are the only other countries to have two such labs.)
	   The IOC felt that the ``large number of anti-doping controls
(more than 7,000 in 1997 and 5,000 so far this year),'' both in
official competitions and random out-of-competition-testing, was
further proof of Spain's commitment to the fight against drugs.
	   In conclusion, the IOC applauded Spanish sport doctors' efforts
to abolish the use of drugs.
	   ``Spanish sports doctors lend their efficient support to the
fight against doping,'' said the IOC statement. ``And their work in
this field is acknowledged by the International Olympic Committee
and its Medical Commission, which has several Spanish specialists
as members of its sub-commission.''
	   De Merode sparked the entire debate two weeks ago when he told
the French newspaper Le Figaro that some Spanish sports doctors
were encouraging the use of banned drugs.
	   ``One must not forget that Spanish sports, for a long time, has
had tendencies toward doping,'' de Merode, chairman of the
International Olympic Committee's medical commission, told the
paper.
	   Spanish government officials accused de Merode of slander, and
the Spanish national Olympic committee called for his resignation
from his IOC post unless he retracted the comments.
	   While de Merode later expanded his attack to include almost all
countries, claiming most had contributed to the current doping
crisis, it was too little, too late.
	   At an IOC crisis meeting last week, Samaranch scheduled the
meeting in an attempt to undo the damage.

Thai government finds big bank account with unspent defense funds
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Government auditors have found more
than 350 million U.S. dollars belonging to the defense ministry
sitting dormant in a U.S. bank account, a senior government
official said Monday.
	   The finance ministry should put the money _ originally meant for
arms purchases from the United States _ to productive use during
the country's current economic crisis, said Deputy Prime Minister
Bhichai Rattakul.
	   The money was discovered in March after Bhichai ordered the
Office of Auditor-General to make an inventory of the government's
assets at home and abroad.
	   The account, at the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank of New York, was
opened 16 years ago to pay for arms purchases made under
Washington's Foreign Military Sales program, Bhichai said. Held in
the name of the Bank of Thailand, it contains about U.S. dlrs 367
million. The funds apparently served as an escrow account to cover
arms purchases.
	   ``We should use the money to help alleviate the impact of the
economic recession, rather than leaving it in the bank,'' Bhichai
told The Associated Press.
	   The money has apparently sat unused, drawing interest, since the
FMS program with Thailand was discontinued several years ago, said
Bhichai. The FMS program involved government-to-government sales of
defense items.
	   According to a description of the program from the U.S. Defense
Department: ``Recipient governments generally pay cash for the full
costs associated with such sales; however, programs of U.S.
appropriated grants and repayable loans are available to selected
recipients to permit their purchase of these Defense items.''
	   It was not known if any of the money in the account came from
U.S. grants or loans.
	   A U.S. Embassy spokesman had no comment on the discovered funds
pending a check with Defense Department authorities in Washington.
	   `` We should be thankful to the past government who opened this
account,'' aid Bhichai. ``Now the money will be very useful to the
country.''
	   He noted that since the Thai currency, the baht, was devalued
last year, converting the dollars back to baht would allow the
government to make a hefty profit.

Child falls ill to potentially fatal strain of E. coli
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A child has been stricken with a potentially
fatal strain of E. coli after visiting Britain, in the first such
case reported in the territory, the government said Monday.
	   The four-year-old boy was believed to have contracted the
O157:H7 strain from drinking unpasteurized milk while staying in a
farm in Britain in August, a statement said.
	   The boy was hospitalised in stable condition, it said.
	   The O157 bacteria is commonly found in the intestines of cows
and is commonly transmitted by undercooked beef, poultry or
contaminated water.
	   Several outbreaks have been reported in the United States
recently, and an outbreak last year forced the recall of million of
pounds of beef there.
	   The bacteria was blamed for killing 11 people and sickening
thousands in Japan in an outbreak in 1996.

Philippine president, Brunei ruler to discuss regional currency
</HEADLINE>
proposal

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ President Joseph Estrada said Monday
he would discuss a proposal to use Southeast Asian currencies in
regional trading with Brunei's Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah, who will
visit Manila this week.
	   The Brunei ruler will arrive Monday night for a three-day state
visit and will be the first head of state to travel to the the
Philippines since Estrada took office on June 30.
	   The two leaders are scheduled to meet on Tuesday and their talks
are expected to focus on bilateral ties and how Southeast Asian
countries could bounce back from continuing currency declines and
stockmarket upheavals, Estrada's spokesman said.
	   Estrada said he would bring up a proposal to use Southeast Asian
currencies in regional trade transactions to enable countries in
the region to save U.S. dollar reserves.
	   The Manila government is studying how the idea could be
implemented, Estrada said, adding the Philippines and Malaysia
already are practicing it to a limited extent.

Philippine peso ends lower, shares down on regional concerns
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with closing figures

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine peso closed lower
against the U.S. dollar Monday on concerns that Hong Kong's wobbly
financial markets could affect regional currency markets, traders
said.
	   The dollar averaged 43.923 pesos on the Philippine Dealing
System, up 4.9 centavos from Friday's average of 43.874 pesos.
	   Volume totaled dlrs 112.2 million compared with Friday's dlrs
124.2 million.
	   Traders said uncertainties in Hong Kong's financial markets and
the dollar-yen exchange rates drove other Southeast Asian
currencies lower.
	   Although there was huge demand for the U.S. currency, there was
enough dollar supply, preventing a sharp drop in the peso's value,
traders said.
	   The central bank wasn't active in the market, holding on to its
overnight borrowing rate of 16 percent and its overnight lending
rate of 18 percent.
	   Philippine shares, meanwhile, closed slightly lower, weighed
down by Wall Street's retreat Friday and poor prospect of Manila's
economy.
	   The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 114.31 points, or 1.4
percent, Friday to 8051.68.
	   Officials also announced Friday that the economy contracted in
the second quarter, causing fears that the Philippines is headed
for a recession like other Asian countries plagued by the year-old
regional financial crisis.
	   Preliminary figures showed the 30-share Philippine Stock
Exchange index was down 2.46 points, or 0.2 percent, to 1192.25,
extending its losing skid to a seventh straight trading day. It
lost 72.28 points Friday to 1194.71.
	   The broader All Shares Index ended 1.02 points to 400.47 after
sliding 16.98 points Friday.
	   Losers were outpacing gainers 61 to 34, while 33 issues were
unchanged.
	   Ricardo Puig, research director of Kim Eng Securities, said the
announcement of a contraction in the economy heightened concerns
among traders that the Philippines could slide into a recession.
	   The country's gross national product dropped by 0.7 percent as
agricultural production fell due to a prolonged drought. Industrial
production slowed due to the currency crisis.
	   The government says it could still attain a minimum 2 percent
growth in the GNP this year, but many economists disagree. The
average GNP growth in the first half was pegged at 0.6 percent.
	   Erwin Balita, an analyst for Securities 2000 Inc., said
investors were hesitant of investing in equities due to poor
economic prospects.
	   Although the market index's recent retreat has made stocks
cheaper, many investors still were wary of the risks.

Villagers shocked over mother's alleged drowning of four sons
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BEATA PASEK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ A woman suspected of killing her four
sons, whose bodies were found in barrels of water outside her
house, would only say she wanted to join them, police said Monday.
	   The deaths Sunday in Mlynne, a village 350 kilometers (220
miles) south of Warsaw, left a shocked community wondering why
their neighbor, identified only as Anna J., might have killed her
sons aged 8, 7, 5 and 1.
	   Their father found the boys' bodies in barrels of water outside
the house when he returned home from Mass on Sunday, police said.
He called a doctor who pronounced the boys dead, and police found
the mother hiding in the house.
	   Her only comment was, ``I want to go to my children,'' said
local police spokeswoman Zofia Pawlowska-Nowak.
	   Anna J., who had no history of mental illness, was put under
observation in a mental hospital near Krakow, in southern Poland,
according to police. An autopsy this week would try to determine if
the boys were strangled or drowned, police said.
	   Two daily newspapers, Gazeta Wyborcza and Zycie, ran front-page
headlines that said: ``Nobody knows why.''
	   According to Gazeta Wyborcza, the nation's largest daily, the
father locked himself in the house Sunday and refused to speak.
Neighbors said they were bewildered.
	   ``This is unexplainable to me. After all, a mother always
protects her children,'' the Rev. Jozef Wisniowski, a parish
priest, told Gazeta Wyborcza.
	   Others called the family poor but hard-working, living in a
two-room house on a four-hectare (10-acre) plot with a horse, two
cows and several pigs, according to newspaper reports.
	   ``She was a believer, took great care of the house, liked to
laugh a lot,'' Zycie quoted Janina Chylinska, a neighbor, as
saying.
	   ``The boys were good, smart, hard-working and well-groomed,''
said Kazimierz Chylinski, another neighbor, to the newspaper. ``She
was heard to have said the kids would have it better in heaven.
Nobody took it seriously.''

Thailand will ask U.S. government to revoke rice trademark
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand will ask the United States to
revoke the trademark held by a U.S. company on ``Jasmati'' rice,
claiming it misleads consumers into believing it is derived from a
premium Thai rice, a senior government researcher said Monday.
	   Rice Research Institute director Sutep Limthongkul accused the
Alvin, Texas-based company Rice Tec of using the name ``Jasmati''
to purposely mislead consumers into believing that its rice is a
cross between Thai jasmine rice and the basmati variety, which is
grown in India and Pakistan.
	   ``Jasmati has no genetic relation to either jasmine or
basmati,'' said Sutep, whose institute is a government agency under
the agriculture ministry. ``This is misleading.''
	   Rice Tec's rice actually derives from a strain developed in
Italy.
	   Jasmine rice, also known as fragrant rice, is one of the top
qualities of rice available on the export market. Thailand, the
world's largest rice exporter, shipped out 5.3 million tons of rice
in 1997, of which 25 percent was jasmine rice.
	   The U.S. is one of the top three markets for Thai jasmine rice.
	   The Thai government will file its complaint with the U.S. Patent
and Trademark Office.

Norwegian PM takes sick leave for depression
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Prime Minister Kjell Magne Bondevik is
suffering from depression due to overwork and taking a week's
sick-leave, his office announced Monday.
	   Bondevik, who leads a fragile minority government, has been
under considerable pressure recently as the country wrestles with
economic troubles.
	   The Norwegian currency, the krone, has declined about 6 percent
over the past month and the country faces a revenue drop due to
declining oil prices.
	   Bondevik's week off comes as the parliament was to begin
debating next year's budget.
	   The sick leave also forced him to cancel his plans to travel to
the Middle East Sept. 7-12.

Yeltsin, four other leaders to meet in Kazakstan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Despite Russia's turmoil, President Boris Yeltsin
will fly to Kazakstan next week for a summit with the leaders of
four neighboring countries, officials said Monday.
	   Yeltsin is to be joined at the Sept. 8-11 gathering in Almaty by
his counterparts Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus, Nursultan
Nazarbayev of Kazakstan, Askar Akayev of Kyrgyzstan and Emomali
Rakhmonov of Tajikistan.
	   Four of those former Soviet republics, all but Tajikistan,
signed an agreement in March 1996 pledging to deepen ties among
them but stopping short of a formal union.
	   The presidents of the five nations attending next week's summit
will sign agreements setting up a customs union and taking more
steps toward economic union, Nigmatjan Singarin, chairman of the
integration committee of the four republics, told the ITAR-Tass
news agency.
	   The prime ministers of the five countries also are scheduled to
hold a one-day meeting in Almaty next week to sign related
documents. It isn't yet clear if acting Russian Prime Minister
Viktor Chernomyrdin, who is trying to win confirmation of his new
government, plans to go.
	   Documents to be signed would allow unimpeded travel by citizens
of the countries, lift customs restrictions, facilitate money
transfers and provide for mutual recognition of academic degrees,
among other points.
	   The five-nation alliance is the latest attempt to form a union
among former Soviet republics. The Commonwealth of Independent
States, a loose grouping consisting of the 12 ex-republics, has
proven largely ineffectual.

Hundreds witnessed first execution by Palestinian Authority
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KARIN LAUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The Palestinian Authority's first execution was
witnessed by hundreds of people who shouted ``God is great'' in
approval when two convicted killers died in a burst of bullets from
a firing squad, witnesses said as new details emerged Monday.
	   The two men, shaking and unable to stand up without support, had
pleaded for mercy and were forced to listen to a slow count from 1
to 10 before being killed by a firing squad of 10 policemen in
black hoods in the courtyard of the Gaza City jail Sunday.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's order to execute two members
of his 40,000-strong security force won strong support in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip on Monday, judging by a sampling of views.
	   The two condemned men had killed two other policemen in a
long-standing blood feud, and the crime was widely seen as a prime
example of a growing problem _ officers abusing their power to
settle personal scores.
	   With the execution, Arafat also signaled that he remains in
control and will not be challenged. His message comes at a time
when he is less robust than in the past, both physically and
politically.
	   Arafat's actions raised questions about whether he would use
such extreme punishment to deal with opponents in the future.
	   Palestinian human rights activist Bassem Eid said that while the
execution could pave the way for more human rights abuses by the
Palestinian Authority, he did not expect a rash of executions. Eid
said it was unlikely Arafat would use executions to stifle
political opponents.
	   Twenty-three prisoners have been sentenced to death since the
Palestinian Authority was formed in 1994, but Arafat commuted all
of those terms to life in prison.
	   Arafat's most powerful political rival, Sheik Ahmed Yassin of
the Islamic militant group Hamas, even welcomed the execution,
saying it was in line with Islamic law stipulating that killers be
put to death.
	   Israeli government spokesman Moshe Fogel said the executions
showed that Arafat can act ``swiftly and even brutally'' against
those who hurt his interests, while at the same time dragging his
feet in fighting terrorism aimed at Israel.
	   The two men executed Sunday were Mohammed Abu Sultan, 25, and
Raed Abu Sultan, 24, who served in the Gaza Strip police force. A
military court sentenced them to death in a half-hour trial
Saturday for gunning down brothers Majdi Khaldi, 32, and Mohammed
Khaldi, 30, also members of the security forces.
	   Some 500 people, including Cabinet ministers, legislators,
members of Arafat's Fatah movement and members of the Khaldi family
were invited to witness the execution.
	   Sami Awadah, 29, a member of Arafat's elite bodyguard Force 17,
said the condemned men had trouble standing up and one was shaking
with fear. They pleaded for mercy, but were turned down, Awadah
said.
	   Shouts of ``Allahu Akbar,'' or ``God is great,'' rose from many
in the crowd when a burst of shots rang out in the courtyard.

Taiwanese call for continued probe into Indonesia rape reports
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwanese women's groups on Monday
demanded that Indonesia continue a probe into allegations of mass
rapes of ethnic Chinese women during the May riots in the Southeast
Asian country.
	   Activists who staged a morning sit-in outside the Indonesian
Economic and Trade Office said investigations must not be allowed
to conclude with the Indonesian government's assertion Saturday
that it had found no proof that ethnic Chinese women were raped.
	   They demanded an apology for what they said were false reports
in the Indonesian press that quoted Taiwanese activists as saying
rape accusations were a ruse to defame the Indonesian government.
	   Lee Li-fen, secretary general of the End Child Prostitution
Association, said members of a survey team that visited Indonesia
earlier this month had collected circumstantial evidence of
``serious sexual harassment'' of women and girls during the May
bedlam. But she said the activists had not spoken with specific
victims.
	   ``Since there is fear of the police among most people, rape
victims are understandably hesitant to identify themselves,'' Lee
said.
	   Indonesia is anxious to close the probe, and Taiwanese investors
in the country say they have been warned by police against
discussing the rape allegations, Lee said.
	   Women's groups claim at least 168 Chinese women and girls were
raped during the riots, which claimed 1,200 lives and led to the
ouster of President Suharto.
	   Widely circulated on the Internet, the accusations have
infuriated ethnic Chinese worldwide, sparking protests against the
Indonesian government in China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, the United
States and elsewhere.
	   Indonesia's tiny Chinese minority has become a scapegoat for
Indonesia's economic ills because it dominates commerce in the
nation of 202 million people.

Hundreds witnessed first execution by Palestinian Authority

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The Palestinian Authority's first execution was
witnessed by hundreds of people who shouted ``God is great'' in
approval when two convicted killers died in a burst of bullets from
a firing squad, witnesses said as new details emerged Monday.
	   The two men, shaking and unable to stand up without support, had
pleaded for mercy and were forced to listen to a slow count from 1
to 10 before being killed by a firing squad of 10 policemen in
black hoods in the courtyard of the Gaza City jail Sunday.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's order to execute two members
of his 40,000-strong security force won strong support in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip on Monday, judging by a sampling of views.
	   The two condemned men had killed two other policemen in a
long-standing blood feud, and the crime was widely seen as a prime
example of a growing problem _ officers abusing their power to
settle personal scores.
	   With the execution, Arafat also signaled that he remains in
control and will not be challenged. His message comes at a time
when he is less robust than in the past, both physically and
politically.
	   Arafat's actions raised questions about whether he would use
such extreme punishment to deal with opponents in the future.
	   Palestinian human rights activist Bassem Eid said that while the
execution could pave the way for more human rights abuses by the
Palestinian Authority, he did not expect a rash of executions. Eid
said it was unlikely Arafat would use executions to stifle
political opponents.
	   Twenty-three prisoners have been sentenced to death since the
Palestinian Authority was formed in 1994, but Arafat commuted all
of those terms to life in prison.
	   Arafat's most powerful political rival, Sheik Ahmed Yassin of
the Islamic militant group Hamas, even welcomed the execution,
saying it was in line with Islamic law stipulating that killers be
put to death.
	   Israeli government spokesman Moshe Fogel said the executions
showed that Arafat can act ``swiftly and even brutally'' against
those who hurt his interests, while at the same time dragging his
feet in fighting terrorism aimed at Israel.
	   The two men executed Sunday were Mohammed Abu Sultan, 25, and
Raed Abu Sultan, 24, who served in the Gaza Strip police force. A
military court sentenced them to death after a two-day trial
Saturday for gunning down brothers Majdi Khaldi, 32, and Mohammed
Khaldi, 30, also members of the security forces. It took the
tribunal a half hour to reach a verdict.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 1100 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Share prices fell sharply in Hong Kong and
Singapore when Asian markets reopened Monday after last week's
global stock market rout. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index shed 7.1
percent, or 554.70 points, to 7,275.04. In Singapore, where the
benchmark index had crashed through the crucial 900-point level
Friday for the first time in 10 years, shares fell 28.83 points, or
3.25 percent, to a new low of 856.43. But they rose in Japan,
despite more bad news about Russia's economic and political
stability. On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, where the benchmark
225-issue Nikkei Stock Average had sunk Friday to a 12-year low,
stock prices rose moderately Monday, gaining 192.26 points, or 1.38
percent, to close the day at 14,107.89. ``Given the big falls we
had last week, world markets may be taking a breather. But
generally the fundamentals in Japan and Asia as a whole remain
bleak,'' Peter Morgan, a senior economist at HSBC Securities Japan,
Ltd., said in an interview. Elsewhere in Asia, the key stock index
in Taiwan fell 2.8 percent to finish at a 22-month low, but rose
1.8 percent in South Korea. (WORLD MARKETS)
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong stocks dived Monday as the government
halted its two-week stock buying spree, with the key index plunging
more than 7 percent, analysts said. To fend off speculators, the
government started scooping up huge amounts of shares in the past
two weeks, and successfully drove up prices to a level at which
speculators who bet against the market suffered huge losses. To
further protect the market, the Hong Kong Futures Exchange
announced at the weekend new measures to make it more expensive for
speculators to place bets in the futures market. Analysts and
researchers are split as to whether new measures intended to curb
futures speculation go far enough. Josephine Hui, research director
of Celestial Asia Securities, said speculators still could easily
evade new reporting rules by spreading their purchases among
several brokerages. Norman Chan, associate investment research
director at Allen Perkins Ltd., said the new measures would drive
off genuine investors and further hurt market sentiment. (HONG
KONG-INTERVENTION)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's Communist opposition said Monday it would
block the approval of a new prime minister following the collapse
of a proposed truce with Boris Yeltsin, despite Russia's growing
economic crisis. Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov said his party
and other hard-line groups would vote against confirming acting
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin because the government had not
made enough concessions on reducing Yeltsin's powers. Both sides
warned that popular discontent could explode if the crisis
continues. Yeltsin's parliament envoy Alexander Kotenkov warned the
opposition that both sides could be swept aside if there is no
swift action to end the crisis. ``If this chaos lasts for several
more weeks, it may happen that there will be neither Communists nor
us,'' he said. The government insisted it remained in control and
that work on tackling the country's economic crisis was going
ahead. Central Bank trading on the ruble has been suspended since
last week. But at several Moscow currency shops on Monday, the
exchange rate was at 9 rubles to the dollar, substantially stronger
than last week when it was as high as 12 rubles to the dollar.
(RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ About 140 million people, or two out
of every three Indonesians, are likely to be living in poverty in
1999 because of economic turmoil, according to a U.N. report
released Monday. The forecast was one of the bleakest since the
Indonesian rupiah and other Asian currencies plunged more than a
year ago, launching a crisis that some fear could now spread to the
West. In another piece of bad news, the government announced Monday
that inflation for the year was 69 percent. Millions of people have
had to cut back on food because prices are so high. Plagued this
year by riots and political upheaval that ousted former President
Suharto, Indonesia has suffered more than its Asian neighbors and
efforts to revive the economy have been slow. Unemployment is about
20 percent. There have been scattered riots over the last week, and
worries abound that social unrest will intensify as conditions
worsen. In the report, a poor person was defined as earning less
than dlrs 1 a day in the cities, or 80 U.S. cents in rural areas.
(INDONESIA-POVERTY)
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Holocaust survivors plan to file a class-action
lawsuit Monday against Volkswagen, saying they were forced to work
as slave labor for the German automaker. In a similar action,
attorney Ed Fagan filed a federal lawsuit Sunday in New York
against several German and Austrian companies _ including
Volkswagen _ over use of slave labor. ``The industrial companies of
Germany played an integral role in the Holocaust,'' Fagan said.
``They masterminded and implemented with the Nazi regime a ...
conspiracy to purposely enslave and exploit Holocaust victims and
to profit from the Holocaust.'' Fagan's lawsuit also named Siemens,
Krupp, Daimler-Benz, Audi, Wurttembergische Metall Warenfabrik,
Heinkel, Eicon Technology, BMW and Leica Camera. The lawsuits
follow the agreement by Swiss banks to settle outstanding Holocaust
claims for dlrs 1.25 billion that were negotiated in part by the
same lawyers. Historians believe more than 7 million people were
coerced to work in Germany under Hitler's regime. The government
has so far turned down survivors' demands for back wages, but
Volkswagen said in July it would establish a fund to pay back
wages. (US-VOLKSWAGEN-SLAVE LABOR)

Japan refuses to endorse commitment to NKorea reactor project
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Japan's refusal to endorse funding document

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ In a show of protest against North
Korea's missile test-firing, Japan on Monday refused to endorse its
financial commitment to two nuclear reactors to be built in the
communist country, Seoul officials said.
	   Four key members of an international consortium building two
commercial reactors in North Korea _ the United States, Japan,
South Korea and the European Union _ had been scheduled to adopt a
resolution Monday on funding of the dlrs 4.6 billion project.
	   But Japan retracted its endorsement of the resolution at the
last moment, expressing ``serious concern'' about the North's
test-firing of a ballistic missile into open seas near the northern
tip of its territory, South Korean officials said.
	   South Korean officials of the consortium, called the Korean
Peninsula Energy Development Organization, hastily retracted its
earlier news release on the adoption of the resolution, citing
Japan's last-minute reservations.
	   South Korean officials said privately they do not believe Japan
would withdraw from the funding of the reactor project itself.
	   ``There will be a formal announcement of the resolution when a
new date of its adoption is set,'' South Korean officials
representing the consortium said in a separate news release.
	   The flip-flop followed reports that North Korea test-fired a
newly developed, long-range ballistic missile into seas between
Russia and northwestern Japan, seriously upping the security stakes
in the area.
	   The resolution would have been the first official document
detailing how to finance the project promised as a reward for North
Korea's 1994 pledge to freeze and eventually dismantle its suspect
nuclear weapons program.
	   According a full text of the resolution released to the press
earlier, virtually all of the estimated dlrs 4.6 billion cost will
be borne by the four key consortium members.
	   South Korea will assume dlrs 3.22 billion, or 70 percent, of the
cost; Japan dlrs 1 billion and the European Union dlrs 80 million.
	   The United States will organize financing of the dlrs 300
million difference between the new budget and the total amount
committed by the member countries.
	   The United States also will be responsible for 500,000 tons of
fuel oil to be given North Korea annually until the first of the
two reactors, with a rated capacity of 1,000 megawatts, is built by
2003.
	   The reactors will be built in Sinpo, a seaside village in a
northeastern tip of North Korea. Ground leveling has been
completed, with main construction work due to start in October.
	   The new light-water reactors will replace North Korea's
Soviet-developed graphite reactors which produce greater amounts of
weapons-grade plutonium, a key ingredient for atomic bombs.
	   Despite repeated denials, the North's communist government is
believed to have obtained enough plutonium to make at least one
bomb before its nuclear program was frozen under the 1994 agreement
signed with the United States.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   TOKYO (AP) _ North Korea test-fired a newly developed,
long-range ballistic missile into open seas between Russia and
northwestern Japan on Monday, seriously raising the security stakes
in an already volatile corner of Asia. The launch just after noon
(0300 GMT) was confirmed by Japanese, South Korean and United
States defense officials. Japan's Defense Agency, quoting
unidentified U.S. military officials based here, said the missile
was probably aimed at waters between Russia and Japan and landed
about 300 kilometers (190 miles) southeast of Vladivostok, Russia.
The missile was ``confirmed to be a brand-new `Daepodong I' with a
range of 2,000 kilometers (1,240 miles),'' the South Korean Defense
Ministry said in a statement. That range is twice as long as the
North's previous staple ``Rodong'' series missiles. ``We see this
as a very dangerous act,'' said Japan's chief government spokesman
Hiromu Nonaka. U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said she
would raise the issue in New York talks over a proposal for the
North to suspend missile development in exchange for nuclear energy
technology. (NORTH KOREA-MISSILE)
	   JIANLI, China _ Monday's new crest on the Yangtze River means
China's summer flooding is far from over for the 2,000 people
living nearby in tents on a soggy field on the outskirts of this
central city. The floods that have devastated the Yangtze basin,
China's northeast and Tibet are not expected to recede for weeks.
The government estimates more than 3,000 people have died and 5
million houses have been destroyed in the worst floods in decades.
Everyone in the camp was evacuated Aug. 5 from Xinzhou village when
government flood control officials ordered a secondary embankment
opened to divert floodwaters, relieve pressure on the main Yangtze
River dikes and protect the city of Wuhan. In all, the blowing up
of dikes made 96,000 people homeless and submerged 331 square
kilometers of land (132 square miles). Some villagers were bitter
that their homes were flooded to save Wuhan, but most were just
resigned. Flood relief officials predicted the Yangtze would not
reach record heights in the eighth and latest flood crest raging
downstream this week. (CHINA-FLOODS)
	   CRATHIE, Scotland (AP) _ A year after Princess Diana's death,
thousands of people on Monday commemorated one of the most public
lives, while those who knew her best marked the anniversary of a
very private grief in the seclusion of their Scottish castle.
Diana's beloved boys, Prince William, 16, and Prince Harry, 13,
looking somber and wearing black ties, prayed for their mother at a
private service near Balmoral Castle, where their father woke them
last Aug. 31 to tell them of her fatal car crash in Paris. The pile
of flowers at the gates of the princess' former home at Kensington
Palace in London grew Monday morning to about a thousand bouquets.
The national flag, the Union Jack, flew at half staff on government
buildings and royal residences, as an official symbol of the
personal and public remembrance of Diana. Queen Elizabeth II was
criticized after the princess' death for not lowering the royal
standard at Buckingham Palace in her memory. The queen on Monday
thanked people who have sent many messages of sympathy, through the
royal website as well as in the mail. (BRITAIN-DIANA ANNIVERSARY)
	   MATADI, Congo(AP) _ Angolan troops fighting on behalf of
Congolese President Laurent Kabila are prepared to attack
rebel-held territory in eastern Congo after capturing key rebel
positions in the west, a senior commander said. ``The only way for
life to become normal is to end this conflict,'' said Angolan army
chief of staff Joao de Matos. ``We are ready to move east to do
that.'' Kabila's cabinet director, Abdoulaye Yerodia on Monday said
a counteroffensive in the east was in the works _ a push that would
move this central African country's civil war away from the capital
and into rebel-dominated terrain. A rebel coalition backed by
Rwanda and Uganda had been poised just weeks ago to topple Kabila's
government and capture the capital, Kinshasa. Kabila regrouped and
enlisted the help of Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia _ a move that
turned the tables on the rebels, but has also internationalized
Congo's war and threatens the stability of an already troubled
region. (CONGO)
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Cheers rose from a crowd of hundreds who saw
the Palestinian Authority's first executions, witnesses say as new
details emerged Monday. On Sunday, a 10-member firing squad wearing
black hoods executed two Palestinian policemen who were convicted
of killing two brothers at a wedding as part of the a longstanding
blood feud. In approving the Palestinian Authority's first ever
execution, Yasser Arafat sent a strong signal that abuse of power
will not be tolerated among the 40,000 Palestinians in uniform.
Mohammed Abu Sultan, 25 and Raed Abu Sultan, 24, brothers and
members of the Palestinian police force in the Gaza Strip, were
sentenced to death Saturday by a military court for gunning down
two other brothers. In the past, death sentences were commuted to
life in prison on direct orders from Arafat. But the incidents of
Palestinian forces using their uniforms to settle personal scores
have begun to mount over the past year. Palestinian human rights
activist Bassam Eid condemned the death penalty and said Arafat had
``no right to confiscate the life of any Palestinian.''

Turkish Cypriot leader offers confederation to Greek Cypriots
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with comments from Turkish foreign minister &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ The leader of the breakaway Turkish
Cypriot state on Monday proposed setting up a confederation of
equal states as a way to end the 24-year-old division of this
Mediterranean island.
	   ``We propose the establishment of a Cyprus confederation
composed of two peoples and two states,'' Rauf Denktash told a news
conference held with Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem. ``The
framework of our proposal is open to negotiation.''
	   Cem said the offer, a modified version of the Turkish proposal
for a two-zone, bi-communal federation, had Turkey's
``full-backing.''
	   ``We hope that the Greek Cypriots will seriously consider the
proposal and see it as a last chance for reconciliation,'' Cem
said.
	   ``It is time that they recognize that we are the legal
government of the Turkish Cypriots,'' Denktash told private NTV
television without elaborating on the details of the proposed
confederation.
	   ``We believe that only this structure will provide for the
secuity of both sides and will safeguard their identity and
well-being,'' Denktash said. ``If the Greek Cypriots agree to this
final basis, we are ready to begin negotiations to establish the
Cyprus Confederation.''
	   Under the offer, the Turkish Cypriot still insists on
international recognition but abandons its long opposition to
joining the European Union before Turkey can.
	   Turkey and Turkish Cypriots have been arguing that EU membership
for Greek Cypriots would amount to unification with Greece, already
an EU member.
	   The Denktash proposal also foresees the establishment of
``symmetrical ties'' between Greek Cypriots and Greece and between
Turkish Cypriots and Turkey.
	   The offer comes at a time when tension is running high on the
island over Greek Cypriot plans to deploy Russian made S-300
anti-aircraft missiles.
	   Even while making the peace gesture, Cem reiterated that Turkey
would act to protect the Turkish Cypriots' if Greek Cypriots go
ahead with the deployment.
	   ``If they bring their death machines to Cyprus, Turkey will do
whatever necessary for Turkish Cypriots' security,'' he said.
	   Cyprus has been divided in Greek and Turkish sectors since 1974
when Turkey invaded the Mediterranean island following a
short-lived coup backed by supporters of union with Greece.

First `test tube' baby in 8 years named Saddam
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The first baby born at a government-run
hospital in eight years using in vitro fertilization has been named
Saddam in honor of the Iraqi president, the official Iraqi News
Agency reported Monday.
	   The agency said that the mother, Faten Abdel-Majid, and the
child, who weighted 4 kilograms (nearly 9 pounds) at birth on
Sunday, were in good condition.
	   Abdel-Majid was quoted as saying she had been unable to become
pregnant following a botched operation six years ago. She then
approached the state-run Al-Alawiya Hospital, where doctors
succeeded with an in vitro fertilization process, the agency said.
	   The agency quoted the parents and the head of the hospital as
thanking President Saddam Hussein for ``giving life to the
test-tube unit (at the hospital) after the unjust U.N. embargo.''
	   It was a reference to the punishing trade sanctions imposed by
the United Nations to punish Iraq for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   Although the sanctions exempt humanitarian goods, Iraq has
complained that it doesn't have the money to buy needed equipment
or spare parts for its hospitals.
	   The weekly Nabdh al-Shabab newspaper on Sunday said Saddam
Hussein had ``directly funded'' a special imaging machine for use
in fertility programs at Al-Alawiya Hospital. The paper did not say
how much the machine cost.

Government opens offices to probe Algeria's disappeared
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ The government said Monday it would open
offices nationwide to help investigate the disappearance of
Algerians during the country's violent six-year insurgency.
	   Some 48 offices will be opened across the country on Sept 1, and
authorities are inviting relatives of missing people to leave
dossiers of their loved ones to aid investigations.
	   Human rights groups, citing witness accounts, have suggested
that Algeria's army had a role in some of the thousands of reported
disappearances in the past six years. An estimated 75,000 people,
including Islamic militants, civilians and security forces, have
been killed since 1992.
	   Human rights groups have asked authorities to take concrete
steps to investigate the disappearances.
	   Authorities said the opening of the offices coincided with 554
new cases of missing people being lodged with the Interior
Ministry.
	   In June, Interior Minister Mustapha Benmansour dismissed a
report sent to Algeria's parliament by Louiza Hanoune, the
president of the leftist Workers Party.
	   The report cited a list of several hundred people who had gone
missing, but Benmansour said the report was ``a fabrication.''
	   Although many of the disappeared are feared dead, Algeria's
government-run National Observatory for Human Rights says some may
have secretly fled the country, or joined the insurgents.
	   Algeria's insurgency began after the army canceled legislative
elections the now-banned Islamic Salvation Front was poised to win.

Brancusi's chipped ``Kiss'' provokes local row
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Who broke ``The Kiss''?
	   Constantin Brancusi's famous 1907 sculpture, valued at dlrs 15
million, got chipped during a March exhibition in the Netherlands
and is causing a local row.
	   In July, a Dutch insurance company paid dlrs 120,000 damages to
the Art Museum in the southern city of Craiova where the sculpture
lives, said Gheorghe Barbarasa, a city counselor,on Monday.
	   Despite the compensation, the curator of the Craiova museum is
accused of negligence and the culture minister has asked for his
resignation. A final decision will be taken in one month, after
further investigations.
	   Speaking by telephone from the museum, some 200 kilometers (125
miles) west of Bucharest, the curator Paul Rezeanu accused one
culture ministry official of harboring a personal grudge against
him.
	   ``I did not break The Kiss,'' said Rezeanu, denying he carried
the 50 kilogram (110 pounds) work in his luggage as has been
suggested. A one-inch piece (2.5 centimeters) broke off and lost.
	   Rezeanu said the Cobra Museum in Amsterdam, where the exhibition
was housed, admitted the sculpture was chipped while it was in its
care, which is why the insurance money was forthcoming.
	   He dismissed media speculation said the sculpture was replaced
with a forgery. Tests showed that the original returned in Romania,
he said.
	   ``The Kiss'' is still damaged, as restorers decide how and if to
repair it. It was created in Paris, adopted home of Romanian
sculptor, one of this century's greatest artists.

German jobless seen rising again after election
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Unemployment in Germany will probably dip
below 4 million in the fall but will rise again in the winter, the
government's top labor market official was quoted Monday as saying.
	   The comments were less optimistic than recent statements by
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who is citing improving jobless data in his
troubled campaign for a fifth term in Sept. 27 elections.
	   ``It's an illusion to try to reach bearable unemployment figures
in the short term,'' Bernhard Jagoda, head of the Federal Labor
Office, said in an interview with the daily newspaper Die Welt.
	   ``I expect that we will briefly go below the 4 million mark in
the fall, before unemployment starts rising again for seasonal
reasons'' in the winter, Jagoda said.
	   He said he expects average monthly unemployment of nearly 4.3
million this year.
	   Next year's average could drop below 4 million, he said.
	   Some 4.13 million Germans _ 10.7 percent of the workforce _ were
jobless in July. August data are to be announced next week.

Russians buying more, but banks, stores remain calm
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Long lines stretched from bank counters Monday,
but customers were being allowed to take out their money and stayed
calm in the face of Russia's financial crisis.
	   At a MOST-Bank branch in Moscow, about 30 people quietly waited
for their turn in line, but didn't seem afraid that they might lose
their savings.
	   ``I'll probably be here until evening,'' grumbled 65-year-old
pensioner Olga Makarova, who has two separate bank accounts at
MOST-Bank, in rubles and in dollars. ``But people are getting their
money, even if it is slowly.''
	   Makarova was eager to get her money out, but remained
philosophical. ``We've been afraid for our lives so often that I've
got no fear left,'' she said.
	   That attitude seemed prevalent, with people wary about the
economy but not panicking.
	   Trading on Russia's stock market was almost nonexistent. Traders
were waiting to see whether the lower house of parliament would
approve Victor Chernomyrdin for the post of prime minister.
	   The ruble even gained strength at street exchange points,
selling at around nine to the dollar _ down from more than 12
rubles at the end of last week and nearer the Central Bank's set
exchange rate of 7.86.
	   Still, in some shops, prices for both Russian and import goods
were up in reaction to the ruble's tumble last week, and shop
owners reported occasional instances of hoarding.
	   ``All our prices have gone up about 25 percent,'' said Lidiya
Berukova, while she supervised the arrival of Russian-made sausage
and cheese at her small supermarket. ``Last week people bought
everything up because they knew that goods were going to be more
costly.''
	   But in others, shop owners reported little change in buying
patterns.
	   ``People don't know what's going to happen in a week,'' said
26-year-old clerk Mikhail Taraskin during a slow morning at a
convenience store. ``I think people are actually waiting for prices
to go down again.''

Train rams into bus in western India, 30 killed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ A high speed train rammed a passenger
bus Monday at a railroad crossing in western India, killing 30
people and injuring five more, a domestic news agency reported.
	   There was no railroad employee or signal at the crossing to warn
the bus driver of the speeding train near the Mavli station in the
desert state of Rajasthan, Press Trust of India said.
	   Mavli is 525 kilometers (325 miles) southwest of New Delhi.
	   Railroad accidents occur frequently in India, which has the
largest rail network under one management in the world. Newspapers
report almost daily about trains derailing, running into vehicles
or animals, or plowing into other trains. So frequent are the
accidents that only those involving many deaths make the front
page.
	   More than 12 million people every day ride 14,000 trains across
India's network of 67,000 kilometers (41,875 miles) of track.

<TEXT>
	   CRATHIE, Scotland (AP) _ A year after Princess Diana's death,
thousands of people commemorated one of the most public lives of
modern times Monday, while those who knew her best marked the
anniversary of a very private grief in the seclusion of their
Scottish castle.
	   Diana's sons, Prince William, 16, and Prince Harry, 13, prayed
for their mother with the rest of the royal family at Crathie
church near Balmoral Castle, the royal estate, where their father
woke them last Aug. 31 to tell them of their mother's fatal car
crash.
	   In London, the pile of flowers at the gates of the princess'
former home at Kensington Palace grew to about a thousand bouquets
Monday morning. Messages in many languages, photographs taken from
newspapers, and paper hearts adorned the black and gold palace
gates.
	   Scores of well-wishers held an all-night candle-lit vigil, and
public memorial services were planned at the city's great
cathedrals. The national flag, the Union Jack, flew at half staff
on government buildings and royal residences, as an official symbol
of the personal and public remembrance of Diana.
	   For Diana's family it was a day for quiet reflection.
	   At Althorp, 75 miles (120 kms) north of London, away from the
public gaze, Diana's brother, Earl Spencer and her sisters, Lady
Sarah McCorquodale and Lady Jane Fellowes, were holding a service
near her burial site on an island in an ornamental lake.
	   Balmoral, Queen Victoria's ``dear paradise'' of mountains,
moorlands, forests and salmon streams, has been a vacation retreat
for the royal family since 1855 and they visit off and on during
the year, particularly in late summer.
	   But they came together en masse, with spouses and children, to
be present for the anniversary of Diana's death. Prime Minister
Tony Blair and his wife, Cherie, who were at Balmoral for the
annual prime ministerial weekend, also attended the family prayers
Monday morning.
	   William, Harry, Prince Charles and his brothers and sister,
Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, and the Queen Mother, went to
the prayer service at the tiny stone church of Crathie parish, just
outside the castle's gates and across the rushing waters of the
River Dee.
	   When the royal party left for church, there were only about 20
spectators at the castle and half a dozen bouquets against the
wall.
	   ``I feel disappointed for the royal family that more people
aren't here.,'' said Tim Bunday, 31, who was on vacation from
southern England and brought his 2-year-old son, Toby, to see the
royals. ``Maybe people think it's more respectful not to be here
today.''
	   The royal family thanked the nation for the many messages of
sympathy they had received.
	   ``The queen and the royal family, particularly the Prince of
Wales, Prince William and Prince Harry, would like to thank people
for their messages and kind gestures of sympathy at this sad time
and for sharing their remembrance of the Princess of Wales,'' said
a royal statement.
	   At St. James's Palace, Diana's former employees and other
members of the royal household were expected to attend a service of
remembrance in the chapel where the princess's coffin rested before
her funeral.
	   A granite and bronze sculpture of Diana and Dodi Fayed, the
lover with whom she died, was unveiled Monday at Harrods, the
London store owned by Fayed's father, Mohamed Al Fayed. Al Fayed
was attending a memorial service for his son near near his burial
place outside London.
	   Commemorations seemed modest, reflecting recent opinion polls
indicating many Britons found last year's mourning excessive.
	   The Daily Telegraph on Friday published the results of a
telephone survey by Gallup which found that 94 percent of those
questioned said they had no plans to mark the anniversary. While 28
percent wanted the day to be an occasion for national remembrance,
69 percent thought it should be left for individuals to mark as
they choose.
	   The survey of 1,009 people had a margin of error of three
percentage points.
	   Rosa Monckton, a close friend of Diana's said MOnday morning
that the princess would be appalled at the cult that has grown up
around her since her death.
	   ``This whole Diana industry, which is so sordid, should stop and
she should rest in peace,'' Monckton told BBC Radio.

 &UR; By HRVOJE HRANJSKI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GOMA, Congo (AP) _ From the capital, Kinshasa, government
victory may seem at hand. But from rebel-held eastern Congo,
insurgents plotting their next move say time is on their side.
	   ``The war is going on,'' rebel leader Ernest Wamba dia Wamba
told The Associated Press.
	   ``The government forces would've been by now completely out if
were not for the Angolans and Zimbabweans,'' troops sent in to
fight alongside those of President Laurent Kabila, Wamba said
Sunday.
	   ``But they cannot stay long. And we're going to continue
fighting no matter what.''
	   On Sunday, the rebels suffered a major defeat in a month-old
campaign to topple Kabila when they pulled out of Matadi, 350
kilometers (210 miles) southwest of Kinshasa _ the only remaining
air base in western Congo under their control.
	   Wamba said the rebel force in western Congo _ believed to number
between 6,000 and 9,000 troops _ had to withdraw to avoid being cut
in half by Angolan troops.
	   The result will be change in tactics: the rebels will split into
smaller, mobile groups ready to strike Kinshasa at times,
infiltrate the city and lie low until the departure of Kabila's
allies, he said.
	   ``It's a matter of what kind of war,'' the 56-year-old former
Harvard political economy lecturer said. ``It is my understanding
that now, we are conducting the guerrilla-type war.''
	   ``Nobody can rule effectively only with foreign support,'' he
said. ``Zimbabwe cannot stay for a long time. Angola may not stay
for longer either. They have too many fronts open against them:
they have to be in Congo-Brazzaville, they have to deal with
(separatists) in Cabinda, they have to deal with Congo-Kinshasa,
and they are only 11 million people.''
	   Since the rebels _ a coalition of ethnic Tutsis, exiled
politicians and disenchanted members of Kabila's army _ took up
arms a month ago, they seized eastern Congo and closed in on
Kinshasa from the Atlantic Ocean, where they had airlifted
thousands of troops and equipment.
	   But the intervention of Angola and Zimbabwe appeared to have
warded off rebel advances at Kinshasa and saved Kabila _ at least
for time being.
	   The result could be a long and exhausting war.
	   ``We are trying to tell our people that this may not be a few
weeks' affair. It could be months, it could be years. The more
people get that sense that this is a worthwhile struggle, the
people will continue struggling,'' he said.
	   The rebels still control a string of towns in eastern Congo,
including the third-largest city of Kisangani from where supplies
can be ferried on the Congo River to rebels around Kinshasa, and
were reportedly advancing on the southern fronts.
	   The rebels accuse Kabila of power-grabbing, nepotism and
promoting his kinsmen from southern Katanga province in the
government, security services and the army.
	   ``Fundamentally, this is a problem of how power is being
misused,'' Wamba said. ``We need responsible leadership if we want
to have stability in Congo and regionally.''
	   Kabila accuses his erstwhile allies in Rwanda and Uganda of
sponsoring the rebellion and invading the country. Both countries
have threatened to intervene openly to protect their borders.
	   But rebel commander Jean-Pierre Ondekane said Monday that the
countries backing the rebels had yet to intervene in the war. He
warned they would do so if the war continues.
	   ``We have countries backing us too and they will come,''
Ondekane said during a visit to the eastern city of Bukavu in an
effort to rally the troops. ``If the negotiations fail, they will
enter into the war.''
	   Wamba said Rwanda and Uganda had hopes that with Kabila's rise
to power, peace and stability would resurface in eastern Congo.
	   ``The hope of the region was that with Kabila, security and
peace of the area will be established. But they are not there.''
	   Financing the war may not be so easy.
	   Wamba said the rebels controlled gold mines around Kisangani and
were collecting custums taxes to bankroll the rebellion as well as
negotiating international loans. He did not elaborate.
	   ``It is possible, if we organize ourselves very well, to
generate money which would have us sustain costs in a long (term)
way,'' he said.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Kazakstan's foreign debt has reached almost dlrs 2
billion, but the former Soviet republic continues to pay its
obligations on time, a news report said Monday.
	   Foreign debt in the central Asian nation reached dlrs 1.9
billion by Aug. 1, and now totals 65 percent of the country's
overall debt, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Major creditors to Kazakstan include the World Bank, the Asian
Development Bank, and Japan.
	   Kazakstan's Finance Ministry said the country continues to pay
off its foreign debt ``in strict accordance'' with credit
agreements, Interfax said.
	   Kazakstan has made repeated promises to foreign investors that
it will not follow Russia into economic crisis because its total
debts add up to 9 percent of its budget compared to 35 percent for
Russia.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ When Boris Yeltsin last welcomed U.S. President
Bill Clinton to Moscow, the Russian president was nearing the end
of a desperate race for re-election. This time, he's fighting a
no-less-desperate battle to rescue his country from economic ruin
and his reputation from deeper disrepute.
	   In April 1996, Clinton gave his friend a boost by supporting his
plan to end the Chechen war and praising his economic reform
efforts.
	   This time as well, Yeltsin will be looking for a boost. He's
hoping the photo opportunities with Clinton, who leaves Monday for
Moscow, will buff his credentials as a member of the elite club of
world leaders _ what many see as his last political straw.

	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ A powerful bomb exploded near a popular
marketplace in Algiers on Monday, killing at least 10 people and
injuring 15 others, authorities said.
	   The explosion occurred early Monday in Bab-el-Oued, a

	   The explosion ripped through a packed square, sending people
running through the streets in panic.
	   Ambulances rushed to the scene, and police cordoned off the

were still ferrying people to hospital.
	   There was no immediate claim of responsibility.
	   Earlier Monday, the government said it would open offices
nationwide to help investigate the disappearance of Algerians
during the country's violent six-year insurgency.
	   Some 48 offices will be opened across the country on Sept 1, and
authorities are inviting relatives of missing people to leave
dossiers of their loved ones to aid investigations.
	   Human rights groups, citing witness accounts, have suggested
that Algeria's army had a role in some of the thousands of reported
disappearances in the past six years. An estimated 75,000 people,
including Islamic militants, civilians and security forces, have
been killed since 1992.
	   Human rights groups have asked authorities to take concrete
steps to investigate the disappearances.
	   Authorities said the opening of the offices coincided with 554
new cases of missing people being lodged with the Interior
Ministry.
	   In June, Interior Minister Mustapha Benmansour dismissed a
report sent to Algeria's parliament by Louiza Hanoune, the
president of the leftist Workers Party.
	   The report cited a list of several hundred people who had gone
missing, but Benmansour said the report was ``a fabrication.''
	   Although many of the disappeared are feared dead, Algeria's
government-run National Observatory for Human Rights says some may
have secretly fled the country, or joined the insurgents.
	   Algeria's insurgency began after the army canceled legislative
elections the now-banned Islamic Salvation Front was poised to win.

Police to file embezzlement charges over dam compensation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Police said Monday they plan to file
embezzlement charges against officials and activists accused of
pocketing money from a fund set up to compensate farmers affected
by dam construction in northeastern Thailand.
	   A former science minister has already been charged in the
controversial case, which critics say is politically motivated.
	   Police are seeking warrants from the interior ministry to arrest
10 more people accused by some villagers of stealing the money from
the fund, an assistant to Police Lt. Gen. Seri Temiyavej, commander
of the Central Investigation Bureau, said Monday.
	   They include three activists from the Assembly of the Poor, an
umbrella group for activist organizations representing mostly
peasant farmers.
	   A spokesman for the Assembly of the Poor said the group was
considering filing defamation suits against the police and a local
newspaper, Matichon, which reported the names of the accused.
	   The money was allegedly diverted from a 363-million-baht fund
(dlrs 8.6 million) set up last year for farmers whose land was
inundated after the construction of the Rasi Salai Dam in Si Sa Ket
province in 1992.
	   Prasithiporn Kanonsri, an adviser to the Assembly of the Poor,
said Monday the police allegations were groundless and motivated by
politics.
	   He said there are three groups of villagers who did not get
compensation because they could not provide adequate documentation
to prove their loss.
	   These groups are backed by local politicians of parties which
are rivals to the accused former deputy science minister, Adisorn
Piangket of the New Aspiration Party, said Prasithiporn.
	   ``It is all about profits and politics. Those other groups don't
get compensation. So they turned around to attack us,'' he said.
The Assembly of the Poor is only group entitled to the compensation
fund, he said.
	   The Assembly of the Poor claims the fund has already been
distributed to 1,150 families since late last year.
	   The Assembly of the Poor negotiated the deal with the government
of former Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh after a lengthy
sit-in protest outside parliament. Chavalit is head of the New
Aspiration Party and now leader of the opposition.
	   Former deputy science minister Adisorn has already filed a
defamation suit against Lt. Gen. Seri Temiyavej.

Mir cosmonauts prepare for redocking of cargo spacecraft
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Cosmonauts on Russia's Mir space station prepared
Monday to redock a cargo ship that was detached to make space for a
crew change, a news report said.
	   The Progress M-39 cargo craft has been kept a short distance
from the station since flight commander Sergei Avdeyev and engineer
Gennady Padalka arrived on Mir in the middle of August, the
ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   The pair of cosmonauts will gradually lower the cargo craft's
orbit so it can catch up with the Mir before docking on Tuesday
morning.
	   The Progress, which contains waste material, serves as an
``umbrella'' for part of the Mir when attached to the station,
protecting the docking assembly from the sun.

Rioters rampage in Indonesian town after troops pull out
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with soldiers firing tear gas, warning shots;

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Soldiers fired warning shots in the
air and tear gas at thousands of rioters who roamed a northern town
on Monday, hurling stones at shops and burning a hotel, a ruling
party office and other buildings.
	   It was the biggest riot in Indonesia since mid-May, when deadly
unrest swept the capital of Jakarta and other cities and helped
oust former President Suharto. There were no immediate reports of
arrests or injuries.
	   The unrest in the town of Lhokseumawe erupted after more than
600 soldiers left Aceh province in a conciliatory gesture by the
military, which is accused of atrocities there.
	   But bitterness spilled over when the troops pulled out in trucks
after lining up in a field during a ceremony. Some spectators
pelted the vehicles with stones, shouting insults such as ``pigs''
and ``dogs.''
	   The mob then attacked shops and other buildings, many of them
owned by members of the ethnic Chinese minority. The Chinese,
resented partly because they dominate business, are often targeted
in times of tension.
	   A witness in Lhokseumawe said by telephone that teen-agers in
school uniforms torched the office of the ruling Golkar party,
which has lost credibility because of its role in buttressing
Suharto's autocratic rule for decades.
	   ``Many windows were broken, while heaps of debris and stones
were scattered along the streets,'' another witness, Sugito, said
by telephone.
	   ``Smoke billowed into the sky after people burned a hotel,'' he
said.
	   Mobs blocked fire trucks that tried to reach the hotel, a fire
brigade official said.
	   After a period of relative calm, there were scattered riots
around Indonesia over the past week. Looters rampaged through a
fishing town and on Monday, police on Lombok fought rioters who
were protesting against a newly elected governor.
	   There are fears that Indonesia's economic crisis and the strain
on millions of poor people could lead to bigger riots.
	   The violence in Aceh may slow a policy of armed forces chief
Gen. Wiranto to withdraw troops from provinces where the military
has fought separatist rebels. Irian Jaya and the former Portuguese
colony of East Timor also harbor independence movements.
	   Military officials have said they must maintain security in
those regions, even if it requires more soldiers.
	   The departure Monday of 664 troops wrapped up a partial
withdrawal from Aceh, where government investigators have unearthed
bones of victims allegedly killed by the military and dumped into
mass graves.
	   Earlier this month, Wiranto apologized for wrongdoing during a
military campaign against Islamic separatist rebels in the late
1980s and early 1990s.
	   Wiranto also withdrew 250 soldiers from Aceh on Aug. 20. In the
wake of the downfall of Suharto, successor B.J. Habibie has pledged
democratic reforms and greater accountability.
	   Lt. Col. Agus Ramadhan said 2,000 troops remain in Aceh, which
is 2,000 kilometers (1,250 miles) northwest of Jakarta.

	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright on Monday strongly rebuffed lingering Serb and
Croat sentiment to partition Bosnia. ``There will be no revision of
the Dayton Accords,'' she said.
	   Also, Albright said after talks with Muslim and Croat leaders, a
just peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina requires that the capital be an
open city, hospitable to all ethnic groups.
	   Overall, Albright and her advisors are pleased with what they
have seen in a two-day trip to Croatia and Bosnia. Refugees are
returning in the aftermath of a bloody conflict that ended nearly
three years ago, and with U.S. and other assistance, there is
rebuilding of homes and of industries.
	   The German manufacturer, Volkswagen, formally resumes auto
production Monday in Sarajevo, the only major prewar industry, and
German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel is visiting to mark the
occasion.

Iraqi vice president leaves for NAM summit in South Africa
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan left
Monday for a two-day visit to Sudan en route to the Non-Aligned
Movement's summit in South Africa.
	   The official Iraqi News Agency quoted Ramadan as saying that in
Sudan, he would discuss ``cooperation and coordination in the face
of schemes and aggression enacted by ... the Americans and
Zionists.''
	   It was a reference to the Aug. 20 U.S. missile attack on a
factory in the Sudanese capital Khartoum. The United States says
the factory was involved in the production of chemical weapons, but
the Sudanese insist it made only medicines.
	   Ramadan was expected to meet with Sudan's president, Lt. Gen.
Omar el-Bashir, INA said.
	   Iraq's foreign minister, Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf, already is in
Durban, South Africa, participating in preliminary NAM meetings.
The two-day summit starts Wednesday.
	   Ramadan was quoted as saying he would update the summit on
Iraq's latest standoff with the United Nations.
	   Iraq announced on Aug. 5 that it no longer would cooperate with
U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   The inspectors must certify that Iraq has eliminated its weapons
of mass destruction before punishing trade sanctions, imposed after
Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, can be lifted.

Father: Septuplets could stay in hospital until they're 1
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By FAIZA SALEH AMBAH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ Seven-month-old Saudi
septuplets could remain in hospital until they're a year old and
the family is better able to care for them, their father said
Monday.
	   The situation of the four boys and three girls, who were born
Jan. 14, is far different from that of the world's other set of
surviving septuplets, born last November to Kenny and Bobbi
McCaughey of Carlisle, Iowa.
	   The McCaugheys had as many as 60 volunteers working in shifts at
their home to help feed and care for their babies.
	   But the parents of the Saudi septuplets _ Hasna Mohammad Humair
and Abdullah Mohammad Ali al-Summan _ have had to rely on the staff
of the government hospital in the southern Saudi city of Abha and
two recently hired Malaysian nannies.
	   ``I heard that the hospital wouldn't mind for the babies to stay
there until they reach 1, and it's an option we're considering,''
al-Summan told The Associated Press in a telephone interview from
Abha.
	   Officials at the Abha hospital previously said the children
could stay until their parents were able to take them home.
	   But the children's mother, Humair, who visits the hospital twice
a day to feed the babies, would like to take them home sooner
rather than later.
	   ``I miss them very much and would like them home soon,'' she
said.
	   She worried that the cots at the hospital ``are getting too
tight for them,'' especially with the girls starting to crawl and
the boys starting to roll over on their own.
	   On their hospital trips, she and her husband take diapers,
clothes, baby food, biscuits, juice and bananas.
	   ``We also took blankets because it gets cold sometimes and the
nursery's covers are too small for them,'' al-Summan said.
	   Al-Summan believes the children are getting better care at the
hospital than they could get at home.
	   ``At the hospital they are being monitored daily by doctors and
nurses,'' he said. ``We can't give them the same care here at
home.''
	   He also said his wife was still weak from the caesarean
delivery, her second. They couple already has five other children
at home.
	   Al-Summan described the babies as a handful, even with the
nannies.
	   ``One has to be fed, another needs to be changed, one is crying
and the other four need the same constant attention and
supervision,'' he said. ``It's mayhem!''

Communists say they will block confirmation of Russian premier
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Chernomyrdin addressing Duma &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos &QL; 
 &UR; By BARRY RENFREW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Communist opposition said Monday it would
block the approval of a new prime minister following the collapse
of a proposed truce with Boris Yeltsin, despite Russia's growing
economic crisis.
	   Acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin warned Russia was on
the edge of chaos and pleaded with the State Duma to approve the
formation of a government to tackle the crisis.
	   ``Russia is on the verge of political and economic collapse,''
he told the lower chamber of parliament at the start of his
confirmation hearings. He said not another hour could be wasted on
political bickering.
	   ``We can only come out of the crisis by uniting our efforts,''
he added.
	   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov said his party and other
hard-line groups would vote against confirming Chernomyrdin because
the government had not made enough concessions on reducing
Yeltsin's powers.
	   Yeltsin said he would nominate Chernomyrdin again if the Duma
votes against the premier, aides said.
	   Both sides warned that popular discontent could explode if the
crisis continues. ``If we fail to reach an agreement here
everything will spill out to the streets,'' Zyuganov said.
	   Yeltsin's parliamentary envoy Alexander Kotenkov warned the
opposition that both sides could be swept aside if there is no
swift action to end the crisis.
	   ``If this chaos lasts for several more weeks, it may happen that
there will be neither Communists nor us,'' he said. ``I mean a
popular uprising, merciless and senseless.''
	   Some Communist leaders said they were not afraid of government
threats to dissolve the legislature because they were confident of
winning the elections that would follow.
	   The government insisted it remained in control and that work on
tackling the country's economic crisis was going ahead. ``It is
business as usual for government headquarters,'' said government
spokesman Igor Shabdurasulov.
	   Despite saying the opposition would vote against Chernomyrdin's
appointment Monday, Zyuganov indicated he was ready for more
negotiations, signaling a deal was still possible.
	   ``There's no guarantee that full agreement will be reached
today. We're ready to take another look at it today,'' he told
reporters.
	   Chernomyrdin met with several leftist factions Monday behind
closed doors, attempting to salvage the truce. He also met with
Yeltsin, who was at work Monday in the Kremlin, according to
officials.
	   There was no sign of panic in Moscow and other cities Monday.
The Russian currency staged a mild recovery after last week's sharp
falls.
	   Chernomyrdin told the Duma the government would take urgent
steps to prop up banks, protect individuals' accounts. He also
called for a program to prop up the ruble, lower taxes and revive
the industrial sector, but gave no details.
	   Government and opposition leaders reached tentative agreement
Sunday on a pact under which parliament would approve the new
government and give it a chance to solve the economic crisis. In
return, Yeltsin was to give parliament a bigger role in approving
the Cabinet.
	   But the Communists rejected the deal Sunday evening. Zyuganov
said his party's leadership could not support the pact because
there was no firm guarantee Yeltsin would abide by its provisions.
	   The Kremlin said Monday that Yeltsin would not accept the truce
until the opposition accepted it.
	   The breakdown appeared likely to usher in a period of political
head-butting similar to the one that surrounded the nomination of
the previous prime minister, Sergei Kiriyenko, last spring. The
Communists want maximum concessions from the government and don't
want to anger their supporters by appearing to give in too easily.
	   Under the constitution, the Duma can vote three times on a prime
minister's nomination.
	   In the case of Kiriyenko, the Communist-led Duma twice voted no,
then caved in on the third vote after trying to wrest concessions
from the government.
	   The nationalist Liberal Democratic Party joined the Communists
in vowing not to sign the deal, as did the social democratic
Yabloko party. Yabloko leaders had said from the start that they
wouldn't support Chernomyrdin's nomination.
	   The political stalemate couldn't come at a worse time for the
Russian government, which is trying to stabilize an economy that
has been seriously damaged by the devaluation of the national
currency, the ruble, and the government's default on its debts.
	   Chernomyrdin said swift formation of a new government was vital
to tackle the crisis.
	   ``We must resolve financial problems. The ruble is hanging by a
thread,'' he said. ``So if we have a political agreement and the
president accepts it _ let's start working.''
	   The proposed three-page agreement would have given the Duma more
say in Cabinet appointments but left Yeltsin with substantial
power, despite earlier opposition calls for his removal.

stakes in an already volatile corner of Asia.

officials based here, said the missile was probably aimed at waters
between Russia and Japan and landed about 300 kilometers (190
miles) southeast of Vladivostok, Russia.
	   But Japan's state-run TV network, NHK, said there were
unconfirmed reports that that might have been only where the first
stage of the missile hit and that the second stage passed over
Japan and landed in the Pacific Ocean.
	   The launch just after noon (0300 GMT) was confirmed by Japanese,
South Korean and United States defense officials.
	   The missile was ``confirmed to be a brand-new `Daepodong I' with
a range of 2,000 kilometers (1,240 miles),'' the South Korean
Defense Ministry said in a statement.
	   That range is twice as long as the North's previous staple
``Rodong'' series missiles.
	   Japanese Coast Guard patrol boats airplanes were immediately
dispatched to the area where the missile hit. But it was unclear
whether they could actually go to the site _ which was believed to
be close to or possibly inside Russian waters.
	   ``We see this as a very dangerous act,'' said chief government
spokesman Hiromu Nonaka. He said Japan would express its concern to
the North through diplomatic channels.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, visiting Sarajevo,
told reporters she was also alarmed by the test launch.
	   ``This is something that we will be raising with North Koreans
in the talks that are currently going on,'' she said.
	   Those talks, in New York, are over a proposal for the North to
suspend missile development in exchange for nuclear energy
know-how, and some Korea watchers said they suspect the launch was
timed to up the stakes.
	   ``Kim is good at brinksmanship,'' said Hajime Izumi, a noted
North Korea watcher and professor at Shizuoka University, referring
to North Korea's leader Kim Jong Il.
	   ``This shows that North Korea can make effective missiles,'' he
added. ``What remains to be seen is if they can mass produce them,
or deploy them.''
	   Masahiro Akiyama, deputy director of Japan's Defense Agency,
said the launch was not totally a surprise _ security experts, he
said, had been increasing their surveillance of the North since
earlier this month.
	   Stalinist North Korea, which over the past few years has been
foundering under devastating famines, is to convene its newly
elected parliament on Sept. 5, and are expected to elect Kim as the
country's president.
	   In June, North Korea also admitted for the first time that it
has sold missiles abroad. It had long been suspected of selling
missiles to Iran and Syria.
	   But very little is known about North Korea's missile program,
and its possession of a significantly better missile would be a
matter of serious concern throughout the region.
	   North Korea's best-known ballistic missile is the Rodong, which
has a range of about 1,000 kilometers (620 miles). It was last test
fired in 1993, and also landed in the same area of the Sea of
Japan, which divides the Korean Peninsula from Japan.
	   With its 1,000 kilometer (620-mile range), the Rodong I missile,
a modified Scud, could strike South Korea and much of Japan. The
newer missile would put even more of Japan within range.
	   In 1996, the United States began talks with North Korea aimed at
persuading the secretive Communist country to freeze its missile
program and to join an international agreement designed to restrict
missile proliferation. The talks stalled.
	   Japan is currently boosting its budget for joint development of
a missile defense system with the United States, and has reportedly
earmarked 500 million yen (dlrs 3.6 million) for the project next
year.
	   The United States has 37,000 troops stationed in South Korea,
many of them based near its border with North Korea. It has roughly
another 50,000 troops in Japan.
	   Monday's was the secretive North's fourth test-firing of a
missile since 1984 and its first in five years.

<TEXT>
	   PERTH, Australia (AP) _ Irish President Mary McAleese arrived
Monday to begin an 11-day visit to Australia, her first official
overseas visit since her election in November.
	   The president, who is accompanied by her husband Dr. Martin

	   ``Western Australia's Irish connections go back to the days of
the first British settlement, so I am sure President McAleese will
be given a warm welcome,'' Court said in a statement.
	   ``Irish immigrants and their descendants have had a profound
influence on the development of the state, particularly in
education, medicine and law,'' he said.
	   McAleese, who has a background as an academic at Trinity
College, Dublin, and as a presenter on Irish National Television,
will also visit the Irish Club on Monday night.

Italian Communist leader rebuffs Prodi
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Pressing for more action against unemployment, the
leader of the Italian Communists on Monday rebuffed Premier Romano
Prodi's challenge to close ranks with the government.
	   Fausto Bertinotti's hardline Communist Refoundation party is
outside the government but gives Prodi's center-left coalition a
majority in the Chamber of Deputies. However, more and more the
Communists have been insisting Prodi much do more to improve the
job picture or they might yank support.
	   A battle looms over cuts and expenditures for the 1999 budget,
which will start to be under discussion in late September.
	   Prodi, insisting in remarks to reporters Sunday night that the
country needs ``stability and clarity,'' declared that he intended
to continue to govern for the remainder of Parliament's term, which
runs out in 2001, and pressed the Communists for a pledge of
support.
	   ``I have asked Communist Refoundation to say what it wants to do
because the country cannot live in uncertainty,'' Prodi said.
	   But Bertinotti, in an interview Monday with RAI state TV, threw
the ball back to the premier.
	   ``Either there's an about-face or it's the end of the
coalition,'' Bertinotti said. Among other demands by the Communists
are more investment for the depressed south and implementation of a
35-hour week.
	   In June, the Communists nearly caused the government to fall by
refusing to vote for NATO's eastward expansion.
	   Prodi's government already has lasted longer than all but two of
the other 54 Italian governments since World War II.

An Feng appoints China Development Corp. chairman to board
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PERTH, Australia (AP) _ An Feng Kingstream Steel has appointed
China Development Corp.'s chairman Dr. Tai-Ying Liu as a director
of the company.
	   Liu is also chairman of the business management committee of
Taiwan's ruling Kuomintang party and in that capacity has
responsibility for Central Investment Holding Co, the government's
investment arm.
	   He will also become a director and chairman of the company's
92.3 percent owned subsidiary An Feng Steel Co.
	   The appointment follows news 10 days ago that An Feng's largest
shareholder An-Hsiung Chu was negotiating to sell a substantial
part of his holding in the company to Central Investment Holding
Co.
	   An Feng's deputy chairman Ken Court said at the time that the
intended move of Liu onto the board effectively meant the
investment group had locked into the deal.
	   The market has speculated that a move by the Taiwanese
government, which reportedly has plentiful cash reserves, to
increase its holding in the company would help square up finance
for the proposed steel mill north of Perth.
	   Further siteworks at the plant have been delayed pending the
refinancing of debt associated with An Feng's Taiwanese businesses.
	   The finance and construction deal for the project is being
arranged by trading house Mitsui and Co., which has reportedly
refused to sign the final contract until the next stage of site
works at Oakajee is completed.
	   Liu said Monday he was optimistic on the long-term outlook for
the steel industry and looked forward to the on-going development
of the AFK group, in particular to the Mid-West iron and steel
project.
	   ``The proposed 2.6 million tons per annum integrated steel slab
facility would bring excellent long-term benefits to the AFK group
and Taiwan,'' Liu said.
	   ``On completion of the steel slab facility, the group would be a
fully integrated steel business, commencing with the mining of iron
ore through to the production of pellets, direct reduced iron,
steel slab, hot-rolled steel coil, cold-rolled steel coil,
galvanized coil and color coated coil.''
	   He added that the ``key factor'' -- that the delivered cost of
the steel slab would be at least 30 percent less than that of China
Steel Ltd., which had to purchase and ship the raw material from
overseas, meant that the ``highly attractive'' economic
fundamentals of the project would underwrite its development.

Muralitharan bowls Sri Lanka close to victory
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Off-spinner Muttiah Muralitharan bowled Sri Lanka
close to a famous victory over England in the one-off test at the
Oval Monday.
	   Muralitharan, who had earlier removed opener Steve James in the
11th over of the morning, bowled John Crawley at the stroke of
lunch to leave the home teetering on 116 for five.
	   Muralitharan, alternating ends for his three spells on the final
morning, beat Crawley through the air and bowled him between bat
and pad to end a brief but frustrating 53-minute stand with Mark
Ramprakash, 16 not out at the break.
	   England, traling by 146 runs and facing its first home defeat at
the hands of Sri Lanka, needs a further 30 runs to avoid the
embarrassment of losing by an innings.
	   In reply to England's 445, Sri Lanka, scored 591 on the fourth
day.
	   England, resuming the day on 54 for two, lost James in the 11th
over of the morning to off spinner Muttiah Muralitharan.
	   Muralitharan, who took 7-155 in England's first innings, had
James (27), caught pad/bat at silly point by Mahela Jayawardene, to
add to his fourth day scalps of Mark Butcher and Graeme Hick.
	   James and Stewart ground out 219 balls between them in four
minutes over two hours after coming together at 25 for two.
	   James' dismissal reduced England to 78 for three in the first
hour. The right hander, playing only his second test, struggled for
over three hours for his 27
	   But the prized wicket of Stewart didn't come until seven over
later. Stewart, dropping eight runs earlier, was too slow in
responding to Mark Ramprakash's call for a single and was brilliant
run out substitute fielder Upul Chandana.
	   Chandana, fielding for the injured de Silva, threw down the
stumps at the striker's end from square leg, catching Stewart short
of his ground.
	   Ramprakash and first innings centurian John Crawley, defied the
Sri Lanka, batting till lunch.
	   If Sri Lanka manages to win the test, it will be only its fourth
win overseas in 86 tests.
	   Muralitharan, 4-46, extended his match-bag to 11-201, and the
career tally to 198 wickets in his 42nd test.

Law firm Aroni Colman shuts after murder/fraud case
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ The commercial law firm Aroni Colman
announced Monday it will close down after former partner Max Green
defrauded up to 40 million Australian dollars (23.2 million U.S.
dlrs) before being murdered in Cambodia earlier this year.
	   Aroni Colman said the aftermath of the massive losses left the
Melbourne firm's finances and energies ``unacceptably vulnerable.''
with staff and their families ``suffering greatly.''
	   Former partner Max Green, 46, was beaten to death in March in
his room at a hotel in the Cambodian capital, Phnom Penh, and it
was then discovered he had set up a series of scams involving up to
40 million Australian dollars (23.2 million U.S. dlrs) in sham
investments.
	   The statement said Aroni Colman would be wound up and was
expected to close Sept. 30.
	   Aroni Colman's statement said both its compulsory insurer, the
Legal Practitioners' Liability Committee, and the AMP firm, had
denied any liability for the losses caused by Green.
	   ``The Fidelity Fund had contingent liabilities of more than 20
million Australian dollars (11.6 million U.S. dlrs) before Max
Green died. It may be years before we learn what, if anything, we
can recover from that fund for what Max Green stole.''

Serb women stone US building to protest allegations of mass murder;
</HEADLINE>
Yugoslavia refuses visa to senior US official &QL; 
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ About 200 angry Serb women pelted
the U.S. information office with stones Monday to protest the
killing of Serb civilians, allegedly by Albanian rebels fighting
for independence of Kosovo province.
	   President Clinton's special envoy on war crimes issues told
reporters Monday in the Croation capital Zagreb that the Yugoslav
government refused to let him visit the country to investigate
alleged abuses in Kosovo, including ``alleged criminal conduct'' by
Albanian rebels and Serb security forces.
	   The envoy, David Scheffer, said Belgrade's refusal to grant him
a visa ``indicates once again that government's insecurity about
its own accountability under international laws.''
	   Allegations of abuse by both Serb forces and Albanian guerrillas
escalated over the weekend after Serbian police said they had
discovered a crematory in the village of Klecka, where ethnic
Albanians allegedly had burned the bodies of at least 22 Serbs,
including women and children.
	   The rebel Kosovo Liberation Army has denied any role in the
killings.
	   On Monday, about 200 Serb women marched to the U.S. Information
Service in Pristina and demanded that an American official come
speak to the. When no one responded, the women shouted ``fascists''
and ``murderers'' and began hurling stones at the building.
	   ``This is Serbia,'' shouted one of the women. ``Look at them,
high and mighty democrats! They can't come out and talk to us. They
only want to talk to (ethnic) Albanian politicians!''
	   Despite appeals by a security guard, the women shook the iron
fence around the compound for a few moments and then marched off
toward the offices of the International Committee of the Red Cross.
	   Serb officials have accused the United States and international
agencies of favoring the Albanians, who compromise 90 percent of
Kosovo's 2 million inhabitants.
	   Since the government launched its crackdown in February against
the KLA, international attention has focused on the suffering of
tens of thousands of ethnic Albanians who have fled their homes in
advance of Serb forces.
	   But the discovery of human remains at Klecka, a former KLA
stronghold southwest of Pristina, has underscored the impact of the
conflict on civilians from both sides.
	   In a statement published Monday by an Albanian language
newspaper, the KLA denied its members had committed atrocities in
Klecka and claimed witnesses produced by Serb authorities were
``smugglers who have have often cooperated'' with the government.
	   The KLA claimed the bodies ``exhibited in front of television
cameras'' were probably Albanian civilians killed by the Serbs.
	   Serbian police and the Yugoslav army have been trying to crush
the independence effort. Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the
dominant Yugoslav republic.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed on both sides, and more than
260,000 have been rendered homeless by the fighting. Western
government have threatened to use force against the Serbs to stop
the offensive, but have yet to follow through.
	   U.S. Sen. John Warner, R-Va., a member of the Senate Armed
Services Committee, toured the province Monday to look into the
suffering of refugees.
	   Serb government forces have driven KLA fighters from much of the
at least 30 percent of Kosovo territory the rebels once controlled.
	   In Belgrade, Serbian Vice Premier Tomislav Nikolic claimed
Sunday that the Kosovo rebels had been all but defeated. ``That
gang no longer exists, it has been broken down into small groups
which commit atrocities,'' he said.

A year later: Princess Diana mourned in public and in private

<TEXT>
	   CRATHIE, Scotland (AP) _ A year after Princess Diana's death,
thousands of people commemorated one of the most public lives of
modern times Monday, while those who knew her best marked the
anniversary of a very private grief in the seclusion of their
Scottish castle.
	   Diana's beloved boys, Prince William, 16, and Prince Harry, 13,
looking somber and wearing black ties, prayed for their mother at a
private service for the royal family near Balmoral Castle, where
their father woke them last Aug. 31 to tell them of her fatal car
crash in Paris.
	   In London, the pile of flowers at the gates of the princess'
former home at Kensington Palace grew to about a thousand bouquets
Monday morning. Messages in many languages, photographs taken from
newspapers, and paper hearts adorned the black and gold palace
gates.
	   Scores of well-wishers held an all-night candle-lit vigil, and
public memorial services were planned at the city's great
cathedrals. Britain's Union Jack flag flew at half staff on
government buildings and royal residences, as an official symbol of
the personal and public remembrance of Diana.
	   In Paris, a small crowd kept an all-night candle-lit vigil at an
eternal flame above the tunnel where the car carrying the princess
and her lover Dodi Fayed crashed in the early morning hours last
Aug. 31. Thirty-six candles surrounded the flame _ one for each
year of Diana's life.
	   For Diana's family it was a day for quiet reflection.
	   At Althorp, 75 miles (120 kms) north of London, away from the
public gaze, Diana's brother, Earl Spencer and her sisters, Lady
Sarah McCorquodale and Lady Jane Fellowes, were holding a service
overlooking her burial site on an island in an ornamental lake.
	   Balmoral, Queen Victoria's ``dear paradise'' of mountains,
forests and salmon streams, has been a vacation retreat for the
royal family since 1855 and they visit off and on during the year,
particularly in late summer.
	   But they came together en masse, with spouses and children, for
the anniversary of Diana's death. Prime Minister Tony Blair and his
wife, Cherie, who were at Balmoral for the weekend, joined the
royals Monday at the tiny stone church of Crathie parish, just
outside the castle's gates and across the rushing waters of the
River Dee.
	   The Rev. Robert Sloan mentioned Diana by name in prayers and
read the Psalm 23 _ ``The Lord is My Shepherd, I Shall Not Want'' _
and from chapter 40 of Isaiah, ``Comfort Ye My People Sayeth Your
God.''
	   Commemorations seemed modest, reflecting recent opinion polls
indicating many Britons found last year's mourning excessive.
	   When the royal party left for church, there were only about 20
spectators and half a dozen bouquets against the wall.
	   ``I feel disappointed for the royal family that more people
aren't here,'' said Tim Bunday, 31, who brought his two-year-old
son to see the royals. ``Maybe people think it's more respectful
not to be here today.''
	   Queen Elizabeth II on Monday thanked people for their sympathy.
	   ``The queen and the royal family, particularly the Prince of
Wales, Prince William and Prince Harry, would like to thank people
for their messages and kind gestures of sympathy at this sad time
and for sharing their remembrance of the Princess of Wales,'' said
a royal statement.
	   At St. James's Palace, where Harry and William live in London
with their father, Prince Charles, Diana's former employees and
members of the royal household were expected to attend a service of
remembrance in the chapel where the princess's coffin rested before
her funeral.
	   Mohamed Al Fayed marked the anniversary of his eldest son's
death with a private memorial service at his tomb at the family
estate outside London.
	   At Harrods, the London department store he owns, two eight-foot
(2.4 meter) bronze sculptures around portraits of Diana and Dodi
were unveiled Monday in a window and at a permanent memorial
inside. The portraits are set within two interlinked capital
``D's'' above a fountain whose water symbolizes eternal life.
	   ``I pray my beloved son and his dearest Diana have found peace
and comfort in heaven. I am sure they are happy together,'' Al
Fayed said in a statement.
	   Sir Elton John, whose adaptation of ``Candle in the Wind'' in
memory of Diana captured the grief of millions, criticized her
family's decision to bury her on a tiny island far from her sons
and her adoring public _ not in Westminster Abbey where her funeral
took place.
	   ``I just feel it's sad that she's on that island _ it's as if
she's all alone again,'' he was quoted as telling The Sunday
Telegraph.
	   One of Diana's closest friends, Rosa Monckton, the president of
Tiffany's London operation, said the princess would be appalled at
the cult that has grown up around her since her death.
	   ``This whole Diana industry, which is so sordid, should stop and
she should be allowed to rest in peace,'' Monckton told BBC Radio
4.

Kabila flies to Namibia, repeats accusations against South Africa

<TEXT>
	   WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) _ Ignoring a global diplomatic gathering
expected to tackle his problems, Congo's President Laurent Kabila
on Monday flew to Namibia and denounced South Africa for allegedly
supporting rebels trying to unseat him.
	   Kabila repeated accusations he made Sunday in Zimbabwe that
South Africa had sold 61 tons of guns and ammunition to Rwanda, a
country that shares Congo's eastern border and that Kabila claims
is backing the insurrection.
	   South Africa denied Kabila's charges it had sold weapons to
Rwanda to be used for the rebels.
	   ``That's not true,'' government spokesman Joel Netshitenzhe said
Monday.
	   South Africa has acknowledged, however, that along with other
countries, it did supply arms nearly two years ago to the country's
Tutsi-led government in the aftermath of massacres of Tutsis by
Hutus.
	   The four-week-old Congo crisis was expected to dominate
discussion at the Nonaligned Movement summit meeting in Durban,
South Africa, where global delegates were to consider a proposal
from Kabila to censure Rwanda and Uganda for alleged invasion of
his country.
	   Kabila said Sunday he would not attend the summit because he was
``too busy organizing resistance against foreign aggression.''
	   Namibia, Angola and Zimbabwe are backing Kabila, while Rwanda
and Uganda are sympathetic to the rebels.
	   Kabila and Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe have scorned a
mediation effort led by South Africa.
	   Speaking to reporters at State House, Kabila was pessimistic
about a peace settlement.
	   ``We shall talk peace when (the rebels) are out of the
country,'' Kabila said.
	   Kabila met with Namibian President Sam Nujoma and Indian Prime
Minister Atal Bihari Vaypayee, who was on his way to the Durban
summit.

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan left
Monday for a two-day visit to Sudan en route to the Nonaligned
Movement's summit in South Africa.
	   The official Iraqi News Agency quoted Ramadan as saying that in
Sudan, he would discuss ``cooperation and coordination in the face
of schemes and aggression enacted by ... the Americans and
Zionists.''
	   It was a reference to the Aug. 20 U.S. missile attack on a
factory in the Sudanese capital Khartoum. The United States says
the factory was involved in the production of chemical weapons, but
the Sudanese insist it made only medicines.
	   Ramadan was expected to meet with Sudan's president, Lt. Gen.
Omar el-Bashir, INA said.
	   Iraq's foreign minister, Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf, already is in
Durban, South Africa, participating in preliminary meetings of the
nonaligned group. The two-day summit starts Wednesday.
	   Ramadan was quoted as saying he would update the summit on
Iraq's latest standoff with the United Nations.
	   Iraq announced on Aug. 5 that it no longer would cooperate with
U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   The inspectors must certify that Iraq has eliminated its weapons
of mass destruction before punishing trade sanctions, imposed after
Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, can be lifted.

Israel closes Palestinian Authority office in Hebron
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NASSER SHIYOUKHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Israeli troops on Monday closed a
Palestinian Authority office in the Israeli-controlled sector of
Hebron, saying it had been opened without Israeli permission.
	   Employees sat outside the Palestinian Supplies Ministry office,
which supervises food wholesalers and grocers, in protest for
several hours.
	   Hebron Mayor Mustafa Natche said the army had no right to shut
down the office. He said under peace accords with Israel, the
Palestinians retained control over civil affairs in all of Hebron,
which is home to 130,000 Palestinians and 450 Jewish settlers.
	   The new dispute came at a time when tensions were still running
high following the Aug. 20 killing of a prominent Jewish settler,
apparently by Palestinian militants. In response to the slaying,
settlers have repeatedly beaten and stoned Palestinian passers-by.
	   Also Monday, a Palestinian peace negotiator denied an Israel
radio report that Israel and the Palestinians had reached a draft
agreement on how to use some of the land Israel is to hand over in
a future troop withdrawal.
	   Israel has agreed in principle to withdraw from 13 percent of
the West Bank, provided that 3 percent is set aside as a ``nature
reserve'' in which Israel retains control over security and
Palestinian land use is restricted.
	   The radio said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's envoy,
attorney Yitzhak Molcho, and Palestinian Parliament Speaker Ahmed
Qureia wrote a draft agreement regarding the division of authority
between Israelis and Palestinians in the nature reserve.
	   However, Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour said there was no
agreement with the Israelis and that the gaps remained wide.
	   Under a U.S. proposal first submitted in January, Israel was to
withdraw from 13 percent of the West Bank. ``We don't agree that
the 13 percent be broken up,'' Asfour said.
	   The 13 percent pullback was to be the second of three to which
Israel committed itself in a U.S.-brokered 1997 agreement with the
Palestinians. Under that accord, Monday was to have been the
deadline for completing the third withdrawal.
	   In a letter to U.S. President Bill Clinton, Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat asked for renewed assurances that the United States
will hold Israel to its promise of three pullbacks, Israeli
newspapers reported Monday.

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Romanian Prime Minister Radu Vasile
discussed with his Lebanese counterpart Rafik Hariri Monday ways of
boosting economic and trade relations between the two countries.
	   Vasile, accompanied by several Cabinet ministers and business
executives, arrived Monday on a two-day visit, his first to
Lebanon.
	   The visit is aimed at reactivating economic agreements signed by
the two countries during Hariri's trip to Bucharest earlier this
year.
	   The agreements are designed to promote and protect investments
in both countries and avoid double taxation on their exports. They
call on Lebanon and Romania to cooperate in the fields of health,
medical science and tourism, the An-Nahar newspaper reported.
	   The two-way trade is currently in Romania's favor.
	   Hariri said he discussed with Vasile how to remove hurdles in
the way of Lebanese exports to Romania in a bid to narrow the trade
gap.
	   ``Lebanon's imports from Romania are valued at dlrs 100 million,
while its exports are worth about dlrs 10 million,'' Hariri said,
adding that Vasile promised to take measures to redress the trade
balance.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egypt's foreign trade rose by 2.158 billion
Egyptian pounds (dlrs 647 million) in the first half of this year
to 25.4 billion Egyptian pounds (dlrs 7.5 billion), the Egyptian
Gazette reported Monday.
	   Quoting a report by the Central Agency for Mobilization and
Statistics, the paper said imports rose from 17.7 billion Egyptian
pounds (dlrs 5.2 billion) in the first half of last year to 21.1
billion Egyptian pounds (dlrs 6.2 billion).
	   This year's exports totaled 4.2 billion Egyptian pounds (dlrs
1.2 billion), down from 5.3 billion Egyptian pounds (dlrs 1.5
billion) over the same period last year.
	   The report said the United States and the European Union were
Egypt's main trading partners.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egypt's main state wheat buyer said Monday
that he had contracted to buy Australian wheat, but said he
wouldn't release any details until later.
	   ``I have contracted some wheat, but I will announce it later,''
said Samir El-Shakankiri, vice chairman of the General Authority
for Supply Commodities.
	   Egypt tendered late last Thursday for 50,000 metric tons of
Australian soft white wheat for loading in October.
	   Egypt bought 200,000 metric tons of U.S. Pacific soft white
wheat Saturday at dlrs 99.50 per ton free on board for loading in
October.

	   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) _ Bahrain International Bank said Monday
its net profit this year rose by 10 percent to dlrs 11.1 million.
	   Net profit in during the same period last year was dlrs 10.1
million, the bank said in a statement.
	   The Bahrain-based bank didn't provide a full balance sheet, but
said its profit were bolstered by gains from investment portfolio
as well as investment income from U.S. private equity business.
	   BIB is an offshore investment bank listed on the Bahrain Stock
Exchange. It has offices in Bahrain, the United States, the United
Kingdom and Ireland.

	   KUWAIT (AP) _ Kuwait's non-oil exports in the first half of the
year reached 33.22 million dinars (dlrs 108.56 million), up from
26.18 million dinars (dlrs 85.55 million) in the corresponding
period last year, the Kuwait News Agency reported Monday.
	   Ministry of Commerce and Industry figures showed that most of
the exports went to the neighboring Arab states in the Gulf, KUNA
said. These were worth some 25.63 million dinars (dlrs 83.75
million).
	   The state-run agency did not offer any explanations or further
details. Kuwait depends on oil for most of its state revenues, but
it exports garments, foodstuff, urea and other petrochemicals.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ The State-run Jordan Petroleum Refinery
plans to raise its production capacity by 17 percent to 14,000 tons
a day, the director-general of the refinery said Monday.
	   Abdul-Wahab Zoubi told The Associated Press that the refinery
will upgrade its storage capacity from oil and gas in order to

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Investments in the housing sector in fell
by up to 30 percent because of the deteriorating financial
situation, brokers said Monday.

the housing sector said land prices have not increased but prices
of apartments have dropped in general due to lower building
expenses and because people have less cash to spend.
	   He said prices of basic material fell and labor costs declined
by 5 percent.
	   He said there are 3,000 apartments for sale in Amman alone.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ North Korea test-fired a new long-range ballistic
missile into open seas between Russia and northwestern Japan
Monday, sharply esclating tensions in an already volatile corner of
Asia.
	   The launch just after noon (0300 GMT) was confirmed by Japanese,
South Korean and United States defense officials. It was North
Korea's first test-firing of a missile in five years and its fourth
since 1984.
	   In response, Japan Monday refused to back a long-planned
agreement to help fund two nuclear reactors for North Korea.
	   Japan's Defense Agency, quoting unidentified U.S. military
officials, said the missile was probably aimed at waters between
Russia and Japan and landed 300 kilometers (190 miles) southeast of
Vladivostok, Russia.
	   But Japan's state-run TV network, NHK, said there were
unconfirmed reports that a second stage of the missile passed over
Japan and landed in the Pacific Ocean.
	   The missile was a new `Daepodong I' with a range of 2,000
kilometers (1,240 miles), the South Korean Defense Ministry said.

Taliban warns Iran against invading its territory
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Afghanistan's Taliban religious army
on Monday accused Iran of conducting menacing military maneuvers
along its western border.
	   The statement warned Iran that the Taliban would respond
militarily to a cross-border incursion and promised to drive
Iranian troops far back into their country.
	   ``Iran is holding military exercises close to the Afghan border,
but we are saying be careful of our people and the territorial
integrity of Afghanistan,'' said a statement issued by the
Taliban's foreign ministry in the Afghan capital of Kabul.
	   Relations between Iran and the Taliban army, which rules most of
Afghanistan, has always been strained, but has grown tense in the
last month since 11 Iranian diplomats disappeared in Afghanistan.
	   According to Iran, the diplomats have been missing since the
Taliban army overran strategic cities in northern Afghanistan,
including Mazar-e-Sharif where Tehran maintained a consulate.
	   The Iran Embassy in the Afghan capital closed after the Taliban
religious army took over the city in September 1996.
	   The statement by the Taliban army said it has no intention of
stepping across its borders into neighboring countries, but it
won't let an incursion by Iran go unanswered.
	   Our decision is not to go one meter (yard) over the
international borders into the homes of our neighbors,'' said the
statement.
	   However, it said its neighbors, in particular Iran, were
``interfering in Afghanistan, sending in plane loads of ammunition
to our opposition.''
	   Iran has repeatedly denied aiding a coalition of small parties
fighting to stop the onslaught of the Taliban army. The
anti-Taliban coalition represents most of the country's minority
ethnic groups, including Shiite Muslims. Most Iranians are Shiite
Muslims, while most Taliban soldiers belong to the majority Sunni
sect of Islam.

Japan's ambassador says war still an issue for Australia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Japan's relationship with Australia
depends on the way the Japanese government and people deal with
issues stemming from World War II, the outgoing Japanese ambassador
said Monday.
	   Though the number of Australians who thought of Japan as a
wartime enemy was declining, there were still some who could not
forget what Japanese troops did during the war, Yukio Sato said at
a farewell luncheon.
	   ``We must admit what has happened in the past and seek for ways
to get over them,'' aid Sato, who will become an ambassador to the
United Nations. His replacement as Australian ambassador has not
been officially confirmed.
	   ``Japanese people doing business here should always know the
fact that the memories of the war strongly lingers in the
Australian society,'' he said.
	   But the situation was gradually changing, he said.
	   In November last year, Sato was warmly welcomed at a ceremony
for the inauguration of the new president of the Returned Services
League, the organization of war veterans, opening up a dialogue
between Japanese diplomats and the League.
	   As well, the Japanese government is planning a ceremony to
recognize so-called wartime brides, Japanese women who married
Australian soldiers stationed in Japan.
	   Some 650 to 700 Japanese women came to Australia with their
husbands after the war.
	   ``We want to thank them as a government for their deeds to
alleviate the anti-Japanese sentiment in Australia in the postwar
period,'' Sato said.
	   ``If there were a hundred people, there should be a hundred
different feelings towards the war ... and though the memories of
the war is gradually becoming a past, we hope to keep on making
efforts for a better Australia-Japan relationship,'' Sato said.

More than 1.5 million marooned in north Indian flood
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: SUBS 6th graf to UPDATE death toll to 1,086. Minor edits. &QL; 
 &UR; By HEMA SHUKLA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Police hoped to locate 20 villages that
reportedly disappeared Monday in floodwaters, as aid workers pulled
bloated bodies from the turbulent waters submerging a wide swathe
of northern India.
	   ``The destruction is so overwhelming that rescue efforts seem
futile,'' said Kripa Shankar Pandey, a local reporter who lives in
Gorakhpur at the center of the disaster zone.
	   Working with fewer than 1,500 boats _ most of them aging,
cracked rowboats _ police failed to find any trace of 20 isolated
clusters of huts in the unending stretch of water in Uttar Pradesh,
India's most populous state and one of its poorest.
	   Jeetendra Singh, a government administrator in Gorakhpur, said
an estimated 1.5 million villagers were surrounded by floodwaters
and marooned. Authorities were trying to fly in at least 300
sturdy, motorized boats from Calcutta and Bombay on air force
planes. Currently, only 11 motorized boats are available for rescue
operations, said Singh.
	   Thousands of acres (hectares) of standing crops were submerged,
along with tens of thousands of homes. Officials had not begun
estimating the amount of damage to property and livestock.
	   Officials in Lucknow, the state capital, put the death toll at
1,086 on Monday. At least 32 people drowned in different parts of
the state Sunday and Monday and 34 others died in a cholera
epidemic caused by the flood, said Ram Kumar Yadav, a senior
official in the state's Interior Department.
	   Across the state in Gorakhpur, Singh admitted the administration
was overwhelmed by the problem. Rescue work was slow, he said, but
several hundred people had been brought to dry areas and were being
housed in government shelters where they received food and
medicine.
	   At least one hastily built shelter was itself submerged, said
Pandey. Refugees from the shelter swam to higher areas and were
forced to spend the night in the rain, he said.
	   Air force helicopters dropped food and tarpaulins to people
marooned on their rooftops, Singh said.
	   Rivers in eastern Uttar Pradesh state continued to rise. The
Rapti River, which flows through Gorakhpur, broke its embankment in
20 places. A power station south of Gorakhpur was shut down because
of the rising water and a railway station was submerged.
	   Two thousand trucks loaded with food and supplies were stranded
on a national highway.
	   Authorities blocked underground sewers, fearing that flood water
would rush into areas in Gorakhpur city that were still dry. But,
residents complained that it caused refuse to flow back into their
neighborhood and homes and contaminate drinking water.
	   Municipal authorities were trying to pump back the sewage, Singh
said.

North Korea fires missile into seas between Russia and Japan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with South Korean news agency also reporting missile
landing in Pacific, South Korean defense spokesman saying that
government still trying to determine exact location of landing &QL; 
 &UR; By TODD ZAUN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ North Korea test-fired a new long-range ballistic
missile into open seas between Russia and northwestern Japan
Monday, sharply esclating tensions in an already volatile corner of
Asia.
	   The launch just after noon (0300 GMT) was confirmed by Japanese,
South Korean and United States defense officials. It was North
Korea's first test-firing of a missile in five years and its fourth
since 1984.
	   In response, Japan Monday refused to back a long-planned
agreement to help fund two nuclear reactors for North Korea.
	   Japan's Defense Agency, quoting unidentified U.S. military
officials, said the missile was probably aimed at waters between
Russia and Japan and landed 300 kilometers (190 miles) southeast of
Vladivostok, Russia.
	   But Japan's state-run TV network, NHK, said there were
unconfirmed reports that a second stage of the missile passed over
Japan and landed in the Pacific Ocean.
	   South Korea's state-run Yonhap news agency and MBC TV made a
similar report earlier Monday, but South Korea's Defense Agency
said it was still trying to determine the exact location of the
landing.
	   ``Our official position is that the missile landed in the waters
between Russia and Japan,'' said a Defense Ministry spokesman, who
requested anonymity.
	   The missile was ``confirmed to be a brand-new `Daepodong I' with
a range of 2,000 kilometers (1,240 miles),'' the South Korean
Defense Ministry said in a statement.
	   That range is twice as long as the North's previous staple
``Rodong'' series missiles.
	   Japanese Coast Guard patrol boats airplanes were immediately
dispatched to the area where the missile hit. But it was unclear
whether they could actually go to the site _ which was believed to
be close to or possibly inside Russian waters.
	   ``We see this as a very dangerous act,'' said chief government
spokesman Hiromu Nonaka. He said Japan would express its concern to
the North through diplomatic channels.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, visiting Sarajevo,
told reporters she was also alarmed by the test launch.
	   ``This is something that we will be raising with North Koreans
in the talks that are currently going on,'' she said.
	   Those talks, in New York, are over a proposal for the North to
suspend missile development in exchange for nuclear energy
know-how, and some Korea watchers said they suspect the launch was
timed to up the stakes.
	   ``Kim is good at brinksmanship,'' said Hajime Izumi, a noted
North Korea watcher and professor at Shizuoka University, referring
to North Korea's leader Kim Jong Il.
	   ``This shows that North Korea can make effective missiles,'' he
added. ``What remains to be seen is if they can mass produce them,
or deploy them.''
	   Masahiro Akiyama, deputy director of Japan's Defense Agency,
said the launch was not totally a surprise _ security experts, he
said, had been increasing their surveillance of the North since
earlier this month.
	   Stalinist North Korea, which over the past few years has been
foundering under devastating famines, is to convene its newly
elected parliament on Sept. 5, and are expected to elect Kim as the
country's president.
	   In June, North Korea also admitted for the first time that it
has sold missiles abroad. It had long been suspected of selling
missiles to Iran and Syria.
	   But very little is known about North Korea's missile program,
and its possession of a significantly better missile would be a
matter of serious concern throughout the region.
	   North Korea's best-known ballistic missile is the Rodong, which
has a range of about 1,000 kilometers (620 miles). It was last test
fired in 1993, and also landed in the same area of the Sea of
Japan, which divides the Korean Peninsula from Japan.
	   With its 1,000 kilometer (620-mile range), the Rodong I missile,
a modified Scud, could strike South Korea and much of Japan. The
newer missile would put even more of Japan within range.
	   In 1996, the United States began talks with North Korea aimed at
persuading the secretive Communist country to freeze its missile
program and to join an international agreement designed to restrict
missile proliferation. The talks stalled.
	   Japan is currently boosting its budget for joint development of
a missile defense system with the United States, and has reportedly
earmarked 500 million yen (dlrs 3.6 million) for the project next
year.
	   The United States has 37,000 troops stationed in South Korea,
many of them based near its border with North Korea. It has roughly
another 50,000 troops in Japan.
	   Monday's was the secretive North's fourth test-firing of a
missile since 1984 and its first in five years.

German companies face class-action suits from Jewish groups
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Fresh from concluding a billion-dollar
settlement with Swiss banks, Jewish organizations will decide soon
about filing class action suits against German companies that used
slave labor during World War II, a spokesman said Monday.
	   An official of a Jewish group pressing for compensation for
survivors of the Nazi Holocaust said the fact a U.S. lawyer has
already filed such a suit will not stop his organization from
pressing ahead with its own legal action.
	   ``We are at the beginning stages of research,'' said Yoram Dori,
spokesperson for the World Jewish Restitution Organization (WJRO).
He said a decision about the class-action suit would be made in
``weeks, not months.''
	   On Sunday, lawyer Ed Fagan filed a class action suit in New York
against several German companies. He represents Jews who were
forced to work in German factories during the war. Another lawyer
was expected to file a similar suit Monday.
	   Dori said the WJRO is going ahead with its plans. He said the
suits filed so far do not represent all the survivors.
	   The class-action suits refer to inmates in Nazi concentration
camps who were forced to work without pay for German companies
during World War II. The firms included leaders in German industry
like Volkswagen, Daimler, Krupp and others.
	   The aim would be to recover salaries that were not paid to the
workers, according to Dori.
	   The WJRO recently came to agreement with banks in Switzerland
about compensation to Holocaust survivors and heirs of victims who
deposited money in Swiss bank accounts before or during World War
II but were unable to withdraw the funds for lack of documentation.
The amount of the settlement was drls 1.25 billion.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called a meeting of
Jewish organization representatives Monday to head off possible
disputes over distribution of the money from the Swiss banks.
	   Dori said there were some technical disagreements among various
groups, but that he was sure they would be worked out.
	   Dori said the WJRO is opposed to having the Israeli government
handle the distribution. ``People everywhere are suspicious of
governments, and the Jews in Israel are no different,'' he said.

No right to absolute peace, supreme court rules
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ The silence-loving Swiss have no
right to absolute quiet, the country's supreme court said in a
ruling published Monday.
	   The Federal Tribunal rejected a claim by a plaintiff in the
northern canton (state) of Schaffhausen that a bird-scaring device
in a vineyard over the state line in Zurich constituted an illegal
disturbance.
	   Noise is only a disturbance when it damages the well-being of a
substantial proportion of the local population, the judges ruled.
After a court delegation visited the plaintiff's property, 300
meters (yards) from the vineyard across the Rhine river, they
decided that was not the case.
	   The court said the fact no other complaints had been received
about the device, which emits bird sounds and around 60 gunshot
noises per hour, contributed to its decision.
	   The owner couldn't reasonably be expected to give up protecting
his vines or to replace the bird scarer with expensive netting that
could snare birds and small animals, the court added.
	   Zurich state authorities allow the use of the bird-scaring
machine between 7 a.m. and 8 p.m. during two months of the year
only.
	   The Swiss have frequently been known to complain to police over
loud music from parties and even over neighbors taking showers
after 10 p.m.

Business leaders fear economic setback because of floods
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Bangladesh, where life has always been
a struggle, was showing good signs of growth and of making inroads
against its endemic poverty. Then the floods came.
	   For two months, the floodwaters have been sinking entire
villages and destroying field after field, spreading like an
inkblot across the landscape. From the air, Bangladesh is a muddy
ocean broken by tiny islands where villagers have clustered to take
refuge.
	   Economists and business leaders warned Monday the floods will
set back the country's recent progress as funds are diverted to buy
food and repair the damage to roads, bridges, factories and the
croplands which are the economic backbone of this nation of 120
million.
	   More than 550 people have been killed, and some 25 million
displaced. The deluge has submerged two-thirds of the country, the
government says.
	   Just last May, a survey World Bank and Asian Development Bank
said Bangladesh's economy was showing steady growth, leading to a
drop in the poverty level to 36 percent from 43 percent of its
population over four years. In the usual muted tone of such
reports, it said ``Bangladesh's medium-term prospects look
encouraging.''
	   Now, funds earmarked for development will go toward feeding and
rebuilding the country, government planners said. Development
experts said the annual food deficit may jump from the normal 1.5
million tons to 4 million tons.
	   In an address broadcast Sunday, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina
assured her people the government will buy additional grain to
stave off shortages, and renewed her appeal to international donors
for contributions of dlrs 700 million in emergency aid and 1.3
million tons of wheat and rice.
	   The United States and other donors have pledged about half the
required wheat. But they are making their own assessment of the
flood damage and are likely to withhold further commitments until
the government prepares its flood rehabilitation plan.
	   ``We know that food grains will be available in international
markets to buy. But it will mean diverting development funds to
meet the emergency,'' said Abul Bayes, of Jahangirnagar University
near Dhaka.
	   He feared the floods have killed the country's hopes for meeting
its target of 6 percent growth. Thanks largely to liberal policies,
the economy grew 5.6 percent last year and 5.9 percent the previous
year.
	   Industry also has been hurt.
	   ``The productivity loss and structural damage to industrial
units could be worth several billion dollars,'' Yusouf Abdullah
Harun, President of the Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of
Commerce and Industry said in an interview.
	   The floods have either shut down or damaged at least 5,000
industries, said another business leader, Sharif Afzal Hossain, who
heads Bangladesh Chamber of Industries. Some of these factories
produce garments that earn an annual export revenue of nearly dlrs
3 billion, 60 percent of the country's export income.
	   The government has asked all ministries to cut down their
expenditures on low-priority development projects and instead
divert the funds to repair the damaged infrastructure.

An Feng appoints China Development Corp. chairman to board
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PERTH, Australia (AP) _ An Feng Kingstream Steel has appointed
China Development Corp.'s chairman Dr. Tai-Ying Liu as a director
of the company.
	   Liu is also chairman of the business management committee of
Taiwan's ruling Kuomintang party and in that capacity has
responsibility for Central Investment Holding Co, the government's
investment arm.
	   He will also become a director and chairman of the company's
92.3 percent owned subsidiary An Feng Steel Co.
	   The appointment follows news 10 days ago that An Feng's largest
shareholder An-Hsiung Chu was negotiating to sell a substantial
part of his holding in the company to Central Investment Holding
Co.
	   An Feng's deputy chairman Ken Court said at the time that the
intended move of Liu onto the board effectively meant the
investment group had locked into the deal.
	   The market has speculated that a move by the Taiwanese
government, which reportedly has plentiful cash reserves, to
increase its holding in the company would help square up finance
for the proposed steel mill north of Perth.
	   Further siteworks at the plant have been delayed pending the
refinancing of debt associated with An Feng's Taiwanese businesses.
	   The finance and construction deal for the project is being
arranged by trading house Mitsui and Co., which has reportedly
refused to sign the final contract until the next stage of site
works at Oakajee is completed.
	   Liu said Monday he was optimistic on the long-term outlook for
the steel industry and looked forward to the on-going development
of the AFK group, in particular to the Mid-West iron and steel
project.
	   ``The proposed 2.6 million tons per annum integrated steel slab
facility would bring excellent long-term benefits to the AFK group
and Taiwan,'' Liu said.

	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Frank Rijkaard was named Monday as
the new coach of the Dutch national soccer team.
	   Rijkaard replaces Guus Hiddink, who joined Spanish giant Real
Madrid after guiding the Netherlands to fourth place in the
summer's World Cup finals in France. Rijkaard was Hiddink's
assistant during the tournament.
	   The 35-year-old former Ajax and AC Milan star was a star of the
Dutch team that won the 1988 European Championships. He played 73
internationals for the Netherlands, scoring 10 goals from the
midfield.
	   Rijkaard, who only ended his playing days at the end of the 1995
season, was considered by many an outsider for the coach's job.
Former Celtic manager Wim Jansen was many pundits' favorite to take
over from Hiddink.

Russian ultranationalist: Clinton too immoral for summit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Ultranationalist leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky
called on U.S. President Clinton on Monday to postpone his visit to
Moscow, saying Russians would be offended because of his
immorality.
	   Zhirinovsky, who often is criticized for his own behavior and
comments, made his remarks in parliament during debate before the
vote on whether to approve Viktor Chernomyrdin as prime minister.
	   ``President Clinton's visit today would be ill-timed,'' the
leader of the Liberal Democratic Party said. ``Especially since his
recent moral scandal does not allow us, people with a high
morality, to meet with a person who cannot sort out his relations
with a secretary.''
	   The nationalist leader repeatedly assailed Clinton, who
acknowledged that he had an improper relationship with Monica
Lewinsky, a former White House intern.
	   Throughout his remarks Monday, Zhirinovsky pretended that he
held the job of prime minister himself, and kept referring to
himself as head of the Cabinet.
	   In the past, Zhirinovsky has come under fire for his behavior
toward women. He punched a female parliament member and once asked
a female journalist to undress for him.
	   In another outburst last spring, he spat and hurled water at his
fellow legislators after he was denied the parliamentary podium.
Then he shouted that he wished he had a pistol so he could shoot
the other lawmakers.

Toyota to invest dlrs 44 million in factory in eastern Germany
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DRESDEN, Germany (AP) _ Two subsidiaries of Toyota Motor Corp.
announced Monday they will build an 80 million mark (dlrs 44
million) factory in Dresden to produce compressors for air
conditioners.
	   The Toyota investment is a result of increased demand in Europe
for air conditioners in cars, representatives of Toyoda Automatic
Loom Works Ltd. and Denso Corp. said at a news conference with the
Saxony state economics minister, Kajo Schommer.
	   The firms' representatives said the factory will bring about 85
jobs as of October 2000 to former communist East Germany, which
continues to struggle in its transition to a market economy.
	   The factory is to produce 600,000 compressors per year.

Australians seek meeting with Spaniards over latest Skase move
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Australian officials in Madrid said Monday
they wanted to meet with Spanish counterparts to clarify fugitive
businessman Christopher Skase's latest move to avoid expulsion from
this country.
	   According to the newspaper El Pais, Skase, 49, has obtained from
Spain an entry visa valid in any of the so-called Schengen
countries of the European Union, which allow free movement of
persons across their common borders.
	   The paper said the visa was apparently obtained fraudulently
because there is no evidence that Skase left Spain to get it.
	   If he does in fact have such a visa it would hamper Spain's
efforts to expel Skase, who has lived on the Mediterranean island
of Mallorca since fleeing Australia following the 1.5 billion
Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 930 million) collapse of his Quintex
group of companies.
	   The Spanish Foreign Ministry on Monday refused to confirm or
deny the weekend newspaper report.
	   A spokesman at the Australian Embassy said officials there did
not know exactly what kind of visa Skase had obtained in his latest
ploy to avoid going home to face charges in the Quintex affair.
	   These officials hope to meet with Spanish Foreign Ministry
officials as early as Tuesday. ``We obviously have a lot of
questions to ask,'' the spokesman said.
	   El Pais reported that on a passport he has obtained for himself
and his family from the Caribbean island nation of Dominica, Skase
has obtained a new European entry visa.
	   He got the visa through the Spanish Embassy in Jamaica,
apparently without traveling to that country, the paper said. It
added that the Spanish Interior Ministry is investigating because
the visa was granted without consultation with the Madrid
government.
	   The Interior Ministry declined to comment Monday.
	   Skase obtained the Dominica passport by paying that country's
government dlrs US 50,000 (Australian dollars 85,000), its Finance
Minister Julius Timothy said last week.
	   Skase defeated a 1994 extradition bid by Australia when a
Spanish court ruled that he was too ill to return to that country.
Skase says he has a lung ailment that makes it impossible for him
to travel by plane.
	   After strenuous lobbying from Australia, Spain in July refused
to extend Skase's residency permit, forcing him to seek refuge
elsewhere to avoid deportation to Australia.

German companies face class-action suits from Jewish groups
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Fresh from concluding a billion-dollar
settlement with Swiss banks, Jewish organizations will decide soon
about filing class action suits against German companies that used
slave labor during World War II, a spokesman said Monday.
	   An official of a Jewish group pressing for compensation for
survivors of the Holocaust said the fact a U.S. lawyer has already
filed such a suit will not stop his organization from pressing
ahead with its own legal action.
	   ``We are at the beginning stages of research,'' said Yoram Dori,
spokesperson for the World Jewish Restitution Organization (WJRO).
He said a decision about the class-action suit would be made in
``weeks, not months.''
	   On Sunday, lawyer Ed Fagan filed a class action suit in New York
against several German companies. He represents Jews who were
forced to work in German factories during the war. Another lawyer
was expected to file a similar suit Monday.
	   Dori said the WJRO is going ahead with its plans. He said the
suits filed so far do not represent all the survivors.
	   The class-action suits refer to inmates in Nazi concentration
camps who were forced to work without pay for German companies
during World War II. The firms included leaders in German industry
like Volkswagen, Daimler, Krupp and others.
	   The aim would be to recover salaries that were not paid to the
workers, according to Dori.
	   The WJRO recently came to agreement with banks in Switzerland
about compensation to Holocaust survivors and heirs of victims who
deposited money in Swiss bank accounts before or during World War
II but were unable to withdraw the funds for lack of documentation.
The amount of the settlement was dlrs 1.25 billion.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called a meeting of
Jewish organization representatives Monday to head off possible
disputes over distribution of the money from the Swiss banks.
	   Dori said there were some technical disagreements among various
groups, but that he was sure they would be worked out.
	   Dori said the WJRO is opposed to having the Israeli government
handle the distribution. ``People everywhere are suspicious of
governments, and the Jews in Israel are no different,'' he said.

	   In response, Japan Monday refused to back a long-planned
agreement to help fund two nuclear reactors for North Korea.
	   Japan's Defense Agency, quoting unidentified U.S. military
officials, said the missile was probably aimed at waters between
Russia and Japan and landed 300 kilometers (190 miles) southeast of
Vladivostok, Russia.
	   The missile was ``confirmed to be a brand-new `Daepodong I' with
a range of 2,000 kilometers (1,240 miles),'' the South Korean
Defense Ministry said in a statement.
	   That range is twice as long as the North's previous staple
``Rodong'' series missiles.
	   Japanese Coast Guard patrol boats airplanes were immediately
dispatched to the area where the missile hit. But it was unclear
whether they could actually go to the site _ which was believed to
be close to or possibly inside Russian waters.
	   ``We see this as a very dangerous act,'' said chief government
spokesman Hiromu Nonaka. He said Japan would express its concern to
the North through diplomatic channels.

French soccer star visits Angola as part of land mine campaign
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CASIMIRO SIONA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ A French soccer star arrived Monday to
promote the international campaign against land mines championed by
Britain's Princess Diana who visited this war-devastated African
nation last year.
	   David Ginola, a French international who plays for England's
Tottenham Hotspur and is a part-time model, announced in July that
he had agreed to be the public face of the campaign on behalf of
the International Committee for the Red Cross.
	   Ginola's visit comes a year to the day after Princess Diana died
in a car crash in Paris.
	   ``I've come to carry forward the cause of Princess Diana,''
Ginola told reporters on his arrival at Luanda airport.
	   ``We have to keep raising the world's awareness to keep Princess
Diana's project alive, so that one day we can end this scourge
which is land mines,'' he said.
	   Princess Diana, who helped give the anti-mine crusade huge
worldwide publicity, visited in Jan. 1997 and was photographed in a
blue flak jacket and visor used by the mine clearance crews.
	   Angola, which was ravaged by a two-decade civil war that erupted
after its 1975 independence from Portugal, is thought to have
between 9 and 20 million mines concealed in its soil, making it one
of the world's most mined countries.
	   Crews have removed only about 1 million mines since the
government and rebels signed a peace agreement in 1994, according
to the ICRC.
	   Ginola was Monday scheduled to visit an orthopedic center where
artifical limbs are made in Kuito, 500 kilometers (300 miles)
southeast of Luanda.
	   He was due to visit a mine clearance operation and speak to
amputees Tuesday in the second-largest city Huambo, near Kuito,
before returning to the capital for talks with government officials
on Wednesday.
	   Ginola's visit, his first foreign trip on behalf of the ICRC
campaign, coincided with a crisis in the implementation of the
peace pact.
	   Skirmishes between police and the remnants of the rebels'
guerrilla army, and general lawlessness in remote areas, have
forced the ICRC to curtail its land mine clearance program.
	   Clearance teams are now working only in provincial capitals,
according to the ICRC which also reported that new minefields are
being laid by unidentified groups.

Arafat, Hassan reaffirm support for U.S. plan on West Bank

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and
Jordan's Crown Prince Hassan on Monday reiterated support for a
U.S. proposal calling for an Israeli pullout from a further 13.1
percent of the West Bank.
	   But both declined to say if they reject a variation of the
proposal put forward by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
last week. The proposal commits Israel to cede 10 percent of the
West bank to the Palestinian and declare the remaining 3 percent as
``nature reserves'' where Palestinian power would be limited.
	   ``We stick to the American proposal,'' Arafat told a news
conference. Standing next to him, Hassan nodded in consent.
	   Arafat accused Israel of ``procrastination and placing hurdles
in the way of the American proposal'' and stressed that the
Palestinians ``are committed to a peaceful settlement ... as a
strategic option.''
	   He, however, acknowledged that there was ``no doubt, some
progress'' in peace negotiations with Israel. He declined to
elaborate.
	   Hassan reaffirmed that Jordan will use its influence with Israel
since signing a peace treaty in 1994 to help the Palestinians until
``an entity and the independent state emerge.''
	   A joint statement issued after a three-hour meeting between
Hassan and Arafat said they discussed ways to end the peace
stalemate and improve coordination with Egypt, which besides Jordan
is the only Arab nation at peace with Israel.
	   Earlier, Arafat's representative in Jordan, Omar Khatib, said
the Hassan-Arafat talks would focus on the worsening humanitarian
conditions in the West Bank city of Hebron as a result of an
Israeli curfew.
	   Hebron, a city of 120,000 placed mostly under Palestinian rule
since January 1997, was sealed off by Israeli forces following the
Aug. 20 fatal stabbing of Rabbi Shlomo Raanan, 63, in an isolated
section of a Jewish settlement. The curfew was lifted Sunday.
	   Arafat was also expected to have asked Hassan to provide the
Palestinian Authority with maps of government estates that Jordan
maintained in the West Bank before 1967. Jordan ruled the West Bank
from 1950 until Israel seized it in the 1967 Middle East War.
	   Arafat returned to Ramallah after the talks en route to the
Nonaligned Movement summit in Durban, South Africa.
	   Hassan is acting as regent in the absence of King Hussein who is
undergoing cancer treatment in the United States.

corruption &QL; 
 &UR; With BRU-101 &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT WIELAARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The cream of Belgian socialists in the
1980s _ foremost among them ex-NATO chief Willy Claes _ goes on
trial Wednesday on corruption charges stemming from defense
contracts in the late 1980s.
	   The high court hearings _ in an ornate courtroom that has
undergone a dlrs 500,000 face-lift for the occasion _ will last
several months.
	   Allegations that and nine others pocketed millions of dollars in
bribes has generated massive media coverage creating a mood akin to
the one that gripped Italy in 1992 when its long-dominant Christian
Democrats disappeared under the weight of corruption scandals.
	   ``We start to look a little bit like the Italians,'' according
to Rik de Cauwelaert, a political analyst. ``This is the trial of
an old political regime.''
	   Claes and his fellow defendants deny any wrongdoing. Claes quit
as NATO secretary general Oct. 19, 1995 because of corruption
charges dating back to his days as economics minister.
	   On trial with him will be ex-defense minister Guy Coeme,
ex-deputy prime minister Guy Spitaels and senior officials of
Belgium's Dutch and French-speaking socialist parties.
	   They are accused of taking bribes in exchange for awarding two
defense contracts: an 8-billion-franc (dlrs 216.2-million) deal
awarded Dec. 8, 1988 to Italy's Agusta SpA for 46 army helicopters
and _ on April 28, 1989 and worth 6.5 billion francs (dlrs 175.6
million) _ a deal for Electronique Serge Dassault, a subsidiary of
France's Dassault Aviation SA, to equip Belgian F-16 jets with new
electronics.
	   Prosecutors allege Agusta paid 51 million francs (dlrs 1.37
million) and Dassault 60 million francs (dlrs 1.62 million) in
bribes to Dutch and French-speaking socialists who are split into
separate parties.
	   Serge Dassault of Dassault Aviation is also a defendant. Charges
have been dropped against ex-Agusta executive Raffaelo Teti who
died Aug. 22 of a heart attack.
	   Prosecutors allege the defendants and the companies conspired to
funnel money from Swiss banks into socialist pockets through
Luxembourg banks and phony companies and foundations.
	   Until 1989, it was legal for companies to give money to Belgian
political parties provided they did not demand and get favors in
return.
	   Prosecutors must show the Agusta and Dassault ``gifts'' were so
closely timed to the awarding of the defense contracts that they
just had to be bribes and senior officials, including Claes, had to
know that.
	   In 1989, Belgium outlawed corporate donations to politicians and
instituted government subsidies and put a ceiling on campaign
spending. In 1998, these subsidies total 640 million francs (dlrs
17.3 million).
	   Agusta and Dassault, it was argued at the time, won their
contracts because they offered better economic compensation than
their rivals _ respectively France's Aerospatiale SA and Litton
Industries Inc. of the United States.
	   Dassault won the F-16 deal although Litton's bid was cheaper and
preferred by the military. Prosecutors now say economic
compensation talks with Dassault never took place.
	   Claes, Coeme and Spitaels have long been linked to political and
financial scandals.
	   Coeme, the former defense minister, got a two-year suspended
jail term in 1996 for corruption involving a socialist polling
institute that was overpaid for doing unnecessary,
politically-tainted surveys for the government.
	   The fate of Belgian socialists is not identical to that of
Italian christian democrats in 1992. Regardless of what happens to
Claes and the others, socialists remain very much in power.
	   They are the coalition partners of Prime Minister Jean-Luc
Dehaene's christian democrats.
	   Only days before the trial, leaders of the French-speaking
socialists denied charges they sought to intimidate the defendants
by urging them not to divulge too much. `Knack' magazine reported
that in return for such discretion, the party would pay their legal
bills

	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, visiting Sarajevo,
told reporters she was also alarmed by the test launch.
	   ``This is something that we will be raising with North Koreans
in the talks that are currently going on,'' she said.
	   Those talks, in New York, are over a proposal for the North to
suspend missile development in exchange for nuclear energy
know-how, and some Korea watchers said they suspect the launch was
timed to up the stakes.
	   ``Kim is good at brinksmanship,'' said Hajime Izumi, a noted
North Korea watcher and professor at Shizuoka University, referring
to North Korea's leader Kim Jong Il.
	   ``This shows that North Korea can make effective missiles,'' he
added. ``What remains to be seen is if they can mass produce them,
or deploy them.''
	   Masahiro Akiyama, deputy director of Japan's Defense Agency,
said the launch was not totally a surprise _ security experts, he
said, had been increasing their surveillance of the North since
earlier this month.
	   Stalinist North Korea, which over the past few years has been
foundering under devastating famines, is to convene its newly
elected parliament on Sept. 5, and are expected to elect Kim as the
country's president.
	   In June, North Korea also admitted for the first time that it
has sold missiles abroad. It had long been suspected of selling
missiles to Iran and Syria.

Polish president: dispute over crosses at Auschwitz will soon end
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) - The Polish president said in a letter made
public Monday that he believes the dispute with Jewish groups over
the placing of crosses at the Auschwitz death camp will soon be
resolved.
	   Israel and Jewish organizations were angered by what they saw as
attempts to turn Auschwitz, where more than 1 million Jews perished
in the Holocaust in World War II, into a Christian shrine.
	   A Carmelite monastery erected at Auschwitz in memory of the
Polish Christians who also died there was removed after protests by
the Jewish organizations.
	   However, a huge cross was left on the site where the monastery
stood. Later, Roman Catholics erected smaller crosses near
Auschwitz, at a place where Jewish children were burned alive
shortly before the camp was liberated by the Russians. These
crosses were also removed after Jewish protests.
	   More recently militant Catholic groups have been planting small
crosses beside the big one.
	   Polish President Aleksander Kwasniewski's letter was sent to
Avner Shalev, director of the Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial in
Jerusalem. Kwasniewski wrote that the issue of the crosses is
``more troublesome (because) for two years we have been
successfully developing Jewish-Polish dialogue.''
	   ``A return to the status quo ante is undoubtedly a precondition
for solving this difficult situation,'' he added.
	   Shalev said this means that the Polish authorities are prepared
to remove the small crosses but not the big one.
	   ``The status quo ante means the situation which existed when
Auschwitz was accepted by UNESCO for its list of the world's
cultural heritage sites,'' Shalev said.
	   One of the conditions for acceptance was that there should be no
religious symbols at the site, Shalev explained. The big cross is
located just outside the death camp.
	   ``We are not satisfied with the status quo ante but it is
certainly better than the present situation,'' he said.

	   But very little is known about North Korea's missile program,
and its possession of a significantly better missile would be a
matter of serious concern throughout the region.
	   North Korea's best-known ballistic missile is the Rodong, which
has a range of about 1,000 kilometers (620 miles). It was last test
fired in 1993, and also landed in the same area of the Sea of
Japan, which divides the Korean Peninsula from Japan.
	   With its 1,000 kilometer (620-mile range), the Rodong I missile,
a modified Scud, could strike South Korea and much of Japan. The
newer missile would put even more of Japan within range.
	   In 1996, the United States began talks with North Korea aimed at
persuading the secretive Communist country to freeze its missile
program and to join an international agreement designed to restrict
missile proliferation. The talks stalled.
	   Japan is currently boosting its budget for joint development of
a missile defense system with the United States, and has reportedly
earmarked 500 million yen (dlrs 3.6 million) for the project next
year.
	   The United States has 37,000 troops stationed in South Korea,
many of them based near its border with North Korea. It has roughly
another 50,000 troops in Japan.
	   Monday's was the secretive North's fourth test-firing of a
missile since 1984 and its first in five years.

U.S. envoy: The scale of criminal activity in Kosovo unacceptable
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL; 
 &UR; By SNJEZANA VUKIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ President Clinton's special envoy for war
crimes issues said Monday he was refused permission to visit
Yugoslavia to look into alleged atrocities against civilians in
Kosovo province.
	   The official, David Scheffer, said Belgrade's refusal to grant
him a visa ``indicates once again that government's insecurity
about its own accountability under international laws.''
	   ``What is disturbing is that we do not know the full extent of
these activities, particularly killing of the innocent civilians,
yet,'' Scheffer told reporters in Zagreb, capital of Croatia.
	   Scheffer said he had planned to visit the Yugoslav capital
Belgrade and Kosovo, a province of the main Yugoslav republic,
Serbia, last week as part of U.S. efforts to end the violence which
threatens tens of thousands of civilians.
	   Scheffer said the Serb crackdown on the secessionist Kosovo
Liberation Army exceeds ``any military necessity.''
	   ``We need to remind those Serb forces and police, who swagger
through villages, intentionally torching civilian houses, that
they're acting illegally and will be subject to international
investigation and prosecution,'' he said.
	   He noted that the U.N. war crimes tribunal for the former
Yugoslavia, based in The Hague, Netherlands, has jurisdiction to
investigate war crimes and crimes against humanity in Kosovo.
	   ``The combatants and their leaders need to know that the U.S.
and the U.N. tribunal are watching their conduct ... and justice
will have to be rendered.'' he said.
	   Scheffer, who is to meet the chief U.N. prosecutor Louise Arbour
on Tuesday, said he trusted the tribunal's investigators and
forensic experts would be given access to Kosovo.
	   The scale of criminal activities in Kosovo is ``unacceptable,''
he said, adding that the United States was primarily concerned
about the role of Serb police and internal security forces in the
crackdown.
	   One-third of Kosovo villages have been damaged by military
action since July 26, he said, demonstrating that the Serb forces
``have increased their assault on civilian settlements and
intentionally damaged civilian structures.''
	   ``The fact that much of the damage has occurred in the areas
where there was no appreciable combat, and frequently well after
occupation by the Serbs, suggest a punitive rather than military
motivation for much of the destruction,'' he said. ``The scale of
damage is disproportional to any combat in the affected areas and
clearly exceeds significantly any military necessity,'' he said.
	   He said the forced displacement of an estimated 250,000 Kosovo
Albanians ``cannot be justified under any military doctrine.''
	   Scheffer also expressed concern over allegations that KLA
fighters had killed Serb civilians in the village of Klecka, a
charge which the rebels deny.

Former au pair Louise Woodward turns tables and tries the media
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with quotes from Woodward and attorney &QL; 
 &UR; By MAUREEN JOHNSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   EDINBURGH, Scotland (AP) _ Her trial attracted a global
television audience. Now Louise Woodward, the former au pair
convicted of killing an American baby, has turned the tables and
put television on trial. Her verdict: television added to the
stress and notoriety with which she now has to live.
	   ``I am just trying to be a normal 20 year old, trying to be a
normal person, and people won't let me do that,'' she told hundreds
of TV producers and executives Monday during a debate on allowing
TV cameras into court at the Edinburgh International Television
Festival.
	   Arguing that cameras in court turn trials into entertainment,
Woodward said: ``People don't seem to be able to distinguish
between celebrity and notoreity. They ask for autographs and
photographs and things. They ask me to sign baseball caps, which I
find ridiculous.''
	   Ms. Woodward, the first British woman to have a trial shown on
live TV, returned home June 18 after a Massachusetts court upheld
her conviction of involuntary manslaughter in the death of
8-month-old Matthew Eappen. He died Feb. 9, 1997, after suffering
injuries while in her care.
	   Since her return, Ms. Woodward has given one television
interview _ to the BBC, in which she reiterated her claims of
innocence _ and otherwise disappeared from public view.
	   Appearing calm and composed and wearing a smart black suit, Ms.
Woodward said she turns down dozens of requests for interviews on
everything from when she plans to go to university to where she has
her hair done.
	   If she had the choice, she said she would have refused to have
television cameras in the courtroom in Massachusetts, where they
are mandatory.
	   But asked if she thought that the millions of people who watched
the trial were wrong to do so, she laughed and said: ``I don't
know. I think I would have watched it, too.''
	   Ms. Woodward appeared on the panel with one of her American
lawyers, Barry Sheck, who was part of the legal team that won an
acquittal for football star O.J. Simpson on charges of murdering
his wife and a friend.
	   Scheck said the problem was not having TV cameras in court, but
the nature of the coverage _ and in Ms. Woodward's case the
coverage ``made things worse.''
	   He cited debates on TV in the middle of the trial, and
maintained that the jurors were distracted from the scientific
evidence which he said was the core of the case.
	   Instead of focusing on the scientific evidence, he said, ``the
issue was should two full-time professionals hire child care in the
fashion that the Eappons did.''
	   He said this generated a public debate, with views being aired
such as ``no wonder she snapped.''
	   ``Those were the people who were supposed to be on our side,''
he added to laughter.
	   To many on this side of the Atlantic, the unprecedented sight of
a young British woman being tried live on TV both fascinated and
appalled.
	   Scheck said he favored cameras in the court if all parties
agree, but Ms. Woodward said she opposed all cameras in court and
wouldn't want them in Britain where they are banned.
	   Ms. Woodward has promised not to accept any money for her story.
	   Organizers stressed that she would get no fee for her appearance
Monday.

Rio Ferdinand doubtful for Euro qualifier vs. Sweden
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BISHAM, ABBEY, England (AP) _ West Ham defender Rio Ferdinand is
doubtful for Saturday's European Championship qualifier against
Sweden, England coach Glenn Hoddle said Monday.
	   Ferdinand, who suffered a groin injury in Saturday's Premier
League game against Coventry, skipped practice Monday along with
Steve McManaman and Ray Parlour _ both with leg injuries.
	   ``He (Ferdinand) has had this problem all season and is feeling
rather tender,'' Hoddle said. ``At this moment in time I would say
there is a doubt about him for Sweden.''
	   ``McManaman will be having a scan to make sure there is no
problem but we are hoping that Parlour's leg problem will settle
down,'' Hoddle added.
	   Manchester United midfielder Nicky Butt has already withdrawn
and will have dental surgery Tuesday.
	   Hoddle predicted a difficult match against the Swedes, one of 22
games that open qualifying for the 2000 European Championship.
Fifteen matches are set for Saturday and six for Sunday.
	   A lone game will be played Wednesday when Lichtenstein goes to
Romania.
	   ``Sweden have had some excellent results recently,'' Hoddle
said. ``They have beaten Italy, Russia and Denmark as well as
drawing with world champions France. I know they've only been
friendly matches but that's still a good pedigree.
	   ``We know going to Stockholm, as England have found in the past,
is tough and it will be a very difficult game for us.''

No right to absolute peace, Swiss court rules
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ The silence-loving Swiss have no
right to absolute quiet, the country's supreme court said in a
ruling published Monday.
	   The Federal Tribunal rejected a claim by a plaintiff in the
northern canton (state) of Schaffhausen that a bird-scaring device
in a vineyard over the state line in Zurich constituted an illegal
disturbance.
	   Noise is only a disturbance when it damages the well-being of a
substantial proportion of the local population, the judges ruled.
After a court delegation visited the plaintiff's property, 300
meters (yards) from the vineyard across the Rhine river, they
decided that was not the case.
	   The court said the fact no other complaints had been received
about the device, which emits bird sounds and around 60 gunshot
noises per hour, contributed to its decision.
	   The owner couldn't reasonably be expected to give up protecting
his vines or to replace the bird scarer with expensive netting that
could snare birds and small animals, the court added.
	   Zurich state authorities allow the use of the bird-scaring
machine between 7 a.m. and 8 p.m. during two months of the year.
	   The Swiss have frequently been known to complain to police over
loud music from parties and even over neighbors taking showers
after 10 p.m.

Israel closes Palestinian Authority office in Hebron
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NASSER SHIYOUKHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Israeli troops on Monday closed a
Palestinian Authority office in the Israeli-controlled sector of
Hebron, saying it had been opened without Israeli permission.
	   Hebron Mayor Mustafa Natche said the army had no right to shut
down the office. He said under peace accords with Israel, the
Palestinians retained control over civil affairs in all of Hebron,
which is home to 130,000 Palestinians and 450 Jewish settlers.
	   Employees sat outside the Palestinian Supplies Ministry office,
which supervises food wholesalers and grocers, in protest for
several hours.
	   The new dispute came at a time when tensions were still running
high following the Aug. 20 killing of a prominent Jewish settler,
apparently by Palestinian militants. In response to the slaying,
settlers have repeatedly beaten and stoned Palestinian passers-by.
	   Also Monday, a Palestinian peace negotiator denied an Israel
radio report that Israel and the Palestinians had reached a draft
agreement on how to use some of the land Israel is to hand over in
a future troop withdrawal.
	   Israel has agreed in principle to withdraw from 13 percent of
the West Bank, provided that 3 percent is set aside as a ``nature
reserve'' in which Israel retains control over security and
Palestinian land use is restricted.
	   The radio said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's envoy,
attorney Yitzhak Molcho, and Palestinian Parliament Speaker Ahmed
Qureia wrote a draft agreement regarding the division of authority
between Israelis and Palestinians in the nature reserve.
	   However, Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour said there was no
agreement with the Israelis and that the gaps remained wide.
	   Under a U.S. proposal first submitted in January, Israel was to
withdraw from 13 percent of the West Bank. ``We don't agree that
the 13 percent be broken up,'' Asfour said.
	   The 13 percent pullback was to be the second of three to which
Israel committed itself in a U.S.-brokered 1997 agreement with the
Palestinians. Under that accord, Monday was to have been the
deadline for completing the third withdrawal.
	   In a letter to U.S. President Bill Clinton, Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat asked for renewed assurances that the United States
will hold Israel to its promise of three pullbacks, Israeli
newspapers reported Monday.

North Korean missile flies over Japan and lands in Pacific: Report
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: COMBINES urgent series

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ North Korea fired a ballistic missile over
northeasten Japan on Monday that landed into the Pacific Ocean,
news reports said, quoting Japan's Defense Agency.
	   The first stage of the missile landed in waters between Russia
and Japan, but the second stage flew over Japanese territory and
fell into the Pacific Ocean, Kyodo News said, citing agency
sources.
	   A spokesman at Japan's Defense Agency, Terao Toshihiko, said
that the government was still trying to confirm the exact location
of the landing.
	   The launch just after noon (0300 GMT) was confirmed by Japanese,
South Korean and United States defense officials. It was North
Korea's first test-firing of a missile in five years and its fourth
since 1984.
	   In response, Japan Monday refused to back a long-planned
agreement to help fund two nuclear reactors for North Korea.
	   Japan's Defense Agency, quoting unidentified U.S. military
officials, said the missile was probably aimed at waters between
Russia and Japan and landed 300 kilometers (190 miles) southeast of
Vladivostok, Russia.
	   The missile was ``confirmed to be a brand-new `Daepodong I' with
a range of 2,000 kilometers (1,240 miles),'' the South Korean
Defense Ministry said in a statement.
	   That range is twice as long as the North's previous staple
``Rodong'' series missiles.
	   ``We see this as a very dangerous act,'' said chief government
spokesman Hiromu Nonaka. He said Japan would express its concern to
the North through diplomatic channels.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, visiting Sarajevo,
told reporters she was also alarmed by the test launch.
	   ``This is something that we will be raising with North Koreans
in the talks that are currently going on,'' she said.
	   Those talks, in New York, are over a proposal for the North to
suspend missile development in exchange for nuclear energy
know-how, and some Korea watchers said they suspect the launch was
timed to up the stakes.
	   ``Kim is good at brinksmanship,'' said Hajime Izumi, a noted
North Korea watcher and professor at Shizuoka University, referring
to North Korea's leader Kim Jong Il.
	   ``This shows that North Korea can make effective missiles,'' he
added. ``What remains to be seen is if they can mass produce them,
or deploy them.''
	   Masahiro Akiyama, deputy director of Japan's Defense Agency,
said the launch was not totally a surprise _ security experts, he
said, had been increasing their surveillance of the North since
earlier this month.
	   Stalinist North Korea, which over the past few years has been
foundering under devastating famines, is to convene its newly
elected parliament on Sept. 5, and are expected to elect Kim as the
country's president.
	   In June, North Korea also admitted for the first time that it
has sold missiles abroad. It had long been suspected of selling
missiles to Iran and Syria.
	   But very little is known about North Korea's missile program,
and its possession of a significantly better missile would be a
matter of serious concern throughout the region.
	   North Korea's best-known ballistic missile is the Rodong, which
has a range of about 1,000 kilometers (620 miles). It was last test
fired in 1993, and also landed in the same area of the Sea of
Japan, which divides the Korean Peninsula from Japan.
	   With its 1,000 kilometer (620-mile range), the Rodong I missile,
a modified Scud, could strike South Korea and much of Japan. The
newer missile would put most of Japan within range.
	   In 1996, the United States began talks with North Korea aimed at
persuading the secretive Communist country to freeze its missile
program and to join an international agreement designed to restrict
missile proliferation. The talks stalled.
	   Japan is currently boosting its budget for joint development of
a missile defense system with the United States and has reportedly
earmarked 500 million yen (dlrs 3.6 million) for the project next
year.
	   The United States has 37,000 troops stationed in South Korea,
many of them based near its border with North Korea. It has roughly
another 50,000 troops in Japan.
	   Monday's was the secretive North's fourth test-firing of a
missile since 1984 and its first in five years.

Briton accused of 'road rage' killing held in solitary confinement
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CADIZ, Spain (AP)_ Briton Kenneth Noye was being held in
solitary confinement Monday in southern Spain while Britain
prepared a request for his extradition to face charges in a
so-called 'road rage' killing in London.
	   The British Embassy in Madrid said that under the countries'
bilateral extradition treaty, Britain has 40 days to seek
extradition of Noye, 51, who was arrested Friday night near the
town of Tarifa after a two-year man hunt.
	   He is being held in a high-security prison near the coastal city
of Cadiz.
	   Noye faces charges of stabbing 21-year-old Stephen Cameron to
death in May, 1996 after getting into an argument with him at an
entry road to the busy six-lane highway that encircles London.
	   Cameron's girlfriend, who was driving the car in which Cameron
was traveling, says it all started when she had to brake suddenly.
	   Noye can fight extradition by arguing a lack of evidence, a
spokesman for the National Court in Madrid said.

Ukraine to repay its gas debt to Russia by October
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine is negotiating terms with Russia's
gas giant Gazprom to fully repay its gas debt to Russia within a
month, a top industry official said Monday.
	   ``We have reached complete understanding with Gazprom on the
ways to pay our debt, and we should have no gas debt to Russia at
the beginning of October,'' said Ihor Bakai, who heads Ukraine's
gas monopoly Naftogaz Ukrainy.
	   Ukraine's mounting gas debt to Russia has been among the
thorniest issues in the two countries' relations over the past few
years. The former Soviet republic, which relies on Russia for 80
percent of its oil and gas supplies, has sought to diversify its
energy sources, but with little success.
	   The government's debt to Gazprom stands at dlrs 700 million,
while private Ukrainian gas traders owe the Russian giant several
hundred million, Bakai said.
	   Bakai said most of the debt would be covered by supplying
various commodities and paying some dlrs 90 million in cash to
Russia.
	   Gazprom officials said earlier this year that their company was
interested in receiving Ukrainian underground gas depots, parts of
gas mains and related industrial objects as payment for some of the
debt.
	   Bakai said Naftogaz has reached a preliminary agreement with
Gazprom to import gas in 1998 at a ``much lower price'' than this
year's dlrs 80 per 1,000 cubic meters (35,314 cubic feet). Ukraine
will also cut its gas consumption by about 10 percent next year,
Bakai said.

Sudan-U.S., Congo, nuclear weapons testings issues at summit

	   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) _ Sudan's foreign minister said Monday
that if Washington acknowledged its error in bombing a factory in
Khartoum, Sudan was prepared ``to turn the page.''
	   Washington's attacks on targets in Sudan and Afghanistan - a
reprisal for the bombings of two U.S. embassies in Africa - was a
hot issue Monday at a summit of the Nonaligned Movement.
	   A movement committee on Sunday called for an independent
investigation of whether the factory hit by U.S. missiles was a
chemical weapons plant, as Washington claims, or a pharmaceutical
factory, as Sudan maintained.
	   ``We feel that what was passed yesterday was a step forward to
introduce justice,'' Sudanese foreign Minister Mustafa Osman Ismail
told The Associated Press.
	   ``We are open to turn the page against the U.S.A. if they
acknowledge they got wrong information'' about the nature of the
plant, he said at an earlier news conference.
	   There was no immediate reaction from the United States' first
official observer to a NAM summit, diplomat Princeton Lyman, who
stayed away from reporters.
	   In a news conference earlier, Ismail said Sudan would not
respond with an attack for the bombing of the Khartoum factory,
saying Sudan would reply through forums like the NAM and the United
Nations and if necessary, seek a hearing at the International Court
of Justice in the Hague, Netherlands.
	   The movement's 12th summit is pulling together an expected 52
heads of state and representatives of about 100 nations in all.
Heads of state meet Wednesday and Thursday. Formed during the
height of the Cold War to fend off domination by the White House
and the Kremlin, the movement is now struggling to define a new
role.
	   South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, welcoming foreign
ministers to the summit, said the Nonaligned Movement should
advance the cause of the poor.
	   ``The world economy should be managed in a way that ensures the
transfer of resources from those who have them to those that do
not,'' he said, noting that rich countries have no moral imperative
to share their wealth.
	   ``The new God of our world, the market, is not informed by a
tablet of commandments on which is inscribed: `Thou shalt banish
poverty in the world.' ''
	   Other summit topics include the war in Congo, in which rebels
allegedly supported by Rwanda and Uganda, are fighting President
Laurent Kabila's forces, which are being backed by soldiers from
Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia.
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan planned to meet at the summit
with regional leaders on the Congo Congo crisis.
	   Delegates from India and Pakistan said they hoped to hold
bilateral talks on the recent nuclear arms testing by both
countries.
	   `Pakistani Foreign Minister Sartag Aziz essentially ruled out
any nuclear disarmament unless the dispute over Kashmir, a region
claimed by both India and Pakistan, is settled.
	   ``We don't want to engage in a nuclear arms race,'' Aziz said in
an interview. ``But for a nuclear stand down, we must deal with the
underlying issues.''
	   Indian foreign Minister Sasundhara Raje said she wanted further
talks on a moratorium on building nuclear weapons, and a ban on
first-strike use of the weapons.
	   ``I think that at the end of the day, we will be able to work
out a solution'' she told AP.

EU to retarget assistance for crisis-hit Russia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union said Monday it will
look this week at how it can help ease Russia's financial situation
by retargeting its aid program for the country.
	   European Commission spokeswoman Lousewies van der Laan said
funds will probably be spent more on sending experts to develop
legal and technical assistance, and less on projects where it's
more difficult to control where the money goes.
	   ``Wherever we can help we are available to help, but if basic
reforms are not on the way, there is very little we can do to
improve the situation,'' Van der Laan said.
	   Between 1991 and 1997 the Commission, the EU's executive body,
committed around dlrs 1.2 billion to projects in Russia through its
Tacis aid program for the former Soviet Union and Mongolia. Russia
receivers over half the total aid to the 16 nations.
	   On Thursday the 20-member Commission will discuss the economic
and financial situation in Russia during its weekly meeting.
	   The EU's Commissioner for Monetary Affairs has also floated the
idea of convening EU finance ministers ahead of their next
scheduled meeting on Sept. 25, to discuss the Russian crisis, his
spokesman Patrick Child said.
	   De Silguy on Monday remained optimistic about the impact the
crisis will have on EU countries, saying on French radio he sees no
reason to revise the EU's growth forecasts.
	   ``All the lights are green now and I don't see any reason in
particular to become alarmed about the economic situation in
Europe,'' he said.
	   The EU is the single largest donor in the former Soviet states.

Serb women stone US building in protest; Yugoslavia refuses visa to
</HEADLINE>
US envoy &QL; 
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ About 200 angry Serb women pelted
the U.S. information office with stones Monday to protest the
killing of Serb civilians, allegedly by Albanian rebels fighting
for independence of Kosovo province.
	   President Bill Clinton's special envoy on war crimes issues told
reporters Monday in the Croatian capital Zagreb that the Yugoslav
government refused to let him visit the country to investigate
alleged abuses in Kosovo, including ``alleged criminal conduct'' by
Albanian rebels and Serb security forces.
	   The envoy, David Scheffer, said Belgrade's refusal to grant him
a visa ``indicates once again that government's insecurity about
its own accountability under international laws.''
	   Allegations of abuse by both Serb forces and Albanian guerrillas
escalated over the weekend after Serbian police said they had
discovered a crematory in the village of Klecka, where ethnic
Albanians allegedly had burned the bodies of at least 22 Serbs,
including women and children.
	   The rebel Kosovo Liberation Army has denied any role in the
killings.
	   On Monday, about 200 Serb women marched to the U.S. Information
Service in Pristina and demanded that an American official come
speak to the. When no one responded, the women shouted ``fascists''
and ``murderers'' and began hurling stones at the building.
	   ``This is Serbia,'' shouted one of the women. ``Look at them,
high and mighty democrats! They can't come out and talk to us. They
only want to talk to (ethnic) Albanian politicians!''
	   Despite appeals by a security guard, the women shook the iron
fence around the compound for a few moments and then marched off
toward the offices of the International Committee of the Red Cross.
	   Serb officials have accused the United States and international
agencies of favoring the Albanians, who compromise 90 percent of
Kosovo's 2 million inhabitants.
	   Since the government launched its crackdown in February against
the KLA, international attention has focused on the suffering of
tens of thousands of ethnic Albanians who have fled their homes in
advance of Serb forces.
	   But the discovery of human remains at Klecka, a former KLA
stronghold southwest of Pristina, has underscored the impact of the
conflict on civilians from both sides.
	   In a statement published Monday by an Albanian language
newspaper, the KLA denied its members had committed atrocities in
Klecka and claimed witnesses produced by Serb authorities were
``smugglers who have have often cooperated'' with the government.
	   The KLA claimed the bodies ``exhibited in front of television
cameras'' were probably Albanian civilians killed by the Serbs.
	   Serbian police and the Yugoslav army have been trying to crush
the independence effort. Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the
dominant Yugoslav republic.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed on both sides, and more than
260,000 have been rendered homeless by the fighting. Western
government have threatened to use force against the Serbs to stop
the offensive, but have yet to follow through.
	   Serb government forces have driven KLA fighters from much of the
at least 30 percent of Kosovo territory the rebels once controlled.
	   In Belgrade, Serbian Vice Premier Tomislav Nikolic claimed
Sunday that the Kosovo rebels had been all but defeated. ``That
gang no longer exists, it has been broken down into small groups
which commit atrocities,'' he said.

EU annual inflation rate slips to 1.5 percent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union's annual inflation
rate fell to 1.5 percent in July, down from 1.6 percent in July,
1997, the EU's statistics agency Eurostat reported on Monday.
	   It added that inflation in the 11 countries that will take part
in a single European currency as of next January, remained stable
at 1.4 percent.
	   Eurostat said the inflation rate of 1.5 percent in July for all
15 EU nations compared with 1.7 percent that month for the United
States.
	   The highest rates in July were registered in Greece (4.8
percent), Portugal (2.8 percent) and Ireland (2.5 percent) while
lowest were France and Austria (both 0.8 percent) and Germany (0.9
percent).
	   Compared with a year earlier, the larger increases occurred in
Portugal (from 1.4 to 2.8 percent) and Ireland (from 1.5 to 2.5
percent), while it dropped the most in Germany (1.5 to 0.9 percent)
and Belgium (1.9 to 1.2 percent), Eurostat said.
	   It gave these other figures for July (July, 1997, figures in
brackets): Spain, 2.3 (1.5); France, 0.8 (1.1); Italy, 2.1 (1.7);
Luxembourg, 1.2 (1.3); Netherlands, 1.8 (1.9); Austria, 0.8 (0.9);

Former au pair Louise Woodward turns tables and tries the media

 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS spelling of Scheck in graf 9 and notoriety in graf 3 &QL; 
 &UR; By MAUREEN JOHNSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   EDINBURGH, Scotland (AP) _ Her trial attracted a global
television audience. Now Louise Woodward, the former au pair
convicted of killing an American baby, has turned the tables and
put television on trial. Her verdict: television added to the
stress and notoriety with which she now has to live.
	   ``I am just trying to be a normal 20 year old, trying to be a
normal person, and people won't let me do that,'' she told hundreds
of TV producers and executives Monday during a debate on allowing
TV cameras into court at the Edinburgh International Television
Festival.
	   Arguing that cameras in court turn trials into entertainment,
Woodward said: ``People don't seem to be able to distinguish
between celebrity and notoriety. They ask for autographs and
photographs and things. They ask me to sign baseball caps, which I
find ridiculous.''
	   Ms. Woodward, the first British woman to have a trial shown on
live TV, returned home June 18 after a Massachusetts court upheld
her conviction of involuntary manslaughter in the death of
8-month-old Matthew Eappen. He died Feb. 9, 1997, after suffering
injuries while in her care.
	   Since her return, Ms. Woodward has given one television
interview _ to the BBC, in which she reiterated her claims of
innocence _ and otherwise disappeared from public view.
	   Appearing calm and composed and wearing a smart black suit, Ms.
Woodward said she turns down dozens of requests for interviews on
everything from when she plans to go to university to where she has
her hair done.
	   If she had the choice, she said she would have refused to have
television cameras in the courtroom in Massachusetts, where they
are mandatory.
	   But asked if she thought that the millions of people who watched
the trial were wrong to do so, she laughed and said: ``I don't
know. I think I would have watched it, too.''
	   Ms. Woodward appeared on the panel with one of her American
lawyers, Barry Scheck, who was part of the legal team that won an
acquittal for football star O.J. Simpson on charges of murdering
his wife and a friend.

Russians buying more, but banks, stores remain calm
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS lead to CLARIFY that only scattered lines at banks,
UPDATES in new grafs 6-8 with SBS-Agro bank suspending operations;
CORRECTS style to Lydia sted Lidiya in graf 12. &QL; 
 &UR; By NICK WADHAMS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Olga Makarova sat in the lobby of one of Russia's
troubled banks, waiting at the end of a long line to withdraw her
money.
	   ``I'll probably be here until evening,'' grumbled the
65-year-old pensioner, who has two separate bank accounts, in
rubles and in dollars. ``But people are getting their money, even
if it is slowly.''
	   Makarova was among 30 people at the MOST-Bank branch waiting for
money, but there was little sign of panic in the face of Russia's
financial crisis as the bank slowly fulfilled its obligations.
	   She tried to remain philosophical about the latest run on the
banks. ``We've been afraid for our lives so often that I've got no
fear left,'' she said.
	   That attitude seemed prevalent, with people wary about the
economy but not panicking.
	   Adding to the worries, another large bank, SBS-Agro, said Monday
that it had discontinued operations in all of its branches in the
cities of Moscow and Serpukhov and was setting up a temporary
settlement system.
	   Russia's Central Bank took control of SBS-Agro last week and
declared a two-week ``bank holiday'' to evaluate SBS-Agro's
financial situation and draw up an action plan to normalize its
operations.
	   SBS-Agro, which has an extensive retail network, said it was
setting up a structure to settle payments manually while it remains
cut off from its electronic settlement system.
	   Trading on Russia's stock market was almost nonexistent Monday.
Traders were waiting to see whether the lower house of parliament,
the State Duma, would approve Victor Chernomyrdin as prime
minister.
	   The ruble even gained strength at street exchange points,
selling at around nine to the dollar _ down from more than 12
rubles at the end of last week and nearer the Central Bank's set
exchange rate of 7.86.
	   Still, in some shops, prices for both Russian and import goods
were up in reaction to the ruble's tumble last week, and shop
owners reported occasional instances of hoarding.
	   ``All our prices have gone up about 25 percent,'' said Lydia
Berukova, while she supervised the arrival of Russian-made sausage
and cheese at her small supermarket. ``Last week people bought
everything up because they knew that goods were going to be more
costly.''
	   But in others, shop owners reported little change in buying
patterns.
	   ``People don't know what's going to happen in a week,'' said
26-year-old clerk Mikhail Taraskin during a slow morning at a
convenience store. ``I think people are actually waiting for prices
to go down again.''

North Korean missile flies over Japan and lands in Pacific: Report
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: FIXES typo in lede; INSERTS new graf 4 explaining two-stage
system and new graf 8 with launch being North Korea's first of a
two-stage missile &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ North Korea fired a ballistic missile over
northeastern Japan on Monday that landed into the Pacific Ocean,
news reports said, quoting Japan's Defense Agency.
	   The first stage of the missile landed in waters between Russia
and Japan, but the second stage flew over Japanese territory and
fell into the Pacific Ocean, local media reported, citing agency
sources.
	   A spokesman at Japan's Defense Agency, Terao Toshihiko, said
that the government was still trying to confirm the exact location
of the landing.
	   A two-stage ballistic missile combines two engines, with the
first falling away after its burns up its fuel and a second that
then ignites and proceeds to another target.
	   The launch just after noon (0300 GMT) was confirmed by Japanese,
South Korean and United States defense officials. It was North
Korea's first test-firing of a missile in five years and its fourth
since 1984.
	   In response, Japan Monday refused to back a long-planned
agreement to help fund two nuclear reactors for North Korea.
	   Japan's Defense Agency, quoting unidentified U.S. military
officials, said the missile was probably aimed at waters between
Russia and Japan and landed 300 kilometers (190 miles) southeast of
Vladivostok, Russia.
	   The missile was ``confirmed to be a brand-new `Daepodong I' with
a range of 2,000 kilometers (1,240 miles),'' the South Korean
Defense Ministry said in a statement.
	   The test was the first launch by North Korea of a two-stage
missile and marks a significant step forward in its rocket
technology.
	   ``We see this as a very dangerous act,'' said chief government
spokesman Hiromu Nonaka. He said Japan would express its concern to
the North through diplomatic channels.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, visiting Sarajevo,
told reporters she was also alarmed by the test launch.
	   ``This is something that we will be raising with North Koreans
in the talks that are currently going on,'' she said.
	   Those talks, in New York, are over a proposal for the North to
suspend missile development in exchange for nuclear energy
know-how, and some Korea watchers said they suspect the launch was
timed to up the stakes.
	   ``Kim is good at brinksmanship,'' said Hajime Izumi, a noted
North Korea watcher and professor at Shizuoka University, referring
to North Korea's leader Kim Jong Il.
	   ``This shows that North Korea can make effective missiles,'' he
added. ``What remains to be seen is if they can mass produce them,
or deploy them.''
	   Masahiro Akiyama, deputy director of Japan's Defense Agency,
said the launch was not totally a surprise _ security experts, he
said, had been increasing their surveillance of the North since
earlier this month.
	   Stalinist North Korea, which over the past few years has been
foundering under devastating famines, is to convene its newly
elected parliament on Sept. 5, and are expected to elect Kim as the
country's president.
	   In June, North Korea also admitted for the first time that it
has sold missiles abroad. It had long been suspected of selling
missiles to Iran and Syria.
	   But very little is known about North Korea's missile program,
and its possession of a significantly better missile would be a
matter of serious concern throughout the region.
	   North Korea's best-known ballistic missile is the Rodong, which
has a range of about 1,000 kilometers (620 miles). It was last test
fired in 1993, and also landed in the same area of the Sea of
Japan, which divides the Korean Peninsula from Japan.
	   With its 1,000 kilometer (620-mile range), the Rodong I missile,
a modified Scud, could strike South Korea and much of Japan. The
newer missile would put most of Japan within range.
	   In 1996, the United States began talks with North Korea aimed at
persuading the secretive Communist country to freeze its missile
program and to join an international agreement designed to restrict
missile proliferation. The talks stalled.
	   Japan is currently boosting its budget for joint development of
a missile defense system with the United States and has reportedly
earmarked 500 million yen (dlrs 3.6 million) for the project next
year.
	   The United States has 37,000 troops stationed in South Korea,
many of them based near its border with North Korea. It has roughly
another 50,000 troops in Japan.
	   Monday's was the secretive North's fourth test-firing of a
missile since 1984 and its first in five years.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ About 200 angry Serb women pelted
the U.S. information office with stones Monday to protest the
killing of Serb civilians, allegedly by Albanian rebels fighting
for independence of Kosovo province.
	   President Clinton's special envoy on war crimes issues told
reporters Monday in the Croation capital Zagreb that the Yugoslav
government refused to let him visit the country to investigate
alleged abuses in Kosovo, including ``alleged criminal conduct'' by
Albanian rebels and Serb security forces.
	   The envoy, David Scheffer, said Belgrade's refusal to grant him
a visa ``indicates once again that government's insecurity about
its own accountability under international laws.''
	   Allegations of abuse by both Serb forces and Albanian guerrillas
escalated over the weekend after Serbian police said they had
discovered a crematory in the village of Klecka, where ethnic
Albanians allegedly had burned the bodies of at least 22 Serbs,
including women and children.
	   The rebel Kosovo Liberation Army has denied any role in the
killings.
	   On Monday, about 200 Serb women marched to the U.S. Information
Service in Pristina and demanded that an American official come
speak to them. When no one responded, the women shouted
``fascists'' and ``murderers'' and began hurling stones at the
building.
	   ``This is Serbia,'' shouted one of the women. ``Look at them,
high and mighty democrats! They can't come out and talk to us. They
only want to talk to (ethnic) Albanian politicians!''
	   Despite appeals by a security guard, the women shook the iron
fence around the compound for a few moments and then marched off
toward the offices of the International Committee of the Red Cross.
	   The same women later stoned the premises housing the office of
the International Committee of the Red Cross, where one of them
read spoke before a delegation went inside to talk to ICRC official
Nick Summer.
	   ``Where are you, Albanian Mothers? You say you are defenders of
human rights, why do you not condemn the horrendous crimes
perpetrated by your people, why do you not condemn the terrorists
for what they are doing to your own Albanian people?'' said Zagorka
Pavlovic of a Serb sisterhood.
	   She referred to Serbian charges that at least 20 Serbs had been
killed and then burned by Kosovo rebels.
	   Summer told the women the ICRC has been doing everything in its
power to get in touch with all those who can provide any
information on the missing persons.
	   Summer said the Red Cross helps all civilians in need,
regardless of ethnicity. Dissatisfied, the women outside tried to
break down the gate and demolished part of the fence.
	   They pulled out one ICRC security guard, an ethnic Albanian,
threw him to the ground and attacked him physically. His colleague
intervened and took the guard away. The guard was limping visibly.
	   The women also hurled stones at the ICRC offices and another
security guard was hit on the head. Only then did some traffic
policemen intervene.

Presidents of Ukraine, Russia discuss measures to prevent crisis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma and his
Russian counterpart Boris Yeltsin discussed ways Monday to contain
Russia's financial crisis and soften its impact on Ukraine,
Kuchma's press service reported.
	   Yeltsin briefed Kuchma by telephone about the political
consultations under way in Moscow. The State Duma, the lower
chamber of parliament, started debate Monday over the confirmation
of acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin.
	   Ukraine has preserved strong economic links with Russia since
the collapse of the Soviet Union. As a consequence, it has been
among the hardest-hit by the sharp drop in the Russian ruble's
value.
	   Ukraine's hryvna currency has been falling steadily over the
past two weeks, since the Russian government announced it would let
the ruble's value fall by up to 34 percent. A number of large
Ukrainian enterprises have begun to report losses because of the
crisis in Russia.
	   Kuchma and Yeltsin are scheduled to meet in the eastern
Ukrainian city of Kharkiv on Sept. 18 for a two-day summit.

EU to retarget assistance for crisis-hit Russia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union said Monday it will
look this week at how it can help ease Russia's financial situation
by retargeting its aid program for the country.
	   European Commission spokeswoman Lousewies van der Laan said
funds will probably be spent more on sending experts to develop
legal and technical assistance, and less on projects where it's
more difficult to control where the money goes.
	   ``Wherever we can help we are available to help, but if basic
reforms are not on the way, there is very little we can do to
improve the situation,'' Van der Laan said.
	   Between 1991 and 1997 the Commission, the EU's executive body,
committed around dlrs 1.2 billion to projects in Russia through its
Tacis aid program for the former Soviet Union and Mongolia. Russia
receivers over half the total aid to the 16 nations.
	   On Thursday, the 20-member Commission will discuss the economic
and financial situation in Russia during its weekly meeting.
	   The EU's Commissioner for Monetary Affairs has also floated the
idea of convening EU finance ministers ahead of their next
scheduled meeting on Sept. 25, to discuss the Russian crisis, his
spokesman Patrick Child said.
	   De Silguy on Monday remained optimistic about the impact the
crisis will have on EU countries, saying on French radio he sees no
reason to revise the EU's growth forecasts.
	   ``All the lights are green now and I don't see any reason in
particular to become alarmed about the economic situation in
Europe,'' he said.
	   The EU is the single largest donor in the former Soviet states.

Vietnam and Laos to work together to protect biodiversity
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Vietnam and Laos have agreed to work
together to protect biological diversity along their respective
border in the two countries' northern regions, the Laotian state
press agency KPL reported Monday.
	   Officials from Laos and Vietnam, together with United Nations
experts, agreed on a joint action plan at a recent two-day
conference, KPL said in a dispatch received in Bangkok. The plan
was based partially on a review of past scientific activities.
	   The area covered extends over Laos' Bolikhamsay province and
Vietnam's Nghe An province.
	   Mountainous wetlands which are largely unexplored connect the
two provinces. Just five years ago the Sao La, a previously unknown
species of mammal similar to an antelope, was discovered in the
area. The animal is also known as the Vu Quang ox, named after the
location in Vietnam where it was discovered.
	   Scientists believe other rare or unknown species may also
inhabit the area.

Family feud turns to dynamite attacks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RETHYMNO, Greece (AP) - Police near this port town on the island
of Crete were placed on alert Monday after a blood feud between
members of a local family became explosive over the weekend.
	   An apartment block owned by the family of a confessed killer,
Nikos Tsourbakis, 36, was gutted by a large quantity of dynamite on
Sunday. No one was injured.
	   Tsourbakis, a farmer, was arrested two months ago after
confessing to the murder of his 50-year-old cousin Vangelis
Tsourbakis.
	   Feuds are common on this island, where family honor is often
considered more important than the law, and where owning an illegal
gun is considered a sign of manhood.
	   Cretan villages often make headlines here when land squabbles or
disputes over animal rustling turn violent. The resulting
tit-for-tat vendettas may last for years, extend across Greece and
result in a string of deaths.
	   The Tsourbakis case began as a typical vendetta until the
weekend explosion.
	   Following his arrest the windows of his home were smashed and
his tractor was torched. Several days later, his herd of 150 sheep
was found slaughtered. Tsourbakis' family fled the village and is
thought to be living in Athens.
	   A police investigation is focusing on Vangelis Tsourbakis'
extended family. No arrests have been made.

Former au pair Louise Woodward turns tables and tries the media

Massachusetts, and adds Woodward quote &QL; 
 &UR; By MAUREEN JOHNSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   EDINBURGH, Scotland (AP) _ Her trial attracted a global
television audience. Now Louise Woodward, the former au pair
convicted of killing an American baby, has turned the tables and
put television on trial. Her verdict: television added to the
stress and notoriety with which she now has to live.
	   ``I am just trying to be a normal 20 year old, trying to be a
normal person, and people won't let me do that,'' she told hundreds
of TV producers and executives Monday during a debate on allowing
TV cameras into court at the Edinburgh International Television
Festival.
	   Arguing that cameras in court turn trials into entertainment,
Woodward said: ``People don't seem to be able to distinguish
between celebrity and notoriety. They ask for autographs and
photographs and things. They ask me to sign baseball caps, which I
find ridiculous.''
	   Ms. Woodward, the first British woman to have a trial shown on
live TV, returned home June 18 after a Massachusetts court upheld
her conviction of involuntary manslaughter in the death of
8-month-old Matthew Eappen. He died Feb. 9, 1997, after suffering
injuries while in her care.
	   Since her return, Ms. Woodward has given one television
interview _ to the BBC, in which she reiterated her claims of
innocence _ and otherwise disappeared from public view.
	   Appearing calm and composed and wearing a smart black suit, Ms.
Woodward said she turns down dozens of requests for interviews on
everything from when she plans to go to university to where she has
her hair done.
	   If she had the choice, she said she would have refused to have
television cameras in the courtroom in Massachusetts, where they
are allowed.
	   ``I was not given the option,'' Woodward said. ``It was thrust
upon me. I would have said no.''

Former President Aquino dedicates Magsaysay award to Burmese people
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Former Philippine President Corazon
Aquino on Monday dedicated a prestigious Asian award she won to the
Burmese people, citing their long and bloody fight for freedom.
	   Aquino has been named winner of this year's Ramon Magsaysay
Award for International Understanding for helping topple strongman
Ferdinand Marcos in a nearly bloodless uprising in the Philippines
in 1986.
	   The award, named for a Philippine preisident who died in a plane
crash in 1957, is considered the Asian equivalent of the Nobel
Prize.
	   Accepting the award in rites Monday night, Aquino said that
compared to the Filipinos' 1986 triumph against Marcos'
dictatorship, the Burmese people were encountering more
difficulties but were continuing the fight for democracy.
	   She also commended other pro-democracy figures in her speech,
including South African President Nelson Mandela, her assassinated
husband, former Sen. Benigno Aquino and the unidentified man who
stopped a column of Chinese military tanks deployed to crush
pro-democracy activists in China's Tiananmen Square.
	   ``There is never a wrong time to honor courage, conviction and
right because these qualities are always in short supply, yet, ever
in infinite demand wherever freedom is sought and democracy is
threatened,'' said Mrs. Aquino.
	   Aquino's husband was Marcos' fiercest political rival. On Aug.
21, 1983, her husband was assassinated as he returned from U.S.
exile triggering massive street protests that culminated in a 1986
``people power'' revolt that ended Marcos' two decades of rule.
	   She agreed to run against Marcos in a snap presidential election
in February 1986 but lost in the official count, which was widely
believed to have been rigged.
	   Mrs. Aquino called for civil disobedience to protest the
election outcome. A group of military officers broke off from
Marcos in a series of events that led to his overthrow.
	   She was swept to the presidency, inheriting an economy in
shambles and a country battered by years of dictatorship.
	   When her term ended in 1992, Mrs. Aquino traveled widely to
share the Philippines' non-violent struggle against
authoritarianism.
	   Other winners of the Magsaysay awards this year were Phaly Nuon
of Cambodia the winner for community leadership, Thai banker Sophon
Suphapong for public service, Pakistani doctor Adibul Hasan Rizvk
for government service and Chinese Ying Ruocheng for journalism,
literature and creative communication arts.
	   The winners were honored at the 40th presentation ceremonies for
the awards in Manila on Monday, Magsaysay's birthday.
	   The winners of the awards received a certificate, medallion and
dlrs 50,000.

Russia population still down, but decline slowing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's population continued to decline after the
first six months of this year, but the drop is slowing, a news
agency said Monday.
	   The country's population dropped by 226,700 people to around
146.5 million between January and June, the Interfax news agency
said, citing the State Statistics Committee.
	   Immigration offset the 0.2 percent decline, with 246,000
entering and 92,500 people leaving Russia.
	   Compared with the same period last year, the rate of population
decline was down. Last year, Russia's population shrank by 263,700
people.
	   Russia's population has been in decline since the Soviet Union
collapsed in 1991. A protracted economic crisis, worsening health
care, and increased stress over the country's unstable social,
financial, and political situation have all been blamed for the
soaring mortality rate and low birth rate.
	   Russian officials predict that the country's population will
drop to 141 million by 2010.

below 8,000. RECASTS. Changes byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By BRUCE MEYERSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Business Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The Dow industrials fell further Monday morning
and was threatening to fall below 8,000 for the first time in seven
months after an unsuccessful bid to bounce back from one of Wall
Street's worst weeks in years.
	   The Dow Jones industrial average, which gained more than 40
points in the opening minutes of trading, was down 36.40 at
8,015.38 at midmorning. The last time the Dow closed below 8,000
was on Jan. 30.
	   In last week's global stock market rout, the Dow plunged 481.97
points, or by 5.6 percent, its biggest percentage drop for a
calendar week since 1989.
	   That shrank 1998's gain to 1.8 percent. At July's peak, when the
Dow was at 9,337.97, it had been up 18.1 percent.
	   Doubts about Russia's economic and political stability kept
pressure on financial markets around the world.
	   Shares prices were lower near the end of Europe's trading day.
Major stock indexes fell sharply earlier in Hong Kong and
Singapore, Japan posted a modest gain after dropping to a 12-year
low Friday.
	   In Europe, a key index of German stock prices was down 1.3
percent by midday and market gauges were slightly lower in France,
Switzerland and the Netherlands.
	   Markets in London, the largest in Europe, were closed for a
holiday.
	   Hong Kong's key Hang Seng Index sank 5.7 percent in the first
seven minutes of trading and ended the day with a 7.1 percent
decline, falling 554.70 points to 7,275.04.
	   In Singapore, the benchmark index fell 28.83 points, or 3.25
percent, to a new low of 856.43 after ending below the 900-point
level on Friday for the first time in 10 years.
	   However, stock prices rose on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, where
the benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 192.26 points,
or 1.38 percent, to close at 14,107.89.
	   Elsewhere in Asia Monday, the key stock index in Taiwan fell 2.8
percent to finish at a 22-month low and prices fell 1.4 percent in
Australia, but stocks ended up 1.8 percent in South Korea.
	   Across Asia, Europe and the Americas, many stock markets fell by
big percentages last week. That left some people wondering if the
year-old Asian financial crisis, and the recessions it has caused
in regional powerhouses such as Japan and Hong Kong, could spread
to the West and sour its economies.
	   On Sunday, Japan's chief economic planner, Taichi Sakaiya,
proposed an emergency summit of major industrialized countries to
address the chaos roiling world financial markets.
	   To make matters worse, the ruble's collapse in Russia has set
off political and economic instability there.
	   On Saturday, Russia's new acting prime minister, Viktor
Chernomyrdin, began negotiating a power-sharing agreement with the
Russian parliament and reassured markets around the world that the
country would not return to a Soviet-style economy.
	   But on Sunday, hours after the interim government and
parliamentary leaders agreed to an 18-month truce that would leave
Boris Yeltsin in control and give the administration time to try to
end the crisis, the agreement collapsed after the communists
rejected it.
	   In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index seemed to fall sharply because
the government has reduced its role in trading.
	   For two weeks, Hong Kong's government had been buying stocks to
drive the Hang Seng Index to a level at which speculators who bet
on stock prices falling would lose money.
	   On Friday, that aggressive government buying pushed trading
volume to a record dlrs 10.1 billion. Traders estimated the
government spent dlrs 9.1 billion.
	   Speculators suddenly found it more expensive to bet against Hong
Kong markets because of new measures taken by the Futures Exchange
over the weekend to curb manipulation.
	   On Saturday, the futures exchange announced it would require
traders to come up with more cash when buying or selling more than
10,000 futures contracts. In addition, it is now requiring members
to report and identify anyone holding 250 contracts or more.
Previously, the reporting level had been 500 contracts, and market
players could remain anonymous.
	   Even though stock prices seemed far more stable in Tokyo, signs
of gloom and fear about the world's economic future also remained
high in some areas.
	   ``I'm worried,'' said Kazuomi Kobayashi, a 52-year-old Tokyo
barber who dabbles in stocks as he stood in front of a large
electronic board in downtown Tokyo showing the latest Nikkei
numbers. ``I've lost so much. When I buy, it goes down. When I buy
again, it goes down again.''
	   Even in Singapore, where newspapers often work with the
government to keep people calm, signs of panic prevailed.
	   ``World markets sent reeling: World faces global meltdown as its
leaders fail to find solutions to Russia's worsening crisis,'' said
the front-page headline in Saturday's The Straits Times.
	   ``Fear of complete meltdown rules markets,'' said a headline in
The Business Times on Monday.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ About 200 angry Serb women pelted
the U.S. information office with stones Monday to protest the
killing of Serb civilians, allegedly by Albanian rebels fighting
for independence of the Kosovo province.
	   President Bill Clinton's special envoy on war crimes issues told
reporters Monday in the Croation capital Zagreb that the Yugoslav
government refused to let him visit the country to investigate
alleged abuses in Kosovo, including ``alleged criminal conduct'' by
Albanian rebels and Serb security forces.
	   The envoy, David Scheffer, said Belgrade's refusal to grant him
a visa ``indicates once again that government's insecurity about
its own accountability under international laws.''
	   Allegations of abuse by both Serb forces and Albanian guerrillas
escalated over the weekend after Serbian police said they had
discovered a crematory in the village of Klecka, where ethnic
Albanians allegedly had burned the bodies of at least 22 Serbs,
including women and children.
	   The rebel Kosovo Liberation Army has denied any role in the
killings.
	   On Monday, about 200 Serb women marched to the U.S. Information
Service in Pristina and demanded that an American official come
speak to them. When no one responded, the women shouted
``fascists'' and ``murderers'' and began hurling stones at the
building.
	   ``This is Serbia,'' shouted one of the women. ``Look at them,
high and mighty democrats! They can't come out and talk to us. They
only want to talk to (ethnic) Albanian politicians!''
	   Despite appeals by a security guard, the women shook the iron
fence around the compound for a few moments and then marched off
toward the offices of the International Committee of the Red Cross.
	   The same women later stoned the premises housing the office of
the International Committee of the Red Cross, where one of them
read spoke before a delegation went inside to talk to ICRC official
Nick Summer.
	   ``Where are you, Albanian Mothers? You say you are defenders of
human rights, why do you not condemn the horrendous crimes
perpetrated by your people, why do you not condemn the terrorists
for what they are doing to your own Albanian people?'' said Zagorka
Pavlovic of a Serb sisterhood.
	   She referred to Serbian charges that at least 20 Serbs had been
killed and then burned by Kosovo rebels.
	   Summer told the women the ICRC has been doing everything in its
power to get in touch with all those who can provide information on
the missing persons.
	   Summer said the Red Cross helps all civilians in need,
regardless of ethnicity. Dissatisfied, the women outside tried to
break down the gate and demolished part of the fence.
	   They pulled out one ICRC security guard, an ethnic Albanian,
threw him to the ground and attacked him physically. His colleague
intervened and took the guard away. The guard was limping visibly.
	   The women also hurled stones at the ICRC offices and another
security guard was hit on the head. Only then did some traffic
policemen intervene.

Turkish Cypriot leader offers confederation to Greek Cypriots
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with comments from Cypriot leader; edits to trim &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ The leader of the breakaway Turkish
Cypriot state on Monday proposed setting up a confederation of
equal states as a way to end the 24-year-old division of this
Mediterranean island.
	   ``We propose the establishment of a Cyprus confederation
composed of two peoples and two states,'' Rauf Denktash told a news
conference held with Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem. ``The
framework of our proposal is open to negotiation.''
	   Cem said the offer, a modified version of the Turkish proposal
for a two-zone, bi-communal federation, had Turkey's
``full-backing.''
	   ``We hope that the Greek Cypriots will seriously consider the
proposal and see it as a last chance for reconciliation,'' Cem
said.
	   ``It is time that they recognize that we are the legal
government of the Turkish Cypriots,'' Denktash told private NTV
television.
	   ``We believe that only this structure will provide for the
security of both sides and will safeguard their identity and
well-being,'' Denktash said. ``If the Greek Cypriots agree to this
final basis, we are ready to begin negotiations to establish the
Cyprus Confederation.''
	   Under the offer, the Turkish Cypriots still insist on
international recognition but abandon opposition to EU membership
for the Greek side.
	   The Greek Cypriot leadership promptly rejected the confederation
offer.
	   It ``amounts to the legitimization of the Turkish invasion and
occupation of north Cyprus, the ethnic cleansing and the violation
of human rights as well as the definitive partition of the
island,'' said parliament speaker Spyros Kyprianou.
	   Cyprus has been divided in Greek and Turkish sectors since 1974
when Turkey invaded following a short-lived coup backed by
supporters of union with Greece.
	   Kyprianou, who is acting president while President Glafcos
Clerides is attending the Nonaligned summit in Africa, described
the proposal as ``a theatrical move designed to create the
impression of a compromise.''
	   The offer comes at a time when tension is running high on the
island over Greek Cypriot plans to deploy Russian made S-300
antiaircraft missiles.
	   Cem reiterated that Turkey would act to protect the Turkish
Cypriots' if Greek Cypriots go ahead with the deployment. ``If they
bring their death machines to Cyprus, Turkey will do whatever
necessary for Turkish Cypriots' security,'' he said.

Soccer body expresses confidence in Dutch, Belgian efforts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NYON, Switzerland (AP) _ European soccer's governing body UEFA
Monday dismissed reports that it was threatening to move the next
European Championship finals away from Belgium and the Netherlands.
	   ``On the basis of preparations made so far in Belgium and the
Netherlands, UEFA confirms that there is no reason to call the
staging of the final round of the European Championship in the year
2000 into question,'' said a statement.
	   ``Media reports to the contrary are unfounded,'' it said.
	   Belgian newspapers Saturday quoted an anonymous senior UEFA
official as saying the championships might move to England or
Germany because of delays in the Dutch and Belgian preparations.
	   The official reportedly said the Dutch and Belgian governments
appeared to lack enthusiasm for policing the tournament and
modernizing stadiums.
	   ``UEFA and the local organizing committee are working according
to the schedule of conditions accepted by the host associations and
are on schedule,'' the body's statement said.

Israeli army says soldiers erred in delaying pregnant woman
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The Israeli army said Monday that soldiers were
mistaken when they refused to allow a Palestinian car carrying a
pregnant woman through a roadblock last week.
	   The woman gave birth in the car, and the baby died shortly
afterwards at a hospital in the West Bank town of Hebron.
	   An army statement said the soldiers ``displayed mistaken
judgment'' when they refused to allow the car to pass. Hebron was
sealed off by Israeli troops at the time, following the killing of
a Jewish settler there, apparently by a Palestinian.
	   In its statement, the army said that its investigation showed
that the soldiers at the roadblock failed to determine that this
was a medical emergency. Israeli army regulations require soldiers
to allow Palestinian cars to pass through roadblocks for medical
emergencies or in humanitarian cases.
	   At the same time, the army said it could not determine for sure
that the delay at the roadblock led to the death of the newborn. An
administrator at the Hebron hospital said if the mother had arrived
without delay, the baby's chances of survival would have been much
higher.
	   Standing orders about allowing Palestinian vehicles through
roadblocks in such cases will be explained to the soldiers again,
the army said. It said the military police are still investigating,
and no action has been taken against the soldiers involved.

Japan's ambassador says war still an issue for Australia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Japan's relationship with Australia
depends on the way the Japanese government and people deal with
issues stemming from World War II, the outgoing Japanese ambassador
said Monday.
	   Though the number of Australians who thought of Japan as a
wartime enemy was declining, there were still some who could not
forget what Japanese troops did during the war, Yukio Sato said at
a farewell luncheon.
	   ``We must admit what has happened in the past and seek for ways
to get over them,'' aid Sato, who will become an ambassador to the
United Nations. His replacement as Australian ambassador has not
been officially confirmed.
	   ``Japanese people doing business here should always know the
fact that the memories of the war strongly lingers in the
Australian society,'' he said.
	   But the situation was gradually changing, he said.
	   In November last year, Sato was warmly welcomed at a ceremony
for the inauguration of the new president of the Returned Services
League, the organization of war veterans, opening up a dialogue
between Japanese diplomats and the League.
	   As well, the Japanese government is planning a ceremony to
recognize so-called wartime brides, Japanese women who married
Australian soldiers stationed in Japan.
	   Some 650 to 700 Japanese women came to Australia with their
husbands after the war.
	   ``We want to thank them as a government for their deeds to
alleviate the anti-Japanese sentiment in Australia in the postwar
period,'' Sato said.
	   ``If there were a hundred people, there should be a hundred
different feelings towards the war ... and though the memories of
the war is gradually becoming a past, we hope to keep on making
efforts for a better Australia-Japan relationship,'' Sato said.

Runaway weather balloon last tracked heading for Norway and Russia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A runaway weather balloon, which has been on a
week-long odyssey around the world, was last tracked west of the
Norwegian island of Spitsbergen heading for Russia, Iceland's Air
Traffic Service said Monday.
	   A U.S. Navy plane located the balloon on radar about 1800 GMT
Sunday and followed it for two hours before it moved out of
Iceland's airspace west of Spitsbergen, which straddles the Arctic
Circle north of the Norwegian mainland, it said.
	   ``The cloud top was so high, they were never able to confirm it
visually,'' Halli Sigurdsson, the air service's deputy director,
said in a telephone interview. ``But we are 99 percent confident
this was the ballon because there was nothing else out there.''
	   The unmanned 100-meter-high (110-yard-high) balloon is used to
observe weather patterns and can be seen from about 70 kilometers
(40 miles) away. It is not equipped with transponders that emit
navigation signals to alert airliners to its presence.
	   Aircraft from Canada, Britain and the U.S. military in Iceland
had tracked the runaway balloon, and air traffic controllers had
been diverting planes from its path. Canadian jet fighters on
Thursday fired more than 1,000 rounds into the helium-filled
balloon but it remained aloft.
	   The errant balloon disappeared off radar screens late Saturday
night about 200 miles (320 kms) north of the Arctic Circle.
	   A U.S. Navy P-3 Orion maritime patrol aircraft launched Sunday
morning believed it spotted the balloon but developed a propeller
leak and had to return to the NATO base at Keflavik on Iceland's
southwest coast. A second P-3 launched later Sunday picked up the
radar trail and followed it until it left Icelandic airspace.
	   ``It was anticipated it would drift along the north coast of
Spitsbergen and go into Russian airspace about 5 a.m. (0500GMT)
this morning,'' Sigurdsson said. ``This is all estimated, based on
wind speeds.''
	   The balloon had been traveling at about 30,000 feet (9,100
meters) but when last tracked it had descended to about 18,000 feet
(5,500 meters), he said.
	   The 25-story balloon, which flattened out would cover five
football fields, was launched before dawn last Monday from Vanscoy,
just outside Saskatoon, in Canada to measure ozone levels over
Canada.
	   The project was a joint effort between the Canadian Space
Agency, Environment Canada, the Center for Research in Earth and
Space Technology, the University of Toronto, York University and
the University of Denver.

Winterthur Insurance planning to sell reinsurance business
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Credit Suisse Group Monday said
Winterthur Insurance has indicated its intention to sell its
reinsurance business to Bermuda-based Partner RE for 1.13 billion
Swiss francs (dlrs 754 million).
	   The sale represents a second important step towards
concentrating on Winterthur's core insurance activities, Credit
Suisse said in a press release.
	   Winterthur has sent a letter of intent to sell and a final
contract is expected to be signed by Oct. 1, Credit Suisse said.
	   The sale is subject to regulatory approval in the U.S. and
Europe.
	   One of the main activities of reinsurance businesses is insuring
insurance companies.
	   The sale follows Winterthur's sale of its 51 percent stake in
Australian insurer HIH Winterthur in July. Partner RE is a unit of
Partnerre Ltd.
	   Credit Suisse banking group announced its takeover of
Winterthur, Switzerland's second biggest insurance company, last
year.

Frank Rijkaard appointed as new Dutch soccer coach
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Frank Rijkaard was named Monday as
the new coach of the Dutch national soccer team.
	   Rijkaard replaces Guus Hiddink, who joined Spanish giant Real
Madrid after guiding the Netherlands to fourth place in the
summer's World Cup finals in France. Rijkaard was Hiddink's
assistant during the tournament.
	   The 35-year-old former Ajax and AC Milan star was a star of the
Dutch team that won the 1988 European Championships. He played 73
internationals for the Netherlands, scoring 10 goals from the
midfield.
	   Rijkaard, who only ended his playing days at the end of the 1995
season, was considered by many an outsider for the coach's job.
Former Celtic manager Wim Jansen was many pundits' favorite to take
over from Hiddink.

	   Another former Dutch great, Johan Neeskens, was appointed as
Rijkaard's assistant. Neeskens also was part of Hiddink's World Cup
management team.
	   Rijkaard, who only ended his playing days at the end of the 1995
season, was considered by many an outsider for the coach's job.
Former Celtic manager Wim Jansen was many pundits' favorite to take
over from Hiddink.
	   ``I cannot deny that this was a surprise for me,'' Rijkaard
said. ``I am unbelievably happy.''

<TEXT>
	   The Saudi renegade's path to militant Islam began as a teen-ager
in the 1970s, when he got caught up in the fundamentalist movement
then sweeping Saudi Arabia. He was a voracious reader of Islamic
literature and listened to weekly sermons in the holy city of
Mecca.
	   A relative remembers his teen-age passion for religion, evident,
for example, when he eloquently addressed a roomful of men at a
family funeral.
	   ``He was well-versed in religion and confident speaking in front
of all those people. And he was at most 19,'' said the in-law.
	   The only son of a Syrian mother, bin Laden was born in Saudi
Arabia's commercial capital, Jiddah, to a conservative family.
Among the 54 children fathered by Mohammed bin Laden, a contracting
magnate, Osama quickly developed a reputation as the most pious.
	   Unlike many of his brothers, bin Laden chose to stay in the
kingdom for his education, preferring a more Islamic environment.
He graduated in civil engineering from Jiddah's King Abdul-Aziz
University.
	   He married in his early 20s and, despite his vast wealth, chose
to live in modest apartments with his wives, says a former neighbor
who spoke on condition of anonymity. Today his three wives _ a
Syrian and two Saudis _ and their 15 or so children live in cities
near his bases in Afghanistan.
	   Throughout his career, bin Laden has led a spartan life. In
Sudan he refused the comfort of air conditioning even in the
blistering summer heat.
	   ``I don't want to get used to the easy life,'' Saudi journalist
Jamal Khashoggi quoted him as saying.
	   On the Afghan battlefield, he gained a reputation for being a
courageous and resourceful commander.
	   One battle stands out. In 1987, he and his men faced
near-impossible odds in the southern province of Paktia. Despite
being outnumbered and poorly armed, they defeated the Soviet units.
He still proudly shows off an assault rifle said to have been taken
from a dead Russian general after that battle, an AK-47 he can be
seen toting in television interviews.
	   ``He became even more fearless after Paktia,'' said a former
friend. And like others who know bin Laden, this source said he now
expects him to fight until the end, ``and die in glory.''

Iraq demands U.N. probe into UNSCOM affairs
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARIAM SAMI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq has demanded a U.N. investigation into
the operations of the U.N. disarmament commission, accusing it of
spying for the United States and Israel.
	   In a letter to the U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan made public
Monday, Iraq said the U.N. Special Commission takes its orders from
the United States and coordinates with Israel.
	   ``We call upon you, as well as the Security Council, to put an
end to this charade which goes on under the cover of the United
Nations and (Security) Council,'' said the Aug. 30 letter by Deputy
Prime Minister Tariq Aziz.
	   Longstanding tensions between UNSCOM and Iraq came to a head
Aug. 5 when Iraq suspended cooperation with weapons inspectors.
UNSCOM then stopped new arms inspections.
	   In a related development, a prominent inspector, American Scott
Ritter, resigned from the commission last week saying the U.N. is
not doing enough to stop Iraq from producing and concealing
biological and chemical weapons.
	   In his 10-page letter, Aziz cited newspaper reports that U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told chief weapons inspector
Richard Butler to hold off inspecting certain cites to avoid
creating a standoff with Iraq. Albright denied she interfered in
Butler's work.
	   Aziz wrote that Ritter's resignation was a red herring to divert
attention from UNSCOM's refusal to acknowledge Iraq's achievements
in eliminating its weapons.
	   Iraq accuses UNSCOM of deliberately prolonging its work of
identifying and destroying Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
Until UNSCOM certifies that Iraq is free of illegal weapons, the
Security Council will not lift the economic sanctions imposed after
Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   Iraq demands ``a serious investigation of all these facts,''
Aziz said in the letter, adding that the Special Commission should
be made ``an honest international body, not an intelligence unit
for a member country.''
	   ``We ask you as well as the Council, do you allow that an
apparatus attached to it coordinates with a party like Israel in
issues related to Iraq?'' the letter said. Aziz did not say if he
had any evidence to support that allegation.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The Dow industrials fell below 8,000 Monday
morning, extending a selloff on the heel's of Wall Street's worst
week in years.
	   The Dow Jones industrial average, which gained more than 40
points in the opening minutes of trading, was down 108.65 at
7,943.03 at midmorning. The last time the Dow closed below 8,000
was on Jan. 30.
	   In last week's global stock market rout, the Dow plunged 481.97
points, or by 5.6 percent, its biggest percentage drop for a
calendar week since 1989.
	   That shrank 1998's gain to 1.8 percent. At July's peak, when the
Dow was at 9,337.97, it had been up 18.1 percent. The drop of 14.9
percent from the July record is the biggest retreat since a 21.2
percent slide triggered by the Persian Gulf crisis in the summer
and fall of 1990.

Prime Ministers of France and Greece discuss economic crisis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ The Prime Ministers of France and Greece
Monday discussed the economic crisis in Russia and agreed the
European Union was partially protected from its consequences
because of upcoming monetary union.
	   ``The perspective of the Euro was primarily a thing of stability
regarding the risk of speculation for our countries which gladdened
us,'' said French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin.
	   But Jospin and Simitis refused to directly comment on the
Russian crisis, except to say that it was the result of deep
political infrastructure problems.
	   ``We effectively thought the previous year that there was in
Russia not only a financial crisis, but largely economic problems,
and perhaps also certain problems of political balance to
redefine,'' Jospin said.
	   Simitis agreed saying that ``there are deeper, infrastructural
problems.''
	   Jospin was in Athens for an unofficial one-day visit to address
a meeting organized by Simitis' ruling Panhellenic Socialist
Movement, or PASOK, on ``Democratic Socialism'' and the prospects
for the European Left in the next century.
	   A close friend of Simitis' and a frequent visitor to Greece,
Jospin spent two weeks of his summer vacation on Greek island last
month.

Kohl seeks to turn Russia crisis into vote-getter
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Helmut Kohl is counting on the
economic crises in Russia and Asia to give a lift to his uphill
re-election bid, his party's campaign manager said Monday.
	   Kohl's effort to portray himself as a pillar of reliability amid
turmoil will be an increasingly important campaign theme in the
final weeks before Sept. 27 elections, Peter Hintze of Kohl's
Christian Democrats said.
	   Kohl, the West's longest-serving leader, trails Social
Democratic candidate Gerhard Schroeder in the polls.
	   ``Voters feel that Germany has an important leadership role in
Europe as a guarantor of stability,'' and the election is a choice
between ``security and risk,'' Hintze said.
	   He said risks include the environmentalist Greens, a possible
junior coalition partner for Schroeder if he is elected.
	   A manifesto for change presented Monday by the Greens is a
``shock program for Germany,'' Hintze said.
	   The nine-point plan laying out Green priorities includes
time-honored calls for raising taxes on fossil fuels, swift steps
toward scrapping nuclear power and curbing working hours to spread
jobs around.
	   Gunda Roestel, who co-chairs the Greens, said it was ``nearly
obscene'' of Kohl's government to talk about an economic upswing
with more than 4 million people out of work.
	   The Social Democrats' chairman, Oskar Lafontaine, said Monday he
could envisage a governing alliance with the Greens.
	   ``There are differences between us, but the Greens would have to
face realities once they're in government,'' he said.

French foreign minister is wait-and-see on IMF new aid to Russia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER BURNS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ France's foreign minister on Monday was withholding
judgment on whether he thought the International Monetary Fund will
unfreeze its funding to Russia. He said it depended on how Moscow's
current political crisis plays out.
	   ``I think we need to have a complete view of this situation on
the economic as well as financial and political side,'' Foreign
Minister Hubert Vedrine said in response to a reporter's question.
``So the situation is not sufficiently clear with regard to those
questions.''
	   Vedrine spoke as Russian President Boris Yeltsin struggled to
get lawmakers in the Communist-led Dumas to approve his prime
minister-nominee, Viktor Chernomyrdin. But the opposition is
demanding concessions on market-oriented reform supported by the
International Monetary Fund.
	   ``The whole question revolves around how the IMF will be able to
formulate its demands, eventual conditions, and in what form they
can be integrated by the Russian authorities in a way that at the
same time is supported by the Dumas and the Russian people.
	   ``It's up to them to find that synthesis,'' Vedrine said after a
meeting with Dutch Foreign Minister Jozias van Aartsen.
	   A second loan installment of dlrs 4.3 billion, part of a dlrs
22.3 billion IMF rescue package, was scheduled to be made on Sept.
15. But IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus said Friday that
this would occur only if Russia's parliament passes a package of
reform measures.
	   On Franco-Dutch relations, the two foreign ministers avoided
commenting on the showdown in spring over who should head the
European Central Bank.
	   France had insisted the Netherland's Wim Duisenberg had agreed
to step down after four years, making way for Bank of France
Governor, Jean-Claude Trichet. But Duisenberg has left open the
possibility he may not quit early.
	   ``It's a discussion from back in May and I have nothing to add
to what has happened since then,'' van Artsen said.
	   ``It was not a problem between us and, by the way, we didn't
talk about it,'' Vedrine said.
	   Vedrine said fighting illegal drugs, once ``a subject of
differences and misunderstanding, has again become a subject of
common effort between the two countries.''
	   Van Aartsen agreed that police cooperation ``is very good, very
fruitful,'' though neither official elaborated.
	   The two countries' relations strained in recent years as France
sought to crack down on drug smuggling from Holland, whose laws are
considered more permissive.

Sri Lanka demand an explanation after Lloyd's comments
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By IHITHISHAM KAMARDEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Sri Lanka reacted strongly to David Lloyd's
remarks on off-spinner Muttiah Muralitharan's action and demanded
an explanation from the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB)
Monday.
	   Lloyd, the England coach cast cloud of suspicion over Sri
Lanka's double-jointed bowler, as his side slumped to defeat in the
one-off test.
	   Muralitharan, 26, was no-balled seven times by Australian umpire
Darrell Hair during Sri Lanka's second test against Australia at
Melbourne on Boxing Day 1995.
	   But Muralitharan, who has taken 201 test wickets in 42 tests so
far, has since been cleared after medical evidence confirmed a
physical deformity on both his arms.
	   Muralitharan, bowls with a bent right arm that cannot be
straightened.
	   ``We don't want a repetition of what happened before,'' said an
angry Thilanga Sumathipala, the president of the Board of Control
for Cricket in Sri Lanka (BCCSL).
	   ``If there were any concerns he should have gone to the match
referee, not the media,'' said Sumathipala.
	   ``I will make my opinions known to the appropriate
authorities,'' Lloyd said of Muralitharan. ``I am not going any
further than that, I am not prepared to make any more comment,''
Lloyd said after the fourth day's play.
	   ``I have brought it to the attention of the ECB and I want to
know what concerns he has, it was all highly uncalled for,''
Sumathipala said.
	   ``It is also totally disappointing from the Sri Lankan public's
point of view. This has been a successful tour up to now,
everything was positive and it is disappointing for something like
this to happen now.''
	   Sri Lanka, the reigning one-day world champions, went into the
test following its triumph in the triangular series that included
England and South Africa.
	   Match referee Ahmed Ebrahim confirmed he had studied Lloyd's
comments but decided against a hearing.
	   ``Claiming someone had an `unorthodox action did not contravene
the ICC's code of conduct,'' Ahmed said.
	   Richard Peel, the ECB's Director of Corporate Affairs, said,
Lloyd would be spoken to at the end of the test.

North Korean missile flies over Japan and lands in Pacific: Report
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Japanese defense spokesman confirming missile
likely passed over Japan; ADDS backround, other details RESTORES
byline
 &UR; By TODD ZAUN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ North Korea fired a ballistic missile on Monday
that likely flew over northeastern Japan and landed in the Pacific
Ocean, a spokesman for Japan's Defense Agency said.
	   The first stage of the missile landed in waters between Russia
and Japan, but the second stage crossed over Japan and fell into
the Pacific Ocean several hundred kilometers (miles) off the main
Japanese island of Honshu, spokesman Toru Kawajiri said.
	   A two-stage ballistic missile combines two engines, with the
first falling away after its burns up its fuel and a second that
then ignites and proceeds to another target.
	   The launch just after noon (0300 GMT) was confirmed by Japanese,
South Korean and United States defense officials. It was North
Korea's first test-firing of a missile in five years and its fourth
since 1984.
	   In response, Japan Monday refused to back a long-planned
agreement to help fund two nuclear reactors for North Korea.
	   Japan's Defense Agency, quoting unidentified U.S. military
officials, said the missile's first stage landed in waters between
Russia and Japan about 300 kilometers (190 miles) southeast of
Vladivostok, Russia.
	   The missile was ``confirmed to be a brand-new `Daepodong I' with
a range of 2,000 kilometers (1,240 miles),'' the South Korean
Defense Ministry said in a statement.
	   The test was the first launch by North Korea of a two-stage
missile and marks a significant step forward in its rocket
technology. Japan's state-run NHK TV said the missile may have been
powerful enough to exit the Earth's atmosphere before streaking
back down toward the Pacific.
	   ``We see this as a very dangerous act,'' said chief government
spokesman Hiromu Nonaka. He said Japan would express its concern to
the North through diplomatic channels.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, visiting Sarajevo,
told reporters she was also alarmed by the test launch.
	   ``This is something that we will be raising with North Koreans
in the talks that are currently going on,'' she said.
	   Those talks, in New York, are over a proposal for the North to
suspend missile development in exchange for nuclear energy
know-how, and some Korea watchers said they suspect the launch was
timed to up the stakes.
	   ``Kim is good at brinksmanship,'' said Hajime Izumi, a noted
North Korea watcher and professor at Shizuoka University, referring
to North Korea's leader Kim Jong Il.
	   ``This shows that North Korea can make effective missiles,'' he
added. ``What remains to be seen is if they can mass produce them,
or deploy them.''
	   Masahiro Akiyama, deputy director of Japan's Defense Agency,
said the launch was not totally a surprise _ security experts, he
said, had been increasing their surveillance of the North since
earlier this month.
	   Stalinist North Korea, which over the past few years has been
foundering under devastating famines, is to convene its newly
elected parliament on Sept. 5, and are expected to elect Kim as the
country's president.
	   In June, North Korea also admitted for the first time that it
has sold missiles abroad. It had long been suspected of selling
missiles to Iran and Syria.
	   But very little is known about North Korea's missile program,
and its possession of a significantly better missile would be a
matter of serious concern throughout the region.
	   North Korea's best-known ballistic missile is the Rodong, which
has a range of about 1,000 kilometers (620 miles). It was last test
fired in 1993, and also landed in the same area of the Sea of
Japan, which divides the Korean Peninsula from Japan.
	   With its 1,000 kilometer (620-mile range), the Rodong I missile,
a modified Scud, could strike South Korea and much of Japan. The
newer missile would put most of Japan within range.
	   In 1996, the United States began talks with North Korea aimed at
persuading the secretive Communist country to freeze its missile
program and to join an international agreement designed to restrict
missile proliferation. The talks stalled.
	   Japan is currently boosting its budget for joint development of
a missile defense system with the United States and has reportedly
earmarked 500 million yen (dlrs 3.6 million) for the project next
year.
	   The attack comes a day before Japanese and South Korean defense
officials are scheduled to meet in Tokyo.
	   The United States has 37,000 troops stationed in South Korea,
many of them based near its border with North Korea. It has roughly
another 50,000 troops in Japan.
	   Monday's was the secretive North's fourth test-firing of a
missile since 1984 and its first in five years.

	   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) _ Sudan's foreign minister said Monday
that if Washington acknowledged its error in bombing a factory in
Khartoum, Sudan was prepared ``to turn the page.''
	   Washington's attacks on targets in Sudan and Afghanistan - a
reprisal for the bombings of two U.S. embassies in Africa - was a
hot issue Monday at a summit of the Nonaligned Movement.
	   A movement committee on Sunday called for an independent
investigation of whether the factory hit by U.S. missiles was a
chemical weapons plant, as Washington claims, or a pharmaceutical
factory, as Sudan maintained.
	   ``We feel that what was passed yesterday was a step forward to
introduce justice,'' Sudanese foreign Minister Mustafa Osman Ismail
told The Associated Press.
	   ``We are open to turn the page against the U.S.A. if they
acknowledge they got wrong information'' about the nature of the
plant, he said at an earlier news conference.
	   There was no immediate reaction from the United States' first
official observer to a NAM summit, diplomat Princeton Lyman, who
stayed away from reporters.
	   In a news conference earlier, Ismail said Sudan would not
respond with an attack for the bombing of the Khartoum factory,
saying Sudan would reply through forums like the NAM and the United
Nations and if necessary, seek a hearing at the International Court
of Justice in the Hague, Netherlands.
	   The movement's 12th summit is pulling together an expected 52
heads of state and representatives of about 100 nations in all.
Heads of state meet Wednesday and Thursday. Formed during the
height of the Cold War to fend off domination by the White House
and the Kremlin, the movement is now struggling to define a new
role.
	   South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, welcoming foreign
ministers to the summit, said the Nonaligned Movement should
advance the cause of the poor.
	   ``The world economy should be managed in a way that ensures the
transfer of resources from those who have them to those that do
not,'' he said, noting that rich countries have no moral imperative
to share their wealth.
	   ``The new God of our world, the market, is not informed by a
tablet of commandments on which is inscribed: `Thou shalt banish
poverty in the world.' ''
	   Other summit topics include the war in Congo, in which rebels
allegedly supported by Rwanda and Uganda, are fighting President
Laurent Kabila's forces, which are being backed by soldiers from
Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia.
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan planned to meet at the summit
with regional leaders on the Congo crisis. He was expected to
arrive Tuesday, officials said. Kabila was not likely to attend.
	   Delegates from India and Pakistan said they hoped to hold
bilateral talks on the recent nuclear arms testing by both
countries.
	   Pakistani Foreign Minister Sartag Aziz essentially ruled out any
nuclear disarmament unless the dispute over Kashmir, a region
claimed by both India and Pakistan, is settled.
	   ``We don't want to engage in a nuclear arms race,'' Aziz said in
an interview. ``But for a nuclear stand down, we must deal with the
underlying issues.''
	   Indian foreign Minister Sasundhara Raje said she wanted further
talks on a moratorium on building nuclear weapons, and a ban on
first-strike use of the weapons.
	   ``I think that at the end of the day, we will be able to work
out a solution'' she told AP.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Typhoon Rex veered away from Japan's main island of
Honshu on Monday, but the record rainfall it spawned forced
thousands to flee their homes.
	   Flooding and landslides caused by the rains have killed 16
people and injured 46 others since Thursday, said National Police
Agency spokesman Keiichi Nakamura. Five people have been reported
missing, he said.
	   National broadcaster NHK reported the death total had risen to
17 people as of 8 p.m. (1100gmt), but police were unable to confirm
the figure.
	   Rex, swirling with winds of up to 126 kph (80 mph), was located
470 kilometers (282 miles) east-southeast of Hachijojima island in
the Pacific as of 6 p.m. (0900gmt) Monday, the Meteorological
agency said.
	   Hachijojima is about 250 kilometers (150 miles) south of Tokyo.
	   It was headed away from heavily populated eastern Honshu, moving
east-northeast at a speed of 20 kilometers (12 miles) per hour, the
agency said.
	   Still, heavy rains it caused were forecast to pour down on much
of flooded northeastern Japan until at least early Tuesday.
	   Some 90,000 people have been instructed to evacuate their homes
in four prefectures, or states, near Tokyo and NHK reported 7,300
people were evacuated from their home as of 8 p.m. (1100gmt).
	   Some areas were expected to receive up to 100 millimeters (4
inches) of additional rain on Monday.
	   The dead included a 73-year-old woman who was fatally injured
Sunday in a landslide caused by heavy rains in Fukushima
prefecture, 239 kilometers (148 miles) northeast of Tokyo, the
Asahi newspaper reported.
	   Casualties and damage have spread to at least 22 prefectures.
The National Police Agency said 144 residences have been partly or
totally destroyed and that 11,954 homes have been flooded as of 10
p.m. (1300gmt).
	   Yuki Takagi, administrative vice minister of Agriculture,
Forestry and fisheries, said at a press conference Monday that
damage to forests and farms was estimated at 7.4 billion yen (dlrs
51 million).
	   In addition, about 8,000 hectares (19,760 acres of rice fields
were flooded and officials are investigating the damage, Takagi
said.
	   Adding an air of urgency to flood damage control efforts, the
Japanese government decided Monday to convene a meeting of the
nation's Central Disaster Prevention Council, Kyodo News reported.
	   The flooding has also closed some roads and halted train
service. East Japan Railway Co. on Monday canceled its regular
Yamagata Shinkansen bullet trains for a third day, said company
spokesman Hiroshiku Ikeda.
	   As of 10 p.m., the police agency said roads were destroyed at
1,229 places, landslides were reported at 1,658 sites and 47
bridges were washed away.
	   The rains topped television news broadcasts and were reported
with banner headlines in Monday morning newspapers.

	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Former Ajax and AC Milan star
Frank Rijkaard was named Monday as the new coach of the Dutch
national soccer team.
	   Rijkaard replaces Guus Hiddink, who joined Spanish giant Real
Madrid after guiding the Netherlands to fourth place in the
summer's World Cup finals in France. Rijkaard was Hiddink's
assistant during the tournament.
	   ``This is an honor and a challenge,'' Rijkaard said. ``I was
very happy to accept and will work very hard.''
	   He signed a contract until the end of the European Championships
in 2000, which are being co-hosted by the Netherlands and Belgium.
The contract has an option to extend for a further two years.
	   The 35-year-old former Ajax and AC Milan player was a star of
the Dutch team that won the 1988 European Championships. He played
73 internationals for the Netherlands, scoring 10 goals from the
midfield.
	   Another former Dutch great, Johan Neeskens, was appointed as
Rijkaard's assistant. Neeskens also was part of Hiddink's World Cup
management team.
	   Rijkaard, who only ended his playing days at the end of the 1995
season, was considered by many an outsider for the coach's job.
Former Celtic manager Wim Jansen was many pundits' favorite to take
over from Hiddink.
	   ``I cannot deny that this was a surprise for me,'' Rijkaard
said. ``I am unbelievably happy.''

Thai police arrest five Thais and an Indian for money
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thai police arrested six people Monday
for siphoning about 125 million baht (dlrs 3 million) from the bank
account of an aerospace company by forging signatures on bank
transfers.
	   The money came from an account of the company GKN Aerospace
deposited with Germany's Commerzbank, police said.
	   The company from which the money was stolen is apparently the
same as the British-based company called GKN Westland Aerospace.
	   Police said the gang forged the signatures of executives of the
aerospace company, faxing orders to Commerzbank to transfer money
to accounts in Thailand and Dubai.
	   The forgeries were carried out by a man police identified as
Peter Avid, an Indian with residence in England. The five other
suspects are Thai nationals.
	   About 55 million baht (dlrs 1.3 million) was transferred into
bank accounts in Thailand while another 70 million baht (dlrs 1.7
million) went to accounts in Dubai.
	   Police arrested the six suspects after receiving information
from a GKN representative who flew to Thailand to track down the
lost money.
	   Police said they would investigate further to see if any Thai
bank officers were involved in the scam.

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The cream of Belgian socialists in the
1980s _ foremost among them ex-NATO chief Willy Claes _ goes on
trial Wednesday on corruption charges stemming from defense
contracts in the late 1980s.
	   The high court hearings _ in an ornate courtroom that has
undergone a dlrs 500,000 face-lift for the occasion _ will last
several months.
	   Allegations that Claes and nine others pocketed millions of
dollars in bribes has generated massive media coverage creating a
mood akin to the one that gripped Italy in 1992 when its
long-dominant Christian Democrats disappeared under the weight of
corruption scandals.
	   ``We start to look a little bit like the Italians,'' according
to Rik de Cauwelaert, a political analyst. ``This is the trial of
an old political regime.''
	   Claes and his fellow defendants deny any wrongdoing. Claes quit
as NATO secretary general Oct. 19, 1995 because of corruption
charges dating back to his days as economics minister.
	   On trial with him will be ex-defense minister Guy Coeme,
ex-deputy prime minister Guy Spitaels and senior officials of
Belgium's Dutch and French-speaking socialist parties.
	   They are accused of taking bribes in exchange for awarding two
defense contracts: an 8-billion-franc (dlrs 216.2-million) deal
awarded Dec. 8, 1988 to Italy's Agusta SpA for 46 army helicopters
and _ on April 28, 1989 and worth 6.5 billion francs (dlrs 175.6
million) _ a deal for Electronique Serge Dassault, a subsidiary of
France's Dassault Aviation SA, to equip Belgian F-16 jets with new
electronics.
	   Prosecutors allege Agusta paid 51 million francs (dlrs 1.37
million) and Dassault 60 million francs (dlrs 1.62 million) in
bribes to Dutch and French-speaking socialists who are split into
separate parties.
	   Serge Dassault of Dassault Aviation is also a defendant. Charges
have been dropped against ex-Agusta executive Raffaelo Teti who
died Aug. 22 of a heart attack.
	   Prosecutors allege the defendants and the companies conspired to
funnel money from Swiss banks into socialist pockets through
Luxembourg banks and phony companies and foundations.
	   Until 1989, it was legal for companies to give money to Belgian
political parties provided they did not demand and get favors in
return.
	   Prosecutors must show the Agusta and Dassault ``gifts'' were so
closely timed to the awarding of the defense contracts that they
just had to be bribes and senior officials, including Claes, had to
know that.
	   In 1989, Belgium outlawed corporate donations to politicians and
instituted government subsidies and put a ceiling on campaign
spending. In 1998, these subsidies total 640 million francs (dlrs
17.3 million).
	   Agusta and Dassault, it was argued at the time, won their
contracts because they offered better economic compensation than
their rivals _ respectively France's Aerospatiale SA and Litton
Industries Inc. of the United States. Such compensation usually
means promises to create jobs in return for winning the defense
contracts.
	   Dassault won the F-16 deal although Litton's bid was cheaper and
preferred by the military. Prosecutors now say economic
compensation talks with Dassault never took place.
	   Claes, Coeme and Spitaels have long been linked to political and
financial scandals.
	   Coeme, the former defense minister, got a two-year suspended
jail term in 1996 for corruption involving a socialist polling
institute that was overpaid for doing unnecessary,
politically-tainted surveys for the government.
	   The fate of Belgian socialists is not identical to that of
Italian christian democrats in 1992. Regardless of what happens to
Claes and the others, socialists remain very much in power.
	   They are the coalition partners of Prime Minister Jean-Luc
Dehaene's christian democrats.
	   Only days before the trial, leaders of the French-speaking
socialists denied charges they sought to intimidate the defendants
by urging them not to divulge too much. `Knack' magazine reported
that in return for such discretion, the party would pay their legal
bills

Red Cross: Cross-border shelling displaces 55,000 in east Sudan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Shelling across Eritrea's border with Sudan
apparently caused more than 55,000 people to flee their homes in
eastern Sudan, the Red Cross said Monday.
	   Hundreds of families have fled in an exodus from border villages
since January, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red
Crescent Societies said in a statement. Fighting in the past month
has forced many to move on for a second time, it added.
	   According to Red Cross officials who have visited the Shamboub
camp and others, 36,000 people with few supplies are housed in
makeshift facilities set up since outbreaks of fighting started in
January.
	   Paul Stromberg, a spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees, said the agency had so far been unable to reach the site
and could not comment on the number or condition of people there.
	   Sudanese Red Crescent workers report respiratory problems,
diarrhea and undernourished children suffering from fever and other
infections, the Red Cross said.
	   Villagers in eastern Sudan's arid border area are also at risk
from land mines, it added.
	   Sudan in June accused Eritrea of bombarding seven of its border
posts, but Sudanese rebels said their forces carried out the
attack.
	   Earlier this year, a border dispute between neighboring Eritrea
and Ethiopia boiled over into armed clashes. Hundreds of people
have been killed in that conflict.
	   Sudan has severed relations with both Eritrea and Ethiopia, and
accuses the two countries of harboring insurgents. Eritrea has
denied involvement in the shelling.
	   Sudanese rebels have been fighting the government for the past
two years in eastern Sudan and since 1983 in southern Sudan, where
the mainly Christian and animist population seeks autonomy from the
Muslim north.
	   Eritrea hosts a variety of both armed and unarmed Sudanese
opposition groups, and the government of President Isaias Afwerki
makes no secret of its hostility to the National Islamic Front
government in Sudan.

Organizers insist Euro 2000 preparations are on track
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIKE CORDER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROTTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Rejecting reported UEFA criticism,
the Euro 2000 tournament director insisted Monday that preparations
for the soccer championships jointly hosted by Belgium and the
Netherlands are on track.
	   Alain Courtois' comments followed reports that UEFA, European
soccer's governing body, was considering moving the championships
to another host country because of fears that building work at
three Belgian stadiums was lagging behind schedule.
	   Grounds in Charleroi, Bruges and Liege need extensive renovation
work to improve capacity and security for the championships due to
kick off in June 2000 and there are fears that they may not all be
ready. But Courtois was adamant the modernization would all be
completed on time.
	   ``I read that the Netherlands may become a victim of the slow
work at Belgian stadiums,'' he said. ``That is not true. That is
totally untrue. Work on the stadiums in Belgium is on schedule.''
	   The 2000 tournament marks the first time a European Championship
has been co-hosted by two nations.
	   Courtois said the stadium in Bruges would be ready by the end of
this year while the grounds in Liege and Charleroi would be ready
by June 1999, a year before the tournament kicks off.
	   The tournament is due to be played at eight venues; four in the
Netherlands and four in Belgium. The Dutch grounds are all
completed while Brussels' 50,000-seat King Boudewijn stadium is the
only Belgian stadium ready for Euro 2000 to start.
	   Organizers will meet Thursday with a UEFA delegation to discuss
the public row and progress being made in the preparations.
	   They are also planning a press presentation at the end of
October to unveil the progress and the tournament's ticketing
policy. Tickets are due to go on sale later this year.
	   Planners of this summer's World Cup finals in France came under
fire because not enough fans outside France were able to buy
tickets. Courtois said Euro 2000 organizers had learned lessons
from their French counterparts. He would not be more specific but
did stress that most Euro 2000 tickets would be cheaper than those
for the World Cup in France.
	   ``We want to make sure the ordinary fan can afford a ticket,''
he said.
	   The governments of both host nations also reportedly came under
fire from UEFA officials for their lukewarm support of the
championships.
	   Dutch and Belgian officials have said they will deploy as few
possible police at grounds during the tournament because of the
high cost. They also would like to see the tournament cut from
three to two weeks as a way of reducing the potential for crowd
trouble.

Buffaloes beat BlueWave 12-5
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Phil Clark drove in five runs with two doubles and
a single as the Pacific League's Kintetsu Buffaloes downed the Orix
BlueWave 12-5 at Kobe Monday and ended their losing streak at six.
	   The Buffaloes moved into second place, as the Seibu Lions'
scheduled game with the Chiba Lotte Marines was rained out.
	   The Buffaloes are three games behind the front-running Nippon
Ham Fighters.
	   Clark, formerly with the Boston Red Sox, doubled home two runs
in the first inning and singled home a run in the second, both
against William Patrick Fraser.
	   Clark hit a two-run double in the eighth against Yoshinori
Satoh.
	   Fraser, formerly with the Montreal Expos, gave up 11 hits and
eight runs over seven innings and took the loss. He is 5-5.
	   No other games were scheduled Monday.

Steelers' Wiggins suspended for taking muscle builder
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PITTSBURGH (AP) _ What's good for Mark McGwire isn't good for
Pittsburgh Steelers tackle Paul Wiggins.
	   The National Football League has suspended Wiggins for taking
androstenedione, the same muscle-building supplement that McGwire
takes. Wiggins will miss the first four weeks of the NFL season.
	   The NFL bans the use of the supplement, while major league
baseball does not.
	   ``I don't blame Mark McGwire for taking a legal supplement,''
Wiggins, a backup offensive tackle, said Sunday. ``He's an athlete
trying to get the best edge he can. But, yes, selfishly, it's
unfair that he's a pro athlete and I am too, and he can take it and
I can't. It's a different set or rules and there's nothing I can do
about it.''
	   McGwire plays for the St. Louis Cardinals and leads major league
baseball in home runs this season.
	   Wiggins said he bought the supplement at a store in Oregon and
didn't know it was forbidden by the NFL. He said he took it in June
and stopped taking it before he arrived at Steelers camp.
	   A routine urine test revealed he had been taking it.
	   Wiggins, a third-round draft pick from Oregon in 1997, is in his
second season with the Steelers.
	   The testosterone-boosting pill is banned by the National
Football League, the International Olympic Committee and the
National Collegiate Athletic Association. The National Basketball
Association does not ban its use, and the league policy on it has
not come under review.

Russian navy to extract sailors' remains from WWII submarine
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's navy is preparing to extract the remains
of Soviet sailors killed when their submarine was sunk near Sweden
during World War II, a news agency reported Monday.
	   Amateur divers from Sweden found the S-7 submarine this summer.
The Russian navy then requested permission from Swedish authorities
to remove the remains of the 43 Soviet sailors who died in the
attack and to survey World War II-era torpedoes believed to be in
the vessel, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   A Finnish submarine sank the Soviet sub in 1942, while it was on
a mission to destroy transport vessels running from Sweden to
Germany, ITAR-Tass said. Finland fought the Soviet Union during
that war, in which Sweden was neutral.
	   Russia may decide to extract only the sailors' remains, and
leave the submarine where it lies in waters 30 to 40 meters (90 to
130 feet) deep.

Israeli ends first year of 15-year term in underwear spy case
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MAE GHALWASH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ An Israeli Arab is in ``rather good shape''
after completing the first year of a 15-year jail term for
allegedly spying on Egypt using women's underwear soaked in
invisible ink, the Israeli Embassy said Monday.
	   The case of Azam Azam, a member of the Israeli Druse minority,
stirred already tense relations between Egypt and Israel last year,
and drew wide interest because of its bizarre nature.
	   Egyptian prosecutors accused Azam of supplying women's underwear
coated with invisible ink to an Egyptian accomplice. The underwear
destined for Israel could allegedly be used for writing secret
messages about Egyptian factories and Egypt's treatment of its
citizens who had dealings with Israel's embassy in Cairo.
	   Israel denied Azam was a spy and said the case was fabricated.
Egypt rejected that and a court sentenced him last Aug. 31.
	   On Monday, Assad Assad, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's consultant on Druse affairs, and the Israeli Consul to
Egypt, Eli Levi, visited Azam at the maximum security al-Torah
prison, south of Cairo.
	   ``He is in a rather good shape. Not perfect, but rather good,''
Ayellet Yehiav, a spokeswoman for the Israeli embassy in Cairo,
said after the meeting that lasted 1 hour 50 minutes.
	   Azam complained of heart pains but was allowed to see a doctor
``so it seems like he is being treated,'' Yehiav said.
	   The embassy has not seen any medical reports, she added.
	   Senior Israeli officials are discussing Azam's case with Egypt,
Yehiav said.
	   Israeli officials and family members see Azam during the two
visits he is allowed every month, Yehiav said.
	   Azam's Egyptian accomplice, Emad Abdel-Hamid Ismail, was
sentenced to 25 years in prison. Two Israeli Arab women accused of
recruiting Ismail were sentenced in absentia to 25 years in prison
in the same trial.

Organizers insist Euro 2000 preparations are on track
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIKE CORDER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROTTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Rejecting reported UEFA criticism,
the Euro 2000 tournament director insisted Monday that preparations
for the soccer championships jointly hosted by Belgium and the
Netherlands are on track.
	   Alain Courtois' comments followed reports that UEFA, European
soccer's governing body, was considering moving the championships
to another host country because of fears that building work at
three Belgian stadiums was lagging behind schedule.
	   Grounds in Charleroi, Bruges and Liege need extensive renovation
work to improve capacity and security for the championships due to
kick off in June 2000 and there are fears that they may not all be
ready. But Courtois was adamant the modernization would all be
completed on time.
	   ``I read that the Netherlands may become a victim of the slow
work at Belgian stadiums,'' he said. ``That is not true. That is
totally untrue. Work on the stadiums in Belgium is on schedule.''
	   The 2000 tournament marks the first time a European Championship
has been co-hosted by two nations.
	   Courtois said the stadium in Bruges would be ready by the end of
this year while the grounds in Liege and Charleroi would be ready
by June 1999, a year before the tournament kicks off.
	   The tournament is due to be played at eight venues; four in the
Netherlands and four in Belgium. The Dutch grounds are all
completed while Brussels' 50,000-seat King Boudewijn stadium is the
only Belgian stadium ready for Euro 2000 to start.
	   Organizers will meet Thursday with a UEFA delegation to discuss
the public row and progress being made in the preparations.
	   They are also planning a press presentation at the end of
October to unveil the progress and the tournament's ticketing
policy. Tickets are due to go on sale later this year.
	   Planners of this summer's World Cup finals in France came under
fire because not enough fans outside France were able to buy
tickets. Courtois said Euro 2000 organizers had learned lessons
from their French counterparts. He would not be more specific but
did stress that most Euro 2000 tickets would be cheaper than those
for the World Cup in France.
	   ``We want to make sure the ordinary fan can afford a ticket,''
he said.
	   The governments of both host nations also reportedly came under
fire from UEFA officials for their lukewarm support of the
championships.
	   Dutch and Belgian officials have said they will deploy as few
possible police at grounds during the tournament because of the
high cost. They also would like to see the tournament cut from
three to two weeks as a way of reducing the potential for crowd
trouble.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Lawmakers voted overwhelmingly Monday to reject
the appointment of Viktor Chernomyrdin as prime minister despite
warnings that Russia was on the verge of political and economic
collapse.
	   The Duma, lower chamber of Parliament, voted by 251-94 not to
confirm Chernomyrdin after more than three hours of bitter debating
in the chamber. Hard-line delegates called for President Boris

MOSCOW:the crisis.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov said Chernomyrdin, who had
been premier until April, was responsible for many of Russia's
current problems and his return to power would only make things
worse.
	   ``You will fail and bring the country to ruin,'' he told
Chernomyrdin during the debate before the vote.
	   Yeltsin said earlier he would nominate Chernomyrdin again if the
Duma voted against the premier, aides said.
	   Both sides warned that popular discontent could explode if the
crisis continues. ``If we fail to reach an agreement here
everything will spill out to the streets,'' Zyuganov said.
	   Yeltsin's parliamentary envoy Alexander Kotenkov warned the
opposition that both sides could be swept aside if there is no
swift action to end the crisis.
	   ``If this chaos lasts for several more weeks, it may happen that
there will be neither Communists nor us,'' he said. ``I mean a
popular uprising, merciless and senseless.''
	   Some Communist leaders said they were not afraid of government
threats to dissolve the legislature because they were confident of
winning the elections that would follow.
	   The government insisted it remained in control and that work on
tackling the country's economic crisis was going ahead. ``It is
business as usual for government headquarters,'' said government
spokesman Igor Shabdurasulov.
	   But Zyuganov indicated before the vote that he was ready for
more negotiations, signaling a deal was still possible.
	   ``There's no guarantee that full agreement will be reached
today. We're ready to take another look at it today,'' he told
reporters.
	   There was no sign of panic in Moscow and other cities Monday.
The Russian currency staged a mild recovery after last week's sharp
falls, although official trading remained suspended for a fourth
day.
	   Chernomyrdin told the Duma the government would take urgent
steps to prop up banks, protect individuals' accounts. He also
called for a program to prop up the ruble, lower taxes and revive
the industrial sector, but gave no details.
	   Government and opposition leaders reached tentative agreement
Sunday on a pact under which parliament would approve the new
government and give it a chance to solve the economic crisis. In
return, Yeltsin was to give parliament a bigger role in approving
the Cabinet.
	   But the Communists rejected the deal Sunday evening. Zyuganov
said his party's leadership could not support the pact because
there was no firm guarantee Yeltsin would abide by its provisions.
	   The Kremlin said Monday that Yeltsin would not accept the truce
until the opposition accepted it.
	   The breakdown appeared likely to usher in a period of political
head-butting similar to the one that surrounded the nomination of
the previous prime minister, Sergei Kiriyenko, last spring. The
Communists want maximum concessions from the government and don't
want to anger their supporters by appearing to give in too easily.
	   Under the constitution, the Duma can vote three times on a prime
minister's nomination.

 &UR; Eds: SUBS first item on Monica Lewinsky to UPDATE with
HarperCollins denial &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Bidding for the Monica Lewinsky story could turn
her saga into the highest-priced sex story in history, according to
the New Yorker magazine.
	   The magazine reports in its Sept. 7 issue that the Star tabloid
sent Lewinsky a one-sentence offer promising ``one million dollars
for exclusive rights to her story _ if and when she should decide
to talk publicly.''
	   That bid was topped by publisher HarperCollins, which offered
dlrs 2 million for a book, the magazine said, citing a source
familiar with the offer. HarperCollins denied it made any such
offer.
	   Star editor-in-chief Phil Bunton said the price is being pushed
up because the market for sex stories is getting crowded.
	   ``When the (Gennifer) Flowers story first broke, the mainstream
press dumped all over us,'' Bunton said. ``Now they're every bit as
aggressive as we are in chasing the sex details.''
	   Clinton admitted to having an affair years ago with Flowers.
	   Despite the offers, there has been no indication Lewinsky is
willing to sell her story, the New Yorker said.
	   Judith Regan, head of Regan Books, a division of HarperCollins,
denied the New Yorker report in an interview with the New York
Post.
	   ``I did not offer Monica Lewinsky $2 million for a book,'' she
said. She said she hadn't talked to Ms. Lewinsky since January, and
suspected Ms. Lewinsky's mother, writer Marcia Lewis, was putting
out misleading information to drive the book offers up. Ms. Lewis
is the author of a book about the sex lives of famed tenors Luciano
Pavarotti, Placido Domingo and Jose Carreras.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Lawmakers voted overwhelmingly Monday to reject
the appointment of Viktor Chernomyrdin as prime minister despite
warnings that Russia was on the verge of political and economic
collapse.
	   The Duma, lower chamber of Parliament, voted by 251-94 not to
confirm Chernomyrdin after more than three hours of bitter debating
in the chamber. Hard-line delegates called for President Boris
Yeltisn's resignation.
	   Chernomyrdin pleaded before the vote with lawmakers to approve
the formation of a government to tackle the country's crisis that
has seen the stock market collapse and the devaluation of the
currency. The acting premier, who needed 226 votes for
confirmation, watched glumly as the Duma voted not to confirm him.
	   ``Russia is on the verge of political and economic collapse,''
he told the lower chamber of parliament at the start of his
confirmation hearings. He said not another hour could be wasted on
political bickering.
	   ``We can only come out of the crisis by uniting our efforts,''
he added.
	   Chernomyrdin's rejection will unleash new uncertainty at a time
when the government is battling to keep banks and other financial
institutions afloat. At the very least, Russia appears to face
protracted political in-fighting as the various political parties
battle to exploit the crisis.
	   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov said Chernomyrdin, who had
been premier until April, was responsible for many of Russia's
current problems and his return to power would only make things
worse.
	   ``You will fail and bring the country to ruin,'' he told
Chernomyrdin during the debate before the vote.
	   Yeltsin said earlier he would nominate Chernomyrdin again if the
Duma voted against the premier, aides said.
	   Both sides warned that popular discontent could explode if the
crisis continues. ``If we fail to reach an agreement here
everything will spill out to the streets,'' Zyuganov said.
	   Yeltsin's parliamentary envoy Alexander Kotenkov warned the
opposition that both sides could be swept aside if there is no
swift action to end the crisis.
	   ``If this chaos lasts for several more weeks, it may happen that
there will be neither Communists nor us,'' he said. ``I mean a
popular uprising, merciless and senseless.''
	   Some Communist leaders said they were not afraid of government
threats to dissolve the legislature because they were confident of
winning the elections that would follow.
	   The government insisted it remained in control and that work on
tackling the country's economic crisis was going ahead. ``It is
business as usual for government headquarters,'' said government
spokesman Igor Shabdurasulov.
	   But Zyuganov indicated before the vote that he was ready for
more negotiations, signaling a deal was still possible.
	   ``There's no guarantee that full agreement will be reached
today. We're ready to take another look at it today,'' he told
reporters.
	   There was no sign of panic in Moscow and other cities Monday.
The Russian currency staged a mild recovery after last week's sharp
falls, although official trading remained suspended for a fourth
day.
	   Chernomyrdin told the Duma the government would take urgent
steps to prop up banks, protect individuals' accounts. He also
called for a program to prop up the ruble, lower taxes and revive
the industrial sector, but gave no details.
	   Government and opposition leaders reached tentative agreement
Sunday on a pact under which parliament would approve the new
government and give it a chance to solve the economic crisis. In
return, Yeltsin was to give parliament a bigger role in approving
the Cabinet.
	   But the Communists rejected the deal Sunday evening. Zyuganov
said his party's leadership could not support the pact because
there was no firm guarantee Yeltsin would abide by its provisions.
	   The Kremlin said Monday that Yeltsin would not accept the truce
until the opposition accepted it.
	   The breakdown appeared likely to usher in a period of political
head-butting similar to the one that surrounded the nomination of
the previous prime minister, Sergei Kiriyenko, last spring. The
Communists want maximum concessions from the government and don't
want to anger their supporters by appearing to give in too easily.
	   Under the constitution, the Duma can vote three times on a prime
minister's nomination.

 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS year of Gulf War to 1991 sted 1990 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Here's a look at what kind of missiles North Korea
is believed to either have already produced or is currently
developing:
	   _THE DAEPODONG. South Korean officials said the missile launch
Monday was the first flight of this two-stage, liquid fuel missile
that would significantly increase the range of North Korea's rocket
forces. According to Jane's Strategic Weapon Systems, the Daepodong
1 could throw a 1,000 kilogram (450 pound) warhead 1,500 to 2,000
kilometers (950 to 1,250 miles), far enough to reach any target in
Japan and most major cities in China. A payload of that size is
large enough to carry nuclear and chemical weapons, as well as
conventional explosives. A much larger variant being developed
could possibly send a 1,500 kilogram (680 pound) warhead 3,500 to
6,000 kilometers (2,200 to 3,750 miles), or as far as southern
Alaska.
	   _THE RODONG. The Rodong 1 was test launched in 1993 and entered
service a year later. This single-staged liquid fuel missile can
fire a 1,000 kilogram (450 pound) warhead up to 1,000 kilometers
(620 miles), though it has never been fired more than 500
kilometers (310 miles). The Rodong 2 has a longer range of up to
1,500 kilometers (940 miles) but carries half the payload.
	   _SCUDS. Scuds B and C are North Korean variations on the
well-known Soviet design that saw service by Iraq in the 1991 Gulf
War. The two Scud types have ranges of 340 kilometers (210 miles)
and 500 kilometers (310 miles), respectively.

North Korea fires missile across northern Japan into Pacific

launch with upcoming U.S.-North Korean talks. CHANGES byline &QL; 
 &UR; By MARTIN FACKLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ In a bold act of brinkmanship, North Korea on
Monday launched a new long-range ballistic missile that crossed
over Japan's main island and crashed into the Pacific Ocean.
	   A Japanese defense official said the missile appears to have had
two stages, with the second probably flying over the northern tip
of Japan's main island and landing several hundred kilometers (a
few hundred miles) off its Pacific coast.
	   The first stage apparently dropped into the sea about 300
kilometers (180 miles) southeast of Vladivostok, Russia, said
Defense Agency spokesman Toru Kawajiri.
	   Kawajiri said the missile was believed to be a ``Daepodong I,''
a new and much more powerful rocket than the North had ever tested.
	   The launch comes just ahead of the convening of North Korea's
new parliament this Saturday for a congress expected to anoint
leader Kim Jong Il as the reclusive communist nation's president.
	   It also comes as North Korea and the United States are involved
in talks in New York over giving the North two badly needed
civilian nuclear reactors in return for it suspending missile and
atomic weapon development efforts.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, visiting Sarajevo,
said she was alarmed.
	   ``This is something that we will be raising with North Koreans
in the talks that are currently going on,'' she said.
	   Some Korea watchers, however, said the timing was likely a
bargaining ploy.
	   ``Kim is good at brinkmanship,'' said Hajime Izumi, a professor
at Shizuoka University. ``From Kim's perspective, this missile is
an important tool for gaining leverage, and he can use it to strike
a deal with the United States.''
	   Izumi said the North may also use threats to export the new
missile to countries such as Iran and Libya to extract a more
concessions.
	   But the test-launch threatened to backfire for the
cash-strapped, famine-devastated North.
	   Japan abruptly withdrew plans to extend dlrs 1 billion in aid to
the North to build the two civilian nuclear power reactors.
	   Japan also said it will confer soon with the United States and
South Korea, who are to put up most of the rest of the reactors'
dlrs 4.6 billion cost, about whether to continue with the aid
project.
	   The launch just after noon (0300 GMT) was confirmed by Japanese,
South Korean and United States defense officials. It was North
Korea's first test-firing of a missile in five years and its fourth
since 1984.
	   Monday's launch, however, was the first by North Korea of a
two-stage missile and marks a significant step forward in its
rocket technology. Japan's state-run NHK TV said the missile may
have been powerful enough to exit the Earth's atmosphere before
streaking back down toward the Pacific.
	   ``We see this as a very dangerous act,'' said chief government
spokesman Hiromu Nonaka.
	   Masahiro Akiyama, deputy director of Japan's Defense Agency,
said the launch was not totally a surprise _ security experts, he
said, had been increasing their surveillance of the North since
earlier this month.
	   But very little is known about North Korea's missile program,
and its possession of a significantly better missile would be a
matter of serious concern throughout the region.
	   North Korea's best-known ballistic missile is the Rodong, which
has a range of about 1,000 kilometers (620 miles). It was last test
fired in 1993, and also landed in the same area of the Sea of
Japan, which divides the Korean Peninsula from Japan.
	   The Daepodong missile launched Monday has the range to hit
almost any target in Japan and most cities in China.
	   According to Jane's Strategic Weapon Systems, the North is
developing a more powerful version of the Daepodong that may be
able to fly 6,000 kilometers (3,750 miles) _ far enough to hit
southern Alaska.

Albanian opposition urged to avoid violence at rally
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania _ Former President Sali Berisha declared that
his Democratic Party would hold an anti-government rally Monday
evening, despite police warnings of possible terrorist acts.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe said it
and other international organizations would closely monitor the
rally and urged all sides to avoid provocations and violence.
	   ``Violence is undemocratic, illegal and is not an acceptable
form of expression,'' said an OSCE statement issued two hours
before the beginning of the rally, scheduled for 6 p.m (1600 GMT).
	   This is one of several anti-government rallies that the
opposition has organized recently to protest the arrest of six of
its members. They were charged with crimes against humanity during
last year's insurgency following the collapse of pyramid schemes.
	   Meanwhile, the security situation is deteriorating in other
parts of the country. Albania's main north-south road was blocked
by armed civilians for a half-hour Monday afternoon near the
southern town of Gjirokaster, 145 kilometers (90 miles) from the
capital, Tirana, the state news agency ATA reported.
	   An explosion rocked a health institute Sunday night in the
northern town of Shkodra. Also, police arrested two men who
attempted to set the building of the ruling Socialist Party on
fire, ATA said.
	   Prime Minister Fatos Nano held an urgent cabinet meeting last
week to discuss new police measures to strengthen security in the
country.

U.S. envoy delivers U.S. documents on the Sakic case to Croatia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SNJEZANA VUKIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ A U.S. envoy handed over to Croatian
authorities Monday his country's files on Dinko Sakic, an alleged
World War II criminal who is to stand trial here later this year.
	   The envoy, David Scheffer, said the ``hefty pile of documents''
was collected in various archives in Washington D.C. as a part of a
U.S. efforts to assist Croatia in prosecuting Sakic.
	   Scheffer did not provide details of the files.
	   Sakic, 76, was extradited earlier this year from Argentina,
where he had lived quietly since Croatia's wartime Nazi puppet
state was defeated.
	   He is suspected of committing war crimes as the commander of the
notorious concentration camp of Jasenovac, where tens of thousands
of Serbs, Jews, Gypsies and insurgent Croats were killed.
	   Sakic is now in Zagreb's custody while pre-trial questioning of
witnesses is in progress.
	   Scheffer said the U.S. is ``very, very pleased and gratified''
by the efforts Croatia has made to bring Sakic to justice.
	   ``We believe that the primary goal that must be achieved ... is
a fair trial of this individual,'' he said.
	   The U.S. has ``great confidence that a transparent and fair
trial can proceed here,'' Scheffer said, referring to some western
concerns about possible official lenience toward Sakic in a country
where some are flirting with the kind of nationalism that harks
back to the pro-Nazi World War II state.
	   Still, the U.S. ``will watch (the case) very closely,'' he said.
	   Scheffer spoke to government officials here also about three
Yugoslav army officers, who were indicted by the U.N. war crimes
tribunal in The Hague for alleged massacres committed after the
Yugoslavia's army seized Croatia's eastern town of Vukovar during
the 1991 Serbo-Croat war.
	   Scheffer said the U.S. remains determined to see the three,
``who now live comfortably in Serbia,'' brought to justice.
	   The officers _ Col. Veselin Sljivancanin, Capt. Miroslav Radic
and Gen. Mile Mrksic _ remain at large.

Jewish leaders criticize plans to produce Fassbinder play
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VERENA SCHMITT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Jewish leaders have condemned an avant-garde
theater for deciding to stage a play by the late filmmaker Rainer
Werner Fassbinder that was attacked as anti-Semitic 13 years ago
after its one and only German performance.
	   ``Garbage, the City and Death,'' is to be performed at Berlin's
Maxim-Gorki Theater in May, according to director Bernd Wilms, who
announced the performance last week.
	   Wilms denied the play was anti-Semitic, saying instead that it
confronts themes of anti-Semitism and xenophobia. ``We believe
dealing with these subjects is urgently called for,'' he said
Monday.
	   The chairman of Berlin's Jewish community, Andreas Nachama, was
quoted in weekend newspapers as calling the play
``Goebbels-esque,'' referring to Adolf Hitler's propaganda minister
Joseph Goebbels.
	   Another Jewish leader, Michel Friedman, on Monday said the play
was ``interchangeable with a propaganda event of radical right-wing
parties.''
	   Nachama urged city officials to block production of the play so
that ``the wrong signal isn't sent from Berlin just a few decades
after the end of the Nazi incitement against Jewish people.''
	   Wilms said he hoped to discuss the play with Nachama. City
officials declined to comment.
	   Fassbinder, who died in 1982, was better known for directing
films about postwar Germany such as ``The Marriage of Maria
Braun.'' But he wrote ``Garbage, the City and Death'' in 1975, he
said, because he feared a resurgence of anti-Semitism in Germany.
	   The play tells the story of a prostitute and her pimp in
Frankfurt during the 1960s and 70s, when police were clearing
squatters from buildings. One character _ a rich, Jewish, real
estate speculator who is the target of insults _ is supposedly
based on Ignatz Bubis, a Frankfurt businessman and the chairman of
the Central Council of Jews in Germany.
	   The play was performed in Frankfurt in 1985, but only before an
audience of journalists. Condemned by Jewish leaders, including
Bubis, the play was never produced again in Germany, although it
has been staged around the world, including New York.

Congo's battling allies meet in Mozambique
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) _ The president of Angola, a key backer
of Congo's embattled Laurent Kabila, met for the first time with
Uganda's leader since fighting in Congo began a month ago and
discussed the crisis that threatens to tear apart central Africa.
	   Kabila accuses Uganda of backing insurgents seeking to topple
him, which Uganda denies. Angola has sent troops to support Kabila.
	   President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda sat down with his
counterpart from Angola, Eduardo dos Santos, in a session which
included two other regional leaders.
	   No details of the meeting, presided over by Mozambican President
Joaquin Chissano, emerged. President Didier Ratsiraka of Madagascar
also took part in talks by members of the Southern African
Development Community.
	   The 13-member community, so far fruitlessly, has been trying to
bring a halt to the war in Congo.
	   Zimbabwe and Namibia also are backing Kabila's government
troops. The allies appeared to have regained control of western
Congo by Sunday.
	   Chissano, along with South African President Nelson Mandela, has
opposed the military involvement.
	   The three presidents were to travel on to attend the Nonaligned
Movement summit in Durban, South Africa, where U.N. Secretary
General Kofi Annan was expected to meet with representatives from
all the countries involved in the Congo conflict.
	   Kabila was in Namibia on Monday, repeating accusations he made
in Zimbabwe on Sunday that South Africa has supplied arms to
Rwanda.
	   Chissano also met Monday with Algerian President Liamine Zeroual
on the second day of a three-day visit to discuss the founding of a
joint cooperation commission.

Russia shuts down last Baltic military base
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SKRUNDA, Latvia (AP) _ Russia on Monday began closing down the
Skrunda radar base, its last military operation in the Baltics,
ending a resented half-century military presence.
	   The announcement of the closing was made both by Latvia and
Russia. One Latvian Foreign Ministry official was allowed onto the
base to watch Russian soldiers begin the complex shutdown process.
	   ``This means that World War II is finally over for our
country,'' Foreign Minister Valdis Birkavs was quoted as saying by
the Baltic News Service.
	   The Soviet Union annexed Latvia and neighboring Lithuania and
Estonia in 1940. Nazi troops occupied the Baltics in 1941-44, but
the Red Army returned and tens of thousands of troops were
stationed there for decades.
	   The Skrunda station, which opened in 1971, was Russia's most
westerly radar facility and a key element in its defense network.
It was so important that Russia insisted on keeping the base even
after all other troops withdrew from the Baltics in 1994 and Latvia
grudgingly agreed to extend the lease.
	   ``It is very difficult now to compensate for a breech in the
radar space,'' Russian Major-General Anatoly Shishkin, chief of
staff of the missile-space defence, told the ITAR-Tass news agency.
``But the defense ministry has taken measures to partially
compensate for the breech.''
	   Despite the importance of the base, Russia is not known to have
put pressure on Latvia to keep it open beyond the Monday deadline
stipulated in the lease.
	   Latvian officials have Russia for sticking to terms of the
agreement, saying it would bode well for future bilateral relations
_ which have otherwise been strained over Moscow charges that
Latvia discriminates against its huge Russian-speaking minority.
	   The lease allows Russia another 18 months to dismantle the base.

	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Flash floods have killed 13 people and
injured 18 others in Yemen, a government official said Monday.
	   In addition to the casualties, which occurred in different parts
of Yemen Sunday, tens of houses were damaged by the floods, the
official said on customary condition of anonymity. No other details
were available.
	   According to government estimates, more than 100 people have
died over the past month from flash floods caused by heavy rains.
	   About 200 people died in floods in 1996 that swept through
several Yemeni provinces, causing damage estimated at dlrs 1.2
billion.

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Former NATO chief Willy Claes and other
top Belgian socialists go on trial Wednesday on corruption charges
stemming from defense contracts in the late 1980s.
	   The high court hearings _ in an ornate courtroom that has
undergone a dlrs 500,000 face-lift for the occasion _ will last
several months.
	   Allegations that Claes and nine others pocketed millions of
dollars in bribes has generated massive media coverage creating a
mood akin to the one that gripped Italy in 1992 when its
long-dominant Christian Democrats were crushed under the weight of
corruption scandals.
	   ``This is the trial of an old political regime,'' said Rik de
Cauwelaert, a political analyst.
	   Claes and his fellow defendants deny any wrongdoing. Claes quit
as NATO secretary general Oct. 19, 1995 because of corruption
charges dating back to his days as economics minister.
	   On trial with him will be ex-defense minister Guy Coeme,
ex-deputy prime minister Guy Spitaels and senior officials of
Belgium's Dutch and French-speaking socialist parties.
	   They are accused of taking bribes in exchange for awarding two
defense contracts: an 8-billion franc (dlrs 216-million) deal
awarded Dec. 8, 1988 to Italy's Agusta SpA for 46 army helicopters
and _ on April 28, 1989 and worth 6.5 billion francs (dlrs 175
million) _ a deal for Electronique Serge Dassault, a subsidiary of
France's Dassault Aviation SA, to equip Belgian F-16 jets with new
electronics.
	   Prosecutors allege Agusta paid 51 million francs (dlrs 1.4
million) and Dassault 60 million francs (dlrs 1.6 million) in
bribes to Dutch and French-speaking socialists who are split into
separate parties.
	   Prosecutors allege the defendants and the companies conspired to
funnel money from Swiss banks into socialist pockets through
Luxembourg banks and phony companies and foundations.
	   Until 1989, it was legal for companies to give money to Belgian
political parties provided they did not demand and get favors in
return.
	   Prosecutors must show the Agusta and Dassault ``gifts'' were so
closely timed to the awarding of the defense contracts that they
just had to be bribes and senior officials, including Claes, had to
know that.
	   In 1989, Belgium outlawed corporate donations to politicians and
instituted government subsidies and put a ceiling on campaign
spending. In 1998, these subsidies total 640 million francs (dlrs
17 million).
	   Agusta and Dassault, it was argued at the time, won the F-16
contracts because they offered to create more jobs than their
respective rivals _ France's Aerospatiale SA and Litton Industries
Inc. of the United States.
	   Claes, Coeme and Spitaels have long been linked to political and
financial scandals.
	   Coeme, the former defense minister, got a two-year suspended
jail term in 1996 for corruption involving a socialist polling
institute that was overpaid for doing government surveys.
	   The Belgian socialists will remain in power, regardless of what
happens to Claes and the others. They are the coalition partners of
Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene's Christian Democrats.

Legislature rejects formation of new government

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Chernomyrdin saying he will continue work on
forming Cabinet, Clinton arriving Tuesday, edits throughout &QL;

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Lawmakers voted overwhelmingly Monday to reject
the appointment of Viktor Chernomyrdin as prime minister despite
warnings that Russia was on the verge of political and economic
collapse.
	   The Duma, the lower chamber of Parliament, voted 251-94 not to
confirm Chernomyrdin after more than three hours of bitter debate.
Hard-line delegates called for President Boris Yeltsin's
resignation.
	   Chernomyrdin pleaded with lawmakers before the vote to approve
the formation of a government to tackle the country's crisis that
has seen the stock market collapse and the devaluation of the
currency. The acting premier, who needed 226 votes for
confirmation, watched glumly as the Duma voted not to confirm him.
	   ``Russia is on the verge of political and economic collapse,''
he told the lower chamber of parliament at the start of his
confirmation hearings. He said not another hour could be wasted on
political bickering.
	   ``We can only come out of the crisis by uniting our efforts,''
he added.
	   Chernomyrdin's rejection will unleash new uncertainty at a time
when the government is battling to keep banks and other financial
institutions afloat. At the very least, Russia appears to face
protracted political in-fighting as the various parties battle to
exploit the crisis.
	   The vote came on the eve of the arrival of U.S. President
Clinton for a previously scheduled summit with Yeltsin. The United
States, deeply concerned about what is happening in Moscow, has
urged Russia to continue with market reforms.
	   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov said Chernomyrdin, who had
been premier until April, was responsible for many of Russia's
current problems and his return to power would only make things
worse.
	   ``You will fail and bring the country to ruin,'' he told
Chernomyrdin during the debate before the vote.
	   Yeltsin said earlier he would nominate Chernomyrdin again if the
Duma voted against the premier, aides said. Before the vote,
Chernomyrdin said he would continue with plans to form a Cabinet
even if he was defeated.
	   Both sides warned that popular discontent could explode if the
crisis continues. ``If we fail to reach an agreement here
everything will spill out to the streets,'' Zyuganov said.
	   Yeltsin's parliamentary envoy Alexander Kotenkov warned the
opposition that both sides could be swept aside if there is no
swift action to end the crisis.
	   ``If this chaos lasts for several more weeks, it may happen that
there will be neither Communists nor us,'' he said. ``I mean a
popular uprising, merciless and senseless.''
	   Some Communist leaders said they were not afraid of government
threats to dissolve the legislature because they were confident of
winning the elections that would follow.
	   The government insisted it remained in control and that work on
tackling the country's economic crisis was going ahead. ``It is
business as usual for government headquarters,'' said government
spokesman Igor Shabdurasulov.
	   But Zyuganov indicated before the vote that he was ready for
more negotiations, signaling a deal was still possible.
	   ``There's no guarantee that full agreement will be reached
today. We're ready to take another look at it today,'' he told
reporters.
	   There was no sign of panic in Moscow and other cities Monday.
The Russian currency staged a mild recovery after last week's sharp
falls, although official trading remained suspended for a fourth
day.
	   Chernomyrdin told the Duma the government would take urgent
steps to prop up banks, protect individuals' accounts. He also
called for a program to prop up the ruble, lower taxes and revive
the industrial sector, but gave no details.
	   Government and opposition leaders reached tentative agreement
Sunday on a pact under which parliament would approve the new
government and give it a chance to solve the economic crisis. In
return, Yeltsin was to give parliament a bigger role in approving
the Cabinet.
	   But the Communists rejected the deal Sunday evening. Zyuganov
said his party's leadership could not support the pact because
there was no firm guarantee Yeltsin would abide by its provisions.
	   The Kremlin said Monday that Yeltsin would not accept the truce
until the opposition accepted it.
	   The breakdown appeared likely to usher in a period of political
head-butting similar to the one that surrounded the nomination of
the previous prime minister, Sergei Kiriyenko, last spring. The
Communists want maximum concessions from the government and don't
want to anger their supporters by appearing to give in too easily.
	   Under the constitution, the Duma can vote three times on a prime
minister's nomination.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Mark Ramprakash and Darren Gough delayed Sri
Lanka's push for victory in the one-off test with a stubborn ninth
wicket stand that has lasted an hour and a half at the Oval Monday.
	   The pair ensured Sri Lanka batted again in the test, and took
England from 127 for eight to 162 for eight at tea on the last, 16
runs ahead with No.11 Angus Fraser left to come.
	   Muralitharan, who took 7-155 in the first innings, followed it
up 7-64 in 47 overs as the England second innings nosed dived after
resuming the day on 54 for two.
	   Muralitharan has so far taken 14-219, the first time a visiting
spinner has taken 10 wickets in a test in England, since Pakistan's
Abdul Qadir took 10-211 at the Oval in 1987.
	   Muralitharan, 26, became only the second off spinner to claim
200 wickets behind West Indian Lance Gibbs, who had 309 in 79
tests.
	   Dominic Cork was his 200th victim, when wicketkeeper Romesh
Kaluwitharana, went sprawling to collect a top edged sweep, just
after lunch.
	   England, 116 for five at lunch, lost three more wickets, all to
Muralitharan before Ramprakash and Gough thwarted the visitors.
	   In fact Muralitharan, reached the milestone with the same number
of matches as Australian Shane Warne _ 42 tests _ after Australian
leg spinner Clarrie Grimmett raced to his in 36 matches.
	   Skipper Arjuna Ranatunga's gamble to put England into bat first,
worked to his side's advantage.
	   After the home side struggled to score 445 thanks to two
centuries by Graeme Hick and John Crawley, Sri Lanka, went on a
leatherhunt to amass 591.
	   Sri Lanka was inspired by a brilliant double-century by Sanath
Jayasuriya, 213 and a watchful 152 by Aravinda de Silva, as they
set the pace with a record 243-run third wicket stand.
	   Muralitharan's second innings haul was his 16th ``five'' in an
innings and his second 10-wicket match haul.
	   Ramprakash, 32 not out and Gough, unbeaten on 10, came together
after Ian Salisbury was trapped leg before wicket by Muralitharan.
	   After removing Crawley and Ben Hollioake with balls before and
after lunch, Muralitharan, did a short work on the lower-order,
claiming Cork and Salisbury in the space of five balls.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Duma rejecting Chernomyrdin as prime minister;
Kohl speaking with Chirac &QL; 
 &UR; By ANNE THOMPSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Chancellor Helmut Kohl reviewed Russia's worsening
economic and politicial crisis with U.S. President Bill Clinton
over the weekend, and Europe's finance chief called Monday for a
meeting of EU common currency nations.
	   Kohl consulted with Clinton just days before the U.S. president
was to begin a Moscow trip Tuesday for meetings aimed at helping
stabilize a Russian economy wracked by the devaluation of the ruble
and the government's default on its debts.
	   The German chancellor, in the midst of campaigning for Sept. 27
national elections, also spoke by telephone with Russian President
Boris Yeltsin and with British Prime Minister Tony Blair, a Kohl
spokesman said. He spoke Monday with French President Jacques
Chirac.
	   ``Both believe that the pursuit of reforms is absolutely
essential. That's the message that should be sent to Russian
authorities,'' Chirac spokeswoman Catherine Colonna said.
	   European Union Finance Commissioner Yves-Thibault de Silguy
cautioned that Europe _ particularly the 11 nations set to adopt
the euro next year _ has more at stake in Russia's economy than the
United States.
	   ``Forty percent of Russia's foreign trade is with Europe, and
only five percent is with the United States,'' he said Monday in an
interview with French radio Europe-1. ``But it's Clinton who's
going to Russia on Tuesday. And we have the means to act.''
	   After dissolving the government, Yeltsin proposed restoring
Viktor Chernomyrdin as prime minister because he hoped the familiar
figure would restore confidence in the government, badly damaged by
the ruble's sharp decline.
	   But lawmakers overwhelmingly rejected Chernomyrdin in a vote
Monday despite warnings that Russia was on the verge of political
and economic collapse. Hard-line groups called for Yeltisn's
resignation.
	   Kohl said Monday he warned Yeltsin that Russia would receive no
infusion of financial aid from abroad unless he proceeded with
political reforms.
	   Former French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing, in an
interview Monday with radio station RTL, also urged caution in any
rescue package for Russia. ``One mustn't help Russia
unconditionally because that would be useless,'' he said.
	   Some European commentators saw no other option.
	   ``As absurd as it sounds, there is nothing further for the West
to do but to pump money into Russia,'' read an editorial in the
Vienna newspaper Der Standard. ``Not because this time there is a
more trustworthy debtor. But the alternatives will be further
hysterical reactions on the international finance markets.''

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW _ Strolling around the Moscow auto show with her pregnant
tummy swelling under blue denim overalls, a hopeful Yelena
Pleshakova searched for a new car to carry around her first child.
	   ``We're working, working, working. We're making more money than
before. If you work hard, you're free to succeed and there is
nothing to hold you back,'' said Pleshakova, a 25-year-old math
teacher married to an engineer.
	   Across the city at the gritty Zil auto factory, however, Viktor
Ivinsky can't even dream of the day when he may be able to afford a
car.
	   ``My salary was worth dlrs 300 two weeks ago. Now it's worth
dlrs 200,'' said Ivinsky as he waited for the bus. ``What will it
be worth two weeks from now? This crisis is like having a gun at my
head and a knife at my throat.''
	   Like Pleshakova and even Ivinsky, many Russians don't want to
trade their freedom for a return to Soviet-style controls, but they
do want lasting stability _ something Yeltsin has not provided.
	   Seven years after the Soviet collapse, Russia's economic reforms
are tottering as a result of lawlessness, corruption, greed, a lack
of political will and often ignorance of the way a free market
works.
	   In the past two weeks, Russia has been shaken by an economic
crisis in which the ruble was devalued, the government defaulted on
its debt, the stock market has virtually collapsed and President
Boris Yeltsin dismissed the government.
	   Yeltsin's main economic reforms _ privatization of state
property and ending price controls _ wiped out the Soviet-era
security of full employment and a steady ruble. Until 1991, the
cost of bread had hardly wavered since Stalin ruled.
	   At the beginning of Yeltsin's reforms, few Russians complained.
Although prices soared, lines and ration coupons vanished and
stores quickly were full of goods after the long years of Soviet
poverty.
	   Russians now have the liberty not only to choose their leaders
but to decide their future, to work or not to work, and the
responsibility for their lives is in their hands and not the
state's.
	   ``I don't want the old system. In Soviet times, I clocked in and
clocked out just like a robot,'' said Nikolai Kondratiev, 45, a
metal worker. ``Now I'm free to work how I want and I know if I
don't work I can't feed my family.''
	   A rudimentary trade and service economy has appeared. Small
privately owned shops and restaurants abound. A class of wealthy
``new Russians'' has emerged, but the creation of an extensive
middle class has remained elusive.
	   ``Five years ago I don't think I would have risked having a
family,'' said Pleshakova. ``Now I will, and I don't want to go
back to those times.''
	   Fickle, ailing and determined to stay in power, Yeltsin says he
still believes in economic reform and democracy. But he has never
fully implemented change, eroding his credibility and strengthening
the opposition.
	   ``I have no idea what this government is doing,'' said Ivinsky,
the Zil worker, who arrived in Moscow four months ago after fleeing
unemployment in the desolate tundra of western Siberia where he
worked at an oil rig.
	   ``There is support for the Communists because people live worse
and worse,'' Ivinsky said. ``But they wouldn't be for those
Communists if their lives weren't so bad.''
	   Now that times are troubled again, bad memories are coming back.
	   The mood is glum out at the All-Russia Exhibition Center, still
commonly known as the Exhibition of Economic Achievements, a vast
park where the aging pavilions in which the Soviet Union once
displayed its accomplishments are packed with traders selling
imported refrigerators, TVs, washing machines, clothes.
	   ``It's really terrible. We are all waiting for the new currency
rate. Russia lives off imports so what happens to the dollar is
important,'' said Lyudmila Korzyoneva, who runs a small lighting
and electrical supplies shop in the building which once displayed
Soviet advances in physics.
	   Except for a Russian-made immersion heater that costs 17 rubles
(dlrs 2.50), everything in Korzyoneva's store is imported. She's
stripped the price tags off until the ruble stabilizes. Customers
must bargain to buy anything.
	   With two children, one of whom is already in college, Korzyoneva
is not about to close her shop.
	   Russia's reliance on imports leaves traders _ and customers _
vulnerable to exchange rates since goods are purchased abroad in
dollars and then sold in rubles.
	   Because imports are expensive, many urban Russians rely on food
grown at their dachas for a large part of their diet. In rural
areas, the hunter-gatherer culture has returned. Fishing is for
food, not fun. Mushrooms are not a delicacy but a steady _ free _
source of nourishment.
	   The presence of imports shows Russia does have a sort of open,
market economy. But the absence of Russian products is equally
disturbing and a sign that domestic production has collapsed, and
with it jobs.
	   Much of the current crisis is a result of the instability of
Russian banks, many of which were involved in speculation rather
than loans to finance industrial and agricultural development.
	   Russians above all blame the government for the country's
economic woes. High policies, confusing legislation and failure to
root out ubiquitous corruption are the main reasons cited for the
current chaos.
	   Yelena Pleshakov, the pregnant math teacher, and her husband
came of age when Yeltsin took power. They don't blame the ailing
leader, and their remain hopeful of their own ability to make a
better future.
	   ``The reformers didn't make mistakes,'' said Yelena. ``Russia,
its people, are just so unpredictable.''

World commission warns of dangers to oceans, offers solutions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ An international commission set up to
examine ways of using and protecting ocean resources called Monday
for the creation of a worldwide watchdog body and the deployment of
naval forces to crack down on polluters.
	   The Independent World Commission on the Oceans, made up of over
40 marine experts, scientists and politicians from around the
world, published the results of its three years of research at the
Expo 98 world's fair in Lisbon whose theme is the oceans.
	   The commission's report, entitled ``The Ocean ... Our Future,''
identifies global trends and makes recommendations on how to
preserve the oceans.
	   It is to be presented in the fall to the U.N. General Assembly
whose members will decide what measures to adopt.
	   Commission chairman Mario Soares, a former president of
Portugal, said in his preface to the report that it should act as
``an alarm,'' prompting ocean policies that are ``rational, just
and responsible.''
	   Among ocean-related threats listed in the report are: global
climate change, overfishing, congested shipping lanes, maritime
boundary and resource disputes, and pollution _ especially through
dumping toxic and nuclear waste.
	   Some of the recommendations include:
	   -Expanding the role of navies, enabling them to enforce
environmental legislation;
	   -Ensuring that users of ocean resources and polluters bear the
costs of their action under the `user-pays' and `polluter-pays'
principles;
	   -Establishing a World Ocean Affairs Observatory to act as a
watchdog for ocean issues;
	   -Adopting special measures to protect indigenous peoples who
rely on subsistence fishing;
	   -Broadening the access of developing countries to scientific
information and technologies.
	   The commission was launched in Japan in December 1995 and its
final report was designed to mark 1998 as the U.N. International
Year of the Oceans. It is funded by countries and private bodies.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Lawmakers voted overwhelmingly Monday to reject
the appointment of Viktor Chernomyrdin as prime minister despite
warnings that Russia was on the verge of political and economic
collapse.
	   The Duma, the lower chamber of Parliament, voted 251-94 not to
confirm Chernomyrdin after more than three hours of bitter debate.
Hard-line delegates called for President Boris Yeltsin's
resignation.
	   Chernomyrdin pleaded with lawmakers before the vote to approve
the formation of a government to tackle the country's crisis that
has seen the stock market collapse and the devaluation of the
currency. The acting premier, who needed 226 votes for
confirmation, watched glumly as the Duma voted not to confirm him.
	   ``Russia is on the verge of political and economic collapse,''
he told the lower chamber of parliament at the start of his
confirmation hearings. He said not another hour could be wasted on
political bickering.
	   ``We can only come out of the crisis by uniting our efforts,''
he added.
	   Chernomyrdin's rejection will unleash new uncertainty at a time
when the government is battling to keep banks and other financial
institutions afloat. At the very least, Russia appears to face
protracted political in-fighting as the various parties battle to
exploit the crisis.
	   Parliamentary leaders agreed after the vote to hold talks
Tuesday on drawing up a list of possible candidates for prime
minister to submit to Yeltsin. Talks to solve the crisis would
continue, they said.

Finance minister proposes flat tax for Poland
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BEATA PASEK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Poland's complex income tax system should
be changed to a flat tax by the year 2000 to boost growth and
create jobs, Finance Minister Leszek Balcerowicz said Monday.
	   Balcerowicz, architect of Poland's successful economic shock
therapy in 1990 following decades of communist rule, presented a
draft tax policy that would do away with the current three-tier
system.
	   Under the plan, a flat tax of 22 percent with few deductions
would replace the three levels of taxation now _ at 19 percent, 30
percent and 40 percent, depending on income.
	   His proposal would have two tax rates in 1999 _ 22 and 32
percent _ and the flat 22 percent rate in 2000. Company income tax,
currently at 36 percent, would be reduced to 22 percent in 2002, he
told a news conference.
	   Under the current system, the 40 percent rate kicks in when
income reaches 50,504 zloty (dlrs 13,300) a year. But deductions
allow most in the highest income bracket to pay at a lower rate. In
1997, 95 percent of taxpayers registered in the lowest income
bracket.
	   The poorest segment also would benefit, as the threshold for
paying taxes would double to a projected 4,200 zloty (dlrs 1,100)
in the year 2000, depending on inflation and other factors.
	   Balcerowicz, who heads the liberal Freedom Union that is a
junior governing coalition partner with Solidarity, said reducing
taxes would motivate people to work harder and increase profits.
That would boost growth and create jobs, he said.
	   ``We want Poland to be a country where it is worth investing,''
Balcerowicz said.
	   A simpler tax system would eliminate loopholes that enable
people to avoid taxes, he said. Balcerowicz estimated that untaxed
income accounts for 15 to 25 percent of Poland's gross domestic
product.
	   He joked that the only segment hurt under his simplified plan
would be tax advisers.
	   The tax plan now will be debated by the government economic
committee and still requires the endorsement of the Cabinet,
parliament and President Aleksander Kwasniewski, a former communist
often at odds with government policy.
	   Both Solidarity and the ex-communist opposition have said they
fear a flat tax would hit low-income earners the hardest. A poll
conducted by the private polling company Demoskop found 56 percent
of the 968 Poles questioned Aug. 7-10 consider a progressive tax
more fair than a flat tax.
	   The poll had a margin of error of 3 percent.

SilkAir crash investigator can't rule out suicide, Singapore TV
</HEADLINE>
says

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The chief investigator into the December crash
of a SilkAir passenger plane cannot say conclusively that pilot
suicide was not the cause, Singapore government television reported
Monday.
	   A late-night television report quoted the Indonesian head of the
investigation, Oetarjo Diran, as saying a preliminary report on the
crash _ prepared with the help of Singaporean and American experts
_ would be released in September.
	   Government television said that the delay in releasing findings
had given rise to ``rumors'' about the cause of the crash,
``including pilot suicide.''
	   The government television report said that Diran ``could not say
conclusively that suicide was not the cause,'' but that human
factors as well as the structure of the plane were still being
looked into.
	   SilkAir is a subsidiary of Singapore Airlines, the
government-controlled national flag carrier, which had never
suffered a crash before the SilkAir Boeing 737-300 plunged from the
sky into a Sumatran river last Dec. 19, killing all 104 people
aboard.
	   Respected publications such as Aviation Week and The Asian Wall
Street Journal have carried several stories quoting people close to
the investigation indicating that suicide by the Singaporean pilot,
Capt. Tsu Way Ming, was a likely cause of the crash.
	   On the flight from Indonesia to Singapore, the cockpit voice
recorder and the flight data recorder stopped functioning some time
before the crash, an unusual circumstance that gave rise to the
first suspicions that the captain may have turned them off
deliberately.
	   The Wall Street Journal reported last month that the debt-ridden
captain had taken out a life insurance policy worth millions of
dollars only days before the crash.
	   The television report, broadcast late at night, gave no
indication of where or when Diran was speaking.
	   He has given only one press conference, last March, detailing
preliminary findings.
	   A U.S. Federal Aviation Administration official involved in the
investigation said that if the probe were being conducted in the
United States, much more information would have been made public by
now.
	   On Aug. 3, the team issued a statement saying there was ``no
indication that air traffic control, weather or maintenance was a
factor in the accident.'' At that time, the team said, another six
to eight months would be needed to finish the probe.

Poor countries helpless in face of global economic crisis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL HARRIS &QC;

<TEXT>
	   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) _ The timing was perfect.
	   Just days after Russia's financial problems triggered disaster
for emerging market economies, delegates from the developing world
gathered Monday at the 12th summit of the Nonaligned Movement.
	   Their response? Much collective hand-wringing, and a general
admission there was little to be done.
	   ``Global recession is now staring us in the face,'' one
Pakistani official told an economic committee which will prepare a
list of summit resolutions to be adopted by heads of state.
	   Across Asia, Europe and the Americas, many stock markets fell by
big percentages last week. The drop was a further blow to emerging
markets already suffering in the face of a year-old Asian
	   inancial crisis and recessions it has caused in powerhouse
economies such as Japan and Hong Kong.
	   In South Africa, which is hosting the summit and has a
sophisticated banking industry, the local stock market has lost 40
percent of its value since April to close at 4,986 points at the
end of last week.
	   South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki said the huge pullout
of emerging markets by frightened international investors had
exposed the powerlessness of poor countries.
	   ``The stark reality is that the power to influence markets lies
exclusively in the hands of those who dominate those markets, which
we, even collectively, do not,'' he told delegates.
	   Under discussion at the summit is a 62-page economics report
commissioned at the last Nonaligned Movement summit three years ago
in Colombia.
	   The report criticized the world's major financical institutions,
such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, saying
that they were ignoring the needs of the developing world and
dominated by rich nations.
	   It recommends speedy debt relief programs and a slower
integration of poorer economies into global markets in order to
avoid their exploitation by developed countries.
	   But even one of the report's authors, Sri Lanka's Corea Gamani,
told the committee that developing nations of the world struggled
to make themselves heard at global economic bodies.
	   ``We do not have a voice,'' he said.

	   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) _ Sudan's foreign minister said Monday
that if Washington acknowledged its error in bombing a factory in
Khartoum, Sudan was prepared ``to turn the page.''
	   Washington's attacks on targets in Sudan and Afghanistan - a
reprisal for the bombings of two U.S. embassies in Africa - was a
hot issue Monday at a summit of the Nonaligned Movement.
	   A movement committee on Sunday called for an independent
investigation of whether the factory hit by U.S. missiles was a
chemical weapons plant, as Washington claims, or a pharmaceutical
factory, as Sudan maintained.
	   ``We feel that what was passed yesterday was a step forward to
introduce justice,'' Sudanese foreign Minister Mustafa Osman Ismail
told The Associated Press.
	   ``We are open to turn the page against the U.S.A. if they
acknowledge they got wrong information'' about the nature of the
plant, he said at an earlier news conference.
	   There was no immediate reaction from the United States' first
official observer to a NAM summit, diplomat Princeton Lyman, who
stayed away from reporters.
	   In a news conference earlier, Ismail said Sudan would not
respond with an attack for the bombing of the Khartoum factory,
saying Sudan would reply through forums like the NAM and the United
Nations and if necessary, seek a hearing at the International Court
of Justice in the Hague, Netherlands.
	   The movement's 12th summit is pulling together an expected 52
heads of state and representatives of about 100 nations in all.
Heads of state meet Wednesday and Thursday. Formed during the
height of the Cold War to fend off domination by the White House
and the Kremlin, the movement is now struggling to define a new
role.
	   South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, welcoming foreign
ministers to the summit, said the Nonaligned Movement should
advance the cause of the poor.
	   ``The world economy should be managed in a way that ensures the
transfer of resources from those who have them to those that do
not,'' he said, noting that rich countries have no moral imperative
to share their wealth.
	   ``The new God of our world, the market, is not informed by a
tablet of commandments on which is inscribed: `Thou shalt banish
poverty in the world.' ''
	   Other summit topics include the war in Congo, in which rebels
allegedly supported by Rwanda and Uganda, are fighting President
Laurent Kabila's forces, which are being backed by soldiers from
Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia.
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan planned to meet at the summit
with regional leaders on the Congo crisis. He was expected to
arrive Tuesday, officials said. Kabila was not likely to attend.
	   Ugandan Foreign Minister Eriya Kategaya told a news conference
that his country supported a cease-fire in the troubled Central
African country and supported peace moves by South African
President Nelson Mandela.
	   He said no Uganda troops had taken part in fighting around the
Congo capital of Kinshasa and insisted there were none there.
	   ``It is an internal matter. It can only be solved by the
Congolese people,'' Kategaya said.
	   Delegates from India and Pakistan said they hoped to hold
bilateral talks on the recent nuclear arms testing by both
countries.
	   Pakistani Foreign Minister Sartag Aziz essentially ruled out any
nuclear disarmament unless the dispute over Kashmir, a region
claimed by both India and Pakistan, is settled.
	   ``We don't want to engage in a nuclear arms race,'' Aziz said in
an interview. ``But for a nuclear stand down, we must deal with the
underlying issues.''
	   Indian foreign Minister Sasundhara Raje said she wanted further
talks on a moratorium on building nuclear weapons, and a ban on
first-strike use of the weapons.
	   ``I think that at the end of the day, we will be able to work
out a solution'' she told AP.

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ The presidents of China and Turkmenistan pledged
Monday to work for stronger ties, and officials from both sides
signed an array of cooperation agreements, Chinese state media
said.
	   Chinese President Jiang Zemin welcomed Saparmurad Niyazov at a
ceremony Monday, kicking off the Turkmen president's six-day visit.
	   After talks, the two presidents signed a statement declaring
their intention to enhance ties, and officials from both sides
inked documents covering cooperation in economic and other fields,
the state-run Xinhua News Agency said.
	   It gave no details about the pacts. But the two sides had been
expected to sign agreements on air travel, science, and tourism.
They also were expected to create a joint government commission for
trade and economic issues during the visit, the Interfax news
agency said.
	   Niyazov also was expected to discuss a project to build a gas
pipeline from Turkmenistan to China.
	   Niyazov also met Monday with Li Peng, head of China's
legislature, and Vice Premier Li Lanqing. The vice premier noted
the two sides' cooperation in exports of petroleum machinery and
restoring oil wells, Xinhua said. Li said China was considering
setting up joint ventures in Turkmenistan, it said.

close the gap between the buying and selling rates of the U.S.
dollar following complaints from businesses and travelers.
	   On Sunday, the U.S. dollar was being bought at Guyana dlrs 143
and selling for up to Guyana dlrs 154, increasing prices of airline

France holding huge trial of suspected Islamic extremists
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Nearly 140 suspected Islamic extremists go on trial
Tuesday in a prison gym, accused of serving as a support network
for insurgents in Algeria, allegedly recruiting fighters and
sending arms and aid.
	   Defense lawyers contend the proceedings are a ``political
trial'' for France to show support for Algeria's military-backed
regime. At least some lawyers were expected to walk out after the
first day.
	   The lawyers, who call the trial a ``judicial aberration,''
contest its size, its length _ expected to be two months _ and the
site, a gymnasium of the National School of Penitentiary
Administration at the Fleury-Merogis Prison outside Paris.
	   The gym, overhauled for the trial, was chosen instead of the
Palais de Justice in central Paris, where courtrooms are too small
to accommodate the proceedings.
	   The 138 defendants, arrested between 1994-95, are accused of
belonging to three separate but overlapping networks that allegedly
recruited fighters in Europe for the Islamic insurgency in Algeria,
now in its seventh year.
	   They are accused of sending arms and medicine, providing safe
havens in France for fighters, and funds for the cause.
	   Charged with ``criminal association with a terrorist
enterprise,'' they risk up to 10 years in prison.
	   Defense lawyers claim most of the defendants have but a passing
connection to the three leaders of the networks, who they say
should be tried separately.
	   The leading defendants are Mohamed Kerrouch, described as the
ideologue and top leader, arrested in Britain in April 1996 and
extradited to France; Mohamed Chalabi, and Mourad Tacine.
	   Kerrouch is accused of organizing support networks and
provisions for the Islamic Salvation Army, the military wing of the
now-banned Algerian political party the Islamic Salvation Front.
He's accused of then continuing the same work for the Armed Islamic
Group, the radical insurgency movement accused of numerous
massacres.
	   Chalabi is accused of setting up a group to collect arms,
medicine and clothing for insurgents. Tacine is accused of heading
a third group that allegedly provided false documents and lodging
for insurgents who took refuge in France.
	   The defendants were arrested in several sweeps in France. In one
raid, in November 1994, police found an arsenal of weapons and
munitions at the Association of Muslims of France, outside Paris,
used by Islamic extremists for their rendez-vous.
	   An estimated 75,000 people have been killed since the start of
the Algerian insurgency, which was triggered when the army canceled
1992 legislative elections the Salvation Front was poised to win.

Britain may call ministerial meeting of industrial powers over

Russia crisis &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-Russia-Economy &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain may call a ministerial meeting of the
major industrialized powers to discuss the crisis in Russia, Prime
Minister Tony Blair's office said Monday.
	   Blair, who holds the rotating chairmanship of the Group of Eight
major industrialized nations, spoke to leaders of the United
States, France, Germany, Italy, Canada and Japan over the weekend
to share assessments of Russia's economic and political turmoil.
	   ``We're waiting to see what happens in Russia and what form of
government is formed there, and once that's clear, we'll decide
with the other partners ... whether there's a case of some form of
ministerial meeting,'' Blair's spokesman said, speaking on
condition of anonymity. ``We're going to monitor the situation
closely.''
	   Other British sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
there's a good prospect of some kind of meeting at ministerial
level _ not of heads of government.
	   Russia, whose economic crisis has been building all summer, is
the newest member of the Group of Eight. The growing global turmoil
in developing markets hit Russia, leading to the collapse of its
financial markets and forcing the government to devalue the ruble
two weeks ago. This triggered a larger crisis of confidence in
President Boris Yeltsin's government.
	   ``There is a clear feeling ... that it is in all our interests
to make sure Russia gets through this crisis and that it will best
do so by sticking to the reform path,'' a Blair spokesman said
Sunday after the prime minister spoke to U.S. President Bill
Clinton for a second time.
	   Clinton is scheduled to arrive in Moscow on Tuesday for a summit
with Yeltsin.

Swisscom estimated value higher than expected
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Swisscom, the state-owned Swiss
telecommunication giant planning to go public in the fall, is
valued at around 31-36 billion Swiss francs (dlrs 20.7-24 billion),
according to estimates in a report released Monday by U.S.
investment bank J.P. Morgan.
	   Earlier estimates from analysts had put Swisscom's total equity
value at around 20 billion Swiss francs (dlrs 13.4 billion).
	   J.P. Morgan said its estimate is based on an analysis of the
European telecom peer group's cash flow and earnings multiples,
with tax-adjusted multiples suggesting higher valuations.
	   J.P. Morgan and Co., together with Warburg Dillon Read and
Credit Suisse First Boston, act as joint lead manager for
Swisscom's initial public offering in North America, while J.P.
Morgan (Switzerland) is one of the co-leads for the initial public
offering in Switzerland.
	   The government plans to sell up to 49.9 percent of Swisscom
shares at the IPO.
	   Swisscom, formerly the telecommunications arm of the Swiss
government's postal service, confirmed in June its intention to
float on the stock market. It would represent Switzerland's biggest
privatization to date.

Volume low as central Europe watches Russia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with closing prices, analyst comments &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Some central European share prices and
currencies made partial recoveries Monday of losses caused by
Russia's crisis, but fears remain that continued problems in Moscow
will bring new volatility.
	   A bank holiday in England and uncertainty over Russia kept
volume low in most regional markets.
	   Poland saw its currency strengthen while shares fell to their
lowest level in two years, but Finance Minister Leszek Balcerowicz
repeated past assertions that the economy can ride out the Russian
situation because of its large reserves and manageable debt burden.
	   In Hungary, stocks rose in early trading and held on for an
overall gain, with investors taking advantage of low prices.
	   But the low volume meant the results were marginal, and analysts
expected a more accurate reflection of investor confidence on
Tuesday. Several said the situation in Russia would continue to
dominate activity.
	   ``Foreign investors are withdrawing from their investments,''
said Piotr Marczewski of AmerBrokers in Poland. ``Russia still has
a very bad impact on our market. The state of uncertainty will last
for another few days, or even weeks.''
	   Hungary's forint currency, which required two rounds of
government intervention last week, was boosted by a weekend
announcement that the government would reduce the monthly
devaluation rate.
	   Dealers said the government's decision calmed fears that it
might announce a one-time devaluation, similar to the way Russia
devalued the ruble two weeks ago.
	   But they warned the rough ride would likely continue.
	   ``Until the situation settles down in Russia and the Far Eastern
markets, the forint is on track to weaken,'' said Istvan Hideg,
currency dealer at Mezobank Rt. in Budapest.
	   Share prices on the Hungarian stock exchange rose 1.6 percent on
the day after gaining almost 7 percent soon after opening.
	   All regional currencies and shares took a beating last week due
to the Russian crisis, mostly because investors abandoned their
stakes. Analysts described the reaction as panic over emerging
markets, rather than an indication of problems underpinning
regional economies.
	   In Prague, the Czech koruna strengthened against the dollar
Monday, but volume was so low that the change was considered
insignificant.

Greenpeace criticizes labeling on genetically engineered food
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HAMBURG, Germany (AP) _ Environmental activists hit a sweet spot
Monday in their crusade against genetically engineered food, urging
customers to watch out for Butterfinger candy bars.
	   Nestle next month plans to stock German shelves with
Butterfingers made from genetically engineered corn. Under a new
German law starting Tuesday, food products made with genetically
engineered ingredients must be labeled accordingly.
	   The Swiss food giant said it will label all Butterfinger bars _
even though some might contain genuine corn products. Still,
Greenpeace activists protested outside a Hamburg supermarket
Monday, warning consumers to read Nestle labels carefully. Similar
protests were planned in a number of other German cities.
	   Greenpeace last week said it discovered unlabeled Butterfingers
in Munich gas stations. Nestle said the candy bars were imported by
mistake and that those responsible had been reprimanded.
	   The Swiss company has supplied German hospitals with food
products made with genetically engineered ingredients since last
April. Butterfingers would be one of the first such products
available in German stores.

Man charged in IRA dissidents' bomb attempt
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ An Irish man was charged Monday in
connection with a thwarted bombing attempt blamed on dissident IRA
members.
	   John McNamara, 36 of Kilcock, was charged with conspiring to
cause an explosion between March 19 and April 2. He was jailed
pending a further appearance on Oct. 8.
	   His arrest came after Irish police intercepted a 1,000-pound
(450-kg) bomb that was hidden in a car and was waiting to board a
ferry for Britain. Another man has been charged with possession of
the explosives.
	   Security sources have said the plot apparently was the work of
the so-called ``real IRA,'' a group of dissidents who have refused
to accept the Irish Republican Army's cease-fire.
	   In a statement released Sunday, the IRA called on the dissidents
to disband ``sooner rather than later.''
	   The British and Irish parliaments will convene in special
sessions Wednesday and Thursday to vote on legislation intended to
crack down on dissidents who have refused to give up violence in
pursuit of their political aims in British-ruled Northern Ireland.

Trinidad Cement shareholders seek recovery of payments
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ Trinidad Cement Limited, one of
this Caribbean nation's largest companies, is under shareholder
scrutiny following accusations of unauthorized payments to
non-executive company directors.
	   Two shareholders warned they might take legal action this week
to recover a dlrs 72,000 payment which they claim the directors
approved for themselves.
	   TCL chairman Andy Bhajan said company attorneys were studying
the shareholders' allegations, contained in an Aug. 25 letter from
the prominent law firm Daltons.
	   The letter was written a day after TCL chief executive Sharma
Lalla was suspended pending an investigation into expenditures on a
business trip to Europe in May.
	   The shareholders said TCL directors voted themselves increases
in payments against company policy. They also claimed that the
company granted Mexican cement giant Cemex, which has a 20 percent
stake in TCL, director positions with a TCL subsidiary in alleged
violation of TCL bylaws.

Red Cross: Cross-border shelling displaces 55,000 in east Sudan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Shelling across Eritrea's border with Sudan
apparently caused more than 55,000 people to flee their homes in
eastern Sudan, the Red Cross said Monday.
	   Hundreds of families fled from border villages since January,
the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent
Societies said in a statement. Fighting in the past month has
forced many to move on for a second time, it added.
	   According to Red Cross officials who have visited the Shamboub
camp and others, 36,000 people with few supplies are housed in
makeshift facilities set up since outbreaks of fighting started in
January.
	   Paul Stromberg, a spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees, said the agency had so far been unable to reach the site
and could not comment on the number or condition of people there.
	   Sudanese Red Crescent workers report respiratory problems,
diarrhea and undernourished children suffering from fever and other
infections, the Red Cross said.
	   Villagers in eastern Sudan's arid border area are also at risk
from land mines, it added.
	   Sudan in June accused Eritrea of bombarding seven of its border
posts, but Sudanese rebels said their forces carried out the
attack.
	   Earlier this year, a border dispute between neighboring Eritrea
and Ethiopia boiled over into armed clashes. Hundreds of people
have been killed in that conflict.
	   Sudan has severed relations with both Eritrea and Ethiopia, and
accuses the two countries of harboring insurgents. Eritrea has
denied involvement in the shelling.
	   Sudanese rebels have been fighting the government for the past
two years in eastern Sudan and since 1983 in southern Sudan, where
the mainly Christian and animist population seeks autonomy from the
Muslim north.
	   Eritrea hosts a variety of both armed and unarmed Sudanese
opposition groups, and the government of President Isaias Afwerki
makes no secret of its hostility to the National Islamic Front
government in Sudan.

Bomb kills 20 near Algiers market
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES official toll to 17, hospital sources say 20; edits. &QL; 
 &UR; By RACHID KHIARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ A powerful bomb exploded near a popular
marketplace in Algiers on Monday, killing at least 17 people and
about 60 injured, authorities said.
	   Hospital sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, put the
death toll at 20.
	   The explosion ripped through a packed square in the neighborhood
of Bab-el-Oued, considered a stronghold of Muslim fundamentalists.
It sent people running through the streets in panic.
	   Ambulances rushed to the scene, and police cordoned off the
surrounding area. Two hours after the explosion, ambulance workers
were still ferrying people to hospitals.
	   There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but suspicion
fell on militants waging the Islamic insurgency against the
military-backed government, now in its seventh year.
	   Earlier Monday, the government said it would open 48 offices
nationwide to help investigate the disappearance of Algerians
during the insurgency.
	   The offices, to be opened on Tuesday, will welcome relatives of
missing people to leave dossiers of their loved ones.
	   Human rights groups, citing witness accounts, have suggested
Algeria's army had a role in some of the thousands of reported
disappearances in the past six years. An estimated 75,000 people,
including Islamic militants, civilians and security forces, have
been killed since 1992.
	   Authorities said the opening of the offices coincided with 554
new cases of missing people lodged with the Interior Ministry.
	   In June, Interior Minister Mustapha Benmansour dismissed as a
``fabrication'' a report sent to Algeria's parliament by Louiza
Hanoune, president of the leftist Workers Party, citing several
hundred people who were missing.
	   Although many of the disappeared are feared dead, Algeria's
government-run National Observatory for Human Rights says some may
have secretly fled the country or joined the insurgents.
	   Algeria's insurgency began after the army canceled legislative
elections the now-banned Islamic Salvation Front was poised to win.

Museum housing priceless collection closes for renovation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ The Van Gogh museum, one of the
Dutch capital's top tourist magnets, closed its doors to the public
Monday for nine months as construction workers moved in to renovate
the 25-year-old building.
	   Built to accommodate some 60,000 visitors per year, the museum
attracted more than 1 million last year as interest in the Dutch
artist Vincent van Gogh continued to boom.
	   As well as modernizing the original museum, curators are adding
a 37.5 million guilder (dlrs 18.75 million) new exhibition wing.
	   Most of the museum's priceless collection of Van Goghs will
remain nearby _ 140 paintings will be displayed at Amsterdam's
Rijksmuseum. But 70 are being shipped to the United States to go on
show first at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., from
Oct. 4 and later at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.
	   The Amsterdam museum will reopen at the end of May 1999 with an
exhibition about Theo van Gogh, the Dutch artist's brother who was
a renowned art dealer, collector and patron.

Louise Woodward says court TV turned baby killing trial into soap
</HEADLINE>
opera
 &UR; Eds: AMs. UPDATES with new quotes, background throughout &QL; 
 &UR; By MAUREEN JOHNSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   EDINBURGH, Scotland (AP) _ Louise Woodward, the British au pair
convicted of killing an American baby, said Monday that television
turned her trial into a soap opera with a painful legacy: a nervous
giggle is her best-remembered testimony, and now autograph hunters
haunt her.
	   With her American lawyer Barry Scheck, who defended O.J.
Simpson, the 20-year-old took part in a debate on whether to allow
TV into British courts.
	   Scheck said it should happen only if all participants agree, a
stipulation he maintained would effectively bar TV from most U.S.
trials. Ms. Woodward said TV should never be allowed.
	   ``It is hard enough being handcuffed in the dock without having
a camera trying to take a shot of your handcuffs,'' she said.
	   Ms. Woodward, the first British woman to be tried on live TV,
returned home June 18 after a Massachusetts court upheld her
conviction of involuntary manslaughter in the death of 8-month-old
Matthew Eappen. He died of head injuries in February 1997 while in
her care.
	   Since returning to Britain she has given only one TV interview,
promised not to sell her story, and _ until Monday's appearance at
the Edinburgh International Film Festival _ disappeared from public
view.
	   Had she been found innocent, Ms. Woodward would have received
huge offers for her story. However, British media guidelines
generally bar paying convicted criminals for their stories.
	   Initially convicted of murder, Ms. Woodward maintained total
innocence and in court Scheck tried to prove Matthew died from an
old injury.
	   He argued Monday that media hype surrounding the trial
distracted the jury from the scientific evidence, with the issue
becoming whether Ms. Woodward was ``the nanny from hell'' or
whether Matthew's parents, both doctors, were to blame for hiring
an inexperienced teen-ager.
	   People said things like ``no wonder she snapped,'' commented
Scheck, adding wryly, ``And these were the people who were supposed
to be on our side.''
	   Ms. Woodward, dressed in a black suit and platform sandals, was
composed during the 90-minute session in a paneled hall at the
Court of Assembly of the (Presbyterian) Church of Scotland. The
session was attended by several hundred TV producers, but no
cameras were allowed.
	   Organizers also barred questions about her guilt or innocence.
	   Afterward, Ms. Woodward appeared slightly nervous at a news
conference in the courtyard of the 19th century building dominated
by a forbidding statue of the 16th century Scottish Calvinist, John
Knox.
	   ``It must have been a tremendous stress for everyone ... I am
sure it must have been the same for the Eappen family as well,''
she said of the televising of her trial.
	   She described coming home _ she comes from a small north England
village, Elton _ to a life as a sort of reluctant ``minor
celebrity.''
	   Even when memories of the trial recede, she is resigned to
generating new media interest at the next big stages of her life:
going to university, getting married, having children, she said.
	   She has refused to say whether she will enroll in college this
fall.
	   ``People ask me to sign baseball caps and things like that ... I
am trying to be a normal person but people won't let me do that,''
she said.
	   Who's to blame _ the millions on both sides of the Atlantic who
watched her Massachusetts trial? Ms. Woodward laughed and
acknowledged, ``I think I would have watched it too.''

	   CRATHIE, Scotland (AP) _ In the quiet corner of Scotland where
Prince William and Prince Harry prayed for their mother Monday on
the anniversary of her death, local residents honored a long
tradition and left them in peace.
	   In Crathie and the surrounding area, Queen Elizabeth II and her
kin are neighbors, not media stars.
	   When the boys and the rest of the royal family drove the short
distance from Balmoral Castle to private prayers at rural Crathie
church, only a couple of dozen onlookers stood waiting in the
morning mist.
	   On their return from the 20-minute service in memory of Princess
Diana, 16-year-old William turned away from the media gathered
along the route, and Harry, 13, hung his head.
	   As they were driven back across the River Dee and along a drive
shaded by towering pines, waiting wellwishers saw the boys' sober
faces and knew it was no occasion for the queen or Prince Charles
to mingle with the people.
	   ``It would have been nice if they'd stopped,'' said Deborah
Judd, a vactioner from southern England. ``But they have to grieve,
they want to be left in peace and you can understand that,
really.''
	   No one knows that better than the local people, who have nearly
150 years of experience as neighbors to the royal family. They know
when to tend to their own business, and Monday was a day to leave
the queen and her family alone.
	   Crathie, 45 miles (70 kms) west of Aberdeen, is barely a wide
spot in the road in the wooded valley of the swiftly running Dee,
where salmon fishing is the main tourist attraction _ next to the
royals.
	   The nearest town is Ballater, eight miles (13 km) east, where
the royal family has been doing its vacation shopping since Queen
Victoria and Prince Albert discovered its charms in the 1840s.
	   As proof of royal satisfaction with their merchandise,
Ballater's small and unpretentious shops wear royal warrants above
their doors proclaiming them greengrocer, butcher or baker ``by
appointment to Her Majesty.''
	   These reticent Scots are skilled at fending off curious
outsiders. Very few will speak about the royal family.
	   ``They come here on holiday looking for a bit of peace and quiet
and that's what they get,'' said one businessman whose shop has
been serving the royal family for about 100 years.
	   ``We tend to be a little bit protective,'' he said, unwilling to
give his name. ``The locals know them all and they know all the
locals, usually by name, and it's as normal as it can be and that's
the way the locals try and keep it.''
	   The forebears of present residents became favorites of Queen
Victoria after she and Albert bought Balmoral in 1848 and then
built the present house, in castle form, in 1855.
	   They spent months each year rambling around the forests and
heaths, enjoying the clean air and views of the Grampian mountains.
	   After Albert's death in 1861, the griefstricken queen spent more
and more time in solitude here. Eight years later, she wrote that
it was painful to leave Balmoral.
	   ``It is not all the pure air, the quiet and beautiful scenery,
which renders it so delightful,'' she wrote, ``it is the atmosphere
of loving affection and hearty attachment of the people around
Balmoral which warms the heart and does one good.''

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The Dow industrials fell below 8,000 Monday
morning for the first time in seven months, a drop that wiped out
all of this year's gains.
	   The Dow Jones industrial average, which rose 43 points in the
opening minutes of trading, was down 165.03 at 7,886.65 at late
morning on trading volume that was active but below last week's
frenzied pace.
	   With Monday morning's losses, the Dow gave up the last of this
year's gains. It ended 1997 at 7,908.25. The last time the Dow
closed below 8,000 was on Jan. 30.

Austrian minister warns against Kosovo conflict spreading to
</HEADLINE>
Macedonia,

<TEXT>
	   SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) _ Austrian Defense Minister Werner
Fasslabend has warned that the Kosovo conflict might spill over
into Macedonia, where a third of the two million people are ethnic
Albanians.
	   In a telephone interview with the Austrian Press Agency in
Vienna, Fasslabend said that in Kosovo ``the war has already
begun.''
	   At issue is not how to prevent a war, but to end the war in its
initial stages so that it doesn't spread across the entire Balkans,
said the minister after talks with Macedonian President Kiro
Gligorov.
	   Fasslabend quoted Gligorov as expressing ``great concern'' that
Macedonia might be dragged into the Kosovo crisis. However, he and
other Macedonian officials are reportedly convinced that a
political solution can be found.
	   ``At any rate, Macedonia anticipates that a solution can only be
found with the help of the Americans,'' APA quoted Fasslabend as
saying.
	   This solution must be found in the course of the next half year
because with the onset of winter the government in Skopje expects
``extreme humanitarian problems.''
	   More than 260,000 ethnic Albanians have been rendered homeless
by the fighting in Kosovo that escalated in March when government
forces launched their first major offensive against the Kosovo
Liberation Army, a rebel force fighting for the independence of the
southern Serbian province.

In swift and brutal justice, two Palestinians executed

 &UR; Eds: RECASTS for AMS, UPDATES with statement by Palestinian human
rights group &QL; 
 &UR; By KARIN LAUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Three days after the crime _ the slayings of
two Palestinian policemen _ the two suspects had been tried,
sentenced and put to death by a firing squad.
	   The execution _ the first ordered by Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat _ drew outrage from Palestinian human rights activists who
said Monday they feared it could pave the way for other abuses.
	   However, most Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip
appeared to support Arafat's actions.
	   The convicted killers were themselves Palestinian security
officers engaged in a longstanding feud with a rival clan.
	   The crime was seen as a prime example of a growing problem _
members of Arafat's 40,000 strong security force abusing their
power to settle personal scores.
	   Sunday's execution in the courtyard of the Gaza City central
jail was witnessed by more than 500 people, including Palestinian
Cabinet ministers, legislators and members of Arafat's Fatah
faction.
	   The condemned men, brothers Mohammed and Raed Abu Sultan, 25 and
24 respectively, were led into the yard blindfolded at about 2:30
p.m. and ordered to stand up against the back wall.
	   The two men, shaking and unable to stand up without support,
pleaded for mercy and were forced to listen to a slow count from 1
to 10 before 10 policemen in black hoods opened fire on them, said
witness Sami Awadah, a Fatah member.
	   When the volley of shots ran out, many in the crowd shouted
``Allahu Akbar,'' or ``God is Great,'' as a sign of approval.
	   The Palestinian human rights groups Al Haq and Mandela Institute
said Arafat was responding to public pressure when he ordered the
executions. The victims, brothers Majdi Khaldi, 32, and Mohammed
Khaldi, 30, were Fatah activists from a prominent family and there
was fear the blood feud would continue.
	   ``We believe Arafat's approval came in response to the mood of
he people of Gaza,'' the two groups said in a statement. ``There
was not enought time for those who committed the crime to defend
themselves.''
	   The Khaldi brothers were killed last Thursday. By Saturday
evening, the Abu Sultan brothers had been arrested, tried and
sentenced to death by a military tribunal. The judges deliberated
for only half an hour.
	   With the execution, Arafat also signaled that he remains in
control and will not be challenged. His message comes at a time
when he is less robust than in the past, both physically and
politically.
	   Arafat's actions raised some questions about whether he would
use such extreme punishment to deal with political opponents.
	   The Islamic militant group Hamas has been challenging Arafat's
rule and has tried to wreck the peace accords with Israel by
carrying out suicide bombings. An execution of a convicted suicide
bomber, for instance, could silence Israel's complaints that Arafat
is not doing enough to stop attacks on Israel.
	   However, Palestinian human rights activist Bassem Eid said that
while Sunday's execution could pave the way for more human rights
abuses by the Palestinian Authority, he did not expect a rash of
executions.
	   Eid said there was no precedent for Arafat using extreme force
to silence opponents. Twenty-three prisoners have been sentenced to
death since the Palestinian Authority was formed in 1994, but
Arafat commuted all of those terms to life in prison.
	   Arafat's most powerful political rival, Hamas founder Sheik
Ahmed Yassin, even welcomed the execution, saying it was in line
with Islamic law stipulating that killers be put to death.
	   Israeli government spokesman Moshe Fogel said the executions
showed that Arafat can act ``swiftly and even brutally'' against
those who hurt his interests, while at the same time dragging his
feet in fighting terrorism aimed at Israel.

France holding huge trial of suspected Islamic extremists
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to restore cycle designator &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Nearly 140 suspected Islamic extremists go on trial
Tuesday in a prison gym, accused of serving as a support network
for insurgents in Algeria, allegedly recruiting fighters and
sending arms and aid.
	   Defense lawyers contend the proceedings are a ``political
trial'' for France to show support for Algeria's military-backed
regime. At least some lawyers were expected to walk out after the
first day.
	   The lawyers, who call the trial a ``judicial aberration,''
contest its size, its length _ expected to be two months _ and the
site, a gymnasium of the National School of Penitentiary
Administration at the Fleury-Merogis Prison outside Paris.
	   The gym, overhauled for the trial, was chosen instead of the
Palais de Justice in central Paris, where courtrooms are too small
to accommodate the proceedings.
	   The 138 defendants, arrested between 1994-95, are accused of
belonging to three separate but overlapping networks that allegedly
recruited fighters in Europe for the Islamic insurgency in Algeria,
now in its seventh year.
	   They are accused of sending arms and medicine, providing safe
havens in France for fighters, and funds for the cause.
	   Charged with ``criminal association with a terrorist
enterprise,'' they risk up to 10 years in prison.
	   Defense lawyers claim most of the defendants have but a passing
connection to the three leaders of the networks, who they say
should be tried separately.
	   The leading defendants are Mohamed Kerrouch, described as the
ideologue and top leader, arrested in Britain in April 1996 and
extradited to France; Mohamed Chalabi, and Mourad Tacine.
	   Kerrouch is accused of organizing support networks and
provisions for the Islamic Salvation Army, the military wing of the
now-banned Algerian political party the Islamic Salvation Front.
He's accused of then continuing the same work for the Armed Islamic
Group, the radical insurgency movement accused of numerous
massacres.
	   Chalabi is accused of setting up a group to collect arms,
medicine and clothing for insurgents. Tacine is accused of heading
a third group that allegedly provided false documents and lodging
for insurgents who took refuge in France.
	   The defendants were arrested in several sweeps in France. In one
raid, in November 1994, police found an arsenal of weapons and
munitions at the Association of Muslims of France, outside Paris,
used by Islamic extremists for their rendez-vous.
	   An estimated 75,000 people have been killed since the start of
the Algerian insurgency, which was triggered when the army canceled
1992 legislative elections the Salvation Front was poised to win.

Norwegian PM takes sick leave for depression
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Leads throughout to ADD reaction, background &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Prime Minister Kjell Magne Bondevik is
suffering from depression due to overwork and taking a week's sick
leave, his office announced Monday.
	   Bondevik, who leads a fragile minority center government, has
been under considerable pressure recently as the country wrestles
with economic troubles.
	   The Norwegian currency, the krone, has declined about 6 percent
due to declining oil prices, the crisis in Asia and Russia and
uncertainty about the government's policy.
	   Bondevik's week off comes as the three-party government was to
begin debating next year's budget. Minister of Culture Anne Enger
Lahnstein will take over as prime minister as long as Bondevik is
ill.
	   The sick leave also forced him to cancel plans to travel to the
Middle East September 7-12.
	   Initial reaction from politicians across the political spectrum
was sympathetic.
	   Carl I. Hagen of the far-right Progress Party praised Bondevik
for his openness.
	   ``It is positive that the Prime Minister has followed up signals
(from health experts) to be more open about mental disease,'' Hagen
said.
	   Labor party leader Thorbjoern Jagland, whom Bondevik replaced as
prime minister last year, said he hopes Bondevik makes a quick
recovery and did not expect that the leave would affect work with
the budget.
	   ``It shouldn't matter. It must be allowed to be sick in this
country,'' Jagland said.
	   It is unclear what pressures might have triggered Bondevik's
depression. Bondevik, an ordained Lutheran minister, is considered
an honest and likeable politician with a high moral standard and
has suffered much less personal bullying from the media than many
other politicians.
	   But he and his government have been blamed for contributing to
the economic problems Norway is having by seeming indecisive and
internally divided, and many observers recently have predicted the
government is on the verge of falling.
	   Many regard the government as appearing too willing to increase
spending for favorite causes, especially a costly reform to give
cash support to mothers who stay home with young children, without
being able to make the corresponding cuts. Bondevik has for the
last week been criticized for breaking his promises by mothers who
have quit their jobs, counting on the money.
	   At the same time it presided over record wage increases last
spring. Experts have long warned that Norway's economy was
overheating and needed tightening.
	   The krone's loss of value and dramatic interest rate hikes
during the last couple of weeks have driven home the urgency of
budget-tightening, which has forced Bondevik to weigh postponing
the second phase of the cash support scheme, which was his
Christian People's Party's top electoral promise.
	   To supplement his woes Bondevik has had to watch the Central
Bank's interest hikes threaten serious belt-tightening for the same
mortgage-burdened young families that now fear not getting the cash
support.

Turkish Cypriot leader offers confederation to Greek Cypriots

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ The leader of the breakaway Turkish
Cypriot state on Monday proposed setting up a confederation of
equal states as a way to end the 24-year-old division of this
Mediterranean island. Greece and the Greek Cypriots flatly rejected
the idea.
	   ``We propose the establishment of a Cyprus confederation
composed of two peoples and two states,'' Rauf Denktash told a news
conference held with Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem. ``The
framework of our proposal is open to negotiation.''
	   Cem said the offer, a modified version of the Turkish proposal
for a two-zone, bi-communal federation, had Turkey's
``full-backing.''
	   ``We hope that the Greek Cypriots will seriously consider the
proposal and see it as a last chance for reconciliation,'' Cem
said.
	   ``It is time that they recognize that we are the legal
government of the Turkish Cypriots,'' Denktash told private NTV
television.
	   ``We believe that only this structure will provide for the
security of both sides and will safeguard their identity and
well-being,'' Denktash said. ``If the Greek Cypriots agree to this
final basis, we are ready to begin negotiations to establish the
Cyprus Confederation.''
	   Under the offer, the Turkish Cypriots still insist on
international recognition but abandon opposition to EU membership
for the Greek side.
	   The Greek Cypriot leadership and Greece promptly rejected the
confederation offer.
	   ``The Denktash proposal can under no circumstances form a basis
for negotiation,'' said Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides in a
statement said, calling the proposal was ``unacceptable from the
beginning'' because it ignores U.N. resolutions on Cyprus.
	   A spokesman for the Greek government, Dimitris Reppas, said the
Turkish Cypriots ``are essentially asking for the formalization of
the partition and occupation of Cyprus.''

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Surfer dude in the water, Jewish settler
on the land - Rabbi Nachum Shifren, a former California lifeguard
said he found an unusual path to God by riding the waves during
breaks from Torah study.
	   Shifren, an Orthodox Jew who calls himself the ``Surfing
rabbi,'' spends his days alternating between the study of Jewish
law and mysticism and discovering it himself in the surf, he told
Associated Press Television.
	   Round and tall, with a long peppered beard and light blue eyes,
Shifren turns in his knitted skullcap, dress shirt and prayer shawl
when he hits the Tel Aviv beach for a t-shirt, spandex swimsuit and
surf board.
	   ``We have to learn, we have to read, we have to pray, and I
believe we have to surf,'' Shifren said.
	   Shifren, 47, moved from Los Angeles, California, 20 years ago to
one of the most extreme right-wing Jewish settlements on the West
Bank and now offers surfing lessons to people seeking God with the
help of nature.
	   The rest of the time, he works on self-promotion and spreading a
message of ``surfer harmony,'' through pamphlets, a web site, and
his autobiography, ``Surf &AMP; Soul,'' which documents his journey
from Malibu, California to the rocky West Bank terrain.
	   In the latest edition of the Jerusalem Report magazine, Shifren
said in an interview that another surfing rabbi in Los Angeles
helped him find religion over twenty years ago. Not long
afterwards, he immigrated to Israel.
	   Shifren says that ocean tides teach a valuable lesson about
harmony.
	   ``I take a wave and there's another wave behind me,'' he told
APTV. ``It's the law of the surf. There's a wave for everybody,''
	   Shifren needs to drive about 30 minutes to reach the
Mediterranean Sea from his home in Kfar Tapuach, a tiny, militant
West Bank settlement which was founded by Jews from the outlawed
anti-Arab Kahane Chai group.
	   Shifren wasn't interested in talking politics however and said
the isolated community a good place to raise his four children.

Russia shuts down last Baltic military base
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SKRUNDA, Latvia (AP) _ Russia on Monday began closing down the
Skrunda radar base, its last military operation in the Baltics,
ending a resented half-century military presence.
	   The announcement of the closing was made both by Latvia and
Russia. One Latvian Foreign Ministry official was allowed onto the
base to watch Russian soldiers begin the complex shutdown process.
	   ``This means that World War II is finally over for our
country,'' Foreign Minister Valdis Birkavs was quoted as saying by
the Baltic News Service.
	   The Soviet Union annexed Latvia and neighboring Lithuania and
Estonia in 1940. Nazi troops occupied the Baltics in 1941-44, but
the Red Army returned and tens of thousands of troops were
stationed there for decades.
	   The Skrunda station, which opened in 1971, was Russia's
westernmost radar facility and a key element in its defense
network. It was so important that Russia insisted on keeping the
base even after all other troops withdrew from the Baltics in 1994
and Latvia grudgingly agreed to extend the lease.
	   The lease gives Russia another 18 months to dismantle the base.

Mexicans vote on controversial bank bailout
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with new details thruout. Trims. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ About 3 million people reportedly took part
in an opposition party's weekend referendum on a bank bailout plan,
a vote that was more a protest demonstration than a formal
election.
	   Leaders of the leftist Democratic Revolution Party said that
about 95 percent of those who cast ballots across Mexico on Sunday
agreed with its opposition to the government's plan to absorb a
dlrs 65 billion bad-loan fund into the national debt.
	   The turnout was more significant than the result: the wording of
the referendum clearly favored a vote against the government plan _
claiming it would raise taxes, cut spending on health and education
and lead to foreign takeover of banks.
	   A separate national poll by the dailies El Norte and Reforma,
worded to focus on the plan's intent to avoid bank failures, 46
percent were opposed to the plan and 35 percent in favor of it,
though the papers did not cite a margin of error.
	   The leftist party spent about dlrs 1 million setting up 17,000
informal voting booths across the country.
	   The claimed figure of 3 million is about half the vote
Democratic Revolution received in the 1994 presidential election,
where it finished third, and 8.5 percent of the total vote that
year.
	   Marco Provencio, a spokesman for the Finance Secretariat, called
the referendum ``an exercise in manipulation'' that ``sought to
falsify the government position.''
	   While many major Mexico City dailies reported the turnout as
large, the government's news agency, Notimex, reported ``low
participation'' and said many of those voting did not understand
the issue.
	   The bank bailout, part of a larger financial package, has become
a major controversy in Mexico. Even President Ernesto Zedillo's
Institutional Revolutionary Party has proposed major modifications
to the government plan.
	   The fund, known as Fobaproa, absorbed billions of dollars in bad
loans following a December 1994 peso devaluation that sent interest
rates soaring and caused many borrowers to default.
	   The government says the package prevented massive bank failures
and helped save the economy as a whole. Critics claim it absorbed
illegal or improper loans, including some channeled to the ruling
party itself.

Father: Saudi septuplets could stay in hospital until they're 1
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By FAIZA SALEH AMBAH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ Seven-month-old Saudi
septuplets could remain in the hospital until they're a year old
and the family is better able to care for them, their father said
Monday.
	   The situation of the four boys and three girls, who were born
Jan. 14, is far different from that of the world's other set of
surviving septuplets, born last November to Kenny and Bobbi
McCaughey of Carlisle, Iowa.
	   The McCaugheys had as many as 60 volunteers working in shifts at
their home to help feed and care for their babies.
	   But the parents of the Saudi septuplets _ Hasna Mohammad Humair
and Abdullah Mohammad Ali al-Summan _ have had to rely on the staff
of the government hospital in the southern Saudi city of Abha and
two recently hired Malaysian nannies.
	   ``I heard that the hospital wouldn't mind for the babies to stay
there until they reach 1, and it's an option we're considering,''
al-Summan told The Associated Press in a telephone interview from
Abha.
	   Officials at the Abha hospital previously said the children
could stay until their parents were able to take them home.
	   But the children's mother, Humair, who visits the hospital twice
a day to feed the babies, would like to take them home sooner
rather than later.
	   ``I miss them very much and would like them home soon,'' she
said, noting that the girls are starting to crawl and the boys
starting to roll over.
	   Al-Summan believes the children are getting better care at the
hospital than they could get at home.
	   ``At the hospital they are being monitored daily by doctors and
nurses,'' he said. ``We can't give them the same care here at
home.''
	   He also said his wife was still weak from the caesarian
delivery, her second. They couple already has five other children
at home.
	   Al-Summan described the babies as a handful, even with the
nannies.
	   ``One has to be fed, another needs to be changed, one is crying
and the other four need the same constant attention and
supervision,'' he said. ``It's mayhem!''

Russia insists WTO membership bid on course despite crisis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Russia-Economy, World Markets &QL; 
 &UR; By PHILIP WALLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Russia remains on course to join the World Trade
Organization despite the economic chaos ravaging the country, a
Russian official said Monday.
	   Talks with other governments about Russian membership were held
last month in Geneva and the process is continuing, he said.
	   ``We are looking forward to joining this organization,'' the
official, based at the Russian mission to international
organizations in Geneva, said on condition of anonymity. ``I think
there is no change.''
	   Also Monday, WTO Director-General Renato Ruggiero said countries
risk plunging themselves and others into crisis if they try to
limit the turmoil's impact by slamming the door on foreign imports.
	   After stock markets in Asia, Europe and the Americas plummeted
last week following Russia's economic and political upheaval, fears
have risen about the possible knock-on effect on Western economies.
	   ``Anything involving protectionist measures would lead to the
worst possible situation,'' former Italian trade diplomat Ruggiero
was quoted by his spokesman Keith Rockwell as saying.
	   In a speech in January this year, Ruggiero made clear his desire
to see Russia admitted to the WTO, saying it would give the global
trading system a stable foundation, particularly during periods of
economic stress.
	   Russia has expressed its desire to join, but faces the
difficulty of bringing its formerly centrally planned economy into
line with the trade body's free market rules.
	   The increased problems that Russia's current crisis could heap
on its membership bid were highlighted Monday by comments from the
European executive commission.
	   Lousewies van der Laan, Brussels-based spokeswoman for EU
Foreign Affairs Commissioner Hans van den Broek, said Russia hadn't
met certain conditions for joining the WTO.
	   A formal application for membership has yet to be made. When
asked about prospects for such a move soon, van der Laan replied:
``Things are a little bit stuck at the moment.''
	   Despite Ruggiero's warning, WTO officials say there has been
little indication so far that countries facing problems are
resorting to protectionist measures to stave off effects of the
turmoil. ``We are pleased there hasn't been a knee-jerk reaction,''
Rockwell said.
	   The WTO will continue to monitor the situation to ensure
governments adhere to their obligations under WTO agreements, he
added.

Albright delivers indirect criticism of Germany over refugee return
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Krajisnik comments &QL; 
 &UR; By SRECKO LATAL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ After delivering veiled
criticism of Germany for repatriating Bosnian refugees, U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright urged Bosnia's leaders Monday
to allow people to return to the homes they fled in the bloody war.
	   ``Now it is time for Bosnia's people to get back what they had
before the war: their homes, their security, their freedom to
travel and work where they choose,'' Albright told reporters after
meeting Muslim and Croat members of Bosnia's joint presidency.
	   ``And it's time for Bosnia to have something it didn't have
before the war; a chance to be a free country that is fully a part
of Europe,'' she added.
	   Albright traveled to the Serb-ruled part of Bosnia and then on
to the territory governed by the Muslim-Croat Federation to give a
boost to candidates in this month's election who support the 1995
Dayton Peace Accords which ended the 3 1/2-year war.
	   In a speech here Sunday, Albright criticized leaders of all
three ethnic groups for not doing enough for the return of
refugees, which Washington considers the key to rebuilding a
multi-ethnic state.
	   She also delivered some veiled criticism of Germany for its
efforts to repatriate Bosnian refugees who fled there during the
1992-1995 conflict.
	   ``It is wrong to stop refugees from coming home,'' she added.
``But I hope our European allies will recognize that it is also
irresponsible to force them to return where there is no security,
no housing, and no jobs.''
	   Aides said her remarks were directed against the German
government.
	   On Monday, Albright met with the Croat member of the presidency,
Kresimir Zubak, who split from the ruling Bosnian Croat hard-line
party and formed a new moderate party. She then conferred with the
Muslim member of the presidency, Alija Izetbegovic.
	   Albright said she urged Izetbegovic and Zubak to build joint
institutions, a market economy and free and fair elections Sept.
12-13.
	   Protocol would have normally required that she meet first with
Izetbegovic as the chairman of the presidency. Meeting first with
Zubak was seen as an attempt to show U.S. support for him against
Croat hardliners.
	   After his meeting, Izetbegovic said he asked for U.S. help in
establishing a unified border police to prevent ``unwanted people''
and terrorists from entering the country.
	   But the Serb member of the Bosnian presidency, hardliner Momcilo
Krajisnik, said Monday that Albright was under a ``delusion'' that
her ``protegees'' can implement the Dayton agreement.
	   ``Madam Albright is probably under delusion, because they are
not the favorites in Republika Srpska and the Dayton agreements
cannot be implemented through them, because they are not capable of
understanding certain problems in the implementation,'' Krajisnik
told the independent Beta news agency.
	   U.S. officials have expressed concern over the accelerated pace
this year of refugee returns from Germany to Bosnia _ about
one-third of the 75,000 repatriations occurring in July alone.
	   Some deportees were given financial incentives to go home while
others were forced back, U.S. officials have said.
	   Earlier this month, a State Department spokesman, James Foley,
said many returnees from Germany are not properly registered in
their temporary residences for elections.
	   This has produced problems for the election supervision effort
of the Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe, he said.
	   Foley said uncoordinated actions that send refugees where they
don't belong ``play into the hands of the hard-liners and move us
away from the creation of a truly single Bosnia with two truly
multi-ethnic entities.''
	   German Interior Minister Manfred Kanthar has pointed out that
the country that has taken in 350,000 fleeing Bosnians needs no
advice on how to deal with the issue.

husband's name. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW _ Strolling around the Moscow auto show with her pregnant
tummy swelling under blue denim overalls, a hopeful Yelena
Pleshakova searched for a new car to carry around her first child.
	   ``We're working, working, working. We're making more money than
before. If you work hard, you're free to succeed and there is
nothing to hold you back,'' said Pleshakova, a 25-year-old math
teacher married to an engineer.
	   Across the city at the gritty Zil auto factory, however, Viktor
Ivinsky can't even dream of the day when he may be able to afford a
car.
	   ``My salary was worth dlrs 300 two weeks ago. Now it's worth
dlrs 200,'' said Ivinsky as he waited for the bus. ``What will it
be worth two weeks from now? This crisis is like having a gun at my
head and a knife at my throat.''
	   Like Pleshakova and even Ivinsky, many Russians don't want to
trade their freedom for a return to Soviet-style controls, but they
do want lasting stability _ something Yeltsin has not provided.
	   Seven years after the Soviet collapse, Russia's economic reforms
are tottering as a result of lawlessness, corruption, greed, a lack
of political will and often ignorance of the way a free market
works.
	   In the past two weeks, Russia has been shaken by an economic
crisis in which the ruble was devalued, the government defaulted on
its debt, the stock market has virtually collapsed and President
Boris Yeltsin dismissed the government.
	   Yeltsin's main economic reforms _ privatization of state
property and ending price controls _ wiped out the Soviet-era
security of full employment and a steady ruble. Until 1991, the
cost of bread had hardly wavered since Stalin ruled.
	   At the beginning of Yeltsin's reforms, few Russians complained.
Although prices soared, lines and ration coupons vanished and
stores quickly were full of goods after the long years of Soviet
poverty.
	   Russians now have the liberty not only to choose their leaders
but to decide their future, to work or not to work, and the
responsibility for their lives is in their hands and not the
state's.
	   ``I don't want the old system. In Soviet times, I clocked in and
clocked out just like a robot,'' said Nikolai Kondratiev, 45, a
metal worker. ``Now I'm free to work how I want and I know if I
don't work I can't feed my family.''
	   A rudimentary trade and service economy has appeared. Small
privately owned shops and restaurants abound. A class of wealthy
``new Russians'' has emerged, but the creation of an extensive
middle class has remained elusive.
	   ``Five years ago I don't think I would have risked having a
family,'' said Pleshakova. ``Now I will, and I don't want to go
back to those times.''
	   Fickle, ailing and determined to stay in power, Yeltsin says he
still believes in economic reform and democracy. But he has never
fully implemented change, eroding his credibility and strengthening
the opposition.
	   ``I have no idea what this government is doing,'' said Ivinsky,
the Zil worker, who arrived in Moscow four months ago after fleeing
unemployment in the desolate tundra of western Siberia where he
worked at an oil rig.
	   ``There is support for the Communists because people live worse
and worse,'' Ivinsky said. ``But they wouldn't be for those
Communists if their lives weren't so bad.''
	   Now that times are troubled again, bad memories are coming back.
	   The mood is glum out at the All-Russia Exhibition Center, still
commonly known as the Exhibition of Economic Achievements, a vast
park where the aging pavilions in which the Soviet Union once
displayed its accomplishments are packed with traders selling
imported refrigerators, TVs, washing machines, clothes.
	   ``It's really terrible. We are all waiting for the new currency
rate. Russia lives off imports so what happens to the dollar is
important,'' said Lyudmila Korzyoneva, who runs a small lighting
and electrical supplies shop in the building which once displayed
Soviet advances in physics.
	   Except for a Russian-made immersion heater that costs 17 rubles
(dlrs 2.50), everything in Korzyoneva's store is imported. She's
stripped the price tags off until the ruble stabilizes. Customers
must bargain to buy anything.
	   With two children, one of whom is already in college, Korzyoneva
is not about to close her shop.
	   Russia's reliance on imports leaves traders _ and customers _
vulnerable to exchange rates since goods are purchased abroad in
dollars and then sold in rubles.
	   Because imports are expensive, many urban Russians rely on food
grown at their dachas for a large part of their diet. In rural
areas, the hunter-gatherer culture has returned. Fishing is for
food, not fun. Mushrooms are not a delicacy but a steady _ free _
source of nourishment.
	   The presence of imports shows Russia does have a sort of open,
market economy. But the absence of Russian products is equally
disturbing and a sign that domestic production has collapsed, and
with it jobs.
	   Much of the current crisis is a result of the instability of
Russian banks, many of which were involved in speculation rather
than loans to finance industrial and agricultural development.
	   Russians above all blame the government for the country's
economic woes. High policies, confusing legislation and failure to
root out ubiquitous corruption are the main reasons cited for the
current chaos.
	   Pleshakova and her husband, Alexei, came of age when Yeltsin
took power. They don't blame the ailing leader, and their remain
hopeful of their own ability to make a better future.
	   ``The reformers didn't make mistakes,'' said Yelena. ``Russia,
its people, are just so unpredictable.''

More than 1.5 million marooned in north Indian flood
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RAISES death toll to 2nd graf. Minor edits. &QL; 
 &UR; By HEMA SHUKLA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Police hoped to locate 20 villages that
reportedly disappeared Monday in floodwaters, as aid workers pulled
bloated bodies from the turbulent waters submerging a wide swathe
of northern India.
	   Officials in Lucknow, the Uttar Pradesh state capital, put the
death toll at 1,086 on Monday. At least 32 people drowned in
different parts of the state Sunday and Monday and 34 others died
in a cholera epidemic caused by the flood, said Ram Kumar Yadav, a
senior official in the state's Interior Department.
	   ``The destruction is so overwhelming that rescue efforts seem
futile,'' said Kripa Shankar Pandey, a local reporter who lives in
Gorakhpur at the center of the disaster zone.
	   Working with fewer than 1,500 boats _ most of them aging,
cracked rowboats _ police failed to find any trace of 20 isolated
clusters of huts in the unending stretch of water in Uttar Pradesh,
India's most populous state and one of its poorest.
	   Jeetendra Singh, a government administrator in Gorakhpur, said
an estimated 1.5 million villagers were surrounded by floodwaters
and marooned. Authorities were trying to fly in at least 300
sturdy, motorized boats from Calcutta and Bombay on air force
planes. Currently, only 11 motorized boats are available for rescue
operations, said Singh.
	   Thousands of acres (hectares) of standing crops were submerged,
along with tens of thousands of homes. Officials had not begun
estimating the amount of damage to property and livestock.
	   Across the state in Gorakhpur, Singh admitted the administration
was overwhelmed by the problem. Rescue work was slow, he said, but
several hundred people had been brought to dry areas and were being
housed in government shelters where they received food and
medicine.
	   At least one hastily built shelter was itself submerged, said
Pandey. Refugees from the shelter swam to higher areas and were
forced to spend the night in the rain, he said.
	   Air force helicopters dropped food and tarpaulins to people
marooned on their rooftops, Singh said.
	   Rivers in eastern Uttar Pradesh state continued to rise. The
Rapti River, which flows through Gorakhpur, broke its embankment in
20 places. A power station south of Gorakhpur was shut down because
of the rising water and a railway station was submerged.
	   Two thousand trucks loaded with food and supplies were stranded
on a national highway.
	   Authorities blocked underground sewers, fearing that flood water
would rush into areas in Gorakhpur city that were still dry. But,
residents complained that it caused refuse to flow back into their
neighborhood and homes and contaminate drinking water.
	   Municipal authorities were trying to pump back the sewage, Singh
said.

Doctor, coach fined in second verdict on East German doping
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ A former East German doctor and a swimming coach
who admitted giving performance-enhancing drugs to young female
swimmers were convicted Monday of causing bodily harm and fined.
	   It was the second verdict in cases dealing with the former
communist country's drive in the 1970s to create Olympic champions
by giving young athletes' anabolic steroids.
	   The three doctors and two coaches sentenced so far have avoided
prison terms, in part because they admitted administering the
drugs. Proceedings are continuing separately against coaches and
doctors who have remained silent on the charges.
	   The Berlin state court on Monday imposed a fine of 7,200 marks
(dlrs 4,000) on Rolf Glaeser, who coached East Germany's showcase
Dynamo Berlin team from 1971-1984. Former team doctor Dieter Binus
was fined 9,000 marks (dlrs 5,000).
	   Presiding judge Hansgeorg Braeutigam said the trial showed that
the young swimmers suffered injury such as unusual muscle growth as
a result of the doping program.
	   Among the swimmers who received the drugs _ some as young as 12
at the time _ are 1980 Olympic medalist Christiane Sommer, who
testified against Glaeser.
	   While admitting administering the drugs, Glaeser insisted in
testimony that he did not know then of their possible dangers. But
he said he regretted that he did not take questions about the side
effects more seriously at the time.

German companies silent on lawsuits from Nazi slave laborers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By IAN MADER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Major German companies reiterated
their willingness Monday to compensate Nazi-era slave laborers, but
declined to comment on U.S. lawsuits pressing the claims.
	   A lawsuit filed Sunday in New York against Volkswagen and other
German firms, and another to be filed Monday in New Jersey against
VW alone, seek a portion of company profits for thousands of people
forced to work for the Nazi war machine.
	   The German companies, which also include Siemens, Krupp,
Daimler-Benz, Audi and BMW, said they had not yet seen the lawsuits
and wouldn't comment on them until after a thorough review.
	   But some German firms already have said they are ready to
compensate former slave laborers. Following the recent settlement
by Swiss banks with Jewish groups, they proposed an industry-wide
fund administered by the government be set up.
	   Chancellor Helmut Kohl rejected that idea, however, saying it is
up to the firms to handle the issue.
	   Daimler-Benz repeated its willingness to donate to such a fund
Monday, while adding that it did not believe it was legally
required to compensate slave laborers.
	   Munich lawyer Michael Witti, who is involved in the New York
lawsuit, said Monday such a fund would be acceptable only if the
victims have some voice in deciding on payouts.
	   Separately, Volkswagen, Europe's largest automaker, pledged in
July to provide ``humanitarian help'' on its own for its former
slave laborers.
	   Details are to be decided at a supervisory board meeting Sept.
11, VW chief Ferdinand Piech said Monday.
	   Some firms that used slave labor during World War II have since
made donations to Jewish groups; Daimler gave 20 million marks
(dlrs 11 million) and Krupp, the steel and engineering group, said
it provided 10 million marks (dlrs 5.5 million) in 1959.
	   But German companies have long resisted paying direct
compensation, maintaining that the Nazi regime was responsible for
arranging slave labor, and that the companies merely supervised the
workers.
	   The companies generally argue that the current government, as
successor to the Nazi regime, should handle compensation for slave
laborers.
	   The government has paid billions in compensation for health
damage and imprisonment, but argues the companies are responsible
for back wage claims.
	   Witti and New York partner Ed Fagan also have filed other
Holocaust-related lawsuits, including one against European insurers
seeking compensation for unpaid Nazi-era policies of Holocaust

groups to set up a fund for the claimants, saying their clients
would not have enough control over the money.

With flowers, tears and prayers, Britain remembers Princess Diana

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ With thousands of flowers, heartfelt notes and
hymns in London's great cathedrals, Britons marked the first
anniversary of Princess Diana's death Monday. Her somber young sons
and the royal family prayed together, away from public eyes.
	   Wearing black ties as a symbol of their mourning, Prince
William, 16, and Prince Harry, 13, entered the tiny stone church of
Scotland's Crathie parish flanked by their father, Prince Charles,
Queen Elizabeth II and other royal relatives.
	   William, the lanky physical embodiment of his mother, hung his
head and was mostly shielded from the cameras. Harry took care to
show no expression.
	   In London, outside the palace where Diana lived, and in Paris,
near the mouth of the traffic tunnel where she died in a car crash,
crowds gathered to pay their respects or merely to view the
spectacle.
	   Many left behind flowers, stuffed animals and lovingly rendered
portraits of the princess, just as they did _ in vastly larger
numbers _ in the days after her death.
	   ``It's the thing to do,'' said Maureen Poole of London,
clutching a bunch of carnations at Kensington Palace. ``To just
come when she dies and to never come again, especially this first
year, would seem empty.''
	   ``Every year, August 31st, we will always remember,'' read one
scrawled placard nestled in a pile of bouquets at the palace.
	   At Diana's ancestral home in Althorp, 75 miles (120 kms) north
of London, her brother, Earl Spencer, and her sisters, Lady Sarah
McCorquodale and Lady Jane Fellowes, planned a service overlooking
her burial site on an island in an ornamental lake.
	   More than 1,000 people packed London's Westminster Cathedral for
a special afternoon Reqium Mass, and St. Paul's Cathedral _ site of
Diana's 1981 marriage to Charles _ scheduled an evening service for
the public.
	   Hundreds also flocked to Harrods department store to sign books
of condolence. Some mingled with owner Mohamed Al Fayed, whose son,
Dodi, died with Diana in the crash, along with their legally drunk
driver, Henri Paul.
	   ``It has been a horrendous day,'' said Al Fayed, who spent the
morning with his family at his son's tomb on the family estate at
Oxted, 20 miles (35 kms) south of London. ``I just came here
because thousands of people were waiting for me.''
	   Harrods unveiled two identical 8-foot (2.5-meter) bronze
sculptures of Diana and boyfriend Dodi Fayed, featuring framed
photographs of the pair mounted above a pool of water and
surrounded by gilded seagulls.
	   Asked if he had a message for the royal family, Al Fayed said,
``I feel sorry for the princes. ... The two children, to have their
mother, is so important. But I am suffering, too. I lost my son.''
	   In deference to Diana, the queen ordered the national flag, the
Union Jack, to be flown at half-staff Monday on government
buildings and royal residences.
	   She had issued a statement Sunday night thanking people ``for
their messages and kind gestures of sympathy at this sad time and
for sharing their remembrance of the Princess of Wales.''
	   During the royal family's private service, the Rev. Robert Sloan
mentioned Diana by name in prayers and read Psalm 23 _ ``The Lord
is my shepherd, I shall not want'' _ and from chapter 40 of Isaiah,
``Comfort ye my people, sayeth your God.''
	   The boys left the church after the 20-minute service _
accompanied by 11 royal relatives and Prime Minister Tony Blair and
his wife, Cherie _ resolutely ignoring the news media.
	   In Paris, where it all ended for the 36-year-old Diana, Dr.
Frederic Mailliez, the off-duty French doctor who was the first to
attend to the princess, revisited the Place de l'Alama just outside
the traffic tunnel.
	   ``I wish I could have done more,'' he said, fighting back tears.
He added that he was overwhelmed by the number of people who
recognized him and reassured him he had done all he could.
	   ``I know I did my best, but she could have lived 50 years
longer,'' Mailliez said. ``It was not the first accident I went to,
and it won't be the last. But this one was very hard because the
victim was famous and very precious.''

Corinthians meets Penarol in first round game of Mercosur Cup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ Seekingits first Mercosur Cupw win,
Corinthians, the undefeated leader of Brazil's national soccer
championship, meets Uruguay's Penarol this week.
	   Led by Wanderley Luxemburgo, the recently appointed coach of
Brazil's national team, Corinthians has chalked up 23 points in the
national championship with seven wins and two ties _ but in the
Mercosur Cup it has posted a dismal 1 point, with one loss and one
tie.
	   Penarol, which shares last place with Corinthians, will also be
looking for its first win in the tournament on Tuesday.
	   Corinthians is hoping that playing at home will be the decisive
factor in picking up its first victory.
	   ``The encouragement of the fans is a big advantage,'' said
midfielder Ricardinho. ``They pressure us to do our best and ....
help intimidate the adversary.''
	   But playing at home didn't help Corinthians two weeks ago when
it lost 2-1 to Argentina's Racing.
	   ``Playing at home is always an advantage,'' said Luxemburgo.
``But if we play against Penarol like we did against Racing, it
won't help much.''

	   The Russian parliament's rejection of Viktor Chernomyrdin,
President Boris Yeltsin's nominee for premier, leaves the sides
with a few choices:
	   _ Within one week, the president has to propose the same or a
different candidate for another round of voting in the State Duma,
parliament's lower house. The Duma has to hold a vote within a week
of the nomination.
	   _ If the chamber rejects the nominee or nominees a total of
three times, the president is empowered to appoint a prime minister
by decree, dissolve the legislature and call new elections that
would take place within three months.

Norwegian PM takes sick leave for depression
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Leads throughout to ADD reaction, background &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Prime Minister Kjell Magne Bondevik is
suffering from depression due to overwork and taking a week's sick
leave, his office announced Monday.
	   Bondevik, who leads a fragile minority center government, has
been under considerable pressure recently as the country wrestles
with economic troubles.
	   The Norwegian currency, the krone, has declined about 6 percent
due to declining oil prices, the crisis in Asia and Russia and
uncertainty about the government's policy.
	   Bondevik's week off comes as the three-party government was to
begin debating next year's budget. Minister of Culture Anne Enger
Lahnstein will take over as prime minister as long as Bondevik is
ill.
	   The sick leave also forced him to cancel plans to travel to the
Middle East September 7-12.
	   Initial reaction from politicians across the political spectrum
was sympathetic.
	   Carl I. Hagen of the far-right Progress Party praised Bondevik
for his openness.
	   ``It is positive that the Prime Minister has followed up signals
(from health experts) to be more open about mental disease,'' Hagen
said.
	   Labor party leader Thorbjoern Jagland, whom Bondevik replaced as
prime minister last year, said he hopes Bondevik makes a quick
recovery and did not expect that the leave would affect work with
the budget.
	   ``It shouldn't matter. It must be allowed to be sick in this
country,'' Jagland said.
	   Bondevik, an ordained Lutheran minister, is considered an honest
and likeable politician with a high moral standard and has suffered
much less personal bullying from the media than many other
politicians.
	   But he and his government have been blamed for contributing to
the economic problems Norway is having by seeming indecisive and
internally divided, and many observers recently have predicted the
government is on the verge of falling.
	   Many say the government was too willing to increase spending for
favorite causes, especially a costly reform to give cash support to
mothers who stay home with young children, without making
corresponding cuts.
	   The krone's loss of value and dramatic interest rate hikes
during the last couple of weeks have driven home the urgency of
budget-tightening, which has forced Bondevik to weigh postponing
the second phase of the cash support scheme, which was his
Christian People's Party's top electoral promise.

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Congo's western war front fell largely
quiet Monday after rebel forces withdrew over the weekend from
their last strongholds.
	   Sporadic resistance triggered firefights in a corridor of land
that runs from Kinshasa to the Atlantic coastline, but the
wholesale combat of recent weeks died off.
	   President Laurent Kabila declared victory on Monday in the west
and said his allies would now turn their attention to rebel
territory in the east.
	   ``There are no fronts left in the west, the last bastions of the
aggressors have fallen,'' state-controlled radio quoted Kabila's
cabinet director Abdoulaye Yerodia as saying.
	   Angola's chief of army staff Joao de Matos said his troops were
prepared to lead the battle.
	   Angolan troops and tanks rumbled into the strategic Congolese
port town of Matadi over the weekend after rebel forces deserted
their positions. They also took control of a massive power dam in
the town of Inga.
	   Electricity in Kinshasa was still off due to a technical fault
in the power lines linking the capital to Inga, the dam's director
Daniel Yeuga Massawpu said.
	   Just weeks ago a rebel coalition of Tutsi fighters and
disaffected members of Kabila's military was poised to march into
Kinshasa and topple the government. The rebel forces, some of whom
helped Kabila overthrow longtime Zairian dictator Mobutu Sese Seko
last year, are trying to oust the president, accusing him of
mismanagement and corruption.
	   His capital in peril, Kabila regrouped and enlisted the help of
Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia _ a move that turned the tables on the
conflict in the west, but has also internationalized Congo's war.
	   Kabila has repeatedly said the rebel movement was a front for a
Rwandan and Ugandan invasion. On Monday he extended his charges to
tacitly accuse South Africa of complicity in the war.
	   Kabila was in Namibia on Monday, where he denounced South Africa
for selling tons of guns and ammunition to Rwanda.
	   South Africa denied Kabila's claim that the weapons sold to
Rwanda were used by the rebels.
	   Yerodia said a counter-offensive in the east was in the works _
a push that would move this central African country's civil war
away from the capital and into rebel-dominated terrain.
	   ``Our Angolan and Zimbabwean allies are here to kick out the
Rwanda-Ugandan aggressors,'' Yerodia said. ``They are not selective
about where they have to do that.''
	   The rebels acknowledged the loss of Matadi and Inga, but said
they would reorganize and wage a guerrilla war that could drag on
for months or years.
	   ``The government forces would've been by now completely out if
were not for the Angolans and Zimbabweans,'' rebel leader Ernest
Wamba dia Wamba told The Associated Press.
	   ``But they cannot stay long. And we're going to continue
fighting no matter what,'' he said.
	   The capital Kinshasa was quiet Monday after days of pitched
combat on its western and eastern suburbs left bodies scattered
through the streets and triggered a vicious spree of lynching and
summary executions.

Four winter games contenders submit formal bids to IOC
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ Four venues hoping to stage the
2006 Winter Olympics officially submitted their bids Monday, the
International Olympic Committee said.
	   The delegations which presented bid documents to officials at
IOC headquarters in Lausanne were from nearby Sion, Switzerland;
Turin, Italy; Zakopane, Poland; and Helsinki, Finland.
	   The Austrian city of Klagenfurt submitted its formal bid Friday.
The sixth contender, Poprad-Tatry in Slovakia, is expected to
follow Tuesday, the IOC said in a statement.
	   An IOC committee will make three-day visits to each of the
candidates in October and November to evaluate the bids.
	   The 2006 host city will be selected by the IOC on June 19, 1999,
at its session in Seoul, South Korea.
	   The Klagenfurt and Helsinki bids include events in neighboring
countries. The Swiss bid envisages most events will take place
within 30 kilometers (19 miles) of Sion, although some competitions
are planned for St. Moritz, in eastern Switzerland.

Ukrainians desperate to avoid effects of Russian financial crisis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VIKTOR LUHOVYK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A dozen grim-looking people stand quietly
at a currency exchange booth in downtown Kiev, waiting patiently
for someone to come and sell dollars.
	   Finally, a man comes and exchanges a 50-dollar note for hryvnas.
An old woman, the first in the queue, swiftly unwraps a
handkerchief containing a thick pack of hryvna notes and rapidly
thrusts them through the booth's window.
	   It's a typical scene these days in the Ukrainian capital.
	   Many banks, worried by the financial crisis in neighboring
Russia, have virtually stopped selling dollars, just as Ukrainians
have rushed to protect themselves from the crisis' effects by
converting whatever savings they have into the U.S. currency.
	   The hryvna, which was well within the government-set currency
fluctuation corridor just two weeks ago, started falling steadily
on news of the Russian ruble devaluation. Already, it has reached
the corridor's upper limit of 2.25 to the dollar.
	   Street rates are much higher, ranging from 2.35 to 2.45 to the
dollar.
	   Top government officials have appeared on national radio and
television almost every day over the past two weeks, trying to
reassure the already impoverished nation that Ukraine can avoid
Russia's fate.
	   But it's hard to persuade Ukrainians, who survived the 1991
collapse of the Soviet Union and hyperinflation two years later,
which made their savings worthless.
	   Some rush to buy whatever they can afford, sometimes as little
as 15 dollars.
	   55-year-old Nadiya Kovalyova spent half a day near a currency
exchange booth waiting for someone to bring small change.
	   ``I need just 10 dollars to pay the doctor,'' she said. ``I'm
not sure he'll take hryvnas.''
	   Although any talk of panic seems premature, Russia's crisis is
felt beyond Kiev's exchange booths. On the streets, people discuss
the latest news from Moscow, while news programs on every channel
start with an update on the Russian crisis.
	   The prices of most goods at outdoor markets have already gone
up, and some shops selling imported video and audio equipment have
closed down temporarily.
	   ``It's got to stop somehow,'' said 39-year-old Oleksiy, after
describing his disappointment over encountering new, higher prices
at the market he visited Sunday. ``No one knows what it's coming
to.''
	   The continuing suspense seems to worry government officials no
less than ordinary people.
	   Officials like National Bank chairman Viktor Yushchenko simply
acknowledge that public panic _ should it appear _ would overcome
all their efforts to defend the currency.
	   ``If we do not manage to persuade people that despite problems
in Russia stability is possible here, we will have problems,''
Yushchenko said.

In swift and brutal justice, two Palestinians executed
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with statement by Palestinian human rights
group &QL; 
 &UR; By KARIN LAUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Three days after the crime _ the slayings of
two Palestinian policemen _ the two suspects had been tried,
sentenced and put to death by a firing squad.
	   The execution _ the first ordered by Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat _ drew outrage from Palestinian human rights activists who
said Monday they feared it could pave the way for other abuses.
	   However, most Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip
appeared to support Arafat's actions.
	   The convicted killers were themselves Palestinian security
officers engaged in a longstanding feud with a rival clan.
	   The crime was seen as a prime example of a growing problem _
members of Arafat's 40,000 strong security force abusing their
power to settle personal scores.
	   Sunday's execution in the courtyard of the Gaza City central
jail was witnessed by more than 500 people, including Palestinian
Cabinet ministers, legislators and members of Arafat's Fatah
faction.
	   The condemned men, brothers Mohammed and Raed Abu Sultan, 25 and
24 respectively, were led into the yard blindfolded in the
afternoon and ordered to stand up against the back wall.
	   The two men, shaking and unable to stand up without support,
pleaded for mercy and were forced to listen to a slow count from 1
to 10 before 10 policemen in black hoods opened fire on them, said
witness Sami Awadah, a Fatah member.
	   When the volley of shots ran out, many in the crowd shouted
``Allahu Akbar,'' or ``God is Great,'' as a sign of approval.
	   The Palestinian human rights groups Al Haq and Mandela Institute
said Arafat was responding to public pressure when he ordered the
executions. The victims, brothers Majdi Khaldi, 32, and Mohammed
Khaldi, 30, were Fatah activists from a prominent family and there
was fear the blood feud would continue.
	   ``We believe Arafat's approval came in response to the mood of
he people of Gaza,'' the two groups said in a statement. ``There
was not enought time for those who committed the crime to defend
themselves.''
	   The Khaldi brothers were killed last Thursday. By Saturday
evening, the Abu Sultan brothers had been arrested, tried and
sentenced to death by a military tribunal. The judges deliberated
for only half an hour.
	   With the execution, Arafat also signaled that he remains in
control and will not be challenged. His message comes at a time
when he is less robust than in the past, both physically and
politically.
	   Arafat's actions raised some questions about whether he would
use such extreme punishment to deal with political opponents.
	   The Islamic militant group Hamas has been challenging Arafat's
rule and has tried to wreck the peace accords with Israel by
carrying out suicide bombings. An execution of a convicted suicide
bomber, for instance, could silence Israel's complaints that Arafat
is not doing enough to stop attacks on Israel.
	   However, Palestinian human rights activist Bassem Eid said that
while Sunday's execution could pave the way for more human rights
abuses by the Palestinian Authority, he did not expect a rash of
executions.
	   Eid said there was no precedent for Arafat using extreme force
to silence opponents. Twenty-three prisoners have been sentenced to
death since the Palestinian Authority was formed in 1994, but
Arafat commuted all of those terms to life in prison.
	   Arafat's most powerful political rival, Hamas founder Sheik
Ahmed Yassin, even welcomed the execution, saying it was in line
with Islamic law stipulating that killers be put to death.
	   Israeli government spokesman Moshe Fogel said the executions
showed that Arafat can act ``swiftly and even brutally'' against
those who hurt his interests, while at the same time dragging his
feet in fighting terrorism aimed at Israel.

Legislature rejects formation of new government

failing to vote, ADDS Chernomyrdin quote in new graf 26. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Lawmakers voted overwhelmingly Monday to reject
the appointment of Viktor Chernomyrdin as prime minister despite
warnings that Russia was on the verge of political and economic
collapse.
	   The Duma, the lower chamber of Parliament, voted 253-94 not to
confirm Chernomyrdin after more than three hours of bitter debate,
with 105 deputies declining to vote. Hard-line delegates called for
President Boris Yeltsin's resignation.
	   Chernomyrdin pleaded with lawmakers before the vote to approve
the formation of a government to tackle the country's crisis that
has seen the stock market collapse and the devaluation of the
currency. The acting premier, who needed 226 votes for
confirmation, watched glumly as the Duma voted not to confirm him.
	   ``Russia is on the verge of political and economic collapse,''
he told the lower chamber of parliament at the start of his
confirmation hearings. He said not another hour could be wasted on
political bickering.
	   ``We can come out of the only crisis by uniting our efforts,''
he added.
	   Chernomyrdin's rejection will unleash new uncertainty at a time
when the government is battling to keep banks and other financial
institutions afloat. At the very least, Russia appears to face
protracted political in-fighting as the various parties battle to
exploit the crisis.
	   Parliamentary leaders agreed after the vote to hold talks
Tuesday on drawing up a list of possible candidates for prime
minister to submit to Yeltsin. Talks to solve the crisis would
continue, they said.
	   The vote came on the eve of the arrival of U.S. President
Clinton for a previously scheduled summit with Yeltsin. The United
States, deeply concerned about what is happening in Moscow, has
urged Russia to continue with market reforms.
	   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov said Chernomyrdin, who had
been premier until April, was responsible for many of Russia's
current problems and his return to power would only make things
worse.
	   ``You will fail and bring the country to ruin,'' he told
Chernomyrdin during the debate before the vote.
	   Yeltsin said earlier he would nominate Chernomyrdin again if the
Duma voted against the premier, aides said. Before the vote,
Chernomyrdin said he would continue with plans to form a Cabinet
even if he was defeated.
	   Both sides warned that popular discontent could explode if the
crisis continues. ``If we fail to reach an agreement here
everything will spill out to the streets,'' Zyuganov said.
	   Yeltsin's parliamentary envoy Alexander Kotenkov warned the
opposition that both sides could be swept aside if there is no
swift action to end the crisis.
	   ``If this chaos lasts for several more weeks, it may happen that
there will be neither Communists nor us,'' he said. ``I mean a
popular uprising, merciless and senseless.''
	   Some Communist leaders said they were not afraid of government
threats to dissolve the legislature because they were confident of
winning the elections that would follow.
	   The government insisted it remained in control and that work on
tackling the country's economic crisis was going ahead. ``It is
business as usual for government headquarters,'' said government
spokesman Igor Shabdurasulov.
	   But Zyuganov indicated before the vote that he was ready for
more negotiations, signaling a deal was still possible.
	   ``There's no guarantee that full agreement will be reached
today. We're ready to take another look at it today,'' he told
reporters.
	   There was no sign of panic in Moscow and other cities Monday.
The Russian currency staged a mild recovery after last week's sharp
falls, although official trading remained suspended for a fourth
day.
	   Chernomyrdin told the Duma the government would take urgent
steps to prop up banks and protect individuals' accounts. He also
called for a program to prop up the ruble, lower taxes and revive
the industrial sector, but gave no details.
	   Government and opposition leaders reached tentative agreement
Sunday on a pact under which parliament would approve the new
government and give it a chance to solve the economic crisis. In
return, Yeltsin was to give parliament a bigger role in approving
the Cabinet.
	   But the Communists rejected the deal Sunday evening. Zyuganov
said his party's leadership could not support the pact because
there was no firm guarantee Yeltsin would abide by its provisions.
	   The Kremlin said Monday that Yeltsin would not accept the truce
until the opposition accepted it.
	   ``Everything we did during the week, everything we have agreed
on _ all that was suddenly destroyed,'' Chernomyrdin said bitterly
after the vote against his confirmation.
	   The breakdown appeared likely to usher in a period of political
head-butting similar to the one that surrounded the nomination of
the previous prime minister, Sergei Kiriyenko, last spring. The
Communists want maximum concessions from the government and don't
want to anger their supporters by appearing to give in too easily.
	   Under the constitution, the Duma can vote three times on a prime
minister's nomination.

First new Skoda rolls out of Bosnian factory
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AIDA CERKEZ-ROBINSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VOGOSCA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ The first Skoda Felicia to be
produced in Bosnia since the start of the war rolled out of the
factory Monday, the head of Volkswagen behind the wheel and a small
orchestra playing Mozart in the background.
	   ``With the establishment of Volkswagen Sarajevo we also want to
give our contribution to a stable peace and the economic
strenghtening of the region,'' Volkswagen Chairman Ferdinand Piech
said at a ceremony celebrating Skoda production in the Sarajevo
suburb of Vogosca.
	   During the ceremony, the first train in seven years rolled into
the little Volkswagen Sarajevo factory, bringing half-built Skodas
from the Czech Republic to Bosnia, where assembly work is
completed.
	   It took 18 months of preparation before production could resume
at the factory, which was destroyed by war.
	   The cooperation between Volkswagen, Europe's largest automobile
manufactuer, and Unis, its pre-war partner from Sarajevo, is
gearing up to produce 35,000 cars a year by the end of the
millennium.
	   ``This is an important new beginning of the two companies, but
also a day of significant symbolic value,'' German Foreign Minister
Klaus Kinkel said.
	   In the 20 years before the war, the factory produced a total of
400,000 cars and employed some 3,500.
	   The new factory cost 48 million marks (dlrs $26.5 million).
Volkswagen holds a 58 percent stake in the company. Initially,
between 5,000 and 10,000 cars are to be produced annually.
	   In a bid to boost multi-ethnicity, most of the 1,200 jobs were
given to former workers. Before the war, much of Bosnia was
ethnically mixed.
	   ``Here in this factory, Bosnians, Serbs and Croats will together
produce a modern car,'' Kinkel said.
	   Piech said he was not concerned about war erupting again. ``We
wanted to give a signal to encourage other investors to engage
here.''

Court bars Berlin from spying on far-right party
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ A court ruled Monday that the far-right
Republicans party cannot be considered an extremist group within
Berlin and therefore cannot be placed under city surveillance.
	   German security agencies are permitted to keep tabs on groups
that are deemed a threat to the nation's constitution and its
democratic ideals. And federal and state interior ministers agreed
in 1992 that the Republicans were such an extremist group and that
they could be placed under surveillance.
	   But the Berlin administrative court said Monday that party
members in the Berlin city-state had not posed any recent threat to
the constitution.
	   The party also is trying to have the status lifted in other
states, and the issue could eventually come before federal courts.
	   Republicans are campaigning on an anti-foreigner theme ahead of
Sept. 27 national elections in hopes of winning the minimum 5
percent of the vote needed to enter parliament.
	   Since World War II, Germany's splintered far right has failed to
achieve any significant, enduring success on the national level.
	   But the surprisingly strong showing by a rival far-right party
in an eastern state's elections in April has given the far right
some momentum ahead of this year's national election.

Intentional own goal ends bizarre match
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam (AP) _ The striker scores an own goal
with less than a minute left to play, breaking the tie and losing
the match. A tragedy? No, a farce.
	   Thailand unwillingly beat Indonesia 3-2 in a game that neither
team _ fearing a date with rabid hometeam fans in Hanoi that
winning would guarantee _ wanted to claim.
	   Vietnam Television reported that the match inspector said he
would recommend to the ASEAN Football Federation that the result be
scrapped.
	   Only a lopsided Indonesia victory would keep both teams from
advancing to the semifinals from Group A. But whoever won the group
faced the undesireable prospect of flying to Hanoi to play host
Vietnam before a rabid crowd on Wednesday, National Day.
	   The result was such a poor display that the half-capacity crowd
which had cheered so strongly during Myanmar's spirited 5-2 win
over the Philippines in the opener had virtually vanished 15
minutes into the match.
	   The commmentator for ESPN International, a U.S.-based cable
sports channel, openly derided the match, shown live regionally.
	   Several stars sat out for each team. Neither side made a serious
move on goal in a first half where there was not a single whistle,
and hardly a smear on a single uniform, despite a deteriorating,
muddy pitch.
	   It appeared that tournament officials must have talked with both
teams at the break, because Indonesia came out with more spirit. It
also knew that a tie was the same as a victory because it already
was atop the standings. Only a loss would move Thailand into first.
	   Mirobaldo Bento found virtually no resistance on a crossing pass
in the 52nd minute to put Indonesia up 1-0. Thailand finally came
to life, but as soon as Krisasha Piandet equalized in the 65th
minute, the Thais died again.
	   Aji Santoso put Indonesia back ahead 2-1 in the 85th minute, and
Thailand went on the move again, with Thersak Chaiman tying the
score at 2-2 in the 89th minute.
	   Then, with time running down, Indonesia moved the ball down deep
into its own territory. Two quick passes, and Yusuf Ekodono scored
as goalkeeper Hendro Kartiko, who earlier had made several
offensive forays to leave the goal open, stepped out of the way.
	   Thailand didn't have enough time to even think of employing the
same tactic at its own end.
	   Both coaches said afterward that they never had seen anything so
strange. Indonesia's coach said the players had fixed their action
on their own and that he had nothing to do with it.
	   In the earlier match, Myanmar needed an overwhelming victory but
found itself down 2-1 after Alfredo Gonzalez scored his second goal
for the Philippines in the 31st minute.
	   Myo Hilang Win equalized five minutes before the half, and Aung
Khine scored twice within three minutes to put Myanmar ahead 4-2 in
the 77th minute. Hilang Win got his second goal four minutes later.
	   But Myanmar realistically had needed a six-goal margin to make
things interesting in the nightcap.
	   The final is scheduled for Saturday in Hanoi. First prize is
dlrs 80,000.

Berlin may be unexpected last stop for track stars on Grand Prix
</HEADLINE>
circuit &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: ADDS quotes, UPDATES in parts with new quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By ROY KAMMERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Berlin's ISTAF meet Tuesday wasn't supposed to be
the place where some of track's biggest names ended their Grand
Prix track season.
	   But that could happen if they follow through on their threat to
skip the final event in Moscow because of Russia's economic
turmoil.
	   ``I don't believe anyone in Russia is interested in watching
athletics. It's like an insult: They're fighting for survival while
we earn millions,'' said Michael Johnson after capturing the
400-meter race three days ago in Brussels.
	   Johnson and Morocco's undefeated 1,500-meter ace Hicham El
Guerrouj were among 50 track stars that signed a petition in
Brussels. They wanted Saturday's final shifted from Moscow to a
safer venue.
	   Track officials refused, but many athletes apparently still are
considering skipping Moscow.
	   But not even the athletes themselves, including sprint stars
Maurice Greene and Ato Boldon, know how many will follow through on
their threat.
	   ``I hear a lot of people say they're scared, but they're
going,'' said Greene.
	   ``I hear 80 percent aren't going,'' said Boldon.
	   Johnson, Greene and Boldon won't run in Moscow, although all
three claim their reasons have nothing to do with the fears
expressed in Brussels.
	   But regardless of how many skip the trip to Russia, most of
track's biggest names are expected to flash their skills in Berlin.
	   El Guerrouj is among the four athletes still chasing a dlrs 1
million jackpot awarded for sailing through the Grand Prix circuit
unbeaten.
	   His remaining rivals are the U.S. stars Marion Jones in the 100
and Bryan Bronson in the 400 hurdles, along with Ethiopia's Haile
Gebrselassie in the 3,000.
	   Jones _ who says she will compete in Moscow _ will face one
obstacle less to winning the dlrs 1 million in Berlin. Her touted
French rival, Christine Arron, has pulled out of the meet.
	   But the brightest new star in U.S. track says she's hoping to
lower her own best of 10.71 at ISTAF.
	   ``I'm ready to run sub-10.70. I'm waiting and waiting for it. It
would be great if I could run it here,'' Jones said.
	   One of the biggest names to run at the event will actually be
interrupting his retirement.
	   Linford Christie, Britain's former Olympic 100-meter champion,
will anchor a 4x100 relay team composed of the young proteges he
trains in his management company called ``Nuff Respect.''
	   Kenya's 3,000-meter world record holder Daniel Komen is another
star that signed the petition against Moscow, but will run in
Berlin.
	   Whether Komen or other world or Olympic champions on the list
boycott Moscow remains an individual choice, according to Jon
Drummond, the U.S. 200 meter star who organized the petition.
	   ``As Americans we don't feel safe there,'' Drummond said.
	   He mentioned the bombings of two U.S. embassies in Kenya, as
well as the disco in South Africa.
	   Johnson's reason for skipping the final Grand Prix event was
that early season injuries had reduced him to competing in the 400
meters, instead of his usual double with the 200.
	   ``Frankly I'm tired of running the 400 and I'm ready to end my
season,'' he said.

Universidad Catolica eyes first place in Mercosur Cup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PORTO ALEGRE, Brazil (AP) _ Universidad Catolica of Chile visits
Gremio this week with a chance to take over first place in one of
the toughest groups of the Mercosur Cup.
	   The Chileans now hold third place in Group E with two points,
after a pair of 1-1 ties with Brazil's Vasco da Gama and
Argentina's River Plate. The two, among the best teams in South
America at the moment, are co-leaders with four points each.
	   A victory against Gremio on Tuesday would vault Universidad into
first place, with five points.
	   Not long ago, the prospect of a visitor beating Gremio at home
was all but unthinkable. But the 1995 Brazilian and Copa
Libertadores champion has fallen on hard times.
	   Gremio, once renowned for its steely defense and clockwork
attack, hasn't won a game since May. In the Brazilian
first-division championship, the team is in 24th and last place
with just three points in eight games.
	   In the Mercosur Cup, Gremio also is winless. The team lost 3-2
to River and 1-0 to Vasco and is stuck in last place with zero
points.
	   The game starts at 9:40 p.m. local time (0040 GMT Wednesday) at
Olimpico stadium.

Rioters rampage in Indonesian town after troops pull out
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with eyewitness saying mob stoned Chinese
man, town quiet at nightfall, U.N. report on poverty. &QL; 
 &UR; By IRWAN FIRDAUS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Soldiers fired warning shots in the
air and tear gas Monday at thousands of rioters who roamed a
northern town, hurling stones at shops and burning a hotel, a
ruling party office and other buildings.
	   It was the biggest riot in Indonesia since mid-May, when deadly
unrest swept the capital of Jakarta and other cities and helped
oust former President Suharto. There were no immediate reports of
arrests or injuries.
	   The unrest in the town of Lhokseumawe erupted after more than
600 soldiers left Aceh province in a conciliatory gesture by the
military, which is accused of atrocities there.
	   But bitterness spilled over when the troops pulled out in trucks
after lining up in a field during a ceremony. Some spectators
pelted the vehicles with stones, shouting insults such as ``pigs''
and ``dogs.''
	   The mob then attacked shops and other buildings, many of them
owned by members of the ethnic Chinese minority. The Chinese,
resented partly because they dominate business, are often targeted
in times of tension.
	   A human rights activist, Burhan, said by telephone that he saw a
mob throwing stones at a Chinese man. It was not known if the man
was hurt, and there were no immediate reports of arrests or
injuries.
	   A witness in Lhokseumawe said by telephone that teen-agers in
school uniforms torched the office of the ruling Golkar party,
which has lost credibility because of its role in buttressing
Suharto's autocratic rule for decades.
	   ``Many windows were broken, while heaps of debris and stones
were scattered along the streets,'' another witness, Sugito, said
by telephone.
	   ``Smoke billowed into the sky after people burned a hotel,'' he
said.
	   Mobs blocked fire trucks that tried to reach the hotel, a fire
brigade official said. The streets emptied by nightfall, save for
police and soldiers on patrol.
	   After a period of relative calm, there were scattered riots
around Indonesia over the past week. Looters rampaged through a
fishing town and on Monday, police on Lombok fought rioters who
were protesting against a newly elected governor.
	   There are fears that Indonesia's economic crisis and the strain
on millions of poor people could lead to bigger riots.
	   Compounding the worry, the United Nations released a report
Monday which said about 140 million people, or two out of every
three Indonesians, are likely to be living in poverty in 1999. The
number of people living in poverty was 11 percent in 1996.
	   The violence in Aceh may slow a policy of armed forces chief
Gen. Wiranto to withdraw troops from provinces where the military
has fought separatist rebels. Irian Jaya and the former Portuguese
colony of East Timor also harbor independence movements.
	   Military officials have said they must maintain security in
those regions, even if it requires more soldiers.
	   The departure Monday of 664 troops wrapped up a partial
withdrawal from Aceh, where government investigators have unearthed
bones of victims allegedly killed by the military and dumped into
mass graves.
	   Earlier this month, Wiranto apologized for wrongdoing during a
military campaign against Islamic separatist rebels in the late
1980s and early 1990s.
	   Wiranto also withdrew 250 soldiers from Aceh on Aug. 20. In the
wake of the downfall of Suharto, successor B.J. Habibie has pledged
democratic reforms and greater accountability.
	   Lt. Col. Agus Ramadhan said 2,000 troops remain in Aceh, which
is 2,000 kilometers (1,250 miles) northwest of Jakarta.

U.S. embassies closed in Ghana, Togo over security threats
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ACCRA, Ghana (AP) _ The United States closed its embassies in
the West African nations of Ghana and Togo on Monday because of
security threats, officials said.
	   No detailed reasons were given for the closings, though
officials said both were shut down for security reasons.
	   ``In response to the threat, the U.S embassy and all other
official installations will be closed from Monday, August 31 until
further notice, for all but emergency services, '' said a statement
issued at the U.S. Embassy in Accra, Ghana's capital.
	   The statement also advised the public to steer clear of official
American facilities in Ghana unless absolutely necessary.
	   In Togo, a small country that borders Ghana to the east, a U.S.
Marine guard confirmed that the embassy had been closed for
security reasons, but declined to provide further information.
	   Security had already been tightened at the Accra embassy
following the Aug. 7 bombings of U.S. embassies in Nairobi, Kenya
and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, which killed a total of 258 people,
including 12 Americans. More than 5,400 people were injured.
	   The Accra embassy was closed for three days after a bomb threat
earlier this month, but re-opened on Aug. 17.

Four teams tied for Argentine first division top spot
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Four teams share the lead of
Argentina's first division following weekend play that wrapped up
the fourth date of the Apertura championship.
	   Sitting atop the standings are Velez Sarsfield, Union, Boca
Juniors and Newell's Old Boys, all with 8 points each. Five teams
follow with 7 points.
	   Velez Sarsfield, last season's champion, joined the teams in the
top spot after a 3-0 victory over Talleres Friday, led again on the
strong play of Paraguayan goalkeeper Jose Luis Chilavert.
	   But the weekend's most exciting game was between two teams that
had been off to a slow start four games into the season. San
Lorenzo beat River Plate 4-3 in the highest scoring game of the
weekend.
	   River Plate, playing without star Marcelo Gallardo, continues to
struggle post-Marcelo Salas, the goal scorer who was transferred at
last season's end to Italy's Lazio.
	   Fan favorite Boca Juniors tied Gimnasia de La Plata 0-0, earning
a point and extending the team's improved play under new coach
Carlos Bianchi, formerly of Velez.
	   Newell's played Union to a 0-0 tie.

Four winter games contenders submit formal bids to IOC
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ Four venues hoping to stage the
2006 Winter Olympics officially submitted their bids Monday, the
International Olympic Committee said.
	   The delegations which presented bid documents to officials at
IOC headquarters in Lausanne were from nearby Sion, Switzerland;
Turin, Italy; Zakopane, Poland; and Helsinki, Finland.
	   The Austrian city of Klagenfurt submitted its formal bid Friday.
The sixth contender, Poprad-Tatry in Slovakia, is expected to
follow Tuesday, the IOC said in a statement.
	   An IOC committee will make three-day visits to each of the
candidates in October and November to evaluate the bids.
	   The 2006 host city will be selected by the IOC on June 19, 1999,
at its session in Seoul, South Korea.
	   The Klagenfurt and Helsinki bids include events in neighboring
countries. The Swiss bid envisages most events will take place
within 30 kilometers (19 miles) of Sion, although some competitions
are planned for St. Moritz, in eastern Switzerland.

Norwegian PM takes sick leave for depression
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Leads throughout to REORGANIZE bottom grafs, imporve
translation of Hagen quote. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Prime Minister Kjell Magne Bondevik is
suffering from depression due to overwork and taking a week's sick
leave, his office announced Monday.
	   Bondevik, who leads a fragile minority center government, has
been under considerable pressure recently as the country wrestles
with economic troubles.
	   The Norwegian currency, the krone, has declined about 6 percent
due to declining oil prices, the crisis in Asia and Russia and
uncertainty about the government's policy.
	   Bondevik's week off comes as the three-party government was to
begin debating next year's budget. Minister of Culture Anne Enger
Lahnstein will take over as prime minister as long as Bondevik is
ill.
	   The sick leave also forced him to cancel plans to travel to the
Middle East September 7-12.
	   Initial reaction from politicians across the political spectrum
was sympathetic.
	   Carl I. Hagen of the far-right Progress Party praised Bondevik
for his openness.
	   ``It is positive that the Prime Minister has followed up signals
(from health experts) to be more open about mental suffering,''
Hagen said.
	   Labor party leader Thorbjoern Jagland, whom Bondevik replaced as
prime minister last year, said he hopes Bondevik makes a quick
recovery and did not expect that the leave would affect work with
the budget.
	   ``It shouldn't matter. It must be allowed to be sick in this
country,'' Jagland said.
	   It is unclear what pressures might have triggered Bondevik's
depression. Bondevik, an ordained Lutheran minister, is considered
an honest and likeable politician with a high moral standard and
has suffered much less personal bullying from the media than many
other politicians.
	   But he and his government have been blamed for contributing to
the economic problems Norway is having by seeming indecisive and
internally divided, and many observers recently have predicted the
government is on the verge of falling.
	   Many regard the government as appearing too willing to increase
spending for favorite causes, especially a costly reform to give
cash support to mothers who stay home with young children, without
being able to make the corresponding cuts.
	   At the same time it presided over record wage increases last
spring. Experts have long warned that Norway's economy was
overheating and needed tightening.
	   The krone's loss of value and dramatic interest rate hikes
during the last couple of weeks have driven home the urgency of
budget-tightening, which has forced Bondevik to weigh postponing
the second phase of the cash support scheme, which was his
Christian People's Party's top electoral promise.
	   Bondevik has for the last week been criticized for breaking his
promises by mothers who have quit their jobs, counting on the
money.
	   To supplement his woes Bondevik has had to watch the Central
Bank's interest hikes threaten serious belt-tightening for the same
mortgage-burdened young families that now fear not getting the cash
support.

<TEXT>
	   GOMA, Congo (AP) _ From the capital, a victory by Congo's
government may seem at hand. But from rebel-held eastern Congo,
insurgents plotting their next move say time is on their side.
	   ``The war is going on,'' rebel leader Ernest Wamba dia Wamba
told The Associated Press.
	   ``The government forces would've been by now completely out if
were not for the Angolans and Zimbabweans,'' troops sent in to
fight alongside those of President Laurent Kabila, Wamba said
Sunday.
	   ``But they cannot stay long. And we're going to continue
fighting no matter what.''
	   Since the rebels _ a coalition of ethnic Tutsis, exiled
politicians and disenchanted members of Kabila's army _ took up
arms a month ago, they seized eastern Congo and closed in on
Kinshasa from the Atlantic Ocean, where they had airlifted
thousands of troops and equipment.
	   But the intervention of Angola and Zimbabwe appeared to have
warded off rebel advances at Kinshasa and saved Kabila _ at least
for time being.
	   On Sunday, the rebels suffered a major defeat in a month-old
campaign to topple Kabila when they pulled out of Matadi _ the only
remaining air base in western Congo under their control. Matadi is
350 kilometers (210 miles) southwest of the capital, Kinshasa.
	   Wamba said the rebel force in western Congo _ believed to number
between 6,000 and 9,000 troops _ had to withdraw to avoid being cut
in half by Angolan troops.
	   The result will be change in tactics: the rebels will split into
smaller, mobile groups ready to strike Kinshasa at times,
infiltrate the city and lie low until the departure of Kabila's
allies, he said.
	   ``It's a matter of what kind of war,'' said the 56-year-old
Wamba, who once lectured on political economy at Harvard
University. ``It is my understanding that now, we are conducting
the guerrilla-type war.''
	   ``Nobody can rule effectively only with foreign support,'' he
said. ``Zimbabwe cannot stay for a long time. Angola may not stay
for longer either. They have too many fronts open against them:
they have to be in Congo-Brazzaville, they have to deal with
(separatists) in Cabinda, they have to deal with Congo-Kinshasa,
and they are only 11 million people.''
	   The result of the new tactics could be a long and exhausting
war.
	   ``We are trying to tell our people that this may not be a few
weeks' affair. It could be months, it could be years. The more
people get that sense that this is a worthwhile struggle, the
people will continue struggling,'' he said.
	   The rebels still control a string of towns in eastern Congo,
including the third-largest city of Kisangani from where supplies
can be ferried on the Congo River to rebels around Kinshasa, and
were reportedly advancing on the southern fronts.
	   On Monday, Lunda Bululu, one of the rebel leaders, said the
rebels controlled more than 25 percent of Congo, and the fighters
were consolidating positions in the east of the country and were
moving toward north-central Equatoria Province.
	   The rebels accuse Kabila of power-grabbing, nepotism and
promoting his kinsmen from southern Katanga province in the
government, security services and the army.
	   ``Fundamentally, this is a problem of how power is being
misused,'' Wamba said. ``We need responsible leadership if we want
to have stability in Congo and regionally.''
	   Kabila accuses his erstwhile allies in Rwanda and Uganda of
sponsoring the rebellion and invading the country. Both countries
have threatened to intervene openly to protect their borders.
	   But rebel commander Jean-Pierre Ondekane said Monday that the
countries backing the rebels had yet to intervene in the war. He
warned they would do so if the war continues.
	   ``We have countries backing us too and they will come,''
Ondekane said during a visit to the eastern city of Bukavu in an
effort to rally the troops. ``If the negotiations fail, they will
enter into the war.''
	   Wamba said Rwanda and Uganda had hopes that with Kabila's rise
to power, peace and stability would resurface in eastern Congo.
	   ``The hope of the region was that with Kabila, security and
peace of the area will be established. But they are not there.''
	   Financing the war may not be so easy.
	   Wamba said the rebels controlled gold mines around Kisangani and
were collecting customs taxes to bankroll the rebellion as well as
negotiating international loans. He did not elaborate.
	   ``It is possible, if we organize ourselves very well, to
generate money which would have us sustain costs in a long (term)
way,'' he said.

Iraq demands U.N. probe into UNSCOM affairs
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Israeli reaction; Annan hasn't seen letter yet &QL; 
 &UR; By MARIAM SAMI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq has demanded a U.N. investigation into
the operations of the U.N. disarmament commission, accusing it of
spying for the United States and Israel.
	   In a letter to the U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan made public
Monday, Iraq said the U.N. Special Commission takes its orders from
the United States and coordinates with Israel.
	   ``We call upon you, as well as the Security Council, to put an
end to this charade which goes on under the cover of the United
Nations and (Security) Council,'' said the Aug. 30 letter by Deputy
Prime Minister Tariq Aziz.
	   U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said Annan's office hasn't seen the
letter and cannot comment. Israel called Iraq's accusations
``propagandistic fantasies.''
	   Longstanding tensions between UNSCOM and Iraq came to a head
Aug. 5 when Iraq suspended cooperation with weapons inspectors.
UNSCOM then stopped new arms inspections.
	   In a related development, a prominent inspector, American Scott
Ritter, resigned from the commission last week saying the U.N. is
not doing enough to stop Iraq from producing and concealing
biological and chemical weapons.
	   In his 10-page letter, Aziz cited newspaper reports that U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told chief weapons inspector
Richard Butler to hold off inspecting certain cites to avoid
creating a standoff with Iraq. Albright denied she interfered in
Butler's work.
	   Aziz wrote that Ritter's resignation was a red herring to divert
attention from UNSCOM's refusal to acknowledge Iraq's achievements
in eliminating its weapons.
	   Iraq accuses UNSCOM of deliberately prolonging its work of
identifying and destroying Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
Until UNSCOM certifies that Iraq is free of illegal weapons, the
Security Council will not lift the economic sanctions imposed after
Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   Iraq demands ``a serious investigation of all these facts,''
Aziz said in the letter, adding that the Special Commission should
be made ``an honest international body, not an intelligence unit
for a member country.''
	   ``We ask you as well as the Council, do you allow that an
apparatus attached to it coordinates with a party like Israel in
issues related to Iraq?'' the letter said. Aziz did not say if he
had any evidence to support that allegation.
	   Responding to the letter, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's spokesman David Bar-Illan said: ``It is another
regrettable condition of propagandistic fantasies'' being spread by
Iraq.
	   ``We hope that neither the U.S. nor the U.N. would be deterred
by such wild accusations and that the inspections will continue,''
he added.

Norwegian PM takes sick leave for depression
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Leads throughout to REORGANIZE bottom grafs, imporve
translation of Hagen quote. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Prime Minister Kjell Magne Bondevik is
suffering from depression due to overwork and taking a week's sick
leave, his office announced Monday.
	   Bondevik, who leads a fragile minority center government, has
been under considerable pressure recently as the country wrestles
with economic troubles.
	   The Norwegian currency, the krone, has declined about 6 percent
due to declining oil prices, the crisis in Asia and Russia and
uncertainty about the government's policy.
	   Bondevik's week off comes as the three-party government was to
begin debating next year's budget. Minister of Culture Anne Enger
Lahnstein will take over as prime minister as long as Bondevik is
ill.
	   The sick leave also forced him to cancel plans to travel to the
Middle East Sept. 7-12.
	   Initial reaction from politicians across the political spectrum
was sympathetic.
	   Carl I. Hagen of the far-right Progress Party praised Bondevik
for his openness.
	   ``It is positive that the Prime Minister has followed up signals
(from health experts) to be more open about mental suffering,''
Hagen said.
	   Labor party leader Thorbjoern Jagland, whom Bondevik replaced as
prime minister last year, said he hopes Bondevik makes a quick
recovery and did not expect that the leave would affect work with
the budget.
	   ``It shouldn't matter. It must be allowed to be sick in this
country,'' Jagland said.
	   Bondevik, an ordained Lutheran minister, is considered an honest
and likeable politician with a high moral standard and has suffered
much less personal bullying from the media than many other
politicians.
	   But he and his government have been blamed for contributing to
the economic problems Norway is having by seeming indecisive and
internally divided, and many observers recently have predicted the
government is on the verge of falling.
	   Many regard the government as too willing to increase spending
for favorite causes, without being able to make the corresponding
cuts. One such program gives cash support to mothers who stay home
with young children.
	   At the same time it presided over record wage increases last
spring. Experts have long warned that Norway's economy was
overheating and needed tightening.
	   The krone's loss of value and dramatic interest rate hikes
during the last couple of weeks have driven home the urgency of
budget-tightening, which has forced Bondevik to weigh postponing
the second phase of the cash support scheme, which was his
Christian People's Party's top electoral promise.
	   Bondevik has for the last week been criticized for breaking his
promises by mothers who have quit their jobs, counting on the
money.
	   To supplement his woes Bondevik has had to watch the Central
Bank's interest hikes threaten serious belt-tightening for the same
mortgage-burdened young families that now fear not getting the cash
support.

Paintings on Mother Teresa's life and work
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CALCUTTA, India (AP) _ An exhibition of 27 oil paintings
depicting Mother Teresa's life and work was inaugurated Monday in
Calcutta, which was home to the Catholic nun for nearly five
decades.
	   The week-long exhibition in the eastern city commemorates the
first death anniversary of Mother Teresa, who died Sept. 5 last
year at the age of 87. She had lived in Calcutta's slums, caring
for the destitute and dying.
	   Michael Gomes, a priest, who had known Mother Teresa since late
1940s, inaugurated the exhibition in a local art gallery. Sunita
Kumar, another close associate of Mother Teresa, has done the
paintings.
	   ``I'm grateful to God as he gave me the opportunity to offer my
help to Mother Teresa,'' said Gomes, recalling the nun had started
her Missionaries of Charity order from his home in Calcutta in
1950.
	   Mother Teresa autographed some of the paintings some years ago.
``The exhibition is my humble tribute to the mother's work,'' Ms.
Kumar said.

Orient Express whistles into Romania on nostalgia trip
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Whistling into the mountain resort of
Sinaia, the Orient Express _ complete with luxury carriages, no air
conditioning and coal-heated cabins _ arrived Monday in Romania for
the first time in years.
	   More than 100 passengers spent dlrs 4,625 for a luxurious
one-way journey from Paris to Istanbul. The five-day, four-night
trip crosses seven countries.
	   It was the first time the train, owned by the American company
Sea Containers, was making the entire trek.
	   In Romania, the passengers alighted in Sinaia, 120 kilometers
(75 miles) north of Bucharest, while the train was sent for
cleaning to the capital.
	   Former kings of Romania, Ferdinand I and Carol II, were among
the famous passengers who traveled on the Orient Express during its
heyday at the turn of the century.
	   Monday's passengers trekked to the royal castle of Peles in
Sinaia.
	   The train is due to depart later this evening for Istanbul,
before making the return trip to Paris. It will pass through
Bucharest on Thursday.
	   The original wagons were restored to their former glory.
	   Ion Soare, a Romanian railway manager, said that in keeping with
its old charm, there is no air conditioning and the cabins, each
decorated in a different style, are heated with coal.
	   The train inspired Agatha Christie's murder mystery bestseller
novel, ``Murder on the Orient Express''

	   TIRANA, Albania _ At the urging of former President Sali
Berisha, about 2,000 demonstrators broke through police lines and
marched on the prime minister's office Monday evening, calling for
the release of six opposition politicians jailed since Aug. 23.
	   ``We will use any peaceful means'' to free them, Berisha said of
the six, who were arrested for crimes against humanity during last
year's insurgency following the collapse of pyramid schemes.
	   ``We want them to know we are ready to fight dictatorship with
all means,'' Berisha told the crowd gathered at Skanderbeg Square.
	   He then urged them to march to Prime Minister Fatos Nano's
office, and the crowd surged past lines of police and security
officers wielding truncheons and shields.
	   Thousands more joined in the march toward Nano's office.
	   The protest proceeded despite police warnings of possible
terrorist acts.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe said it
and other international organizations would closely monitor the
rally and urged all sides to avoid provocations and violence.
	   ``Violence is undemocratic, illegal and is not an acceptable
form of expression,'' said an OSCE statement issued two hours
before the beginning of the rally at 6 p.m (1600 GMT).
	   Meanwhile, the security situation is deteriorating in other
parts of the country. Albania's main north-south road was blocked
by armed civilians for a half-hour Monday afternoon near the
southern town of Gjirokaster, 145 kilometers (90 miles) from the
capital, Tirana, the state news agency ATA reported.
	   An explosion rocked a health institute Sunday night in the
northern town of Shkodra. Also, police arrested two men who
attempted to set the building of the ruling Socialist Party on
fire, ATA said.
	   Nano held an urgent cabinet meeting last week to discuss new
police measures to strengthen security in the country.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq has demanded a U.N. investigation into
the operations of the U.N. disarmament commission, accusing it of
spying for the United States and Israel.
	   In a letter to the U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan made public
Monday, Iraq said the U.N. Special Commission takes its orders from
the United States and coordinates with Israel.
	   ``We call upon you, as well as the Security Council, to put an
end to this charade which goes on under the cover of the United
Nations and (Security) Council,'' said the Aug. 30 letter by Deputy
Prime Minister Tariq Aziz.
	   U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said Annan's office hasn't seen the
letter and cannot comment. Israel called Iraq's accusations
``propagandistic fantasies.''
	   Longstanding tensions between the commission and Iraq came to a
head Aug. 5 when Iraq suspended cooperation with weapons
inspectors. The commission then stopped new arms inspections.
	   In a related development, a prominent inspector, American Scott
Ritter, resigned from the commission last week saying the U.N. is
not doing enough to stop Iraq from producing and concealing
biological and chemical weapons.
	   In his 10-page letter, Aziz cited newspaper reports that U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told chief weapons inspector
Richard Butler to hold off inspecting certain cites to avoid
creating a standoff with Iraq. Albright denied she interfered in
Butler's work.
	   Aziz wrote that Ritter's resignation was an attempt to divert
attention from the commission's refusal to acknowledge Iraq's
progress in eliminating its weapons.
	   Iraq accuses the special commission of deliberately prolonging
its work of identifying and destroying Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction. Until the inspectors certify that Iraq is free of
illegal weapons, the Security Council will not lift the economic
sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   Iraq demands ``a serious investigation of all these facts,''
Aziz said in the letter, adding that the Special Commission should
be made ``an honest international body, not an intelligence unit
for a member country.''
	   ``We ask you as well as the Council, do you allow that an
apparatus attached to it coordinates with a party like Israel in
issues related to Iraq?'' the letter said. Aziz did not say if he
had any evidence to support that allegation.
	   Responding to the letter, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's spokesman David Bar-Illan said: ``It is another
regrettable condition of propagandistic fantasies'' being spread by
Iraq.
	   ``We hope that neither the U.S. nor the U.N. would be deterred
by such wild accusations and that the inspections will continue,''
he added.

Guyana tourist arrivals take big dive
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ With the number of tourists visiting
Guyana dropping significantly, tour operators said Monday they had
asked the government to save the industry from certain collapse.
	   From a 1994 high of 112,825 visitors, only 75,700 people
vacationed in Guyana last year and only 23,000, most Europeans and
U.S. citizens, between Jan. 1 and April 30 of this year.
	   Industry workers say the government isn't doing enough to
promote Guyana's rain forests and Kaieteur Falls, one of the
highest single-drop waterfalls in the world at 822 feet.
	   ``We have over 700 bird species and undisturbed areas where
wildlife roam. It is unspoiled and pristine, but who knows about
it?'' said Tony Thorne of the Wilderness Explorers agency.
	   Officials say political unrest early this year and a lack of
international air service have hampered the industry.
	   The Tourism Association of Guyana gave the government proposals
aimed at marketing Guyana. Officials say President Janet Jagan
appeared to be enthusiastic about the suggestions.

Yugoslavia refuses visa to senior US official

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ About 200 angry Serb women pelted
the U.S. information office with stones Monday to protest the
killing of Serb civilians, allegedly by Albanian rebels fighting
for independence of Kosovo province.
	   President Clinton's special envoy on war crimes issues told
reporters Monday in the Croatian capital Zagreb that the Yugoslav
government refused to let him visit the country to investigate
alleged abuses in Kosovo, including ``alleged criminal conduct'' by
Albanian rebels and Serb security forces.
	   The envoy, David Scheffer, said Belgrade's refusal to grant him
a visa ``indicates once again that government's insecurity about
its own accountability under international laws.''
	   Allegations of abuse by both Serb forces and Albanian guerrillas
escalated over the weekend after Serbian police said they had
discovered a crematory in the village of Klecka, where ethnic
Albanians allegedly had burned the bodies of at least 22 Serbs,
including women and children.
	   The rebel Kosovo Liberation Army has denied any role in the
killings.
	   On Monday, about 200 Serb women marched to the U.S. Information
Service in Pristina and demanded that an American official come
speak to them. When no one responded, the women shouted
``fascists'' and ``murderers'' and began hurling stones at the
building.
	   ``This is Serbia,'' shouted one of the women. ``Look at them,
high and mighty democrats! They can't come out and talk to us. They
only want to talk to (ethnic) Albanian politicians!''
	   Despite appeals by a security guard, the women shook the iron
fence around the compound for a few moments and then marched off
toward the offices of the International Committee of the Red Cross,
where they threw stones, talked to an official and then physically
attacked an ethnic Albanian security guard.
	   Nick Summer, the ICRC official, said the Red Cross was doing all
it can to get in touch with all those who can provide any
information on missing persons, including the 22 Serbs allegedly
killed and cremated by the rebels.
	   Summer said the Red Cross helps all civilians in need,
regardless of ethnicity. Dissatisfied, the women outside tried to
break down the gate and demolished part of the fence.
	   Meanwhile, Vladam Batic, a lawyer and leader of a minor Serbian
opposition party, initiated legal proceedings against Adem Demaci,
a representative of the Kosovo Liberation Army who has recently
acted as a spokesman for the rebels.
	   The lawyer accuses him of ``acts against the constitution,
violation of territorial integrity, undermining the military and
defense, armed rebellion, terrorism and genocide.'' But it was not
clear if a prosecutor would indict Demaci.
	   U.S. Sen. John Warner, R-Va., a member of the Senate Armed
Services Committee, toured the province Monday to look into the
suffering of refugees.
	   On the way, just about 10 kilometers (6 miles) outside Pristina,
he saw a good dozen houses burning in Komorane village, just about
a kilometer off the main road. There was no shelling. They were
clearly houses set ablaze without any fighting.
	   ``The American people are quite concerned about the open and
flagrant abuse of human rights,'' Warner said, alluding to the
continuing Serbian offensive. ``Our people will not tolerate a
continuation of these human rights abuses.''
	   ``Everything that can be done is being done'' to bring about
negotiations between the government and ethnic Albanian leaders,
Warner insisted. He said the KLA must be involved in talks because
it makes no sense ``to reach an agreement that will not be honored
by the KLA faction.''
	   Serb officials have accused the United States and international
agencies of favoring the Albanians, who compromise 90 percent of
Kosovo's 2 million inhabitants.
	   Since the government launched its crackdown in February against
the KLA, international attention has focused on the suffering of
tens of thousands of ethnic Albanians who have fled their homes in
advance of Serb forces.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed on both sides, and more than
260,000 have been rendered homeless by the fighting. Western
government have threatened to use force against the Serbs to stop
the offensive, but have yet to follow through.

Muralitharan (16-220) bowls Sri Lanka to victory
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with result &QL; 
 &UR; By IHITHISHAM KAMARDEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; -

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Off-spinner Muttiah Muralitharan returned the
fifth best figures in the history of test cricket as Sri Lanka
trounced England by 10 wickets in the one-off test at the Oval
Monday.
	   Muralitharan, the 26-year old introvert, once accused of
throwing, took 16-220 in 113.5 overs to lead Sri Lanka's victory
charge, it's first win on English soil in four attempts.
	   It was also Sri Lanka's second win over England in six tests.
The last time the two teams met, Sri Lanka, handed out a
five-wicket defeat in Colombo in 1992/93.
	   Muralitharan, took 9-59 in the England second innings as the
home side was bowled out for 181, leaving Sri Lanka 37 runs to
secure a famous victory.
	   In England's first innings 445, Muralitharan, took 7-155, thus
single-handedly destroying England. The only other wicket to fall
in the second innings was Alec Stewart's run out.
	   Left-hander Sanath Jayasuriya, who top scored in the Sri Lankan
first innings with 213, smashed 24 runs off 17 balls with two sixes
and as many boundaries to win in five overs.
	   Jayasuriya's opening partner Marvan Atapattu, unbeaten on nine,
flicked medium paceman Ben Hollioake for his only boundary to seal
victory with nine overs to spare.
	   Muralitharan's bowling effort ranks behind Englishmen Jim
Laker's 19-90 in 1956 and Syd Barnes' 17-159 in 1913-14, Indian
Narendra Hirwani's 16-136 in 1987-88 and Australian Bob Massie's
16-137 in 1972.
	   Sri Lanka's push for victory was delayed by a stubborn ninth
wicket stand between Mark Ramprakash and Darren Gough, who played
out 138 minutes for 53 runs, taking England from 127 for eight to
180 before Muralitharan struck for eighth time in the innings.
	   He had Ramprakash (42), brilliantly caught by Hashan
Tillakaratne at the short leg and seven balls later, bowled Gough
for 15 to end the long wait.
	   It was Sri Lanka's 14th win in 87 test and it fourth overseas
following its success over New Zealand in Napier 1994/95 and over
Pakistan in Faisalabad and Sialkot in 1995/96.
	   This was Arjuna Ranatunga's 12th win in his 55th test as captain
since taking over from Ranjan Madugalle in October 1989.
	   In fact, Muralitharan's 10-wicket haul is the first in a test in
England by a visiting spinner, since Pakistani Abdul Qadir's 10-211
at the Oval in 1987.
	   Man-of-the-match Muralitharan, during the second innings became
only the second off spinner to claim 200 wickets behind West Indian
Lance Gibbs, who had 309 in 79 tests.
	   Dominic Cork was his 200th victim, when wicketkeeper Romesh
Kaluwitharana, went sprawling to collect a top edged sweep, just
after lunch.
	   Muralitharan, reached the milestone with the same number of
matches as Australian Shane Warne _ 42 tests _ behind Australian
leg spinner Clarrie Grimmett, who raced to his in 36 matches.
	   Muralitharan, who was accused of throwing by England coach David
Lloyd during the test, finished the test with a career tally of 203
wicket at an average of 26.91.
	   Muralitharan's haul took his year's tally to 68 wickets in eight
tests, ahead of South African fast bowler Allan Donald, who has 66
in 11 matches.
	   England, resuming the day on 54 for two and needing a further 92
runs to make Sri Lanka bat again, slumped 116 for five at lunch and
lost three more soo after before Ramprakash and Gough came together
to delay the inevitable.
	   Skipper Arjuna Ranatunga's gamble to put England into bat first,
worked to his side's advantage.
	   After the home side struggled to score 445 thanks to two
centuries by Graeme Hick and John Crawley, Sri Lanka, went on a
leatherhunt to amass 591.
	   Sri Lanka was inspired by a brilliant double-century Jayasuriya,
and a watchful 152 by Aravinda de Silva, as they set the pace with
a record 243-run third wicket stand.
	   This is the second time Muralitharan has taken 10 wickets in a
match since his 12-117 against Zimbabwe in Kandy in January this
year.
	   Ramprakash, laboured for eight minutes over four hours top score
in the second innings, followed by skipper Stewart's 32.
	   It was Stewart's run out on the final morning that triggered a
morning collapse at 93 for three, when five wickets tumbled for 34
runs either side of lunch.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The Dow industrials fell below 8,000 Monday for
the first time in seven months in a drop that was threatening to
wipe out all of this year's gains.
	   The Dow Jones industrial average, which rose 43 points in the
opening minutes of trading, was down as much as 179.97 at 7,871.71
early in the afternoon. It was recovering somewhat in afternoon
trading, but still was off 115.60 at 7,936.08 on trading volume
that was active but below last week's frenzied pace.
	   At the depth of its retreat, the Dow had given up the last of
this year's gains. It ended 1997 at 7,908.25. The last time the Dow
closed below 8,000 was on Jan. 30.

RFE broadcast to Iran postponed for technical reasons
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Radio Free Europe will postpone
its broadcast into Iran for technical reasons, officials said
Monday.
	   Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, a U.S.-funded station, was
scheduled to start its Iranian program Tuesday.
	   ``We will try to get the broadcast going by the end of
September. ... It all depends on whether we can manage on the
technical and personnel level,'' spokeswoman Alena Fendrychova told
the news agency CTK.
	   She gave no explanation for the delay, but said the station was
set to start broadcasting ``if not in September, then in October
for sure.''
	   The station originally planned to beam its program into both
Iran and Iraq, but met resistance from the new Czech government.
	   The Social Democratic cabinet of Prime Minister Milos Zeman
argued that the station, located in a residential area, could
become a target of terrorist attacks.
	   Wednesday, the government agreed to allow broadcasts to Iran,
but not to Iraq. The Iran program would be monitored for
objectivity, officials said.
	   While other politicians were evasive on the issue, President
Vaclav Havel threw his political weight behind the station's plans.
	   Havel said Saturday that when the Czechs invited the U.S.-run
station to move to Prague, they should have known it would mean
leaving some decisions to station managers.
	   Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty began transmitting from Munich,
Germany, in 1951, broadcasting uncensored news to Soviet-controlled
countries behind the Iron Curtain during the Cold War.
	   The station moved its headquarters to Prague in 1995, following
communism's collapse.

Yeltsin, four other leaders to meet in Kazakstan

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Yeltsin, Nazarbayev discussing summit
preparations over the phone, graf 4. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Despite Russia's turmoil, President Boris Yeltsin
will fly to Kazakstan next week for a summit with the leaders of
four neighboring countries, officials said Monday.
	   Yeltsin is to be joined at the Sept. 8-11 gathering in Almaty by
his counterparts Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus, Nursultan
Nazarbayev of Kazakstan, Askar Akayev of Kyrgyzstan and Emomali
Rakhmonov of Tajikistan.
	   Four of those former Soviet republics _ all but Tajikistan _
signed an agreement in March 1996 pledging to deepen ties among
them but stopping short of a formal union.
	   Yeltsin and Nazarbayev discussed preparations for the summit
during a telephone conversation Monday, the Interfax news agency
reported.
	   The presidents of the five nations attending next week's summit
will sign agreements setting up a customs union and taking more
steps toward economic union, Nigmatjan Singarin, chairman of the
integration committee of the four republics, told the ITAR-Tass
news agency.
	   The prime ministers of the five countries also are scheduled to
hold a one-day meeting in Almaty next week to sign related
documents. It isn't yet clear if acting Russian Prime Minister
Viktor Chernomyrdin, who is trying to win confirmation of his new
government, plans to go.
	   Documents to be signed would allow unimpeded travel by citizens
of the countries, lift customs restrictions, facilitate money
transfers and provide for mutual recognition of academic degrees,
among other points.
	   The five-nation alliance is the latest attempt to form a union
among former Soviet republics. The Commonwealth of Independent
States, a loose grouping consisting of the 12 ex-republics, has
proven largely ineffectual.

 &UR; Eds: SUBS first item on Monica Lewinsky to UPDATE with
HarperCollins denial &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Monica Lewinsky's saga could become the
highest-priced sex story in history.
	   The tabloid Star offered dlrs 1 million to Ms. Lewinsky for
exclusive rights to her story, editor in chief Phil Bunton said
Monday. Bunton said the Star has not heard back from her lawyers
since the offer was made about 10 days ago.
	   He confirmed an account in the Sept. 7 issue of The New Yorker
magazine, which also said the Star's bid was topped by two book
publishers.
	   Citing unidentified sources, the magazine said HarperCollins
offered dlrs 2 million to Ms. Lewinsky for a book and a second
unidentified publisher offered dlrs 6 million.
	   Steve Coz, editor in chief at the National Enquirer, said he,
too, has offered Ms. Lewinsky money for her story but lamented that
most of the details have already been leaked, leaving little news
for readers.
	   Despite the offers, there has been no indication the woman in
the center of the White House sex scandal is willing to sell her
story, The New Yorker said.
	   Messages left at HarperCollins Monday were not immediately
returned. But Judith Regan, head of Regan Books, a division of
HarperCollins, denied The New Yorker report in an interview with
the New York Post.
	   ``I did not offer Monica Lewinsky dlrs 2 million for a book,''
she said. She said she hadn't talked to Ms. Lewinsky since January,
and suspected Ms. Lewinsky's mother, writer Marcia Lewis, was
putting out misleading information to drive the book offers up.
	   Post columnist Cindy Adams reported Monday that Ms. Lewinsky's
mother would serve as her ghostwriter and was holding out for a
dlrs 10 million offer before she ``puts pen to paper or Monica puts
knife to Clinton.''
	   Ms. Lewis is the author of a book about the sex lives of famed
tenors Luciano Pavarotti, Placido Domingo and Jose Carreras.
	   Regan said publishers have become more cautious about making
seven-figure offers because some of the big book deals that sprang
from the O.J. Simpson case wound up losing a lot of money.

U.S. approves vaccine against childhood diarrhea
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LAURAN NEERGAARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Medical Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved
on Monday the first vaccine against a leading cause of childhood
diarrhea, a virus that hospitalizes 55,000 American children a year
and kills 1 million in other countries.
	   RotaShield is for the intestinal infection called rotavirus that
is the leading cause of severe diarrhea in childhood. It was
developed by the National Institutes of Health and licensed to
Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories.
	   RotaShield is an oral vaccine given to infants in three doses,
at ages 2 months, 4 months and 6 months.
	   For now, children older than 6 months should not begin the
vaccination, the FDA said. Rotavirus is so prevalent that about 75
percent of all children are infected before age 5, but the youngest
infants are usually the sickest.
	   The vaccine won't wipe out rotavirus. But it promises to cut by
up to 80 percent the most severe illnesses, and vaccinated children
who still get sick have much milder cases.
	   Rotavirus attacks the lining of the small intestine, causing
constant diarrhea that can lead to severe dehydration.
	   In the United States, 3 million children are sickened each year,
500,000 need a doctor's care and 55,000 are hospitalized with
severe illness, the government says. There is no cure. But good
care, especially replacing lost fluids, limits deaths here to no
more than 40 a year.
	   In developing countries with poorer health care, rotavirus is
much more deadly, killing about 1 million children worldwide every
year.
	   In several clinical studies of RotaShield in American children,
the vaccine cut the number of rotavirus cases between 49 percent
and 68 percent, and cut severe diarrhea by 80 percent.
	   The main side effects were low fever, irritability and decreased
appetite within five days of the first vaccine doses.
	   Studies also found that giving RotaShield at the same time as
vaccines against polio, diphtheria, whooping cough, tetanus and a
form of meningitis did not alter those standard vaccines'
effectiveness.
	   Wyeth also is seeking to sell RotaShield in Europe and Latin
America. The company did not immediately announce a price.

New book claims to reveal Anne Frank's betrayer
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo NY90 &QL; 
 &UR; By WILLIAM J. KOLE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ A new biography of Anne Frank
contends her mysterious betrayer was the woman who cleaned the
building where the young Jewish diarist and her family hid from the
Nazis.
	   In ``Anne Frank,'' due in bookstores next week, Austrian
biographer Melissa Muller cites evidence she unearthed in German
and Dutch archives to support her theory that the long sought-after
informant was maid Lena Hartog.
	   Scholars reacted cautiously Monday to Muller's conclusion,
saying the betrayer's identity may never be known for sure because
the key players and known witnesses _ Hartog among them _ are long
dead.
	   ``I'm not convinced,'' said Peter Romijn of the Netherlands
State Institute for War Documentation, which compiles the
internationally best-selling ``Diary of Anne Frank.''
	   ``The evidence is largely circumstantial,'' he said, but added:
``It deserves at least more research and consideration on our
part.''
	   World War II researchers long have debated the chain of events
that culminated in the Aug. 4, 1944, raid on the Franks' secret
annex, tucked behind a movable bookcase in an Amsterdam canal
house.
	   Tipped off by an anonymous phone call, German agents burst
inside and hauled the Franks away to concentration camps. Anne died
of typhus in the Bergen-Belsen camp in the spring of 1945, just
weeks before it was liberated.
	   Hartog, who died in 1963, has been the subject of speculation
before. A year before the betrayal, the war documentation center
says, she confided to another woman that she thought Jews were
being hidden in the building.
	   But researchers have focused mainly on Willem van Maaren, the
man who ran the warehouse in the building in which the Franks had
sought refuge. Those in charge of sneaking food to the Franks said
in interviews after the war they were always afraid that Van Maaren
_ a man known as a snoop _ would realize what they were up to.
	   Muller, 30, claims that new evidence strongly suggests it was
Hartog who blew the whistle. Her claim is based, she says, on
archive records and interviews with a distant cousin of Hartog.
	   ``I'm not saying I'm sure she did it. It would be presumptuous
to say I've found the traitor,'' Muller told the daily NRC
Handelsblad. ``But there are so many clues which should at least
have been enough for the police to bring Lena Hartog before a judge
and examine this more carefully.''
	   Her book, written in German and published by Klaassen Verlag,
has been translated into English by New York-based Metropolitan
Books for publication in Britain and the United States. It hits
bookstores on Sept. 7, coinciding with the recent fuss over the
discovery of five more pages to Anne's famed diary.
	   The Anne Frank Foundation, which has turned the secret annex
into a popular museum, points out that Anne herself wrote about the
anguish of making unwanted noise that outsiders easily could have
heard.
	   Early in hiding, she wrote of how a sack of beans had burst open
and ``the noise was enough to wake the dead.'' Later, she wrote of
the ``slamming of doors'' and ``incessant shouting.''
	   ``It's possible that the Franks weren't careful enough _ that
they gave themselves away,'' said foundation spokeswoman Ita
Amahorseija.

Louise Woodward says court TV turned baby killing trial into soap
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS Edinburgh International Television Festival in graf

 &UR; By MAUREEN JOHNSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   EDINBURGH, Scotland (AP) _ Louise Woodward, the British au pair
convicted of killing an American baby, said Monday that television
turned her trial into a soap opera with a painful legacy: a nervous
giggle is her best-remembered testimony, and now autograph hunters
haunt her.
	   With her American lawyer Barry Scheck, who defended O.J.
Simpson, the 20-year-old took part in a debate on whether to allow
TV into British courts.
	   Scheck said it should happen only if all participants agree, a
stipulation he maintained would effectively bar TV from most U.S.
trials. Ms. Woodward said TV should never be allowed.
	   ``It is hard enough being handcuffed in the dock without having
a camera trying to take a shot of your handcuffs,'' she said.
	   Ms. Woodward, the first British woman to be tried on live TV,
returned home June 18 after a Massachusetts court upheld her
conviction of involuntary manslaughter in the death of 8-month-old
Matthew Eappen. He died of head injuries in February 1997 while in
her care.
	   Since returning to Britain she has given only one TV interview,
promised not to sell her story, and _ until Monday's appearance at
the Edinburgh International Television Festival _ disappeared from
public view.

Deadline passes for West Bank troop withdrawal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Monday marked another missed deadline in the
much maligned Israel-Palestinian peace process, with Israel failing
to carry out a set of three West Bank troop withdrawals it promised
to complete by now.
	   The two sides are still haggling over the details of the second
of three pullbacks agreed to in a U.S. sponsored deal signed in
January 1997.
	   The wording in the accord called for the completion of the
pullbacks by mid-1998, which the United States interpreted as the
end of August, 1998.
	   Even as the deadline passed, Israeli officials voiced optimism
that the gaps have narrowed in a deal which would turn over another
13.1 percent of the West Bank to Palestinian control. But,
Palestinians said that agreement on the scope of the second
withdrawal remained far from reach.
	   ``There are still big differences,'' Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat said Monday after returning from talks with Jordan's Crown
Prince Hassan in Amman.
	   Israeli officials blamed the delay in executing any of the
scheduled pullbacks on Palestinian failure to carry out the
promises it made in the 1997 deal including a concentrated
crackdown on terrorism.
	   ``This was supposed to be the third redeployment, the end of the
period of redeployments,'' said David Bar-Illan, a senior aide to
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. ``The significance of this is
that the Palestinians have persistently and consistently refused to
commit themselves in concrete terms to what they are obligated to
do,'' he said.
	   None of the pullbacks Israel promised have been carried out.
Last spring, Netanyahu's Cabinet agreed to hand over 2 percent of
West Bank territory in a first pullback but the Palestinians
rejected the offer as too small. Shortly afterwards, negotiations
between the sides froze over Israeli settlement construction.
	   The United States, in an effort to save the process, jumped in
and mediated between the sides, eventually submitting a proposal
for a second redeployment. The Palestinians accepted the ideas but
Israel wants to change the plan to better suit its security needs
by turning 3 percent of the area into a nature reserve which would
limit Palestinian control there.
	   Bar-Illan told The Associated Press Monday that Israel has
``acceded to the American suggestion of 13 percent provided that
there is a difference between the 3 percent and the 10 percent.''
	   It was not clear what would happen to a third redeployment.
Netanyahu had wanted to incorporate a third withdrawal into future
talks on a final peace deal.
	   But Ariel Sharon, a powerful minister in Netanyahu's Security
Cabinet said last week that Israel was discussing handing over an
additional 1 percent of West Bank land in the third redeployment,
giving Arafat control over a total of 41 percent of the West Bank.
	   Israel captured the West Bank, home to 1.6 million Palestinians,
from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast war and the Palestinians want it
for a future state.
	   In Israel, Monday's deadline was noted in passing by only one
newspaper and radio shows ignored the topic altogether, signalling
a certain apathy among the Israeli public in the face of a process
marred by violence and deadlock.
	   Palestinian lawmaker Hassan Asfour shrugged off the significance
of peace-making deadlines saying the time has long passed since any
importance was attributed to them.
	   ``It's another missed deadline. Nobody expected for it to be
concluded anyway due to the mentality of this (Israeli)
government.''
	   Bar-Illan said a new deal for redeployment could be signed if
the Palestinians undertook the security guarantees it made in
earlier accords.
	   ``The delay in the peace process is very discouraging but
nevertheless we are not losing hope that it can be salvaged,''
Bar-Illan said.

<TEXT>
	   VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) _ A Lithuanian helicopter carrying
wedding guests on an excursion crashed in a lake, killing 10 people
including the parents of the bride and groom.
	   A 32-year-old woman survived the crash, but was in critical
condition, the Baltic News Service reported Monday.
	   The Sunday evening crash occurred at Lake Plateliai, about 300
kilometers (180 miles) weast of Vilnius, the capital.
	   Helicopter sightseeing is popular in the region and Edita
Ziurlyte and Saulius Rancas had rented the helicopter as a treat
for their wedding guests.
	   The cause of the crash of the Soviet-made MI-2 helicopter was
not immediately known. It sank in about 15 meters (50 feet of
water).
	   BNS said that model of helicopter, which was carrying 11 people,
is designed to carry a maximum of eight people.

UCI calls for tough sanctions from national bodies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ The International Cycling Union on
Monday urged national federations to be tough with cyclists kicked
out of the Tour de France for using banned substances.
	   Following a meeting in Bordeaux, the UCI informed the
Australian, French and Swiss cycling federations, which all had
riders implicated in the drug-marred Tour de France last June, they
had until September 13 to decide on santions.
	   With the possiblility that various national federations may mete
out different penalties, the UCI wishes to review the sanctions and
ensure consistency.
	   The riders involved were all part of the Festina team, kicked
out of the French Tour after banned substances were found in a team
car by police shortly before the start of the first stage in
Dublin, Ireland.
	   Team officials later admitted to the systematic use of the
banned substances among its riders. The confession resulted in the
Festina riders' expulsion. The cyclists included France's Richard
Virenque, and Swiss riders Alex Zuelle and Laurent Dufaux.
	   While anti-doping regulations call for suspensions from six to
12 months, the UCI reminded the federations of the seriousness of
the offense and asked that the considerable evidence against the
cyclists be taken into account when handing out sanctions.
	   Other topics discussed at the meeting included complaints about
security following the Swiss Grand Prix last week.
	   The UCI said the event would only conserve its Grand Prix status
in 1999, if organizers supplied guarantees regarding safety, in
association with Swiss police and gendarmes by October 1, 1998.
	   At the Grand Prix race last week in Zurich, a security
motorcycle whizzed across the velodrome track just two meters in
front of racers in their final sprint to the finishline.

Albright finds Bosnia on positive path
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with details of meeting with Clark, Primakov, recasts &QL; 
 &UR; By BARRY SCHWEID &QC; 
 &UR; AP Diplomatic Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright affirmed U.S. opposition to further divisions in Bosnia
and declared the war-torn country was on its way to peace and a
normal life.
	   ``There will be no revision of the Dayton Accords,'' Albright
said Monday in a clear rebuff to lingering Serb and Croat sentiment
to partition Bosnia.
	   She affirmed the United States would provide assistance only to
those leaders who support the 1995 Dayton agreement, which provides
for two separate entities, one Serb and the other under
Croat-Muslim control, but with an overarching national government
and Sarajevo envisaged as an open and diverse capital.
	   In Bosnia, and earlier in Croatia, Albright called for a
stepped-up return of refugees who fled during the 3 1/2-year war
and a loosening of restrictions on the news media.
	   There is some rebuilding in Bosnia, assisted by U.S. and other
contributions, but large areas of Sarajevo remain blighted with
rubble and bombed-out homes and shops.
	   The German manufacturer, Volkswagen, formally resumed auto
production Monday in Sarajevo and German Foreign Minister Klaus
Kinkel is visiting to mark the occasion.
	   Albright, at a news conference, said the city ``looks more
normal'' since her visit in May 1997. ``It has achieved peace,''
she said. ``Now it is important that the people get what they had
before the war, security and the right to travel.''
	   She met with Alija Izetbegovic and Kresimir Zubak, the Muslim
and Croat presidents in a three-way power-sharing arrangement. The
Serb, Momcilo Krajisnik, was pointedly shunned.
	   ``Those who support Dayton are the ones to carry this country
into the new century,'' Albright said.
	   In the national elections that will be held in two weeks, the
United States is supporting Serbs in Bosnia considered more amiable
than Krajisnik.
	   Izetbegovic said he told Albright some changes in administration
and the judicial system were needed, as well as a better
arrangement for border police to guard against terrorist
infiltrators. Zubak called separately for equal access to the media
for Bosnia Croats.
	   Croatian and Muslim forces, by uniting, were able to beat back
Serb rebels and fight them to a standoff in the war, setting the
stage for the peace accords the United States engineered in talks
near Dayton, Ohio.
	   But some Croatians have not lost their appetite for a ``greater
Croatia,'' one that at least would have tied parts of Bosnia to
neighboring Croatia or possibly annex them.
	   The accords set up a central government and two republics _ one
Serb and the other a combined Muslim-Croat enclave.
	   Before flying to Moscow to join President Bill Clinton at summit
talks, Albright met with the NATO commander, Gen. Wesley Clark, to
accelerate contingency plans for an attack on Serb forces in the
embattled Yugoslav province of Kosovo.
	   After the meeting, James Foley, the deputy State Department
spokesman, said use of force remains a viable option,''
particularly as winter looms and thousands of refugees remain under
Serb pressure.
	   He said Clark briefed Albright on what roles various NATO
nations would assume in the event of an attack.
	   To size up the situation in Russia, Albright had dinner with the
Russian foreign minister, Yevgeny Primakov.

Russia insists WTO membership bid on course despite crisis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Russia-Economy, World Markets &QL; 
 &UR; By PHILIP WALLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Russia remains on course to join the World Trade
Organization despite the economic chaos ravaging the country, a
Russian official said Monday.
	   Talks with other governments about Russian membership were held
last month in Geneva and the process is continuing, he said.
	   ``We are looking forward to joining this organization,'' the
official, based at the Russian mission to international
organizations in Geneva, said on condition of anonymity. ``I think
there is no change.''
	   Also Monday, WTO Director-General Renato Ruggiero said countries
risk plunging themselves and others into crisis if they try to
limit the turmoil's impact by slamming the door on foreign imports.
	   After stock markets in Asia, Europe and the Americas plummeted
last week following Russia's economic and political upheaval, fears
have risen about the possible knock-on effect on Western economies.
	   ``Anything involving protectionist measures would lead to the
worst possible situation,'' former Italian trade diplomat Ruggiero
was quoted by his spokesman Keith Rockwell as saying.
	   In a speech in January this year, Ruggiero made clear his desire
to see Russia admitted to the WTO, saying it would give the global
trading system a stable foundation, particularly during periods of
economic stress.
	   Russia has expressed its desire to join, but faces the
difficulty of bringing its formerly centrally planned economy into
line with the trade body's free market rules.
	   The increased problems that Russia's current crisis could heap
on its membership bid were highlighted Monday by comments from the
European executive commission.
	   Lousewies van der Laan, Brussels-based spokeswoman for EU
Foreign Affairs Commissioner Hans van den Broek, said Russia hadn't
met certain conditions for joining the WTO.
	   A formal application for membership has yet to be made. When
asked about prospects for such a move soon, van der Laan replied:
``Things are a little bit stuck at the moment.''
	   Despite Ruggiero's warning, WTO officials say there has been
little indication so far that countries facing problems are
resorting to protectionist measures to stave off effects of the
turmoil. ``We are pleased there hasn't been a knee-jerk reaction,''
Rockwell said.
	   The WTO will continue to monitor the situation to ensure
governments adhere to their obligations under WTO agreements, he
added.

Belarus' Lukashenko calls for closer union with Russia, Ukraine
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ President Alexander Lukashenko on Monday
again called for a closer union between Belarus, Russia and
Ukraine, saying it would help the former Soviet republics overcome
the current crisis.
	   Lukashenko, an authoritarian leader openly nostalgic for the
Soviet Union, is eager for a close union between the three Slavic
nations and is using Russia's economic crisis to push his goal.
	   But Ukraine, like most former Soviet republics, has shown no
interest in a reunion with Russia.
	   ``A situation has developed now that is pushing the republics _
above all Belarus, Ukraine and Russia _ to take even more decisive
steps aimed at a closer integration,'' Lukashenko told reporters.
	   ``If we do not take these steps we will commit another crime _ I
stress, a crime,'' he said.
	   Belarus and Ukraine have suffered most heavily among other
former Soviet republics from the recent sharp fall of the Russian
ruble and turmoil in the country's financial markets.
	   Ukraine's hryvna currency and Belarusian ruble are continuing to
decline in response to the Russian ruble's fall.
	   Lukashenko, who favors a Soviet-style command economy, has
praised the dismissal a week ago of Russia's former Prime Minister
Sergei Kiriyenko, saying he ``could not accept'' Kiriyenko's
policies.
	   He refrained from direct comment on the re-appointment of Viktor
Chernomyrdin to head the Russian government, but called the dispute
between the Kremlin and parliament over the nomination as ``a
typical political psychosis.''
	   Russia and Belarus have signed a union treaty that pledged
closer cooperation in most areas but stopped well short of creating
a single state.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ About 200 angry Serb women pelted
the U.S. information office with stones Monday to protest the
killing of Serb civilians, allegedly by Albanian rebels fighting
for independence of the Kosovo province.
	   Allegations of abuse by both Serb forces and Albanian guerrillas
escalated over the weekend after Serbian police said they had
discovered a crematory in the village of Klecka, where ethnic
Albanians allegedly had burned the bodies of at least 22 Serbs,
including women and children.
	   The rebel Kosovo Liberation Army has denied any role in the
killings.
	   President Bill Clinton's special envoy on war crimes issues told
reporters Monday in the Croatian capital Zagreb that the Yugoslav
government refused to let him investigate alleged abuses in Kosovo,
including ``alleged criminal conduct'' by Albanian rebels and Serb
security forces.
	   The envoy, David Scheffer, said Belgrade's refusal to grant him
a visa ``indicates once again that government's insecurity about
its own accountability under international laws.''
	   Hundreds of people have been killed on both sides, and more than
260,000 have been rendered homeless by the fighting. Western
government have threatened to use force against the Serbs to stop
the offensive, but have yet to follow through.
	   On Monday, about 200 Serb women marched to the U.S. Information
Service in Pristina and demanded that an American official come
speak to them. When no one responded, the women shouted
``fascists'' and ``murderers'' and began hurling stones at the
building.
	   ``This is Serbia,'' shouted one of the women. ``Look at them,
high and mighty democrats! They can't come out and talk to us. They
only want to talk to (ethnic) Albanian politicians!''
	   Serb officials have accused the United States and international
agencies of favoring the Albanians, who compromise 90 percent of
Kosovo's 2 million inhabitants.
	   Despite appeals by a security guard, the women shook the iron
fence around the compound for a few moments and then marched off
toward the offices of the International Committee of the Red Cross,
where they threw stones, talked to an official and then physically
attacked an ethnic Albanian security guard.
	   Nick Summer, the ICRC official, said the Red Cross was doing all
it can to get in touch with all those who can provide any
information on missing persons, including the 22 Serbs allegedly
killed and cremated by the rebels.
	   Summer said the Red Cross helps all civilians in need,
regardless of ethnicity. Dissatisfied, the women outside tried to
break down the gate and demolished part of the fence.
	   Meanwhile, Vladam Batic, a lawyer and leader of a minor Serbian
opposition party, sued Adem Demaci, a spokesman for the rebel
Kosovo Liberation Army, accusing him of armed rebellion, terrorism
and genocide. But it was not clear if a prosecutor would indict
Demaci.

Deadline passes for West Bank troop withdrawal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with deadline on redeployment deal
passing; fresh quotes, background, changes byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By DINA KRAFT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Monday marked another missed deadline in the
much maligned Israel-Palestinian peace process, with Israel failing
to carry out a set of three West Bank troop withdrawals it promised
to complete by now.
	   The two sides are still haggling over the details of the second
of three pullbacks agreed to in a U.S. sponsored deal signed in
January 1997.
	   The wording in the accord called for the completion of the
pullbacks by mid-1998, which the United States interpreted as the
end of August, 1998.
	   Even as the deadline passed, Israeli officials voiced optimism
that the gaps have narrowed in a deal which would turn over another
13.1 percent of the West Bank to Palestinian control. But,
Palestinians said that agreement on the scope of the second
withdrawal remained far from reach.
	   ``There are still big differences,'' Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat said Monday after returning from talks with Jordan's Crown
Prince Hassan in Amman.
	   Israeli officials blamed the delay in executing any of the
scheduled pullbacks on Palestinian failure to carry out the
promises it made in the 1997 deal including a concentrated
crackdown on terrorism.
	   ``This was supposed to be the third redeployment, the end of the
period of redeployments,'' said David Bar-Illan, a senior aide to
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. ``The significance of this is
that the Palestinians have persistently and consistently refused to
commit themselves in concrete terms to what they are obligated to
do,'' he said.
	   None of the pullbacks Israel promised have been carried out.
Last spring, Netanyahu's Cabinet agreed to hand over 2 percent of
West Bank territory in a first pullback but the Palestinians
rejected the offer as too small. Shortly afterwards, negotiations
between the sides froze over Israeli settlement construction.
	   The United States, in an effort to save the process, jumped in
and mediated between the sides, eventually submitting a proposal
for a second redeployment. The Palestinians accepted the ideas but
Israel wants to change the plan to better suit its security needs
by turning 3 percent of the area into a nature reserve which would
limit Palestinian control there.
	   Bar-Illan told The Associated Press on Monday that Israel has
``acceded to the American suggestion of 13 percent provided that
there is a difference between the 3 percent and the 10 percent.''
	   It was not clear what would happen to a third redeployment.
Netanyahu had wanted to incorporate a third withdrawal into future
talks on a final peace deal.
	   But Ariel Sharon, a powerful minister in Netanyahu's Security
Cabinet said last week that Israel was discussing handing over an
additional 1 percent of West Bank land in the third redeployment,
giving Arafat control over a total of 41 percent of the West Bank.
	   Israel captured the West Bank, home to 1.6 million Palestinians,
from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast war and the Palestinians want it
for a future state.
	   Palestinian lawmaker Hassan Asfour shrugged off the significance
of peacemaking deadlines.
	   ``It's another missed deadline. Nobody expected for it to be
concluded anyway due to the mentality of this (Israeli)
government.''
	   Bar-Illan said a new deal for redeployment could be signed if
the Palestinians undertook the security guarantees it made in
earlier accords.
	   ``The delay in the peace process is very discouraging but
nevertheless we are not losing hope that it can be salvaged,''
Bar-Illan said.

European Council leader visits Caucasus nations
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YEREVAN, Armenia (AP) _ A top Council of Europe official visited
three Caucasus nations on Monday to discuss their potential
membership in the 40-member group.
	   ``We hope that Armenia will become a full member of the Council
of Europe,'' said Daniel Tarschys, secretary general of the
Strasbourg, France-based European body, after meeting with Armenian
President Robert Kocharian.
	   Tarschys and Kocharian also discussed problems in
Nagorno-Karabakh, a pocket of Azerbaijan that is populated largely
by ethnic Armenians. It declared independence in 1988 and drove
Azerbaijani troops out with Armenia's help.
	   Other members of the Council of Europe delegation added support
for including Armenia, as well as Georgia and Azerbaijan, in the
Council of Europe.
	   ``All three countries must become members of the European
family,'' said Greek Deputy Foreign Minister Yannos Kranidiotis.
``We highly appreciate the progress Armenia has reached in all
spheres.''
	   The council is best known for its European Convention on Human
Rights. Over the years, however, the activities of the council have
been overshadowed by the more powerful European Union, which is
based in Brussels, Belgium.

In swift and brutal justice, two Palestinians executed
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Arafat visit to family &QL; 
 &UR; By KARIN LAUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Three days after the crime _ the slayings of
two Palestinian policemen _ the two suspects had been tried,
sentenced and put to death by a firing squad.
	   The execution _ the first ordered by Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat _ drew outrage from Palestinian human rights activists who
said Monday they feared it could pave the way for other abuses.
	   However, most Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip
appeared to support Arafat's actions.
	   The convicted killers were themselves Palestinian security
officers engaged in a longstanding feud with a rival clan.
	   The crime was seen as a prime example of a growing problem _
members of Arafat's 40,000 strong security force abusing their
power to settle personal scores.
	   Sunday's execution in the courtyard of the Gaza City central
jail was witnessed by more than 500 people, including Palestinian
Cabinet ministers, legislators and members of Arafat's Fatah
faction.
	   The condemned men, brothers Mohammed and Raed Abu Sultan, 25 and
24 respectively, were led into the yard blindfolded at about 2:30
p.m. and ordered to stand up against the back wall.
	   The two men, shaking and unable to stand up without support,
pleaded for mercy and were forced to listen to a slow count from 1
to 10 before 10 policemen in black hoods opened fire on them, said
witness Sami Awadah, a Fatah member.
	   When the volley of shots ran out, many in the crowd shouted
``Allahu Akbar,'' or ``God is Great,'' as a sign of approval.
	   The Palestinian human rights groups Al Haq and Mandela Institute
said Arafat was responding to public pressure when he ordered the
executions. The victims, brothers Majdi Khaldi, 32, and Mohammed
Khaldi, 30, were Fatah activists from a prominent family and there
was fear the blood feud would continue.
	   ``We believe Arafat's approval came in response to the mood of
he people of Gaza,'' the two groups said in a statement. ``There
was not enought time for those who committed the crime to defend
themselves.''
	   Arafat and high ranking Palestinian commanders paid a condolence
call to the Khaldi family home later Monday, where close to 1,000
people had gathered to pay respects.

Armenian school year begins late because of heat wave
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YEREVAN, Armenia (AP) _ The school year in the Armenian capital
will begin a week late because of a heat wave that has kept Yerevan
sizzling, the Education Ministry said Monday.
	   Temperatures in Yerevan have been over 40 degrees Celsius (104
degrees Fahrenheit) for the past week.
	   Weather officials said that the heat wave, Armenia's worst in a
hundred years, should subside in several days. The school year will
start on Sept. 7 rather than on the traditional date of Sept. 1.

Lawmakers' rejection of Chernomyrdin extends Russia's crisis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. RECASTS and UPDATES with Yeltsin nominating Chernomyrdin
again, Chernomyrdin saying he will go ahead with new Cabinet, more
quotes, analysison of a
government to tackle the country's economic and political tailspin.

<TEXT>
	   The lopsided vote against confirming Viktor Chernomyrdin deepens
a dangerous deadlock between the president and the Parliament and
leaves Russia in chaos as U.S. President Clinton arrives Tuesday
for an ill-timed summit.
	   Russia has been without a government since Aug. 23, when Yeltsin
fired Prime Minister Sergei Kiryenko in the midst of an economic
crisis that has crippled the ruble and stocks, threatened to bring
down its banking and financial system and sent an earthquake
through world markets.
	   There was no sign of panic in Moscow and other cities Monday.
The ruble rate continued to improve modestly in street trading,
although official trading was suspended for a fourth day.
	   Yeltsin resubmitted Chernomyrdin's candidacy to the State Duma,
Parliament's lower house, immediately after the vote _ calling
lawmakers' bluff and showing his determination to stick with his
former premier.
	   But Monday's 251-94 vote and deputies' vitrolic comments made it
doubtful that Chernomyrdin could ever be approved.
	   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov called proposing
Chernomyrdin's candidacy again ``a slap in the face to the whole
nation.''
	   Unless Yeltsin or the Duma backs down, Russia could face
parliamentary elections late this year in order to break the
stalemate and form a new government to settle the turmoil.
	   The president can make three nominations in all, with at least a
week's interval required between the votes. But if he is rejected
three times, he is required by the constitution to dismiss the Duma
and call new elections within three months.
	   Some Communist leaders said they were not afraid of government
threats to dissolve the legislature because they are confident of
winning the elections that would follow _ a view analysts don't
necessarily share.
	   Over the weekend, it appeared Chernomyrdin would win quick
approval after government and opposition leaders reached tentative
agreement on a power-sharing pact. But the Communists later said
they couldn't trust Yeltsin to keep to the agreement, and on Monday
they demanded his resignation.
	   Before the vote, Chernomyrdin pleaded with lawmakers to approve
forming a government to tackle the crisis.
	   ``Russia is on the verge of political and economic collapse,''
he said. ``We can only come out of the crisis by uniting our
efforts.''
	   He told the Duma the government would take urgent steps to prop
up banks and protect individuals' accounts. He also called for a
program to prop up the ruble, lower taxes and revive the industrial
sector, but gave no details.
	   Zyuganov agreed that the failure to reach an agreement in
parliament could be catastrophic _ ``everything may spill into the
streets.''
	   But deputies said they could not bring back a man who oversaw
failed policies from 1992 until he was fired last spring.
	   Zyuganov said Chernomyrdin was responsible for many of Russia's
current problems, and liberal Yabloko faction leader Grigory
Yavlinsky accused him of creating ``a semi-criminal economic
system.''
	   ``It was during his years that Russia became the world leader in
corruption,'' the reformist Yavlinsky said. ``You ask any kid
what's the problem with the government and the answer will be:
`They are thieves.'''
	   In a final plea, Chernomyrdin admitted that ``I have made many
mistakes.'' But he said some of the accusations against him were
false, and stressed that he disagreed with the previous
government's decision to devalue the ruble, restructure state debt
and impose a 90-day moratorium on paying off debts.
	   ``Everything we did during the week, everything we have agreed
on _ all that was suddenly destroyed,'' Chernomyrdin said bitterly.
	   Parliamentary leaders agreed afterward to hold talks Tuesday to
draw up a list of possible candidates for prime minister to submit
to Yeltsin.
	   Clinton is to be greeted on his arrival by Chernomyrdin before
heading to the Kremlin later for talks with Yeltsin.
	   Hours before his departure, Clinton pledged continued U.S.
support for Russia so long as its leaders ``stay on the path of
reform'' and do not revert to the communist ways of its past.
	   ``The Russian people are to be commended for embracing democracy
and getting rid of the old communist system, but they're having
some troubles today making the transition from communism to a
free-market economy,'' he said.
	   Chernomyrdin, meanwhile, said that as acting premier he would
take steps to pay back wages to the military, coal miners and
students. He also said he would submit his Cabinet proposals on
Tuesday to Yeltsin.
	   ``No matter what, I must make decisions because life goes on,''
he said. ``A state cannot live without government.''

New book claims to reveal Anne Frank's betrayer
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: INSERTS new 12th graf to ADD that maid wasn't a Nazi
sympathizer but feared her husband,son might lose jobs if she
didn't come forward. &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photo NY90 &QL; 
 &UR; By WILLIAM J. KOLE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ A new biography of Anne Frank
contends her mysterious betrayer was the woman who cleaned the
building where the young Jewish diarist and her family hid from the
Nazis.
	   In ``Anne Frank,'' due in bookstores next week, Austrian
biographer Melissa Muller cites evidence she unearthed in German
and Dutch archives to support her theory that the long sought-after
informant was maid Lena Hartog.
	   Scholars reacted cautiously Monday to Muller's conclusion,
saying the betrayer's identity may never be known for sure because
the key players and known witnesses _ Hartog among them _ are long
dead.
	   ``I'm not convinced,'' said Peter Romijn of the Netherlands
State Institute for War Documentation, which compiles the
internationally best-selling ``Diary of Anne Frank.''
	   ``The evidence is largely circumstantial,'' he said, but added:
``It deserves at least more research and consideration on our
part.''
	   World War II researchers long have debated the chain of events
that culminated in the Aug. 4, 1944, raid on the Franks' secret
annex, tucked behind a movable bookcase in an Amsterdam canal
house.
	   Tipped off by an anonymous phone call, German agents burst
inside and hauled the Franks away to concentration camps. Anne died
of typhus in the Bergen-Belsen camp in the spring of 1945, just
weeks before it was liberated.
	   Hartog, who died in 1963, has been the subject of speculation
before. A year before the betrayal, the war documentation center
says, she confided to another woman that she thought Jews were
being hidden in the building.
	   But researchers have focused mainly on Willem van Maaren, the
man who ran the warehouse in the building in which the Franks had
sought refuge. Those in charge of sneaking food to the Franks said
in interviews after the war they were always afraid that Van Maaren
_ a man known as a snoop _ would realize what they were up to.
	   Muller, 30, claims that new evidence strongly suggests it was
Hartog who blew the whistle. Her claim is based, she says, on
archive records and interviews with a distant cousin of Hartog.
	   ``I'm not saying I'm sure she did it. It would be presumptuous
to say I've found the traitor,'' Muller told the daily NRC
Handelsblad. ``But there are so many clues which should at least
have been enough for the police to bring Lena Hartog before a judge
and examine this more carefully.''
	   Muller's explanation seems plausible enough: Hartog was no Nazi
sympathizer, but was worried that her husband and son might lose
their jobs and face arrest if she didn't come forward with her
suspicions.
	   The book, written in German and published by Klaassen Verlag,
has been translated into English by New York-based Metropolitan
Books for publication in Britain and the United States. It hits
bookstores on Sept. 7, coinciding with the recent fuss over the
discovery of five more pages to Anne's famed diary.
	   The Anne Frank Foundation, which has turned the secret annex
into a popular museum, points out that Anne herself wrote about the
anguish of making unwanted noise that outsiders easily could have
heard.
	   Early in hiding, she wrote of how a sack of beans had burst open
and ``the noise was enough to wake the dead.'' Later, she wrote of
the ``slamming of doors'' and ``incessant shouting.''
	   ``It's possible that the Franks weren't careful enough _ that
they gave themselves away,'' said foundation spokeswoman Ita
Amahorseija.

Russia's leaders fight over power and ideology while crisis grows
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; An AP News Analysis &QL; 
 &UR; By BARRY RENFREW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ With Russia facing potential chaos, the country's
political factions are locked in a bitter ideological and power
struggle rather than coming up with concrete steps to solve the
crisis.
	   While most Russians desperately wait for quick, practical fixes,
their political leaders refuse to make concessions or work
together. Instead, the rival parties are bogged down in a battle
that has been running for years over what kind of political and
economic system Russia should have.
	   Most politicians and ordinary Russians are convinced Boris
Yeltsin cannot rescue Russia from its present crisis. But the rival
political groups are not offering any practical solutions or
alternatives.
	   On the one side are communists and nationalists in parliament
who want to revive the Soviet past, restore state political and
economic controls and revive Russia as a global power. But the
Soviet Union collapsed in failure, and while many Russians want
more stability, they don't want a return to the authoritarian past.
	   On the other side are moderates and centrists who want a
democratic society and market economy. But they are divided among
themselves and as power-hungry as their hard-line opponents.
	   In the middle is Yeltsin, increasingly out of touch with the
situation, but retaining enormous power and refusing to compromise
with his opponents on all sides. Yeltsin backs democracy and
reform, but repeatedly has failed to push through real changes.
	   Yeltsin's plan to reappoint Viktor Chernomyrdin as prime
minister brought swift condemnation from parties across the
political spectrum. Chernomyrdin is blamed by many for creating
Russia's current problems during his previous six years in the
post.
	   The Duma, the lower house of parliament, decisively rejected
Chernomyrdin's confirmation Monday in hearings in which almost
every party denounced him as a discredited failure.
	   A major problem in Russia is a lack of politicians and
administrators who know how to run a modern political and economic
state. The ruling elite is packed with elderly Soviet-era
functionaries who have presided over Russia's decline with little
idea of how to stop it.
	   Corruption and incompetence are endemic at every level of
government. Nothing can improve until the corruption is cleaned up,
but there is no sign of the government even starting to tackle it.
Nor can a new class of honest, capable administrators and
politicians be produced in just a few years.
	   Yeltsin may still succeed in having Chernomyrdin or another
candidate approved by the Duma. But the chances of the Yeltsin camp
fixing Russia's problems and turning the country around seem
increasingly remote.
	   An impasse may mean new parliamentary elections if Yeltsin
dissolves the Duma. That would probably mean the election of an
even more left-wing, anti-Yeltsin parliament because so many
Russians are angry about how miserable their lives have become.
	   And that will mean just more, increasingly dangerous conflict.

<TEXT>
	   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) _ A committee of nonaligned nations
has called for an investigation into U.S. missile strikes on a
Sudanese factory, bolstering a similar demand by Sudan.
	   Sudan's Foreign Minister Mustafa Osman Ismail welcomed the
committee resolution Monday as ``a step forward to introduce
justice,'' he told The Associated Press.
	   The U.S. missile strikes Aug. 20 on targets in Sudan and
Afghanistan _ a reprisal for the bombings of two U.S. embassies in
Africa _ were a hot issue Monday at a summit of the Nonaligned
Movement.
	   A committee on Sunday called for an independent investigation
into whether the Sudanese factory was a chemical weapons plant, as
Washington claims, or a pharmaceutical factory, as Sudan maintains.
	   The resolution reportedly also condemns the U.S. attack, though
the precise wording was unavailable because the meetings are
confidential and no transcript was released to the media.
	   The recommendation was being considered by foreign ministers at
the summit Monday and Tuesday. If they approve the measure, it will
go to heads of state, who start meeting Wednesday.
	   Sudan's foreign minister said Monday that if Washington
acknowledged an error in bombing the Khartoum factory, Sudan was
prepared ``to turn the page'' and move on.
	   Ismail said earlier that Sudan would not respond with an attack
for the bombing but would use forums like the nonaligned movement
and the United Nations. He said Sudan could seek a hearing at the
International Court of Justice in The Hague, Netherlands.
	   There was no immediate reaction to Sunday's resolution from the
United States' first official observer to the summit, diplomat
Princeton Lyman.
	   The Nonaligned Movement's 12th summit is pulling together an
expected 52 heads of state and representatives of about 100
nations. Formed during the height of the Cold War to fend off
domination by the White House and the Kremlin, the movement is now
struggling to define a new role.
	   South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki said the Nonaligned
Movement should advance the cause of the poor.
	   ``The new God of our world, the market, is not informed by a
tablet of commandments on which is inscribed: `Thou shalt banish
poverty in the world.'''
	   Other summit topics include the war in Congo, in which rebels
allegedly supported by Rwanda and Uganda are fighting President
Laurent Kabila's forces, which are backed by soldiers from Angola,
Zimbabwe and Namibia.
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan planned to arrive Tuesday and
meet at the summit with regional leaders on the Congo crisis.
	   Kabila was not likely to attend.
	   The summit has also seen much collective hand-wringing over
Russia's financial problems and their effect on emerging market
economies.
	   Delegates from India and Pakistan said they hoped to hold
bilateral talks on the recent nuclear arms testing by both
countries.

At least four Israelis wounded in Jerusalem shooting
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ At least four Israelis were shot, one possibly
fatally, at a soft drinks factory on the outskirts of Jerusalem,
police and emergency services said Monday.
	   Jerusalem police spokesman Shmuel Ben-Ruby said that initial
indications were that the shooting was the result of ``a business
dispute.'' He said the shooter was a woman and had been taken into
custody at the scene.
	   Ben-Ruby said four people had been shot and that one person was
in critical condition.
	   But Israel's Magen David Adom ambulance service, which was
called to the scene, said one person was killed in the shooting and
at least two others were in serious condition from gunshot wounds.

New book claims to reveal Anne Frank's betrayer
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with new 12th graf to ADD that maid wasn't a Nazi
sympathizer but feared her husband,son might lose jobs if she
didn't come forward. &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photo NY90 &QL; 
 &UR; By WILLIAM J. KOLE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ A new biography of Anne Frank
contends her mysterious betrayer was the woman who cleaned the
building where the young Jewish diarist and her family hid from the
Nazis.
	   In ``Anne Frank,'' due in bookstores next week, Austrian
biographer Melissa Muller cites evidence she unearthed in German
and Dutch archives to support her theory that the long sought-after
informant was maid Lena Hartog.
	   Scholars reacted cautiously Monday to Muller's conclusion,
saying the betrayer's identity may never be known for sure because
the key players and known witnesses _ Hartog among them _ are long
dead.
	   ``I'm not convinced,'' said Peter Romijn of the Netherlands
State Institute for War Documentation, which compiles the
internationally best-selling ``Diary of Anne Frank.''
	   ``The evidence is largely circumstantial,'' he said, but added:
``It deserves at least more research and consideration on our
part.''
	   World War II researchers long have debated the chain of events
that culminated in the Aug. 4, 1944, raid on the Franks' secret
annex, tucked behind a movable bookcase in an Amsterdam canal
house.
	   Tipped off by an anonymous phone call, German agents burst
inside and hauled the Franks away to concentration camps. Anne died
of typhus in the Bergen-Belsen camp in the spring of 1945, just
weeks before it was liberated.
	   Hartog, who died in 1963, has been the subject of speculation
before. A year before the betrayal, the war documentation center
says, she confided to another woman that she thought Jews were
being hidden in the building.
	   But researchers have focused mainly on Willem van Maaren, the
man who ran the warehouse in the building in which the Franks had
sought refuge. Those in charge of sneaking food to the Franks said
in interviews after the war they were always afraid that Van Maaren
_ a man known as a snoop _ would realize what they were up to.
	   Muller, 30, claims that new evidence strongly suggests it was
Hartog who blew the whistle. Her claim is based, she says, on
archive records and interviews with a distant cousin of Hartog.
	   ``I'm not saying I'm sure she did it. It would be presumptuous
to say I've found the traitor,'' Muller told the daily NRC
Handelsblad. ``But there are so many clues which should at least
have been enough for the police to bring Lena Hartog before a judge
and examine this more carefully.''
	   Muller's explanation seems plausible enough: Hartog was not a
Nazi sympathizer, but she was worried that her husband and son
might lose their jobs and face arrest if she didn't come forward
with her suspicions.

German companies face class-action suits from Jewish groups
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES at bottom with government committee to monitor
restitution of Jewish property &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Fresh from concluding a billion-dollar
settlement with Swiss banks, Jewish organizations will decide soon
about filing class action suits against German companies that used
slave labor during World War II, a spokesman said Monday.
	   An official of a Jewish group pressing for compensation for
survivors of the Nazi Holocaust said the fact a U.S. lawyer has
already filed such a suit will not stop his organization from
pressing ahead with its own legal action.
	   ``We are at the beginning stages of research,'' said Yoram Dori,
spokesperson for the World Jewish Restitution Organization (WJRO).
He said a decision about the class-action suit would be made in
``weeks, not months.''
	   On Sunday, lawyer Ed Fagan filed a class action suit in New York
against several German companies. He represents Jews who were
forced to work in German factories during the war. Another lawyer
was expected to file a similar suit Monday.
	   Dori said the WJRO is going ahead with its plans. He said the
suits filed so far do not represent all the survivors.
	   The class-action suits refer to inmates in Nazi concentration
camps who were forced to work without pay for German companies
during World War II. The firms included leaders in German industry
like Volkswagen, Daimler, Krupp and others.
	   The aim would be to recover salaries that were not paid to the
workers, according to Dori.
	   The WJRO recently came to agreement with banks in Switzerland
about compensation to Holocaust survivors and heirs of victims who
deposited money in Swiss bank accounts before or during World War
II but were unable to withdraw the funds for lack of documentation.
The amount of the settlement was drls 1.25 billion.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called a meeting of
Jewish organization representatives Monday to head off possible
disputes over distribution of the money from the Swiss banks.
	   Dori said there were some technical disagreements among various
groups, but that he was sure they would be worked out.
	   Dori said the WJRO is opposed to having the Israeli government
handle the distribution. ``People everywhere are suspicious of
governments, and the Jews in Israel are no different,'' he said.
	   Following the meeting, Netanyahu's office issued a statement
that a special ministerial committee had been appointed to deal
with developments related to the restitution of Jewish property.
The committee will function in coordination with the WJRO, the
statement said.

Israeli ends first year of 15-year term in underwear spy case
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ An Israeli Arab is in ``rather good shape''
after completing the first year of a 15-year jail term for
allegedly spying on Egypt using women's underwear soaked in
invisible ink, the Israeli Embassy said Monday.
	   The case of Azam Azam, a member of the Israeli Druse minority,
stirred already tense relations between Egypt and Israel last year,
and drew wide interest because of its bizarre nature.
	   Egyptian prosecutors accused Azam of supplying women's underwear
coated with invisible ink to an Egyptian accomplice. The underwear
destined for Israel could allegedly be used for writing secret
messages about Egyptian factories and Egypt's treatment of its
citizens who had dealings with Israel's embassy in Cairo.
	   Israel denied Azam was a spy and said the case was fabricated.
Egypt rejected that and a court sentenced him last Aug. 31.
	   On Monday, Assad Assad, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's consultant on Druse affairs, and the Israeli Consul to
Egypt, Eli Levi, visited Azam at the maximum security al-Torah
prison, south of Cairo.
	   ``He is in a rather good shape. Not perfect, but rather good,''
Ayellet Yehiav, a spokeswoman for the Israeli embassy in Cairo,
said after the meeting that lasted 1 hour 50 minutes.
	   Azam complained of heart pains but was allowed to see a doctor
``so it seems like he is being treated,'' Yehiav said.

Iraq demands U.N. probe into UNSCOM affairs
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with letter delivered to Security Council president;
comments on Ritter by Iraqi officials &QL; 
 &UR; By MARIAM SAMI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq has demanded a U.N. investigation into
the operations of the U.N. disarmament commission, accusing it of
spying for the United States and Israel.
	   In a letter to the U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, Iraq said
the U.N. Special Commission takes its orders from the United States
and coordinates with Israel.
	   ``We call upon you, as well as the Security Council, to put an
end to this charade which goes on under the cover of the United
Nations and (Security) Council,'' said the Aug. 30 letter by Deputy
Prime Minister Tariq Aziz. It was delivered Monday to the Security
Council president.
	   Annan's office did not immediately respond while Israel called
Iraq's accusations ``propagandistic fantasies.''
	   Longstanding tensions between UNSCOM and Iraq came to a head
Aug. 5 when Iraq suspended cooperation with weapons inspectors.
UNSCOM then stopped new arms inspections.
	   In a related development, a prominent inspector, American Scott
Ritter, resigned from the commission last week saying the U.N. is
not doing enough to stop Iraq from producing and concealing
biological and chemical weapons.
	   In a program on Iraq's state television Monday, Iraqi officials
described their dealings with Ritter during the inspections, saying
he was intent on creating stand-offs.
	   Scott Ritter always insisted on visiting sensitive sites such as
the offices of security and intelligence departments, the
Republican Guards and presidential sites, said Hussam Mohammed
Amin, the director of the office that liaises with UNSCOM.
	   Once Ritter insisted on searching the department dealing with
Israel at the military intelligence directorate, Amin said.
	   In his 10-page letter, Aziz cited newspaper reports that U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told chief weapons inspector
Richard Butler to hold off inspecting certain cites to avoid
creating a stand-off with Iraq. Albright denied she interfered in
Butler's work.
	   Iraq accuses UNSCOM of deliberately prolonging its work of
identifying and destroying Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
Until UNSCOM certifies that Iraq is free of illegal weapons, the
Security Council will not lift the economic sanctions imposed after
Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   Iraq demands ``a serious investigation of all these facts,''
Aziz said in the letter, adding that the Special Commission should
be made ``an honest international body, not an intelligence unit
for a member country.''
	   ``We ask you as well as the Council, do you allow that an
apparatus attached to it coordinates with a party like Israel in
issues related to Iraq?'' the letter said. Aziz did not say if he
had any evidence to support that allegation.
	   Responding to the letter, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's spokesman David Bar-Illan said: ``It is another
regrettable condition of propagandistic fantasies'' being spread by
Iraq.
	   ``We hope that neither the U.S. nor the U.N. would be deterred
by such wild accusations and that the inspections will continue,''
he added.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A small crowd gathered Monday outside the tunnel
where Princess Diana met her end a year ago, but the mourners and
onlookers _ mostly tourists _ were nearly outnumbered by the TV
cameras.
	   Under the watchful eye of busloads of police, who clearly
expected a larger crowd, the 200 or so visitors to the Pont de
l'Alma bridge lit candles or stared at notes and floral tributes
left beside the Flame of Liberty, a statue that has become a
makeshift memorial to Diana.
	   The fresh bouquets of flowers covered layers of stale ones, and
they mixed with photos, pages from notebooks, ripped-out pictures
from magazines, the odd baby doll and a chocolate bar.
	   The Flame of Liberty, a replica of the torch on the Statue of
Liberty, was originally erected to honor French-American ties. But
because it sits just above the Alma traffic tunnel, it almost
immediately became a pilgrimage site.
	   A family from Brest, in the western French region of Brittany,
were among those paying their tributes to Diana on Monday.
	   ``(We're here) because she had a heart of gold,'' said Marie
Therese Jourdren. ``Because she was beautiful, kind. Because she
didn't deserve this.''
	   ``I've never bought flowers for any other public figure,'' said
Corinne Docherty, of Yorkshire, England, after laying a bouquet of
yellow buds at the statue. But ``it just wouldn't have seemed
right'' being in Paris and not paying respects, she said.

Ukrainian synagogue damaged by fire
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ One of Ukraine's largest synagogues was
damaged in a fierce fire early Monday morning in what Jewish
leaders suspect was an arson attack.
	   The fire in the sanctuary of the synagogue in the city of
Kharkiv began at 2 a.m. Monday morning and raged for several hours
before firefighters managed to put it out, said Kharkiv's chief
rabbi Moshe Moscowitz.
	   The sanctuary was under reconstruction and had no electric wires
or gas pipes, which makes investigators believe that the fire was
caused by arson, Moscowitz said.
	   ``An accident is very unlikely,'' he said.
	   The flames spread to the ceiling of the sanctuary, which is as
high as a five-story building, but the Torah scrolls were
undamaged, Moscowitz said.
	   Nobody has claimed responsibility for the attack, and police
were at the scene Monday to investigate.
	   Kharkiv is Ukraine's second-largest city and home to the
country's second-largest Jewish community, numbering more than
50,000 people.
	   ``We are most scared that Jewish people here would be afraid to
come to the synagogue,'' Moscowitz said.
	   Russia and Ukraine have seen several attacks on Jewish
cemeteries and synagogues in the past few years, but this was the
first such attack in Kharkiv, Moscowitz said
	   The Kharkiv synagogue was built around 1910, but shortly
afterwards converted into a sports stadium by the Soviet
government. It was returned to the Jewish community and was
reconsecrated as a synagogue in 1990, shortly before the Soviet
collapse, Moscowitz said.

Lawmakers' rejection of Chernomyrdin extends Russia's crisis

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Despite doomsday warnings that Russia faces
collapse, angry lawmakers on Monday emphatically rejected Boris
Yeltsin's candidate for prime minister, blocking the formation of a
government to try to pull the country out of its economic and
political tailspin.
	   The lopsided vote against confirming Viktor Chernomyrdin deepens
a dangerous deadlock between the president and the parliament and
leaves Russia in chaos as U.S. President Clinton arrives Tuesday
for an ill-timed summit.
	   Russia has been without a government since Aug. 23, when Yeltsin
fired Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko in the midst of an economic
crisis that has crippled the ruble and stocks, threatened to bring
down its banking and financial system and sent an earthquake
through world markets.
	   There was no sign of panic in Moscow and other cities Monday.
The ruble rate continued to improve modestly in street trading,
although official trading was suspended for a fourth day.
	   But the atmosphere in the State Duma was unusually bitter as
lawmakers assailed Chernomyrdin for Russia's woes. Deputy after
deputy gestured angrily as they condemned the acting premier,
filling the air with apocalyptic predictions about the country's
future. The stocky premier spoke condescendingly in response, then
fell glum when the ballots were cast.
	   Yeltsin resubmitted Chernomyrdin's candidacy to the Duma,
Parliament's lower house, immediately after the vote _ calling the
lawmakers' bluff and showing his determination to stick with his
former premier.
	   But Monday's 253-94 vote and deputies' vitriolic comments made
it doubtful that Chernomyrdin could ever be approved.
	   Gennady Zyuganov, the gravel-voiced Communist leader who glared
and spoke menacingly throughout Monday's session, afterward called
proposing Chernomyrdin's candidacy again ``a slap in the face to
the whole nation.''

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Arafat visit to family, graf 12. &QL; 
 &UR; By KARIN LAUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Three days after the crime _ the slayings of
two Palestinian policemen _ the two suspects had been tried,
sentenced and put to death by a firing squad.
	   The execution _ the first ordered by Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat _ drew outrage from Palestinian human rights activists who
said Monday they feared it could pave the way for other abuses.
	   However, most Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip
appeared to support Arafat's actions.
	   The convicted killers were themselves Palestinian security
officers engaged in a longstanding feud with a rival clan.
	   The crime was seen as a prime example of a growing problem _
members of Arafat's 40,000 strong security force abusing their
power to settle personal scores.
	   Sunday's execution in the courtyard of the Gaza City central
jail was witnessed by more than 500 people, including Palestinian
Cabinet ministers, legislators and members of Arafat's Fatah
faction.
	   The condemned men, brothers Mohammed and Raed Abu Sultan, 25 and
24 respectively, were led into the yard blindfolded at about 2:30
p.m. and ordered to stand up against the back wall.
	   The two men, shaking and unable to stand up without support,
pleaded for mercy and were forced to listen to a slow count from 1
to 10 before 10 policemen in black hoods opened fire on them, said
witness Sami Awadah, a Fatah member.
	   When the volley of shots ran out, many in the crowd shouted
``Allahu Akbar,'' or ``God is Great,'' as a sign of approval.
	   The Palestinian human rights groups Al Haq and Mandela Institute
said Arafat was responding to public pressure when he ordered the
executions. The victims, brothers Majdi Khaldi, 32, and Mohammed
Khaldi, 30, were Fatah activists from a prominent family and there
was fear the blood feud would continue.
	   ``We believe Arafat's approval came in response to the mood of
he people of Gaza,'' the two groups said in a statement. ``There
was not enough time for those who committed the crime to defend
themselves.''
	   Arafat and high ranking Palestinian commanders paid a condolence
call to the Khaldi family home later Monday, where close to 1,000
people had gathered to pay respects.

Claims by inspector strengthens Iraqi position, ambassador says
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Claims by a former U.N. weapons inspector
have hardened Iraq's position that inspectors were acting at the
behest of Washington in searching for suspected weapons sites,
Iraq's ambassador said Monday.
	   Nizar Hamdoon spoke to reporters after delivering a letter to
the Security Council president demanding an investigation into the
claims by the former inspector, Scott Ritter, and media reports
that Washington had interevened to call off searches.
	   After resigning last week, the former U.S. Marine captain
accused Washington of backing off its tough line against Baghdad by
urging less confrontational inspections of suspected weapons sites.
	   Hamdoon said Ritter's claims reinforced Iraq's belief that
Washington had undue influence over the U.N. Special Commission _
even though Ritter criticized Washington for not being forceful
enough with its influence.
	   ``I think it strengthens our position and our logic in
describing the way the work of UNSCOM was criticized,'' Hamdoon
said.
	   Media reports have said Washington intervened to call off
surprise searches, apparently fearing that it couldn't muster
support in the council for a tough response if Iraq blocked
inspectors _ more evidence, Hamdoon suggested, of the United
States' excessive influence.
	   The letter came as the council prepared to take up a
U.S.-British effort to suspend regular 60-day sanctions reviews
against Iraq to punish it for halting cooperation with inspectors.
	   U.S. officials said they hoped to get a resolution adopted this
week.
	   A draft resolution would suspend the reviews until after the
chief inspectors report ``that Iraq has fully resumed the
cooperation necessary for them to perform the full range of their
activities mandated under the relevant resolutions of the
council.''
	   Hamdoon dismissed the significance of the largely symbolic act,
saying previous reviews hadn't resulted in any easing of the
8-year-old sanctions, which bar sales of oil, Iraq's economic
mainstay, on the open market.
	   Arms experts must certify that Baghdad has destroyed its
long-range missiles and chemical, biological and nuclear weapons
before the council will lift sanctions imposed after Iraq invaded
Kuwait in 1990.
	   Iraq suspended cooperation with inspectors after the chief
weapons inspector, Richard Butler, refused earlier this month to
certify that Baghdad had destroyed its banned weapons.

 &UR; Corinthians vs. Uruguay, Tuesday.

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ Seeking its first Mercosur Cup win,
Corinthians, the undefeated leader of Brazil's national soccer
championship, meets Uruguay's Penarol this week.
	   Led by Wanderley Luxemburgo, the recently appointed coach of
Brazil's national team, Corinthians has chalked up 23 points in the
national championship with seven wins and two ties _ but in the
Mercosur Cup it has posted a dismal 1 point, with one loss and one
tie.
	   Penarol, which shares last place with Corinthians, will also be
looking for its first win in the tournament on Tuesday.
	   Corinthians is hoping that playing at home will be the decisive
factor in picking up its first victory.
	   ``The encouragement of the fans is a big advantage,'' said
midfielder Ricardinho. ``They pressure us to do our best and ....
help intimidate the adversary.''
	   But playing at home didn't help Corinthians two weeks ago when
it lost 2-1 to Argentina's Racing.
	   ``Playing at home is always an advantage,'' said Luxemburgo.
``But if we play against Penarol like we did against Racing, it
won't help much.''
 &UR; Gremio vs .U. Catolica
	   At Porto Allegre, Brazil, Universidad Catolica of Chile visits
Gremio this week with a chance to take over first place in one of
the toughest groups of the Mercosur Cup.
	   The Chileans now hold third place in Group E with two points,
after a pair of 1-1 ties with Brazil's Vasco da Gama and
Argentina's River Plate. The two, among the best teams in South
America at the moment, are co-leaders with four points each.
	   A victory against Gremio on Tuesday would vault Universidad into
first place, with five points.
	   Not long ago, the prospect of a visitor beating Gremio at home
was all but unthinkable. But the 1995 Brazilian and Copa
Libertadores champion has fallen on hard times.
	   Gremio, once renowned for its steely defense and clockwork
attack, hasn't won a game since May. In the Brazilian
first-division championship, the team is in 24th and last place
with just three points in eight games.
	   In the Mercosur Cup, Gremio also is winless. The team lost 3-2
to River and 1-0 to Vasco and is stuck in last place with zero
points.
	   The game starts at 9:40 p.m. local time (0040 GMT Wednesday) at
Olimpico stadium.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The Dow industrials plummeted below 8,000 Monday

opening minutes of trading, was down 315.39 at 7,736.29 in the
final hour of trading on volume that was active but below last

Russia crisis &QL; 
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with Blair's conversation with Yeltsin &QL; 

<TEXT>
	    &UR; With BC-Russia-Economy
	   LONDON (AP) _ Prime Minister Tony Blair on Monday urged Russian
President Boris Yeltsin to persist with economic reforms, saying
that was a condition for any help from major industrial nations.
	   Blair, who holds the rotating chairmanship of the Group of Eight
major industrialized nations, spoke to Yeltsin for 20 minutes, a
spokesman for Blair said.
	   Over the weekend, Blair spoke to leaders of the United States,
France, Germany, Italy, Canada and Japan over the weekend to share
assessments of Russia's economic and political turmoil.
	   In his talk with Yeltsin, Blair ``passed on the desire of those
nations to help Russia, but made it clear that there was agreement
among them that any help must be tied to the economic reform
process continuing,'' said the spokesman, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
	   ``He was assured that Russia understood the importance of that
economic reform program,'' the spokesman said.
	   Blair's office indicated earlier that the group was waiting for
the formation of a new Russian government before taking any steps.
	   Other British sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
there's a good prospect of some kind of meeting at ministerial
level _ not of heads of government.
	   Russia, whose economic crisis has been building all summer, is
the newest member of the Group of Eight. The growing global turmoil
in developing markets hit Russia, leading to the collapse of its
financial markets and forcing the government to devalue the ruble
two weeks ago. This triggered a larger crisis of confidence in
President Boris Yeltsin's government.

When the rascals are your best students

 &UR; With Nerd Discipline-Glance &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ America's classroom hellions are using
computers to download porn, change grades, swap passwords and send
threatening e-mail when the teacher isn't looking. Often, the
brightest students are doing the mischief, and school officials are
struggling with how to discipline them.
	   The naughty students bring in homemade programs to disable
school software, install point-and-shoot war games, make
counterfeit money and design scathing sites on the World Wide Web.
	   ``You'd be amazed at what they can do,'' says Jeannine Clark,
assistant principal of Clarkstown High School North in New City.
``Clearly, a new set of guidelines is needed'' _ guidelines Clark
calls ``nerd discipline.''
	   Seventy-eight percent of America's public schools today are
connected to the Internet, according to the National Center for
Education Statistics. Educators nationwide have responded to
cyberspace antics with a patchwork of Internet-use policies,
outlining the dos and don'ts of being on-line at school.
	   Some are strictly written with harsh punishments for offenders.
Others have weak consequences or use vague terms, such as
``objectionable'' or ``offensive,'' to describe the kinds of Web
sites that students are forbidden to visit.
	   Often harder than writing the policies, however, is punishing
offenders.
	   Routine suspension is often not the best approach for bright
students, says Ms. Clark. And some parents, who don't want their
children sitting in a suspension room missing classes, think
computer experiments are good even if Johnny breaks school rules.
	   ``As one father told me, it's perfectly acceptable to allow his
child to experiment,'' Ms. Clark says. ``After all, we didn't want
to squash his curiosity, did we?''
	   Suspending computer privileges, on the other hand, can be
counterproductive for students taking courses requiring daily
computer access. Grades can suffer. Credits can be lost. Students
can drop in class ranking.
	   So an alternate punishment _ a ``monitored probation'' _ was set
up to let students use computers, but only in closely watched
settings, Ms. Clark says.
	   Reminding students of the importance of a college recommendation
also works to keep some college-bound computer troublemakers in
line.
	   Nancy Willard, an information technology consultant from Eugene,
Oregon, advises school districts to take Internet privileges away
from computer abusers and make them earn them back. Students who
surf sexually explicit sites, for example, might be assigned to
write a research paper on victims of sexual abuse.
	   In nearby Cashmere, six high schoolers were suspended for up to
10 days last school year for posting a list of more than 300
students, and suggestions on how each might die. Five students
apparently convinced the sixth, who had computer expertise, to put
the list on the World Wide Web, according to Gary Harden, who was
student body president at the school where he graduated this year.
	   ``They were all suspended and each of them had to write an essay
about good uses for the Internet,'' Harden said, adding that he
hasn't heard of any pranks since.
	   Educators, however, also must be careful that they don't trample
on student rights.
	   A school district in Westlake, Ohio, agreed in April to pay dlrs
30,000 to a student who set up a Web site _ from a home computer _
that made fun of his high school band teacher. The 17-year-old
baritone player was suspended for eight days, but sued the school
district, saying the action violated his right to free speech. A
judge agreed.

Student misbehavior goes high-tech
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With FEA-US-Nerd Discipline &QL; 
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   Examples of computer misbehavior at school:
	   _In Miami, a high school student posted a message on the World
Wide Web claiming his school was a ``melting pot of the world's
most disgusting people _ from the cafeteria women to the
principal.'' He was suspended from Hialeah-Miami Lakes High School
in May.
	   _In the past three years, Secret Service agents have paid visits
to a handful of students in Michigan, Maine, Ohio, North Dakota,
California and Connecticut who have used school computers to send
threats to President Clinton, Hillary Rodham Clinton and the White
House.
	   _In New City, a student planted electronic time bombs inside
several computers. For two weeks, computers throughout the building
suddenly shut down. Computer classes stopped. Final exams were
erased. The library's tracking system disappeared.
	   _At West High in Iowa City, Iowa, a principal promised to
tighten security in the school's computer system after a student
sent a death threat in March to an English teacher. The student was
charged in juvenile court with harassment in connection with the
threat and other messages sent to about 10 school district
employees.
	   _Police in Monticello, Georgia, traced counterfeit bills to a
computer lab printer at Jasper County Comprehensive High School.
Officials said in January that students had scanned real money into
the computer, printed it out and then threw it in a clothes dryer
with a fabric softener sheet to make the bills look and feel used.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The Dow industrials plummeted below 8,000 Monday
for the first time in seven months in a drop that was more than
wiping out all of this year's gains.
	   The Dow Jones industrial average, which rose 43 points in the
opening minutes of trading, was down 315.39 at 7,736.29 in the
final hour of trading on volume that was active but below last
week's frenzied pace.
	   In the sharp selloff, the Dow gave up the last of this year's
gains. It ended 1997 at 7,908.25. The last time the Dow closed
below 8,000 was on Jan. 30.
	   In last week's global stock market rout, the Dow plunged 481.97
points, or by 5.6 percent, its biggest percentage drop for a
calendar week since 1989.
	   At July's peak, when the Dow was at 9,337.97, it had been up
18.1 percent. The drop of 17.2 percent from the July record is the
biggest retreat since a 21.2 percent slide triggered by the Persian
Gulf crisis in the summer and fall of 1990.
	   In the heady bull market that began in October 1990 and saw the
Dow nearly quadruple, setbacks were routinely viewed as buying
opportunities. Lately, however, traders have been viewing any
attempts at a recovery as a selling opportunity.
	   Doubts about Russia's economic and political stability kept
pressure on financial markets around the world. Russia's parliament
Monday overwhelmingly rejected the appointment of Viktor
Chernomyrdin as prime minister.
	   Share prices fell in Europe, undercut by Wall Street's sharp
morning retreat. Major stock indexes fell sharply earlier in Hong
Kong and Singapore, but Japan posted a modest gain after dropping
to a 12-year low Friday.
	   In Europe, a key index of German stock prices closed down 2.3
percent and leading market gauges also finished lower in France,
Italy, Switzerland and the Netherlands.
	   Markets in London, the largest in Europe, were closed for a
holiday.
	   Hong Kong's key Hang Seng Index sank 5.7 percent in the first
seven minutes of trading Monday and ended the day with a 7.1
percent decline, falling 554.70 points to 7,275.04.
	   In Singapore, the benchmark index fell 28.83 points, or 3.25
percent, to a new low of 856.43 after ending below the 900-point
level on Friday for the first time in 10 years.
	   However, stock prices rose on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, where
the benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 192.26 points,
or 1.38 percent, to close at 14,107.89.
	   Elsewhere in Asia, the key stock index in Taiwan fell 2.8
percent to finish at a 22-month low and prices fell 1.4 percent in
Australia, but stocks ended up 1.8 percent in South Korea.
	   Across Asia, Europe and the Americas, many stock markets fell by
big percentages last week. That left some people wondering if the
year-old Asian financial crisis, and the recessions it has caused
in regional powerhouses such as Japan and Hong Kong, could spread
to the West and sour its economies.
	   On Sunday, Japan's chief economic planner, Taichi Sakaiya,
proposed an emergency summit of major industrialized countries to
address the chaos roiling world financial markets.
	   To make matters worse, the ruble's collapse in Russia has set
off political and economic instability there.
	   In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index seemed to fall sharply because
the government has reduced its role in trading.
	   For two weeks, Hong Kong's government had been buying stocks to
drive the Hang Seng Index to a level at which speculators who bet
on stock prices falling would lose money.
	   On Friday, that aggressive government buying pushed trading
volume to a record dlrs 10.1 billion. Traders estimated the
government spent dlrs 9.1 billion.
	   Speculators Monday suddenly found it more expensive to bet
against Hong Kong markets because of new measures taken by the
Futures Exchange over the weekend to curb manipulation.
	   Even though stock prices seemed far more stable in Tokyo Monday,
signs of gloom and fear about the world's economic future also
remained high in some areas.
	   ``I'm worried,'' said Kazuomi Kobayashi, a 52-year-old Tokyo
barber who dabbles in stocks as he stood in front of a large
electronic board in downtown Tokyo showing the latest Nikkei
numbers. ``I've lost so much. When I buy, it goes down. When I buy
again, it goes down again.''
	   Even in Singapore, where newspapers often work with the
government to keep people calm, signs of panic prevailed.
	   ``World markets sent reeling: World faces global meltdown as its
leaders fail to find solutions to Russia's worsening crisis,'' said
the front-page headline in Saturday's The Straits Times.
	   ``Fear of complete meltdown rules markets,'' said a headline in
The Business Times Monday.

Ivanisevic opens U.S. Open with a win

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Don't invite Goran Ivanisevic and Mark Woodforde
to the same party. They might just start throwing drinks at each
other.
	   After absorbing 23 aces and 49 winners from Ivanisevic in a 6-3,
6-4, 6-4 loss at the U.S. Open on Monday, Woodforde sounded less
than impressed. And he responded by launching some high, hard ones
of his own at the Croat.
	   ``He just served me off the court,'' the Australian said.
``That's about all Goran has.''
	   It's frequently enough, though. Ivanisevic, seeded No. 14, is
one of the marquee players in the sport, equipped with 90 Grand
Slam tournament match victories in his career, most of them
achieved with that big, booming serve that topped out at 132 mph on
Monday. The big serve took him to the fifth set before he lost the
Wimbledon championship to Pete Sampras in the last Slam tournament.
	   Still, that type of tennis troubles traditionalists who prefer
longer serve and volley points. Put Woodforde in that category.
	   ``I don't see what the attraction is,'' he said, of Ivanisevic's
big-bang style. ``It's certainly not pretty. If I were paying money
to go to the U.S. Open, I wouldn't sit out on his court.''
	   Woodforde said his strategy was to try to slow down Ivanisevic's
rat-a-tat-tat game.
	   ``In a situation like that, you try to walk back and forth and
get him to think,'' he said. ``I don't think he thinks too much out
there.''
	   Ivanisevic survived the tennis IQ test well enough for Woodforde
to think he can get into the second week at the Open, a tournament
where he has been a first-round casualty in three of the last four
years.
	   Could he ride that huge serve to his first Grand Slam
championship? Woodforde wasn't prepared to go quite that far.
	   ``I think his career weighs against him winning,'' Woodforde
said. ``The pressure weighs against him. It might be insurmountable
for him.''
	   Your serve, Goran.
	   Well, for starters, Ivanisevic wondered about the attraction of
Woodforde's style.
	   ``The way his game is, it is very tough to watch,'' he said. ``I
think it is time for him to retire (from) singles. In doubles he is
still good, because he can cover half the court.''
	   And Ivanisevic's scouting report on Woodforde's singles play?
	   ``Pretty old. Can't move. With that backhand, you can't beat
anybody,'' he said.
	   Ivanisevic said if he ever had a son, he would show the
youngster Woodforde's picture and offer some advice _ ``You can't
play tennis like him.''
	   So what is it between these two guys?
	   ``He doesn't like me too much,'' Ivanisevic said. ``He wanted to
hit me today with his ball. Actually, he hit me and he didn't say,
`Sorry.' He hit me on purpose. I was at the net. He had straight
forehand. I turned my back and he hit me. So he hates me.''
	   Ivanisevic's answer?
	   ``I hit an ace after that,'' he said, ``and that kills him.''
	   If you listen to Woodforde, it is the only reply Ivanisevic ever
has.

Two of Abiola's wives sue junta over his death
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By FRANK AIGBOGUN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Two wives of the late opposition leader
Moshood Abiola filed suit Monday against Nigeria's military junta,
charging that Abiola died in prison because he was not given proper
medical care.
	   Dupe Abiola and Teju Abiola filed separate suits against the
country's military ruler, Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar, as well as his
ministers of justice and internal affairs. They are seeking one
billion Naira, or nearly dlrs 12 million, in compensation.
	   ``The death of Moshood Abiola, husband and father of my
children, was the consequence of the unlawful violation of the
fundamental duty of the defendants to provide him with the
necessities of life in detention,'' the suits charged.
	   Abiola, a millionaire businessman turned politician, died July 7
while meeting a group of U.S. diplomats visiting him in custody.
The apparent winner of 1993's annulled presidential elections, he
was imprisoned a year later. His death sparked days of rioting
among his supporters.
	   Abiola was known to have had many wives, though Teju Abiola was
not publicly known before the suit was filed.
	   The two women are also demanding an official declaration that
Abiola's death amounted to murder by the state and that it was the
duty of the junta to provide him with adequate medical care.
	   An international medical team said earlier this month that
Abiola, 60, died of natural causes _ saying he suffered from a
narrowing of the arteries and had an enlarged heart _ but
recommended further review of the care he received in prison.
	   Some members of Abiola's family say they suspect he was
murdered, perhaps by poisoning. The U.S.-based group Physicians for
Human Rights contend his jailers played a hand in the death by
neglecting to treat his heart condition.
	   His death came as speculation mounted that he was about to be
released from prison. The timing of his death _ a month after
dictator Gen. Sani Abacha died _ spawned numerous conspiracy
theories in Nigeria.

Norwegian PM takes sick leave for depression

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Prime Minister Kjell Magne Bondevik is
suffering from depression due to overwork and taking a week's sick
leave, his office announced Monday.
	   Bondevik, who leads a fragile minority center government, has
been under considerable pressure recently as the country wrestles
with economic troubles.
	   The Norwegian currency, the krone, has declined about 6 percent
in the past month due to declining oil prices, the crisis in Asia
and Russia and uncertainty about the government's policy.
	   Bondevik's week off comes as the three-party government was to
begin debating next year's budget. Minister of Culture Anne Enger
Lahnstein will take over as prime minister as long as Bondevik is
ill.
	   The sick leave also forced him to cancel plans to travel to the
Middle East September 7-12.
	   Initial reaction from politicians across the political spectrum
was sympathetic.
	   Carl I. Hagen of the far-right Progress Party praised Bondevik
for his openness.
	   ``It is positive that the Prime Minister has followed up signals
(from health experts) to be more open about mental suffering,''
Hagen said.
	   Labor party leader Thorbjoern Jagland, whom Bondevik replaced as
prime minister last year, said he hopes Bondevik makes a quick
recovery and did not expect that the leave would affect work with
the budget.
	   ``It shouldn't matter. It must be allowed to be sick in this
country,'' Jagland said.
	   It is unclear what pressures might have triggered Bondevik's
depression. Bondevik, an ordained Lutheran minister, is considered
an honest and likeable politician with a high moral standard and
has suffered much less personal bullying from the media than many
other politicians.
	   But he and his government have been blamed for contributing to
the economic problems Norway is having by seeming indecisive and
internally divided, and many observers recently have predicted the
government is on the verge of falling.
	   Many regard the government as appearing too willing to increase
spending for favorite causes, especially a costly reform to give
cash support to mothers who stay home with young children, without
being able to make the corresponding cuts.
	   At the same time it presided over record wage increases last
spring. Experts have long warned that Norway's economy was
overheating and needed tightening.
	   The krone's loss of value and dramatic interest rate hikes
during the last couple of weeks have driven home the urgency of
budget-tightening, which has forced Bondevik to weigh postponing
the second phase of the cash support scheme, which was his
Christian People's Party's top electoral promise.
	   Bondevik has for the last week been criticized for breaking his
promises by mothers who have quit their jobs, counting on the
money.
	   To supplement his woes Bondevik has had to watch the Central
Bank's interest hikes threaten serious belt-tightening for the same
mortgage-burdened young families that now fear not getting the cash
support.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ U.S. embassies in the West African countries
of Ghana and Togo were closed Monday because of security threats,
the State Department said.
	   The embassy in Ghana will be closed at least through Wednesday,
according to an announcement released here and in the Ghanian
capital of Accra.
	   In Togo, the embassy was to be closed Monday and ``possibly
additional days,'' a separate announcement said.
	   Americans in the two countries were urged to avoid all U.S.
facilities.
	   State Department spokesman Lee McClenny offered no comment
beyond the announcements.
	   There have been a number of security alerts at U.S. embassies
since the terrorist bombings in Kenya and Tanzania three weeks ago.
	   Last Thursday, the State Department announced that the U.S.
Embassy in South Korea had received unconfirmed information that
terrorist action might be taken against U.S. installations or
people in that country.
	   In the immediate aftermath of the East Africa bombings, U.S.
embassies in several countries took brief ``time-outs'' to make
security adjustments following threats from suspected terrorists.
	   The Accra embassy was closed for three days earlier this month
after a bomb threat but reopened Aug. 17.

Study: Radioactive implants effective long-term treatment for
</HEADLINE>
prostate cancer &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: Hold for release at 2000 GMT &QL; 
 &UR; By PATRICIA J. MAYS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTA (AP) _ Implanting radioactive seeds in the prostate to
treat early stages of cancer can be as effective over the long run
as surgery and more effective than external beam radiation, a new
study suggests.
	   With brachytherapy, tiny seeds of radioactive material are
injected into the prostate to shrink the cancer from within.
Patients treated with this method run a lower risk of urinary
incontinence or impotence than with surgery, one of the most common
ways to treat prostate cancer.
	   Until now, however, there had been no evidence of the long-term
value of brachytherapy.
	   A study conducted at Northwest Hospital in Seattle looked at 152
men 10 years after they were treated with radioactive seeds and, in
some cases, beams of radiation from outside the body.
	   Five patients couldn't be located 10 years later. Of the 147
others, 97 _ or 64 percent of the original number _ remained free
of disease and had low levels of prostate-specific antigen, or PSA,
which can be an early signal of the cancer. Only three patients
died of prostate cancer.
	   ``It shows that brachytherapy is a proven, viable option for
treating clinically localized prostate cancer,'' said Dr. Haakon
Ragde, lead author of the study. ``This is just as effective as the
best surgical results and is more effect than conventional
radiation beam results.''
	   The study, published in Tuesday's edition of the journal Cancer,
is the first to observe brachytherapy patients for a full 10 years,
said Ragde, a urologist at the Seattle hospital's Northwest
Prostate Institute.
	   Earlier studies cited by Ragde showed that 13 percent to 38
percent of patients treated only with external beam radiation were
disease-free after 10 years. Among patients whose prostates were
surgically removed, those studies showed disease-free survival
rates of 47 percent to 73 percent, Ragde said.
	   An estimated 184,500 American men will get the disease this year
and about 39,200 will die, the American Cancer Society estimates.
It is the second leading cancer killer among U.S. men after lung
cancer.
	   In 1995, 34.1 percent of prostate cancer patients underwent
radical prostatectomy, or surgical removal of the prostate. An
additional 26.3 percent were treated with external beam radiation
and only 2.2 percent with brachytherapy.
	   ``With this data, many men are now going to be opting for seed
implantation because of the numerous advantages it has in terms of
reduced morbidity, impotence and incontinence,'' said Dr. Subir
Nag, president of the American Brachytherapy Society.
	   But Dr. Kevin Loughlin, director of the Prostate Center at
Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, called the study incomplete
misleading and said the 10-year survival rate with surgery is
actually about 80 percent.
	   ``I think this whole paper is really suspect,'' Loughlin said.

	   WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) _ After meeting with Congo's president,
Namibia's President Sam Nujoma said Monday that hostile foreign
forces had been expelled from Congo.
	   Nujoma did not specify the nationality of the foreign forces
that had been expelled. But in the past, Congo President Laurent
Kabila has charged that Uganda and Rwanda have invaded Congo to
back a month-old insurrection trying to unseat his government.
	   Other foreign troops from Namibia, Zimbabwe and Angola have been
backing Kabila.
	   Nujoma said expulsion of the hostile troops was one conditions
set by Kabila for discussing peace proposals.
	   Speaking to reporters at State House earlier in the day, Kabila
had been more pessimistic about a peace settlement.
	   ``We shall talk peace when (the rebels) are out of the
country,'' Kabila said.
	   It was not clear which parties would discuss a peace settlement.
	   Across the continent in Mozambique, the presidents of Angola and
Uganda sat down together on Monday for the first time since the
Congo crisis developed a month ago to discuss their differences.
	   Kabila flew Monday to Namibia, ignoring a global diplomatic
summit in Durban, South Africa, that was expected to tackle the
crisis that has threatened security in central Africa.
	   He said Sunday he would not attend the Nonaligned Movement
summit because he was ``too busy organizing resistance against
foreign aggression.''
	   Earlier in the day, Kabila repeated accusations he made Sunday
in Zimbabwe that South Africa had sold 61 tons of guns and
ammunition to Rwanda, a country that shares Congo's eastern border
and that Kabila claims is also backing the insurrection.
	   South Africa denied Kabila's charges it had sold weapons to
Rwanda to be used for the rebels.
	   South Africa has acknowledged, that along with other countries,
it did supply arms nearly two years ago to the country's Tutsi-led
government in the aftermath of massacres of Tutsis by Hutus.
	   Global delegates at NAM summit were to consider a proposal from
Kabila to censure Rwanda and Uganda for alleged invasion of his
country.
	   Kabila also met Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vaypayee, who
was on his way to the Durban summit.

	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ A bomb packed with nails and hidden in a
television set exploded near a popular marketplace in Algiers on
Monday, killing at least 17 people and injuring about 60.
	   Hospital sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, put the
death toll at 20, whereas security forces said in a statement that
17 had died.
	   The explosion ripped through a packed square in the neighborhood
of Bab-el-Oued, considered a stronghold of Muslim fundamentalists.
It sent people running through the streets in panic; at least 10 of
the injured were hurt in the stampede.
	   Ambulances rushed to the scene, and police cordoned off the
surrounding area. Two hours after the explosion, ambulance workers
were still ferrying people to hospitals.
	   There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but suspicion
fell on militants waging the Islamic insurgency against the
military-backed government, now in its seventh year.
	   Witnesses, speaking on condition of anonymity, told The
Associated Press that shortly before the explosion, two young
people were seen depositing a TV set in front of a repair shop near
the marketplace. The set contained the bomb.
	   The covered marketplace of Bab-el-Oued had been targeted before,
and police frequently patrolled the area. Guards also were posted
at the entrance. However, nobody suspected that the TV set left in
front of the repair shop _ a common practice in Algiers _ contained
a bomb.
	   The attack took place as President Liamine Zeroual was on a trip
to several African countries. In Durban, South Africa on Tuesday,
he plans to argue at the Nonaligned Summit on behalf of an
international convention on fighting terrorism.
	   Earlier, the government said it would open 48 offices nationwide
Tuesday to help investigate the disappearance of Algerians during
the insurgency.
	   Human rights groups, citing witness accounts, have suggested
Algeria's army had a role in some of the thousands of reported
disappearances in the past six years. An estimated 75,000 people,
including Islamic militants, civilians and security forces, have
been killed since 1992.
	   Authorities said the opening of the offices coincided with 554
new cases of missing people lodged with the Interior Ministry.
	   In June, Interior Minister Mustapha Benmansour dismissed as a
``fabrication'' a report sent to Algeria's parliament by Louiza
Hanoune, president of the leftist Workers Party, citing several
hundred people who were missing.
	   Although many of the disappeared are feared dead, Algeria's
government-run National Observatory for Human Rights says some may
have secretly fled the country or joined the insurgents.
	   Algeria's insurgency began after the army canceled legislative
elections the now-banned Islamic Salvation Front was poised to win.

Sampras sharp as Open begins
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BOB GREENE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Pete Sampras loosened up Monday for what he
hopes will be a piece of tennis history _ a record-tying 12th Grand
Slam singles title.
	   He got in the groove early on the speedy asphalt court at Arthur
Ashe Stadium, rolling to a 6-3, 6-2, 6-2 victory over Germany's
Marc Goellner on opening day at the U.S. Open.
	   ``In the early round matches, I just to stay sharp and get used
to the court,'' Sampras said. ``It's nice to get the monkey off
your back and get into the tournament.''
	   Goran Ivanisevic also cleared a hurdle in getting past the
opening round. No. 15 seed Alberto Berasategui wasn't so lucky.
	   ``In the last five years, I've made one semifinal and four first
rounds,'' Ivanisevic said after stopping Australia's Mark Woodforde
6-3, 6-4, 6-4 in the opening match at the main stadium. ``Today was
perfect.''
	   Ivanisevic sandwiched a 1996 trip to the semifinals around
first-round losses in 1994, '95 and '97. In 1993, the 6-foot-4
Croat made it to the second round.
	   Berasategui, one of four Spaniards seeded in the men's draw,
lost a battle of clay-courters, falling to Thomas Muster of Austria
7-6 (7-1), 6-2, 6-3.
	   Switzerland's Patty Schnyder, seeded 11th in the women's draw,
advanced with a 7-6 (7-5), 7-5 victory over Yuka Yoshida of Japan.
No. 16 Ai Sugiyama of Japan crushed Romania's Ruxandra Dragomir
6-1, 6-2.
	   Serena Williams survived to fight another day, escaping
Australia's Nicole Pratt 6-3, 3-6, 6-4.
	   Both Sampras and Ivanisevic found the hardcourts extremely fast,
just to their liking.
	   ``This is the quickest I've ever played at the U.S. Open,''
Sampras said. ``It's good for my serve-and-volley game.''
	   Goellner stayed even with the top seed through the first seven
games. After that, it was all Sampras, whose biggest serve was 131
mph (211 kmh), just 1 mph (1.6 kmh) slower than Ivanisevic's best.
	   Sampras, seeking his fifth U.S. crown and trying to tie Roy
Emerson as the men's leader with a dozen Grand Slam singles titles,
knows no opponent can be taken for granted.
	   ``You can't look ahead. That's kind of the kiss of death,''
Sampras said. ``You got to get through the first couple of matches
and then you start worrying. ... I've been in this position too
many times to look ahead.''
	   The Ivanisevic-Woodforde match appeared on paper to be one of
the closest of the first day of the year's final Grand Slam
tournament.
	   But Ivanisevic pounded 23 aces in the match between
left-handers, time and again catching Woodforde, one of the world's
top doubles players, leaning the wrong way. And even Ivanisevic's
erratic ground game was impeccable under the bright, hot sun as he
struck 49 winners to 23 by Woodforde.
	   ``If I can continue to serve like this, great,'' Ivanisevic
said.
	   Ivanisevic will be tested along the way. And one man playing
particularly well is Patrick Rafter, the Aussie whose only Grand
Slam title came in New York last year.
	   ``Physically, I'm more refreshed and a lot more relaxed for the
U.S. Open than I was last year,'' Rafter said. ``I don't have to
prove anything. My record this summer speaks for itself. I'm going
into the tournament with a lot more confidence and a stronger
mental attitude.''
	   Rafter completed his preparations Sunday by winning the Hamlet
Cup, his fourth tournament victory this summer. He was not
scheduled to play Monday.
	   In the day's third match, defending champion Martina Hingis
played Aleksandra Olsza of Poland.
	   Tonight, No. 6 Monica Seles, who has won the U.S. Open twice,
the last time six years ago, opens against Argentina's Florencia
Labat, followed by former U.S. Open champion Andre Agassi, seeded
eighth, against Sebastian Grosjean of France, who upset Sweden's
Jonas Bjorkman last week.
	   Seles, who dominated women's tennis before being stabbed during
a match in 1993, has finally been able to focus on tennis following
the death of her father this spring. And she won her first
tournament in a year two weeks ago when she captured the Canadian
Open for the fourth consecutive year.
	   Agassi has again added substance to his flash. And, like Seles,
he comes into Flushing Meadows confident.
	   ``This has been a great summer for me,'' Agassi said after
winning two hardcourt tournaments, then finishing runner-up in a
third. ``I've accomplished everything that I've hoped going into
the U.S. Open.''
	   Another match tonight sends 16-year-old Mirjana Lucic of Croatia
against Kristie Boogert of the Netherlands. It was revealed last
week that Lucic, her four siblings and her mother recently moved to
Florida to get away from her father. She says her father beat her
and her mother.
	   ``May this U.S. Open be my new beginning,'' Lucic said. ``I am
so eager to get onto the court and start playing again.''

Norwegian PM takes sick leave for depression
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: SUBS 3rd graf to clarify that krone's loss figure is for the
past month. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Prime Minister Kjell Magne Bondevik is
suffering from depression due to overwork and is taking a week's
sick leave, his office announced Monday.
	   Bondevik, who leads a fragile minority center government, has
been under considerable pressure recently as the country wrestles
with economic troubles.
	   The Norwegian currency, the krone, has declined about 6 percent
in the past month due to declining oil prices, the crisis in Asia
and Russia and uncertainty about the government's policy.
	   Bondevik's week off comes as the three-party government was to
begin debating next year's budget. Minister of Culture Anne Enger
Lahnstein will take over as prime minister as long as Bondevik is
ill.
	   The sick leave also forced him to cancel plans to travel to the
Middle East September 7-12.
	   Initial reaction from politicians across the political spectrum
was sympathetic.
	   Carl I. Hagen of the far-right Progress Party praised Bondevik
for his openness.
	   ``It is positive that the Prime Minister has followed up signals
(from health experts) to be more open about mental suffering,''
Hagen said.
	   Labor party leader Thorbjoern Jagland, whom Bondevik replaced as
prime minister last year, said he hopes Bondevik makes a quick
recovery and did not expect that the leave would affect work with
the budget.
	   ``It shouldn't matter. It must be allowed to be sick in this
country,'' Jagland said.
	   It is unclear what pressures might have triggered Bondevik's
depression. Bondevik, an ordained Lutheran minister, is considered
an honest and likeable politician with a high moral standard and
has suffered much less personal bullying from the media than many
other politicians.
	   But he and his government have been blamed for contributing to
the economic problems Norway is having by seeming indecisive and
internally divided, and many observers recently have predicted the
government is on the verge of falling.
	   Many regard the government as appearing too willing to increase
spending for favorite causes, especially a costly reform to give
cash support to mothers who stay home with young children, without
being able to make the corresponding cuts.
	   At the same time it presided over record wage increases last
spring. Experts have long warned that Norway's economy was
overheating and needed tightening.
	   The krone's loss of value and dramatic interest rate hikes
during the last couple of weeks have driven home the urgency of
budget-tightening, which has forced Bondevik to weigh postponing
the second phase of the cash support scheme, which was his
Christian People's Party's top electoral promise.
	   Bondevik has for the last week been criticized for breaking his
promises by mothers who have quit their jobs, counting on the
money.
	   To supplement his woes Bondevik has had to watch the Central
Bank's interest hikes threaten serious belt-tightening for the same
mortgage-burdened young families that now fear not getting the cash
support.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The Dow industrials plummeted a near-record 512
points Monday, tumbling below 8,000 for the first time in seven
months and more than wiping out all of this year's gains.
	   The Dow Jones industrial average, which rose 43 points in the
opening minutes of trading, finished with a loss of 512.61 _ or 6.3
percent _ at 7,539.07. Trading was heavy heavy but below last
week's frenzied pace.
	   It was the second-largest point drop ever, closely trailing the
record 524.26 points of Oct. 27, 1997 and just above the 508-point
``Black Monday'' swoon of Oct. 19, 1987, when the market had its
biggest percentage fall, a tumble of 22.6 percent. Today's loss was
6.4 percent, the biggest daily percentage drop since last October.
	   In the sharp selloff that gained momentum in the final hour, the
Dow gave up the last of this year's gains. It ended 1997 at
7,908.25. The last time the Dow closed below 8,000 was on Jan. 30.
	   Broader indicators also plunged and the Nasdaq composite index
was registering its biggest point drop ever.
	   In last week's global stock market rout, the Dow plunged 481.97
points, or by 5.6 percent, its biggest percentage drop for a
calendar week since 1989.
	   At July's peak, when the Dow was at 9,337.97, it had been up
18.1 percent. The drop of 19.3 percent from the July record is the
biggest retreat since a 21.2 percent slide triggered by the Persian
Gulf crisis in the summer and fall of 1990.

Muralitharan (16-220) bowls Sri Lanka to victory

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Off-spinner Muttiah Muralitharan returned the
fifth best figures in the history of test cricket as Sri Lanka
trounced England by 10 wickets in the one-off test at the Oval
Monday.
	   Muralitharan, the 26-year old introvert, once accused of
throwing, took 16-220 in 113.5 overs to lead Sri Lanka's victory
charge, it's first win on English soil in four attempts.
	   It was also Sri Lanka's second win over England in six tests.
The last time the two teams met, Sri Lanka, handed out a
five-wicket defeat in Colombo in 1992/93.
	   Muralitharan, took 9-59 in the England second innings as the
home side was bowled out for 181, leaving Sri Lanka 37 runs to
secure a famous victory.
	   In England's first innings 445, Muralitharan, took 7-155, thus
single-handedly destroying England. The only other wicket to fall
in the second innings was Alec Stewart's run out.
	   Left-hander Sanath Jayasuriya, who top scored in the Sri Lankan
first innings with 213, smashed 24 runs off 17 balls with two sixes
and as many boundaries to win in five overs.
	   Jayasuriya's opening partner Marvan Atapattu, unbeaten on nine,
flicked medium paceman Ben Hollioake for his only boundary to seal
victory with nine overs to spare.
	   Muralitharan's bowling effort ranks behind Englishmen Jim
Laker's 19-90 in 1956 and Syd Barnes' 17-159 in 1913-14, Indian
Narendra Hirwani's 16-136 in 1987-88 and Australian Bob Massie's
16-137 in 1972.
	   Sri Lanka's push for victory was delayed by a stubborn ninth
wicket stand between Mark Ramprakash and Darren Gough, who played
out 138 minutes for 53 runs, taking England from 127 for eight to
180 before Muralitharan struck for eighth time in the innings.
	   He had Ramprakash (42), brilliantly caught by Hashan
Tillakaratne at the short leg and seven balls later, bowled Gough
for 15 to end the long wait.
	   It was Sri Lanka's 14th win in 87 test and it fourth overseas
following its success over New Zealand in Napier 1994/95 and over
Pakistan in Faisalabad and Sialkot in 1995/96.
	   This was Arjuna Ranatunga's 12th win in his 55th test as captain
since taking over from Ranjan Madugalle in October 1989.
	   In fact, Muralitharan's 10-wicket haul is the first in a test in
England by a visiting spinner, since Pakistani Abdul Qadir's 10-211
at the Oval in 1987.
	   Man-of-the-match Muralitharan, during the second innings became
only the second off spinner to claim 200 wickets behind West Indian
Lance Gibbs, who had 309 in 79 tests.
	   Dominic Cork was his 200th victim, when wicketkeeper Romesh
Kaluwitharana, went sprawling to collect a top edged sweep, just
after lunch.
	   Muralitharan, reached the milestone with the same number of
matches as Australian Shane Warne _ 42 tests _ behind Australian
leg spinner Clarrie Grimmett, who raced to his in 36 matches.
	   Muralitharan, who was accused of throwing by England coach David
Lloyd during the test, finished the test with a career tally of 203
wicket at an average of 26.91.
	   Muralitharan's haul took his year's tally to 68 wickets in eight
tests, ahead of South African fast bowler Allan Donald, who has 66
in 11 matches.
	   England, resuming the day on 54 for two and needing a further 92
runs to make Sri Lanka bat again, slumped 116 for five at lunch and
lost three more soo after before Ramprakash and Gough came together
to delay the inevitable.
	   Skipper Arjuna Ranatunga's gamble to put England into bat first,
worked to his side's advantage.
	   After the home side struggled to score 445 thanks to two
centuries by Graeme Hick and John Crawley, Sri Lanka, went on a
leatherhunt to amass 591.
	   Sri Lanka was inspired by a brilliant double-century Jayasuriya,
and a watchful 152 by Aravinda de Silva, as they set the pace with
a record 243-run third wicket stand.
	   This is the second time Muralitharan has taken 10 wickets in a
match since his 12-117 against Zimbabwe in Kandy in January this
year.
	   Ramprakash, laboured for eight minutes over four hours top score
in the second innings, followed by skipper Stewart's 32.
	   It was Stewart's run out on the final morning that triggered a
morning collapse at 93 for three, when five wickets tumbled for 34
runs either side of lunch.

Sri Lanka demand an explanation after Lloyd's comments
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By IHITHISHAM KAMARDEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Sri Lanka reacted strongly to David Lloyd's
remarks on off-spinner Muttiah Muralitharan's action and demanded
an explanation from the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB)
Monday.
	   Lloyd, the England coach cast cloud of suspicion over Sri
Lanka's double-jointed bowler, as his side slumped to defeat in the
one-off test.
	   Muralitharan, 26, was no-balled seven times by Australian umpire
Darrell Hair during Sri Lanka's second test against Australia at
Melbourne on Boxing Day 1995.
	   But Muralitharan, who has taken 201 test wickets in 42 tests so
far, has since been cleared after medical evidence confirmed a
physical deformity on both his arms.
	   Muralitharan, bowls with a bent right arm that cannot be
straightened.
	   ``We don't want a repetition of what happened before,'' said an
angry Thilanga Sumathipala, the president of the Board of Control
for Cricket in Sri Lanka (BCCSL).
	   ``If there were any concerns he should have gone to the match
referee, not the media,'' said Sumathipala.
	   ``I will make my opinions known to the appropriate
authorities,'' Lloyd said of Muralitharan. ``I am not going any
further than that, I am not prepared to make any more comment,''
Lloyd said after the fourth day's play.
	   ``I have brought it to the attention of the ECB and I want to
know what concerns he has, it was all highly uncalled for,''
Sumathipala said.
	   ``It is also totally disappointing from the Sri Lankan public's
point of view. This has been a successful tour up to now,
everything was positive and it is disappointing for something like
this to happen now.''
	   Sri Lanka, the reigning one-day world champions, went into the
test following its triumph in the triangular series that included
England and South Africa.
	   Match referee Ahmed Ebrahim confirmed he had studied Lloyd's
comments but decided against a hearing.
	   ``Claiming someone had an `unorthodox action did not contravene
the ICC's code of conduct,'' Ahmed said.
	   Richard Peel, the ECB's Director of Corporate Affairs, said,
Lloyd would be spoken to at the end of the test.

Corinthians meets Penarol in first round game of Mercosur Cup

 &UR; Corinthians vs. Uruguay, Tuesday.

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ Seeking its first Mercosur Cup win,
Corinthians, the undefeated leader of Brazil's national soccer
championship, meets Uruguay's Penarol this week.
	   Led by Wanderley Luxemburgo, the recently appointed coach of
Brazil's national team, Corinthians has chalked up 23 points in the
national championship with seven wins and two ties _ but in the
Mercosur Cup it has posted a dismal 1 point, with one loss and one
tie.
	   Penarol, which shares last place with Corinthians, will also be
looking for its first win in the tournament on Tuesday.
	   Corinthians is hoping that playing at home will be the decisive
factor in picking up its first victory.
	   ``The encouragement of the fans is a big advantage,'' said
midfielder Ricardinho. ``They pressure us to do our best and ....
help intimidate the adversary.''
	   But playing at home didn't help Corinthians two weeks ago when
it lost 2-1 to Argentina's Racing.
	   ``Playing at home is always an advantage,'' said Luxemburgo.
``But if we play against Penarol like we did against Racing, it
won't help much.''
 &UR; Gremio vs .U. Catolica
	   At Porto Allegre, Brazil, Universidad Catolica of Chile visits
Gremio this week with a chance to take over first place in one of
the toughest groups of the Mercosur Cup.
	   The Chileans now hold third place in Group E with two points,
after a pair of 1-1 ties with Brazil's Vasco da Gama and
Argentina's River Plate. The two, among the best teams in South
America at the moment, are co-leaders with four points each.
	   A victory against Gremio on Tuesday would vault Universidad into
first place, with five points.
	   Not long ago, the prospect of a visitor beating Gremio at home
was all but unthinkable. But the 1995 Brazilian and Copa
Libertadores champion has fallen on hard times.
	   Gremio, once renowned for its steely defense and clockwork
attack, hasn't won a game since May. In the Brazilian
first-division championship, the team is in 24th and last place
with just three points in eight games.
	   In the Mercosur Cup, Gremio also is winless. The team lost 3-2
to River and 1-0 to Vasco and is stuck in last place with zero
points.
	   The game starts at 9:40 p.m. local time (0040 GMT Wednesday) at
Olimpico stadium.

Four teams tied for Argentine first division top spot
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Four teams share the lead of
Argentina's first division following weekend play that wrapped up
the fourth date of the Apertura championship.
	   Sitting atop the standings are Velez Sarsfield, Union, Boca
Juniors and Newell's Old Boys, all with 8 points each. Five teams
follow with 7 points.
	   Velez Sarsfield, last season's champion, joined the teams in the
top spot after a 3-0 victory over Talleres Friday, led again on the
strong play of Paraguayan goalkeeper Jose Luis Chilavert.
	   But the weekend's most exciting game was between two teams that
had been off to a slow start four games into the season. San
Lorenzo beat River Plate 4-3 in the highest scoring game of the
weekend.
	   River Plate, playing without star Marcelo Gallardo, continues to
struggle post-Marcelo Salas, the goal scorer who was transferred at
last season's end to Italy's Lazio.
	   Fan favorite Boca Juniors tied Gimnasia de La Plata 0-0, earning
a point and extending the team's improved play under new coach
Carlos Bianchi, formerly of Velez.
	   Newell's played Union to a 0-0 tie.

Intentional own goal ends bizarre match
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam (AP) _ The striker scores an own goal
with less than a minute left to play, breaking the tie and losing
the match. A tragedy? No, a farce.
	   Thailand unwillingly beat Indonesia 3-2 in a game that neither
team _ fearing a date with rabid hometeam fans in Hanoi that
winning would guarantee _ wanted to claim.
	   Vietnam Television reported that the match inspector said he
would recommend to the ASEAN Football Federation that the result be
scrapped.
	   Only a lopsided Indonesia victory would keep both teams from
advancing to the semifinals from Group A. But whoever won the group
faced the undesireable prospect of flying to Hanoi to play host
Vietnam before a rabid crowd on Wednesday, National Day.
	   The result was such a poor display that the half-capacity crowd
which had cheered so strongly during Myanmar's spirited 5-2 win
over the Philippines in the opener had virtually vanished 15
minutes into the match.
	   The commmentator for ESPN International, a U.S.-based cable
sports channel, openly derided the match, shown live regionally.
	   Several stars sat out for each team. Neither side made a serious
move on goal in a first half where there was not a single whistle,
and hardly a smear on a single uniform, despite a deteriorating,
muddy pitch.
	   It appeared that tournament officials must have talked with both
teams at the break, because Indonesia came out with more spirit. It
also knew that a tie was the same as a victory because it already
was atop the standings. Only a loss would move Thailand into first.
	   Mirobaldo Bento found virtually no resistance on a crossing pass
in the 52nd minute to put Indonesia up 1-0. Thailand finally came
to life, but as soon as Krisasha Piandet equalized in the 65th
minute, the Thais died again.
	   Aji Santoso put Indonesia back ahead 2-1 in the 85th minute, and
Thailand went on the move again, with Thersak Chaiman tying the
score at 2-2 in the 89th minute.
	   Then, with time running down, Indonesia moved the ball down deep
into its own territory. Two quick passes, and Yusuf Ekodono scored
as goalkeeper Hendro Kartiko, who earlier had made several
offensive forays to leave the goal open, stepped out of the way.
	   Thailand didn't have enough time to even think of employing the
same tactic at its own end.
	   Both coaches said afterward that they never had seen anything so
strange. Indonesia's coach said the players had fixed their action
on their own and that he had nothing to do with it.
	   In the earlier match, Myanmar needed an overwhelming victory but
found itself down 2-1 after Alfredo Gonzalez scored his second goal
for the Philippines in the 31st minute.
	   Myo Hilang Win equalized five minutes before the half, and Aung
Khine scored twice within three minutes to put Myanmar ahead 4-2 in
the 77th minute. Hilang Win got his second goal four minutes later.
	   But Myanmar realistically had needed a six-goal margin to make
things interesting in the nightcap.
	   The final is scheduled for Saturday in Hanoi. First prize is
dlrs 80,000.

Organizers insist Euro 2000 preparations are on track
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIKE CORDER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROTTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Rejecting reported UEFA criticism,
the Euro 2000 tournament director insisted Monday that preparations
for the soccer championships jointly hosted by Belgium and the
Netherlands are on track.
	   Alain Courtois' comments followed reports that UEFA, European
soccer's governing body, was considering moving the championships
to another host country because of fears that building work at
three Belgian stadiums was lagging behind schedule.
	   Grounds in Charleroi, Bruges and Liege need extensive renovation
work to improve capacity and security for the championships due to
kick off in June 2000 and there are fears that they may not all be
ready. But Courtois was adamant the modernization would all be
completed on time.
	   ``I read that the Netherlands may become a victim of the slow
work at Belgian stadiums,'' he said. ``That is not true. That is
totally untrue. Work on the stadiums in Belgium is on schedule.''
	   The 2000 tournament marks the first time a European Championship
has been co-hosted by two nations.
	   Courtois said the stadium in Bruges would be ready by the end of
this year while the grounds in Liege and Charleroi would be ready
by June 1999, a year before the tournament kicks off.
	   The tournament is due to be played at eight venues; four in the
Netherlands and four in Belgium. The Dutch grounds are all
completed while Brussels' 50,000-seat King Boudewijn stadium is the
only Belgian stadium ready for Euro 2000 to start.
	   Organizers will meet Thursday with a UEFA delegation to discuss
the public row and progress being made in the preparations.
	   They are also planning a press presentation at the end of
October to unveil the progress and the tournament's ticketing
policy. Tickets are due to go on sale later this year.
	   Planners of this summer's World Cup finals in France came under
fire because not enough fans outside France were able to buy
tickets. Courtois said Euro 2000 organizers had learned lessons
from their French counterparts. He would not be more specific but
did stress that most Euro 2000 tickets would be cheaper than those
for the World Cup in France.
	   ``We want to make sure the ordinary fan can afford a ticket,''
he said.
	   The governments of both host nations also reportedly came under
fire from UEFA officials for their lukewarm support of the
championships.
	   Dutch and Belgian officials have said they will deploy as few
possible police at grounds during the tournament because of the
high cost. They also would like to see the tournament cut from
three to two weeks as a way of reducing the potential for crowd
trouble.

	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Former Ajax and AC Milan star
Frank Rijkaard was named Monday as the new coach of the Dutch
national soccer team.
	   Rijkaard replaces Guus Hiddink, who joined Spanish giant Real
Madrid after guiding the Netherlands to fourth place in the
summer's World Cup finals in France. Rijkaard was Hiddink's
assistant during the tournament.
	   ``This is an honor and a challenge,'' Rijkaard said. ``I was
very happy to accept and will work very hard.''
	   He signed a contract until the end of the European Championships
in 2000, which are being co-hosted by the Netherlands and Belgium.
The contract has an option to extend for a further two years.
	   The 35-year-old former Ajax and AC Milan player was a star of
the Dutch team that won the 1988 European Championships. He played
73 internationals for the Netherlands, scoring 10 goals from the
midfield.
	   Another former Dutch great, Johan Neeskens, was appointed as
Rijkaard's assistant. Neeskens also was part of Hiddink's World Cup
management team.
	   Rijkaard, who only ended his playing days at the end of the 1995
season, was considered by many an outsider for the coach's job.
Former Celtic manager Wim Jansen was many pundits' favorite to take
over from Hiddink.
	   ``I cannot deny that this was a surprise for me,'' Rijkaard
said. ``I am unbelievably happy.''

New AIDS strain found in west Africa with closer link to monkey

<TEXT>
	   DENVER (AP) _ French researchers have isolated a new strain of
the AIDS virus in west Africa that appears to have close genetic
links to a version that infects non-human primates such as
chimpanzees.
	   It's a reminder, they said, of how genetically flexible and
cunning the human immunodeficiency virus can be.
	   The new strain so far has been found only in one patient, a
40-year-old woman in Cameroon who died of AIDS in 1995.
	   French and African officials have launched a public health
investigation in Cameroon and neighboring Gabon to determine if the
new strain is being widely transmitted.
	   Infectious disease experts are publishing a report on the new
strain in the Sept. 1 issue of Nature Medicine. They said they do
not expect it to become prevalent, but it could escape detection by
current diagnostic methods used in laboratory screening programs.
	   ``The present isolate is rather a rare bird,'' said Simon
Wain-Hobson of the Institute Pasteur in Paris, who did not
participate in the study.
	   HIV constantly evolves into new strains, even as researchers
develop new combinations of therapies to control its proliferation.
	   The World Health Organization estimates there will be upwards of
40 million AIDS cases caused by many HIV strains by the end of the
century.
	   On a global scale, there are two simultaneous epidemics, HIV-1
and HIV-2. HIV-1 is the more widespread of the two viral groups;
HIV-2 is mainly in Asia and east Africa.
	   Most of the strains in HIV-1 belong to a group designated as M,
for major strains. There is also an O group for minor, outlying
strains that appear to be clustered in west Africa.
	   The new strain in Cameroon is HIV-1 but is neither an M or an O.
Instead, the study's lead author, Francois Simon of the Hospital
Bichat in Paris, said the new strain veers noticeably from both
established groups and deserves the new label of N.
	   The researchers said the genetic profile of the new strain is
closer to the genes of versions of the viruses found in chimpanzees
and other non-human primates. It is not certain how the Cameroon
woman contracted the strain, but the genetic profile suggests it
may have been transmitted from another species, they report.
	   Infectious disease experts cautioned that the possible
monkey-to-human connection should not be overinterpreted. Even in
cultures where such animals are a food source, HIV is not as easily
transmittable as other illnesses.
	   However, researchers and animal handlers and breeders already
understand that Ebola, monkey herpes B, and other viruses can
``jump'' to humans.
	   ``The upshot is that cross-species transmission probably occurs
far more frequently than we care to know,'' Wain-Hobson said.
	   In the past two years, new HIV strains also have been discovered
in Thailand and India. However, they were more conventional
variants that did not have close links to non-human primate
viruses.

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The world's first vaccine against the leading
cause of childhood diarrhea _ a virus that hospitalizes 55,000
American children each year and kills 1 million in other countries
_ won approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Monday.
	   Widespread vaccination with RotaShield could prevent 1 million
American preschoolers every year from getting diarrhea caused by
the intestinal infection rotavirus and keep 34,000 of them out of
the hospital, said manufacturer Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories, which is
selling the vaccine created by the National Institutes of Health.
	   Good health care limits rotavirus-caused deaths in this country
to no more than 40 a year. But in developing countries where
rotavirus is less easily treated, experts say the vaccine could
save thousands of children's lives _ if other countries also
approve the drug and can afford to buy it.
	   ``The thing that will probably limit its use in developing
countries, unfortunately, may be cost,'' said Dr. Karen Goldenthal,
FDA's vaccine director. ``It's got to be incredibly cheap to be
implemented.''
	   Wyeth will sell RotaShield for dlrs 38 a dose in the United
States; children would swallow three doses, at ages 2 months, 4
months and 6 months.
	   The company declined comment on how much it would charge in
poorer countries.
	   But the NIH scientist who discovered the drug said Wyeth
officials have promised him they'll somehow get the vaccine to
children in developing countries, probably by using profits from
rich countries to subsidize poor ones.
	   ``It's very exciting news today,'' said Dr. Albert Kapikian, who
has worked toward a vaccine for 24 years. ``I think it's going to
have a major impact.''
	   Rotavirus is the leading cause of severe childhood diarrhea,
attacking the lining of the small intestine. In severe cases, a
child can experience 10 to 20 episodes of diarrhea in a single day,
quickly getting dangerously dehydrated. In this country, the virus
is worst in winter months.
	   Rotavirus ``is a democratic virus,'' Kapikian explained _ it's
everywhere and threatens every child. About 75 percent of all
children are infected before age 5; the youngest get the sickest.
	   In the United States, 3 million children are sickened each year.
One in 40 is hospitalized, Kapikian said. But good health care,
especially replacing lost fluids, limits deaths here.
	   In developing countries with poorer health care, rotavirus is
much more deadly, killing up to 1 million children worldwide every
year.
	   In studies of U.S. infants, RotaShield prevented between 70
percent and 90 percent of severe diarrhea, although it did not
eliminate rotavirus.
	   A study in Venezuela last year concluded the vaccine was equally
effective in developing countries.
	   The main side effects were low fevers, irritability and
decreased appetite within five days of the first doses. The FDA
said it is safe to give RotaShield, an oral vaccine, at the same
time as vaccines against polio, diphtheria, whooping cough, tetanus
and a form of meningitis that infants also get by 6 months of age.
	   RotaShield is a live vaccine that protects against the four
viral strains that cause 95 percent of the world's rotavirus cases.

Rio Ferdinand doubtful for Euro qualifier vs. Sweden
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BISHAM, ABBEY, England (AP) _ West Ham defender Rio Ferdinand is
doubtful for Saturday's European Championship qualifier against
Sweden, England coach Glenn Hoddle said Monday.
	   Ferdinand, who suffered a groin injury in Saturday's Premier
League game against Coventry, skipped practice Monday along with
Steve McManaman and Ray Parlour _ both with leg injuries.
	   ``He (Ferdinand) has had this problem all season and is feeling
rather tender,'' Hoddle said. ``At this moment in time I would say
there is a doubt about him for Sweden.''
	   ``McManaman will be having a scan to make sure there is no
problem but we are hoping that Parlour's leg problem will settle
down,'' Hoddle added.
	   Manchester United midfielder Nicky Butt has already withdrawn
and will have dental surgery Tuesday.
	   Hoddle predicted a difficult match against the Swedes, one of 22
games that open qualifying for the 2000 European Championship.
Fifteen matches are set for Saturday and six for Sunday.
	   A lone game will be played Wednesday when Lichtenstein goes to
Romania.
	   ``Sweden have had some excellent results recently,'' Hoddle
said. ``They have beaten Italy, Russia and Denmark as well as
drawing with world champions France. I know they've only been
friendly matches but that's still a good pedigree.
	   ``We know going to Stockholm, as England have found in the past,
is tough and it will be a very difficult game for us.''

Claims by inspector strengthens Iraqi position, ambassador says
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with council president saying
resolution might have to include comprehensive review; TRIMS. &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The president of the U.N. Security Council
on Monday predicted passage for a resolution suspending regular
reviews of sanctions on Iraq _ but said it may have to include
seemingly contradictory provisions to get unanimous approval.
	   The U.N. chief has proposed a comprehensive review of sanctions
as a means to help break the latest impasse over inspections,
sparked when Baghdad announced Aug. 5 it was suspending cooperation
with the United Nations.
	   A resolution that would suspend the regular, 60-day reviews may
also have to express the council's willingness to hold a
comprehensive review of the 8-year-old measures, said Danilo Turk
of Slovenia.
	   A U.S.-British draft makes no mention of the comprehensive
review.
	   ``I think that this resolution has very good chances to
succeed,'' Turk said. ``I'm not saying that it would succeed easily
or that it would succeed very soon.
	   ``So I would imagine that something in the direction of the
comprehensive review could possibly be part of the package,'' he
said, though he noted that no such proposal has been drafted.
	   Iraq's U.N. ambassador, Nizar Hamdoon, dismissed the
significance of suspending regular reviews, saying eight years of
reviews hadn't resulted in any easing of the sanctions barring the
sale of oil, Iraq's economic mainstay, on the open market.
	   Arms experts must certify that Baghdad has destroyed its
long-range missiles and chemical, biological and nuclear weapons
before the council will lift sanctions imposed after Iraq invaded
Kuwait in 1990.
	   Iraq suspended cooperation with inspectors after the chief
weapons inspector, Richard Butler, refused earlier this month to
certify that Baghdad had destroyed its banned weapons.
	   U.S. officials said they hoped to get a resolution adopted this
week.
	   The U.S.-British draft would suspend the reviews until after the
chief inspectors report ``that Iraq has fully resumed the
cooperation necessary for them to perform the full range of their
activities mandated under the relevant resolutions of the
council.''
	   Turk also rejected suggestions that the council might review the
U.N. Special Commission, which carries out the searches.
	   Iraq has demanded an investigation into UNSCOM, most recently in
a letter Monday, claiming that the commission acts at the behest of
Washington.
	   ``We didn't have any indication that members would want to
discuss the functioning of UNSCOM,'' Turk said.

What price victory for Kabila?
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos WIN101-3 &QL; 
 &UR; By IAN STEWART &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ A day after purging rebel forces from
western Congo, President Laurent Kabila on Monday proclaimed the
war in the west won. But at what cost?
	   A month ago, rebels determined to oust Kabila launched a
military campaign that within weeks had routed government troops,
reaching within miles (kilometers) of downtown Kinshasa _ Congo's
ultimate prize.
	   To save his government and perhaps his own life, Kabila enlisted
the support of neighboring Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia in a move
that both internationalized Congo's conflict and splintered a
central and southern Africa already grappling with a host of
economic and political troubles.
	   The rebel coalition, comprising ethnic Tutsi fighters and
disgruntled members of Kabila's army, withdrew from its last
strongholds in the southwest over the weekend. But it left the
cities to Angolan troops, not Congolese.
	   Still, Kabila claimed the victory for himself.
	   ``There are no fronts left in the west. The last bastions of the
aggressors have fallen,'' Kabila's cabinet director, Abdoulaye
Yerodia, said Monday.
	   However, Kabila's success in the west masks larger problems: The
bulk of the rebel force consists of the same troops who last year
helped him to power. Legions of Rwandan and Congolese troops in
Kabila's army defected to the rebels, leaving the president's
whittled-down military vulnerable.
	   ``In some respects Kabila has already lost, he's come out of
this weakened,'' said Yewawa Gbiamango, a professor of political
science at the University of Kinshasa. ``President Kabila has
demonstrated to the world that he has no army and can't defend
himself.''
	   His own military in disarray and unable to hold off the rebels
alone, Kabila is now at the mercy of foreign support. In the east,
his opponents still control several key cities and are vowing to
wage a guerrilla war for as long as it takes _ months or years _ to
bring down the president.
	   That threat carries some weight, given that rebels have their
own foreign backing _ from Rwanda and Uganda. Both countries have
denied involvement, but have threatened to intervene if they
believe their interests are at risk.
	   ``The government forces would've been by now completely out if
it were not for the Angolans and Zimbabweans,'' rebel leader Ernest
Wamba dia Wamba said Sunday, speaking to The Associated Press in
the eastern city of Goma.
	   ``But they cannot stay long. And we're going to continue
fighting no matter what.''
	   In the capital, Kinshasa, Kabila may have ensured his short-term
survival, but questions are now being raised about his _ and the
country's _ long-term prospects.
	   Throughout southwestern Congo, Angolan and Zimbabwean troops
have carried the load for the government against the rebels. The
hardware that helped Kabila defeat his enemies there is on display
at Kinshasa's airport: Zimbabwean jet fighters, Angolan tanks and
armored personnel carriers, and crates of weapons supplied by both
countries.
	   On Monday, Kabila said his allies would turn to the east, where
the rebels control the cities of Goma, Bukavu and Kisangani.
Angolan chief of army staff Joao de Matos declared his forces ready
to lead the assault.
	   ``Our Angolan and Zimbabwean allies are here to kick out the
Rwanda-Ugandan aggressors,'' Yerodia said. ``They are not selective
about where they have to do that.''
	   The real test of that boast will come in the heart of rebel
territory, in Congo's east near the Rwandan and Ugandan borders _
more than 950 miles (1,500 kms) from Kinshasa. The rebel leader
Wamba said his fighters will change tactics, breaking into smaller,
more mobile groups that will be trickier for government forces to
combat.
	   Gbiamango, an expert on Congo's regional affairs, says even if a
campaign to the east were feasible it would come at enormous cost
to Kabila's government and his allies.
	   ``In essence, what we have now is two Congos,'' he said. ``One
in the west supported by Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia and one in
the east backed by Rwanda and Uganda.''
	   An extended military campaign by the west to recapture the east
will drain Angola's armed forces at home, Gbiamango said. Faced
with their own UNITA rebel movement, the Angolans can ill afford a
drawn-out and costly fight in Congo.
	   Additionally, Gbiamango says Angola's interest in helping Kabila
is less altruistic than it appears. The Angolans now have the
freedom to search out and destroy UNITA rebel groups that operate
in southwestern Congo near the border. Several UNITA fighters were
arrested in the port CITY of Matadi over the weekend.
	   In the east, there's no real motivation for the Angolans.
	   As for Zimbabwe's involvement, financial questions may determine
how long it remains in Congo.
	   President Robert Mugabe is spending upwards of dlrs 100,000 a
day to keep his military operating in Congo, Zimbabwean newspapers
have estimated. Already cash-strapped, it's a huge price for
Zimbabwe to absorb for a foreign military venture.
	   ``I can't see how they can keep that up for long,'' Gbiamango
said.

Angola's ruling party expels former rebels from government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ Angola's peace process slipped deeper into
crisis on Monday when the governing party said it was suspending
members of the former rebel group UNITA from the government.
	   In a statement read on state radio RNA, the ruling MPLA said
UNITA's ``dubious attitude'' towards the implementation of the 1994
peace pact had caused to ``a grave situation'' in the southwest
African nation.
	   Implementation of the United Nations-brokered peace deal, which
has been stymied by mistrust between the former foes, is more than
a year behind schedule. The deal ended more than two decades of
civil war.
	   UNITA refuses to give control of its central highland
strongholds to the government which it accuses of human rights
abuses in areas already handed over. The government claims UNITA
still has troops in the bush who have attacked villages in recent
months.
	   UNITA's four ministers and seven deputy ministers would be
suspended from midnight (2300 GMT), the statement said.
	   UNITA officials were not immediately available for comment.
	   The statement appealed for people to remain calm and ``avoid
taking actions which might disturb the peace, unity and national
reconciliation.''
	   Also on Monday, the President of the National Assembly, Angola's
parliament, said he had written to the Supreme Court requesting
that UNITA's lawmakers be suspended. Roberto de Almeida said he had
not yet received a reply from the country's highest court.
	   The former rebel group has 70 deputies in the 240-seat
parliament.
	   The statement said the MPLA _ a Portuguese acronym for the
Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola _ remained committed
to the peace deal which ended a two-decade civil war between the
two sides.
	   The ``Government of National Unity and Reconciliation'' took
office in April last year amid signs that peace was returning.
	   A previous peace deal, signed in 1991, collapsed a year later
after UNITA rejected its defeat in the country's first elections
and returned to the bush.
	   UNITA _ the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola
_ has complained its members of the government were never consulted
by the rest of the MPLA-dominated administration. The MPLA also has
a majority in the Luanda-based parliament.

Hart gets support from chairman
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: adds comment from former coach Laurie Mains &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ All Blacks coach John Hart has
the support of New Zealand rugby chairman Rob Fisher despite an
unprecedented run of five straight losses.
	   Hart said he would stand down if the NZRFU wanted him to, but
Fisher said Monday that Hart would be expected to continue with a
three-year contract taking him up to next year's World Cup.
	   Hart's team lost the Bledisloe Cup series 3-0 to Australia for
the first time since 1929 and also fell twice against South Africa.
The five losses came after it started the domestic season with two
wins over England.
	   ``I don't think his position is under threat,'' Fisher told New
Zealand radio. ``It certainly isn't as far as I am concerned. He
does have a three-year contract.''
	   Fisher said the five losses were unacceptable, but the fact New
Zealand squandered winning chances in four of them had helped Hart.
	   ``Had we lost five tests and lost them all badly I think that
may be a different issue,'' Fisher said. ``Five losses are very
hard to take, but what was so aggravating was that it was
conceivable we could have won four of those five tests. While there
is a lot of emphasis on the World Cup no one should ever say it's
OK to lose tests on the way through because we just want to win the
World Cup.''
	   Fisher said he had spoken to all but one board member since
Saturday and no one had expressed a desire to have Hart removed.
	   ``If anyone had felt differently they would have raised it with
me,'' Fisher said. ``My impression was one firmly of support.''
	   But former All Black coach Laurie Mains, a bitter rival to his
successor, Hart, said the present coach should consider whether he
should continue in the job.
	   Mains said a dearth of spirit was apparent in the All Black
camp, while there was a lack of clear vision in the way the
coaching staff wanted their team to play the game.
	   ``I would have to ask: is this team a happy one, is there a
clear pattern that they are playing to, is there the normal All
Black spirit in the side?'' Mains said in a radio interview.
	   ``I think it would be hard to answer positively to any of those
questions.''
	   Mains, a former test fullback, said the body language of players
during television interviews indicated all was not well within the
All Black camp.
	   Hart lost out on the All Black job to Mains when both stood for
the job at the end of the 1991 World Cup, and then challenged him
in 1994 after what was considered a poor international season _ two
wins, three losses and a draw.
	   Mains said he found the present situation ironic because he
believed the situation this year was worse than in 1994.
	   ``The old worm turns from time to time, doesn't it?'' he said.

	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ A star-packed Real Madrid had little
difficulty in defeating a meek, newly promoted Villareal 4-1 on
Monday to take the No.1 position in the league in the opening
round.
	   Villareal, a humble team which was founded in 1923 in the
eastern coastal town of Castellon, fought bravely throughout in the
capital's Santiago Bernabeu stadium in its first match ever in the
Spanish premier league, although without luck.
	   Villareal pressured early as its new star Romanian Gheorghe
Craioveanu, who played the last three seasons for Real Sociedad,
made it 1-0 in the 3rd minute stunning 70,000 Madrid fans at
Bernabeu.
	   But the European champions still looked strong and Madrid's
crowd favorite Raul Gonzalez popped in the equalizer for Madrid
after he and Yugoslav Predraj Mijatovic converged in the 35th on
the Villareal goal of the second half badly confusing the defense.
	   Raul's was followed by one by Mijatovic in the 50th minute, just
one minute after Villareal went down to ten players when forward
Moises Garcia was expelled for accumulating yellow cards. Brazilian
striker Savio also put in the third, scoring ten minutes later.
	   Raul Gonzalez added another goal in the 67th-minute to give Real
Madrid its first win of the year.
	   Madrid coach Guus Hiddink, happy with the talent he's found at
Madrid including Croatia's Davor Suker, Brazilians Roberto Carlos
or Savio, has limited Madrid's foreign signings to Croatian
midfielder Robert Jarni, who made its Bernabeu debut Monday.
	   Real Madrid, winner of 27 League titles, will try this season to
regain the domestic title from arch-rival Barcelona, which drew
with modest Racing de Santander in the Spanish first division's
opening round on Sunday.
	   In other games Sunday, it was: Zaragoza 2, Athletic de Bilbao
0;Espanyol 2, Tenerife 1; Real Sociedad 3 Oviedo 3; Salamanca 0,
Mallorca 0; Celta 0, Deportivo de La Coruna 0, Extremadura 0,
Valladolid 0.
	   On Saturday, Valencia beat Atletico de Madrid 1-0 and Alaves
drew 0-0 against Betis.

Seattle and Cleveland swap Cora for Bell
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CLEVELAND (AP) _ Attempting to bolster their lineup for a
playoff run, the Cleveland Indians acquired former All-Star second
baseman Joey Cora from the Seattle Mariners on Monday in a trade
for David Bell.
	   Cora, 33, was an All-Star last season and joined the Mariners in
1995.
	   He was hitting .283 in 131 games with the team this season, with
23 doubles and six home runs. In his four years with Seattle, Cora
played in 543 games and had a .292 batting average.
	   ``Joey Cora is a solid acquisition for club as we approach the
latter part of our schedule,'' Indians general manager John Hart
said. ``He is a professional hitter who plays with a lot of joy and
enthusiasm.''
	   The Indians have not settled at second base all season.
	   An attempt to move Shawon Dunston to second from shortstop
failed early in the year and he was traded to the San Francisco
Giants. Enrique Wilson has also played at second for Cleveland.
	   Bell, 26, was Cleveland's most consistent starter at second, but
also played 10 games at third base and one game each at first base
and shortstop. He hit .262 with 21 doubles and 10 home runs in 107
games with the Indians.
	   ``Bell is a versatile, young infielder with major league
experience that we like very much,'' said Woody Woodward, the
Mariners' vice president of baseball operations.
	   ``We felt when we traded for Carlos Guillen that he had a chance
to be our second baseman next season and had planned on playing him
in September. This trade allows us to add to our nucleus of good,
young infielders as we continue to reshape our team for next
year.''
	   Guillen was acquired from the Houston Astros as part of the
Randy Johnson trade on July 31.
	   In an unrelated roster move, the Indians placed left-handed
pitcher Tom Martin on the 15-day disabled list with a strained
right groin and bought the contract of catcher Einar Diaz from
Class AAA Buffalo. Cleveland also transferred pitcher John Smiley
from the 15-day disabled list to the 60-day disabled list.

Deadline passes for West Bank troop withdrawal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS lead, raises that withdrawals haven't been carried
out, no comment from State Department; TRIMS &QL; 
 &UR; By DINA KRAFT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Monday marked another missed deadline in the
troubled Israel-Palestinian peace process, with Israel failing to
carry out a set of three West Bank troop withdrawals it promised to
complete by now.
	   Last spring, Palestinians rejected as too small Israel's offer
to hand over control of 2 percent of the West Bank and shortly
afterwards, negotiations between the sides broke down and there was
no progress in the pullbacks.
	   In an effort to save the process, the United States stepped in
with a proposal earlier this year, for Israel's next withdrawal to
be from 13 percent of the West Bank, a size more acceptable to the
Palestinians. The sides are discussing the plan, but making little
headway.
	   Israel promised to carry out the pullbacks in an agreement it
signed in January 1997. The wording in that accord, sponsored by
the United States, called for the completion of the withdrawals by
mid-1998, which the U.S. interpreted as the end of August, 1998.
	   In Washington, there was no comment by the U.S. State Department
on the missed deadline.
	   And in Israel, Monday's deadline was noted in passing by only
one newspaper and radio shows ignored the topic altogether,
signaling a certain apathy among the Israeli public in the face of
a process marred by violence and deadlock.
	   Israeli officials however voiced optimism that it could reach a
deal with the Palestinians which would turn over some 13 percent of
the West Bank to Palestinian control. But, Palestinians said that
agreement on the scope of the next withdrawal remained far from
reach.
	   ``There are still big differences,'' Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat said Monday after returning from talks with Jordan's Crown
Prince Hassan in Amman.
	   Israeli officials blamed the delay in executing any of the
scheduled pullbacks on Palestinian failure to carry out the
promises it made in the 1997 deal including a concentrated
crackdown on terrorism.
	   ``This was supposed to be the third redeployment, the end of the
period of redeployments,'' said David Bar-Illan, a senior aide to
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. ``The significance of this is
that the Palestinians have persistently and consistently refused to
commit themselves in concrete terms to what they are obligated to
do,'' he said.
	   Israel has said it would accept the latest American proposal for
it to withdraw troops from 13.1 percent of the West Bank on
condition that the Palestinians be given only limited controls in
certain areas.
	   ``We have acceded to the American suggestion of 13 percent
provided that there is a difference between the 3 percent and the
10 percent,'' Bar-Illan told The Associated Press Monday.
	   It was not clear what would happen to a third redeployment.
Netanyahu had wanted to incorporate it into future talks by Ariel
Sharon, a powerful member of his Cabinet said last week that Israel
may go through with it.
	   Israel captured the West Bank, home to 1.6 million Palestinians,
from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast war and the Palestinians want it
for a future state.
	   Palestinian lawmaker Hassan Asfour shrugged off the missed
deadline, saying that Palestinians weren't surprised that Israel
had failed to keep its commitments.
	   ``It's another missed deadline. Nobody expected for it to be
concluded anyway due to the mentality of this (Israeli)
government.''

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, (AP) _ Pakistan's opposition parties vowed
Monday to stop a constitutional amendment that would impose Islamic
law, a move they fear would turn their country into a strict
Islamic state similar to neighboring Afghanistan.
	   Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's proposed new Islamic order would
undermine the constitution, wreck state institutions and threaten
the country's unity, said opposition politicians.
	   The proposed amendment, introduced Friday, would replace British
common laws with laws based on the Koran.
	   Sharif's amendment would require people to pray five times a day
and donate part of their income to religious authorities. These
authorities would have the right to ``prescribe what is right and
to forbid what is wrong.''
	   But it is unlikely the opposition will succeed in stopping the
change, because Sharif has a two-thirds majority in parliament.
	   ``These proposed laws are a conspiracy against the country and a
joke on the name of Islam,'' Senator Ajmal Khattak, the leader of
opposition Awami National Party and a former ally of Sharif told
The Associated Press. ``We have decided to form a grand alliance of
opposition parties and start a movement against the bill in early
September.''
	   The opposition says the amendment would impose a hard line
system in Pakistan, similar to that in neighboring Afghanistan.
There, Taliban rulers have imposed severe restrictions on women
working and studying, required men to grow beards and forbidden TV
watching and other customs they consider against Islamic law.
	   In a speech to Parliament Monday former prime minister Benazir
Bhutto said the country's security was threatened because for the
radical Taliban militia.
	   She said Sharif supports Mullah Omar, the leader of the Taliban,
because he wants to impose a similar type of government here.
	   ``We have recognized the Taliban government and are pleading
with every country to recognize it. . . But what have we gained
from our support for them?'' she asked.
	   The government dismissed Ms. Bhutto's criticism saying the
Taliban movement was conceived during her term in power. It's
widely believed that Ms. Bhutto's interior minister Nasrullah
Babaar supported the creation of the Taliban army in 1994.
	   Today Ms. Bhutto said Pakistan's support for the Taliban army
has soured its relations with central Asian countries, Russia and
Iran.
	   Khattak told reporters the amendment suppresses the rights of
the provinces, curtails the power of judiciary and undermined the
constitution.
	   ``People will make it unsuccessful. We will fight both inside
and outside the Parliament,'' he said.

Pakistan says signing CTBT will not to undermine nuclear
</HEADLINE>
capability &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, (AP) _ Pakistan said Monday that signing an
international nuclear test mine treaty would not undermine its
nuclear capability, but warned the nation won't sign if its arm is
twisted by economic sanctions.
	   ``We have crossed the threshold and our voluntary moratorium and
even accession to CTBT. . . will not erode our nuclear deterrence
capability,'' Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Siddique Kanju
told Parliament. ``But we will not sign under duress.''
	   Kanju said Pakistan has made its position on linking sanctions
to the signing of the test ban treaty during meetings with U.S.
officials as well as United Nations officials.
	   Pakistan was hit with roughly dlrs 1.5 billion in sanctions
after it exploded six nuclear devices last May in response to five
underground nuclear explosions carried out by its longtime enemy
and neighbor India.
	   Kanju said Pakistan no longer tied its signing of the test ban
treaty to reciprocal signing by India.
	   Rather he said Pakistan will make a decision in keeping with its
national interests.
	   Pakistan is negotiating for money from international lending
institutions and has warned that it might be forced to declare a
moratorium on repayment of its external debt which is roughly dlrs
30 billion.
	   Pakistan has achieved nuclear deterrence now and doesn't need to
conduct further test thus the decision to declare a unilateral
moratorium, he said.

Rival Iraqi Kurdish groups agree to establish autonomous
</HEADLINE>
government &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Rival Iraqi Kurdish groups have agreed to
establish an autonomous government in the region, said a Spanish
deputy on Monday just back from visiting Northern Iraq.
	   Pedro Marset, a deputy of Spain's third biggest parliamentary
group, United Left, said both sides, the Kurdistan Democratic
Party, or KDP, and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, will be ready
to sign the agreement in Washington on Sept. 18-19.
	   ``They have agreed to sign an agreement that will give the Kurds
a democratic autonomous region,'' said Marset, who traveled on Aug.
23 to 29 to Kurdish autonomous zone of northern Iraq and Damask,
Syria, as part of a delegation of United Left politicians invited
by Irak's Communist Party.
	   The two Iraqi Kurdish parties have wrestled for control of the
autonomous zone since the western allies created it after the Iraqi
government suppressed a Kurdish revolt in 1991.
	   Recently their executives have tried to push forward a
U.S.-brokered cease-fire signed in May 1997.
	   According to Marset, the agreement allows for elections to
choose the representatives of the autononous institutions of the
region, of which the United States and Great Britain keep an aerial
mission that prevents any attack of Iraqui troops of president
Sadam Hussein.
	   The spokesmen of the two Kurdish factions contacted in London by
phone refused to confirm that an agreement is imminent, saying
reconcilliation efforts are still going on.
	   ``At this juncture there are reconcilliation plans under
discussion,'' said a PUK spokesman who did not wish to be
identified.
	   But he and a spokesman for the KDP confirmed that the leaders of
their factions will travel to Washington in mid-September for
face-to-face talks mediated by senior U.S. administration
officials. They refused to elaborate.

Survivors key to discovering why Cuban plane crashed in Ecuador
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) _ Survivors hold the key to why a Cuban
airliner crashed and exploded during takeoff at Quito's airport,
killing 79 people, government spokesman Juan Reece said Monday.
	   President Jamil Mahuad received an air force report on the cause
of the accident, but said it was ``incomplete,'' and called for a
meeting with civil aviation authorities to find out more, Reece
told a news conference.
	   Survivors say the pilot of the Russian made Tupolev-154 plane
owned by Cubana de Aviacion tried to start the motors five times
Saturday before finally succeeding.
	   The plane, which carried 76 passengers and 14 crew members,
failed to gain altitude during takeoff and broke through a
retaining wall at the end of the runway, wiping out a mechanic's
shop and exploding on a soccer field. Ten people on the ground
died.
	   There were 21 survivors and rescuers found the black box. All
crew members died.
	   ``The testimony of the survivor, along with the contents of the
black box, should help to clear up the cause of the accident,''
Reece said during a news conference.
	   Survivors said they thought at least one of its motors failed
during takeoff.
	   Among the foreigners on board were Cubans, Chileans, Italians,
Spaniards, one Argentine and one Jamaican, civil aviation
authorities said.

Activist takes on religious baseball promotion
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DAVID DISHNEAU &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HAGERSTOWN, Maryland (AP) _ When Christine Preisler showed her
church bulletin for discount admission to a minor league baseball
game Sunday, she called it a bargain.
	   Carl Silverman calls it discrimination.
	   The state of Maryland's human rights commission says he may be
right.
	   Silverman is challenging the Hagerstown Suns' church bulletin
promotion in a duel likely to outlast the team's season.
	   Silverman was denied the dlrs 6 family discount price when he
brought his two young children to a game at city-owned Municipal
Stadium last Easter without a church bulletin. He paid dlrs 8 and
then complained to the Maryland Commission on Human Relations that
the promotion violated state and federal laws against religious
discrimination in places of public accommodation.
	   The state agency found probable cause for his claim, but has yet
to schedule a hearing.
	   On Friday, the American Civil Liberties Union filed a similar
complaint in federal court, seeking an order forcing the Suns to
either drop the offer or expand it to include all nonprofit
organizations' bulletins.
	   The discrimination charge has perplexed the owner and many fans
of the team, which began offering the discount after moving to this
city of 35,000 from Myrtle Beach, S.C., in 1993.
	   ``He can walk into any church and he can pick up any church
bulletin if he wants to get a discount. He doesn't have to go to
church,'' Preisler said.
	   Suns owner Winston Blenckstone said the offer promotes family
values and isn't discriminatory. He rejected ACLU attorney Michael
Berman's contention that the promotion is akin to a Catholics-only
or whites-only night.
	   ``We are simply using the community's assets, which are the
houses of faith in this area, as a symbol of family support, which
is tied directly into people who come to our ball games,''
Blenckstone said.
	   The Suns, a Class A affiliate of the Toronto Blue Jays, are in
the South Atlantic League's post-season playoffs.
	   Silverman, who lives in nearby Waynesboro, Pennsylvania, said he
wasn't surprised the community appears to favor the Suns.
	   ``I've never been out to win a popularity contest,'' he said.
``I just want the Suns to obey the laws, that's all.''
	   Silverman, an agnostic, got national attention in 1996 when he
protested the distribution of New Testament Bibles by The Gideons
in Waynesboro elementary schools.
	   He said those who consider his allegations irrelevant are
missing the point.
	   ``Many people think it's illegal but trivial,'' he said. ``I
don't think it's trivial. No religious discrimination is trivial.''
	   The American Atheists, based in Austin, Texas, supports
Silverman, spokesman Ron Barrier said.
	   ``Baseball is America's pastime,'' he said. ``I don't think
politics or religion should play any part in promotion.''

German companies face class-action suits from Jewish groups
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with government committee to monitor restitution of
Jewish property &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Fresh from concluding a billion-dollar
settlement with Swiss banks, Jewish organizations will decide soon
about filing class action suits against German companies that used
slave labor during World War II, a spokesman said Monday.
	   An official of a Jewish group pressing for compensation for
survivors of the Nazi Holocaust said the fact a U.S. lawyer has
already filed such a suit will not stop his organization from
pressing ahead with its own legal action.
	   ``We are at the beginning stages of research,'' said Yoram Dori,
spokesperson for the World Jewish Restitution Organization (WJRO).
He said a decision about the class-action suit would be made in
``weeks, not months.''
	   On Sunday, lawyer Ed Fagan filed a class action suit in New York
against several German companies. He represents Jews who were
forced to work in German factories during the war. Another lawyer
was expected to file a similar suit Monday.
	   Dori said the WJRO is going ahead with its plans. He said the
suits filed so far do not represent all the survivors.
	   The class-action suits refer to inmates in Nazi concentration
camps who were forced to work without pay for German companies
during World War II. The firms included leaders in German industry
like Volkswagen, Daimler, Krupp and others.
	   The aim would be to recover salaries that were not paid to the
workers, according to Dori.
	   The WJRO recently came to agreement with banks in Switzerland
about compensation to Holocaust survivors and heirs of victims who
deposited money in Swiss bank accounts before or during World War
II but were unable to withdraw the funds for lack of documentation.
The amount of the settlement was drls 1.25 billion.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called a meeting of
Jewish organization representatives Monday to head off possible
disputes over distribution of the money from the Swiss banks.
	   Dori said there were some technical disagreements among various
groups, but that he was sure they would be worked out.
	   Dori said the WJRO is opposed to having the Israeli government
handle the distribution. ``People everywhere are suspicious of
governments, and the Jews in Israel are no different,'' he said.
	   Following the meeting, Netanyahu's office issued a statement
that a special ministerial committee had been appointed to deal
with developments related to the restitution of Jewish property.
The committee will function in coordination with the WJRO, the
statement said.

	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Congo's western war front fell largely
quiet Monday after rebel forces withdrew over the weekend from
their last strongholds.
	   Sporadic resistance triggered firefights in a corridor of land
that runs from Kinshasa to the Atlantic coastline, but the
wholesale combat of recent weeks died off.
	   President Laurent Kabila declared victory on Monday in the west
and said his allies would now turn their attention to rebel
territory in the east.
	   ``There are no fronts left in the west, the last bastions of the
aggressors have fallen,'' state-controlled radio quoted Kabila's
cabinet director Abdoulaye Yerodia as saying.
	   Just weeks ago a rebel coalition of Tutsi fighters and
disaffected members of Kabila's military was poised to march into
Kinshasa and topple the government. The rebel forces, some of whom
helped Kabila overthrow longtime Zairian dictator Mobutu Sese Seko
last year, are trying to oust the president, accusing him of
mismanagement and corruption.
	   His capital in peril, Kabila regrouped and enlisted the help of
Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia _ a move that turned the tables on the
conflict in the west, but has also internationalized Congo's war.
	   Kabila has repeatedly said the rebel movement was a front for a
Rwandan and Ugandan invasion. On Monday he extended his charges to
tacitly accuse South Africa of complicity in the war.
	   Angola's chief of army staff Joao de Matos said Monday that his
troops were prepared to lead the battle.
	   Angolan troops and tanks rumbled into the strategic Congolese
port town of Matadi over the weekend after rebel forces deserted
their positions. They also took control of a massive power dam in
the town of Inga.
	   Electricity in Kinshasa was still off due to a technical fault
in the power lines linking the capital to Inga, the dam's director
Daniel Yeuga Massawpu said.
	   Kabila on Monday was in Namibia, where he denounced South Africa
for selling tons of guns and ammunition to Rwanda. South Africa
denied Kabila's claim that the weapons sold to Rwanda were used by
the rebels.
	   After meeting Kabila, Namibia's President Sam Nujoma said Monday
that hostile foreign forces had been expelled from Congo.
	   Nujoma did not specify the nationality of the foreign forces
that had been expelled. But in the past, Kabila has charged that
Uganda and Rwanda have invaded Congo to back a month-old
insurrection trying to unseat his government.
	   Other foreign troops from Namibia, Zimbabwe and Angola have been
backing Kabila.
	   Nujoma said expulsion of the hostile troops was one conditions
set by Kabila for discussing peace proposals.
	   Meanwhile, Yerodia said a counteroffensive in the east was in
the works _ a push that would move this central African country's
civil war away from the capital and into rebel terrain.
	   ``Our Angolan and Zimbabwean allies are here to kick out the
Rwanda-Ugandan aggressors,'' Yerodia said. ``They are not selective
about where they have to do that.''
	   The rebels acknowledged the loss of Matadi and Inga, but said
they would reorganize and wage a guerrilla war that could drag on
for months or years.
	   ``The government forces would've been by now completely out if
were not for the Angolans and Zimbabweans,'' rebel leader Ernest
Wamba dia Wamba told The Associated Press.
	   ``But they cannot stay long. And we're going to continue
fighting no matter what,'' he said.

Dokes arrested on charges of beating, sexually assaulting fiancee
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAS VEGAS (AP) _ Former heavyweight champion Michael Dokes was
arrested Monday after police said he viciously beat his fiancee,
then held her against her will before sexually assaulting her.
	   Dokes, who has a history of drug problems and run-ins with
police, was booked on several felony charges after the victim went
to a local hospital for treatment of her injuries.
	   Police said the woman was viciously beaten in the face, and was
treated for multiple facial fractures.
	   ``I've never seen anybody walk out of the ring after fighting
Michael Dokes that looked this bad,'' Las Vegas Police Lt. Tom
Monahan said. ``Her face was so badly beaten and swollen it was
unrecognizable from the photo on her driver's license.''
	   Monahan said the woman, whose name was not released because of
the nature of the crime, was beaten after an argument with Dokes in
the home the two shared in a middle class Las Vegas neighborhood.
	   The victim told police she was beaten and then held against her
will for several hours. Prior to being released, she said she was
sexually assaulted.
	   She was released from the hospital after being treated for her
injuries.
	   Dokes was booked into the Clark County Detention Center on
charges of sexual assault, attempted murder and false imprisonment.
	   Dokes won the heavyweight title at the age of 24 in December
1982, when referee Joey Curtis made a controversial decision to
stop his fight with champion Mike Weaver with Weaver taking a
beating in the first round.
	   An admitted problem with cocaine helped him lose the WBA title
only nine months later to Gerrie Coetzee, however, and Dokes never
held the heavyweight crown again.
	   Once regarded by many as one of the most promising young
fighters in the game, Dokes succumbed to a cocaine habit that cut
the promise short.
	   Having fought back from cocaine addiction to resume his career
in 1987 after a layoff of 33 months, Dokes suffered a relapse in
1991. He was arrested in Las Vegas on cocaine charges. It was his
third arrest on drug charges, and he was given a suspended sentence
and placed on five years probation.
	   He also was warned by the judge that if he was caught doing
drugs again, he would go to prison.
	   Dokes came back for one last shot at the big time, getting a
February 1993 shot at the heavyweight title against Riddick Bowe.
He earned dlrs 750,000 but didn't last long, getting knocked out in
the first round by Bowe at Madison Square Garden.
	   Dokes continued to fight as late as last August, when he was
stopped in the second round of a fight in Kentucky by Paul
Phillips.

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ A star-packed Real Madrid had little
difficulty in defeating a meek, newly promoted Villareal 4-1 on
Monday to take the No.1 position in the league in the opening
round.
	   Villareal, a humble team which was founded in 1923 in the
eastern coastal town of Castellon, fought bravely throughout in the
capital's Santiago Bernabeu stadium in its first match ever in the
Spanish premier league, although without luck.
	   Villareal pressured early as its new star Romanian Gheorghe
Craioveanu, who played the last three seasons for Real Sociedad,
made it 1-0 in the 3rd minute stunning 70,000 Madrid fans at
Bernabeu.
	   But the European champions still looked strong and Raul
Gonzalez, the crowd favorite, popped in the equalizer for Madrid
after he and Yugoslav Predraj Mijatovic converged on the Villareal
goal in the 35th minute of the second half _ badly confusing the
defense.
	   Gonzalez's goal was followed by one by Mijatovic in the 50th
minute, just one minute after forward Moises Garcia was expelled
for accumulating yellow cards, reducing Villareal to ten players.
Brazilian striker Savio put in the third goal ten minutes later.
	   Raul Gonzalez added another goal in the 67th-minute to give Real
Madrid its first win of the year.
	   Madrid coach Guus Hiddink, happy with the talent he already has
at Madrid _ including Croatia's Davor Suker and Brazilians Roberto
Carlos and Savio _ has limited Madrid's new foreign signings to
Croatian midfielder Robert Jarni, who made his Bernabeu debut
Monday.
	   Real Madrid, winner of 27 League titles, will try this season to
regain the domestic title from arch-rival Barcelona, which drew
with modest Racing de Santander in the Spanish first division's
opening round on Sunday.
	   In other games Sunday, it was: Zaragoza 2, Athletic de Bilbao
0;Espanyol 2, Tenerife 1; Real Sociedad 3 Oviedo 3; Salamanca 0,
Mallorca 0; Celta 0, Deportivo de La Coruna 0, Extremadura 0,
Valladolid 0.
	   On Saturday, Valencia beat Atletico de Madrid 1-0 and Alaves
drew 0-0 against Betis.

Study: Ultra-low-fat diets may not further reduce heart risk
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SUSAN MONTOYA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DALLAS (AP) _ Cutting back on fatty foods like cheeseburgers and
fries reduces the risk of heart disease. So cutting way back is
even better, right?
	   Not necessarily, according to a report published Tuesday in
Circulation, a journal of the American Heart Association.
	   Dr. Linda Van Horn, co-author of the report, said researchers do
not have enough data to say whether ultra-low-fat diets are
generally better at fighting heart disease than moderately low-fat
diets.
	   Ms. Van Horn, a professor at Northwestern University Medical
School, said her team reviewed all of the available studies on
ultra-low-fat diets and the data doesn't warrant the AHA to take a
more aggressive stance, Ms. Van Horn said.
	   The American Heart Association recommends that less than 30
percent of a person's calories come from fat. An ultra-low-fat diet
contains at most 15 percent of calories from fat.
	   The average American diet contains 34 percent of calories from
fat. The 30 percent target translates to 67 grams of fat for a
person who consumes about 2,000 calories per day. By way of
reference, a Big Mac contains 31 grams of fat and a Whopper has 39
grams of fat.
	   Ms. Van Horn said some studies showed impressive results in
reducing heart disease risk. However, questions remained because
some studies had few participants, follow-up was limited, concerns
persisted about long-term nutrient adequacy and it was unclear
whether the benefits would be experienced by the general
population.
	   She added that some health benefits may have resulted from
weight loss or other lifestyle factors of people who eat low-fat
diets, such as eating fruits and vegetables and exercising.
	   Dr. Montaz Wassef, who works at the National Heart, Lung and
Blood Institute in Maryland, said it would be unwise for the AHA to
recommend a substantially lower fat intake.
	   ``There isn't enough data to give a blanket recommendation for
such a low-fat diet, and I don't think you can give a blanket
recommendation,'' said Wassef, who was not associated with Ms. Van
Horn's work. ``People react differently.''
	   Previous research has found that about one-third of the U.S.
population may benefit from reducing fat intake below 30 percent,
one-third would be unaffected and the final third could actually
increase their risk of heart disease depending on genetic factors.
	   Anti-fat diet consultant Dr. Dean Ornish stood by his longtime
belief that less dietary fat is better. He recommends a maximum
intake of 10 percent of calories from fat in a diet based on
fruits, vegetables and whole grains.
	   ``By changing lifestyle and diet, most people can avoid heart
disease,'' said Ornish, president of the Preventive Medicine
Research Institute in California. ``It's most unfortunate that
Americans may get the idea that further reducing dietary fat beyond
the AHA recommendations has no value.''

Buzz returns in Miami: McGwire is in town
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With AP Photo &QL; 
 &UR; By STEVEN WINE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MIAMI (AP) _ The scene at Pro Player Stadium was reminiscent of
last year's World Series: a big crowd, a swarm of national media
and an electrifying atmosphere even during batting practice.
	   The only thing missing: the defending champions.
	   Mark McGwire arrived Monday for his only visit this season to
Miami, and a city angry about baseball became excited again. Five
extra sections in the upper deck were opened to accommodate fans
for the three-game series, and even McGwire sensed the unusual
level of anticipation.
	   ``I figured that out when someone said they were taking the
tarps off in the upper deck,'' he said with a smile.
	   McGwire came to town with 55 home runs, six shy of Roger Maris'
record, which is why the series between the Florida Marlins and St.
Louis Cardinals has attracted about 300 media _ more than for the
first round of last year's playoffs.
	   Crowds totaling more than 100,000 were expected, an impressive
figure given the resentment many Florida fans feel after the
dismantling of their team. Attendance for the season in Miami is
down 29 percent.
	   The Marlins had not one player from last year's World Series
roster in the lineup when they took the field Monday, and the
standings looked this way:
	   McGwire homers _ 55.
	   Marlins victories _ 47.
	   ``Sad,'' McGwire said. ``That's the way you have to sum it up:
sad. You win a World Series, and the next year you trade everybody
away. It's unfortunate for the fans of South Florida.
	   ``The sad thing is that you look forward to opening day when you
have the team out there on the foul line and you hand out the
rings. I think they had to mail some rings to players,'' he said.
	   But the fans are finding it difficult to stay mad at a sport
staging perhaps the greatest home-run race in history. McGwire
began the week chasing Maris, chased by Sammy Sosa, and on the
verge of catching Hack Wilson, who set the National League record
of 56 home runs in 1930.
	   As interest in the race grows, McGwire seems to become more
comfortable in the spotlight. Reporters filled the Miami Dolphins'
locker room for a 40-minute pre-game news conference, and McGwire
relaxed at a table, leaning on his enormous arms and joking about
the attention he gets.
	   ``You walk by and hear people whisper,'' he said. ``Then you
hear footsteps, and people are following you. The funny thing is
when they follow you into the bathroom.''
	   McGwire, who is divorced, said he has no interest at the moment
in a romantic relationship, despite plenty of opportunities.
	   ``I've been getting roses, but no pictures,'' he said. ``If
you're going to send flowers, send pictures.''
	   Because school has started, McGwire made the trip to Miami
without his 10-year-old son, Matthew, who is a Cardinals batboy.
But if McGwire breaks Maris' record, Matthew will be there.
	   ``I think if I get close, he'll have to miss some school,''
McGwire said with a laugh.
	   Joking aside, the Cardinals slugger recognizes the importance of
what he and Sosa are doing. Talking about it, McGwire sometimes
sounds like a fan.
	   ``What's happening is so good for baseball,'' he said. ``It's
been exciting for America to follow it.''
	   Even in Miami, the excitement is back.

Sprewell refiles suit, says NBA shredded evidence
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROB GLOSTER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ Latrell Sprewell refiled his dismissed
lawsuit on Monday, with new accusations that three NBA security
employees shredded evidence that would have exonerated him.
	   Sprewell's original dlrs 30 million lawsuit against the National
Basketball Association and the Golden State Warriors was dismissed
July 30 by a federal judge. At the time, the judge left room for
the suit to be revived but urged the player to drop it.
	   Instead, Sprewell refiled the suit in U.S. District Court,
bolstered by charges that NBA security chief Horace Balmer and two
associates destroyed notes of interviews with Sprewell's teammates
and ``intentionally suppressed important evidence for the purpose
of perpetrating fraud.''
	   Said Jeffrey Mishkin, the NBA's chief legal officer: ``Every one
of Mr. Sprewell's increasingly bizarre claims has already been
raised and rejected by both an arbitrator and a federal court. This
has now become a pathetic sideshow.''
	   Sprewell admits he choked Warriors coach P.J. Carlesimo during a
Dec. 1 practice, and that he returned to the gym about 15 minutes
later to confront Carlesimo. He claims he never hit the coach, or
tried to hit him, during the second confrontation.
	   ``I came back out to basically let P.J. know I wanted to be
traded, I wanted out,'' Sprewell said at a news conference Monday.
``I got close to P.J. and guys started grabbing me to keep me from
getting close to P.J.''
	   Sprewell said Balmer and his associates got a similar version of
the incident from telephone interviews with Golden State teammates,
but destroyed notes of those interviews. Instead, Sprewell's
lawyers contend, the NBA told arbitrator John Feerick that Sprewell
tried to attack Carlesimo a second time.
	   ``The most crucial thing that was wrong was the shredding of
documents by the NBA. They prepared a document for the arbitrator
that wasn't fair to me,'' Sprewell said. ``The league and the
Warriors haven't played by the rules.''
	   The suit also seeks to cap Sprewell's punishment at dlrs 1
million, the amount the former All-Star guard claims he lost
because of a 10-game suspension by the Warriors.
	   Sprewell doesn't contest that suspension.
	   ``I deserve to be punished for what I did,'' he said Monday but
added that the subsequent one-year ban by the NBA was unfair and
cost him dlrs 6.4 million.
	   The suit also renews the claim that Sprewell is a victim of
racial discrimination, pointing out that most NBA team owners are
white and most players are black and that ``defendants have a
double standard whereby whites and Caucasians are treated more
favorably than blacks and African-Americans.''
	   Robert Thompson Jr., one of Sprewell's lawyers, said he hoped
there could be a hearing on the refiled lawsuit within the next few
months. Sprewell has asked for a jury trial.
	   After suspending him for 10 games, the Warriors terminated the
final three years of his contract _ potentially costing him dlrs 24
million. The NBA added a one-year suspension to those penalties,
lasting until December 1998.
	   But Feerick ruled in March that the league's punishment was
excessive and ordered Sprewell reinstated July 1, cutting his
suspension to 68 games. Feerick also voided the Warriors'
termination of the contract.
	   Sprewell apologized again Monday for attacking Carlesimo.
	   ``I was wrong in what I did and I really should have done a
better job of handling my temper,'' he said.
	   And Sprewell said the lawsuit above all was an effort to regain
his reputation as an All-Star player and not as a hothead.
	   ``People think I'm almost like a maniac on the court,'' he said.
``People have this perception of me as an evil person, a bad
person. People look at me now like I'm the symbol for the bad boy
of the NBA.''

Study: Radioactive implants effective long-term treatment for
</HEADLINE>
prostate cancer &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout to move up questions of study's conclusion,
ADD that there was no comparison group, ADD detail of criticism &QL; 
 &UR; By PATRICIA J. MAYS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTA (AP) _ Implanting radioactive seeds in the prostate to
treat early stages of cancer may be as effective over the long run
as surgery and more effective than external beam radiation, a new
study suggests.
	   Some questioned the conclusion of the study.
	   With brachytherapy, tiny seeds of radioactive material are
injected into the prostate to shrink the cancer from within.
Patients treated with this method run a lower risk of urinary
incontinence or impotence than with surgery, one of the most common
ways to treat prostate cancer.
	   Until now, however, there had been no evidence of the long-term
value of brachytherapy.
	   Without a comparison group, such studies are unlikely to prove
beyond doubt that a particular treatment is better or worse than
others. In this case, doctors did not directly compare
brachytherapy with surgery in men who were the same age and had the
same stage of disease.
	   The study conducted at Northwest Hospital in Seattle looked at
152 men 10 years after they were treated with radioactive seeds
and, in some cases, beams of radiation from outside the body.
	   Five patients couldn't be located 10 years later. Of the 147
others, 97 _ or 64 percent of the original number _ remained free
of disease and had low levels of prostate-specific antigen, or PSA,
which can be an early signal of the cancer. Only three patients
died of prostate cancer.
	   ``It shows that brachytherapy is a proven, viable option for
treating clinically localized prostate cancer,'' said Dr. Haakon
Ragde, lead author of the study. ``This is just as effective as the
best surgical results and is more effect than conventional
radiation beam results.''
	   The study, published in Tuesday's edition of the journal Cancer,
is the first to observe brachytherapy patients for a full 10 years,
said Ragde, a urologist at the Seattle hospital's Northwest
Prostate Institute.
	   Earlier studies cited by Ragde showed that 13 percent to 38
percent of patients treated only with external beam radiation were
disease-free after 10 years. Among patients whose prostates were
surgically removed, those studies showed disease-free survival
rates of 47 percent to 73 percent, Ragde said.
	   An estimated 184,500 American men will get the disease this year
and about 39,200 will die, the American Cancer Society estimates.
It is the second leading cancer killer among U.S. men after lung
cancer.
	   In 1995, 34.1 percent of prostate cancer patients underwent
radical prostatectomy, or surgical removal of the prostate. An
additional 26.3 percent were treated with external beam radiation
and only 2.2 percent with brachytherapy.
	   ``With this data, many men are now going to be opting for seed
implantation because of the numerous advantages it has in terms of
reduced morbidity, impotence and incontinence,'' said Dr. Subir
Nag, president of the American Brachytherapy Society.
	   But Dr. Kevin Loughlin, director of the Prostate Center at
Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, called the study incomplete
and misleading and said the 10-year survival rate with surgery is
actually about 80 percent.
	   ``I think this whole paper is really suspect,'' Loughlin said.
	   Loughlin said too many patients were lost to follow-up, the
cancers in the patients were nonaggressive, their initial PSA
levels were low and that many of the patients _ whose ages ranged
from 53 to 92 _ were too old.

Rival Iraqi Kurdish groups agree to establish autonomous
</HEADLINE>
government &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Rival Iraqi Kurdish groups have agreed to
establish an autonomous government in the region, said a Spanish
deputy on Monday just back from visiting Northern Iraq.
	   Pedro Marset, a deputy of Spain's third biggest parliamentary
group, United Left, said both sides, the Kurdistan Democratic
Party, or KDP, and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, will be ready
to sign the agreement in Washington on Sept. 18-19.
	   ``They have agreed to sign an agreement that will give the Kurds
a democratic autonomous region,'' said Marset, who traveled on Aug.
23 to 29 to Kurdish autonomous zone of northern Iraq and Damask,
Syria, as part of a delegation of United Left politicians invited
by Irak's Communist Party.
	   The two Iraqi Kurdish parties have wrestled for control of the
autonomous zone since the western allies created it after the Iraqi
government suppressed a Kurdish revolt in 1991.
	   Recently their executives have tried to push forward a
U.S.-brokered cease-fire signed in May 1997.
	   According to Marset, the agreement allows for elections to
choose the representatives of the autononous institutions of the
region, of which the United States and Great Britain keep an aerial
mission that prevents any attack of Iraqui troops of president
Sadam Hussein.
	   The spokesmen of the two Kurdish factions contacted in London by
phone refused to confirm that an agreement is imminent, saying
reconcilliation efforts are still going on.
	   ``At this juncture there are reconcilliation plans under
discussion,'' said a PUK spokesman who did not wish to be
identified.
	   But he and a spokesman for the KDP confirmed that the leaders of
their factions will travel to Washington in mid-September for
face-to-face talks mediated by senior U.S. administration
officials. They refused to elaborate.

<TEXT>
	   ST. JOHN'S, Antigua (AP) _ Trinidadian fast bowler Ian Bishop, a
stalwart of 43 Tests and 161 wickets, was named captain of a
15-member West Indies A team to tour India in November and
December, the West Indies Cricket Board announced Monday.
	   The 30-year-old Bishop, who lost form and his place during
England's tour of the Caribbean earlier this year, is among five
players on the team with Test experience.
	   Opening batsman Sherwin Campbell, another player discarded
during the England series, is joined by his Barbadian colleagues,
left-handed batsman Floyd Reifer and wicket-keeper Courtney Browne.
	   Leg-spinner Rawl Lewis, whose one Test cap was on the senior
tour of Pakistan last winter, completes the quintet.
	   Right-handed batsmen Richard Smith, Keith Semple and 20-year-old
wicket-keeper Wayne Phillip earn their first overseas assignments
at this level.
	   The WICB said that negotiations were still taking place
regarding a visit to Bangladesh prior to the India series.
	   The squad: Ian Bishop (captain), Richard Smith (Trinidad &AMP;
Tobago); Sherwin Campbell, Floyd Reifer, Adrian Griffith, Courtney
Browne, Pedro Collins (Barbados); Wavel Hinds (Jamaica); Ramnaresh
Sarwan, Neil McGarrell, Keith Semple, Reon King (Guyana); Wayne
Phillip, Rawl Lewis (Windward Islands); Carl Tuckett (Leeward
Islands).
	   The dates: Nov. 15 - arrive; Nov. 18-20 - vs. Board President's
XI at BCCI, Mumbai; Nov. 23-25 - vs. BCCI Youth Team at Pune; Nov.
28-Dec. 1 - 1st Test at Wankhede Stadium, Mumbai; Dec. 4-7 - 2nd

As crowds line up, museums prepare to ship Van Goghs to Washington
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos WX110-WX112 &QL; 
 &UR; By CARL HARTMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Shipping 70 paintings by Vincent van Gogh from
Amsterdam for a blockbuster U.S. exhibit is a little like
transporting a heart for transplant, or deploying a nuclear weapon
_ careful temperature control, total secrecy.
	   As crowds line up for tickets for a show of the great Dutch
impressionist that begins in October, the National Gallery of Art
is putting the finishing touches on the hundreds of millions of
dollars of insurance and security needed to make it happen.
	   Are Van Gogh's masterworks coming by air or by sea? Dutch and
American museums won't say. Nor will they say when the pictures
will be moved, or what protection they'll have.
	   They will talk about climate. Sjaar van Heugten, acting head of
the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, said the wooden traveling cases
must be left in his building at least 24 hours to ``acclimatize''
them to a temperature of 66 to 70 degrees Fahrenheit (19-21
Celsius). Only then can he put the precious paintings inside.
	   ``The worst thing that can happen to a painting is temperature
shock,'' Heugten said.
	   Van Gogh has been called the greatest Dutch painter after
Rembrandt, and a single Van Gogh painting has sold for dlrs 82.5
million. So 70 of his pictures would be worth billions if they ever
hit the market, which is unlikely. Museum authorities refuse to put
a dollar value on the pictures, which will travel to Los Angeles
next year after the Washington exhibit.
	   ``In principle, our collection has no value because we will
never sell it,'' Heugten said.
	   The U.S. museums won't say how much they are paying to borrow
the pictures, made possible because the Amsterdam museum is closing
for eight months of repair and expansion.
	   ``Museum people don't like to talk about dollar figures,'' said
Alice M. Whelihan, who runs an insurance program provided by the
federal government. It supplements the private policies taken out
by museums.
	   The U.S. government's liability is limited to dlrs 300 million
for any one exhibit, but Whelihan said security kept her from
specifying the liability on this one.
	   Of the Amsterdam museum's 200 paintings, an additional 80 will
go temporarily to the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam and another dozen to
the town of Enschede. The rest will stay in storage.
	   The U.S. show will include pictures of the famous austere but
brightly colored bedroom Van Gogh rented in the southern French
city of Arles, and the nearby yellow house where he hoped in vain
to set up a colony of like-minded painters.
	   The first painting visitors will see is the somber group of poor
Dutch peasants called ``The Potato Eaters,'' one of the early
works. There will also the wheat field with an agitated flight of
crows _ probably the last thing Van Gogh painted before his
suicide.
	   To handle crowd control, Sandra Creighton, in charge of visitor
services at the gallery, is hiring 55 extra staff members.
	   ``That's not security,'' she said. ``We monitor the visitors
closely and keep in touch by walkie-talkie, with messages like 'How
crowded is your room now?'''
	   As for security, gallery spokeswoman Deborah Ziska would only
say that she never discusses it. ``We are taking the appropriate
measures,'' she said.
	   The paintings will be covered with glass, presumably to protect
them from the slashings that damaged a Van Gogh in 1978 and other
Dutch paintings more recently.
	   The gallery expects up to 400,000 people during the three-month
show. And anticipation is clearly high.
	   By 11 a.m. on Sunday, a line of more than 600 had circled the
gallery's East Building, waiting for the doors to open so they
could pick up the first advance passes. Some had come before dawn.
The line was almost as long Monday.
	   Admission is free, and 300 passes will be issued for each
half-hour of a seven-hour day. About 200 will be free passes given
out at the museum itself. The other 100 can be had through a
commercial ticket service, for a small fee.Any not sold or given
out in advance will be available at the museum each day.
	   No advance passes will be given out for the first hour of each
day, so that people in line each morning when the museum opensdon't
wait in vain. They'll get ``same-day'' passes.
	   ``I want all those people to get in,'' Ms. Creighton said.
	   ____
	   ``Van Gogh's Van Goghs'' will be at the National Gallery of Art
from Oct. 4 to Jan. 3, 1999; and at the Los Angeles County Museum
of Art, Los Angeles, from Jan. 17 to April 4, 1999.

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The president of the Security Council on
Monday predicted passage for a U.S.-British-sponsored resolution
that would punish Iraq for halting cooperation with inspectors by
suspending regular reviews of sanctions.
	   But Danilo Turk of Slovenia said any resolution on the impasse
may also have to include an incentive for Iraq to resume
cooperation, such as a comprehensive review of the 8-year-old
measures.
	   Inclusion of the comprehensive review would allow council
members more sympathetic to Baghdad _ France, China and Russia _ to
agree to a suspension of the regular sanctions.
	   A U.S.-British draft makes no mention of the comprehensive
review, calling only for the suspension of regular reviews. Without
the regular reviews, Iraq has no chance of having sanctions lifted.
	   ``I think that this resolution has very good chances to
succeed,'' Turk said. ``I'm not saying that it would succeed easily
or that it would succeed very soon.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ In a bold act of brinkmanship, North Korea on
Monday launched a new long-range ballistic missile that crossed
over Japan's main island and crashed into the Pacific Ocean.
	   A Japanese defense official said the missile appears to have had
two stages, with the second probably flying over the northern tip
of Japan's main island and landing several hundred kilometers (a
few hundred miles) off its Pacific coast.
	   The first stage apparently dropped into the sea about 300
kilometers (180 miles) southeast of Vladivostok, Russia, said
Defense Agency spokesman Toru Kawajiri.
	   Kawajiri said the missile was believed to be a ``Daepodong I,''
a new and much more powerful rocket than the North had ever tested.
	   The launch comes just ahead of the convening of North Korea's
new parliament this Saturday for a congress expected to anoint
leader Kim Jong Il as the reclusive communist nation's president.
	   It also comes as North Korea and the United States are involved
in talks in New York over giving the North two badly needed
civilian nuclear reactors in return for it suspending missile and
atomic weapon development efforts.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, visiting Sarajevo,
said she was alarmed.
	   ``This is something that we will be raising with North Koreans
in the talks that are currently going on,'' she said.
	   Some Korea watchers, however, said the timing was likely a
bargaining ploy.
	   ``Kim is good at brinkmanship,'' said Hajime Izumi, a professor
at Shizuoka University. ``From Kim's perspective, this missile is
an important tool for gaining leverage, and he can use it to strike
a deal with the United States.''
	   Izumi said the North may also use threats to export the new
missile to countries such as Iran and Libya to extract a more
concessions.
	   But the test-launch threatened to backfire for the
cash-strapped, famine-devastated North.
	   Japan abruptly withdrew plans to extend dlrs 1 billion in aid to
the North to build the two civilian nuclear power reactors.
	   Japan also said it will confer soon with the United States and
South Korea, who are to put up most of the rest of the reactors'
dlrs 4.6 billion cost, about whether to continue with the aid
project.
	   The launch just after noon (0300 GMT) was confirmed by Japanese,
South Korean and United States defense officials. It was North
Korea's first test-firing of a missile in five years and its fourth
since 1984.
	   Monday's launch, however, was the first by North Korea of a
two-stage missile and marks a significant step forward in its
rocket technology. Japan's state-run NHK TV said the missile may
have been powerful enough to exit the Earth's atmosphere before
streaking back down toward the Pacific.
	   ``We see this as a very dangerous act,'' said chief government
spokesman Hiromu Nonaka.
	   Masahiro Akiyama, deputy director of Japan's Defense Agency,
said the launch was not totally a surprise _ security experts, he
said, had been increasing their surveillance of the North since
earlier this month.
	   Also, North Korea notified Russia in advance of the planned
firing of a ballistic missile, Russia's Interfax news agency quoted
Vladimir Yakovlev, commander of Russian strategic rocketry, as
saying.
	   ``However, the missile inadvertently changed its path and was
not observed by Russian tracking hardware,'' Yakovlev said,
according to Interfax.
	   But very little is known about North Korea's missile program,
and its possession of a significantly better missile would be a
matter of serious concern throughout the region.
	   North Korea's best-known ballistic missile is the Rodong, which
has a range of about 1,000 kilometers (620 miles). It was last test
fired in 1993, and also landed in the same area of the Sea of
Japan, which divides the Korean Peninsula from Japan.
	   The Daepodong missile launched Monday has the range to hit
almost any target in Japan and most cities in China.
	   According to Jane's Strategic Weapon Systems, the North is
developing a more powerful version of the Daepodong that may be
able to fly 6,000 kilometers (3,750 miles) _ far enough to hit
southern Alaska.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ A look at the sights and sounds of the U.S.
Open.
 &UR; STARS
	   _ Michael Chang captured his first title of 1998, the MFS Pro
Championships in Brookline, Mass., with a 6-3, 6-4 victory over
Paul Haarhuis.
	   _ Steffi Graf beat Jana Novotna 6-4, 6-1 to win the Pilot Pen in
New Haven, Connecticut, her first title since May 1997.
	   _ Patrick Rafter won the Hamlet Cup in Commack, New York, by
defeating Felix Mantilla 7-6 (7-3), 6-2.
	   ___
 &UR; SPEAKING
	   ``It's been a long way, but it's special to be here right now,
to be at this point.'' _ Steffi Graf, after winning the Pilot Pen
International.
	   ``I definitely have a chance to win if the draw opens up a bit.
I have to keep my energy level up, especially if the weather
continues hot and humid, as it has been here.'' _ Patrick Rafter,
defending U.S. Open champion.
	   ``My goal this year is definitely to win the tournament. I think
there is no other options available.'' _ Venus Williams.
	   ``You can't look ahead, that's kind of the kiss of death.'' _
Pete Sampras, a four-time U.S. Open champion.
	   ``Beatings ... there have been more of them than anyone can
imagine.'' _ Mirjana Lucic, saying why she, her four siblings and
her mother left her father and moved from Croatia to the United
States.
	   ``If I slammed her, that was because she didn't behave nicely,
never because of tennis.'' _ Marinko Lucic, explaining why he hit
his daughter, Mirjana Lucic.
	   ___
 &UR; STREAKING
	   When Steffi Graf captured the Pen Pilot International in New
Haven, Connecticut, it kept alive her streak of winning at least
one tournament title in each of the last 13 years, beginning in
1985. That makes her third on the list. Martina Navratilova leads
by winning a title for 21 consecutive years, 1974-94, with Chris
Evert second with 16 years, 1971-86. Tied for fourth with 10
consecutive years of winning at least one tournament are Evonne
Goolagong and Sandra Cecchini.
	   ___
 &UR; SWARMING TO THE ACTION
	   The Arantxa Sanchez Vicario-Julie Halard-Decugis match at the
Pilot Pen International in New Haven, Connecticut, drew a lot of
attention. Play was suspended for almost an hour when a horde of
small bugs joined the crowd of 7,138 paying fans at center court.
The uncommon disruption was the only blight on another Sanchez
Vicario victory.
	   ___
 &UR; SOMEONE FAMILIAR?
	   The U.S. Open came close to having two players named Conchita
Martinez in the women's singles draw this year. Seventh-seeded
Conchita Martinez of Spain will face Miriam Oremans of the
Netherlands in her first-round match. But Conchita
Martinez-Granados, also of Spain, lost in the final round of
qualifying to Miriam Schnitzer of Germany.
	   ___
 &UR; STARTING THE DAY
	   The New York Stock Exchange began its week with Monica Seles
ringing the bell. The three-time U.S. Open champion was accompanied
to Wall Street by Chase Manhattan Bank Chief Executive Officer
Walter Shipley. Chase is the sponsor of the women's singles
championships at the U.S. Open, is the title sponsor for the
season-ending Chase Championships at New York's Madison Square
Garden, and is a year-round corporate partner of the Corel WTA
Tour.
	   ___
 &UR; STRAIGHT HOME
	   Rod Laver is back home in Newport Beach, California, much sooner
than his doctors expected following a stroke. Dr. Eric Aldrich, a
neurologist, said the tennis star will undergo therapy at home for
up to a year. T

Sampras swaggers in Grand Slam quest
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: will be UPDATED in RECAP &QL; 
 &UR; By LARRY SIDDONS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ He was dressed all in white, but that was no
country-club gentleman out there on the Stadium Court at the U.S.
Open. Pete Sampras was a tennis dude with attitude as he started
his quest for Grand Slam history.
	   Showing a little more of his top-ranked game with each
changeover, Sampras swaggered into the second round Monday, tossing
aside the big serves of Marc Goellner for a 6-3, 6-2, 6-2 victory.
	   This wasn't the best Sampras, the one who took Wimbledon for the
fifth time last month and is trying to add a fifth U.S. title _ and
record-tying 12th Grand Slam singles crown.
	   It didn't have to be. Goellner, a 27-year-old German, last won a
match more than two months ago, a five-set victory over Jordi
Burillo of Spain in the first round at Wimbledon. His game consists
almost entirely of a first serve that reaches 115 mph (185 kmh) if
he's on, and against Sampras much more is needed.
	   Sampras had 11 aces and dropped just 15 points on his serve,
clocking one first-set ace at 131 mph. He didn't allow Goellner,
ranked 109th in the world, a break point, and toyed with him from
both baseline and net in winning in just 84 minutes on a
brilliantly sunny afternoon.
	   ``You just try to get through the early rounds,'' said Sampras,
eliminated in the fourth round a year ago. ``It's nice to get that
monkey off your back and get into the tournament. I tried to stay
focused and I think I did.''
	   Six more wins over the next two weeks at the Open and Sampras
joins Roy Emerson as the only players to win an even dozen Grand
Slam singles tournaments, the milestone the tradition-minded
Californian treasures above all others.
	   ``What more can you do in the game? Win the French Open, maybe,
or all four Slams in one year,'' said Sampras. The French Open, on
clay, is the only Grand Slam tournament Sampras has not won.
	   ``I'm thinking of entering the ladies' tournament next year,''
he said. ``Maybe I can get lucky and win that.''
	   Adding a second Grand Slam title for the year also would do
plenty to clinch the No. 1 ranking for the season, the sixth
straight year that would end with Sampras on top, breaking the
record he shares with Jimmy Connors.
	   ``All those records are important to me,'' Sampras said. ``I'm
not focused on this tournament any more than any U.S. Open, but I
hope to get some things done over the next two weeks.''
	   No fighting words there, nothing for defending champion Patrick
Rafter, No. 2 Marcelo Rios or any other challenger to hang on the
refrigerator for inspiration.
	   Sampras is no trash-talker. But he has an edge, and the crowd
that half-filled the 20,000-seat Arthur Ashe Stadium saw it a
couple times against Goellner.
	   Meek Pete looked positively McEnroesque as he stared down a line
judge he felt missed an ace. He smirked at the umpire, and tried to
get the fans who remained in the third set back into the match,
waving his arms like a cheerleader.
	   He even took a light shot at Emerson, the storied Aussie who won
a large share of his Slams while Rod Laver was on the sidelines in
the dispute between amateur tennis and the emerging professionals.
	   ``I am not trying to take anything away from Emerson and what he
did, but the competition is probably tougher today than it was 30
years ago,'' he said. ``Laver could have had 15 or 20.''
	   That's not dissing anyone or stepping out of character, Sampras
said. Just responding to the surroundings.
	   ``This is the most hectic of the Grand Slams,'' he said. ``You
walk out at Wimbledon and you feel the history. You walk out here
and you feel the electricity.''
	   The player Sampras beat at Wimbledon, 14th-seeded Goran
Ivanisevic, had 23 aces in a 6-3, 6-4, 6-4 victory over Australia's
Mark Woodforde, who dismissed the bearded Croatian as a tennis
equivalent of a one-hit wonder.
	   ``I don't see what the attraction is,'' said Woodforde, who has
won 10 Grand Slam doubles titles. ``If I was paying my money to go
to the U.S. Open, I wouldn't sit next to his court.''
	   Defending women's champion Martina Hingis beat Aleksandra Olsza
of Poland 6-2, 6-0, completing a straight-set afternoon on the main
court. The Swiss teen-ager, who won the Australian Open in January
but has struggled recently, said she hoped the Open would turn
things around.
	   ``I'm definitely not as confident as I was last year,'' Hingis
said. ``Last year was better. This year is not as bad as I hear.
... This is the last Grand Slam of the year and you put all your
energy into this tournament.''
	   Serena Williams, the younger of the tennis-phenom sisters from
Palm Beach Gardens, Fla., rallied from a break down in the third
set to beat Nicole Pratt of Australia 6-3, 3-6, 6-4.
	   The only seeded player among early starters to lose on opening
day was men's No. 15 Alberto Berasategui of Spain, eliminated by
Thomas Muster, a former top-ranked player, 7-6 (7-1), 6-2, 6-3.

Council expresses concern about Congo, president admits its not

 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The U.N. Security Council condemned
reported executions of civilians in Congo and called Monday for an
immediate cease-fire, but the council president acknowledged the
call was insufficient considering the bloodshed in the African
nation.
	   The council expressed its deep concern about the current
conflict and alarm at the plight of the civilian population in a
presidential statement endorsed by all 15 members.
	   Earlier at a special, closed council meeting, Congo's minister
of planning, Badimanyi Mulumba, sought stronger action, in the form
of a resolution that specifically called on Rwanda and Uganda to
withdraw their forces from Congo, Western diplomats said.
	   Unlike statements, resolutions have the weight of international
law behind them.
	   Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia have acknowledged supporting
Congolese President Laurent Kabila while Rwanda and Uganda are
accused of backing the rebels who want to oust him. Rwanda and
Uganda deny the charge.
	   On Monday, Kabila declared victory in the western war front and
said his allies were turning their attention to rebel territory in
the east.
	   Monday's statement called for an immediate cease-fire, the
withdrawal of all foreign forces and the start of talks ``with a
view to national reconciliation.''
	   The council ``condemns reported summary executions, torture
harassment and detention of civilians based on their ethic origin,
the recruitment of cihild soldiers, the killing or wounding of
combatants who have laid down their weapons, hate propaganda,
sexual violence and other abuses by any side,'' the statement said.
	   The Security Council has delegated responsibility for the Congo
conflict to regional organizations such as the Southern African
Development Community, which has been trying to negotiate an end to
the war.
	   But Danilo Turk of Slovenia, speaking at his final news
conference as council president, said the council should reconsider
its strategy. Similar efforts to delegate responsibility for the
Kosovo conflict to regional organizations had also failed to
produce results, Turk said.
	   ``Although the council relies very heavily on the initiative
within the (South African) group, realistically speaking one should
not expect too much,'' he said. ``The council would have to ask
itself whether it is the best and wisest option to rely on regional
organizations.''
	   U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
council would probably take up the issue again after the Nonaligned
Movement comes up with recommendations at its summit this week in
Durban, South Africa.

Kosovo burns while Europe on vacation? council president wonders
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Inaction in the face of evidence of a
grave humanitarian disaster in Kosovo may be attributed to the
European predilection for lengthy summer holidays, the Security
Council president suggested Monday.
	   ``Europe seems to have been vacationing mostly in August,''
Danilo Turk of Slovenia said. ``Very little was said let alone
done.''
	   Turk was responding to reporters' questions about whether he
felt the Security Council could have done more to contain conflicts
in Kosovo and Congo in the month that he was council president.
	   The council has taken relatively little action on either issue,
relying on regional organizations to work out the conflicts. In the
case of Kosovo, the council has delegated authority to NATO, the
Contact Group of states and U.S. envoys to bring ethnic Albanian
separatists and Serb officials together.
	   ``It is disappointing that the regional organizations did not
even pronounce themselves,'' Turk said. ``In a situation when the
council relies so heavily on regional organizations, this is a very
serious problem.''
	   Hundreds of people have been killed on both sides since a Serb
crackdown began in late February. More than 260,000 have been
rendered homeless by the fighting. Western governments have
threatened to use force against the Serbs to stop the offensive,
but have yet to follow through.
	   ``The real problem is not whether the council would approve or
otherwise provide legal framework for possible military action.
That's the secondary problem,'' Turk said. ``The primary problem is
that the countries which have the means at their disposal and the
organizational capacity to do it are divided.''
	   Slovenia was the first country to break from the former
Yugoslavia in a 10-day war in 1991.

Police round up activists promoting peace with Kurdish rebels
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with release of activists in 5th graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Riot police detained some 120 activists on
Monday who planned to ride buses on a peace mission to the
southeast to promote a political solution to the Turkish-Kurdish
war there, an activist said.
	   The activists were planning to reach the main southeastern city
of Diyarbakir by buses on Tuesday to coincide with the start of a
unilateral Kurdish rebel cease-fire.
	   ``They rounded up us before we could get on the buses,'' said
Osman Baydemir, an official from the independent Human Rights
Association.
	   Baydemir, who was among the detained, spoke from the police
station by mobile phone.
	   Authorities released all the activists after questioning, the
Anatolia news agency reported.
	   The Turkish government, which blocked a similar initiative last
year, insisted the peace mission was a thinly disguised propaganda
ploy by Kurdish rebels.
	   Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz has already rejected the truce offer
by Kurdish rebels, announced on Friday, calling on them to
surrender and end their 14-year war for autonomy.
	   The government will not negotiate with the rebels, saying they
are terrorists.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Despite doomsday warnings that Russia faces
collapse, angry lawmakers on Monday emphatically rejected Boris
Yeltsin's candidate for prime minister, blocking the formation of a
government to try to pull the country out of its economic and
political tailspin. The lopsided vote against confirming Viktor
Chernomyrdin deepens a dangerous deadlock between the president and
the parliament and leaves Russia in chaos as U.S. President Clinton
arrives Tuesday for an ill-timed summit. Russia has been without a
government since Aug. 23, when Yeltsin fired Prime Minister Sergei
Kiriyenko in the midst of an economic crisis that has crippled the
ruble and stocks, threatened to bring down its banking and
financial system and sent an earthquake through world markets.
(RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ North Korea's launch of a long-range ballistic
missile over Japan and into the Pacific Ocean _ its first use of
such a two-stage weapon _ is a dangerous development for the
volatile region's security, U.S. officials said Monday. The missile
test ``is something that we will be raising with North Koreans'' in
talks in New York, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said
during a visit to Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital. A session was
scheduled for Monday afternoon. At the State Department, spokesman
Lee McClenny called the launch ``a matter of deep concern to the
United States because of its potentially destabilizing impact in
Northeast Asia and beyond.'' The missile, dubbed Taepo Dong 1, has
a range of 1,500 kilometers, or about 940 miles, and is capable of
reaching all of South Korea and Japan. (US-NKOREA)
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ A bomb packed with nails and hidden in a
television set exploded near a popular marketplace in Algiers on
Monday, killing at least 17 people and injuring about 60. Hospital
sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, put the death toll at
20, whereas security forces said in a statement that 17 had died.
The explosion ripped through a packed square in the neighborhood of
Bab-el-Oued, considered a stronghold of Muslim fundamentalists. It
sent people running through the streets in panic; at least 10 of
the injured were hurt in the stampede. Ambulances rushed to the
scene, and police cordoned off the surrounding area. Two hours
after the explosion, ambulance workers were still ferrying people
to hospitals. There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but
suspicion fell on militants waging the Islamic insurgency against
the military-backed government, now in its seventh year. (ALGERIA)
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Police hoped to locate 20 villages that
reportedly disappeared Monday in floodwaters, as aid workers pulled
bloated bodies from the turbulent waters submerging a wide swathe
of northern India. Officials in Lucknow, the Uttar Pradesh state
capital, put the death toll at 1,086 on Monday. At least 32 people
drowned in different parts of the state Sunday and Monday and 34
others died in a cholera epidemic caused by the flood, said Ram
Kumar Yadav, a senior official in the state's Interior Department.
(INDIA-FLOODS)
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Congo's western war front fell largely
quiet Monday after rebel forces withdrew over the weekend from
their last strongholds. Sporadic resistance triggered firefights in
a corridor of land that runs from Kinshasa to the Atlantic
coastline, but the wholesale combat of recent weeks died off.
President Laurent Kabila declared victory on Monday in the west and
said his allies would now turn their attention to rebel territory
in the east. ``There are no fronts left in the west, the last
bastions of the aggressors have fallen,'' state-controlled radio
quoted Kabila's cabinet director Abdoulaye Yerodia as saying. Just
weeks ago a rebel coalition of Tutsi fighters and disaffected
members of Kabila's military was poised to march into Kinshasa and
topple the government. (CONGO)

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The Dow Jones industrials suffered their
second-biggest point loss ever Monday, amid news of a parliamentary
showdown in Russia and North Korea's apparent firing of a missile
over part of Japan. The Dow blue-chip industrial index lost 512.61
points _ or 6.4 percent _ to close at 7,539.07, wiping out all of
its gains for the year and nearly 20 percent below its all-time
closing high last July 17 of 9,337.97. The Dow ended 1997 at
7,908.25. The market took wide and deep hits as investors continued
last week's rush to the exit doors, leaving the broad indexes
sharply lower as well. (US-CLOSING STOCKS)
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Doubts about Russia's economic and political
stability kept pressure on financial markets around the world.
Russia's parliament Monday overwhelmingly rejected the appointment
of Viktor Chernomyrdin as prime minister. Share prices fell in
Europe, undercut by Wall Street's sharp morning retreat. Major
stock indexes fell sharply earlier in Hong Kong and Singapore, but
Japan posted a modest gain after dropping to a 12-year low Friday.
In Europe, a key index of German stock prices closed down 2.3
percent and leading market gauges also finished lower in France,
Italy, Switzerland and the Netherlands. Hong Kong's key Hang Seng
Index sank 5.7 percent in the first seven minutes of trading Monday
and ended the day with a 7.1 percent decline, falling 554.70 points
to 7,275.04. (WORLD MARKETS)
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Russia remains on course to join the World Trade
Organization despite the economic chaos ravaging the country, a
Russian official said Monday. Talks with other governments about
Russian membership were held last month in Geneva and the process
is continuing, he said. ``We are looking forward to joining this
organization,'' the official, based at the Russian mission to
international organizations in Geneva, said on condition of
anonymity. ``I think there is no change.'' Also Monday, WTO
Director-General Renato Ruggiero said countries risk plunging
themselves and others into crisis if they try to limit the
turmoil's impact by slamming the door on foreign imports.
(TRADE-RUSSIA-WTO)
	   PARIS (AP) _ France's foreign minister on Monday was withholding
judgment on whether he thought the International Monetary Fund will
unfreeze its funding to Russia. He said it depended on how Moscow's
current political crisis plays out. ``I think we need to have a
complete view of this situation on the economic as well as
financial and political side,'' Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine
said in response to a reporter's question. ``So the situation is
not sufficiently clear with regard to those questions.'' ``The
whole question revolves around how the IMF will be able to
formulate its demands, eventual conditions, and in what form they
can be integrated by the Russian authorities in a way that at the
same time is supported by the Dumas and the Russian people.
(FRANCE-RUSSIA)
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ The Winterthur Group is selling its
reinsurance business to Bermuda-based Partner Re for 1.13 billion
Swiss francs, or dlrs 754 million, in an effort to concentrate on
its core direct insurance business. One of the main activities of
reinsurance businesses is insuring insurance companies. The sale
follows Winterthur's sale of its 51 percent stake in Australian
insurer HIH Winterthur in July. Partner Re is a unit of Partner Re
Ltd. Winterthur, Switzerland's second biggest insurance company, is
in the process of being taken over by Credit Suisse banking group.

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union's annual inflation
rate fell to 1.5 percent in July, down from 1.6 percent in July
1997, the EU's statistics agency Eurostat reported on Monday. It
added that inflation in the 11 countries that will take part in a
single European currency as of next January remained stable at 1.4
percent. Eurostat said the inflation rate of 1.5 percent in July
for all 15 EU nations compared with 1.7 percent that month for the
United States. The highest rates in July were registered in Greece
(4.8 percent), Portugal (2.8 percent) and Ireland (2.5 percent)
while lowest were France and Austria (both 0.8 percent) and Germany
(0.9 percent). (EU-INFLATION)

	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ A French soccer star arrived in Angola
Monday to promote the international campaign against land mines
championed by the late Princess Diana during her visi to this
war-devastated African nation last year.
	   David Ginola, a French international who plays for England's
Tottenham Hotspur and is a part-time model, announced in July that
he had agreed to be the public face of the International Committee
for the Red Cross campaign.
	   Ginola's visit comes a year to the day after Princess Diana died
in a car crash in Paris.
	   ``We have to keep raising the world's awareness to keep Princess
Diana's project alive, so that one day we can end this scourge
which is land mines,'' Ginola told reporters on his arrival at
Luanda airport.
	   Princess Diana, who helped give the anti-mine crusade huge
worldwide publicity, visited in January 1997 and was photographed
in a blue flak jacket and visor used by the mine clearance crews.
	   Angola, ravaged by a two-decade civil war that erupted after its
1975 independence from Portugal, is thought to have between 9 and
20 million mines concealed in its soil.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The first baby born at a government-run
hospital in eight years using in vitro fertilization has been named
Saddam in honor of the Iraqi president, the official Iraqi News
Agency reported Monday.
	   The agency said that the mother, Faten Abdel-Majid, and the
child, who weighed 4 kilograms (nearly 9 pounds) at birth on
Sunday, were in good condition.
	   The agency quoted the parents and the head of the hospital as
thanking President Saddam Hussein for ``giving life to the
test-tube unit (at the hospital) after the unjust U.N. embargo,'' a
reference to the punishing trade sanctions imposed by the United
Nations to punish Iraq for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.

	   TOLEDO, Ohio (AP) _ Joe Cocker's fans were anything but feelin'
all right when the British singer's show at the Toledo Zoo
Amphitheater was washed out.
	   The sellout crowd of 4,500 sat in a steady rain for nearly two
hours Friday night, waiting in vain for the Grammy-winning rocker
to take the stage.
	   The crowd heard the opening act, Rick Springfield, but then
there was nothing. And promoters didn't explain what was happening,
audience members said.
	   ``A little communication would have been nice. We asked the
security guards, but they didn't know anything,'' said Kim
Dietrich, who made the hour drive from her home in Napoleon, Ohio.
	   Cocker, who has sung hits for movies such as ``An Officer and a
Gentleman'' and ``9 1/2 Weeks,'' began his career in the late '60s
with covers of ``Feelin' Alright'' and ``With a Little Help From My
Friends.''
	   ___
	   JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) _ They wore sunglasses in the pouring rain.
A few blew kisses or waved to the common folk. Bodyguards stood by
while trinkets were purchased in gift shops.
	   More than 500 of the world's most famous, well-to-do and
well-connected flew in to Alaska's capital Friday for a ``top
secret'' party aboard a posh cruise ship. It was being thrown by
Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen for fellow billionaire Bill Gates.
	   On hand were actors Candice Bergen,Debbie Reynolds, Dan Aykroyd
and Jeff Goldblum, and Titanic director James Cameron among others.
In addition to rafting and shopping, the stars had to brave an
unexpected rainstorm with wind gusts up to 70 mph (110 kmh).
	   Guests arrived on 20 or so planes, most of which stayed far from
the passenger terminal. Guests were whisked by bus to the Crystal
Harmony, a 960-passenger cruise ship rented for an undisclosed
price to cruise Glacier Bay and the Inside Passage.

	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ The three tenors _ Luciano
Pavarotti, Placido Domingo and Jose Carreras _ will perform a
concert next April in Pretoria, the South African capital, a
telecommunications firm announced Monday.
	   The concert's sponsor, Vodacom, said the tenors would perform
April 18 at the Union Buildings with the 110-piece South African
National Symphony Orchestra.
	   ___
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Luther Vandross, a 47-year-old bachelor, says
he's ready for permanent company in his new dlrs 9 million mansion.
	   The popular rhythm and blues singer lives alone in the 25-room
Greenwich, Connecticut, home he bought last year.
	   ``When you're in love, there's nothing to cope with _ like
feelings of loneliness and isolation,'' he says in the Sept. 7
issue of People magazine.
	   Vandross _ who has several platinum and double-platinum albums
to his credit _ offered four reasons why he isn't worried about
staying single.
	   ``I'm 47, drug-free, rich and fabulous,'' he says.
	    &UR; ___
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Joaquin Phoenix will go so far to get into a
role.
	   On the set of ``Return to Paradise,'' Phoenix, who plays an
American facing death in a Malaysian prison, showed up gaunt as a
ghost after apparently not eating.
	   And during filming of next year's ``The Yards,'' the 23-year-old
actor banged his head into a piece of oak when asked for more
emotion during one scene _ ending up with a welt.
	   But Phoenix, a strict vegetarian, does draw the line.
	   ``I'll do anything except put the fish on the hook,'' he told
People magazine in the Sept. 7 edition.
	    &UR; ___
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Tough-guy actor Steven Seagal is among those
urging Taiwan's lawmakers to pass an anti-cruelty bill aimed at
helping thousands of homeless dogs.
	   Seagal, who recently visited the country with animal-rights'
activists, wants other actions to help, too. An ad bearing his name
is scheduled to run in the Hollywood Reporter on Tuesday.
	   People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, which sponsored the
ad, claims countless dogs live in deplorable conditions. Then
there's the practice around Taipei of rounding up and killing stray
dogs by drowning, electrocution and poisoning.
	   Brad Pitt, Kim Basinger and David Duchovny are among the other
actors who've joined Seagal's effort.

Dollar lower in Tokyo, Japanese stocks fall at open
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The United States dollar fell against the Japanese
yen Tuesday amid worry about a stock plunge on Wall Street
overnight and political instability in Russia. Tokyo stock prices
declined.
	   The dollar bought 139.52 yen in early morning trading, down 2.00
yen from late trading in Tokyo on Monday and also below its level
of 140.78 yen in late New York trading.
	   In Tokyo, the U.S. currency continued to weaken after falling in
New York on concern over plummeting stock prices on Wall Street and
continuing political turmoil in Russia, traders said.
	   The Dow Jones industrial index suffered its second-biggest point
loss ever Monday, sinking 512.61 points _ or 6.4 percent _ to close
at 7,539.07.
	   Also Monday, Russian lawmakers rejected President Boris
Yeltsin's candidate for prime minister, blocking the formation of a
government.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the benchmark 225-issue Nikkei
Stock Average opened at 13,979.82, down 128.07 points, or 0.91
percent. It had risen 192.26 points, or 1.38 percent, the previous
day.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section of the exchange fell 12.34 points, or 1.12 percent,
to 1.097.96. On Monday, it had gained 19.50 points, or 1.79
percent.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond fell to 1.020 percent from Monday's finish of 1.040
percent, driving its price up to 113.01 yen from 112.86 yen.

	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ Honduras' president has proposed
lifting a ban on the death penalty, strengthening gun control and
increasing the use of army troops to curb rising crime.
	   In a speech late Sunday, President Carlos Flores Facusse said he
would not permit ``a handful of delinquents to bring our society to
its knees.''
	   Flores Facusse proposed ending the nation's constitutional ban
on the death penalty and assigning about 6,000 soldiers to patrol
the streets alongside police.
	   He also called for a 50 percent increase in police salaries and
the creation of a program to rehabilitate the estimated 40,000
members of criminal youth gangs in the country.
	   He also suggested tougher security at the nation's 24 prisons,
which have seen repeated escapes in recent years.
	   ___
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ After smoking for days, the Popocatepetl
volcano shuddered Monday and sent out steam and gas from its
glowing crater.
	   The National Center for the Prevention of Disasters, which
monitors the 18,000-foot volcano, said the events constituted ``a
slight increase'' in activity since the weekend.
	   Instruments recorded a 15-minute tremor in the volcano early
Monday and video cameras showed a glow from the crater, the
institute said.
	   At dawn, a column of steam 2,000 to 3,000 feet high (610 to 915
meters high) poured from the volcano and streamed away in the wind
to the southwest.
	   The volcano, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) southeast of
downtown Mexico City, has been sputtering intermittently since
1994. After a few months of relative calm, Popocatepetl has been
sending out plumes of steam and gas for much of the past month.
	   ___
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Two former military leaders were
symbolically fired Monday for negligence in a 1996 guerrilla attack
in which 27 soldiers died and 60 were taken prisoner.
	   ``It is a moral sanction,'' said Attorney General Jaime Bernal,
who took the action against marine Brig. Gen. Jesus Maria Castaneda
and army Lt. Col. Jose Claudio Bastidas. The two had quit about a
year ago.
	   The two were in command positions when about 400 rebels attacked
the remote Las Delicias army base in jungles near the Ecuadorian
border in August 1996, handing the military an embarrassing defeat.
	   Castaneda should have shut down the vulnerable southern base or
tightened its security, and Bastidas failed to advise the army
command of the seriousness of the rebel assault, Bernal said in a
statement.
	   ___
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ Protesting the slow pace of government
land redistribution, about 2,000 farming families occupied eight
ranches in southern Brazil over the weekend, a group representing
the farmers said Monday.
	   The Landless Rural Workers Movement said the government had
already earmarked the ranches in Sao Paulo state for expropriation,
but was taking too long to turn them over to landless farmers.
	   The group's leader, Jose Rainha, told the Estado de Sao Paulo
newspaper that the farmers waited three months for the government
to indemnify ranch owners and transfer the land.
	   ``We got tired of waiting,'' Rainha said.
	   ___
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ A riot and attempted jailbreak Monday
in southeastern Brazil left five inmates dead, prison officials
said.
	   Armed with makeshift knives, 30 inmates took two guards hostage
in an attempt to escape from the Praia Grande prison, 45 miles (70
kilometers) south of Sao Paulo.
	   Police opened fire and killed two inmates after they refused to
release the hostages, prison guard Vanessa Salles said by phone.
	   One group of prisoners then rushed into the prison's maximum
security wing and stabbed three other inmates to death, she said.
	   After a two-hour standoff, the rebellious prisoners released
their hostages unharmed and returned to their cells, she said.

	   SANZHOU TOWNSHIP, China (AP) _ Packed into creaky shacks of wood
and plastic sheeting on a leaky levee, thousands of refugees await
the slow retreat of a murky lake, their homes and fields sacrificed
in China's summerlong battle against disastrous flooding.
	   A government decision to calm the raging Yangtze by blowing up
three stretches of dikes sent the swelling river through their
brick and tile homes and rich farmland in a corner of central Hubei
province early last month.
	   Not a soul was lost, officials claim. But still the human cost
of the government's disaster-season triage is staggering. More than
96,000 people were made homeless. A lake 8 yards (7 meters) deep in
some places covers 125 square miles of land (201 square kilometers)
of land.
	   ``Our homes are ruined. Our money, our investment, is gone,''
said one refugee, a woman surnamed Chen living in a lean-to with
her family of six. ``This wasn't done by the floods.''
	   The wreckage of Jianli county is a striking example of a measure
the government has taken repeatedly in China's worst flood season
in 44 years. President Jiang Zemin has ordered that the main
Yangtze levee and major cities be protected above all else.
Farmland goes under so that cities can be saved.
	   On a tour of the devastation given to foreign journalists
Monday, government officials explained that if Jianli had not been
sacrificed, the Yangtze's fifth flood crest could have pounded
Wuhan, a major industrial center of 7 million people downstream.
	   Resignation tinged with anger and anxiety for the future pervade
the clusters of camps dotting a 90-mile (144-kilometer) stretch of
the levee. In one of the largest, 2,000 refugees survive on
government handouts of a pound (half a kilo) of rice and 12 cents a
day. Most families have little more than a bed, a couple of stools,
some cooking pots and a few chickens or pigs _ all they could move
when they were ordered to evacuate on Aug 7.
	   Within sight is what used to be Sanzhou township _ now
completely submerged, its 39,000 residents displaced. On boat rides
back, the lucky ones find a rooftop cleaving the water's surface.
For others, a few planks or a bedstand snagged in the tops of
cedars and poplars are all that's left.
	   ``It has already happened. There was no other way,'' said farmer
Ouyang Junzhuang. ``We're living day by day.''
	   Ouyang and others believe it will be a month or two before the
waters recede and they can start rebuilding. On Monday, the
Yangtze's eighth flood crest this summer swelled the river upstream
from Jianli but flood control officials planned to blunt its impact
by diverting waters into reservoirs, state media reported.
	   Flooding across China has killed more than 3,000 people and left
millions homeless this summer. While heavier than normal rains
drove the flooding, the government has acknowledged that ruinous
environmental policies borne of China's need to provide for its
huge population have worsened the devastation.
	   In Jianli, projects to create farmland have encouraged settling
on the Yangtze flood plain. Wiped-out Sanzhou township was just
recovering from heavy flooding two years ago.
	   ``The land is fertile. People have reclaimed it and built houses
on it. What can we do?'' said Li Ning, a Hubei province spokesman.
	   Unlike previous tours of flooded-out areas, officials with
China's usually suspicious government readily answered questions
and gave journalists access to refugees, although they tried to
monitor conversations. The rare display of openness seemed partly
designed to draw donations to help the cash-strapped Jianli
government cope with the refugees.
	   ``Through your presence, you can arouse the concern of all
society,'' Huang Yong, the head of Sanzhou Township, told the
reporters as they departed.
	   In addition to refugees living on the levees, the government is
also caring for tens of thousands housed in official tent camps, in
government buildings and in other homes. All are being provided
with rice. Medical teams are treating the sick without charge and
school fees are being waived.
	   China's central bank, the People's Bank of China, ordered
financial institutions Monday to provide low-interest loans to
speed recovery.
	   ``Our biggest worry is what will we do when we have to rebuild
our homes,'' said Dong Huisong, a farmer living in a tent camp on a
soggy field outside Jianli's main town. ``We'll have to rely on the
government for food, but they may not have enough money to help us
with housing.''

Yangtze levee and major cities be protected above all else.
Farmland goes under so that cities can be saved.
	   On a tour of the devastation given to foreign journalists
Monday, government officials explained that if Jianli had not been
sacrificed, the Yangtze's fifth flood crest could have pounded
Wuhan, a major industrial center of 7 million people downstream.
	   Resignation tinged with anger and anxiety for the future pervade
the clusters of camps dotting a 90-mile (144-kilometer) stretch of
the levee. In one of the largest, 2,000 refugees survive on
government handouts of a pound (half a kilo) of rice and 12 cents a
day. Most families have little more than a bed, a couple of stools,
some cooking pots and a few chickens or pigs _ all they could move
when they were ordered to evacuate on Aug 7.
	   Within sight is what used to be Sanzhou township _ now
completely submerged, its 39,000 residents displaced. On boat rides
back, the lucky ones find a rooftop cleaving the water's surface.
For others, a few planks or a bedstand snagged in the tops of
cedars and poplars are all that's left.
	   ``It has already happened. There was no other way,'' said farmer
Ouyang Junzhuang. ``We're living day by day.''
	   Ouyang and others believe it will be a month or two before the
waters recede and they can start rebuilding. On Monday, the
Yangtze's eighth flood crest this summer swelled the river upstream
from Jianli but flood control officials planned to blunt its impact
by diverting waters into reservoirs, state media reported.
	   Flooding across China has killed more than 3,000 people and left
millions homeless this summer. While heavier than normal rains
drove the flooding, the government has acknowledged that ruinous
environmental policies borne of China's need to provide for its
huge population have worsened the devastation.
	   In Jianli, projects to create farmland have encouraged settling
on the Yangtze flood plain. Wiped-out Sanzhou township was just
recovering from heavy flooding two years ago.
	   ``The land is fertile. People have reclaimed it and built houses
on it. What can we do?'' said Li Ning, a Hubei province spokesman.
	   Unlike previous tours of flooded-out areas, officials with
China's usually suspicious government readily answered questions
and gave journalists access to refugees, although they tried to
monitor conversations. The rare display of openness seemed partly
designed to draw donations to help the cash-strapped Jianli
government cope with the refugees.
	   ``Through your presence, you can arouse the concern of all
society,'' Huang Yong, the head of Sanzhou Township, told the
reporters as they departed.
	   In addition to refugees living on the levees, the government is
also caring for tens of thousands housed in official tent camps, in
government buildings and in other homes. All are being provided
with rice. Medical teams are treating the sick without charge and
school fees are being waived.
	   China's central bank, the People's Bank of China, ordered
financial institutions Monday to provide low-interest loans to
speed recovery.
	   ``Our biggest worry is what will we do when we have to rebuild
our homes,'' said Dong Huisong, a farmer living in a tent camp on a
soggy field outside Jianli's main town. ``We'll have to rely on the
government for food, but they may not have enough money to help us
with housing.''

Reported killing of Serb civilians exacerbates Kosovo problem
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The reported killing of 22 Serb
civilians by Kosovo Albanian militants has prompted calls for even
tougher action against the rebels and rallied Serbs behind
President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   The allegations, reported extensively by Serbian media, have
further deepened enmities and likely diminished prospects for a
compromise between the government and the rebels any time soon.
	   More than ever since Serbian security forces launched a
crackdown against the secessionist Albanian guerrillas, Milosevic's
government is intent on crushing the rebellion.
	   Milosevic, who rose to power by pledging to defend the rights of
the Serb minority in Kosovo, now appears to enjoy even greater
public support for his crackdown against the Kosovo Liberation Army
fighting for independence for the Serbian province.
	   Citing the alleged massacre and burning of bodies of Serb
civilians, including women and children, by the KLA, government
officials and media have sought Western support for what they call
the ``fight against terrorism.''
	   They have long accused the West of anti-Serb bias in the Kosovo
conflict.
	   ``Serbia is facing a tough battle,'' declared Milovan Bojic, a
vice-president in the Serbian government. ``We must move into
action,'' he added, suggesting an all-out drive to break ethnic
Albanians' resistance.
	   Bojic demanded the United States should ``politically,
militarily and morally'' support Serbia's offensive against the
militants.
	   ``What would America do?'' he asked, meaning if it were faced
with a rebellion within its borders.
	   Tomislav Nikolic, another vice-president, said Sunday the
security forces ``will clear Kosovo of any armed bandit who is
ready to shoot at citizens and violate public law and order.''
	   In a stage-managed campaign, officials and media have likened
the purported killings to World War II persecution of Serbs by the
pro-Nazi Croatian puppet state, stressing the crematory found was
the first in postwar Europe.
	   Media reports are accompanied by footage of the discovered bones
and the crematory. Repeatedly aired are also testimonies by two men
said to be members of the KLA who confessed the killings.
	   The KLA has denied it killed the Serbs and said the two men were
not its members.
	   While not independently confirmed, the slayings and the
subsequent media campaign have united most Serbian political
parties and public figures in condemning the Albanians' fight for
independence.
	   They have also generated fresh support for Milosevic's
determination to crush the rebels' resistance to his rule once and
for all.
	   Serbs consider Kosovo the cradle of their history and culture
and are particularly sensitive about the province's future.
	   However, a statement by the opposition Civil Alliance warned
that ``this is not the first time that the regime is using human
suffering for propaganda for its wrong policies which have already
cost Serbia and its citizens a lot.''
	   It accused the government of ``disturbing'' the public by
publishing partial reports about the alleged crimes, namely without
information about the killed and further detail.
	   ``All this cannot contribute to calming the situation,'' the
statement said.

Malaysia places restrictions on stock trading of domestic companies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange
has imposed restrictions on stock transactions, saying shares of
Malaysian-listed companies can only be traded through it.
	   The move effectively banned trading of shares of Malaysian
companies in overseas markets, mostly affecting transactions in
neighboring Singapore, where about 25 percent of listed Malaysian
companies have their shares traded on a special market.
	   ``I'm afraid we cannot take into account activities outside our
jurisdiction,'' KLSE chairman Mohamad Azlan Hashim told reporters
on Monday.
	   Azlan said he wants 100 percent of Malaysian securities to trade
through the central depository system, the KLSE's electronic
clearing house, compared with 74 percent currently.
	   The move could help bring more cash into Malaysia because all
trading of scrips of Malaysian companies will have to be done in
the domestic market.
	   ``In implementing these measures, stockbroking companies are
required to take the necessary steps to ensure they are not
assisting any persons to create another market for Malaysian
securities,'' Azlan said.

Clinton applauds Russians for resisting return to communist ways

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ With Russia's political leadership in crisis
and its economy in shambles, President Bill Clinton headed to
Moscow for a summit with Russian President Boris Yeltsin on a
mission to keep the world's second-largest nuclear power ``on the
path of reform.''
	   ``The reason I'm going to Russia is because we have learned the
hard way that problems that develop beyond our borders sooner or
later find their way to our doorstep unless we help our friends and
our neighbors,'' Clinton said before departing for Tuesday's
summit.
	   Clinton's remarks seemed to signal his administration's worry
that Russia may backslide on its commitment _ since the demise of
Soviet communism in 1991 _ to democracy and a free market economy.
	   Clinton and Yeltsin were to meet Tuesday and Wednesday for their
first full-scale summit since March 1997. Since then, they have met
briefly a few times, most recently in May, when both were in
Birmingham, England, for a meeting of industrial powers.
	   Both Yeltsin and Clinton are struggling to regain their
presidential footing. Clinton is battling a politically
debilitating sex investigation, and Yeltsin is trying to shore up
his uneasy hold on power in the midst of his country's economic
upheaval.
	   To set the stage for the summit, U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright arrived in Moscow on Monday and conferred with
acting Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov. Yeltsin's foreign policy
adviser, Sergei Prikhodko, said Clinton and Yeltsin intend to issue
joint statements on economic cooperation and international
security, and sign agreements on reducing each nation's stockpile
of plutonium used in nuclear warheads.
	   In his remarks Monday, Clinton made no direct mention of Yeltsin
or of Russian lawmakers' rejection of the appointment of Viktor
Chernomyrdin as prime minister.
	   Instead, Clinton offered praise for the Russian people's refusal
to revert to the past.
	   ``The Russian people are to be commended for embracing democracy
and getting rid of the old communist system,'' Clinton said.
	   ``What I want to do is to go there and tell them that the easy
thing to do is not the right thing to do,'' he said in an apparent
reference to pressure from the communist faction to renationalize
some industries and move away from Western-style free enterprise.
	   ``If they will stay on the path of reform, to stabilize their
society and to strengthen their economy and to get growth back,
then I believe America and the rest of the Western nations with
strong economies should help them and indeed have an obligation to
help them,'' he said.
	   On the flight to Russia, National Security Adviser Sandy Berger
said the political deadlock in Russia amounts to ``negotiations''
between Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin on one side, and parliament on the
other.
	   ``What the president and the prime minister appear to be saying
is they are not prepared to deviate fundamentally from the path of
reform that they are on.''

Stephens backed despite drug row
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Festina rider Neil Stephens is expected
to take his place at this month's Commonwealth Games despite being
kicked out of the Tour de France along with eight teammates
embroiled in a doping scandal.
	   The International Cycling Union on Monday urged national
federations to be tough with cyclists kicked out of the world's
leading road race for using banned substances.
	   Following a meeting in Bordeaux, the UCI informed the
Australian, French and Swiss cycling federations, which all had
riders implicated in the drug-marred Tour in June, they had until
Sept. 13 to decide on sanctions.
	   The Commonwealth Games start on Sept. 11 and Stephens has been
selected in Australia's road race team.
	   The UCI wants to review each national federation's sanctions to
ensure consistency and there have been reports that the Swiss and
French federations are preparing a hard crackdown on their
implicated riders.
	   But Cycling Australia (CA) chief executive Graham Fredericks
said the association had written to the UCI pleading for more
information about the Festina case.
	   ``Until there are formal charges laid against Neil, really there
is nothing we can do,'' Fredericks said. ``The selection criteria
works both ways _ when a rider has done everything to satisfy that
criteria and you don't pick him without good grounds, you leave
yourself open to be stung from a legal perspective.
	   ``As things stand at the moment, we have no grounds not to
select him. What other federations do is their business.''
	   Stephens spent a night in French police custody during the Tour
de France as authorities investigated Festina for drugs smuggling.
	   He later admitted signing a document which stated he had been
given synthetic EPO, a banned substance, but Stephens insists the
drug was administered without his permission.
	   While anti-doping regulations call for suspensions from six to
12 months, the UCI reminded the federations of the seriousness of
the offense and asked that the considerable evidence against the
cyclists be taken into account when handing out sanctions.

Lawmakers' rejection of Chernomyrdin extends Russia's crisis

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Unfazed by parliament's overwhelming rejection of
his candidate for prime minister, President Boris Yeltsin has
resubmitted Viktor Chernomyrdin's name to parliament.
	   Chernomyrdin, meanwhile, said he would present Yeltsin on
Tuesday with a list of people he hoped would serve in his Cabinet.
Leaders of the lower house of parliament, the State Duma, said they
would come up with a list of their own candidates for prime
minister after voting 253-94 to reject Chernomyrdin on Monday
evening.
	   Against the background of the country's roiling economic crisis,
the bitter stand-off over Chernomyrdin's candidacy seemed to bring
Russia's political deadlock to a dangerous new high just as U.S.
President Bill Clinton was launching his two-day state visit to
Moscow.
	   Clinton was to be greeted on his arrival by Chernomyrdin before
heading to the Kremlin for talks with Yeltsin.
	   Hours before his departure on Monday, Clinton pledged continued
U.S. support for Russia so long as its leaders ``stay on the path
of reform'' and do not revert to the communist ways of its past.
	   ``The Russian people are to be commended for embracing democracy
and getting rid of the old communist system, but they're having
some troubles today making the transition from communism to a
free-market economy,'' he said.
	   The debate ahead of Monday's vote was furious. One after the
other, parliamentary deputies leaned over the rostrum to deliver
apocalyptic predictions about the country's future.
	   Chernomyrdin himself warned that ``Russia is on the verge of
political and economic collapse.''
	   Russia has been without a government since Aug. 23, when Yeltsin
fired Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko in the midst of an economic
crisis that has crippled the ruble and stocks, threatened to bring
down its banking and financial system and sent an earthquake
through world markets.
	   Gennady Zyuganov, leader of the Duma's vociferous Communist
majority, growled that Yeltsin's renomination of Chernomyrdin was
``a slap in the face to the whole nation.''
	   Zyuganov said Chernomyrdin was responsible for many of Russia's
current problems, and liberal Yabloko faction leader Grigory
Yavlinsky accused him of creating ``a semi-criminal economic
system.''
	   ``It was during his years that Russia became the world leader in
corruption,'' the reformist Yavlinsky said. ``You ask any kid
what's the problem with the government and the answer will be:
`They are thieves.'''
	   Unless Yeltsin or the Duma backs down, Russia could face
parliamentary elections late this year in order to break the
stalemate and form a new government to settle the turmoil.
	   The president can make three nominations in all, with at least a
week's interval required between the votes. But if he is rejected
three times, he is required by the constitution to dismiss the Duma
and call new elections within three months.
	   Some Communist leaders said they were not afraid of government
threats to dissolve the legislature because they are confident of
winning the elections that would follow _ a view analysts don't
necessarily share.

Japanese stocks fall at open, dollar lower in Tokyo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS; UPDATES thruout with stock, dollar, bond prices.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese stock prices tumbled sharply in early
trading Tuesday following a plunge on Wall Street overnight as
investors sold off shares of big exporters such as Sony Corp. The
U.S. dollar fell against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 284.06 points,
or 2.0 percent, to 13,823.83 in the first hour of trading. It had
risen 192.26 points, or 1.38 percent, the previous day.
	   The dollar bought 139.56 yen in early morning trading, down 1.96
yen from late trading in Tokyo on Monday and also below its level
of 140.78 yen in late New York trading.
	   The Nikkei drop in Tokyo followed the Dow Jones industrial
average's second-biggest point loss ever on Monday, falling 512.61
points _ or 6.4 percent _ to close at 7,539.07.
	   At one point, the Nikkei fell as low as 13,664.74 in early
trading, a new 12-year low, before recovering slightly. Last Friday
the average dropped below 14,000 for the first time since March
1986.
	   Blue chip exporters such as Sony and Canon Inc. pulled the Tokyo
market lower amid worry the Dow's fall may signal a slowdown in
profit growth from sales in the U.S. by these export-dependent
companies, traders said.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange declined 24.70 points, or
2.23 percent, to 1,081.79. On Monday, it had gained 19.50 points,
or 1.79 percent.
	   Persistent concern over the lackluster performance of the
Japanese economy also depressed shares prices, traders said.
	   On the Tokyo foreign exchange market, the dollar weakened amid
concern over plummeting stock prices on Wall Street and continuing
political turmoil in Russia, traders said.
	   ``It's now the dollar's problem that's driving trading, instead
of some other currencies','' said Yoneo Sakai, general manager of
the international treasury division at Fuji Bank Ltd.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond fell to 1.025 percent from Monday's finish of 1.040
percent, driving its price up to 112.97 yen from 112.86 yen.

<TEXT>
	   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) _Heads of state are gathering in South
Africa to consider final recommendations on issues from the global
economic crisis to regional conflicts.
	   Fifty-two heads of state are to meet Tuesday and Wednesday at
the 12th summit of the Nonaligned Movement.
	   Formed during the Cold War to fend off domination by the White
House and the Kremlin, the movement is now struggling to define a
new role.
	   Fallout from recent U.S. attacks on suspected terrorist targets
in Sudan and Afghanistan and a growing conflict in Africa's Great
Lakes region have dominated discussions so far.
	   A lower level committee supported Sudan's call for an
investigation of Washington's missile attacks on a factory in
Khartoum to determine if the facility was a chemical weapons plant,
as Washington claims.
	   Sudan says it was a pharmaceutical factory.
	   Sudanese foreign Minister Mustafa Osman Ismail called the
committee's decision a step forward for justice. But unless the
resolution receives unanimous backing from foreign ministers
meeting Monday and Tuesday, it will not be passed on for
consideration by the heads of state.
	   No progress on the matter was apparent on Monday.
	   Sudan's foreign minister said Monday that if Washington
acknowledged its error in bombing a factory in Khartoum, Sudan was
prepared ``to turn the page.''
	   ``We are open to turn the page against the U.S.A. if they
acknowledge they got wrong information'' about the nature of the
plant, he said at a news conference.
	   The global stock market plunge that has swept across developing
countries was also at the top of the summit's agenda.
	   Under discussion is a 62-page economics report commissioned at
the last Nonaligned Movement summit three years ago in Colombia.
	   The report criticized the world's major financial institutions,
such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, for
ignoring the needs of the developing world.
	   It recommends speedy debt relief programs and a slower
integration of poorer economies into global markets to avoid their
exploitation by developed countries.
	   About 100 nations sent delegates to the summit.
	   South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, welcoming foreign
ministers, said the Nonaligned Movement should advance the cause of
the poor.
	   ``The world economy should be managed in a way that ensures the
transfer of resources from those who have them to those that do
not,'' he said.
	   Other summit topics include the war in Congo, whose government
alleges that rebels supported by Rwanda and Uganda are trying to
unseat President Laurent Kabila's year-old government.
	   Kabila has received military support from Angola, Zimbabwe and
Namibia, despite efforts led by South Africa to negotiate a
settlement.
	   The crisis threatens to break apart the political cohesion just
now emerging in southern Africa after South Africa's first all-race
elections in 1994 elected President Nelson Mandela.
	   Mandela is the current chair of the NAM.
	   Meanwhile, delegates from India and Pakistan said they hoped to
talks about recent nuclear arms testing by both countries.
	   ``We don't want to engage in a nuclear arms race,'' Aziz said in
an interview. ``But for a nuclear stand down, we must deal with the

Rioters rampage in Indonesian town after troops pull out
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS pvs to CLARIFY soldiers fired warning shots and tear
gas, CORRECTS attribution for Sugito and history of troop
withdrawals. Many Indonesians only use one name &QL; 
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER TORCHIA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Mobs have burned buildings, stoned
police cars and attacked ethnic Chinese in northern Indonesia in
the biggest riot since deadly unrest in May helped oust former
President Suharto.
	   The violence Monday in Lhokseumawe, a town in Aceh province, was
triggered by bitterness toward the military but ended up targeting
Indonesia's Chinese minority, a traditional scapegoat.
	   Soldiers fired warning shots and tear gas but the rioters still
left a wide path of destruction, burning a hotel, a ruling party
office and part of a shopping center. Many Chinese-owned stores
were pelted with rocks.
	   The Chinese are resented because they dominate business in
Indonesia, which is struggling through its worst economic crisis in
three decades.
	   A human rights activist, Burhan, said by telephone that he saw a
mob throwing stones at a Chinese man. It was not known if the man
was hurt, and there were no immediate reports of arrests or
injuries.
	   The unrest in Lhokseumawe erupted after more than 660 Indonesian
soldiers left Aceh in a conciliatory gesture by the military, which
is accused of atrocities there.
	   When the troops pulled out after a ceremony, some spectators
pelted their vehicles with stones, shouting ``Pigs! Dogs!''
	   A resident of Lhokseumawe said teen-agers in school uniforms set
fire to the office of the ruling Golkar party, which has lost
credibility for buttressing Suharto's 32 years of autocratic rule.
	   ``Many windows were broken, while heaps of debris and stones
were scattered along the streets,'' said another resident, Sugito.
``Smoke billowed into the sky after people burned a hotel.''
	   Mobs blocked fire trucks that tried to reach the hotel, a fire
brigade official said.
	   After a period of relative calm, there have been scattered riots
around Indonesia over the past week. Looters rampaged through a
fishing town and on Monday, police on Lombok island fought rioters
who were protesting a new governor.
	   There are fears that despite democratic reforms, the strain that
Indonesia's economic crisis is putting on millions of poor people
could lead to bigger riots.
	   A U.N. report released Monday said about 140 million people _
two out of every three Indonesians _ are likely to be living in
poverty in 1999. That compares with only 11 percent living in
poverty in 1996.
	   The violence in Aceh may slow a policy of armed forces chief
Gen. Wiranto to withdraw troops from provinces where the military
has fought separatist rebels.
	   Irian Jaya and the former Portuguese colony of East Timor also
harbor independence movements. There have been troop withdrawals in
both those provinces.

One Nation surges in latest polling
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Pauline Hanson's One Nation party has
surged in opinion polling during the first week of the federal
election campaign, recording 10 percent support across the nation,
according to a newspaper poll.
	   A Newspoll in Tuesday's The Australian newspaper showed the
governing Liberal-National coalition and opposition Labor Party
tied on 40 percent with One Nation in a position to possibly take
the balance of power in both the house of representatives and the
Senate. The election will be held Oct. 3.
	   The paper said preference deals meant One Nation candidates
stood little chance of being elected outright in the house of
representatives, although their preferences could be crucial in
determining the outcome in closely-fought seats.
	   Incumbent John Howard was the preferred prime minister on 39
percent, with Labor leader Kim Beazley on 37 percent, although 24
percent of those surveyed were uncommitted.
	   The poll also showed support for Labor's tax package, with 41
percent of those surveyed indicating they preferred it, compared
with 37 percent nominating the coalition's plan, which includes the
introduction of a goods and services tax.
	   Newspoll managing director Sol Lebovic said there was a high 22
percent who were uncommitted on the relative merits of the tax
plans for the coalition and Labor. The coalition lost an election
when touting a GST in 1993.
	   The telephone poll of 1,153 voters nationwide was taken over
Aug. 28-30 and had a margin of error of 2.8 percent.
	   Meanwhile Howard said he would likely quit politics if defeated
in the Oct. 3 election.
	   ``I'd spend a bit of time doing some charitable work, I'd find
something else to do,'' Howard said. ``I believe we deserve to be
reelected ... but I'm realistic enough to believe that anything can
happen in politics and I'm quite open and frank about it.''

With flowers, tears and prayers, Britain remembers Princess Diana

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Britons commemorated the life of Princess Diana on
the first anniversary of her death with thousands of flowers, notes
and prayers in London's great Cathedrals, while her somber young
sons attended a memorial service with the royal family, away from
the pubic gaze.
	   Wearing black ties as a symbol of mourning, 16-year-old Prince
William and 13-year-old Prince Harry entered the tiny stone church
of Scotland's Crathie parish on Monday, flanked by their father,
Prince Charles, their grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, and other
relatives.
	   William hung his head and was mostly shielded from the cameras.
Harry showed no expression.
	   In London, outside the palace where Diana lived, and in Paris,
near the mouth of the tunnel where she died in a car crash, crowds
gathered to pay their respects or merely to view the spectacle.
	   Many left behind flowers, stuffed animals and portraits of the
princess, just as they did _ in vastly larger numbers _ in the days
after her death.
	   ``It's the thing to do,'' said Maureen Poole of London,
clutching a bunch of carnations at Kensington Palace. ``To just
come when she dies and to never come again, especially this first
year, would seem empty.''
	   ``Every year, August 31st, we will always remember,'' read one
placard in a pile of bouquets at the palace.
	   At Diana's ancestral home in Althorp, 75 miles (120 kms) north
of London, her brother, Earl Spencer, and her sisters, Lady Sarah
McCorquodale and Lady Jane Fellowes, conducted their own service
overlooking her burial site on an island in an ornamental lake.
	   More than 1,000 people packed London's Westminster Cathedral for
an afternoon Reqium Mass, and St. Paul's Cathedral _ where Diana
married Charles in 1981 _ held an evening service for the public.
	   Hundreds also flocked to Harrods department store to sign
condolence books. Some mingled with owner Mohamed Al Fayed, whose
son, Dodi, died with Diana in the crash, along with their driver,
Henri Paul.
	   ``It has been a horrendous day,'' said Al Fayed, who spent the
morning with his family at his son's tomb on the family estate at
Oxted, 20 miles (35 kms) south of London. ``I just came here
because thousands of people were waiting for me.''
	   Harrods unveiled two identical 8-foot (2.5-meter) bronze
sculptures of Diana and boyfriend Dodi Fayed, featuring photographs
of the pair mounted above a pool of water and surrounded by gilded
seagulls.
	   Asked if he had a message for the royal family, Al Fayed said,
``I feel sorry for the princes. ... The two children, to have their
mother, is so important. But I am suffering, too. I lost my son.''
	   In deference to Diana, the queen ordered the national flag, the
Union Jack, to be flown at half-staff Monday on government
buildings and royal residences.
	   She had issued a statement Sunday night thanking people ``for
their messages and kind gestures of sympathy at this sad time and
for sharing their remembrance of the Princess of Wales.''
	   During the royal family's private service, the Rev. Robert Sloan
mentioned Diana by name in prayers and read Psalm 23 _ ``The Lord
is my shepherd, I shall not want'' _ and from chapter 40 of Isaiah,
``Comfort ye my people, sayeth your God.''
	   The boys left the church after the 20-minute service _
accompanied by 11 royal relatives and Prime Minister Tony Blair and
his wife, Cherie.
	   In Paris, where it all ended for the 36-year-old Diana, Dr.
Frederic Mailliez, the off-duty French doctor who first reached the
princess, revisited the Place de l'Alama outside the traffic
tunnel.
	   ``I wish I could have done more,'' he said, fighting back tears.
He added that he was overwhelmed by the number of people who
recognized him and reassured him he had done all he could.
	   ``I know I did my best, but she could have lived 50 years
longer,'' Mailliez said. ``It was not the first accident I went to,
and it won't be the last. But this one was very hard because the
victim was famous and very precious.''

Western leaders urge Yeltsin to stay the course of reform

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ In a flurry of phone calls, world leaders
consulted with each other and Boris Yeltsin over Russia's worsening
crisis, calling on him to stay the course of reform.
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who holds the rotating
chairmanship of the Group of Eight major industrialized nations,
spoke to the Russian president by telephone for 20 minutes Monday,
a spokesman for Blair said.
	   Over the weekend, Blair spoke to U.S. President Bill Clinton and
leaders of France, Germany, Italy, Canada and Japan to share
assessments of Russia's economic and political turmoil.
	   Blair ``passed on the desire of those nations to help Russia,
but made it clear that there was agreement among them that any help
must be tied to the economic reform process continuing,'' the
spokesman said, speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   ``He was assured that Russia understood the importance of that
economic reform program,'' the spokesman said.
	   Russia's economic and political turmoil deepened Monday, as
legislators overwhelmingly rejected Yeltsin's choice for prime
minister, Viktor Chernomyrdin. The latest crisis sent shock waves
through most of the world's financial markets. On Wall Street, the
Dow industrials fell 512 points Monday.
	   The consultations among world leaders came just ahead of
Clinton's scheduled arrival in Moscow on Tuesday for a summit.
	   German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and French President Jacques
Chirac also spoke by phone and spent part of the weekend assessing
the Russian situation, their offices said.
	   ``Both believe that the pursuit of reforms is absolutely
essential. That's the message that should be sent to Russian
authorities,'' Chirac spokeswoman Catherine Colonna said.
	   Kohl said Monday he warned Yeltsin that Russia would receive no
infusion of financial aid from abroad unless he proceeded with
reforms.
	   European Union Finance Commissioner Yves-Thibault de Silguy
cautioned that Europe _ particularly the 11 nations set to adopt
the euro currency next year _ has more at stake in Russia's economy
than the United States.
	   ``Forty percent of Russia's foreign trade is with Europe, and
only five percent is with the United States,'' he said Monday in an
interview with French radio Europe-1. ``But it's Clinton who's
going to Russia on Tuesday.''
	   Blair's office indicated earlier that the Group of Eight was
waiting for the formation of a new Russian government before taking
any steps.
	   Russia, whose economic crisis has been building all summer, is
the newest member of the Group of Eight.
	   Some commentators saw no other option but to keep aid to Russia
flowing.
	   ``As absurd as it sounds, there is nothing further for the West
to do but to pump money into Russia,'' read an editorial in the
Vienna newspaper Der Standard, warning the alternative would be
``further hysterical reactions on the international finance
markets.''

Mexican president faces tough audience in state of nation speech
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ The advance of democracy may be President
Ernesto Zedillo's greatest success. On Tuesday, it may also be his
biggest headache.
	   Zedillo is due to present his annual state of the nation speech
to a Congress just completing its first year with an opposition
majority _ after nearly seven decades in the control of Zedillo's
Institutional Revolutionary Party, the PRI.
	   The president has taken credit for political reforms that helped
opposition parties gain unprecedented victories in last year's
congressional elections.
	   But it is not the ideal moment for Zedillo, who is finishing the
fourth year of his six-year term, to face a newly critical
audience.
	   Economic problems around the world have clobbered Mexico,
sinking hopes of expanding social spending by a president who
campaigned in 1994 on the slogan ``well-being for your family.''
	   Instead, Zedillo has dedicated most of his presidency to
economic damage control.
	   PRI President Mariano Palacios Alcocer said over the weekend
that Zedillo would discuss ``advances in stabilizing the economy
... and strengthening the democratic system'' in his state of the
nation speech.
	   Plunging prices for oil, which brings in much of the federal
budget, have forced the government to make wide-ranging spending
cuts.
	   Problems in Asia and Russia made investors nervous about
emerging markets, so Mexico's stock index is trading at dollar
values not seen since the depression year of 1995. On Monday the
market index plummeted by 5 percent.
	   The peso has lost about 27 percent of its value over the past
year, and inflation _ which had recently seemed under control _ has
started to rise with the peso's fall.
	   Zedillo faces a political crisis in his effort to move beyond
the 1995 financial chaos: To pass his economic plan, he must win
support from the opposition-led Congress.
	   But even the PRI has proposed major changes to an administration
proposal to transform a $65 billion bad-loan fund into national
debt to help stabilize the banking system.
	   Opposition parties seized on the program as a political scandal,
charging that taxpayers are being asked to pay the tab for illegal,
insider loans made by millionaires.
	   The two main opposition parties claim that a few of those loans
were channeled to the PRI _ even to Zedillo's 1994 presidential
campaign.
	   Zedillo also has struggled to win support for his policy toward
the Zapatista National Liberation Army in southern Mexico.
	   Talks with the Zapatistas have been stalled since September 1996
and a hard-line policy toward the rebels was undermined by a
massacre of 45 rebel sympathizers by pro-government villagers in
December 1997.
	   Zedillo announced a new crusade last week against Mexico's crime
wave _ one crisis that his political reforms have allowed him to
share with opposition parties, who also have been unable to halt
the wave of kidnappings, robberies and assaults.

Japanese leader winds up first month with economy still on skids

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ No one expected a quick economic turnaround when
Keizo Obuchi took over as prime minister of Japan _ and he has not
delivered one.
	   A month after Obuchi assumed office with a vow to tackle
problems ``one after another'' to repair the enfeebled economy, his
government is bogged down in political paralysis and economic
gloom.
	   Key banking reforms are mired in a partisan tug-of-war in
Parliament. The moribund economy shows no sign of a pulse. The
stock market is plumbing depths not seen for more than a decade.
	   But despite the power Obuchi wields in the ruling party, the
type of dramatic action needed to win the confidence of consumers
and investors is not on the horizon.
	   ``Policy-making is not moving forward but actually backpedaling
_ while the economy is collapsing and financial markets are melting
down,'' said Andrew Shipley, chief economist with Schroders
Securities (Japan).
	   The most dramatic sign of hard times in Japan was the plunge in
the Tokyo stock market last week. The exchange's benchmark Nikkei
index on Friday hit its lowest level since 1986, and recovered only
slightly on Monday.
	   That's not only bad news for Japan. The nosedive in the world's
second-largest economy is part of a global slowdown with a string
of stock losses in other parts of Asia and Wall Street and the
meltdown in Russia.
	   ``Japan is on the verge of winding up a loser in the game of
international finance,'' the Mainichi newspaper said in an
editorial Monday. ``The recent market plunge is a stern warning
about this possibility.''
	   Compounding Japan's financial woes _ a challenge even for the
most forceful of leaders _ are its political problems.
	   Obuchi took office under a cloud, replacing Ryutaro Hashimoto
after the ruling Liberal Democratic Party suffered a crushing
defeat in elections for the upper house of Parliament. Approval
ratings for the party hover near all-time lows.
	   The former foreign minister became premier on July 31 only after
the more powerful lower house overruled the upper house's selection
of opposition leader Naoto Kan _ the first time the chambers split
on a vote for prime minister in eight years.
	   The lack of a clear mandate has complicated the government's
efforts to push through Parliament a crucial package of bills to
clean up the country's financial system, which is plagued with dlrs
563 billion in bad debts.
	   The opposition, smelling victory should Obuchi be forced to call
a general election, has pledged to fight the government plan and
has come up with its own proposal _ one that cracks down more
firmly on mismanaged banks and requires them to reveal more of
their inner finances.
	   Government critics also have not shied away from openly
attacking Obuchi.
	   ``Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, the Japanese people have not
chosen you as their prime minister,'' Kan was quoted by the Asahi
newspaper as saying in recent testimony in Parliament.
	   In such a politically charged atmosphere, progress is difficult.
	   ``The two sides are so far apart that a compromise is going to
be very hard to hammer out,'' said Ron Bevacqua, an economist with
Merrill Lynch. ``At this point, I'm not sure what is possible.''
	   Obuchi also is battling an image _ deserved or not _ that he
lacks the ideas and innovative spirit to boost the country's
fortunes. He emerged as prime minister only after a battle with
party reformers.
	   The new government has not been entirely inactive: Obuchi has
cleared the way for more deficit spending to spur lagging
consumption, and he has put together a special economic council
that has vowed to come up with reforms without interference with
Japan's powerful _ and conservative _ bureaucracy.
	   But the effects of those moves will take time to be felt in the
economy and depend in part on other unpredictable factors _ such as
the general pessimism among consumers that has encouraged them to
save more and spend less.
	   In the meantime, the sour economic news trickles in day by day.
On Monday alone, the government announced declines in department
store sales, housing starts and factory production.
	   ``The longer the government waits to move, the worse it will
get,'' said Shipley of Schroders. ``And it will get worse quite
quickly.''

500 days to fix millennium computer glitch: Disaster or

inconvenience? &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: This is the main story in a package about the so-called Y2K
(Year 2000) problem. With just 500 days remaining until the
calendar flips to the year 2000, there is great uncertainty about
whether millions of computers will become confused about the date
and malfunction. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Inside a suburban home darkened by a power
outage from a summer thunderstorm, the top bureaucrat hired by
President Bill Clinton to make sure the computers in the United
States survive past 2000 was just trying to survive the evening's
muggy weather.
	   Lightning had knocked out electricity to the neighborhood,
leaving John Koskinen and his wife without air conditioning.
Inside, with flickering candles casting the only light, the
temperature and humidity climbed.
	   ``You know,'' Koskinen recalls telling his wife, ``this could be
what it's like on January 1st, 2000.''
	   With just 500 days remaining, the coming 2000 looms almost
mythically, largely because of a decision made decades ago by
computer programmers.
	   Left uncorrected, the Year 2000 computer flaw, commonly known as
Y2K, could threaten the world's electrical grids, its financial
markets, its water supplies and its air-traffic control systems. It
probably won't affect the computer chips in your television or VCR,
and your car or pickup probably will start, but the traffic lights
or the subway might be fouled on the way to work.
	   ``Over the last 20 years, we've grown more and more reliant on
information technology,'' said Koskinen, chairman of the
President's Council on Year 2000 Conversion. ``We're able to
produce all sorts of stuff for less than we used to, but it comes
with a risk. Everything is interconnected.''
	   The roots of the problem date back to the earliest days of the
high-tech industry, when every byte of computer code counted
because information storage costs were super-expensive. Mostly to
save money, early programmers represented each year by its last two
digits rather than by all four _ 1972 became 72. Trouble begins
when computers try to add or subtract dates using that two-digit
format and the world approaches the Year 2000, or 00.
	   A few examples of what could go wrong if computers are not fixed
in time:
	   _A telephone call that begins just before midnight Dec. 31, 1999
and ends minutes later on Jan. 1, 2000, could be billed as a
99-year conversation.
	   _Many ATM machines will refuse to spit out money.
	   _A credit-card bill owed on Jan. 7, 2000, could be mistaken as
99 years past due.
	   _Social Security computers might refuse to issue a check to a
woman born in 1912 because it might appear she hasn't been born
yet.
	   _Computers that regulate the flow of electricity through power
grids could become confused, producing widespread blackouts, while
similar problems could disrupt telephone service and shut off water
supplies.
	   _Some coffee makers won't brew.
	   _Even some of America's weapons systems might not work.
	   Contrary to one popular rumor, weapons systems susceptible to
the Y2K problem will turn themselves off rather than turn
themselves on, explained Koskinen. ``The chances for world peace on
January 1st, 2000,'' he said jokingly, ``may be better than ever.''
	   Then again, he added, defense failures in foreign countries
could cause tensions to escalate: ``What happens with Russia when
its warning systems go black?''
	   Tests of computers that do all sorts of jobs show the problem is
real enough. For example, when Chrysler rolled its clocks forward
to simulate 2000 at one of its Michigan assembly plants,
computerized security gates wouldn't let anyone in or out.
	   But just what will go wrong when the calendar flips to the year
2000, and whether society will face a disaster or a mere
inconvenience, is anybody's guess. What happens will depend on how
many computers are fixed in the next 500 days and what is
controlled by those computers that aren't fixed in time.
	   The size of the job is staggering. In the United States alone,
there are 157 billion software functions that need to be checked
according to Capers Jones of Software Productivity Research, a
software consulting firm in Burlington, Mass. And the 30 most
industrialized countries of the world have an estimated 700
billion.
	   The larger, old mainframe computers still used by government and
big corporations for many vital functions are particularly
vulnerable. But the problem isn't limited to them. The electronics
industry has found that some microprocessors _ tiny chips used on
circuit boards in everything from coffee makers to oil tankers _
are susceptible and must physically be replaced.
	   The government figures that only 1 percent to 2 percent of all
those chips might be faulty, but there are billions of them, and
you can't tell which ones will fail without checking every one of
them.
	   ``You don't know which of those chips, and you don't know where
they are,'' said Sen. Robert Bennett, chairman of the Senate's Year
2000 committee.
	   Estimates of the cost of fixing the Y2K problem in America alone
range from dlrs 40 billion to dlrs 200 billion, and worldwide
estimates are as high as dlrs 600 billion.
	   ``The costs of fixing the Year 2000 problem appear to constitute
the most expensive business problem in human history,'' Jones said.
	   The Securities and Exchange Commission considers Y2K so
significant that, on Aug. 5, it required public companies,
investment companies and state and local governments to disclose
their preparedness and contingency plans and to describe how the
problem will materially affect them.

	   While many companies, such as AT and T, and some government
agencies, including the Social Security Administration, are
reportedly well along in fixing their computers, others are far
behind and some are just beginning to analyze the problem. More
than 80 percent of large U.S. firms are behind schedule in fixing
their computer bugs, according to a survey by the Cap Gemini
America consulting firm.
	   Because industries and government agencies rely on one another
to do business, those that fix their own computers still could run
into trouble.
	   For example, Social Security computers might all be working, but
Social Security checks are actually issued by the Treasury
Department's Financial Management Service, which is reportedly far
behind on Y2K. Manufacturers could fix their computers and still be
confounded by the computer problems of their suppliers.
	   If power grids fail, even fixed computers won't work. Earlier
this year, a Senate panel surveyed 10 of the nation's largest
utilities serving 50 million people and found none had a complete
contingency plan for computer failure. One didn't know how many
lines of computer code it had, making it impossible to know how
difficult or time-consuming its Y2K problem will be to solve.
Because electricity is distributed on a grid with many suppliers, a
failure at any one of them could lead to widespread disruptions.
	   Thus, the uncertainty about what will befall us 500 days from
now.
	   Alex Patelis, an associate economist at Goldman Sachs, predicts
economic disruptions comparable to the trouble caused by a major
natural disaster such as a hurricane _ damaging but not enough to
create panic or throw the country into a recession.
	   Edward Yardeni, chief economist and global investment strategist
at Deutsche Bank Securities, on the other hand, warns of the
likelihood of major disruptions to the global economy.
	   Still others, fearing economic collapse and civil disorder, are
laying in supplies of ammunition, water and canned goods _
preparing for Y2K as they might for a nuclear attack.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The question of whether the Year 2000 glitch
will affect personal computers at home or in the office can be
answered with a frustrating ``maybe.''
	   Desktop computers and laptops built after 1997 and used for
simple tasks such as word processing likely will have no problems
when the century rolls over. But older PCs, or those running very
complex applications, could be bitten by the millennium bug.
	   Every computer has a built-in clock chip that ticks once per
second, or in some cases 60 times per second. A part of the
computer called the BIOS (for Basic Input-Output System) accesses
or updates the clock and is used whenever the operating system or
other applications need a date calculation.
	   Problems arise when the millennium rolls around. Depending on
the make and model of the PC, the machine will think it's Jan. 1,
2000, which is right, or Jan. 1, 1900, which isn't.
	   Your checkbook program could be thrown out of whack, with checks
written after Jan. 1, 2000, treated as if they were 100 years old.
Computers also keep track of the date that files are created. If
the date is off, the computer might erase the newest files when it
goes through a hard-drive maintenance because it thinks the files
haven't been opened in a century.
	   It should be noted that this is a problem primarily for people
running a version of Microsoft Windows on a machine using
Intel-style chips. Apple Macintosh computers, as their users often
smugly point out, never had a problem computing dates past the
millennium. However, this doesn't mean that every application for
the Mac will continue to function properly.
	   Don't expect the latest versions of Windows 95 and Windows 98
running on a Pentium II chip to have problems. But don't be
surprised if that 386-based computer you bought in 1992 that still
runs Windows 3.1 or MS-DOS doesn't compute dates properly.
	   How do you know if the machine that holds your checkbook is
going to keep calculating dates correctly? First, set the computer
clock to Dec. 31, 1999, 11:59 p.m. and wait. If the clock seems to
roll over correctly, and everything seems to work fine, your BIOS
is probably OK.
	   Now shut off the computer and wait a few minutes. Turn it back
on. Is the date still a few minutes after midnight, Jan. 1, 2000?
Good, your clock chip is fine, too.
	   But if you're unlucky enough to find this is not the case, take
cold comfort in the knowledge that you're not alone.
	   Karl Fielder, whose company Greenwich Mean Time specializes in
Year 2000 work, tested 500 computer models and brands and found
that some worked fine with the date change and some didn't. Even
when two BIOSes appeared identical, the test results sometimes
varied.
	   Fielder also found that 93 percent of BIOSes installed in
machines made prior to 1997 failed. For machines manufactured in
1997, 47 percent failed. Most machines shipped this year will be
fine.
	   But don't fret. Most BIOSes can be replaced for free by
contacting the computer manufacturer. If the clock chip has to be
replaced, it's usually a pretty simple procedure costing under dlrs
20. However, you may run into problems if your machine is so old _
say 1983 or so _ that the manufacturer doesn't stock parts for it
anymore.
	   Applications that use dates, such as checkbook programs,
calendars or spreadsheet programs, also should be checked. If they
choke on a post-2000 date, it's time to upgrade to a newer version
or another program that can handle the millennium. This might be
inconvenient but hardly a major hassle if you start testing your
home or office machine now.

Y2K bug tough technical nut to crack
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With FEA-US-Y2K Crunch &QL; 
 &UR; By CHRIS ALLBRITTON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Cyberspace Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The sheer number of unique solutions needed for
the Year 2000 bug, not the technical aspects, are the real problem
behind this glitch in time.
	   There is no one-size-fits-all answer. Because large
organizations usually tailor computer systems specifically for
their own use, the software to correct the problem at one bank or
utility generally won't work at others.
	   The Year 2000 bug, also known as Y2K, arose from the fact that
most old mainframe computers still running keep track only of the
last two digits of the year. The computer assumes the first two
digits are 1 and 9. To the computer, 1999 is just 99. That means
the computer will interpret 00 not as 2000 but as 1900, throwing
the date calculation off by 100 years.
	   The problem dates to the 1960s and 1970s, when computer memory
was scarce and expensive. Computers filled entire rooms and cost
millions back then, so smart programmers squeezed every last bit of
memory from the systems.
	   Programmers who built the old mainframe computers didn't
anticipate the problem because they never thought these machines
would last 20 years. But today, these mammoth computers are still
running great portions of society.
	   Because the two-digit method for dates became standard for
computers, the bug also exists in the software of many personal
computers made before 1997, and in the computer chips embedded in
many products, from automatic coffee makers to ATMs.
	   To fix the problem, every computer system's software must be
checked and tested. Multiply this by the millions of computers
around the world and the hundreds of billions of lines of computer
code, and it's obvious that, come the new century, industrial
society will have more than a New Year's hangover to deal with.
	   ``The sheer magnitude is the essence (of the problem),'' said
Jerry Trognitz, a computer analyst working on the problem for
Frito-Lay.
	   In the United States, there are about 157 billion software
functions that need to be checked, according to Capers Jones of
Software Productivity Research. The 30 most significant
industrialized countries have a total of 700 billion vulnerable
software functions. Every one of them must be checked, Jones said,
and estimated the global bill at around dlrs 3.6 trillion.
	   And it's not just software in large organizations. Not only
might we have disruptions in billing and financial systems, but the
distribution of electricity, heating oil, transportation and hot
water could be affected because of the reliance on microchips.
	   Billions of microchips have built-in date functions. The chips
can be found in chemical and steel plants, food and drug
processing, aircraft, oil rigs, health care equipment,
communications systems, elevators and security systems.
	   Many of these chips may fail when 1-1-00 rolls around, so
critical chips need to be located, tested and physically replaced
if necessary.
	   ``The costs of fixing the Year 2000 problem appear to constitute
the most expensive business problem in human history,'' Jones said.

<TEXT>
	   SUVA, Fiji (AP) _ When the millennium bug creeps across the face
of the Earth at midnight on Dec. 31, 1999, Fiji could be one of the
first countries bitten.
	   As clocks tick into the new millennium, old computer systems
that mark the date with just the last two digits of the year will
be incapable of distinguishing between 2000 and 1900.
	   Doomsayers claim the glitch, called the Year 2000 (Y2K) problem
or millennium bug, will wreak havoc.
	   Just east of the international date line, Fiji and a handful of
other Pacific island nations are up to 12 hours ahead of the rest
of the world, so they will be first in line to see the clocks
change _ and the repercussions.
	   Bad luck? Maybe, but enterprising Fiji is turning the potential
disaster to its advantage by promoting itself as the place where
businesses and others can see what's in store.
	   As part of global television coverage of millennium night events
in Fiji, computers will be set up so viewers can watch as the
computer bug bites, Misa Lesuma, an official of the event
organizing committee, said Tuesday.
	   Fiji could be one of the first countries to have its television,
communications, airline, airport, power, banking and other vital
services crippled, he said.
	   Scattered bug bites are already being felt. For example, the
United States government is throwing out old but durable computer
systems that work all right except for the Y2K problem.
	   Under some scenarios, the disruption will be so great the world
economy will sag from the weight of it. But skeptics say Y2K is a
large but straightforward problem that is causing hysteria.
	   Meanwhile in Fiji, many say the government's plan to televise it
won't work, anyway. Just as things get interesting, the bug will
chomp and television transmission from the island will fizzle out.

Mild earthquake hits Manila, nearby provinces
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ A mild earthquake shook Manila and
nearby provinces before dawn Tuesday, but there were no immediate
reports of damage or casualties, government seismologists said.
	   The temblor with a preliminary magnitude of 4.3 was the second
to hit the capital in more than a week and could have been
triggered by an offshore fault that generated the first one,
seismologists said.
	   The latest earthquake occurred at 3:16 a.m. (1916 GMT Monday),
affecting several areas of metropolitan Manila and the nearby
northern provinces of Pampanga and Zambales, said the Philippine
Institute of Volcanology and Seismology.
	   It was centered beneath the seabed about seven kilometers (4.3
miles) southwest of the coastal town of San Felipe in Zambales and
was probably caused by movement in a fault that triggered a 6.1
magnitude shock on Aug. 23, seismologist Delfin Garcia said.
	   The Aug. 23 earthquake knocked items off store shelves and
alarmed many people in the capital because it happened
simultaneously with thunder and hail storms that briefly cut off
power.
	   The Philippines is located in one of the most earthquake-prone
regions in the world.

Japanese stocks fall, dollar lower in Tokyo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with late-morning stock, dollar, and bond prices.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese stock prices dropped sharply Tuesday
morning following a plunge on Wall Street overnight as investors
sold off shares of big exporters such as Sony Corp. The U.S. dollar
fell against the yen.
	   Hong Kong stocks were also hit hard by the decline in New York
shares with the key index there falling more than 3 percent in
early trading.
	   In Tokyo, the benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell
178.87 points, or 1.27 percent, to close the morning session at
13,929.02. It had risen 192.26 points, or 1.38 percent, the
previous day.
	   The dollar bought 139.23 yen in morning trading, down 1.96 yen
from late trading in Tokyo on Monday and also below its level of
140.78 yen in late New York trading.
	   In Japan, government officials tried to play down worries that
Wall Street's massive decline would trigger an equally dramatic
fall here. But traders and investors said a big drop in Tokyo was
inevitable.
	   The Dow Jones industrial average posted its second-biggest point
loss ever on Monday, falling 512.61 points, or 6.4 percent, to
close at 7,539.07.
	   At one point, the Nikkei fell as low as 13,664.74 in early
trading, a new 12-year low, before recovering slightly. On Friday
the average dropped below 14,000 for the first time since March
1986.
	   In Tokyo, exporters such as Sony and Canon Inc. pulled the Tokyo
market lower amid worry the Dow's fall may signal a slowdown in
profit growth from sales in the U.S. by these export-dependent
companies, traders said.
	   ``These companies trade as global blue chips and basically
follow the Dow's moves,'' said Dhia Amir, institutional sales
trader at Nomura Securities.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange declined 21.32 points, or
1.93 percent, to 1,085.17. On Monday, it had gained 19.50 points,
or 1.79 percent.
	   A top Japanese economic official said there was no reason to
worry the fall in New York would weigh heavily on Japan.
	   ``I don't think we are in a stage of chain reaction,'' said
Taichi Sakaiya, the head of the Economic Planning Agency.
	   Sakaiya also said the strengthening of the yen against the
dollar was ``directly related to the stock fall in the U.S.''
	   Worries that political wrangling between the government and
opposition parties will delay plans to clean up Japan's debt-ridden
banks also hurt shares prices, traders said.
	   ``No one sees any light at the end of the tunnel in the
oppositions's fight with the government,'' said Nomura's Amir.
	   Meanwhile, shares in Hong Kong took a bigger tumble.
	   News that Standard and Poor's slashed Hong Kong's credit rating,
combined with the sharp falls on global markets, drove Hong Kong
stocks sharply lower early Tuesday.
	   Shortly after the opening bell, the blue-chip Hang Seng Index
had lost 226.33 points, or 3.1 percent, to 7048.71.
	   On the Tokyo foreign exchange market, the dollar weakened amid
concern over plummeting stock prices on Wall Street and continuing
political turmoil in Russia, traders said.
	   ``It's now the dollar's problem that's driving trading, instead
of some other currencies','' said Yoneo Sakai, general manager of
the international treasury division at Fuji Bank Ltd.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond fell to 1.020 percent from Monday's finish of 1.040
percent, driving its price up to 113.01 yen from 112.86 yen.

Troubled Lucic finds fun at U.S. Open
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HAL BOCK &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ With each shot, each serve, each return,
16-year-old Mirjana Lucic pushed her off-court troubles further
away Monday night in a 6-3, 6-2 victory over Kristie Boogert at the
U.S. Open.
	   The tennis was the easy part. Reliving the abuse, physical and
mental, that she had fled, was much more difficult.
	   ``There were a lot of things going on all these years,'' Lucic
said. ``I try to forget everything that has been going on and focus
on my tennis.''
	   Lucic found herself in the middle of some serious turmoil after
fleeing her native Croatia and accusing her father of abusing her.
She talked of beatings, sometimes because of a lost match,
sometimes because of poor practices.
	   Finally, it became too much.
	   ``It was a tough time, mentally and physically,'' Lucic said.
``It was going on for a long time. I couldn't handle it anymore.'',
	   Lucic refused to discuss details of the abuse.
	   ``To explain how it was, I don't think people want to know
that,'' she said. ``I'm here to play tennis, not to remember all
those bad moments. I don't deserve that anymore. I just want to
play my tennis.''
	   Lucic burst into prominence a year ago when she won her her
first pro tournament and reached the finals of three other events.
	   She said the abuse started after that and she has struggled this
year, beaten in the second round of the Australian Open and
Wimbledon. It was after Wimbledon, that she decided to leave her
father.
	   Marinko Lucic, who also was Mirjana's coach and advisor, has
denied charges that he mistreated his daughter over tennis.
	   Mirjana Lucic said she had the chicken pox before Wimbledon and
that she was weak from the illness. ``There were some personal
problems, but most of it was I was not healthy,'' she said.
	   When she fled her homeland, Lucic was accompanied by her mother
and two brothers and two sisters. She spent the last two weeks
preparing for the Open at Nick Bollettieri's tennis academy in
Bradenton, Florida, and said she felt safe on and off the court.
Her mother, sisters and brothers were in the stands, watching her
first-round match Monday night.
	   Lucic had little trouble, winning in just 66 minutes.
	   ``It's the first time in a long time I am having fun, enjoying
myself, focused on tennis and trying to win,'' she said. ``This is
a new beginning for me.''
	   Lucic said her situation was not unique.
	   ``It's not just my case,'' she said. ``I know it is still going
on with a lot of other players. It's just not right. A lot of
players say the same things happen to them.
	   ``Parents must be there to support you. That is the only thing
players should get from parents.''

Australian sharemarket dips lower
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With AP Photos SYD101-102 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australia's sharemarket dived three
percent by noon (0200 GMT) Tuesday, shaken by Wall Street's second
biggest fall in history overnight.
	   At 1202 Australian Eastern Standard Time, the benchmark all
ordinaries index had plunged 83.3 points, or 3.36 per cent, at
2397.4, but above its morning low of 2386.7.
	   Wall Street lost 250 points in the last half hour of frenzied
trading to close 512.6 points, or 6.37 per cent, lower at 7539.1.
	   One dealer said the question now was how quickly the Australian
market would recover.
	   ``Do we have a snap back rally to this or do we go up by the
stairs?'' the dealer said. ``The Australian sharemarket represents
excellent value, our fundamentals are fine. It's just a pity of our
geographical locality.''
	   The all resources index had dropped 26.1 points, or 2.85 per

<TEXT>
	   CLEVELAND (AP) _ Richie Sexson hit a two-run single in
Cleveland's biggest first inning in 44 years on Monday night, and
drove in four runs, including his fourth homer in three days, as
the Indians beat the Oakland Athletics 15-6.
	   Hours after acquiring second baseman Joey Cora from Seattle for
David Bell, the Indians scored 10 runs in their first at-bat for
the first time since July 6, 1954. Cora scored twice in the inning.
	   Manny Ramirez hit his career-high 34th homer and drove in five
runs, giving him 118 RBIs.
	   Oakland's Rickey Henderson became the sixth player to steal
2,000 bases, joining Ty Cobb, Hank Aaron, Babe Ruth, Pete Rose and
Willie Mays.
	   Dave Burba (12-9) won his second straight start after going
winless since July 1.
	   A's starter Blake Stein (5-8) allowed all eight batters he faced
to reach base and score.
 &UR; Rangers 13, Tigers 2
	   In Detroit, Juan Gonzalez drove in seven runs with a homer,
triple and two doubles as Texas moved within 2{ games of idle
Ananheim in the AL West with the victory.
	   Gonzalez upped his major league-leading RBI total to 143. He hit
two-run doubles in each of the first two innings. He added his 39th
homer in the fourth and tripled home another run in the sixth.
	   He just missed becoming only the second Ranger to hit for the
cycle when Bobby Higginson ran down his low liner to medium right
in the eighth.
	   Gonzalez's four extra-base hits set a Rangers record, and the
seven RBIs were one shy of his career high. All of his damage came
off Bryce Florie (6-9), who also lost 8-6 to the Rangers last week.
Gonzalez went 8-for-8 with two homers, a triple, five doubles and
12 RBIs against him in those two games.
	   Esteban Loaiza (3-3) allowed two runs and six hits in eight
innings for the win.
 &UR; Red Sox 5, Mariners 1
	   In Boston, Nomar Garciaparra moved closer to joining an
exclusive home run list with his 29th homer in Boston's victory.
	   With the homer, Garciaparra is one away from becoming only the
fifth player in major league history to hit 30 or more homers in
his first two seasons. The other four are Rudy York in 1937-38, Ron
Kittle in 1983-84, Jose Canseco 1986-87 and Mark McGwire in
1987-88.
	   Ken Griffey Jr., who hit a pair of homers in a win over the New
York Yankees on Sunday, went 2-for-4 and has an AL-leading 47
homers.
	   Bret Saberhagen (12-6) allowed four hits over 6 2-3 innings as
Boston won for just the second time in five games.
	   Seattle starter Jeff Fassero (10-11) allowed five runs, four
earned, on seven hits and struck out seven and walked three in 7
1-3 innings.
 &UR; White Sox 4, Orioles 1
	   In Baltimore, Albert Belle hit his 41st homer and James Baldwin
pitched seven strong innings as the White Sox extended the Orioles'
losing streak to eight games.
	   Greg Norton also homered for the White Sox, who have won six of
eight. Chicago is 7-2 against Baltimore this season, outscoring the
Orioles 64-39.
	   Baldwin (9-5) was yanked in the eighth after giving up a leadoff
single and a walk. He allowed six hits, one walk and an unearned
run in seven innings.
	   Belle's homer, a two-run shot off Scott Erickson in the first
inning, tied him with Frank Thomas for the club record in one
season. Belle has 121 RBIs, second in the AL behind Juan Gonzalez
of Texas.
	   Lenny Webster had two hits and drove in the lone run for the
Orioles.
	   Erickson (14-11) allowed four runs and eight hits over
seven-plus innings in falling to 3-11 lifetime against the White
Sox.
 &UR; Twins 2, Devil Rays 1
	   In Minneapolis, Bob Tewksbury, the subject of trade rumors,
pitched seven scoreless innings in Minnesota's victory.
	   Tewksbury (7-9) allowed five hits, including four singles, and
only one Devil Rays runner reached third base. Tewksbury didn't
walk a batter and struck out six.
	   Rick Aguilera earned his 34th save with a scoreless ninth.
	   Tony Saunders (4-13) gave up eight hits, all singles, struck out
six and didn't walk a batter in eight innings.
	   The Twins scored both of their runs in the third. Brent Gates,
Paul Molitor and Marty Cordova hit consecutive one-out singles to
right field for the first run. Molitor scored on Ron Coomer's
sacrifice fly.
	   Mike DiFelice accounted for Tampa Bay's only run with a leadoff
solo homer in the eighth off reliever Mike Trombley.

Cubs 5, Reds 4

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Sammy Sosa took two curtain calls _ one for
himself and one for Kerry Wood.
	   Sosa hit his 55th homer in the third inning to tie Mark McGwire
for the major league lead Monday night as the Chicago Cubs defeated
the Cincinnati Reds 5-4.
	   Sosa moved within one homer of tying Hack Wilson's 68-year-old
club and National League record when he lined an 0-1 pitch from
Brett Tomko (11-11) into the left-field bleachers in the third.
	   After the two-run homer cut the Reds' lead to 4-2, Sosa came out
of the dugout and _ as he has so many times this season _
acknowledged the adulation from a frenzied Wrigley Field crowd.
	   Wood lined a two-run homer in the fourth, his second this
season, to give Chicago a 5-4 lead, but when fans chanted for him
to come back onto the field, he didn't respond.
	   No problem.
	   Sosa, who seconds earlier had given Wood an enormous bear hug,
jumped up on the dugout step and waved to the fans again, gladly
taking a bow for his young teammate.
	   Wood (13-6) went six innings, striking out 10 and allowing four
runs and six hits. He was pulled after throwing 117 pitches. Rod
Beck pitched the ninth for his 40th save.
 &UR; Cardinals 5, Marlins 3 &QC; 
	   In Miami, Mark McGwire went 0-for-3 and lost his lead in the
home-run race, but teammate Brian Jordan homered to help St. Louis.
	   Sammy Sosa hit his 55th homer in the third inning of the Chicago
Cubs' game against Cincinnati, tying him with McGwire. Both need
one homer to equal Hack Wilson's 68-year-old NL record of 56.
	   McGwire struck out twice, walked twice and fouled out. He fell
to 0-for-9 lifetime against Marlins starter Kirt Ojala (1-4).
	   McGwire worked the count to 3-2 on each of his five trips to the
plate, with the crowd of 36,584 rooting for the Cardinals slugger.
They booed the pitcher when he failed to throw a strike and jeered
umpire Angel Hernandez when he called a strike.
	   Against Ojala, McGwire fouled out with two on in the first,
walked in the third and struck out swinging at an 86-mph fastball
in the fifth.
	   Against Brian Edmonson, McGwire took a called third strike in
the seventh. McGwire, who was ejected for protesting a called third
strike Saturday, this time argued briefly and then walked away from
the plate shaking his head.
	   Darren Oliver (2-2) allowed Florida three runs in six innings.
Juan Acevedo pitched a scoreless ninth for his fifth save.
 &UR; Astros 4, Braves 3
	   In Atlanta, Houston scored three runs in the ninth on six
singles and rallied to win for the 41st time this season.
	   Houston, held to just two hits in the first eight innings by
John Smoltz (13-3), got five straight singles to start the ninth.
	   Trailing 3-1, Craig Biggio, Bill Spiers and Derek Bell singled
to load the bases and chase Smoltz, who had won eight straight
decisions and hadn't lost since June 26 _ a span of 12 starts.
	   Kerry Ligtenberg, who converted 18 straight save opportunities
before blowing one Friday night, replaced Smoltz and gave up RBI
singles to Jeff Bagwell and Moises Alou.
	   With two outs, Brad Ausmus lined a single to right to score
Bell. Right fielder Gerald Williams kept the Braves within a run by
throwing out Bagwell out at the plate on the play.
	   Jay Powell (5-5) got the win despite allowing a solo homer to
Chipper Jones in the eighth. Billy Wagner gave up a leadoff single
in the ninth before getting his 26th save.
	   Javy Lopez homered for Atlanta and Andruw Jones was credited
with a steal of home.

Reports: Police test recovered arsenic for similarities with deadly
</HEADLINE>
poison

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Police have recovered a large quantity of an
arsenic acid compound which they are testing for similarities to
arsenic used in a mass poisoning at a recent festival in western
Japan, news reports said Tuesday.
	   The arsenic acid compound was reportedly turned over to police
by an acquaintance of a person who lives near the site of the
deadly poisonings in Wakayama, a small coastal city 453 kilometers
(283 miles) southwest of Tokyo.
	   Four people died _ including two children _ and dozens of others
were sickened after eating curried rice laced with arsenic at a
community festival held in late July.
	   The shop proprietor who provided police with an 18-liter
(4.7-gallon) container filled with the imported arsenic acid
compound said the material was given to him six or seven years ago
by the friend, the Yomiuri newspaper reported.
	   This acquaintance is the same person who had regular contact
with a pair of men who were apparently sickened by arsenic well
before the recent curry poisonings in Wakayama, Kyodo News agency
said.
	   Local police declined to comment on the reports, none of which
provided names for those mentioned in the stories.
	   Police have already reportedly begun investigating the person
living near the site of the festival for an alleged role in
possible insurance fraud involving generous life insurance payments
made on behalf of the two sickened men.
	   Separately, officials at an elementary school attended by one of
the two children killed by the poisoned curry have decided to
remove curried rice from the cafeteria menu, Kyodo news reported.
	   Classes at the school resumed Tuesday following a summer recess.

Shares plunge after Hong Kong's credit rating slashed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong stocks plunged early Tuesday on news
that a credit rating agency slashed the territory's credit rating
and after sharp falls on global markets.
	   The government, which already has spent an estimated 15 percent
of its dlrs 96 billion in foreign reserves, continued to stay
sidelined after its two-week stock buying spree in a battle against
speculators. That absence contributing to the downward spiral,
analysts said.
	   The blue-chip Hang Seng Index plunged 3.5 percent to 7,018.68
points after one hour of trading, adding to Monday's 7.1-percent
fall.
	   On Monday, Standard and Poor's slashed Hong Kong's credit
rating, citing recent government intervention in the stock and
stock futures markets, which it said was ``an increasingly complex,
and risky, strategy'' to fend off speculators.
	   It said the government is likely to suffer huge losses in the
stock market with its massive accumulation of shares, ``unless the
downward trend in global equity prices is reversed.''
	   ``If the government continues to intervene it will just receive
more criticism from overseas,'' said Henry Lui, an analyst at
Mansion House Securities.
	   ``We will ask `will the government intervene?' If they do, we
will have a controlled market, and if that's the case, it would
deter future potential investors,'' said Steven Thompson, chief
banking and conglomerates analyst for Nikko Securities (Asia).
	   S and P also downgraded the credit rating of Hongkong and
Shanghai Banking Corp., the territory's largest bank and a
subsidiary of the market's largest share, HSBC Holdings.
	   HSBC was off 4 percent to 158.50 Hong Kong dollars (dlrs 20.32)
in early trading.
	   On Monday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 6.4 percent, or
512.61 points, to close at 7539.07, suffering its second-largest
drop in points ever. The average has now erased all of 1998's
gains.
	   In Tokyo on Tuesday, Japanese stock prices dropped sharply in
morning trading following a plunge on Wall Street overnight as
investors sold off shares of big exporters such as Sony Corp. The
U.S. dollar fell against the yen.
	   In Tokyo, the benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell
178.87 points, or 1.27 percent, to close the morning session at
13,929.02. It had risen 192.26 points, or 1.38 percent, the
previous day.

Hackers vandalize government's website
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Computer hackers have pulled the first
prank of Australia's election campaign, altering the government's
website to declare John Howard the ``Prime Minister for Pain,
Suffering and Inequity.''
	   The ruling Liberal Party had cleaned up the site by Tuesday
morning following the assault by hackers Monday.
	   The Daily Telegraph newspaper reported that Howard had become
``The Dishonorable John Howard MP: Prime Minister for Pain,
Suffering and Inequity'' on the Liberal's site. Treasurer Peter
Costello became ``Minister for the Rich, Stomping the Poor and
Wrecking the Economy'' and Foreign Minister Alexander Downer
``Minister for Foreign Humiliation''.
	   Downer's site was also linked to Disneyland.com while Workplace
Relations Minister Peter Reith became ``Minister for Destruction of
Workplace Fairness, the Gestapo and Propaganda.''
	   Other minister's names were linked to websites displaying
explicit pornography.
	   The Liberal Party removed the website once the hacker attack was
discovered and today most of the ministers' sites had regained
their proper titles and links.
	   Australia's federal election will be held Oct. 3.

One Nation surges in latest Australian polling
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Pauline Hanson's One Nation party has
surged in opinion polling during the first week of the federal
election campaign, recording 10 percent support across the nation,
according to a newspaper poll.
	   A Newspoll in Tuesday's The Australian newspaper showed the
governing Liberal-National coalition and opposition Labor Party
tied at 40 percent with One Nation in a position to possibly take
the balance of power in both the House of Representatives and the
Senate. The election will be held Oct. 3.
	   The paper said preference deals meant One Nation candidates
stood little chance of being elected outright in the house of
representatives, although their preferences could be crucial in
determining the outcome in closely-fought seats.
	   Incumbent John Howard was the preferred prime minister at 39
percent, with Labor leader Kim Beazley at 37 percent, although 24
percent of those surveyed were uncommitted.
	   The poll also showed support for Labor's tax package, with 41
percent of those surveyed indicating they preferred it, compared
with 37 percent nominating the coalition's plan, which includes the
introduction of a goods and services tax.
	   Newspoll managing director Sol Lebovic said there was a high 22
percent who were uncommitted on the relative merits of the tax
plans for the coalition and Labor. The coalition lost an election
when touting a GST in 1993.
	   The telephone poll of 1,153 voters nationwide was taken over
Aug. 28-30 and had a margin of error of 2.8 percent.
	   Howard said he would likely quit politics if defeated in the
Oct. 3 election.
	   ``I'd spend a bit of time doing some charitable work, I'd find
something else to do,'' he said.
	   ``I believe we deserve to be reelected ... but I'm realistic
enough to believe that anything can happen in politics and I'm
quite open and frank about it.''

Sampras, Seles, Agassi straight-set victors at Open
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS throughout, UPDATES with Agassi victory &QL; 
 &UR; By LARRY SIDDONS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ White for day, black for night. And on that
fashion note, Pete Sampras and another pair of former champions got
the U.S. Open started on a run that could end in Grand Slam
history.
	   Sampras, dressed all in white, but no country-club gentleman,
starred on a sun-drenched Monday afternoon on the Stadium Court.
	   Showing a little more of his top-ranked game with each
changeover, Sampras swaggered into the second round, tossing aside
the big serves of Marc Goellner for a 6-3, 6-2, 6-2 victory.
	   Black was the color of the night on the main court, but the
results were the same.
	   Monica Seles, wearing a black dress to mourn this spring's death
of her father, outslugged Florencia Labat of Argentina 7-6 (7-0),
6-2.
	   And Andre Agassi, merely making another in a series of fashion
statements, beat France's Sebastien Grosjean in the last match of
opening day, 6-4, 6-1, 6-4.
	   The afternoon crowd didn't see the best Sampras, the one who
took Wimbledon for the fifth time and is trying to add a fifth U.S.
title _ and record-tying 12th Grand Slam singles crown.
	   It didn't have to be. Goellner, a 27-year-old German, last won a
match more than two months ago. His game consists primarily of a
first serve that reaches 115 mph if he's on, and against Sampras
much more is needed.
	   Sampras had 11 aces and dropped just 15 points on his serve,
clocking one first-set ace at 131 mph (210 kph). He didn't allow
Goellner, ranked 109th in the world, a break point, and toyed with
him from both baseline and net in winning in just 84 minutes.
	   ``You just try to get through the early rounds,'' said Sampras,
eliminated in the fourth round a year ago. ``It's nice to get that
monkey off your back and get into the tournament. I tried to stay
focused and I think I did.''
	   Six more wins over the next two weeks and Sampras joins Roy
Emerson as the only players to win an even dozen Grand Slam singles
tournaments, the milestone the tradition-minded Californian
treasures above all others.
	   ``What more can you do in the game? Win the French Open, maybe,
or all four Slams in one year,'' Sampras said. The French Open, on
clay, is the only Grand Slam tournament Sampras has not won.
	   ``I'm thinking of entering the ladies' tournament next year,''
he said. ``Maybe I can get lucky and win that.''
	   Adding a second Grand Slam title for the year also would do
plenty to clinch the No. 1 ranking for the season, the sixth
straight year that would end with Sampras on top, breaking the
record he shares with Jimmy Connors.
	   ``All those records are important to me,'' Sampras said. ``I'm
not focused on this tournament any more than any U.S. Open, but I
hope to get some things done over the next two weeks.''
	   No fighting words there, nothing for defending champion Patrick
Rafter, No. 2 Marcelo Rios or any other challenger to hang on the
refrigerator for inspiration.
	   Sampras is no trash-talker. But he has an edge, and the crowd
that half-filled the 20,000-seat Arthur Ashe Stadium saw it a
couple times against Goellner.
	   Meek Pete looked positively McEnroesque as he stared down a line
judge he felt missed an ace. He smirked at the umpire, and tried to
get the fans who remained in the third set back into the match,
waving his arms like a cheerleader.
	   He even took a light shot at Emerson, the storied Aussie who won
a large share of his Slams while Rod Laver was on the sidelines in
the dispute between amateur tennis and the emerging professionals.
	   ``I am not trying to take anything away from Emerson and what he
did, but the competition is probably tougher today than it was 30
years ago,'' he said. ``Laver could have had 15 or 20.''
	   That's not dissing anyone or stepping out of character, Sampras
said. Just responding to the surroundings.
	   ``This is the most hectic of the Grand Slams,'' he said. ``You
walk out at Wimbledon and you feel the history. You walk out here
and you feel the electricity.''
	   The player Sampras beat at Wimbledon, 14th-seeded Goran
Ivanisevic, had 23 aces in a 6-3, 6-4, 6-4 victory over Australia's
Mark Woodforde.
	   Agassi, who is seeded eighth and could meet Sampras in the
quarterfinals, kept Grosjean pinned to the baseline with forehands
and slicing backhands. After wasting a string of break points in
the third set, the 1994 Open camp finally broke for a 5-4 lead and
served out the match at love.
	   ``I like to be here,'' Agassi said of a tournament where he has
played consistently well and a court he called ``super-fast.''
	   ``You have to prioritize tournaments, but this is certainly at
the top of my list. This is a city where I've had some fantastic
results.''
	   Defending women's champion Martina Hingis beat Aleksandra Olsza
of Poland 6-2, 6-0. The Swiss teen-ager, who won the Australian
Open in January but has struggled recently and hopes the Open will
end that.
	   ``I'm definitely not as confident as I was last year,'' Hingis
said. ``This is the last Grand Slam of the year and you put all
your energy into this tournament.''
	   Seles, a two-time Open champion and a quarterfinalist a year
ago, traded groundstrokes and errors with Labat before blitzing
through the tiebreak, then dominated the second set.
	   With her grunting subdued from her heyday _ and at times mixing
with the squeals of a child in the stands _ Seles did not allow a
point on her serve in the second set until she held triple match
point. Labat tied it 40-all before Seles wrapped up the victory
with a service winner and a lob that Labat netted.

	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australian rugby star Matthew Burke
will be out of action for up to seven months following his heroics
in Saturday's 19-14 test victory over New Zealand.
	   Burke severely dislocated his right shoulder when he dived
across for the winning try seven minutes from time to complete a
3-0 Bledisloe Cup sweep against the All Blacks.
	   The goalkicking fullback was told Tuesday he would require a
full shoulder reconstruction. Australian rugby spokesman Strath
Gordon said Burke was expected to be sidelined for up to seven
months.
	   Burke will have surgery in four weeks and will miss Australia's
World Cup qualifiers this month, the end of year tour to France and
Britain and the start of next year's Super 12 series.
