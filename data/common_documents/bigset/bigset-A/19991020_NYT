   Los Angeles, Oct. 20, 2024
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to believe 25 years have gone by since the Staples
Center opened, and it's harder to believe we thought it was so
high-tech back then.
</P>
<P>
   Seems like only yesterday the arena debuted with a Bruce
Springsteen concert (the Boss in the flesh, not a life-size
hologram, like the concerts these days) and a Kings ice hockey game
against the Boston Bruins (before the water conservationists forced
the development of ``virtual ice.'').
</P>
<P>
   I guess it was only a matter of time before luxury-box patrons
demanded a more up-to-date building in which they wouldn't be
forced to actually sit up to watch the games.
</P>
<P>
   So, now we look forward to the opening of a new building on the
former site of Los Angeles City Hall, which never did produce the
revenue a major sports arena can.
</P>
<P>
   This is a good time to look back at the high and low points in
the history of the dear old Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   Oct. 21, 1999: Arena officials announce they're closing the
arena for renovations after discovering it was accidentally built
with a sloping roof.
</P>
<P>
   Aug. 10, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2004, 2007, 2008, 2010, 2011, 2012,
2015, 2016, 2018, 2020, 2021 and 2023: The Clippers hold press
conferences to announce they've signed the NBA's No. 1 draft pick.
</P>
<P>
   April 2, 2004: The Dodgers move to the Staples Center for one
season while Dodger Stadium is being fitted with a dome. Although
the left-field fence is only 194 feet away, the team again fails to
produce a 50-home run hitter.
</P>
<P>
   May 6, 2006: George Foreman announces his retirement from boxing
after an eighth-round knockout loss to Laila Ali.
</P>
<P>
   Dec. 29, 2007: A maintenance crew sweeping a rarely used
stairwell discovers the frozen remains of a sportswriter who'd been
presumed lost in the arena catacombs since he wandered away from a
pre-opening tour in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   April 10, 2008: The Kings come back from a five-goal,
third-period deficit against the expansion Mexico City Iceberg to
win a playoff thriller to be remembered as the ``Miracle on
Figueroa'' until somebody thinks up a cooler name.
</P>
<P>
   Feb. 14, 2009: After a member of the working class breaches
security by getting off the elevator on the exclusive Suite Level
A, scores of luxury-box holders suffer scrapes and bruises in a
panicked stampede to the exits.
</P>
<P>
   July 8, 2012: The arena plays host to the Reform Party national
convention at which Danny Bonaduce is nominated for his successful
presidential run.
</P>
<P>
   Nov. 2, 2014: The Staples Center hosts the historic first game
of the new Coed NBA after a court bans separate men's and women's
pro leagues as unconstitutional. (Women's advocates continue to
challenge the ruling.)
</P>
<P>
   March 29, 2017: Arena workers go on strike midway through the
two-hour process of switching from a hockey rink to a basketball
floor. That night's basketball game is played anyway, and the
Lakers' defense improves with the adoption of the neutral-zone
trap.
</P>
<P>
   Nov. 1, 2020: Shaquille O'Neal Jr. makes his NBA debut. The
7-footer is soon hailed as a pretty good point guard for a little
guy.
</P>
<P>
   Nov. 20, 2022: The USC basketball team moves to the Staples
Center, having just moved out of the Sports Arena, which will be
leveled to make room for a parking structure if Los Angeles gets a
pro football team.
</P>
<P>
   Oct. 18, 2023: Bruce Springsteen, 74, brings his fans to their
feet _ the younger ones, anyway _ in the famous ``Old Blue Jeans is
Back'' concert. The Rolling Stones open.
</P>
<P>
   June 6, 2024: Kobe Bryant, introduced as the Lakers' new head
coach, promises fans will see more teamwork, ``like we had when
Shaq and I played.'' Preseason magazines pick Lakers to end their
NBA title drought at 36 years.
</P>
<P>
   Oct. 10, 2024: With banners, balloons and a blare of trumpets,
the Staples Center welcomes its 50 millionth fan. The man asks
directions to a restroom, explaining that he'd been idling in
Harbor Freeway traffic since opening night in 1999.

LOS ANGELES: life of the facility. 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The district is in a state of chaos, and I don't think it
would be safe or wise to rely on them,'' said Monosson, a former
public health officer with the state Division of Occupational
Safety and Health.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the recommendation, Reiner said the district
should convert its administrative headquarters back into a high
school. The facility, at 450 N. Grand Street, could hold about
2,000 students in Belmont's attendance area and virtually eliminate
the need to bus children, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes all the sense in the world,'' Reiner said.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Scott Wildman, D-Glendale, a member of the State
Allocation Board, vowed to lobby the state to fund up to 80 percent
of the renovation costs with modernization funds available in
Proposition 1A.
</P>
<P>
   Reiner said he discussed the modernization plan with the state
architect and about a dozen other state officials. He added that
the 1,500 administrators using the district's headquarters could be
easily relocated to office space in mid-Wilshire or elsewhere
downtown.
</P>
<P>
   There appeared to be unanimous support on the commission for the
plans.
</P>
<P>
   In a related development, LAUSD officials were scheduled Tuesday
to receive a comprehensive asset management study that identifies
district headquarters as a potential school site and the historic
downtown core as a possible administrative complex.
</P>
<P>
   The report by Gensler, a Los Angeles architectural firm and
three other companies, is intended to help LAUSD chart a new
facilities strategy after its dismal efforts with Belmont and
failure to build schools citywide, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither a Gensler official nor Mike DeLuca, the district's
deputy director of real estate and asset management, would comment.
</P>
<P>
   Sources told the Daily News the study includes options for
consolidating about 3,000 administrators from headquarters, a
leased downtown high-rise and smaller offices into a leased or
purchased facility of up to 700,000 square feet, possibly along
Spring Street.
</P>
<P>
   Board member David Tokofsky charged the plan was an effort by
downtown interests to push ahead with efforts begun several years
ago to create a vast government core downtown.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just the same machinations as before,'' Tokofsky said.
``This a patrician fantasy of a downtown zone. The district could
look to the San Fernando Valley, to the Wilshire area.''

BIG WEST MAKING CHANGES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Today's edition of The Sporting Muse, devoted to the notion of a
Big West without football:
</P>
<P>
   That sound you hear is the air leaking out of the Big West
football, and it's a pleasant sound to the Californians in the
conference.
</P>
<P>
   The Western Athletic Conference's (WAC) decision Monday to
invite Boise State, effective in the 2001-02 season, and Louisiana
Tech was a serious blow to the remaining football players in the
Big West. Boise State is host of the Humanitarian Bowl, and it will
take the bowl game with it when it joins the WAC.
</P>
<P>
   Boise State's departure, on the heels of Nevada leaving in
2000-01, will leave only four schools playing football in the
league (Idaho, Utah State, New Mexico State and North Texas) and
without an automatic bowl bid for any kind of league champ.
</P>
<P>
   That's a pretty big piece of football inventory to lose. The
number of bowls may continue to increase, but the opportunities are
all going to bigger and better football conferences. Plus, the NCAA
also requires a minimum of six schools for recognition as a
Division I-A conference.
</P>
<P>
   This keeps the momentum moving for the six California-based Big
West schools who want to turn the conference into an all-California
league sans football. So far, they haven't had do anything more
strenuous than stay focused and wave goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   ``The train remains on the track,'' said Long Beach State
Athletic Director Bill Shumard. ``We need to keep applying subtle
pressure for what we want.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   New Mexico State and North Texas could be the next two Big West
schools to leave. They applied for WAC membership, but the WAC,
which saw TCU defect to Conference USA last week, decided to limit
its expansion for now to 10 schools.
</P>
<P>
   They have also have expressed interest in joining the Sun Belt
Conference, which has an improving profile as a basketball
conference and is considering expanding into football.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Belt currently includes Arkansas-Little Rock, Arkansas
State, Florida International, Louisiana-Lafayette, Louisiana Tech,
New Orleans, South Alabama and Western Kentucky, though Tech,
currently a Division I-A football independent, is headed for the
WAC.
</P>
<P>
   Of those schools, only three play football. Arkansas St. is an
associate football member of the Big West, Lafayette is a Division
I-A independent, and Western Kentucky plays in the I-AA Ohio Valley
Conference. Several other Division I-A schools -- Central Florida,
Middle Tennessee State, Louisiana-Monroe -- would like to join the
Sun Belt, or at least work with it in arranging a football league.
</P>
<P>
   Idaho and Utah State are the odd men out in all of the
scenarios, neither big enough or close enough to warrant a look
from the WAC or any Sun Belt aggregation.
</P>
<P>
   At one time, Big West officials talked about an arrangement that
could have served everyone. It would have separated the conference
into California and mountain divisions and limited their
competition to championship play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a less-than-perfect solution,'' said Shumard. ``If
Boise State had remained, there might have been sentiment to try it
for a couple of years. But it doesn't make any sense now.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   Both Riverside and Northridge have expressed major interest in
joining an all-California Big West, but Sacramento State hasn't
come to a conclusion yet. The existing members are content with the
prospects of an eight-team league featuring Long Beach, Fullerton,
Irvine, UCSB, San Luis Obispo, Pacific, Riverside and Northridge.
</P>
<P>
   California schools have also finished studies on the potential
savings and concluded that an all-state league would save
$100,000-plus a season in travel costs.
</P>
<P>
   At schools like Long Beach, that money would be reinvested in
boosting the strength of non-conference schedules for all of the
key sports -- men's and women's basketball and volleyball and
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Shumard said both volleyball programs would like to add more
national rivals to their non-conference or tournament slates. Dave
Snow's baseball program already plays powers like Wichita State and
Miami, and would also like bring powers like Texas, Florida State
and LSU to Blair Field. ...
</P>
<P>
   The talk of an all-state league has already presented the Big
West an intriguing opportunity. Officials at the Anaheim Convention
Center, which seats about 7,500 for basketball, have contacted the
league office about hosting basketball and volleyball tournament
and championship events. ...
</P>
<P>
   The new WAC apparently is determined to make the same mistakes
which led to the breakup of the old WAC.
</P>
<P>
   When the WAC expanded to 16 schools, it created an unwieldy
league with contrasting goals and geographic chaos. It extended
from Hawaii to Tulsa and included a handful of Texans that had
little in common with the BYUs and other mountain schools. Eight of
those schools (Air Force, BYU, Colorado State, New Mexico, San
Diego State, UNLV, Utah and Wyoming) subsequently broke away and
created the Mountain West Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the latest deletions and additions, a 10-team WAC will
eventually include Hawaii, Boise State, Nevada, Fresno State, San
Jose State (west) and UTEP, SMU, Rice, Louisiana Tech and Tulsa
(south).
</P>
<P>
   If the WAC wants to be this disparate, it might as well take in
all of the Big West football teams and a few other stragglers and
build back up to 16 teams.
</P>
<P>
   The west would include Hawaii, Idaho, Boise State, Nevada,
Fresno State, San Jose State, New Mexico State and Utah State. The
south would feature Arkansas State, UTEP, SMU, Rice, North Texas,
Louisiana-Lafayette, Louisiana Tech and Tulsa.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it's congregations like these which make the
all-California idea seem so logical.

   Braves top Mets, win NLCS 10-9 in 11-inning nail-biter
</P>
<P>
   By Carroll Rogers
</P>
<P>
   Staff Writer
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Two can play this game. This
rip-your-heart-out-extra-inning kind. But only one can move along
to the World Series to face the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   And for that, the Braves fans are forever thankful. That and
completely wrung out after watching the Braves survive Game 6 and
the Mets with a 10-9 11th inning win that puts them back in their
fifth World Series of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves game plan for Wednesday night had called for patience
and it couldn't have been a better one. After waiting for six games
against the Mets and 11 innings on Tuesday night, Andruw Jones went
to the plate with the bases loaded and the game tied 10-10.
Historically one of the most impatient hitters in the Braves lineup
Jones watched a Kenny Rogers 3-2 pitch sail up and away to walk in
Gerald Williams from third base to send the Braves back to the
World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Williams had doubled to lead off the inning and moved to third
on back-to-back intentional walks to Chipper Jones and Brian
Jordan. Then came the walk that sends the Braves jumping for joy.
</P>
<P>
   The rematch of the 1996 Yankees comes at the expense of the
Mets, who proved to be the most resilient of any team in recent
memory that followed up their 4-3 15th inning win in New York by
pushing the Braves to the limit themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Well enough alone? If the Braves didn't have a trip to the World
Series all but locked up with a 3-0 lead Friday night in New York,
then they surely had it early in the evening on Tuesday night when
they were up by five runs in the first inning of Game 6.
</P>
<P>
   But the Mets made that Braves lead another in a long list of
disappearing deficits Tuesday night, clawing back to take a 9-8
lead after trailing 5-0, 7-3 and 8-7.
</P>
<P>
   But by the 10th the Braves had had enough. The Braves had been 1
for 30 against Armando Benitez this season, with nary a baserunner
on him until Eddie Perez singled in the 10th inning of Game 5. But
in the 10th inning of Game 6, they tied the game on him. Andruw
Jones led off the inning with a single to right and Ozzie Guillen
scored him an out and three batters later when he drove his 1-1
pitch past Edgardo Alfonzo and into right field to score Andruw
Jones and tie the game 9-9.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets took a place where they'd lost 13 of their previous 14
games and packed with an all-time high 52,335 fans and made it feel
like home, and invited themselves back for a Game 7 tonight.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves 3-0 lead has vanished in three losses to the Mets,
who have made a killing on winning against the most improbable
odds. They are a win away from making the Braves the first team in
major league baseball history to blow a 3-0 lead in a seven-game
series.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Glavine is the last man standing for the Braves, as he faces
Rick Reed tonight for the right to take on the Yankees in the World
Series.
</P>
<P>
   Benny Agbayani burned John Rocker with a leadoff walk in the top
of the 10th inning, should have been picked off attempting to steal
second base but took a Brian Hunter throw between the shoulder
blades instead. He then advanced to third on a Melvin Mora single
and slid home head first to score the winning run past a twisting
Greg Myers, who'd gone up the third base line to field a throw from
Andruw Jones on a Todd Pratt sacrifice fly to shallow center.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of sliding, if the Braves are to make it back to a
fifth World Series this decade, they're going to do it the hard way
after being beaten in extra innings for a second consecutive game.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves left the winning run at second base in both the
eighth and ninth innings with strikeouts by Howard Battle and then
Brian Jordan to face extra innings for the second consecutive game.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves 4-3 15-inning loss in New York on Sunday seem simple
to take.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets had erased Braves leads of 5-0 and 7-3 on two of their
toughest power-throwing pitchers Kevin Millwood and Smoltz, leaving
the Braves fresh out of ideas and the Mets leaning on their one
clear advantage over the Braves, their bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   But trailing 8-7, the Braves found an answer from the hottest
and coldest hitters on their team. Eddie Perez started it with a
single to left off John Franco for his 10th hit of the series,
highest for any hitter on either team. Then with Otis Nixon pinch
running for him, stealing second on a 3-2 pitch and taking third on
Mike Piazza's second throwing error of the game, Brian Hunter
singled to right center to tie the game 8-8.
</P>
<P>
   It had taken the Mets six innings to start cashing in
offensively, but once they started they wouldn't stop, first on
Millwood then on Smoltz. They got another chopper for a single by
John Olerud, another Edgardo Alfonzo double and more heroics from
Melvin Mora, who gave the Mets their first lead of the game 8-7
with a run-scoring single in the eighth inning off Mike Remlinger.
</P>
<P>
   After the Braves made a big inning pitcher out of the Mets big
game pitcher Al Leiter with five runs in the first inning, they
swallowed hard as Millwood gave three runs back in the sixth
inning. It would only get worse, as the Mets had an answer for
another Braves offensive surge in the sixth and a call to John
Smoltz out of the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza, who'd done little but taken a physically beating this
series, finally took a big swing back. With only the fourth hit of
his series, Piazza drove a bullet into the Braves and their right
center field bleachers with his line drive two-run home run off
Smoltz to complete a seven-run comeback tying the game 7-7.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves offense, which had scored only five earned runs in
its previous 33 innings of the series, matched that in the first
inning, chasing Leiter after he faced six batters without recording
an out.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter, pitching on three days' rest, hit Gerald Williams in the
foot, walked Bret Boone and gave up a run before he'd even thrown a
second pitch to Chipper Jones. Jones watched from the batter's box
as Williams and Boone took off on a double steal and Williams
scored on a drawing a wild throw to third from Piazza.
</P>
<P>
   When it was time to put a little wood into their efforts, the
Braves did that too with a two-strike run-scoring single from Brian
Jordan and a bases loaded two-run single from Eddie Perez.
</P>
<P>
   That ended Leiter's shortest outing since his rookie season in
1988.

fifth World Series this decade, they're going to do it the hard way
after being beaten in extra innings for a second consecutive game.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves left the winning run at second base in both the
eighth and ninth innings with strikeouts by Howard Battle and then
Brian Jordan to face extra innings for the second consecutive game.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves 4-3 15-inning loss in New York on Sunday seem simple
to take.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets had erased Braves leads of 5-0 and 7-3 on two of their
toughest power-throwing pitchers Kevin Millwood and Smoltz, leaving
the Braves fresh out of ideas and the Mets leaning on their one
clear advantage over the Braves, their bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   But trailing 8-7, the Braves found an answer from the hottest
and coldest hitters on their team. Eddie Perez started it with a
single to left off John Franco for his 10th hit of the series,
highest for any hitter on either team. Then with Otis Nixon pinch
running for him, stealing second on a 3-2 pitch and taking third on
Mike Piazza's second throwing error of the game, Brian Hunter
singled to right center to tie the game 8-8.
</P>
<P>
   It had taken the Mets six innings to start cashing in
offensively, but once they started they wouldn't stop, first on
Millwood then on Smoltz. They got another chopper for a single by
John Olerud, another Edgardo Alfonzo double and more heroics from
Melvin Mora, who gave the Mets their first lead of the game 8-7
with a run-scoring single in the eighth inning off Mike Remlinger.
</P>
<P>
   After the Braves made a big inning pitcher out of the Mets big
game pitcher Al Leiter with five runs in the first inning, they
swallowed hard as Millwood gave three runs back in the sixth
inning. It would only get worse, as the Mets had an answer for
another Braves offensive surge in the sixth and a call to John
Smoltz out of the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza, who'd done little but taken a physically beating this
series, finally took a big swing back. With only the fourth hit of
his series, Piazza drove a bullet into the Braves and their right
center field bleachers with his line drive two-run home run off
Smoltz to complete a seven-run comeback tying the game 7-7.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves offense, which had scored only five earned runs in
its previous 33 innings of the series, matched that in the first
inning, chasing Leiter after he faced six batters without recording
an out.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter, pitching on three days' rest, hit Gerald Williams in the
foot, walked Bret Boone and gave up a run before he'd even thrown a
second pitch to Chipper Jones. Jones watched from the batter's box
as Williams and Boone took off on a double steal and Williams
scored on a drawing a wild throw to third from Piazza.
</P>
<P>
   When it was time to put a little wood into their efforts, the
Braves did that too with a two-strike run-scoring single from Brian
Jordan and a bases loaded two-run single from Eddie Perez.
</P>
<P>
   That ended Leiter's shortest outing since his rookie season in
1988.

SPORTS COLUMN: FOR METS, A MONTH IS AN ETERNITY 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Mets' season, in survival mode for four weeks,
tumbled back to Atlanta on Tuesday night for Game 6 of a series _
and a rivalry _ that has taken on a life of its own. For the Mets,
this city has become a lament: Atlanta, Atlanta, the road leads
back to you.
</P>
<P>
   Four weeks ago to the day, the Mets barreled into town full of
heady pretensions and the fragile confidence of a team that was
having its first dreams of the top after a decade of mediocrity.
They had put distance between themselves and Cincinnati in the
National League wild-card race and had pulled within a game of the
Braves _ the foe they have chased so long in the East Division.
With three games at Turner Field, the Mets were certain of coming
out even with Atlanta at the very least.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Mets were humbled. They suffered three
confidence-draining losses that set the stage for one of the
wildest rides in franchise history. Disaster in Atlanta; three more
demoralizing losses to lowly Philadelphia, then two more defeats to
Atlanta at Shea.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the Mets had tumbled from the lofty quest of a
division championship to the desperation of a team trying to back
into a wild-card playoff. With their division dreams crushed to
pieces, the Mets put themselves back together with what was left.
The young players snapped out of a dream, the veterans faced up to
reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``The young guys had been living a dream,'' recalled Darryl
Hamilton, the Mets' center fielder, who joined the team in a
midseason trade. ``First couple years in the big leagues with the
chance to go to the playoffs _ something they hadn't done here in
11 years. The older guys were thinking, `Hey, I'm running out of
time. It's time to turn it up.' The whole team realized we were in
a special position and needed to take advantage of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The team grew, the team jelled, the team matured.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets swept a three-game series against Pittsburgh, then won
a wild-card playoff game against Cincinnati. They disposed of
favored Arizona, suffered three straight losses to Atlanta in the
Championship Series, then scored back-to-back victories, the second
in a 15-inning classic on Sunday. Hamilton reflected on the
mind-set of the team four weeks ago _ four weeks that seem like a
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we came here before, we were thinking, `Okay, we can
maybe get two out of three, maybe sweep these guys, then we're tied
up or ahead in the division. Then we can go on and take care of
business at home,''' Hamilton recalled. ``But when that snowballed
into a losing streak, guys realized that the only thing that was
important is the game you go out and play. One game at a time. Our
psyche has changed totally.''
</P>
<P>
   So the changed Mets came back to Atlanta. All those miles
traveled, the ups, the downs, the upheavals. All the steep inclines
and plummets.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the Mets were right back where they started four
weeks ago when they came here a game behind Atlanta. But in a much
larger sense, the Mets barely resemble the team that left Atlanta
humbled and off center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our attitude's a little different right now,'' Hamilton said.
``That losing streak was a very humbling experience. We realized
that, no matter how good your ball club is, usually the best team
doesn't win. We think we have a very good ball club but we lost a
lot of critical games at the end and it almost cost us a playoff
berth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys really appreciate where we are right now. We understand
that it can go away at any instant.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps for those reasons, there is a pronounced sense of time
and fragility among the Mets. Before Tuesday night's game, someone
asked Bobby Valentine about a Subway Series against the Yankees.
Valentine sighed, gave the patent quizzical expression, then mulled
a complex response to a simple question. He framed his answer in
the context of a team that has nearly come full circle in four
weeks, but still, possibly not far enough. ``We're close,'' he said
``but we're really far away from that right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Phillips, the Mets' general manager, said he looked at the
Mets' harrowing four-week journey _ from Georgia to Pennsylvania to
New York to Ohio to Arizona back to New York and now Georgia again
_ and believes it has built a resolve the Mets may not have had
four weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``If things had gone differently, we could have won the division
and gotten here the same way,'' Phillips said. ``But the way we've
gotten to this point is going to be so much more fulfilling when
it's all said and done because we overcame something and a label
can never be attached to us again. We didn't choke. We didn't fold.
We won.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips paused and smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had destiny in our own hands, we lost destiny, we got it
back in our own hands,'' he said. ``We won to get ourselves where
we are today.''

   ATLANTA _ A team's momentum, Mets Manager Bobby Valentine
believes, is only as strong as its starting pitcher. Valentine may
have underestimated his team's resiliency, but Wednesday morning,
in Game 6 of the National League Championship Series, the momentum,
the magic and the moxie that carried the Mets on their exhilarating
rampage through the post-season finally ran out.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets' magical month ended when the Atlanta Braves pushed
across a run in the 11th inning at Turner Field to win, 10-9, to
capture the National League pennant in six games.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta, which will be host to the Yankees in Game 1 of the
World Series on Saturday night in a rematch of 1996 Series, blew
5-0 and 7-3 leads, fell behind by a run, tied the game, fell behind
in overtime, tied it again, and then finally ended matters, as well
as the Mets' seesaw season.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Williams carried across the winning run for Atlanta,
after opening the Braves' 11th with a double to left off Kenny
Rogers. A sacrifice and two walks set up a bases-loaded, one-out
situation for Andruw Jones, who walked on a 3-2 pitch to win the
pennant for Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Down by three games to none to the Braves last Saturday and by
5-0 after one inning on Tuesday night, the Mets rallied in their
distinctively improbable fashion and the teams went into extra
innings for the second straight game. No team has ever come back
from 3-0 hole in the post-season to even earn a 3-3 tie.
</P>
<P>
   But the Mets came close.
</P>
<P>
   In their 10th, a walk to Benny Agabayani, a botched pickoff by
John Rocker, a single by Melvin Mora and a sacrifice fly by Todd
Pratt fetched the run that broke an 8-8 tie.
</P>
<P>
   But the Braves, who won a major league-leading 103 games this
season, came back in the bottom of the 10th off Mets' closer
Armando Benitez. A single, a walk and a one-out single to right by
Ozzie Guillen got home the tying run for Atlanta. A nifty throw
from Mora in right that cut down Ryan Klesko at third base
prevented a bigger rally, but, as things turned out, only prolonged
the inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   The extra-inning drama came long after Al Leiter had one of the
worst outings of his career. The Mets' starter was charged with
five first-inning runs in a 25-pitch outing.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter's shabby outing on three days of rest put the Mets into
an early hole. Whether he was overly charged up or simply so out of
gas that no amount of mental fuel could make up the difference,
Leiter had no command of his pitches, sending them swerving in all
directions. Piazza looked like an aerobics instructor, stretching
up and down and side to side to retrieve Leiter's offerings. The
left-hander bounced his second pitch of the game in the dirt and on
his third pitch he hit the Braves' leadoff hitter, Gerald Williams,
in the foot.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter walked the next batter, Bret Boone. Six of Leiter's first
eight pitches were balls. On his first pitch to the dangerous
Chipper Jones _ another ball _ the Braves executed a double steal,
sending Williams scurrying to third. When Piazza gunned the ball to
third, it bounced off Robin Ventura and skittered toward the Mets
dugout, scoring Williams for the first run of the game as Boone
advanced to third.
</P>
<P>
   On the next pitch _ Leiter's 10th _ he hit Jones near the knee,
putting runners on first and third. Brian Jordan, the fourth batter
in the lineup, sent a grounder into the gap between third and
shortstop to score Boone and to give the Braves a 2-0 lead with,
still, none out.
</P>
<P>
   Andruw Jones, on a 1-1 pitch, hit a comebacker to the mound.
Leiter fielded the ball, but, after a moment's hesitation, he threw
sidearm to second base. The throw pulled Edgardo Alfonzo off the
bag and the bases were loaded for Eddie Perez, whose home runs in
Games 1 and 2 had helped put the Mets into their hole.
</P>
<P>
   Perez fouled off four pitches with the count 1-2 and finally
smacked a single into left field to score Jones and Jordan, giving
the Braves a 4-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   After 25 pitches, Leiter was gone and his slow walk to the
dugout, head hanging, was a study in distress. As he reached for
his jacket, he rubbed his head with his hands but he would watch as
reliever Pat Mahomes gave up a sacrifice fly to Brian Hunter to
lengthen the lead to 5-0.
</P>
<P>
   And the Mets essentially shrugged and said, ``Got your back.''
</P>
<P>
   With Mahomes and Turk Wendell holding the Braves scoreless, and
the Braves' starter, Kevin Millwood, who was pitching on extra
rest, tiring, the Mets scored three runs in the sixth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Alfonzo led off with a double and moved to third on John
Olerud's single. Piazza's sacrifice fly scored Alfonzo for the
Mets' first run. Ventura, whose grand slam single won the marathon
Sunday night, doubled to put two runners in scoring position and
both scored on Darryl Hamilton's single up the middle.
</P>
<P>
   With his lead down to 5-3, Atlanta Manager Bobby Cox replaced
Millwood with Terry Mulholland, who promptly walked pinch-hitter
Benny Agbayani to extend the rally. But Rey Ordonez, who has failed
to bunt successfully in several key situations during this series,
lined out to shortstop Walt Weiss, who stepped on second base for
the inning-ending double play.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves added two runs in the bottom of the sixth on
pinch-hitter Jose Hernandez's bases-loaded single and that should
have finished the Mets off. Good luck with that.
</P>
<P>
   With John Smoltz, who had saved Game 2 for Millwood, entering
for the seventh, the Mets did the unthinkable. Pinch-hitter Matt
Franco doubled to center field to lead off and he scored on Rickey
Henderson's double down the left-field line. Then, Alfonzo backed
Jordan against the right-field wall with his flyout that moved
Henderson to third.
</P>
<P>
   Olerud followed with a single that scored Henderson and then
Piazza, who joked before the game that his left arm was so banged
up he should seek a donor, used that arm to slug a 2-1 pitch over
the right-center-field wall to tie the score, 7-7.
</P>
<P>
   Orel Hershiser, who also pitched Sunday, came on to shut the
Braves down in the seventh, and the Mets faced Mike Remlinger in
the eighth. Agbayani rapped a leadoff single to right and Ordonez
finally sacrificed successfully, moving Agbayani to second.
</P>
<P>
   That brought up Melvin Mora, the Wunderkind who has been
involved in some of the Mets' most important plays of the last four
weeks. He singled to score Agbayani and to give the Mets their
first lead of the game, 8-7.
</P>
<P>
   But the scrambling Mets could not push another run across in the
eighth, and when the Braves scored off John Franco in the bottom of
the eighth, the score was tied, 8-8.

CONFLICTING INTERESTS FOR MLS DEPUTY GULATI?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Former Major League Soccer deputy commissioner Sunil Gulati is
back, but not everyone is happy about it.
</P>
<P>
   Gulati, who left MLS last year to pursue other soccer-related
endeavors, had been hired as the managing director for Kraft
Soccer. Robert Kraft, whose MLS financial stake includes the New
England Revolution and San Jose Clash, pursued Gulati because of
his experience and strong ties to MLS and world-wide soccer.
</P>
<P>
   But Gulati's hiring has been criticized, especially by Galaxy
coach Sigi Schmid.
</P>
<P>
   Gulati, 39, helped launch the league in 1996. He was responsible
for negotiating player contracts, as well as acquiring and
assigning foreign talent.
</P>
<P>
   He left MLS last year to become the managing director of Project
2010. He also served on the committees for FIFA and CONCACAF and
the board of director of U.S. Soccer. He is still active in those
posts.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Gulati is basically the general manager for New England and
San Jose _ which, in itself, is a conflict of interest. But his
close ties to the league, especially to Ivan Gazidis, vice
president in charge of player-related issues, leaves coaches such
as Schmid wondering how they can play on a level field.
</P>
<P>
   D.C. United president and general manager Kevin Payne also
serves on the board of directors for U.S. Soccer and is a member on
the MLS board of governors. His influence has helped strengthen
United, which has the most talent in the league and owns two MLS
cup titles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Sunil is a tremendous soccer person and he's very
passionate about the game,'' Schmid said. ``He also gives the teams
in New England and San Jose a tremendous advantage because he's
privy to information that everybody eventually gets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of like Kevin Payne at D.C. United. Sunil and Kevin
get the information a week ahead of everybody else. They're privy
to both sides of the equation. They're privy to the MLS equation
because they sit on the board of directors and they sit on the
board of directors for U.S. Soccer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, you have three teams in the league that will know a week
earlier than everyone else what's going on. That puts the rest of
us at a disadvantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Gulati doesn't think he has any advantage. He's taking over two
teams that failed to make the MLS playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is playing by the same rules,'' Gulati said. ``No one
is going to get a Ronaldo, and the teams have a lot to say in the
sort of players they want to get. It has been increasingly true
since year one that we will stand and fall on the decisions we
make.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Schmid would like to see both Gulati and Payne abandon
some of their influence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying Kevin or Sunil is out to get anyone,'' Schmid
said. ``But are there other people out there in U.S. Soccer's inner
circle? Is there another person in U.S. Soccer who can do what they
do? That's something we have to look at in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Strike one: Galaxy striker Carlos Hermosillo is in the final
year of a two-year contract with MLS.
</P>
<P>
   The 35-year-old Mexican standout has a big decision. Does he
return to Mexico, where he is 34 goals shy of becoming the
country's career-scoring leader, and leave the MLS behind? Or does
he re-sign with MLS because his wife and children enjoy their
privacy in La Canada Flintridge and are happy with its school
system?
</P>
<P>
   He has another choice _ to continue playing year-round. But then
his body is subject to a beating.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot to consider,'' Hermosillo said recently. ``The 34
goals needed in Mexico is something to think about. But I like
playing here as well.''
</P>
<P>
   People close to Hermosillo expect him to stay.
</P>
<P>
   __ Matthaeus dilemma: Schmid addressed the fact that German
standout Lothar Matthaeus joined New York/New Jersey, the worst
team in the MLS despite the coaching of Bora Milutinovic.
</P>
<P>
   Milutinovic, the only coach to lead four nations into the second
round of the World Cup (including the U.S. in 1994), couldn't turn
around the MetroStars' fortunes. Schmid doesn't think Matthaeus,
who signed for next season, can keep quiet if New York's struggles
continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Germans are not very good losers,'' said Schmid, who was
born in Germany. ``They tend to open their mouth and they,
sometimes, say things without thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``And Lohar is probably the closest thing Germany had since
Beckenbauer in terms of being able to speak his mind. He can say
things and it doesn't matter what the coach says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember Germany in 1974, when Germany lost to East Germany.
Beckenbauer went on TV and said this guy should go on the bench and
this guy should be starting. The next game that was the lineup and
Germany went on to win the World Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   Schmid is hoping Matthaeus arrives with some patience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would he consciously work to undermine Bora? I don't think
so,'' Schmid said. ``But he'll say things. If they don't win, there
will definitely be some friction.''

EISENHOWER'S NAME PINNED FOR NATIONAL RECOGNITION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID GOLDSTEIN  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Dwight D. Eisenhower was a 39-year-old major in the
U.S. Army in 1929 when his upward mobility catapulted him into an
office in the old State, War and Navy Building next to the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   He was assistant to the assistant secretary of war, proving that
Washington's penchant for bureaucracy started long ago. A few years
later, he moved down the hall with another title, assistant to the
War Department's chief of staff, then Gen. Douglas MacArthur.
</P>
<P>
   But now, 30 years after his death, Eisenhower, might go about as
high as you can go in that old edifice, and with the biggest title
of all: The building might be named for him.
</P>
<P>
   The name of the 34th president and hero of World War II who was
raised in Abilene, Kan., might soon be emblazoned on the building
itself. The Senate on Tuesday agreed to rename what is now called
the Old Executive Office Building for Eisenhower. Republican Sen.
John Chafee of Rhode Island sponsored the measure, which had
bipartisan support.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is long overdue,'' said Douglas Brinkley, a
presidential scholar and director of the Eisenhower Center at the
University of New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Washington D.C., the city of memorials to presidents, there
virtually is nothing to honor the supreme commander of the Allied
forces and former two-term president considered by most people to
be one of the great figures of the 20th century. It's really a
wonderful tribute.''
</P>
<P>
   And there is some poetry in the politics, too. While it struck
some as strange to rename Washington's airport for President
Reagan, the scourge of the air traffic controller's union,
Eisenhower, as president, saved his future namesake from demolition
in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   The building, a mammoth structure of granite, marble and cast
iron, was the world's largest office building when it was completed
in 1888 after 17 years of construction. Now on the National
Register of Historic Places, it is one of the most flamboyant
buildings in the capital and a window onto another era, with
pillars, skylight domes, gaslight chandeliers, spiral staircases
and two stained glass rotundas.
</P>
<P>
   An ``architectural infant asylum,'' wryly observed Henry Adams,
one of Washington's earliest commentators.
</P>
<P>
   Seven presidents have had their offices there before becoming
president, along with numerous secretaries of war, state and the
navy. But each of those Cabinet offices eventually sought quarters
elsewhere, and by the late 1940s, the building had become an
extension of its neighbor to the east, the White House, and was
renamed the Executive Office Building.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Holt, director of the Dwight D. Eisenhower Library &AMP; Museum
in Abilene, Kan., said he didn't think titles and honorifics ever
impressed the late president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he was a little reserved about those kind of things,
but I would think that he'd be proud to know about this,
particularly given the history of the building. He'd be pleased
about that.''

LEGISLATORS DECRY AGRICULTURAL SANCTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
 SANCTIONS-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID GOLDSTEIN  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A bipartisan group of legislators vowed Tuesday to
push harder on the contentious issue of lifting agricultural
sanctions, calling them a ``thoughtless'' and ``absurd'' weapon in
foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Republican Sens. John Ashcroft of Missouri and Chuck
Hagel of Nebraska, the group told a press conference that the trade
embargo on food and medicine currently in place against six nations
is only hurting American farmers, consumers and poor people across
the globe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tear down this wall which keeps our farmers from being able to
sell food to hungry individuals around the world,'' Ashcroft said.
</P>
<P>
   The sanctions are against Cuba, Libya, North Korea, Iran, Iraq
and Sudan. Democratic Sen. Byron Dorgan of North Dakota said that
neither Cuban leader Fidel Castro nor Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi
``ever missed a meal because of a U.S. trade embargo. The only
people hurt by food and medicine embargoes are poor people in those
countries.''
</P>
<P>
   On top of their humanitarian concerns, the legislators said the
sanctions have cost the United States millions of dollars in sales
and opened up those markets to other countries.
</P>
<P>
   Those six countries collectively imported $7.2 billion worth of
agricultural products from other countries in 1997, according to
Congressional Research Service. The National Association of Wheat
Growers reported that they imported almost 3.4 million metric tons
of wheat in 1997-98 from outside the United States, a loss to the
domestic economy that the group estimated at $560 million.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas, a top wheat producer, would stand to gain from the
lifting of sanctions, as would Missouri, a major corn and soybean
supplier. Missouri could be losing $7.8 million in soybean sales
alone, some estimate.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over the embargo crystallized last month when
Congress passed an emergency aid bill for farmers without the
Ashcroft-Hagel ban on food and medicine sanctions. The Senate
passed the ban in July by a 70-28 vote, and a majority of Senate
and House members fashioning the final agricultural bill favored
its inclusion.
</P>
<P>
   But it never made it because of concerns from the Republican
leadership that dropping the embargo against Cuba might offend
Cuban-American voters. At the time, Hagel called his party
leadership actions ``complete nonsense'' and ``buffoonery.''
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft said Tuesday that the White House's chief trade
negotiator, Charlene Barshefsky, has urged him and his colleagues
to push the issue.

HOLY ... COW! ANOTHER TV TABOO FALLS 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Standards erode, customs change, and the next thing you know,
you're watching ``Chicago Hope'' and Mark Harmon is saying . . .
well, I can't tell you exactly what he said because the newspaper's
standards and customs haven't changed enough to allow it.
</P>
<P>
   Shh. Add that sound before the first word of the first sentence
of this story, read the sentence aloud, and you'll re-create the
line of dialogue Harmon uttered near the end of a particularly
frustrating day.
</P>
<P>
   Realistic? Doubtless. Offensive? One might assume so, but only a
handful of people contacted Channel 5, the local CBS affiliate, to
complain. Of course, the low number doubtless has to do with the
show's lack of popularity; so few people watch ``Chicago Hope''
anymore that CBS could offer free flights to anywhere during
commercial breaks and never have to worry about getting anyone to
the airport.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, if you read lips even poorly, you can make out that
word and worse coming from athletes' mouths during just about any
major sporting event.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if you didn't see it coming, hearing the word on a
network television show was a shock.
</P>
<P>
   But not to Nan Anders.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Anders sent me an e-mail complaining about
the word ``ass'' popping up all over television.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all thought it was pretty funny that they would stoop to
fifth-grade-level words to try to get to the adult market,'' she
wrote. ``We actually started keeping score for a while.'' When Ray
Romano uttered the word ``ass'' on ``Everybody Loves Raymond,''
Anders figured it was open season, that any show could and would
use it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you have any input on what the new `adult' word will be and
when it will be introduced?'' she continued. ``We're betting on
(see above).''
</P>
<P>
   Never, I assured her. Won't happen. Networks simply won't allow
that word on TV.
</P>
<P>
   And they didn't. Until last Thursday. So how did she pick that
word? How did Anders know?
</P>
<P>
   ``Just about everything else had been used up,'' she said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, Anders wanted to engage in a little I-told-you-so
gloating, but she kept things friendly. She's 65 and lives in Sun
City. But if you think she's a cranky prude who sits around
watching television and gathering fodder for things to complain
about, you're way off.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's my pet word,'' she said of Harmon's utterance. ``But I
don't want to hear it on television.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not that the use of the word offended her exactly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really, honestly didn't bother me,'' Anders said. ``I
thought it was a little gratuitous. But it just kind of blew by. If
you really weren't listening, you wouldn't have heard it.''
</P>
<P>
   That, she explained, is the real problem _ that use of
questionable language has become so commonplace that it is
``desensitizing people to where it becomes just everyday
language.''
</P>
<P>
   And ``that'' offends her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know everybody talks like that, but that doesn't mean they
should,'' Anders said. ``You should have standards. . . .
(Television) shouldn't be a reflection of life. I think it should
lead the way. I think it should teach you what can be.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a mighty lofty goal for TV, which feeds off the lowest
common denominator to attract viewers. ``Popular'' is half the
equation of popular culture, after all. Network people said all the
right things about how this wasn't going to become a regular
occurrence, how it is an isolated incident and so forth.
</P>
<P>
   But come on. No one believes that, does he? Once the damn dam is
broken, other words follow. It's becoming increasingly clear that
if you're easily offended by off-color language, your best bet is
not to watch shows that are likely to use it. And that is an
option, something people tend to forget when they're complaining
about television's standards. You can always (gasp) read a book.
This isn't to say that's how things should be, simply that that's
how things are.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, will language on network television get worse? Can
it? Let's go to the expert for her analysis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're only a year or two away from the f-word,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I'm skeptical. But when it comes to disagreeing with
Anders on points like this, I've been wrong before. &QL;

LAWMAKERS PONDER POSSIBLE REMOVAL OF ACCREDITATION FROM KC, ST.
LOUIS SCHOOLS 
</HEADLINE>
 SCHOOLS-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIT WAGAR  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A mixture of sadness, chagrin and contempt emerged this week
after Missouri lawmakers learned that Kansas City and St. Louis
schools might be stripped of their state accreditation.
</P>
<P>
   But no one who has grappled with the districts' problems in the
last decade seemed surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the mood is one of resignation,'' said Democratic Rep.
Steve McLuckie of Kansas City. ``But everyone asks the question:
Isn't there something we can do?''
</P>
<P>
   That sentiment, lawmakers said, is likely to spark proposals for
dramatic change, including policies that until recently have been
dismissed as examples of right-wing extremism. They expect new
support for state-paid vouchers that students could use to pay for
private schools, tax deductions for private-school tuition, and
laws that would allow students to attend any public school they
chose.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers also will consider ways to encourage private
organizations to operate troubled schools and to force urban
districts to delegate more decision-making to individual schools.
</P>
<P>
   Several officials are even talking about breaking the Kansas
City and St. Louis school districts into smaller districts to
reduce bureaucracy and encourage parent involvement.
</P>
<P>
   Those ideas are being tossed around in the wake of state
Education Commissioner Robert Bartman's recommendation to withdraw
accreditation from the state's two largest school districts.
</P>
<P>
   A recent state review found that the Kansas City district failed
to meet any of the 11 standards regarding student performance,
including scores on standardized tests and college entrance exams,
reading ability and dropout rates. The St. Louis district met only
three of the standards.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers across the political spectrum agree that those results
are unacceptable, particularly after more than $3.5 billion in
court-ordered spending to upgrade and desegregate the districts.
</P>
<P>
   That experience has convinced lawmakers that greater funding
will not solve the problems. It also has chafed outstate
legislators who believe that their schools have suffered so that
money could be poured into big-city schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will absolutely not spend more money on those districts,''
said Rep. Delbert Scott of Lowry City, the Republican House leader.
``It's been a total waste. The social experiment has failed. Rural
districts have been robbed for so many years, and look what we have
to show for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Many lawmakers are looking for alternatives that will give
students a way out of poorly performing schools.
</P>
<P>
   But solutions for individual students often create bigger
problems for those who remain, lawmakers said. And some proposals
invite fights with teachers unions, suburban schools or
public-school advocates, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Marsha Campbell, a Kansas City Democrat who championed the
creation of charter schools in 1998, predicted a renewed effort to
allow students to use state vouchers to pay for private school. The
idea has been popular in suburban areas for years but opposed by
urban lawmakers, who argue that it would weaken public schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``If urban legislators begin to say, `Maybe this is a way out
for our children to get a decent education,''' then prospects for
such legislation brighten considerably, Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
   The success of charter schools _ which are publicly funded but
operate independently of the district _ shows the strong demand for
public education, she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Campbell and others argue that vouchers undercut public
schools by draining off the most active families.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to educate the masses,'' said Democratic Rep. Bill
Skaggs of Kansas City. ``What about kids whose parents' only
involvement is to say, `Go to school'? And some parents don't even
do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican Sen. Bill Kenney of Lee's Summit said vouchers were a
difficult battle because teachers' unions saw them as a threat.
</P>
<P>
   He said he preferred a system of state scholarships that would
provide $2,500 to $3,000 a year that low-income students could use
to attend private schools. The remainder of the tuition could be
paid through a foundation funded with corporate and other
donations.
</P>
<P>
   The scholarships amount to about half of the amount of per-pupil
funding for public schools. Their advocates might go along if the
public schools were allowed to keep the other half, thereby
increasing their average per-pupil funding.
</P>
<P>
   McLuckie said he expected proposals to allow students to go to
any public school. But that would not help students who lacked
transportation to outlying schools, he said.
</P>
<P>
   And suburban lawmakers said they would oppose any plan that
would involve busing students to the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Against that backdrop, several lawmakers urged that the
legislature move cautiously. House Speaker Steve Gaw said he was
considering appointing a committee to gather information on the
ramifications of urban districts' loss of accreditation and the
potential impact on nearby suburban districts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We shouldn't put our heads in the sand, but we also shouldn't
rush in without knowing the implications,'' Gaw said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Carson Ross, a Blue Springs Republican, said new
legislation was premature when lawmakers did not even know the
effect of laws enacted last year. He said he was encouraged by the
early performance of Kansas City's new superintendent, Benjamin
Demps Jr., and the competition for students that charter schools
had created.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you make changes every time someone coughs, you never get
anything done,'' Ross said. ``We don't need to tamper with what we
have in place right now.''

NO TOPPER FOR THIS EPIC SERIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Turn off the television Wednesday night. There will be
nothing worth watching. There may never be anything quite as
compelling as what transpired in recent evenings.
</P>
<P>
   Those two battered teams, the Braves and the Mets, will not
conduct a historic seventh game. They have given enough. They
played three of the most physically grueling and emotionally
draining post-season games that baseball has ever seen,
particularly in sequence. Ten innings. Fifteen innings. Eleven
innings. But now it is over.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets will not come all the way back from the edge of three
straight losses. They scared the Braves, but ultimately lost, 10-9,
in the 11th inning at 12:38 Wednesday morning. There will be no
shot at four straight, but the Mets and Braves will always be
remembered for these three games, the late innings, the scrambled
scorecards, the pitchers working out of turn, in autumnal
desperation.
</P>
<P>
   Like cars parked on a New York street, the Mets and Braves have
their nicks and dings from a grueling post-season now two weeks
long. But the two gallant teams chugged out into heavy traffic
Wednesday night, producing yet another classic game of chicken in
the fast lane.
</P>
<P>
   It finally ended after Gerald Williams, a former Yankee, doubled
to lead off the 11th against Kenny Rogers, normally a starting
pitcher, but nothing has been normal for many, many days. A
sacrifice moved Williams to third. Two intentional walks loaded the
bases. And Jones, from Curacao, took a 3-2 pitch for the walk that
ended this series for the ages.
</P>
<P>
   It will be noted in New York that John Rocker, who took on the
yowling mob in Shea Stadium over the last hectic weekend, and who
walked away from an automobile wreck Monday afternoon in Atlanta,
now gets to pitch in a World Series against the Yankees. If he
doesn't like the vile maledictions in Flushing, Rocker should bring
his ear plugs to Yankee Stadium, where the Bleacher Creatures lurk.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Mets head for a well-earned winter tuneup. Nobody
needs it more than Mike Piazza, the most serially injured player of
all, who hit a game-tying homer Wednesday night but had to come out
in the ninth, just too beaten up to continue.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza took one more tumble Wednesday night when he was upended
by Brian Jordan, whose wide slide would have earned him 15 yards
for unnecessary roughness in his National Football League days.
Jordan, unhappy with being hit on the hand by Turk Wendell, who was
surely pitching him inside, exacted his revenge on the ankles of
Piazza, who was six inches up the baseline from home plate after
stepping on home plate for a force with no chance to throw the
runner out at first. There was a bit of bristling by both teams,
but no repercussions.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza has taken so much incoming fire in recent weeks that he
finally had to come out after 13 innings in Sunday night's epic
game, two innings before the Mets stunned the Braves for a second
straight game in rather dramatic fashion. Twenty-four hours of
lounging around the hotel bought Piazza some time, but he could
still feel his strained left forearm, plus every collision, every
whack, every foul tip, every tumble he has endured in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's a hit out on me,'' Piazza said, without
total confidence.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves showed compassion when they clobbered him at home
plate, but they still stole five bases on him Wednesday night,
trying to insure that the Mets did not do anything truly historic
to them.
</P>
<P>
   The big catcher is dragging after two rounds of _ remember,
Major League Baseball hates this word _ playoffs. It sounds so much
like one of those tacky winter sports. Baseball is infatuated with
this cash cow, the three-tiered post-season, and if it happens to
chew up the most vulnerable talent, pitchers like Randy Johnson and
David Cone and catchers like Piazza, well, the ledger book tells
the owners it was all worth it _ for them, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Yet baseball keeps coming up with these classic games, late in
these post-season series. The Mariners' comeback over the Yankees
in the division series in 1995. The Yankees' comeback over the
Braves in the 1996 World Series. The very fact of the Florida
Marlins in 1997. And even El Duque, Orlando Hernandez, saving the
Yankees in the championship series last year.
</P>
<P>
   For all these heroics, no team has ever come from three games
down to tie a post-season series. The Mets and their bruised
catcher came close to history. They had a magnificent run, but they
now go up on the blocks, resting their weary frames. Their season
is over.  &QL;

JANUS FUND MANAGER IS APPOINTED JANUS CAPITAL'S RESEARCH DIRECTOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RANDOLPH HEASTER  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jim Craig, portfolio manager of Janus Capital Corp.'s flagship
mutual fund, will relinquish his daily duties to become the fund
company's director of research.
</P>
<P>
   Craig, 43, will remain Janus' chief investment officer, but he
no longer will manage the $31 billion Janus Fund. Craig became
manager of the fund in 1987, when its assets totaled $377 million.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Bailey, Janus' chief executive officer, said Craig's
focus would be to strengthen the investment management team by
recruiting, training and mentoring analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Blaine Rollins will replace Craig as the Janus Fund's manager in
January. Rollins, 32, has been Craig's assistant on the fund.
</P>
<P>
   Rollins also has been portfolio manager of the Janus Balanced
and Janus Equity Income funds. Succeeding Rollins as manager of
those funds will be Karen Reidy, 32.
</P>
<P>
   Jane Ingalls, a Janus spokeswoman, said the change in Craig's
role had been planned for a couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim's single-minded dedication to developing our investment
management team will ensure that we continue our tradition of great
stock-picking,'' Bailey said. ``With Jim in this role, every Janus
shareholder will benefit directly from his influence, not just
shareholders of the portfolios he manages.''
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City Southern Industries Inc. is the parent company of
Janus. Its top officer applauded Janus' move.
</P>
<P>
   Landon H. Rowland, Kansas City Southern's chairman and chief
executive officer, said Janus' continued growth had led to the need
for an overseer of all its mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim Craig has the capacity and the record to carry on the
progress that Janus has made,'' Rowland said. ``We're extremely
pleased with this announcement. It's a sign of Janus' continued
growth in its organizational management structure as its assets
grow.''
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City Southern plans to spin off Janus and several other
financial service companies into a separate, publicly traded
entity. Included in the new company, Stilwell Financial Inc., will
be Berger Associates Inc. and Nelson Money Managers PLC.
</P>
<P>
   Some Janus principals in recent months have proposed that Janus
be spun off individually, without being attached to Kansas City
Southern's other financial service firms. Kansas City Southern has
rejected that idea.
</P>
<P>
   Craig said Tuesday that his move was unrelated to the tussle
between Janus and Kansas City Southern, calling it ``a sideshow.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig said his appointment was driven by organizational changes
at Janus, which now has 21 research analysts. His goal, he said,
``is to increase the flow of ideas of portfolio managers.''
</P>
<P>
   Denver-based Janus is the country's fastest-growing mutual fund
company, managing about $170 billion in assets for more than 2.5
million investors.

AFTER MANY RALLIES AND 11 INNINGS, METS RUN OUT OF MAGIC
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Subway Series will not take the IRT to Queens. It
will ride Marta in Atlanta instead.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets, as remarkable a team as has ever played a post-season
baseball game, ran out of incredulous comebacks early Wednesday
morning, dropping an 11-inning, 10-9 decision to the Braves in Game
6 of the National League Championship Series. Playing perhaps even
more magically than their 1969 ancestors in the past three weeks,
the Mets overcame deficits of 5-0 and 7-3, snatched 8-7 and 9-8
leads of their own and finally succumbed when Kenny Rogers threw a
bases-loaded 3-2 pitch high and outside to Andruw Jones, forcing
home Gerald Williams, who had started the inning with a double.
</P>
<P>
   In the space of four playoff games this month, Bobby Cox, the
Braves' manager, used two of his four starting pitchers in relief.
Kevin Millwood, who had pitched a one-hitter in the second game of
the division series against Houston, secured a 5-3 victory in Game
3 by pitching the 12th inning. In the second game of the NLCS
against the Mets, Smoltz made the first relief appearance of his
career and preserved a 4-3 victory with his ninth-inning effort.
</P>
<P>
   Cox resisted the temptation to use Millwood in relief in the
15th inning of Sunday's Game 5 in New York, and the Mets rallied
for two runs and a 4-3 victory. But Cox called on Smoltz in the
seventh inning Tuesday night, and he did not fare as well in the
second relief appearance of his career as he did in the first. The
Mets, continuing to display the most remarkable resiliency in their
history, battered Smoltz for four runs in the space of five batters
and overcame their second large deficit of the game.
</P>
<P>
   The day before this game, Millwood had expressed a view that so
many players on teams with a 3-2 series lead have uttered. ``We
definitely don't want it to go to a seventh game,'' the pitcher
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves, who had the look of a loser after Game 5, wasted no
time trying to make sure a seventh game would be out of the
question. They scored five runs and knocked Al Leiter out after he
had pitched to only six batters and thrown 25 pitches. Pitching on
three days' rest, an unnatural act for him, Leiter hit two of the
batters, walked another and gave up run-scoring singles to two
others.
</P>
<P>
   Cox had not used Millwood in relief Sunday because, he explained
yet again before Game 6, ``our club was not in desperation,''
``there's no guarantee he's going to lock it up on a rain-slickened
mound'' and ``he still had a game to pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   This was that game, and Millwood made Cox look brilliant _ for
five innings. He maintained his 5-0 advantage easily, holding the
Mets to four harmless hits. But these Mets could be contained for
only so long. They came out scorching in the sixth inning, erupting
for three runs, the last two scoring on Darryl Hamilton's third
single, which also knocked Millwood out of the game.
</P>
<P>
   If the Mets had wanted to make this comeback easy, they would
have held the Braves scoreless in their half of the sixth. But Turk
Wendell allowed the Braves to load the bases, and Dennis Cook gave
up a two-run pinch-hit single to Jose Hernandez. The hit gave the
Braves a four-run lead, but the Mets had already overcome a
five-run deficit, so obliterating that four-run Atlanta advantage
should not have been difficult.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't. Smoltz came in to start the seventh. Cox used him
there because he didn't have another game to pitch, not in this
series; the mound wasn't wet and the Braves, well, maybe a trace of
desperation was creeping in.
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz had started Game 4, allowing only two runs in seven and a
third innings. But that was the game the Mets used to begin their
comeback, scoring two runs in the eighth inning for a 3-2 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Franco, the Mets' pinch-hitter deluxe, was the first batter
Smoltz would face. Twice before in the series, Bobby Valentine, the
Mets' manager, had sent the left-hand-hitting Franco to the plate
to pinch-hit, but Cox had countered with a left-handed pitcher and
Franco was replaced by another pinch-hitter. This time, though, he
faced the right-handed Smoltz and drilled a line drive to
right-center field for a double.
</P>
<P>
   Rickey Henderson, slumbering much of this series, also rapped a
double, this one along the left-field line, and the Braves led,
7-4. Edgardo Alfonzo scared the Braves and their suddenly lively
fans by hitting a fly ball to the fence in right field, but Brian
Jordan was there to catch it for the first out.
</P>
<P>
   John Olerud followed with another ball hit to right, but this
one went on a line and dropped in for a single as Henderson
scampered home. Now the Braves' lead was 7-5.
</P>
<P>
   The next batter was Mike Piazza, whose own play had epitomized
the admirable style of play the Mets had exhibited. The catcher
kept getting knocked down with injuries, but he kept getting up.
His next at-bat would be his crowning moment in the playoffs. He
swung at the last pitch Smoltz would deliver and drove it high over
the fence in right-center.
</P>
<P>
   Braves 7, Mets 7.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets, the incredulity of their play rising batter by batter,
took the lead, 8-7, in the eighth when Melvin Mora singled home a
run against Mike Remlinger. But they let down their guard and
allowed the Braves to tie them in their eighth turn at bat. Brian
Hunter singled home their run against John Franco.
</P>
<P>
   The teams reprised that inning in the 10th. The Mets scored a
run on Todd Pratt's sacrifice fly against John Rocker, the Braves'
closer; the Braves scored on Ozzie Guillen's single against Armando
Benitez, the Mets' closer.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets, however, did not score in the 11th. The Braves did.

 PRIZE-KAN  
 Honoring supply-side economics  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although the Nobel committee didn't get into supply-side
economics when honoring Robert A. Mundell, his prize signified
indisputable recognition of how this once obscure economist changed
the world's political economy.
</P>
<P>
   This year's economics award focused on Mundell's theories about
how exchange-rate policies affect global capital flows and monetary
and fiscal policy. He is credited with providing the intellectual
framework for the euro's creation, which may prove this
generation's most critical experiment in economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   As admirers point out, though, the common thread of his work has
been built on the notion that the wealth of nations is a result of
commitments to free trade, strong and stable currencies,
anti-inflationary policies and relatively low tax burdens.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Mundell became the key architect of supply-side
economics. In a 1990 article, he noted the importance of tax reform
embracing a ``drastic slashing of marginal tax rates.'' This theory
is rooted in the assumption that government should encourage
productive behavior by workers and investors by reducing tax
burdens while minimizing government's regulation of the
marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Mundell began his work in a postwar world of fixed exchange
rates and a widely accepted presumption that economies were closed
systems. Mundell argued, however, that the only closed economy was
the global economy. Some ridiculed the claim, which since has
evolved from disputed theory to recognized economic reality.
Countries that have in recent times attempted to pursue economic
policies independent of what their economic partners were doing
have suffered hard times in the bargain.
</P>
<P>
   The essence of supply-side theory took form in the '70s as
Mundell, joined by his student Arthur Laffer, pondered how the
combination of stagnant growth and hyperinflation defied the
Keynesian model of demand-side economics.
</P>
<P>
   Supply side as theory was tested in practice during the 1980s by
the Reagan administration. While supply side isn't much discussed
anymore, it remains part of the U.S. economic policy mix. It
survives because it worked, although both its friends and foes are
reluctant to give credit where it's due because of the theory's
controversial nature.
</P>
<P>
   The proof of its success, however, has been the durability of
the economic expansion that began 17 years ago next month. Except
for a nine-month recession in 1990-91, the U.S. growth trend has
been steadily up since the practical test of supply-side theory was
initiated. Not even huge tax increases pushed by Presidents Bush
and Clinton have been enough to stop the momentum established in
the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the stock market as measured by the Dow Jones
industrial average soared from just under 800 to over 11,000, and
overall employment surged from just under 100 million to over 133
million. Despite the remarkable run of growth during this period,
the annual inflation rate has plunged from double digits to last
year's 1.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Although supply-side economics was dismissed by mainstream
economists as lacking intellectual credibility, Mundell's honor
goes a long way toward giving it the respect it has always
deserved.

ATLANTA HEADING TO FIFTH WORLD SERIES IN 1990s 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There will be no Game 7.
</P>
<P>
   It took 4 hours and 25 minutes Tuesday night, but the Atlanta
Braves finally rid themselves of the New York Mets in this National
League Championship Series to earn their fifth World Series
appearance in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Rogers, the Mets' eighth pitcher of the game, issued a
one-out, bases-loaded walk to center fielder Andruw Jones on a full
count to score Gerald Williams in the bottom of the 11th inning.
``I was trying to make sure I didn't take wings,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves' 10-9 victory allowed them to eliminate the Mets at
12:38 a.m. EDT.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers, who replaced closer Armando Benitez, surrendered a
leadoff double to Williams, who advanced to third on the sacrifice
bunt of second baseman Bret Boone. Rogers walked third baseman
Chipper Jones and right fielder Brian Jordan intentionally, and the
left-hander could not throw a strike when he and the Mets needed it
most.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets took a 9-8 lead in the 10th inning. Benny Agbayani drew
a leadoff walk from Braves closer John Rocker, and Mets manager
Bobby Valentine instructed Rey Ordonez to attempt a sacrifice bunt.
</P>
<P>
   Ordonez failed, though, and popped the bunt into the glove of
first baseman Brian Hunter. Agbayani attempted to move into scoring
position with a stolen base, but Rocker caught him breaking toward
second and threw to first. Hunter's throw to shortstop Walt Weiss,
though, hit Agbayani in the back, and he later scored on Todd
Pratt's one-out sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves answered against Benitez and forced the evening to
continue on the one-out, run-scoring single by pinch hitter Ozzie
Guillen. ``They were as tough of games as you'll ever want to be
involved in,'' Braves manager Bobby Cox said of Game 6 and Game 5,
which the Mets won in 15 innings.
</P>
<P>
   For five innings, it appeared the Mets would never utilize their
closer. Left-hander Al Leiter, the Mets' best big-game pitcher,
invited the buzzards to form and circle early with his
six-batters-and-out performance. Leiter hit two batters, issued a
walk, surrendered two singles and allowed another to reach base on
a fielder's choice on a grounder hit to the mound in the Braves'
five-run inning. ``I thought we had a pretty good crack at them in
the first inning, but it got a little bit harry there later,'' Cox
said.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter joined Pittsburgh's Bob Moose as the only starting
pitchers in NLCS history not to record an out, and the Mets'
miraculous run during this best-of-seven series appeared done
before right-hander Pat Mahomes threw his first pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Mahomes, though, provided four scoreless innings, and the Mets
struck their first blows in the sixth inning. Consecutive singles
by Edgardo Alfonzo and John Olerud off Kevin Millwood began the
evening's unlikely chain of events, and the Mets scored their first
run on Mike Piazza's sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Darryl Hamilton delivered the clutch hit, a one-out, two-run
single that pulled the Mets within two runs and prompted Millwood's
exit. Atlanta responded to the Mets' challenge during the bottom
half of the inning against right-hander Turk Wendell, and the
Braves breathed a collective sigh of relief after a two-out,
two-run single by pinch hitter Jose Hernandez off left-hander
Dennis Cook.
</P>
<P>
   That 7-3 lead, though, didn't last long.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets rallied in the seventh inning against right-hander John
Smoltz. Matt Franco and Rickey Henderson hit consecutive doubles,
and the latter scored on Olerud's one-out single.
</P>
<P>
   That set the stage for the evening's most dramatic at-bat to
that point.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza, the Mets' banged-up catcher, strode to the plate hitting
.136 (3-for-22) for the series before pummeling Smoltz's 2-1
offering for a game-tying, two-run homer that shocked most _ if not
all _ of the 52,335 spectators at Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   Concern took over after Melvin Mora's pinch-hit, run-scoring
single off left-hander Mike Remlinger gave New York an 8-7 lead,
but Mets left-hander John Franco could not preserve it in the
bottom half of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Braves catcher Eddie Perez reached on a one-out single, and
manager Bobby Cox inserted Otis Nixon as a pinch runner. Nixon
stole second _ one of Atlanta's six stolen bases Tuesday night _
and advanced to third on Piazza's throwing error.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Hunter's game-tying single ensured that this
thrill-a-minute contest carried into the early-morning hours. nn

HARPER MAKES IT ALL LOOK EASIER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ So who plays in Kobe Bryant's absence? Phil Jackson
made the decision sound easy, almost automatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wait 'till you see him play this offense with the rest of the
guys,'' Jackson said of Ron Harper. ``Then you'll say, `Gee, he
really makes everything run a lot smoother for this team.' ''
</P>
<P>
   After the Lakers' 97-90 loss to the Golden State Warriors in
Tuesday's exhibition game at the San Diego Sports Arena, there was
only one thing to say about Harper's performance: !ital!Gee, he
really makes everything run a lot smoother for this team.
</P>
<P>
   Forget Harper's sore right knee and his lack of practice time
with the Lakers. Jackson, who coached Harper for five seasons in
Chicago, said before tipoff that the 35-year-old guard, in any
condition, would make the Lakers a better team when it came to
running the triangle offense.
</P>
<P>
   Results were quick. Harper, running with the first team, helped
the Lakers take a modest lead in the first quarter. But it was
after the Lakers' second team fell to a double-digit deficit in the
second quarter that Harper really made an impact.
</P>
<P>
   He re-entered the game with 4:49 left in the first half, the
Lakers down by 16 points. By halftime, the Lakers had pulled within
two points, 49-47. Harper scored four points in the run, including
a 3-point play, though that didn't account for his non-statistical
contributions. Harper also started the third quarter, and the
Lakers had a 10-point lead by the time he went back to the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the offense,'' Harper said. ``I know where I'm supposed
to go and what I'm going to do. It's not new to me. . . . It will
help guys out, because you have to have someone who knows something
about what they're trying to do out there.''
</P>
<P>
   So what the Lakers will miss in Bryant's athleticism and scoring
as he heals from a broken hand, they will make up for with Harper's
knowledge. Jackson's only other real option was Rick Fox or rookie
Devean George.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Fisher, Harper's backcourt mate, said there's a clear
difference with Harper on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he does allow things to flow a little better because a
lot of times, whether he cuts or makes a pass, he'll define what
option of the triangle we take advantage of, and I think it helps a
lot,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said he would only play Harper about 15 minutes, out of
deference to his surgically repaired right knee and his lack of
conditioning. Harper ended up playing 22 minutes and finished with
nine points, six rebounds, two steals and two assists in his Lakers
debut.
</P>
<P>
   The game also featured Jackson's first technical foul as Lakers
coach. He earned it in the first quarter with a few verbal jousts
at official Leroy Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   __ True test: After the Laker Shootout at the Forum on Thursday
and Friday, the Lakers will have played three games in four days.
All that full-speed work should provide a clearer picture of the
team's progress, Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens in a game is the intensity picks up naturally, so
their reaction has to pick up,'' he said. ``We've been on them
about their execution, about their passing right now. That's one of
our focuses, how good a passing team can we be . . . and under the
duress of the opponents stepping it up and playing tough defense.
It really makes sense for us to have more games because that
doesn't come in the practice setting as much.''

SUPPORT BUSH ARREST DENIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES KELLY AND KRIS MAYES  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   George W. Bush did work at a Houston inner-city youth program in
the early 1970s, but three people familiar with the program said
they never heard that Bush performed the work to erase a
cocaine-possession infraction from his record.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the author of a new biography of Bush reasserted
Tuesday that credible sources told him the Texas governor performed
community service at the P.U.L.L. program to work off a drug
arrest.
</P>
<P>
   The author, J.H. Hatfield, says a judge covered up Bush's arrest
at the behest of Bush's father, George Herbert Walker Bush, who
then was ambassador to the United Nations and later served as
president of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor called the account ``ridiculous'' during a
campaign stop in Phoenix on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, his father also called the accusation groundless.
</P>
<P>
   The story was also discounted by three P.U.L.L. observers.
</P>
<P>
   Ernie Ladd, a former Houston Oilers football player who
co-founded P.U.L.L. with fellow Oiler John White, said White never
mentioned that the younger Bush's service was in any way linked to
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this would have been true, John White would have told me,
and John White has gone to his grave and he never told me about
it,'' Ladd said.
</P>
<P>
   White died in 1988, and the P.U.L.L. program ended that year.
</P>
<P>
   White's widow, Otho Raye White, also said she never heard that
Bush was forced to work at P.U.L.L. in connection with a drug
arrest. She said she recalled no adverse rumors about Bush, but
does remember that he was ``very attached to some of the kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Linda McCarthy, an art instructor for the program, said she did
wonder why a young man from a wealthy, prominent family was working
there. She thought it might have been for personal fulfillment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like he was an open person with a genuine concern for
the children,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Former President Bush, in a statement issued by his Houston
office, criticized Hatfield's use of anonymous sources.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has insulted our son's character, and my character, and I
resent it,'' the senior Bush said. ``This kind of nasty, groundless
attack is the reason that many good people are unwilling to enter
politics.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesperson for the Houston Police Department said the
department is checking its records to see whether it has any
information that bears on the accusation.
</P>
<P>
   The latest cocaine furor surrounding George W. Bush, the
front-runner for the GOP presidential nomination, centers on the
afterword to Hatfield's book, ``Fortunate Son: George W. Bush and
the Making of an American President.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has declined to say flatly that he never used cocaine but
has denied using it in for a period stretching back 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   In the book, published by St. Martin's Press, Hatfield quotes
three anonymous sources said to be close to the Bush family who
allegedly told him that Bush's father interceded with a judge who
expunged a 1972 cocaine-possession arrest from George W. Bush's
record when he successfully completed service with P.U.L.L.
</P>
<P>
   Hatfield said he wasn't able to document those allegations but
had checked out other information from the sources and said they
had proved to be reliable on many matters.
</P>
<P>
   However, another Bush biographer has a different explanation for
Bush's stint at P.U.L.L.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dallas Morning News'' reporter Bill Minutaglio says Bush's
father ``referred his son to Project P.U.L.L. after an incident in
which George W. drove drunk with his younger brother Marvin in the
car.``
</P>
<P>
   Hatfield, who worked as a journalist in Texas for many years but
moved to Arkansas five years ago, says he still believes his
version of the story is correct.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Bush's campaign said Hatfield's account isn't
credible because one of Hatfield's sources described the judge who
helped Bush as a Republican, though there were no Republican judges
in the county at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Hatfield said he has recontacted that source, who stands by his
basic account while admitting his memory may not have been precise.
</P>
<P>
   ``He says, `My memory there was that they (the elder Bush and
the judge) were good friends, I may have had the political
affiliation wrong, but . . . it doesn't matter,' '' Hatfield said.
</P>
<P>
   Hatfield said his sources, to preserve their anonymity, still
are declining to identify the judge or the arresting officer in the
case.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Neville, Hatfield's editor at St. Martin's, which
published the biography, said Hatfield told him the identity of one
of the three sources and appeared to be a careful researcher.
</P>
<P>
   Neville said that on one occasion Hatfield dismissed one rumor
about Bush (which the editor declined to describe) after hiring a
private investigator to check it out and working hard to verify it
himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was always so scrupulous about everything,'' Neville said.
``It helped build a sense of trust between us.'' &QL;

HARPER MAKES IT ALL LOOK EASIER
</HEADLINE>
 TO LAKERS WINNING  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; SAN DIEGO _ So who plays in Kobe Bryant's absence? Phil Jackson
made the decision sound easy, almost automatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wait 'till you see him play this offense with the rest of the
guys,'' Jackson said of Ron Harper. ``Then you'll say, `Gee, he
really makes everything run a lot smoother for this team.' ''
</P>
<P>
   After the Lakers' 97-90 win over the Golden State Warriors in
Tuesday's exhibition game at the San Diego Sports Arena, there was
only one thing to say about Harper's performance: !ital!Gee, he
really makes everything run a lot smoother for this team.
</P>
<P>
   Forget Harper's sore right knee and his lack of practice time
with the Lakers. Jackson, who coached Harper for five seasons in
Chicago, said before tipoff that the 35-year-old guard, in any
condition, would make the Lakers a better team when it came to
running the triangle offense.
</P>
<P>
   Results were quick. Harper, running with the first team, helped
the Lakers take a modest lead in the first quarter. But it was
after the Lakers' second team fell to a double-digit deficit in the
second quarter that Harper really made an impact.
</P>
<P>
   He re-entered the game with 4:49 left in the first half, the
Lakers down by 16 points. By halftime, the Lakers had pulled within
two points, 49-47. Harper scored four points in the run, including
a 3-point play, though that didn't account for his non-statistical
contributions. Harper also started the third quarter, and the
Lakers had a 10-point lead by the time he went back to the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the offense,'' Harper said. ``I know where I'm supposed
to go and what I'm going to do. It's not new to me. . . . It will
help guys out, because you have to have someone who knows something
about what they're trying to do out there.''
</P>
<P>
   So what the Lakers will miss in Bryant's athleticism and scoring
as he heals from a broken hand, they will make up for with Harper's
knowledge. Jackson's only other real option was Rick Fox or rookie
Devean George.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Fisher, Harper's backcourt mate, said there's a clear
difference with Harper on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he does allow things to flow a little better because a
lot of times, whether he cuts or makes a pass, he'll define what
option of the triangle we take advantage of, and I think it helps a
lot,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said he would only play Harper about 15 minutes, out of
deference to his surgically repaired right knee and his lack of
conditioning. Harper ended up playing 22 minutes and finished with
nine points, six rebounds, two steals and two assists in his Lakers
debut.
</P>
<P>
   The game also featured Jackson's first technical foul as Lakers
coach. He earned it in the first quarter with a few verbal jousts
at official Leroy Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   __ True test: After the Laker Shootout at the Forum on Thursday
and Friday, the Lakers will have played three games in four days.
All that full-speed work should provide a clearer picture of the
team's progress, Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens in a game is the intensity picks up naturally, so
their reaction has to pick up,'' he said. ``We've been on them
about their execution, about their passing right now. That's one of
our focuses, how good a passing team can we be . . . and under the
duress of the opponents stepping it up and playing tough defense.
It really makes sense for us to have more games because that
doesn't come in the practice setting as much.''

STUNG BY DEBATE, INDONESIAN PRESIDENT ENDS ELECTION BID 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs grafs 1-4 for updating, rewriting) (bl) 
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ Humiliated by a midnight ballot in the
national assembly that condemned his record, President B.J. Habibie
withdrew as a candidate for president on Wednesday and the assembly
prepared to vote hours later for Indonesia's next leader.
</P>
<P>
   An official of Habibie's party said he had ``conceded gracefully
not to run'' after the newly independent assembly, in a largely
symbolic vote, rejected his recent state of the nation address by a
margin of just 33 ballots of 690 cast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was satisfied by my term in office,'' Habibie told reporters
at his home on Wednesday morning. ``I was given the opportunity to
devote myself to this nation. I'm happy that democracy has started
in Indonesia and I hope this will continue whoever the new
President is.''
</P>
<P>
   Two candidates were left to compete for the presidency: Megawati
Sukarnoputri, the opposition leader who won the most votes in a
parliamentary election in June, and Abdurrahman Wahid, an
influential Muslim leader who was once her closest political ally.
</P>
<P>
   The election of a new president will complete a tumultuous
transition from Indonesia's autocratic former president, Suharto,
who was forced to resign in May 1998. The vote against Habibie, a
close associate of Suharto who took his place as president, was a
sign of the momentum of democratic reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the members of the assembly that will choose the
president were elected last June in Indonesia's first free
nationwide ballot in a generation. There are fears of unrest in
Indonesia if Ms. Megawati fails to win the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Moments after the vote on Habibie, the chairman of the assembly,
Amien Rais, announced that the group had decided by consensus to
end a quarter century of Indonesian rule in East Timor, a former
Portuguese colony.
</P>
<P>
   That decision formally accepted the results of an Aug. 30
referendum in which 87.5 percent of the people of East Timor voted
for independence. The referendum was followed by a wave of violence
that caused the deployment of an international peacekeeping force
that is still struggling to pacify the territory.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said Indonesia would hand over
formal control of East Timor to the United Nations before year's
end. The United Nations plans to administer the territory for two
to three years as a transition to independent rule.
</P>
<P>
   In a session that took several significant steps toward remaking
Indonesia's political structure, the assembly also agreed by
consensus to limit the president to two five-year terms and to
shift lawmaking power from the president to the legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Those steps toward establishing a more democratic and
accountable government were mirrored by the free-wheeling demeanor
of the assembly, flexing and admiring its new muscles after three
decades of subservience to Suharto.
</P>
<P>
   Not once but twice in recent days, representatives of each of 11
parliamentary factions presented lengthy _ and mostly damning _
critiques of Habibie's state of the nation address, which he
presented last Thursday. The speeches were interrupted repeatedly
from the floor by legislators who, under Suharto, would have been
ejected for their effrontery.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout, Habibie sat to one side of the speaker's podium,
like a reprimanded schoolboy, grimacing and scribbling notes.
</P>
<P>
   No Indonesian president had ever been subjected to such
humiliation _ or such democracy. There was a certain dignity and
even bravery in this. Habibie is the first Indonesian president to
maintain a measure of humility about his role.
</P>
<P>
   Habibie was suffering not only for his own perceived sins but
also for those of his mentor and friend, Suharto, who was the real
foil for the changes taking place here.
</P>
<P>
   The accusations leveled at Habibie during the last few days in
the assembly had their roots in the abuses of Suharto's 32 years in
power: corruption, violations of human rights, the debacle of
Indonesian rule in East Timor and Habibie's refusal to pursue his
predecessor in the courts.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Indonesia's Supreme Court _ apparently no longer
feeling the need to support Habibie _ ruled that an auditor's
report must be released to the Parliament in a high-profile bank
scandal that has badly damaged his political standing.
</P>
<P>
   Secrecy over the allegations that $80 million intended to help
banks restructure their debts had been channeled to Habibie's
supporters had led to a suspension of $4.7 billion in international
loans.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the vote Monday night, his candidacy had been
further wounded when the armed forces chief, Wiranto, went on
television to announce that he would not accept Habibie's
invitation to stand as his Vice Presidential running mate.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement suggested to some analysts that the military
had made a political judgment that Habibie was not likely to win
the election and that it would be politically damaging to be allied
with him. The general's withdrawal also freed military officers in
the legislature to vote against Habibie. The military controls a
bloc of more than 40 votes in the assembly.
</P>
<P>
   It was one of many poignant moments for Habibie, a marginal
figure under Suharto who tried in vain to fill his shoes as
president. Wiranto had played a key role in May 1998 in telling
Suharto that the time had come for him to step down. He had then
become Habibie's first and most crucial ally.
</P>
<P>
   With his damning announcement Sunday, Wiranto earned the
distinction of having signaled to two successive presidents that
they had lost power.
</P>
<P>
   In the theater of Indonesian public life, where all Suharto had
to do was smile enigmatically to demonstrate his power, the last
few days of unabashed criticism appeared to have drained Habibie of
his public standing.
</P>
<P>
   The reading of the vote that sealed his future late Monday
night, with each tally marked on a large white board at the front
of the chamber, was accompanied by hoots and cheers and catcalls
that one local reporter compared to the irreverence of schoolboys.
</P>
<P>
   When the final count was announced, many of the parliamentarians
raised their palms in Muslim prayer and shouted, ``God is great!''
Some hugged each other.
</P>
<P>
   In the press gallery above, Indonesian reporters began to dance
and clap and wave their arms, and led the hall in the singing of
the national anthem: ``Free, Free Indonesia.''

CONSERVATION AREA NEAR CAN YON URGED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE YOZWIAK  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A new bill by Rep. Bob Stump challenges Interior Secretary Bruce
Babbitt's plans to preserve the vast lands northwest of the Grand
Canyon, calling instead for continued mining, road construction,
air tours and land giveaways.
</P>
<P>
   Stump, R-Ariz., told a U.S. House Resources subcommittee Tuesday
that his plan for a Shivwits Plateau National Conservation Area
would protect the environment and allow traditional and historic
uses of more than 500,000 acres across the southern tip of the
Arizona Strip.
</P>
<P>
   ``H.R. 2795 protects the remoteness, native biodiversity and
ecological richness of the Shivwits Plateau, but at the same time
increases public awareness, outdoor recreation use enjoyment,''
Stump said.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt joined environmentalists in denouncing the measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``This legislation actually weaken(s) protections in existing
law,'' Babbitt testified, ``and would make it difficult if not
impossible to protect sensitive, valuable resources.''
</P>
<P>
   Stump, whose sprawling District 3 covers western Arizona and the
West Valley's Sun Cities, wants to create a ``national conservation
area'' in the sparsely populated lands settled over the past
century by Mormon pioneer ranchers.
</P>
<P>
   Stump said he developed his legislation in response to Babbitt's
plans announced last year for a Shivwits Plateau National Monument.
The measure was drafted, he said, after months of consultation with
those who live and work on the Arizona Strip.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than stopping mining and development, as proposed under
Babbitt's plan, critics said, Stump's bill would specifically
prevent the Interior secretary from halting uranium mining near the
Grand Canyon.
</P>
<P>
   Stump's bill, they said, would also allow the spraying of toxic
herbicides and bulldozing of trees and bushes to open up grasslands
for local ranchers. And it would disclose the locations of
archaeological sites and delete proposed wilderness protections
from Glen Canyon National Recreation Area, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill would strip the Arizona Strip,'' said Dave Simon of
the National Parks and Conservation Association, one of several
environmental groups opposing Stump.
</P>
<P>
   Pam Eaton of the Wilderness Society said, ``I am stumped by Mr.
Stump's bill. He says that he wants to protect the lands
surrounding Grand Canyon National Park, then he goes on to ensure
they are pillaged.''
</P>
<P>
   Rob Smith of the Sierra Club said Stump's bill ``should be
called the Grand Canyon National Destruction Act.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This proposal declares war on the wilderness and antiquities
of the Grand Canyon's wildest region,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Geoff Barnard, president of the Grand Canyon Trust, said Stump's
bill is about conservation ``in name only.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill must be put to a merciful death, and after that is
done, we have to go back to the drawing board and design a proposal
for real Shivwits protection,'' Barnard said.
</P>
<P>
   Stump denounced the environmentalists' assessments as lacking
``any substance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing in this bill that increases or encourages the
commercialization of the Shivwits Plateau,'' Stump said in a
statement released after Tuesday's hearing.
</P>
<P>
   A rancher, local county supervisors from Arizona and Utah and a
representative of Arizona Gov. Jane Hull testified in favor of the
bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that the existing use of the Shivwits Plateau is
balanced, appropriate and sensitive to the natural and historic
wonder of this beautiful part of the state of Arizona,'' Hull said
in a letter Tuesday to Rep. Jim Hansen, R-Utah, chairman of the
subcommittee on national parks and public lands.
</P>
<P>
   Hays Gilstrap, an Arizona Game and Fish Commissioner who
testified in behalf of Hull, said Stump's bill takes into account
the needs of the people who live on the Arizona Strip.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Stump) also knows the commitments made by the federal
government to the people of Arizona regarding the use of this area,
and his bill incorporates those past promises,'' Gilstrap said.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Babbitt spent two days traveling the region with
some of the nation's top environmentalists and some of the
Southwest's top brass of the National Park Service and U.S. Bureau
of Land Management.
</P>
<P>
   After scanning the area's canyons and climbing to the top of
7,000-foot Mount Dellenbaugh, Babbitt declared his intent to see
the establishment of a new national monument. He said it would be
preferable for Congress to establish the monument. But if that
fails, Babbitt said, he will recommend that President Clinton use
his powers under the 1906 Antiquities Act to establish a monument
through an executive action.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt said his plans would ensure that ranching and hunting
across the Arizona Strip could continue. But at public hearings
earlier this year, ranchers and others voiced their suspicion of
any new federal controls. &QL;

HARPER MAKES IT ALL LOOK EASIER
</HEADLINE>
 WITH LAKERS WINNING (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; SAN DIEGO _ So who plays in Kobe Bryant's absence? Phil Jackson
made the decision sound easy, almost automatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wait 'till you see him play this offense with the rest of the
guys,'' Jackson said of Ron Harper. ``Then you'll say, `Gee, he
really makes everything run a lot smoother for this team.' ''
</P>
<P>
   After the Lakers' 97-90 win over the Golden State Warriors in
Tuesday's exhibition game at the San Diego Sports Arena, there was
only one thing to say about Harper's performance: !ital!Gee, he
really makes everything run a lot smoother for this team.
</P>
<P>
   Forget Harper's sore right knee and his lack of practice time
with the Lakers. Jackson, who coached Harper for five seasons in
Chicago, said before tipoff that the 35-year-old guard, in any
condition, would make the Lakers a better team when it came to
running the triangle offense.
</P>
<P>
   Results were quick. Harper, running with the first team, helped
the Lakers take a modest lead in the first quarter. But it was
after the Lakers' second team fell to a double-digit deficit in the
second quarter that Harper really made an impact.
</P>
<P>
   He re-entered the game with 4:49 left in the first half, the
Lakers down by 16 points. By halftime, the Lakers had pulled within
two points, 49-47. Harper scored four points in the run, including
a 3-point play, though that didn't account for his non-statistical
contributions. Harper also started the third quarter, and the
Lakers had a 10-point lead by the time he went back to the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the offense,'' Harper said. ``I know where I'm supposed
to go and what I'm going to do. It's not new to me. . . . It will
help guys out, because you have to have someone who knows something
about what they're trying to do out there.''
</P>
<P>
   So what the Lakers will miss in Bryant's athleticism and scoring
as he heals from a broken hand, they will make up for with Harper's
knowledge. Jackson's only other real option was Rick Fox or rookie
Devean George.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Fisher, Harper's backcourt mate, said there's a clear
difference with Harper on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he does allow things to flow a little better because a
lot of times, whether he cuts or makes a pass, he'll define what
option of the triangle we take advantage of, and I think it helps a
lot,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said he would only play Harper about 15 minutes, out of
deference to his surgically repaired right knee and his lack of
conditioning. Harper ended up playing 22 minutes and finished with
nine points, six rebounds, two steals and two assists in his Lakers
debut.
</P>
<P>
   The game also featured Jackson's first technical foul as Lakers
coach. He earned it in the first quarter with a few verbal jousts
at official Leroy Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   __ True test: After the Laker Shootout at the Forum on Thursday
and Friday, the Lakers will have played three games in four days.
All that full-speed work should provide a clearer picture of the
team's progress, Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens in a game is the intensity picks up naturally, so
their reaction has to pick up,'' he said. ``We've been on them
about their execution, about their passing right now. That's one of
our focuses, how good a passing team can we be . . . and under the
duress of the opponents stepping it up and playing tough defense.
It really makes sense for us to have more games because that
doesn't come in the practice setting as much.''

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Four weeks ago to the day, the Mets barreled into town
full of heady pretensions and the fragile confidence of a team that
was having its first dreams of the top after a decade of
mediocrity. They had put distance between themselves and Cincinnati
in the National League wild-card race and had pulled within a game
of the Braves _ the foe they have chased for so long in the East
Division. With three games at Turner Field, the Mets were certain
they would come out even with Atlanta at the very least.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Mets were humbled. They suffered three
confidence-draining losses that set the stage for one of the
wildest rides in franchise history. Disaster in Atlanta; three more
demoralizing losses to lowly Philadelphia, then two more defeats to
Atlanta at Shea.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the Mets had tumbled from the lofty quest of a
division championship to the desperation of a team trying to back
into a wild-card playoff.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets returned to Atlanta on Tuesday night not with the same
swagger of September, but with the firm, no-nonsense confidence of
a team that had gone to the depths and back; a humbled team that
respected all and feared none. Once again, they failed to conquer
the mountain that Atlanta has become, but the Mets team that lost,
10-9, in 11 innings, in no way resembled the team that was chased
away in September. This could be the beginning of a new winning
era.
</P>
<P>
   The manner of the Mets' loss early Wednesday morning _ a
bases-loaded walk _ was inconsistent with their play of the last
three weeks when they gave no quarter, issued no easy passes.
</P>
<P>
   What happened to this team between Sept. 21 and Oct. 19 is a
baseball story to close out the decade fittingly. Tuesday night's
Game 6 was the Mets' season in a neat frame. The ups, the downs,
the sense of being lost and suddenly finding a center.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta scored five runs in the first inning and chased Al
Leiter out of the playoffs. Just as their obituaries were being
written, the Mets scored three runs in the sixth inning. Atlanta
scored two more runs in the bottom of the inning to boost the lead
back to 7-3 and provide a desperately hoped for comfort zone. But
this was not that kind of party anymore.
</P>
<P>
   After 12 regular-season games with Atlanta, so many one- and
two-run frustrations and that 15-inning Game 5 marathon in New York
on Sunday, this was not about hoping anymore. In the seventh,
facing the former Cy Young award winner John Smoltz, the Mets
produced a rally capped by the wounded Mike Piazza's two-run home
run. Score tied. Then the Mets took an 8-7 lead in the eighth
inning. Benny Agbayani singled and Melvin Mora knocked him in.
</P>
<P>
   Game over? These are not the same old Mets.
</P>
<P>
   What happened in that four-week period? ``When we came here
before, we were thinking, `Okay, we can maybe get two out of three,
maybe sweep these guys, then we're tied up or ahead in the
division,''' recalled Darryl Hamilton, the Mets' center fielder,
who joined the team in a midseason trade. ``Then we thought we can
go on and take care of business at home. But when that snowballed
into a losing streak, guys realized that the only thing that was
important is the game you go out and play. One game at a time. Our
psyche has changed totally.''
</P>
<P>
   With their division dreams crushed to pieces, the Mets put
themselves back together with what was left. The young players
snapped out of a daze and the veterans faced up to reality that
time was passing.
</P>
<P>
   The team grew, the team jelled, the team matured. The Mets swept
a three-game series against Pittsburgh, then won a wild-card
playoff game against Cincinnati. They disposed of favored Arizona,
suffered three straight losses to Atlanta in the Championship
Series, then scored back-to-back victories, the second in that
15-inning classic on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   So the changed Mets came back to Atlanta. All those miles
traveled, the ups, the downs, the upheavals. All the steep inclines
and plummets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our attitude's a little different right now,'' Hamilton said.
``That losing streak was a very humbling experience. We realized
that, no matter how good your ball club is, usually the best team
doesn't win. We think we have a very good ball club but we lost a
lot of critical games at the end and it almost cost us a playoff
berth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys really appreciate where we are right now. We understand
that it can go away at any instant.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets have taken a harrowing four-week journey _ from Georgia
to Pennsylvania to New York to Ohio to Arizona back to New York and
now Georgia again _ and believe it has built a resolve the Mets may
not have had four weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think we ran out of gas,'' Hamilton said in the Mets'
somber clubhouse. ``Kenny Rogers gave everything he had. Benitez
gave everything he had. He didn't have much left. But he gave it
all. It's just tough at this point to say that it's over.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is really over. The Mets will certainly make some
adjustments, some additions, some subtractions. But they have an
infrastructure that could introduce a new decade of winning. This
was a beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had destiny in our own hands, we lost destiny, we got it
back in our own hands,'' said Steve Phillips, the Mets' general
manager.
</P>
<P>
   They have erased the losers stigma and the label of
underachievers. ``If things had gone differently, we could have won
the division and gotten here the same way,'' Phillips said. ``But
the way we've gotten to this point is going to be so much more
fulfilling when it's all said and done because we overcame
something and a label can never be attached to us again. We didn't
choke. We didn't fold. We won.''  &QL;

BRAVES LOOKING FORWARD TO THEIR NEXT TRIP TO NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The rowdy John Rocker and his Atlanta Braves teammates
are returning to New York, the site of Rocker's war of words with
the city's baseball fans. But Rocker, who exchanged expletives and
obscene gestures with Mets fans throughout the National League
Championship Series, said he did not expect to have such a nasty
relationship with those who cheer for the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got no problem with the Yankees fans,'' said Rocker, who
pitched two innings in Game 6 as the Braves clinched their fifth
World Series appearance of the decade early Wednesday morning with
a 10-9, 11th-inning victory over the Mets at Turner Field.
``They're some of the best fans around, and I'm going to enjoy
playing at Yankee Stadium. Of course, it's a historic stadium and I
can't wait.''
</P>
<P>
   Chipper Jones, who told the fans at Shea Stadium to begin
rooting for the Yankees after his work as a one-man wrecking crew
left the Mets all but dead near the end of the regular season, said
he didn't plan to ignite as much of a furor in his next trip to New
York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ain't giving nothing,'' Jones said when asked if he would
engage in trash talk with Yankees fans. ``I'm sure I'll have to
take a little bit. It's New York.''
</P>
<P>
   As the champagne squirted from bottles and the cheers and hugs
filled the clubhouse, the Braves refused to talk about strategy or
matchups for the World Series against the defending champion
Yankees. Manager Bobby Cox said he had not thought about who would
be his starting pitcher Saturday in Game 1 at Turner Field, though
Tom Glavine, who would have been the Game 7 starter against the
Mets, was the most likely candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Despite having the league's best regular-season record at
103-59, the Braves consider themselves to be the underdogs. That
may be a ploy to get in the Yankees' heads or to take the pressure
off themselves, but Jones said no one expected the Braves to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be the world champs you have to beat the world champs,'' he
said. ``They've been the best team in the league over the past
three or four years, at the top of the heap, so it's going to be a
tough job for us.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're obviously the favorites and we're the underdogs, so
we've just got to play our hearts out and let the chips fall where
they may.''
</P>
<P>
   In this new era of interleague play, the Braves met the Yankees
three times during the regular season, winning two of three games
at Yankee Stadium. Glavine defeated Roger Clemens, 6-2; Russ
Springer was the winner in a 10-7 victory, and Andy Pettitte led
the Yankees to an 11-4 victory in the third game of that mid-July
series.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did O.K. against them in the regular season, so we feel
good about our chances,'' said Kevin Millwood, who started Game 6
against the Mets but was relieved after allowing three runs and
eight hits in five and a third innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we go out and pitch the way that we can and hit the ball,
we can win it.''
</P>
<P>
   The clubs also met in the World Series in 1996 in what became a
nightmarish experience for Atlanta. After outscoring the Yankees by
16-1 in taking a two-games-to-none lead, they lost four straight
games. Strangely, the Braves won the first two games at Yankee
Stadium before losing all three times at home.
</P>
<P>
   This Series also holds implications of which team will be called
the team of the decade. The Braves, winners of eight straight
division titles but only one World Series in the 1990s, would
probably get the nod if they defeat the Yankees. The Yankees would
almost certainly take the title if they win their third
championship in four years.
</P>
<P>
   After winning such a exhausting series with the Mets, the Braves
don't want to end the millennium empty-handed, as they have so
often this decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, this has been a great run and we want to finish it
off,'' pitcher John Smoltz said. ``All we want to do is win the
1999 World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't do some of the things we got away with in this
series. We can't do that against the Yankees.''

TRAIN TO SHEA STALLS IN ATLANTA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for rewriting throughout) (sw) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Subway Series will not take the IRT to Queens. It
will ride Marta in Atlanta instead.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets, as remarkable a team as has ever played a post-season
baseball game, ran out of incredulous comebacks early Wednesday
morning, dropping a 10-9 decision in 11 innings to the Braves in
Game 6 of the National League Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   Playing perhaps even more magically than their 1969 ancestors in
the last three weeks, the Mets overcame deficits of 5-0 and 7-3,
snatched 8-7 and 9-8 leads of their own and finally succumbed when
Kenny Rogers threw a bases-loaded 3-2 pitch high and outside to
Andruw Jones, forcing home Gerald Williams, who had started the
inning with a double.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Pratt, who was catching, said the first pitch from Rogers
to Jones was a curveball that was a ball ``all the way out of his
hand.'' After that, he said: ``It was just sinker, sinker, sinker.
We wanted to get him to hit a ball into the ground so we could get
a double play.''
</P>
<P>
   With a 2-0 count, Jones fouled off a pitch, then took the third
ball and the second strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just missed a couple,'' Pratt said. Then the left-handed
Rogers went into his motion for his sixth pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 3-2 pitch just sailed away from him,'' the catcher said.
``It was supposed to be his sinker. It sailed.''
</P>
<P>
   John Franco, who gave up the run that tied the game in the
eighth, said the bench had been alive during the Mets' comeback.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was great, a storybook ending,'' he said, ``the way we've
been battling, coming back, our backs against the wall, getting
behind early in the game and the way guys battled back and the way
we held in there from the end of September until now. We had a good
feeling about everything. We just didn't get it done. It took me 16
years to get here and to come so close, it's hard.''
</P>
<P>
   In the space of four playoff games this month, Bobby Cox, the
Braves' manager, used two of his four starting pitchers in relief.
Kevin Millwood, who had pitched a one-hitter in the second game of
the division series against Houston, secured a 5-3 victory in Game
3 by pitching the 12th inning. In the second game of the NLCS
against the Mets, Smoltz made the first relief appearance of his
career and preserved a 4-3 victory with his ninth-inning effort.
</P>
<P>
   Cox resisted the temptation to use Millwood in relief in the
15th inning of Sunday's Game 5 in New York, and the Mets rallied
for two runs and a 4-3 victory. But Cox called on Smoltz in the
seventh inning Tuesday night, and he did not fare as well in the
second relief appearance of his career as he did in the first. The
Mets, continuing to display the most remarkable resiliency in their
history, battered Smoltz for four runs in the space of five batters
and overcame their second large deficit of the game.
</P>
<P>
   The day before this game, Millwood had expressed a view that so
many players on teams with a 3-2 series lead have uttered. ``We
definitely don't want it to go to a seventh game,'' the pitcher
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves, who had the look of a loser after Game 5, wasted no
time trying to make sure a seventh game would be out of the
question. They scored five runs and knocked Al Leiter out after he
had pitched to only six batters and thrown 25 pitches. Pitching on
three days' rest, an unnatural act for him, Leiter hit two of the
batters, walked another and gave up run-scoring singles to two
others.
</P>
<P>
   Cox had not used Millwood in relief Sunday because, he explained
yet again before Game 6, ``our club was not in desperation,''
``there's no guarantee he's going to lock it up on a rain-slickened
mound'' and ``he still had a game to pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   This was that game, and Millwood made Cox look brilliant _ for
five innings. He maintained his 5-0 advantage easily, holding the
Mets to four harmless hits. But these Mets could be contained for
only so long. They came out scorching in the sixth inning, erupting
for three runs, the last two scoring on Darryl Hamilton's third
single, which also knocked Millwood out of the game.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Smoltz came in to start the seventh, the Braves had
added two more runs. Cox used Smoltz there because he didn't have
another game to pitch, not in this series; the mound wasn't wet and
the Braves, well, maybe a trace of desperation was creeping in.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Franco, the Mets' pinch-hitter deluxe, was the first batter
Smoltz would face. Twice before in the series, Bobby Valentine, the
Mets' manager, had sent the left-hand-hitting Franco to the plate
to pinch-hit, but Cox had countered with a left-handed pitcher and
Franco was replaced by another pinch-hitter. This time, though, he
faced the right-handed Smoltz and drilled a line drive to
right-center field for a double.
</P>
<P>
   Rickey Henderson, slumbering much of this series, also rapped a
double, this one along the left-field line, and the Braves led,
7-4. Edgardo Alfonzo scared the Braves and their suddenly lively
fans by hitting a fly ball to the fence in right field, but Brian
Jordan was there to catch it for the first out.
</P>
<P>
   John Olerud followed with another ball hit to right, but this
one went on a line and dropped in for a single as Henderson
scampered home. Now the Braves' lead was 7-5.
</P>
<P>
   The next batter was Mike Piazza, whose own play had epitomized
the admirable style of play the Mets had exhibited. The catcher
kept getting knocked down with this injury and that, that injury
and this, but he kept getting up. His next at-bat would be his
crowning moment in the playoffs. He swung at the last pitch Smoltz
would deliver in the second relief appearance of his career and
drove it high over the fence in right-center.
</P>
<P>
   Braves 7, Mets 7.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets, the incredulity of their play rising batter by batter,
took the lead, 8-7, in the eighth when Melvin Mora singled home a
run against Mike Remlinger. But they let down their guard and
allowed the Braves to tie them in their eighth turn at bat. Brian
Hunter singled home their run against John Franco.
</P>
<P>
   The teams reprised that inning in the 10th. The Mets scored a
run on Todd Pratt's sacrifice fly against John Rocker, the Braves'
closer; the Braves scored on Ozzie Guillen's single against Armando
Benitez, the Mets' closer. The Mets, however, did not score in the
11th. The Braves did.

 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
ATLANTA _ If you're going to gamble, you might as well do it with
someone named Kenny Rogers on the mound.
<TEXT>
<P>
   When a manager loads the bases with a pair of intentional walks,
he's betting his pitcher will be able to throw strikes to the
hitter of choice. Rogers' inability to do so Tuesday night ended
the New York Mets' improbable rise from the grave in a 10-9,
11-inning loss to the Atlanta Braves in Game 6 of the National
League Championship Series at Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers walked Braves center fielder Andruw Jones with the bases
loaded, forcing home the winning run and sending the Braves into
the World Series against the New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Kenny felt he could throw a pitch and get him (Jones)
to swing on something on his own _ possibly early _ and he didn't
do it,'' Mets manager Bobby Valentine said.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves appeared set to make short work of the Mets when they
jumped out to a 3-0 lead in the best-of-seven NLCS. But the Mets
won the next two games, making a strong bid to become the first
team in the history of postseason baseball to overcome a three-game
deficit.
</P>
<P>
   Never was their resilience greater than Tuesday, when fell
behind by five runs after an inning but then chased red-hot Braves
starter Kevin Millwood from the game in the sixth. By the time the
seventh rolled around, John Smoltz came trotting from the bullpen
to protect a 7-3 Atlanta lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets tied the game with four seventh-inning runs off Smoltz,
and the teams exchanged runs in the eighth and 10th innings before
the Braves had the last laugh in the 11th.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what baseball is all about,'' said Braves left fielder
Gerald Williams, whose double started the 11th-inning rally. ``You
never know when you're going to be down, and you never know when
you're going to be up.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just have to keep doing things that are going to allow you
to compete from inning to inning. Even when we lost the lead, we
knew that didn't mean we lost the game. Our guys never gave up.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentine spoke proudly when he said his team left it all on the
field in Sunday's Game 5 marathon, won 4-3 by the Mets in 15
innings.
</P>
<P>
   He was wrong. There was plenty left in the Mets' tanks, almost
enough to deny the Braves a chance to defend their Team of the '90s
title in the World Series. Those holding out hope for a Subway
Series will have to settle for a rematch of the 1996 World Series,
which the Yankees won in six games over the Braves. Game 1 comes
Saturday night at Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's clincher gave the Braves their ninth NL pennant and
their fifth of the decade, but this one almost slipped through
their grasp.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have to play better (against the Yankees) than we played
in the last four games, that's for sure,'' said Braves catcher
Eddie Perez, named Most Valuable Player of the NLCS.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets wore the face of defeat early in the evening when
starter Al Leiter, working on three days' rest for only the second
time in his career, lasted just six batters and didn't record an
out. It tied for the shortest outing in LCS history.
</P>
<P>
   The first six Braves reached base before righthanded reliever
Pat Mahomes finally recorded an out on Brian Hunter's sacrifice
fly. Prior to that, Perez stroked a two-run single, Brian Jordan
had an RBI base hit, and Williams scored from third on an error by
Mets catcher Mike Piazza, who made a bad throw trying to thwart a
double steal.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets pulled within two runs with a three-run sixth inning
highlighted by Darryl Hamilton's two-run single. The Braves loaded
the bases against Mets reliever Turk Wendell in the bottom of the
inning, and pinch hitter Jose Hernandez alleviated the traffic jam
with a two-out, two-run single off Dennis Cook to push the Braves'
lead to 7-3.
</P>
<P>
   In the seventh, the Mets treated Smoltz no better than they did
rookie Kevin McGlinchy in his Game 5 pounding. Smoltz gave up one
rocket after another, culminating with Piazza's game-tying two-run
homer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We held their hitters in check for most of the series and most
of the year, and then all of a sudden everything was a line
drive,'' Braves manager Bobby Cox said. ``Smoltz was throwing
harder than I've seen him throw all year, and he got hit hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Mets outfielder Melvin Mora broke the tie with a single in the
eighth, but Hunter's line drive up the middle knotted the score
again in the bottom of the inning. The Mets scored again in the
10th on Todd Pratt's sacrifice fly, but the Braves answered that,
too, pulling even on Ozzie Guillen's pinch-hit single.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to take some time during the winter to watch these
games and try to enjoy them like I think millions of people got to
enjoy them,'' Valentine said. ``I think they were fabulous games.''

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
ATLANTA _ Destiny? Bobby Valentine got a kick out of that one.
Sure, his Mets were still kicking, against some pretty unfavorable
odds, but he didn't see where they had quite saved the National
League Championship Series just yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're playing in a place where we've won one game and lost 14,
and we have Kevin Millwood pitching against us,'' the feisty Mets
manager said Tuesday during his pre-game news conference in the
Turner Field basement. ``And people say, `Bobby, everything is
going your way.'''
</P>
<P>
   We laughed.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the Mets cried, losing as painfully as a team can lose,
10-9 on a bases-loaded walk in the bottom of the 11th inning. But
it wasn't before they made the Braves sweat BBs, bullets and blood.
For much of this interminable _ as usual _ evening, Atlanta's
Tomahawk Chop wore the look of another Tomahawk choke.
</P>
<P>
   The Amazins hadn't left everything at Shea. They had fought the
good fight there, saving two match points across the Flushing Line
tracks from the National Tennis Center, but enough was enough,
right? No, sir. Just as they were seemingly about to get aced in
Atlanta by the Braves' new ace Millwood, they staged another
gut-check uprising.
</P>
<P>
   Because a 5-0 first-inning lead wouldn't hold up, a 3-0 lead in
games nearly didn't hold up for the Braves, either. In this
30th-anniversary autumn of perhaps the most astounding championship
run of baseball's modern era, the Mets attempted, with everything
they had, to stage a worthy repeat.
</P>
<P>
   The 1969 team had no business going the distance, and neither
did this one. But it might have, if the Braves hadn't sucked up to
twice erase one-run deficits, the second of which victimized their
most feared nemesis, Armando Benitez.
</P>
<P>
   Once they broke through against Benitez, eking out a tying run
in the bottom of the 10th on Ozzie Guillen's pinch-hit RBI single
scoring Andruw Jones, Kenny Rogers figured to be an easy mark. And
he was, although Valentine put Mr. Rogers in a tough, tough
neighborhood by ordering consecutive intentional walks to Chipper
Jones and Brian Jordan, after Gerald Williams' leadoff double and a
sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   With a full count and no place to put Andruw, he couldn't throw
one last strike.
</P>
<P>
   And so ends a stunningly memorable _ good and bad _ NLCS. There
will be no Subway Series. Atlantans probably will be disinclined to
take the Amtrak to Penn Station, then change trains to get them
uptown to the Bronx, where the Yankees wait.
</P>
<P>
   The Fall Classic begins here Saturday night. Maybe by then the
Braves' hearts will be out of their throats and they won't be
calling this place stomach-Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   It never should have come to an 11th-inning walk. You know it, I
know it, and they know it. How does a team of Atlanta's stature, a
team that has come to define pitching excellence in our time, give
up nine runs on its home turf under such crucial circumstances?
When spotted a five-run advantage before the other team manages to
get a second out?
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the Braves were lucky to take it to extra innings. The
three-run New York sixth might have been bigger if Rey Ordonez's
screaming liner hadn't had eyes for Walt Weiss' glove. Weiss, the
Astros-killer in the Division Series, easily doubled Darryl
Hamilton off second, slamming the door on that rally.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing apparently daunts these Mets. Not even the visage of
the great John Smoltz jogging in from the bullpen to work the
seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Cox had stupidly _ we thought _ let the rookie Kevin
McGlinchy self-destruct in the 15th inning Sunday while his stable
of stud starters stood around with their hands in their pockets in
the bullpen. Cox felt no sense of urgency, and some of us fried him
for it.
</P>
<P>
   Wrongly, I suppose, based on the train wreck Smoltz left in his
wake Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   His surprisingly stellar relief work in Game 2, when he earned
his first-ever save, had prompted conversation about him perhaps
finishing his career as another Dennis Eckersley. No chance now, is
there?
</P>
<P>
   The Mets humiliated Smoltz, who was greeted with a hero's
welcome only to slink off to a stunned silence after the Mets
pulverized him. He came in leading 7-3 and left to a tie score, if
you can imagine. The only out he got, a towering fly to
right-center by Edgardo Alfonzo, carried to near the top of the
fence.
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz will start in the Fall Classic. He will not relieve. Bet
on it.
</P>
<P>
   Before Millwood took a header in the sixth after 5 strong
innings, each Atlanta starter had gone a minimum of seven, with
none yielding more than two earned runs or walking more than one
batter. And stopper John Rocker, although he tends to be goofiness
personified, never did officially surrender an earned run despite
appearing in every one of the games.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves have a chance to avenge their 1996 Series loss to the
Yankees, when a two-game lead was squandered, because of their
pitching, Smoltz's debacle notwithstanding. The Mets, in turn,
won't be there for a battle of the boroughs because theirs didn't
hold up, starting with Al Leiter, heretofore their Mr. Clutch.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter's plunking Williams and Chipper Jones in the first inning
was unprecedented in LCS play. Add a walk plus Mike Piazza's errant
throw to third on a double steal, and the Mets quickly had a
serious mess on their hands. Atlanta was ahead 2-0 and still had
the the bases loaded with no outs in the first _ on one single.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves' second single, by Senor October, Eddie Perez, the
series' deserving Most Valuable Player for going 10-for-20 with two
homers and five RBIs, gave them a 4-0 lead. Brian Hunter's
sacrifice fly _ the Mets' first recorded out _ made it 5-0.
</P>
<P>
   Which, while ultimately far from enough, was one more run than
the Braves had tallied in any of the preceeding five NLCS games.
Atlanta had generated only five earned runs over the last 33
innings and was threatening another October crash. The Jones boys _
Chipper, Andruw and Dow _ have had much in common, you know.
</P>
<P>
   But the Braves finally got mad. Now they've got a chance to get
even with the Yankees.

SUBWAY SERIES DERAILED AS BRAVES TOP METS, 10-9

<P>
   ATLANTA _ A team's momentum, Mets Manager Bobby Valentine
believes, is only as strong as its starting pitcher. Valentine may
have underestimated his team's resilience, but early Wednesday
morning, in Game 6 of the National League Championship Series, the
momentum and magic that had carried the Mets on their exhilarating
rampage through the post-season finally ran out.
</P>
<P>
   Overcoming a 5-0 first-inning deficit, but drained of the
ability to hold on to their latest improbable comeback, the Mets
lost by 10-9 when Kenny Rogers, the eighth Mets pitcher, walked in
the winning run in the bottom of the 11th inning, to send the
Atlanta Braves to their fifth World Series in the 1990's. They will
face the Yankees, who beat the Braves in the 1996 World Series,
beginning Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets' loss, coming after another ferocious game in which
they took their first lead in the eighth inning and had another
lead in the top of the 10th inning, ended a stunning monthlong run
that included more drama and spectacle than many full seasons:
</P>
<P>
   The despair of nearly missing the playoffs, the manager
suggesting he could be fired and later saying that some of his
players weren't terribly smart, and finally the exultation of
staving off elimination again and again, until _ after an epic
15-inning victory at Shea Stadium last weekend _ it seemed as if
the Mets had captured destiny and clutched it close to them.
</P>
<P>
   But after this draining game, Valentine looked crestfallen and,
when asked on television whether he expected to be back next
season, the manager, who has had speculation about his job security
and his desire to return swirling around him for weeks, responded,
``This is my life, obviously.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Valentine added: ``I think that stuff is silly. I love
the game of baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets had written an enthralling story line for much of the
second half of the season, but this, like Game 5, became a battle
of attrition and weariness. And it finally caught up with an
otherwise extraordinarily resilient team. As they did in Game 5,
the Mets used almost every pitcher available as the game dragged on
and the lead went back and forth.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets had come all the way back from their first-inning hole,
to tie the game, 7-7, in the seventh and then took a one-run lead
in the eighth. But reliever John Franco yielded a single to Brian
Hunter in the bottom of the eighth that scored Otis Nixon to tie
the game again.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets again took the lead, 9-8, in the top of the 10th when
Todd Pratt, the backup catcher, hit a sacrifice fly that scored
Benny Agbayani; the Mets were two outs from forcing a decisive
seventh game in the series. But in the bottom of the 10th, the
Mets' closer, Armando Benitez, gave up a pinch-hit single to Ozzie
Guillen that scored Andruw Jones to tie the score yet again, 9-9.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets could not score in the top of the 11th, but with Rogers
pitching in the bottom half of the inning, the game unraveled.
Gerald Williams led off with a double and he moved to third on a
sacrifice bunt by Bret Boone.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets intentionally walked Chipper Jones and then, after
throwing two balls to Brian Jordan on pitchouts to try to catch
Jones running, they intentionally walked Jordan, too, to load the
bases. Andruw Jones worked the count to three and two and finally,
4 hours 25 minutes after the game began, Rogers threw the fourth
ball to end the season.
</P>
<P>
   Center fielder Darryl Hamilton crouched for several minutes in
the field and several members of the Mets remained leaning on the
dugout railing, watching the Braves engulf Williams at home plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to take some time in the winter to watch these
games, and try to enjoy them,'' Valentine said. ``I told my guys
after the game that it might be a shorter winter or a longer winter
for them but I think they played like champions. They should feel
like champions. It's very difficult to come back from five runs and
have a couple of leads. It's difficult to give it up, but we gave
everything we had.''
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Braves Manager Bobby Cox said he thought the
Braves had a chance to blow open the game in the first inning, when
Al Leiter, the ace whose complete-game, two-hit shutout against
Cincinnati in a one-game playoff launched the Mets into the
playoffs, simply had had enough. Pitching on just three days of
rest for only the second time in his career, Leiter seemed as
tattered as a worn coat as soon as he took the mound in the first
inning.
</P>
<P>
   He had hoped that the adrenaline would carry him, but the last
time he'd tried this was five years ago and near the start of the
season, and Valentine had hesitated to bring Leiter back on short
rest for the last game of the regular season against Pittsburgh,
explaining then that Leiter preferred extra rest if possible. With
the season on the line Tuesday night, though, and all but one other
starter employed in the desperate parade from the bullpen that
ultimately won Game 5, Valentine went with his ace, unsure of what
to expect.
</P>
<P>
   Whether he was, in fact, overly charged up or simply so out of
gas that no amount of mental fuel could make up the difference,
Leiter had no command of his pitches, sending them swerving in all
directions.
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Mike Piazza looked like an aerobics instructor,
stretching up and down and side to side to retrieve Leiter's
offerings. He bounced his second pitch of the game in the dirt and
on his third pitch smacked the Braves' leadoff hitter, Gerald
Williams, in the foot. He walked the next batter, Bret Boone.
</P>
<P>
   Six of Leiter's first eight pitches were balls. On his first
pitch to the dangerous Chipper Jones _ another ball _the Braves
executed a double steal, sending Williams scurrying to third.
</P>
<P>
   When Piazza gunned the ball to third, it skittered instead
toward the Mets' dugout and Williams scored the first run of the
game.
</P>
<P>
   On the next pitch _ Leiter's tenth _ he hit Jones near the knee.
Brian Jordan, the fourth batter in th lineup, sent a grounder into
the gap between third and shortstop to score Boone and give the
Braves a 2-0 lead with, still, none out. And single to left field
by Eddie Perez scored two more and after 25 pitches, Leiter was
gone and his slow walk to the dugout, with head hung, was a study
in distress. As he reached for his jacket, he rubbed his head with
his hands but he would watch as reliever Pat Mahomes gave up a
sacrifice fly to Brian Hunter to lengthen the lead to 5-0.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last few weeks, the Mets have resembled a creature
from a horror movie that, with the doomsday music swelling, rises
from the muck again and again. They nearly became the Braves' own
personal nightmare in a sixth inning that conjured thoughts that
perhaps the Mets had at least one more astonishing comeback
remaining in them. Braves starter Kevin Millwood was going on extra
rest, five days, since he allowed the Mets three runs in seven and
a third innings in Game 2. But by the sixth inning tonight, he,
too, began to look weary.
</P>
<P>
   Edgardo Alfonzo led off with a double and moved to third on a
John Olerud single. A sacrifice fly by Piazza scored Alfonzo and
Robin Ventura doubled to right field to move Olerud to third.
</P>
<P>
   Both of them scored when Darryl Hamilton hit a single up the
middle to close the Braves lead to 5-3 and send Millwood to the
shower.
</P>
<P>
   Reliever Terry Mulholland walked pinch-hitter Benny Agbayani to
extend the rally. But Rey Ordonez lined into a double play to end
that threat. The Braves would add two runs, but the Mets tied the
game with a four-run seventh inning, capped by Mike Piazza's
two-run home run. They took the lead in the eighth inning when
Melvin Mora, the rookie Wunderkind pinch-hitting for reliever Orel
Hershiser, singled to score Benny Agbayani.
</P>
<P>
   But the Braves tied the score in the bottom of the inning, when
Brian Hunter stroked a single to center off John Franco that scored
Otis Nixon to send the game into extra innings.  &QL;

industry has sprung up to help. By Thomas Vinciguerra.

 NEWS ANALYSIS: MUCH TALK, LITTLE ACTION FROM 106TH CONGRESS  &HT;     By MARC SANDALOW 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate's defeat of campaign finance reform
Tuesday adds to Washington's impressive record of taking on the
tough issues _ and then relegating them to a legislative trash
heap.
</P>
<P>
   On matters ranging from gun control and tax cuts to health care
and campaign finances, the 106th Congress has established a clear
pattern of gridlock.
</P>
<P>
   After hours of quarrelsome debate, backroom deal-making and
roll-call votes, Congress either sends proposals into a legislative
limbo or forwards them to the president for his veto.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's the product of Democratic stubbornness, right-wing
extremism or the GOP's narrow margin in the House, Washington has
become a far better showcase for grandstanding and polemics than a
forum for enacting laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``This Congress has a rendezvous with obscurity,'' said Jack
Pitney, a professor of government at Claremont McKenna College in
Los Angeles and the author of several books on Congress. ``Each
side is just strong enough to score points on the other, but not
strong enough to get its agenda into the law books.''
</P>
<P>
   The past few days provide a perfect illustration of how
Washington operates under an ideologically divided government.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, the long-anticipated debate over reforming
campaign finance laws generated scores of floor speeches, news
conferences and editorials. But after four days of debate, the bill
offered by Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Russell Feingold,
D-Wis., failed to muster enough votes to overcome a filibuster.
</P>
<P>
   In the House, Democrats brought in 350 kids from around the
country to participate in a conference on violence aimed at
embarrassing Republicans into taking action on dormant gun control
measures. As Democratic press secretaries tried to generate
publicity, Republicans largely ignored the event.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, congressional leaders and President Clinton met at
the White House late yesterday in a struggle to fulfill even their
most basic duty _ enacting a budget for the fiscal year that began
three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talk a lot about different issues _ but none of it is
focused solving any problems,'' said Rep. Mike Thompson, D-Calif.,
who came to Congress this year. ``When someone takes to the floor
to talk about an amendment or a bill, they often cast it in a way
that is designed to win over a group of people, not to pass
legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitney said the 106th Congress, which is less than halfway
through its two-year session, ``may not be the least (productive)
in history, (but) it certainly is going to be toward the bottom of
the list.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that inaction is necessarily bad. The stalemate over how to
spend the projected $1 billion surplus prevented Republicans from
providing tax cuts and Democrats from spending money on social
programs and Medicare. As a result, the money will stay in the
treasury, which many economists believe is the soundest policy.
</P>
<P>
   On guns, while many pockets of the country are outraged by the
lack of new restrictions, gun supporters like Majority Whip Tom
DeLay, R-Texas, have insisted that killing gun control measures is
exactly the right thing to do.
</P>
<P>
   And Tuesday night, after his filibuster successfully thwarted
campaign finance reform, Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., boasted that
his parliamentary maneuvers had done ``the country a favor.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans protest that they have done their share. A major
reorganization of the Department of Energy was recently signed into
law, as were laws sending education dollars back to the states and
limiting liability for Y2K problems.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, there is a widespread feeling that much of
Washington is on hold until next year's elections for control of
the White House and Congress have been settled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most members feel this has been a wasted year,'' said veteran
Rep. Robert Matsui, D-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The legislative gridlock is in part the result of the
Republicans' precarious 10-seat majority in the House, the
narrowest majority since the first two years of the Eisenhower
administration nearly half a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, with the help of a few moderate Republicans, have
been able to put forward measures such as HMO reform, campaign
finance and the minimum wage, which most Republicans would just
assume  &LR; as soon not place on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., who took
over from Newt Gingrich less than a year ago, has been unwilling or
unable to rein in the more conservative members of his own  &LR; party
who have sought to block such legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had he been speaker for five years, I think he'd be in a
better position to walk away from the far right of his party,''
Matsui said. ``He isn't solidified yet as the speaker.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans point their finger at the White House, where Clinton
last month vetoed the most sweeping tax cut bill to pass Congress
in nearly two decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps there's evidence of a do-nothing White House,'' said
Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of who is at fault, most observers agree the inaction
is likely to most hurt Republicans next year at the polls _ a
belief that some believe may pressure them into acting on
now-dormant legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, a dramatic switch in control of Congress and the
White House in next year's election holds the possibility of
producing more gridlock.
</P>
<P>
   If Democrats win control of the House, they will also govern
with a tiny margin. If GOP front-runner George W. Bush wins the
White House, it could be a very similar situation to today, just in
reverse. ``We have a period of instability now, and it probably
will go on for some time,'' Matsui said. ``And when you have
instability, it's hard to get things done.'' &QL;

 NASA CHIEF ENVISIONS BOLD NEW AGE FOR CIVILIAN AVIATION  &HT;     By DAVID PERLMAN 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURLINGAME, Calif. _ NASA director Daniel S. Goldin, whose
agency most often aims at distant planets, focused Tuesday on the
more down-to-earth problems of airplanes that must carry growing
multitudes through ever-more congested skies and airports.
</P>
<P>
   Goldin, who spoke to a meeting of the World Aviation Congress in
this San Francisco suburb, envisions a new era when civilian planes
will be equipped with ``virtual cockpits'' and will fly at
altitudes of 80,000 feet and at speeds far above supersonic.
</P>
<P>
   Some day, he said, airline passengers will disembark at
``rent-a-jet'' facilities at major airports. There, they will board
_ and fly themselves _ small, sleek, personal craft to unmanned
``smart'' local airports, where instruments equipped with ``neural
networks'' that mimic the circuitry of the human brain will control
safe landings regardless of weather.
</P>
<P>
   Goldin's motto of ``faster, better, cheaper'' space exploration
has cut the cost of unmanned missions to the moon and the planets
tenfold, and he told his audience of aircraft engineers that they
can do the same as they build new generations of planes and
airports.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that airlines in America have already carried 680
million passengers this year _ a number that will increase to 1
billion early in the coming decade and reach 11/2 billion by 2020.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are crowding our airways, our airports and our world,'' he
said. ``We want to travel _ to any place, at any time, from
anywhere. But we demand it be done safely, conveniently and
economically _ without adversely affecting the environment in our
neighborhoods.''
</P>
<P>
   At NASA's research centers, Goldin said, his engineers are
already seeking a ``revolution'' in technology that will enable
both large and small aircraft to fly at many times the speed of
sound.
</P>
<P>
   The agency, he said, is now developing ``artificial vision'' for
pilots, with advanced sensors capable of detecting turbulence,
storm cells and wind shear conditions far in the distance.
Satellite networks will provide pilots with constant and accurate
information on the aircraft's position, and digital processing will
provide ``perfectly clear 3-D picture of terrain, obstacles, runway
and traffic.''
</P>
<P>
   As for aircraft today, Goldin said, ``The reality is that we are
pushing against the limits of existing technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldin described work at NASA's Dryden Flight Research Center in
the Mojave desert, where a new prototype aircraft called Helios is
now undergoing flight tests. It is remotely controlled from the
ground and can fly at 80,000 feet, ``making it independent of
weather and other potential threats,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And aircraft like Helios, Goldin said, could be deployed above
disaster areas as a cellular telephone relay center for rescue
workers. In longer high-altitude flights, planes like Helios could
serve as monitors of environmental conditions and be used to patrol
borders and to conduct surveillance of drug trafficking, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a few decades _ with aggressive, visionary and bold
investments _ we could put together all the technical achievements
in safety, noise, emissions, capacity, cost and revolutionary
designs, Goldin said.
</P>

   TOKYO _ The drastic restructuring Nissan Motor Co.'s executives
announced on Oct. 18 is aimed to eliminate excess production
capacity and focus its financial and personnel resources on its
main business: making cars.
</P>
<P>
   The program, called the Nissan Revival Plan in the presentation
by Carlos Ghosn, Nissan's chief operating officer, will close five
domestic factories and will sell off non-automotive sectors such as
its ship- and aerospace-related businesses.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the executives said, Nissan will be able to
eliminate 21,000 jobs and trim its operating costs by 1 trillion
yen ($9.5 billion).
</P>
<P>
   Three auto assembly plants are to be closed by March 2001 and
the other two plants, which make engines, will be closed by March
2002.
</P>
<P>
   They include three automobile assembly plants, the Murayama
plant in Musashi-Murayama, Tokyo; Kyoto plant in Uji, Kyoto, and
the Minato plant in Nagoya, and an engine plant at Kurihama, in
Yokosuka, Kanagawa Prefecture, and an engine plant at its Kyushu
facilities in Kanda, Fukuoka Prefecture.
</P>
<P>
   The Kyoto plant is operated by Nissan Shatai Corp., a Nissan
affiliate, and the Minato plant is operated by Aichi Machine
Industry Co., another affiliate.
</P>
<P>
   The closings will reduce the number of automobile assembly
plants in Japan to four, from seven.
</P>
<P>
   Those that remain are the Tochigi plant in Kaminokawa, Tochigi
Prefecture; Oppama plant in Yokosuka, Kanagawa Prefecture; the
Kyushu plant; and the Shonan plant in Hiratsuka, Kanagawa
Prefecture. The Shonan plant is also operated by Nissan Shatai.
</P>
<P>
   In the three car assembly plants to be closed, however, some
small-scale production activity will be retained, including a
microbus production line at the Kyoto plant. Some parts
manufacturing and body panel presses will be retained at the
Murayama and Minato plants, the executives said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the properties involved in the plant closings will be
sold, they said.
</P>
<P>
   The plant closings will bring the work force at Nissan and
affiliated companies to about 127,000, a reduction of about 21,000,
or 14 percent of its current work force of 148,000.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 21,000, 4,000 jobs will be cut in the manufacturing
sector while 6,500 will be reduced by the integration of sales
agents and other marketing-related sectors, with 6,000
administrative job cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Five thousand jobs will be eliminated through selling off Nissan
businesses not involved in automobile activities. Those businesses
include forklift manufacture, ship-related projects and production
of rockets for the Defense Agency.
</P>
<P>
   The executives said the dramatic restructuring will trim 1
trillion yen from Nissan's operating costs by fiscal 2002, and will
bring down the debt on which it pays interest to about 700 billion
yen, from 1.4 trillion yen now.
</P>
<P>
   Katsuhiko Hagiwara, chairman of the Nissan labor union,
responding to the announcement, said, ``There are no other ways
except to deal with our management realistically.'' &QL;

   CALCUTTA _ It was coincidence that as India anointed another
democratically elected prime minister, Pakistan succumbed once more
to military adventurism.
</P>
<P>
   But some of the conditions behind the contrasting events are
similar enough to restrain any tendency to gloat in New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
   The Westminster system of parliamentary democracy works in
India, albeit creakily, and not only for a ruling elite. People
have faith in it, and that matters almost as much as what it
actually delivers.
</P>
<P>
   Democracy, Indian-style, allows the pressing and often
conflicting urges of a highly complex society to be expressed
through the electoral process.
</P>
<P>
   But poverty _ the one issue that should be central to all public
activity _ did not feature anywhere in the recent election
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Such mundane concerns last impinged on Indian leaders in the
1998 election when furor over the soaring price of onions confirmed
the high tolerance level of people who feared that the only
flavoring for their poor diet would become unaffordable.
</P>
<P>
   India's constitution lists several lofty fundamental rights and
a high-sounding set of directive principles that outline the
rudimentary needs of civilized society.
</P>
<P>
   Jawaharlal Nehru, the first prime minister, used to claim
inspiringly that there were no orphans because Mother India was the
universal parent.
</P>
<P>
   It is unfashionable now even to dwell on things like jobs,
potable water, elementary health care, housing, schools or birth
control. Personality looms above parties and programs.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it would still be inconceivable for an Indian equivalent of
Pakistan's opposition Grand Democratic Alliance to clamor for the
army to overthrow an elected leader.
</P>
<P>
   Nor would any self-respecting Indian politician emulate Benazir
Bhutto, the former prime minister who lost no time in courting the
coup leader, General Pervez Musharraf _ ``a courageous and bold
professional, committed to civilian order,'' of whom she claims
always to have had ``a good opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   Oct. 12 is not the day that democracy died, Ms. Bhutto says,
``but rather the day it began to be reborn.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps she hopes that the general will do to Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif what General Mohammed Zia ul-Haq did to her father _
execute him _ so that she and her family fortune (much of which was
amassed in power, according to critics) can go home safely.
</P>
<P>
   Karachi greeted the coup with jubilation partly because the city
is dominated by people who, like General Musharraf's family,
migrated from India, but mainly because Pakistanis accept a
military solution to civilian problems.
</P>
<P>
   Security is New Delhi's primary concern. Pakistan's troop
pullback from India's borders is being treated warily by the Indian
government and armed forces, who have a history of rivalry and
tension with Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   But joy in India over last year's nuclear explosions was
short-lived because Indians felt that daily necessities mattered
more than the deterrent of mutually assured destruction.
</P>
<P>
   However gratifying Pakistan's plight might seem to Indians,
their own massive electoral upheaval might prove to be another
exercise in futility unless Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee
fulfills grassroots expectations. Sharif fell for failing to do so,
as did the late Indian leader Indira Gandhi in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   Retribution strikes differently in each case, but strike it
does. Democracy, like patriotism, is not enough. &QL;

   MINSK, Belarus _ When I went down to breakfast in my hotel one
day last week, the maitre d' greeted me in good English and asked,
``How are you?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Fine,'' I said, though I had slept with my clothes on because
my room was so cold, and the heat had not yet been turned on. ``How
are you?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not good,'' he whispered, looking around to make sure that no
was listening. ``Things are very bad in this country,'' he said.
``Very bad.''
</P>
<P>
   And, he might have added, they are getting worse by the day in
this former Soviet republic, which is ruled by President Alexander
Lukashenko, a Stalinist thug who is recreating a totalitarian
police state in the geographical center of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   In more than 30 years in journalism, I have been around the
world, and I have visited many countries, in Africa and elsewhere,
with unspeakably poor living conditions, repressive governments and
little hope.
</P>
<P>
   But I have never been so moved as by the situation in Belarus,
whose 10 million people had thought in 1991 that they were finally
free after 70 years of domination from Moscow, punctuated by the
brutal and murderous rule of the Nazis during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Last week in Minsk, some people wore buttons promoting an
anti-Lukashenko ``Freedom March'' on Sunday, and they furtively
passed around a small handbill with a caricature blending
Lukashenko and Hitler and the urgent plea, ``Stop Luka.''
</P>
<P>
   Of all the 15 new countries formed by the collapse of the Soviet
Union eight years ago Belarus is in the direst political and
economic straits. Violations of human rights are becoming more
serious and more alarming.
</P>
<P>
   Four of Lukashenko's toughest opponents have disappeared off the
street in the last few months, and three weeks ago, the government
closed nine outspoken independent newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   The government insists that freedom of the press exists, but
there is continuing harassment of newspapers not controlled by the
state and of companies that advertise in them.
</P>
<P>
   There are not many private companies to begin with, as
Lukashenko has imposed a top-down, Soviet-style economy. Protesters
have been beaten up, and so have the journalists who were covering
their demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lukashenko wants to destroy all of the institutions of civil
society,'' a newspaper editor told me.
</P>
<P>
   Coming to Belarus is like going through a time warp to the old
Soviet Union. The state is omnipresent and controlling. In the best
hotels, where foreigners stay, policemen stand by the elevators in
the lobby, watching who gets on and off.
</P>
<P>
   The Belarus ruble is suffering hyperinflation that is making it
virtually worthless. The average income in Belarus has fallen to
$30 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Food shortages are widespread and common, but Lukashenko tells
the people that the shortages are the result of their eating too
much.
</P>
<P>
   The official exchange rate, which was 50,000 rubles to the
dollar less than a year ago, was 330,000 to the dollar last week.
But the unofficial, black market rate was 540,000 to the dollar
Oct. 11 and had fallen to 600,000 to the dollar by Saturday. My
hotel bill for a week was 204 million rubles.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, the people of Belarus look with envy and dismay at
their neighbors who have embraced liberal democracy and a
free-market economy and are doing well.
</P>
<P>
   Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania, about 160 kilometers (100
miles) away, is a thriving, vibrant city in stark contrast to the
gray and tired Minsk, which was almost completely destroyed during
World War II and was then rebuilt in grand Soviet style, with wide
boulevards and massive, hulking, nondescript buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why are our people living as they are when their neighbors are
doing so much better?'' asked a prominent journalist.
</P>
<P>
   Lukashenko, 45, who had been a Communist functionary during what
is called ``the Soviet time,'' became Belarus's first elected
president in 1994. His five-year term would have ended last July.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1996, after a rigged referendum, he disbanded the elected
Parliament and declared that his term of office would start on that
date, thereby giving himself an extra two years by fiat. Now he
seeks to reunite with Russia, and he dreams of becoming head of the
combined union.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday morning, the militia were out in force throughout the
city. When thousands of people began their march, the militia
clashed with them, and dozens were injured.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's getting worse,'' the journalist said. ``People are
beginning to disappear. Newspapers are being shut down. The economy
is in shambles. The president is illegitimate.'' &QL;

 By MARSHALL I. GOLDMAN  
 c.1999 International Herald Tribune

<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Every day there are new revelations and now
even indictments stemming from the avalanche of hot Russian money
passing through the Bank of New York on its way to a myriad of
other U.S., European and offshore banks.
</P>
<P>
   Yet almost no responsible officials in the U.S. and Russian
governments, nor those in international lending organizations, will
admit publicly that their funds or foreign aid have been misused.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, there may have been a failure to report the sudden
influx of a few billion dollars now and then, but otherwise, as
Strobe Talbott, the deputy secretary of state, put it in a slightly
different context, ``Calm down world.''
</P>
<P>
   Without doubt a substantial portion of the $7.5 billion that was
filtered through Benex, a Potemkin-like office set up in 1996 by a
Russian emigre in Queens, N.Y., was not criminally derived money.
Much of it was from Russian and foreign businessmen seeking to
evade Russian taxes. That is unethical but not criminal.
</P>
<P>
   But some of this money did come from corporate theft, organized
crime and government kickbacks as well as from misuse of U.S.
foreign aid, World Bank support and IMF loans.
</P>
<P>
   Ask a sophisticated Western investor like BP Amoco, which may
never again see the $571 million it invested in Sidanco, a once
well regarded Russian oil company.
</P>
<P>
   Or ask the Dart Group, which is struggling to retain its
investment in Yukos, another oil company. Or Kohlberg Kravis
Roberts &AMP; Company and the United States-Russia Investment Fund,
which has just discovered that their investment in the Lomonosov
porcelain factory has been nationalized to keep them from taking
control.
</P>
<P>
   Alternatively, ask Boris Yeltsin's son-in-law how he happened to
end up with $2.7 million in that same Bank of New York, not to
mention the other son-in-law's accounts in various Swiss banks.
</P>
<P>
   To be even more specific, Russian economists have complained
that in 1993, U.S. food aid was diverted and then re-exported,
which was contrary to the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Roskhleboproduct, the Russian agency chosen to distribute the
grain in Russia, profited at the expense of the intended
recipients. Yet the same firm was selected to process the U.S. food
aid provided last year.
</P>
<P>
   This is just one example of misappropriated foreign aid. Even
former Prime Minister Sergei Stepashin has complained that ``30
percent of &QL; 
our humanitarian aid is invariably stolen.''
</P>
<P>
   What about loans from the World Bank? A few weeks ago the
president of the World Bank asserted that there was no evidence
that its loans to Russia had been misused.
</P>
<P>
   This came as a surprise to several economists in and outside the
World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   They pointed specifically to money lent by the World Bank to
restructure and close many of Russia's obsolete coal mines.
According to the audit committee of the Russian Duma, the $600
million loan provided in 1996 for the coal mines seems to have
disappeared with little evident restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the loans from the International Monetary Fund.
It has acknowledged that there have been some problems.
</P>
<P>
   For example, it has complained that the Russian central bank
diverted some of the country's reserves to an offshore account that
the bank had set up to avoid scrutiny and seizure.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the IMF has charged that the Russian central bank
deliberately lied to the IMF by reporting that those funds were
still in Moscow, whereas they were actually in a controlled account
in the Channel Islands.
</P>
<P>
   But what IMF officials have not addressed is the claim that
senior central bank personnel took those funds and invested them in
high-yielding government securities back in Russia and kept the
proceeds for their personal use.
</P>
<P>
   The central bank also has a long history of taking dollars
borrowed from the IMF. Instead of selling them all at auction to
prop up the ruble, as it is supposed to do, it sets aside a
substantial portion at a lower rate for a few selected banks owned
by a few favored oligarchs.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, these transfers have a habit of taking place
immediately before a sharp devaluation of the ruble. Many of those
dollars then quickly find their way back to the West, if not
through the Bank of New York then through other Western banks.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the way money flows and deals are made and unmade, it
is difficult to document most forms of corporate and government
theft in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   True, government officials in Russia are not the only ones in
the world who enter government service poor and exit as
multimillionaires or CEOs of their country's wealthiest utilities.
</P>
<P>
   Yet failure to penalize those Russian officials, institutions
and businessmen who have taken advantage of loose procedures,
including those who have stolen from the West, only perpetuates
such practices.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder so many Russians laugh at the naivete or seeming
obtuseness of Western officials, both private and governmental, who
seem to blind themselves to obvious examples of malfeasance.
</P>
<P>
   To say ``no'' to Russia now and then does not mean that we want
to cut Russia off from the world and force it to resume a hostile
arms buildup. After all, there are responsible voices in Russia,
including the former minister of finance, Boris Fyodorov, who have
urged the IMF to stop lending money to Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is Russia unable to repay such loans, Fyodorov warns,
but continued borrowing only nourishes destructive habits.
</P>
<P>
   Call it tough love. The time has come for policymakers to ask
themselves whether saying ``no'' occasionally might not facilitate
the reforms they seek more effectively than always saying ``yes.'' &QL;

porcelain factory has been nationalized to keep them from taking
control.
</P>
<P>
   Alternatively, ask Boris Yeltsin's son-in-law how he happened to
end up with $2.7 million in that same Bank of New York, not to
mention the other son-in-law's accounts in various Swiss banks.
</P>
<P>
   To be even more specific, Russian economists have complained
that in 1993, U.S. food aid was diverted and then re-exported,
which was contrary to the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Roskhleboproduct, the Russian agency chosen to distribute the
grain in Russia, profited at the expense of the intended
recipients. Yet the same firm was selected to process the U.S. food
aid provided last year.
</P>
<P>
   This is just one example of misappropriated foreign aid. Even
former Prime Minister Sergei Stepashin has complained that ``30
percent of &QL; 
our humanitarian aid is invariably stolen.''
</P>
<P>
   What about loans from the World Bank? A few weeks ago the
president of the World Bank asserted that there was no evidence
that its loans to Russia had been misused.
</P>
<P>
   This came as a surprise to several economists in and outside the
World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   They pointed specifically to money lent by the World Bank to
restructure and close many of Russia's obsolete coal mines.
According to the audit committee of the Russian Duma, the $600
million loan provided in 1996 for the coal mines seems to have
disappeared with little evident restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the loans from the International Monetary Fund.
It has acknowledged that there have been some problems.
</P>
<P>
   For example, it has complained that the Russian central bank
diverted some of the country's reserves to an offshore account that
the bank had set up to avoid scrutiny and seizure.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the IMF has charged that the Russian central bank
deliberately lied to the IMF by reporting that those funds were
still in Moscow, whereas they were actually in a controlled account
in the Channel Islands.
</P>
<P>
   But what IMF officials have not addressed is the claim that
senior central bank personnel took those funds and invested them in
high-yielding government securities back in Russia and kept the
proceeds for their personal use.
</P>
<P>
   The central bank also has a long history of taking dollars
borrowed from the IMF. Instead of selling them all at auction to
prop up the ruble, as it is supposed to do, it sets aside a
substantial portion at a lower rate for a few selected banks owned
by a few favored oligarchs.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, these transfers have a habit of taking place
immediately before a sharp devaluation of the ruble. Many of those
dollars then quickly find their way back to the West, if not
through the Bank of New York then through other Western banks.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the way money flows and deals are made and unmade, it
is difficult to document most forms of corporate and government
theft in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   True, government officials in Russia are not the only ones in
the world who enter government service poor and exit as
multimillionaires or CEOs of their country's wealthiest utilities.
</P>
<P>
   Yet failure to penalize those Russian officials, institutions
and businessmen who have taken advantage of loose procedures,
including those who have stolen from the West, only perpetuates
such practices.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder so many Russians laugh at the naivete or seeming
obtuseness of Western officials, both private and governmental, who
seem to blind themselves to obvious examples of malfeasance.
</P>
<P>
   To say ``no'' to Russia now and then does not mean that we want
to cut Russia off from the world and force it to resume a hostile
arms buildup. After all, there are responsible voices in Russia,
including the former minister of finance, Boris Fyodorov, who have
urged the IMF to stop lending money to Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is Russia unable to repay such loans, Fyodorov warns,
but continued borrowing only nourishes destructive habits.
</P>
<P>
   Call it tough love. The time has come for policymakers to ask
themselves whether saying ``no'' occasionally might not facilitate
the reforms they seek more effectively than always saying ``yes.'' &QL;

   SHENZHEN, China _ Although billed as a showcase for cutting-edge
technology, some of the most intriguing business plans being thrust
toward visitors at the Shenzhen High Tech Fair earlier this month
were adaptations of existing technology to unique niches in China's
vast consumer market.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Internet music may not yet be mainstream _ in China
or anywhere else _ but Shen Kum-tu is convinced his handheld MP3
player could quickly attract the millions of English-learners in
China.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most MP3 devices, which can only play music downloaded
from the Internet, the machine Shen is developing will also allow
simultaneous recording from a built-in microphone. His device will
also be designed to jump easily between tracks.
</P>
<P>
   These features aim the product at the already thriving market
for recorded language lessons in China.
</P>
<P>
   With his hand-held MP3 device, priced at 800 yuan ($97), English
students across China will be able to download CD-quality English
lessons featuring the latest in slang expressions and listen to
themselves in their own speaking accent.
</P>
<P>
   For now, however, Shen and his company, Shenzhen Xinronghao
Industrial Co., are looking for a 20 million yuan investment to get
the device off the drawing board.
</P>
<P>
   In another area, one software developer said she believed she
had finally cracked the code on devising keystrokes for the
thousands of Chinese characters that have long restricted the
vocabulary available for Chinese-language documents written on
computers.
</P>
<P>
   Based on a half-century of research by her father, an eminent
lexicographer, Zheng Long's company has created a computer input
system capable of writing 100,000 characters, more than triple the
standard computer vocabulary.
</P>
<P>
   While many of the characters are esoteric terms rarely needed
for everyday use, they are essential for traditional Chinese
medicine and to accurately write Chinese names. Long said these two
uses alone could open lucrative markets for her father's lifelong
academic pursuit.
</P>
<P>
   Long also plans to tap the market for traditional Chinese
medicine by setting up the only Internet site on which discussions
using completely accurate characters for traditional herbal
remedies can take place.
</P>
<P>
   Another company, Join Hands Century Technology Corp., is trying
to combat rampant product piracy in China with an anti-fraud
network.
</P>
<P>
   Infrared scanners linked nationwide by Internet will alert
manufacturers, suppliers, retailers and law-enforcement officials
when any member of the network inspects a product bearing a
fraudulent Join Hands label.
</P>
<P>
   Cash-strapped Chinese pager companies looking for gimmicks to
keep customers from migrating to mobile phones may find hope in a
new voice pager system now offered by Zhengzhou Aomei Electronic
Co.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which says it recently completed an operational
trial with 20,000 subscribers in Henan Province, claims several
advantages over competing Japanese products.
</P>
<P>
   Not only does Aomei's domestic manufacturing keep the price down
to 680 yuan a unit, but pager companies can upgrade their systems
without replacing the entire network.
</P>
<P>
   ``By only requiring an upgrade, we hope to attract companies in
China that cannot afford to fully change their network,'' said Zhu
Su-sheng, inventor of the system. &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ How many Americans live overseas? The U.S. State
Department estimates 3 million. Other estimates double and triple
this number. There is no reliable estimate.
</P>
<P>
   Why, then, does not the Census Bureau count overseas Americans?
After all, many of them pay taxes and vote in U.S. elections.
Surely they can be counted?
</P>
<P>
   They cannot be easily counted for the simple reason that there
is no ``comprehensive control file'' of Americans living abroad.
This technical term refers to what the Census Bureau uses to
identify persons who do not cooperate with the census and thus must
be tracked down if the census, as it must, is to approach a
complete count.
</P>
<P>
   In the stateside census, the control file is a listing of about
120 million household addresses that has been painstakingly
constructed by labor-intensive, expensive operations.
</P>
<P>
   Next March, the Census 2000 effort will mail or deliver a census
questionnaire to each of these addresses.
</P>
<P>
   We expect that 60 to 65 percent of the households will mail the
form in. The others are then sought out in a vast effort known as
nonresponse follow-up, an effort to raise the response rate to as
near 100 percent as feasible.
</P>
<P>
   No analogous control file exists for Americans abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Concerned citizens living abroad have suggested that the Census
Bureau might make forms available through embassies or employers.
But this is to suggest a voluntary census. There would be no
practical way to locate the unknown number who never heard about or
ignored the census appeal. That is, there is no way to mount a
nonresponse follow-up.
</P>
<P>
   But is not a partial count better than no count at all? Not
necessarily. In the absence of the follow-up designed to reach
every possible respondent, the count would be biased and would not
withstand the inevitable legal challenge.
</P>
<P>
   The constitutional purpose of the decennial census is to provide
state-by-state population totals that are used to reapportion 435
seats in the House of Representatives among the 50 states. Any
counting procedure that might disadvantage a given state would be
biased.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to imagine scenarios that could advantage or
disadvantage particular states.
</P>
<P>
   Assume that it is comparatively difficult to count Americans
living in Canada, who are not required to have passports, seldom
register with the embassy and are often retired.
</P>
<P>
   Then assume that it is comparatively easier to count Americans
in Saudi Arabia, who must carry passports and who often work for
U.S. firms and pay U.S. taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Assume further that many of the Americans retired to Canada
moved from northern border states such as Maine or Washington,
while many who work in Saudi Arabia are from oil-producing states
such as Texas or Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau does not know a priority if it would be harder
to count Americans living in Canada than in Saudi Arabia. Nor can
we be certain that there is a correlation between (1) living in an
easier-to-count world region and (2) home state in the United
States. But these are plausible assumptions.
</P>
<P>
   It is obvious that a census of Americans abroad that counted a
lower proportion in Canada than in Saudi Arabia would not be
neutral with respect to congressional reapportionment. It would
harm the northern border states but benefit the oil-producing
states.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau could not stand behind a count with a known
bias; and it is a near certainty that such a count would be
challenged in the courts.
</P>
<P>
   To devise procedures designed to find every American living
abroad poses substantial operational and statistical challenges.
These are challenges that the Census Bureau would willingly meet,
but it can do so only with congressional authorization and funding.
Moreover, it needs time to plan and test alternative procedures.
This is not a task for the next few months. &QL;

   PARIS _ The race to run UNESCO could be opening to underdog
candidates, diplomats said Tuesday, as Japan failed to muster
enough backing to push through its candidate in a second round of
voting.
</P>
<P>
   The favorite is still the Japanese candidate, Koichiro Matsuura.
On Tuesday, he fell only three votes short of the 30 needed for a
majority in the 58-nation executive board, which chooses a
director-general for the 187-nation organization.
</P>
<P>
   But the early stalemate could open the way to more reform-minded
contenders, including former Foreign Minister Gareth Evans of
Australia and Ismail Serageldin, an Egyptian architect and World
Bank vice president _ partly because UNESCO has a tradition of
consensus and would be uncomfortable with a split vote as an
outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the deadlock lasts, there's a real chance that the job can
go to an outsider determined to shake up the organization and find
a new place for it internationally,'' a European ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
   The election of a reform-minded director-general could signal a
fresh start in the next six years for UNESCO, the United Nations
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Despite an improved image in recent years, the organization has
been plagued with continuing accusations of mismanagement and lack
of focus that peaked in the mid-1980s when the United States left
UNESCO.
</P>
<P>
   A holdover from that period _ the system of choosing a new
director-general that resembled a papal enclave in its secrecy,
with officials declining even to make public the candidates' names
_ has been jettisoned.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the candidates met last week with UNESCO's executive
board. The quasi-interviews at UNESCO headquarters were monitored
from an adjoining room by diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp calls for change _ to find contemporary relevance for an
organization that seems to be drifting _ emerged from the
reform-minded candidates.
</P>
<P>
   These candidates, diplomats said, argued that UNESCO needed to
reorganize its work to meet new technological challenges in
communications and shift its priorities to help tackle educational
crises in trouble spots such as the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the diplomats said, the status quo sounded
acceptable to the two front-running candidates: Matsuura, Japan's
ambassador to France, and Ghazi Gosaibi, a poet and Saudi Arabia's
ambassador to Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Relying on strong backing from their governments, the two men
lead in the UNESCO polling, with Gosaibi winning 10 votes.
</P>
<P>
   A deal between the two front-runners could hand early victory to
Japan, but both Evans and Serageldin vowed to stay in the contest _
which could last until a final round between the two leading
contenders on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Serageldin, who was knocked back to only four votes Tuesday,
complained that governments were letting their political ties
outweigh candidates' individual merit.
</P>
<P>
   Tokyo continued lobbying in world capitals, telling governments
that the job should go to Matsuura because of the amount of
Japanese aid to UNESCO.
</P>
<P>
   Even blunter messages _ about the future of Japan's bilateral
aid _ have been reported by diplomats in some countries, especially
in French-speaking Africa and in Central America.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese government, which is a major donor to the U.N.
system, has worked consistently in recent years to promote Japanese
to prominent U.N. jobs. A U.S. ambassador in Europe said Tokyo saw
such jobs as a way of increasing Japanese influence in the world
body at a time when there was still no early prospect of Japan's
getting a permanent seat on the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately,'' a UNESCO official said, ``they've built up a
bad reputation because so many Japanese officials had trouble
making the move to an international job and proved unable to work
with foreign colleagues.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Evans, the Australian candidate, and Serageldin have
generated support among people who have worked with them in many
countries. Both have endorsements from cultural figures suggesting
that they could attract intellectual talent to a refocused UNESCO.
</P>
<P>
   Evans, 55, came to international prominence as a foreign
minister in Australia, but never let diplomacy (or his Oxford
education as a barrister) stifle his personality.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging his lack of fluent French, Evans urged French
officials to get him the UNESCO job anyway so he would be sure to
learn the language in Paris, where UNESCO is headquartered.
</P>
<P>
   Evans contends that his main qualification is his ``enthusiasm
for multi-ethnicity, which should be the galvanizing value for
UNESCO.''
</P>
<P>
   Serageldin stresses that UNESCO needs a higher profile on global
scientific issues and technological challenges. A tenet of his
campaign is restored ties with the United States because, he says,
it is ``the most revolutionary country in technology,
communications and science.''
</P>
<P>
   Serageldin has gambled on opposing Saudi Arabia, notably on
human rights, and the Saudi government has lined up most Arab
nations _ including Egypt, Seraladgin's own country _ behind
Gosaibi.
</P>
<P>
   A major issue for UNESCO _ especially in Washington _ is press
freedom. Evans told UNESCO that peace and democracy required ``an
independent, pluralistic and free press -_ free of government
control, free of monopoly and committed to the free flow of ideas
and information.'' But Matsuura has been noncommittal. &QL;

<P>
   PARIS _ The race to run UNESCO could be opening to underdog
candidates, diplomats said Tuesday, as Japan failed to muster
enough backing to push through its candidate in a second round of
voting.
</P>
<P>
   The favorite is still the Japanese candidate, Koichiro Matsuura.
On Tuesday, he fell only three votes short of the 30 needed for a
majority in the 58-nation executive board, which chooses a
director-general for the 187-nation organization.
</P>
<P>
   But the early stalemate could open the way to more reform-minded
contenders, including former Foreign Minister Gareth Evans of
Australia and Ismail Serageldin, an Egyptian architect and World
Bank vice president _ partly because UNESCO has a tradition of
consensus and would be uncomfortable with a split vote as an
outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the deadlock lasts, there's a real chance that the job can
go to an outsider determined to shake up the organization and find
a new place for it internationally,'' a European ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
   The election of a reform-minded director-general could signal a
fresh start in the next six years for UNESCO, the United Nations
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Despite an improved image in recent years, the organization has
been plagued with continuing accusations of mismanagement and lack
of focus that peaked in the mid-1980s when the United States left
UNESCO.
</P>
<P>
   A holdover from that period _ the system of choosing a new
director-general that resembled a papal enclave in its secrecy,
with officials declining even to make public the candidates' names
_ has been jettisoned.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the candidates met last week with UNESCO's executive
board. The quasi-interviews at UNESCO headquarters were monitored
from an adjoining room by diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp calls for change _ to find contemporary relevance for an
organization that seems to be drifting _ emerged from the
reform-minded candidates.
</P>
<P>
   These candidates, diplomats said, argued that UNESCO needed to
reorganize its work to meet new technological challenges in
communications and shift its priorities to help tackle educational
crises in trouble spots such as the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the diplomats said, the status quo sounded
acceptable to the two front-running candidates: Matsuura, Japan's
ambassador to France, and Ghazi Gosaibi, a poet and Saudi Arabia's
ambassador to Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Relying on strong backing from their governments, the two men
lead in the UNESCO polling, with Gosaibi winning 10 votes.
</P>
<P>
   A deal between the two front-runners could hand early victory to
Japan, but both Evans and Serageldin vowed to stay in the contest _
which could last until a final round between the two leading
contenders on Friday.

<P>
   Military coups are rarities these days, so there was something
rather nostalgic about the events in Pakistan on Oct. 12.
</P>
<P>
   Televisions went black, then martial music started up against a
background of patriotic pictures of strutting soldiers and, a few
hours later, a cross-looking man in a uniform appeared on the
screen and said that he had done it for the good of his country.
</P>
<P>
   General Pervez Musharraf, Pakistan's new military leader,
certainly has all the trappings of an old-fashioned villain; and he
was welcomed as such by condemnations and expressions of concern
from all over the world _ including from that champion of
democracy, China.
</P>
<P>
   The instinct to support democrats and condemn military coups is
correct, yet it is worth remembering that not all elected leaders
are democrats and not all generals are villains.
</P>
<P>
   It is regrettable that the army should be the instrument of
change in Pakistan, but the departure of the government of Nawaz
Sharif (after Sharif had tried to secure General Musharraf's
departure) may well bring an improvement to the country's fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   Whether in fact it turns out that way depends entirely on what
General Musharraf does now. He has the power to make his country a
better place, or to destroy it.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan has been in such a mess for so long that it is tempting
to conclude that the country is doomed. It was created in the chaos
of partition, and torn since birth between conflicting cultures.
</P>
<P>
   It has a tribal social structure, an Islamic ideology and a
legal and political system that is British in origin. Islamic and
secular law battle each other. Tribal loyalties distort the
democratic process. Shia and Sunni Muslims shoot each other on the
streets.
</P>
<P>
   From the west, Afghanistan's Taliban spill into Pakistan and
bolster the growing ranks of its fundamentalists. On the other side
of the country, the perpetual conflict with India over Kashmir
helps destabilize domestic politics.
</P>
<P>
   In response to one mess or another, the generals have ousted
politicians before, in 1958, in 1971 and in 1977. Yet, whatever the
pressures, individuals can still make a difference, and Sharif and
Benazir Bhutto, who have both had two turns in power, certainly
have done.
</P>
<P>
   Their dismal performance has demeaned democracy and may have
blown Pakistan's chances of maturing into a decently governed
country for years to come. &QL;

   Sharif is especially culpable. He came to power in 1997 with a
huge majority, and with the freedom that comes from strength. He
could have used his power for good or ill. He chose to use it
badly, in two ways.
</P>
<P>
   First, Sharif fostered corruption. It is unclear how deeply
implicated he himself was: the former chief justice, Sajjad Ali
Shah, had agreed to hear corruption charges against Sharif, but was
sacked soon afterwards.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, as most Pakistanis would agree, their country
stinks. Corruption undermines not just the polity, but the economy
as well.
</P>
<P>
   One of Pakistan's big problems is ordinary people's refusal to
pay their taxes. And one reason why ordinary people do not pay
their taxes is that they reckon the politicians will steal their
money.
</P>
<P>
   Second, Sharif used his considerable power to attack not just
his political opponents, but also the institutions essential to the
proper functioning of a democracy.
</P>
<P>
   When he got into an argument with the chief justice in 1997,
mobs from Sharif's party surrounded the Supreme Court, and Shah was
sacked.
</P>
<P>
   When the press gave Sharif trouble, he turned on it, freezing
bank accounts, confiscating newsprint and even having an editor
imprisoned without charge for a month.
</P>
<P>
   His placemen were put in to run the police, turning the
guardians of law and order into the guardians of Sharif's
interests.
</P>
<P>
   And the army _ which had seen one chief of staff sacked after
criticizing Sharif's capricious use of power _ believed that the
same was about to happen to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite all my advice,'' General Musharraf told the nation in
the small hours of Oct. 13, ``they tried to interfere with the
armed forces, the last remaining viable institution in which all of
you take so much pride and look up to at all times for stability,
unity and integrity of your beloved country.'' &QL;

<P>
   It was not just the army that had turned against Sharif. So had
the voters. In a country that takes easily to the streets, there
were no demonstrations protesting against the army's action, and a
few supporting it. In itself, however, that is not very reassuring.
</P>
<P>
   Widespread rejoicing was the initial reaction when General Zia
booted out Zulfikar Ali Bhutto in 1977. When Zia started jailing
people indiscriminately, and executed Bhutto, feelings changed. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Pakistanis now need to know what their new general intends. The
good news is that, although the army itself is a conservative and
Islamic organization, General Musharraf is not a fundamentalist: he
is, say those who know him, a westernized liberal who is alarmed by
the spread of extremist views in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is he reckoned to have political ambitions. He gave his
first broadcast to the nation, explaining his coup, in English, the
language of the elite; anybody who had been planning a political
career would have spoken in Urdu, the national language.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even unambitious westernized liberals can acquire a
dangerous taste for power. If General Musharraf is to persuade his
countrymen _ and the rest of the world _ that he has done the right
thing, he must quickly take three steps.
</P>
<P>
   First, he needs to reassure India that he plans no new
aggression. The Indian government _ and the American one, which
negotiated the peace between India and Pakistan in July _ is
concerned that Pakistan's withdrawal of troops from Kashmir was the
principal bone of contention between the army and Sharif.
</P>
<P>
   It has expressed ``grave concern'' and placed its army on high
alert along the border. Unless General Musharraf makes it clear
that he has no wish to renew the conflict, the subcontinent could
move back to the brink of war. Nowadays that could mean nuclear
war.
</P>
<P>
   Second, General Musharraf needs to make it very clear, very
soon, that he is moving Pakistan towards democracy. He needs to set
up a caretaker government that would have two main jobs: to prepare
for a new set of elections and to clear up corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Tackling corruption is the more difficult task, but it is
essential. Honesty and democracy go hand in hand. If politicians
are reasonably honest, people will support the institutions of
democracy; and if democracy works reasonably well, it will help
root out corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Lastly, General Musharraf needs to go back to his barracks and
keep quiet. If he has the sense to do that, he will go down in
history as one of the few Pakistani leaders who has done his
country a favor.
</P>
<P>
   If he tries to hold on to power, he will, in the long run, fail.
In that event, he might well bring his country down with him. &QL;

<P>
   Some people take numbers seriously. Indeed, we do. Ever since
August 1843, when our first editor promised his readers the
``statistics of the week,'' our articles have been peppered with
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   A subsequent editor, in the 1950s, coined the word numeracy, to
describe a quality he valued. But numeracy is nothing without
accuracy _ and we, like other journalists, are not infallibly
accurate.
</P>
<P>
   Wise readers, even of The Economist, should never forget that
there are lies, damned lies and statistics, and among the most
damnable are those relating to disasters, whether natural or
man-made.
</P>
<P>
   British readers may need little reminding of this. They have
just endured a week in which Britain's newspapers have revelled in
a dreadful train crash.
</P>
<P>
   The death toll rose almost minute by minute until, two days
after it had happened, ``at least 100'' were dead, according to one
tabloid, and ``it could be many more, even as high as 170.''
</P>
<P>
   The Times reckoned 70 had been killed and 100 more were missing.
No wonder, for the Sun, it was ``the worst peacetime disaster.'' We
ourselves said ``at least 70'' had died.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a week after the accident, the death toll had settled
at about 35 _ a fact that few newspapers reported in type so big
and bold as the sort they had been using a few days earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Back in April, we reported claims by the American State
Department that 100,000 people had been killed in Kosovo. We were
skeptical, but by the end of the war in June we had swallowed,
albeit with the weasel qualification of ``perhaps,'' the figure of
100,000 Kosovars dead at the hands of the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Today few authorities put the correct number above 10,000.
</P>
<P>
   A similar downsizing is going on in East Timor, where mass
killings were widely reported to have been carried out by rampaging
militias. The rampaging took place, but the reports of the deaths
were a bit like Mark Twain's: exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   A United Nations spokesman said this week, ``We've heard
horrendous stories for which there's not a shred of evidence... We
don't believe that people in their thousands have been killed and
their bodies buried or thrown in the sea.''
</P>
<P>
   In the fog of war, or of peacetime catastrophe, it is, of
course, impossible to know for certain how many people have died or
been hurt, yet readers want an estimate. So the word ``perhaps'' is
not always _ perhaps _ so weasel, after all.
</P>
<P>
   Yet journalists seldom reduce their estimates as time goes by.
The first figure _ ``as many as 100'' _ soon becomes ``about 100,''
and then ``at least 100'' and often then ``perhaps 1,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Journalists want to promote their stories, editors their papers,
aid workers their agencies. Even government officials may want to
curry sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 24, the official toll in Turkey's earthquake was an
apparently precise 17,997. A day later it had dropped to the
equally precise figure of 12,514.
</P>
<P>
   This points to some rules for journalists, such as: treat the
claims of interested parties with suspicion, make clear that the
figure you accept is just an estimate and, if you are subsequently
proved wrong, own up to it.
</P>
<P>
   But readers too should beware _ of spurious accuracy, of
manifest inflation, and of journalists' persistent tendency to
exaggerate.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the power of the press in general, when it comes to
killing people, the pen is truly mightier than the sword. &QL;

<P>
   Some people take numbers seriously. Indeed, we do. Ever since
August 1843, when our first editor promised his readers the
``statistics of the week,'' our articles have been peppered with
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   A subsequent editor, in the 1950s, coined the word numeracy, to
describe a quality he valued. But numeracy is nothing without
accuracy _ and we, like other journalists, are not infallibly
accurate.
</P>
<P>
   Wise readers, even of The Economist, should never forget that
there are lies, damned lies and statistics, and among the most
damnable are those relating to disasters, whether natural or
man-made.
</P>
<P>
   British readers may need little reminding of this. They have
just endured a week in which Britain's newspapers have revelled in
a dreadful train crash.
</P>
<P>
   The death toll rose almost minute by minute until, two days
after it had happened, ``at least 100'' were dead, according to one
tabloid, and ``it could be many more, even as high as 170.''
</P>
<P>
   The Times reckoned 70 had been killed and 100 more were missing.
No wonder, for the Sun, it was ``the worst peacetime disaster.'' We
ourselves said ``at least 70'' had died.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a week after the accident, the death toll had settled
at about 35 _ a fact that few newspapers reported in type so big
and bold as the sort they had been using a few days earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Back in April, we reported claims by the American State
Department that 100,000 people had been killed in Kosovo. We were
skeptical, but by the end of the war in June we had swallowed,
albeit with the weasel qualification of ``perhaps,'' the figure of
100,000 Kosovars dead at the hands of the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Today few authorities put the correct number above 10,000.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate's defeat of the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty is a humiliation for the Clinton administration, a pyrrhic
victory for the Senate and a disaster for America's
foreign-policymaking process.
</P>
<P>
   It humiliates the president because this was a treaty he once
described as among the most important of his presidency. Part of
his legacy is now in tatters.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, victory revealed many senators to be more
interested in their partisan fight with the president than the
consequences of their actions in the world. And foreign policy has
been damaged because it is no longer possible to trust the
president's signature even on a nuclear treaty.
</P>
<P>
   This debacle resulted, in part, from a failure to cope with the
deep differences of opinion among American policymakers over the
CTBT.
</P>
<P>
   The administration argued that the treaty would make America
safer by hampering the efforts of Russia, China and others to
produce new, more threatening nuclear weapons and by strengthening
support for the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the main
anti-proliferation effort.
</P>
<P>
   The armed services liked the test ban because it would have left
America with the most up-to-date and powerful nuclear force in the
world. The past five chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
testified in the treaty's favor.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, Richard Lugar of Indiana, one of the most
respected internationalists in the Senate, argued that the treaty
simply would not work. ``I have little confidence that the
verification and enforcement provisions will dissuade other nations
from nuclear testing.''
</P>
<P>
   Others said the treaty was pointless because it would do nothing
to stop the most dangerous nuclear states, North Korea and Iran.
</P>
<P>
   And balancing the five chiefs of staff, six former secretaries
of defense said the CTBT would damage America's ability to keep its
warheads safe.
</P>
<P>
   Warheads last around 20 years. After that, they become less
reliable. ``We would be vulnerable to the effects of ageing,'' the
grandees argued, ``because we could not test...existing warheads.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet reasonable though such reservations may sound, they played
only a background role in the treaty's death on the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   Trent Lott, the leader of the Senate, originally brought the
vote to humiliate Clinton when he realized his colleagues would not
support the treaty. He allowed just one day of hearings _ hardly
evidence of a desire to thrash out the issues.
</P>
<P>
   He was even willing to do a deal with Democrats which would (for
a political price) have postponed the vote until after 2000,
keeping the treaty alive.
</P>
<P>
   This did not happen because a small number of senators who
wanted to kill the CTBT at any cost saw their chance and refused to
go along with the postponement.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the Senate's procedural rules, they were able to
force a division. The Senate duly voted 48-51 not to ratify the
treaty, splitting largely on party lines and falling far short of
the two-thirds majority needed.
</P>
<P>
   That there had been a military coup the day before in the
world's newest nuclear power, Pakistan, mattered not a jot.
</P>
<P>
   Yet again, in the aftermath of impeachment, the minimum level of
amity needed to work the system was lacking.
</P>
<P>
   For this, Clinton was as much to blame as the Senate. He
continually demanded a vote which he knew he could not win,
gambling that the Senate would cave in.
</P>
<P>
   He did virtually nothing to lobby for the treaty between the
time he signed it, in 1996, and last weekend, when most of his
national security team fanned out to drum up support on television.
By that time it was far too late.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict was more than just partisanship as normal. Nuclear
policy has traditionally been a bipartisan matter.
</P>
<P>
   This was the first time the Senate has vetoed a nuclear treaty
(though in 1980 it forced President Carter to withdraw the second
Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty, SALT 2, after the Soviet invasion
of Afghanistan). &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (100-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 675) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Worryingly, the Senate vote is also the culmination of a pattern
of actions which point to creeping isolationism.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Clinton failed to get ``fast-track'' authority to
negotiate trade agreements. Congress at first refused to back what
Republicans dubbed ``Clinton's war'' in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Both houses voted this summer to cut the foreign-affairs budget
by 14 percent next year, which would make it impossible for America
to fulfill its commitments under the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has been refusing to pay its dues to the
United Nations for so long that it may lose its vote in the General
Assembly. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONCLUDES AT 925) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many senators no doubt had serious reservations about the
test-ban treaty. But some could not have cared less.
</P>
<P>
   The impact may not be felt immediately. The test-ban treaty
cannot enter into force anyway until 44 nuclear countries have
ratified it _ and it was nowhere near that number even before the
Senate vote.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has said America will continue to observe the moratorium
on nuclear testing. Still, it is hard to believe that a decision of
this magnitude will not have consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Before the vote, the leaders of Britain, France, and Germany
appealed to the Senate to ratify the treaty, saying failure would
show that the United States is not serious about arms control.
</P>
<P>
   American opponents of the CTBT reply that America's nuclear
policy will now rest on American interests and power, not waffly
and unenforceable treaties.
</P>
<P>
   The fallout from this particular nuclear test is already
spreading. &QL;

<P>
   George W. Bush is savoring his Sister Souljah moment.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Bill Clinton dramatized his differences with the left
wing of the Democratic Party by condemning the rap singer and black
activist who had called for the murder of whites after the Los
Angeles riots.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Bush is signalling his credentials as a man of the center
by criticizing a group of people who have about the same level of
public respect: the Republican leaders of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Who can blame him? Congress is passing through a dreadful
period. The Senate's refusal to ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty shows not just President Bill Clinton but the Republican
leaders at their worst.
</P>
<P>
   Even for opponents of the test-ban treaty, including Bush, the
manner of its rejection _ largely to inflict political humiliation
on the president rather than to defend American nuclear security _
is troubling.
</P>
<P>
   Just as much partisan bickering is on display in the House, and
this time it touches Bush more directly.
</P>
<P>
   As with the test-ban treaty, the Republicans are seeking to
embarrass the president, rather than to agree upon a fiscal policy.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, says Majority Whip Tom DeLay, is to pass a series of
tough spending bills that the president will veto. Republicans will
then seek to blame him for shutting down the federal government and
for trying to spend the huge surplus generated by the Social
Security trust fund.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that Republicans will probably get the blame, as they
did before, for shutting the government down if that happens.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that they themselves are planning to dip into the
surplus (just like every Congress since the year dot).
</P>
<P>
   And never mind that to achieve their spending cuts they are
resorting to budget gimmickry and tactics such as delaying payments
to the low-paid (an idea that earned the rebuke from Bush that the
party was ``seeking to balance the budget on the backs of the
poor'').
</P>
<P>
   This is a political game in which the aim is to blame the other
side when everything goes wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Such conflicts are becoming more and more common. They include
not only national and international matters, like the budget and
the test-ban treaty, but local concerns, such as the Senate's
controversial rejection of the appointment of Ronnie White as a
federal judge to the Missouri Supreme Court. (The decision was
connected with the local politics of the Senate race next year, and
has caused particular anger because White is the first black judge
proposed for the job.)
</P>
<P>
   All this is a reminder of how much partisan bitterness remains
in Congress after the impeachment debate.
</P>
<P>
   And you might think that the popular distaste such shenanigans
create would damage Bush, who is the front-running nominee of the
party in charge of the mess on Capitol Hill. But in many ways, it
helps him by justifying his basic appeal.
</P>
<P>
   This is not (as in Clinton's case) the idea of splitting the
difference between the two parties and attracting the mushy center.
The Texas governor remains an unapologetic conservative. Despite
his criticism of the congressional Republicans, he agrees with them
on a number of basic issues such as tax cuts and gun control.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, his appeal is that of a problem-solver who promises to
sidestep the bickering of Washington and concentrate instead on
encouraging modest government action by the states, the counties
and the cities.
</P>
<P>
   Hence his stress on the role of churches and ``faith-based
organizations'' in welfare reform. Hence too his praise of the
crime-reduction, welfare and education reforms of the states.
</P>
<P>
   So the notion that the congressional Republicans are petty and
vindictive does his electoral prospects no harm at all. If they are
more interested in slinging mud and attaching blame than passing
laws, so be it. He is above all that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too often my party has confused the need for limited
government with a disdain for government itself... our goal (should
be): a limited government, respected for doing a few things and
doing them well.''
</P>
<P>
   Criticizing congressional Republicans also defuses criticism
that Bush is a captive of the right. It enables him to appeal
beyond his party's core constituency, to the center, where
elections are won.
</P>
<P>
   And it helps him in the huge task of moving the Republicans away
from their radical conservatism of the mid-1990s towards his more
compassionate kind.
</P>
<P>
   All this puts him in a far better position than the Democrats'
front-runner, Al Gore. The vice-president has been forced by Bill
Bradley's powerful challenge to move away from the center and
scramble for the endorsement of the unions, which stand among the
more narrow-minded and divisive of the Democrats' constituencies.
</P>
<P>
   So, while Gore is looking a bit like a machine politician of the
old school, Bush is emerging, Clinton-like, as the candidate of the
center.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, all that said, his strategy is not without risk. In
painting the Republicans in Congress as mean, he could harm their
chances of holding the House in next year's election (their
opinion-poll ratings are now even more abysmal than they were after
the impeachment debacle).
</P>
<P>
   A bigger risk is that, in appealing to the center, Bush could
lose support on the Republican right. Several of his rivals are
using his remarks to boost their appeal as the real conservative
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not going to beat the Democrats by sounding like
Clinton-Gore lite,'' said Steve Forbes. ``The more he speaks,''
said Rush Limbaugh, a talk-show host with a following among
conservative Republicans, ``the more troubled I am about his
candidacy.''
</P>
<P>
   It is true that at the moment Bush's money, his overwhelming
lead in national polls and the intense desire of Republicans to
back whoever can regain the White House will all incline activists
to swallow hard and back him.
</P>
<P>
   But in the first states to vote for the presidential nominee _
Iowa and New Hampshire _ Bush's poll lead is much smaller than it
is nationally, and Forbes and John McCain are both running
respectable campaigns there. A further erosion of his support would
turn them into credible challengers.
</P>
<P>
   It may seem unlikely that they could take the nomination away
from Bush. But they might well do enough to take away his aura of
inevitability. &QL;

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ What a week it has been for Al Gore. On Oct. 6 the
vice-president cut the ribbons on his new offices in Nashville,
Tenn., seizing the chance to talk unwoodenly of his love for home
and parents.
</P>
<P>
   Three days later, at a Democratic dinner in Iowa that just
happened to include his rival for the nomination, Bill Bradley, he
accused Bradley of cowardice to his face, and looked as if he had
rattled him.
</P>
<P>
   Then, to crown it all, came the news on Oct. 13 that he had won
the endorsement of America's trade-union congress, the AFL-CIO, at
its convention in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   It is a giant prize. The AFL-CIO has 13 million members; the
endorsement mobilizes the grass-roots efforts of those members on
behalf of Gore, and puts into his camp the 80 delegates the AFL-CIO
is expected to send to next summer's Democratic Party convention.
</P>
<P>
   It also slows down Bradley, who has been creeping level with
Gore in the latest Northeastern polls.
</P>
<P>
   Fully aware of the importance of this ``first primary,''
President Bill Clinton had pulled out all the stops on Gore's
behalf.
</P>
<P>
   He put in calls to the Food and Commercial Workers Union and the
International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, and even appeared
at a dinner to honor James Hoffa of the Teamsters, the closest
presidential brush with this sleaze-ridden union since Nixon's day.
</P>
<P>
   Yet although the AFL-CIO's president, John Sweeney, had all but
announced the endorsement of Gore when he opened the convention,
the voice-vote at the end was not quite so straightforward.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Clinton's wooing, the Teamsters _ the largest union
among the 68 represented, with 1.4 million members _ ``respectfully
disagreed'' with the endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa said his union's members needed more information about the
candidates' positions on issues dear to labor, and wanted the vote
delayed. (It was, in fact, the earliest endorsement labor has ever
given to a candidate.)
</P>
<P>
   Another important union, the 800,000-member United Auto Workers,
also chose to abstain.
</P>
<P>
   This reluctance was seen as an expression of unhappiness with
Gore's support for the North American Free-Trade Agreement (NAFTA)
and for the proposed inclusion of China in the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa was careful, however, to comment that the Teamster ``no''
vote was ``not a criticism of Gore nor an endorsement of Bradley.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Teamsters at the convention were less guarded. ``In the
South, we aay, `Don't wrap that pig, weigh it,''' said one
Kentucky member. ``And we'd like to have it weighed before it's
wrapped.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, in the end, the ``Yes'' vote for Gore turned out to
be a full-throated roar.
</P>
<P>
   The endorsement comes at a time when the unions are beginning to
recover some of their old power and influence after years of
decline. This year the AFL-CIO posted a net gain of about 200,000
new members after five straight years of losses.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney has concentrated on grass-roots organizing, and has
tried to recast labor's traditional hard-hat, white-man-only image
into a perception that the AFL-CIO embraces workers of every sort.
The ``Welcome'' banner in the convention hall displayed the word in
a dozen languages.
</P>
<P>
   But the organization has far to go before it returns to full
strength. In the 1950s about 35 percent of the American work force
was represented by a union; today the figure is 14 percent, even
with this year's gain in members.
</P>
<P>
   A new study commissioned by the AFL-CIO has revealed that in the
fastest-growing sectors of the American economy, including hotels,
airlines, retailing and child-care, only about one in 20 workers is
subject to collective-bargaining agreements.
</P>
<P>
   Organized labor clearly fears a return to the anti-labor
platform of the Reagan-Bush years, which the AFL-CIO assumes will
again predominate if George W. Bush becomes president.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore does not have their full confidence, either, and he had
some soothing to do when he addressed the delegates after the
endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   He promised to support raising the minimum wage by $1 an hour
(amid the loud cheering that followed, some delegates might not
have heard him add ``phased in over a couple of years'');
encouraging employers to provide flexible work-time schedules for
working parents; creating subsidies and tax credits for
stay-at-home mothers, and establishing tax-deductible savings
accounts to pay for college and further education.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Gore seemed well aware during his speech that while he
had received the AFL-CIO's endorsement, he has not yet captured
labor's love. ``I need more than your vote and your support,'' he
pleaded. ``I need your hearts.'' &QL;

decline. This year the AFL-CIO posted a net gain of about 200,000
new members after five straight years of losses.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney has concentrated on grass-roots organizing, and has
tried to recast labor's traditional hard-hat, white-man-only image
into a perception that the AFL-CIO embraces workers of every sort.
The ``Welcome'' banner in the convention hall displayed the word in
a dozen languages.
</P>
<P>
   But the organization has far to go before it returns to full
strength. In the 1950s about 35 percent of the American work force
was represented by a union; today the figure is 14 percent, even
with this year's gain in members.
</P>
<P>
   A new study commissioned by the AFL-CIO has revealed that in the
fastest-growing sectors of the American economy, including hotels,
airlines, retailing and child-care, only about one in 20 workers is
subject to collective-bargaining agreements.
</P>
<P>
   Organized labor clearly fears a return to the anti-labor
platform of the Reagan-Bush years, which the AFL-CIO assumes will
again predominate if George W. Bush becomes president.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore does not have their full confidence, either, and he had
some soothing to do when he addressed the delegates after the
endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   He promised to support raising the minimum wage by $1 an hour
(amid the loud cheering that followed, some delegates might not
have heard him add ``phased in over a couple of years'');
encouraging employers to provide flexible work-time schedules for
working parents; creating subsidies and tax credits for
stay-at-home mothers, and establishing tax-deductible savings
accounts to pay for college and further education.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Gore seemed well aware during his speech that while he
had received the AFL-CIO's endorsement, he has not yet captured
labor's love. ``I need more than your vote and your support,'' he
pleaded. ``I need your hearts.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Only a few years ago Air France was bankrupt, Germany's
Lufthansa was going nowhere and British Airways (BA) vied with
Singapore Airlines for the title of the world's most profitable
airline.
</P>
<P>
   This week BA's share price slid close to Pounds3 ($5), less than
half its level in the summer of 1998. The cause of the latest
decline was an admission by a small, nimble rival, Virgin, that,
like BA, it was suffering from a price war over the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts think that the French and German carriers are
still enjoying good profits, whereas BA is heading for a loss in
the year ending next March of Pounds100 million-200 million.
</P>
<P>
   Even more worryingly for BA, its rivals are pursuing
expansionist strategies diametrically opposed to its own. Both are
piling on capacity, revenue and profits; and Lufthansa is buying
airline-service businesses, such as catering and ground-handling,
with a view to dominating that part of the aviation business.
</P>
<P>
   BA, by contrast, is retreating to its core activities. The
problem is that the core looks pretty rotten.
</P>
<P>
   In the next few weeks the BA board must vote on whether to
maintain its dividend as a signal of its confidence, or cut the
dividend to conserve cash. The credibility of the chief executive,
Bob Ayling, has been stretched since trouble hit a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happened to the company that calls itself ``the world's
favorite airline?''
</P>
<P>
   At the height of its prosperity in the mid-1990s, BA brought in
an ambitious plan to cut Pounds1 billion off its Pounds8 billion
annual costs. So far it has found savings of about Pounds700
million; it hopes to hack out the other Pounds300 million by March.
</P>
<P>
   A cull of 1,000 middle managers should lop a further Pounds225
million off costs.
</P>
<P>
   This was proclaimed as a precautionary measure to prepare BA for
the next downturn, when price competition was bound to intensify.
BA also started to outsource as much as it could, getting rid of
such services as engineering, IT and catering.
</P>
<P>
   Its bosses talked of ``a virtual airline,'' one that
concentrated only on selling seats and operating flights.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts noted approvingly that BA had been the first
international airline to emerge smiling from the 1990-91 slump,
thanks to similar prompt action. Yet despite all its hacking, BA is
in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   One side-effect of the cost-cutting was a labor dispute in the
summer of 1997, when short-haul cabin crews went on strike to
protest against changes in their working patterns.
</P>
<P>
   The disruption lasted nearly a month, losing the airline
valuable business-class passengers. Low staff morale and
indifferent service further tried the loyalty of these lucrative
customers.
</P>
<P>
   Ayling's decision to replace the Union flag on BA tailfins with
ethnic art also went down badly with the pinstriped brigade; BA is
now putting a version of the flag back on again.
</P>
<P>
   Taken together, such things can damage a brand. BA has had other
problems too. It misjudged the regulatory opposition to its
proposed merger with American Airlines; the plan eventually had to
be dropped. &QL;

<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 75 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 525) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In effect, BA's international strategy was stalled for three
years as competitors streaked ahead. Although BA, AA and a handful
of other airlines now have a global alliance, called oneworld, it
is less well-established in the market than, say, Star (built
around Lufthansa, United Airlines, SAS and, from this week, All
Nippon Airways), which has been going for two-and-a-half years. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Closer to home, BA's forays into the continental European market
via Deutsche BA and Air Liberte in France are losing money. Its
low-cost offshoot, Go, will have a hard time breaking into profit,
because of competition from other start-ups such as Ryanair and
EasyJet.
</P>
<P>
   These threats are hitting BA just as its most profitable market,
London to America, has turned sour. Faced with a big fall in Asian
business, many airlines switched their jumbos to the Atlantic,
where previously they might have used smaller wide-bodies.
</P>
<P>
   The result has been a 25 percent rise in capacity in the market
from which BA earns a big part of its profits, coming on top of a
slump in its other big market, Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The ensuing price war has cut revenues per seat over the
Atlantic by about 10 percent for the industry as a whole. For BA,
the strength of sterling has hurt as well, making London an
expensive destination for travellers and reducing the value of BA's
foreign revenues.
</P>
<P>
   BA's cost-cutting was a tactical response to all this and to a
much-predicted downturn, but it was soon to lead, somewhat
serendipitously, to a strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago it faced a Pounds6 billion investment decision, as
its aging fleet of 30 big Boeing 747s and Douglas DC-10s was due
for replacement. The ensuing analysis revealed that BA was selling
as many as 100 seats on every 400-seat jumbo at prices well below
average costs.
</P>
<P>
   According to Andrew Light of Salomon Smith Barney, an investment
bank, it made sense to focus on profitable point-to-point business
and full-fare economy traffic, rather than boost market share with
transfer passengers flying on cheap tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Hence the decision to buy smaller wide-body jets for long-haul
routes. The Boeing 777, being newer, is cheaper to run than the
jumbo and, with around 300 seats, it can be filled with premium and
full-fare economy passengers.
</P>
<P>
   From shrinking the aircraft, it was but a small step to
shrinking the airline. Last August Ayling spelled out his intention
to shift his focus gradually from cut-price leisure travellers to
the premium passengers from whom airlines make money.
</P>
<P>
   The route network will be pruned of unprofitable, short-haul
services to free up slots for more flights of smaller, 100-seater,
short-haul aircraft such as the Airbus 318s that BA ordered this
week.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, BA will drop flights to Basle and instead market
seats block-booked at wholesale prices on Crossair, a Swiss
airline.
</P>
<P>
   The risks in such a strategy start with the fear that BA is
handing business to its competitors, which will grow bigger and
gain enough efficiency to maintain profits even with low-margin
revenues.
</P>
<P>
   The other danger is that BA's unit costs are sure to rise. Tim
Coombs of Aviation Economics, a London-based consultancy,
calculates that, even with cost savings, BA's unit costs will rise
by 7 percent from present levels.
</P>
<P>
   If profits are to regain their levels of the mid-1990s, its
revenues need to rise by twice as much. This will not be easy with
today's overcapacity. Unless the surplus melts away over the
Atlantic, BA's new strategy will not pay off. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 1,125. 450-WORD TRIM FOLLOWS TO 1,575) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   In contrast to BA's retrenchment, Air France is adding capacity
at a rate of 12 percent a year. Last year the French carrier flew
to only 36 American cities; this year the number is 162, boosted
partly by new flights and partly by its alliances with Delta and
Continental.
</P>
<P>
   Like BA, it is switching from jumbos to 777s to focus on more
frequent flights in smaller aircraft, always a lure to business
travellers. This expansion has helped Air France to increase
revenues on the Atlantic, against the trend. And it is cutting unit
costs.
</P>
<P>
   To an extent, Air France is exploiting opportunities that it has
neglected for years. But its prospects are helped by having a hub
at Charles de Gaulle Airport, where there is room for expansion
after the opening of a third runway last spring.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Heathrow or Amsterdam Schiphol, there is no strong local
opposition to more flights. Indeed, the airport plans to overtake
Heathrow in the next ten years.
</P>
<P>
   Already the number of international connecting flights has risen
by 44 percent in the past year, as Air France has begun to connect
the day's long-haul and short-haul flights in six ``waves,'' which
group arrivals and departures so as to shorten passengers' transfer
times.
</P>
<P>
   Air France's strategy seems to be paying off. Even last year,
before BA ran into its recurring quarterly losses, the French
carrier had caught up with it in terms of operating margin, though
it trails Lufthansa.
</P>
<P>
   Did BA have an alternative to its risky course? No, says one BA
executive. ``Not unless we did what Rupert Murdoch did in the
1980s, taking on the unions, moving the Times to Wapping and
completely altering his cost base.''
</P>
<P>
   So, rather than trying to improve labor productivity further (up
nearly 60 percent since privatization in 1987), BA wants to improve
capital productivity with smaller jets, frequent services and a
focus on premium traffic.
</P>
<P>
   This is what airlines in America did in the past ten years when
they trimmed capacity, reinforced their hubs and drove up yields.
</P>
<P>
   Although BA's business class is weak, the airline is revamping
it and introducing innovative bed-seats ahead of others.
</P>
<P>
   ``BA has to rebuild its presence in the long-haul business, and
the beds should do it,'' says Chris Tarry, of Commerzbank in
London. BA executives admit that they are ``betting everything'' on
the new strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe BA is ahead of the game, and other airlines, including Air
France and Lufthansa, are not ready for trouble ahead. Yet the
danger is that business-class and full-economy fares keep falling,
eroding the high margins on which BA's entire strategy is founded.
</P>
<P>
   If that happens, the world's favorite airline could become the
world's shakiest. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Only a few years ago Air France was bankrupt, Germany's
Lufthansa was going nowhere and British Airways (BA) vied with
Singapore Airlines for the title of the world's most profitable
airline.
</P>
<P>
   This week BA's share price slid close to Pounds3 ($5), less than
half its level in the summer of 1998. The cause of the latest
decline was an admission by a small, nimble rival, Virgin, that,
like BA, it was suffering from a price war over the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts think that the French and German carriers are
still enjoying good profits, whereas BA is heading for a loss in
the year ending next March of Pounds100 million-200 million.
</P>
<P>
   Even more worryingly for BA, its rivals are pursuing
expansionist strategies diametrically opposed to its own. Both are
piling on capacity, revenue and profits; and Lufthansa is buying
airline-service businesses, such as catering and ground-handling,
with a view to dominating that part of the aviation business.
</P>
<P>
   BA, by contrast, is retreating to its core activities. The
problem is that the core looks pretty rotten.
</P>
<P>
   In the next few weeks the BA board must vote on whether to
maintain its dividend as a signal of its confidence, or cut the
dividend to conserve cash. The credibility of the chief executive,
Bob Ayling, has been stretched since trouble hit a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happened to the company that calls itself ``the world's
favorite airline?''
</P>
<P>
   At the height of its prosperity in the mid-1990s, BA brought in
an ambitious plan to cut Pounds1 billion off its Pounds8 billion
annual costs. So far it has found savings of about Pounds700
million; it hopes to hack out the other Pounds300 million by March.
</P>
<P>
   A cull of 1,000 middle managers should lop a further Pounds225
million off costs.
</P>
<P>
   This was proclaimed as a precautionary measure to prepare BA for
the next downturn, when price competition was bound to intensify.
BA also started to outsource as much as it could, getting rid of
such services as engineering, IT and catering.
</P>
<P>
   Its bosses talked of ``a virtual airline,'' one that
concentrated only on selling seats and operating flights.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts noted approvingly that BA had been the first
international airline to emerge smiling from the 1990-91 slump,
thanks to similar prompt action. Yet despite all its hacking, BA is
in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   One side-effect of the cost-cutting was a labor dispute in the
summer of 1997, when short-haul cabin crews went on strike to
protest against changes in their working patterns.
</P>
<P>
   The disruption lasted nearly a month, losing the airline
valuable business-class passengers. Low staff morale and
indifferent service further tried the loyalty of these lucrative
customers.
</P>
<P>
   Ayling's decision to replace the Union flag on BA tailfins with
ethnic art also went down badly with the pinstriped brigade; BA is
now putting a version of the flag back on again.
</P>
<P>
   Taken together, such things can damage a brand. BA has had other
problems too. It misjudged the regulatory opposition to its
proposed merger with American Airlines; the plan eventually had to
be dropped. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 75 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 525) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In effect, BA's international strategy was stalled for three
years as competitors streaked ahead. Although BA, AA and a handful
of other airlines now have a global alliance, called oneworld, it
is less well-established in the market than, say, Star (built
around Lufthansa, United Airlines, SAS and, from this week, All
Nippon Airways), which has been going for two-and-a-half years. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Closer to home, BA's forays into the continental European market
via Deutsche BA and Air Liberte in France are losing money. Its
low-cost offshoot, Go, will have a hard time breaking into profit,
because of competition from other start-ups such as Ryanair and
EasyJet.
</P>
<P>
   These threats are hitting BA just as its most profitable market,
London to America, has turned sour. Faced with a big fall in Asian
business, many airlines switched their jumbos to the Atlantic,
where previously they might have used smaller wide-bodies.
</P>
<P>
   The result has been a 25 percent rise in capacity in the market
from which BA earns a big part of its profits, coming on top of a
slump in its other big market, Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The ensuing price war has cut revenues per seat over the
Atlantic by about 10 percent for the industry as a whole. For BA,
the strength of sterling has hurt as well, making London an
expensive destination for travellers and reducing the value of BA's
foreign revenues.
</P>
<P>
   BA's cost-cutting was a tactical response to all this and to a
much-predicted downturn, but it was soon to lead, somewhat
serendipitously, to a strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago it faced a Pounds6 billion investment decision, as
its aging fleet of 30 big Boeing 747s and Douglas DC-10s was due
for replacement. The ensuing analysis revealed that BA was selling
as many as 100 seats on every 400-seat jumbo at prices well below
average costs.
</P>
<P>
   According to Andrew Light of Salomon Smith Barney, an investment
bank, it made sense to focus on profitable point-to-point business
and full-fare economy traffic, rather than boost market share with
transfer passengers flying on cheap tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Hence the decision to buy smaller wide-body jets for long-haul
routes. The Boeing 777, being newer, is cheaper to run than the
jumbo and, with around 300 seats, it can be filled with premium and
full-fare economy passengers.
</P>
<P>
   From shrinking the aircraft, it was but a small step to
shrinking the airline. Last August Ayling spelled out his intention
to shift his focus gradually from cut-price leisure travellers to
the premium passengers from whom airlines make money.
</P>
<P>
   The route network will be pruned of unprofitable, short-haul
services to free up slots for more flights of smaller, 100-seater,
short-haul aircraft such as the Airbus 318s that BA ordered this
week.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, BA will drop flights to Basle and instead market
seats block-booked at wholesale prices on Crossair, a Swiss
airline.
</P>
<P>
   The risks in such a strategy start with the fear that BA is
handing business to its competitors, which will grow bigger and
gain enough efficiency to maintain profits even with low-margin
revenues.
</P>
<P>
   The other danger is that BA's unit costs are sure to rise. Tim
Coombs of Aviation Economics, a London-based consultancy,
calculates that, even with cost savings, BA's unit costs will rise
by 7 percent from present levels.
</P>
<P>
   If profits are to regain their levels of the mid-1990s, its
revenues need to rise by twice as much. This will not be easy with
today's overcapacity. Unless the surplus melts away over the
Atlantic, BA's new strategy will not pay off. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 1,125. 450-WORD TRIM FOLLOWS TO 1,575) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   In contrast to BA's retrenchment, Air France is adding capacity
at a rate of 12 percent a year. Last year the French carrier flew
to only 36 American cities; this year the number is 162, boosted
partly by new flights and partly by its alliances with Delta and
Continental.
</P>
<P>
   Like BA, it is switching from jumbos to 777s to focus on more
frequent flights in smaller aircraft, always a lure to business
travellers. This expansion has helped Air France to increase
revenues on the Atlantic, against the trend. And it is cutting unit
costs.
</P>
<P>
   To an extent, Air France is exploiting opportunities that it has
neglected for years. But its prospects are helped by having a hub
at Charles de Gaulle Airport, where there is room for expansion
after the opening of a third runway last spring.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Heathrow or Amsterdam Schiphol, there is no strong local
opposition to more flights. Indeed, the airport plans to overtake
Heathrow in the next ten years.
</P>
<P>
   Already the number of international connecting flights has risen
by 44 percent in the past year, as Air France has begun to connect
the day's long-haul and short-haul flights in six ``waves,'' which
group arrivals and departures so as to shorten passengers' transfer
times.
</P>
<P>
   Air France's strategy seems to be paying off. Even last year,
before BA ran into its recurring quarterly losses, the French
carrier had caught up with it in terms of operating margin, though
it trails Lufthansa.
</P>
<P>
   Did BA have an alternative to its risky course? No, says one BA
executive. ``Not unless we did what Rupert Murdoch did in the
1980s, taking on the unions, moving the Times to Wapping and
completely altering his cost base.''
</P>
<P>
   So, rather than trying to improve labor productivity further (up
nearly 60 percent since privatization in 1987), BA wants to improve
capital productivity with smaller jets, frequent services and a
focus on premium traffic.
</P>
<P>
   This is what airlines in America did in the past ten years when
they trimmed capacity, reinforced their hubs and drove up yields.
</P>
<P>
   Although BA's business class is weak, the airline is revamping
it and introducing innovative bed-seats ahead of others.
</P>
<P>
   ``BA has to rebuild its presence in the long-haul business, and
the beds should do it,'' says Chris Tarry, of Commerzbank in
London. BA executives admit that they are ``betting everything'' on
the new strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe BA is ahead of the game, and other airlines, including Air
France and Lufthansa, are not ready for trouble ahead. Yet the
danger is that business-class and full-economy fares keep falling,
eroding the high margins on which BA's entire strategy is founded.
</P>
<P>
   If that happens, the world's favorite airline could become the
world's shakiest. &QL;

<P>
   LEXINGTON AND OMAHA, NEB. _ A decade ago Lexington, Neb., was a
dying town. In the late 1980s, a big tractor factory shut down;
almost overnight, the population fell and businesses started
closing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like a ghost town,'' recalls Marty Romero, who ran a
homeless shelter then. ``The biggest landowner was a bank. People
would just walk into the bank and leave their keys on the
president's desk.''
</P>
<P>
   But in 1990 IBP, a big slaughterhouse (meat-packing plant, to
Americans) moved into the space where the old tractor factory had
been. With that, Lexington managed to turn itself round.
</P>
<P>
   Today, thanks to the Interstate highway nearby and the arrival
of new workers, it is teeming with life.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the plant's employees _ mostly Latinos, plus a few
Asians _ have legal working papers. But some do not, and that is
why towns like Lexington have caught the attention of the
Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS).
</P>
<P>
   Lexington is one of many towns in Nebraska, Iowa and other Great
Plains states revived in part by immigrants flocking to work in
slaughterhouses.
</P>
<P>
   All things being equal, of course, the plants would prefer to
have legal workers. But unemployment is low in these parts _
between 1 percent and 2 percent recently _ and the going wage for
the plants' bloody, dangerous jobs is well below what was paid 20
years ago. So most jobs go to immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the industry say that some employers look the other
way when they hire workers of uncertain provenance, but even those
who stick by the rules can be fooled by the spread of increasingly
convincing fake documents.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the INS rooted out undocumented workers by raiding
factories, sometimes under cover of darkness and with the help of
heavily armed policemen.
</P>
<P>
   But this year INS officials devised a gentler new way of doing
things, called Operation Vanguard. Under Vanguard, INS officials
check employees' work documents regularly and compare them with
federal databases to work out which employees are legal and which
are not.
</P>
<P>
   The agency switched to this approach because it seemed likely to
be both cheaper and more humane; but it is also a real nuisance for
companies that use undocumented workers. Raids are no longer a
once-every-several-years cost of doing business; the companies are
now subject to constant scrutiny and checking.
</P>
<P>
   When the first round of Vanguard investigations started in
Nebraska earlier this year, it pored over 24,000 employee records
and found 4,441 discrepancies.
</P>
<P>
   Each employee with a discrepancy was asked to meet INS
officials. About three-quarters disappeared rather than show up for
the interview. That did not make them fugitives from the INS; it
only meant that they would lose their jobs _ the agency's
objective.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the other 1,000-odd managed to explain their
circumstances to the INS's satisfaction. Only 34 came to the
interview but failed to justify themselves; they were arrested, and
set on a path towards deportation.
</P>
<P>
   The agency thought Vanguard a success. So did the meat-packing
companies _ but with much less enthusiasm. With a quarter of their
workers gone, many businesses faced serious disruption. Worried
businessmen prevailed upon their elected representatives to
complain about the agency's activities.
</P>
<P>
   In a striking reversal, politicians who had once favored a stern
approach to immigration suddenly found themselves asking for
greater leniency, fearing that their local economies could be
damaged by strict INS enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   Odder still, business leaders sought out alliances with
advocates for Latino causes, with whom they had long tangled over
such matters as working conditions for plant employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``An IBP vice-president called asking for my help in fighting
Vanguard,'' says Father Damian Zuerlein of Our Lady of Guadalupe, a
predominantly Latino Catholic church in Omaha. ``When that
happened, I asked myself, `What planet am I on?'''
</P>
<P>
   The two groups' concerns are not precisely aligned. The big
issue for meat-packing executives and the cattlemen who supply them
is that Vanguard seems to single out their industry and their part
of the country, particularly at a time when low commodity prices
have already been hurting ranchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't expect INS to run the agency based on what's best for
Nebraska agriculture, but I also don't expect them to go out of
their way to come up with a program that kicks agriculture right in
the shins,'' says Ben Nelson, a former governor who opposed
Vanguard before leaving office earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, some worried Latinos fear that many innocents
will be caught up in the dragnet, and that too little legal and
humanitarian assistance is available locally to handle so much
dislocation.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Latino advocates note that an operation like Vanguard
is more damaging to undocumented workers with established families;
footloose single workers can move on easily, whereas families hit
hard by Vanguard may have to uproot children in school or spouses
or relatives in jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Local activists and INS officials agree that the agency needs to
put extra effort into the human-services part of its job, rather
than just enforcement. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (100-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 850) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the INS office in Omaha, 200 people a day show up seeking
help, far more than the small staff can handle. The modest waiting
room is usually filled; those farther back in the queue have to
stand outside for hours.
</P>
<P>
   If extra officers were assigned to paperwork duty, it might mean
fewer discrepancies and delays. Yet the last time Congress
increased the INS's staff in Nebraska, it merely added several
dozen enforcement officers assigned to handle illegal immigrants
who were picked up by state troopers along Interstate 80. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORYDES AT 1,075) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So far, the lobbying by businessmen, Latino activists and
politicians appears to have fallen on deaf ears. INS officials in
Omaha and Washington are convinced that Vanguard-style operations
are the way to go; they are now attempting to bring the concept to
other states, beginning with Iowa, as well as to other professions,
including restaurant and hotel work, in order to squeeze the kinds
of job that are thought to employ the largest number of illegal
workers.
</P>
<P>
   They are also planning fresh investigations every three months
in states where Vanguard has already been introduced.
</P>
<P>
   There is no guarantee that the INS can apply simultaneous
pressure in enough states and enough industries to remove all job
options from undocumented workers. But, so far, nothing else has
worked nearly so well. &QL;

federal databases to work out which employees are legal and which
are not.
</P>
<P>
   The agency switched to this approach because it seemed likely to
be both cheaper and more humane; but it is also a real nuisance for
companies that use undocumented workers. Raids are no longer a
once-every-several-years cost of doing business; the companies are
now subject to constant scrutiny and checking.
</P>
<P>
   When the first round of Vanguard investigations started in
Nebraska earlier this year, it pored over 24,000 employee records
and found 4,441 discrepancies.
</P>
<P>
   Each employee with a discrepancy was asked to meet INS
officials. About three-quarters disappeared rather than show up for
the interview. That did not make them fugitives from the INS; it
only meant that they would lose their jobs _ the agency's
objective.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the other 1,000-odd managed to explain their
circumstances to the INS's satisfaction. Only 34 came to the
interview but failed to justify themselves; they were arrested, and
set on a path towards deportation.
</P>
<P>
   The agency thought Vanguard a success. So did the meat-packing
companies _ but with much less enthusiasm. With a quarter of their
workers gone, many businesses faced serious disruption. Worried
businessmen prevailed upon their elected representatives to
complain about the agency's activities.
</P>
<P>
   In a striking reversal, politicians who had once favored a stern
approach to immigration suddenly found themselves asking for
greater leniency, fearing that their local economies could be
damaged by strict INS enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   Odder still, business leaders sought out alliances with
advocates for Latino causes, with whom they had long tangled over
such matters as working conditions for plant employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``An IBP vice-president called asking for my help in fighting
Vanguard,'' says Father Damian Zuerlein of Our Lady of Guadalupe, a
predominantly Latino Catholic church in Omaha. ``When that
happened, I asked myself, `What planet am I on?'''
</P>
<P>
   The two groups' concerns are not precisely aligned. The big
issue for meat-packing executives and the cattlemen who supply them
is that Vanguard seems to single out their industry and their part
of the country, particularly at a time when low commodity prices
have already been hurting ranchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't expect INS to run the agency based on what's best for
Nebraska agriculture, but I also don't expect them to go out of
their way to come up with a program that kicks agriculture right in
the shins,'' says Ben Nelson, a former governor who opposed
Vanguard before leaving office earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, some worried Latinos fear that many innocents
will be caught up in the dragnet, and that too little legal and
humanitarian assistance is available locally to handle so much
dislocation.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Latino advocates note that an operation like Vanguard
is more damaging to undocumented workers with established families;
footloose single workers can move on easily, whereas families hit
hard by Vanguard may have to uproot children in school or spouses
or relatives in jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Local activists and INS officials agree that the agency needs to
put extra effort into the human-services part of its job, rather
than just enforcement. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (100-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 850) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the INS office in Omaha, 200 people a day show up seeking
help, far more than the small staff can handle. The modest waiting
room is usually filled; those farther back in the queue have to
stand outside for hours.
</P>
<P>
   If extra officers were assigned to paperwork duty, it might mean
fewer discrepancies and delays. Yet the last time Congress
increased the INS's staff in Nebraska, it merely added several
dozen enforcement officers assigned to handle illegal immigrants
who were picked up by state troopers along Interstate 80. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONCLUDES AT 1,075) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So far, the lobbying by businessmen, Latino activists and
politicians appears to have fallen on deaf ears. INS officials in
Omaha and Washington are convinced that Vanguard-style operations
are the way to go; they are now attempting to bring the concept to
other states, beginning with Iowa, as well as to other professions,
including restaurant and hotel work, in order to squeeze the kinds
of job that are thought to employ the largest number of illegal
workers.
</P>
<P>
   They are also planning fresh investigations every three months
in states where Vanguard has already been introduced.
</P>
<P>
   There is no guarantee that the INS can apply simultaneous
pressure in enough states and enough industries to remove all job
options from undocumented workers. But, so far, nothing else has
worked nearly so well. &QL;

   NEW YORK _ It looks like a simple decision. One of the perks of
being a politician is that you watch sports events from the best
seats. At the moment, the voters of New York are interested in only
one thing: the possibility of a ``subway'' World Series between the
city's two baseball teams, the Yankees and the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   So what better way for a New York politician to mix business
with pleasure than turning up to watch your team? Unfortunately,
for Hillary Rodham Clinton, nothing comes easy.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Mrs. Clinton, who has never lived in New York
but wants to become its senator, suddenly revealed that she had
always been a Yankees fan.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, this was completely true, not remotely an attempt to
pander to voters and certainly not a joust at Rudy Giuliani, Mrs.
Clinton's likely rival for the Senate seat, whose most notably
human characteristic is his devotion to the ``Bronx Bombers.''
</P>
<P>
   Alas, very few people (including, hurtfully, the Yankee players)
seem to believe Mrs. Clinton. Hence the prospect that if she makes
her way to Yankee Stadium (a picture of which she has of course
lovingly clutched through the long years in Chicago, Arkansas and
Washington), she may just possibly be laughed at by the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   That will not worry the fan in Mrs. Clinton, who will presumably
be too thrilled at finally seeing her heroes in action to notice;
but it might not be so successful for the prospective senator (let
alone the aide who advised her to pledge her troth so publicly).
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, if she stays away, she can count on Giuliani
pointing it out repeatedly. Chancing her luck with the fans may be
Mrs. Clinton's best chance.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Koch, a former mayor, has already advised her to ``take a
Yankee cap and bow to the crowd, and act as though they were
cheers.'' And they could surprise her.
</P>
<P>
   When a far less endearing British politician, David Mellor,
gingerly turned up at a Chelsea football game after the disclosure
of an adulterous affair, he was cheered to the rooftops.
</P>
<P>
   But then Mellor was a Chelsea regular, who, according to the
tabloids, had donned the team's strip when in bed with his
mistress.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Mrs. Clinton simply chose the wrong team. The
demographics were right.
</P>
<P>
   The polls show that the Yankees, who are the current world
champions (as in other American sports, ``world'' being redefined
to mean the United States and Canada), have around twice as many
fans in the city as the much less predictable Mets; in fact they
are the most followed team in the country. But they are also, for
much the same reasons, probably the most hated.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Yankees' ``real fans,'' just like their
equivalents at Manchester United, are always griping at the
out-of-towners who latch on to the team's success, wear the cap
without knowing the players' names, and drive up seat prices.
</P>
<P>
   If Mrs. Clinton had gone for the Mets, she would still have had
to counter a few disbelieving cynics, but she would have looked
brave and original _ and offended very few voters (Yankees fans
don't hate the Mets; they pity them).
</P>
<P>
   And the Mets might just win, which would be one in the eye for
Giuliani. But Mrs. Clinton's heart seems to have ruled her head. As
was once observed by Yogi Berra, the Yankee oracle, baseball is
only ``90 percent mental, the other half is physical.'' &QL;

<P>
   After insisting that no scientific study had ever proved
depleted uranium (DU) shells could cause cancer in Iraq or Kosovo,
NATO has refused to cooperate with a United Nations team
investigating the use of the munitions in the former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Pekka Haavisto, chairman of the U.N.'s Balkan environment task
force, says NATO refused to cooperate with his team and that
``immediate action is necessary to obtain information from NATO
confirming if, how and where, DU was used during the conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   There is, of course, no ``if'' about it. NATO admitted in answer
to a question from The Independent in May that U.S. A-10 aircraft
had used DU shells _ designed to penetrate thick armor _ against
Serb targets, a statement the U.S. Department of Defense later
repeated.
</P>
<P>
   A NATO spokesman claimed _ inaccurately _ that a Rand
Corporation study had proved DU munitions caused no harm.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of tons of DU were used in the 1991 Gulf War. In the
years that followed, there was an epidemic of cancers among Iraqis
living near the battlefields _ many of whom showed symptoms
identical or similar to those of thousands of Allied veterans now
suffering from Gulf War syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists fear similar contamination has taken place in
ex-Yugoslavia. Yet when last month NATO was asked for the locations
in Kosovo where DU was used, a spokesman said the information was
``not releasable.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.N., it now turns out, got the same runaround. ``NATO
always replied to our letters,'' an official in Haavisto's office
told me. ``But they never gave the answers we were expecting. They
were never able to release the information. They said it was
`security.'''
</P>
<P>
   Inquiries by The Independent have established that NATO knows
perfectly well, from munitions and pilots' reports, target areas
against which DU weapons were used. They include districts close to
Djakovica, Mitrovica, Pristina, Urahovac and in Serbia proper.
</P>
<P>
   In private, NATO officers have been telling humanitarian
officials in Kosovo to stay away from any area where DU was used _
while still refusing to state where they are.
</P>
<P>
   Haavisto's report recommends ``a thorough review of the effects
on health of medium and long-term exposure to DU'' by the World
Health Organization. Yet two years ago the Iraqis asked the WHO for
just such a report. It was never produced.
</P>
<P>
   Now the U.N. says _ in its DU report _ that ``during and
immediately after any attack where depleted uranium was used, some
people in the immediate vicinity may have been heavily exposed to
depleted uranium by inhalation.''
</P>
<P>
   Special health examinations are necessary, the U.N. says, adding
that the possible contamination of land need not prevent refugees
from returning to their villages.
</P>
<P>
   But ``hot spot'' target areas must be identified as soon as
possible and arrangements made ``for the secure storage of any
contaminated material.''
</P>
<P>
   This, of course, cannot be done _ because NATO is keeping the
information secret. &QL;

   Julius Nyerere, former president of Tanzania, died after he had
voluntarily left office, still respected by his people. To this
extent alone, he set himself apart from many of his fellows in that
small club of African men who guided their countries to
independence.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast Kwame Nkrumah, the first to break from Britain's
colonial grip when the Gold Coast became Ghana in 1957, was
transformed during his reign from a charming and popular natural
leader to a diabolic force who built statues to himself, undermined
the judiciary, and left his opponents to rot in jail.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, the Nkrumah path has been more frequently travelled by
African leaders than Nyerere's.
</P>
<P>
   Mobutu, Bokassa, Banda, Amin, and many others, all used their
office to fatten their foreign bank accounts and further their
megalomaniac ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   Their ideology _ usually an ill-defined and sentimental
nationalism _ was the thinnest of disguises for crude kleptocracy.
Much wickedness progressed under the guise of the ``African way''
of running things.
</P>
<P>
   Nyerere, too, tried to find an African way forward for Tanzania.
He thought the continent was a natural home of socialism, that
sharing and cooperation were the norm for pre-colonial African
society, and that post-colonial leaders would be able to resurrect
this heritage with ease.
</P>
<P>
   He tried to organize Tanzania into a system of collective
villages. But the peasants, as they had done before, worked for
themselves, and only pretended to work on communal plots. The
economy stagnated, and corruption was endemic.
</P>
<P>
   The failure of the villages was a hard lesson. But there was one
legacy of Nyerere's ``ujamaa'' socialism that blesses Tanzania to
this day: it defused the country's ethnic rivalries _ divisions
that blight every country on the continent, providing so often a
pretext for ambitious men to grab power.
</P>
<P>
   Other nations _ Nigeria, Angola _ have only themselves to blame
for their poverty. They have the resources, but abuse them.
</P>
<P>
   Tanzania has precious few resources. But at least the only war
it has fought in recent times was to enter Uganda and remove the
appalling Idi Amin from power.
</P>
<P>
   A leader can make a difference. There are very few in Africa who
have made a difference for the better _ Nelson Mandela is the
outstanding example. Perhaps Nyerere should also belong to this
too-small club. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ When Willie Brown first contemplated running for
mayor of San Francisco, he wasn't sure the job could hold his
interest. ``Street lights, dog-doo and parking meters are not my
cup of tea,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He needn't have worried. Four years into the job, and with a
monumental reelection battle in progress, he can safely say his
life is anything but boring.
</P>
<P>
   He has officiated at mass gay weddings, appointed the Beat
figurehead Lawrence Ferlinghetti as his very own Poet Laureate,
although Ferlinghetti is yet to oblige with a single poem, and has
been on the receiving end of three cream pies thrown by an
agit-prop group called the Bionic Baking Brigade.
</P>
<P>
   On the 50th birthday of his campaign manager, Jack Davis, he and
the cream of San Francisco society were treated to a startling
sadomasochistic sex show in which two performers lacerated each
others' backs, performed Satanic rituals and put a Jack Daniels
bottle to unspeakable uses.
</P>
<P>
   Lack of boredom has not made Brown popular, however. Lambasted
for his harsh treatment of the homeless population and his
painfully slow progress in fixing the bus system, his would-be
successors are now sharpening their knives over everything from his
choice of district attorney _ who has the worst conviction record
in the city's history and likes to throw punches, even in court _
to his uncanny knack of making friends with construction magnates
grown rich on city contracts.
</P>
<P>
   With election day under a month away, the Federal Bureau of
Investigation is crawling all over city offices to investigate
allegations that contracts earmarked for companies run by ethnic
minorities are going to shell organizations acting as fronts for
powerful white friends of the man winkingly known as ``Da Mayor.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown is throwing every ounce of his considerable energy into a
grand theatrical campaign. Determined not to appear defensive, he
has organized groups of hecklers to drown out his rivals at mayoral
debates.
</P>
<P>
   Anxious to pick up every last vote, his reelection committee has
been trawling through every old age home and housing project to
register poor and minority voters who can be talked into supporting
him, if only because he is black.
</P>
<P>
   According to one report, they have even been visiting county
jails to register eligible inmates.
</P>
<P>
   If the political battles in San Francisco seem theatrical, then
they are complemented perfectly by the goings-on across the bay in
Oakland, where another famous Brown _ former California governor
Jerry Brown _ is settling into his first term as mayor.
</P>
<P>
   The eccentric radical, who briefly gave up politics to study at
Mother Teresa's knee, kicked off his term with a mass meditation
ceremony and has since invited everyone from the Black Panthers to
the U.S. Marine Corps to join his idiosyncratic campaign to revive
the gritty industrial city.
</P>
<P>
   The two Browns are having an electric effect on Bay Area
politics, since both have a sure talent for attracting attention
and gossip.
</P>
<P>
   When Willie, a famously suave dresser, was pied by the Bionic
Baking Brigade he stunned just about everyone by applying the full
pressure of the law against the perpetrators and having them
sentenced to six months behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   When Jerry the pacifist invited the Marines into Oakland for
three days of noisy war games, he infuriated his city council. One
member said the only benefit to the local economy would be
increased custom for the city's prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
   It guaranteed reams of local media coverage. How much either of
them is achieving in office is another matter.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry has already modified his pledge to provide 10,000 new
units of affordable housing in downtown Oakland _ dropping the
commitment to affordability.
</P>
<P>
   He has gone back on his pledge to community-based policing,
encouraging an orthodox tough-on-crime approach.
</P>
<P>
   David Hilliard, the former black radical who returned
enthusiastically to Oakland, saying that Jerry Brown sounded ``more
like a Black Panther every day,'' now says the mayor has sold the
African-American community down the river.
</P>
<P>
   Councilwoman Nancy Nadel, a radical, now says: ``He's not a team
player. He is conscious of what he needs to do to be reelected and
focuses on meeting those political needs.''
</P>
<P>
   The story is similar in San Francisco, where Willie Brown failed
to fix Muni, the municipal transport system, in 100 days as he had
promised. He hasn't fixed it more than 1,000.
</P>
<P>
   And, faced with an unprecedented housing boom, he has torn down
far more low-income housing than he has created.
</P>
<P>
   But Brown is a politician's politician, a man who survived more
than 15 years as Speaker of the California state assembly and
earned a national reputation as a deal-maker.
</P>
<P>
   So, despite abysmal approval ratings, he has engineered an
electoral landscape in which the other candidates are even less
popular.
</P>
<P>
   One challenger, the former police chief Frank Jordan, has made
almost no headway in obliterating the lukewarm memories of his
tenure as mayor in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's career blew up in his face on the eve of the 1995
election when, incredibly, two radio shock jocks from Los Angeles
managed to talk their way into his house and persuaded him to climb
into the shower with them for an all-naked interview.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan evidently thought the interview would increase his appeal
with young voters, but when pictures of the occasion made the local
papers he became the laughingstock of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's other challenger, Clint Reilly, is a political
consultant with strong links to the property and insurance worlds _
links that have made it impossible for him to attack Brown for his
own considerable deference to ``special interests.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Willie will win because he's smarter than everyone else,''
remarked Jo Schuman Silver, a theatrical impresario well connected
to the Brown camp.
</P>
<P>
   And so, San Francisco can look forward to another four years of
Willie. It won't be scintillating politics, perhaps, but it is sure
to be great theatre. &QL;

   MOSCOW _ The clash at the paper mill has only confirmed that
nearly a decade after the collapse of communism, capitalist Russia
remains a wild environment for foreign businessmen.
</P>
<P>
   For centuries Western merchants have come to Russia, hoping to
tap its enormous potential, only to go away again bewildered by
this country, which is neither truly European nor fully Asian but a
maddening law unto itself.
</P>
<P>
   Alcem, the British company, now risks losing its investment. But
some Western businessmen have come to Russia and lost their lives.
</P>
<P>
   The most shocking case was probably that of the American
entrepreneur Paul Tatum, who had a joint stake in the
Radisson-Slavyanskaya Hotel in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   He helped to turn what had been a dreary Intourist hotel into an
establishment fit to receive U.S. President Bill Clinton when he
visited Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Then his Russian partners tried to sideline him. He was in the
process of fighting them in court. They used other methods to end
the argument.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, he was shot dead in an underpass near the Kiev railway
station. He was accompanied by two bodyguards, both of whom
survived, leaving him alone in a pool of his own blood.
</P>
<P>
   Tatum had come to Russia at a time when foreigners were allowed
to have a partial involvement in business here.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Bolshevik Revolution, there were many foreign firms,
for example the Scottish department store Muir and Mirrielees,
which was to Moscow what Selfridges is to London or Jenners to
Edinburgh. But after 1917, everything was nationalized and
collectivized.
</P>
<P>
   As part of his perestroika reforms, Russian President Mikhail
Gorbachev allowed ``joint ventures,'' in which foreigners could
have a maximum of 49 percent but the controlling share remained
Russian.
</P>
<P>
   Only under President Boris Yeltsin, who took market reforms
further, were foreigners able to buy the factories, like the pulp
and paper mill, that had failed under communism.
</P>
<P>
   Today, there are some success stories, such as that of Inchcape
which, to everyone's satisfaction, has built a profitable bottling
plant for Coca-Cola in the Urals, or Procter and Gamble, which
dominates the market in hygiene products.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's economic crisis frightened many foreigners away but
business analysts say that Russia remains a land of opportunity for
those who are prepared to be patient and take the long-term
approach.
</P>
<P>
   However, many have fallen by the wayside before they could enjoy
the fruits of their efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The British have always been cautious here, more so than the
Americans or the Germans. There was a time when, out of all
proportion to the size of their country, the Irish were active in
Moscow. But many of them have gone quietly, not waiting, as Paul
Tatum did, for things to turn nasty.
</P>
<P>
   There was a man called Colm Fitzsimmons, who managed a corner
shop called the ``Garden Ring Irish Supermarket.'' His imported
groceries were outrageously expensive but he pulled in crowds of
customers with his personal charm.
</P>
<P>
   He gave to charity, he sponsored the arts. He sponsored the
first ever performance in Moscow of Handel's ``Messiah,'' with an
expatriate choir and a Russian orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   Then his Russian partners took over the store. The price of the
groceries went up even further while the service became sullen and
Soviet-like. The customers deserted it in droves.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually it closed and now on the site, somebody else is
trying to make a go of a shop selling sports clothes. &QL;

<P>
   BEIRUT _ Walter and I have seen many strange things from our
balcony on the Beirut seafront.
</P>
<P>
   There was the prospect that the famous Avenue de Paris would be
renamed Boulevard du President Hafez el-Assad. They gave the name
instead to a highway near the airport.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the Israeli naval vessel that often cruised the
waters opposite us. Walter, the family cat, would watch the Hetz
class gunboat with deep concern.
</P>
<P>
   But now we have a Greek goddess just down the road, holding
aloft a symbolic and eternal burning lamp _ to the fury of the
gentlemen who pray in the mosque opposite.
</P>
<P>
   The Goddess is temporary, of course, part of an exhibition by
the Lebanese Association for Plastic Arts whose designs of giant,
floodlit red-painted feet above the rocks and display of white rock
salt have been puzzling, irritating or delighting the thousands of
Lebanese who nightly throng the Corniche.
</P>
<P>
   There's even a collection of black-sided cabins backing onto the
sea in which Beirutis can enjoy ``personal space'' while imagining
that they have their own one-man or one-woman apartment on the
shore. But the Goddess is the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Beirut is being billed as the ``Cultural Capital of the Middle
East,'' a title that became a little frayed when a local judge this
month tried to take Marcel Khalifeh _ one of Beirut's most loved
singers _ to court for defaming Islam in a harmless song based on a
Mahmoud Darwish poem.
</P>
<P>
   And after morning prayers at the Ein el-Mreisse mosque last
Friday, the congregation _ Sufis for the most part, it seems _
showed that they too had different views on the ``cultural''
capital.
</P>
<P>
   Their first target was the twirling pile of rock salt surrounded
by tiles which carried a verse saying: ``We come from Infinity. We
live in Infinity. We will go back to Infinity. We are the
embodiment of Infinity.''
</P>
<P>
   Harmless, even trite, as the legend may be _ and it was hardly a
pillar of salt _ the lads from the mosque were not amused. Only God
could define the infinite, they complained. Then they saw the
Goddess.
</P>
<P>
   Fully clothed she may be, plain-faced even, her burning lamp a
hollow replica, a cheap, golden-painted ready-made statue put up by
a local architect called Tony Chakar.
</P>
<P>
   Even her title _ ``A Retroactive Monument for a Chimerical
City'' was pretty tame; seductive, brash and often wounded Beirut
may be, but hardly visionary.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the goddess stood on a red carpet, beside red-swathed
benches, almost opposite the old mosque. She was golden, a graven
image. She was ``a voluptuary,'' they decided. Worse still _ and I
suspect this was the heart of the matter _ she was a woman.
</P>
<P>
   The worshippers were scandalized because _ in the imperishable
words of one of the faithful _ ``even if these things are not
directly opposite our mosque, they can be seen by believers going
to pray.''
</P>
<P>
   So they descended on our local ``mukhtar,'' Sami Siblini _ the
shop-keeper-cum-regional mayor who signs my residency papers _ and
threatened to destroy the exhibition; some of his customers even
thought they might destroy Sami's shop.
</P>
<P>
   How could he have allowed such sacrilege? There was talk of
putting a police guard _ night and day _ on the hollow goddess and
the pile of salt.
</P>
<P>
   There were suggestions that perhaps the whole shooting-match
should be dismantled and erected up in the mountains.
</P>
<P>
   But as usual, there was a Lebanese compromise. The tiles around
the salt were wiped clean of their quotations _ so much for
infinity _ and the Goddess, along with her red carpet, was tugged a
hundred meters down the seafront where she now stands opposite the
Hard Rock Cafe.
</P>
<P>
   It only brought more Lebanese down to the Corniche to see the
blood-red feet and the black-sided cubicles, the salt and the
Goddess.
</P>
<P>
   It's funny how Beirut seems all things to all men. On the
Corniche, the city now feels like a test-bed, boasting a display
that is intended to mock the memory of the rich old Beirut of the
1960s but put ``in extremis'' by those who would prefer only the
art of Islamic architecture and illuminated Korans.
</P>
<P>
   Down in Kuwait, Ahmed al-Baghdadi, the head of the emirate
university's politics department who has been imprisoned for
``denigrating Islam'' in a 1996 article, began a hunger strike in
protest at his treatment, promising to go into exile to Beirut
because of its freedoms and because it was, yes, the Cultural
Capital of the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   When, I asked myself, did al-Baghdadi last visit Beirut? But the
Lebanese and their guests never let you down.
</P>
<P>
   When I wandered the seafront this week, I was stopped by a
middle-aged man next to the golden goddess. ``What does it mean?''
he asked. It means, I replied hopefully, what you want it to mean.
He stared at me. ``Yes, but what does it mean?'' &QL;

PLANNED PARENTHOOD HEAD CRITICIZES BOTH PARTIES ON REPRODUCTIVE 
 CHOICE
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By CARLA MARINUCCI 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  SAN FRANCISCO _ The head of Planned Parenthood lambasted
presidential candidates Tuesday _ Republican and Democratic alike _
for failing to address issues of reproductive choice critical to
millions of American women, and called for a nationwide
mobilization to counter ``noisy ideological groups (who've) set the
agenda for too long.''
<P>
   Gloria Feldt, president of both the Planned Parenthood
Federation of America and its powerful political action committee,
was in San Francisco to announce a 2000 pro-choice initiative she
said is designed to force presidential hopefuls to outline
positions on issues such as sex education, access to family
planning services and funding for contraceptives to poor women.
</P>
<P>
   ``If presidential candidates can be war heroes, they can be
heroes for responsible choices,'' said Feldt, who heads the
nation's oldest and largest family planning organization, in a
speech before the Commonwealth Club of California. ``If they can be
blessed by family fortune and privilege, they can feel for those
who are not. If they can be a role model for women, they can listen
to women who have brought them this far.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue of reproductive health care _ including the volatile
issue of abortion _ has proved a dramatic factor in California
politics as recently as the 1998 governor's race. State polls have
shown that two-thirds of all California voters are satisfied with
current abortion laws or favor even less restrictive laws, and that
an equal number would be less likely to support a candidate who
opposed abortion rights for women. Such views, political insiders
said, were a deciding factor in the landslide victory in
California's governor's race of pro-choice Democratic candidate
Gray Davis over GOP challenger Dan Lungren, who was vociferously
anti-abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Feldt said Tuesday that next year's election will be a watershed
for the 90 percent of American voters who favor family planning
services.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, she said, both Republican and Democratic candidates have
been largely silent on issues that go far beyond abortion. Those
include whether emergency contraception should be made available to
millions of American women, or whether they support the so-called
``conscience clause,'' which allows private hospitals to decide if
they will make available family planning or fertility treatments _
even if they are the only health care provider in a community, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``George Bush, recant your arrogant statement that Americans'
hearts are in the wrong place,'' Feldt said, in her critique of the
crop of presidential candidates. ``Steve Forbes, stand up for
responsible choices like you did in your first campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``John McCain, you say your incarceration made you value America
and its freedoms even more. What about the freedom to choose family
planning?
</P>
<P>
   ``Elizabeth Dole, show the compassion in this debate that you
did at the Red Cross,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Feldt also had sharp words for Democrats, saying that pro-choice
Al Gore needs to be more specific and ``articulate the connection
between the environment and family planning.'' And Bill Bradley,
another pro-choice Democrat, ``may have voted right'' in the U.S.
Senate but now needs to ``make these issues a visible and important
plank'' in his platform.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all must zero in on every candidate and make them tell us
where they stand on responsible choices,'' Feldt said. ``If a
candidate won't stand up for responsible choices on reproductive
health during the campaign, he or she won't do so in office.''

NERVE GAS PILL WAS CALLED SUSPICIOUS 2 YEARS AGO
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By SABIN RUSSELL 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  SAN FRANCISCO _ A new Pentagon study suggesting a link between
Gulf War syndrome and a precautionary nerve gas pill taken by
American troops has a familiar ring to it, according to Dr. Joyce
Lashof, former dean of the Berkeley School of Public Health.
<P>
   Nearly three years ago, a White House commission headed by
Lashof made the same observation in a detailed study of the
mysterious maladies affecting tens of thousands of Gulf War
veterans. Tuesday's report made bigger waves, however, because the
Pentagon has long denied any possible link between the nerve gas
pill _ pyridostigmine bromide _ and the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a recommendation for further research on the possible
synergistic action between pyridostigmine bromide and pesticides,''
said Lashof. ``We left the same door open.''
</P>
<P>
   While only a few hundred U.S. service members died as a result
of the conflict, wildly varying estimates of between 20,000 and
100,000 veterans have unexplained symptoms of chronic pain, skin
rashes, nausea, memory loss and concentration problems.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Rand think tank report released by the Department of
Defense Tuesday, Lashof's Presidential Advisory Committee on Gulf
War Veterans Illnesses study, released in January 1997, found that
there was reason to suspect that the prophylactic doses of the drug
might be involved in the syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   GIs took up to three pyridostigmine bromide pills a day in
combat zones where Iraqis were believed to have stocks of soman, a
fast-acting nerve gas. In fact, Saddam Hussein's troops did not
have that weapon at their disposal.
</P>
<P>
   The earlier study noted, however, that the nerve gas pill _ long
approved for the treatment of the neurological disorder myasthenia
gravis _ was not known to cause chronic illness except in cases
where there were acute symptoms of poisoning by overdose.
</P>
<P>
   Lashof's study made headlines at the time for debunking the
popular notion that Gulf War syndrome was linked to nerve gas
exposure, and it leaned heavily toward the theory that Gulf War
syndrome is a range of real illnesses triggered by stress.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real illness,`' said Lashof. ``People are sick. I
personally think it is very similar to chronic fatigue syndrome.''
</P>
<P>
   The former Berkeley dean, who is also a past president of the
American Public Health Association, said stress can have a
significant impact on the immune system and the endocrine system.
``Similar symptoms have been described after other wars, dating
back to the Civil War,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon report is based on a survey of dozens of studies on
pyridostigmine bromide, among them findings by University of Texas
and Duke researchers that the drug can cause nerve damage when
mixed with other chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1994, the Pentagon has spent $133 million researching Gulf
War syndrome, and has devoted $20 million of that amount
specifically to studies of pyridostigmine bromide. In her Rand
report Tuesday, Dr. Beatrice Golomb of the San Diego Veterans
Affairs Medical Center said further study is needed to explore the
potential interactions of the drug with pesticides and other
chemicals _ including nerve gas agents _ that may have been
encountered by troops.
</P>
<P>
   The theory is that these interactions might permanently disrupt
the body's regulation of acetylcholine, a molecule that plays a
pivotal role in the process of nerve signaling.

 START YOUR DAY THE MUNI WAY  &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A little pat on the back, by someone other than
a pickpocket _ that's all we really need in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   Wendy Farnsworth, a newcomer to San Francisco, got hers on Muni.
She was riding the J line when her Muni driver called out the stop:
``Van Ness! Give all the glory to God and praise his name, and have
a wonderful and stress-free day!''
</P>
<P>
   That's a violation of the separation of church and state, maybe,
but Muni has inspired more praying than any church in town.
</P>
<P>
   Next stop: ``Civic Center! Don't judge your importance by how
many people serve you, but by how many people you serve!''
</P>
<P>
   One passenger wondered aloud, ``What is this? Chicken soup for
Muni?''
</P>
<P>
   Farnsworth figures it beats the bags of M&AMP;Ms Muni recently
handed out as an apology for blowing a day's commute.
</P>
<P>
   HOW ABOUT some chicken soup for the 49ers' soul?
</P>
<P>
   At his Monday press conference, 49ers' coach Steve Mariucci said
part of the problem is injuries. Gee, in  &UR; football? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   He said, ``We're looking for a way to healthy-up ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Is Mariucci channeling Mammy Yokum?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Steve oughtta fuss 'round the kitchen and rustle up a mess
o' vittles, put some meat on the bones of them football hombres o'
his'n.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe help can be found in the photo-op backdrop used at
Mariucci's press conferences. The 49er logo is interspersed with
the logo of a team sponsor. ``This sponsor is what the team needs
to hold it all together this season,'' Lou Bristol points out:
``Staples.''
</P>
<P>
   IN NEON, VERITAS: The United repair hangar on the Bay side of
101 has a huge neon sign, and the second ``n'' is burned out.
</P>
<P>
   Sonja Hyams noticed it, and having suffered many delays and
cancellations on United Shuttle, assumed it was a simple
confession: UNITED AIR LI ES.
</P>
<P>
   PLEASE, MARLA, don't tarnish our image of the Don:
</P>
<P>
   Marla Maples, ex-wife of Donald Trump, vows that if he runs for
president, she'll tell the world what he ``is really like.''
</P>
<P>
   Isn't that like Hillary threatening to tell the truth about
Bill?
</P>
<P>
   Here's a story going around: Trump finds himself alone in an
elevator with a beautiful woman. She tells him how much she admires
him, offers to do a Lewinsky right there in the elevator.
</P>
<P>
   Trump says, ``OK, but what's in it for me?''
</P>
<P>
   IT WAS SAD when a delivery van driver knocked over the ancient
sidewalk clock in North Beach. Although, realistically, the clock
has Roman numerals and hands, so within 10 years there won't be
anyone around who could read it.
</P>
<P>
   Based on early reports, the driver won't be cited. Shouldn't he
at least be ordered into a diversion program for dangerously lousy
drivers, or for clock abusers? That was a big clock, a million
people have parked there without clonking it. And it could have
been a baby stroller.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why is no one being held responsible for this?'' asks Daniel
DeTori, who phoned to protest.
</P>
<P>
   I guess DeTori thinks the driver should do some time.
</P>
<P>
   THE SCALES of justice can be messier than the scales of a dead
halibut, but it wouldn't seem fair to punish a careless driver in
the same week when John and Patsy Ramsey get cleared by a Boulder
grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Says Jim Greene, ``The Ramseys should think about pooling their
resources with O.J. and looking for all the real killers.''
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU WANT a policewoman in San Francisco, buddy, you have to
travel back in time.
</P>
<P>
   Sergeant Leanna Dawydiak, SFPD, notes my recent mention of a
``policewoman,'' and points out that years ago, before women were
allowed to be full-fledged S.F. cops, they could hire on for a desk
job classified as Q-20, or ``policewoman.'' No street work, no
promotions.
</P>
<P>
   Now, S.F. police officers _ men, women and misc. _ are police
officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't just about being politically correct,'' Dawydiak
notes, correctly, ``it's also about giving us the respect of the
title we had to go to court to attain.''
</P>
<P>
   One thick skull, penetrated.
</P>
<P>
   NO PENCILS, no books, and now:
</P>
<P>
   A school board meeting at Everett Middle School was called to
order and the board president asked everyone to stand for the
Pledge of Allegiance.
</P>
<P>
   Several hundred people stood, and glanced about, looking for the
flag. Didn't find it. Sat down. No pledge.
</P>
<P>
   SOOO MARIN: A want ad in the Marin Independent Journal, for a
'90 Volvo: ``Silver, 5-spd., A/C, phone, sunroof ... Great au pair
car.''
</P>
<P>
   MAYBE THIS will help the 49ers healthy-up, in lieu of chicken
soup:
</P>
<P>
   Dippy Foods, Inc. (Motto: ``Respect us, dammit!'') will soon be
supplying Candlestick Park beer carts with ``fresh, prepackaged
nacho, cheese and salsa meals called `Dippers.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the answer to the age-old question: ``If we can put a
man on the moon, why can't we can't find a way to make ballpark
nachos look and taste even more pre-fab?''
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure how the Dippy nacho cheese will get melted, 49er
fans, so just in case, BYO magnifying glass.

<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA _ Sometime Wednesday evening in Jakarta _ or perhaps it
will be early Thursday morning _ after one, two or maybe three
separate votes, Indonesia's highest legislative body will elect the
country's fourth president.
</P>
<P>
   The winner will a female nationalist, although it could also be
a Muslim cleric, or a former aeronautical engineer _ or possibly
none of the three.
</P>
<P>
   His, or her, vice-president will definitely be a civilian,
provided, of course, that he is not a general.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens, the result will bring true democracy to
Indonesia for the first time in its history _ unless, that is, it
plunges the country into renewed political chaos and violent
disintegration.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesian politics has never been easy to follow, but rarely
has Jakarta seen the confusion which has gripped the capital this
week. For the last three days, crowds of demonstrators have filled
the streets _ but whether they are jubilantly celebrating the
advent of democracy or angrily protesting its passing, is
completely unclear.
</P>
<P>
   With less than 24 hours to go Tuesday night until one of the
most important votes in recent Southeast Asian history, and despite
a blizzard of analysis in magazines, newspapers and on television,
no one had a blind idea of who is going to win.
</P>
<P>
   Almost everything about today's presidential election is
uncertain, from the list of candidates to procedures for the vote
itself.
</P>
<P>
   Since May last year, when President Suharto was bounced from
power after 32 years as Indonesia's undisputed dictator, a wave of
democratic fervor has swept the country.
</P>
<P>
   In 17 months, Indonesia has acquired countless new political
parties and a raucously free and unruly press. But the basic
political machinery, the institutions through which leaders are
elected and dismissed, is still essentially those of the old
dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the strain is beginning to show and the euphoria of
the post-Suharto era is slowly turning to cynicism.
</P>
<P>
   The focus of the problems is the People's Consultative Assembly
or MPR, the 700-strong body which nominally wields supreme power in
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   In the past its business was simple. During the rule of Suharto,
all of its members were personally approved by him _ in any case,
he was the only candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, no one knows how many there will be _ so vague are the
rules governing the nomination of candidates that the final list
will not be drawn up until just before the election itself.
</P>
<P>
   The main contenders have already staked their claims, but as
politicians they are as confused and compromised as the MPR itself.
</P>
<P>
   The insiders' joke is that the leading candidates are a version
of the three wise monkeys: one who is deaf, one who is blind, and
one who is mute.
</P>
<P>
   The deaf ``monkey'' is B.J. Habibie, the former vice-president
of Suharto, who succeeded to the post by default after the forced
resignation of his old friend and patron.
</P>
<P>
   During his brief tenure, he has liberalized press laws, released
political prisoners, and brought about the long-awaited referendum
on independence in East Timor. But his achievements have been
swamped by his omissions _ his failure to check corruption or to
bring successful prosecutions against Suharto and his family.
</P>
<P>
   Far from winning credit, he has secured a reputation as a
bumbling incompetent, deaf to the wishes of his people.
</P>
<P>
   The unspeaking ``monkey'' is Megawati Sukarnoputri, leader of
the Indonesian Democratic Party-Struggle (PDI-P), and still a
heroine to many Indonesians for her stubborn, dignified and
peaceful resistance to President Suharto.
</P>
<P>
   As the daughter of the country's nostalgically revered founder,
Sukarno, she is held in almost mystical regard by many of the
country's poor.
</P>
<P>
   As a secular-minded nationalist, she has positioned herself
above the often bickering internal disputes of Indonesian Muslims.
But even her closest advisers have become exasperated by her
failure to articulate clear policies, or to engage seriously in the
construction of a credible coalition.
</P>
<P>
   July's parliamentary election, she won one third of the votes _
enough to give her a moral mandate as the country's most popular
leader, but not enough to control the MPR. Since then her aloofness
has alienated potential allies, although she still remains the most
likely winner today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call her an aristocratic democrat,'' says Mochtar Buchori, a
close adviser and member of her inner circle. ``She was born and
brought up the daughter of a president. She always lives in
isolation and she never mixes with ordinary people.''
</P>
<P>
   The third, Abdurrahman Wahid, is an exception in that his
disability is literal. A brilliant and unpredictable Muslim cleric
and scholar, he is almost blind and has recently suffered two
strokes.
</P>
<P>
   There was speculation last night that he might withdraw his
candidacy in favor of Nurcholis Madjid, another respected Muslim
scholar with no party affiliation and no direct experience of the
political hurly-burly. There was speculation last night that
Habibie's party, Golkar, might replace him with his chief enforcer,
Akbar Tanjung. Last night, there was speculation in abundance, but
no firm information at all.
</P>
<P>
   By a small margin, Madam Megawati is the favorite but her
success will depend on last-minute deal-making with adversaries
which will dilute her government.
</P>
<P>
   Her defeat is still a distinct possibility leading to a highly
unpredictable government under Wahid, or success for Habibie.
</P>
<P>
   The last possibility would provoke angry protests which could
easily degenerate into rioting and violence. Or, they might not.
</P>
<P>
   The only certainty about the election is that it will leave
many, many Indonesians unhappy. &QL;

   There was speculation last night that he might withdraw his
candidacy in favor of Nurcholis Madjid, another respected Muslim
scholar with no party affiliation and no direct experience of the
political hurly-burly. There was speculation last night that
Habibie's party, Golkar, might replace him with his chief enforcer,
Akbar Tanjung. Last night, there was speculation in abundance, but
no firm information at all.
</P>
<P>
   By a small margin, Madam Megawati is the favorite but her
success will depend on last-minute deal-making with adversaries
which will dilute her government.
</P>
<P>
   Her defeat is still a distinct possibility leading to a highly
unpredictable government under Wahid, or success for Habibie.
</P>
<P>
   The last possibility would provoke angry protests which could
easily degenerate into rioting and violence. Or, they might not.
</P>
<P>
   The only certainty about the election is that it will leave
many, many Indonesians unhappy. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   MARCOVIA, Honduras _ It seems relatively simple: a nation torn
apart by Hurricane Mitch's raging floods needs to be rebuilt.
</P>
<P>
   Donor countries and international charities step in, providing
millions in aid to repair infrastructure and hundreds of volunteers
to help with housing. Slowly, roads are cleared, wash-outs filled
in, temporary bridges installed and hundreds of new cement block
houses are constructed.
</P>
<P>
   But a year after Mitch's floods, it's clear that rebuilding a
poor country devastated by a natural disaster isn't so easy _ at
least not if you want to address the underlying problems that made
the disaster so much worse than it might have been.
</P>
<P>
   For example, central Honduras' heavily populated highlands are a
rugged, mountainous region. People build wherever they can, often
on steep hillsides prone to collapse in heavy rains, or next to
streams that can grow in hours from placid to deadly.
</P>
<P>
   In many places, aid workers helped Mitch's victims rebuild right
where their homes used to be. While their intentions were good, the
workers really didn't help the families in the long run because
this year's rainy season has flooded the homes again.
</P>
<P>
   Other groups have built houses in better locations, but haven't
provided sanitation or clean water systems. Now rural people
accustomed to bathing in streams and defecating without thought to
the sanitary consequences are still doing that, turning their new
homes into places vulnerable to disease.
</P>
<P>
   Good intentions alone, it seems, aren't enough, even when the
victims being helped are desperately poor.
</P>
<P>
   Workers for CARE, an Atlanta-based relief group that has worked
here for more than four decades, recite the refrain constantly:
``It's easy to build houses. It's more important to help build
self-sustaining communities.''
</P>
<P>
   Veterans of natural and man-made disasters around the globe,
they know it's easy to be blinded by cultural biases, to ignore how
the people you are trying to help think and live. Simply rushing
in, building a house and then moving on may do more harm than good,
they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are proposing a program to address the social situation in
the new communities built since Mitch,'' said CARE's director in
Honduras, Marc de Lamotte. ``If we don't address it, we run the
risk of creating ghettos with all the problems of crime, insecurity
and unemployment that come with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the simple act of providing food for disaster victims must
be carefully thought out.
</P>
<P>
   CARE made a point to limit free handouts of food in Mitch's
aftermath to only a few weeks. Once the situation was stabilized,
the handouts were transformed into food-for-work programs. This
encouraged the people to move from being passive victims to active
participation in the rebuilding of their lives. It also avoided
undermining the local economy, since farmers would be reluctant to
plant new crops if free food was available.
</P>
<P>
   CARE is helping build an entire new town near this flooded one,
but has been careful not to simply construct new houses and turn
them over to the flood victims. They have required people to build
their own houses, and the result has been a sense of ownership and
pride in the new community.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, rebuilding Honduras will take years. But what many
hope is that the effort will address the underlying problems of
poverty, sanitation and poor education that have hampered this
country for decades _ and made Mitch's impact much worse than it
might have been.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just the bricks and mortar,'' said Phil Gelman, who
has directed CARE's emergency operations in Honduras since Mitch.
``There's the whole social side of getting these new communities
off the ground. It's going to be a long process.''

   IT'S TIME FOR BUSH TO SPEAK OUT AGAINST BUCHANAN. ``George W.
Bush should tell us what he really thinks of fellow Republican
presidential candidate Pat Buchanan's history of bigotry,'' writes
columnist James Garcia in this commentary. He continues that if
Bush really wants us to believe that Republicans are serious about
inviting more people of color to join the GOP, he should start by
publicly denouncing Buchanan's views on minorities, women and
homosexuals. Garcia thinks that Bush's silence sends a disturbing
message _ namely that Bush is less interested in taking a
principled stand against the likes of Buchanan than he is in
holding on to a few more right-wing votes. PLEASE NOTE: This is a
strong opinion piece which may provoke reactions from readers.
</P>
<P>
   THE TALE OF THE `INDIAN' TRADEMARK. Before Karen Lincoln
Michel's tribe legally changed its name to Ho-Chunk, they were
known as Winnebago. ``The motor-home connection to my tribe
wouldn't be so demoralizing, I used to think, if we were reaping
some of the profits from the RV maker,'' Michel writes. An Indian
tribe in southern Oregon can relate. The Cow Creek Band of Umpqua
Tribe of Indians wanted to revive the vintage Indian Motorcycle by
manufacturing a new version on reservation land. But a white-owned
company beat them to the rights to the ``Indian'' trademark a year
ago. Michel reports that it is unlawful under the federal Indian
Arts and Crafts Act to label products as ``Indian made'' when they
are not. Her take: ``Most companies neither verbalize nor
demonstrate any kind of respect for Native-Americans unless they
can make a buck from it.'' Lincoln is a past president of the
Native-American Journalists Association.
</P>
<P>
   ON ISRAEL, I'LL CALL IT AS I SEE IT _ Columnist Bill Maxwell
knows that his commentaries about Israel anger many American Jews
nationwide. He is often asked why he, an American black, is
interested in Israel and Jews. Maxwell tries to answer this
question, as well as examine a related issue, that of Jews
selectively misreading anything they deem unflattering to Israel _
even if the issue in question is indisputably true. '' ... too many
American Jews see the nation as an innocent land that can do no
wrong. The truth is that the Promised Land _ while giving Jews a
sacred homeland and while inspiring millions of other people
worldwide to wonder and to affirm their religious faith _ has warts
just like other nations. Acknowledging this simple truth does not
make a journalist an anti-Semite,'' Maxwell writes.
</P>
<P>
   IS THE GOVERNMENT TELLING US THE TRUTH ABOUT THE MOSQUITOES?
Mayor Giuliani and his health-department aides would like New
Yorkers to believe that the pesticide malathion that has been
sprayed all over the city's neighborhoods recently to kill off any
mosquitoes carrying the West Nile virus is perfectly safe. How safe
it is really? Columnist Juan Gonzalez reports that on a data sheet
from one of the city's main malathion suppliers, a company called
Cheminova Agro, a note to physicians reads: ``Fyfanon ULV
(malathion) is a cholinesterase inhibitor affecting the central and
peripheral nervous systems, and producing cardiac and respiratory
depression.'' According to Dr. Adrienne Buffaloe, who runs a
private environmental medicine center on Manhattan's upper East
Side, ``the city and federal governments are deceiving the public
about the dangers of malathion ... A good number of medical
professionals have been troubled by the massive pesticide spraying
that went on in New York.''

<P>
   ASIAN-AMERICAN STUDIES IN THE FAST LANE. There's a new momentum
in Asian-American studies (AAS) at the university level, reports
Mitchell J. Chang in this excerpt from A. Magazine. Way back in
1968, AAS emerged out of the social unrest at San Francisco State
University. It grew slowly, mainly across the West Coast and in
pockets in the East until the '90s, when the field experienced a
turbo-charged expansion. So why the sudden growth spurt? For one
thing, there has been as jump in Asian Pacific American student
enrollment. In addition to this, students in the '90s are the
children of the civil-rights struggles that established the
original AAS courses and programs. They fully expect to have the
opportunity to take such courses. In this feature, Chang, an
assistant professor at the Graduate College of Education at the
University of Massachusetts, Boston, offers a primer on the boom in
Asian-American studies.

   IT'S TIME FOR BUSH TO SPEAK OUT AGAINST BUCHANAN. ``George W.
Bush should tell us what he really thinks of fellow Republican
presidential candidate Pat Buchanan's history of bigotry,'' writes
columnist James Garcia in this commentary. He continues that if
Bush really wants us to believe that Republicans are serious about
inviting more people of color to join the GOP, he should start by
publicly denouncing Buchanan's views on minorities, women and
homosexuals. Garcia thinks that Bush's silence sends a disturbing
message _ namely that Bush is less interested in taking a
principled stand against the likes of Buchanan than he is in
holding on to a few more right-wing votes. PLEASE NOTE: This is a
strong opinion piece which may provoke reactions from readers.
</P>

   THE TALE OF THE `INDIAN' TRADEMARK. Before Karen Lincoln
Michel's tribe legally changed its name to Ho-Chunk, they were
known as Winnebago. ``The motor-home connection to my tribe
wouldn't be so demoralizing, I used to think, if we were reaping
some of the profits from the RV maker,'' Michel writes. An Indian
tribe in southern Oregon can relate. The Cow Creek Band of Umpqua
Tribe of Indians wanted to revive the vintage Indian Motorcycle by
manufacturing a new version on reservation land. But a white-owned
company beat them to the rights to the ``Indian'' trademark a year
ago. Michel reports that it is unlawful under the federal Indian
Arts and Crafts Act to label products as ``Indian made'' when they
are not. Her take: ``Most companies neither verbalize nor
demonstrate any kind of respect for Native-Americans unless they
can make a buck from it.'' Lincoln is a past president of the
Native-American Journalists Association.

<P>
   ON ISRAEL, I'LL CALL IT AS I SEE IT _ Columnist Bill Maxwell
knows that his commentaries about Israel anger many American Jews
nationwide. He is often asked why he, an American black, is
interested in Israel and Jews. Maxwell tries to answer this
question, as well as examine a related issue, that of Jews
selectively misreading anything they deem unflattering to Israel _
even if the issue in question is indisputably true. '' ... too many
American Jews see the nation as an innocent land that can do no
wrong. The truth is that the Promised Land _ while giving Jews a
sacred homeland and while inspiring millions of other people
worldwide to wonder and to affirm their religious faith _ has warts
just like other nations. Acknowledging this simple truth does not
make a journalist an anti-Semite,'' Maxwell writes.
</P>
<P>
   IS THE GOVERNMENT TELLING US THE TRUTH ABOUT THE MOSQUITOES?
Mayor Giuliani and his health-department aides would like New
Yorkers to believe that the pesticide malathion that has been
sprayed all over the city's neighborhoods recently to kill off any
mosquitoes carrying the West Nile virus is perfectly safe. How safe
it is really? Columnist Juan Gonzalez reports that on a data sheet
from one of the city's main malathion suppliers, a company called
Cheminova Agro, a note to physicians reads: ``Fyfanon ULV
(malathion) is a cholinesterase inhibitor affecting the central and
peripheral nervous systems, and producing cardiac and respiratory
depression.'' According to Dr. Adrienne Buffaloe, who runs a
private environmental medicine center on Manhattan's upper East
Side, ``the city and federal governments are deceiving the public
about the dangers of malathion ... A good number of medical
professionals have been troubled by the massive pesticide spraying
that went on in New York.''

   ASIAN-AMERICAN STUDIES IN THE FAST LANE. There's a new momentum
in Asian-American studies (AAS) at the university level, reports
Mitchell J. Chang in this excerpt from A. Magazine. Way back in
1968, AAS emerged out of the social unrest at San Francisco State
University. It grew slowly, mainly across the West Coast and in
pockets in the East until the '90s, when the field experienced a
turbo-charged expansion. So why the sudden growth spurt? For one
thing, there has been as jump in Asian Pacific American student
enrollment. In addition to this, students in the '90s are the
children of the civil-rights struggles that established the
original AAS courses and programs. They fully expect to have the
opportunity to take such courses. In this feature, Chang, an
assistant professor at the Graduate College of Education at the
University of Massachusetts, Boston, offers a primer on the boom in
Asian-American studies.

 &HT;    ``I NEED MORE ROOM,'' says Joanne Taylor, owner of The Treasure
House in Mesa. Taylor opened the store seven years ago, after
working at a variety of jobs.
 &HT;    LIFE IN AMERICA: Grand Mesa lover sees (and sells) everything
 &HT;    (Eds: This is another story in a series of reports on life in
small-town America _ the values, the stories and the characters _
at the end of the millennium. Photos and a sig/locator map are

<P>
   GRAND MESA, Colo. _ The house is too small for the treasures.
</P>
<P>
   One corner is crowded with ``I fish therefore I lie'' baseball
caps, Old Dutch cleanser and Powderhorn sweat shirts, another
corner overflows with handmade dream catchers, postcards and books
about Grand Mesa.
</P>

   ``I need more room,'' said Treasure House owner Joanne Taylor,
scanning the 800-plus-square-foot building from her vantage point
behind the counter, which also is stacked with things like
newspapers and candy, treasures to the right person.
</P>
<P>
   The permanent treasure, though, the one beyond pop rocks and
pewter jewelry, is outside the window. Right now it's a palette of
autumn, oak brush leaves rusted auburn like barn door hinges and
the pine and spruce forest up Grand Mesa slopes marbled with gold
stands of aspen.
</P>
<P>
   Colors and textures change with the seasons, but always are
treasured by Mesa residents who give themselves a gift just by
looking out the window each morning. Having been spared, so far,
many of the more pernicious effects of rampant development familiar
to the rest of western Colorado, Mesa remains a town where people
wave to strangers they pass on the street and keep canoes on their
front porches.
</P>
<P>
   And there's that view.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's why I moved here,'' Taylor said, interrupting her
explanation to talk with a customer who needed party balloons. ``I
came up here the first time when I was 7 _ I lived in Fruita _ and
fell in love with the mountain.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the wide-open valleys that caught her, the variegated
landscape of desert cliffs to oak brush to high country aspen and
pine, with Mesa on the cusp of it all and a view to everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   She came up again after graduating from high school, and briefly
flirted with moving to Mesa, but was hindered by the question of
how she'd support herself, ``and that's always been the problem up
here,'' she said. ``There's not a lot of full-time work. When I
finally did move up here I worked three jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor and her family moved to Grand Mesa 18 years ago _ she was
37 and her sons were 10 and 7. For several years she worked part
time at the general store, was relief postmaster, refinished
furniture, mowed lawns and house-sat. For the past 15 years she's
been a single parent, and money's always been tight, but for years
she dreamed of opening a store like The Treasure House. Seven years
ago she took a deep breath and did it, after her youngest son
graduated from high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the first couple of years were a struggle,'' she said,
``but I wanted it to be more than a gift store, so it would be for
the people in this town.''
</P>
<P>
   So when townspeople asked her to stock necessities like cleaning
and office supplies, she complied. And when area artists asked if
they could put their creations in her store on consignment, she
agreed, so now more than 135 people consign wares with her. And
when kids wanted toys, she added toys, and candy, and Powderhorn
memorabilia, until now every conceivable inch of shelf and wall and
floor space is home to something for sale.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning next week, she'll be the busiest she is all year with
hunters coming in to buy ``guilt gifts,'' she calls them, to take
home to their families. In fact, Taylor's store has become a
constant for a steady stream of out-of-state hunters who stop by
every year on their way through Mesa. The town itself is a constant
for all sorts of people.
</P>
<P>
   There's some dispute over how the town started, whether it was
an offshoot of the Mormon pioneers who came up the Grand Mesa to
start a settlement or whether it was started by ranchers who
appreciated the proximity of summer and winter pasture in the
manageable area of Grand Mesa.
</P>
<P>
   But Mesa was and largely remains a ranching town. At the end of
last century and into this one, enormous ranches dominated the
landscape around Mesa. Bertha Lloyd, a lifelong Mesa resident, at
one time owned, with her husband, Dick, 26,000 acres of land on
which they raised cattle.
</P>
<P>
   And with ranching came not just issues of land use, water rights
and grazing regulations, but the more interesting characters
ranching can attract. Lloyd remembers stories of the Brinks family,
who owned the ranch E.D. Stewart eventually bought, and were
notorious for stealing cattle, drinking and riding their horses in
the house. When the Lloyds were first married and Dick worked for
the Stewarts, he brought Bertha into the house and showed her the
grooves in the sandstone staircase created by horseshoes.
</P>
<P>
   Families like the Stewarts and Stoddards, Saunders, Lloyds and
Pruitts shaped Mesa as a town, back from the time when the only way
to town was over the Hogback down the front of the mesa and
everybody gathered at the post office at 5 p.m. every day for the
mail, to now when the old ranchers are retiring and the big ranches
are being sold off in parcels.
</P>
<P>
   But the feel of the town hasn't changed much. People still know
each other and stop to talk on the sidewalk and know the old
stories. Though there has been an influx of newcomers in the last
few years, most of those people are looking to escape the rush of
cities and don't want to disrupt the ebb and flow of life in Mesa.
Kids go to school at Plateau Valley, people support 4-H and think
twice about going to town.
</P>
<P>
   The town is unincorporated and a population estimate based on
the 360 boxes rented at the post office is less than 1,000, so it's
one of those small Colorado mountain towns that frazzled city
people dwell on and teenagers who grow up there can't wait to
leave.
</P>
<P>
   But they're replaced by people like Taylor who can't wait to
move there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it here,'' she said. ``It's the kind of place where you
can watch wildlife walk through your front yard.''
</P>
<P>
   And that, she said, is the best treasure of all.

START YOUR DAY THE MUNI WAY
</HEADLINE>
 
(Repeating for all needing)   &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A little pat on the back, by someone other than
a pickpocket _ that's all we really need in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   Wendy Farnsworth, a newcomer to San Francisco, got hers on Muni.
She was riding the J line when her Muni driver called out the stop:
``Van Ness! Give all the glory to God and praise his name, and have
a wonderful and stress-free day!''
</P>
<P>
   That's a violation of the separation of church and state, maybe,
but Muni has inspired more praying than any church in town.
</P>
<P>
   Next stop: ``Civic Center! Don't judge your importance by how
many people serve you, but by how many people you serve!''
</P>
<P>
   One passenger wondered aloud, ``What is this? Chicken soup for
Muni?''
</P>
<P>
   Farnsworth figures it beats the bags of M&AMP;Ms Muni recently
handed out as an apology for blowing a day's commute.
</P>
<P>
   HOW ABOUT some chicken soup for the 49ers' soul?
</P>
<P>
   At his Monday press conference, 49ers' coach Steve Mariucci said
part of the problem is injuries. Gee, in  &UR; football? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   He said, ``We're looking for a way to healthy-up ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Is Mariucci channeling Mammy Yokum?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Steve oughtta fuss 'round the kitchen and rustle up a mess
o' vittles, put some meat on the bones of them football hombres o'
his'n.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe help can be found in the photo-op backdrop used at
Mariucci's press conferences. The 49er logo is interspersed with
the logo of a team sponsor. ``This sponsor is what the team needs
to hold it all together this season,'' Lou Bristol points out:
``Staples.''
</P>
<P>
   IN NEON, VERITAS: The United repair hangar on the Bay side of
101 has a huge neon sign, and the second ``n'' is burned out.
</P>
<P>
   Sonja Hyams noticed it, and having suffered many delays and
cancellations on United Shuttle, assumed it was a simple
confession: UNITED AIR LI ES.
</P>
<P>
   PLEASE, MARLA, don't tarnish our image of the Don:
</P>
<P>
   Marla Maples, ex-wife of Donald Trump, vows that if he runs for
president, she'll tell the world what he ``is really like.''
</P>
<P>
   Isn't that like Hillary threatening to tell the truth about
Bill?
</P>
<P>
   Here's a story going around: Trump finds himself alone in an
elevator with a beautiful woman. She tells him how much she admires
him, offers to do a Lewinsky right there in the elevator.
</P>
<P>
   Trump says, ``OK, but what's in it for me?''
</P>
<P>
   IT WAS SAD when a delivery van driver knocked over the ancient
sidewalk clock in North Beach. Although, realistically, the clock
has Roman numerals and hands, so within 10 years there won't be
anyone around who could read it.
</P>
<P>
   Based on early reports, the driver won't be cited. Shouldn't he
at least be ordered into a diversion program for dangerously lousy
drivers, or for clock abusers? That was a big clock, a million
people have parked there without clonking it. And it could have
been a baby stroller.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why is no one being held responsible for this?'' asks Daniel
DeTori, who phoned to protest.
</P>
<P>
   I guess DeTori thinks the driver should do some time.
</P>
<P>
   THE SCALES of justice can be messier than the scales of a dead
halibut, but it wouldn't seem fair to punish a careless driver in
the same week when John and Patsy Ramsey get cleared by a Boulder
grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Says Jim Greene, ``The Ramseys should think about pooling their
resources with O.J. and looking for all the real killers.''
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU WANT a policewoman in San Francisco, buddy, you have to
travel back in time.
</P>
<P>
   Sergeant Leanna Dawydiak, SFPD, notes my recent mention of a
``policewoman,'' and points out that years ago, before women were
allowed to be full-fledged S.F. cops, they could hire on for a desk
job classified as Q-20, or ``policewoman.'' No street work, no
promotions.
</P>
<P>
   Now, S.F. police officers _ men, women and misc. _ are police
officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't just about being politically correct,'' Dawydiak
notes, correctly, ``it's also about giving us the respect of the
title we had to go to court to attain.''
</P>
<P>
   One thick skull, penetrated.
</P>
<P>
   NO PENCILS, no books, and now:
</P>
<P>
   A school board meeting at Everett Middle School was called to
order and the board president asked everyone to stand for the
Pledge of Allegiance.
</P>
<P>
   Several hundred people stood, and glanced about, looking for the
flag. Didn't find it. Sat down. No pledge.
</P>
<P>
   SOOO MARIN: A want ad in the Marin Independent Journal, for a
'90 Volvo: ``Silver, 5-spd., A/C, phone, sunroof ... Great au pair
car.''
</P>
<P>
   MAYBE THIS will help the 49ers healthy-up, in lieu of chicken
soup:
</P>
<P>
   Dippy Foods, Inc. (Motto: ``Respect us, dammit!'') will soon be
supplying Candlestick Park beer carts with ``fresh, prepackaged
nacho, cheese and salsa meals called `Dippers.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the answer to the age-old question: ``If we can put a
man on the moon, why can't we can't find a way to make ballpark
nachos look and taste even more pre-fab?''
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure how the Dippy nacho cheese will get melted, 49er
fans, so just in case, BYO magnifying glass.

MORGAN STANLEY TO OFFER ONLINE TRADING TO ALL ITS CUSTOMERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  (ART ADV:  Graphic  is being sent to NYT graphics clients.
Non-subscribers may make individual purchase by calling (888)
603-1036 or (888) 346-9867.) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN and PATRICK McGEEHAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In old-line Wall Street's latest entry into the Internet
stock-trading bazaar, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter is preparing to
introduce an overhaul of its brokerage business and to offer all
its clients the option of buying and selling stocks online at
discount prices.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, expected to be announced as early as this week, is
similar to an offering put forward in June by Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co.,
the country's largest brokerage house. But Morgan Stanley hopes to
ambush Merrill by giving all its customers an online trading option
immediately, beating Merrill's planned start date by at least six
weeks, people close to Morgan Stanley said.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley already operates Discover Brokerage Direct, an
online discount broker. Its new plan envisions eliminating Discover
as a separate unit and rolling it together with traditional
brokerage services provided by Morgan Stanley's 11,000 full-service
brokers. Renamed Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Online, the electronic
service will be available either a la carte, for $29.95 a trade, or
as part of a full-service brokerage account that carries an annual
fee based on assets.
</P>
<P>
   The firm will also take a page from Charles Schwab, the leading
online broker, by converting the 450 nationwide branch offices
where its brokers work into walk-in retail centers. All its
brokerage customers will be able to deposit checks, research
stocks, get a consultation or meet with their broker, people close
to Morgan Stanley said. A spokesman for the firm declined to
comment on any aspect of the plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Morgan Stanley thinks it is really going to be a game of
segmenting the market going forward,'' said Steve Galbraith, an
analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein &AMP; Co., who said he had heard an
outline of the planned overhaul. ``They think you have to be able
to cater to all segments of the wallet.''
</P>
<P>
   The move marks a significant strategic shift by Morgan Stanley
that carries several risks. By offering its full-service customers
the option of trading online for a fraction of the price they pay
in commissions now, Morgan Stanley may suffer a sizable drop in the
revenue it gets from commissions, at least in the short term.
</P>
<P>
   Discover brokerage clients will also be slapped with a rare
price increase in the ultra-competitive online brokerage business,
where Discover has already been losing market share. At $29.95,
Morgan Stanley has set its new online commissions to match Schwab
and Merrill, making that the high-end benchmark. Discover Brokerage
Direct has been charging $14.95 for most stock trades, already
higher than the $5 to $8 commissions of rock-bottom online
discounters.
</P>
<P>
   People close to Morgan Stanley said that the firm expects
Discover _ famous for its get-rich-instantly ads featuring a
tow-truck driver who owns a tropical island and a schoolboy who
flies his own helicopter _ to lose some of its online customers
when it doubles the cost of trading. But they said many others
would pay the higher commissions because Morgan Stanley will now
offer them an enriched selection of its stock research and more
access to initial public offerings of issues underwritten by its
blue-chip investment bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will pay more, but they will get more,'' one person close
to the firm said.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley was the first traditional Wall Street firm to dip
its toes in the waters of online retail stock trading when it
bought Lombard Brokerage, a small San Francisco-based company, in
1996. But it held the operation at arm's length, naming it after
its Discover credit card and never integrating it with the firm's
much larger full-service operation. Though some Discover customers
have had access to Morgan Stanley's highly valued stock research,
for example, Morgan Stanley took its name off the research reports
and made them available online after a delay to avoid angering
full-service brokers and customers.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley spent tens of millions of dollars promoting the
Discover brokerage business on television, in print and online in
recent years. That investment seemed predicated in part on the
belief that online stock trading was a separate subset of the
brokerage business.
</P>
<P>
   Like Merrill Lynch, however, Morgan Stanley has found that
online stock trading is more fundamental than that, forcing it to
overhaul its operations sooner and more completely than its
executives had envisioned only a year ago. People close to Morgan
Stanley said that the firm was most worried about the rapid growth
of Schwab, which combines inexpensive online trading with efficient
call centers and help lines and has lured customers away from all
the major brokerage firms.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways Morgan Stanley's overhaul is similar to one that
Merrill announced June 1 and expects to finish introducing on Dec.
1. But Morgan Stanley is hoping to steal Merrill's thunder with its
coming announcement because it thinks it can offer all its retail
brokerage customers access to Discover's online trading platform
immediately, while Merrill promoted its plan months before it had
prepared the technology to offer the service.
</P>
<P>
   People close to Morgan Stanley also said that the firm expected
its plan would cause less internal dissent than was the case at
Merrill, where an unusually large number of brokers have defected
to rivals since the firm announced its new online trading platform
and pricing structure. The key, these people said, is that Morgan
Stanley will offer a broad array of pricing options that gives
brokers more discretion in how much they charge each customer.
</P>
<P>
   For an asset-based fee of at least $1,500 a year, Merrill Lynch
is offering unlimited trading of stocks and bonds either through
its brokers or online. Merrill also said it would introduce an
online trading service called Merrill Lynch Direct, with individual
trades for $29.95. Some Merrill brokers have rebelled because the
new pricing structure reduces how much they make from some of their
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley has addressed that issue by allowing brokers to
negotiate prices with customers who want some combination of
self-directed online trading and help from a broker. Customers who
want such a combination will be charged a percentage of the money
they invest with the firm that ranges from less than a half-percent
to 2 percent a year. The fees will vary based on the amount of
assets and the discretion of the broker involved.
</P>
<P>
   Customers who want to trade online with little or no help from a
broker will be charged $29.95 a trade. Full-service customers who
do not want to trade online will still have the option of paying
higher commissions for broker-directed trading, as they have in the
past.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley's announcement puts fresh pressure on other
full-service brokerage houses to make online trading available to
all customers who want it. But some rivals say they are not
planning to offer deeply discounted stock trading.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Salomon Smith Barney unit of Citigroup, for example, is
planning to introduce online trading by early next month. But the
service will be offered only to customers in fee-based or
traditional brokerage accounts, not at a discount.
</P>
<P>
   Another traditional brokerage firm, Paine Webber Group, is
introducing an account that allows clients who invest at least
$100,000 and pay an annual fee to make as many trades as they want,
either online or through their brokers. But Paine Webber has not
set up a separate online-trading service.
</P>
<P>
   Paine Webber executives stressed that their new account, called
Insight One, gave brokers more ``flexibility'' in pricing brokerage
services than Merrill is allowing its brokers. Donald Marron, Paine
Webber's chief executive, said the firm kept about $1 annually of
every $100 invested with it, and he did not expect that ratio to
decline because of the new account.

ADVERTISING: AN AMBITIOUS WEB PROJECT BY THE FOUR A'S 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The trade organization representing the nation's advertising
agencies is planning one of its most ambitious projects ever,
providing information online about members that could help them
land new clients.
</P>
<P>
   The American Association of Advertising Agencies, known as the
Four A's, plans to announce Monday its sponsorship of what is
intended to be a nonpartisan, nonprofit database devoted to new
business. The purpose is to assist marketers considering or
conducting account reviews as well as agency search consultants who
work for marketers on such reviews by making it easier for them to
learn about member agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal is to set up a central resource balanced for all
agencies, a level playing field,'' said Cleve Langton, executive
vice president and director for worldwide business development at
DDB Worldwide Communications Group in New York, owned by Omnicom
Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``This big step forward is the logical outgrowth of everything
we've been doing the last two years,'' said Langton, referring to
the new business committee of the Four A's, which he heads as
chairman.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's work has included issuing guidelines to govern
conduct during reviews and creating a standardized questionnaire to
gather information from agencies taking part in reviews. Those
steps were in response to what many agency executives perceive as
inequities in the search process, particularly the increasing power
of the independent search consultants who collect data about agency
operations during the reviews they oversee.
</P>
<P>
   The Four A's database ``is not meant to compete with or be in
conflict with consultants,'' said Peter Drakoulias, a member of the
new business committee who is a partner and director for business
development at Deutsch Inc. in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is based on what the Web is all about, providing as much
information to as many people as you can,'' he added. ``And the
fact that it's `brought to you by' the Four A's makes it fair and
unbiased.''
</P>
<P>
   One search consultant is skeptical of the new venture.
</P>
<P>
   ``We welcome any additional source of information to help
clients profile agencies,'' said Skip Pile, chairman of Pile &AMP; Co.
in Boston, ``but it feels a little adversarial and redundant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Picking an agency using an online membership directory,'' said
Pile, who also sponsors an agency database (www.agencycompile.com),
``is like trying to pick an architect by using the yellow pages.''
</P>
<P>
   Given that Pile's Web site is just one of several similar
services, both nonprofit and commercial, already dedicated to
account reviews and new business, should the Four A's project have
a Web address of www.toolittletoolate.org?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not at all,'' said O. Burtch Drake, president and chief
executive of the agency association in New York. ``It's important
that the industry have a site.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been doing a lot of work in the new business area,'' he
added, referring to projects like the guidelines and the
questionnaire. ``The Four A's new business Web site takes our
efforts to ease the agency search process to the next level.''
</P>
<P>
   Four A's members will be charged one-time fees ranging from $500
to $5,000 _ based on agency gross income _ to defray the start-up
costs of the Web site, Drake said, adding that the association
would ``put in some of our own money, too.'' Drake estimated the
start-up costs at $250,000; Pile said it cost ``roughly a million
bucks'' to get his site up and running.
</P>
<P>
   To build and maintain the Four A's database, members of the new
business committee selected a fledgling New York agency named
Little Tornadoes. The decision came after _ yes, a review.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really felt like a client,'' said Joanne Davis, a committee
member who is managing partner at Bozell Group in New York, a unit
of True North Communications.
</P>
<P>
   ``God, was it exciting to be on the other side,'' she added. ``I
particularly liked asking, `Are you the people who will work on our
account?'''
</P>
<P>
   One of those people, Spencer Hayman, president of Little
Tornadoes _ named for a band in which he played in college _ said:
``We made a 20-minute presentation and then spent an hour and a
half answering questions. It was like facing the Jedi Council as a
rookie knight.''
</P>
<P>
   Plans call for the new business Web site to be ready in February
or March on a section of the current Four A's Web site
(www.aaaa.org), Hayman said, as well as ``having its own unique
reference, as a `dot-com' as well as a `dot-org.'''
</P>
<P>
   Other features being considered, he added, include so-called hot
links to agencies' own Web sites and the sorting of agencies by
categories like size, location, specialty, type of clients _ even
the names of brands for which agencies create campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Hayman opened Little Tornadoes after he left Grybauskas Beatrice
in New York, where he helped start another fancifully named
interactive unit, Blue Dingo Digital. Other clients of Little
Tornadoes include British Airways, the Carnegie Endowment and
Junior's, the Brooklyn restaurant-delicatessen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're working on a site to sell Junior's cheesecake,'' Hayman
said, ``which has put about an inch on my waist already.''

FLOOZ GETS HELP FROM WHOOPI GOLDBERG  
 A BEAUTY ON THE BOARD  
 Y2K WARRIORS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The actress Whoopi Goldberg has just signed on to be the chief
promoter of a form of online gift currency. By using her celebrity
in exchange for stock in the company, Ms. Goldberg adds her name to
a list of cyberrepresentatives that already includes the former
``Star Trek'' actor William Shatner and the tennis star Anna
Kournikova.
</P>
<P>
   The Goldberg deal involves ads on television, radio and
billboards that feature the actress promoting Flooz, a new
Web-based gift certificate system that the company with the same
name hopes will someday become a household word.
</P>
<P>
   The company gets its name from a slang term for money in the
Mediterranean region, according to Robert Levitan, co-founder of
Flooz Inc., which is based in New York. Previously, Levitan was
co-founder of the iVillage online network for women.
</P>
<P>
   Flooz works much like any gift certificate except that it is
redeemable only online, at least for now. Some 60 online merchants
have already signed up as stores that accept Flooz, including
Godiva chocolates, Tower Records and Fogdog Sports. Eventually,
Levitan said, people will also be able to redeem Flooz in
conventional stores.
</P>
<P>
   To give Flooz, someone enters a credit card number in a form on
the Flooz.com Web site and specifies how much they want to give.
Flooz then establishes a Flooz account in the recipient's name and
notifies the recipient of the gift by e-mail. The recipient then
receives a Flooz account number, which can be used for making
purchases.
</P>
<P>
   Levitan said the company approached Ms. Goldberg because her
public image was consistent with that of Flooz.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're both irreverent, hip and fun but also trusted and
respectable brands,'' Levitan said. In exchange for lending her
name to Flooz's ad campaign, Ms. Goldberg has become the company's
largest shareholder outside its founding circle and financing
group, Levitan said, declining to discuss specific figures.

   Trying to Draw Eyes to a New Web Site
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of cybercelebrities, Cindy Crawford, who has turned
heads on the fashion runway, will now try to draw eyes to a Web
site.
</P>
<P>
   The model has been named to the board and given stock in Estyle
Inc., a privately held start-up that sells baby goods and clothing
on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Laurie McCartney, founder and president of the Los Angeles
company, insisted that Ms. Crawford was not acting as a mere
celebrity spokeswoman but as a bona fide strategic partner,
advising on strategy and using her contacts with designers. ``We
really see her as a very savvy, very smart businesswoman,'' Ms.
McCartney said.
</P>
<P>
   The company's Web site, babystyle.com, includes Cindy's Corner,
in which the model writes of her favorite fashionable maternity
clothes and recommends baby products based on her three and a half
months of experience as a first-time mother.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Crawford, 33, agreed to join Estyle when she was approached
while pregnant. ``Being really in the moment of that, I really
believe in the project,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Far from being an experienced businesswoman, though, Ms.
Crawford said she was learning a lot from board room discussions
about distribution, fulfillment and different classes of stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my business college,'' said Ms. Crawford, adding that
her modeling jobs at Revlon and other places rarely gave her the
chance to participate in business decisions. ``Occasionally, I get
to put my 2 cents in about where the advertising should go,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Crawford is also on the board of 24 Hour Fitness, a health
club chain, and has her own fan Web site, cindy.com. She said
models must make preparations while they are in their prime for
when they are older and no longer in high demand.
</P>
<P>
   Strategic partnering aside, some of Ms. Crawford's duties at
Estyle cannot seem unfamiliar. Last week, she walked down a red
carpet as hostess at the company's coming-out party.

   Brief Flurry Over Year 2000 Bug
</P>
<P>
   Activists calling for more aggressive preparations for Year 2000
computer disruptions have been extremely frustrated at the general
apathy they have encountered and, as a result, the increasing
difficulty of getting media coverage for their message.
</P>
<P>
   That frustration boiled over on Oct. 3 in San Francisco, where a
small protest group, despairing of getting attention for their
concerns about Year 2000 readiness of nuclear power and weapons
systems, decided to parade naked through downtown.
</P>
<P>
   The brief march was led by Dr. Patch Adams, the iconoclastic
physician who inspired the recent movie based on his life, and
Helen Caldicott, a noted figure in the antinuclear movement. It
slowed traffic, made headlines and was ignored by police. It also
generated plenty of conversation among Year 2000 campaigners
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more extended reflections came from Jay Golter,
acting president of the Northern Virginia Y2K Community Action
Group, who apparently has not lost his sense of humor despite the
many months of being ignored by most of his neighbors. In his
organization's latest newsletter, Golter wrote:
</P>
<P>
   ``Many aspects of Y2K organizing have been demoralizing. In my
own case, when our group started, I had suspected that I had a face
made for radio. When I had the opportunity to call in to the WAMU
radio show `Public Interest' during a program they did on Y2K, I
could listen to the audio file of that program. I then realized
that I have a voice made to be a writer. However, an entire
lifetime of experiences has led me to understand that I have a
physique made to be fully clothed.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, after describing the news from San Francisco and referring
the newsletter's readers to Web sites with further coverage, Golter
concluded: ``I still believe that nudity is a weapon in our public
relations arsenal that should remain sheathed. However, if any of
you decide otherwise, be sure to let me know in advance where and
when you will be demonstrating this large `measure of devotion' to
the cause. I'll be the guy wearing dark glasses, or a mask, or a
bag over my face, or...''

RIDING THE TRAFFIC SURGES ON THE WORLD WIDE WEB 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By BOB TEDESCHI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Part of what has made e-commerce one of the most compelling
spectator sports of the year is this fact: No matter how much
experience executives have had running multimillion-dollar
companies in other industries, when it comes to Web retailing, many
of them are still making things up as they go along.
</P>
<P>
   A case in point is anticipating and preparing for changing
traffic patterns on the World Wide Web. While traditional retailers
can say precisely when and why their customers arrive _ and can
maximize their efficiency accordingly _ Internet merchants have
frequently been caught by surprise in the past year by traffic
surges.
</P>
<P>
   As e-commerce merchants brace for their second meaningful
holiday shopping season, however, they are beginning to decipher
some of the rhythms of their Internet shoppers. Namely, while Web
traffic in general becomes heavier as the day goes on, many
Internet retailers report that traffic is actually heaviest during
the middle of the day, between 2 p.m. and 3 p.m. EST _ suggesting
that workers blessed with high-speed Internet connections remain
anchored to their desks at lunch time, sandwich in one hand, mouse
in the other.
</P>
<P>
   So, with the holidays rapidly approaching, some retailers are
shoring up their sites' technological infrastructure and hoping
they have enough capacity to handle the midday traffic smoothly.
Others, meanwhile, are looking beyond the back-office technology
issues into marketing opportunities presented by the 9-to-5 set.
</P>
<P>
   For that matter, not every retail site is subjected to the same
midday shopping rush, analysts and executives said, because other
factors help determine the peaks as well. The type of goods sold
and the type of consumer the company attracts, for example, can
also affect a site's traffic patterns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lower-consideration purchases like books, gifts or flowers are
much more likely to be made during the daytime hours, since people
tend to see those things as a task that can be done quickly,'' said
Melissa Shore, an analyst with Jupiter Communications. ``With
things like computers, people will do a lot of research and then go
home and talk it over with their significant other or see if it's
compatible with their system, then go online and buy it.''
</P>
<P>
   Travelocity, a travel site owned by the AMR Corp. that recently
announced a merger agreement with Preview Travel, peaks at 3 p.m.
EST, according to Terrell Jones, Travelocity's president. ``There
are a lot of busy dual-income families who can't book something at
night, when most travel agents are closed,'' he said.``And the
high-speed access at work certainly has an effect.''
</P>
<P>
   But marketing is also a factor, Jones said. Preview Travel
advertises heavily on America Online, which has heavier traffic
during the evening hours. ``So Preview's activity tends to be later
also. We're on Yahoo, which tends to peak earlier in the day,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Handling those peaks, of course, requires resources. Just as
brick-and-mortar stores plan for heavier shopping times by
scheduling more staff, Internet retailers need to rely on more
technology and personnel to get them through the rush. The great
fear of all Web merchants is that a traffic surge will catch them
by surprise _ landing them in the inauspicious company of Ebay,
Toysrus.com and ETrade as examples of sites that have occasionally
failed to handle their own peak loads.
</P>
<P>
   But even if a surge in users does not result in a system crash,
it can slow down the performance of a Web site sharply and alienate
potential customers. ``Our primary concern is making sure we can
handle all the traffic that doesn't come evenly,'' said Gabe Fried,
manager of research at Toysmart, an online toy retailer. That job,
he said, is complicated by the fact that traffic trends can change
quickly in response to marketing efforts, like an early-morning
promotion Toysmart recently began with Sesame Street.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign yielded ``a rather large shift in our peak hours
and processing hours,'' Fried said, but with beneficial results:
the site's traffic is now distributed more evenly through the day.
``That's better for us because it means less of a load on our
servers,'' he said, ``and better for users because the fewer of
them we have at one time, the faster the site is.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Web sites with less predictable traffic patterns could be in for
a long holiday season, said Jeff Nickerson, a partner in the
electronic business practice at PricewaterhouseCoopers. ``Last
holiday season, there were a lot of sites that were shocked, and
the consumers were a bit forgiving,'' he said. ``This time around,
there are so many more merchants that if stuff doesn't perform
well, sites will lose money big time.''
</P>
<P>
   More aggressive Web retailers, meanwhile, are looking into ways
to cash in on Internet users' lunchtime shopping habits.
Brookstone, which sells through its Web site, catalogs and stores,
is planning a radio advertising campaign that may include lunchtime
advertising, a spokesman said. Others are considering scheduling
more banner advertisements to be displayed on various Web pages
during lunchtime.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike radio and television broadcasters, however, not every
Internet publisher _ not even America Online _ has the
technological means to serve a banner ad for a specific time slot.
</P>
<P>
   But the technology is available. The Internet advertising
company Doubleclick enables the 8,000 sites in its network _ and
others that license the company's technology _ to serve ads
whenever they want, a company spokeswoman said. Thus far, she said,
the service has been most popular with financial advertisers, which
typically want their ads to appear mainly between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could argue that, yes, it does matter,'' said Nickerson,
of PricewaterhouseCoopers. ``People are more likely to buy during
these times than in other parts of the day. It's like the Internet
rush hour.''
</P>
<P>
   Since so many people are shopping at work, one would expect the
companies already involved with workplace Internet access to seek a
piece of the action. According to Ms. Shore of Jupiter, they may
get it. She predicted that e-commerce sites would start joining
forces with companies that set up intranet sites for corporations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's say Amazon partnered with Peoplesoft, which puts
together a customized intranet for Time Warner,'' she said.
``Amazon could get massive exposure to Time Warner's employees, and
Time Warner could get discounts from Amazon that they could pass
onto their employees as a benefit. It makes sense for everyone.''

SUPPORTERS OF LINUX WORRY THAT COMMERCIALIZATION COULD BRING
CHAOS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Graying nerds who recall the Balkanization of Unix into a slew
of incompatible operating systems may be reliving history with the
proliferation of Linux brands.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Unix once promised to be the lingua franca of open
systems, the Linux operating system, itself a variant of Unix, has
been held out as standard for the open-source movement. But there
is growing concern that just as the Unix world slid into chaos like
a modern Tower of Babel, the commercialization of Linux will lead
to systems that cannot understand each other.
</P>
<P>
   Open systems promised to free computer users from the software
tyranny of hardware systems like the IBM's mainframes and the
Digital Equipment's minicomputers.
</P>
<P>
   Open-source software is based on the concept of making a
program's underlying code freely available and readily modifiable
by anyone. It has been promoted as a way of challenging the
dominance of the Microsoft's Windows.
</P>
<P>
   But fear and greed have a way of derailing good intentions. Unix
was created in 1969 by Kenneth Thompson and Dennis Ritchie at
AT&AMP;T's Bell Laboratories; the first popular variant, Berkeley Unix,
came along 10 years later, and it was followed by sundry
variations: Sun's Solaris, Hewlett-Packard's HP-UX, IBM's AIX,
Silicon Graphics' Irix. Some shared code but could not run the same
applications. Thus, programs like Web server software must be
rewritten for each Unix brand.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Linux grew out of the GNU Project, an effort to
create a free, Unix-like operating system. GNU created many
critical components of the system, but it lacked a kernel _ the
core piece regulating the movement of data _ until Linus Torvalds,
the Finnish programmer, created one in 1991 and named it after
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Although Linux and the GNU components can be downloaded free,
more than 22 companies today sell GNU/Linux software. The best
known are Red Hat, Suse, Turbo Linux, Caldera Systems and Mandrake
Soft. Last week, Silicon Graphics, VA Linux Systems and O'Reilly &AMP;
Co., a publisher of computer books, announced a plan to sell Debian
GNU/Linux, considered by some to be the purest version.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, these companies were founded largely on service
models, giving information technology managers someone to call _ or
blame _ when things went wrong. But each also packages Linux
differently, adding its own set of software tools for tasks like
diagnosing problems and maintaining networks. With so many
companies struggling to differentiate themselves, some experts say
incompatibilities are inevitable.

   ``They say that Balkanization is not as possible with Linux as
it was with Unix because Linus and the guys are controlling it,''
said Maureen O'Gara, publisher of Client Server News, a trade
publication. But some vendors, she said, ``are more inclined to
chase money and less inclined to share all their toys with their
friends.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They have some proprietary stuff they've developed and are
reluctant to put it in the public domain,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Others disagree. ``Only the trade press is really squeaking
about this,'' said Eric S. Raymond, president of the Open Source
Initiative, a programmer group, because it makes a good story hook
when you have nothing real to write about and the advertising
department is pressuring you to make closed-software vendors look
good.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond added: ``The actual Linux developers know better.
Fragmentation isn't going to happen, because developers outside of
the Linux distributors effectively control all the key pieces.''
That is because Torvalds and a small group of his colleagues
control the Linux standard and subject all modifications to peer
review.
</P>
<P>
   But Linux vendors are already pointing fingers.
</P>
<P>
   ``One where you might see a problem is Caldera, because they see
part of their value added in proprietary tools they have licensed
from third parties,'' said Bob Young, Red Hat's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Benoy Tamang, Caldera's vice president for marketing, counters:
``We have produced a product that combines the best of open-source
and commercial packages; we are doing Linux for business. We do add
to it commercial packages that allow business users to easily
integrate it.''
</P>
<P>
   For example. he said, Caldera adds parts of Netware, Novell's
popular network operating system, which has long been an industry
standard for large corporations.
</P>
<P>
   There are also debates about which public domain tools to
include in a Linux distribution, as devotees prefer to call these
commercial packages. The biggest split is over two competing
graphical user interfaces: KDE, the oldest and the more mature, and
Gnome, an alternative introduced by the Free Software Foundation,
sponsor of the GNU Project, and Red Hat.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to head off further conflicts, nearly all the
Linux vendors have joined the Linux Standard Base project, whose
goal is to increase compatibility and insure that software will run
on any compliant Linux system. The project aims to define the core
functions of Linux by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Quinlan, chairman of the Linux Standard Base, said that so
far, most Linux developers have no incentive to introduce
incompatibilities, which was not the case with Unix. Most Unix
vendors, he pointed out, ``were selling a hardware platform of
their own, so right off the bat you had a hardware
incompatibility.''
</P>
<P>
   There ``wasn't a huge advantage'' for different hardware makers
to cooperate, he said, whereas for the most part Linux runs on
machines using Intel microprocessors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's possible that sooner or later there will be a conflict
between adding functionality and compatibility,'' Quinlan
acknowledged, but he added, ``It's not high on my list of
worries.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   The last time Robert Westmoreland promoted a new computer-game
concept, the industry first laughed but then chased him, after his
idea proved a huge winner. And starting Monday, he hopes that
history repeats itself _ the Lord and the marketplace willing.
</P>
<P>
   The fresh gaming idea he is pushing now? Christian action games.
And his company's first entry, The War in Heaven, is being shipped
to stores this week. Whether this Doom-meets-the-Bible game will be
a success is anybody's guess. Yet the 32-year-old Westmoreland has
a track record as someone with an instinct for popular tastes in a
game market that is broadening beyond its technophile roots _ a
byproduct of the spread of personal computers into more and more
American households thanks to fast-falling PC prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may sicken traditional gamers, but my gut feel is that this
game will be a hit,'' said Ann Stephens, president of PC Data Inc.,
a research firm which tracks the $1.5 billion-a-year PC game
market. ``Besides, it sounds a lot more interesting than the last
idea he championed.''
</P>
<P>
   Westmoreland's last unconventional stance came a few years ago
when, as the computer software buyer for Wal-Mart Stores Inc., he
prodded the industry to make budget-priced hunting games. At first,
his suggestion met bemused derision. But one adventurous
computer-game publisher listened, and the result was Deer Hunter, a
surprise best seller, prompting a flurry of hunting games and even
a spoof title, Deer Avenger, in which the buck stalks the hunter.
</P>
<P>
   So next comes the Christian action game. The War in Heaven is
published by Valusoft, which Westmoreland joined in September,
after leaving Wal-Mart, as part-owner and executive vice president
of marketing and development.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, software with a Christian theme has tended to be
staid and didactic, mainly Bibles and children's games that quiz
players on their Bible knowledge. What qualified as a big-budget,
entertainment product in the Christian niche was ``Charlton
Heston's Voyage Through the Bible,'' a CD-ROM released in 1995,
with readings by Heston and video clips of the Holy Land.
</P>
<P>
   By the standards of the genre, The War in Heaven is a striking
departure. In the action game, intended for Christian males 15 and
older, a player is confronted with snarling monsters, with horns
and wings, wielding swords and other lethal weapons. That is the
challenge if the player chooses ``the Divine Path of Obedience,''
becomes a good angel and progresses up the game's 12-step ascent to
heaven. Yet a player can also choose ``the Fallen Path of Power and
follow Lucifer,'' become a demon and fight against shapely blondes
with feathery wings.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you mention that it's a Christian game, people assume
there's no violence,'' Westmoreland observed. ``Sure, there's
violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he notes, there are no gushers of blood and gore, so
frequent in games rated for adults only. The War in Heaven is rated
``T'' by the Entertainment Software Rating Board, which means it is
recommended as suitable for people 13 and older.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the game reaches store shelves, its playful approach
to religious instruction has raised eyebrows in the Christian
community and elicited qualms from some retail chains. But the two
young men who created The War In Heaven _ Theodore Beale and Andrew
Lunstad, cofounders of the software design firm Eternal Warriors _
say that they have merely tried to create a Christian game that
might appeal to a broad audience among computer gamers reared on
the likes of Doom and Diablo.
</P>
<P>
   The violence, they add, is a role-playing depiction of
``spiritual warfare,'' a concept that has made some inroads into
mainstream theology. Spiritual warfare, theologians explain, is the
notion that nonphysical agents of good and evil are constantly at
war and that their behavior affects people on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Valusoft does publish some irreverent games, like Lawyer Hunt,
but the company insists The War in Heaven is not among them. And
both of the game's creators are devout Christians who say there
should be no contradiction in having fun on a computer game and
learning spiritual truths.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly, this is a spooky thing to be attempting in some
ways,'' said Lunstad, 30, who was the chief programmer for the
game. ``And let's face it, when you have angels fighting demons, it
is going to be controversial.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' he added, ``I truly feel that God called me to do
this.''
</P>
<P>
   To explain the instructional side of the game, Lunstad said that
if a person chooses to play as a demon, he progresses by disobeying
the Bible. ``But as you progress down the evil path, you have to do
things that are more and more distasteful, from blasphemy to
striking a praying angel,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   Without giving away the game, Lunstad noted that the evil path
leads to self-destruction. ``And Theo and I really believe that to
be true,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Boyd, a theology professor at Bethel College, finds the
new computer game impressive. A scholar with graduate degrees from
the Yale Divinity School and the Princeton Theological Seminary,
Boyd is the author of ``God At War: The Bible and Spiritual
Conflict'' (Intervarsity Press, 1997), which made the case for
spiritual warfare being a serious theological concept.
</P>
<P>
   Boyd also has a 14-year-old son, Nathan, who has played a test
version of The War in Heaven. ``He loved it,'' Boyd said. ``He
compared it to Doom, except with a spiritual twist.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The early reaction from Christian groups seems to be guarded,
though not antagonistic. ``Our concern would be if this game mocked
people of faith in any way,'' said Mike Russell, a spokesman for
the Christian Coalition. ``It doesn't sound as if it does, though
it does seem to take a pretty unique approach to religious
education.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the big retail chains are apparently taking a
wait-and-see stance toward the game, aware that customers can be
unpredictably sensitive about products with religious themes. Wim
Stocks, a senior vice president at GT Interactive, the distributor
for The War in Heaven, said last week that many major chains had
agreed to distribute the game, but several were sitting on the
fence. ``Some of the chains are nervous,'' said Stocks, who
declined to name the retailers carrying the game or those balking.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Priced at $19.95, less than half the price of traditional adult
PC games, The War in Heaven meets the industry definition of a
budget game _ a fast-growing slice of the market, built largely on
sales at big discount chains like Wal-mart, Target and Kmart.
</P>
<P>
   Pocketbooks, a division of Viacom's Simon &AMP; Schuster book
publishing subsidiary, is betting on The War in Heaven. It is
publishing a mass-market paperback novel by the same title, written
by Beale, next spring. ``It's a good fantasy story, though
definitely one with a different take than most science fiction,''
said Scott Shannon, director of science fiction for Pocketbooks.
``And I thought it would be highly marketable.''
</P>
<P>
   If the game is successful, Westmoreland of Valusoft predicts
that Christian action games could become sizable segment of the PC
game business. ``There is plenty of source material,'' he observed.
``You need look no further than the Bible for battles.''

PATENTS: MAKING ONLINE DATA MORE ACCESSIBLE; PORTABLE POCKETS FOR 
ALL THAT GEAR
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By SABRA CHARTRAND   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   This may be the digital age, but even as technology spreads,
people are left out _ some because they cannot afford the hardware
and services needed for joining the information era, but others
because they don't like or can't master computers.
</P>
<P>
   Three inventors have patented a system that allows those who
haven't made the leap from printed paper to computer screens to
receive digital data on their televisions simply by turning the
pages of a book, newspaper or magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Spencer Rathus and Lois Fichner-Rathus, both from Short Hills,
N.J., and Jeffrey Nevid of New York City, figured that just about
everyone peruses books, magazines and catalogs. Many of the goods,
services, companies and organizations that now appear on Web sites
are also featured in printed advertisements and articles.
</P>
<P>
   So the three inventors decided that the computer-reluctant
public ought to be able to simply touch an icon printed on those
pages and access Web sites, databases and software. The icon
contains a sensor that sends a message requesting data from a
remote server.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, computer use continues to spread among
adults, and an argument can be made that an entire generation of
children exposed to computers at school, home and game arcades will
not shun them later in life. But the Rathuses and Nevid believe
that plenty of people will continue to be stymied by computers
``despite significant advances in user-interface technology such as
mouses, windows, menus and the like.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Indeed, it is clear that the number of programming choices
available to the user of such technology will be far greater than
the number of choices involved in programming a VCR, a task already
demonstrated to be too complicated for the average user of
present-day user-interface technology,'' they write in their
patent.
</P>
<P>
   The printed icon containing the sensor also holds a transmitter.
The sensor is activated by the turn of a page, the tap of a finger
or the pass of a pointer or mouse-style device. The transmitter
then sends a coded signal that identifies the icon to a
microprocessor. The microprocessor in turn forwards a command to a
remote video server.
</P>
<P>
   The inventors allow for many ways of accomplishing this last
link _ the command might travel via telephone, cable, modem,
satellite, cellular, microwave or infrared connections. The form
chosen depends on the bandwidth necessary to send the reply data.
The server sends the requested digital data to the user's
television or other monitor.
</P>
<P>
   The patent also covers use of a scanner that could read bar
codes or magnetic strips on a page and send a similar coded signal
to the microprocessor.
</P>
<P>
   The inventors say that people who shop through catalogs could
join the world of electronic commerce with their system. Instead of
accessing a retail Web site, a buyer could press sensors embedded
in a catalog and prompt the retailer's remote server to send sales
information to the buyer's TV or process an order.
</P>
<P>
   They also suggest that textbooks and other instructional
publications like cookbooks or manuals could come with sensors that
would link readers to databases or tutorials.
</P>
<P>
   The inventors say users would pay for the data either by volume,
like present online service providers, or according to the type of
material requested, like current cable television pay-per-view
programming. The developers received patent 5,932,863.
</P>
<P>
   A Portable Pocket for All That Gear
</P>
<P>
   Technology is supposed to make life easier, more efficient, more
timely. But it does create one problem: how to carry an assortment
that might include a cell phone, a personal organizer, a beeper and
other hardware. Not everyone wants to take a purse or briefcase
everywhere they go. Pockets are one answer, but not all garments
have the right size pockets in convenient places.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Jeffrey Richards offers his portable pocket. Richards, an
inventor from Las Vegas, has patented a pocket that can be added to
any piece of clothing, moved or removed completely, without
altering the clothes with adhesive or hook and loop fasteners like
Velcro.
</P>
<P>
   The pocket attaches to a base plate made of metal, rubber or
plastic, which in turn is affixed to a flat back plate. The back
plate is designed to be inserted under a garment, and the pocket
base plate rests on the outside of the garment. The fabric is
sandwiched between the two plates. The plates have male and female
attachment points and are held in place with multiple pins, snaps
or magnets, and a spring-loaded sliding lock so they don't move.
</P>
<P>
   The pocket _ which can have a flap or a zipper, or can hang open
_ hides the base. The back plate is adjustable to accommodate
different thicknesses of fabric. Richards received patent
5,946,732.
</P>
<P>
   Patents may be viewed on the Web at www.uspto.gov or may be
ordered through the mail, by patent number, for $3 from the Patent
and Trademark Office, Washington, DC 20231.

<P>
   Before his favorite football team started an Internet service,
Brett Fennell jumped from one online service to another. But when
the Baltimore Ravens offered Internet access with premium
information about the team, Fennell found a provider he plans to
keep.
</P>
<P>
   Not only does he get a chance to buy tickets ahead of the
general public, but he also receives statistics about the team
before the numbers reach the newspapers _ a great advantage in his
fantasy football league.
</P>
<P>
   Fennell, a 29-year-old who develops e-commerce strategies for
Airtouch Cellular in Atlanta, said the service allowed him to
choose the information that would be sent to him online.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't really like all the sales pop-up stuff that came with
all the other services,'' he said. ``The Ravens information is what
I want to get hit with.''
</P>
<P>
   But while Fennell's e-mail address and start-up page end with
raven.nfl.com, the Internet service provider, or ISP, he logs into
is PSINet. The Ravens are one of about 30 organizations that have
deals with PSINet to market an Internet service under the
organizations' own names.
</P>
<P>
   Tapping into consumers' loyalty to a group, a school, a team or
myriad other organizations or institutions could prove a boon to
profit-starved Internet service providers. Some analysts and
executives predict that in coming years these so-called ``affinity
ISP's'' will become the dominant way Internet services attract
subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   The attraction for the affinity groups is that they get a useful
marketing tool, and if they attract enough subscribers, they earn a
slim profit on each subscription.
</P>
<P>
   Any entity with followers, from church groups to rock stars, is
a likely candidate. David Bowie was one of the first celebrities to
create an Internet service; part of the appeal for subscribers is
that he drops in for online chats from time to time.
</P>
<P>
   Though the models vary, in most cases the affinity groups
receive their Internet service at a wholesale rate, then make money
on subscriptions by charging customers a higher rate. The affinity
groups also take a percentage of profits from products sold through
the service.
</P>
<P>
   Affinity ISP's represent a major savings in marketing costs for
Internet providers, reducing typical marketing costs of between
$100 and $150 to enroll each new subscriber to nearly nothing.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, increased subscriber loyalty can also cut the high
cost of churn. These days, Internet service providers can count on
losing one subscriber out of five in the course of a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, it's all about the customer relationship,'' said Zia
Daniell Wigder, an analyst for Jupiter Communications. ``All of
these players are trying to lock in the customer relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Early research shows that Internet users welcome the concept.
More than 47 percent of online households would switch to an
affinity service if offered incentives, according to a consumer
survey conducted by Jupiter Communications in March.
</P>
<P>
   That is why AT&AMP;T and the Concentric Network Corp., like PSINet,
are aggressively courting partners for affinity services as a way
to compete with America Online, which has more than 18 million
subscribers and 40 percent of the domestic market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're deadly serious about this being a very important part of
our Internet strategy,'' said Bruce Jackson, vice president of
Global Offering Management for AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   The company recently helped begin two high-profile affinity
programs: free Internet access from United Parcel Service and a
Spanish- and Portuguese-language Internet service for Star Media
that crosses national boundaries in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   The Baltimore Ravens hope to build community through their own
Internet service.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kind of view it as the ultimate fan club,'' said Kevin
Byrne, a spokesman for the team. ``We're going directly to our best
fans without going through the filter of the media.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the service is marketed as a way for fans to get news
about the team before it hits the newspapers. Subscribers are
offered the same level of information as the news media receive.
And in addition to priority access to tickets, they can chat with
coaches and players.
</P>
<P>
   The Ravens, now in their fourth season, have built a large
audience to whom the Internet service can be marketed. The first
target group was the 25,000 season ticket holders, followed by
leads from the 70,000 tickets that go to single-game ticket buyers.
For each subscription, the team receives $1 a month.
</P>
<P>
   So far, since April, fewer than 5,000 people have signed up for
the service. But the appeal has gained momentum since July, when
the team offered subscribers live video feeds from training camp.
During a three-day trial, 1,000 people downloaded the live feeds.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the ISP's that have moved aggressively into the affinity
market appear to have attracted a small proportion of their total
subscribers through such partnerships. PSINet's 30 groups,
including the Ravens, have brought in what one executive described
as ``the high tens of thousands'' of new customers. Concentric,
which has been in the affinity business since 1997, reports
bringing in 70,000 subscribers that way, while AT&AMP;T says it has
signed on about 120,000 subscribers through affinity services.
</P>
<P>
   Affinity groups, however, face potential pitfalls. Generally
they must guarantee to sign up a minimum number of subscribers to
secure discounted rates. If the groups fail to deliver the
subscribers in six to eight months, the rates increase.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten thousand would be a runaway success for an affinity,''
said Harry Lalor, director of wholesale management for PSINet. ``We
ask for 5,000.''
</P>
<P>
   With fewer subscribers than that, he said, the model is not
feasible.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, if the e-mail server crashes, customers are most
likely to blame the group whose name is on the service.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, more and more organizations are willing to take
those risks.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Parker of Lubbock, Texas, started a small affinity service
with several Internet partners last year. Parker put $3 million
into the company, a filtered service called Clean Web, and targeted
the Christian market. After spending $1.5 million on magazine
advertising, he attracted only 5,000 subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   Now he is changing his marketing strategy. He is putting
together a deal to provide a specialized affinity Internet service
for Women of Faith, a national women's Christian organization
similar to Promise Keepers. The numbers look encouraging: The
organization has 600,000 members, and 67 percent of them use the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Considering this kind of potential, Parker recently presented a
plan to investors that showed a way to deliver 500,000 subscribers
in 5 years. He could approach that figure just by signing a deal
with Women of Faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they are successful in converting a lot of them over,'' he
said, ``it doesn't take a lot of time to reach those kinds of
numbers.''

THREAT TO INTERNET SALES UNCORKS A NEW ALLIANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By CAROLYN LOCHHEAD   
 c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the geography of Washington lobbying, the
valleys Napa and Silicon share fame, cachet and that rawer
attribute, power.
</P>
<P>
   But there seemed little to join the interests of Cabernet and
computers until an assault on their mutual turf _ a bill to crack
down on Internet wine sales _ pushed the two powerful California
industries into an unusual alliance.
</P>
<P>
   The sponsors of the ``21st Amendment Enforcement Act'' say they
want to stop teenagers from buying booze in cyberspace. Wineries
contend the measure is actually aimed at protecting state liquor
wholesalers from direct sales of wine over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Napa Valley was losing badly, but Silicon Valley largely ignored
the dispute until the bill breezed through the House of
Representatives on August 3 after passing the Senate on a voice
vote.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, the high-tech industry suddenly realized that if
states could ban Internet wine sales, they might restrict other
electronic commerce as well, opening a Pandora's box of
product-targeted Internet regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Within a month of the bill's House passage, Palo Alto chipmaker
Intel Corp. _ whose stationery commands attention on Capitol Hill _
fired off a letter to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin
Hatch, the Utah Republican who has jurisdiction over the measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intel, like other companies that are collectively building the
`new economy' through the products and services which form the
infrastructure of e-commerce, has a great stake in the preservation
of an Internet free of discriminatory taxation and regulation,''
wrote F. Thomas Dunlap Jr., Intel's vice president for law and
government affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the arrival of reinforcements from Silicon Valley will
be enough to stop the wine bill, which awaits a House-Senate
conference to shape its final version, remains to be seen. But
winemakers are joyous.
</P>
<P>
   ``The high-tech community has galvanized support,'' said John
DeLuca, president of the Wine Institute, representing California
wineries. ``It's new strength for us, new power for us, and new
credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   While framed as a debate over how to stop alcohol sales to
minors, the wine fight bears all the marks of a classic Washington
special-interest battle, this one pitting vintners against
wholesalers.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's chief sponsor, Republican Rep. Joe Scarborough, hails
from Florida, headquarters of Southern Wine and Spirits of America,
the nation's largest liquor wholesaler. Florida is one of five
states that has made it a felony for manufacturers to sell
alcoholic beverages directly to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Scarborough's ``21st Amendment Protection Act'' is named after
the 1933 constitutional amendment that lifted federal Prohibition
and, in exchange, gave states the power to restrict alcohol sales.
In most states, those restrictions include bans or tight limits on
direct shipments of wine, beer or spirits to consumers. Most states
require alcoholic beverages to be sold through state-licensed
wholesale distributors and local retail outlets.
</P>
<P>
   (California permits residents to buy two cases of wine a month
from out-of-state wineries, if the state allows its own residents
to do the same.)
</P>
<P>
   For years, wineries battled in state legislatures to loosen the
restrictions, while wholesalers battled back to tighten them.
</P>
<P>
   The fight suddenly escalated with the arrival of the Internet,
which vastly widened the potential for consumers to buy wines _
often hard-to-find boutique labels that wholesalers don't carry _
directly from vintners. Wholesalers, arguing that state attorneys
general are unable to prosecute out-of-state wineries, went to
Congress to get a federal statute allowing them to sue wineries in
federal court.
</P>
<P>
   The political fault lines broke against the vintners from the
start. Although solid backing from the huge 54-member California
delegation usually gives winemakers the upper hand, local liquor
distributors dot every congressional district in the nation. With
the issue framed as a remedy for teenage drinking, the bill sailed
through the House 310 to 112.
</P>
<P>
   That set off a few alarms in Silicon Valley, which is acutely
aware that the explosive medium of the Internet threatens not just
the Prohibition-era liquor distribution system, but nearly all
traditional retail commerce.
</P>
<P>
   The Association for Interactive Media, representing America
Online, Yahoo, RealNetworks and other Internet companies, warned
Hatch that the wine bill could invite not just states, but even
nations, to restrict electronic commerce in the name of protecting
local laws and customs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other nations are eager to impose language requirements,
prohibitions against importing clothing that violates religious
customs and other idiosyncratic restrictions of electronic commerce
that disadvantage remote sellers,'' the trade group wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than seek the bill's outright defeat, Californians are
backing a House amendment inserted by Rep. Chris Cox, a Southern
California Republican and a savvy opponent of Internet regulation
and taxation.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Cox's amendment in effect could force states that want to
sue a winery to first prove that they are not discriminating
against Internet sellers to protect their own local industries.
This provision, based on the Constitution's interstate commerce
clause, could pose a big hurdle to the very state lawsuits that the
wine bill is intended to permit.
</P>
<P>
   Both Silicon and Napa valleys are now throwing their combined
weight behind the Cox amendment and are bringing politicians with
them, including Sens. Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Charles Schumer,
both New York Democrats. Whatever the final outcome, the wineries
are so pleased with their newfound friends in high tech that the
Wine Institute's DeLuca said he hopes to forge a formal alliance in
the next six months.
</P>
<P>
   That's a view shared by Rep. Mike Thompson, a Democrat from the
Napa Valley who vainly fought the wine bill on the House floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing the Cox amendment did was bring this
to the attention of the e-commerce community,'' Thompson said.
``There have been people who have tried to get them involved, but
they didn't for whatever reason. Maybe they didn't think it was a
real threat.''

Flashy download speed often immaterial to task at hand 
By Bill Husted  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Come a little closer. Today I'm going to tell you a
dirty little secret that all those folks pushing high-speed
Internet access _ whether through a cable modem, digital subscriber
line, ISDN or satellite receiver _ would just as soon you not
understand.
</P>
<P>
   Most of what you do on the Internet at home works fine at the
speeds you get from an old-fashioned telephone line modem. If, like
most folks, your prime use of the Internet is sending and receiving
e-mail, you probably won't notice any difference between that now
old-fashioned analog modem and a high-speed connection. If you
enjoy chat _ either in one of the Internet chat groups or on AOL _
same thing, no difference.
</P>
<P>
   It's on the Web _ where many pages contain enormous amounts of
data, including photographs, videos and sound _ where the speed
difference pays off. I have a cable modem at home, and I do see a
big difference on the Web. But, for me now, the Web is a place to
look up specific information. I don't ``surf'' as often anymore _
aimlessly wandering from one site to another just for amusement.
So, if I still used my old-fashioned modem instead of the cable
modem I use (mostly because I do this stuff for a living), it would
be a matter of waiting 30 seconds for the answer to my question
about the population of Sao Paulo, Brazil, instead of the
five-second wait with my cable modem.
</P>
<P>
   Here's another thing that you may not know. Often, the real
delays on the Web have nothing at all to do with how fast a
connection you have to the Internet. Sometimes _ lots of times, in
fact _ it's the traffic on a particular Web site that is slowing
things down, not your connection.
</P>
<P>
   Don't get me wrong. I love my cable modem. But I am saying that
_ depending on how you use the Internet and how much money you have
to spend _ you may be able to live a reasonably full and productive
online life without the added expense of high-speed access.
</P>
<P>
   While we are at it, let's talk about another misconception about
Internet speed _ and maybe save you some money.
</P>
<P>
   It's not at all uncommon for me to receive a long e-mail from a
reader, asking what kind of new computer they need to speed things
up. These aren't dumb questions because even some of the national
advertising I see from computer companies, including Dell, seems to
equate a high-power PC with high-speed Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   But the truth is that your PC (unless it is an old 80486
machine) probably is plenty fast enough for using the Internet. I'd
rank PC power way down on the list when it comes to making a
difference in how fast a Web page loads. The most important factor
is connection speed, followed by general conditions on the Web (how
much traffic there is). In fact, I'd rank the stage of the moon and
the way you hold your mouth when you type ahead of computing power
when it comes to making a difference in Net speed.
</P>
<P>
   Here's why. For the most part (and there are exceptions, but
they aren't important) your PC _ when connected to the Net _ is
acting as a ``dumb terminal.'' The real computing work is being
done by the computers on the Web and on the Net. Your computer is
simply taking this information _ relayed by the Web site and your
Internet provider _ and displaying it on the screen. Some amount of
computing is going on, mostly by Windows and the Web browser, but
the really heavy lifting doesn't happen on your machine.
</P>
<P>
   So, here's my advice. If you want a new PC, if you want a
high-speed Internet connection, go ahead and buy one and get
high-speed access if you can afford it and understand the
limitations. But if you're counting pennies at your house _ as I do
_ then don't feel obliged to own the best of everything when it
comes to the Internet.

MiniDisc players cheaper with new Sharp product 
By James Cummings  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ It's getting cheaper to carry around a miniature
digital recording studio. New Jersey-based Sharp Electronics Corp.
has introduced a personal MiniDisc player/recorder that the company
says is the first of its kind to retail for less than $200.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp's MD-MT15 has many of the features of more expensive
machines, but while most other MiniDisc player/recorders start in
the $300 range, the MD-MT15's suggested price is $199.95.
</P>
<P>
   The MD-MT15 is just under four inches square and records music
and other sound on small discs similar to CDs. Each disc holds 74
minutes of sound, and blank discs are sold for about $4.50.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp's new MiniDisc player/recorder is powered by a
rechargeable nickel metal hydride battery that allows 12 hours of
playback or seven hours of recording. It has a 10-second memory so
it can continue playing without interruption if it is shaken or
shocked.
</P>
<P>
   The player has a view screen, and the user can mark songs on the
disc with a titling function. The device also marks selections with
the date and time they were recorded. Sharp claims discs can be
rerecorded up to 1 million times without losing sound quality.
</P>
<P>
   For additional information on the MD-MT15 and the nine other
MiniDisc players in the Sharp line, call (800) 237-4277 (BE-SHARP).
The MD-MT15 was not included on the Sharp Web site as of last week,
but you can access information on or order other products at
www.sharp-usa.com.

Colorful iMac line a trendsetter 
By Charles Haddad  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Apple Computer's zoomy iMac line has kicked off a trend that few
thought would happen. Manufacturers are racing to provide colorful
new computers and equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The November issue of Yahoo Internet Life looks at this trend
and tries to determine whether it will last. Among companies that
have jumped on the color bandwagon are Epson, Iomega and
HandSpring, the new maker of hand-held computers.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of the big computer media companies are selling out to
bigger rivals. Boston-based IDG, publisher of InfoWeek and
ComputerWorld, is staying proudly independent. Read about the
company's leaders and strategy in the October issue of MC. For IDG,
independence hasn't meant standing still. The magazine says the
company is undergoing a major cultural change to keep itself a
strong competitor.
</P>
<P>
   ON CD-ROM
</P>
<P>
   Sega Dreamcast, the latest video console, has been on the market
less than a month, but developers are releasing a steady stream of
new games for the platform. The latest is ``The House of the Dead
2.'' This arcade-style game, available in stores now, features a
horror story depicted in 3-D color. The retail price is about $50.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tetris,'' one of the first digital games, lives on. Hasbro
Interactive has released the latest version of this classic, a
title in which players must fit together falling geometric blocks.
Called ``The Next Tetris,'' the game features breakaway and sticky
blocks, as well as the opportunity to play against others.
</P>
<P>
   ONLINE
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest trends in software now is open-source code.
Anyone can take and improve on this software code, which is
unprotected by corporations or copyright laws. The Linux operating
system is the biggest example, but there are plenty of other
open-source projects under way.
</P>
<P>
   Now you can find out all about them in one place. Xnot is a site
that lists links to all the open-source projects across the
Internet. New projects are added weekly. You'll find this site at

This year could be key to making 'e-tailing' mainstream 
By Marilyn Geewax  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For retailers, the holiday shopping season is the
crucial period of the year when their decisions about inventory,
staffing, pricing and advertising will result in drinking champagne
in January _ or bathing in red ink.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, the stakes are even higher for merchants who plan
to use the Internet to capture customers. The electronic retailers,
or e-tailers, who can attract eyeballs and open wallets during the
last 10 weeks of 1999 may well become the masters of merchandising
in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be an absolutely huge season for online companies,''
said David Baltaxe, who studies Internet commerce for Current
Analysis, a research firm in Sterling, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Having enough merchandise in stock, employees on hand and
sophisticated technology in place will be the keys to handling
explosive growth, he said. ``This is the first year that we'll have
real mainstream shopping done through the Internet. Sales are
expected to be three times what they were last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Estimates of how much Christmas shopping will be done on the Web
vary from roughly $5 billion to $8 billion. Whatever the final
tally, it is sure to be a leap from last year's $2.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But even more important to e-tailers will be the ``buzz'' the
season generates. Companies that perform well from mid-October
through December could see their stock prices rocket up in January
as more investors become believers in electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say Christmas '99 is so important because it will be
the first time that millions of Americans will try shopping with a
mouse rather than at a mall. Their experiences could shape a
lifetime of buying habits.
</P>
<P>
   Ugly scenarios haunt e-tail boosters who fear those experiences
won't measure up to expectations. They worry that shoppers will
show up online, only to find they can't get accurate inventory
information or understand how to complete orders. Or perhaps
consumers will find what they want and buy it, only to discover the
delivery system is a failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's my nightmare: It's December 23rd and I'm at the mall
shopping because the things I ordered didn't show up,'' said Mary
Helen Gillespie, president of e-BuyersGuide.com, a Burlington,
Mass., firm that gives consumers advice.
</P>
<P>
   Shoppers are turning to the Web because ``they want to make
things easier for themselves,'' Gillespie said. Online merchants
``have to fulfill those expectations, not make life more difficult.
If they don't perform, people are going to say: 'I'm never going
back there.'''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, if consumers find Web shopping a breeze, the
retail world may be turned upside down. Traditional merchandisers
who expect customers to drive to a store during business hours may
find they can't compete with the 24-hour-a-day e-tailers.
</P>
<P>
   The Web's round-the-clock convenience will be the main lure
during the hectic holiday season for Damali Noel, a 27-year-old
Atlanta resident who recently made an online purchase through
FlowersAGoGo.com, a Decatur, Ga.,- based florist. She said that
smooth transaction has encouraged her to try surfing the Web for
bigger purchases during the holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It beats leaving the house,'' she said. ``You can sit in your
robe ... and shop in the middle of the night. It's very
convenient.''
</P>
<P>
   Given that convenience is what draws people to the Web, Wall
Street analysts are trying to figure out which kinds of companies
have the best chance of getting everything right. The Internet
offers essentially three formats for buying goods. One is the pure
Internet company, such as Amazon.com, which operates only in
cyberspace. Some observers believe these Web-only businesses will
be the winners in the e-tail world because of their laser-like
focus on online consumers.
</P>
<P>
   But others predict this holiday season will reveal the strengths
of the second type of Web merchant: the traditional retailers who
have stretched over into the Internet. Their advantage is having
real storefronts where shoppers can return merchandise without
having to ship goods back. For example, if a consumer goes on line
to buy a Christmas present through gap.com, he knows the recipient
will be able to return the gift at any Gap store and pick out
something that fits better.
</P>
<P>
   The third type of online merchant is the catalog company, which
sits somewhere between the Internet-only e-tailers and the
traditional stores with Web sites. The companies with vast
experience in direct merchandising are trying to use their brand
names and well-developed delivery systems to leap ahead of others
online.
</P>
<P>
   Lands' End, the 35-year-old clothes company based in Wisconsin,
is perhaps the most aggressive in trying to make the transition
from the printed catalog to the Web. Last year, the company sold
about $61 million worth of goods through its Web site, or about 4.5
percent of total sales. That was up from $18 million in 1997. So
far this year, Web-based sales are running at 2.5 times last year's
rate.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bass, vice president of electronic commerce at Lands' End,
said that to boost holiday sales, the company has started offering
a ``live chat'' box to allow customers to ``talk'' to sales clerks
while looking at merchandise on line. By clicking on the chat box,
the shopper will synchronize her screen with the clerk's so that
together, they can exchange messages about clothes.
</P>
<P>
   The shopper also can use the ``shop-with-a-friend'' option,
which brings a companion into the chat. That will allow, for
example, two sisters who live hundreds of miles apart to go on line
together and chat while picking out a present for their parents,
Bass said. In addition, they can put the clothes on a model, a
cyberfigure who can be configured to resemble the recipient of the
gift.
</P>
<P>
   By using these new technologies, Lands' End hopes to greatly
reduce shoppers' concerns about making exchanges of gifts. ``We are
trying very hard to make sure you get the right product right from
the beginning,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   David Baltaxe, the e-commerce analyst, said Lands' End's
spending spree to boost technology and staffing is typical this
year. ``A lot of money has been spent to make sure people are
ready,'' he said. ``Last year, some Web sites crashed because they
weren't prepared for the crush of business. ... They won't let that
happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   The pressure is so intense because the scrutiny from Wall Street
will be so close, he said. ``Now is the time to prove you can grab
(online customers) and make sure they enjoy using you,'' he said.
``If you can do that, you'll find the Holy Grail _ the ability to
carry over customers'' into the new year.
</P>
<P>
   Big holiday sales and satisfied customers will prompt venture
capitalists and stock investors to pour much more money into
e-commerce, making instant millionaires, even billionaires, out of
many e-tailers.
</P>
<P>
   Those entrepreneurs are hoping they'll please first-time holiday
shoppers like Jennifer Reichenbach, a 32-year-old Atlanta resident
who recently has begun making purchases online, primarily because
of the 24-hour-a-day convenience. ``I really, really like it,'' she
said. ``In fact, I almost fear getting addicted to it.''

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
Deal puts spotlight on unsigned musicians of MP3.com 
By Frances Katz  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ While the rest of the recording industry tries to
figure out what to do about digital music downloads, some prominent
industry executives are actually hiring bands from MP3.com, the
popular digital music download site.
</P>
<P>
   For those with the time and patience to wade through the
thousands of artists on the site, there's a good chance that you
might find, as Chief Executive Michael Robertson puts it, ``the
best music you never heard.''
</P>
<P>
   Book publishers have been trolling through ``slush piles'' for
years, hoping to find the Great American Novel buried among the
thousands of unsolicited manuscripts.
</P>
<P>
   MP3.com _ the ultimate slush pile _ eliminates the middleman for
music industry executives. Sure, they can spend every night in a
smoke-filled rock club checking out every unsigned band from Maine
to Monterey _ and some people do enjoy passing the time this way.
</P>
<P>
   However, with MP3.com, you can pretty much do the same thing in
the comfort of your home or office. The beer is cheaper, and you
can get a clean glass if you want one.
</P>
<P>
   This week, producers Francis Ford Coppola and Larry Sugar said
they would be picking out tunes for their cable TV series ``First
Wave'' solely from artists who make their music available on
MP3.com. Artists who'd like to submit their work for inclusion on
the show can get information at www.mp3.com/firstwave. Fans of the
show who like the music they hear will be able to listen to it or
purchase it only on the MP3.com site.
</P>
<P>
   Both MP3.com and Coppola's production company are enthusiastic
about the deal. Steve Love, the music executive who helped
orchestrate the deal, said in a statement that the relationship
helps offer potentially global exposure to MP3.com artists.
</P>
<P>
   TV and movie producers turning to MP3.com will show a lot of
ordinary consumers that there's some good music out there on the
Web _ and that the site will help them find it.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Hardie, a senior analyst at Forrester Research, says this
type of deal is part of a continued effort by MP3.com to make order
out of chaos.
</P>
<P>
   ``MP3.com as a big flea market,'' he says. ``The number of
relationships they've announced lately is designed to help people
sort through that flea market and give traditional television
production companies and radio stations access to that flea
market.''
</P>
<P>
   MP3.com says it wants to be the biggest source of music on the
Web, but the bigger it gets, the more urgent it will be to develop
ways for consumers to separate good online music from bad online
music.
</P>
<P>
   Deals with TV, movie and radio companies, such as the deal
earlier this year with Cox Interactive Media, allow those companies
to sort through MP3.com's vast roster of artists, choosing some of
the better music for their projects. Listeners and viewers will
then be directed to MP3.com to download the music. But instead of
going to MP3.com and hoping for the best, they'll have major media
properties guiding them to the best music, and MP3.com will promote
the music on the Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say this is a good move because most consumers don't
want to wade through piles of unfamiliar music. They want someone _
whether it's Rolling Stone magazine or the local radio station _ to
do the dirty work of finding good music for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers want access to enjoyable entertainment, with some
degree of filtering,'' Hardie says. ``That's how the real world
works. And the real world does work. It's not broken.''
</P>
<P>
   Internet executives like to talk about building and establishing
their brand and branding themselves with consumers. At first it
sounds like a bunch of techno-marketing speak, but what they are
really saying is they have to persuade consumers to take their
products seriously.
</P>
<P>
   They realize they have to build credibility with people who
really don't believe anything that only exists online can possibly
be good. Cross-promotion with familiar brands, such as television
and movies, is designed to make online music, magazines and even
e-commerce sites more acceptable to consumers unused to making
purchases, listening to music or reading magazines over the Net.
</P>
<P>
   On the Web, anybody can be a publisher, open a store or be a
recording artist. The only way Web surfers can separate the good
from the bad is to read every online e-zine or listen to every file
on MP3.com, which nobody really has the time or inclination to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers have a perception that absent some sort of
filtering, it's not the same quality as what they might buy in a
record store,'' Hardie says. ``It hasn't proven itself yet.''

Quicken upgrade a bit buggy 
By Charles Haddad  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When it comes to personal finance software, Mac users
don't have much choice. It's either Intuit's Quicken or nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, Intuit has done a pretty good job with Quicken. The
company just released the latest version, called Quicken 2000, and
it's a nice upgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Although it has been two years since the latest version, you
won't find any major breakthroughs in terms of features in Quicken
2000. This version largely represents a fine-tuning of old features
and a touch-up of the program's look and feel.
</P>
<P>
   As always with a Quicken update, there's a host of bugs.
Internet bulletin boards have been plastered with user complaints.
The biggest seems to be the inability of Quicken 2000 in some cases
to read and update old files.
</P>
<P>
   Troubled launches are nothing new for the latest versions of
Quicken, which are often buggy. The good news is that Intuit is
pretty good about fixing problems through patches that can be
downloaded from the Internet or your local Mac users bulletin
board.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I've had no problem with either installing or
updating my Quicken files to the latest version. I suspect problems
are isolated and probably created by conflicts with certain system
extensions.
</P>
<P>
   The best new addition to Quicken 2000 is something called the
Insight window. It's a customized screen that gives you a snapshot
of your financial status.
</P>
<P>
   Insight can list and total all your accounts, including credit
card debt, and display in multicolored charts your cash flow or
lack thereof.
</P>
<P>
   The other big change is the new, cleaned-up interface. Gone are
the big buttons that lined the top and left side of the screen.
</P>
<P>
   They have been replaced with a tabbed toolbar along the top of
the screen. You can customize both the tabs and the toolbars under
each of them. This is a less cluttered, easier-to-use layout.
</P>
<P>
   Other improvements include a tighter integration with the
Internet. Quicken 2000 comes with direct links to Intuit's vast Web
presence. With a click of a button you can download through Quicken
2000 historical share prices of mutual funds or individual stocks.
</P>
<P>
   You can also jump to services that provide comparative shopping
for insurance, mortgages and credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   My personal favorite among the new features is a small but
highly useful change. Quicken can now accurately recognize
electronic payments. In the past, many merchants were identified
only as addresses if you banked electronically through Quicken.
</P>
<P>
   Should you run out and buy Quicken 2000? It depends on the
strength of your stomach.
</P>
<P>
   Go out and upgrade if you don't mind the potential risk of some
buggy installation and conversion problems. Otherwise, wait a few
more weeks until Intuit inevitably posts the fixes on the Internet.

New call-waiting modem actually works as billed 
By Jack Warner  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's always a real thrill when I try out a piece of
hardware and find that (1) it does what it's supposed to do without
threats or pleas and (2) what it does is actually useful.
</P>
<P>
   Thus it is a pleasure to report my experience with a little item
called the Call Waiting Modem, made by Actiontec. It's close to an
ideal solution for those folks who don't want to get a telephone
line just for their computer.
</P>
<P>
   It works, of course, only if you subscribe to the call-waiting
feature on your line. It's a stylish little purple-and-cream box _
although you can get an internal version, as well. In stand-alone
versions, it comes in a standard serial port model and another for
the new-fangled USB ports.
</P>
<P>
   Bold as brass, I tried the USB model. It could not have been
simpler to install. Once plugged in, Windows 98 recognized it,
called for the driver provided on a CD-ROM, and set it up without a
fuss.
</P>
<P>
   Then, it actually worked, just as advertised. When calls came
in, the modem rang. Then I picked up the telephone to see who was
there. The modem gave me about seven seconds to get rid of the
caller; if I didn't hang up by then it severed the Internet
connection.
</P>
<P>
   It can also be set to cut the online connection the minute you
pick up the phone, or you can instruct it to ignore incoming calls.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, I had a problem with the speed of the Actiontec Call
Waiting Modem. But in the course of spending several hours fooling
with it, I learned a few things.
</P>
<P>
   To begin with, it wants to connect using the old 56KFlex
standard, which few ISPs support any longer. It routinely dropped
back to the standard V34 protocol, and we crawled along at 28k. The
manual suggests a register setting to dispense with the 56KFlex
business and go directly to V90, the most modern 56k protocol.
That, however, only got us up to around 31.6k.
</P>
<P>
   We have two telephone lines coming into our house, one for the
computers and one for voice. To test the modem's call-waiting
feature, it was easier to use the voice line. So, in an effort to
give the little guy every break, I hooked it up to the regular
modem line.
</P>
<P>
   Bingo. Right away it was cooking along at 49k, and you can't ask
for much better than that.
</P>
<P>
   I have spent a lot of time through the years hectoring the
telephone company into improving the quality of that line, but I
wouldn't have guessed it made that much difference.
</P>
<P>
   The modem has a list price of $135. It can probably be found at
retail stores for considerably less. Actiontec, at
www.actiontec.com, has a $50 rebate deal going now, which brings it
down to a very reasonable price.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The modern campaign headquarters is no longer a rented
storefront decorated with bumper stickers, bunting and empty soda
cans. Increasingly it has an annex open any hour of the day or
night, at an address starting with www.
</P>
<P>
   If in 1996 a candidate could prove hipness simply by posting an
electronic version of a campaign brochure on the World Wide Web,
White House hopefuls for 2000 have learned how to use their
Internet sites to raise money and rally troops. The Web page is the
new whistle-stop, a way for candidates to carry their messages
daily to more people than they can reach on the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   By posting everything from their baby pictures (as George W.
Bush has done) to their favorite Bible stories (an offering from
Elizabeth Dole), candidates are using the Internet as a fireside
chat room, to portray themselves as just plain folks. And the sites
provide a new conduit for cash: Bill Bradley has towered over the
opposition in online fund-raising, while the Steve Forbes campaign
created a way for Web surfers to crash a recent $1,000-a-plate gala
_ for a fee, of course.
</P>
<P>
   No one is suggesting that the Internet has come of age as a
medium of political influence, as television did most notably with
the Kennedy-Nixon debates of 1960. But with 67 million Americans
online, up from 7.5 million four years ago, it has become a new
variable in campaign calculus.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be said the candidate had to have a good message, a
good ground game and enough money to wage a good air game on TV,''
said Rick Segal, the Internet strategy adviser to Forbes. ``This is
the first cycle that it can be proven that a candidate needs to
have a good online game as well.''
</P>
<P>
   That game includes strategies like fill-in-the-blank e-mail that
supporters can send to friends in support of a candidate, and
paperless campaign contributions requiring just a few mouse clicks.
</P>
<P>
   And for all that, the sites are a relative bargain _ Bush spent
$57,000 on his over the last seven months _ with candidates either
hiring Web consultants, contracting with private companies, or
allowing volunteers to create and maintain them.
</P>
<P>
   Lately the sites have not only conveyed the campaigns' messages
but also made news: Bush last month became the first presidential
candidate to make updated lists of campaign donors available
online, and Sen. John McCain of Arizona got under the skin of
fellow Republicans by using his site to single out examples of
congressional pork.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Opinsky, McCain's press secretary, affirmed the
Internet's growing campaign role, saying it is ``almost like the
51st state.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It has no boundaries,'' Opinsky said. ``The Internet has
progressed from a billboard to a two-way street, and I think it's
probably good in the end for the political process.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Web pages _ unlike television or radio commercials,
which to the public can seem unavoidable _ depend on the initiative
of people to look for them. But such surfers are valuable visitors:
Bradley's campaign says that on an average day his site brings in
about $7,000 and is seen by 5,000 people, more than he might
encounter in a day on the trail.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's campaign workers try to drum up traffic to his site by
displaying the address on every lectern he uses. And Segal has
worked to make sure the Forbes site is indexed in Internet search
engines, thereby increasing the probability that surfers will stop
by, and is placing advertisements on news and financial Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, as the Internet grows in popularity,
candidates are cutting down on printed campaign literature. The
Forbes campaign, for example, says it is sending out fewer
newsletters than it would have in pre-Internet campaigns, because
the Internet is a faster and less expensive medium.
</P>
<P>
   And more than in a television commercial, the candidates are
able to convey their personalities through their pages. The forced
friendliness that results can either charm or repel prospective
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Bradley's site includes recipes for dishpan
cookies, oatmeal icebox cookies and butterhorns, from Rosalie
Dunker, Dede Herrell and Em Aubuchon, who baked for his campaign
kickoff in Crystal City, Mo., while Bush has baby pictures of
himself and his daughters on his site and mentions his family's
dog, Spot, and three cats, India, Cowboy and Ernie.
</P>
<P>
   One presidential hopeful even sells his gospel recordings
online, at www.hatchmusic.com, where one can download snippets of
Sen. Orrin G. Hatch singing ``The Cross Before the Crown.''
</P>
<P>
   Technologically savvy voters snooping through www.AlGore2000.com
are rewarded with a message embedded in the source code, the
programming blueprints of a site.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks for checking out our source code!'' the site says, ,
describing plans to improve the code. ``The fact that you are
peeking behind the scenes at our site means you can make an
important difference to this Internet effort.''
</P>
<P>
   In another innovative move, the Forbes campaign blended virtual
reality with real reality, inviting 400 computer users to an online
version of a $1,000-a-plate bash in June at the Waldorf-Astoria in
New York. For $10, plugged-in supporters saw live video of the
festivities, and typed messages back and forth with Forbes and
others in attendance. Later that night his address was seen on a
free Webcast by about 1,800 people, 600 more than at the live
event.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In many respects, the partnership between established candidates
and the wild, wild Web is uneasy as they plumb the possibilities of
this new technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Campaigns are a tight, disciplined, focused message delivered
in a focused way, reducing chance, variables and conflict to a
minimum,'' said Phil Noble, president of PoliticsOnline of
Charleston, S.C., a company offering Internet expertise. ``The
Internet is about millions of voices colliding, all at the same
time, about all kinds of things in a near-chaotic pattern.''
</P>
<P>
   But candidates recognize that the Internet is an effective way
to get their messages across and to keep the prospective voter's
attention. Campaigns usually can get 45 seconds of a voter's
attention by phone or 30 seconds in a television advertisement,
compared with eight minutes through a Web site, said Emilienne
Ireland, president of Campaign Advantage, an Internet
campaign-services company in Bethesda, Md.
</P>
<P>
   And more than ever before, the candidates' pages are bringing in
contributions. Bradley's campaign says it has raised over $770,000
through his site, more than 3 percent of its total contributions.
(According to a survey by PoliticsOnline, McCain had raised
$260,000 on the Internet through September; no other candidate had
brought in more than $100,000 through the Net.)
</P>
<P>
   Of the half-million people who have visited the Bradley site
since last December, 14.4 percent have filled out a form to get
involved, and 1 percent have brought out their credit cards or
checkbooks to contribute, said Lynn Reed, a consultant to the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bradley campaign has been real effective in the overall
strategic use of the Net,'' said Jonah Seiger, co-founder and
principal of Mindshare Internet Campaigns, consultants in
Washington. ``They raised a great deal of money and a great deal of
press attention, suggesting they clearly have a better strategic
sense of the Net than the Gore campaign does, considering that Gore
is so identified with the Net. Here they're doing something that is
really going to hit Gore where it hurts.''
</P>
<P>
   But Andrew Sather, senior vice president at Sapient, Internet
consultants in Cambridge, Mass., that redesigned the official White
House Web site, cited the Gore campaign's use of the Web to let
visitors interact with the candidate, through electronic town
halls, where people can pose questions about anything from class
size to the income gap.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign has used its site to gain credentials for the
Texas governor as a Net-savvy candidate, notably with the decision
last month to begin posting a list of all his contributors, even
those who gave less than $200.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gives Americans the opportunity to look for themselves at
the broad-based support Governor Bush is receiving,'' said Scott
McClellan, a campaign spokesman. About 100,000 people have dipped
into the 1,750-page listing so far, he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, just as readers of Web pages get more
information about their candidate, the candidate gets more
information about them, helping a campaign organize its ground
troops. Several Web watchers pointed to what the Forbes campaign
calls electronic precincts as a canny use of the Internet: In a
political version of multilevel marketing, a campaign volunteer
brings in a handful of other volunteers, who in turn bring in more.
The first volunteer, the e-precinct captain, is rewarded with
special briefings, online video presentations, and a chance to meet
the candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something that's growing in its own viral kind of way,''
said Segal, the Internet adviser to Forbes, who added that the
campaign had about 5,000 e-precincts, a few with 5,000 members
each.
</P>
<P>
   The Forbes campaign keeps tabs on where their e-volunteers live
and what kind of volunteering they would like to do. Using similar
information, the Bradley campaign was able to send e-mail to 5,000
supporters in the Northeast, encouraging them to take part in a
weeklong canvass in New Hampshire this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were able to get 300 folks, free,'' Ms. Reed said. ``If you
had to make phone calls for the same return, it might not be worth
it.''
</P>
<P>
   With all those electronic addresses and ZIP codes flowing in
from supporters to Webmasters, some Internet experts have become
concerned about what is done with this information. To reassure
supporters, the Gore site posts this disclaimer: ``We do not share
our volunteer lists with any other site or any other entity.''
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Todd, managing editor of The Hotline, a daily Web-based
political newsletter published by The National Journal, a weekly
magazine of politics and government, predicts that the Internet
will first show its new power in a primary campaign, in a small or
particularly well-wired state.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way, in the past, there was a last-minute TV barrage,
there will be a huge Internet campaign to swing votes toward a
candidate,'' Todd said.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts say the Internet may not show its full potential
as a political tool until 2004 at the earliest, when high-speed
Internet connections become common and the transmitting of messages
to discrete targets is refined to an art.
</P>
<P>
   ``The potential watershed moment will be when Al Gore can make
sure his pro- choice abortion ads are only seen by moderate,
pro-choice women,'' Todd said. ``That's what the Internet allows,
targeting and identifying voters by household.''

BLOWN TO BITS: CYBERWARFARE BREAKS THE RULES OF MILITARY 
ENGAGEMENT
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sixteen Years ago, in the movie ``WarGames,'' Matthew Broderick
played a computer hacker who electronically ferrets his way into
the Pentagon's Norad early warning system inside Cheyenne Mountain,
Colo., and almost starts World War III by accident.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the military finally struck back. The Pentagon
created a new military center to harness the nation's disparate
cyberwarfare forces under the Air Force Space Command at Peterson
Air Force Base in Colorado Springs. That followed the public
acknowledgment by Gen. Henry Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff, that the United States played hacker itself earlier this
year _ waging a keyboard war against Serbian computer networks.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond challenging America's own military culture and requiring
sophisticated technology, cyberwarfare raises a fundamental
philosophical question. The biggest challenge that such warfare may
pose for democratic societies is that it further blurs the line
between military and nonmilitary targets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cyberwarfare involves deliberately targeting noncombatants,''
said Mark Rasch, a former federal prosecutor and an expert on legal
issues in computer security. ``Frequently, you're not going after a
government or military or some strategic target.'' The target might
instead be a public utility.
</P>
<P>
   The new command's first mission will be to coordinate the
defense of the military's computer networks against foreign threats
and cyberterrorists. Soon after the mission will expand to include
offense: Joint Task Force Computer Network Attack, in Pentagon
jargon, designed to conduct wartime military operations against
computer networks in enemy countries.
</P>
<P>
   The addition of an information-war fighting capability to the
Pentagon's quiver takes activities that have largely been confined
to covert military and intelligence operations and makes them part
of the nation's military chain of command.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the new center is a public acknowledgment that
as the world's most technically advanced nation, the United States
is also potentially the most vulnerable to foreign cyberthreats.
</P>
<P>
   The specter of simultaneous computer network attacks against
banking, transportation, commerce and utility targets _ as well as
against the military _ conjures up the fear of an electronic Pearl
Harbor in which the nation is paralyzed without a single bullet
ever being fired.
</P>
<P>
   But the real-world challenge faced by the military is likely to
be more subtle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The threat is going to be death by a thousand cuts, rather
than a giant attack,'' said a former top military scientist.
``There will be a little bit of this and a little bit of that.''
</P>
<P>
   This ghost-in-the-machine threat is perhaps the military's worst
nightmare and also the one that a closed and secretive military
organization may have the most difficulty combating.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we can throw technology at this but it's not a
technology problem at all,'' said Ronald Knecht, a former Pentagon
official who helped develop information warfare policy for three
decades and who is now senior vice president for corporate
development at Science Applications International Corp., a large
military contractor.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge, he said, is to change a military culture that has
fought wars with bombs and tanks into one that fights with bits and
bytes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Preparing for cyberwar will force the nation to rethink the
way it fights wars,'' said Steven Lukasik, a military analyst at
the Center for International Security and Cooperation at Stanford
University and a former director of the Pentagon's Advanced
Research Projects Agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been trained to fight nuclear wars where static defenses
are fatal,'' he said. ``But in information warfare we have to
rethink everything. It may be that Maginot Lines have basically
gotten a bad name.'' In other words, building impenetrable
electronic walls may be a more effective tactic in cyberwarfare.
</P>
<P>
   A deeper challenge for the Pentagon may be keeping pace with
Silicon Valley's fast-paced consumer technology companies. Until
the end of the Cold War, the most powerful computer technology
would trickle down from a handful of defense contractors and
supercomputer companies financed by the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   In the past decade, however, the most powerful computer
technologies are increasingly made by companies that make products
that go under Christmas trees. To cope with the consumer technology
challenge, the CIA announced plans this month to set up a venture
capital fund to gain quicker access to state-of-art technologies
being incubated in Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   But the Pentagon's problem may be compounded because the
technology is the same as in consumer products but the rules of
cyberwarfare are different, said Knecht of Stanford. He said a
military commander should expect an attack that blocks access to
his computer networks ``and he should assume that somebody who has
approved access to his networks is working for the other side _ and
still be ready to fight a war.''

<P>
   The software giant yesterday said it would join with Mexico's
largest phone company, Telefonos de Mexico (Telmex), to create a
new Web company that will deliver content and e-commerce services
to Spanish speakers across the Americas.
</P>
<P>
   The joint venture _ which will have offices in Argentina, Chile,
Colombia, Central America, Mexico, Venezuela and the United States
_ combines Microsoft's Internet software and services, notably its
Microsoft Network online service, with Telmex's telecommunications
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   The site will be called MSN Prodigy. It has no relationship to
the Prodigy online service. No launch date has been announced.
</P>
<P>
   Mauricio Santillan, vice president of Microsoft's Mexican
operations, said the portal will provide Spanish-speaking consumers
with Microsoft's Internet e-mail and instant messaging services, as
well as news and entertainment content and online search and
shopping capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the individual services we plan to offer are already
available to Spanish-speaking consumers,'' he said. ``But we plan
to offer these services in a more comprehensive and integrated
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has its work cut out for it in Latin America. A slew
of Internet companies _ such as StarMedia Network, Yupi.com and
Quepasa.com, as well as Microsoft rivals America Online and Yahoo _
have already unveiled their own Spanish-language portals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is already saturated in terms of these general,
all-purpose Spanish-language sites,'' said Patrick Keane, an
analyst with Internet research firm Jupiter Communications. ``But
even though Microsoft is late to the game, you can never discount
them because of all the money and muscle they have.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Internet has been slow to catch on in Latin America.
Only 4.8 million Latinos, or 4 percent of all Internet users,
logged on last year, according to International Data Corp. And
Latin American e-commerce generated a paltry $167 million in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest obstacles in Latin America are high Internet access
costs and poor infrastructure. Only 1 one in 10 Latinos has a phone
line, and fewer still own a computer.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have both a computer and a phone line must typically
pay about 10 times more than U.S. residents Americans for Internet
access, largely due to shabby telecom networks in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft and others remain undeterred. They cite Latin
America's burgeoning population, which is almost double that of the
United States, as well as a drop in computer prices and increased
Internet access in public schools, as reasons for jumping into the
market. The number of Latinos using the Internet is expected to
grow to 19.1 million by 2003, according to IDC.
</P>
<P>
   Darlene Rios Drapkin, a business assistance manager at the
Spanish Speaking Unity Council in Oakland, said she is pleased to
see the rise of Spanish-language portals.
</P>
<P>
   ``These sites are useful to the community because they help
bridge the technological divide and let Latinos enter the
information age,'' she said. ``Up till now, there have mostly been
only English Web sites. That makes it more difficult for Spanish
speakers to get into computers.''
</P>
<P>
   Only about 3 percent of all Web pages are in Spanish, according
to StarMedia.
</P>
<P>
   But Rios Drapkin warned that the new Microsoft site may not
succeed if it focuses too heavily on online shopping features.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need Spanish sites that allow people to get more
informed,'' she said. ``I'm not sure Latinos are looking to engage
in e-commerce. For the most part, Latinos like the idea of personal
relationships and buying goods from people they know.''

 IBM PLANS TO STOP SELLING ITS PCs IN RETAIL OUTLETS  
 By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   IBM, which helped touch off a boom in computer retailing when it
introduced its personal computer nearly two decades ago, said
Tuesday that consumers soon would not find its PCs in stores; they
will have to buy them on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   After Christmas, International Business Machines Corp. will sell
its Aptiva line of consumer desktop computers only on the World
Wide Web. Its popular Thinkpad laptops will still be available in
stores, and it will continue to sell corporate computers _ a much
larger business for IBM _ through dealers, as well as directly from
the company.
</P>
<P>
   It is abandoning retail stores for its PCs because, like other
computer manufacturers who sell through brick-and-mortar outlets,
IBM has been losing ground to companies that sell directly to
customers, like Dell Computer Corp. and Gateway Inc. IBM's PC
division lost $1 billion last year and $240 million in the first
half of this year.
</P>
<P>
   To stem the losses, IBM is paring the business, cutting costs
and focusing on its more profitable divisions. Two weeks ago, it
said it would lay off as many as 1,000 of the 10,000 employees in
the personal-computer division, many of them involved in selling
computers to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in January, IBM said it would emphasize sales of
Aptivas on its own Shopibm.com site in addition to selling through
some Internet dealers, like Valueamerica.Com.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't figure out how to go through retail and have us make
money and have the retailer make money on a consistent basis,''
said David M. Thomas, the executive in charge of IBM's personal
systems group. He said that consumers represented about $2 billion
of the company's $17 billion in PC sales but that the consumer line
``consistently loses more money than any other.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, IBM's share of the consumer market is far smaller than
industry averages. Ziff-Davis Infobeads estimates that in 1999, 41
percent of desktop computers and 19 percent of portable computers
were sold to home users.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas said that the consumer market had been tough for IBM
because it has been dominated by very low-cost machines, where
profit margins are much thinner than IBM needs to support its
expensive infrastructure. Moreover, retailers demand expensive
support, like subsidizing the cost of unsold models, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas said these problems were mainly limited to the United
States and that IBM continued to do well selling through retail
outlets in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts also say that IBM has been inconsistent in its approach
to the consumer market and has often been late to spot industry
trends, especially new lower price levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``IBM reminds me of a 747 that takes off, climbs to 40,000 feet
then does a nose dive and pulls out just before it crashes,'' said
Mathew Sargent, an analyst with Ziff Davis. He said that IBM had
recently fallen to fourth place in the retail market, with an 11
percent share, after Hewlett-Packard, Compaqand an upstart,
E-Machines.
</P>
<P>
   IBM hopes that Internet sales will prove more lucrative. Selling
directly to consumers delivers higher profit margins, but even when
it sells a PC on another retailer's Web site, it is often shipped
directly from IBM to the consumer, reducing the cost of
distribution.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, IBM said that Internet buyers typically spend more on
computers and need less technical help than those who buy in
stores.
</P>
<P>
   Sargent said that, based on its track record, IBM would find its
Web-only strategy difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``On paper, it's the right thing to do, but in practice it won't
work,'' he said. ``IBM's Web site is horrible. Customers find it
very difficult to order, and that just won't hold up when they are
competing with Dell and Gateway.''
</P>
<P>
   Trink Guarino, a spokeswoman for IBM's PC unit, said the company
understood that its Web site needs work.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the first quarter, it will be greatly improved,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said that IBM would promote Aptiva sales on its Web site
with a $20 million advertising campaign in the first three months
of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at Hewlett-Packard and Compaq said Tuesday that they
had no intentions of pulling their computers out of retail stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the last four hears, the consumer business has been very
healthy for Compaq,'' said Michael Larson, the head of Compaq's
consumer unit.

BARTER IS SKEWING THE FINANCIAL PICTURE FOR INTERNET COMPANIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  (ART ADV: A photo is being sent. Non-subscribers can purchase by
calling 888-603-1036 or 888-346-9867.) 
 By EDWARD WYATT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since the first cave man exchanged his favorite club for a
neighbor's animal pelt, barter has been an accepted form of
commerce. Now some Internet companies have turned themselves into
virtual trading posts, making barter a way of life.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Sportsline USA, whose sports-related Internet site is
relentlessly promoted during broadcasts of football games and other
sporting events on CBS, the television network that owns a stake in
Sportsline.
</P>
<P>
   In the first half of this year, nearly a fifth of Sportsline's
$24 million in revenue involved no cash payments. Instead,
Sportsline gave to other companies that amount of advertising space
on its site in exchange for advertising and other services and
goods on their World Wide Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   These types of exchanges have become so common that they may be
skewing the financial picture for the Internet industry. Since
these new companies rarely have profits, revenues are often the key
determination of their value. Strong revenue growth, thus, can
translate into higher stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   Barter accounted for more than 10 percent of revenues at
Internet companies including Ivillage, Salon.com, Earthweb,
Verticalnet and Edgar Online in the second quarter, the companies
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, it represented 7 percent of the $693 million in
Internet advertising recorded in the first quarter of the year,
double the percentage of just three years ago, according to a
survey of Internet advertising conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers
and the Internet Advertising Bureau, a trade group.
</P>
<P>
   Some Internet analysts say these numbers are far too low. Were
companies to take into account deals in which two Internet
companies simply agree to scratch each other's back _ selling equal
dollar amounts of advertising to each other for cash _ barter would
account for more than 15 percent of all Internet ads, the analysts
estimate.
</P>
<P>
   In few cases do investors have any idea how big barter has
become. Most companies that include barter deals in their reported
revenue, like Sportsline, do not mention the practice in their
earnings news releases. Only by reading far into a company's
quarterly report to the Securities and Exchange Commission would an
investor find disclosures about such transactions. The SEC requires
companies to break out the deals if barter accounts for 10 percent
or more of revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something about the practice doesn't smell right to me,'' said
Robert A. Olstein, portfolio manager of the Olstein Financial Alert
fund, a $350 million mutual fund that tries to find undervalued
stocks by parsing companies' financial statements.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be okay according to generally accepted accounting
principles, but I'm not sure anything truly economic is happening
in these transactions,'' he said. ``I like to see independent
transactions where cash is exchanged, and the company that receives
it can consciously decide where to spend every dollar.''
</P>
<P>
   Major accounting firms all sign audited financial statements of
Internet companies that recognize some barter transactions, giving
the practice legitimacy. The exchange of advertising is important
to companies trying to get their names before the Web-surfing
public.
</P>
<P>
   But because of the peculiar characteristics of the Internet
business, accountants and securities regulators are taking a closer
look at the issue. On Monday, the SEC's chief accountant, in a
letter to the Financial Accounting Standards Board, requested that
the board's special task force on emerging issues take up the issue
of accounting for barter transactions, calling it one of four
``priority level 1'' issues accounting and securities regulators
face.
</P>
<P>
   Accounting for barter transactions has long been governed by an
old rule that says the deals must be recorded at the ``fair value''
of the goods exchanged.
</P>
<P>
   Fair value of advertising is easily determined for established
media companies that sell nearly all of their advertising space for
cash. But an Internet company may now collect payments on only a
small fraction of its space. Much of the rest goes unused, so
exchanging a part of it with another Internet company has little
downside.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some cases, I don't know what fair value is on the
Internet,'' said George Neble, a partner in the high-technology
practice in Arthur Andersen's Boston office. ``Current practices by
companies are all over the place. Given the infinite amount of
space on the Internet, I think you have to demonstrate that you can
get cash for these spots from independent parties and that you have
a pattern of doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Neble added, ``Valuations for these companies are being driven
by revenues, and barter creates the potential for distortion in a
company's revenues.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynn Turner, the SEC's chief accountant, says he, too, has grown
uncomfortable with some companies' extensive use of barter. ``We
want to make sure that the information being reported gives
investors a true notion of what is really going on with revenues
and that they are reliable numbers,'' he said. ``We're always
concerned that someone will push the envelope too far.''
</P>
<P>
   While most Internet companies engage in some form of barter,
some refuse to recognize those transactions as revenues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I think it's fraudulent,'' said Alan M. Meckler,
chief executive of Internet.com, which runs a network of Web sites,
electronic newsletters and discussion groups.
</P>
<P>
   Meckler has been around the Internet for almost as long as the
Internet has been around. As the former publisher of Internet World
magazine, the organizer of Internet trade shows and the creator of
the online magazine Iworld, he is no stranger to the arenas of
publishing and advertising.
</P>
<P>
   But when he looked into the vortex of barter transactions for
Internet advertising, Meckler said he saw a sort of black hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``No company would possibly take barter for something they could
sell, unless they were getting something back that is worth more,''
he said. ``What's more, advertising on the Internet has no shelf
life _ and if it has no shelf life, it has no value that should be
recognized as revenues.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Internet.com engages in some ``immaterial'' amounts of
barter, it does not record any revenues or expenses for those
transactions.
</P>
<P>
   Most barter transactions are recorded as even exchanges, meaning
that equal dollar amounts of revenue and expense are recorded.
Thus, the transactions do not affect a company's bottom line, its
cash flow or taxes. But companies that recognize barter
transactions generally say they are valid because they both give
and receive something of value.
</P>
<P>
   Barter helps young companies, because it gets a company's name
and brand in front of more people without expending any cash.
Salon.com, the online magazine, said that barter rose to 16 percent
of revenues in the year ended March 31, up from 7 percent the
previous year and zero percent the year before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Salon believes that these barter transactions have been
important to the establishment of the Salon brand and expects to
continue to engage in these transactions in the future,'' the
company said.
</P>
<P>
   Not all companies appear at ease with the recognition of barter
revenues, though. In Sportsline's case, CBS, its largest
shareholder, gets royalties of 15 percent of revenue _ calculated
by excluding any revenue received in the form of barter.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Wahl, a Sportsline spokesman, declined to discuss why
barter accounts for so much of the company's revenue. ``We don't
disclose anything additional with regard to barter, even our
rationale, beyond what's in our financials,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, a company that barters advertising records two
transactions of equal value. For the advertising space on its own
site that it gives away, a company records a given dollar amount of
``expenses.'' At the same time, it records an equal amount of
``revenues,'' representing the value of the ad space on another
company's Web site that it received in exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies report that barter is quite important to their
financial health. Ivillage, the Web site dedicated to women's news
and information, said in its SEC filings it ``is dependent on
barter transactions which do not generate cash revenue,'' but which
still accounted for 20 percent of 1998 revenue and 12 percent of
the $14.6 million in revenue it posted in the first half of this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Stell, a spokesman for Ivillage, said that because the
company breaks out the amount of its barter transactions, ``people
can take that into account when they do their models'' to value the
company.
</P>
<P>
   For many Internet companies, preserving precious cash is nearly
as important as getting their brand name in front of Internet
users.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many Internet companies don't have the resources to purchase
content or advertising and promotion,'' said Debbie A. Simon, a
vice president at Houlihan Lokey Howard &AMP; Zukin, a Los Angeles
investment banking firm, who specializes in Internet transactions.
``So we definitely are seeing an increasing trend toward barter
deals.''
</P>
<P>
   A liberal use of barter can work against companies as well, said
Rich LeFurgy, chairman of the Internet Advertising Bureau. ``If
you're willing to barter, it's hard to sell ads at the full rate,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Petrusky, director of the new-media group at
PricewaterhouseCoopers, said that though barter has doubled as a
percentage of total Internet ad spending in the last three years,
he believed it would fall back to about 5 percent, as larger
companies come to dominate the industry's ad spending.
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts are not so sure. Marissa Gluck, an advertising
analyst for Jupiter Communications, thinks barter accounts for a
far larger percentage of online advertising _ at least 15 percent,
or up to three times the trade group's estimate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a significant chunk of revenues out there that are
probably barter, where it looks like money is changing hands,'' Ms.
Gluck said, but where in fact two companies simply buy equal
amounts of advertising on each other's Web site. ``It's a somewhat
insidious practice that is hard to track.''

WHICH TIME ZONE ARE YOU IN: INTERNET OR ROADKILL? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DAVE MURPHY   
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ When our home phone line went dead recently, it
reminded me of something that workers had better know. There are
two time zones in America these days: Internet time and roadkill.
</P>
<P>
   When I called the phone company that Wednesday afternoon, the
recorded voice told me that a technician would arrive on Saturday
between 8 a.m. and 6 p.m. When I called back the next day to ask a
real person if she could narrow that 10-hour window, she said the
technician would show up between 2 and 6.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday came, and so did the technician _ at 11:30 a.m. He
fixed the line outside, but didn't bother to call afterward just to
make sure everything was OK. The next day, an automated voice from
the phone company called to say the line was fixed; it didn't
mention anything about crediting my account for the three days my
line didn't work.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't a phone company horror story. The line did get fixed,
and I'm sure I could get a credit on my bill if I called to
complain. But you could also say that waiting three days and having
that original 10-hour window is ridiculous in this day and age,
that it's pretty bad when a technician misses a four-hour window by
2 1/2 hours, and that I shouldn't have to complain to get my
account credited.
</P>
<P>
   The phone company is operating in the roadkill time zone, acting
like a monopoly at a time when few monopolies are safe. Too many
companies and industries are still in that zone, not realizing that
the Internet not only has increased competition, but has made
people more impatient with the old ways of doing business.
</P>
<P>
   Even in a booming economy like this one, lots of companies fail.
</P>
<P>
   And even with unemployment at 30-year lows, many workers get
left behind. In both cases, the problem is usually the same:
They're operating on roadkill time.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't have more skills today than you did five years ago,
the world is passing you by. The status quo just won't cut it
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Many businesses get comfortable. They have happy customers, and
all seems to be well. Then the landlord raises the rent or a
competitor moves in, and their business suddenly isn't so
comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Workers get comfortable, too. Then their company pushes for more
profits or increased productivity, and their jobs suddenly aren't
so comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to blame greedy landlords or office politics or evil
bosses, but the main cause is that people are reacting _ slowly _
to things as they happen. You need to be thinking a couple of years
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Look at your career. Do you see your company doing business as
usual five years from now? If you do, somebody is a fool; now all
you have to do is decide whether it's you or your chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   If you're still operating on roadkill time, five years isn't
much.
</P>
<P>
   But on Internet time, it's a couple of generations. Think back
to how relatively meaningless the Web was in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Roadkill thinking is dangerous even for people who believe they
have it made, like government workers. Local governments have been
known to outsource entire departments to get the work done less
expensively. If people see more efficiency in business and less
efficiency in government, expect the political pressure to
increase.
</P>
<P>
   How do you see your company changing in five years? Are
competitors likely to surface? Will your industry have more or
fewer jobs? What will you need to know then that you don't know
now? When you're applying for a job, are you just responding to the
employer's questions, or are you offering ideas of your own?
</P>
<P>
   Take the ``Where do you see yourself in 10 years?'' job
interview question and turn it around. Where do you see that
company in 10 years? Where does your prospective boss see it?
Before you even write a cover letter, show some initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Check out the company's store or Web sites. Find out what
competitors are doing. Go into the interview prepared to talk for
10 minutes about why you want to work for that company and what you
could offer. (Don't actually give the 10-minute talk; just think
about the elements that would go into it.) And, of course, don't
show up for an appointment 2 1/2 hours early. Only phone companies
can get away with that.

HOW GOOFY CAN WE GET ON CANDIDATES?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Donald Trump for president. Is that the goofiest idea to drop
out of nowhere onto the 2000 campaign trail?
</P>
<P>
   Well, not really. The goofiest idea would be Warren Beatty for
president.
</P>
<P>
   On second thought, Beatty for president isn't the goofiest idea.
The goofiest idea is Cybill Shepherd for president.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, there's Jesse Ventura for president. There's Pat
Buchanan for president. And, of course, there's the truly goofy
idea that never seems to go away: Ross Perot for president.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing that's weirder than such would-be commanders in
chief running for president is the mind-boggling decision of the
media and the public to treat them as serious candidates. If we
took the whole bunch of them and cooked them into some sort of
star-studded candidate stew, we wouldn't have the ingredients for
one legitimate contender.
</P>
<P>
   And yet here we are, talking about them as if they have
something going for them as potential presidents _ something beyond
unrestrained ego and unbridled audacity, that is.
</P>
<P>
   Is this a reflection of the voters' lack of enthusiasm for the
real candidates? Or an indication that voters and the media have
become hopelessly undiscriminating in their view of politics as we
enter the waning days of a presidency that has demonstrated
conclusively that the elected leader of the greatest nation on the
planet need not be someone who commands widespread respect, much
less admiration?
</P>
<P>
   If Bill Clinton can be elected twice and survive both terms in
the face of irrefutable evidence that he is a self-serving,
duplicitous worm, why shouldn't we look favorably upon the
candidacies of tabloid celebrities, professional wrestlers,
has-been speech writers and blowhard billionaires?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe our yearning to curb the business-as-usual escapades of
professional politicians is so desperate that we're willing to
consider drastic measures. Or maybe the populace is simply inclined
to wager that a ``character'' might exhibit more character than
some of the pols we've endured in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever,'' as the great Bob Dole used to say.
</P>
<P>
   The point is, individuals whose presidential aspirations would
have been ignored or laughed off not so long ago are suddenly being
taken seriously _ or semi-seriously, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Take Donald Trump. The real estate/casino kingpin has formed an
exploratory committee to ponder a possible run for the White House.
He's so serious about it, in fact, that he said the other day that
he'd be filing papers to put his name on the ballot in California.
</P>
<P>
   And others are taking him seriously, too. One of Trump's
ex-wives, Marla Maples, is so horrified by The Donald's interest in
the White House that she has vowed to campaign against him if he
runs.
</P>
<P>
   According to news reports, Maples intends to ``tell the people
what he is really like'' if Trump dares to seek the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   And what was Trump's reaction to the former Mrs. Trump's
critique of his fitness for the Oval Office? According to the New
York Daily News, Trump refused to hand over a $1.5 million payment
that he owed Maples on their divorce settlement.
</P>
<P>
   This guy knows how to play hardball. You think Saddam Hussein
won't be shaking in his boots if Trump is elected president of the
United States?
</P>
<P>
   Look, folks, the 2000 election is still a long way off, and it's
undeniably fun to imagine what a Donald Trump administration would
do about nuclear proliferation or what a President Ventura would do
with the budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
   It's even fun to imagine Warren Beatty conducting a
no-holds-barred campaign just like the one his fictional candidate
staged in that ``Bulworth'' movie.
</P>
<P>
   But imagining is all there is to it.
</P>
<P>
   Even if one of these National Enquirer headline-grabbers winds
up on the presidential ballot, he or she will be lucky to collect
more than a handful of votes. In the end, voters will realize _ as
they always do _ that choosing a president is serious business.
</P>
<P>
   The real candidates may not be exciting, but they are the real
candidates.

HOW GOOFY CAN WE GET ON CANDIDATES?

<TEXT>
<P>
   Donald Trump for president. Is that the goofiest idea to drop
out of nowhere onto the 2000 campaign trail?
</P>
<P>
   Well, not really. The goofiest idea would be Warren Beatty for
president.
</P>
<P>
   On second thought, Beatty for president isn't the goofiest idea.
The goofiest idea is Cybill Shepherd for president.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, there's Jesse Ventura for president. There's Pat
Buchanan for president. And, of course, there's the truly goofy
idea that never seems to go away: Ross Perot for president.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing that's weirder than such would-be commanders in
chief running for president is the mind-boggling decision of the
media and the public to treat them as serious candidates. If we
took the whole bunch of them and cooked them into some sort of
star-studded candidate stew, we wouldn't have the ingredients for
one legitimate contender.
</P>
<P>
   And yet here we are, talking about them as if they have
something going for them as potential presidents _ something beyond
unrestrained ego and unbridled audacity, that is.
</P>
<P>
   Is this a reflection of the voters' lack of enthusiasm for the
real candidates? Or an indication that voters and the media have
become hopelessly undiscriminating in their view of politics as we
enter the waning days of a presidency that has demonstrated
conclusively that the elected leader of the greatest nation on the

TAKING STOCK IN HIZZONER 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Can San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown outperform
Martha Stewart? I don't mean at setting party tables or field-
stripping a jammed glue gun.
</P>
<P>
   And I'm sure Brown is ahead of Stewart in most matters of taste,
as long as it doesn't involve anything trickier than opening a
bottle of champagne. What I'm talking about is money, a field in
which Brown is no slouch either.
</P>
<P>
   If Willie Brown went public, would his stock outperform that of
Martha Stewart Omnimedia Inc., which raised $129 million in a day?
I'm sure it would. This is a man who can lift an eyebrow and raise
millions from developers and big corporations for host committees,
which throw the dough away on conferences, summits and junkets.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, unlike the kind of hostess gifts Martha might
suggest, there are some real returns for those corporations in
terms of doing business with the city.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's initial public stock offering probably would even
outperform the World Wrestling Federation, whose IPO raised $170
million in a day. After all, the WWF's performers aren't as
colorful or as good at in-fighting and braggadocio as Brown is.
</P>
<P>
   Why should the chief executive of San Francisco have an IPO?
Well, this public servant has to have something to offer the
public.
</P>
<P>
   Brown has been at the helm of a great enterprise of a city, one
which has allowed developers to build up San Francisco block by
block and parking lot by parking lot. So we might as well have a
chance to buy stock in a company _ which like Stewart's, is just
him.
</P>
<P>
   Like Stewart, he's selling style. Like a lot of dot-com
companies, his promises are his most important product.
</P>
<P>
   If Brown had an IPO, he should stay away from cute Internet
names like DaMayor.com. He should just stick to Willie Brown Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Willie Brown is a powerful brand name, almost as powerful as
Martha Stewart. He exerts complete control over his empire the way
she does over hers. And he doesn't waste time constructing cute
centerpieces. Well, not counting that tacky stadium and mall which
was supposed to be a centerpiece of his administration, but is on
hold for a festive football season to be named later.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, if Brown went public, the public could lose big time.
</P>
<P>
   Like most IPOs, ``qualified investors,'' better known as
insiders, would snap up ``pre-market'' shares.
</P>
<P>
   You know who the qualified investors would be. Name some hotel
chains, banks and corporations with interests in San Francisco, as
well as the lobbyists who represent them.
</P>
<P>
   What would the Securities and Exchange Commission think of an
IPO by Willie Brown Inc.? You know this is a guy who'd have a hard
time with the quiet period that's supposed to surround a stock
offering.
</P>
<P>
   Executives aren't supposed to hype their stock, something Brown
has been doing with himself for years. The phrase ``quiet period''
doesn't fit with a man who is all exclamation points.
</P>
<P>
   He'd have to continually say, ``You'll have to check with my
staff, and they're not allowed to talk.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, where does Brown go? For a quiet period, he
could be locked in Sony's Metreon. This greatest of San Francisco
movie fans could shuttle among 11 screens, watching ``Blue Streak''
instead of talking one, and enjoying ``Fight Club'' instead of
blood-lust campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   It would give all of us a break, too.
</P>
<P>
   If Willie Brown went public, the biggest problem he'd face is
the same one Martha Stewart faced. His face and voice are his
company, just as her face and voice are her company.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody wants to invest in a company of one person, even if that
person comes with a massive cult of personality.
</P>
<P>
   If Martha Stewart died in an unfortunate chutney-bottling
accident, her stock would go through the highly polished hardwood
floor. No one can replace Martha.
</P>
<P>
   No one can replace Willie, either. His Stepford Supervisors are
great at following his orders, but they can't follow his act.
</P>
<P>
   If Willie Brown leaves office, an event most polls say will
happen in four years, shares of his stock wouldn't be worth the
cocktail napkins they were written on.
</P>

DRAWING ON GERMAN TRADITION, OCTOBER'S A TIME FOR BEER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DOUG BLACKBURN  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The harvest is a season for celebrations and
toasts. For raising a glass to bless the bounty.
</P>
<P>
   No one does this better than the French, who have turned the
annual release of Beaujolais nouveau on the third Thursday in
November into an international gala event.
</P>
<P>
   But the Germans are not, dare we say, crying in their beer. They
have also captured the world's fancy with Oktoberfest, a nearly
200-year-old celebration.
</P>
<P>
   It began as a party honoring a prince and princess but it has
evolved into a festival that salutes that country's premier
beverage: beer.
</P>
<P>
   The craft-beer renaissance that has swept across America in the
past decade has inspired breweries big and small to fall in step,
producing their own versions of Oktoberfest.
</P>
<P>
   But what is Oktoberfest beer, which some U.S. breweries spell
with the Germanized ``K'' while others, like Boston-based Sam
Adams, with a ``C'' _ as in October Fest lager?
</P>
<P>
   ``A traditional Oktoberfest is an orange-gold beer that's malty
and stronger than a normal lager, and not very hoppy. The malt is
in the forefront of the flavor,'' explains Paul McErlean, head
brewer at the Van Dyck brew pub in Schenectady. McErlean has made a
beer in this style, though he spells it with a ``C,'' and he
reports it is selling fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's far and away the best-selling seasonal beer that we brew.
It just flies out of here the moment we make it. I don't know if
it's the name, but there's no comparison to Oktoberfest,'' McErlean
notes, explaining how this nation has embraced the harvest
celebration with gusto. ``You could basically call anything
Oktoberfest and it will sell out.''
</P>
<P>
   That is because Oktoberfests can be whatever the brewer wants
them to be. Charles Noll, at Malt River in Latham, has a
traditional Oktoberfest lager on tap, but Drew Schmidt, at the Big
House in Albany, is serving a non-fruity ale he calls ``Fest''
beer. He had produced a Vienna-style beer similar to the
traditional Oktoberfest, but it disappeared quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Peter Martin at the Troy Pub and Brewery made a
German alt (an Old World-style ale) for the annual Oktoberfest
celebration, which took place the first weekend of the month. It
also went in a hurry.
</P>
<P>
   Says Martin, ``Oktoberfests can be anything. It's tough to
define Oktoberfest. It's anything you want it to be, though it's
usually a heavier-body-type lager or ale. The way I understand it,
an Oktoberfest is any beer brewed for a festival.''
</P>
<P>
   Without question, no ``event beer'' has more flexibility than
Oktoberfests. The German festival, the mother of all Oktoberfests,
is held in Munich. It actually begins in mid-September and runs
through early October. An estimated 6 million visitors attended
this year's event, putting away some 5 million liters of beer and
200,000 pairs of pork sausages.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their variety, Oktoberfest beers also have something in
common. Explains Noll, at Malt River: ``If it's done right, you
don't want just one pint of Oktoberfest. It's the type of beer you
want a couple of.''

POLLS GIVES GIULIANI THE EDGE IN SENATE RACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LARA JAKES  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ More New Yorkers would vote against Hillary
Rodham Clinton as a U.S. Senate candidate than vote for her, a new
poll indicates.
</P>
<P>
   The survey by the Zogby International polling organization shows
the probable Democratic nominee carrying an ``unfavorable rating''
of 48.4 percent among likely voters, as opposed to her ``favorable
rating'' of 46.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   It marks the first time the potential candidate's statistical
negatives have eclipsed her positives in her still-undeclared
campaign, pollster John Zogby of Utica said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Catholics, independents and political moderates
strongly favor Clinton's likely Republican opponent, New York Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani, in the potential Senate contest, according to the
poll. That is bad news for Clinton, who will need to curry support
among those groups _ particularly in the suburbs and in upstate New
York _ in order to win.
</P>
<P>
   If they become the nominees, Clinton and Giuliani will be vying
to succeed Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the Democrat who is
retiring at the end of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's favorable rating stands at 54.5 percent, compared to
his unfavorables, which tally 35.4 percent, according to the Zogby
poll.
</P>
<P>
   The survey showed Clinton trouncing Giuliani in New York City
and among liberals, blacks and Hispanics. Overall, however,
Giuliani is leading Clinton by a 51 percent to 40 percent margin,
according to the poll.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton campaign spokesman Howard Wolfson declined to comment.
Democratic officials, however, privately complained about the poll,
charging that Zogby is partial to Giuliani since he worked on the
mayor's 1997 re-election effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things I'm proudest of is that Republicans think
I'm a Democrat and Democrats think I'm a Republican,'' said Zogby,
shrugging off the criticisms. Zogby is an enrolled Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   The survey was taken Oct. 15-18 and included interviews with 700
likely New York voters. It has a margin of error of 3.8 percentage
points.
</P>
<P>
   Zogby also tested voters' inclinations on a possible Democratic
presidential primary between Vice President Al Gore and former New
Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   The two contenders remain in a statistical dead heat, with Gore
edging Bradley in New York by a 41 percent to 37.5 percent margin.
</P>
<P>
   On the Republican side of the political aisle, Texas Gov. George
W. Bush would sweep Arizona Sen. John McCain by 48 percent to 12
percent, the poll indicates. McCain's campaign, however, won an
important endorsement this week from former Rep. Guy Molinari, the
current Staten Island borough president, signaling a split within
the state GOP. Gov. George Pataki and state Republican Party
Chairman Bill Powers support Bush.

   MUSEUM-SUIT (New York) _ For weeks, in the wake of the
controversial ``Sensation'' exhibit, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has
been talking about seizing control of the Brooklyn Museum of Art by
ousting its Board of Trustees. But the city's legal strategy has
evolved and now embraces a much more drastic solution, which is to
evict the museum and its vast holdings of artwork. City officials
acknowledge that this strategy could result in Brooklyn losing
possession of the nation's second largest art collection _ 1.5
million paintings, sculptures and decorative objects that took a

EX-CNN ANCHOR SAYS THE SKY'S THE LIMIT FOR NEW WEB VENTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MATT BEER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Former CNN financial journalist Lou Dobbs is on
a mission to change the perception that Web sites stressing stories
over selling stuff are doomed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever I hear these generalizations, I know I'm listening to
someone who doesn't understand the Web at all,'' said Dobbs, in his
trademark sonorous voice between puffs of a cigarette. ``The Web,''
he said, ``is an ever-changing world that sweeps aside anyone's set
conceptions.''
</P>
<P>
   Four months ago, Dobbs created a sort of journalistic sun flare
when he clocked out as anchor of CNN's ``Moneyline,'' the cable
news network's daily business report that was its most lucrative
program.
</P>
<P>
   Dobbs blamed his departure on CNN upper management, which he
said sent him mixed messages on his involvement with his business,
Space.com, a project he decided to pursue in June.
</P>
<P>
   Space.com (www.space.com) features an array of space-related
subjects: breaking aerospace industry news, gossip, the shooting of
horror film director John Carpenter's coming science fiction epic,
``Ghosts on Mars.'' The site sports an impressive array of talent,
including the Internet site's president, Sally Ride, the first
woman in space. It has opened bureaus at Cape Canaveral and
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   When CNN brass finally said Dobbs could not be even a passive
investor in Space.com, he quit the network.
</P>
<P>
   Headlines of a CNN front office feud followed, which Dobbs now
waved away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just fishing last month with Ted, and he said to me `I
hope you make a million dollars,''' Dobbs said, referring to CNN
founder Ted Turner.
</P>
<P>
   Dobbs said he continues to hold a grudge against some senior CNN
executives. ``I wouldn't return some phone calls,'' Dobbs said with
a sniff.
</P>
<P>
   CNN spokesman Christa Robinson said the network had no comment
on Dobbs' departure, except to say, ``Lou Dobbs? Oh, we've heard of
him.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dobbs-CNN spat is far from over. The financial anchor
appeared Oct. 4 on NBC's ``Today'' show to announce he would be
providing occasional business news commentary, which could brush up
against a non-compete clause in Dobbs' previous CNN contract.
</P>
<P>
   The move prompted CNN to issue a terse statement: ``We have a
contractual agreement with Lou Dobbs, and we expect that he will
live up to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dobbs prefers to talk about his new venture.
</P>
<P>
   Space.com is funded with Dobbs' own money and $25 million from
Venrock Associates, the venture capital company of the Rockefeller
family. Its basic business model is selling advertising, which has
also been a less-than-roaring success in stemming the red ink
spilling from many Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked for 19 years at CNN under the advertising model,''
Dobbs said. ``It works in cable. It can work for the Web.''
</P>
<P>
   Dobbs added that the site also will announce some electronic
commerce plans within the next 60 days, though he did not offer any
details.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want it all to be a big surprise,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts believe Space.com's success could be more than a
science fiction story.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the popularity of science fiction of Web sites for Babylon
5, Star Trek and Star Wars are any indication, then he has a pretty
good chance,'' said Tom Huskerson, a research associate with the
Redwood City-based Zona Research, an Internet market data company.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a firm believer in sites that are organized around
existing interest groups,'' said David Card, a senior analyst with
Jupiter Communications Inc., a New York Internet research company.
``So on that basis, I think Space.com has a chance.''

SCOTT TUROW LOOKS AT JUSTICE SERVED IN `PERSONAL INJURIES' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE STEPHENSON  
 c.1999 Special for The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Personal Injuries'' &QL; 
By Scott Turow &QL; 
(Farrar Straus &AMP; Giroux, $27) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are many lawyers publishing novels these days, but there's
no one better than Scott Turow. He doesn't just churn out
bestsellers. He WRITES them, with intelligence and depth and a feel
for our fascination with the nether regions of the law _ those back
rooms and muted conversations in which the truth comes out, deals
are struck and destinies, however illustrious or tawdry they might
be, are made.
</P>
<P>
   Turow finishes a book like clockwork, every three years:
``Presumed Innocent (1987),'' ``The Burden of Proof
(1990),''``Pleading Guilty (1993)''and ``The Laws of Our Fathers
(1996).'' Now, we have ``Personal Injuries,'' a novel meant not so
much to entertain as to make us think about ambition and
compromise, and their affect on how justice is served.
</P>
<P>
   It's the most layered and introspective book Turow has written.
That doesn't mean it's his best _ there are whole chapters that
will try a reader's patience _ but it's certainly his most
ambitious. And in Scott Turow, ambition can be a mighty impressive
thing.
</P>
<P>
   The character at the center of ``Personal Injuries'' is Robbie
Feaver (pronounced ``favor''), a personal-injury lawyer who with
his partner has been caught shortchanging the IRS. In this
instance, tax evasion is less a crime than convenient leverage _ on
the heels of the IRS agents comes U.S. Attorney Stan Sennett, who
offers to keep Feaver out of jail if he will provide evidence
against judges suspected of taking payoffs from lawyers (Feaver
among them) in exchange for favorable decisions.
</P>
<P>
   There are several judges in question, but the one Sennett really
wants is the powerful Brendan Tuohey, the man most likely to become
chief judge of Kindle County, the fictional setting of Turow's
novels. In his effort to get Tuohey, Sennett sets up an elaborate
ruse that includes fake lawyers, fake clients and fake
personal-injury cases. Project Petros, as the sting is called, will
go on for months, with Robbie Feaver attempting to record judges as
they sniff at, then swallow, his bribes.
</P>
<P>
   Turow uses these circumstances to create some memorable
characters, all laden with contradictions. Stan Sennett is an
ambitious man whose righteous convictions are served by devious and
often cutthroat tactics. Evon Miller, the FBI agent brought in to
pose as Feaver's associate and latest lover, grapples with her own
secrets (she is a poor imitation of Thomas Harris' Clarice Starling
in ``The Silence of the Lambs'') while she tries to fend off
Feaver's amorous attentions.
</P>
<P>
   The crooked judges are colorful even as they flirt with disaster
on Robbie Feaver's surveillance tapes. Barnett Skolnick is a
rambling but likeable dimwit (``There are dead men,'' Feaver says,
``who are not as dumb as Barney Skolnick'') who owes his place on
the bench to the tactics of his brother, a thug named Knuckles.
Sherman Crowthers is a huge and powerfully spoken Black man, once
one of the best defense attorneys in the county, now a judge who
rules his courtroom with rough eloquence and intimidation. And
Brendan Tuohey, the biggest prize, hides his avarice under a veneer
of serenity, protected by the loyalty of the lackeys around him.
</P>
<P>
   But the real enigma is Feaver himself, a pretty boy who appears
to have slept with every woman he has ever met (he would have sex
with a spoon if it seemed willing), yet remains devoted to his
wife, who is dying of Lou Gehrig's disease. Feaver starts the book
as a sleazy yukster, a used-car salesman in an Italian suit and a
perpetual tan, but grows in substance and stature until we almost _
ALMOST _ understand what women see in him. By the end, he is the
novel's symbolic Good Man, and he deserves the emphasis. Caught
among the criminals, the cops and the lawyers, he is the key to all
of their ambitions, but is left with nothing to call his own.
</P>
<P>
   Having created such a dense abundance of character, Turow tells
his story with a surprisingly heavy hand. This is his most
descriptive book, and that's not such a good thing. He gives us the
details of everything _ rugs, desks, buildings, courtrooms,
clothing, people and, most annoyingly, the minutiae of surveillance
(it seems as if we receive an inventory of Robbie's cameras and
microphones every time he approaches a judge over the long months
of Project Petros). Once, when Robbie walks through an innocuous
patch of woods on his way to a golf-course meeting with Brendan
Tuohey, Turow describes not only the trees and the land around him,
but the settlers who had walked that way a century before.
</P>
<P>
   It makes for some slow going, and that, unfortunately, is one of
the lingering impressions of this book: ``Personal Injuries,''
which is 400 pages long, could have lost 50 and been better for it.
There's also the matter of its narrator. George Mason, who is
Robbie Feaver's attorney, begins the novel in the first person,
establishing himself as the teller of the story. His voice fades in
and out, however, giving way without warning to an omniscient
narration in the many scenes during which George is not present
(private conversations between Evon and Robbie, for example, or
between Evon and Robbie's dying wife).
</P>
<P>
   Depending on your mood, you'll think this reappearing ``I'' is
arty or distracting. Or maybe, if you're feeling very generous,
you'll choose to look at it as a lawyer's tactic. After all, as
George tells us from the start, ``This is a lawyer's story, the
kind attorneys like to hear and tell.''
</P>
<P>
   If you want action, look elsewhere. But if you want a glimpse of
the legal profession through one of its own (Scott Turow still
practices in Chicago), this is not a bad place to be. His mistakes
are a writer's mistakes, something most lawyer-novelists don't have
the talent to make. If you want proof, just wait three years. &QL;

   Here are Anne Stephenson's capsule reviews of new books.
</P>
<P>
   ``THE POP-UP BOOK OF PHOBIAS'' &QL; 
By Gary Greenberg (Morrow, $24.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We heard about this one before we saw it, and that's always a
good sign. It has been New &AMP; Notable's policy to mock pop-up books
on the grounds that they are both silly and oxymoronic _ something
can't pop up and be a book at the same time. We prefer to think of
them as ````gadgets''.'' The last one we paid any attention to was
about golf courses, and it might have been the nadir of pop-up
books _ little greens rising at you like some dopey delusion, sand
traps floating through the air. So, when we got wind of this one,
we licked our chops, found ``moronic'' in the thesaurus and waited
for the kill. Now, we must eat crow. New &AMP; Notable has been
conquered by a pop-up book, wrestled into submission by a gadget.
Gary Greenberg, the stand-up comedian who created it, begins with
the mother of all phobias, the Dentist and the Drill. This
particular drill twists as it rises into view, and it is big enough
to roto-rooter your nostril. When it reaches dead center, it is
aimed straight at you, right at your very teeth, and behind it is a
dentist who bears more than a passing resemblance to Joseph
Mengele. You have to laugh _ what else can you do? Greenberg has
paired off the ludicrous and the macabre, and we couldn't wait to
turn the page and see what he'd do next. There are 10 phobias here,
including most of the big ones, but we won't say more. The
dentist's drill is funny whether you know it's coming or not, but
others profit from an element of surprise. Either way, phobias beat
golf courses, hands down. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``DOGS THAT KNOW WHEN THEIR OWNERS ARE COMING HOME'' &QL; 
By Rupert Sheldrake (Crown, $25) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Surely, Sheldrake is preaching to the converted when he makes
the case for studying our own pets (and not just creatures in
research labs) to foster our awareness of ``the unexplained powers
of animals.'' After all, the people most likely to buy his book are
those who agree with him, who object to our longstanding taboo
against taking pets seriously. There's nevertheless something
heartwarming about his arguments, which embrace the animals we love
as both gifted creatures and sources of scientific knowledge.
Through interviews and surveys with pet owners, veterinarians, dog
trainers and zoo keepers in the United States and Britain,
Sheldrake explores the phenomenon of telepathic communication
between people and animals _ in other words, he asks why a dog
might know 20 minutes in advance that its owner is coming home,
even when the owner is unexpected. Or how a cat hearing a ringing
telephone would know that someone it loves is on the other end of
the line. What makes an animal show unmistakable signs of agitation
a full three hours before an earthquake, or enables a horse to find
its way home across unfamiliar terrain? And why, if there are some
dogs that know their owners are coming home, are there other dogs
that don't have a clue? Are some breeds more sensitive than others?
Sheldrake explores animal empathy, the therapeutic effect of pets,
animal-to-animal telepathy, the phenomenon of bird migration, and
animal premonitions. His book is an engaging look at domesticated
creatures and the mysterious things that connect us to them. &QL; 
``PLAINSONG'' &QL; 
By Kent Haruf (Knopf, $24) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This lovely, evocative novel is set in Holt, Colo., a prairie
town so small that it takes only an hour for two boys to deliver
all of its newspapers. Those boys are Ike and Bobby Guthrie, whose
father, Tom, teaches history at the high school, and whose mother,
Ella, has taken silently to her bed and will soon move out of the
house and then out of town altogether. Other characters are
Victoria Roubideaux, a pregnant teenage girl whose mother has
locked her out of the house, and the senior McPheron brothers, two
self-described decrepit old bachelors who agree to let Victoria
come and live with them on their farm until her baby is born. Haruf
lets his characters reveal themselves slowly and compassionately,
and the story that takes shape as the ties between them grow is
oddly comforting even as they grapple with changes in their lives.
The feel of this book is not unlike that of Cormac McCarthy's later
novels, both in tone and in the atmospheric sense of place that
becomes almost a character in itself (missing is McCarthy's
trademark violence, although there is one menacing scene in which
Ike and Bobby are roughed up by a teenage bully). Haruf has written
a quietly moving book about ordinary people dealing with the
emotional twists of ordinary life. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``BROTHERS'' &QL; 
(Hyperion, $26.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Writing about my brothers is a dangerous occupation, dancing
through a minefield,'' Frank McCourt says. Maybe so, but there's
something to be said for having tissues on hand if you intend to
read this book _ you might get weepy. There are some fine writers
here _ McCourt, Tobias Wolff, Richard Ford, David Sedaris, James
Alan McPherson _ all talking about their brothers and the bonds and
conflicts between them. We were most taken, however, with the essay
by Charles P. Pierce, who is the son of a brother and the father of
brothers, but who himself is an only child. His is the clear-eyed
view from beyond: ``I have watched brothers all my life,'' he says.
``I watched them in my family growing up, and I watch my children
today, the blood speech of the code-talkers in the other bedrooms,
the swift bursts of anger and the reconciliations, all operating on
rules as foreign and distant to me as Hammurabi's Code.'' Mixed
with these essays are portraits of brothers, some well-known (the
Dalai Lama and his brother, Martin Scorsese and his), some not at
all. This was put together by the editors of ``Esquire.'' &QL;

show interest in, and somehow members of that group, now parents
and grandparents, aren't passing on the practice to their youth.
</P>
<P>
   Americans who are ages 18 to 35, Generation X, who were once
thought of as the slacker generation, indeed slack at one duty _
voting.
</P>
<P>
   No longer a glut of sniveling teens, Gen Xers are graduating
with degrees, getting hitched, buying homes, setting up 401(k)
plans and investing in the latest Internet company, which they are
probably running.
</P>
<P>
   However, even with all that adult responsibility, you can bet
that more Xers across the nation stood in lines to see ``The Blair
Witch Project'' than those who stood in lines to vote in the
September elections.Is it apathy?
</P>
<P>
   ``Politicians rant and rave about change, but when they get
elected, nothing happens,'' said Michael Growe, 32.
</P>
<P>
   A medical technician at a Scottsdale, Ariz., clinic, Growe did
not vote in September. He feels the winds of political change are
interest groups' hot air.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all the lobbyists pushing their views, a single vote
won't count,'' Growe said.
</P>
<P>
   However, he forgets the adage that Heather Locklear made famous
in her Faberge Organic Shampoo ad: ``You tell your friends and
they'll tell their friends and their friends will tell their
friends,'' so on and so forth. One vote produces many.
</P>
<P>
   Locally, since 1994, all voter turnout in the county's bi-yearly
elections has languished below 20 precent, according to the
Elections Department. And Generation X is the most lackluster group
in terms of voting.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the trend is also daunting. According to the Census
Bureau, in 1996 only 39 percent of people ages 18 to 34 cast
ballots for a presidential candidate. That compares with 60 percent
of baby boomers, people ages 35 to 64.
</P>
<P>
   Generation X's professors warn that issues demanding their
attention exist now. They point out that the political system is a
back-scratching affair between voters and candidates. Apathy is a
detriment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until younger folks get involved, no attention will get paid
to issues that hurt them,'' said Kenneth Goldstein, a
political-science professor at Arizona State University.
</P>
<P>
   X-ers need to march up the steps of their capitols and down the
D.C. Beltway, trumpeting issues such as Social Security and
Medicare reform, public versus private education, and environmental
issues, Goldstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Boomers are spanking X-ers at the polls in regards to those
issues being addressed for the future of the younger generation.
</P>
<P>
   So, is the Gen-X cohort too self-involved to care?
</P>
<P>
   Studies indicate that members of Gen-X are more likely to
volunteer than to vote. According to the 1997 Survey of Public
Participation in the Arts, among people polled about their
volunteer efforts in 1996, 35 percent of Americans ages 18 to 24
participated in ``charity work,'' and 41 percent of those ages 25
to 34 did. Only 39 percent of people ages 18 to 34 voted that same
year, a presidential election year.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Solop, a professor at Northern Arizona University in
Flagstaff who teaches a course in political participation, said his
students are aware of issues, but they feel the odds of achieving
anything are insurmountable.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are concerned with whether they (people 18 to 34 years
old) will have access to training and education programs,
insurance, adequate health care, environmental issues,'' Solop
said. ``(But) there is a sense of despair, that they can't be
effective.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Klain, a Scottsdale, Ariz., attorney, feels that despair.
He is registered to vote but hasn't cast a ballot since the 1996
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   Klain, 30, still considers himself to be concerned, civically
involved. He pays close attention to a range of issues from
education to Supreme Court vacancies to tax and Social Security
reform.
</P>
<P>
   However, ``I'm not real big on voting,'' Klain, said. ``I've
become disillusioned with the two-party system, and I get a feeling
of futility.''
</P>
<P>
   To understand the system and the issues, one must be attentive
to it. Inattentiveness is a sign of a generation reared on
entertainment, said Tom &UR; Keating, a political-science professor at
ASU.
</P>
<P>
   From television to books, everything is flashy, shocking, bright
and exciting. Keating, a boomer in his 50s, noted the stark
difference between the text-only books he read as an undergrad and
the books he teaches from.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now (books come with) four or five colors, cartoons and all
kinds of much more flashy stuff,'' Keating said.
</P>
<P>
   He concedes that some students are cognizant of the issues, but
that many lack the attention span to follow them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless you grab their interest in a class discussion early,
they're gone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Keating also attributes the lack of interest to the media's
portrayal of election campaigns. People such as Growe and Klain
believe candidates fudge on campaign promises because TV and print
reporters focus their coverage on interpreting what the candidates
mean, rather than on the simple facts of what the candidates say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the new biography of Reagan, where the author
injects himself,'' Keating said. ``The reporter judges the validity
of the candidate when there is no evidence that the reporter has
the authority to do so. Actually, candidates try to fulfill their
campaign promises at a high rate.''
</P>
<P>
   One political campaign that recently grabbed the attention of
Gen-X-ers was Jesse Ventura's run for governor of Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura, a former World Wrestling Federation character, was
ushered into Minnesota's governorship on the backs of ballots cast
by young people. Among the youngest voters casting ballots _ those
younger than age 30 _ Ventura got nearly half of those votes,
according to an exit poll conducted for the ``Minneapolis'' ``Star
Tribune'' by Voter News Service among 1,449 voters statewide.
</P>
<P>
   The point was made: When moved to vote, Gen-X is a force worth
reckoning with, but what is daunting is that it takes a former TV
personality to arouse them.
</P>
<P>
   The generation's boredom with politics is evident in college
political-science classes across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Freshmen interest in keeping up to date with politics is now
less than half of what it was in 1966, then 58 percent, according
to the American Political Science Association.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, President Kennedy had been assassinated, the
civil-rights movement was burning throughout America, and the
country's involvement in Vietnam was escalating. Still, somehow
that politically involved 58 percent has not been able to inspire
its offspring into political action.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s, freshmen interest in keeping up with political
affairs has dropped from 42 percent in 1990 to its present record
low of 26 percent, AMPSA statistics indicate.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Kissell, 22, summed up Generation X's disillusionment by
saying, ``I don't have a lot of faith in political campaigns, and
you don't vote for the lesser of two evils.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to the void of indifference, the National Council of
State Legislators has passed a resolution calling for education on
representative democracy, and the National Association of
Secretaries of State devoted its 1999 meeting to considering ways
to encourage young Americans to pay attention to politics and to
become voters.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona Secretary of State Office mails a greeting card to
teens on their 18th birthdays, reminding them to register. The
office also provides voter registration over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young people are used to using the Internet, and they can
register through the Internet,'' said Jessica Funkhouser, elections
director for the Secretary of State Office. ``We're trying to
connote turning 18 with being able to vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Secretary of State's elections department reports
that Internet registration is catching on, it hasn't translated
into a greater number of voters, especially among the young.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, maybe the Internet informed are too young yet to
vote and are fixed in a political eddy waiting for their wind of
change at 18.
</P>
<P>
   Zaira Balmaceda, 16, a Phoenix-area high school student,
provides a positive outlook for Generation Y, or the millennials,
Generation X's younger counterpart.
</P>
<P>
   Balmaceda, who said that politics is not a regular subject in
her house, still relishes a desire to back issues and choose a
candidate sans singlets. She also, believe it or not, reads the
newspaper to keep up on the issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always reading the newspaper to see what's going on and
listening to the news,'' Balmaceda said. ``These (politicians) are
the people who are going to be deciding the future in our
community.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   MARCOVIA, Honduras _ Maritza Espinar spent four terrifying days
clinging to the high branches of a tree last year after Hurricane
Mitch flattened her home in a village near here.
</P>
<P>
   When new floods in September sent a tributary of the Choluteca
River once again rising toward the place she lived, she didn't
waste any time evacuating.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get scared now when I see even a little bit of high water,''
said the soft-spoken mother of seven, who was plucked by a
helicopter from her tree-top perch after Mitch. ``It's something
you can never erase from your mind. I never thought I would make it
out alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Such stories are not uncommon around this poor, mountainous
nation of 5 million. Mitch was the worst disaster in more than a
century, killing some 9,000 people and leveling or damaging more
than 50,000 homes. Floodwaters severed roads, destroyed bridges and
wiped out crops _ bananas, sugar, cantaloupes and pond-raised
shrimp _ that provide employment for much of the rural population.
</P>
<P>
   The people of this Central American region had hoped that by
now, a year after Mitch blew ashore on Oct. 25, the storm would be
nothing more than a frightful memory.
</P>
<P>
   But the recent floods are evidence that Mitch is still having an
impact.
</P>
<P>
   In the past month, raging waters have knocked down bridges,
washed out roads, toppled houses and killed more than 20 people in
Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
   The disturbing fact is that the new floods have come not from a
hurricane, but from the normal rains that fall every year during
the wet season.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is still so much debris and sediment in the riverbeds
from Mitch that it doesn't take as much water as before to come
over the banks,'' said Phil Gelman, coordinator of emergency
services for Atlanta-based CARE, one of many international aid
groups here. ``The new floods have been very damaging
psychologically. People had just begun putting some distance
between themselves and Mitch, and now some of them are finding
themselves flooded out for the second time in a year.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, aid groups are pushing a program to help identify
and protect watersheds _ an idea backed by the Honduran government.
</P>
<P>
   Mitch's floods were exacerbated because much of the country has
been deforested by timber companies and people cutting wood for
fuel. Protecting upland areas will prevent erosion and lessen the
impact of future floods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mitch has made us aware of these things,'' said Moises
Starkman, head of the Honduran government's recovery efforts.
``Still, none of this can be done overnight.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the new floods are fresh proof that a full recovery from
Mitch will take years. While many areas _ including the Caribbean
resorts that cater to foreign tourists _ are back to normal,
Mitch's damage was so severe that officials had to draw up a new
map of Honduras, showing the new river channels left by the floods.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 40,000 people are still without permanent housing,
with 13,000 living in temporary shelters set up by the government
and relief organizations, according to Honduran officials. The rest
are crowded in with friends or relatives.
</P>
<P>
   While main roads have been passable for months, there are dozens
of temporary bridges and countless hastily-repaired wash-outs on
dangerous, winding mountain highways that remain vulnerable to new
flooding.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign governments have pledged $2.7 billion in aid to
Honduras, with much of that intended for infrastructure like roads
and bridges. In most cases the work hasn't yet begun because the
process of obtaining funds and drawing up plans is only now being
completed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The permanent repairs on the bridges and roads will begin
soon,'' Starkman said. ``The good news is that we have been moving
forward on housing and sanitation. There were predictions that
after Mitch we would have widespread famine and outbreaks of
disease, and we managed to avoid that. What we have now is not
paradise, but it's much better than before.''
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of international aid groups _ including CARE, Ox-Fam and
the Red Cross _ have pitched in, building hundreds of new homes.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, the poor are receiving better-built houses than
they've ever known _ usually small, cement-block structures of a
few hundred square feet with tin roofs and no electricity or
in-door plumbing. But for people who lived in dirt-floor adobe
huts, the improvement is dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our house was taken by the river, along with everything we
owned,'' said Nettie Roosevelt, 17, who recently moved to a new
house in a community being funded by CARE. ``This new house is very
nice. Our old one was rented and it leaked every time it rained.''
</P>
<P>
   Here in Marcovia, several international relief agencies are
building an entire new town, relocating people from six rural
villages that were flooded. The municipal government helped obtain
land on high ground, and local sugar growers provided machinery to
clear roads and truck in materials.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we told the people they would have to build the houses
themselves, many of them sat down and cried,'' said Carolina
Gamero, an architect who, working with CARE, designed the new town
and has overseen its construction.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had never done construction before, but they learned,''
Gamero said. ``At first many people were reluctant to say they
wanted to move here. But now that the houses are up, I get new
people every day saying they want to move here.''
</P>
<P>
   She wanted to wait until the town's sewer and water systems were
complete before moving the residents in, but the recent floods
created a new emergency. Temporary latrines have been set up, and
water is being trucked in.
</P>
<P>
   With the construction site suddenly transformed into a town, aid
workers are facing new challenges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Building the houses was the easy part,'' Gamero said. ``What
we have to do now is get the residents to make it a community.''
</P>
<P>
   Residents are being asked to set up committees to plan how they
will deal with sanitation, rubbish disposal, employment and other
issues. Many lived in rural isolation previously, and now must
adjust to being in close quarters with neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had one man say he had never used a latrine before,'' Gamero
said, ``and ask why should he start using one now.''

<P>
   MACAU _ The checkered history of this indolent 446-year-old
Portuguese enclave is about to end, and few are weeping as China
prepares to take over.
</P>
<P>
   Macau is where the Hollywood swashbuckler Errol Flynn tried to
recoup his gambling losses by introducing cock-fighting in the
1930s.
</P>
<P>
   It is where spies and mercenaries flocked to swap stories over
vinho verde during World War II when the rest of the world honored
Portugal's neutrality and transformed Macau into the Casablanca of
Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Four hundred years ago Macau was far richer. Portuguese traders
dined on plates of gold, enjoying the fruits a century-long world
monopoly on trade in silk, gold, porcelain and silver with Japan
and China.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there was always a seamy side to Macau's wealth. The
Portuguese imported slaves from Africa to heave bales onto sailing
schooners. Some of the slaves would escape on boats and turn into
the legendary pirates of the South China Sea. Macau also had its
share of the opium trade.
</P>
<P>
   Revenues from Macau's shallow seaport evaporated when Britain
seized the deep-water port of Hong Kong in 1841 and it became the
linchpin of the region's commerce. About 20 years later, Portuguese
Gov. Isidoro Francisco Guimaraes saved Macau from ruin by granting
the first gambling licenses.
</P>
<P>
   Out of all this, Macau has grown into one of the oldest, most
lucrative gambling resorts in the world.
</P>
<P>
   With casinos have come wide-open prostitution and police
corruption, along with recurrent battles between Chinese Triad
criminal syndicates in which 35 people have died just this year.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve years ago, China and Portugal had no trouble agreeing
that the Portuguese should end their occupation, setting a deadline
just before the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides have stuck to this pact with little friction. And so
on the evening of December 19, 2,500 guests from Portugal, Macau
and China are due to dine here in a temporary steel-and-glass
banquet hall that will look like a giant Chinese lantern
overlooking the Pearl River estuary.
</P>
<P>
   Just before midnight they will toast the end of nearly 450 years
of Portuguese occupation. When the clock in the Macau cathedral
strikes 12:00, Portugal will lower its flag on the last and oldest
Western enclave in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   At one instant after midnight on December 20, the flag of the
People's Republic of China will rise over Macau. An assemblage of
Chinese communist dignitaries, including President Jiang Zemin,
will smile with satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   Fireworks will light the sky and this 8-square-mile territory
will become part of China under a guarantee of 50 years of
self-rule under Chinese sovereignty, in a form of self-government
similar to Hong Kong's.
</P>
<P>
   Quickly to be sworn in as the new Macau governor is one of
Macau's richest businessmen, 44-year-old Canadian-educated banker
Edmund Ho Hau-wah. Already a member of the Beijing communist
establishment, Ho is a Macau delegate on China's powerful standing
committee of the National People's Congress in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most prominent and powerful participants in the
evening will be billionaire gambling proprietor Stanley Ho, 77,
whose corporation operates all of Macau's 10 gambling casinos under
a monopoly franchise he was granted by Portuguese authorities when
he submitted the highest bid 37 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Though the new governor and the gambling proprietor are not
blood relatives, they are friends and fellow shareholders in
Macau's television network. The casino proprietor was one of the
most influential backers of the governor's selection.
</P>
<P>
   By far, the most important decision confronting Gov. Ho is
whether to renew Stanley Ho's gambling monopoly when the current
Macau casino license expires in 2001. Ho's company has reportedly
been paying the Macau treasury 31.8 percent of the calculated net
profits of the casinos, or about $750 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone is waiting to see whether the new governor splits up
the franchise, issuing 10 new licenses for each of the 10 casinos,
or lets Stanley Ho keep his Macau gambling monopoly. Not content to
rely on chance, Stanley Ho has been busily developing a new
gambling venture in the
</P>
<P>
   Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   But at least in the first few weeks, this will be a far less
contentious, emotion-packed handover than when the British somewhat
reluctantly pulled out of Hong Kong on July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   As the Chinese takeover approaches, almost no public dissent has
arisen among the 96 percent of 440,000 Macau residents who speak
Chinese as a first language. Even among Macau's 1.8 percent of
native Portuguese-speakers, acquiescence has been widespread.
</P>
<P>
   One explanation is that Portugal has been eager for two decades
to liquidate this last remnant of its empire, so long as it can do
so with a modicum of dignity.
</P>
<P>
   Another is that Portugal never encouraged strong Hong Kong-style
democratic institutions either in Macau or any of its colonies. So
Macau has no real focal point for anti-Beijing protests of the kind
that broke out in Hong Kong before the British colony's handover.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in Macau are not so concerned about democratic
protections, or even about human rights protections, as they are in
Hong Kong,'' said Macau legislative assembly delegate Ng Kuok
Cheong, one of Macau's few vocal democratic leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese who settled in this sunwashed enclave were largely
farmers looking for a better living, he said, while Hong Kong
tended to draw educated Chinese looking for intellectual freedom or
hard-charging business opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the flag, the handover probably won't change much for
the 7 million tourists who annually contribute 40 percent of
Macau's revenues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, this will be a big historic moment,'' says Maria Helena
de Senna Fernandes, deputy head of the Macau Tourist Office. ``But
for tourism, it is business as usual.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Beijing's puritanical streak, Chinese leaders have made
clear that they are not going to interfere with the prevailing
atmosphere of hedonism-for-profit.
</P>
<P>
   Next year in Macau, visitors can still eat African chicken and
drink soft Douro wine at languid bars until they imagine they're in
Portuguese Mozambique 50 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   There will still be nubile hookers in four-inch platform shoes
who approach men in the elevators of the five-star Hotel Lisboa,
offering themselves for 500 patacas (US$66).
</P>
<P>
   There will still be casinos as busy as stock exchanges where it
isn't hard to lose US$250,000 in baccarat in half an hour.
</P>
<P>
   There will still be the murderous loan sharks called ``chip
boys'' who lurk near the cashier's window, offering to let losers
keep on gambling by taking out a high-interest loan from one of the
Triad criminal mobs.
</P>
<P>
   In short, this will still be Macau.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MACAU _ Here is a capsule history of Macau, the last and oldest
Western enclave on the Asian continent that is about to return to
Chinese rule:
</P>
<P>
   1535 _ Imperial bureaucrats of China's Ming Dynasty allow
Portuguese vessels to dock and conduct trade in Macau port.
</P>
<P>
   1543-1639 _ Portugal enjoys a de facto monopoly on trade between
China and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   1553 _ Portuguese sailors set up their first permanent
settlement on Macau, telling the Chinese they needed a place to dry
goods damaged by water.
</P>
<P>
   1557 _ Portuguese establish a walled village begin paying ground
rents for the right to live on the Macau peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   1622 _ Dutch vessels attack Macau in an effort to break
Portugal's century-long monopoly of trade with China and Japan. The
attack is repelled, but Dutch and British renew efforts to cut into
Portugal's trade.
</P>
<P>
   1700s _ Macau declines economically as China crimps trade and
rejects Portuguese envoys.
</P>
<P>
   1845 _ Portugal expels Chinese customs officials and declares
the Macau peninsula a free port, then expands its territory by
seizing nearby Taipa and Coloane islands a few years later.
</P>
<P>
   About 1860 - The Portuguese governor issues the first gambling
licences in Macau.
</P>
<P>
   1887 _ China's weak Qing imperial dynasty signs a ``Treaty of
Commerce and Friendship'' recognizing Portuguese sovereignty over

   MARCOVIA, Honduras _ The walls are unadorned cement blocks, the
floor is poured concrete, the roof made from plain sheets of metal.
The kitchen is a lean-to out back with a small, smoky cooking fire.
</P>
<P>
   But Rita Galvez proudly sits inside the tiny structure, holding
her breath. To her, this diminutive house _ the size of a typical
two-car American garage _ may as well be a millionaire's mansion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never dreamed I would have a house like this,'' she says,
gazing with wide eyes at her 400-square-foot, four-room bungalow.
``Sometimes I talk with friends from my old village and I still
can't believe I am living here.''
</P>
<P>
   One year after Hurricane Mitch devastated Central America, life
is getting better for thousands of the killer storm's victims.
Although new flooding this fall has brought more misery to many of
those left homeless by Mitch, a massive rebuilding program
spearheaded by aid groups from around the world has made
significant progress.
</P>
<P>
   A dramatic example is here in Marcovia, a low-lying village in
south Honduras, a few miles from the Gulf of Fonseca on the Pacific
coast. Mitch's torrential rains turned the normally placid
Choluteca River into a raging force that inundated miles of the
flat coastal plain.
</P>
<P>
   Small villages were swept away or covered with mud to the
rooftops, and dozens of people drowned. Prized farm animals were
lost, along with the sugar cane, cantaloupe and pond-raised shrimp
that provided most of the work in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based CARE, Ox-Fam, the Red Cross and other
international aid agencies joined forces to build a whole new town
on high ground a few miles outside flood-prone Marcovia. The new
village is called ``Renacer Marcovia,'' or ``Reborn Marcovia.''
</P>
<P>
   It spreads across 70 acres of pasture, row upon row of small,
square houses. The streets are still muddy in places, and children
bath in a stream that winds through the property. Sewer and water
lines have yet to be installed, but temporary latrines and
trucked-in water are an improvement over what many of the poor
residents lived with previously.
</P>
<P>
   ``My old house had a dirt floor,'' said Galvez, who now sweeps
her new home's cement floor several times a day, stepping carefully
over a threshold poured in the doorway that is inscribed with the
family's name. ``It only had two rooms and no windows. We had nine
people living there.''
</P>
<P>
   The new town was designed by Carolina Gamero, a Honduran
architect. In an exhausting year of work, she has seen the town
rise before her eyes, an accomplishment that many residents never
believed would happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of them didn't want to leave the places where they lived
before,'' she said. ``At first, they didn't like this place because
it was hot and had few trees. But as the houses have come up, they
are starting to see what we envisioned.''
</P>
<P>
   The residents were required to build the houses themselves, with
aid workers teaching them how to lay block, square up walls and mix
cement. Some 600 homes are now finished, with another 600 to go.
The town will eventually house about 8,000 residents.
</P>
<P>
   Gamero, 35, now walks around town, overseeing construction
crews, pushing for faster work, resolving small conflicts. She is
constantly praised and hugged, often by proud new homeowners with
tears in their eyes. She is also begged by doubters who didn't
commit to work on the new town but now want in.
</P>
<P>
   ``For months we came here and it was some new problem every
day,'' she said. ``It was 120 degrees at times and people didn't
want to work. They didn't believe we could do it. Now we walk
around and see children playing and it's becoming a real town.''

 UNDATED: ... they have  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``If they don't, they are in violation of the law and they will
lose any federal funding,'' says Howard Clery, who wrote most of
the law. To get the law passed, the Clerys rallied a dozen parents
of murdered students from all over the country to lobby Congress.
</P>
<P>
   One might think that campus security is a no-brainer: Who would
be against it? But colleges have thrown up numerous roadblocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're afraid to lose money, they're afraid to lose
enrollment and alumni giving,'' says Connie. The Clerys feel the
laws they have pushed for have closed many loopholes, but they
remain vigilant _ ``pit bulls,'' as she puts it. Schools that used
to hide behind the confidentiality of student records must now
disclose the names of those charged with violent crimes so that
other students can be protected.
</P>
<P>
   ``A reporter once asked Harvard about the punishment for a
campus rape,'' Howard says, ``and the dean said it was none of
their business. It had been handled through the campus judicial
system. That's what we call a coverup.''
</P>
<P>
   So the Clerys set out to change the law. Under the old system at
many colleges, victims could bring neither character witnesses nor
lawyers to the campus hearings, while the accused could. The Campus
Sexual Assault Victims Bill of Rights assures the same rights for
both parties _ and makes a rapist's punishment, and whether he
remains on campus, public information.
</P>
<P>
   Campus police logs, many of them formerly closed even to student
reporters, are now required to be open to the public. (The Clerys
were assisted by an editor of the Harvard Crimson, who wrote the
law.) Another Security on Campus law mandates that crime statistics
be reported to the US Department of Education, or campuses will be
fined $25,000 per infraction. (The Clerys have recently
investigated six schools and all were found guilty of failing to
report crime.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Most colleges do not want to have rape exposed, and religious
schools are the worst,'' says Howard, 69. ``They say, `We teach
morals,' and all that, and rape blows the whole thing out of the
water.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clerys and their son, Howard III, 40, who is treasurer of
Security on Campus, can rattle off case after case of violent
campus crimes, enough to make parents want to send their child to a
deserted island instead of college. They're currently bothered by
the swiftness with which campus security cleans up a crime scene,
often leaving little evidence behind.
</P>
<P>
   And they are horrified by binge drinking: 80 percent of violent
campus crime is alcohol-related. The most recent law they worked on
requires that a student arrested for selling or using drugs must
forfeit any federal scholarship money and can only reapply to
school a year later _ with drug testing.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Change for the better
</P>
<P>
   Still, they see some positive changes, with the presidents of
113 colleges banding together for a major advertising campaign
against student drinking. More administrators, they say, are
cracking down on underage drinking, calling the police themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Next, the Clerys are turning their attention to the college
admissions process. If applications can include such questions as
those about your parents' income and what they do for a living, why
can't they ask if you have ever been arrested and convicted of a
felony or of drunken driving? And, while students are submitting
their physical forms, why not send along a drug test, too?
</P>
<P>
   The Clerys don't just criticize; each year, they recognize
progress. They recently gave Michigan State University the Jeanne
Clery Award for Campus Safety: The campus has 50 armed police
officers, 50 security officers, a SWAT team, and an undercover
narcotics force, more than a decent-sized town.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, they honored Boston University for its openness in
reporting campus crime. Today, they are disappointed to hear about
a recent campus rape at BU, along with allegations by an earlier
victim that the school did little to protect her.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen years ago, Connie and Jeanne Clery won the Eastern US
regionals in a mother-daughter tennis tournment. Connie is 67 years
old now, a former soccer-and-tennis mom who would never have
dreamed about speaking to the PTO, much less Congress. But since
her daughter's death, she has traveled the country, appearing on
talk shows and before congressional committees to plead for campus
safety.
</P>
<P>
   Though Lehigh University erected a pavilion in memory of Jeanne
Clery, her parents' activism remains a living monument. ``You
couldn't have paid me a million dollars to get up and speak
before,'' Connie Clery says. ``But Jeannie's death has freed me.
I'm not afraid of anything or anybody anymore.''

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Throughout high school, Jeanne Clery had her heart set on
following her two older brothers to Tulane University. A ranked
tennis player in the mid-Atlantic region, Clery wanted a Southern
school where she could play the game all year. She loved tennis.
And she adored her brothers.
</P>
<P>
   But during her senior year in high school, a Tulane student was
murdered, and the Clery family reconsidered. ``We panicked,''
recalls Connie Clery, Jeanne's mother. ``We starting scrounging
around for a school near here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Here'' was Bryn Mawr, Pa., a suburb on Philadelphia's Main
Line. The Clerys visited Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pa., an
hour away from their home. Jeanne fell in love with the leafy
campus on a hill and enrolled there in the fall of 1985. She played
on the tennis team, garnered good grades, and made fast friends.
</P>
<P>
   On April 5, 1986, Jeanne Clery was found dead in her dorm room.
She had been raped, sodomized, beaten, and strangled. She had been
attacked with a broken bottle. Her assailant returned to the scene
minutes later thinking he had dropped his wallet. That is when he
bit her on her face and breasts. To make certain she was dead.
</P>
<P>
   Those teeth marks _ plus his bragging about the crime to friends
_ resulted in the first-degree murder conviction of Joseph Henry, a
Lehigh sophomore who lived off campus. Henry has been on death row
since 1987. He has exhausted most of his appeals.
</P>
<P>
   There have been many times when Jeanne Clery's family feels that
it, too, has been sentenced to death row. As Connie Clery puts it:
``Joseph Henry not only viciously killed our sweet, loving,
beautiful daughter, but he killed nine other people that morning _
his family and our family. He is a mass murderer.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clerys' grief was quickly followed by outrage as they
discovered the security gaps on campus that resulted in Jeanne
being murdered as she slept in her room. During the trial, evidence
showed that the three ``automatically locking'' doors leading to
her room had been taped by students so that the locks were
disabled. Other students paid by Lehigh to check all such doors had
shirked their jobs that night; instead, they had all gone to a
party. That year, in Jeanne's dorm alone, there had been 141
reports of propped doors.
</P>
<P>
   The night of Joseph Henry's burglary-and-killing mission, he
walked unhampered past the three security doors. Henry worked
part-time in maintenance for the university, and students had
lodged complaints about his behavior to administrators. Six months
before the murder, he was charged with throwing a rock through a
student's window and threatening female students.
</P>
<P>
   It was 6 a.m. when he tried the first door he came to. He found
it unlocked, because Jeanne's roommate had lost her key and Jeanne
had left it open for her. Jeanne was asleep; her roommate was gone
for the night.
</P>
<P>
   Testimony also revealed that 46 violent crimes had occurred at
Lehigh the year before Jeanne Clery arrived _ none of them reported
to prospective students and parents. ``What we didn't know and what
Jeanne didn't know cost her her life,'' says Connie Clery today.
</P>
<P>
   The Clerys sued Lehigh, and out of their grief and their
settlement was born Security on Campus. To date, the nonprofit
advocacy organization has won passage of 27 laws _ five federal,
the rest state _ regarding campus safety and crime reporting. It is
located in King of Prussia, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, Connie Clery received the Heinz Family
Foundation Rose Achievement Award in Boston. The award is given
annually to a woman survivor of violence for her work in achieving
an end to such violence. ``The message of Security on Campus is so
important in Boston,'' says Barbara Wandyes, the Rose Fund's
executive director. ``There is a total of 87 colleges and
universities in the Boston area and 39 in the city of Boston
alone.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not the first ``rose'' award Connie Clery has received. In
1990, President Bush invited the couple to the Rose Garden, where
they were honored during National Crime Victims Rights Week.
</P>
<P>
   For Connie and Howard Clery, the Rose Fund award is a happy
homecoming to their favorite city. Connie and Howard both grew up
in Massachusetts. Connie went on to study language at Barnard
College. Howard graduated from Dartmouth, where he also received a
master's in business administration. The two met in 1955 while
working at Gillette in Boston; they married the next year.
</P>
<P>
   Job transfers followed, with the Clerys eventually settling near
Philadelphia. While she raised their three children, he became a
successful entrepreneur. But their contented suburban lives ended
on that April day when police cruisers pulled up into their
driveway with the unthinkable news. After the trial and settlement
with Lehigh _ which included the stipulation of key cards for every
campus building _ Howard Clery sold his business and he and Connie
began a new life's mission.
</P>
<P>
   At the bottom of the stairwell in Jeanne's old dorm is this
plaque that Lehigh erected at the Clerys' request: ``Lest we forget
the meaning of her death, we must protect one another so that her
life will not have been in vain.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That,'' Connie Clery says over lunch in Boston, ``is what our
campaign is about. Saving lives.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Changing the law
</P>
<P>
   The labor of love has resulted in drastic changes in both campus
security and the reporting of campus crime. The year Jeanne Clery
was murdered, 2 percent of colleges and universities reported
campus felonies to the FBI. Thanks to the Jeanne Clery Disclosure
of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act, all
schools must publish crime statistics and what type of security
force they have.

<P>
   CHANNELVIEW, Texas _ Karla Land never knows what the air will
smell like when she steps outside her motorcycle shop here on the
edge of a highway near Houston. Will it be a dirty sock day? A
rotten egg day? Or one of those days when the foulness in the air
simply defies description?
</P>
<P>
   For years, the grim joke has been that the noxious odor coming
from the forest of oil and chemical industry smokestacks in this
blue-collar area must be ``the smell of money.''
</P>
<P>
   But now that the Houston metropolitan area has overtaken Los
Angeles as the nation's smog capital, it is not so funny any more _
particularly to supporters of Governor George W. Bush. Even
admirers warn that Texas's pollution problems could harm his bid
for president just as the filthy water in Boston Harbor hurt
Massachusetts governor Michael Dukakis's campaign in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants to take care of a whole nation and he can't even take
care of Texas,'' scoffed Land, 46, who frequently suffers sinus
infections and coughing spells that she believes are triggered by
pollution.
</P>
<P>
   This week, environmentalists plan to launch the first of what
will probably be a series of attacks on Bush's environmental
record, charging that his industry-friendly policies since taking
office in 1995 helped create an air pollution crisis. The 24 worst
smog readings in the United States this year were in Texas, while
federal regulators threaten and prod the state to take stronger
action.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush supporters, including top environmental officials from
his father's presidential administration, say the mounting attacks
unfairly hold Bush responsible for Texas's enormous environmental
problems, while denying him credit for efforts to solve them. Bush
recently signed a bill to clean up some of the state's dirtiest
power plants, for example.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is the air cleaner since I became governor? The answer is
yes,'' said Bush in an oft-quoted statement that environmentalists
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   The real George W. Bush, friends say, shares the core values of
his father, President Bush, who wanted to be recalled as ``the
environmental president.'' The elder Bush often clashed with
environmentalists, deriding Vice President Al Gore as ``ozone
man,'' but he also signed landmark clean-air legislation as well as
the first treaty to combat global warming.
</P>
<P>
   Though the younger Bush has not made the environment a
significant part of either of his two campaigns for governor,
friends say he, too, wants to leave a legacy of environmental
improvement. A hunter, fisherman, and jogger on the trails of
Austin, Governor Bush shares a zeal for the outdoors with his
parachute-jumping, speed boat-driving father.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will be the next president of the United States, and when I
leave office, the air will be cleaner, the water will be cleaner,
and the environment will be better. Tell me how I'm going to make
it happen,'' Bush reportedly told conservative environmental
leaders at a meeting in Austin last spring.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike his father, George W. Bush has had to prove his
environmental credentials in the rough and tumble world of Texas
politics, where the petrochemical industry is strong, the
environmental movement is weak, and the Legislature is skeptical of
government programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no real environmental movement here, so it is not a
significant part of our policy,'' conceded Andrew Sansom, executive
director of Texas Parks and Wildlife, whose board members are
appointed by Bush. Sansom, however, also served with Bush's
predecessor as governor, Ann Richards, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps as a result of the lack of an environmental movement,
Texas industries release more chemicals into the environment than
any other state or Canadian province, though the total amount of
emissions is declining. Meanwhile, with few checks on development
and less than 3 percent of the state in public hands, cities such
as Houston have become a tangle of highway construction designed to
accommodate the growth.
</P>
<P>
   Against that backdrop, Sansom regards Bush as an environmental
pioneer, working cooperatively with industry to balance
environmental and economic concerns. For instance, Bush recently
announced a deal to protect almost 7,000 acres of important bird
habitat in exchange for allowing Dow Chemical and the state highway
department to fill wetlands elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you have with him is a very unique sort of paradigm shift
toward a more thoughtful and stewardship-oriented approach'' to the
environment than past governors, said Sansom.
</P>
<P>
   But critics say Bush, a former oil executive, mostly rides the
political tides of Texas, seldom taking tough environmental stands
unless the pressure is overwhelming. Bush, for example, reversed
his position in favor of a nuclear waste repository along the
Mexican border only after extensive protests by the Mexican
government.
</P>
<P>
   More commonly, say Texas activists, Bush's policies seem aimed
at pleasing industry and property rights groups. For example, he
opposed federal intervention to protect the rare Barton Springs
salamander, an amphibian that lives in one of the most popular
swimming areas in Austin, on the grounds that it could limit
development. Bush said he was concerned about any action ``that has
even the potential to impact the use of private property.''
</P>
<P>
   And activists say Bush makes little effort to balance the
political playing field with his appointments and choice of
advisers on environmental issues.
</P>
<P>
   Most controversially, he convened numerous private meetings with
industry leaders, whose firms and representatives had given
$260,648 to his 1998 gubernatorial campaign, to discuss ways to
reduce pollution from their older facilities.

 CHANNELVIEW:, Texas: ... older facilities.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The public joined the discussion only after the group had
devised a ``voluntary'' cleanup plan that, so far, has produced few
results.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love for'' top Bush administration officials ``to talk to
the people most affected by air pollution, the people who live next
to those refineries, and get their input,'' said Jim Marston,
director of the Environmental Defense Fund's Texas office.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas Morning News columnist Timothy O'Leary, a fan of the
governor who once worked for his father, warned Governor Bush this
year that his environmental record in Texas could come back to
haunt him.
</P>
<P>
   He recalled the 1988 presidential election when Vice President
Bush turned the pollution issue against Dukakis, charging that
Dukakis was allowing 70 tons of sewage sludge to be dumped into the
harbor each day.
</P>
<P>
   ``My opponent's solution to this pollution: delay, fight,
anything but cleanup,'' the elder Bush fumed in a memorable TV ad.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven years later, O'Leary wrote in a column addressed to
Governor Bush, ``You are vulnerable in the same way that Mr.
Dukakis was vulnerable,'' especially on the issue of air pollution.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Bush's 4 1/2 years in office have seen Texas cities
encountering increasing problems in meeting federal standards for
ozone pollution. The US Environmental Protection Agency is about to
downgrade its rating of air quality in San Antonio and Austin, and
is threatening to withhold highway funds for Dallas-Fort Worth
unless the state submits a comprehensive cleanup plan.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 7, the state reached a new low when Houston had its 44th
day of unhealthy ozone levels this year, surpassing Los Angeles,
the national smog champion since the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Los Angeles has spent the last 15 to 20 years making serious
inroads in addressing their problems,'' said Pamela Berger,
Houston's environmental policy director. ``Houston has, by
contrast, been able to avoid many of the hard decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Houston's problems are so severe that industries face a
mandate to cut nitrogen oxide emissions by 85 percent by 2007 or
the eight-county metropolitan region will lose billions in highway
funds. Even if all the cars stopped being driven tomorrow, the city
would still violate federal ozone standards because the industrial
pollution is so extreme.
</P>
<P>
   EPA officials say that the Bush administration, along with the
cities of Houston and Dallas, have worked much harder to end the
smog problems over the past year or two, but there have been few
concrete actions. In fact, the Legislature, with Bush's approval,
scrapped a major air improvement program in 1995, canceling a $130
million vehicle emissions testing system because of driver protest.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's major personal initiative on air pollution, the voluntary
cleanup of old power plants, raised doubts about his commitment to
improvements when notes from meetings of the industry group that
drew up the plan made it clear that some firms wanted to use the
program for good publicity without actually cutting pollution.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Bush administration officials say their boss got a black
eye when he deserves credit for tackling an issue that almost every
other governor ducks. When the voluntary plan did not pan out, they
add, Bush supported a mandatory power plant cleanup, which will
remove the pollution equivalent of five million cars from the road.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Bush aides urge the public to take a longer view of the
pollution, blaming this year's increase in smog on the state's hot,
dry weather.
</P>
<P>
   ``Progress has been made in Texas if you look at the longer time
period, say 20 years,'' said Barry McBee, the former chairman of
the Texas Natural Resources Conservation Commission, which
regulates air emissions. ``Is there work to be done yet? Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   So far in the presidential campaign, Bush is taking positions to
the right of Vice President Al Gore on environmental concerns,
opposing a treaty to combat global warming that Gore negotiated. In
a dust-up over Texas air pollution last week, Gore charged that
Bush ``carries water _ dirty water _ for the chemical industry,
while a Bush spokesman branded Gore an extremist with ``a long
history of weird and extreme environmental ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bush allies say that their candidate's brand of
``compassionate conservatism'' extends to stewardship of the
environment. Also, they say that his policies as president would be
a far cry from the assault on the nation's major environmental laws
that some members of the GOP launched when the party took over
Congress in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Bush has assembled a group of influential environmental
leaders _ including the first EPA administrator, William
Ruckleshaus, and John Turner, President Bush's former Fish and
Wildlife Service director _ to develop a conservative approach to
the environment. Turner, who now heads the Conservation Fund, has
led his group to new prominence, protecting 500,000 acres from
development in private conservation this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am convinced that if he becomes president, he will be
personally committed to a positive legacy of environmental
stewardship. I think part of his core values is a love of the
outdoors,'' said Turner, whose group has donated 70,000 acres to
Texas under Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, some Bush watchers expect him to have a more expansive
environmental vision as he makes the switch from the somewhat
cloistered world of Texas to the nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he is an enlightened enough person that he will be
able to grasp the greater diversity of the country as opposed to
the situation in Texas,'' said Sansom. ``But what should be
instructive for him is there are some models in Texas that he can
use.''
</P>
<P>
   But such talk does not impress Karla Land as she leads a
reporter on a tour of the contaminated areas of the Channelview
region, which recently recorded the highest ozone levels in Texas
in 10 years. As far as she can tell, Bush has done little to help.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what hell looks like,'' she said.

NO MERCY FOR POOR TENANTS IN MASS. 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Governor Paul Cellucci of Massachusetts has appointed himself
chief landlord and leech, leading the call to bleed apartment
dwellers dry. Speaking before the Rental Housing Association of the
Greater Boston Real Estate Board, Cellucci said he would veto any
new legislation for state housing subsidies despite runaway rents
in Boston. He also said he would block any attempt to bring back
rent control.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will not waive the rules of the competitive free market,''
Cellucci said. He added, ``The free market got us into this
situation, and it will be the free market that gets us out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The audience of about 100 fellow leeches cheered the governor.
Housing advocates and Boston politicians groaned. Two months ago
Mayor Menino said, ``We just don't have the partnership with the
federal government anymore, or much of one with state government.''
Upon hearing Cellucci's latest speech, Menino said, ``The market
hasn't handled the problem because there's not enough support out
there to help build affordable housing.''
</P>
<P>
   The free market forces, or rather, the forces that freed the
market from conscience by persuading the state's voters to kill
rent control five years ago, act as if they owe nothing to the
collective good of the city. In their mind rent control was just
the beginning of a bonanza _ the average studio in Boston's Jamaica
Plain section has gone from $549 a month in 1995 to $959 today.
</P>
<P>
   It is clear, as Cellucci and the 100 leeches celebrated the free
market at the glitzy Seaport Hotel, that they do not want to hear
how the market has closed in on families who cram into small
apartments with other families. The number of families who are
huddling up together, perhaps 5,000, has grown to a level where
housing advocates call them the ``invisible homeless.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember going into a house and there were 20 people living
there,'' said Jamaica Plain housing activist Norma Rosario in an
interview last May in the Globe. ``When the landlord walked in, the
children rushed in the closet.''
</P>
<P>
   And when the landlords do not recoil at the sight and outright
evict them, Boston-area tenants are increasingly being forced to
undergo slow torture. In Cambridge at least 40 percent of renters
are forking over more than 30 percent of their income toward rent,
the maximum level that is considered affordable. In Boston, over
37,000 tenants, enough to burst out of Fenway Park, pay 50 percent
or more of their income in rent.
</P>
<P>
   The response of government has been appalling. Last winter the
federal government slashed funding for the homeless in Boston by 40
percent. Between 1994 to 1997, Massachusetts's share of federal
funds for housing was cut by 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Rent control surely had its anecdotal abuses that locked the
truly deserving out of apartments, but rents without control are
far more abusive to the multitude. City Hall housing adviser Pat
Canavan has said: ``If we don't do something collectively, as a
region, it will have implications none of us want to see. It will
become more difficult for young people to come in and find work.''
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Gornstein, executive director of the Citizens Housing and
Planning Association, has said, ``I think in terms of what it will
take to change this is that housing will have to be put on the
radar screen like education and health care, and if it is not
elevated, then we won't make a dent in the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The first step is for Cellucci and the leeches to admit that
there is a problem. Right now they reflexively pooh-pooh anything
that smacks of controls. Last year, Edwin Shanahan, executive
director of the state Rental Housing Association, said that without
rent control, ``the city is very, very much alive again.''
</P>
<P>
   For the moment it is _ for those with money. But recent major
studies strongly suggest that one of the major threats to continued
economic development in Boston and its near suburbs is the cost of
housing. The threat is so obvious that religious leaders such as
Cardinal Bernard Law of Boston have called it a ``critical growth
issue,'' a problem ``we can either take on rationally or wait until
it has done this area serious economic damage.''
</P>
<P>
   So it is time for Cellucci to stop saying things like ``a hot
economy comes at a price,'' as if it is perfectly acceptable that
the price is being paid by families who pay so much in rent that
they could never afford the down payment for a house. It is time
for the leeches to stop talking about the infusion of wealthy
high-tekkies and think about the housing choices those tekkies are
going to make when they start pushing around innocent tykes.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci says he will not ``waive the rules of the competitive
free market.'' If he is not careful, many people whom we need to
maintain the vitality of this city and state will wave goodbye.

   LIFE IN AMERICA 1021 _ Grand Mesa lover sees (and sells)
everything _ GRAND MESA, Colo. _ The house is too small for the
treasures. One corner is crowded with ``I fish therefore I lie''
baseball caps, Old Dutch cleanser and Powderhorn sweat shirts,
another corner overflows with handmade dream catchers, postcards
and books about Grand Mesa. ``I need more room,'' said Treasure
House owner Joanne Taylor, scanning the 800-plus-square-foot
building from her vantage point behind the counter, which also is
stacked with things like newspapers and candy, treasures to the
right person. The permanent treasure, though, the one beyond pop
rocks and pewter jewelry, is outside the window. Right now it's a
palette of autumn, oak brush leaves rusted auburn like barn door
hinges and the pine and spruce forest up Grand Mesa slopes marbled
with gold stands of aspen. Colors and textures change with the
seasons, but always are treasured by Mesa residents who give
themselves a gift just by looking out the window each morning.
Having been spared, so far, many of the more pernicious effects of
rampant development familiar to the rest of western Colorado, Mesa
remains a town where people wave to strangers they pass on the
street and keep canoes on their front porches. And there's that
view. (Sauer, Cox News Service).

sweep, big picture kind of vision. The former president of the
United States was talking about the failing eyesight of a child.
Carter, 75, was haunted by the image of a cute 2-year-old boy he
had seen last weekend in the poor West African nation of Mali. The
boy suffered from the early stages of a disease called trachoma, an
ailment that has blinded 6 million people and that infects millions
more. The boy's grandmother has already been blinded by the
disease. But the boy, the former president said, still has a chance
of keeping his eyesight. The youngster from Mali, and others like
him, will have more a chance thanks to new programs the Carter
Center is announcing today. (Thursday) (Graham, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution).

   CHINA-PANDAS _ KORLA, China _ Pandemonium! Two of China's
national treasures, a pair of pandas, will be going to Zoo Atlanta
by the end of this month, the dominant state television network
CCTV-1 reported late Wednesday. Whether two-year-old female Lun Lun
and her two-year-old male pal Yang Yang were really about to split
from the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding was still
slightly up in the air despite this unqualified report to millions
of viewers on Chinese government-run television. Late Wednesday
night, Sarah Bexell, Zoo Atlanta's researcher on the ground in
China, said she had no official confirmation that China's ruling
State Council had finally approved the long-delayed export permit.

   JOURNAL-HONDURAS _ MARCOVIA, Honduras - It seems relatively
simple: a nation torn apart by Hurricane Mitch's raging floods
needs to be rebuilt. Donor countries and international charities
step in, providing millions in aid to rebuild infrastructure and
hundreds of volunteers to help provide housing. Slowly, roads are
cleared, washouts filled in, temporary bridges installed and
hundreds of new cement block houses are constructed. But a year
after Mitch's floods, it's clear that rebuilding a poor country
devastated by a natural disaster isn't so easy - at least not if
you want to address the underlying problems that made the disaster
so much worse than it might have been. (Williams/, Cox News

IN TINA'S WAKE, A DEVASTATED NEW YORKER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is a man in New York City named Robert Gottlieb, who works
for the publishing house Alfred A. Knopf. He is in his 60s, about 6
feet tall, not very gray. He works a lot at home, and occasionally
lopes over to Knopf headquarters on East 49th Street, where he
mooches around the office, chatting amiably with acquaintances in
the corridors.
</P>
<P>
   He is not vainglorious and, in keeping with company tradition,
there is no corporate biography or curriculum vitae of Gottlieb
available to outsiders. ``They should be talking about the books,
not about us,'' was how Knopf himself put it. But to an
ever-growing number of magazine readers, Gottlieb will always be
remembered as the last editor of the New Yorker.
</P>
<P>
   The clouds are finally parting around the country's most
prestigious literary magazine. And the vista is not very pretty.
The incalculable damage of the Tina Brown editorship is clearly
visible now. The magazine has been reduced in stature, and her
handpicked successor is floundering, imprisoned by her legacy of
``buzz.''
</P>
<P>
   The Brown game has been laid bare in her new, already failed
magazine Talk. Her goal, as in her early years at the New Yorker,
was to generate talk, or ``buzz'' about the publication. And just
as people talk about a New Yorker cover depicting a Hassidic Jew
kissing a black woman, people buzz about Gwyneth Paltrow in a
leather bikini, or about George W. Bush using the ``f'' word _ a
much-remarked-upon Brown innovation at the New Yorker. But people
talk about the toilet backing up, too. Talk is cheap. The magazine
is putrid, the staff is bolting, and Brown's Miramax backers must
be wondering what they got themselves into.
</P>
<P>
   Second verse, same as the first. It is astonishing to leaf back
through the ``old'' New Yorker under Gottlieb's five-year
editorship (1987-1992), and then remark upon what Tina wrought.
Gottlieb continued the magazine's tradition of serendipity (``A
Reporter at Large: Elephants'') and seriousness, publishing an Alec
Wilkinson series on sugar cane workers, William Finnegan's
multiparter on the drug trade in New Haven, and the astonishing
serial excerpts from Neil Sheehan's ``A Bright Shining Lie'' and
Robert Caro's Lyndon Johnson biography. Put another way: When is
the last time you couldn't wait until the next issue of a magazine
arrived?
</P>
<P>
   Brown took over the magazine in the summer of 1992, and her
first trademark issue appeared on Oct. 5. The cover depicted a
purple-haired punk slouched in a Central Park hansom. The expanded
table of contents launched several new departments, and facing the
contents one found the signature Calvin Klein ad, a photograph of a
man nuzzling a bare-breasted women who is having trouble keeping
her CK jeans around her waist. That sensibility would soon migrate
to the editorial pages, where Brown's shock-the-bourgeois style
would show us O.J. Simpson's undraped girlfriends, and much, much
more.
</P>
<P>
   What changed between Gottlieb and Brown was the social compact
between the magazine and its readers. Under Gottlieb and his
predecessor, Wallace Shawn, the readers trusted the editors'
judgment that a report on, say, the traditional Siennese horse race
(``Annals of Intrigue: The Palio'') would be worth reading. But
Brown had no judgment, no editorial compass. The magazine delegated
the responsibility of choosing its subject matter to Hollywood
flacks and Capitol Hill spinmeisters. Now it's just part of the
hype.
</P>
<P>
   The real question, is where can the magazine go now? Brown has a
superb eye for talent, and many of her hires, including editor
David Remnick, are still at the magazine. Whether through fealty to
his preceptor or lack of oomph, Remnick has yet to steer a new
course. The latest of the Brown-inspired double issues _ not the
unreadable fashion twofer, this is the unreadable ``Next'' twin
issue _ has just landed with a thud in mailboxes across the
country. And you really don't feel like opening it, because you
don't really care.

   CHANNELVIEW, Texas _ Karla Land never knows what the air will
smell like when she steps outside her motorcycle shop here on the
edge of a highway near Houston. Will it be a dirty sock day? A
rotten egg day? Or one of those days when the foulness in the air
simply defies description?
</P>
<P>
   For years, the grim joke has been that the noxious odor coming
from the forest of oil and chemical industry smokestacks in this
blue-collar area must be ``the smell of money.''
</P>
<P>
   But now that the Houston metropolitan area has overtaken Los
Angeles as the nation's smog capital, it is not so funny any more _
particularly to supporters of Governor George W. Bush. Even
admirers warn that Texas's pollution problems could harm his bid
for president just as the filthy water in Boston Harbor hurt
Massachusetts governor Michael Dukakis's campaign in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants to take care of a whole nation and he can't even take
care of Texas,'' scoffed Land, 46, who frequently suffers sinus
infections and coughing spells that she believes are triggered by
pollution.
</P>
<P>
   This week, environmentalists plan to launch the first of what
will probably be a series of attacks on Bush's environmental
record, charging that his industry-friendly policies since taking
office in 1995 helped create an air pollution crisis. The 24 worst
smog readings in the United States this year were in Texas, while
federal regulators threaten and prod the state to take stronger
action.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush supporters, including top environmental officials from
his father's presidential administration, say the mounting attacks
unfairly hold Bush responsible for Texas's enormous environmental
problems, while denying him credit for efforts to solve them. Bush
recently signed a bill to clean up some of the state's dirtiest
power plants, for example.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is the air cleaner since I became governor? The answer is
yes,'' said Bush in an oft-quoted statement that environmentalists
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   The real George W. Bush, friends say, shares the core values of
his father, President Bush, who wanted to be recalled as ``the
environmental president.'' The elder Bush often clashed with
environmentalists, deriding Vice President Al Gore as ``ozone
man,'' but he also signed landmark clean-air legislation as well as
the first treaty to combat global warming.
</P>
<P>
   Though the younger Bush has not made the environment a
significant part of either of his two campaigns for governor,
friends say he, too, wants to leave a legacy of environmental
improvement. A hunter, fisherman, and jogger on the trails of
Austin, Governor Bush shares a zeal for the outdoors with his
parachute-jumping, speed boat-driving father.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will be the next president of the United States, and when I
leave office, the air will be cleaner, the water will be cleaner,
and the environment will be better. Tell me how I'm going to make
it happen,'' Bush reportedly told conservative environmental
leaders at a meeting in Austin last spring.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike his father, George W. Bush has had to prove his
environmental credentials in the rough and tumble world of Texas
politics, where the petrochemical industry is strong, the
environmental movement is weak, and the Legislature is skeptical of
government programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no real environmental movement here, so it is not a
significant part of our policy,'' conceded Andrew Sansom, executive
director of Texas Parks and Wildlife, whose board members are
appointed by Bush. Sansom, however, also served with Bush's
predecessor as governor, Ann Richards, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps as a result of the lack of an environmental movement,
Texas industries release more chemicals into the environment than
any other state or Canadian province, though the total amount of
emissions is declining. Meanwhile, with few checks on development
and less than 3 percent of the state in public hands, cities such
as Houston have become a tangle of highway construction designed to
accommodate the growth.
</P>
<P>
   Against that backdrop, Sansom regards Bush as an environmental
pioneer, working cooperatively with industry to balance
environmental and economic concerns. For instance, Bush recently
announced a deal to protect almost 7,000 acres of important bird
habitat in exchange for allowing Dow Chemical and the state highway
department to fill wetlands elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you have with him is a very unique sort of paradigm shift
toward a more thoughtful and stewardship-oriented approach'' to the
environment than past governors, said Sansom.
</P>
<P>
   But critics say Bush, a former oil executive, mostly rides the
political tides of Texas, seldom taking tough environmental stands
unless the pressure is overwhelming. Bush, for example, reversed
his position in favor of a nuclear waste repository along the
Mexican border only after extensive protests by the Mexican
government.
</P>
<P>
   More commonly, say Texas activists, Bush's policies seem aimed
at pleasing industry and property rights groups. For example, he
opposed federal intervention to protect the rare Barton Springs
salamander, an amphibian that lives in one of the most popular
swimming areas in Austin, on the grounds that it could limit
development. Bush said he was concerned about any action ``that has
even the potential to impact the use of private property.''
</P>
<P>
   And activists say Bush makes little effort to balance the
political playing field with his appointments and choice of
advisers on environmental issues.
</P>
<P>
   Most controversially, he convened numerous private meetings with
industry leaders, whose firms and representatives had given
$260,648 to his 1998 gubernatorial campaign, to discuss ways to
reduce pollution from their older facilities.

BLOATED E-HEROES; HAVEL TALK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you're not already weary of Internet hype, you might well be
after reading the current issue of Civilization.
</P>
<P>
   The usually terrific magazine surrenders more than a dozen pages
this month to cyber-bloviation, including interviews with a bunch
of corporate bigwigs Civilization insists on dubbing ``e-Heroes.''
And certainly they see themselves and their industry in a heroic
light.
</P>
<P>
   Who will gainsay them? No one, it seems. Under our swiftly
congealing conventional wisdom, it's not enough to say that
Internet entrepreneurs have come up with some useful products and
latched onto a dandy get-rich-quick scheme. No, they must be
portrayed as visionaries whose vast networks and brilliant
inventions will not just transform our planet _ Goodbye, world
hunger! Outta here, global warming! _ but may actually change human
nature itself.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most irksome is the self-celebration masquerading as
selflessness, given voice in Civilization by Sun Microsystems CEO
Scott McNealy. He boasts that he tells his employees that because
``they have all the tools and all the capabilities,'' they are
``cursed to go work hard, harder than the rest of mankind.'' (So
count your blessings, all you ditch-diggers and hotel maids toiling
for minimum wage; the stock-optioned propeller-heads of Silicon
Valley are working harder than you.)
</P>
<P>
   ``That is their donation; that is their charity; that is their
calling,'' McNealy goes on. ``And they should just deal with it,
get over it, feel good about it, and enjoy the psychic income of
making a difference.'' Oh, brother. What's the remedy for a psychic
headache?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sorry Dan, Tom, and Peter: None of the anchors of the three main
network newscasts made it onto the list of the 25 most influential
people in the media compiled by Brill's Content.
</P>
<P>
   That in itself speaks volumes about the way the media universe
has changed. It is no longer a straightforward thing to decide Who
Matters in an era when the media marketplace has exploded in a
thousand different directions, and when Oprah Winfrey, as the
magazine notes, has more clout governing best-sellers than the New
York Times Book Review does.
</P>
<P>
   So who made the influence list? Winfrey, of course, but the
magazine also delivers useful, if brief, profiles of a host of
relative unknowns who wield day-to-day decision-making power in new
spheres of influence. They include Dave Sirulnick, the 35-year-old
in charge of MTV's news operation; Lisa Prisco, who oversees the
Gap's catchy ad campaign; John A. Walsh, the snowy-bearded
innovator who has made ESPN's ``SportsCenter'' more than a
scores-and-highlights compendium; and Adrian Lurssen, the head of
the ``surfing department'' at Yahoo! Inc.
</P>
<P>
   A cursory nod to the more established media is given _ with Tim
Russert of NBC's ``Meet the Press'' andNew York Times executive
editor Joseph Lelyveld among the 25 _ but the edge goes to
new-media types. (Ironically, or tellingly, one of the ``old
media'' leaders who did make the list, Wall Street Journal managing
editor Paul E. Steiger, is reportedly weighing an offer to become
president of CNNfn, a financial-news cable network).
</P>
<P>
   Underscoring the shifting balance of power, network heavyweights
such as ``60 Minutes'' honcho Don Hewitt, ``Today'' host Katie
Couric, and ``20/20'' host Barbara Walters _ along with Rather,
Brokaw and Jennings _ didn't make the cut.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's not every head of state whose metaphysical ruminations
you'd care to hear, but then not every head of state is Vaclav
Havel. He holds forth to George Stephanopoulos in this month's Talk
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   A dissident playwright when Czechoslovakia was one of the
captive nations in the Soviet bloc, Havel's name became familiar to
the West. Now, as the president of the Czech Republic, Havel is
grappling with both the fruits of democracy _ a ``cultural,
spiritual, social life (that) is immeasurably richer than it ever
was before'' _ and some of what he sees as drawbacks. Namely, a
newly unleashed media that raised questions about whether Havel and
the TV actress he married after his first wife died had been having
an affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does bother me a little bit that of all the things
(imported) from the West, we have to go and choose one of the
worst,'' he sighs.
</P>
<P>
   But Havel speaks also of higher things, such as the question of
how God can allow suffering like that in Kosovo. He draws from his
own experience in prison, citing the time he had to make an
excruciating decision involving the freedom of his wife and
brother. ``When I decided, the decision was probably made in
relationship with that `eye' who never speaks,'' he says. ``It
speaks only very indirectly to us, the owner of that `eye'; it
speaks through our conscience. . . . He won't get rid of (Slobodan)
Milosevic for us. We have to get rid of him ourselves, but we have
to understand that we have to do it.''

`KITCHEN WARS': THE REDUCTION OF A MARRIAGE

   MY KITCHEN WARS: A MEMOIR &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By Betty Fussell &QL;
</P>
<P>
   North Point Press, $23
</P>
<P>
   Betty Harper was a smart, fun-loving Pomona College coed with a
soft pastel angora sweater and a Phi Beta Kappa key. The Second
World War was almost over. When the vets began returning home, she,
like the other girls, went looking for handsome GIs. They necked
and petted freely until each settled down with someone.
</P>
<P>
   Betty, raised by fundamentalists in a household where swearing
and drink were prohibited, found Paul Fussell. ``I fell in love the
way girls did in movies,'' she writes in ``My Kitchen Wars,''
``from the way he looked, tall and lean with jutty brows, slanted
pixie eyes and tilted smile, his shoulders slightly hunched in a
gray-blue crewneck sweater over a button-down shirt, white buck
shoes beneath gray flannels.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul hung out with an interesting literary crowd, he was headed
for Harvard for a doctorate, his father was an important corporate
lawyer, and he had a sharp wit.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps too sharp _ but that came later. The young, eager Betty,
who went on to become an important food writer and author (``The
Story of Corn,'' ``I Hear America Cooking''), saw Paul as her guide
to a higher, more cultured life she wouldn't have found otherwise.
Her mother had died tragically when she was young (``unresolved,''
wrote the insurance company after she was found dead beside an open
tin of rat poison), she had a horrid stepmother, and this guy
looked swell.
</P>
<P>
   Their life became a big academic party that went on for years
and years, first at Harvard (she went to Radcliffe for a master's
degree), then at Connecticut College for Women, and finally at
Rutgers University, in New Jersey, where they hung out mostly with
a heady group of intellectuals from Princeton. Their world was
male-dominated, and the women were there to see the men through to
their tenure posts and publications.
</P>
<P>
   Betty Fussell wanted to be taken seriously. ``I discovered that
all I had to do was ask intelligent questions,'' she writes, ``and
men of all ages would find me intelligent.''
</P>
<P>
   This food-driven memoir begins in a run-down apartment with clam
dip and Ritz crackers, Betty spilling sherry down the front of a
pretty but cheap blue satin cocktail dress. It weaves through many
elaborate dinners, where the high-minded partygoers drank a lot. By
the '60s, when they fell on Julia Child's first ``Mastering the Art
of French Cooking'' volume, they began outdoing one another in the
kitchen and trading spouses after dinner. They didn't even go off
into the bedrooms, but preferred their own living rooms. Most, says
Fussell, did nothing more than neck.
</P>
<P>
   Then the cool, self-controlled Betty took the plunge and began
an affair. She and Dave shared picnics of rich chicken liver pate
with ``buckets of heavy cream,'' good Bordeaux wines,
buttermilk-battered deep-fried chicken with avocado and pear salad
in a lime vinaigrette.
</P>
<P>
   Dave, like Paul, had a wit that often translated into withering
remarks. Paul was much too interested in himself and his own work
to take a real interest in Betty, she writes. He was becoming known
in his field. When they were having adventures abroad or people
were coming for one of Betty's famous parties, it was still fun _
too much fun to decide that the marriage really wasn't working.
</P>
<P>
   Betty wonders if the downturn didn't begin when Paul wrote ``The
Great War and Modern Memory,'' which won him acclaim. Or whether it
was when she decided to return to graduate school for a doctorate
when their children were grown. She wanted him to thank for all her
years of devotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul reaped the merit badges for his prize-winning book, and I
faded like an old Polaroid. I grew resentful, but not, as Paul
assumed, because I was jealous of his fame. I wanted something
simpler and subtler, some sign of recognition from him that his
achievement, which was real and admirable, was the result of labor
shared.'' But she acted jealous and seemed angry all the time.
</P>
<P>
   She became curious when Paul seemed too devoted to some of his
young male students. He would parade nude around a houseful of
friends. One day, she found him after a party in the study with a
male student, both naked, locked in an embrace. Later, when she was
no longer stung, they revealed their transgressions to each other.
</P>
<P>
   They lived a fascinating life, and between the food, the
parties, and travels, she has lots of stories to tell. But
Fussell's writing lacks real emotion. We never know the terrible
pain she must have suffered later on learning that she as a
2-year-old crawled around the kitchen floor beside her dead mother
while her 6-year-old brother ran for help. Or the sadness of a
stillbirth. Or the deep humiliation that her husband took no
pleasure in her. ``This would never have happened if I hadn't been
so lonely,'' he told her after she found him in the study. ``But
you admitted you're incapable of loving anyone but yourself,'' she
reminded him.
</P>
<P>
   Betty Fussell fought her war like a brave, detached soldier. Now
all the withering remarks are aimed at Paul.

   JAPAN-ANIMATION (Hollywood) _ Admirers of Japanese animation,
including many of the pivotal figures in the American animation
community, get a certain catch in their voices when they mention
the name Hayao Miyazaki, as though describing someone not quite
human, like one of the ghostly forest spirits who populate his
work. Barry Cook and Tony Bancroft, co-directors of the Disney
animated feature ``Mulan,'' said simply in a recent tribute:
``Miyazaki is like a god to us.'' Now the great man himself is here
for the American release of ``Princess Mononoke,'' his latest work.

 BOSTON: ... simple, simple, simple.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a young lawyer, Lee tried 29 cases with St. Clair, who became
his mentor and guide through the snakepit politics of big-firm
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing I will always remember about him is that if
something bad happened on a case, he said it was his fault. If
something good happened, he gave the credit to those of us working
for him. I think that may have been the most important thing he
taught me. It made you want to do anything at all for him and it
made you want to take risks.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee began trying cases on his own, amassing an impressive record
that put him on a fast track at Hale and Dorr, a notoriously
cutthroat firm. In the courtroom, he is even-keeled, quick-witted,
and meticulously prepared, his colleagues say. He preferred
simplicity and elegance to grandstanding, they say.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, after 11 years with the firm, Lee had earned enough of
a reputation to catch the attention of Lawrence Walsh, the special
prosecutor investigating the Reagan administration's role in the
Iran-Contra arms scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Hired to trace the flow of money and weapons to Nicaraguan
rebels, Lee took a leave from Hale and Dorr to spend time in
Washington and Central America, often in clandestine meetings to
determine how much contact the Contra leaders had with Reagan
administration officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was all very cloak-and-dagger,'' Lee says. ``We would get
an anonymous phone call, and someone would say, `Go to the Budget
rental car, go around back and look for a yellow car and a guy with
a green shirt.' And there we'd be, interviewing these people who
hated us and were ostensibly dangerous people. It was great.''
</P>
<P>
   He left the investigation abruptly in 1989, after getting a call
from Hale and Dorr asking him to return to take on a highly
publicized patent dispute between two biotech heavyweights,
Genetics Institute and Amgen.
</P>
<P>
   Amgen had sued Genetics Institute over the Cambridge company's
plans to market a genetically-engineered drug to treat anemia, a
drug that Amgen claimed it already owned the exclusive rights to.
Lee buried himself in the case, and as he was preparing to go to
trial, a New York Times editorial said Lee was sure to lose.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we won, and we shocked everybody,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The case was overturned by the US Court of Appeals in
Washington, but Lee's underdog victory at trial resulted in an
explosion of so-called intellectual-property litigation at Hale and
Dorr, Lee says. Intellectual-property litigation _ the vast and
growing practice of settling disputes over the ownership of ideas,
be they software, drugs, or technological developments _ is now
among the hottest legal trends. Of the country's 10 largest
biotechnology cases, Lee has handled six. Huge clients such as
Intel and General Electric came to the firm in part because of
Lee's reputation, and it helped catapult him to prominence within
the firm.
</P>
<P>
   Through all of that, Lee says he rarely experienced overt
racism. But the shadows of some lurking bias occasionally crossed
his path _ things he says he tried to turn to his advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't imagine how many times people have assumed I'm a
scientist,'' he says of the stereotype of Asians belonging in
mathematical and technical fields. That presumption, he said, is
not always a bad thing when one is in court with a highly technical
case.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, he recalls going to trial in Dallas in a lawsuit
over the ownership of video conferencing technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here was this Massachusetts company trucking a Chinese lawyer
down to Texas,'' he says. ``You had to wonder what they would think
of me. But we put on a simple, elegant trial in two days. We got
experts on and off the stand quickly after they made their points
succinctly. There is a lot of merit in putting on a good case.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee said that in a profession that often consumes the lives of
those who practice it, he tries most nights to leave the office
around 7 p.m. to spend time with his family. Even when he was
working on the Iran-Contra investigation, he says he made sure he
was home to coach his daughter's soccer team.
</P>
<P>
   He still plays on a team himself in a weekend league where,
according to a teammate, he plays like he lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's aggressive, fair, and extremely devoted,'' says the
teammate, Michael Eby of the Boston firm Gilman, McLaughlin &AMP;
Hanrahan. ``We've been friends and neighbors for years. I think you
could safely say he applies those things to all aspects of his
life.''
</P>
<P>
   And despite criticism from some circles in the Asian community
that he doesn't speak out enough on behalf of racial causes, others
say Lee is doing all he ought to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``The law is a very Darwinian profession, and for a racial
minority, it can be a very lonely place to be,'' said Rebecca Lee,
president of the Asian American Lawyer's Association of
Massachusetts and a partner at Goodwin, Proctor &AMP; Hoar.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was one of the first in this town, and he's been a beacon
for a lot of others. Every time we've needed his support, he's been
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he will spend most of his time on administrative tasks
after his promotion takes effect Feb. 1, Lee plans to try at least
three cases a year to keep his hand in litigation.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Lee said he hopes his work and a balanced life will
be his legacy to Asian Americans. ``What I want to be, what I hope
I am, is an example,'' he says. ``My family is most important to
me. I want to raise children who are good people. I think of my
wife and my three children. Of all the things I've done in 25
years, that's what I'm most proud of.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Next month, Drs. Robert Adelman and Elizabeth
Quattrocki Knight will start an Internet company without maxing out
their credit cards or begging their families and friends for money.
</P>
<P>
   The two physicians will not have to go looking for office space
or arrange for phones, computers, and office furniture. They won't
need to find lawyers, accountants, or a technical team to develop
their Web site, or job search firms to fill out their management
team.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they will focus exclusively on their business concept,
knowing that they have $250,000 to $1 million available to them,
with venture capitalists nearby to finance their growth stage and
provide connections to potential business partners.
</P>
<P>
   They won't be alone. Working next to them will be another set of
Internet entrepreneurs using some of the same resources. Why?
Adelman and Knight recently moved into The Cambridge Incubator in
Kendall Square.
</P>
<P>
   This community concept of hatching Internet companies in a
single space is part of a trend in business incubators that began
with idealab of Pasadena, Calif., which has helped launch two-dozen
on-line companies in barely two years. Now that trend, having moved
through Santa Monica and Silicon Valley and into Atlanta and New
York, is catching on in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   The Cambridge Incubator is one of five existing or proposed
incubators in the Bay State. Each promises to provide office space,
$250,000 to $1 million or more in seed financing, shared businesss
services _ from receptionist to chief financial officer and legal
counsel _ and computers, software, networking gear, and access to
venture capitalists for future financing and advice. Entrepreneurs
will be able to share ideas as they develop their companies.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for money and nurturing, the incubator owners
receive up to 30 percent ownership stake in each start-up, which
could be worth 10 to 30 times their investment if businesses grow
quickly and are acquired or go public.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not want to spend a lot of time looking for office
space, setting up phone systems, interviewing venture capitalists,
buying computer equipment,'' said Adelman, who with Knight is
developing a Web site for patients with life-threatening diseases
that would offer the latest information about treatments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're buying time,'' added Knight, who will keep her staff
position as a psychiatrist at McLean Hospital in Belmont, Mass.,
where she is doing research on schizophrenia. ``We are probably
saving about six months by using the incubator.''
</P>
<P>
   Timothy Rowe, a former e-commerce consultant at Boston
Consulting Group, began the incubator, which now has three infant
companies, in June. In February it will expand into an
18,000-square-foot facility on the 14th floor of 1 Broadway, where
it will be able to hold as many as 20 start-ups plus a 100-seat
auditorium.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, getting the best and brightest ideas and turning them
into young companies that we can nurture and grow quickly to gain a
competitive edge is what we are about,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rowe, whose father, Richard, recently began RoweCom, a Cambridge
e-commerce firm, is working with PricewaterhouseCoopers and Testa
Hurwitz &AMP; Thibeault for financial and legal expertise. Timothy
Rowe's wife, Amy, is developing a Web-based service for frequent
business travelers.
</P>
<P>
   Incubator space developers say a start-up will go through nearly
$1 million over three to six months with a staff of two to five
people. Some may grow more quickly, leaving the incubator and
becoming self-sufficient with their own facilities within four
months, and in another four to eight months will have a staff of 20
and raise nearly $30 million in venture capital before being
acquired or going public.
</P>
<P>
   That's a far cry from the late 1970s and early '80s, when local
business development agencies and nonprofit corporations set up
incubators in old factories to showcase economic development. Often
the do-good spirit did not lead to self-sustaining companies.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, the first biotechnology incubator opened in
Worcester, Mass., with venture capital backing. Several companies
have emerged from it, and a biotech incubator opened recently in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The new Internet incubators aim to take advantage of Wall
Street's love affair with dot-com businesses, which seem to raise
money one day and go public within eight months.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone welcomes the growing numbers of Internet
incubators. Critics say the abundance of venture capital will spawn
scores of new companies in the coming years that are not likely to
survive because their ideas were poorly conceived, they were slow
to get started, or they missed the market window or failed to
differentiate themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of young guys with ideas are essentially looking for
adult supervision and some facilities to work out of,'' said Todd
A. Dagres, general partner at Battery Ventures in Wellesley, Mass..
``Some of them think they can outdo eBay and the auction companies
or run the next eToys, so the bar is very low to get funded. That
means weaker companies that survive in incubators may crash and
burn when they go out on their own and struggle against established
players. So I think we're going to see the `amateur hour' of
Internet start-ups next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, are betting on Internet incubators to spawn the
next big successes. ``The next generation of Internet companies
will need more advanced technology, and that's the space we want to
play in,'' said Howard Anderson, who is leaving active management
of the Yankee Group, the technology market research firm he formed
30 years ago, to create Yankee Tek, a 5,000-square-foot incubator
to open next month at 1 Memorial Drive in Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike The Cambridge Incubator, Yankee Tek plans to focus on
companies developing Internet infrastructure rather than dot-com
electronic commerce businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within a 2-square-mile radius of MIT are some of the nation's
first-rate minds, many of whom we in New England have lost to
California, but who now might stay and work in an incubator to
launch the next great company,'' said Anderson, whose eldest son
works for an Internet start-up on the West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, who recently began teaching a course on Internet
entrepreneurship at the Sloan School of the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology, plans to house no more than three companies in
Yankee Tek, plus investments in three other companies.
</P>
<P>
   While he admits he earns more money from Silicon Valley
start-ups than in New England deals, he said he expects to invest
as much as $3 million per company for start-ups developing the next
generation of Internet infrastructure software. However, most deals
will be in the $500,000 to $1.5 million range.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said he has lined up about $40 million in financing
from Battery Ventures, which he cofounded, and from several other
venture capital sources including Thomas H. Lee Internet Partners,
a Boston-based innvestment firm where he is an adviser.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the chief evangelist, the guy with the fat Rolodex,'' he
said, noting Yankee Tek's goal is to cultivate ties with
professors, campus research labs, and recent graduates. ``When an
entrepreneur needs an introduction to, say, someone at General
Electric or they need a vice president of sales and we know of four
sales guys who are looking for their next hot company, we can
arrange a meeting.''
</P>

   Several other executives of incubator companies say they, too,
can reach out to bring in needed talent, find corporate partners,
and arrange venture capital financing. Pasadena-based idealab,
which launched eToys and GoTo.com Inc., an Internet search engine,
could have a Boston version next year, said Bruce Johnston, who
last month left venture capital firm TA Associates to spearhead
idealab East's development.

<P>
   Next month, Softbank Venture Capital, which has a combination of
Japanese and American funds, plans to open an Internet incubator
space in a former mansion in Boston's Back Bay. It will be called
HotBank, a brand name Softbank will use as part of an affiliated
network of Internet incubators in California, New York, and three
other areas _ six facilities all slated to open by the end of this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Said Charles R. Lax, managing director of Softbank Technology
Ventures' East Coast operations in Newton, Mass., and an adviser to
the Boston HotBank incubator: ``For me, I'm seeing 80 deals a week
come into my office, and with this incubator some of them will get
a home.''

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ William Lee embarked on his law career in 1976 planning
to employ a trial tactic used by his Cornell law professor and role
model, famed litigator Irving Young. Wear a bow tie, the professor
had told his student; it makes you stand out in the minds of jurors
and tricks them into remembering what you say.
</P>
<P>
   But Lee, who took a job at the prestigious law firm of Hale and
Dorr in Boston to further his dream of becoming an acclaimed trial
lawyer, scrapped the bow-tie idea after a few weeks on the job. An
Asian-American in Boston's then white-dominated Yankee legal
community, ``it took me about two trials to figure out I didn't
need a bow tie or anything else,'' he says now from his 32d-floor
office at Hale and Dorr's downtown headquarters. ``Being Chinese, I
was enough of an oddity.''
</P>
<P>
   In that way, he says, his race may have curiously helped him
become one of the nation's most successful intellectual property
litigators _ if only by setting him apart from the pack. But 23
years later, Lee nonetheless remains a rarity in the legal
profession. Named earlier this month as his firm's new managing
partner, he is the first Asian-American in Boston to achieve that
status and one of only a handful of Asian managing partners across
the country.
</P>
<P>
   Minority groups have hailed him as a groundbreaker and said he
has helped inspire a new generation of young Asian-Americans who
long avoided careers in law, preferring technical fields and
viewing the bar as a foreign domain that held little promise for
them. Considered a pioneer in the still-young but exploding field
of intellectual property, his technical prowess in intensely
complex patent disputes has won him national acclaim. The National
Law Journal three years ago said his winning record made him one of
the country's 10 best litigators. He is highly regarded by his
peers, including those who play with him on a weekend soccer
league. (He is an admirable halfback, they say.) ``He's a very
smart, careful, shrewd litigator,'' says Regina Pisa, managing
partner of Goodwin Proctor &AMP; Hoar in Boston who served with him on
a governor's panel to review applicants for the state Supreme
Judicial Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's at the top of his game, and he represents a certain
vitality that's valuable and hard to find.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet Lee, 49, also has been criticized by some in Boston's
Asian community _ though no one would speak out on the record _ for
not using his success to more aggressively confront racial issues
in the practice of law. Lee himself confesses that, while race has
in some ways defined his career, he has preferred to sink himself
into other roles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do want to give back to the community, and I make an effort
to do that,'' he says, admitting that from his office with its
panoramic view of Boston Harbor, it's easy to become isolated from
issues outside the firm. ``I am intensely proud of being Chinese.
And for people who are Asian, this (promotion to managing partner)
is a significant event. But for me, it has always been about the
work.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Lee says that success has come to him through personal
effort, a value he says came from his immigrant father, who left
China for the United States in 1948. His father, an engineer, put
himself through school, earning master's and doctorate degrees. He
went to work for General Electric and eventually became a professor
at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   While his two brothers followed their father into technical
careers, Lee took a path not often followed by Asians, especially
at the time. ``Asians didn't tend to go into the law,'' he says.
``The language barrier makes it difficult, and there are cultural
barriers.''
</P>
<P>
   But for Lee, it was alluring, partly because he was drawn to the
action of the courtroom and partly because among his brothers, ``I
was the least likely to win a Nobel Prize.''
</P>
<P>
   After graduating magna cum laude from Harvard, Lee went to
Cornell, where in addition to his law degree, he got a master's in
business administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may be the least intelligent of my brothers, but I have the
most business sense,'' he says. ``They all come to me for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee joined Hale and Dorr's litigation department after
graduating in 1976 to learn at the feet of legends like James St.
Clair, who helped bring down Wisconsin Senator Joseph McCarthy and
later represented President Richard M. Nixon during the Watergate
investigation. Another was Jerome Facher, a crusty trial lawyer
known for his slavish devotion to the law and excoriations of
opponents. Facher is now best known for his successful defense of
corporate giant Beatrice Foods in the 1986 industrial dumping
lawsuit detailed in the book ``A Civil Action.'' The suit, which
culminated in a grueling five-month trial in Boston, alleged
children in Woburn had contracted leukemia after toxic waste had
leaked into drinking water.
</P>
<P>
   ``Facher is a brilliant, gifted thinker,'' Lee says. ``He knew
how to distill a case to its essentials. He'd give you a
three-by-five index card and say, `Write your case on this. If you
need more room than that, you don't understand it.' That's what I
always say now. Keep it simple, simple, simple.''

CHILDREN GRADE THEIR WORKING PARENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Children whose parents spend at least six hours a day with them
on work days give their mothers and fathers top grades for making
them feel loved and important.
</P>
<P>
   That's just one conclusion of researcher Ellen Galinsky's
interviews with 1,023 US children about their parents' work lives.
Two issues loomed large in the study: whether parents were giving
their children ``focused'' time, and whether dad was gainfully
employed.
</P>
<P>
   Galinsky's findings, compiled in the book ``Ask the Children:
What America's Children Really Think About Working Parents''
(William Morrow and Co., 1999), have struck a nerve. Newsweek
serialized the book. The Washington Post last month put the
findings on the front page. And anxious readers are calling talk
shows to discuss the results and communicating with Galinsky on the
Web.
</P>
<P>
   After randomly interviewing with children in grades 3 to 12, as
well as telephone interviews with 170 parents in 15 states,
Galinsky found that both the amount of time and the quality of the
interaction were important to children. Not surprising, older
children were more likely to focus on how time was spent. Were
parents listening to them? Did parents understand their
adolescents' day-to-day lives? Were parents too overwhelmed, too
stressed by work and financial matters to spend a few hours a day
tuning in?
</P>
<P>
   ``We found that the quantity of time with mothers and fathers
does matter a great deal,'' said Galinsky. ``Children who spend
more time with their parents on workdays and nonworkdays grade
their parents higher. They feel their parents are more successful
in managing work and family, and they also feel that their parents
are putting them first.''
</P>
<P>
   The statistics were striking. Eighty-three percent of children
whose parents spent a minimum of six hours per day with them on
working days gave their mothers top grades for making them feel
loved and important. Additionally, 84 percent of the children gave
fathers high marks for spending a minimum of six hours per day with
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm upset, (my parents) talk to me,'' the book quotes a
9-year-old saying. ``They want to know why I am upset, which is
comforting because I can't talk to myself. They help me deal with
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Who spends more time with their children? According to Galinsky,
mothers spend more time with children from birth to age 18 than
fathers. She found that more than twice as many mothers (33
percent) spent 4.5 hours or more on workdays with their children
than fathers (15 percent).
</P>
<P>
   A family's annual income makes a difference, too. Parents whose
household incomes were $25,000 or less spent more time with their
children than parents whose household incomes were $75,000 or more.
Parents with lower household income may work less or be employed in
jobs with more regular or part-time hours.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, working-class parents were more likely to rely on each
other or relatives to care for their children than were middle and
upper middle-class parents.
</P>
<P>
   Galinsky's book, described by one critic as a ``guilt buster,''
contains a surprise: Most kids don't care whether mothers work or
not, though younger children were more likely to say they liked
having their mothers home. Still, few children regarded working and
stay-at-home moms differently. Rather, they were more concerned
about the working status of their fathers, possibly because of the
emphasis society places on the male's role as economic provider.
</P>
<P>
   The study, one of the first to assess the views of children and
parents, also revealed that children are detecting signs of stress
and work-related fatigue among working adults a lot more  &UR; today &LR; 
and are concerned about what they see.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't work too hard,'' one child wrote in the study. ``Know
when to quit because, if you don't, you'll get all stressed out and
take it out on us!''
</P>
<P>
   With work hours increasing, it is hardly surprising Galinsky
found that guilt is still prevalent among parents, especially among
working mothers.
</P>
<P>
   My daughter was seven months old when I returned to work
following maternity leave 14 years ago. Though eager to re-enter
the tug and pull of the newsroom, I felt guilty for wanting to
return at all.
</P>
<P>
   My feelings were eased by my daycare provider, who was
recommended by my daughter's pediatrician. Lillian O'Keefe had four
children ages 9 to 16 when she began caring for my child. Then 38,
she not only loved children, she thrived on the activity and
constant give-and-take that made her household a real source of
inspiration for me. In doting on my child as much she doted on her
own, Lillian gave me the freedom to work.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, when at 13 months my daughter called her caregiver Mommy, I
cringed. Had my child confused this wonderful woman with her real
mother? Was I spending too little time with my infant and too much
time at work? Were deadlines and bylines more important to me than
mothering?
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen years have passed since those questions kept me up at
night, and the report from the homefront is more positive than I
ever dreamed. These days, my child is healthy and happy, though
there are times when she feels her mother's job should be on the
periphery of our lives.
</P>
<P>
   Like most parents of adolescents, the amount of time I spend
with my daughter has lessened because of her social activities,
homework demands, and the well-documented teenage insistence on
autonomy. As one parent told Galinsky: ``I would like to be with my
teenage daughter more, but she is so involved with schoolwork,
activities, and her friends. Inevitably, I will hang around the
house weekend after weekend, and the one day that I make plans, she
will come up to me and say, `Let's do something together today.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But even with teens there are ways to carve out time. The sheer
regularity of certain activities such as eating meals together,
watching television together, taking walks, or simply discussing
homework appears to inextricably be linked to the way younger and
older children view their parents and how they develop as a result,
reports Galinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The kids in ``Ask the Children'' seem to agree. When Galinsky
asked children what they would like to tell the working parents of
America, many wanted their parents to know they were proud of them.
``If you are trying as a parent,'' said one child, ``if you are
leading by example, if you are following what you preach, then your
kids will turn out pretty good.''

 &HT;    For a better taste, try concentrating
 &HT;    By Betty Parham
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most cooks have puzzled over the ingredients of a particularly
delicious restaurant dish and tried emulating it in their own
kitchen. Sometimes the results are satisfactory, but more often
they fall short. It's frustrating to a home cook when a particular
quality, flavor or texture of a restaurant dish simply can't be
duplicated, no matter how hard you try.
</P>
<P>
   Often, the reason is a truly secret ingredient that's used by
professional chefs but is not readily available to the rest of us.
That secret: concentrates and bases.
</P>
<P>
   The next time you're at a restaurant and marvel over a savory
bisque, a glorious gravy, a satiny sauce or a gorgeous glaze,
there's a good chance the chef used a prepared base or concentrate
for those spectacular results. Of course, the chef might spend
hours and sometimes days reducing the meat, fish, poultry or
vegetables, but why should he when there's at least one company
that will do it for him?
</P>
<P>
   Minor's, the original and leading manufacturer of concentrates
and bases for professional cooks, does not produce the sodium- and
additive-packed bouillon or powdery flavor enhancers that are
common on supermarket shelves. Theirs are fresh food products that
contain meat, poultry, seafood or vegetables, reduced to a paste
that must be refrigerated. The products are 100 percent natural,
with no artificial ingredients, chemical preservatives or coloring,
and they contain less than 1 gram of fat per serving.
</P>
<P>
   When food scientist Lewis J. Minor founded his concentrate
company in the 1950s, he started with chicken and beef bases. But
as methods have improved and restaurant demand has increased, the
product line has multiplied. Now there are also concentrates of
pork, turkey and ham, and seafood bases including clam, crab, fish,
lobster, seafood and shrimp. Vegetable bases include garlic,
sauteed garlic, roasted onion, mushroom, sauteed vegetables,
roasted red pepper and herbes de Provence. The uses of bases and
concentrates expand every day. Along with sauces, gravies, dips,
soups and stews, they can be used to enhance just about any dish
you can think of.
</P>
<P>
   So why can't you buy them in a grocery store?
</P>
<P>
   Concentrates aren't usually found there because you don't just
pick one up and use it to see what happens. The average person who
is unfamiliar with concentrates and doesn't have specific recipes
for their use wouldn't know what to do with a small $10 jar that
contains the essence of half a bushel of lobsters or clams. In
other words, you have to know at least a little about how
concentrates work.
</P>
<P>
   That's where David Sievers comes in. A few years ago, Sievers,
an enthusiastic amateur chef, was installing security systems for a
living when a friend introduced him to cooking with concentrates.
Finding out that such a small amount of an ingredient could provide
such an explosion of taste spurred his culinary creativity, and
he's been on a journey of discovery ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Now he's the exclusive national home-cook distributor of Minor's
concentrates. Sievers and his wife, Heidi, run a sort of
concentrate correspondence school on the Internet. They have about
7,000 devotees, who have found out about concentrates by word of
mouth, from a professional chef or online. They regularly visit the
Web site (www.allserv.com/) to find out about new products, updated
recipes and new uses. The couple also have a toll-free number
(1-800-827-8328) and are available seven days a week to answer
questions and offer suggestions. With every purchase of a
concentrate, they include booklets and loads of recipes.

MARKET'S NEW WORRY: LAWSUITS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Investors already have plenty to worry about: inflation, rising
interest rates, a weak dollar, Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a new aggravation to add to the list: a wave of major
lawsuits. The suits, modeled after the tobacco litigation, have
just been filed against health maintenance organizations and the
makers of lead paint. In both cases stocks in the affected
industries tumbled sharply after the news broke.
</P>
<P>
   Maureen Allyn is not the only person on Wall Street who thinks
there may be more to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a threat that could be extended to a lot of different
industries,'' says Allyn, chief economist at Scudder Kemper
Investments. ``As shareholders we ought to be taking this issue
seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   The suits can be thought of as spinoffs of the tobacco lawsuits.
When those suits were settled, the tobacco companies agreed to pay
$246 billion over a period of years. Most of the money went to the
states, but a chunk of it went into the pockets of a small group of
law firms.
</P>
<P>
   Emboldened and enriched by their success, the lawyers have gone
out in search of new dragons to slay.
</P>
<P>
   ``These lawsuits are a growth industry,''
</P>
<P>
   says Dan Troy, a lawyer affiliated with the American Enterprise
Institute in Washington, a conservative think tank. ``These firms
are investing and developing new causes of action. It is a rational
business model.''
</P>
<P>
   The HMOs may have a different opinion. Two of the nation's
largest publicly traded HMOs, Humana and Aetna, were hit with
class-action lawsuits earlier this month. As a group, HMOs are only
slightly more popular than tobacco companies. Doctors and patients
have complained _ often on the basis of anecdotal evidence _ that
HMOs give priority to profits rather than patient care; Congress is
contemplating giving patients the right to sue HMOs for bad care.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuits don't deal directly with medical questions. Instead
they accuse the HMOs of failing to disclose financial incentives
aimed at reducing cost. The HMO industry says the suits have no
merit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trial lawyers go for deep pockets,'' groused Richard Huber,
Aetna's chief executive, after his company was targeted. Many
analysts think the lawyers will have trouble making the suits
stick.
</P>
<P>
   Still, no one can say for sure what will happen, and on Wall
Street, uncertainty is trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until we get some clarity, I think the attitude of some
investors will be, `I don't need to own these stocks,' '' says
Linda Miller, manager of John Hancock's Global Health Sciences
Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Rhode Island last week went after another potential deep pocket
_ the former makers of lead paint. In a suit filed against a group
of companies, the state is seeking to recover the cost of providing
health care to victims of lead poisoning. The suit also demands
that the corporations pay to strip lead paint from private and
public buildings in Rhode Island, a big job, even in a little
state.
</P>
<P>
   The lead-paint suit is being financed by a South Carolina law
firm, Ness Motley, that was active in the tobacco litigation. If
Rhode Island prevails, the law firm will get a portion of the
winnings. The day after the suit was announced, the stock price of
one paint maker, NL Industries, lost 15 percent of its value.
</P>
<P>
   Business executives aren't the only ones alarmed by the latest
wave of lawsuits. Judyth Pendell, director of the Center for Legal
Policy at the Manhattan Institute, another conservative think tank,
argues that the suits represent an attack on the separation of
powers laid out in the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are transferring to the courts matters that should be
decided by regulators or people in legislatures,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   On the political front, the issue could turn out to be a major
point of contention between the presidential candidates. Democrats
tend to be sympathetic to trial lawyers; Republicans generally are
in favor of tort reform that would limit the impact of suits.
</P>
<P>
   For investors, the problem is more practical: How can you be
sure that one of the stocks in your portfolio won't be the target
of a lawsuit?
</P>
<P>
   Dan Troy, no friend of trial lawyers, suggests investors could
be in for a rough time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The list of potential suits is almost endless,'' he warns.
``Guns, foods, alcohol _ almost any business that entails risk on
the part of the consumer. This is a very dangerous development for
American business. It means their fate could depend on the whims of
an individual jury.''

 &HT;    Dinner evokes spirit of Italian countryside
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whether it's a quick weeknight dinner or a special celebration,
there are three descriptions that often roll off the tongues of
rural Italians to describe their food _ nostrano, campanilismo and
si sposa.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Italian Country Table'' (Scribner, $35), author Lynn
Rossetto Kasper explains nostrano literally translates as
``local,'' but it's a term that's more about an embrace than
geography.
</P>
<P>
   Campanilismo is similar, meaning within the sound of the local
bell tower. Both convey the food is as much a part of an Italian's
personal identity as family name and individual personality.
</P>
<P>
   Si sposa means ``it marries'' and is always used in talking
about food. Essentially, it's used to explain why someone in Milan,
where risotto is practically religion, would never sprinkle
Sicilian sheep cheese over a plate of Risotto alla Milanese. The
flavors simply don't marry; they are from different regions,
climates and mentalities.
</P>
<P>
   Kasper captures these expressions and their meanings in the 200
recipes and dozens of stories she gathered in five years of
research in the Italian countryside.
</P>
<P>
   The key to country Italian cooking, Kasper said, is keeping a
few key ingredients in the pantry, like olive oil, tomatoes,
vinegars and pastas. And remember to keep thinking locally and
seasonally. Use the fresh herbs at hand; find the best domestic
cheeses you can. ``I had to give domestic options for many of the
recipes,'' explains Kasper. ``But I came up with recommendations
that won't violate the spirit of the dishes.''
</P>
<P>
   She gives suggestions on how to find the dried pastas, canned
tomatoes and balsamic vinegar, from the mainstream supermarket to a
list of mail order sources that she includes in the back of the
book.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond ingredients, Kasper offers instructions on techniques.
She gives primers on building flavors in a tomato sauce (depending
on the ingredients and time you have). There also are clear
instructions for glazing chicken, storing dried beans and selecting
olive oils.
</P>
<P>
   But best yet, she gives the stories behind many of the recipes
and food ways of rural Italians. So many in fact that an audiobook
companion will be available this month. The tape is of Kasper
relating the stories she heard and her adventures in researching
the book.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you can listen to it while you are preparing this rustic
fall dinner for your family or a few close friends. Go casual. Get
a head start by roasting the tomatoes and making the soup the day
before. Invite guests into the kitchen for the bruschetta, so they
can savor the aromas of the pancetta-stuffed chicken roasting in
the oven. Pour round, robust red wines and soon a rosy glow will be
upon the cheeks of those around the table. And divine smiles as
guests savor the pear pizza. It is fall.

   Oven-Roasted Canned Tomatoes (Pelati al Forno)

</P>
<P>
   Standing time: 6 hours
</P>
<P>
   Lynn Rossetto Kasper describes these as ``scarlet medallions of
tomato flecked with herbs, tasting almost brazenly meaty and
sweet.'' It's hard to improve on that description, so I add only an
endorsement. I love opening the refrigerator door and finding a few
of these waiting. I could toss them in pasta or salads or add them
to pizzas. But often, I just pop one in my mouth.
</P>
<P>
   2 (28-ounce) cans peeled whole tomatoes, drained, halved and
seeded
</P>
<P>
   (preferably Muir Glen, Hunt's Contadina or Red Pack)
</P>
<P>
   1/2 to 2/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   14 large fresh basil leaves, torn
</P>
<P>
   2 (4-inch) branches fresh
</P>
<P>
   rosemary
</P>
<P>
   1/2 medium red onion, cut in
</P>
<P>
   1/4-inch dice
</P>
<P>
   5 large cloves garlic, coarsely chopped
</P>
<P>
   Salt
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 300 degrees. Spread tomatoes in a large shallow
pan (a half-sheet pan is ideal) and sprinkle with olive oil, basil
leaves, rosemary, onion, garlic, salt and pepper. Turn to coat well
with oil. Bake 2 1/4 to 2 1/2 hours, basting and turning tomatoes
several times. They're done when their color deepens to dark
scarlet and they taste mellow and very rich. Don't let them brown
or allow the garlic to brown because it will turn bitter.
</P>
<P>
   Transfer tomatoes and their oil to a glass or china bowl. Let
them mellow at room temperature up to 6 hours. The flavors will
ripen in this time. Refrigerate up to 4 days, or freeze up to 3
months. Serve at room temperature.

   It doesn't get any simpler or more delicious than toasted slices
of rough country bread rubbed with garlic and moistened with olive
oil. What you put on top is quite up to you. But here is a classic
Italian combination that's hard to beat. I used the finest goat
cheese I could find (at Whole Foods). If you wish, prepare the
toast and make a buffet of the ingredients and let guests build
their own. Kasper recommends pairing with a red Corvo Rosso wine
from Sicily.
</P>
<P>
   8 1/2-inch-thick slices chewy, crusty country bread
</P>
<P>
   2 cloves garlic, split
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup robust extra-virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   Several generous pinches dried oregano
</P>
<P>
   Salt
</P>
<P>
   Pinch of hot red pepper flakes
</P>
<P>
   1/2 pound Italian cheese: sheep's or cow's milk ricotta,
mozzarella, fresh goat cheese or medium-aged sheep cheese
</P>
<P>
   1/2 medium red onion, sliced in thin rings
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup mixed torn leaves fresh basil and Italian parsley
</P>
<P>
   (optional)
</P>
<P>
   6 to 8 Oven-Roasted Canned Tomatoes (see recipe), sun-dried
tomatoes or fresh tomatoes, chopped
</P>
<P>
   Toast bread over a wood fire or under a broiler or grill it on
top of the stove. Rub toast with garlic (for milder garlic flavor,
rub it on the bread before toasting) and moisten lightly with olive
oil. Sprinkle each slice with a little oregano, salt and red pepper
flakes. Cut each slice into 3 or 4 pieces. Top each slice with a
generous layer of cheese. Put several onion rings on the cheese.
Sprinkle with a few torn herb leaves and pieces of tomato. Serve at
room temperature.

   SOUP
</P>
<P>
   Hot-and-Spicy Eggplant Soup
</P>
<P>
   Makes 6 servings
</P>
<P>
   Preparation time: 20 minutes Marinating time: 20 minutes Cooking
time: 30-35 minutes
</P>
<P>
   The garnishes are as important as the soup here. Shredded
ricotta salata cheese adds depth. The mint and chiles provide the
tingling finish. We give both the summer and autumn versions.
Either way, this soup is hearty and for this menu should be served
in small portions. It can be made a day in advance. Kasper
recommends serving a round rustic red wine like Ceregio Sangiovese
di Romagna Superiore.
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 pounds long narrow Japanese eggplants, peeled and cut in
1/4- inch dice
</P>
<P>
   Salt
</P>
<P>
   1 (15-ounce) can chickpeas, rinsed and drained
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   2 1/2 to 3 1/2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 medium onion, cut in 1/4- to 1/2-inch dice
</P>
<P>
   2 tightly packed tablespoons chopped fresh Italian parsley
leaves
</P>
<P>
   6 large fresh basil leaves, chopped
</P>
<P>
   2 large cloves garlic, minced
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup dry white wine
</P>
<P>
   4 canned whole tomatoes, chopped, with 1/4 cup of their liquid
</P>
<P>
   3 1/2 to 5 cups water
</P>
<P>
   Garnishes:
</P>
<P>
   3 tightly packed tablespoons chopped fresh mint leaves
</P>
<P>
   2 medium-hot fresh chiles, seeded and cut in tiny dice
</P>
<P>
   1 cup (4 ounces) shredded ricotta salata cheese
</P>
<P>
   In a colander, toss the eggplant with about 1 tablespoon salt
and let stand 20 to 30 minutes. Meanwhile, in a bowl, marinate
chickpeas in 1 tablespoon of the vinegar and a little salt and
pepper for 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Turn the eggplant onto a towel and squeeze away about half its
moisture. Film the bottom of a 12-inch saute pan or a medium-size
soup pan or Dutch oven with 1 to 2 tablespoons of the olive oil and
heat over medium heat. Add the eggplant and saute 5 minutes, or
until pale gold and tender, seasoning with black pepper. Turn out
of the pan, reserve, and wash the pan.
</P>
<P>
   Set the pan over high heat and heat the remaining 1 1/2
tablespoons oil. Add the onions and parsley and quickly brown the
onions. Reduce heat to medium, stir in the chickpeas with their
marinade and cook about 3 minutes. Add the basil and garlic and
cook another 5 minutes, stirring frequently. Stir in the wine,
tomatoes and tomato liquid, reducing the heat to medium-low. Cook 2
to 3 minutes, uncovered, or until the liquid is rich-tasting and
thick.
</P>
<P>
   Stir in the eggplant and 3 1/2 cups of water, or enough to make
a thick broth. Simmer 15 minutes to blend the flavors. Stir in the
remaining 1 tablespoon vinegar and cook another few minutes. Taste
for seasoning.
</P>
<P>
   In summer, serve the soup at room temperature, garnishing each
portion with mint, chiles and cheese. In the fall, prepare the
variation below.
</P>
<P>
   Autumn Eggplant Soup: Follow the directions through sauteing
chickpeas and reducing tomatoes. Add 3 cups water to the chickpea
saute. Cook 15 minutes. Puree 1/3 of the soup in a blender or food
processor, and stir it back into the pan. Then add the eggplant and
remaining 1 tablespoon vinegar. Simmer another 10 minutes. Taste
for seasoning. Serve warm with the garnishes.

   MAIN DISH

   Balsamico Roast Chicken
</P>
<P>
   and Potatoes (Pollo Arrosto)
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Preparation time: 20 minutes Cooking time: 90 minutes Standing
time: 10 minutes
</P>
<P>
   This is a one-pan roasted dinner. Herbs and pancetta under the
skin of the chicken help it to roast and bronze while adding
unbeatable flavor. The potatoes roast right in the pan juices. It's
the essence of rustic Italian cooking, especially if you use the
best balsamic vinegar you can find. I rarely have instant repeats,
but I made this dish two Sundays in a row. Kasper recommends
serving with a Piemontese red Paitin Sori Paitin Dolcetto d'Alba.
</P>
<P>
   1 (3 1/2- to 4-pound) chicken (hormone- and antibiotic-free, if
possible) whole or cut up
</P>
<P>
   Salt
</P>
<P>
   1/4 medium onion
</P>
<P>
   3 large cloves garlic
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup tightly packed fresh basil leaves
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon dried basil
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon dried oregano
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon dried marjoram
</P>
<P>
   4 slices (1 1/2 to 2 ounces)
</P>
<P>
   pancetta, chopped
</P>
<P>
   5 tablespoons high-quality commercial balsamic vinegar, divided
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   6 medium Yellow Finn, Yukon Gold or red skinned
</P>
<P>
   potatoes, scrubbed and cut in 2-inch chunks
</P>
<P>
   1/2 to 1 cup dry white wine
</P>
<P>
   Parsley or fresh thyme for garnish
</P>
<P>
   If time allows, season the chicken with salt and refrigerate it
several hours or overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 400 degrees when ready to cook the chicken.
Mince together by hand or in a food processor the onion, garlic,
fresh basil, dried basil, oregano, marjoram and pancetta. Then
blend in 1 tablespoon of the balsamic vinegar, the olive oil and
salt and pepper to taste.
</P>
<P>
   If using a whole chicken, cut out the chicken's backbone and
open the chicken out flat, skin side up. With your palm, firmly
press down the breast area to flatten.
</P>
<P>
   Stuff most of the herb mixture under the skin of the thigh, leg
and breast areas or under the skin of each of the pieces if using a
pre-cut chicken. Rub the rest all over the chicken. Place the bird
or pieces skin side up on a large shallow pan (a broiler pan or
jelly-roll or half-sheet pan). Scatter the potatoes around it and
sprinkle everything with salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Roast 20 minutes, then pour in 1/2 cup wine. Roast another 70
minutes, or until the thigh reaches about 175 degrees on an
instant-read thermometer. Baste the potatoes and chicken frequently
with the pan juices, turning the potatoes often to brown evenly and
prevent them from sticking. Add more wine if the pan is dry. Turn
over the chicken two-thirds of the way through cooking for even
browning. If after an hour of roasting the chicken isn't browning,
raise the heat to 500 degrees to finish cooking. (Or wait until it
is done and run it under the broiler 5 minutes to crisp the skin.)
</P>
<P>
   Let the chicken rest 5 to 10 minutes at room temperature, then
present on a warmed platter along with the potatoes, sprinkling
everything with the rest of the balsamic vinegar. Garnish with
bouquets of parsley or fresh thyme.

   Simplest-of-All Green Beans
</P>
<P>
   Makes 6 servings Preparation time: 10 minutes Cooking time: 10
minutes
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons salt, plus more to taste
</P>
<P>
   3 quarts boiling water
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 pound green beans, trimmed
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon fruity olive oil (optional)
</P>
<P>
   Add the three tablespoons salt to boiling water. Drop in beans
and boil uncovered 5 to 10 minutes, until tender but with no hint
of mushiness. Timing varies greatly according to size, age and
freshness of the beans. Taste for doneness and trust your judgment,
not the clock. Drain immediately in a colander and turn into a
bowl. Most important is to season the hot beans right away with
salt and pepper. Then taste again, adding more seasoning if
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Serve hot, warm or at room temperature. Toss the beans in the
olive oil, if using, just before serving.

<P>
   Sweet Rosemary-Pear Pizza
</P>
<P>
   (Pizza alle Pere e Rosmarino)
</P>
<P>
   Makes 10 servings
</P>
<P>
   Chilling time: 30 minutes to overnight Preparation time: 30
minutes Cooking time: 20-25 minutes
</P>
<P>
   The spicing of this pizza is an unusual mixture of sweet and
savory straight out of centuries-old recipes for sweet pizzas. In
central and southern Italy, sweet pizzas used to be commonplace;
the flavor of this pie is uncommonly good. If you have a dough
phobia, rather than rolling out to a large, thin round, roll the
dough out just a bit, then place on the prepared pizza pan and
press the dough to the edges and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   For the pastry:
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 cups (7.5 ounces) unbleached all-purpose flour (preferably
organic)
</P>
<P>
   Generous 1/4 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 teaspoons granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 stick (4 ounces) cold unsalted butter, cut in chunks
</P>
<P>
   1 large egg, beaten
</P>
<P>
   2 to 3 tablespoons cold water
</P>
<P>
   For the topping:
</P>
<P>
   4 (1 1/2 to 2 pounds) firm-ripe Bosc pears (preferably
</P>
<P>
   organic)
</P>
<P>
   1/2 lemon
</P>
<P>
   Zest of 1 large orange, shredded
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil leaves
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon finely chopped fresh rosemary leaves
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   For the pastry: Combine the flour, salt and sugar in a food
processor or large bowl. Cut in the butter with rapid pulses in the
processor, or rub between your fingertips until the butter is the
size of peas. Add the egg and 2 tablespoons water. Pulse just until
the dough gathers in clumps, or toss with a fork until evenly
moistened. If the dough seems dry, blend in another 1/2 to 1
tablespoon water.
</P>
<P>
   Oil a 14- to 16-inch pizza pan. Roll out the dough on a floured
board to an extremely thin 17-inch round. Place on the pan. Don't
trim the excess pastry _ fold it over toward the center of the pie.
Refrigerate 30 minutes to overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Set an oven rack in the lowest position and preheat the oven to
500 degrees. Take the dough out of the refrigerator. Peel, core,
halve and stem pears. Slice vertically in 1/2-inch-wide wedges,
about 10-14 slices per pear. Moisten with a little lemon juice.
Fold back the dough's rim so it hangs over the edge of the pan.
Arrange the pear slices into an overlapping spiral on the dough,
starting right at the rim of the pan. Sprinkle with orange zest,
basil, rosemary, cinnamon, pepper, sugar and oil. Flip the
overhanging crust onto the pears.
</P>
<P>
   Bake 20 to 25 minutes, or until the pears are speckled golden
brown and the crust is crisp. Check the crust after the first 15
minutes and cover the crust's rim with foil if it's browning too
quickly. Remove the pizza from the oven and serve hot, warm or at
room temperature.

SURGING BRONCOS COMING TO TOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Talk about a reversal of fortune.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks ago, the Patriots couldn't wait for Denver to get to
Foxborough.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots were 4-0 and headed to Kansas City, with control of
their season clearly in their own hands.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos, the two-time defending Super Bowl champions, were
on the brink of disaster. They were 0-4 and heading to Oakland to
play a much-improved Raiders team. Head coach Mike Shanahan had
just benched second-year quarterback Brian Griese in favor of Bubby
Brister. But on game day, Brister said he couldn't play because of
an injury, and Griese was forced back into the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the Patriots have lost twice, to Kansas City and
Miami, in the final minute.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Denver has rebounded to stun the Raiders and the
Packers, reviving hopes of making the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Foxboro Stadium could become the real Spooky World for the home
team this week.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots have not beaten Denver since 1980. They have lost
11 in a row to the Broncos. They have lost to Denver each of the
past four years.
</P>
<P>
   On paper, the Broncos are not what the Patriots want to face.
They can run the ball. They can stop the pass. Just ask Brett
Favre.
</P>
<P>
   The Denver defense gave Favre the worst day of his career. He
and the highly regarded Green Bay offense were humbled. Green Bay
ran just 35 offensive plays; around 70 is normal. Of the 35 plays,
only 12 made yardage. On the other 23 offensive attempts, the
Packers either made no gain or lost yardage. On the day, they had
just 133 yards total offense, one of the worst performances in the
team's storied history.
</P>
<P>
   In the past three weeks, the Patriots' offense has been stuck in
the teens. It scored 16 points against the Giants, 14 in Kansas
City, and 16 against Miami. The Patriots' defense has not been able
to stop the run. Kansas City hammered them on the ground, and
Miami, playing without its top two linemen, rushed for more than
100 yards. Now comes Denver, with the best offensive line in the
league. A rookie named Olandis Gary rushed for 137 yards against
Green Bay, and most people would say that Green Bay has a better
defensive front than the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, John Elway and Terrell Davis were the Denver
dynamic duo who spanked the Patriots. Elway has retired. Davis is
out for the year with a knee injury. Pro Bowl tight end Shannon
Sharpe is out injured. Left tackle Harry Swayne went to Baltimore
in free agency.
</P>
<P>
   But after staggering out of the box with four straight losses,
Mike Shanahan has righted the ship. Shanahan says he won't announce
his starting quarterback yet, but how can it not be Griese after he
posted back-to-back wins?
</P>
<P>
   Over the last four games, the Denver defense has given up an
average of 11 points per game.
</P>
<P>
   On paper, the Broncos match up well with New England. Denver's
defense is third in the league against the pass, and the Patriots
have to live by the pass. They have proven for five years that they
cannot run the ball effectively.
</P>
<P>
   What has to be scary for Patriots fans is the way Denver can
rush the passer. The Broncos have 19 sacks. Trevor Pryce, a
first-round choice three years ago, is coming on strong as one of
the best pass rushers in the league.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive coordinator Gregg Robinson has had a way of getting a
lot of hits on Drew Bledsoe. When Bledsoe was a rookie in 1993,
playing in New York against a Jets team coached by someone named
Pete Carroll, Robinson was the Jets' defensive coordinator. Bledsoe
got hammered. In recent years, Robinson defenses in Denver have
knocked around Bledsoe with regularity.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots were awful on third downs against Miami: 2 for 11.
Denver is ranked third in the league defensively on third downs,
limiting the opposition to a 27.5 percent conversion rate. That is
a high rate of efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   Denver needs this win to stay in the playoff picture, and it has
a difficult schedule upcoming: vs. Minnesota, at San Diego, and at
Seattle. Both San Diego and Seattle are ahead of the Broncos in the
AFC West.
</P>
<P>
   With a loss to Denver, the Patriots can forget about home-field
advantage in the playoffs and start worrying about making the
playoffs. That seemed laughable two weeks ago when they were
undefeated and sitting in the catbird seat.

 &HT;    Italian cooking fresh from the farm
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Fusion is in. South American food is sizzling, and
tapas are still tempting, but food trends come and go.
</P>
<P>
   The popularity of Italian food, however, transcends trends, and
our love for it has grown beyond bowls of noodles in red sauce.
Witness the way Atlantans flock to such restaurants as La Grotta,
Veni Vidi Vici and newcomer Sotto Sotto, where the specialties are
creamy risottos, grilled fish, white beans and lamb shanks.
</P>
<P>
   It's the kind of food that beckons from the Italian countryside,
at once creative and comforting. Food like the portobello
``steaks'' with ``holy oil'' that Adelina Norcia, a farmwoman in
Sicily, makes. She brushes the large mushroom caps with olive oil
infused with a trinity of garlic, oregano and crushed chiles and
then grills until crispy.
</P>
<P>
   Or imagine digging into a bowl of tagliatelle with chicken ragu
and asparagus, like Ida Lancellotti and her son, Angelo, prepare in
a small restaurant in the Emilia-Romagna region.
</P>
<P>
   ``Italian food tastes to us like home cooking even if we don't
have a drop of Italian blood in us,'' said Lynne Rossetto Kasper,
who shares the stories and recipes of Norcia, the Lancellottis and
many other Italian farm families in her new book, ``The Italian
Country Table: Home Cooking From Italy's Farmhouse Kitchens''
(Scribner, $35).
</P>
<P>
   Kasper does have a drop or two of Italian blood. Both sets of
grandparents were Italian immigrants. She grew up and began her
culinary career in New York, teaching and writing in the late
1960s. Then she moved to Denver, where she created a cooking
school. In the early '80s she lived in Europe, which eventually led
her to research in her ancestral land of Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Her first major work was ``The Splendid Table'' (Morrow, 1992),
an enormous volume on 500 years of cooking in the Emilia-Romagna
region. The book was the first to win both the Julia Child/IACP and
the James Beard ``best cookbook of the year'' award, in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Now she hosts a nationally syndicated radio show on food by the
same name. Though it doesn't air locally, you can access recipes
and quick audio segments via the Web site, www.splendidtable.org.
</P>
<P>
   Since the first book was published, she has returned to Italy
each year to research the ``Country Table,'' staying with friends
and on guest farms all over rural Italy, witnessing both daily
rituals and special occasions, compiling the stories and collecting
the recipes. In addition to the cookbook, which arrived in
bookstores this month, there's an audio book with Kasper reading
the stories she collected.
</P>
<P>
   Her research began at a cousin's farm in Tuscany, where she
helped prepare a feast to celebrate the grape harvest. More than 70
friends, family and neighbors helped gather the grapes, and then
sat down at long tables in a hayloft to enjoy antipasti, beef
cutlets, roast chickens, pizzas, tarts, cookies and cakes.
</P>
<P>
   In Umbria in central Italy, she watched as a farmwoman prepared
a quick weeknight dinner for a crew of men who trained horses.
</P>
<P>
   ``She walked out her back door, picked some chives, put them on
a board with crushed garlic, salt and red onion. She used a
mezzaluna to chop it all together and drizzled the olive oil right
in. Then she tossed it with pasta, added a little cheese and she
had dinner,'' said Kasper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything begins with the land, with what's seasonal and
local,'' said Kasper. ``Country cooking is much more about what's
in the larder, the refrigerator. You can't run down to the corner
store.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Naples countryside, Kasper found that farmwomen often
make a casserole of mashed potatoes mixed with salami and peas.
Thick slices of mozzarella are buried in the center. Neapolitans
love mozzarella and it is plentiful there.
</P>
<P>
   But in the Italian Alps, Kasper befriended Margherita, the cook
at a cowherd's hut where hikers often stop to eat. Margherita used
buttermilk left over from her daily butter churning to cook
potatoes, then crushes them with browned butter. She has no
connection to mozzarella and wouldn't use it in her potatoes,
Kasper explains, but she had quarts of leftover buttermilk every
day.
</P>
<P>
   For the book, Kasper took great care in finding acceptable
substitutes for ingredients that may be hard to find here, and she
gives recommendations for brands and varieties of such items as
canned tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
   The cooler days upon us beckon comforting food. And for cooks,
it's an ideal time to bask in the warmth of the kitchen. Kasper
offers several menus in the book for casual fall dinners that are
hard to resist.
</P>
<P>
   Start with simple bruschetta, or toasted rounds of Italian
bread, and top with the best goat cheese you can find at the
grocery, some oven-roasted tomatoes that taste like candy and fresh
basil leaves.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a table in the kitchen, simply set up the fixings
for bruschetta and let guests build their own while you warm up
hot-and-spicy eggplant soup (which can be made a day ahead of time)
and prepare simple green beans.
</P>
<P>
   While folks are gathered around the table enjoying the soup,
with its garnishes of hot peppers and mint, the chicken and
potatoes will be browning in the oven.
</P>
<P>
   When the bird is roasted, transfer it with the potatoes a
platter and splash it with the best balsamic vinegar you can find.
With a paste of herbs and pancetta stuffed under the crisp skin,
this chicken is worthy of your finest friends.
</P>
<P>
   Finish with a pizza of pears sprinkled with rosemary, basil,
cinnamon, sugar, orange zest and olive oil _ a centuries-old
technique farmwomen used to do once a week as a special treat for
the family.
</P>
<P>
   With a few glasses of full Italian red wines, it's a meal that
will transport you to the Italian countryside.
</P>

 &HT;    Aromatic bread nearly foolproof
 &HT;    By Marcia Langhenry
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Silly me.
</P>
<P>
   I forgot about the Dilly Bread sought by C.A. Johnston Folds of
Decatur (Ga.). The 1960 Pillsbury Bake-Off winner should have rung
a bell, because it has become one of the company's all-time
favorites. The original recipe from Leona Schnuelle of Crab
Orchard, Neb., became so popular, in fact, it caused a run on dill
seed at grocery stores, according to Ralph V. Campbell of Doraville
(Ga.), one of dozens who sent copies of the Pillsbury recipe or one
of many that included slight changes and were published in
community cookbooks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amateurs _ even beginners _ with yeast doughs,'' Campbell
said, ``can have outstanding success with this unusual recipe but
should be forewarned that, while baking, it fills the house with
the most appetizing aroma known to mankind. Don't be surprised if
you cannot wait to cut into it. Fine! After a few minutes of
cooling, slice with an electric carving knife. The bread will still
be hot enough to melt butter.''
</P>
<P>
   As I write this, responses are still landing on my desk with
other comments from bakers who really love this recipe: ``great
with potato soup,'' ``large-curd cottage cheese makes a more
attractive product,'' ``this is the first bread I ever baked,'' and
``we prefer dill weed to dill seed.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the day the request was published, Jean Kay Holmes of
Bogart (Ga.) said she was getting ready to bake a loaf for a family
reunion that weekend.
</P>
<P>
   We wonder if it made it all the way to the get-together.

 &HT;    `Election' a fun take on slippery truth
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Election'' (R)
</P>
<P>
   A high school satire infused with precise anthropological
observation _ a combination that can make you both giggle and
wince. It's painfully funny.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Broderick plays Jim McAllister, a Nebraska schoolteacher
who really, really loves his job. Reese Witherspoon is his nemesis,
Tracy Flick, an overachieving student whose perky persona masks a
ruthless lust for power. Her latest target: presidency of the
student government. Letting us into the heads of both characters,
the movie takes a skeptical look at the idea of ``truth'' by
showing us the same situation from different perspectives,
``Rashomon''-style.
</P>
<P>
   Additional viewpoints come from two other students running for
SGA: a jock (Chris Klein) and his lesbian kid sister (Jessica
Campbell). Justifying their actions, they constitute a round-robin
chorus of self-deluded rationalizations. The film's unspoken idea
is that nobody really enters politics for the good of their
constituents. In ``Election'' we watch the characters (well, except
for jock Paul, who's too dim to scheme) break rules and lie to get
what they want. It's one of the movie's balder jokes that Jim
teaches his students the difference between ethics and morals, even
as his vendetta against Tracy blurs his own integrity, at school
and at home.
</P>
<P>
   As a decent guy who gets in over his head, Broderick is ideal,
lending both his boyish charisma and memories of his 1986 screen
role as class cutter Ferris Bueller. Witherspoon is a perfect foil,
a lethal kewpie doll with a glass-cutting chipmunk voice.
</P>
<P>
   Like one of last year's best movies, ``Rushmore,'' ``Election''
barely made a ripple at the box office. Rediscover it on tape.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A -

   ``The Best Man'' Soundtrack
</P>
<P>
   Various artists. Columbia. 14 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, the better-known R&AMP;B and rap artists on ``The Best
Man'' soundtrack don't necessarily turn in the best work here.
Hip-hop band the Roots' just-OK ``What You Want'' is not what you'd
expect from one of the few acts in this genre not afraid to change
chords and direction away from the usual material-minded
storytelling. Singer Maxwell's ``Let's Not Play the Game'' is an OK
exercise in how the cooer can also clip his vocals for effect. (He
sounds much more comfortable on ``As My Girl.'') And Beyonce from
Destiny's Child's soaring Disney-like duet with Marc Nelson,
``After All Is Said And Done,'' doesn't affect as much as Xscape's
Latocha Scott's piercing solo bow, ``Liar, Liar.'' For a much
better compilation with many of these same artists, try the ``Love
Jones'' soundtrack.

<P>
   Enjoyable fluff is nothing to be scoffed at. Sure, a steady
stream of cheesy pop will rot your brain as surely as a diet of
sugar will rot your teeth and seriously endanger your health. It's
a real treat in small doses, though. Tommy Hilfiger model Fredo
dispenses some tasty, nutrition-free pop candy. He has nothing new
to add to the musical lexicon, but the tunes are as beautifully put
together as Fredo's mug. Consummate radio pop such as ``This Time
Around'' and ``Love All Over Again'' should tickle the fancy of
Backstreet Boys fans everywhere.

   Patti LuPone. Varese Sarabande. 20 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Any Patti LuPone recording is an event. She defines the nature
of that event _ celebration, meditation, discovery _ by the
unpredictable mix of music she chooses. Here LuPone (Broadway's
``Evita'' and a whole lot more) swings her muscular mezzo from
Sondheim (``I Never Do Anything Twice'') to Lennon and McCartney
(``It's for You''), from Rodgers and Hammerstein (``A Cock-Eyed
Optimist'') to Beth Nielsen Chapman (``Sand and Water''). She sings
of love lost, found, kinky and unrequited. Of family. Of wistful
regret. Of passing the torch. It's as if LuPone, as talented as
anyone singing today, holds out her hand and invites you to join
her wild ride. What'll you find may surprise or sadden or enlighten
you. And it will most certainly leave you better for making the
trip.

 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Life'' (R) _ Eddie Murphy and Martin Lawrence bicker for
more than 60 years in this sometimes hilarious and racially
poignant prison comedy. How they landed in a Mississippi
correctional facility with life sentences isn't nearly as important
as the knack these talented performers have for taking turns at
generating laughs out of a throwaway script. Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   _Bob Longino
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``eXistenZ'' (R) _ In the near future, virtual-realty games
have become so mind-blowing that a counter movement called realists
has arisen. One of their targets is celebrity game inventor
Jennifer Jason Leigh, a.k.a., the ``game-pod goddess.'' Fans of
director David Cronenberg's creepy genius know to expect
mutilations, mutations, squishy-icky stuff and pitch-black humor.
But whether he's cracking you up or grossing you out, his is a
unique cinematic vision. Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   _Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``A Walk on the Moon'' (R) _ It's as fake as the tie-dyed
extras in its Woodstock re-creation. The movie starts as a fondly
observed look at upstate New York's Jewish family resorts. But when
housewife Pearl (Diane Lane) gets an itch once her husband goes
back to the city, her actions seem both dumb and selfish. By the
time she's making picturesque whoopee under a waterfall with her
lover, the movie has veered from well-observed 1960s character
study into silly soap opera. Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   _Steve Murray
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Metroland'' (R) _ This sometimes compelling film wonders if
settling down is the same as selling out. In 1977, a 30-ish ad man
(Christian Bale) with a wife (Emily Watson), baby, mortgage, etc.,
is taunted by his free-wheeling '60s youth when an old
counterculture buddy (Lee Scott) shows up. The movie starts well
but seems to lose energy _ conviction? _ as it goes along. Still,
the theme is worthy and the performances good, especially Watson
who does hard-headed sensible as well as high-strung flaky. Grade:
B-
</P>
<P>
   _Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Xiu Xiu: The Sent-Down Girl'' (R) _ Joan Chen demonstrates a
real director's touch in eliciting rich performances in this tale
of a Chinese girl relocated to the Tibetan outback. Chen gets
maximum effect from the gorgeous but indifferent landscape of her
locations. The story's emotional bleakness will limit its appeal,
and an over-explicit score underlines and weakens the movie's
punch. But it's a rigorous piece of work. Beautifully shot and
acted but brutal in its view of human nature, it's an art-house,
feel-bad film. Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   _Steve Murray
</P>
<P>
   NOTABLE DVDs
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Hard Eight'' (R) _ The goodies in this special edition of
Paul Thomas Anderson's (``Boogie Nights'') first movie include a
deleted scene and audio commentary by Anderson and star Philip
Baker Hall. While it's fun to hear the writer-director admit his
influences (``The Hustler,'' ``The Silence of the Lambs'' and
Jean-Pierre Melville's ``Bob le Flambeur''), Hall rambles on much
too long talking about the differences between acting for the
theater and acting onscreen. $27.95.

 &HT;    Every little thing Sting does is no longer magic
 &HT;    By Steve Dollar
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nope, it's just the same old stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Sting's latest album further establishes the singer as a pop
demigod emeritus, a once-major figure who has happily hit midcareer
autopilot. At this stage, with nothing left to prove and the
royalties continually rolling in, Sting can pretty much show up at
the Grammy Awards every year, collect his trophy, knock
</P>
<P>
   off a movie soundtrack or campaign for charity and then go
musing amid the lush landscape of his English country estate.
</P>
<P>
   Like a lot of mature, musically sophisticated male vocalists
whose solo careers peaked in the 1980s (think of fellow artsy
Anglos such as Steve Winwood, David Bowie and Peter Gabriel), Sting
seems a bit besides the point these days. He makes good albums, but
they lack the impact of the old days _ when the man born Gordon
Sumner dared to be the most pretentious man in rock (looks like
Smashing Pumpkins' Billy Corgan swiped the title). ``Brand New
Day'' offers a lovely, shifting tapestry in which easy, melodic pop
ballads get jazzy, percussive upgrades or detour into nouveau
country music and film noir soundscapes. (Helps to have buddies
like Branford Marsalis, Stevie Wonder and James Taylor dropping
by). Somehow, though, nearly all the songs _ midlife reflections on
love and eternity _ disappear into that fancy fabric. One
exception: ``Tomorrow We'll See,'' in which Sting sings from the
fatalistic point of view of a streetwalker (of vague gender), is
too weirdly contrived to overlook.

TEST BAN TREATY REJECTION SIGNALS MORE POLITICAL WARFARE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Oct. 24)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT E. THOMPSON  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ To rephrase Bette Davis' most memorable movie line,
``Fasten your seat belts, voters, it's going to be a bumpy year.''
</P>
<P>
   After months of acrimonious skirmishing, a war that will haunt
Bill Clinton's remaining days in the White House has begun with a
bang.
</P>
<P>
   It is not, to borrow Woodrow Wilson's description of World War
I, a war to end all wars. As long the presidency and the Congress
are dominated by ambitious individuals from opposing political
parties, the two institutions will be in conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is a parallel between the Wilson tragedy of 80 years
ago and Bill Clinton's problems today. In both instances, the
president was a victim of his own stubbornness as well as the
obstructionist tactics of his Republican opponents.
</P>
<P>
   The opening shots in the current showdown were fired on Oct. 13
when Senate Republicans defeated the nuclear test ban treaty and on
Oct. 14 when Clinton accused his foes of indulging in ``reckless
partisanship'' and retreating into isolationism.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and the GOP titans of Capitol Hill are engaged in a
battle that essentially is about power, politics and the coming
election.
</P>
<P>
   The president, although technically a lame duck, is obsessed
with the need to establish a legacy that will help counter memories
of the Monica Lewinsky affair. He is equally determined that Al
Gore will succeed him and that Hillary Clinton will succeed New
York Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans have their own political agenda. They seek to
expand their power, pick up additional House and Senate seats in
next year's election, reduce Clinton's authority now and place a
Republican in the Oval Office in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The president is rightly concerned that his prestige and that of
the United States may have been diminished by Senate rejection of
the nuclear treaty. The leaders of Britain, France and Germany all
urged the Senate to ratify the pact that they had signed.
</P>
<P>
   Some GOP members and most Democrats would have preferred to
delay the vote on the treaty until the next president has had a
chance to decide whether he wants it ratified. That strategy was
far preferable to outright rejection of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   But others, especially those on the far right who detest
Clinton, were determined to defeat the treaty now, although they
may have won a Pyrrhic victory. Only four moderate Republicans _
Rhode Island's John Chafee, Vermont's James Jeffords, Oregon's
Gordon Smith and Pennsylvania's Arlen Specter _ joined the
Democrats in support of the pact.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to claim that the GOP stance was wholly partisan
when it was backed by such Senate Republican internationalists as
Indiana's Richard Lugar, Arizona's John McCain, Virginia's John
Warner and Maine's Olympia Snowe.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, if the treaty were as dangerous as its critics
claim, it would not have been supported by such highly respected
Democrats as Moynihan, South Dakota's Thomas Daschle, Nebraska's
Bob Kerrey, California's Dianne Feinstein and Louisiana's John
Breaux.
</P>
<P>
   As the ailing Wilson might have saved the League of Nations in
1919 by agreeing to reservations demanded by the Republicans,
Clinton might have prevented rejection of the test ban treaty by
agreeing not to seek its ratification during the remainder of this
presidential term.
</P>
<P>
   But both presidents drew the line on how far they would go to
satisfy the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate's refusal to ratify the test ban pact marked the
first time it had voted down a treaty since it rejected the 1919
Treaty of Versailles officially ending World War I and creating the
League of Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Every Republican president since Herbert Hoover has had to deal
with a Democratic Congress during all or part of his tenure, while
only two Democrats, Harry Truman and Clinton, have been confronted
with Republican-dominated Congresses.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent visit to Virginia, former President George Bush,
whose son could be the next president, described what it was like
for a Republican chief executive to confront a Democratic Congress
for four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a hell of a time fighting with an entrenched
congressional leadership that seemed determined to fight me at
every turn,'' said Bush. ``We were playing hardball politics and it
was kind of uphill and we weren't able to take the offensive.''
</P>
<P>
   If Wilson were alive he could recount an even more agonizing
tale.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after the fighting in World War I stopped in
November 1918, he journeyed to Paris as the head of the American
delegation to the Versailles Peace Conference where he conferred
with the leaders of England, France and Italy.
</P>
<P>
   But he had made two mistakes. He first asked the people to
reelect a Democratic Congress in 1918, and instead they chose
Republicans. Then he did not include any Republican senator or any
other representative of the Republican Party in the peace
delegation.
</P>
<P>
   After months of often-heated negotiations, Wilson and the other
leaders signed the Treaty of Versailles in 1919. Wilson then
returned home and launched a cross-country tour to sell the League
of Nations to the American people. That journey ended when he was
felled by a debilitating stroke.
</P>
<P>
   But from his sick bed he fought on, refusing to accept
concessions demanded by Senate Republicans because he claimed they
would destroy the League. Thus, the treaty and U.S. membership in
the League failed to win Senate approval.
</P>
<P>
   And, as Wilson predicted, another world war began two decades
later.
</P>
<P>
   In Clinton's case, it is possible that rejection of the test ban
treaty could spur India, Pakistan and other countries to move more
swiftly down a perilous path toward nuclear conflagration.

A RACING PIONEER WHO WAS DRIVEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA HUEBNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Janet Guthrie said that she harbors no malice. That
times have changed. That even back 22 years ago, while a target of
endless ``woman driver'' jokes as the first female to drive in the
Indianapolis 500, she was able to shrug off the sexist ridicule,
the gratuitous barbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mostly I could laugh at it,'' Guthrie recalled. ``I really did
think it was funny.''
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean she's forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   When Guthrie was approached for an interview Monday afternoon
after a rehearsal for the Women's Sports Foundation's 20th annual
Salute to Women in Sports, she quickly agreed. She just as quickly
recited the gist of a 1976 column in the Globe that painted a
picture of her futilely fishing through her handbag for the keys to
her car at the start of the race, sifting through bobby pins and
makeup and hairbrushes, then using the rear-view mirror to judge
her mascara as the other 32 drivers angrily blew their horns.
</P>
<P>
   I'll meet you after lunch if you don't mind chatting while I get
a manicure, she concluded breezily.
</P>
<P>
   Whew.
</P>
<P>
   The 61-year-old Guthrie, who in 1980 was among the first class
of inductees into the foundation's International Women's Sports
Hall of Fame, wears her history as matter-of-factly as she wears
her tailored gray pantsuit but relays it with a quick and flawless
smile. As far as she's concerned, she should have been respected in
the first place, as a driver who had competed for 13 years on
sports car road-racing circuits before she ever showed up at the
fabled speedway in Indianapolis. (``I knew the fact that I was a
woman was completely irrelevant,'' she said. ``It was just that
nobody else seemed to know that.'')
</P>
<P>
   When it became clear she was going to have to prove herself
beyond what would have been expected of a man, she figured she'd
just have to drive fast and well to shut everyone up. For the most
part, she did just that, finishing ninth at Indy in 1978, beating
25 of the 32 male drivers while competing with a broken wrist.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's done a good job,'' Bobby Unser told the Philadelphia
Inquirer magazine in 1979. ``I gotta admit that I had my doubts
about her. But she's proven her point.''
</P>
<P>
   If Guthrie carries any sadness, it's that she didn't get a
chance to prove it year after year. Despite a solid early career in
both Indy cars and on the NASCAR stock-car circuit, she was able to
find top-level sponsorship for only three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I had been able to go on, but no money, no race,'' she
said. ``That remains a problem for many women athletes. I was
shocked and dismayed. You can compare my record in my 11 Indy-car
races with the first 11 Indy-car races of any of the superstars,
and I think you would find the comparison quite decent. I had a
hard time reconciling myself to that. It was a sport I loved very
much.''
</P>
<P>
   So Guthrie, who had trained as a physicist and once hoped to
become an astronaut, left for Colorado to write a book that reached
1,200 pages by the time she said everything she had to say. It
awaits publication.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I'm cutting,'' she explained.
</P>

   Among the most popular honorees at Monday's gala were members of
the 1999 US women's soccer team that won the Women's World Cup,
including Michelle Akers, Briana Scurry, Saskia Webber, Tracy
Ducar, Julie Foudy, Kristine Lilly, Carla Overbeck, Cristie Pearce,
and Sara Whalen. Led by Mia Hamm, who was named Team Sportswoman of
the Year for the second time in three years, even those who
couldn't make it, including Brandi Chastain, received their share
of attention. ``Hopefully the next time we can host the World Cup,
we're going to ask Brandi to take off her shirt in the first game
because then we know we're going to get more than 650,000 people to
come out to the games,'' joked Hamm . . . The World Cup hardly went
unnoticed by the children of several other award winners, either.
Juli Inkster, who was named Individual Sportswoman of the Year,
reported that her two daughters, ages 5 and 9, ``loved following
the World Cup. They were all over it.'' Afterward at a champagne
reception, Joan Samuelson's husband, Scott, clutched a folded Mia
Hamm jersey for autographing on behalf of daughter Abby, who will
be 12 Saturday. Samuelson was one of four women inducted into the
Hall of Fame . . . Foudy, a World Cup co-captain, will succeed
Basketball Hall of Famer Nancy Lieberman-Cline as president of the
Women's Sports Foundation in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The oddest pairing of the night had to be the outrageously perky
Goldie Hawn giggling her way through presenting the reserved
Samuelson with her induction award . . . Also among the presenters
was Buffalo Bills quarterback Doug Flutie, who confessed, ``We did
a celebrity ski race six or seven years ago, and Joan Benoit kicked
my butt.'' Before she broke her leg on the slopes of Pleasant
Mountain in Maine as a 15-year-old, Samuelson had dreams of
becoming a world-class skier . . . Flutie, joined on stage by his
10-year-old daughter, Alexa, gave an example of how times are
changing: After watching the Gatorade ad featuring Hamm and Michael
Jordan that began airing during the World Cup, Alexa turned to her
father and asked, ``Who's the guy in the commercial with Mia?'' . .
. Although this was the 20th year for the awards dinner, the
foundation itself has reached the quarter-century mark. To note the
achievement, the celebration was subtitled ``25 Years of Making a
Difference'' . . . Six of the eight surviving co-founders of the
LPGA _ Alice Bauer, Patty Berg, Marilynn Smith, Betty Jameson,
Bettye Danoff, and Shirley Spork _ attended. ``When Babe
(Didricksen Zaharias) died, it strengthened the bond among all of
us. It made us determined that the organization didn't die.'' said
Smith. Zaharias, one of the co-founders, died of cancer in 1956 at
age 43 . . . Cammi Granato, captain of the 1998 Olympic ice hockey
team who missed last year's dinner ``because I had a real job,''
was there this time around. Granato is taking a year's leave of
absence from her job as radio color commentator for the NHL's Los
Angeles Kings to train full time. Joining her were teammates Karyn
Bye and A.J. Mleczko. Mleczko, who led Harvard to the national
title last spring, was a nominee for Team Sportswoman of the Year.

   Also getting a night in the spotlight were athletes in the top
echelons of less-publicized sports. Among the 100-plus women who
paraded across the stage of the Waldorf-Astoria's Grand Ballroom in
the traditional march of athletes were:
</P>
<P>
   --Jill Bakken, bobsled. Ranked among the top 10 in the world
since 1995, Bakken will be a favorite to compete in the 2002
Olympics, in which women's bobsled will make its debut.
</P>
<P>
   --Rhoni Barton, waterskiing. A professional competitor in
slalom, tricks, and jumps, Barton was among the finalists for
Individual Sportswoman of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   --Janet Dykman, archery. At 47,Dykman has qualified to compete
in Sydney. In 1996, she posted the best Olympic finish ever for the
US by reaching the quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
   --Cheryl Haworth, weightlifting. Owner of 35 American records,
the 17-year-old is also headed for Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   --Jan Schmidt, bowling. Marketing director for the professional
women's bowling association, Schmidt won the Women's International
Bowling Association national singles title in 1997.

   The Ritz-Carlton, the reputed grande dame of the city's luxury
hotels, has been sold for $122 million to Millennium Partners, a
New York developer that unveiled plans Tuesday to open a second
Ritz-Carlton in Boston in the spring of 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The new 155-room Ritz will face Boston Common as part of the
$500 million Millennium Place project, which will include 270
premium condominiums, a movie theater, fitness club and 85
apartments, all within two city blocks bounded by Washington,
Tremont and Boylston streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is great news for the city,'' said Mayor Thomas M.
Menino, who was present for the announcement on the Ritz's Roof
Restaurant. ``It blows your mind that they're putting a
Ritz-Carlton on Washington Street.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Millennium is considering closing the current
Ritz for one year to give the hotel a sorely needed $30 million
face lift. The alternative, to keep portions of the 72-year-old
hotel open while it is renovated piecemeal, would take several
years and might disturb guests, said Christopher Jeffries,
principal and founding partner of Millennium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am nervous that such extensive renovation would make for a
miserable guest experience,'' said Jeffries, who said a final
decision is dependent on a feasibility study now underway.
</P>
<P>
   The Ritz-Carlton, a 17-story beaux-arts style hotel that has
hosted Winston Churchill, John F. Kennedy and Tennessee Williams,
is widely seen as being somewhat dated. Cracks in its facade and
small room size are among the problems that the renovation would
address, Jeffries said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Ritz is relatively full, with 88 percent of its
rooms occupied Wednesday, according to Henri A. Boubee, general
manager of the hotel. The high occupancy suggests that Millennium
may wait for the new Ritz hotel on Washington Street to open before
proceeding in earnest with renovations of the current Ritz on
Arlington Street to take advantage of the red hot hotel market,
industry analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Boston hotel rooms commanded the second-highest
prices in the country, averaging $177.65 a night, according to John
A. Fox, senior vice president of PKF Consulting Inc. in New York.
Boston's hotel occupancy rate _ 78.8 percent _ was the
third-highest in the country.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the market shows no signs of cooling. In August, 85.7
percent of the Boston's hotel rooms were full, compared to 83.4
percent in August 1998, according to PKF figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boston is one of the hottest hotel markets in the country,''
said Fox, who attributed the strength to a combination of a limited
supply of rooms and surging demand in a booming local economy.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether Boston could support two Ritz-Carlton hotels only
a few blocks apart, Jeffries said the city could use 10
Ritz-Carltons. ``The demand for luxury hotel rooms is enormous
here,'' said Jeffries, who noted there were fewer than 1,000 luxury
hotel rooms in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The market is so good that officials at the Four Seasons Hotel,
the luxury hotel that has emerged as the Ritz's main rival just a
block away on Boylston Street, went so far as to welcome the
addition of a new hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about as positive as it could be,'' said Robin A.
Brown, general manager of the Four Seasons, which had just two
vacant rooms out of 288. ``Having two Ritz-Carltons in the city
will attract more sophisticated travelers to Boston, which will
benefit us all.''
</P>
<P>
   Millennium is seeking to differentiate the two Ritz-Carlton
hotels by giving the new hotel a more contemporary look of glass
and steel, while preserving the old world mahogany-trimmed elegance
of the current hotel, where rooms start at $250 a night and top out
at $2,500 for a suite that comes with a jacuzzi and private butler.
</P>
<P>
   While Millennium is developing four Ritz-Carlton hotels
elsewhere in the country, including two in Washington, D.C., one in
Atlanta and another in New York city, the Boston hotel is the
company's first acquisition of an already established hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made an exception because we wanted to control the
Ritz-Carlton name in Boston,'' said Jeffries.
</P>
<P>
   The Ritz, which was mostly recently owned by the Host Marriott
Corp., has changed hands several times in recent years as it fell
upon hard financial times. The hotel's $135 million mortgage was in
default when it was auctioned for $75 million in 1998 to the
Blackstone Group, a privately held New York investment firm. Two
months later, Blackstone sold the hotel to Host Marriott for a
reported $130 million.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the Ritz insisted that the hotel was profitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hotel is doing extremely well,'' said Leonardo Inghilleri,
vice president of the Ritz-Carlton Hotel Co., which runs the hotel.

BIRTH CONTROL BILLBOARD TRIGGERS PROTEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARIANNE COSTANTINOU  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ It was a small billboard, as billboards go,
not even by the road and not even facing the right direction. But
the message was loud and clear.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes after the sign went up Tuesday afternoon inside a
fenced yard on the edge of West Oakland, it was angrily torn down.
The sign was aimed at drug-addicted women. The offer was $200 cash
if the women got birth control.
</P>
<P>
   The mission is to prevent the birth of drug-addicted babies, who
too often end up disabled and unwanted, said the sponsor of the
billboard, Barbara Harris, the founder of CRACK, or Children
Requiring A Caring Kommunity, a 2-year-old organization.
</P>
<P>
   But to the two dozen community activists and recovering mothers
who showed up at West Grand Avenue and Market Street to sing and
shout in protest, the billboard was an affront to poor black women.
</P>
<P>
   Harris, from Orange County, and her pair of supporters from
Marin County are white. The neighborhood and the demonstrators were
mostly black.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's saying `Neuter poor women,''' said Ethel Long-Scott, 45,
head of the Women's Economic Agenda Project, an organization that
deals with the politics of race and class issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are not wanted,'' she shouted to Harris and her
supporters. ``Take your money and get out of Oakland. Take that to
the rich neighborhoods.''
</P>
<P>
   But to Harris, who has adopted four black children who were
crack babies, her mission has nothing to do with class or race.
</P>
<P>
   It's about saving children she said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, 85 women in California, Illinois, Pennsylvania and
Michigan have taken her up on the $200 offer, she said. Of them, 36
were white, 34 were black and 15 Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The billboard shouldn't offend them,'' Harris, 47, said. ``The
need for the billboard should offend them.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Harris' program, the women get the $200 for any long-term
or permanent birth control. Of the 85 women, 59 got tubal
ligations, 12 got Norplant, 10 got Depo-Provera treatments and
three received IUDs. Norplant consists of capsules that are
surgically inserted under the skin in the upper arm and last about
five years.
</P>
<P>
   Depo-Provera provides birth control for three months with one
injection.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the protesters worried that women might be so tempted by
the $200 offer that they may make decisions that they would later
regret, especially in the case of tubal ligations, which are
difficult to reverse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Giving $200 to a poor woman, especially if she's
drug-addicted, is a fortune,'' Long-Scott said, who said the money
might be used to buy more drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``How are you going to give money to a drug addict? You're just
giving them a death warrant,'' said Davette Thomas, 29, of the
Women's Economic Agenda Project.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the $200 offer is appearing on billboards in Southern
California, Fresno, Sacramento, Las Vegas, Tucson, and Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   None of the locations had the same opposition as the scene in
West Oakland, Harris said.

   Heat 3 tablespoons of butter in a heavy 12-inch skillet over
high heat for 1 1/2 to 2 minutes, until it melts, foams up, then
subsides. Add half the pork and stir-fry 3 minutes, until no longer
pink. With slotted spoon, lift to a large heat-proof bowl and
reserve. Brown remaining pork the same way. Return first batch to
skillet, pour in Calvados, heat for about 1 minute, then blaze with
a match. As soon as flames subside, transfer skillet mixture to
bowl, sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon of salt and pepper and set aside.
Keep skillet handy.
</P>
<P>
   In small, heavy saucepan, melt 2 tablespoons of remaining butter
over moderate heat. Blend in flour to make a smooth paste. Add
broth and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt; cook 3 to 5 minutes,
stirring constantly, until thickened and smooth. Remove sauce from
heat and reserve.
</P>
<P>
   Add final 3 tablespoons butter to skillet and set over moderate
heat. When it melts, add onion and saute about 5 minutes, stirring
often, until limp and golden. Add mushrooms, reduce heat to low and
saute 5 minutes, stirring often, until mushrooms have released
their juices and these evaporate. Add riesling and red wine, raise
heat to moderately high, and boil uncovered for 3 to 4 minutes,
until skillet liquid is reduced by two-thirds. Add tomatoes, olives
and pimentos, and bring to simmer over moderate heat. Mix in
reserved sauce, mustard, Worcestershire, red pepper sauce, port and
cream. Bring to a boil over moderate heat. Adjust heat so mixture
bubbles gently and simmer, uncovered, for 25 to 30 minutes,
stirring often, until skillet liquid is reduced by about half and
is the consistency of gravy. Mix in corn, reserved pork, and all
pork liquid and simmer, uncovered, for 3 to 5 minutes, just until
serving temperature. Serve over rice.

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Pastry:
</P>
<P>
   6 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut into small cubes
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   2 1/4 cups sifted all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon baking powder
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup cold milk
</P>
<P>
   1 extra-large egg yolk blended with 1 tablespoon milk (this is
the glaze)
</P>
<P>
   Filling:
</P>
<P>
   2 pounds Italian black plums, pitted (but not peeled), then
quartered, but not cut all the way through so quarters can be
spread like flower petals, or 2 (16 ounces) cans purple plums,
drained well, pitted and halved.
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup soft white bread crumbs, optional
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup sugar mixed with 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Generously butter bottom and sides
of 11-inch slip-bottom tart tin and set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Cream butter in small mixer bowl with electric mixer at high
speed for 2 to 3 minutes, until light and fluffy. With motor still
running, add sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time. Continue beating 2 to 3
minutes longer. By hand, mix in flour, baking powder and salt, then
the milk, stirring after each addition only enough to combine.
Press pastry smoothly over bottom and up sides of prepared tart
tin, brush with egg glaze and set aside.
</P>
<P>
   If plums seem very juicy, scatter bread crumbs evenly over the
pastry. Arrange plums skin-side down in pastry shell in rows,
fanning quarters out and overlapping plums slightly. (If using
canned plums, arrange halves hollow side down in concentric
circles.) Sprinkle with cinnamon sugar.
</P>
<P>
   Set tart on baking sheet and bake in lower third of oven for
40-45 minutes until pastry is nicely browned and filling is bubbly.
Before cutting, cool tart to room temperature on wire rack.
</P>
<P>
   To serve, carefully loosen and remove tart tin sides, then
transfer tart (still on pan bottom) to round platter or cake stand.
Cut into wedges at table.

SAY AUF WIEDERSEHEN TO SUMMER FARE, WITH HEARTY BUT FLAVORFUL
DISHES

<P>
   Face it. German food isn't sexy.
</P>
<P>
   But the short shrift that German fare gets in this country isn't
fair.
</P>
<P>
   Too often labeled heavy and mundane, German food is perhaps too
close to our own home cooking for us to appreciate its nuances. And
there are nuances. We too often tend to associate German food with
huge portions of underspiced cabbage, warm potato salad and fat
wursts, all accompanied by loud music.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, there's a lot of meat and potatoes, but there are also the
glories of white asparagus in the spring and earthy mushrooms in
the autumn and delicate cookies at Christmastime. There's always
bread with gumption and wondrous cheese and snappy mustard and
luscious wine and beer with body.
</P>
<P>
   When Francophile Patricia Wells reviewed the restaurants of the
world for an International Herald Tribune series, she ``went
kicking and screaming to Germany.'' But to her surprise, ``I found
several lovely restaurants there.''
</P>
<P>
   And, indeed, despite a history of wars and famines (agriculture
yields weren't stable until the potato migrated from here to there
in the 18th century), the Germans managed to create a cuisine of
rich stews and brined vegetables and formidable noodles and
dumplings. The cooks aren't the alchemists of Italy or France, but
this food, along with that of the British, helped fashion the way
we cook in America today. Chicken-fried steak is more akin to
schnitzel than it is to steak au poivre.
</P>
<P>
   German leaf salads are lovely _ usually a combination of butter
lettuce with some pickled or marinated vegetables, such as baby
corn or salsify or green beans. Soups run the gamut from light,
cold berry combinations to sturdy liver-dumpling numbers. Meats
include everything from the barnyard _ not just the pork we so
often expect _ and quite a haul from the sea.
</P>
<P>
   As summer melts into winter, all of this not-so-sexy food
becomes a lot more appealing.

   1/2 cup plain low-fat yogurt

<P>
   1/4 cup fresh dill, chopped medium-fine
</P>
<P>
   1 1/4 pounds pickling cucumbers, peeled and thinly sliced
</P>
<P>
   Whisk first 6 ingredients together until creamy. Taste for
mustard and add a bit more, if needed; there should be a distinct
mustard flavor, but take care not to add so much that you overpower
the flavor of the cucumbers. Add cucumbers to bowl and toss well to
mix. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 4 hours
before serving, or better yet, chill overnight.

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: Searching for Willie Morris
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   YAZOO CITY, Miss. _ I was standing beside the highway that leads
into the center of town, reading a historical marker that turned
out to be all about the C.S.S. Arkansas, an ironclad ram
commissioned by the Confederate Navy on July 14, 1862.
</P>
<P>
   According to Mississippi's version of Civil War history, the
Arkansas was the scourge of the Yazoo and Mississippi rivers,
engaging the combined Union fleet at the naval siege of Vicksburg.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Confederacy itself, the glory of the Arkansas was
brief, ``scuttled north of Baton Rouge Aug. 5, 1862 to prevent
capture by Union forces.''
</P>
<P>
   But not one word about Willie Morris.
</P>
<P>
   Such was my quest so early in the morning, to discover what
memorials Yazoo City has bestowed on its recently departed, most
famous man of letters. I would have thought a plaque at the very
least.
</P>
<P>
   Willie Morris died this year at a too-young age, hardly in his
60s. Jackson, where he made his home in recent times, treated him
properly in death, seeing to it that his body lay in state in the
rotunda of Mississippi's Old Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Texas has its own claim to Willie Morris, renowned in his youth
as a muckraker in the finest traditions of journalism, first as
editor of the University of Texas campus newspaper and later as
editor of the Austin-based Texas Observer.
</P>
<P>
   He went on to edit Harper's magazine in New York for a brief,
glorious career _ best remembered for printing in one issue the
entire text of Norman Mailer's ``Armies of the Night,'' which would
win a Pulitzer in book form.
</P>
<P>
   Though Willie Morris made publishing history, he did not make
enough money for the magazine's publishers. Eventually, sadly, he
was forced out.
</P>
<P>
   I never met him, despite our having mutual friends. One time I
had hoped we could get together in Oxford, Miss., where he was
writer in residence at Ole Miss. As it turned out, he was traveling
on the day I was visiting.
</P>
<P>
   His first book has long been considered his best book, ``North
Toward Home,'' a young man's memoir, from Yazoo City to New York
City.
</P>
<P>
   But Willie Morris did it right, dying at the right time. His
last book, ``My Dog Skip,'' a story from his boyhood, has become
his greatest success, including a Hollywood deal with all the
trimmings.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing to compare, of course, with the C.S.S. Arkansas, when it
comes to markers. Or so it seemed.
</P>
<P>
   Early as it was that morning in Yazoo City, there was no one
that I could find to ask: What have they done for Willie Morris
lately?
</P>
<P>
   Only later, on down the road, was I able to telephone the
Chamber of Commerce. A nice Southern lady was happy to fill me in.
</P>
<P>
   Yazoo City has ``My Dog Skip'' tours that visit the sites that
Willie Morris wrote about. His cemetery plot is an attraction
itself, buried as he is just 13 steps from the Witch's Grave, the
occupant of which, local legend says, used her black magic to burn
down the town. Willie, in turn, used her for one of his stories.
</P>
<P>
   More is planned. An exhibit is in the works. No reason not to
think that eventually he'll be right up there with Jerry Clower,
the country comedian, Yazoo City's other famous son who died this
past year.
</P>
<P>
   So, stop by if you're in the neighborhood of Yazoo City. They
seem like nice folks, who remember their own in the nicest way.
</P>
<P>
   P.S. Remember the Arkansas!

 &HT;    CHINA STATE TV SAYS ATLANTA ZOO TO GET TWO PANDAS SOON, BUT IS

   KORLA, China _ Pandemonium!
</P>
<P>
   Two of China's national treasures, a pair of panda bears, will
be going to Zoo Atlanta by the end of this month, the dominant
state television network here CCTV-1 reported late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But whether 2-year-old female Lun Lun and her 2-year-old male
pal Yang Yang were really about to split from the Chengdu Research
Base of Giant Panda Breeding appeared to be still slightly up in
the air Thursday(CQ), despite this unqualified report to millions
of viewers on Chinese government-run television.
</P>
<P>
   Late Wednesday night, Sarah Bexell, Zoo Atlanta's researcher on
the ground in China, said she had no official confirmation that
China's ruling State Council had finally approved the long-delayed
export permit.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be great news,'' said Bexell after hearing about
the TV report.
</P>
<P>
   Xinhua, China's official news agency, carried nothing about the
prospect that the two pre-adolescent fuzz balls had been given
formal permission to grow up half-way around the world in
air-conditioned cages in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Without signed export licenses, the pandas aren't going
anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Zoo Atlanta and its winged partner United Parcel
Service were already deep into contingency planning to fly the two
pandas out of Beijing International Airport at 5 a.m. (local time)
on Oct. 28.
</P>
<P>
   Zoo Atlanta's ranking veterinarian, Dr. Rita McManamon, has
reservations to arrive in Beijing and go on to Chengdu on Sunday to
accompany Lun Lun and Yang Yang on their flight to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   If there is no pandemic problem, they should cross the
international dateline and arive at Atlanta's Hartsfield
International Airport at around 9 a.m. (EDT) on Oct. 28.
</P>
<P>
   The television news segment was built on an interview taped
earlier in the day with Bexell, who was asked by a CCTV reporter
about her research and how it will help protect the giant panda, an
endangered species in China.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of the report, the Chinese journalist said simply
that the two pandas will head to Atlanta by the end of the month.
The television news did not mention the need for export permits or
the delay already keeping Zoo Atlanta guessing about when or
whether it will receive the pandas.
</P>
<P>
   An expected Oct. 7 departure was missed for lack of the
requisite Chinese export approvals. Now the paperwork has been
bumped all the way to the top of the bureaucracy, awaiting approval
only from the State Council and Prime Minister Zhu Rongji.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   After setting another shipment date of Oct. 28, Zoo Atlanta, the
Chinese panda keepers and UPS have set in motion the plan to
transport Lun Lun and Yang Yang from their home amid bamboo
thickets to their new home in the southeastern U.S.
</P>
<P>
   The two animals, who are at a rolly-polly rambunctious stage of
panda life, have been spending time just about every day in the
cages provided by UPS to get used to their temporary habitat for
the 10,000-mile air trip.
</P>
<P>
   A UPS spokeswoman said its special ``Panda Express'' plane,
painted with a panda motif and donated for this flight, is planned
to arrive in Beijing on the morning of Wed., Oct. 27. This assumes
that UPS is granted the necessary landing rights to fly into
Beijing airport.
</P>
<P>
   Later that day, the pandas will fly to Beijing on a Chinese
commercial flight from the Chengdu base where they were born, then
hitch up with the UPS plane.
</P>
<P>
   The UPS plane, the vet and the pandas are scheduled to depart
around 5 a.m. on Oct. 28 Beijing time, arriving in time for
Atlantans' morning coffee break.
</P>
<P>
   That is, it will happen if China's bureaucrats come through with
the export permit.
</P>

<P>
   The Kansas City Star plans to move the following stories for use
by clients of the NYTimes News Service for AMs and PMs of Thursday,
Oct. 21. If you have any questions, please call The Star's News
Desk at (816) 234-4720.

<P>
   ACCRED: The state Board of Education _ on Tuesday anyway _
appeared steadfast in its desire to revoke accreditation for the KC
School District despite the school board's pledge to fight the move
in court. Meanwhile, the school board continues efforts to press
its case. Lance Loewenstein meets with The Star's editorial board
Wednesday. We recheck the state board's position Wednesday, check
the stance in St. Louis and add more detail to the potential
outcome of losing accreditation. Phil O'Connor.
</P>
<P>
   BART (with ACCRED): Other educational leaders say the
recommendation to strip KC and St. Louis of accreditation is a
gutsy move by state Education Commissioner Bob Bartman. But Bartman
says it's the right thing to do for the kids. A profile of the
former Vietnam platoon leader, marathon runner and speaker of

<P>
   NELSON: Federal indictment likely today against Keith Nelson.
Those charges could include counts for murder, kidnapping and
sexual abuse of Pamela Butler. All of those counts could carry the
death penalty. Mark Morris. 20. File mug.
</P>
<P>
   GRIEF (with NELSON): The Pamela Butler visitation, and the
funeral today, are drawing strangers as well as friends of the
family, repeating a phenomenon seen worldwide with JFK Jr. and
Princess Di, and on a lesser scale when teen-agers leave flowers
and memorials where dead friends died: mass public grieving. This
is a contrast from the time when strangers just didn't intrude on
people's grief. So what is it about society that has caused all
this change? We talk to experts and people who participate. Don
Bradley and John Martellaro. 25.
</P>
<P>
   EVICT: An elderly woman with two adult disabled children is
being foreclosed on Thursday. Neighborhood people are rallying
behind her because she appears to be a victim of a home improvement
loan program that preys on inner city residents. Ruth Igoe. 18.

   DERRICK. The subject came up a month ago in a casual
conversation with Derrick Alexander about the impending return of
Denver cornerback Dale Carter to Kansas City and Arrowhead Stadium.
Alexander, the Chiefs wide receiver, said he had a pretty good
guess about how Carter felt playing against his former team because
Alexander himself was just a few weeks from playing in a similar
game. ``When we go back to Baltimore this year,'' Alexander said,
``I feel like I'm going to have to play the best game I've ever
played in my life.'' Adam Teicher. 20.

Conservancy, a national group devoted to preserving unique American

Cabot said. ``But usually these people are wonderful characters,

evict the museum and its vast holdings of artwork. City officials

<P>
   Cox News Service is preparing to distribute another compelling
investigative series on the U.S. military by The Dayton Daily News.
``Falling From the Sky,'' a six-day series that starts Sunday, Oct.
24, concerns the recent rise in military air crashes and its
causes. The Daily News found that the U.S. military routinely sends
planes and helicopters in the air that it knows are plagued with
deadly safety problems. The series is based in part on
never-before-seen information from three databases from the Army,
Navy and Air Force safety centers.
</P>
<P>
   Publication of the stories is likely to have a national impact.
The Daily News won a Pulitzer Prize in 1998 for a series uncovering
problems with the military's health-care system.
</P>
<P>
   For ``Falling From the Sky,'' CoxNet will produce a Focus page
for Sunday, Oct. 24, based on the comprehensive first day of the
series. That page will be available Friday afternoon for a download
charge at www.nytsyn.com/pageexpress.
</P>
<P>
   Those stories, and subsequent days' offerings, will also be
available on the New York Times wire. The Sunday and Monday
installments will move on Friday, Oct. 22. Subsequent stories will
move daily next week. Photos and graphics accompany each
installment.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a budget of the page and stories that Cox will offer
from Dayton. If you have questions, please contact CoxNet at
404-526-5456.

   Sunday, Oct. 24: Day 1 (This installment will be available as a
CoxNet Focus page Friday, Oct. 22. Stories and photos will also
move separately.)
</P>
<P>
   CRASH-MAIN _ The U.S. military routinely sends planes and
helicopters in the air that it knows are plagued with deadly safety
problems. An 18-month Dayton Daily News examination found that
planes keep falling from the sky for the same reasons, that
hundreds of crashes can be linked to maintenance errors, and that
the military keeps hundreds of crashes off its yearly accident
totals. (Carollo, Dayton Daily News)
</P>
<P>
   CRASH-CASE _ After an F-16 crashed into a South Carolina
neighborhood and killed a man, the Air Force assured the
congressman representing the district that the plane had been
``trouble free.'' But a Dayton Daily News investigation into the
crash found that in the months preceding the Sept. 13, 1988, crash,
the engine had been on two other F-16s and removed after pilots
reported smoke and fumes in their cockpits. (Carollo, Dayton Daily
News)
</P>
<P>
   CRASH-HOW _ The series wouldn't have been possible without the
release of three databases from the Army, Navy and Air Force safety
centers.
</P>
<P>
   CRASH-WEB _ Where to find the complete series on the web.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Oct. 25: Day 2
</P>
<P>
   CRASH-METAL _ A type of metal is in the middle of an
investigation involving a series of crashes of the Army's CH47
Chinook helicopter. The story came to light when a whistleblower,
working at a former factory in Springfield, Ohio, found flaws in a
metal used to construct gears that power the helicopter's huge
rotor blades. Investigators now suspect that seven crashes may be
linked to the metal. (Carollo, Dayton Daily News)
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Oct. 26: Day 3
</P>
<P>
   CRASH-MAINTENANCE _ The system used to maintain military
aircraft is itself broken. Hundreds of crashes can be linked to
work performed by unqualified mechanics, parts installed
improperly, engines overhauled incorrectly and inspection records
that were falsified. (Carollo, Dayton Daily News)
</P>
<P>
   CRASH-TIMMER _ A Hamilton, Ohio, man died in a helicopter that
should have been grounded. The test result that would have grounded
the craft arrived in the field three weeks after the crash.
(Carollo, Dayton Daily News)
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Oct. 27: Day 4
</P>
<P>
   CRASH-COUNT _ Since 1980, the military has omitted hundreds of
aviation incidents from its official accident rates, the statistics
used by Congress and the public to assess military safety.
(Carollo, Dayton Daily News)
</P>
<P>
   CRASH-BUTTON _ Among those not counted: the 1997 crash involving
Capt. Craig D. Button, who took off from an Air Force base in
Arizona and crashed an A-10 jet filled with bombs into a Colorado
mountain. (Carollo, Dayton Daily News)
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Oct. 28: Day 5
</P>
<P>
   CRASH-CONTRACTORS _ Private companies that do business with the
government, including large aircraft manufacturers, are protected
against many lawsuits by the government-contractor defense. The
defense means companies have limited liability even when they
produce defective products. (Carollo, Dayton Daily News)
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Oct. 29: Day 6
</P>
<P>
   CRASH-KNIGHTS _ The military's handling of the hydraulic
problems on the CH-46 Sea Knight helicopters is typical of the way
it handled numerous other mechanical failures in many types of
aircraft. Costs are weighed against risk. Some 70 incidents,
spanning more than 11 years, can be traced to hydraulic problems on
the Sea Knights. (Carollo, Dayton Daily News)
</P>
<P>
   CRASH-MCNALLY _ Anatomy of a crash. A detailed analysis of a
1994 crash in California involving a pilot named Randall McNally.
No cause was ever determined, but a Daily News examination found
that mechanics had detected problems with the plane's stabilizer
augmentor eight days before the crash. The augmentor was never
found. (Carollo, Dayton Daily News)

BIRTH CONTROL BILLBOARD TRIGGERS PROTEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: SUBS byline.)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARIANNE COSTANTINOU  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ It was a small billboard, as billboards go,
not even by the road and not even facing the right direction. But
the message was loud and clear.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes after the sign went up Tuesday afternoon inside a
fenced yard on the edge of West Oakland, it was angrily torn down.
The sign was aimed at drug-addicted women. The offer was $200 cash
if the women got birth control.
</P>
<P>
   The mission is to prevent the birth of drug-addicted babies, who
too often end up disabled and unwanted, said the sponsor of the
billboard, Barbara Harris, the founder of CRACK, or Children
Requiring A Caring Kommunity, a 2-year-old organization.
</P>
<P>
   But to the two dozen community activists and recovering mothers
who showed up at West Grand Avenue and Market Street to sing and
shout in protest, the billboard was an affront to poor black women.
</P>
<P>
   Harris, from Orange County, and her pair of supporters from
Marin County are white. The neighborhood and the demonstrators were
mostly black.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's saying `Neuter poor women,''' said Ethel Long-Scott, 45,
head of the Women's Economic Agenda Project, an organization that
deals with the politics of race and class issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are not wanted,'' she shouted to Harris and her
supporters. ``Take your money and get out of Oakland. Take that to
the rich neighborhoods.''
</P>
<P>
   But to Harris, who has adopted four black children who were
crack babies, her mission has nothing to do with class or race.
</P>
<P>
   It's about saving children she said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, 85 women in California, Illinois, Pennsylvania and
Michigan have taken her up on the $200 offer, she said. Of them, 36
were white, 34 were black and 15 Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The billboard shouldn't offend them,'' Harris, 47, said. ``The
need for the billboard should offend them.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Harris' program, the women get the $200 for any long-term
or permanent birth control. Of the 85 women, 59 got tubal
ligations, 12 got Norplant, 10 got Depo-Provera treatments and
three received IUDs. Norplant consists of capsules that are
surgically inserted under the skin in the upper arm and last about
five years.
</P>
<P>
   Depo-Provera provides birth control for three months with one
injection.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the protesters worried that women might be so tempted by
the $200 offer that they may make decisions that they would later
regret, especially in the case of tubal ligations, which are
difficult to reverse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Giving $200 to a poor woman, especially if she's
drug-addicted, is a fortune,'' Long-Scott said, who said the money
might be used to buy more drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``How are you going to give money to a drug addict? You're just
giving them a death warrant,'' said Davette Thomas, 29, of the
Women's Economic Agenda Project.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the $200 offer is appearing on billboards in Southern
California, Fresno, Sacramento, Las Vegas, Tucson, and Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   None of the locations had the same opposition as the scene in
West Oakland, Harris said.

VENERABLE BOOK OF KNOWLEDGE SEES ITS FUTURE ON THE WEB

 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Howard Halfon has 20 years of his life bound up
in the business of selling encyclopedias. But he's mostly just
watching as the latest volume in encyclopedia history is written.
</P>
<P>
   The text is about technology. Halfon isn't.
</P>
<P>
   With Encyclopaedia Britannica available on the Internet, the
231-year-old company is taking a new direction as it seeks to
reflect culture but also respect its dramatic shifts.
</P>
<P>
   Halfon, 58, of Daly City, loves encyclopedias as much as ever,
but he doesn't own a computer and really doesn't want to. The
habits of a salesman die hard: ``I might have to call it quits.
Business is getting very difficult. The printed form is becoming a
thing of the past.''
</P>
<P>
   At one time, Halfon make $50,000 per year as he relished his job
of making phone calls and personal visits to sell new sets of
Encyclopaedia Britannica, long considered the leader in its class
for authoritative accuracy. For years, house calls were a trademark
of the company, which sold books by direct mail and at
shopping-mall kiosks.
</P>
<P>
   Halfon even met his wife, Nora Casal, 51, on a sales call to her
San Francisco home in 1979. She wanted to buy a set of
encyclopedias; he sold her that and more, a set of Great Books of
the Western World.
</P>
<P>
   He also persuaded her to go dancing with him. It was the sale of
a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   But the boom days of selling encyclopedias that way _ knocking
on the doors of America's blue-collar families, inviting a customer
to flip through pages and fill out order forms on a coffee table _
have faded.
</P>
<P>
   And over the past decade, Halfon has felt his relevance slipping
away. He still sells encyclopedias as an independent distributor,
but he doesn't sell Britannica. He had no choice but to discontinue
the brand in 1996 when the company axed its door-to-door sales in
favor of telephone and Internet sales.
</P>
<P>
   Encyclopaedia Britannica has Halfon one more reason to feel like
a dinosaur in a high-tech world.
</P>
<P>
   The company announced Tuesday that its 32 volumes of the latest
Britannica wisdom and research are accessible on the Internet at
www.britannica.com. However, the company still sells $5 monthly
subscriptions for an Internet site (www.eb.com) that offers more
features and options.
</P>
<P>
   Britannica said it hopes to make money from the advertisements
on its free site after luring people there with the publisher's
reputation for quality. The company said it will spend about $35
million over the next year to advertise its site.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Britannica's belated but aggressive move into
electronic distribution _ including its CD-ROM sales _ just might
work toward reviving the company's profits. And Britannica admits
it needs an infusion of revenue. Don Yannias, chief executive of
Britannica.com, acknowledged that sales of print volumes have
declined steadily, leaving the company looking for newer, more
``now'' outlets.
</P>
<P>
   The same can be said for other encyclopedia publishers, but
Britannica, once a leader, lost ground as competitors more deftly
navigated a Web-crazy world.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, for instance, encyclopedia publisher Funk &AMP; Wagnalls
teamed up with Microsoft _ which Britannica had spurned _ to
produce a colorful, multimedia CD-ROM encyclopedia. Britannica
stutter-stepped with a weaker, graphics-challenged version a year
later.
</P>
<P>
   Then Switzerland-based investor Jacob Safra bought Britannica in
1996, and the company pushed hard toward the electronic market.
Soon CD-ROM sales were accounting for the bulk of revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is as momentous a change as when we moved from England to
Chicago 75 years ago,'' Kent Devereaux, senior vice president of
product development and editorial on the digital side of
Britannica, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two things come out of what we are doing: We are embracing the
future. We intend to be able to deliver trusted, aggregated,
intelligent information and content to users by any means
necessary, not only on the Internet, but down the road into
wireless Palm Pilot applications and WebTV.''
</P>
<P>
   This is no longer a business in which an asphalt-walking
salesman is likely to land a life-changing date.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's probably my best experience with Britannica: I met my
wonderful wife,'' Halfon said. Then he added, ``No more getting
married through (sales) leads with Britannica.''
</P>
<P>
   Britannica's newly renovated Web site, www.britannica.com, was
quickly overloaded with millions of users, a problem the company
said it planned to fix soon.
</P>
<P>
   The news is especially promising for computer users who want to
tap up-to-date, reliable research sources without leaving home,
said Dennis Maness, manager of General Collections at the San
Francisco Public Library and a self-described encyclopedia fanatic.
</P>
<P>
   Since childhood, he has enjoyed sitting down with a thick
encyclopedia volume and reading it, page after page, like a regular
book.
</P>
<P>
   He insists that the same opportunity for accidentally
discovering new and fascinating information _ what Maness calls
``the serendipity'' effect _ exists in the on-line encyclopedia.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, he believes actual books will maintain their relevance
in a universe of CD-ROMS and Internet sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with on-line (books) is they're not very
portable,'' Maness said. ``You can't take it to your table and read
it. You can't prop it up in bed.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In its best years, Britannica collected about $650 million in
revenues and employed about 3,500 people, including salespeople
like Halfon. The work force now is at about 350.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it intends to continue selling its bound
volumes, which cost about $1,250 a set. But the future of the books
depends on the company's Internet-related success, a spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Among Halfon's former peers in encyclopedia sales during the
'70s and '80s, some pulled in a quarter-million dollars in profits
during their best years as district managers. But they have moved
on, Halfon said. ``Most of the people are out of the business now.
They're doing other things.
</P>
<P>
   ``But life is change. Now I have to march on to a different
avenue of earning a living.''

 &HT;    SUGAR GROWERS WATCH WARILY AS NEW TRADE TALKS OPEN
 &HT;    760&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories
for release Sunday, Oct. 24.
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the world prepares for a new round of trade
talks next month in Seattle, the producers of sugar and the users
of sugar are hoping for radically different outcomes.
</P>
<P>
   American sugar growers want to make sure the so-called
Millennium Round, which begins Nov. 30 and is expected to last
three years, doesn't open the door to greater imports of
foreign-grown sugar.
</P>
<P>
   American sugar users would love to see the door thrown open,
because the price of surplus sugar on the world market is about 6.7
cents per pound, while the price of American sugar is about 19.4
cents, a drop of about 3 cents in the past few months.
</P>
<P>
   Leading up to the opening session, the American position has
been to preserve existing sugar protections.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have told sugar growers and producers ...that we would not
sacrifice the sugar growers or any other parts of agriculture at
this round, and certainly, they would not be treated in any kind of
disproportionately negative way,'' Agriculture Secretary Dan
Glickman said at a recent White House briefing on the upcoming
trade talks.
</P>
<P>
   But sugar growers worry that the Clinton administration, which
has made the export of U.S. agricultural products a top priority,
may ultimately use sugar as a bargaining chip.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to get sacrificed on the altar of free trade in
the trade round,'' said Dalton Yancey, Washington representative of
the Florida Sugar Cane League and other sugar consortiums. ``We
don't want to be split off. We're an integral part of American
agriculture.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue is one of ``fair trade'' versus ``free trade.'' While
the two terms seem similar, there is a world of difference in the
eyes of growers.
</P>
<P>
   For them, ``free trade'' means goods can flow across borders
unimpeded by tariffs. They say such a situation would be unfair to
American sugar because much of the foreign sugar is subsidized by
foreign governments, protected by government purchasing boards, or
produced under conditions that don't meet the stringent pollution
and labor standards met by U.S. growers.
</P>
<P>
   Growers prefer the term ``fair trade,'' which means tariffs are
imposed on foreign sugar to offset the advantages under which the
crop is grown or marketed.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. growers say the world market price is illusory. They note
that pound for pound, sugar is cheaper in the United States than in
most countries which produce the excess sugar sold on the world
market. For example, the price of a pound of sugar is about 71
cents in France, compared to about 41 cents in America.
</P>
<P>
   Judy C. Sanchez, director of corporate communications for U.S.
Sugar Corp., said Europe has distorted the world sugar market by
dumping about 6 million tons a year on the market at a time when
their own citizens pay far more than Americans for sugar.
</P>
<P>
   Sugar users prefer the concept of free trade, which would give
them access to sugar at far lower prices than they pay
domestically.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes no economic sense to have U.S. sugar prices that are
five times the world price,'' said Sarah Fogarty, senior manager
for international trade with the Grocery Manufacturers' of America.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Baskin, a spokesman for Atlanta-based Coca-Cola Co., said
that for his firm this issue is not just the cost of sugar _ he
noted that most American-made soft drinks use corn fructose as a
sweetener _ but also the implications of trade protectionism.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe in free trade with a reduction of market barriers
to entry across the world,'' Baskin said. ``Coca-Cola does business
in about 200 countries worldwide, so obviously you can see the
reason why free trade and open markets are important to us.''
</P>
<P>
   For Ardis Hammock, who runs 650-acre Frierson Farm in Glades
County, Fla., with her husband, Alan, and his elderly relatives,
the trade talks may mean the difference between a future of farming
or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``These negotiators don't have a clue that with a stroke of a
pen they can affect a whole industry,'' said Hammock, who serves on
the presidential Agricultural Trade Advisory Council.
</P>
<P>
   Hammock and her 15-year-old daughter, Sarah, attended a hearing
this year in Winter Haven to discuss the U.S. position on sugar in
the upcoming trade round.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them: 'You're not trading away our crop, you're trading
away her future,' `` Hammock said. ``You shouldn't sell out the
America farmer to bankroll the foreign farmer.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   But while American farmers see danger in the trade talks,
American food manufacturers _ particularly cake, candy and soft
drink companies _ see a golden opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Nedelman, a spokesman for the Coalition for Sugar Reform,
an umbrella group of consumer groups, government watchdog groups
and food industries, said he hopes U.S. trade negotiators play the
sugar card wisely.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. is not going to give the U.S. sugar program away, we
hope they will negotiate it away for freer agricultural trade,''
Nedelman said. ``It's impossible for the United States to realize
its agricultural trade goals with the U.S. sugar policy intact.''
</P>
<P>
   What makes sugar so different from other agricultural products
is that the United States is a net importer of sugar. Most other
crops are produced in higher quantities than can be sold
domestically. For those crops to thrive, American farmers need
greater access to foreign markets. That's a top priority of the
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, opening the American market to increased sugar
exports is a big priority for other countries and regions, such as
Australia, Brazil and the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sugar is an important issue for us,'' said Paul Morris,
minister counselor for agriculture in the Australian Embassy.
``We'd like to see a total removal or significant (reduction) in
the quota tariff rate.''
</P>
<P>
   While the agriculture community is united going into the talks,
sugar users hope the negotiations will drive a wedge between sugar
growers and other farmers. A recent letter from the sugar users and
sugar refiners addressed to the agriculture community tried to do
just that.
</P>
<P>
   Sugar users hope a split in the agriculture community will play
out in Congress, which has repeatedly rejected efforts to kill the
sugar program. The program sets limits on imports in order to
preserve a threshold price for domestic sugar.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope they (U.S. trade negotiators) will come back from
Seattle and tell the agriculture community and Congress, 'we're
getting killed,' `` Nedelman said.

OUR DWINDLING SUPPLY OF DUMPLINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART CHAPMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As closely as I can figure _ using less-than-precise
calculations _ we have about 20 or 10 years left before we will be
completely out of chicken and dumplings.
</P>
<P>
   I have made this evaluation by stopping women, most of whom were
completely unknown to me _ and asking them if they knew how to make
the thick, rich dish.
</P>
<P>
   The answer, which often came after a frightened look, was almost
always the same. They didn't know how to make the dish, but their
mothers did. But, they would quickly add, their mothers didn't make
as good a chicken and dumplings as their grandmothers did.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother makes chicken and dumplings,'' one woman said. ``But
when she wants chicken and dumplings, she goes to my grandmother's
house.''
</P>
<P>
   I have since found that the number of chicken-and-dumpling
recipes is directly proportionate to the number of grandmothers.
When all of today's grandmothers are gone, there will be no more
recipes.
</P>
<P>
   Chicken and dumplings will then come only in a can, and our
children will never know that the dish was concocted as a way to
serve a really tough bird, stewed for hours in a roiling broth.
</P>
<P>
   To extend it so it could feed the whole family a couple of
times, the cook then added a dough mixture and called it dumplings.
</P>
<P>
   I have found that some people put vegetables in their chicken
and dumplings, but for the most part, that has always been done the
day after the dish was first served.
</P>
<P>
   If there was any left, the next step would be to add peas and
carrots and a few potatoes and maybe some celery, then cover the
whole thing with biscuits and bake in the oven. Voila, chicken
potpie _ a completely different meal.
</P>
<P>
   There are several variations on chicken and dumplings, and there
is really nothing that is strictly taboo. It is perfectly fine to
use cans of cream of mushroom and cream of chicken soups in the
recipes. Some folks use straight sour cream to add flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Many recipes call for chicken bouillon cubes to enrich the
broth. I admit I cheat. Instead of boiling the chicken, I prefer to
cook it in a pressure cooker. It takes less liquid, but the liquid
that's left is rich in flavor and makes a superior broth. Just
refrigerate overnight and remove the separated fat.
</P>
<P>
   Thickening is also a matter of choice. A little of the broth
mixed with flour into a slurry works fine. For just a bit more
taste and to add a little sheen to the dish, a couple of
tablespoons of flour creamed with an equal amount of butter is
perfect.
</P>
<P>
   I can't account for the loss in popularity of chicken and
dumplings. Perhaps the dish will re-emerge someday with a fancier
name _ sort of the way cornmeal mush made a comeback as polenta.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps people just got tired of haggling over whether to use
the puffy, ball-like dumplings or the thin, denser strips. Maybe
there just aren't that many tough old birds that need boiling
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the case, I'd like to see the dish make a comeback.
Chicken and dumplings is certainly a comfort food. And it is an
easy dish to make. Just ask your grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   Here are a couple of simple recipes, offered in the hope of
keeping the dish alive. They were taken from soiled index cards and
anonymous scraps of paper. If you like them, claim them as your
own.
</P>
<P>
   Note: If you are scared away by the thought of making dumplings
from scratch, just buy a can of refrigerated biscuits, cut the
biscuits into smaller pieces and drop into boiling broth.

SPOTLIGHT ON ... JACQUES PEPIN 
 

</HEADLINE>
 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  By NATALIE HAUGHTON 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
 
  
Age:  63.  
Profession:  Pepin, a French-trained chef, has written 20
cookbooks, including ``Cooking at Home'' with Julia Child. He is
also the dean of special programs at the French Culinary Institute
in New York, a cooking teacher, food columnist and television
cooking show host. From 1956 to 1958, he was the personal chef to
three French heads of state, including Charles de Gaulle.  
Hometown:  Bourg-en-Bresse, France (near Lyon).  
Cooking style:  Although Pepin said that journalists have described
his cooking in a variety of ways over the years, he describes
himself as a purely American cook. ``When my mother, who is 84 and
was a restaurant chef (his parents owned Le Pelican restaurant in
France), comes to visit me at my home in Madison, Conn., and I cook
for her, she says my cooking is not French.'' Pepin has lived in
the United States for 40 years.  
Most popular dishes he makes:  Roast chicken, leek soup, pate,
paella.  
Favorite foods:  Fish, pasta, meat, rice, vegetables, soup.  
Favorite junk food:  Burger King french fries and his own
hamburgers.  
Foods he dislikes:  Marsmallows. ``Also, I'm not much into gooey
sweets.''  
Secret food passion:  Dark, bittersweet chocolate.  
Favorite kitchen gadget:  His own hands. He uses them as a
strainer, crusher or whatever.  
Pet peeve:  ``People who pick at the food on your plate; and people
who shove stuff in your mouth from their own plate because they
think you should taste everything. I don't like people who are too
intense and don't enjoy the moment.''  
Favorite cookbook:  One by Georges Auguste Escoffier, famous French
chef, and ``LaRousse Gastronomique.''  
Ideal vacation:  Guadeloupe in the Caribbean, where he spends three
weeks in January drinking rum, playing bocce (ball), swimming,
eating and sleeping.  
Favorite restaurant:  Currently Spago, Beverly Hills.  
Favorite thing to cook and   eat:  Soup, roast or something made
from what's in his vegetable and herb garden.  
What does he do when not cooking?:  Goes mushrooming. He picks 300
pounds of 29 varieties of mushrooms each summer. He also reads,
swims and paints. (There's currently a show of his paintings in New
York.)  
If he couldn't be a chef or cookbook author, what would he be?:  A
butcher or a surgeon.  
Worst kitchen disaster:  A number of years ago, he did a souffle
demonstration in San Diego during a food show. He put the souffles
in the oven to bake and vacated the stage while others cooked. When
he came back 30 minutes later, he discovered the oven was set on
self-cleaning (not baking) and the temperature inside was 750
degrees F. ``I have never seen such a black (and burned) souffle. I
received a standing ovation _ everyone was very happy.''  
If he could dine with anyone (current or historical) who would it
be?:  Albert Camus.  
Most memorable meal:  ``It has to do with family and remembrance _
and the place, time, memories _ not just the food.''  
The worst part of being a chef is:  Doing the dishes.

Jacques Pepin and Julia child celebrate their ``Cooking at Home''
book and PBS series at a KCET fund-raiser. 
 
 
By NATALIE HAUGHTON 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Two of the world's culinary legends, Julia Child
and Jacques Pepin, have teamed up this season to cook on public
television, a place where they feel right at home, individually or
together, and where they have been cooking cumulatively for more
than 50 years _ and influencing the way Americans cook. The duo _
whose friendship dates back some 40 years to when they met in New
York _ was in town recently (on Child's old stomping grounds) at a
fund-raising dinner for KCET and to tout the series (it airs on
KCET in Los Angeles at 11 a.m. Saturdays) and its companion
cookbook, ``Julia and Jacques: Cooking at Home'' (Alfred A. Knopf;
$40).
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 100 people attending the gourmet event hosted by the
Ritz-Carlton, Huntington Hotel &AMP; Spa in Pasadena were serious Child
and Pepin worshipers and die-hard fans. They had flocked to the
$200-a-plate dinner to get a chance to meet and chat with their
heroes and to dine on some of the creations from their new book.
They were served Julia's Leek and Potato Soup, Salmon in Potato
Case with Tomato Coulis, Steak Au Poivre and Pears in Chocolate
Sauce.
</P>
<P>
   The new show was inspired by the success of Child's and Pepin's
two-hour PBS ``Cooking in Concert'' special. But a novel approach,
largely improvised, was used this time around. Filmed in the
kitchen of Child's old Victorian house in Cambridge, Mass., Child
and Pepin cooked without any recipes or cookbook _ just a counter
filled with an array of ingredients appropriate to a theme for the
show (discussed in advance), such as poultry, fish, salads and so
forth. There was no script and no rehearsals.
</P>
<P>
   Geoffrey Drummond, whose A La Carte Communications has filmed
some of Child's other shows, agreed to do the series. Two shows
(each filming took about two hours and was then edited down to 27
1/2 minutes for the series) were filmed daily for 15 to 17 days
straight, noted Drummond. Working this way posed some problems for
camera operators and producers, but Child and Pepin favored their
new-found freedom.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to work more the way it is when you're cooking at
home,'' said Pepin. ``It was almost like cooking from the market.''
Child and Pepin just cooked together, chatted, chopped, sliced and
kept bantering.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, if they decided to do roast chicken, they
improvised the creation _ tasting throughout and making adjustments
as they went along. ``Sometimes we created two different chicken
dishes; other times we worked together on just one,'' noted Child.
</P>
<P>
   What you see at the end of the show is the actual dish they
created and worked on _ not a completely different one cooked just
for viewing, as is commonplace on other television shows where time
is limited.
</P>
<P>
   ``We each had our own points of view and comments about specific
foods and ways of doing things,'' continued Pepin. ``We had our
little disagreements _ I like kosher salt, she doesn't; I like
black pepper, she likes white pepper. ``But on the whole, we agreed
as to what is important: taste over appearance, simplicity in
recipes, using the proper techniques, using the best-quality
ingredients, following the seasons, keeping an open mind to new
food preparations and, of course, sharing both wine and food with
family and friends,'' said Pepin. ``We don't care about nutrients;
we care about taste,'' chimed in Child, adding that the show is
geared to people who like to cook. So how did the cookbook come
about? Writer David Nussbaum had the difficult task of
extrapolating the recipes created during the tapings and organizing
them into something that would make sense to the reader.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we both want to show in the programs and in the book is
our approach to cooking,'' said Child. ``We didn't try to be
French. We cooked dishes we like to cook and eat and that our
family and friends like _ and we didn't try to do everything. We
drank lots of wine, discussed cooking, tasted and argued,'' said
Child jokingly in her familiar, breathy voice.
</P>
<P>
   It was much more free-form, relaxed and easier than when you
have to worry about the time element (as is usually the case in
taped 30-minute shows with no editing), when some guy is holding up
a sign noting that you have 2{ minutes left, and you have to
frantically rush to finish the dish and present it on camera, added
Pepin.
</P>
<P>
   Drummond said there was continually an element of surprise for
Child and Pepin and for the 25 people working on the show, and
Pepin agreed: ``It was really an adventure in a way, as we were not
sure when we tasted the final dish if we'd like it,'' said the
chef.
</P>
<P>
   ``Food is not only our business but our greatest pleasure _ and
we think its preparation should be a joyful occupation,''
emphasized Child.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing is written in stone,'' said Pepin. ``We are trying to
free people of the structure and discipline of written recipes.''
Be flexible. If you run out of something when you're making a
recipe, substitute or improvise.
</P>
<P>
   And like home cooks everywhere, Child and Pepin use canned or
convenience foods such as canned tuna, chicken broth, tomatoes and
the like. ``The proof of the pudding is in the eating,'' said
Pepin, ``and if it is good, however you did it is OK.'' For
instance, ``Who cares if the bread you serve is homemade, as long
as it is good.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked _ during a question-and-answer session at the dinner
_ about the changes in American cooking and eating, Child recalled
that when she started out writing cookbooks and cooking on
television in the '60s, American tastes favored gelatin salad molds
filled with bananas, diced marshmallows and grapes served on
iceberg lettuce _ and ``horrible food'' like those little
individual snowball coconut cakes. Pepin noted that when he came to
America more than 40 years ago, he had to go to special stores to
buy white mushrooms. ``There were no shallots, leeks, special
vinegars or oils in the markets _ it was another world.''
</P>
<P>
   As for trends in the year 2000 and beyond, Child hopes that more
people will cook more real foodie-type food and eat together. ``You
don't have to pig out on anything.'' Opt for moderation (have a bit
of everything), small helpings, no stacking _ and exercise, she
advised. ``If you're not eating well, you're not satisfied.''
</P>
<P>
   Pepin added, there is ``extraordinary food in this country now _
maybe the best food in the world.'' And he foresees an ethnic
cauldron brewing with so many chefs from different parts of the
world now in this country. The future will bring more fusion
cooking _ with different themes from different countries, he
predicted.

JULIA'S BASIC 
LEEK AND POTATO SOUP 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the home soup maker, the marriage of leeks and potatoes is a
heavenly one. Cooked together in broth or water just until tender,
with the simplest seasoning, the two unassuming vegetables have an
affinity, yielding a thick, satisfying soup of harmonious flavors
and hearty textures.
</P>
<P>
   You can serve leek-and-potato soup straight from the pot with
the vegetables in coarse chunks or you may change the soup's
texture and appearance by mashing, straining or pureeing it. Or
refrigerate, to serve chilled, with a bit of cream, as the famed
vichyssoise.
</P>
<P>
   This recipe uses water and a slight thickening of flour and
butter. It yields 2 quarts of delicious soup. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
2 tablespoons butter &QL; 
3 cups sliced leeks, white and palest green, trimmed and rinsed
(from 12 ounces untrimmed leeks) &QL; 
1 1/2 cups sliced onions (about 6 ounces OR 2 medium onions) &QL; 
2 tablespoons flour &QL; 
6 cups water &QL; 
4 cups peeled, diced potatoes, preferably russets, cut into 2-inch
chunks (about 1 1/2 pounds) &QL; 
1 1/2 teaspoons salt OR to taste &QL; 
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground white pepper OR to taste
</P>
<P>
   Melt butter in a heavy 3- or 4-quart saucepan over moderate
heat. Stir in leek and onion pieces to coat with butter; cover pan
and reduce heat. Cook slowly, stirring occasionally, 10 to 15
minutes, until vegetables are very soft but not colored. Uncover,
sprinkle on flour, stir to distribute well and cook 2 minutes over
moderate heat. Remove from heat and let cool for a moment.
</P>
<P>
   Then, stirring continually, gradually pour in 1 1/2 cups water
and bring to a simmer. When liquid is smooth and starts to thicken,
stir in rest of water, then add potatoes and season with salt and
pepper. Quickly heat soup to a gentle boil, cover pan and reduce
heat. Simmer about 20 minutes, until potatoes are tender. Correct
seasonings.
</P>
<P>
   Serve soup as is or mash, blend or puree soup to desired
consistency and adjust seasonings. Garnish soup with sour cream,
chopped fresh chives or buttered croutons.
</P>
<P>
   To store soup, let cool uncovered, then refrigerate or freeze.
Makes 2 quarts.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL; 
JACQUES' CROQUE MADAME &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
1 tablespoon soft butter OR more if needed &QL; 
2 slices home-style white bread &QL; 
2 OR more slices Swiss cheese (such as Gruyere OR Emmentaler),
about 1/8-inch thick (enough to cover both bread slices) &QL; 
Several slices cooked chicken, about 1/8-inch thick (enough to
cover one bread slice) &QL; 
1 teaspoon chopped fresh chives &QL; 
Few dashes Tabasco sauce (optional)
</P>
<P>
   Spread a thin layer of soft butter on one side only of both
bread slices, then cover buttered sides neatly with a layer of
cheese. Arrange a layer of chicken on one bread slice and sprinkle
on chives and a few dashes Tabasco. Flip other piece of bread over
on top (cheese inside), press together and spread more butter on
outsides of sandwich, coating slices evenly. Lay assembled sandwich
in a shallow-rimmed baking dish and prepare others in same way.
</P>
<P>
   Bake in preheated 400-degree oven 10 minutes or so, until bottom
side is crisp and golden. Flip over and bake for about 5 minutes
more, until second side is also well toasted.
</P>
<P>
   Serve hot. For appetizer portions, trim off crusts and cut each
sandwich diagonally into 4 small triangles. Makes 1 sandwich. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR;  &QL; 
JULIA'S LEMON-OIL DRESSING &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
1 tablespoon minced shallots OR green onions &QL; 
2 teaspoons Dijon-style prepared mustard &QL; 
2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice &QL; 
About 1/4 teaspoon salt OR more to taste &QL; 
Freshly ground black pepper to taste &QL; 
1/2 cup excellent olive oil
</P>
<P>
   Put minced green onions, mustard, lemon juice, salt and pepper
in a small mixing bowl and whisk until well blended.
</P>
<P>
   Pour in oil slowly, in droplets at first and then in a thin
stream, whisking constantly until oil has been emulsified and
dressing has thickened. Taste and adjust seasonings. Use
immediately; if dressing separates while standing, whisk to blend.
Use to dress salads. Makes about 2/3 cup. &UR;  &QL;

 &UR;  &QL; 
JACQUES' FRENCH POTATO SALAD &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
2 pounds fingerling potatoes OR other small waxy potatoes &QL; 
Water &QL; 
1/2 cup OR so extra-virgin olive oil &QL; 
1/2 cup 1/4-inch slices green onion, green and white parts &QL; 
1/2 cup chopped white OR yellow onion &QL; 
3 cloves garlic, mashed and coarsely chopped (1 1/2 teaspoons) &QL; 
1/3 cup white wine &QL; 
1 1/2 tablespoons Dijon-style mustard &QL; 
2 to 3 tablespoons chopped chives &QL; 
2 tablespoons OR more coarsely chopped fresh greens OR purple
basil, fresh tarragon OR parsley &QL; 
1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more if need &QL; 
1/2 teaspoon freshly cracked black pepper (coarse), plus more if
needed &QL; 
Large radicchio leaves, about 6, from outside of head &QL; 
1 or 2 hard-cooked eggs, coarsely chopped &QL; 
Chopped fresh parsley
</P>
<P>
   Scrub potatoes and put whole in a saucepan with water to cover
by 1/2 inch. Bring water to a boil, reduce heat and cook potatoes
gently until just tender when pierced with a sharp knife. Drain
immediately and let cool slightly. (Scrape skin from cooked
potatoes, if desired, as soon as they can be handled. For a
decorative look with fingerlings, scrape off only a band of skin,
about 1/2-inch thick, all around long sides of potato.)
</P>
<P>
   Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a small saute pan. When hot, add
green onions and onion, toss to coat well and cook about 1 minute

<P>
   Slice potatoes while still warm, cutting them crosswise into
1/2-inch sections. Put pieces in a large mixing bowl, pour wine and
3 or 4 tablespoons olive oil over them, and toss gently to
distribute. Add warm vegetables from pan, mustard, chives, chopped
herbs, salt and pepper, and gently fold all together, mixing well
but not crushing potatoes. Taste salad and add more seasonings as
you like.
</P>
<P>
   Serve potatoes warm (no colder than room temperature). Arrange
large radicchio leaves in a close circle on serving platter, with
curved insides up, to form a rough bowl. Spoon potato salad inside
leaves, sprinkle chopped egg around edges and parsley over top.
Makes 6 cups, 4 to 6 servings.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL; 
CHOCOLATE POTS DE CREME &QC; 
 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The term ``pot de creme'' refers both to a soft-baked custard
and to the small ceramic pots, often with lids, that they are baked
in. If you don't have authentic ``petits pots de creme,'' which
only hold 1/3 cup or so, use 4-ounce ramekins without a cover.
</P>
<P>
   The custard for this recipe uses the same egg-yolk-and-cream
base as for creme brulee, but here it is poured steaming hot over
bitter chocolate and stirred until smooth. You can use vanilla and
orange peel or add other flavors, like coffee. The custard will be
quite soft when it comes out of the oven after only 20 minutes or
so, but will set to a luscious creamy consistency in the
refrigerator. Enjoy it well chilled.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
4 ounces unsweetened chocolate, chopped into small pieces &QL; 
2 cups heavy whipping cream &QL; 
1 teaspoon grated orange peel (optional) &QL; 
4 large egg yolks &QL; 
1/3 cup sugar &QL; 
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla
</P>
<P>
   Put chopped chocolate in a large measuring cup or a mixing bowl
and set a sieve on top. Pour cream into a medium saucepan, add
orange peel and bring to a simmer, then remove from heat. Steep 5
minutes, covered, off heat.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, whisk yolks in a bowl, adding sugar gradually.
Continue whisking for a minute or more, until yolks are pale
yellow, thick and form a ribbon when dropped from whisk.
</P>
<P>
   By driblets, pour hot cream into yolks, stirring (not beating)
with whisk, until evenly blended. Immediately pour this custard
through the sieve over chocolate pieces, removing any coagulated
bits of eggs and stir gently with a large spoon to melt chocolate
and blend into custard. Stir in vanilla. Skim off surface bubbles.
</P>
<P>
   Arrange 6 (4-ounce) ramekins OR 8 petits pots de creme in a
baking pan. Fill each with 1/2 cup custard (less for petits pots)
and spoon off any foam or bubbles on surface. Cover cups if you
have small lids for them. Set baking pan in oven and pour in hot
water to come halfway up ramekins.
</P>
<P>
   Bake custards in preheated 350-degree oven about 25 minutes or
until tops are just set (if baked uncovered). The custard will

<P>
   After tucking our toddler into bed one recent evening, my
exhausted husband commented, ``I remember what I was doing 30 years
ago tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Since I can barely remember what I was doing 30 minutes ago,
this caught my attention. ``What?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, 30 years last night, actually. October 15, 1969. I was
at a big protest of the Vietnam War in Washington. A month later,
another protest. After that, everything broke loose.''
</P>
<P>
   Americans remember 1969 for two events: Neil Armstrong walking
on the moon and Woodstock. But 1969 was also a crucible for the
antiwar movement.
</P>
<P>
   Although people had protested the war throughout the decade, by
1969 antiwar sentiment became increasingly difficult to ignore. The
largest cohort of baby-boomers turned eighteen; Richard Nixon had
just taken office. The clash between protesters and establishment
could no longer be avoided.
</P>
<P>
   The American experience of Vietnam is as varied as the memories
of those who lived through it. Politicians, soldiers, reporters,
parents, college students, schoolchildren. North and South; black
and white and brown; rich and poor. Whether or not one served in
Vietnam, we all fought the war together. It was waged on Asian
battlefields, American campuses and the evening news.
</P>
<P>
   And in church.
</P>
<P>
   Few events have transformed American religion as did the Vietnam
War. And few have been more difficult to analyze.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, the Yale historian Sydney Ahlstrom wrote of the times,
``The sharp crescendo of social strife seemed to demonstrate that
the time-honored structures of American church life were irrelevant
to the country's actual condition-- churchgoing America came to be
regardedas an obstacle to change.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in the 1970s, traditional religion seemed completely
outmoded, a relic of an earlier, more innocent age. God appeared
dead. One more casualty of the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, the late University of California professor Walter
Capps identified two major religious trends resulting from
Vietnam-- the ``revitalization of conservative religion'' and ``the
new spirituality.'' Pent-up patriotism fuelled a backlash against
the 60s radicalism and formed the basis for the religious right.
People went back to church. But they did not return to traditional
ones. Instead, they joined conservative churches in droves,places
that enshrined romanticized, pre-Vietnam views of family and
country.
</P>
<P>
   Capps described ``the new spirituality'' as ``the rise of
contemplative religion, the daily practice of meditationand even
the new and perceptibly strong interest in mysticism.'' This ``new
spirituality'' was more concerned with self than community-- ``an
appropriate response'' since traditional community had broken down.
</P>
<P>
   With older structures in chaos, a diffuse interest in
spirituality replaced institutional religion. God was not dead. God
had only changed his address.
</P>
<P>
   Both impulses were aspects of the American soul. One honored
tradition, the Bible, God and country; the other reflected
individualism, experimentation, ambiguity and questioning. These
differing religious interpretations of Vietnam led to a 20-year
cultural war-- ``a quarrel that has not yet been resolved'' at the
time Capps wrote.
</P>
<P>
   But we are 30 yearsand a generationaway from 1969. Despite
persistent bickering by some politicians and pundits, the quarrel
has been largely resolved. It was resolved by default and
demographics, by an aging baby-boom generation and the
coming-of-age of their own children, Generation X. For the most
part, these two groups have embraced some form of the ``new
spirituality.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, it looked as if the religious right's patriotic
``return to normalcy'' would prevail. It has not. Conservative
evangelicals have realized that they are a distinct minority-- a
large one but still a minoritywhose views do not resonate with
contemporary values and opinions on religion.
</P>
<P>
   Even the venerable evangelical magazine ``Christianity Today''
recently posed the question, ``Is the Religious Right Dead?''
</P>
<P>
   The ``new spirituality'' of the Vietnam era has become
mainstream. Contemplative, personal, mystical, eclectic. Some
traditional religious institutions -- Ahlstrom's ``irrelevant''
ones-- have adapted this ethos and have begun to experience new
growth. The baby-boomers, so shaped by the first wave of ``new
spirituality,'' now lead America's churches and synagogues. They
are quietly reforming the nature of the institutions they once
rejected.
</P>
<P>
   But much of American spirituality remains outside institutions.
The powerful impulses toward alternative religious expression and
mystical spirituality are consumer-oriented, Web-accessible, and
seeker-friendly.
</P>
<P>
   The pull is so strong, and the new consensus around these values
so real, that most younger Americans imbibe this spirit. The break
with the past, even among very conservative religious people, is
surprisingly complete.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years. A generation. Gone is traditional American
religion. We left it in the rice paddies of Vietnamor maybe on the
Mall in Washington one long-ago autumn.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Home offices usually start as a makeshift workstation in a
little-used corner of the house. As the workload increases, so does
the demand for a larger and more efficient office.
</P>
<P>
   Creating an efficient home office requires planning. Before
adding an office to your home, check the local zoning laws to see
if there are any restrictions for a home-based business. Then
evaluate your business operation so you can determine the amount of
work space you need. Depending upon your business, you may need as
many as five separate areas _ computer, production, administrative,
meeting and storage _ to create an efficient office.
</P>
<P>
   If the computer is an important part of your operation, make it
the focal point of your plan and be sure to allow enough space for
this area so you can work comfortably without feeling cramped.
There should be ample space for the computer, keyboard, monitor and
printer and any additional hardware (like a scanner or color
printer) you may add in the future. Also plan for worktables to
hold reference materials that you might use when working at the
computer.
</P>
<P>
   The production area is the place you actually make your product.
For home offices where the entire product _ reports, articles,
spreadsheets _ is generated on the computer, there would be no need
for a separate area. But some businesses require working space for
product drafting, manufacture or assembly.
</P>
<P>
   The administrative area is the space set aside for running the
business -- opening mail, making out invoices, bookkeeping and
making bank deposits. It is the best area to situate office
machines like the copier, fax and answering machines.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, plan for a storage area to hold reference materials,
records and supplies. You may want to divide this area into two
spaces. One area for long- term storage of items that you use
occasionally (this may be away from the immediate work area in the
garage or attic), and another close by the production area for
records and materials that you have to retrieve on a daily basis.
</P>
<P>
   Once you have an idea of the amount of space you need, you can
start looking in your house for possible locations. The most likely
sites for a home office are a spare bedroom, garage, family room,
attic or basement. Each has advantages and disadvantages.
</P>
<P>
   A spare bedroom is a good choice because it is a finished room
with electrical outlets and heating fixtures already in place. In
addition, spare bedrooms have windows for light and ventilation.
The spare bedroom may not be a good choice if you have clients
visiting because you will have to bring them through the living
area in the house to get to your office. One solution may be to
install a separate door from the outside directly to the room.
</P>
<P>
   One advantage to using the garage as an office is that it is
away from the rest of the house. The work area will be relatively
isolated with no distractions from the living section. However,
most garages are unfinished. The floor and walls will have to be
insulated, and electrical power and air-conditioning and heating
units will be needed.
</P>
<P>
   The family room is often a good choice for an office. It is
already finished and supplied with electrical power, heating and
air-conditioning. In addition, most family rooms are situated away
from the living quarters with a separate entrance.
</P>
<P>
   Although the attic is relatively isolated from the rest of the
household, it is usually accessible only by going through the
living quarters. The major problem with attics is that they are
often very hot in the summer and cold in the winter. Installing
insulation will help, but utility bills are apt to be high. In
addition, attics do not have a lot of working space. Much of the
floor space is under the eaves, so it can only be used as storage
area.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways an unfinished basement is like the garage; it is
away from the living quarters and it needs a finished ceiling,
walls and a floor. It is relatively easy to add additional power
outlets and heating to a basement office because it is near the
main service panel and furnace. The main disadvantage to a basement
location is that it is apt to be cold in the winter and humid in
the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Once you have chosen the area, the next step is to design a
functional workstation arrangement on paper. This will be featured
next week.

 &HT;    CYBERPORN EMERGES AS TOP NET CONCERN
 &HT;    Moving in Washington (w) and Financial (f) categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Americans remain deeply concerned about the need to
protect children from sexually explicit material on the Internet,
but they do not want the government to limit access to cyberporn,
according to a new broad study released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The research report, from the National Issues Forums Institute
and the Kettering Foundation, offered fresh insights into public
attitudes based on some 60 lengthy civic meetings held recently in
19 states, at which participants reflected on a host of
Internet-related matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``This analysis shouldn't be confused with poll results, which
are a snapshot of public opinion at a given point in time,'' said
John Doble, whose research firm interpreted the results for the two
non-partisan and non-profit sponsors. ``Nor,'' Doble added,
``should such forums be confused with focus groups, in which
professional moderators, working from a tightly directed script,
interrogate respondents who receive an incentive to attend.''
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to the agendas of many policy-makers in Washington, the
forum participants failed to voice much spontaneous concern about
online hate sites, ``partly because people said they are protected
by the First Amendment and partly because participants did not see
them as presenting a clear and present danger,'' Doble said.
</P>
<P>
   As they deliberated, most people concluded that neo-Nazis and
the Ku Klux Klan should be permitted online access, so long as they
do not directly incite violence, the report said. Nor were people
widely alarmed about bomb-making sites, because, they noted, such
data is already widely available in books and libraries
</P>
<P>
   A host of other often hotly debated issues, such as Internet
gambling, cyberterrorism, and potential cyberattacks by hostile
foreign powers were scarcely mentioned. The terrorism concerns have
led the Clinton administration to develop a $1.4 billion plan to
monitor the nation's data networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are not yet blips on the public's radar screen,'' Doble
said.
</P>
<P>
   The theme that did strike home was the need to better protect
children from exposure to online pornography.
</P>
<P>
   ``More generally, many felt that the abundance of pornography on
the Net is an indication of our ethical decline, a sign of what we,
as a nation and as a global community, have come to value,'' the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, most participants opposed imposing an outright ban
on sexually explicit online material. They cited four reasons:
</P>
<P>
   Such materials are protected by constitutional freedom of
speech.
</P>
<P>
   No consensus exists about what constitutes pornography.
</P>
<P>
   The government cannot be trusted to censor wisely or well.
</P>
<P>
   As a worldwide phenomenon, the Web is virtually impossible to
control.
</P>
<P>
   As they deliberated, the forum participants favored the adoption
of improved software filters _ the online equivalent of the
so-called V-chips now being implanted in TV sets that would enable
parents to limit what comes into the home _ without limiting what
is actually online.
</P>
<P>
   Some participants noted that pornographic sites have been known
to use deception to lure people. Thus, a high school student from
Long Island described how classmates seeking information about the
Mars Pathfinder had navigated to a porn site designed to snare
surfers intending to reach NASA's Web page.
</P>
<P>
   The report found that the most computer-literate participants,
including high school students, were among those least shocked that
personal information is available on the Internet, reflecting that
people have to get used to the fact that ``times have changed and
the old rules no longer apply.''
</P>

Goes on the Internet?,'' may be found online at www.nifi.org.

 &HT;    CYBERPORN EMERGES AS TOP NET CONCERN
 &HT;    Moving in Washington (w) and Financial (f) categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Americans remain deeply concerned about the need to
protect children from sexually explicit material on the Internet,
but they do not want the government to limit access to cyberporn,
according to a new broad study released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The research report, from the National Issues Forums Institute
and the Kettering Foundation, offered fresh insights into public
attitudes based on some 60 lengthy civic meetings held recently in
19 states, at which participants reflected on a host of
Internet-related matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``This analysis shouldn't be confused with poll results, which
are a snapshot of public opinion at a given point in time,'' said
John Doble, whose research firm interpreted the results for the two
non-partisan and non-profit sponsors. ``Nor,'' Doble added,
``should such forums be confused with focus groups, in which
professional moderators, working from a tightly directed script,
interrogate respondents who receive an incentive to attend.''
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to the agendas of many policy-makers in Washington, the
forum participants failed to voice much spontaneous concern about
online hate sites, ``partly because people said they are protected
by the First Amendment and partly because participants did not see
them as presenting a clear and present danger,'' Doble said.
</P>
<P>
   As they deliberated, most people concluded that neo-Nazis and
the Ku Klux Klan should be permitted online access, so long as they
do not directly incite violence, the report said. Nor were people
widely alarmed about bomb-making sites, because, they noted, such
data is already widely available in books and libraries
</P>
<P>
   A host of other often hotly debated issues, such as Internet
gambling, cyberterrorism, and potential cyberattacks by hostile
foreign powers were scarcely mentioned. The terrorism concerns have
led the Clinton administration to develop a $1.4 billion plan to
monitor the nation's data networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are not yet blips on the public's radar screen,'' Doble
said.
</P>
<P>
   The theme that did strike home was the need to better protect
children from exposure to online pornography.
</P>
<P>
   ``More generally, many felt that the abundance of pornography on
the Net is an indication of our ethical decline, a sign of what we,
as a nation and as a global community, have come to value,'' the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, most participants opposed imposing an outright ban
on sexually explicit online material. They cited four reasons:
</P>
<P>
   Such materials are protected by constitutional freedom of
speech.
</P>
<P>
   No consensus exists about what constitutes pornography.
</P>
<P>
   The government cannot be trusted to censor wisely or well.
</P>
<P>
   As a worldwide phenomenon, the Web is virtually impossible to
control.
</P>
<P>
   As they deliberated, the forum participants favored the adoption
of improved software filters _ the online equivalent of the
so-called V-chips now being implanted in TV sets that would enable
parents to limit what comes into the home _ without limiting what
is actually online.
</P>
<P>
   Some participants noted that pornographic sites have been known
to use deception to lure people. Thus, a high school student from
Long Island described how classmates seeking information about the
Mars Pathfinder had navigated to a porn site designed to snare
surfers intending to reach NASA's Web page.
</P>
<P>
   The report found that the most computer-literate participants,
including high school students, were among those least shocked that
personal information is available on the Internet, reflecting that
people have to get used to the fact that ``times have changed and
the old rules no longer apply.''
</P>
<P>
   The full 34-page report, entitled, ``Protecting Our Rights: What
Goes on the Internet?,'' may be found online at www.nifi.org.

 NEW iMACS COME IN DIFFERENT FLAVORS AND COLORS  
 (Circuits)  
(jt) 
 By PETER H. LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The bubble-like, blue-and-white iMac was a classic from the day
it was born. Apple has now come up with a born-again iMac that is
so good it even has a glowing halo built into its new design. There
are three new models, ranging in price from $999 to $1,499.
</P>
<P>
   All still suffer from some of the original sins of the first
iMac _ lack of a removable storage drive, a relatively small
15-inch screen, and a clumsy mouse _ but they are redeemed by an
impressive array of advanced features not found on any other home
computer.
</P>
<P>
   While the first iMacs were notable mainly for their all-in-one
packaging and daring color schemes, the underlying technology was
rather mundane. The new models appeal to both sides of the brain.
</P>
<P>
   Physically, the new iMacs appear to have had a fanny tuck and
dermabrasion. The backside rides a little higher, and the system is
about an inch shorter front to back. Its skin is now clear instead
of cloudy, so the inner components are all visible through the
plastic.
</P>
<P>
   The base model iMac ($999) will not be widely available for a
few weeks, Apple said. It is based on a 350-megahertz G3 Motorola
processor, which has all the power needed for routine household
computing tasks. Apple asserts that the iMac's processor `toasts'
any Pentium chips made by the Intel Corp. Any such `cross-platform'
chip comparisons are difficult to measure. Nick Stam, technical
director of PC Magazine, said his benchmark tests show the iMac's
G3 being toasted by an Intel Pentium III. Stam said he believes the
400-megahertz G3 chip is comparable to Intel's 500-MHz Celeron
chip.
</P>
<P>
   Apple has boosted the standard system memory to 64 megabytes,
and for the first time there is a convenient expansion hole on the
bottom of the machine that enables owners to easily add, up to 256
megabytes of memory. Each 64 megabyte upgrade costs $140 and the
more you have the better the computer handles things like 3-D games
and video.
</P>
<P>
   It stores 6 gigabytes on its hard drive. A 56K modem and a
high-speed Ethernet port are built in for Internet connections, and
peripherals are attached through a pair of USB ports. An ATI Rage
128 graphics chip makes the iMac a good game machine.
</P>
<P>
   But the most intriguing networking option is in the belly of the
iMac, where Apple has included a slot for an optional $99 Airport
radio network card. Not yet available in stores, the Airport card
will enable the iMac to share files and resources at high speed
with other Airport-equipped Macintoshes without cables or wires, up
to a maximum distance of 150 feet. To share Internet access, one of
the Macintoshes on the wireless network has to be equipped with a
$299 Airport base station.
</P>
<P>
   The radio frequency used by the Airport system apparently
conflicts with a communications system used by the French military,
but Apple says that is not the cause of delays in Airport
availability. An Apple executive said the wireless networking
products would be available in several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   This assumes France does not declare war, of course. It would be
an interesting fight. Apple boasts in its advertisements that the
iMac's big brother, the new G4 desktop Macintosh, is so powerful it
is officially classified as a weapon by the State Department.
France, meanwhile, bases some of its military communications on the
same frequency used by millions of cordless phones worldwide. I'm
betting on Apple.
</P>
<P>
   Apple's other innovations with this model include a slot-loading
CD-ROM and a CD audio drive similar to the audio CD players found
on some car dashboards. The CD slot eliminates the rickety
slide-out tray that is familiar to most PC users, and sometimes
confused as a cup-holder.
</P>
<P>
   Apple has also added a pair of hi-fi stereo speakers from Harman
Kardon. They are no match for a set of good external speakers, but
they definitely run sonic rings around the characteristically weak
speakers built into other home PC systems. Harman Kardon plans to
offer a $99 external subwoofer for the iMac next month, which will
enhance the sound quality even more.
</P>
<P>
   The new iMac is also notable for the sounds it does not make.
Apple engineers have eliminated the internal fan used by other PC
makers to keep the computer's circuitry from overheating. Heat
escapes from the iMac instead through a large halo of holes atop
the computer. If the top of the iMac did not slope quite so much it
would be a favorite snoozing spot for cats.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of a fan means the iMac is exceptionally quiet when it
is working. In its sleep mode, when the screen goes dark and the
drives spin down, the only indication that it is still drawing
power is the slow, hypnotic pulsing of the green power light.
</P>
<P>
   There was only one model of the original iMac, but Apple has
expanded the line to include two higher-end models. The iMac DV
($1,299) is available in five different fruit colors that are even
fruitier than before because of the clear plastic case. The DV has
all of the features of the base model, plus some extras related to
digital video.
</P>
<P>
   The DV models have a slot-loaded DVD-ROM drive instead of a
CD-ROM drive. DVD discs may some day replace CDs as a way to
distribute music and software, but for now the most novel use of
DVD is digital video, mainly playing prerecorded movies. The DVD
drive also loads software and plays audio discs.
</P>
<P>
   The microprocessor in the DV models is a bit faster, (400 MHz),
and the hard disk is much bigger, (10GB), which is useful for
storing music and video files. There are two Firewire connection
ports, not found on the base model, for digital cameras and other
high-speed peripherals. And the DV models come with iMovie, a
digital video editing program that Apple insists will some day be
as significant as desktop publishing software was to the original
Macintosh almost 15 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The top of the line, and the model Apple provided for review, is
the iMac DV Special Edition, ($1,499), which comes only in a
gorgeous new silver color scheme that Apple calls ``graphite.'' The
DV Special Edition model has an even bigger hard disk, (13GB), and
even more memory, (128MB).
</P>
<P>
   I watched several movies on the iMac DV SE, and all were plagued
by a tendency for the video and audio to drift out of
synchronization as the movies progressed. The effect was like
watching a poorly dubbed foreign movie. Apple says it has
identified the problem and will issue a software patch on line in
the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   Also, performance of the iMac DVD player suffers significantly
if the user tries to use any other applications. Apple uses
software decoding for playing DVD movies, which saps even the
robust 400-MHz G3 chip and makes basic navigation commands, like
pause and skip chapter, extremely sluggish.
</P>
<P>
   The front-mounted speakers put out a brilliant sound, but at
weak volume for DVD soundtracks even with the controls set to
maximum. Audio CDs, in contrast, belted out the sound loud and
clear.
</P>
<P>
   Those gripes aside, the born-again iMacs are, dollar for dollar,
the best computers Apple has produced in many years. Other PC
makers will be racing to match the iMac's blend of high-tech
features and simplicity.
</P>
<P>
   Let's hope that they do not try to match Apple's arrogance,
however.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with continuing product shortages of its new Power Mac G4
desktop computers, Apple last week scored another industry first by
announcing a hardware downgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Apple had taken tens of thousands of advance orders for three
new G4 models that it had rushed to announce this fall before
making sure it had a reliable supply of microprocessors. When the
chip supply fell short, Apple informed its customers that it was
``reconfiguring'' their orders with slower microprocessors, but
without any price reduction. People who ordered a 500-MHz G4 would
get a 450-MHz model instead, for example, but they would be charged
the original 500-MHz price, Apple said.
</P>
<P>
   Confronted with angry protests, Apple simply canceled everyone's
order.
</P>
<P>
   Confronted with even angrier protests and threats of boycott,
Apple finally did the right thing this week and agreed to reinstate
the earlier orders and original prices, but only for people who
ordered systems through the Apple Store before Oct. 13. The 500-MHz
G4 systems will not be available until ``early next year,'' Apple
said, so people who ordered them are being offered the 450-MHz
version instead.

   Crowning Glory
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have a two-year-old crown of thorns, nearly 18 inches tall,
with lots of leaves and flowers. The catch is they are all on the
top three inches. How do I make it branch out?
</P>
<P>
   A. Crown of thorns (Euphorbia milii) is a spiny succulent that
blooms almost constantly. There are many different selections, with
flowers ranging from brilliant red or pinkish to salmon, yellow or
white. It is perfect for the person who always wants a bit of cheer
around the house. Since yours is flowering and healthy, it is
getting enough bright light and warmth, but when the leaves are
concentrated in a tuft at the top, it is telling you that you are
keeping the soil too dry. Change your watering routine to keep it
evenly moist and you will stimulate it to produce leaves lower down
the stem, lessening that feather-duster appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Let it know you want it to branch by cutting a quarter inch off
the top. Once it knows you don't want a telephone pole, it will
branch just below the pinch and also along the lower part of the
stem. And later on, pinch those new branches a quarter inch, too,
to form a nice, well-grown plant. The scars from pinching will be
minimal because the tissue at the growing ends is soft, and the
thick white sap (which can irritate skin) will coagulate quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Sources crown of thorns selections include Grigsby Cactus
Gardens, 2326-2354 Bella Vista Drive, Vista, Calif., 92084; (760)
727-1323 (catalog is $2) and Louisiana Nursery, 5853 Highway 182,
Opelousas, La. 70570; (318) 948-3696 (catalog is $6).
</P>
<P>
   Dodder Invasion
</P>
<P>
   Q. Our sidewalk tree wells are planted with impatiens. Every
year, one well develops spiderlike thin branches that coil around
the impatiens stems and kind of ``choke'' the plants. They only
come out when the well is planted with flowers. We weed them out
but they grow right back. Do you have a solution to get rid of
these spider plants permanently?
</P>
<P>
   A. Dodder is a nasty annual vine that doesn't even bother to
produce its own chlorophyll. Instead, it parasitizes and robs other
plants of their nutrients. The seeds, probably brought in with the
soil in the tree well, lie dormant for years until an appropriate
host is present. Vinca, chrysanthemums, ivy and impatiens are among
its many victims. At first, dodder grows roots, but these stop
functioning after the plant forms a large, sprawling, tangled
network of thin yellowish or reddish stalks that drapes itself over
and physically joins itself to the impatiens, and begins stealing
food.
</P>
<P>
   Dodder germinates in July, producing small white flowers and
seeds within weeks, so vigilance is crucial. Prevent it from
seeding by removing the dodder, and the impatiens it is wed to, as
soon as you can. By autumn, it has already set and dropped seed,
but you can get the jump on next year's battle. Throw out the
impatiens and then carefully remove the top inch or so of soil and
replace it. That should eliminate most, but maybe not all, of the
dodder seeds. There are no effective control products, so you need
to be ruthless and constantly on the lookout for its first
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   No Magic Potions
</P>
<P>
   Q. We will be moving into a new house in December, and I have a
problem with the landscaping. I'm 76, and I don't want to pay for
large plants or have to wait 20 years for small plants to mature.
Gibberellic acid, the plant growth hormone, is available from a
mail-order nursery that also sells small, inexpensive trees and
shrubs. Would that hormone be the answer to my problem?
</P>
<P>
   A. Sounds logical, and you probably wouldn't be the first person
to be disappointed, but it isn't a magic potion.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Peter Davies, an expert in plant hormones at Cornell
University in Ithaca, N.Y., said that gibberelins are plant
hormones that occur naturally and help control growth. Gibberellic
(pronounced jib-er-EL-ic) acid makes some plants grow taller, but
it does so by an unnatural elongation of the cells, not the
production of healthy new tissue. While there has been no research
into its effect on trees, he expects that it would not work at all.
</P>
<P>
   Gibberellins do have uses in horticulture, including in the
testing of dormant seeds to see if they are still viable, but
instant landscaping isn't one of them. Buy medium-size, well-grown
plants you can enjoy watching grow, and let the future take care of
itself.

   HOW TO MAKE A CLEAN START
</P>
<P>
   Q. How do you delete a program from the Start menu in Windows
95? We have America Online 3.0 and 4.0 on the menu but do not use
them anymore since we got AOL 5.0. We tried to right-click on the
names, but the Delete option did not appear.
</P>
<P>
   A. Deleting outdated shortcuts from the Start or Programs menu
is not hard. Click on your Start button, then go to Settings and
click on Taskbar and Start Menu. Once there, click on the Start
Menu Programs tab on the box. Pick Remove and find the name of the
program that you wish to discard on the list. Select the program
name and then click the Remove button.
</P>
<P>
   These actions just remove the program's listing from the Start
Menu. If you think you will not need the older versions of AOL, you
may want to remove them to free up space on your hard drive. A safe
way to do this is with the Add/Remove utility in your computer's
Control Panel.
</P>
<P>
   Macintosh users have been using the Apple Menu for years to do
similar tasks, like opening popular programs with one easy motion.
Some program installers will leave alias files (shortcuts) in the
computer's Apple Menu. Mac users wishing to do a little pruning
just need to open the Apple Menu Items folder in the computer's
System Folder and drag the unwanted program aliases to the Trash.

<P>
   You go home, unlock the front door and flip a switch, and your
hallway lights up.
</P>
<P>
   It may seem like a simple thing, turning on that 60-watt bulb.
But that bulb is actually part of a web of generators, power lines
and other people's bulbs that are interconnected in a complex
electrical network known as the North American power grid.
</P>
<P>
   It stretches from one end of the United States to the other and
includes parts of Canada and Mexico, with more than 700,000 miles
of high-tension lines.
</P>
<P>
   Within the grid are three interconnected divisions; within each
one, the amount of electricity used must equal the amount of
electricity produced at every given instant. Because the
alternating current in your electrical lines travels at virtually
the speed of light and cannot be stored, every time you turn on a
reading lamp, a generator somewhere in the grid has to provide a
tiny bit more power to the entire system.
</P>
<P>
   The electricity travels long distances over circuitous routes,
following paths of least resistance. It's like the flow of traffic
into a city: if one freeway is jammed, cars will use alternate
routes.
</P>
<P>
   Take power shipped from Portland, Ore., to Los Angeles, for
example: some 30 percent of that shipment will probably flow
through Utah en route. Meanwhile in the East, if a Canadian
hydropower plant is fueling someone's midnight repast in New York,
the electricity could flow as far west as Ohio and as far south as
Virginia _ nearly instantly _ before reaching the house where it is
needed.
</P>
<P>
   If a lightning storm knocks out one line in the grid, or a
generator stops working unexpectedly, the rest of the grid is
affected. Other lines handle more power to make up for the downed
line, or other generators work harder. Every part of the system is
sensitive to changes in any other part of the system.
</P>
<P>
   While the system uses alternating current, or AC, the three
divisions are connected by direct current, or DC, lines, which are
easier to control. So in an emergency, power can be transferred
from one connection to another, but power failures will not spread.
</P>
<P>
   The power grid has evolved over the last hundred years or more.
Gene Gorzelnik, director of communications at the North American
Electric Reliability Council, said that 138 ``control areas''
monitor the modern grid, using computer systems to predict energy
flow and anticipate reactions to power interruptions.
</P>
<P>
   John Casazza, author of ``The Development of Electric Power
Transmission'' (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers,
1993), remembers a simpler time. Casazza recalls working with an
early analog computer, built in 1927, that used electric components
to reproduce an electric system in miniature.
</P>
<P>
   Such early devices, each big enough to fill a large living room,
were used until the '60s to simulate the impact of various events
on the grid. In the '60s, electric companies switched to digital
computers.
</P>
<P>
   The first commercial power plant opened in San Francisco in
1879. That was followed in 1882 by Thomas Edison's better known
Pearl Street station in New York, which delivered electric power
using DC lines. In 1893, AC lines were displayed at the Chicago
World's Fair, and in 1896, AC lines delivered energy harnessed at
Niagara Falls some 20 miles to Buffalo, setting today's standard of
using AC lines to transmit power.
</P>
<P>
   The latest change in the power system is deregulation, which has
occurred in California and went into effect in the New York area
this month. Instead of having a utility that owns the generator,
transmission lines, substations and distribution lines,
deregulation will result in separate ownership for various segments
of the grid.
</P>
<P>
   Electric utilities bid for electricity from various generators
in two sets of auctions: one that happens the day before the power
is scheduled to be used and another that happens an hour before.
</P>
<P>
   That requires very detailed monitoring, which in turn requires
an advanced, complex system. Critics of deregulation, like Casazza,
say that the complexity of the grid, compounded by a proliferation
of auction data, will lead to an increase in the number of
blackouts, like the infamous 1965 New York City blackout that left
30 million people in the Northeast and Canada without power and led
to a federal push for more reliable power.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Carl Blumstein, a research associate at the University
of California's Energy Institute, said he doubted that the number
of blackouts would increase with deregulation, but he added,
``We'll just have to wait and see if there's a difference.''

FUEL CELL MAY BE THE FUTURE `BATTERY' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ariz., Va., N.J., N.M.)   (af)  
 By ANNE EISENBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The next time the batteries in your laptop or cell phone conk
out at the most inconvenient moment, take heart.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists are fine-tuning an invention that may eventually
replace not only those fallible batteries but even the recharger.
</P>
<P>
   The invention is the fuel cell, a device that may one day sit
neatly inside your mobile phone or laptop. It uses the reaction of
hydrogen and oxygen to generate a continuous stream of electricity
for days on end with no help whatsoever from a battery.
</P>
<P>
   Fuel cells were once seen as future power sources for cars,
buses and power stations, but inventors are now proposing them for
the subkilowatt world of portable electronics. They may soon come
to the aid of soldiers, police officers and even everyday commuters
who are weary of the inconvenience of their battery packs,
rechargers and spare AAs.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts say the latest fuel cells may provide a power
source that weighs far less, and lasts far longer, than any battery
on the market, in part because of their efficient use of hydrogen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fuel cells have a simply amazing ability to extract energy
from the hydrogen atom,'' said Dr. Christopher Dyer, a senior
member of the technical staff at Motorola Labs in Tempe, Ariz., who
is the inventor of a fuel cell designed for use in portable
electronic devices.
</P>
<P>
   The principle of every hydrogen-based fuel cell is that when
hydrogen is joined to oxygen, forming water, energy is produced.
The energy takes the form of electricity and some waste heat. The
byproducts, depending on the source of the hydrogen, are a bit of
water vapor and, often, carbon dioxide, which is vented from the
fuel cell.
</P>
<P>
   Give the fuel cells enough hydrogen, plus the oxygen that is
provided free in the atmosphere, Dyer said, and they could power
devices like cell phones for days, weeks or even months. The
hydrogen that drives these small marvels will probably be provided
by methanol, a compound commonly known as wood alcohol that
contains hydrogen, Dyer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A liter of methanol should provide enough electricity to run a
laptop for more than a week,'' Dyer said. ``A lithium ion battery
of comparable volume has a tenth of that energy.'' Lithium ion
batteries, commonly used in laptops, each provide about three hours
of energy.
</P>
<P>
   Fuel cells have another advantage besides a high energy output,
Dyer said. They can be replenished quickly, unlike batteries, which
require a slow recharging. Dyer imagines that owners of cell
phones, laptops and pagers will someday refuel their devices by
occasionally slipping in a new ampul of methanol.
</P>
<P>
   ``Methanol is inexpensive,'' Dyer said. ``Ampuls of it could be
bought from a supermarket.''
</P>
<P>
   Fuel cells are not new devices, although the intense recent
interest in them is. They were demonstrated in the 19th century and
deployed more than a century later to power NASA's space vehicles.
But the internal processing required to produce that continuous
stream of electricity high in the sky proved too expensive for
daily applications.
</P>
<P>
   That is changing now, as engineering advances have gradually
lowered costs. At the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency in
Arlington, Va., Robert Nowak, a program manager, said research
sponsored by the agency would aid the overladen American soldiers
who routinely carry 20 to 30 pounds of batteries on their missions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fuel cells begin to look very attractive when you consider
what you need in the equivalent battery power to run a computer,
radio and other gear soldiers must often take with them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Nowak has not entirely banished batteries from the fuel
cells his agency has helped to develop. Like many people in the
field, he supports a hybrid, or dual, system that uses both a
battery and a small fuel cell. The battery provides peaks of power
when needed, and the fuel cell keeps the battery recharged.
</P>
<P>
   ``In principle this means you will only add fuel to the cell
from time to time,'' Nowak said. ``The battery will supply any
transient power that exceeds a baseline level.''
</P>
<P>
   While most small fuel cells are more common in research
laboratories than in factories, the H Power Corp. in Belleville,
N.J., is a commercial producer of subkilowatt fuel cells. One type
it makes provides backup power for road signs with changing
messages like ``Congestion Ahead'' or ``Parking Lot A Is Full.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The fuel cell is the backup for the solar panel,'' said Rene
DuBois, director of sales and marketing at H Power. Variable road
signs with solar panels can go dead when, for instance, snow covers
the power source, and a fuel cell can keep the system operating and
fully charged.
</P>
<P>
   Fuel cells may one day offer not only long-term reliability but
also economy, said Robert Hockaday, the chief fuel cell scientist
for Manhattan Scientific in Los Alamos, N.M., and the inventor of a
miniaturized fuel cell technology. He hopes to show a prototype of
the fuel cell in a mobile telephone within the next three months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fuel cells are going to be very attractive to consumers of
batteries who right now are paying what amounts to a thousand
dollars a watt for their power,'' Hockaday said. ``That comes to
several hundred dollars per kilowatt-hour if they're paying a
dollar a battery and disposing of the battery after it's spent.''
</P>
<P>
   Hockaday initially plans to use a hybrid of a battery and a fuel
cell for his mobile phone. ``We will get continuous energy from the
fuel cell without giving up the big surge of power from the
battery,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hockaday said he expected his device to deliver three to five
times as much energy as a lithium ion battery.
</P>
<P>
   Many experts in the field predict that fuel cells will be widely
accepted in part because battery development will be unable to keep
up with consumers' demand for lightweight electronic products.
</P>
<P>
   ``The small-electronics-equipment market is quietly demanding
more and more energy,'' Dyer said. ``The rate of progress in
battery development is probably too slow to meet this demand.''
</P>
<P>
   The bright screens, souped-up processors and whiz-bang features
of the latest laptops, cell phones and other portable devices are
insatiable users of batteries. Consumers may not be carrying 20- to
30-pound packs, as the soldiers do, but many of them are routinely
hefting 12 to 14 pounds apiece once the weight of the power cord,
recharger and spare battery is calculated along with the weight of
the laptop.
</P>
<P>
   But fuel cells are not going to supplant batteries just yet.
``Not a single one is fully functional in a piece of portable
equipment,'' Dyer said. ``It's early days for the fuel cell. I
think it will be coming soon, but it isn't quite here yet.''

   Major earthquakes aren't occurring more frequently now than they
have in the past. It just seems that way, given the recent
earthquakes in Turkey, Greece, Taiwan and Mexico, which have
produced a succession of all-too-familiar images: collapsed
buildings, rescue crews hunting through rubble and victims being
pulled from the wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   Many people in the United States have their own reasons for
reflecting upon the subject: Sunday, Oct. 17, for example, was the
10th anniversary of the devastating Loma Prieta earthquake in
Northern California, and it came just one day after a quake shook
Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   Although earthquakes make compelling television, the Web is a
better place to learn about them. Some earthquake Web sites are a
natural fit for the medium, neatly combining the original purpose
of the Internet (linking scientists together) with the advantages
of the Web (presenting information in a broadly accessible way).
Through them, the public now has easy access to almost
instantaneous updates about earthquakes occurring anywhere in the
world, descriptions of seismic activity in particular regions,
explanations of how faults and plate tectonics work and
retrospective looks at individual earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
   A good starting point is the site run by the National Earthquake
Information Center (earthquake.usgs.gov), a division of the U.S.
Geological Survey. The Current Earthquake Information link leads to
the most notable feature of the site: the center's Near Real-Time
Earthquake Bulletin ``Finger'' List, a continually updated list of
the 21 most recent substantial earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
   The list gives the epicenter of each earthquake, the time it
occurred and its magnitude. Clicking on any quake produces a set of
relevant maps that highlight the epicenter and indicate the area's
major faults.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, a written description supplements the raw data.
Hours after the tremor that shook Mexico on Sept. 30, for instance,
a posted summary noted that the effects of that powerful jolt, as
big as the Taiwan quake, were diffused partly because the epicenter
was far beneath the earth's surface _ an atypical occurrence for
earthquakes caused by the Cocos plate off Mexico, which have
produced some major disasters in recent decades.
</P>
<P>
   Certain portions of the earthquake center's site are technical
and intended for seismologists, but the General Earthquake
Information section is meant for the lay reader. Several links
describe how earthquakes are measured. (A 7.0 quake, like the one
that struck Southern California on Saturday, releases 30 times as
much energy as one measuring 6.0, for example.) Others provide a
history of seismology, list major historical earthquakes and
discuss earthquake preparedness. There is also an earthquake
database, searchable by region.
</P>
<P>
   Major earthquakes ``have remained fairly constant throughout
this century,'' the site says, ``and have actually seemed to
decrease in recent years.'' Scientists detect more minor
earthquakes than ever before, it says, but only because more
seismograph stations have been placed around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Other sites also provide a mixture of quake updates and
background information, although they all rely upon the earthquake
center's data to do so. A rare privately run site doing that is
called Seismo-Watch (www.seismo-watch.com).
</P>
<P>
   One attraction of Seismo-Watch is that its Special Earthquake
Reports contain more complete descriptions of major earthquakes
than the earthquake center's site does, even detailing how
residents perceived them. It also produces weekly regional surveys
of seismic activity, with better maps than the center's.
Seismo-Watch is, however, a commercial site, so only some of these
are free.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, a university consortium, the Inc. Research
Institutions for Seismology, has developed its own update system
(www.iris.edu), using the NEIC as a source. The Seismic Monitor
link on the home page displays an interactive, real-time global
earthquake map; clicking on it produces lists of earthquakes by
date in the past 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   This format seems cumbersome, but buried beneath the surface is
a surprise: graphic animations illustrating the different types of
faults. (The direct address for this is
www.iris.washington.edu/seismic/events/faults.html.)
</P>
<P>
   The companion site to the public television series ``The Savage
Earth,'' produced by WNET in 1998, also shows how faults move
(www.wnet.org/savageearth/earthquakes/index.html). Through a series
of animated clips, it depicts various types of faults, the
propagation of earthquake waves and even the way the earth's
surface shakes during a quake.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Geological Survey has posted a 10th-anniversary
retrospective (quake.wr.usgs.gov/study/LomaPrietaAnniversary) about
the Loma Prieta quake. It gives a dire warning: ``The next big
earthquake in the San Francisco Bay Area may come sooner than you
think.'' That is hardly reassuring for people with close ties to
the region. But when it happens, at least they will know where to
find a quick and accurate report.

 &HT;    HELMS NO STRANGER TO CONFIRMATION BATTLES
 &HT;    For release Sunday, Oct. 24.
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Jesse
Helms, R-N.C., whose opposition to the appointment of Carol
Moseley-Braun as ambassador to New Zealand reportedly stems from a
dispute over the Confederate flag, is no stranger to confirmation
fights.
</P>
<P>
   Helms says he is holding up Senate consideration of
Moseley-Braun, who last year was defeated for re-election as
senator from Illinois, because of character concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``This nomination comes to the Senate with an ethical cloud
hanging over Ms. Moseley-Braun. (Indeed, I wonder if the president
and his associates even examined her record before submitting it to
the Senate.) Charges of ethical lapses led the voters of Illinois
to determine she was not fit to represent them in the U.S.
Senate,'' Helms said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   However, a dispute between the two of them over the ``stars and
bars'' has been mentioned as a possible reason for Helms's
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   As a senator, Moseley-Braun, who is black, led a successful
effort to reject a Helms amendment that would renew a United
Daughters of the Confederacy patent on an insignia that included
the Confederate flag. According to newspaper accounts, the two
combatants once found themselves in a Senate elevator and Helms
started singing ``Dixie,'' telling a bystander, Sen. Orrin G.
Hatch, R-Utah, ``I'm going to sing 'Dixie' to her until she
cries.''
</P>
<P>
   Helms's action in the nomination has been denounced by the White
House and Moseley-Braun supporters, including Julian Bond, chairman
of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is beyond disgraceful _ that this racist reprobate would
dare to block this appointment,'' Bond said. ``In the past,
nominees have been turned down by the Senate because they belonged
to all-white clubs; now this all-white club has turned on the only
black female to have ever gained membership. Is there no shame?''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate minority leader, Tom Daschle of South Dakota, told
reporters Wednesday that ``Carol Moseley- Braun is just the latest
victim of increasing sentiment expressed by an increasing number of
Republican senators that I
</P>
<P>
   think is very dangerous for this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Helms has stopped the hoped-for diplomatic careers of previous
ambassador nominees in their tracks and delayed others.
</P>
<P>
   In reverse chronological order, the disappointees include:
</P>
<P>
   _ J. Brian Atwood, President Clinton's choice for ambassador to
Brazil, who on May 18 withdrew his name from consideration, citing
lingering differences with Helms. Atwood, who had been Clinton's
administrator for the U.S. Agency for International Development for
the previous six years, said he suspected Helms was blocking his
nomination because he defied the chairman in keeping AID a separate
agency during last year's reorganization of the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   _ William F. Weld, a former Republican governor of
Massachusetts, who on Sept. 15, 1997, abandoned his bid to become
ambassador to Mexico, ending a five-month-long showdown. Helms, who
refused to hold a confirmation hearings, had accused Weld of being
soft on drugs. He gaveled moderate Senate Republicans into silence
when they attempted to bring up the nomination before his
committee.
</P>
<P>
   _ Nineteen ambassadorial nominees whom Helms blocked in 1995 as
leverage to force agreement on legislation to reorganize foreign
policy agencies _ the same reorganization Atwood and others
successfully opposed. Helms released the nominations after
Democrats agreed to procedural moves he had demanded on the
reorganization legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to play hardball, we can play hardball,'' Helms told
reporters several months before he released the nominations. ``They
get no more ambassadors, they don't get any treaties, they don't
get anything. And when they're ready to do business, they can get
in touch with me and we'll work together.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Robert Pastor, whose nomination as ambassador to Panama was
withdrawn by the Clinton administration in 1995 after Helms blocked
it. The North Carolina senator said he was still angry with Pastor,
who served on the National Security Council staff during the Carter
administration, for the role he played in negotiating the treaty to
return sovereignty over the Panama Canal to Panama. He said Pastor
had presided ``over one of the most disastrous and humiliating
periods in the history of U.S. involvement in Latin America.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Melissa Wells, whose 1987 appointment by President Reagan as
ambassador to Mozambique, was held up for 15 months because of
Helms's displeasure over Reagan administration's policy toward the
Southeast African nation, at the time governed by a Marxist regime.
She was confirmed after the Senate voted to override Helms's
objections.

<P>
   Yields 2 loaves
</P>
<P>
   1 cup butter
</P>

   1 1/2 cups sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon vanilla
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon salt

   Blend butter, sugar, vanilla, salt and lemon. Beat in eggs, stir
in soda mixture. Fold in rest of ingredients. Put in two greased
loaf pans. Bake at 350 for 35-45 minutes (or until a toothpick
inserted in center comes out cleanly).

   This bread freezes nicely. I slice frozen bread into thin slices
and make sandwiches by combining 8 ounces of room-temperature cream
cheese with a little red food coloring (if desired) and strawberry
preserves (enough to make a nice spreading consistency). Spread
between slices and cut in half.

FORT WORTH FILM FESTIVAL OPENS AMID SURPRISING FILM FEST BOOM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the Fort Worth Film Festival begins Thursday, it will fall
within a period of film-festival mania in the Metroplex. The Vistas
Film Festival, a Hispanic-themed fest, concluded Sunday in Dallas.
OutTakes, a gay and lesbian fest, will run Nov. 4-7 at Dallas'
Lakewood Theater. The Deep Ellum Film Festival, which puts the
spotlight on alternative cinema, will run Nov. 11-14 in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Four film festivals in four weeks, and the oldest _ Fort Worth's
_ is celebrating only its second birthday. Even if you're a movie
buff, you might not have been aware that any of these fests
existed.
</P>
<P>
   ``So much of this is just informing folks,'' says Dwight Greene,
vice president and co-founder of the Fort Worth fest. ``When I
mention the Fort Worth Film Festival, they say, `What's that?' ''
</P>
<P>
   The Fort Worth film festival is four days of movies ranging from
low-budget independent films looking for a distributor to the movie
classic ``To Kill a Mockingbird,'' which is part of a tribute to
Gregory Peck, whose stage show ``A Conversation With Gregory Peck''
will run at the Bass Performance Hall during the festival.
</P>
<P>
   But that's only part of the story. If casual filmgoers have a
mental picture of a festival, it probably comes from media
reporting on the glamour festivals _ Cannes, Sundance, Toronto, New
York and a handful of others. Cannes and Sundance, in particular,
are such celebrity draws that they've been criticized as becoming
as much about glitz as they are about film.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's inaugural Fort Worth fest was probably more
representative of what happens at most of the 1,000 or so film
festivals in the United States. The quality of the films varied
widely, as did the audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``It depended on which show you went to,'' says Greene, who also
works in the Star-Telegram's obituary department. ``We had the star
and director in for a family film called `Lunker Lake,' and not a
single child showed up, even though we showed it on a Saturday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we brought in Tippi Hedren, and it was packed for `The
Birds,' '' Greene says, referring to the Alfred Hitchcock movie and
its lead actress.
</P>
<P>
   The trick is bringing in the right talent. Peck is certainly a
drawing card, although he's not expected to attend any of the
half-dozen Peck movies that the festival is screening. But the
festival is bringing in Mary Badham and Phillip Alford, who played
Peck's children in ``To Kill a Mockingbird,'' as well as Brock
Peters, who played the rape defendant in the film.
</P>
<P>
   And on opening night _ a three-picture tribute to James Cagney
that will also feature the unveiling of a Cagney postage stamp _
the fest is bringing in Anne Francis, the fiery actor's former
co-star. Francis' sci-fi classic ``Forbidden Planet'' will also
screen during the fest.
</P>
<P>
   Some fests have come under fire for programming movies that are
available on video or that have aired often on TV. Many of the Peck
titles are airing this week on Turner Classic Movies as part of the
cable channel's own Peck tribute. But Greene finds such criticism
misguided.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many people have seen `Roman Holiday' on the big screen,
without the top and bottom cut off?'' Greene asks, referring to
another Peck film on the festival program. ``What we're doing is
showing the classic movies the way they were meant to be seen.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Fort Worth fest is just as much about getting new stuff
seen, and last year's program took some heat for that as well.
Greene, a filmmaker who has carted his low-budget speed-freak
thriller ``Ramming Speed'' on the festival circuit, is generous
when it comes to giving raw talent exposure.
</P>
<P>
   ``People would say to me, `You're supposed to show the very
best,' '' Greene says. ``But that's not necessarily what our
mission is. There's a lot of raw talent out there that needs to
have its work seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Several of this year's shorts _ the Martin Scorsese-goes-to-Oz
twistfest ``New Kansas,'' the Shakespeare-on-acid ``Midsummer,''
and Danny DeLoach's rubes-find-a-bomb satire ``New Clear Farm'' _
show a lot of promise.
</P>
<P>
   What this year's festival lacks is a strong premiere. Last
year's kicked off with ``Rushmore,'' a critical favorite that wound
up on some year-end Top 10 lists. Although some people hated the
movie, it was still a major-studio release, months ahead of its
opening date, and it got the festival off to an auspicious start.
</P>
<P>
   This year brings two new studio movies, Fine Line's
``Tumbleweeds'' and ``Man of the Century,'' each of which will be
in theaters in coming weeks. But neither is being billed as an
``event,'' and neither will have appearances by filmmakers or
stars.
</P>
<P>
   The festival has made changes that should help. It has cut back
on weekday-matinee programming, which was poorly attended last
year. A couple of last year's interesting but underappreciated
experiments _ screenings of old two-reel westerns and projecting
movies on the Chisholm Trail Mural wall in Sundance Square _ have
been dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Greene worries that with the sudden wealth of festivals, the
North Texas film audience will feel a little overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't even know that there were this many fests,'' Greene
says. ``But then again, I've had my head buried in the sand,
working on my fest. Maybe other people have got their heads buried,
too, and when they hear the words `film fest,' they just lump them
all together.''

<P>
   Q:.MDNM/ I have a recipe that calls for blackberry Jell-O
gelatin. Where can I find it or a comparable product from another
company? _ T.M.T.
</P>
<P>
   A:.MDNM/ After being discontinued for many years, that Jell-O
flavor was brought back as Berry Black and is sold as a Halloween
snack, according to Kraft Foods.
</P>
<P>
   If you can't find a flavor, the Jellophile World Wide Web site
has a suggestion: Mix fruit juice or something similar with a
powdered gelatine product such as Knox Unflavored Gelatin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each small box of Jell-O has the equivalent of one packet of
unflavored gelatine in it,'' C.M.J. Boston Baden writes on
Jellophile. ``Set aside one packet for every two cups of juice.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jellophile site is at www.boston-baden.com/hazel/Jello. You
can contact Kraft Foods by calling (800) 431-1001 or visiting the
Web site www.kraftfoods.com.
</P>
<P>
   Q:.MDNM/ I'm looking for a movie I saw when I was a teen-ager. I
thought the name was ``Girl on the Red Velvet Swing'' but I have
been unable to locate a movie by that name. Can you help? _ J.L.,
Brownwood
</P>
<P>
   A:.MDNM/ The 1955 movie ``Girl in the Red Velvet Swing'' starred
Joan Collins, Ray Milland and Farley Granger.
</P>
<P>
   In a story based on a famous 1906 murder, Collins played Evelyn
Nesbit Thaw, a model and showgirl whose nickname was used as the
film's title. Thaw's millionaire husband (Granger) fatally shot her
lover, the architect Stanford White (Milland), leading to the 20th
century's first ``trial of the century.''
</P>
<P>
   The film does not appear to have been released on video.
</P>
<P>
   Q:.MDNM/ Where can I write to golfer Sergio Garcia? _ M.C., Fort
Worth
</P>
<P>
   A:.MDNM/ Write to Garcia or other pros on the Professional
Golfers Association tour in care of the PGA, 112 TPC Blvd., Ponte
Vedra Beach, FL 32082.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia, 19, turned pro this year, finishing second to Tiger
Woods at the PGA Championship in August.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia is a native of Castellon, Spain. He won 17 of the 21
amateur events he entered in 1997 and 1998 and won the Irish Open
and German Masters tournaments this year.  &QL;

COMPUTERS: THE BALANCHINE BEHIND THOSE HIGH-TECH FOUNTAINS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Nev., Calif.)  (af) 
 By VERNE G. KOPYTOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ People standing in front of the Bellagio casino
appeared to forget about winning a jackpot as soon as the fountain
in the resort's lake began dancing to Lionel Richie's song, ``All
Night Long.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of water columns swayed to the beat, creating graceful
arcs and pirouettes that were illuminated by floodlights. The
streams intensified with the music until the water shot 20 stories
high, like a row of giant exclamation points along half a block of
the Las Vegas Strip.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the classiest show on the Strip,'' said Jenine Cali, a
rock musician from Las Vegas, Nev., who watched the fountain in
action on an October evening, waving her arms as if conducting a
symphony. She joined the hundreds of other spectators around the
lake in applauding once the show was over.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very spiritual,'' she said. ``It puts me in a trance.''
</P>
<P>
   Fountains are no longer simply marble statues with spouts.
Assisted by technology, fountains now feature fire, lights, fog,
music and increasingly sophisticated liquid acrobatics.
</P>
<P>
   Only computers are able to act quickly enough to operate a
fountain's dozens of water nozzles and other embellishments at the
same time.
</P>
<P>
   They are programmed to open and close fountain valves in a
variety of combinations to make performances as different as a
dribble of water is different from a geyser.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technology is just as important to a fountain as steel is to a
building,'' said Mark Fuller, chairman and founder of Wet Design, a
company based in Universal City, Calif., that designed Bellagio's
fountain.
</P>
<P>
   That was not always the case. For centuries, fountains had
controls no more complicated than gravity and water pressure.
</P>
<P>
   With computers, fountains can be choreographed to spray in a
variety of heights and patterns. All the computer must do is issue
a different set of instructions.
</P>
<P>
   For example, some nozzles can shoot tall streams while others
barely gurgle. Then the nozzles can suddenly reverse roles, fire
randomly or shoot rapidly around a circle in what is called a
chase.
</P>
<P>
   Hugh F. Hughes, director of business development for the
fountain-building division of Valley Crest, a landscaping company
based in Anaheim, Calif., said that computers also allowed
fountains to be controlled in intervals of less than a second. That
way, fountains can spray in rapid succession small streams of water
that collide in the air with a splash.
</P>
<P>
   Updating fountains with new performances is another job that is
considered to be easier with computers. Rather than using a wrench
and screwdriver to make a fountain do new things, designers can
simply add a computer program.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the client says, `We've seen these four or five shows,
can my fountain do anything else?' we say yes,'' Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   Valley Crest often builds fountains with computers about the
size of an encyclopedia that usually operate outdoor lighting
systems. Such fountains operate on automatic pilot and can feature
dozens of nozzles programmed to perform a variety of water
gymnastics.
</P>
<P>
   The fountain at Bellagio, the $1.6 billion casino opened in
October 1998 by Mirage Resorts and designed by its chief executive,
Stephen A. Wynn, is of another order altogether. Considered to be
among the largest and most sophisticated in the world, it opened at
a cost of $40 million. It features 1,203 nozzles and 4,500 lights
spread across 860 feet of the hotel's eight-acre faux Alpine lake.
</P>
<P>
   About the only thing it doesn't have is fire, which some
fountains include. The only one in the United States, another one
of Wet Design's products, was built at the Viejas Springs casino
near San Diego. It spews flames while it sprays water, creating
what looks like burning water.
</P>
<P>
   Natural gas is released into the water and then lighted _ but
only after the maintenance system's approval and only if the
fountain's human operator is pressing an all-clear button at the
proper moment.
</P>
<P>
   Even without fire, choreographing Bellagio's fountain took more
than two months. The performance of each nozzle and light had to be
individually programmed for the duration of nearly a dozen songs.
</P>
<P>
   ``To do it the traditional way of turning knobs and typing
things in would take the proverbial thousand monkeys a thousand
years,'' said Fuller, from Wet Design.
</P>
<P>
   The fountain's brains are in a couple of unremarkable looking
boxes filled with electronics that sit in eight-foot-tall glass
cabinets in a tower behind the lake. Called spoolers, these devices
are actually special computers that can quickly issue a large
number of commands.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these instructions are transmitted to giant equipment
rooms underneath the hotel, where the fountain's machinery hums so
loud that visitors must wear ear protection.
</P>
<P>
   The rooms are filled with large air pumps that send the
fountain's water surging in the air and huge cabinets filled with
electronic wiring and relays.
</P>
<P>
   Next to the spoolers is the fountain's electronic maintenance
monitoring system. It checks the fountain's hardware 30 times a
second to make sure that nothing breaks. If something does break,
the monitoring system turns everything off and warns human
operators of the problems.
</P>
<P>
   Adjoining cabinets contain separate controls for the audio and
hotel facade lighting. The computerized music system pumps out
sound to the nearly 200 speakers around the lake while the lighting
system dims the lamps in front of the hotel just before fountain
performances begin.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most fountains, the control system at Bellagio is backed
up by a human, who is in charge of pressing the start button before
every show. Putting the fountain on automatic pilot is considered
too risky.
</P>
<P>
   Someone must be there in case equipment malfunctions and to
watch the lake for straggling maintenance workers and spectators
foolish enough to go for a swim. The water from the fountain is
expelled at such high pressure _ up to 250 pounds per square inch _
that anyone caught in the line of fire could be injured.
</P>
<P>
   On an autumn evening, Scott O'Connor operated the fountain at
Bellagio. He pressed the fountain's green start button, and within
seconds water salvos were jumping nearly 200 feet in the air to the
rhythm of Frank Sinatra singing ``Luck Be a Lady.'' When he saw
through binoculars that the spray was drenching the restaurant, he
told the computer to reduce the fountain's height.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most violent, most impressive show we have,''
O'Connor said before looking through his binoculars for angry faces
on the restaurant patio. A bit relieved, he added, ``No one's
jumping.''

A SEA MONSTER SURFACES ON THE NET 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By MICHAEL POLLAK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   This month was a historic one for scientists and armchair
daredevils who like their calamari 25 feet long and marinated in
ethanol. The American Museum of Natural History has unveiled in its
Hall of Biodiversity, the first giant squid available for public
viewing in New York City. You can read about it at www.amnh.org, by
clicking on the squid icon.
</P>
<P>
   The museum's squid, believed to be the world's best-preserved
specimen, was caught accidentally in late 1997, by a fishing boat
off New Zealand, where deep-net trawlers have been catching unusual
numbers of the extremely rare animals. It was flash-frozen on the
boat (thank goodness) and flown to New York in June 1998, where it
spent 16 months in a coffin-like container in the museum's research
wing while a special fiberglass viewing tank was being prepared.
</P>
<P>
   When it arrived last year _ all arms, two tentacles, parrotlike
beak and eyes the size of saucers _ Neil Landman, a museum curator
and specialist in invertebrate paleontology, called it
``gorgeous.'' Richard Ellis, author of ``The Search for the Giant
Squid,'' exclaimed, ``This is the greatest event in New York City
squid history.''
</P>
<P>
   The giant squid (genus Architeuthis) was made for overwrought
superlatives. It is the world's largest invertebrate _ it can grow
to more than 50 feet long from tail to tentacle tip _ and one of
biology's biggest mysteries. It was described scientifically only
in the 19th century, and, even today, the truth is obscured by sea
legend and accounts from awestruck sailors. All specimens have been
found either dead or dying, and scientists have little idea what
they do in their deep water habitat, other than get eaten by sperm
whales, their only known predators.
</P>
<P>
   How long do they live and how big do they grow? Just what do
they eat? Do they swim slow or fast, alone or in schools? How far
do they migrate? Can they use their ability to change color to
``talk''? How do they make little squids? No one knows for sure. In
fact, a well-preserved specimen is so important that this one will
be on view for only two years or so; it will then go back upstairs
to the research department. The American Museum's Web site gives an
expert summary of what we do know.
</P>
<P>
   For a longer but entertaining account, complete with travelogue,
the Smithsonian Institution has an online exhibition, ``In Search
of Giant Squid'' (http://seawifs.gsfc.nasa.gov/squid.html). It
reproduces 16th-century drawings of mermen (Norwegians' first guess
at the identity of the creatures that occasionally washed ashore),
as well as dramatic, and sometimes fanciful, 19th-century
engravings of sea battles between squid and ship and squid and
whale.
</P>
<P>
   The Smithsonian has also provided an excerpt from Chapter 18 in
Jules Verne's ``Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea,'' a link to
information about the Disney movie and another link to the entire
book on line. Clicking on the Smithsonian site's reference to Dr.
Clyde F.E. Roper, the curator of the exhibition, produces more
squid information and an additional reward: an excerpt from Chapter
59 of ``Moby-Dick,'' part of which follows:
</P>
<P>
   ``As with a low sucking sound it slowly disappeared again,
Starbuck still gazing at the agitated waters where it had sunk,
with a wild voice exclaimed _ `Almost rather had I seen Moby Dick
and fought him, than to have seen thee, thou white ghost!'
</P>
<P>
   `` `What was it, Sir?' said Flask.
</P>
<P>
   `` `The great live squid, which, they say, few whale-ships ever
beheld, and returned to their ports to tell of it.'''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 and again this year, Roper made a myth-dispelling
expedition to the underwater Kaikoura Canyon off New Zealand, and
obtained new data about a number of species, including diving
patterns of sperm whales, which the scientists hoped to use as
hound dogs to track their quarry.
</P>
<P>
   The journeys did not accomplish their most ambitious goal, to
photograph a giant squid in its natural habitat. (Scientists do not
know why they can't find them and sperm whales can.)
</P>
<P>
   But the 1999 expedition's journals are available, with
digressions about submersibles and dragon-boat racing, at
http://seawifs.gsfc.nasa.gov/squid99.html. An account of the 1997
expedition is available on the National Geographic's Web site:
www.nationalgeographic.com/features/97/kaikoura/index.html.

<HEADLINE>
WITH A STONE-MATE, THE PUZZLES BEGIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By J.C. HERZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Stone is a brilliant concept, badly executed. The idea is to
sell physical objects that unlock a virtual world. The Web space is
a series of puzzles, and the stone functions as an entry key.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how it works: You buy a small plastic pyramid containing
a stone pendant on a string. The pendant is black and smooth and
heavy and readily absorbs the warmth of your skin. Small silver
symbols are laser-etched onto its surface.
</P>
<P>
   You put on the necklace, find a computer and type in the Web
address on the plastic box. You see a registration screen with six
question marks. Replace the question marks with the symbol sequence
that matches your stone. Once you select the symbols that match
your stone, you're given a password to enter the game's matrix of
interlocking puzzles.
</P>
<P>
   There are 25 symbols to choose from, allowing for hundreds of
billions of sequence combinations, so the odds of randomly typing
in a valid sequence are slim. And even if you did, the system would
probably sniff you out because each symbol sequence is printed only
twice.
</P>
<P>
   There is only one stone in the world that matches yours, and the
site links you to the person who owns it, whether he or she lives
around the block or across the world. It's in your interest to help
each other _ when one person solves a puzzle, both get points.
</P>
<P>
   The other stone owner can help you, and vice versa. And
ultimately, that partner is the only person whose view of The
Stone's virtual space matches your own _ everyone else's view of
the puzzle world is slightly and subtly different.
</P>
<P>
   It's appealing, the idea that someone out there matches you. It
introduces all kinds of romantic ideas about chance and fate. If
you'd taken the box on the right instead of the one on the left,
you'd be linked to someone else. If that other person had been born
a week later, they would have got a different stone for their
birthday.
</P>
<P>
   But the events in your life have led you to a certain point in
time and space, and to a certain person. You cannot choose that
person. The universe chooses.
</P>
<P>
   That lends a sense of mystery to the game world. Cyberspace is
full of serendipity _ you randomly bump into people all the time.
But you don't have any formal link to them, and you don't have to
stay with them. And you have no connection to those people in the
real, physical world. But the key to this game is tangible. It is a
bridge between the universe of objects and a universe of hidden
information. That is a very powerful idea.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, it's a more powerful idea than this game probably
deserves because, unlike the retail mechanism and the social
dynamic, the puzzles are not well designed. They are supposed to be
interrelated, but the references are so esoteric they're almost
useless. The common logic that binds them is extraordinarily
tenuous, and there is no strong defining sensibility or coherent
narrative.
</P>
<P>
   These are the elements that make a collection of puzzles into a
game. In Riven, for instance, the whole world was infused with
Christian gnosticism, and the puzzles formed a recognizable
constellation if you adopted that particular mind-set. The Stone's
constellation doesn't resolve that well. Its overarching structure
is rickety.
</P>
<P>
   On a micro level, it also leaves a lot to be desired. The
puzzles are too hard for the average person to solve. There is
nothing wrong with difficult puzzles, per se, if the challenge is
purely intellectual. But a lot of these puzzles are difficult not
because the logic is complex but because you need to know obscure
factual tidbits before you can even begin to solve them.
</P>
<P>
   The Stone's designers want you to do research on the Internet.
That's a reasonable idea for an online game. But the factual
information is so gratuitously obtuse that the puzzles are
annoying, even after you solve them.
</P>
<P>
   Ostensibly, they're supposed to be tedious so you will be driven
onto the Commons, a threaded discussion board where players cast
about in hopes that someone has found the arcane splinter of
information they need and will nudge them in the right direction.
</P>
<P>
   The players are invariably smart people. One gets the sense that
they could devise better puzzles than they are given to solve. The
Stone's publisher, Abject Modernity, should give them the source
code. Instead of presenting 200 tedious problems that don't hang
together, let the players design their own. Let them form puzzle
clusters informed by their own philosophy. Let them collaborate.
Let them build. They will improve the system _ it would be
impossible not to.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of 10,000 people scratching their heads, there would be
1 million people pouring their brain power into the system. And
each of them would have paid $19.99 for a rock on a string.
</P>
<P>
   Just a suggestion. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Stone, published by Abject Modernity (www.abject.com);
requires version 4.0 of Netscape Navigator or Microsoft Explorer;
$19.99 plus shipping and handling. &QL;

NATIONAL BOOK AWARDS PLAY `WHO'S THAT?'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF GUINN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Traditionally, there have been a number of literary ``Who's
Who'' award dinners. But the National Book Awards' 50th anniversary
program, scheduled for Nov. 17 to honor 1999's nominees and
winners, might be better described as a ``who's that?'' of
literature.
</P>
<P>
   In a year when Frank McCourt published `` 'Tis,'' Edmund Morris
offered his controversial ``Dutch'' and Susan Faludi followed her
monumental ``Backlash'' with ``Stiffed,'' the nominating committee
of the National Book Foundation has come up with a slate of
nominees that includes just one previous winning author _
biographer Judith Thurman _ and one other previous finalist _ poet
Louise Gluck.
</P>
<P>
   Book critics, let alone casual readers, would be hard-pressed to
have read half the books up for awards. The best-known honoree
during ceremonies at New York's Marriott Marquis Hotel undoubtedly
will be TV talk-show queen Oprah Winfrey, honored for ``influential
contribution to reading and books,'' although none of the nominees
this year copped honors in Oprah's Book Club.
</P>
<P>
   Still, whoever wins in the categories of fiction, nonfiction and
poetry will collect $10,000 and a crystal sculpture. Runners-up win
$1,000 and a bronze medallion.
</P>
<P>
   Thumbnail descriptions of nominees in each category include:
</P>
<P>
   ``Fiction:''
</P>
<P>
   ``House of Sand and Fog'' by Andres Dubus III (Norton, $25.95) _
A former colonel in the shah of Iran's army has trouble finding
work in the United States. He ends up in a house whose former
owner, an alcoholic woman, wants it back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Waiting'' by Ha Jin (Pantheon, $24) _ The author, a Chinese
exile, spins a tale of a married army doctor and a nurse who fall
in love during the Cultural Revolution. Kirkus Reviews descibes
``Waiting'' as ``a kind of Chinese `Dr. Zhivago.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``Plainsong,'' by Kent Haruf (Knopf, $24) _ This is an unadorned
story about the people living in a small town on the Colorado
plains. It is distinguished by fabulous dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hummingbird House,'' by Patricia Henley (MacMurray &AMP; Beck,
$22) _ An American midwife staggers through adventures in Nicaragua
and Guatemala, and _ surprise _ discovers love along the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who Do You Love?'' by Jean Thompson (Harcourt Brace, $23) _
Thompson's collection of short stories focuses on the romantic
traumas of seemingly unlovable men and women who already bear their
share of life's scars.
</P>
<P>
   Prediction: Haruf should win. ``Plainsong'' is the only book
resonant enough to connect with a variety of readers. But the NBF
likes to confound (last year, they dissed Tom Wolfe's ``A Man in
Full'') and, if they're in the same mood this time around, they may
go for Ha Jin's ``Waiting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nonfiction:''
</P>
<P>
   ``Secrets of the Flesh: A Life of Colette'' by Judith Thurman
(Random House, $30) _ The author won in 1983 for ``The Life of a
Storyteller,'' which was about Isak Dinesen. ``Secrets of the
Flesh'' is anything but dry reading. Still, how many people these
days even know who Colette was, or why they should care? Anyone
who's read ``The Vagabond'' wouldn't have to ask.
</P>
<P>
   ``Woman: An Intimate Geography'' by Natalie Angier (Houghton
Mifflin, $25) _ Angier won a Pulitzer for previous books on
biology. She has been described as someone who ``writes like Walt
Whitman crossed with Erma Bombeck,'' and this time around, Angier
wants everyone to understand exactly how a woman's body works.
</P>
<P>
   ``Black Hawk Down: A Story of Modern War'' by Mark Bowden
(Atlantic Monthly Press, $24) _ This is an unjustly overlooked
study of the 1993 U.S. military operation in Mogadishu that
resulted in 18 dead American soldiers and subsequent horrifying
film footage of their bodies being dragged through the streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Embracing Defeat: Japan in the Wake of World War II'' by John
W. Dower (W.W. Norton, $29.95) _ After the Japanese surrender,
there were no magic buttons to push to restore economic health and
moral starch to the devastated island nation. Dower makes history
read like a gripping novel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Places Left Unfinished at the Time of Creation'' by John
Phillip Santos (Viking, $24.95) _ The Mexican-American journalist
traces his family history, providing lots of insights into modern
Hispanic culture along the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prediction:'' Dower will probably win, and probably should.
His track record is more impressive than Bowden's. But ``Black Hawk
Down'' is an awfully good book.
</P>
<P>
   Nominated poets include Louise Gluck ``(Vita Nova),'' Ai
``(Vice: New and Selected Poems),'' Clarence Major
``(Configurations),'' Sherod Santos ``(The Pilot Star Elegies)''
and C.K. Williams ``(Repair).''
</P>
<P>
   Children's authors up for awards are Louise Erdrich ``(The
Birchbark House),'' Laurie Halse Anderson ``(Speak),'' Kimberly
Willis Holt ``(When Zachary Beaver Came to Town),'' Polly Horvath
``(The Trolls),'' and Walter Dean Myers ``(Monster).''

 &HT;    A capital place to relive Georgia history
 &HT;    By Marylin Johnson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   To amuse himself when he was a kid, Jake Goldstein used to jump
from one bale of cotton to another on Wayne Street, the heart of
downtown Milledgeville. The bales were lined up to be taken to five
cotton gins surrounding this Middle Georgia town.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the 70-something businessman and property owner admits
the street is different and ``one has to adjust to the changes.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's exactly what business owners and restaurateurs are
doing _ changing the old buildings into a healthy mix of shops,
eating establishments and services for visitors and the town's
18,000 citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Daphne Epps turned a 1900 Victorian house into Daphne's Gifts on
Greene Street, which features all types of home accessories, china
and artwork. Calvin and Anne Brooks, along with daughters Mystie
Dennard and Merrie Collins, converted a 1921 gas station on East
Hancock into a charming florist shop, Anna Claire's.
</P>
<P>
   But some stores have a long history with the town. The J.C.
Grant Company Jewelers has been selling diamonds, crystal and gifts
in Milledgeville since 1909, while Harrold's Apparel store has
occupied its location for 50 years, and Bayne's Army Store, housed
in a restored 1908 building, has been in business since the early
'50s.
</P>
<P>
   ``As with most downtowns, the exodus of stores to malls and
strip centers took its toll on business in the late '60s and early
'70s,'' says Paula Bryan, executive director of the
MainStreet/Downtown Development Authority. ``Now we are trying to
restore the vitality. But Milledgeville is unique. It's anchored by
Georgia College &AMP; State University (1889) and Georgia Military
College (1879) on the old statehouse square. The students, over
4,500, give us a good customer base. Since most of our stores are
locally owned, the owner is always at home.''
</P>
<P>
   Milledgeville _ in Baldwin County _ was founded in 1803 and
included four public squares and 19 streets laid out in
checkerboard fashion. A local wag said one of the reasons people
settled in Milledgeville was that the branch water running off the
Oconee River went well with bourbon _ and politicans.
</P>
<P>
   It was Georgia's capital from 1804 until the designation was
moved to Atlanta in 1868. Named for John Milledge, a Revolutionary
War hero who also was a Georgia governor and U.S. senator, the town
boasts a nationally acclaimed historic district with a variety of
architecture including Federal, Greek Revival and Victorian. The
core shopping district is compact and easily walkable. Plenty of
free parking is available, and while you stroll, you can appreciate
the flowers and planters maintained by ``adopting'' parents in the
community, who give money or volunteer their labor.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Friday afternoon, Al and Helen Carroll of Chicago
were enjoying the beautiful fall weather and doing a bit of window
shopping. On the advice of friends, the two were checking out
retirement possibilities on nearby Lake Sinclair. ``We are already
drawn to this area after one visit,'' said Helen. ``Everyone is so
friendly, and Milledgeville has so many historical attractions and
shops to see and explore.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the gift shop that best sums up Milledgeville's
hospitality is Strictly Southern. Items range from locally bottled
honey to artwork and books by Southern artists and authors,
including ``Birthflowers of the Landscape'' by Linton Wright
McKnight.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a down-home kind of shop,'' said co-owner Jean
Babcock. ``We have a good time here. It's not like coming to work.
It's like coming to visit a friend.''
</P>
<P>
   If you go
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Getting there: From downtown, take I-20 east. Take Exit 51 and
go right on U.S. 441 south. Stay on this road, which changes to
North Columbia Street as you approach Milledgeville. Go into town
and turn left on Hancock Street. Georgia College &AMP; State University
will be on your left. The downtown area is straight ahead. It's
about a two-hour drive.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Hours: Most stores are open 10 a.m.-6 p.m. Mondays-Saturdays.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Parking: Free parking on street; also, parking in lots on
Hancock Street beside the post office and on South Jefferson Street
behind City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Handicapped access: All stores
</P>
<P>
   are accessible.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Restrooms: Located in the Milledgeville-Baldwin County
Convention and Visitors Bureau, 200 W. Hancock St. Also,
restaurants have restrooms.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Information: Milledgeville-Baldwin County Convention and
Visitors Bureau, 1-800-653-1804.
</P>
<P>
   Where to eat
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Amici Italian Cafe. Visitors and locals alike flock to this
brick-walled restaurant, which was once a bookstore, to eat such
Italian specialities as spinach and cheese calzones ($6.50),
eggplant Parmesan ($8) and spaghetti with marinara sauce ($7).
Pizzas are crusty (a 9-inch pie, $6) and toppings (each $1) include
``whatever is in the kitchen.'' 11 a.m.-2 a.m. Mondays-Saturdays.

   Q: I am looking for Lestoil household cleaner. I have found it
occasionally at Drug Emporium.
</P>
<P>
   _ Syresa Pilcher, Covington (Ga.)
</P>
<P>
   Another Lestoil request: I am looking for Lestoil, a liquid
cleaner that I could always find in Massachusettes but not here in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   _ Laurie Smith, Marietta (Ga.)
</P>
<P>
   Yet another Lestoil plea: Harris Teeter in Alpharetta used to
carry Lestoil, the concentrated cleaner. When I went to replace my
supply, it was gone from the shelf. It's the best spot remover, and
now I can't do my laundry without it.
</P>
<P>
   _ Chris Claxton, Alpharetta (Ga.)
</P>
<P>
   A: This is a product beloved by many but not widely distributed
by the Clorox Co., since it is not considered a big seller. We
found Lestoil at Publix, 5885 Cumming Highway, Buford
(770-614-8860). It's $2.89 for a 28-ounce bottle. Ask for it at the
special order desk in customer service. If this location is not
convenient, ask your Publix store to order it. The stock number is
89443. Harris Teeter also will order it for you.
</P>
<P>
   According to its fans, Lestoil will clean everything from
floors, walls and kitchen appliances to oil, food and ink stains on
clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My wife is looking for a draft stopper, a weighted item to go
at the base of a door.
</P>
<P>
   _ Wes Anderson, Stockbridge (Ga.)
</P>
<P>
   A: You can be a draft dodger and keep your home toasty warm when
the wind blows. We found two different types of door draft
stoppers. The Vermont Country Store catalog has a 42-inch long
sausage-shaped stopper ($15.95, pictured) covered in a navy or tan
leaf pattern. It's filled with aromatic balsam needles, which makes
you think of a stroll through the woods. The catalog also carries a
30-inch long window draft stopper for $13.95. To order:
1-802-362-8440.
</P>
<P>
   Or, visit the Welcome Home store in the Tanger Outlet Mall in
Locust Grove (770-957-1490).
</P>
<P>
   Their 31-inch-long door draft stoppers ($12.99) are stuffed with
polyester and covered in Christmas-themed tapestry prints.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Some years ago, the Faygo soft drink company made a drink
called Rock 'n' Rye. I have looked everywhere and cannot find it.
Do they still make it and where can I buy it?
</P>
<P>
   _ Bet Leamon, Marietta (Ga.)
</P>
<P>
   A: For 92 years, this Michigan-based company has been producing
a line of soda pops. Although not big sellers outside the state,
these flavored drinks have their fans. Original flavors were fruit
punch, strawberry and grape. Rock 'n' Rye has been around since the
early '20s, when, according to the company ``the vanilla and
seltzer drink became a must with a corned beef sandwich.'' This
pop, so called because of the sound made when opening the bottle,
is available in and around the Michigan area. But you can get a fix
via the Internet. Call up www.faygo.com and order your favorite.
Eight 2-liter bottlers are $10.99 plus shipping.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you help me find a great perfume called Molinard de
Molinard? For over 10 years I've asked department stores and
boutiques but to no avail. Last year I saw it in a street shop in
San Francisco but could not go back to get it. Hopefully I can find
it it in this area.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sharon Behre, Duluth (Ga.).
</P>
<P>
   A: We sniffed out your request and came up with several options.
Neiman Marcus in Lenox Square carries the fragrance (3.3 ounce eau
de toilette, $77.50) and the Sephora stores, in Lenox Square and
Gwinnett Place mall, also stock it (1.68 ouce eau de toilette $50;
the 3.3-ounce, $77.50). Debuting in 1929 from the House of Patou,
Molinard de Molinard is a classic floral fragrance, a soft blend of
jasmine and rose.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You would help us lactose-intolerant people if you could tell
us where Rice Dream Supreme ice cream can be purchased.
</P>
<P>
   _ A. C. Kelley, Decatur (Ga.)
</P>
<P>
   A: You can soon enjoy double dips of Rice Dream Supreme nondairy
desserts in such yummy flavors as cappuccino almond fudge, cherry
chocolate chunk, double expresso bean, peanut butter cup and
pralines 'n' dream. A pint is $2.49 at Return to Eden, 2335
Cheshire Bridge Road N.E. (404-320-Eden). Whole Foods Market, 2111
Briarcliff Road N.E. (404-634-7800) also carries the line in a
variety of flavors. A pint is $2.59; a quart is $3.89. Also, you
can order Rice Dream Supreme through Sevananda Community-Owned
Natural Foods Market, 467 Moreland Ave. N.E. (404-681-2831).
</P>
<P>
   What exactly is this stuff? According to company spokeswoman
Ellen Weiser, it's made from brown rice. A patented process enables
the starches in the rice to convert to natural sugars. No other
sweetner is used in the basic receipe. Some flavors contain grain
malts. But no white sugar, fructose, corn syrups or honey are used.
A half-cup serving of this non-cholesterol cool treat contains
about 150 calories and 6 grams of fat. For more information, visit

CREATOR OF MARVEL SUPERHEROES IS READY TO SPIN MORE TALES ONLINE 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By FRANK HOUSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Next to his superheroes, Stan Lee has the most recognizable name
in comic books. The longtime writer and editor for Marvel Comics
helped create, among others, the Fantastic Four, Spider-Man, the
Silver Surfer and the X-Men. In his 60-year career, he has become
perhaps one of the best-read authors in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But ask Lee about his effect on popular culture, not to mention
his influence on the literacy of a couple of generations' worth of
comic-book readers, and his voice takes on a hushed, disbelieving
tone. ``I'm constantly amazed to meet people who grew up reading
these things,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, at age 76, Lee wants to spin his own Web. In December, his
site (www.stanlee.net) will introduce a new comic-style story
called ``The Seventh Portal,'' Lee's first new series since
assuming the publisher's seat at Marvel in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, who is writing all the plot lines for ``The Seventh
Portal,'' said that the five-minute episodes will offer ``the
equivalent of a 10-page comic, but with a lot more detail and a lot
more going on.'' The series is about an international team of beta
testers who are transported through the Internet into another
dimension, where they gain superhero powers and battle the evil
Mongorr.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is that there are seven portals that lead to other
dimensions,'' Lee explained. ``Mongorr has conquered the other six;
the seventh leads to earth. It's up to these heroes to keep him
from finding it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee made his career in pen and ink, and he hopes his online
comics stimulate renewed interest in the paper kind, too. Comics
publishers could use the boost. Marvel's bankruptcy, in 1996, was
only one symptom of an industrywide slump, which occurred after a
brief speculative boom in the early '90s. Sales are back to where
they were 10 years ago, but most observers agree that comic books
have been hurt _ even supplanted _ by home video games and the
arrival of the Internet, technologies that are aimed squarely at
comics' core audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other media, like video games and the Internet, have become
more compelling than comic books in recent years,'' said Gareb
Shamus, chairman of the comic-book fan magazine Wizard.
</P>
<P>
   Like Slate and Salon, original magazines that first appeared on
the Web, comic books have been quietly developing online since
1996, with artists and writers experimenting with the form in a
variety of ways. Ranging from reproductions to blends of comics and
animation, few have thus far attracted much notice.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nice thing about it is that it's a wide open field,'' said
Buddy Scalera, the online editor of Wizard. ``Nobody has come out
on line with the definitively must-read comic book that everybody
is talking about. If anybody could do it, it probably would be Stan
Lee.''
</P>
<P>
   Marvel's characters landed on America Online in 1996 in a series
of weekly ``Cybercomics,'' and the stories have evolved on the Web
with tales of Spider-Man, Wolverine and several others.
(Cybercomics are also available, after free registration, at
www.marvelzone.com.) New episodes were recently scaled back to a
monthly basis, according to Marvel president and chief executive
Peter Cuneo, and will be tied in more directly with Marvel's
newsstand offerings.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the difficulty facing writers and artists of online
comics is recreating the comic book's particular blend of words and
pictures. Utilizing Macromedia's Shockwave software, Marvel's
Cybercomics have the polish of comic books. Readers guide the
action by clicking through word balloons and following panels.
</P>
<P>
   Although complete with animation, sound effects and background
music, the Cybercomics ``are still very much in the comic book or
strip genre,'' Cuneo said. The result is a cross between comics and
animation with effects that are sometimes superfluous but
occasionally interesting.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in a panel from ``Doom Control,'' a Marvel series
currently running on Macromedia's Shockwave site
(www.shockwave.com), Dr. Doom's ``mechanism for seizing mental
control'' takes over the roof of the Chrysler Building. The
building juts into the frame at an off-angle, and weird electrical
impulses are seen and heard crackling from the device.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Seventh Portal'' promises to move further in the direction
of sophisticated animation, combining aspects of layout with camera
angles and dissolves to simulate motion pictures, Lee said, ``but
with their own superhero comic-book flavor.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Mann, director of the documentary film ``Comic Book
Confidential,'' said he was very interested to see the development
of online art and storytelling. ``The page is completely different
on a computer screen,'' he said. ``You can endlessly scroll down.
The screen itself is a frame.''
</P>
<P>
   Mann has experimented with rendering comic book panels on line.
The CD-ROM version of ``Comic Book Confidential'' includes
reproductions of seminal comic books, on big pages that can be
moved for different views, as well as background information on
major artists, including Lee and his long-time collaborator, the
late Jack Kirby.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Mann said, ``because there are too many bad comics on
line, it is harder to find the good comics.'' One Web-only comic
that has sparked interest within the comics industry is a companion
site to the film ``The Matrix''
(www.whatisthematrix.com/cmp/comicindex.html). Comic-book-style
stories are evolving in the gap between the hit movie and its
planned sequels. Current tales, in prose and comic-book form, are
by writers and artists from Dark Horse, DC and Marvel.
</P>
<P>
   Scott McCloud, a comics creator, theorist and author of
``Understanding Comics,'' a comic book about comic books, has
created several strips on line (www.scottmccloud.com) that explore
the outer reaches of single Web pages, including Choose Your Own
Carl, a reader-guided comic strip that is long on nonlinear
narrative and short on flash.
</P>
<P>
   ``Comics are a kind of temporal map,'' McCloud said. ``As you
move from one inch to the next, you're actually moving from one
moment to the next. That's a really powerful idea, and a really
simple one.'' It's also one that may not be preserved in online
comics, he said. ``The moment you have broadband, you can have full
animation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Can online comics ever match the vitality that sprang from Lee's
dialogue and Kirby's panels? No matter how close they come, of
course, the industry feels secure with its books. ``A computerized
piece of art is going to appeal to different senses,'' said John
Jackson Miller, editor of Comics Retailer. ``It almost takes you
out of the realm of literature. Getting comics to work on the
screen takes a transformation of what the thing is into something
different.''

THE GARDEN CONSERVANCY AIMS TO SAVE SOMEONE ELSE'S VISION  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., N.H., Mass., Italy)   By ANNE RAVER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWBURY, N.H. _ Colette wanted to be buried in her garden with a
sign that said something like, `Here I am, surrounded by le debris
des reves,''' Frank Cabot said, using the French for ``ruin of
dreams.'' Cabot, the founder of the Garden Conservancy, a group
devoted to preserving distinctive American gardens, was musing
about the near impossibility of its mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't easy, trying to sustain the Creator's vision,'' he
said. ``But usually these people are wonderful characters, who have
a coterie of friends. And if those friends can form an ad hoc
charitable company, and hire an inspired horticulturist, they have
a chance of saving the garden.''
</P>
<P>
   The Garden Conservancy has taken on 18 preservation projects
around the country since it began in 1989. It was a 1930s rock
garden at the Fells, a 935-acre estate now known as the John Hay
National Wildlife Refuge, that set off an unusual collaboration
between the conservancy, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the
Forest Society of New Hampshire to not only restore the house and
gardens on the property, but also to use the 700-acre woods as an
education center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh my God, the setting was wonderful,'' Cabot said, recalling
the first time he stood at the top of the rock garden, which
cascades down the slope south of the house and meanders into the
woods as if it had always been there. Lake Sunapee shimmered
through tantalizing breaks in the trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``They needed to open up those vistas,'' Cabot said. ``It would
take people who really knew what they were doing to resuscitate
that rock garden. Then Bill Noble came on the scene with 40
volunteers.''
</P>
<P>
   William Noble, now the director of preservation projects for the
conservancy, is an inspired horticulturist sensitive to the spirit
of a place. The first ``garden'' he weeded on the Hay estate six
years ago, with a group of hardy volunteers, was the woods that
serve as a meditative entrance to the house and gardens.
</P>
<P>
   The gardeners took out hundreds of sugar maple, red oak and
hemlock seedlings to reveal the reindeer moss under white birches,
the hay-scented ferns beneath the beeches. They left things too,
like dead trees the woodpeckers need for shelter.
</P>
<P>
   When visitors come out of the woods, and into the sunny pasture
that overlooks Lake Sunapee, they have experienced one of the deep
pleasures of a country place. The house, with great-paned windows
open to the views and a wide porch, was built in 1891 by John Hay,
who had been an adviser to Abraham Lincoln and ended up as
secretary of state for Presidents William McKinley and Theodore
Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   John Hay, wanting to escape from the Washington summers, bought
this abandoned farmland. He hoped to set up a summer colony for his
friends, similar to the one in Cornish, N.H., where the sculptor
Augustus Saint-Gaudens, the architect Charles Platt and others were
drawn to what reminded them of the Italian lake country. Hay called
his place the Fells, an English word meaning an upland, remote
pasture or moor.
</P>
<P>
   His friends never followed _ though Roosevelt planted a sugar
maple that still stands in the pasture.
</P>
<P>
   ``John Hay was content to plant a few hydrangeas and look at the
lake, and maybe there's a lesson in that,'' Noble said. It was
Hay's son, Clarence, who became the plantsman. As a teen-ager,
Clarence started building his romantic ruins of rock walls,
rhododendrons, climbing roses, a few pergolas and brick walks. He
roamed the woods, observing the native plants and animals. At
Harvard University, he took a course in landscape design with
Frederick Law Olmsted Jr. When he inherited the house at 21, he
hired Italian stone masons to build the walled gardens that his
wife, Alice, wanted for roses, cut flowers and perennials.
</P>
<P>
   But Clarence's triumph was the rock garden, which he started in
1929, using the weathered granite his wife insisted he drag off the
lawn, as well as the flat, lichen-covered stones he found in the
countryside. This was the height of the rock garden fever that
swept through New England from 1910 to 1930, as amateur collectors
competed to grow the rarest, most fragile Alpine plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clarence Hay had been a legendary figure in the rock garden
world,'' Cabot, a rock gardener himself, said. ``And this was a
real amateur rock garden, done by someone who had moved the rocks
himself, who had tried everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Garden historians estimate that two-thirds of America's great
gardens have succumbed to weeds or bulldozers, and Cabot could not
stand to see more disappear. The Garden Conservancy began with four
acres of giant cactuses, succulents and native species that Ruth
Bancroft, now 91, had spent her life creating in Walnut Creek,
Calif. ``I found it a hostile mixture of plants, but it was a great
artistic success,'' said Cabot, who visited with his wife, Ann, in
1989.
</P>
<P>
   He recalled that as they left the garden, he said to Mrs.
Bancroft, ``I hope your family can carry this on.'' She replied
that her children had neither the interest nor the money. So Mrs.
Cabot, who was on the board of the Nature Conservancy, said,
``Well, Frank, why don't you start a Garden Conservancy?''
</P>
<P>
   Why not? Cabot set up a board and scrounged enough money to hire
Antonia Adezio, previously at Wave Hill in the Bronx, as the
executive director. Ten years later, the Garden Conservancy, based
in Cold Spring, N.Y., has 6,000 members and a $1.8 million a year
budget. Its annual Open Days Directory, inspired by the famous
British yellow book of gardens, lists 400 private American gardens
open to the public on certain days. From Oct. 21 through Oct. 24,
the conservancy celebrates its 10th anniversary with a symposium in
Charleston, S.C., examining the American garden.
</P>
<P>
   The conservancy doesn't buy gardens, though it may subsidize
them. It offers technical assistance with a horticulturist who is
sensitive to the garden's original spirit. The conservancy also
helps to develop a board of friends, which can raise money for the
garden and use it as a community resource.
</P>
<P>
   So the question becomes, which gardens are worth saving? Ms.
Adezio sends a committee, led by Marco Polo Stufano, the garden
genius from Wave Hill, around the country to evaluate the gardens.
``Gardens are very personal works of art,'' she continued. ``We
feel you know when you see it.'' Private gardens, unlike botanical
gardens or public parks, are idiosyncratic expressions.
</P>
<P>
   It was their love of the land that prompted Clarence and Alice
Hay to donate 675 acres of woodland to the Society for the
Protection of New Hampshire in 1962. When Clarence died seven years
later, Alice gave the house and gardens to the Fish and Wildlife
Service.
</P>
<P>
   But there were no endangered species in these gardens, and the
federal government had no interest in weeding Alpine plants. ``When
we first started in 1993, the rock garden was overrun with heather
and wild geranium,'' Noble said. As his crew weeded, garden classes
and nature study programs began to grow at the Fells, with the
house increasingly used for education.
</P>
<P>
   The Friends of the John Hay National Wildlife Refuge now runs
the property, with a full-time director, Maggie Stier, and a
full-time gardener, Jeff Good.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves Noble like a hen without his chicks. These days he

AT THE WHEEL, AND AT THE MONITOR

 (Attn: Iowa)   (af)

<P>
   Information overload is never good. At the wheel of a car, it
can be downright hazardous.
</P>
<P>
   As car and truck makers load up on high-tech features, the
dashboard can sometimes become a bewildering array of buttons,
dials and displays. Sprinkle in emerging technologies like
computers for e-mail and Web access, and suddenly there's a lot of
reading matter for a driver to absorb.
</P>
<P>
   One company wants to solve the problem by adding even more
technology. Diversified Software Industries of Iowa City has
developed a system designed to juggle on-board information so
drivers don't have to.
</P>
<P>
   It's called IVIS, for In-Vehicle Information System. Right now
it exists only in the form of prototypes on desktops and in one
demonstration vehicle. As early as 2001 or 2002, 20,000 to 50,000
luxury cars will be offered for sale with the system, in what will
amount to a large-scale test run.
</P>
<P>
   The intent of the system, said Jim Griffin, founder and
president of the company, ``is to consolidate all the different
technology that's coming available in the vehicle now onto a
central display that graphically presents the information.''
</P>
<P>
   A car equipped with the system will have no mechanical dials or
gauges. Instead, the car will have one or two liquid-crystal
displays on the dashboard, ranging in size from 6{ to 11 inches,
measured diagonally, depending on the car manufacturer's
preference. Most of the time, the system will display virtual
reality images of a traditional instrument cluster.
</P>
<P>
   But when the driver needs to consult a map, for example, the
dials and gauges will shrink to the side to make room for a
navigational program. All the information in the car, from the gas
gauge to the driver's address book, will be available on screen.
</P>
<P>
   The control buttons will be mounted on the steering wheel under
the thumbs, making it easy to operate systems like the radio, the
cell phone and air conditioning from one set of controls with
minimal hunting and pecking. Eventually, Griffin said, the buttons
will be all but replaced by a voice activation system.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, the system is designed to assign priorities to
information. If a driver is retrieving e-mail and the engine
temperature suddenly rises to a critical level, the system will
interrupt the e-mail and display a vehicle status warning.
</P>
<P>
   All of that opens the door to more complex way to get
information in cars. The system could be loaded with a database of
travel information on CD-ROMs or have a wireless Internet
connection providing real-time updates on traffic, weather and road
conditions (but no Web-surfing capability, for obvious safety
reasons).
</P>
<P>
   The system is also designed to offer motorists a dose of visual
splash by letting them customize their dashboard displays. If one
driver in the family car likes the wood-grain look of a Jaguar but
another prefers futuristic Star Wars graphics, they will be able to
switch configurations at will.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola has put its money on IVIS in two ways. Last month the
company released a product called Mobile GT, a combined hardware
and operating system that will form the platform to run the system.
And Motorola has also bought an interest in Diversified Software
Industries.
</P>
<P>
   The makes and models of the first IVIS-equipped cars remain
undisclosed, but they will be luxury cars. Like the first airbags
and antilock brakes, this system will be tested on affluent car
buyers. The system's makers hope that the technology will become
more widely available as costs come down.
</P>
<P>
   ``In about five years,'' Griffin predicted, ``it's going to be a
pretty standard option on a vehicle.''

49ERS NEED IMPROVEMENT IN THE TALENT DEPARTMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN CRUMPACKER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA CLARA, Calif. _ Watching the San Francisco 49ers in these
dismal dying days of their dynasty, one thing is painfully obvious:
They don't have enough talent.
</P>
<P>
   Where they once had talent by the bushelful, the basket is
nearly empty now. A few of the greats remain, but they're a tad
superannuated and there aren't enough of them to keep the club
forceful. In 1999, the 49ers are like any other team in the league
struggling against the rising tide of mediocrity.
</P>
<P>
   It's shocking, actually, how far the 49ers have fallen in such a
short time. It seems like only yesterday they had an offense lousy
with Pro Bowl players like tackles Harris Barton and Steve Wallace,
center Jesse Sapolu, tight end Brent Jones, quarterback Steve Young
and wide receivers Jerry Rice and John Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   On defense they used to have Dana Stubblefield teaming with
Bryant Young for a terrific tandem at defensive tackle, linebacker
Gary Plummer controlling the middle and cornerback Eric Davis
defending the pass.
</P>
<P>
   Now they have an older Steve Young near the end of his career
and Rice trying to regain his form after knee surgery. Oh, could
they use a cornerback like Davis today. Or Ronnie Lott or Eric
Wright or even Tim (the Blanket) McKyer, for heaven's sake.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers are needy at so many positions it's tough to decide
where to start. Cornerback might be it, though. It's one of the
four most difficult positions to fill with star quality players,
along with quarterback, left offensive tackle and a pass rushing
defensive end.
</P>
<P>
   During the glut of football games last Sunday, a few television
highlights were shown of Washington Redskins rookie Champ Bailey.
Reaction: So this is what a cornerback looks like.
</P>
<P>
   It's been too long since the 49ers had a quality cornerback, as
evidenced by the club's ranking 29th in pass defense in the league.
Every year it seems there are two or three top cornerbacks
available in the draft. This might be the year to go get one.
</P>
<P>
   But what about the mythical Quarterback of the Future? If Young
never plays again because of repeated concussions, the future is
now. Jeff Garcia might be the finger that shores up the dike but is
he someone to rebuild a once-storied franchise around? Who knows?
What is known is that Garcia is 29 years old and, as of Monday,
weighed 188 pounds. De La Salle has bigger quarterbacks than Jeff
Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got thrown to the wolves with very little practice in our
system,'' coach Steve Mariucci said. ``He's going to get better
every week. His teammates will be more comfortable with him. The
timing and accuracy with the West Coast system takes time. Maybe he
can be a good player in this system. I'm not going to put any undue
pressure on him. There's a chance we could develop him into a
pretty darn good quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Garcia can be the guy who becomes The Man for the 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   He's certainly not lacking in confidence or self esteem.
However, the 49ers are long overdue in drafting a quarterback who
has a reasonable chance of developing into a starter in their
system. No matter how hard he worked when he was here, a Belgian
draft horse like Jim Druckenmiller was never going run like a
thoroughbred.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, what good is a quarterback if he keeps getting
pounded like a tough steak in a cheap diner? It's too late to
benefit Young, but perhaps the 49ers should target an offensive
tackle with the dimensions of a polar bear and make him their top
pick of Draft 2000.
</P>
<P>
   It's no accident that teams with studly tackles generally do
well on Sunday. Consider Tony Boselli at Jacksonville, Orlando Pace
at St. Louis, Larry Allen at Dallas, and Ross Verba at Green Bay.
</P>
<P>
   There's another, less obvious, reason why the 49ers are humping
along at .500 these days: They don't have much team speed. Lawrence
Phillips might be the fastest player on the roster, but he's not
being given much of a chance to show it. Charlie Garner is quicker
than he is fast.
</P>
<P>
   Midget cornerbacks Darnell Walker and Mark McMillian (who was
cut Tuesday) have good speed but they can't cover receivers taller
than Danny Devito! When none of the fastest four or five players on
an NFL team is a wide receiver, that team is officially classified
as slow. You want speed, quickness and rapid response, not the Pony
Express coming in from Sioux Falls during a snowstorm.
</P>
<P>
   Although it's too early to concede the season, the 49ers should
be planning for a future that does not include Steve Young or Jerry
Rice. As Mariucci is wont to say, the time is now.
</P>

NEW PENSION PLANS FACE SCRUTINY FROM CONGRESS, WORKERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By CARL HULSE   
 N.Y. Times Regional Newspaper Group Washington Bureau   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If Corporate America thought the uproar over the
newest trend in pension conversions would subside as employees and
lawmakers took a closer look, it miscalculated.
</P>
<P>
   A recent hearing in Congress and events at IBM demonstrated that
companies have a long way to go in selling what they say are the
obvious advantages of cash balance pensions.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians and employee groups say the retirement plans amount
to age discrimination because they penalize long-time workers by
reducing benefits they would have received under the traditional
approach.
</P>
<P>
   In general, the plans _ designed to appeal to today's mobile
work force _ pay workers a defined amount based on their average
salary rather than the historic method of tying pension benefits to
higher salaries earned in the final years of service. The
difference in retirement income can be substantial.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., a critic of the new retirement
wrinkle, said the impact on older workers represents the ``dark
side'' of a corporate push to reconfigure pension offerings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are talking about workers in the prime of their productive
lives,'' said Leahy. ``Workers who have played by the rules, saved
for their kids' college educations, put away money for their
retirement, who wake up one day and read that the rules by which
they have lived their lives have been changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Worker advocates say the conversion push, which could save the
corporations involved millions of dollars, is all the more
aggravating to workers whose benefits would be reduced because it
is coming during an economic boom.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know that most of their companies are enjoying a period
of unprecedented prosperity and their pension funds are overflowing
with billions of dollars of `surplus' assets,'' said Karen
Ferguson, director of the Pension Rights Center.
</P>
<P>
   Her group contends the conversions are illegal _ a claim
disputed both by the companies and the federal agencies that
regulate pensions. Nonetheless, the hue and cry raised by the
critics is causing members of Congress from both parties and the
Clinton administration to give cash benefit plans a close look.
</P>
<P>
   Some legislation governing them is likely, with several
proposals circulating that would at minimum require companies to
better disclose to workers what they would receive under the old
system compared with the new.
</P>
<P>
   The pension community and the companies believe they are being
unfairly labeled as callous and greedy in the current focus on cash
benefit plans when their goal was mainly to create a pension
package more relevant in today's job climate. They say employees
now stay at a job less than four years, on average, and are not
interested in long-term pensions but want easily understood, easily
transferred benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Chambers, a lawyer for the Association of Private Pension
and Welfare Plans, told Congress companies are not making the
switch to save money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather, companies are moving to hybrid designs because these
plans provide the individual accounts, portability and even accrual
pattern that workers are telling companies that they want,'' said
Chambers. He said an actuarial study found that most workers did
better under the cash balance approach.
</P>
<P>
   He also noted that pension plans are for the most part voluntary
and that companies could rethink their offerings altogether if
Congress places undue restrictions on them. And he said companies
are making the transition easier on employees though a variety of
initiatives, including allowing workers near retirement to stay in
the existing plan if they choose.
</P>
<P>
   IBM was among those companies. Initially, the computer giant
allowed workers within five years of retirement to retain their old
pensions. But after a revolt by its workers, it extended that
option to thousands more. Critics say the opportunity should be
further expanded to anyone eligible for a pension.
</P>
<P>
   Janet Krueger, a former IBM worker now working with the IBM
Employee Benefits Action Coalition, said she was unable to
determine exactly how much her pension was cut through the
conversion, but that it was hefty.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are huge sums of money at stake here as well as the
futures of hundreds of thousand of loyal employees nationwide,''
she told a Senate panel. ``As a society, we need to do what is
fair, what is right and what is just.''

 &HT;    Sheep ranchers say they're being fleeced by market
 &HT;    By Marija B. Vader
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEEKER, Colo. _ In 1951, a steer brought $100 a head at a sale
here, and a rancher could buy a new pickup for $1,700.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, though, that steer brings in $500, but the pickup,
integral to ranch operations, costs $38,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prices haven't quite kept up,'' said Ginny Love, who ranches
here with her husband.
</P>
<P>
   High land prices, low livestock prices and a flood of imports
make it difficult, if not impossible, for newcomers to break into
the ranching business.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing the writing on the wall, some second-generation ranchers
are getting out altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just barely made expenses this year,'' said Tom Theos, 80,
who's ranched in the White River Valley of northwest Colorado since
1926 and whose family owns one of the largest tracts of land in Rio
Blanco County.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad and I and my son have been in this business for 80
years and I haven't seen it this bad in my whole life,'' Theos
said. ``My grandson is interested, but what do you tell him? You
just can't make it.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in the good old days of sheep ranching here, as many as
60,000 to 70,000 head of sheep grazed on the sweet summer grass in
the White River Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Now, that number has dwindled to around 18,000 head.
</P>
<P>
   Oct. 8 saw the last of sheep rancher Gus Halandras' 2,200
animals shipped.
</P>
<P>
   Halandras sold his grazing allotment and his sheep to pay off
the bank and get him out of debt.
</P>
<P>
   After 35 years running sheep in Meeker, he's now officially out
of business.
</P>
<P>
   Simply put, ``I couldn't maintain the bottom line,'' said the
Meeker native whose father immigrated here from Greece.
</P>
<P>
   ``I woke up, the day was bright and beautiful, and I said,
`Damn. I rather enjoyed this for the last 60 years,' '' said
Halandras. In Meeker, it costs between $50 and $60 to raise one
sheep. In New Zealand, whose sheep imports are flooding the U.S.
market, ``I understand they can do it for $12 to $15,'' Halandras
said. ``Even with freight, they can undersell us by dollars, not by
pennies.''
</P>
<P>
   Shearing a sheep costs $2.60 a head, but Halandras said he
received about $2.24 a fleece.
</P>
<P>
   It upset Halandras recently when he picked up a magazine that
featured Italian wool suits advertised at $3,800.
</P>
<P>
   ``In that suit are 3 pounds of raw wool. ... I sold my wool this
year for 28 cents a pound,'' Halandras said. ``I had less than a
dollar in that $3,800 suit.''
</P>
<P>
   Halandras' wife, Christine, worked for years, substitute
teaching and, more recently, working as a caterer and
bed-and-breakfast owner.
</P>
<P>
   One night as she prepared a deposit for two weeks' work with her
catering business, Gus did the same after he sold two years' worth
of wool.
</P>
<P>
   ``His deposit was less than mine,'' Christine said. ``How can
you work this hard unless it's a hobby?''
</P>
<P>
   Many ranchers begin their year with a zero balance at the bank,
and as the bills mount over the year _ for items like gasoline,
wages for their help, car payments, predator control, inoculations,
groceries, feed, taxes, grazing fees, sheep shearers, insurance and
household expenses _ ranchers will draw from their line of credit,
like a revolving loan.
</P>
<P>
   Then, during one or two days a year, when ranchers sell their
lambs and their wool, they'll return to the bank and pay off the
line of credit.
</P>
<P>
   If the weather and the market have been kind, they leave the
bank with a little in their pockets.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes they leave with nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made about $250,000 off the sale of 3,400 sheep,'' Theos
said. ``We owed the bank $191,000 this fall and just barely paid
them off. Now we have to start borrowing again.''
</P>
<P>
   The balance, he said, went to living expenses.
</P>
<P>
   And, if someone wants to break into the business, high land
prices, skyrocketed by out-of-state owners seeking the wide-open
spaces of the American West, make it impossible, Theos and
Halandras agree.
</P>
<P>
   Like Theos, the Halandrases are now looking to the future
generations to either carry on the ranching tradition or get out.
</P>
<P>
   ``If something don't change in the next year, we'll be out of
business,'' Theos said. ``We're one of the oldest people around
here running sheep.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sad. We did everything we could to discourage our kids
from coming back to the ranch, but lo and behold, they're here,''
Christine Halandras said of sons Regas and John, who have some cows
and sheep. ``It's not going to be ranching as Gus and I knew
ranching.''

 &HT;    Kids giggle _ what's the big deal?
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's a rainy morning in Georgia and I'm killing some
time in Atlanta's Hartsfield International Airport waiting for the
monsoon to slacken so my flight to Toledo, Ohio can take off.
</P>
<P>
   I've already browsed a cosmetic shop in search of a miracle, and
picked up a copy of Martha Grimes's latest Richard Jury mystery.
Now there's nothing left to do but eat.
</P>
<P>
   A little restaurant named the Coach's Corner is right next to my
gate. I suspect it's really a sports bar but since it's too early
for booze or baseball, breakfast is being served. I choose a table
next to the window so I can watch the airplanes not going anywhere
during my meal. With a sigh of relief, I unload two carry-on bags
onto the unused second chair and have a seat. The local morning
news is on the television. The weather guy tells me it's raining.
</P>
<P>
   I tune out and focus on the menu. Order something sensible, I
remind myself. Bran flakes and a sliced banana would be good. Root
out some of that bad cholesterol Doc is always on my case about.
</P>
<P>
   Sure. When pigs fly. I'm south of the hash browns border and I
want grits. Lots of it! Bacon, and a tall baking powder biscuit
loaded with strawberry jam, and don't forget the sweet coffee with
extra cream.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, as I'm working my way into a food coma, the
waitress stops by to ask if I need anything else. All I can do is
shake my head, since my mouth is full of grits. She smiles and
turns to leave, but something on the news has caught her attention.
She jabs a finger toward the screen and, in a drawl sweeter than
the preserves I'm smearing on my biscuit, asks, ``Y'all hear about
that where you live?'' I stop chewing long enough to listen with
her.
</P>
<P>
   It seems a couple of elementary schools in the Atlanta area have
yanked 2,300 textbooks from the classroom because some folks (two
of them, I think) are objecting to a full-page reproduction of a
portrait of George Washington crossing the Delaware. I lean in for
a better look. What's the problem?
</P>
<P>
   Wrong river? Is George's hat on crooked? Zippers hadn't been
invented back
</P>
<P>
   then so his couldn't be undone. Well then, what's the problem?
</P>
<P>
   About this time the waitress nudges me with the hand that's not
carrying the
</P>
<P>
   decaf, as she unloads on the television screen. ``Dern fools!
Some folks just don't have enough to do,'' she mutters as she
wanders off. Apparently she'd heard the whole story on the
early-early news. I listen.
</P>
<P>
   The issue seems to be a couple of decorative orbs from George's
watch fob that are resting on his right thigh that just might be
misconstrued by a bunch of goofy fifth-graders as his privates.
Yeah, well, what's new? That's what kids do. We did it when I was
in school. It breaks the monotony.
</P>
<P>
   No textbook ever has been written that doesn't have at least one
whispered
</P>
<P>
   must-see page in it. It's kind of like the Land 'O Lakes butter
carton that if you fold it just the right way the Indian
maiden...never mind. Let the kids find their own like we had to.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, a flock of educators have spent weeks painting out
George's orbs so
</P>

   that no valuable instruction time will be wasted in bringing a
class of giggling kids back to order. Baloney! It'd take about
thirty seconds to point out the absurdity of their
misinterpretation, and if properly applied, could also be a window

about. Like, Hey guys, get over it. That may be what it looks like

<TEXT>
<P>
   At first, it seemed like a typical chat room. A list of people
with names like Lizardog and Lisarae appeared on the computer
screen. Curious visitors came and went. Someone had typed a few
words of hello.
</P>
<P>
   Then Lizardog spoke up _ literally.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's real quiet in here,'' he said, his low gravelly voice
coming through the computer speakers.
</P>
<P>
   His words broke the ice. Soon a man with a British accent chimed
in, followed by the hesitant questions of a middle-aged woman with
a voice that cracked slightly, and the Texas twang of what sounded
like a woman in her 20s.
</P>
<P>
   These were the sounds of the latest in online communication:
voice chat. Instead of typing messages back and forth, people are
talking into their computers and hearing the spoken responses of
others from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   In the last six months, hundreds of thousands of people have
downloaded some version of voice chat software. Some users are
gathering in public chat rooms for free-form conferences, while
others are locking the doors on their chat rooms and having private
conversations. Many people have gravitated toward the technology
for one-to-one talks, using computer speakers and microphones in
much the same way as they would use the telephone, often to avoid
long-distance charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we're seeing instant messaging married to voice, to become
close to a real-time conversation,'' said Mark Plakias, a senior
analyst for the Kelsey Group, a research firm that has been
following trends in online communication.
</P>
<P>
   Voice chat blends the sense of personality that comes through a
phone conversation with the anonymity of online chat. Although
people can still hide behind screen names, their voices speak
volumes about their ages and sexes and where they grew up.
</P>
<P>
   Typed communication is still a large part of voice chats, which
gives them a leg up over traditional phone calls, some analysts
say. In most voice chat systems, people who talk to each other
still have the option of typing messages to those in the chat room.
As one person talks to a group, another might type a few words of
encouragement or jot a thought to a friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can have simultaneous public and private conversations,''
said Paul Matteucci, president and chief executive of Hear Me, a
company based in Mountain View, Calif., that develops voice-chat
software. Business executives might open an online conference call
to negotiate a deal, Matteucci said, and someone might want to send
a private instant message to a lawyer. Or a family might be
gathered on line, he said, and two siblings might prod each other
to tell Grandma a story.
</P>
<P>
   E-commerce and online education are two other areas in which
voice chatting may have an impact, software developers say. A
person with a question about an online purchase will be able to
talk with a customer-service representative without having to get
on the phone. And a professor can hold a group discussion on line
that sounds like a traditional seminar.
</P>
<P>
   The Saddle Brook, N.J., Police Department is even starting to
use voice-chat software to provide another communication channel
between residents and the police. ``Residents can be anonymous,''
said Len Azzarone, an officer who works in the community service
bureau, ``so they might be a little more comfortable and tell us
how they feel.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, voice chat appears to be catching on fastest in chat
rooms that are just like text-based chat rooms except that they are
designed to handle voices, too. To enter one of these rooms, a
person must download software that places a voice-chat window on
the computer screen. Excite and Hear Me offer their own versions of
voice-chat systems. Another is Firetalk, a program designed by a
company called Multitude, based in South San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Like text-based chat rooms, voice rooms can be X-rated. But many
people simply gather on line to tell jokes, try out bird calls,
practice a foreign language, play the guitar or talk sports.
Lizardog and Lisarae say they regularly meet in a Firetalk chat
room to tease each other about the Dallas Cowboys (Lisarae's
favorite football team).
</P>
<P>
   Then there are those who just like to sing. Some of the most
popular online voice chat rooms, in fact, offer online karaoke. On
one recent night, the Karaoke Club at Excite became so crowded that
someone created an overflow room, Karaoke Club 2.
</P>
<P>
   Dizzy-138 was one of the 20 guests in Karaoke Club that night.
She had come to sing ``Faith,'' a song by the alternative-rock band
Limp Bizkit. Her voice had the high pitch and slight shyness of a
teen-ager. Later, she said she was 19, from Montana, and had been
to the Karaoke Club before. ``I like hearing the voices,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Others singing that night included a woman who sounded like
Oprah Winfrey and a man with a thick Italian accent. Sometimes a
man named Knowmaad, who has a penchant for John Denver songs, took
the microphone. He spoke with a slow Southern drawl and had a way
of making everyone in the room more comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone want to sing?'' he asked, a few minutes after launching
into a version of ``Rocky Mountain High.''
</P>
<P>
   Sending voices over the Internet is a relatively old concept, in
Internet years.
</P>
<P>
   Internet telephony companies have been converting sound into
data packets since the mid 1990s, when people saw the potential for
transmitting voice telephone calls over Internet wires instead of
traditional phone lines.
</P>
<P>
   Today, people can make one-to-one calls from a personal computer
to a phone and from a phone to a PC, as long as they have the right
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Internet telephony also occurs from phone to phone: people who
make long-distance calls today may even be using Internet telephony
without knowing it. Many long-distance companies are routing
traffic over the Internet to cut costs, especially for overseas
calls.
</P>
<P>
   Voice-chat systems use the same basic technology as Internet
telephony, but without the telephones. As people found ways to
communicate on their PC's using instant messages, e-mail and chat
rooms, software companies realized that people might be willing to
have spoken conversations using their computers.
</P>
<P>
   On-line game fanatics started the trend. Several of the
companies that provide voice-chat software for general use _ like
Hear Me and Multitude _ once focused entirely on making voice chat
possible for networked games.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Several executives of Hear Me, for example, were college friends
who kept in touch by playing networked computer games like
Warbirds, a World War II flight simulation. They often scheduled
telephone conferences before and after their games to tease one
another about their game-playing prowess.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then we had an epiphany,'' said Adam Frankl, who founded a
voice-chat company that was recently purchased by Hear Maine ``The
hour we spent planning strategy, and the hour we spent gloating
about it, were as much fun as the half-hour we spent playing. So we
said, Let's do this over the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Voice chats do not match the quality of telephone conversations.
Sometimes there are gaps of silence. Voices can be garbled and fade
in and out, making the experience as annoying as talking to someone
on a cell phone with a bad connection.
</P>
<P>
   One recent voice-chat session between two friends in New York
City turned into a stuttering mess, as some words seemed to get
stuck while coming through the speakers. The karaoke session
sounded like an online version of an AM radio station that is not
quite within listening range and riddled with static.
</P>
<P>
   When people first describe a visit to a voice-chat room, they
often compare the experience to a radio call-in show. But there are
subtle differences.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Rusanowsky, the play-by-play radio announcer for the San
Jose Sharks professional hockey team, experimented with voice chat
last spring. He moderated a voice-chat session in which people
could log on anywhere in the world and talk to some of the team's
top players.
</P>
<P>
   He discovered, he said, that people were ``a little less
inhibited'' on line. Instead of asking a question that was being
broadcast indiscriminately across the airwaves, guests knew that
their questions were going to be heard only by the 50 to 75 people
in the chat room.
</P>
<P>
   Rusanowsky also liked the combination of voice and text. During
the chats, he requested that people type their questions, which he
said forced them to think about what they were asking. Then he
edited the questions and repeated them to the whole chat room.
</P>
<P>
   Few people are predicting the demise of typed chats as voice
technology becomes more ubiquitous. Sherry Turkle, a professor at
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who conducts research on
computers and communications, said she expected that text-based
chats would continue to thrive among people who use text to
organize their thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people have rediscovered writing on the Internet,
rediscovered the power of the written word,'' Dr. Turkle said.
``There is still going to be a place for the kind of
self-reflective practice that writing has allowed for.''
</P>
<P>
   What's more, Dr. Turkle said, some people feel the need to
present personas that are different from the images they project in
person, or even through their voices. She said she had once talked
to a woman who said she enjoyed typed chats because she felt
liberated from her voice, which was too high pitched for her own
taste.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our voices reveal us,'' Dr. Turkle said, ``but they don't
always reveal the truth of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the advent of voice on the Internet also has its dark side,
which Rusanowsky encountered when he was moderating the hockey
sessions. Sometimes, he said, ``wise guys'' would come in and yell
obscenities. Fortunately, technical assistants from Hear Me, the
company that set up the voice chat, helped him by kicking out
people who were acting up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gets really, really fun at its best,'' said Knowmaad, one
of the karaoke singers, in a text chat.
</P>
<P>
   ``At its worst, it's 15-year-olds singing Britney Spears and
Backstreet Boys over and over again. And at its very worst, it's
kids cursing on line because they can.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be a bit unsettling to parents who do not want their
children innocently logging into a chat room and suddenly hearing
obscenities through the computer speakers, or even being lured into
a conversation with a stranger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do have very mixed emotions,'' said Arrazone, of the Saddle
Brook police, who is also a father. ``Hearing is a lot different
than seeing typing.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, hearing voices may be safer than reading text,
said Richard H. Dym, vice president of marketing for Tribal Voice,
a software company that creates voice-chat and text-to-voice
software. ``The advantage of voice chat is that you have a much
better idea of who you are talking to,'' Dym said.
</P>
<P>
   In voice chats, for example, it is much easier to determine who
is a child, a man or a woman _ that is, until someone comes up with
voice-masking software.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the cacophony of voices seems entirely genuine. When a
person who called himself Good Guy appeared in the karaoke club, it
became clear right away that he was, in fact, a guy. ``OK, here I
go,'' he said in a low voice.
</P>
<P>
   In the background, visitors could hear strains of the music to
``Straight From the Heart'' by Bryan Adams. Someone yelled, ``Hit
it,'' and Good Guy started to sing.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone with a sound-enabled computer, a microphone and a speaker
can engage in online voice messages and conversations. There are
many versions of voice-chat software available, ranging from
systems that store and relay one-to-one voice messages to those
that make full chat rooms possible. Some systems are available only
as stand-alone applications that can be downloaded from the
Internet. Others are integrated into traditional text-based chat
systems, like Yahoo Messenger, although they still require
downloading some sort of plug-in. And a small number of systems are
being integrated into Web pages so that visitors to the page can
engage in conversation with others there after they download the
software. In most cases, the systems are free (although the vast
majority work only on Windows machines.) Here are several options.

BULK BUYING MEETS THE AUCTION BLOCK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y.)  (af) 
 By MICHELLE SLATALLA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For me, the concept of bulk buying has always conjured up images
of cold warehouses filled with shoppers wrestling with mammoth
containers of mayonnaise or struggling toward their cars under the
weight of a pallet of canned green beans.
</P>
<P>
   A new breed of online shopping sites offers a novel twist on
bulk buying, a version that doesn't involve lugging around
six-gallon drums of peanut butter. Sites like Mercata, Accompany
and (scheduled to start next month) Act Big are bringing shoppers
together to form groups to make large-volume purchases on hundreds
of items, like computer equipment and baby supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Although each site operates differently, the principle is the
same: the more shoppers who agree to buy a certain item, the lower
the price goes. For instance, last week at Accompany
(www.accompany.com), the first five shoppers who wanted to buy
Nintendo Gameboy Color could pledge to purchase it for $56.95
apiece. If 10 buyers pledged, the price would drop further.
</P>
<P>
   To reach Accompany's rock-bottom price, $49.95, a minimum of 21
buyers would have had to pledge. Then everyone, even the shoppers
who had signed up back when the price was higher, would have paid
only $49.95.
</P>
<P>
   The caveat? The price may never drop; in fact, on the half-dozen
items I monitored at both sites last week, only one dropped (by
less than $2). And, I had assumed, once I pledged to buy an item, I
was committed to buy.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, the risk didn't seem great. The opening prices
(before any bulk discounts) at the Accompany and Mercata sites seem
competitive with other available prices, both off and online. But
there are hidden costs.
</P>
<P>
   Accompany's Gameboy cost an extra $4.99 for shipping and 35
cents for insurance. (Accompany plans to offer free shipping until
the end of the year.) Since Accompany's items are shipped directly
from suppliers, a shopper who lives in a state where a supplier is
located would have to pay sales tax.
</P>
<P>
   I decided to try out Mercata (www.mercata.com), which offers
free shipping and ships items from warehouses in Pennsylvania and
Washington, so I could avoid the sales tax, as well. Mercata was
also enticing new shoppers with $50 of credit that could be used to
pay up to half the price of any item. (Mercata also offers some
products at discounted, non-negotiable prices.)
</P>
<P>
   Mercata advertised a 32-inch JVC set (model number 32050, with
all the features my gadget-addicted husband craved) for $744.80,
well below the manufacturer's suggested price of $849.99. And the
price could conceivably go even lower if enough buyers signed on.
Plus, with my new-shopper credits, I could drop the price to
$696.50.
</P>
<P>
   I wavered for three days, returning to the site to check to see
if the price dropped; it never did. I then began to wonder how many
other shoppers like me were out there, unwilling to be the first
ones to take the plunge.
</P>
<P>
   I suspected there were quite a few, which was confirmed by
Jonathan Ehrlich, Accompany,'s vice president of marketing, who
said that two kinds of buyers frequent bulk sites: people who
really, really want a specific product and people who want it only
if it's a great deal. The first kind of buyer helps drive down the
price.
</P>
<P>
   If too many of the people who visit the site are like me _
customers who hover but do not commit _ the price will never drop.
The lesson here would seem to be this: unless you're comfortable
with the first, undiscounted price quoted on a bulk site, you
shouldn't pledge.
</P>
<P>
   Restless, I began some comparison shopping. One online merchant,
Intec, advertised a price of $630 and was coincidentally
headquartered in Hicksville, N.Y., near where I live. I phoned
Intech's toll-free number and reached Ken Yokel, the company's
president, who told me that I could avoid shipping costs by picking
up the television at the company's nearby warehouse. Yokel also
offered me an additional 5 percent off the purchase price if I paid
in cash. Total, with sales tax: $647.88.
</P>
<P>
   Smug about finding a good deal, I invited my friend Nancy Bendit
(widely considered the best bargain shopper of her generation)
along to witness my triumph. Instead, she was present as I was
humiliated twice: first when the television would not fit into my
Honda Civic without first being unpacked from the box and later
when I panicked that the hulking monster was bigger than my
cabinet. (``You didn't measure?'' she asked. Nancy carries a tape
measure on her key ring.)
</P>
<P>
   At that point, I realize that I had come full circle, standing
behind a chain link fence in a warehouse, waiting to take delivery
of an unseen item.
</P>
<P>
   It was not, however, a complete defeat for bulk-buying sites.
Unknown to me when I first used Accompany, the site offers Buyer
Flash, which will notify you if the price drops to a certain level.
Mercata will allow hoverers to make conditional bids _ you pledge
to buy an item at a certain price, and if it drops to your price,
you must buy. Otherwise, you don't have to buy.
</P>
<P>
   The larger point about bulk sites, about all online shopping, is
that whether you are shopping online or off, if you start your
search on the Internet, you will be much better informed and can
potentially arm yourself with a target price to use as leverage.
</P>
<P>
   The same JVC model was marked $749 at a P.C. Richards store a
mile from the warehouse; when I told a salesman I could get it
cheaper on the Internet, he dropped the price to $680.89 including
sales tax. Forget the days when shoppers lived in a great
information vacuum, at the mercy of local retailers with limited
selection and confusing pricing policies.
</P>
<P>
   If I sound cocky, it may be because the 32-inch television fit
in my cabinet. With a quarter-inch to spare.

   Walkin' the Dog
</P>
<P>
   by Walter Mosley
</P>
<P>
   Fiction
</P>
<P>
   Little, Brown, $24.95
</P>
<P>
   While walking his two-legged dog, Killer, Socrates Fortlow meets
Lavant Hall, a purple-clad, perfumed thief, rebel and philosopher.
That climactic encounter proves to be a defining moment in the life
of the protagonist of Walter Mosley's latest and best novel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Walkin' the Dog'' is an elaboration on the themes and
characters Mosely introduced in the tantalizing web of vignettes
``Always Outnumbered, Always Outgunned.'' The shorter work set the
table for the rich repast of the fully developed novel in the same
way that ``Gone Fishin' '' would have whetted the appetite for the
mystery thriller ``Devil in a Blue Dress,'' had the novella been
published first.
</P>
<P>
   Fortlow is angry at the beginning of ``Dog,'' having been kept
awake much of the night by the haunting music of an unseen trumpet
player, whose strains evoked poignant childhood memories and the
dark reflections of an inscrutable aunt on the existential
predicament of black men.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he gets to the supermarket where he works, the
ex-convict and murderer is primed to commit homicide again. Only
the intervention of store manager Marty Ganzalez saves his
immediate supervisor, who chided Fortlow for being late, from
feeling the brunt of the ex-con's pent-up rage.
</P>
<P>
   Violence has been a way of life for Fortlow. He has spent most
of his adult life in prison for a double murder and rape. While a
guest of the Indiana penal system, Fortlow killed repeatedly to
survive. During the nine years he has been out of prison and living
in Watts, Fortlow has constantly had to struggle to keep his rage
on a leash _ like his misnamed dog, Killer, who is really a gentle
beast.
</P>
<P>
   The very fact that Fortlow has saved and taken care of Killer
after the animal had its hind legs destroyed by an automobile
indicates clearly that there is more to him than being a murderer.
So does his surrogate parenting of a street kid named Darryl; his
love for the deceased, philosophical friend Right Burke; his
affection for Iula, his part-time lover; and his rescue of Hoagland
Mars, the destitute wino trumpet player whose bittersweet
intonations have mesmerized him.
</P>
<P>
   By the time a gigantic young mugger assaults him in an alley, an
enormous moral transformation has occurred in Fortlow. Forced to
kill the mugger in self-defense, the man who has killed several
times before and felt no remorse is consumed by guilt.
</P>
<P>
   But the ultimate evidence of the change in him occurs when,
having decided to kill a cruel and corrupt police officer, he finds
another way to get justice _ a way influenced by his fateful
meeting with Lavant Hall while walking Killer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Walkin' the Dog'' invites favorable comparison to Ralph
Ellison's ``Invisible Man.'' In fact, Mosely invites that
comparison by having Hall mention Ellison's acclaimed novel.
Socrates Fortlow, like Ellison's protagonist, lives in a makeshift
sleeping and eating space between two buildings.
</P>
<P>
   His is a shadowy existence. And the novel is about his coming
out of those shadows, like Plato's man in the cave, and coping with
reality.
</P>
<P>
   This is Mosely's finest achievement in prose. It has all the
lyricism, lush imagery and humor of his splendid mysteries. But it
transcends them in that it does not depend upon the devices of a
suspense thriller to keep the reader enraptured.
</P>
<P>
   Moseley has crossed the threshold from excellent storytelling
into literature with this work. If the reading public is fortunate,
it has not heard the last of Socrates Fortlow.

A DARKLY MYTHIC WORLD FROM JAPAN ARRIVES IN HOLLYWOOD 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By RICK LYMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Admirers of Japanese animation, including many of
the leading figures in the American animation community, get a
certain catch in their voices when they mention the name Hayao
Miyazaki, as though describing someone not quite human, like one of
the ghostly forest spirits who populate his work.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a pure filmmaking standpoint, his staging, his cutting,
his action scenes are some of the best ever put on film, whether
animated or not,'' said John Lasseter, director of ``Toy Story,''
``A Bug's Life'' and the upcoming ``Toy Story 2.'' ``Watching one
of his films is the best medicine when you have writer's block.
When we at Pixar feel that we're beating our heads against the
wall, we go in the screening room and put on a laser disc and watch
one of his films and it's like, whoa, look what he did. It's
inspiration to power through that brick wall.''
</P>
<P>
   Barry Cook and Tony Bancroft, co-directors of the Disney
animated feature ``Mulan,'' said simply in a recent tribute:
``Miyazaki is like a god to us.''
</P>
<P>
   So it's a little disconcerting to find the great man himself,
seated quietly on an outdoor patio at the Four Seasons Hotel, a
pack of cigarettes nearby, his plain dress shirt open at the
collar, a cascade of salt-and-pepper hair hanging across his
forehead and an oblique grin on his face. A translator is nearby,
as are three or four aides (their faces and numbers shift as they
blend in and out of the surrounding tropical foliage) and a handful
of publicists and representatives from Miramax, the company that
will distribute ``Princess Mononoke,'' the legendary animator's
latest work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that we must betray the expectations of the audience
in order to keep them,'' Miyazaki said as those around him hung on
every word. ``The best thing is to try to make a movie that you
don't have a clue how to make.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Princess Mononoke,'' which opened in Japan in 1997, earned
more than $150 million and became the most popular Japanese film
ever to be released in that country and second only to ``Titanic''
on Japan's all-time box-office list. It was only the latest in a
string of critical and popular successes for Miyazaki, 58.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Miyazaki is largely unknown in the United States, outside of
a small, cultlike following, most likely because until recently his
films could be obtained only with difficulty and only in the
original Japanese. Recent efforts to introduce the films of Studio
Ghibli, the animation company that Miyazaki founded with his
longtime associate, Isao Takahata, in 1985, in English-dubbed
versions have begun to lift the veil.
</P>
<P>
   Now, many admirers are hoping that the release of ``Princess
Mononoke'' with a new English script and a major American
distributor will finally get Miyazaki the wider recognition he
deserves when the film opens Oct. 29 in New York and three other
cities. Wider distribution is to follow Nov. 5.
</P>
<P>
   Miramax certainly has high hopes for the release of this dubbed
``Mononoke'' _ especially with its English-language script by Neil
Gaiman, a novelist and author of adult-oriented comic books and
himself a highly respected figure in the animation world, and the
participation of such actors as Billy Crudup, Claire Danes, Minnie
Driver, Billy Bob Thornton and Gillian Anderson. But no one expects
it to turn into the smash phenomenon that it was in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Like most of Miyazaki's work, it is too long, too sprawling, too
darkly nuanced and, ultimately, too unresolved for that. ``It does
not have the cathartic ending where the hero conquers the villain
and justice wins the day,'' Miyazaki said. ``And it is too long,
more than two hours, which is difficult, no matter how brilliant
you make it. I tried, but the film would not allow me to make it
shorter.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are hopes that the film, even if it is not a
commercial blockbuster, will expand the audience for sophisticated
Japanese animation in the United States and maybe even lure people
into sampling the rest of Miyazaki's work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether it's going to be a commercial success, I don't know
and I don't care,'' Gaiman said. ``I'm just proud of being a part
of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gaiman said his goal for the ``Mononoke'' script was dialogue
``that didn't sound like Saturday morning cartoons'' and that gave
American audiences as close as possible the richly textured
experience that Japanese audiences had. The challenge was to match
his dialogue to a finished film: he tried to be scrupulous about
writing lines that required no more mouth movements than were in
the movie. Normally, dialogue is recorded before a film is animated
so that the drawings can match the sound, but with a dubbed version
this is not possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, I would come up with a really beautiful line that
would take four or five mouth movements and I would only have
three,'' he sighed. ``So it had to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Gaiman said he did all of this without meeting the animator.
Indeed, the two did not meet until last month, in New York. ``I
nervously went over and asked him for his autograph,'' Gaiman said.
``He gave me a hug and told me how pleased he was.''
</P>
<P>
   Nervous? Why was he nervous?
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, I was terrified,'' Gaiman said. ``Why? Because he is
Miyazaki.''
</P>
<P>
   Miyazaki's work is praised not merely for its scope and
ambitious themes, but also for its filmmaking virtuosity, the way
it subtly expands upon the conventions of live-action filmmaking,
especially in his action scenes (he is particularly famous for his
flying sequences), which rush across the screen with a vertiginous,
roller-coaster intensity.
</P>
<P>
   And there is also the simple issue of artistry. ``People ask me
what my favorite moment is in `Princess Mononoke,' and I tell them
it's when you see a rock and a raindrop hits it, and then another
raindrop and then another and then it's slick with water and it's a
moment of simply unutterable beauty,'' Gaiman said. ``Sometimes the
point of what you are seeing is simply that what you are seeing is
beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   Miyazaki was born in 1941 to a well-to-do family. His father was
the director of Miyazaki Airplane, which made rudders and wing tips
for Japanese Zero fighters. He remembers making drawing after
drawing of airplanes and battleships as a youth, but when he began
to seriously entertain the idea of becoming an animator he found
that he was clumsy at drawing people.
</P>
<P>
   So he became a political science and economics major at
Gakushuin University, where he also became a Marxist, remaining
there until the late 1980s. In 1957 he saw his first Japanese
animated feature and decided that this was what he wanted to do.
After graduating in 1963, he joined the staff at Toei Doga, the
largest animation studio in Asia.

DADDY'S LITTLE GIRL WILL MAKE HER OWN DECISIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ERIC CELESTE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have you heard about this professional tart, Melissa Joan Hart?
She plays the lead character in the rather wholesome TV show
``Sabrina, the Teenage Witch.'' She was beloved as the sainted,
taintless lead on the Nickelodeon program ``Clarissa Explains It
All.'' Now, however, she has upset her employers and some of her
fans by baring too much of her 23-year-old figure in a suggestive,
underwear-clad manner. Pick up the recent covers of national
magazines ``Maxim'' and ``Bikini,'' and you'll see what I mean.
</P>
<P>
   In response to her employer's outrage, Ms. M.J.H. explained her
actions thusly. ``I'm a pretty open person,'' she told ``USA
Today.'' ``I don't have much to hide.''
</P>
<P>
   One more perusal of said magazines proves her point.
</P>
<P>
   However, let us not let her seemingly airtight explanations
distract us parents from the point at hand. As the responsible
father of a young, impressionable girl, I think it's my duty to
weigh in on the controversy.
</P>
<P>
   My official statement to Ms. M.J.H.: ``You go, girl.''
</P>
<P>
   Space allowing, I would like to add the following: ``You lookin'
`fine,' girl-fren.''
</P>
<P>
   When I issued those sentiments to several female colleagues,
they immediately struck up a fascinating discourse. ``You
contemptible man-pig!'' was the phrase most often bandied. Several
of these lay-philosophers went on to ask that I consider the
following hypothetical: ``What if that were YOUR daughter? Huh?''
</P>
<P>
   Ignoring the fact that this would never happen _ what swimsuit
magazine wants to put on its cover a picture of a 5-year-old
wearing her pink, daisy-covered one-piece, complete with the
headline ``Hart Attack!''? _ I decided I should address the issue
in this column. That way, if you want to yell at me, too, you're
well-informed to do so.
</P>
<P>
   I admit that every father is uncomfortable with the inevitable
transformation of his daughter from innocent, pony-tailed little
girl to full-blown woman. For example, I don't like it that she
will, most likely, one day date boys, because I was a boy, and I
knew many boys; trust me, boys are no good. Even the sweet ones,
the ones who get good grades and floss and pray before bedtime, are
trouble. OK, they're not bad per se, but they become bad when
paired with girls. They lure girls with promises of prom dates and
Backstreet Boys concerts, they belch, they break hearts _ they
flat-out do not add to the collective emotional maturity of our
species. They're like killer bees; you can't stop them, so you must
regretfully learn to live with them.
</P>
<P>
   So, yes, it drives me and every father I know crazy that,
someday, sooner than we think, our precious little daughters will
become ... you know ... grown-up type people who ... may have ...
desires that are ... not exactly childlike.
</P>
<P>
   And, for the record, if she wants to be a nun, I'm down with
that. We're Baptists, but I'm sure there are loopholes.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, I am fully able to separate my paranoia over my
daughter's entrance into womanhood and her right to make big-time
coin showing off the results of the perfect genetic coding her
parents passed on to her. If she were 23 and wanted to flaunt her
Celeste-ness on national magazine covers, I could only hope that
she would be doing it for the right reasons. To financially support
her old man, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   Would it make me nuts? Of course. If my creepy friends made
suggestive comments to me, would I knock the holy snot out of them?
You betcha. But does my reaction mean she shouldn't do what she
wants at 23? I hope not. Because if she is forever forbidden from
doing things that will turn me into a
freakazoid-come-on-and-wind-me-up, then she better never bring her
high-school sweetheart over. For when I meet Brad or Jake or Cody,
the captain of the swimming team with perfect teeth who just bought
his own Chrysler with money he made building orphanages who wants
to take my little girl to the movies, I will not see him; I will
see only a ``man-pig.'' And something tells me that might make it
hard for her to get a date. .MDUL/.MDNM/ (Visit the Star-Telegram's

   ``Dismissing God''
</P>
<P>
   By D. Bruce Lockerbie
</P>
<P>
   Baker, $15.99
</P>
<P>
   If it seems that the attitude of many authors during the past
100 years has gone from ``Is there a God?'' to ``God? How quaint''
to ``God? You idiot!,'' then D. Bruce Lockerbie has news for you: A
lot of writers do think that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do artists ... seem to need to adopt the stance of a
bantam bully picking a fight with an oversized and reluctant deity
...?'' the Long Island author asks. And further, ``What, if any,
value can the believer find in the art of the unbeliever, the
nonbeliever, the disbeliever?''
</P>
<P>
   Lockerbie surveys the work of more than a dozen prominent
writers, including Emily Dickinson, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Mark
Twain, James Joyce and Ernest Hemingway. The critique is far from
flatly condemnatory, but Lockerbie's comments can bite nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dismissing God'' provides a much-needed viewpoint from an
author who gives evidence of knowing his material. Although one
need not be on campus to benefit from this book, Lockerbie's work
would be a highly appropriate text for a college literature course.
Any takers, faculty?

   ``True North''

   Twila Paris
</P>
<P>
   Sparrow Records
</P>
<P>
   Twila Paris is without peer in Christian music circles as a
lyricist and vocalist, as her 19-year career, 15 albums, 27 No. 1
songs and numerous awards will attest.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Peacock is one of the best producers in the business,
having worked with the likes of Avalon, Audio Adrenaline and
Margaret Becker.
</P>
<P>
   It follows that a collaboration between the two should yield
something special, and indeed it does.
</P>
<P>
   The Peacock-produced ``True North'' is Paris' first adult
contemporary album in almost three years, and a departure from her
previous pop fare.
</P>
<P>
   Not a radical departure. She hasn't done a Pat Boone and covered
heavy-metal tunes. But from the opening jazzy guitar riffs on ``Run
to You,'' the first song, it's obvious that something's a little
different.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Paris might have been perceived as a pre-eminent
inspirational artist who also did a pretty good job in her forays
into the adult contemporary field. ``True North,'' though, is on a
par with anything done by pop stars such as Amy Grant, Cheri Keaggy
or Cindy Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   That is, the sound is on a par with anyone else's. Paris never
has taken a back seat to anyone when it comes to her lyrics, and
this album is no exception. The title cut refers to a Christian's
moral compass, and how the pull of our culture competes with God's
true north.
</P>
<P>
   Combine Paris' usual outstanding lyrics with a Peacock-produced
pop sound, and the result is an outstanding album.

UNDATED: in Asia. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eventually Miyazaki left Toei, first to join another company,
then to try to start his own, all the while building his reputation
as an animator until, in 1984, with ``Nausicaa of the Valley of the
Wind,'' he drew serious international recognition. The story, set
in a future where the world has been poisoned by industrial waste
and other ecological horrors, is about a young girl in the
wilderness fighting giant insects and clashing tribes. (As a
tribute, the makers of the television series ``Star Trek: The Next
Generation'' named one of their alien races Nausicaans.)
</P>
<P>
   On the strength of the film's success, Miyazaki helped found
Studio Ghibli, where except for one brief and unsuccessful attempt
to retire, he has worked ever since.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nausicaa'' was followed in 1986 by ``Laputa: The Castle in the
Sky,'' a science-fiction adventure with some stunning action
sequences. Then, in 1986, he released ``My Neighbor Totoro,'' about
a pair of Japanese children who move to the countryside when their
mother falls ill ( Miyazaki's own mother was bedridden for nine
years) and who discover a world of forest spirits. His 1989
action-adventure, ``Kiki's Delivery Service,'' was the biggest box
office hit of the year in Japan, but an even bigger success was
1992's ``Porco Rosso,'' a strange adventure about a biplane pilot
with the face of a pig ( Miyazaki often draws himself with a pig's
face) who battles smugglers in the skies over the Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
   And then ``Princess Mononoke'' in 1997. A sprawling adventure
that runs for more than two hours, it is Miyazaki's first Japanese
period piece, set during the Muromachi period (1392-1573) and
drawing on the era's folk tales, though its central characters are
outcasts and working people rather than the samurai and village
elders that normally populate such stories. The film's hero is a
young prince forced into exile who comes to the edge of a
wilderness where a fortresslike community of iron forgers is in
conflict with the aging animal spirits in the surrounding forest.
There, he meets Mononoke, a wild-child who lives with the animal
spirits and is a kind of echo of the young girl in ``Nausicaa.''
</P>
<P>
   At first, the animator said, it was he who resisted the idea of
allowing someone to write an English script for a dubbed version.
He was not convinced that the film's strong Japanese elements would
translate for American audiences. ``All I have is a vague sense of
the lives and dreams that American children have,'' he said. he was
also uncertain that young American audiences, accustomed to lighter
fare, would be willing to embrace a film that is, at its deepest
level, somewhat despairing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that if you are very genuine in doing films for young
children, you must aim for their heads, not deciding for them what
will be too much for them to handle,'' Miyazaki said. ``What we
found was that the children actually understood the movie and what
we were trying to say more than the adults.''
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, he said, ``Mononoke'' was never sold as a children's
film, though he envisioned his ideal audience as anyone over the
age of 10. The downbeat tone is a mirror of the world children
actually face, he said. ``I wanted to be honest with the young
audience, to tell them that human society is not fundamentally
blessed,'' he said. ``I do this not out of a desire to reassure
children, just to say that this is the world that we all live in,
children and adult, that we share this despair.''
</P>
<P>
   That oblique smile again.
</P>
<P>
   He hopes American audiences will embrace ``Mononoke'' and,
perhaps, develop an appetite for more sophisticated animation.
``But you know, I hope the same thing for Japanese audiences,'' he
said. Bad animation is a problem the world over, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Why is that? He shrugged.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are too many animators making junk,'' he said. ``And too
many people who want to see junk.''

 &HT;    SOLARIZED SOIL REDUCES PLANT DISEASES
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When a critical farm chemical is banned by the
Environmental Protection Agency, vegetable farmers in South Georgia
and Florida may have a simple way to rid the soil of plant diseases
and weed seeds _ by cooking them.
</P>
<P>
   Experiments at the U.S. Agricultural Research Service
Horticultural Research Laboratory in Fort Pierce, Fla., have
demonstrated that sheets of clear plastic laid over the soil trap
enough solar heat to kill most of the harmful organisms.
</P>
<P>
   For years farmers have used methyl bromide to destroy weed seed,
plant diseases and nematodes, the microscopic worms responsible for
billions of dollars in crops losses, in the soil.
</P>
<P>
   However, the chemical is known to destroy ozone when it
evaporates from the soil and floats to the stratosphere. As a
result, the Environmental Protection Agency has announced it will
ban its use in 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel O. Chellemi, an ARS plant pathologist at the Ft. Pierce
laboratory, has shown that the plastic traps heat in the soil in a
greenhouse effect. Employed for at least six weeks during the
summer, the system can kill off weed seeds and diseases that would
otherwise wreck a winter crop, Chellemi said.
</P>
<P>
   The system has its limitations. For example, it cannot be used
for spring crops because the plastic must lie on the soil for at
least six weeks prior to planting, and in the winter before spring
crops are planted there is insufficient heat for the system to
work.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Chellemi applied the treatment to four commercial farms
in Florida. On three of the farms, yields on solarized fields
ranged from 96 to 123 percent of those from methyl bromide-treated
fields. A comparison was not possible on the fourth farm, operated
by Vero Beach organic grower Kevin O'Dare, because O'Dare does not
use methyl bromide or any other chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say enough for it,'' O'Dare says of the plastic
treatment, which Chellemi calls ``solarization.'' The weed purple
nutsedge was close to taking over the 10 acres of O'Dare's Osceola
Organic Farm when he turned to solarization.
</P>
<P>
   After two years, he said, ``our production was up 30 percent,
our labor was down 75 percent, and our profits were up 100
percent.''
</P>
<P>
   The solar sheets are not a perfect replacement for methyl
bromide, notes University of Florida horticulture professor Steve
Olson, who has collaborated with Chellemi.
</P>
<P>
   For example, it is not particularly effective against the
nematode that causes ``root knot,'' he said. These worms burrow
into plant roots, and intercept nutrients moving up to the plants
stems and leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Olson has worked with tomato growers Dale and Greg Murray of
Decatur County, Ga., on a solarization approach that also use small
amounts of approved chemical to destroy the nematodes.

PRO SKATER IS A WHEEL DEAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MALCOLM MAYHEW 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Skateboarding without all the scrapes, bruises, bloodied elbows
and police tickets _ music to Mom's ears.
</P>
<P>
   That's what ya get with Tony Hawk's Pro Skater (Activision for
Sony PlayStation, $40, age 13 and up), not the first but definitely
one of the best skateboarding video games.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the top skateboarders from around the country _ I didn't
know there was such a thing as a national ``top skateboarder,''
either _ are featured, complete with their signature moves, such as
Tony Hawk and Rune Glifberg's vertical-skateboarding flip-flop
jumps, which'll make your knees hurt just watching.
</P>
<P>
   Gamers can compete or skate around different environments. Every
skateboarder's dream comes true on one level that allows the player
to burn rubber all over the hood of a police car.
</P>
<P>
   The game is rated age 13 and up, not for violence or close-ups
of skinned shins but for coarse language _ we dock it a star for
stereotyping.
</P>
<P>
   Education and tearing stuff up have never mingled so well as
they do on Construction Zone (Mattel Media, $40, age 5 and up), a
really cool game for kids that lets 'em drive around in those big
yellow Caterpillars.
</P>
<P>
   This is such a great idea: Players climb aboard one of six
Caterpillars to take on a series of missions, ranging from
demolishing an unsafe building to repairing a busted pipe below the
city streets (cars are honking at ya and stuff, too) to clearing
rocks from farmland.
</P>
<P>
   Construction's main goal is to teach young gamers how to follow
directions _ but that doesn't mean it's just a kid's game. The
graphics are realistic enough and the game play challenging enough
to interest gamers of all ages.
</P>
<P>
   They've rereleased and repackaged Donkey Kong, Pac Man and
Asteroids. Wonder what took 'em so long to get around to Space
Invaders. More like it: Wonder why they even bothered.
</P>
<P>
   Activision's version of a game that really wasn't all that great
to begin with is, naturally, a stinker. Space Invaders (Activision
for PlayStation, $30, all ages) is basically the same game with a
new face: better graphics (well, how could you do worse than the
original?), a few added features (new ``worlds'' and power-ups or
some such) and multiplayer options. Oh, yippie _ I can play with a
friend!
</P>
<P>
   And guess what the ``hidden'' level is? Yep, the original
version, which, depressingly enough, is a lot better than the new
one. And that's not saying a whole lot.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the wind ceased on the island of Antigua shortly
after reaching a speed of 102 mph as the eye of hurricane Jose
passed overhead. Thursday, Jose will grind toward the northwest,
tracking just to the north of Puerto Rico. This will bring squalls
of heavy rain and high surf to the island during a portion of
Thursday. A vigorous southwest to northeast flow in the jet stream
will cause the storm to eventually veer toward the north and
northeast, sparing the U.S. East Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Dry weather will cover much of the nation Thursday, though
scattered showers and spotty thunderstorms will surround a
stationary front stretching from the Gulf of Mexico to near the
southern Middle Atlantic Coast. A few of the showers will be heavy,
which may lead to local flooding across the Florida peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   Sinking air currents associated with high pressure will bring
abundant sunshine to the Northeast. After a cool start, afternoon
readings will rebound toward seasonal levels. Farther west, dry,
gusty winds from the southwest will direct very mild air into the
western Great Lakes and central Plains.
</P>
<P>
   Potent low pressure will track near Lake Superior Thursday,
causing gusty winds from the northwest to buffet the northeast
Plains and upper Mississippi Valley. Local gusts near 50 mph are
possible over northern Minnesota and in the eastern Dakotas.
</P>
<P>
   A stationary high-pressure system at the surface and aloft will
continue to promote mainly sunny and very warm weather across the
West. Gentle onshore breezes will bring patchy clouds to the
northern California and Oregon coasts.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Kona Low
</P>
<P>
   High surf battered the northern shores of Hawaii the past few
days with crashing waves as high as 12 feet. Large swells were
generated by ocean-churning winds associated with a low-pressure
system about 600 miles northwest of Kauai. This low-pressure
system, called a Kona low by local meteorologists, also helped to
erase the faithful trade winds which typically blow from the
northeast. Instead, winds from the south spread over the islands,
bringing increasingly humid air which fueled a spate of showers and
thunderstorms. The temperature at Honolulu only reached 77 degrees
on Tuesday.

BIGGER IS NOT NECESSARILY BETTER, CHURCH MEMBERS SAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TARA DOOLEY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   From the pulpit, the Rev. Ronnie Reese can see the people
throughout the congregation.
</P>
<P>
   Reese leads the Beacon Baptist Church in Haltom City, Texas, a
flock that averages a little more than 100 for Sunday services. He
knows the members of his congregation by name and he notices when
they are not sitting in the pews.
</P>
<P>
   When they're sick, he visits them. When they are troubled, he
consoles them. When they need inspiration, he preaches to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main characteristic about this church is that it's like a
family,'' he said. ``It's very caring. It's very loving.''
</P>
<P>
   In the age of the megachurch, the corporate merger and
international communications, small has not lost its charm for some
churchgoers.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the small-church faithful arrive weekly in clumps of 30
to 100, seeking close personal relationships with the Lord and with
the people next to them. For most, the church congregation _ all of
it _ is family.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a small church, you have a feeling of so much support
around you,'' said Ray Springer, a deacon at Beacon Baptist. ``You
are never alone when the Lord is with you, but when you have
friends right next to you, it is a big lift.''
</P>
<P>
   Brick for brick, most churches in the United States look more
like Beacon Baptist than like Fellowship Church in Grapevine,
Texas, which attracts thousands to its services. But sheer size
often makes the megachurch the most noticeable to the passing
motorist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big churches are the big churches on the block,'' said Bryan
Feille, professor of pastoral ministry at Texas Christian
University's Brite Divinity School in Fort Worth. ``But well into
this century, most of the churches have been small churches.''
</P>
<P>
   Even at the end of this century, the median-size religious
congregation has about 75 regularly participating adults, according
to data collected in 1998 for the ongoing National Congregations
Study, funded by the Lilly Endowment. Only about 10 percent of
congregations have more than 350 regularly participating adults,
said Mark Chaves, a sociologist at the University of Arizona in
Tucson, Ariz., and the study's principal investigator.
</P>
<P>
   Although most congregations are small, the majority of people
attend congregations of 400 or more, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The basic thing is that small congregations do a lot less than
big congregations do,'' said Chaves, who will publish results of
the study this year.
</P>
<P>
   For example, congregations of 350 or more perform 85 percent of
the social services that religious organizations provide, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Internally, large churches have activities that vary from drama
groups to youth mission trips _ programs that appeal to young
families in particular, Feille said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Younger people are accustomed to being in large institutions
that prize quality,'' he said. ``People today tend to be more
consumers when they shop for the needs for their families.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are still plenty who prize the characteristics of
small churches. And there are some notable characteristics, Feille
said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the pastor of a small congregation is accessible to
all members and is often considered more of a ``family chaplain
than a leader,'' Feille said.
</P>
<P>
   In many instances, the church has a bi-vocational pastor, such
as Mount Horuhm Missionary Baptist Church in Grapevine, near Fort
Worth. The minister there, Richard Montgomery, is also a
transportation supervisor with the U.S. Postal Service.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, church members value their friendships more than
they prize the number of Bible study groups or youth programs
offered, Feille said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone has a key to the church,'' said Chris Hughes, pastor
of Covenant United Methodist Church in Arlington, a Fort Worth
suburb. ``That's part of the family feel. It's like this is their
house. You just walk in.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are drawbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have the manpower,'' said Ralph Evans, chairman of
the administrative board of White's Chapel United Methodist Church
in Southlake, a Fort Worth suburb. ``You don't have the facilities.
You don't have the infrastructure.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans is acquainted with both the big and small church.
</P>
<P>
   Since it began holding services in the 1870s, White's Chapel had
traditionally been small, Evans said. When he joined the church in
1970, between 35 and 65 people attended services, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very intimate, very nice,'' Evans said. ``It filled the
needs of a lot of people. But basically, your worship service was
all that you had.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early '90s, when Southlake began to grow, so did White's
Chapel. Now the church counts about 2,800 members and draws about
1,900 for weekly services, senior Pastor John McKellar said.
</P>
<P>
   The church also holds numerous Bible studies, supports youth
mission programs and donates time and money to feed the homeless.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many things we are able to offer to people
because of more members and more pastors,'' said McKellar, who
oversees five pastors.
</P>
<P>
   Attracting young families often requires small churches to
provide some of these services, pastors say.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to attract the families that travel to the large,
predominantly African-American congregations in Fort Worth or
Dallas, Montgomery and the congregation at Mount Horuhm are
planning to add classrooms and nurseries onto their building,
Montgomery said.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the membership of Beacon Baptist Church in Haltom
City recently added classrooms in an effort to reach out to young
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really believe that if we don't, we will lose everything,''
Reese said.
</P>
<P>
   Although they are trying to attract young members, Reese and
other pastors of small churches say they do not count success by
the numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives a false indication of success if you are going to
look at size,'' Reese said. ``... If you build a church on the word
of God and preach it, it's never going to stop.''

AT HOME WITH SUSAN FALUDI  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Fla.)   By PATRICIA LEIGH BROWN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's almost midnight in the Hollywood Hills. At a
neighborhood bar with a disco ball and gaudy red drapes, one of the
regulars is sitting with her boyfriend nursing her thrice-weekly
chardonnay.
</P>
<P>
   She is on first-name terms with the bartender, Bob, who knows
what she drinks. ``I would come back after two hours of prayer with
the Promise Keepers, and I was ready for a bar,'' says the patron,
Susan Faludi, referring to the soul-searching Christian men's
movement profiled in her new book, ``Stiffed: The Betrayal of the
American Man'' (William Morrow &AMP; Co.).
</P>
<P>
   It was here, near the cottage they share, that Ms. Faludi, 40,
and Russ Rymer, her 47-year-old boyfriend, hashed out ideas on bar
napkins that would eventually become ``Stiffed,'' her 608-page
listening tour through the postwar American male psyche. In the
book, a sprawling look at men in crisis, Ms. Faludi examines a web
of social expectations and shifting values _ millennial fault lines
_ that she feels have trapped men.
</P>
<P>
   She dedicates the book to Rymer, a critically acclaimed writer
whose own book ``American Beach,'' a chronicle of four generations
of a wealthy black family, came out nine months before hers. (``It
was shorter,'' he said.)
</P>
<P>
   If it is strange being Susan Faludi _ whose willingness to take
on the big ones, from antifeminism to her current focus on men
adrift, has made her a human lightning rod _ it may be stranger to
be Rymer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was interviewing someone the other day who said, `My God,
you're living with that feminist!' '' he said, clearly amused.
``Then he said, `Do the words John Wayne Bobbitt mean anything to
you?' ''
</P>
<P>
   While Ms. Faludi is aware of the cartoon caricature of herself _
a sort of Faludi De Vil _ she considers Rymer to be a model
``evolved'' male, one who combines old-fashioned know-how with
new-fashioned values, a type largely missing from her book. The two
share many things: two cats, a 1947 house and a passion for social
justice.
</P>
<P>
   It helps that Rymer does not consider himself ``stiffed'' by
society or women or his father. Perhaps that is why he feels
comfortable cooking, building shelves and being, as he puts it, in
charge of the ``physical plant.''
</P>
<P>
   They moved to Los Angeles in 1993, he from Fernandina Beach,
Fla., and she from Palo Alto, Calif., where she had a journalism
fellowship at Stanford University after winning a Pulitzer Prize
for her reporting in The Wall Street Journal and writing
``Backlash: The Undeclared War Against American Women,'' her
best-selling 1991 manifesto about the deliberate undermining of
women's advances in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   They met in San Francisco in 1992 after being introduced by a
mutual editor. At the time Ms. Faludi happened to be on the cover
of Time. ``It occurred to me to turn around and go home,'' Rymer
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Faludi added, ``It wasn't a very flattering picture,
either.''
</P>
<P>
   As serious as they are, they have a comfortable comic repartee;
he is outgoing, she is soft-spoken, even demure.
</P>
<P>
   Their house is uphill from the bar, on the street where aliens
tried to change humans into pod people in ``Invasion of the Body
Snatchers,'' a lush and twisting Eden where coyotes can be spotted
skulking past the bougainvillea.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Stiffed,'' Ms. Faludi describes an ``ornamental culture''
in which men have been duped into obsessing about consumerist
trappings and cover-boy appearances the way women once did. There
is little ornamental culture in her home, a spare, clean space with
conservative sofas and paintings of industrial and street scenes
rented from the Los Angeles County Art Museum. The spareness is
intentional, because, she said, ``I live more in my head.'' He
added: ``Our work is so cluttered that we're cluttered internally.
It would drive us crazy to be in a Victorian drawing room with
fringes.''
</P>
<P>
   Her office is larger than his, no-nonsense, with a
nouveau-Mission desk and pine bookshelves he made for her. It is
decorated with rousing artifacts from her ``Stiffed'' odyssey,
among them a press pass from the Million Man March and an
anti-Shannon Faulkner ``Save the Males'' bumper sticker from the
Citadel.
</P>
<P>
   In her book, which she calls a journey, Ms. Faludi tries to come
to grips with postwar social upheavals, from downsizing to the
Vietnam War, that she feels have short-circuited men. ``Stiffed''
is at once sweeping and intimate and largely sympathetic, using
individual tales as well as group portraits _ Citadel cadets,
members of the Spur Posse gang, even pornography stars _ as a way
of examining social disjunction. Above all, perhaps, it is pervaded
by a sense of loss _ of family, community and ties that bound men
to each other and to the traditional institutions they trusted,
from sports teams to the Army.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Many of the voices eerily echo women, pre-Betty Friedan. In the
book, Jack Schat, a member of Alternatives to Violence, a Long
Beach, Calif., counseling group for batterers, explains: ``What
really excited me about getting married was not her, but just being
married, doing what I was supposed to do.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Some critics have accused Ms. Faludi of focusing on a bunch of
losers. ``I find it shocking, this throwing out of the word
`losers' to describe people who got the short end of the stick,''
she said over lox and bagels in their dining room. Her
publicity-shot blue eyes looked as if she had been in a pool with
too much chlorine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't mean for these men to be representative, but to
illuminate themes that run through our society and how men are
caught in the gears,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The happy, well-adjusted guys who some say are missing from her
book do exist. She lives with one. Her chivalrous boyfriend, whose
voice and easy manner bear traces of his Southern roots, grows
agitated when his firecracker-lobbing damsel is attacked. ``It
makes me crazy,'' he said. ``Susan's not angry. But what she does
have in spades is conviction.''
</P>
<P>
   Both have impeccable antennae for the subtext of the cultural
conversation; she takes the broad strokes, he burrows into a sense
of place. Both grew up as ``the other,'' Rymer said, which gave
them the desire to enter worlds ``that by pedigree wouldn't accept
us.'' She was a middle-class Jew living in a tract house in a
predominantly Roman Catholic neighborhood in Yorktown Heights,
N.Y.; he was a Southerner whose mother rallied for school
desegregation and drew the ire of the local Ku Klux Klan.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Faludi describes her own mother, Marilyn, now studying for
her master's in Victorian literature at New York University at age
69, as ``a Village person, a bohemian,'' who gave up her career as
an editor to be a 1950s housewife, albeit an unconventional one.
While other mothers went grocery shopping, she would take Susan and
her younger brother, Robert, on field trips to the meatpacking
district, the Fulton Fish Market, even the dry cleaner. They would
stroll under the West Side Highway, because, Ms. Faludi said, ``my
mother loves rubble.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She had a desire to show her children behind the scenes,'' she
continued, ``not just the cleaned-up, sanitized version of life.''

<P>
   LIFE IN AMERICA 1021 _ Grand Mesa lover sees (and sells)
everything _ GRAND MESA, Colo. _ The house is too small for the
treasures. One corner is crowded with ``I fish therefore I lie''
baseball caps, Old Dutch cleanser and Powderhorn sweat shirts,
another corner overflows with handmade dream catchers, postcards
and books about Grand Mesa. ``I need more room,'' said Treasure
House owner Joanne Taylor, scanning the 800-plus-square-foot
building from her vantage point behind the counter, which also is
stacked with things like newspapers and candy, treasures to the
right person. The permanent treasure, though, the one beyond pop
rocks and pewter jewelry, is outside the window. Right now it's a
palette of autumn, oak brush leaves rusted auburn like barn door
hinges and the pine and spruce forest up Grand Mesa slopes marbled
with gold stands of aspen. Colors and textures change with the
seasons, but always are treasured by Mesa residents who give
themselves a gift just by looking out the window each morning.
Having been spared, so far, many of the more pernicious effects of
rampant development familiar to the rest of western Colorado, Mesa

   CARTER _ Jimmy Carter was talking about vision. No, not grand
sweep, big picture kind of vision. The former president of the
United States was talking about the failing eyesight of a child.
Carter, 75, was haunted by the image of a cute 2-year-old boy he
had seen last weekend in the poor West African nation of Mali. The
boy suffered from the early stages of a disease called trachoma, an
ailment that has blinded 6 million people and that infects millions
more. The boy's grandmother has already been blinded by the
disease. But the boy, the former president said, still has a chance
of keeping his eyesight. The youngster from Mali, and others like
him, will have more a chance thanks to new programs the Carter
Center is announcing today. (Thursday) (Graham, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution).

   CHINA-PANDAS _ KORLA, China _ Pandemonium! Two of China's
national treasures, a pair of pandas, will be going to Zoo Atlanta
by the end of this month, the dominant state television network
CCTV-1 reported late Wednesday. Whether two-year-old female Lun Lun
and her two-year-old male pal Yang Yang were really about to split
from the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding was still
slightly up in the air despite this unqualified report to millions
of viewers on Chinese government-run television. Late Wednesday
night, Sarah Bexell, Zoo Atlanta's researcher on the ground in
China, said she had no official confirmation that China's ruling
State Council had finally approved the long-delayed export permit.

   JOURNAL-HONDURAS _ MARCOVIA, Honduras - It seems relatively
simple: a nation torn apart by Hurricane Mitch's raging floods
needs to be rebuilt. Donor countries and international charities
step in, providing millions in aid to rebuild infrastructure and
hundreds of volunteers to help provide housing. Slowly, roads are
cleared, washouts filled in, temporary bridges installed and
hundreds of new cement block houses are constructed. But a year
after Mitch's floods, it's clear that rebuilding a poor country
devastated by a natural disaster isn't so easy - at least not if
you want to address the underlying problems that made the disaster
so much worse than it might have been. (Williams/, Cox News

LOS ANGELES: of life.''

<P>
   She credits her mother with kindling her concern about social
issues. Her father, Steven, who now lives in Budapest (her parents
divorced when she was 17), was an only child whose family was
largely eradicated in the Holocaust. He spent his early adolescence
hiding from the Nazis in a safe house in Budapest.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Although the men in her book open their souls to her, her
descriptions of her own father, who has returned to Hungary to
attend to unfinished emotional business, are surprisingly muted.
``Like many Holocaust survivors, he has so much not to talk
about,'' she said. ``He lost his inheritance, his country, his
patrimony.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   With feminism, the narrative of women like Ms. Faludi's mother
became a national anthem. ``The women's movement hit my
neighborhood like a freight train,'' she said. ``Everybody got
divorced. You wonder what would have happened to women if the
suburbs hadn't been built.''
</P>
<P>
   But what she initially overlooked, she said, was the effects of
middle-class suburban expectations on men like her father. ``Part
of me has certainly been motivated by wanting to take a stand
against the restrictions that made Mother give up so much,'' she
said. ``But men's lives were diminished by the same deal. When my
father got married, he gave up the dream of moving to L.A. to
become part of the Hungarian Jewish filmmaking mafia.'' Instead, he
worked in a commercial photography studio.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were all sorts of domestic things he loved, including
cooking, that he could have fostered, instead of playing the
commuter guy with the fedora taking the 4:59 home,'' she said. As
an immigrant, she noted, her father was under even more pressure to
assimilate and fit in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women rubbed the sand dust out of their eyes and said, `Wait a
second,' while the men just stumbled on,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Among the exceptions, apparently, is Rymer, who says his life
choices were deeply affected ``by not wanting to be an organization
man like my father.'' The career his father, Richard, pursued as a
electrical engineer was eventually derailed in much the same way as
the careers of the men in the aerospace industry in Ms. Faludi's
book: their glittery titles and fancy nameplates couldn't save them
from pink slips. ``A lot of men who loved the art of engineering
got run out by business types,'' Rymer said. ``And it really
crushed my father.''
</P>
<P>
   The elder Rymer's story deeply influenced Ms. Faludi. ``Russ'
father had a real sense of how that betrayal worked, because he'd
experienced it up close,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Rymer went a different route, opting not to attend college.
Before embracing the literary life (his first book, ``Genie: A
Scientific Tragedy,'' 1991, was excerpted in The New Yorker and
received a Whiting Writers' Award), he worked as a printing press
mechanic, a carpenter and a seaman.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of old-fashioned, manly training is somewhat
romanticized in ``Stiffed.'' It also may be a key to their
relationship. ``He gives her a lot of ballast,'' said Steve Oney, a
friend and writer in Los Angeles. ``Russ is the opposite of the Ivy
League cerebrates Susan went to college with, for whom irony and
bored affectation is a personal style.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Ms. Faludi went to Harvard and is now a famous writer,
Rymer says, ``I never felt outgunned.''
</P>
<P>
   Their idea of a good time is talking. And talking, and talking.
They talk while strolling in Huntington Gardens in Pasadena, around
the Hollywood Reservoir, over wine or gin at the bar. ``People ask,
What are our hobbies?'' she said with amusement. ``Our hobby is
when we sit down at the end of the day and hash out our ideas and
struggle with our thoughts.''
</P>
<P>
   During the day, they sometimes hang around the doors to each
other's offices waiting to be noticed. They remain at this point
wedded to their work and skittish about marriage. ``We like to do
what's not expected,'' she said. ``A lot of people seem to want to
make the institution of marriage substitute for a real
relationship.''

COLLEGE ATHLETE'S BIGGEST RIVAL IS ASTHMA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Even when Jill Meconi is struggling for her next
breath, she is fighting to live life on her terms.
</P>
<P>
   That is evident at all times, in all places, especially on the
soccer field. Meconi plays for the College of Saint Rose even
though she has severe asthma, a condition that has sent her to the
hospital several times and requires daily doses of medication.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a different breed,'' Saint Rose trainer Jay Geiger said.
``She definitely pushes herself to the limit. Sometimes we have to
make the call to take her out (of games), but she's learning and
getting better (at pacing herself).''
</P>
<P>
   Last winter, Meconi even had heart surgery as a result of a
complication of her treatment for asthma, a chronic inflammation of
the lungs.
</P>
<P>
   When Meconi kneels to adjust her socks or falls a step behind
other players, those are signs that she is struggling to breathe
and needs to rest and use her inhaler.
</P>
<P>
   To ignore the warning signs, Meconi said, would mean risking her
life. She said she has suffered frightening episodes of
disorientation from a lack of oxygen, and she remembers receiving
this warning from one of her doctors: ``He said if I didn't take
care of myself and stop when I needed to stop, I'm a time bomb
waiting to go off.''
</P>
<P>
   Meconi and the Saint Rose trainers, adhering to a treatment plan
prescribed by Meconi's doctor _ who has given her clearance to play
_ battle every day to prevent those ominous words from coming true.
</P>
<P>
   But even diligent care can't remove the threat of an attack that
hovers over every asthmatic. It's a risk Meconi and her parents are
willing to take so she can play the game she loves.
</P>
<P>
   Meconi, a 19-year-old reserve forward, said she has come to
grips with the fact that she may never recapture the form she had
in winning the Section VII Most Valuable Player award at Seton
Catholic High School in Plattsburgh two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   That was before her asthma worsened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to be untouchable,'' Meconi said. ``I got to taste the
goals, the winning and the glory. Now it's hard for me to realize
what I have to do. For Saint Rose, I may not be the star athlete,
but I can say I have a big heart and a big drive for the game.''
</P>
<P>
   While Geiger said he is nervous about Meconi's condition, he is
in awe of her determination, especially in a sport that demands
constant movement and stamina.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's playing a lot by her heart and not with her lungs,''
Geiger said.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, Meconi is the most watched player on her team, not
only by Geiger but by coach Laurie Darling Gutheil and Meconi's
teammates, who worry about her well-being.
</P>
<P>
   And, frankly, Meconi said she doesn't like the extra attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want everyone to know I have limitations,'' she said.
``I want to be considered a normal person, even though I'm not. And
everyone knows I have these problems. That's fine, but I want to
try to do everything like anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   During Meconi's senior year in high school, the mild asthma she
had had since childhood developed into the severe kind, for unknown
reasons. There was no history of asthma in her family.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Stoloff, a Plattsburgh doctor who specializes in allergies
and asthma and who treats Meconi, said that fewer than 5 percent of
his patients are afflicted as badly as Meconi is.
</P>
<P>
   ``What makes things with Jill a little more complex is we're
trying to get her to be able to function at a very high competitive
level in a very aerobic sport,'' Stoloff said. ``If she was playing
left field in softball, it would be less of an issue because she'd
be doing a lot of standing.''
</P>
<P>
   Stoloff said he never has discouraged Meconi from playing.
Stoloff said he'd rather see patients lead active lives, as long as
they monitor their condition and seek appropriate treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at Jill, she has severe asthma and she's playing
competitive college sports,'' he said. ``Some people with asthma
think that if they wheeze, they should be excused from gym for the
year.''
</P>

<P>

</P>
<P>
   Meconi is feeling and playing better than she did during her
trying freshman year. The 5-foot-4 Meconi gained 40 pounds last
year to increase to 155, a side effect of steroids she was taking
to reduce the inflammation in her lungs.
</P>
<P>
   At times last season, Meconi said she would come out of a match
in a confused state, unable to remember what she'd done in the game
because of a lack of oxygen to her brain. Meconi also said that on
one 80-degree afternoon, the team cloaked her in several coats
because she complained she was freezing.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, Meconi tries to explain to a non-asthmatic person
what it's like to have an attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I give them one of those little bar straws and tell them to
breathe through it,'' she said. ``It's like that. You can't get
enough air in and it's a very restrictive, tight feeling. I get
really light-headed.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides too much exercise, there are other factors that trigger
Meconi's asthma attacks: common colds, animals and some allergies.
</P>
<P>
   Meconi's situation became more serious last winter. Doctors had
implanted a portocath in her chest so that she could receive
frequent injections of an experimental asthma drug. But a piece of
the portocath broke off and lodged into the right atrium of her
heart. It took more than five hours for doctors at Champlain Valley
Physicians Hospital in Plattsburgh to remove the piece, pulling it
out with a wire through her groin.
</P>
<P>
   ``And you know what, she was a really good sport about it,''
said her mother, Barb. ``She doesn't really remember, but they said
when she was under anesthesia, she was telling Bill Clinton
jokes.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Meconi has had another portocath implanted, and the
device _ about the size of a quarter _ stays permanently in her
chest above her heart.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, again having difficulty breathing, Meconi was flown
to the National Jewish Hospital in Denver, one of the nation's
foremost centers for asthma and other lung diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Barb Meconi, who is a nurse, said her daughter's condition
improved when doctors changed some of her medications, eliminating
some drugs that had the side effect of weakening her immune system.
</P>
<P>
   Still, when Jill Meconi returned home to Plattsburgh in July,
she was feeble from a lack of exercise. While teammates were going
through an off-season conditioning program that included five-to
six-mile runs four times a week, Meconi couldn't climb a flight of
stairs or do a single push-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just had no muscle to move,'' Meconi said. ``I started at
square one, below that. It was two hours in the gym (in
Plattsburgh). I'd stay in there and it got to a point where slowly
things were coming back. It was very hard and very frustrating, the
most frustrating time of my life, but the hard work paid off.''

 &HT;    BUDGET PROGRESS CAUGHT IN SOCIAL SECURITY 'LOCK BOX'
 &HT;    Eds: Updating and repeating a story from Tuesday for all
needing.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Earlier this year, when President Clinton and
congressional Republicans trotted out competing plans for
protecting a huge projected Social Security surplus, there was
little accompanying fanfare.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as White House and congressional budget writers sharpen
their pencils and work to narrow their differences, negotiations
are centered largely on two different plans for ``locking up'' $2
trillion in surplus Social Security payroll taxes over the coming
decade.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of their struggle lies an issue that refuses to
die: how to assure the long-term health of Social Security, the
federal retirement and disability program that provides income to
44.4 million Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``First and foremost, we must protect Social Security,'' Clinton
told reporters Wednesday at a ceremony to sign a $69.4 billion
spending bill for the Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing
and Urban Development, NASA and a handful of smaller agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he asked Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott,
R-Miss., and House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., to consider his
plan for locking up the Social Security surplus, ``and I hope they
will do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans and Democrats have given up hope for progress this
year on addressing a projected financial shortfall in Social
Security. Tax revenues will no longer cover all benefits when large
numbers of Baby Boomers are retiring around 2015, and the system
will have to tap the trust fund.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the battle is over how to preserve the program's surplus,
which will have the effect of paying down the $5.7 trillion federal
debt and eventually make it easier to deal with the shortfall.
</P>
<P>
   Without an agreement on how to do that, the budget process is
deadlocked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It spills over into everything, really,'' said Trent Duffy,
spokesman for House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer,
R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any budget deal has to find some way to at least rhetorically
address the issue of Social Security,'' said a specialist on the
issue, Edward Lorenzen, legislative director for Rep. Charles
Stenholm, D-Texas. ``The question is whether what we do is
meaningful, or whether it is just for show.''
</P>
<P>
   In meeting Tuesday between Clinton and the GOP's congressional
leadership, both sides agreed not to tap into next year's Social
Security surplus.
</P>
<P>
   They remain at odds over how to produce a budget without it.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have proposed slashing certain types of spending _
though not defense, which they've proposed to increase by about
$4.6 billion above what the Pentagon requested _ but they've ruled
out tax hikes.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton wants to pay for his proposed spending hikes for foreign
aid, education and the hiring of additional police officers by
raising cigarette taxes by 55 cents a pack, a measure the White
House figures would bring in some $8 billion a year, and increasing
certain fees for businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Where the budget negotiations appear to be headed, analysts say,
is toward some sort of face-saving way for each side to admit that
they can't keep their hands off the Social Security surplus.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is all comes down to,'' said Lorenzen, ``is either we
agree to a whole bunch of gimmicks or we find an honorable way for
both sides to say 'Oh, we couldn't balance the budget without
getting into the Social Security surplus.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The key, for both sides, is an idea both parties call a Social
Security ``lock box,'' a legislative plan that, on paper at least,
would earmark all Social Security surplus money for paying down the
debt.
</P>
<P>
   Under current budget law, all money paid into the Social
Security system goes into the U.S. Treasury. There, the money is
converted into promises _ notes that say the Treasury will pay a
specified amount of money to two Social Security trust funds, out
of which comes the money to pay benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury then borrows the trust fund cash and may use it for
one of three purposes: to pay for government operations, to offset
tax cuts, or to pay down debt.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Republican lock box plan, the first two options would
be outlawed. The roughly $2 trillion in Social Security surpluses
over the coming decade would be used strictly to pay down debt.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has proposed his own version, a sort of ``lock box
plus.'' His plan also calls for earmarking the Social Security
surplus for debt reduction. But Clinton says that retiring the
entire $3.2 trillion portion of the debt owed to private banks and
investors by the year 2015 would eliminate interest payments that
cost taxpayers $235 billion this year alone.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's plan calls for taking $543 billion worth of interest
rate savings and pumping it into the Social Security trust funds
between 2011 and 2015. After that, under his plan, another $189
billion a year in interest savings would go into the funds.
</P>
<P>
   That, according to the White House, would keep the Social
Security program financially solvent until around the year 2050.
The trust fund is projected to be exhausted by 2034 under its
current funding structure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president believes we have a historic opportunity this
year to reform Social Security. At a minimum, he would like to
agree on a down payment on reform by passing a Social Security lock
box that extends the life of Social Security until 2050 and pays
down debt,'' said Patrick Dorton, spokesman for the White House's
National Economic Council. ``The Republicans' lock box doesn't add
a single day to the life of Social Security.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the Republican plan, any reductions in interest payments
would be treated simply as money the government no longer must
spend. That could open the door to tax reduction proposals, such as
the Republican plan for a $792 billion tax cut, which passed both
houses of Congress and was vetoed by Clinton last month.
</P>
<P>
   Whether a formal lock box arrangement is agreed upon or not, the
public now expects a budget that _ for the first time in a
generation _ won't rely on Social Security surpluses for balance,
said Lott's press spokesman, John Czwartacki.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to act as though there is a lock box,'' said
Czwartacki. ``It's all but in effect. This town can't get away with
spending this money. If they try, there's going to be hell to
pay.''

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Sy Sohmer, president and director of the
Botanical Research Institute of Texas, surveys the rows of metal
cases kept in a handsomely remodeled warehouse on the east edge of
downtown.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cure for cancer is somewhere in these cases,'' he says,
confidently.
</P>
<P>
   Many people in Fort Worth aren't even aware that BRIT exists.
But in its short history, the research institute has become a
botanical equivalent of the Kimbell Art Museum, as a local cultural
and educational resource and in its potential significance in
international botanical research.
</P>
<P>
   BRIT was established in 1991 after Southern Methodist University
decided to divest its large but neglected collection of southern
coastal-area plant specimens, which were then crammed into a
basement on its Dallas campus. But the university wanted to find an
ethical owner.
</P>
<P>
   A few interested Fort Worth individuals became aware of the
specimens and agreed to take responsibility for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it's a good thing those folks didn't know what they were
getting into,'' Sohmer says.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Bass, one of Fort Worth's most influential citizens, whose
interest in botanical and environmental issues is well known, soon
became involved in moving the collection to the city. Bass also was
on the board of the New York Botanical Garden.
</P>
<P>
   He examined 40 potential sites to house the collection before
settling on the old Ellison Furniture Co. warehouse complex of
three buildings. The SMU collection was brought over and BRIT was
born.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Vanderbilt University in Nashville had also decided
to transfer a collection of specimens. BRIT stepped forward again
to claim it. Having since added to the SMU and Vanderbilt
collections, BRIT now owns more than 1 million plant specimens and
has a library of 60,000 volumes and journals. The oldest specimens,
still in excellent condition, date from the 18th century.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all the stuff you need to do botanical work anywhere in
the world,'' Sohmer says.
</P>
<P>
   New York-born Sohmer, who holds degrees from City University of
New York, the University of Tennessee at Knoxville and the
University of Hawaii, was the senior adviser for biodiversity at
the federal Agency for International Development in 1992. It was a
job he enjoyed, and wasn't planning to leave, until he heard from
BRIT.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew nothing about this place,'' he says. ``But I sensed
something unique.''
</P>
<P>
   Drawn by the possibility of building a major institution from
the ground up, Sohmer came to Fort Worth in 1993; his wife, Sara,
now teaches history at Texas Christian University.
</P>
<P>
   Storing the specimens is not as complicated as one might think.
Properly dried plants pasted on paper and kept in a cool, dry room
will last indefinitely, unless insects get to them.
</P>
<P>
   So far, cigarette beetles _ little bugs the size of pinheads
that live in tobacco products _ have been the main worry. Signs at
the entrance to BRIT ask that visitors leave all tobacco products
outside, but BRIT still must be fumigated for cigarette beetles
twice.
</P>
<P>
   The one piece of unusual modern technology required at BRIT is a
large chest freezer in which new specimens are chilled to minus 76
degrees for 2 1/2 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``That kills anything they may have on them,'' Sohmer says.
</P>
<P>
   However, Sohmer hopes eventually to have a ``black box'' setup
that will house the specimens in an even more secure, sanitized,
insect-free environment; the current environment is adequate but by
no means perfect, he says.
</P>
<P>
   BRIT operates with an efficient staff of 10 full-time and six
part-time employees. It has an annual operating budget of $900,000
that usually expands to about $1.4 million with specially funded
projects. An annual event features guest celebrities such as
prominent environmentalists Lady Bird Johnson, Jane Goodall and
President Jose Maria Figueres of Costa Rica.
</P>
<P>
   Approximately 26,000 students, from elementary school through
college, have visited BRIT since the education program began four
years ago. As those students become adults, BRIT's name recognition
in the community is expected to increase.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who haven't heard of BRIT are getting rarer,''
Sohmer says.

   The New York Times' computer football ranking is based on an
analysis of each team's scores with emphasis on three factors: who
won, by what margin and against what quality of opposition. The
quality of an opponent is determined by examining its record
against other teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Times' computer model collapses runaway scores and takes
note of a home-field advantage. Recent games count more than
earlier games.
</P>
<P>
   The top team is assigned a rating of 1.000; the ratings of all
other teams are percentages reflecting their strength relative to
the top team. This week, for example, there is a fairly large
difference between St. Louis (No. 1) and Jacksonville (No. 2), and
a much smaller difference between Jacksonville (No. 2) and San
Diego (No. 3).

   Creative Labs Introduces Redesigned MP3 Player
</P>
<P>
   Hardly six months after Creative Labs entered the highly
competitive market for portable audio digital players, commonly
called MP3 players, the Singapore-based electronics company has
introduced a radically redesigned player called the Nomad II.
</P>
<P>
   Looking little like its shiny, metal-skinned predecessor, Nomad
II has a hardened plastic shell that covers a slightly larger and
heavier machine that stores and plays MP3 music and voice files.
But the new $400 player (almost twice the price of the old player)
can do much more, which, its designers say, makes it practically
``future proof.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides playing the MP3 audio format, the Nomad II is
programmable, meaning that it can download instructions that would
permit it to use a variety of formats like Windows Media Audio, and
even some formats not yet developed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a product that will change as the industry continues to
evolve,'' said Hock Leow, chief technology officer for Creative.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the old Nomad, which will remain on the market, the new
player connects to the computer with a high-speed USB cable.
</P>
<P>
   Nomad II features a backlighted LCD screen, but no built-in
memory. All memory is removable. It comes with a 64-megabyte flash
memory card and an improved set of bass-enhanced headphones.
Similar to first-generation Nomad, Nomad II features an FM tuner,
but can store many more preset stations.

   Sony Has a Free (and Secret) Fix For Out-of-Sync DVD Players
</P>
<P>
   Consumers buy DVD players looking to get a razor-sharp picture
and high-fidelity surround sound, and they get it _ most of the
time.
</P>
<P>
   But a problem that puts sound out of sync with the picture has
popped up in some DVD players by several major manufacturers. The
problem appears to affect some Sony products in particular. DVD
owners in chat rooms on consumer Web sites like Deja.com say that
dialogue occasionally lags behind an actor's lip movements, which
leaves films looking like badly dubbed foreign movies.
</P>
<P>
   Sony said it was tough to determine the exact cause because
sometimes the trouble was with the disk (``The Matrix'' is reported
to be problematic) and because the error appears randomly. Bill
Cubellis, director of DVD marketing at Sony Electronics, said that
there was no design flaw and that the cause was commonly ``a chip
failure.'' He said the problem had been more apparent with Sony
products because ``we are selling more DVD players than anyone else
on the planet.''
</P>
<P>
   A representative at Sony's service line, (800) 222-7669, said
the company could ``cure'' the problem, but the company will not
say what the cure is. Sony will fix a problem player free if the
owner will pay to ship it to a repair center. But owners have found
their own ways of solving the problem. Some say turning the machine
off, then on again, will fix it. Others advise using the ``jog
shuttle backward'' feature, then Play.
</P>
<P>
   Why bother? Some owners say that the combination of features and
value are a fair trade-off, even if ``The Unforgiven'' occasionally
looks like ``The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.''

said all 32 volumes would be available at www.britannica.com, free

</P>
<P>
   Videogame veterans have long known that those knobby ``analog'`
controllers offer better control than the older up-down-left-right
button controllers. Now PC gamers can have tighter control over
their virtual battles with Interact's Hammerhead FX game pad
(www.interact-acc.com), which sells for $39.99. The smoothly
sculpted device houses tiny vibrating motors that offer
force-feedback shakes, rattles and rolls in response to on-screen

   A Professor Lands in Hot Water When His Modem Calls Police
</P>
<P>
   Yigal Ehrlich, a 56-year-old professor in Staten Island, N.Y.,
has experienced something of an Internet emergency: When installing
MCI Worldcom Internet software recently, his computer mistakenly
dialed 911.
</P>
<P>
   Through his computer speakers, he could hear police asking for
his location. Within minutes, he said, they had arrived at his
door. While Ehrlich was wrangling with customer-support technicians
on the phone, his wife explained the problem to police. They were
not amused and gave Ehrlich a warning, which he said was now a
permanent part of his record.
</P>
<P>
   But the tale gets worse. Ehrlich's modem software was damaged so
badly that he could no longer make connections, and he wanted to
warn others about the problem.
</P>
<P>
   An MCI Worldcom technician told Ehrlich that the problem might
have occurred because he was using a Macintosh computer with an
operating system older than version 8.1. What appears to have
happened, Ehrlich said, is that when his computer dialed the
software's toll-free set-up number _ (888) 234-5911 _ the computer
dialed only the last three digits.
</P>
<P>
   The CD that Erhlich was using did not have a warning label about
the recommended operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Claire Hassett, a spokeswoman for MCI Worldcom, said that the
company had never heard of anyone else having the problem and that
such a scenario had never come up in testing, even on a Macintosh
with an 8.0 operating system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never heard of an 800 number not completely dialing,''
Ms. Hassett said.
</P>
<P>
   She added that the operating-system requirement was noted in the
software's terms and conditions and that the company would make the
requirement clear on the labels of future CDs.
</P>
<P>
   Ehrlich is not satisfied. ``I have no reason in the world to
invent such a story,'' he said. ``I don't want any other person to
have to go through this.'' He has asked MCI Worldcom to write a
letter to his local police, clearing his name. So far, he said, MCI
Worldcom has refused. And his modem is still not working.

   INDONESIA-POLITICS (Jakarta, Indonesia) _ In the first
democratic transfer of power in its history, Indonesia inaugurated
a new president Wednesday, Abdurrahman Wahid, a respected Moslem
leader whose message is tolerance, inclusion and self respect. The
vote for Wahid, 59, in an electoral assembly was a surprise. There

   COLOMBIA-REFUGEES (Cucuta, Colombia) _ As Colombia's

majority are peasants caught in the crossfire between Marxist
guerrillas and the right-wing paramilitary forces that seek to wipe

   CONGRESS-CLEMENCY (Washington) _ The Puerto Rican nationalists
offered clemency by President Clinton failed to make the standard
display of remorse by personally requesting clemency. The top
Justice Department lawyer who handles such requests personally
coached their advocates about how to word an application. And a
department attorney was ``baffled'' by the interest of the White
House in the case. These details showing the highly unusual

released Wednesday at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing into the
issue. By Neil A. Lewis.

IN A BOOM YEAR, THERE'S ROOM FOR RETRO-MODERN AND A BIT OF
BAROQUE 
</HEADLINE>
  (dw) 
 By LIZ SEYMOUR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HIGH POINT, N.C. _ Once upon a time, everybody wanted to be in
pictures. Now, every able-bodied celebrity wants to be in the
furniture business.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Forbes, the vice chairman of Forbes, the magazine
publishing company, was here to introduce furniture, lamps, rugs
and bedding from a variety of makers inspired by the domestic
trappings of his late father, Malcolm Forbes, the Tangier-loving,
Elizabeth Taylor-squiring, Harley-Davidson-riding millionaire
publisher.
</P>
<P>
   A few blocks away, Kathy Ireland's white stretch limousine idled
outside Vanguard Furniture, where Ms. Ireland _ the Sports
Illustrated swimsuit model and ``a modern Renaissance woman'' in
the words of the company's news release _ conducted tours of a
3,000-square-foot display dedicated to a furniture collection
bearing her name. (She already lends her wholesome good looks to a
signature clothing line for Kmart, which Women's Wear Daily has
declared the seventh most popular brand of women's clothing in the
country.)
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, Jack Palance, the great B-movie actor, was touting
the virtues of Action Lane's reclining leather chairs and sofas.
</P>
<P>
   Even the trend forecaster Faith Popcorn, who has long scolded
the male-dominated furniture industry for giving short shrift to
its largely female consumers, put her money where her mouth is: her
own home office collection for Hooker Furniture designed to appeal
to women.
</P>
<P>
   A combination of a strong economy and the steady march of baby
boomers toward midlife affluence was projected by the American
Furniture Manufacturers Association to bump consumer demand for
furniture to $61.105 billion in 1999, an increase of 5.5 percent
over 1998. With 2,400 exhibitors and 8 million square feet of
showroom space _ and another million square feet to be added in the
next six months _ the twice-a-year International Home Furnishing
Market is the biggest wholesale furniture market in the world. It
opened last Thursday and continues through Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The mood in the opening days of market was as buoyant as the
Faberge-egg-shaped hot-air balloon that bobbed in the sky above a
weedy vacant lot where Forbes made his presentation (bejewelled
Faberge eggs were one of his father's passions). After years of
grumbling about sluggish sales and thin margins, manufacturers were
worrying about meeting demand. However, few of them were rocking
the boat with startling new products, preferring to concentrate
instead on what was selling. ``There's more merchandise being
deleted than being added,'' Epperson said. ``Why change?''
</P>
<P>
   Showroom building corridors were filled not just with furniture
buyers, but with buyers from office supply stores, home
improvements stores and home electronics stores as well. (In one
odd-couple matchup, Bose, the maker of high-end audio equipment,
will start carrying Mitchell Gold furniture in some of its mall
stores this fall.) Catalog companies like Pottery Barn and Crate &AMP;
Barrel were given credit for rehabbing furniture's dowdy image
among consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden there started being all this good stuff
available through catalogs,'' said Thomas O'Brien, 38, a cofounder
of the hip SoHo design firm Aero Studios, who was in town to
introduce a resolutely modern-minded collection for Hickory Chair,
for 99 years a bastion of traditionalism: Mount Vernon
reproductions, Mark Hampton historicism.
</P>
<P>
   In general, two nearly antithetical style directions vied for
attention. On the one hand, sophisticated retro-modern design
continued to gain strength, and dark woods, especially mahogany,
had all but displaced the light birch and ash that had been
celebrated just a couple of markets ago.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien's vision for the millennium is sleekly elegant
eclecticism with a gentle Mixmaster edge: a bit of 1940s Chinese
here, some embossed velvet there, a slipper chair with an
exaggerated towering back, a seriously scholastic scroll-arm chair
based on a Greek Revival original that O'Brien has owned since he
was in college. Even Stanley Furniture got into the modernist act.
Its Reflections of the 20th Century collection was similar in
feeling to O'Brien's serene chic _ but priced to reach the
midmarket consumer rather than Hickory Chair's typical posse of
well-heeled suburbanites.
</P>
<P>
   The prevalence of clean lines, tight upholstery, exposed legs,
sexy little ottomans and silvery hardware at almost every price
level proved that modern design had lost its shock value. Or, just
maybe, the typical diehard American consumer, though still in love
with tradition, has begun to accept the obvious _that it is 1999,
not 1799.
</P>
<P>
   The entire second floor of Mitchell Gold's cobalt-blue
headquarters, once the epicenter of the slouchy slipcover look, was
devoted to severe tailoring. ``I wouldn't make them if they didn't
sell,'' said Gold, the president of the company, whose stylish
upholstery is a staple at Crate and Barrel and other young-consumer
outlets.
</P>
<P>
   Other introductions, however, took a distinctly baroque route.
Thomasville's Bellasera, Stanley's Coronation, Lexington's
California Legacy, and Bernhardt's Coronado were Euro inspired and
heavily ornamented, combining metal, stone and glass with light
woods and painted finishes. The pieces were also scaled to behemoth
proportions, targeted at consumers with bodacious suburban homes to
fill and a weakness for flashy effects. It could have been called
``Married to the Mob.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, European designers seemed to have recolonized America,
some more successfully than others. Despite Ms. Ireland's
pronouncement that she was ``making it safe for people to take
risks,'' she gamely trotted out furniture that was neither
controversial nor new: a bun-foot damask sofa, a whitewashed side
table with barley-twist legs and nonthreatening rattan dining
chairs.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Baker's Continental Collection was a quietly
elegant treat. Culled from surprisingly diverse sources _ Baltic
manor houses, anyone? _ the 16th-, 17th- and 18th-century designs
were oddly contemporary, proving that clean, crisp design knows no
era. The company's Biedermeier-style center table, for example,
could be pure Eames.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The most notable holdout was Lane Furniture, which introduced
American designs from Colonial Williamsburg. But the introduction
had more to do with marketing savvy than a devotion to America's
historic best. In making the move from Baker, which had been
licensed to produce high-priced reproductions for a small and
rarefied market, to Lane, whose new midpriced ``interpretative''
pieces are priced to appeal to a much larger audience, Colonial
Williamsburg joined a mainstream trend: aggressive licensing.
</P>
<P>
   In an industry notably short on household-word brands, an
increasing number of companies hoped that a borrowed name _ whether
of a museum, a designer or simply a celebrity, even a dead one,
like Thomasville's Ernest Hemingway range, released last spring to
consumer acclaim and critical drubbing _ would help to create
instant recognition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Branded furniture stores such as Ethan Allen are doing very
well,'' Epperson said. ``It's logical that brands would become more
important in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   If so, the industry will have to grapple with another challenge:
how to sell brand names over the Internet. In an industry
traditionally fiercely protective of sales territories, the
Internet's borderless markets are both attractive and threatening.
Nonetheless, a growing number of furniture companies gingerly
crossed the line between E-information and E-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Directions, a Georgia-based manufacturer of contemporary
upholstered and occasional furniture, was typical of the smaller
companies seeking a larger impact on line. In addition to
maintaining its own Web site, the company is now selling selected
products through an E-retailer called Living.com. ``If we're going
to jump into it, this is the time to jump into it,'' said Al
Lewinger, president of Directions. ``We're ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Although online retailing still accounts for less than 1 percent
of all furniture sales, representatives of Internet companies set
up tables and monitors in every available space, from lobbies to
corridors to hotel rooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``The furniture industry is highly fragmented and a little
primitive,'' admitted Linda Lewi, vice president of marketing for
Home Portfolio a Web site (www.homeportfolio.com) that offers
access to a wide range of home products, from kitchen appliances to
paint. ``But there's a vortex of energy out there right now.
Something's happening in furniture.''

BRADLEY CALLS FOR END TO NAVY BOMBING ON VIEQUES

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Democratic presidential candidate Bill Bradley
called Wednesday for the Navy and Marine Corps to permanently end
their target practice on the Puerto Rican island of Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's public stand is the same as the one that Vice
President Al Gore has reportedly voiced in private to elected
political leaders with ties to Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   After Bradley's public announcement, Gore spokeswoman Julie
Green Bataille said the vice president had no public comment to
make on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should end further use of Vieques for live-fire training,''
Bradley said in a statement issued by his campaign in West Orange,
N.J. ``It is wrong for us to continue imposing this burden on
citizens of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, who has visited Puerto Rico during his presidential
campaign, said the ``humanitarian and environmental destruction''
caused by the target practice on Vieques was ``unacceptable.'' As a
result, he said, it has been difficult to achieve economic
development on the island where more than 9,300 civilians live
adjacent to 22,000 acres of Navy-owned property.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said the Navy should find an alternative site for aerial
bombardment and naval gunfire that the Pentagon says is needed to
maintain combat skills of sailors, aviators and Marines.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president, Bradley's rival for the Democratic
presidential nomination in 2000, has voiced similar sentiments to
Puerto Rico Gov. Pedro Rossello (D), according to Rossello. The
two-term governor, Gore's fund-raising chief in Puerto Rico, has
promised to campaign for First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, a
prospective Senate candidate in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton called on Monday for a permanent end to bombing on
Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   ``Live ordnance training should not take place on a small,
inhabited island,'' she said. ``There should be an immediate and
permanent end to the bombing.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's likely rival for the Senate seat, New York Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani, (R), called on Tuesday for the Navy to end target
practice on Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy over the fate of the 58-year-old bombing range
has embroiled the Puerto Rican community, both on the island and in
New York. Puerto Ricans, who are U.S. citizens by birth, make up
about 60 percent of the 2.6 million Hispanics living in New York
State.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, who will decide the issue, awaits
recommendations from Defense Secretary William Cohen on the future
of the bombing range. The site was closed in April following a
Marine Corps bombing mishap that claimed the life of a Puerto Rican
security guard and injured four other civilian workers there.
</P>
<P>
   A four-member Pentagon review panel appointed in June at the
president's request recommended resumption of Navy and Marine Corps
target practice on the island during a five-year withdrawal period
while the Navy searched for a new location for its target practice.
</P>
<P>
   Rossello, testifying before the Senate Armed Services Committee
on Tuesday, rejected appeals for negotiations over future use of
the range and vowed that Navy and Marine Corps bombs will ``never
again'' fall on Puerto Rican territory.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has sent mixed signals in the dispute. A handwritten
note to national security adviser Samuel Berger dated July 26
called Navy bombardment ``wrong,'' and said that the Navy ``can
find a way to work around it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton also has written Senate Armed Services Committee
Chairman John Warner, R-Va., that he would do nothing that would
compromise the combat readiness of Navy and Marine Corps forces.
</P>
<P>
   Navy Secretary Richard Danzig, asked about Mrs. Clinton's
remarks Tuesday, said her comments reflect the depth of concerns
over the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things that is striking about a thing like this is
that everybody who has a set of concerns and interests expresses
themselves with regard to this,'' Danzig said. ``I'm hopeful though
that we can keep our eye on the ball _ the well-being of sailors
and Marines (and) the well-being of the people on Vieques.''

JUSTICE DEPARTMENT CALLS PUERTO RICAN GROUP AN `ONGOING THREAT' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two months after President Clinton offered clemency
to 16 Puerto Rican separatists, Justice Department documents made
public Wednesday showed that the agency recommended against
releasing the militants in late 1996 and continues to view their
nationalist group as a threat.
</P>
<P>
   A July 25, 1997, letter from Margaret Colgate Love, then the
Justice Department's pardon attorney, to White House Counsel
Charles Ruff said that a department report ``recommending denial of
clemency'' for the Puerto Ricans was sent to Ruff on Dec. 16, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The letter was released during a Senate Judiciary Committee
hearing on the Justice Department's role in the president's
decision to offer clemency to the militants, most of them
associated with the terrorist group FALN, which seeks Puerto Rico's
independence from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1974 and 1983, the FALN was linked to 130 bombings that
killed six people _ including four police officers _ and maimed
dozens of others. In addition, the group was involved in a number
of armed assaults against government buildings and trucks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apparently, the Justice Department's own people were against
letting these terrorists go,'' said Judiciary Committee Chairman
Orrin Hatch of Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Justice spokesman Myron Marlin said his department could not
discuss the letter to Ruff or its anti-clemency stance because the
president has invoked executive privilege to bar administration
officials from publicly discussing the subject or releasing
government documents related to the decision.
</P>
<P>
   According to congressional and administration sources, the
letter to Ruff was mistakenly included in the more than 10,000
pages of documents sent from the department to the committee last
month.
</P>
<P>
   ``When that many documents are involved, sometimes things slip
by that shouldn't,'' a congressional aide said.
</P>
<P>
   Another Justice Department document released at the hearing
Wednesday was a report last month from Attorney General Janet Reno
that said the FALN posed an ``ongoing threat'' to national
security.
</P>
<P>
   ``Factors which increase the present threat from these groups
include ... the impending release from prisons of members of these
groups jailed for prior violence,'' said the report, called the
department's Five-Year Interagency Counterterrorism and Technology
Crime Plan.
</P>
<P>
   Before Clinton decided in August to commute the militants'
sentences, clemency for them was strongly opposed by the federal
Bureau of Prisons and the United States Attorneys in Illinois and
Connecticut. The FBI also has opposed the clemency.
</P>
<P>
   The crimes committed by the 16 FALN members included possession
of unregistered firearms, interstate transportation of a stolen
vehicle, interference with interstate commerce by violence and
interstate transportation of firearms with intent to commit a
crime.
</P>
<P>
   None of the 16 were specifically linked to crimes that resulted
in deaths or injuries. Even so, they received sentences of 50 or
more years in prison, and most had already served more than 19
years. Their time served was greater than most sentences for such
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans and members of the law enforcement community
have accused Clinton of offering clemency to the Puerto Rican
nationalists to help his wife's all-but-announced Senate candidacy
from New York, where some 1.3 million Puerto Ricans are eligible to
vote.
</P>
<P>
   However, the president has insisted that politics played no role
in his clemency decision and has said it was based in large part by
the lengthy prison terms already served by the FALN members.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of people had signed petitions and lobbied for the
prisoners' release. They included former President Jimmy Carter,
the Rev. Desmond M. Tutu, a Nobel laureate of South Africa, and
Coretta Scott King, widow of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made the clemency offer Aug. 11. After protests from
some law enforcement groups and several Republican and Democratic
lawmakers, First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton on Sept. 4 criticized
the decision, saying her husband should withdraw it. The next day
the White House issued a statement noting that the president had
given the 16 FALN members until Sept. 10 to accept several
conditions, including one that they renounce terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 16, 14 accepted the conditions and two declined.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   President Clinton has also said that the prisoners had shown
remorse for their crimes and that they deserved a second chance.
</P>
<P>
   But a transcript released at the hearing Wednesday demonstrated
that at least one FALN member, in an April 1999 phone conversation
monitored by prison officials while he was incarcerated, appeared
unremorseful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have to ask for forgiveness from anybody,'' Adolfo
Matos said, according to the transcript. ``I have nothing to be
ashamed of or feel that I have to ask for forgiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Matos did not mention any specific plans, he said that
his prison sentence would not stop him from ``fighting'' for Puerto
Rican independence. ``My desire has gotten stronger, to the point
where I want to continue,'' he said. ``Continue to fight and get
involved with my people, because I love them.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican senators at the hearing also criticized the Justice
Department for failing to consult the victims of FALN terrorist
attacks and their families beforehand about the possible offer of
clemency or to even inform them that the prisoners were being
released.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't you think that these people deserved to be heard?'' Sen.
Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, asked Deputy Attorney General Eric
Holder.

 &HT;        Oil and Gas Industries Must Make Y2K Back-up Plans 
 &HT;     By Alex Canizares  
 &HT;    c. 1999 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Oct.20 - Y2K will be ``business as usual'' for the
oil and gas industries, but contingency plans need to be completed
before the roll-over to 2000, representatives from an industry task
force on Y2K readiness said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bottom line, the natural gas industry is in good shape for the
year 2000,'' said Oliver Richard, CEO and president of Columbia
Energy Group and representative of the President's Council on Year
2000 Conversion.
</P>
<P>
   But some gas stations, pipelines and natural gas facilities need
to make extra precautions in the next 72 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a singular accomplishment that we are reporting here
today, but I would stress, as the industry is aware, that there is
still work to be done,'' said John Koskinen, who chairs the
president's Y2K council.
</P>
<P>
   More than 90 percent of oil and gas companies met the goal of
being ready for the Year 2000 electronic glitch in a survey
released this week by the American Petroleum Institute and the
Natural Gas Council. Ninety-six percent of the industry (2,160
companies) took part in the survey, a three percent increase since
the group's last poll in May.
</P>
<P>
   ``The survey indicates that all the activities to fix the
problem are essentially coming to a close,'' said Ron Quiggers,
director of the Y2K Program for Shell Services International and
chairman of the American Petroleum Institute's Year 2000 Task
Force.
</P>
<P>
   The survey covered 99 percent of pipelines, 94 percent of
natural gas distributors, and 77 percent of the country's 180,000
retail gas stations.
</P>
<P>
   The industry's contingency plans place responsibility on the Y2K
task force to urge the 4 percent of the industry that isn't ready
for the 2000 glitch to hurry its efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Because most gas stations are privately owned, persuading all of
them to prepare for Y2K is ``no small task,'' Quiggens said.
</P>
<P>
   Shell Services International has coaxed the unprepared stations
to get ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the [Shell] stations that are not classified as making
proper progress, we have removed from our network to encourage them
to get Y2K prepared,'' Quiggens said.
</P>
<P>
   While there is not a gaurantee that the stations will report,
``there is increasing confidence that this industry will be 100
percent ready [for y2K],'' Koskinen said.
</P>
<P>
   Second, natural gas utilities and local gas stations must have
back-up plans to make sure the natural gas flow is not interrupted
that an electricity outage or a natural disaster might cause.
</P>
<P>
   In the contingency plans, interstate pipelines should store an
extra day's worth of natural gas in the countries' 400 underground
storage chambers, allowing time to fix any problems that might
arise in the transmission of natural gas from suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   Because most compressor machines that boost gas along interstate
pipelines run on some of the gas instead of electricity, a loss of
electricity would not interrupt gas flow in those cases. The
compressor machines that do use electricity will be backed up by
diesel generators.
</P>
<P>
   Natural gas utilities must plan to have extra staff on duty for
the turn-over.
</P>
<P>
   If telephone service glitches, gas utilities should have
satellite-system telephones to stay in communication with each
other.

<P>
   The words ring with romantic promise: ``Evenings in front of the
fireplace, and a morning jog along secluded pathways with familiar
footsteps at my side. . . .''
</P>
<P>
   No, it's not a personal ad. It's the come-on of a Colorado
builder making a sales pitch to single women buying houses.
</P>
<P>
   So what if those familiar footsteps belong to the dog cuddling
in the arms of a smiling, 20-something bachelorette. The message is
clear: Why wait for your prince to come? You can afford a home now
_ and ``Woof! woof!'' surely beats a husbandly whine.
</P>
<P>
   In September, Owens Corning Inc., a Chicago-based manufacturer
of building materials, introduced a television ad campaign called
``Siding Beauty'' in which a damsel awakens after 100 years to find
that the vinyl siding covering her palace has outlasted them all.
</P>
<P>
   Subliminal message: Men may come and go, but good siding is hard
to find.
</P>
<P>
   These scenarios were not scripted by writers of ``Sex and the
City,'' but by savvy marketers trying to reckon with the
fastest-growing buying force _ the single American woman.
</P>
<P>
   The statistics are head-turners. Thanks to delayed marriages,
profitable careers, higher divorce rates and longer lives, the
number of women living alone has increased by more than a third in
the last 15 years, to 30 million, according to the Census Bureau.
Nearly 57 percent of single women now own their own homes, throwing
cold dishwater on the accepted wisdom that homes are the exclusive
territory of couples with children.
</P>
<P>
   Most houses are still purchased by couples, but women living
alone, or who are single heads of household, increased as a share
of total home buyers, from 10 percent in 1985, to 15 percent in
1997. ``That's a huge number, very dramatic,'' said Kermit Baker,
an economist at Harvard University's Joint Center for Housing
Studies. For 1996 and 1997, single women outpaced single men in
making home ownership an investment goal.
</P>
<P>
   In the home-improvement arena, the weekend warrior is a she,
taking on small fix-its that once fell to the now-vanishing
handyman. At the Home Depot in Clifton, N.J., last week, Denise
Ramos, 36, was carrying a bundle of uncut trim she needed to finish
the porch of a new house she had bought three months ago for
$133,000. To pay for the house, Ms. Ramos, who is divorced and has
three children, holds down two jobs. ``I wanted more space and a
better life for my children and for myself,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A half million people tune in weekly to PBS' ``Handy Ma'am,''
starring Beverly DeJulio, a divorced mom and former dressmaker in
Chicago. The magazine This Old House, a hammer-thumping bible for
the mustard-stained T-shirt set, is undergoing its own renovation;
a new editor, Donna Sapolin, wants to transform it into a guidebook
for do-it-yourself lovebirds.
</P>
<P>
   Remember when hardware stores sold tools packaged with pictures
of scantily clad lovelies? Now, women in hard hats adorn the
labels, women are likely to be buying the tools and women are often
even running the stores. At Ace Hardware, the international chain,
more and more women own or manage its stores.
</P>
<P>
   With their ``Siding Beauty'' ad campaign, Owens Corning was
acting on a company survey on the next generation's home ownership
priorities; 70 percent of female respondents between ages 23 and 35
claimed owning a home was their highest priority, above buying a
car and paying off debts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have seen a tremendous shift in women's roles in home
improvement over the last 20 years,'' said Jerry Oleshansky, the
company's vice president of marketing. ``Just like their baby
boomer mothers, these Gen X and Gen Y women are taking a hands-on
approach, doing everything from planning the project to buying the
products and doing the actual work.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's changing the industry down to its subflooring. Eight
years ago, Nancy Stoner, a divorced mother of two, tried to build a
home for herself and her sons in Lexington, Ky., but was forced to
give up her dream when financing fell through. ``Back then, it felt
like the way car dealers used to treat women by asking, `So where's
your husband?''' said Ms. Stoner, a 49-year old schoolteacher. ``I
couldn't go through with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Her father, who built several houses when she was growing up,
inspired her to keep trying. Today, Ms. Stoner is customizing a
$120,000 carriage house with Ball Homes of Lexington. She's removed
walls between rooms, added bigger windows and requested a walk-out
basement that works as a separate entrance for her boys, who are
now in college.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time was a lot different,'' she said. ``Everyone accepted
me as I was, a single woman.''
</P>
<P>
   Donald Ball, the co-founder of Ball Homes, said about 30 percent
of his business is selling to single women. ``They seem to like our
garden-type houses with the smaller backyards walled-in,'' he said.
``They like the security.''
</P>
<P>
   In Detroit, Bernard Glieberman, the president of Crosswinds
Communities, called single women ``probably the fastest growing
segment of the buying public in the last five years.'' He said,
``The only thing we can figure is that young males think they're
invincible and don't bother much about living arrangements, while
young women think, `I need some security,' and buy a home.''
</P>
<P>
   While the company, which builds 700 houses a year, has sold
frequently to single women, it does not create plans specifically
for that market. ``We haven't changed anything,'' Glieberman said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It was the industry's impassive attitude _ acknowledging that
single women are buying homes in droves, while not doing much to
appease them _ that finally drove David Miles, a real estate
consultant, to create his ad featuring the young woman with her
trusty dog for McStain Enterprises of Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is becoming obvious that single professional women have a
different time line for their lives than men,'' he said. ``As they
begin to make more money and become self-sufficient, they're less
willing to commit to relationships until they're very sure of
themselves. But they still want that home.'' Builders have been
slow to design specifically for single women, Miles contends,
because ``most builders are small local companies, and they don't
understand who their customers are.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They've only just figured out the market for empty-nesters,''
he continued. ``They're going to need at least three to five years
of media attention to get this trend.''
</P>
<P>
   The ad for McStain did the job, and then some. The company
received calls not only from single women interested in buying, but
also from men wanting to know if that girl really lived in that
house because they'd like to meet her.
</P>
<P>
   If builders are late to the party, home-store retailers are
eager to get women on their dance card now. Research has told them
that women make 50 percent of the purchases in the $30.2 billion
hardware and home renovation industry. Taking note, Ace Hardware
changed its motto from ``The helpful handy guys'' to ``The helpful
handy folks.'' Too subtle? They also added softer lighting, browser
displays and hunter-green decor to stores, in place of bare
concrete walls. Seminars for staff on how to relate to women
customers have put Ace in touch with its inner handy gal, said Ann
Marie Hickey, a spokeswoman at Ace headquarters in Oak Brook, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's largest home improvement chain, Home Depot, has set
out in earnest to woo women to the warehouse. In 1998, the company
settled a blistering lawsuit, in which 7,000 of its female
employees claimed discrimination in hiring, pay and promotions, and
paid out $65 million. The company recently began Home Depot
University, with seminars for renovation neophytes, from installing
vinyl flooring to reroofing. About 50 percent of the student body
are women, said John Simley, the chain's Northeast spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Though Simley said the store didn't carry gender-geared
products, ``we do carry Ralph Lauren paint,'' he admitted, adding,
``I, as an ordinary guy, don't give two hoots about it, but a woman
may respond to a name brand.''
</P>
<P>
   Marian Salzman, 40 and single, is a co-author, with Ira
Matathia, of ``Next: Trends for the Near-Future'' (Overlook Press,
1999), a study that identified single women as a retailing force to
reckon with on an international scale.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies have traditionally only sold to single women in the
woe-is-me category, with low-cal diets and single-portion meals,
based on the idea that if a woman is not in a relationship, she
must be doing everything possible to land one,'' said Ms. Salzman,
a trend spotter for Young &AMP; Rubicam. ``There's no celebration of
the single woman as a satisfied consumer, who is buying not in a
must-have mode but a would-like-to-have style,'' she added. ``It's
a very different situation, and we're going to see a lot of changes
in the market place.''
</P>
<P>
   In the suburbs, where the handyman has disappeared from under
the sink, often heading for greener pastures as a contractor, women
are picking up the slack.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can't get a small-job person anymore,'' Lois Slocum said, with
good-natured resignation. Mrs. Slocum, 62, and her family have
taken over the neighborhood family store, Handyman Hardware, in
Stamford, Conn., ever since her husband contracted severe Lyme
disease 14 years ago. It's a traditional outfit with a
nontraditional staff: her daughters, Nancy Ligi, 37, and Michelle
Arvan, 28.
</P>
<P>
   The women (Jessica, 11, Mrs. Slocum's niece, helps out on
weekends) cut keys, repair chain saws, rewire lamps and swap sports
scores with the male clientele. From Mrs. Slocum's vantage point,
``Men don't have an idea how to fix a toilet, so it's the wife
who's stuck at home who has to learn how.'' She added: ``Women seem
to learn the proper way. They read the directions. Men jury-rig.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonnie Burkert, 35, is her own handyman. A record company
executive who shares an apartment with a roommate in Manhattan's
Greenwich Village, Ms. Burkert has a toolbox that her mother helped
her stock. ``Those gruff guys at the hardware store looked us up
and down as if we didn't know anything. And then my mother pulled
her list out with the size of the nails, the grade of the sandpaper
and all the right screwdrivers with their own screw heads, and she
had them running all over the store.''
</P>
<P>
   This Gen X bachelorette calls her apartment the Den of the
Goddesses, and has furnished it with tapestries and candles. She
likes it so much, she said, that when Mr. Right comes along, ``he
can move in.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Burkert was recently featured in ``On the Loose'' (William
Morrow, 1999) by Melissa Roth, an account of a year in the life of
three women in their late 20s and early 30s. Ms. Roth, 32, has
spent considerable time studying women in what she calls ``the
panic years'' and has noticed that retailers market to her age
group ``as if all we do is buy clothes.'' She added: ``But that's
only true for the first 25 years. After that, you realize that
you're not seeing your clothes, you're looking at your crummy couch
most of the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, Ms. Roth, a Manhattanite, went to Janovic Plaza
where she said she encountered ``nothing but single women shopping
for paint.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Here we all are,'' she said, ``ready to commit, maybe not to a
man, but definitely to a place of our own.''
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Woolf had it wrong. Why settle for a room, when you can
have the whole house?

   KORLA, China _ Pandemonium!
</P>
<P>
   Two of China's national treasures, a pair of panda bears, will
be going to Zoo Atlanta by the end of this month, the dominant
state television network here CCTV-1 reported late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But whether 2-year-old female Lun Lun and her 2-year-old male
pal Yang Yang were really about to split from the Chengdu Research
Base of Giant Panda Breeding appeared to be still slightly up in
the air Thursday, despite this unqualified report to millions of
viewers on Chinese government-run television.
</P>
<P>
   Late Wednesday night, Sarah Bexell, Zoo Atlanta's researcher on
the ground in China, said she had no official confirmation that
China's ruling State Council had finally approved the long-delayed
export permit.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be great news,'' said Bexell after hearing about
the TV report.
</P>
<P>
   Xinhua, China's official news agency, carried nothing about the
prospect that the two pre-adolescent fuzz balls had been given
formal permission to grow up half-way around the world in
air-conditioned cages in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Without signed export licenses, the pandas aren't going
anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Zoo Atlanta and its winged partner United Parcel
Service were already deep into contingency planning to fly the two
pandas out of Beijing International Airport at 5 a.m. (local time)
on Oct. 28.
</P>
<P>
   Zoo Atlanta's ranking veterinarian, Dr. Rita McManamon, has
reservations to arrive in Beijing and go on to Chengdu on Sunday to
accompany Lun Lun and Yang Yang on their flight to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   If there is no pandemic problem, they should cross the
international dateline and arrive at Atlanta's Hartsfield
International Airport at around 9 a.m. (EDT) on Oct. 28.
</P>
<P>
   The television news segment was built on an interview taped
earlier in the day with Bexell, who was asked by a CCTV reporter
about her research and how it will help protect the giant panda, an
endangered species in China.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of the report, the Chinese journalist said simply
that the two pandas will head to Atlanta by the end of the month.
The television news did not mention the need for export permits or
the delay already keeping Zoo Atlanta guessing about when or
whether it will receive the pandas.
</P>
<P>
   An expected Oct. 7 departure was missed for lack of the
requisite Chinese export approvals. Now the paperwork has been
bumped all the way to the top of the bureaucracy, awaiting approval
only from the State Council and Prime Minister Zhu Rongji.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   After setting another shipment date of Oct. 28, Zoo Atlanta, the
Chinese panda keepers and UPS have set in motion the plan to
transport Lun Lun and Yang Yang from their home amid bamboo
thickets to their new home in the southeastern U.S.
</P>
<P>
   The two animals, who are at a rolly-polly rambunctious stage of
panda life, have been spending time just about every day in the
cages provided by UPS to get used to their temporary habitat for
the 10,000-mile air trip.
</P>
<P>
   A UPS spokeswoman said its special ``Panda Express'' plane,
painted with a panda motif and donated for this flight, is planned
to arrive in Beijing on the morning of Wed., Oct. 27. This assumes
that UPS is granted the necessary landing rights to fly into
Beijing airport.
</P>
<P>
   Later that day, the pandas will fly to Beijing on a Chinese
commercial flight from the Chengdu base where they were born, then
hitch up with the UPS plane.
</P>
<P>
   The UPS plane, the vet and the pandas are scheduled to depart
around 5 a.m. on Oct. 28 Beijing time, arriving in time for
Atlantans' morning coffee break.
</P>
<P>
   That is, it will happen if China's bureaucrats come through with
the export permit.

MAKING BOOKS: GAY BOOKS ARE FACING THE DOWNSIDE OF ACCEPTANCE

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The great vexation for lesbians and gay men in book publishing
has been that their assimilation into that world in particular and
into the cultural life in general has made it more difficult for
their books to get published and be sold, rather than easier. That
is because, in part, the first gay literature to come to public
attention was considered notorious no matter its quality, and its
celebrity appealed to a certain dark stealth when, for instance,
one purchased Radclyffe Hall's landmark novel ``The Well of
Loneliness.'' But to make it to the book racks now, gay writing
must compete with the mainstream work that, at least in some
instances, it has become. Acceptance, as every minority group has
found, has its difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   What started as a great adventure is now about marketing and
visibility, and this leads to the Publishing Triangle, an
association of about 225 gay and lesbian editors, publishers,
writers, agents, librarians and teachers. It was founded in 1989
not to fight discrimination, which was not viewed as a big problem
in book publishing, but to foster networking and mentoring. ``Today
it's about selling books, helping the gay bookstores and small gay
presses to survive; a different emphasis,'' said its president,
Charles Flowers.
</P>
<P>
   To publicize itself the organization holds seminars, publishes a
newsletter and gives annual awards for gay books. This summer it
compiled a list of the 100 greatest gay novels. (Thomas Mann's
``Death in Venice'' was No. 1.) Soon to come: the 100 greatest
nonfiction titles. Still, as is the case with other assimilations,
appealing to the professional progeny of the first two generations
of Triangle members is strenuous.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Denneny, a senior editor at St. Martin's Press, and the
editor of Randy Shilts' seminal best-selling ``And the Band Played
On'' (St. Martin's Press, 1987), said that ``the last generation in
the organization has not replaced itself with the younger editorial
assistants, younger publicists.''
</P>
<P>
   If a gay book sells 20,000 or 25,000 copies _ a robust sale for
most literary novels _ it is considered a smashing commercial
success; 10,000 copies sold makes for a happy publisher. But the
definition of such a book is fuzzy. Does it mean the author is gay?
Does the book have to have gay characters? A gay subject? Was ``The
Band'' a gay book, or did its plummy sales and crossover readership
make it mainstream? And do sales determine category?
</P>
<P>
   Novels like ``The Well of Loneliness'' (1928), Gore Vidal's
``City and the Pillar'' (Dutton, 1948) and ``Rubyfruit Jungle''
(Daughters Inc., 1973) by Rita Mae Brown were considered dangerous,
to be tucked under their arms in brown wrapping paper. Carole
DeSanti, editor at large at Penguin Putnam, said: ``A gay book
could break out as a cult favorite. Gay books were a novelty for a
while, but now the gay-content books are subject to the rigors of
publishing's economic tracking system.'' But this year ``The
Hours'' (Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux) by Michael Cunningham won the
Pulitzer Prize for fiction, a true coming out.
</P>
<P>
   What has happened to gay books in this ``tracking system''?
Quality, more than shock, has taken its toll. Will Schwalbe, an
executive editor at Hyperion, said that after a flush of
high-quality gay books, ``there was a rush of modest-quality gay
books and readers turned away from that market.'' He added, ``I
don't think people realize how many talented writers we lost to
AIDS, but also how many dedicated readers we lost.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's more than that. Nearly every gay editor and gay agent
and gay bookstore owner believes that young lesbians and gay men
don't read as much as their elders did, and when they do read they
don't necessarily make a dash for the gay-book racks. Moreover,
bookstores specializing in gay writing are suffering from the same
chain-store squeeze that hurts mainstream independent stores. Books
with gay subject matter are cheaper at Borders, for instance, than
at a gay shop that can't offer a high-volume discount.
</P>
<P>
   Norman Laurilla, owner of A Different Light bookstores in New
York, West Hollywood and San Francisco, said that he believed that
his customers ``more than the general public, have computers at
home, which take time away from reading, but when they want books
they buy with quick-stop shopping on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Initially, gay book stores were part of a political movement
of sorts, he said. ``Then we had to become booksellers and business
people, and younger gays don't remember those days. They're
perfectly comfortable picking up books where they can get them at
best value. A gay bookstore is not as wondrous to them as it was to
us in the '70's when our customers were overwhelmed because they
never saw that stuff before.''
</P>
<P>
   So for nearly three decades gay people involved in the
publication and sales of lesbian and gay writing have struggled to
get more of their books published and have succeeded, only to find
that their victory has come back to haunt them and perhaps put many
of these stores out of business, a trend the Publishing Triangle is
trying to reverse.
</P>
<P>
   Malaga Baldi, an agent, said advances for gay authors had shrunk
because publishers were less willing to gamble on the idea that gay
people, who as a group have a relatively high income, are going to
use it for books. ``I find fewer people to go to to sell gay
books,'' she said, ``so I'm doing more business with smaller houses
outside of New York, but it's scary.'' She said that some
publishers would not put the words ``gay'' or ``lesbian'' on their
jackets. ``Perhaps in the short run it hurts if they do, but in the
long run it's good,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, acceptance and affirmation do have their happy surprises
as well as their melancholy. Andrew Holleran, a gay novelist, said
that last year he was teaching creative writing at American
University to a class that included three gay students. ``I was
flabbergasted that these kids submitted gay stories and were
discussing them in class and no one batted an eyelash,'' he said.
``It's very strange being assimilated and writing material no
longer considered different. The newness is gone, and there's the
other countermovement: You don't want to be considered a gay
writer, and you feel marginally diminished.''

`TOBACCO WARS': JOE CAMEL, THE MARLBORO MAN AND THE CYNICAL ART OF
DENIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes at end of review)  
(bl) 
 By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   By now few viewers can be astonished to learn that cigarette
makers have not been models of candor when it comes to their
products' effects on the health of their customers. But a little
recapitulation can't hurt, and ``Tobacco Wars,'' which begins
Thursday night on The Learning Channel, is a forceful reminder of
an industry's half-century of efforts to obscure, obfuscate and
delude.
</P>
<P>
   After a brief reminder by a former researcher for Philip Morris
of the lure of nicotine and the efficiency of the cigarette as ``a
drug delivery device,'' the three-part documentary moves briskly
into the marketing and advertising techniques that helped propel
tobacco into a $200 billion business. The old advertisements add a
touch of nostalgia to the program's grim indictment.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the 1930s, a few surgeons, notably Michael
DeBakey, became convinced that there was a connection between
smoking and lung cancer, but their findings had little impact.
Instead, among the side effects of World War II was an explosion of
the smoking habit.
</P>
<P>
   With postwar studies confirming a statistical relationship
between smoking and cancer, the industry went into a denial phase
that would last decades. Company executives and advertising
professionals recall some of the industry's favored techniques,
like playing up the fact that many doctors smoked and that some
even recommended smoking for the relief of stress and throat
irritation.
</P>
<P>
   As the link between smoking and lung cancer became more widely
accepted, the tobacco companies undertook what is described as
``the longest and costliest public relations campaign in history.''
A marketing executive tells how filtered cigarettes were designed
to make smokers absorb even more smoke: ``Really it was naughty.''
Another advertising man says of the slogans and images (the
Marlboro Man) that lulled people's fears: ``Deceptive? Of course
it's deceptive. What are we going to say, `Buy our product, it'll
kill you'?''
</P>
<P>
   After the Office of the Surgeon General issued its famous report
in 1964 connecting smoking and cancer, the industry's lawyers
joined in promoting the idea of a warning label, their strategy
being to divert legal responsibility from producers to consumers.
Walter Cronkite, the program's narrator, reports on their success:
``All attempts at litigation against them failed throughout this
period. And most cigarette smokers just kept on smoking.''
</P>
<P>
   But increasingly, big tobacco found itself on the defensive.
When opponents began running effective anti-smoking commercials,
the industry agreed to discontinue cigarette advertising on
television and radio in hopes of defusing the attack. But
billboards appealing to the young (Joe Camel) kept luring new
customers for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tobacco Wars'' brings the shabby story up to the present, when
cigarette makers have been embarrassed by the exposure of their
efforts to conceal the results of their own research. The famous
scene of the companies' chief executives' swearing to a
congressional committee that they did not believe nicotine was
addictive remains an embarrassing moment in their careers and a
tribute to the revelatory power of television.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the courts have not been kind to big tobacco:
suits by the states and by survivors of cigarette smokers have
forced the industry into costly settlements. (In the latest effort
to polish its image, Philip Morris issued a belated acknowledgment
last week that smoking was related to disease.)
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of this history of corporate deception and social
irresponsibility, Steven Goldstone, who was chairman of RJR Nabisco
when it split off its R.J. Reynolds Tobacco unit in March, says,
``I think we could have done a better job as an industry over the
past 40 years.'' That's putting it, as the advertisements used to
say, mildly.

HOUSE CONSERVATIVE ISSUE BUDGETARY WARNING TO CLINTON 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House conservatives warned President Clinton on
Wednesday they will defeat any attempt to raise taxes to pay for
his spending priorities, a shot across the bow as budget
negotiators opened their first session on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, meanwhile, signed a $99 billion spending bill for
housing, veterans and space programs, hailing the measure as
symbolic of the bipartisan cooperation that can be displayed
between the White House and Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But while Clinton talked peace, he also prepared for budgetary
war, suggesting he would hold the $268 billion defense spending
bill, containing lucrative pork for Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott's hometown in Mississippi, until negotiators reach agreement
on all outstanding funding issues.
</P>
<P>
   A day after Clinton met with congressional leaders and they
agreed on a framework to begin resolving a spending impasse, the
spirit of bipartisan cooperation seemed to wane.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are here today to send one very clear message: Mr.
President. No means no,'' said Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas.
``When the Republicans say we're not going to touch the Social
Security surplus, we mean it. When we say that we're not going to
raise taxes, we mean it.''
</P>
<P>
   DeLay said Republican leaders left the White House session with
the understanding that Clinton would keep all the Social Security
surplus off limits and forgo tax increases. He termed ``very
unsettling'' comments made later by Democrats that taxes remained
on the table.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told reporters that he realized his proposal to raise
cigarette taxes by 55 cents a pack would not be acceptable to
Republicans. However, he said his spending priorities were ``quite
modest'' and that a way would be found to pay for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``So all I said was that I realized they weren't going to accept
my proposal, but that now we were talking about much more modest
amounts. ... I thought we could find a way to pay for them that
they (Republicans) could live with,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also kept Republicans bristling by saying he agreed to
avoid the Social Security surplus but that the GOP already had
dipped into the extra cash. Republicans, in turn, continued touting
a Congressional Budget Office letter that says they had not spent
the surplus.
</P>
<P>
   The tax issue is just one of many that White House and Congress
must resolve by a Tuesday deadline set for themselves. Negotiators
held an opening session on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   The 2000 fiscal year began Oct. 1, but Congress has not
completed work on all 13 spending bills. Clinton, with his action
Wednesday, has signed six into law, two remain on his desk and he
vetoed two. Three others are pending in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Again I say, in spite of all the conflicts of the last few
weeks, we still have a great opportunity to make this a season of
progress and work together to pass a budget that lives within its
means and lives up to our values,'' Clinton said as he signed the
spending bill funding the Veterans Affairs, Housing and Urban
Development, and independent agencies such as NASA.
</P>
<P>
   The measure provides $13.7 billion for the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration, an additional $100 million over current
funding. The House wanted to cut NASA by $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives NASA the resources it needs to probe the mysteries of
space,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   It also provides money for an additional 60,000 home vouchers
for low-income families, provides $70 million for Rural/Urban
Empowerment Zones that provide tax breaks for businesses moving
into designated areas and provides $19.8 billion for medical care
for veterans. It includes $2.5 billion in emergency funding for
victims of Hurricane Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he would not decide until next week whether to sign
a defense spending bill that Republicans are pressing him to
approve immediately.
</P>
<P>
   It contains a 4.8 percent pay increase for military personnel.
But, it also includes a $375 million downpayment on a $1.5 billion
``minicarrier'' being built in Pascagoula, Miss., the home town of
Lott. The Navy did not want the ship until 2011.
</P>
<P>
   The defense bill may become the White House's hold card as
Republicans push for an across-the-board spending cut. Republicans
want to exempt the defense bill from reductions, but the White
House contends the GOP would have to cut 17 percent from other
bills if they exclude the military.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he outlined the priorities to Republicans that he
intends to fight for. They include more funds to place 100,000
teachers in the classroom, to hire more police, to help finance the
Middle East peace process, to help reduce Russia's nuclear arsenal,
to pay for debt relief for poor nations and to pay the back dues
owed the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Despite negotiations, Republicans moved ahead to send remaining
spending measures to the president. The House narrowly passed, on a
215-213 vote, a $38 billion funding bill for the departments of
commerce, state and justice. Clinton has said he would veto the
measure as written.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the House also takes up its version of education
policy, eliminating Clinton's program for 100,000 classroom
teachers enacted last year and turning over the money to states in
the form of block grants.
</P>

`LOST':   A LONG-MISSING BROTHER IS DISTURBINGLY PRESENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Germany)  (Eds: Publication notes at end of review.) (DW) 
 By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the youthful narrator tells it in ``Lost,'' Hans-Ulrich
Treichel's bitterly comic first novel, his family has long been
haunted by his missing older brother, Arnold.
</P>
<P>
   It seems that just after World War II, during ``the long trek
from the East to the West'' in flight from the Russians, the family
was set upon by Russian soldiers. Thinking they would be shot, the
narrator's mother put Arnold in the arms of a passing woman without
even telling her his name.
</P>
<P>
   ``But she'd been too quick in fearing for her life and the life
of her child,'' the narrator reports, ``and if she were honest,
she'd been too quick to give the child away.'' Instead of shooting
the family, the soldiers ``had thrown themselves on my mother,''
although ``I wasn't really clear what exactly it meant when the
Russian threw themselves on someone.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever since this incident, before the narrator was born, the
atmosphere in the family has been poisoned. ``From the day of my
birth, guilt and shame had ruled the family, without my knowing
why.'' His mother keeps herself from weeping by busying herself
around the house. His father immerses himself in his successful
food wholesaling business.
</P>
<P>
   The narrator, secretly rather pleased that he doesn't have to
share his parents with Arnold, feels guilty about any pleasure he
takes in life. He tries to comfort his mother about Arnold's fate.
```Maybe he was lucky,' I said, `and they named him Arnold again,'
at which my mother looked at me with such incomprehension and
sadness that the blood rushed to my head and I was ashamed.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, as his mother recovers in a clinic from a breakdown, his
father tells him that the authorities may have found Arnold in a
Red Cross foundling home. Like their lost child, ``foundling 2307''
has ``a noticeable cowlick in his hair on the right side of his
head.'' Records show that he was on the same postwar trek from East
to West and that it was ``the same day, 20 January 1945, when the
boy was laid in an unknown woman's arms.'' Finally, a photograph
reveals that ``the boy had an absolutely astonishing resemblance to
me, his putative brother.''
</P>
<P>
   The narrator reports: ``The supposedly amazing likeness made me
feel less and less like myself. Every look in the mirror grated on
my nerves. I didn't see me, I saw Arnold, and he was getting less
appealing all the time. If only he had starved to death during the
escape. Instead he was interfering in my life. And in my
appearance. I longed for a Third World War so that he would starve
to death after all. But the Third World War never came.''
</P>
<P>
   The authorities, however, will not let his parents visit the
possibly Arnold. Psychological damage might be done if the
identification is in error. Tests must be administered,
fingerprints and blood samples analyzed by the Institute of
Forensic Medicine at the University of Muenster. Expert opinion
states that while ``I, the legitimate child, was `possibly and even
probably positively' the issue of both my mother and father,''
foundling 2307 ``was `possibly but not probably positively' the
issue of my parents.''
</P>
<P>
   The family travels to Heidelberg for further testing: a Rohrer
Index, taken with wooden calipers that pinch the stomach; ``the
relative width of the angle of the jaw,'' which, says a professor
at the Institute of Forensic Anthropology, ``can be the decisive
factor.'' Doubt about the relationship increases. Mother grows more
depressed. Father flies into a rage and suffers a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   What does ``Lost'' signify, besides the pain of sibling rivalry
and the Kafkaesque nightmare of bureaucracy? Long after finishing
Treichel's mesmerizing tale, I was struck by how perfect an
allegory it is of the division and reunification of East and West
Germany, with the snarling of red tape interfering with the
recognition of human fraternity.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Lost'' doesn't have to mean. The narrator's voice _
beautifully translated by Carol Brown Janeway, who did ``The
Reader,'' by Bernhard Schlink, among other books _ won't let you go
as it draws you into its labyrinth of absurdity. Take the account
of the family's semiannual pig's-head feast, where the guests'
hearty tales of slaughtering animals ``acted as a tranquilizer on
my father, so that this man who was otherwise so choleric and prone
to rages had such a forgiving look in his eyes that I thought I
would never have to be afraid of him again.''
</P>
<P>
   Or take the grotesque conversation of the hearse driver the
family happens to lunch with in the canteen of the Forensic
Anthropology Laboratory. While the narrator searches for death in
the hearse driver _ ``Death had a ruddy face and brownish teeth
with a gap in the lower jaw. . . . The hair was shiny and obviously
had hair cream in it. Death used hair cream'' _ the hearse driver
speaks of the latest fashions in shrouds and the newly completed
Heidelberg South Crematorium.
</P>
<P>
   ``To show him how perfectly clean and hygienic his cremation
ovens were in operation,'' the director had recently removed a few
remaining little bones from the ash pan, put one of them in his
mouth and ``chewed around on it and asked him, the hearse driver,
whether he wanted to try it once too.'' The hearse driver declined
the offer, remarking that ``everything had its limits, although he
had absolutely no doubt that the ovens operated completely
hygienically.''
</P>
<P>
   After the tests the family leaves the Forensic Anthropology
Laboratory and walks on a bridge over the Neckar River that is
famous for its swaying. ``The bridge turned out to be a massive
stone bridge, built of huge, weathered, brown-stained blocks, and
it didn't seem to sway at all,'' the narrator reports. ``I banished
my sadness by jumping in the air several times and landing as hard
as I could, to make the bridge start swaying after all. I wouldn't
have minded at all right then if the bridge had collapsed. But it
didn't. It didn't even sway. Not the slightest movement to be felt.
My parents paid no attention to my antics and were walking on.''
</P>
<P>
   As happens throughout his brilliant tragicomic story, the world
simply won't move for him.  &QL;

to stop him. It was all part of the Fox Family Channel's taping of
World Magic Awards. ``We were told it would be a magic trick and
that he would be wearing a blindfold that he could see through,''

<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, TEXAS _ Tang Min and Zhao Min Hao are a Hollywood
casting director's dream of what a ballet duo should look like.
</P>
<P>
   Both are handsome, and they're perfectly matched physically at 5
foot 6 and 5 foot 8. More than that, as they proved in their area
debut at a recent outdoor dance festival in Dallas, they share a
rare expressive grace and apparently effortless ballet technique.
</P>
<P>
   Tang, 37, the female half of the couple, and Zhao, 36, have
known each other since the age of 11, and have been married for 12
years. They experienced the Chinese Cultural Revolution together
and have lived in three countries together.
</P>
<P>
   Born in different provincial cities in China, they met in 1973,
when they arrived at the country's principal ballet school in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the Russian system,'' says Tang, the more outgoing
of the two.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, they look at your face,'' she explains. ``Then they
measure your body. Then they look at your parents to see what you
will look like later. They check everything. And if they choose
you, the government pays for everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither found the experience of leaving home at an early age
damaging or painful.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of fun for a young kid,'' Tang says. ``You live, eat
and sleep there. The government pays for everything.''
</P>
<P>
   And they quickly became accustomed to stringent training _
although, Tang admits, ``Sometimes we cried.''
</P>
<P>
   Typically, the young dance students rise at 5:30 a.m., run
outdoors and train for two hours before breakfast every day, study
ballet for three hours in the morning and three hours in the
afternoon, and learn gymnastics as well as dance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes your body very strong,'' Zhao says. ``If you want to
be good, you have to work hard.''
</P>
<P>
   The lingering effects of the Cultural Revolution, so devastating
to many artists and intellectuals in China, were relatively
painless for the young dancers. They had to spend only a few weeks
a year on a farm or in the army, and the physical work there was
hardly as stringent as their training at ballet school. Both recall
the short stints in the countryside to have been almost vacations
compared with their usual lives at a ballet academy.
</P>
<P>
   The 1970s brought increasing interchange between China and the
rest of the world, and a revolution in ballet repertoire within
China. Ballet training and style, introduced by the Russians after
the communist takeover in 1949, had been classical. But the
repertoire had been dominated by communist propaganda works. With
the 1970s, traditional classical works such as ``Swan Lake'' and
``Sleeping Beauty'' were introduced.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, when Zhao was 18, he was selected along with four other
young male dancers from Beijing to study for the summer with Ben
Stevenson at the Houston Ballet. That gave Zhao his first view of
life outside China.
</P>
<P>
   Although they had known each other since childhood, it wasn't
until several years later, while working together in the grand pas
de deux from ``Don Quixote,'' that Tang and Zhao fell in love. When
they married in 1984, both had several competition wins to their
credit, and they settled in for several years at the Beijing
Ballet, which provided living quarters as well as studio space.
</P>
<P>
   But they had also tasted the freedom, seen the new dance
developments and glimpsed the lifestyles of the West _ and had
decided that that was what they wanted. In 1988, they obtained
visas to come to the United States, where they joined the
Pittsburgh Ballet. Because of immigration laws, they had to move to
Canada after only eight months. Ten years later, protected from
deportation to China by their Canadian citizenship, and longing for
a warmer climate, they applied to the Fort Worth Dallas Ballet.
Although they're not media superstars, they have a strong
reputation within the dance community.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a friend who couldn't believe that I made them
audition,'' Fort Worth Dallas Ballet artistic director Benjamin
Houk says.
</P>
<P>
   Their hearts are in China, which they visit annually, but their
home now is in Fort Worth. Besides sharing a profession, they share
a passion for fishing and the outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   And they find that their constant togetherness is an advantage
as partners in dance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We push each other,'' Zhao says, describing their professional
relationship in the dance studio. ``We're not polite.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We fight, we argue, but that's normal,'' Tang says. ``The
result is always good.'' .MDBO/.MDNM/ (Visit the Star-Telegram's

COURT IN JAPAN HALTS PUBLICATION OF DEAD AUTHOR'S LETTERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By HOWARD W. FRENCH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   TOKYO _ Reviving the controversy that followed novelist Yukio
Mishima throughout his life, a Tokyo court has banned further
publication of a memoir by a writer who says he had a homosexual
relationship with him. The court ruled Monday that the use of
Mishima's letters represented copyright infringement.
</P>
<P>
   In its decision, which could have far-reaching consequences for
Japanese publishing, the court held that Mishima's letters to Jiro
Fukushima were protected under the country's copyright laws and
could not be used without permission of Mishima's estate. Fukushima
and his publisher, Bungei Shunju Ltd., one of Japan's largest
producers of books and magazines, were ordered to pay $47,000 in
damages to the plaintiffs, Mishima's son and daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Mishima, perhaps Japan's most widely known modern writer,
committed ritual suicide by sword, or seppuku, at age 45 in 1970.
His death was an act of protest after failing to persuade the
country's Self Defense Force to stage a coup d'etat and renounce
the U.S.-imposed postwar constitution that places a perpetual ban
on aggressive military action by Japan.
</P>
<P>
   During the latter part of his career, Mishima, a prolific author
whose works include ``The Sound of Waves'' and ``The Temple and the
Golden Pavilion,'' became one of Japan's most flamboyant public
figures as he earned a reputation as a crusader for
ultra-conservative and nationalistic causes. He led an open, if not
explicitly acknowledged, life as a homosexual, even as he
maintained the appearance of happily married family life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sword and Winter Red,'' Fukushima's memoir, contains 15 of
Mishima's letters and was originally published last year. It caused
a great stir among the public, particularly for its descriptions of
its author's sexual liaison with Mishima.
</P>
<P>
   Fukushima, a novelist and former high school teacher of
literature, recounts, among other episodes, how he first approached
Mishima in a letter asking him for details about a homosexual club
described in Mishima's writings.
</P>
<P>
   From the exchange of correspondence, it appears that Mishima
took Fukushima to the actual club in Tokyo upon which the fictional
account was based, and the two subsequently became lovers.
Throughout their relationship, however, Fukushima used the
respectful term sensei, translatable as teacher or master, to refer
to the famous author.
</P>
<P>
   Fukushima was a relatively obscure writer until the publication
of his Mishima book, but in the space of 10 days more than 90,000
copies were sold. The memoir's cover illustration, a painting of
the martyrdom of St. Sebastian, depicts of a young man in bondage
being pierced by arrows.
</P>
<P>
   Although Mishima dealt extensively with the theme of
homosexuality in writings like ``Confessions of a Mask,'' open
declarations of homosexuality were unusual in the Japan of his day.
</P>
<P>
   The unusually successful commercial run of Fukushima's book was
quickly halted by a lawsuit by Mishima's two adult children, Noriko
Tomita, 40, and Jichiro Hiraoka, 37. The legal action resulted in a
``provisional disposition'' in their favor in Tokyo District Court,
in which the judge ordered a ban on further publication and the
recall of copies already sold. In the end, however, only about
10,000 copies were successfully recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an epoch-making decision that the letters be recognized
as the author's works by the court,'' said Katsuhiko Konno, the
lawyer representing Mishima's children. ``You are free to sell a
painting that is given to you by a painter, but you are not allowed
to reprint it, make a collection and sell them. The same can be
said for letters.''
</P>
<P>
   In Monday's ruling, which upholds the initial ban, the presiding
judge, Toshiaki Iimura essentially agreed. Publication of Mishima's
personal letters ``infringed the right to take copies of them,
which is given exclusively to the bereaved family,'' he wrote. ``If
Mishima were alive, the publication would have also infringed the
right to publish them, which would be given exclusively to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Correspondence between Mishima and translator Donald Keene and
with other Japanese novelists like Yasunari Kawabata has also been
published recently but has not prompted legal action by the
author's family.
</P>
<P>
   The decision appears to be the first instance in Japan in which
a copyright has been granted for letters. If upheld, it stands to
reverse a venerable literary tradition, both in Japan and
internationally, of the free posthumous publication of
correspondence.
</P>
<P>
   Hideki Amemiya, an official from Fukushima's publisher, told the
Kyodo News Agency that an appeal would be filed.

 &HT;    Blacks can't ignore AIDS epidemic
 &HT;    (EDs: This is an editorial from Wednesday's Atlanta
Constitution.)
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ More leaders in the African-American community are
speaking out about AIDS, and this week a powerful voice turned up
the volume. Addressing students at Atlanta University, Coretta
Scott King urged young people to recognize and defeat the deadly
killer in their midst.
</P>
<P>
   Rising AIDS rates among blacks will not reverse unless other
influential African-Americans join King in speaking openly and
urgently. AIDS death rates are almost 10 times higher among blacks
than whites, although blacks represent only 13 percent of the
American population.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, many churches and civil rights groups remain silent. Their
reticence has been devastating. Young African-Americans are now the
population at greatest risk for infection with HIV. AIDS is the No.
1 cause of death for black males between 25 and 44 and the second
leading cause of death for women in that age group.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think anyone who cares about the future of black America had
better be speaking out about AIDS, calling for preventive measures,
increased funding for research and treatment,'' said King, widow of
Martin Luther King Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Already battling against racism, some black leaders complain
there's not enough energy to add AIDS to their political agenda.
That excuse can no longer be accepted. Too many young men and women
are dying of a preventable disease because of homophobia, ignorance
and embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   The stigma against homosexuality in the African-American
community has led to higher rates of bisexuality, researchers
believe. That, in turn, raises infections among women. The stigma
also stymies education efforts and stops people from being tested
for the virus.
</P>
<P>
   Because many blacks living with HIV hide the truth, the
community has been able to deceive itself that AIDS wears a
different face, that it is somebody else's burden. Black families
sometimes disguise an AIDS death as cancer or pneumonia.
</P>
<P>
   At the Atlanta University forum, Atlanta activist Denise Stokes
rebuked that myth. Raped at age 13, Stokes has been HIV-positive
for 17 years. Stokes told the spellbound college students that,
``AIDS looks like me, 5'-9'', chocolate brown and healthy
looking.''
</P>
<P>
   Her willingness to give a human face to AIDS will help save
lives. But the message of Stokes and King must be echoed by
preachers in their pulpits, civil rights leaders at their news
conferences and parents in their homes.

 &HT;    Department of Education out of our misery
 &HT;    By Jim Wooten
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Without any essential role in education, the U.S.
Department of Education has developed a fitting use: as a dumping
ground for in-laws, outlaws and other Clinton administration
loyalists in need of steady work _ or at least a steady paycheck.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the hiring of political appointees and consultants
outside normal civil service channels is nothing new in
Washington,'' writes Judy Pasternak in a report for The Los Angeles
Times, ``the patronage system is more pervasive at Education than
at any other federal agency.'' One in every 29 workers is a
political appointee, a Democratic loyalist in need of a job, she
reports. For Cabinet departments, the average is one in 807.
</P>
<P>
   They include the president's goddaughter, the transportation
secretary's sister-in-law and a slew of Clinton-Gore campaign
workers. Defeated U.S. Sen. Carol Moseley-Braun, now looking for a
better job as U.S. ambassador to New Zealand, became a
$453.84-per-day consultant after being ousted by Illinois voters.
</P>
<P>
   She was hired to provide political advice on school construction
issues, though state and local governments, and not the U.S.
Department of Education, build schools. Although Clinton has sought
to inject the federal government into local school construction,
the department has no money or authority to go there.
</P>
<P>
   But no money, no matter. Another political appointee, former
White House domestic policy Chief Carol H. Rasco, is paid $125,900
to run America Reads. But Congress has provided no funding for the
program, so she essentially makes speeches advising parents to read
to their children.
</P>
<P>
   The list goes on. The U.S. Department of Education is a place to
stockpile politicos and to farm out friends without disrupting
anything truly important.
</P>
<P>
   Though bloated with patronage appointments and without any
essential role in education _ a state and local responsibility _
the Department of Education, like the season's mutating flu virus,
simply refuses to go away. Five years ago, conservatives were
promising to eliminate it and to bundle up its appropriations and
dispatch them to the states. Fat chance.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Congress is even outdoing the Clinton administration
in swamping the department in new money. The Senate Appropriations
Committee would outspend the president by $500 million on
education. Discretionary funding would be increased from $23
billion to $33.5 billion, a 46 percent increase. Both Democrat Al
Gore and Republican George W. Bush promise to expand spending even
more.
</P>
<P>
   A major difference exists, however, in Clinton's approach and
the Republicans'. Clinton wants to expand the federal role in local
schools. To make the intervention palatable and even desirable to
local communities, it's being marketed as ``100,000 new teachers''
to ``shrink'' classroom size.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are willing to expand federal spending, same as
Clinton and more, but they want the money to go as block grants,
with local officials given spending discretion.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is insisting he will veto the appropriations bill, and
even hinting of government shutdowns, unless he gets the new
federal spending programs. Clinton and congressional leaders are
negotiating now.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome will be revealing. Conservatives should, of course,
resist all efforts to expand the reach of the U.S. Department of
Education. Priority One is to eliminate it. Until that's possible,
it should be shrunk. If that's not possible, it should be
contained. If that's not possible, it should be expanded, but the
money should be given as block grants to be spent as local school
boards choose. If that's not possible, it should be expanded only
marginally. And next year revert to Priority One.
</P>
<P>
   Elimination of the U.S. Department of Education should be a
permanent priority. Every course conservatives choose every day
should be a step in that direction.

INDONESIA'S NEW PRESIDENT CAN BE A MYSTERY, EVEN TO HIS FRIENDS 
</HEADLINE>
 (With INDONESIA-POLITICS) 
(nk) 
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ The revealing title of a biography of
Indonesia's new president, published just last week, is ``Gus Dur:
Who Are You?''
</P>
<P>
   It is a question many people, using his common nickname, ask
about President Abdurrahman Wahid. Indeed, the better people know
him the more often they ask it.
</P>
<P>
   His shifting pronouncements, alliances and public stands have
led to a common joke in Indonesia that there are three things you
can never be certain about: life, death and Gus Dur.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid, 59, a moderate Muslim leader who is one of the nation's
most prominent public figures, decided to become a presidential
candidate only this month, breaking a political partnership with
the woman he eventually defeated, Megawati Sukarnoputri.
</P>
<P>
   Almost everyone here dismissed his candidacy as unrealistic,
vain and even, literally, crazy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gus Dur is strange, strange,'' a former Cabinet minister who
knows him well, Sarwono Kusumaatmadja, said at the time. ``In no
way should he stand as a candidate. He is in ill health. He
suffered a major stroke one and a half years ago. It has impaired
his judgment and he is showing that.''
</P>
<P>
   Wahid has suffered two strokes in recent years. He is also
nearly blind, guided everywhere he goes, even around his own home,
by an aide and accustomed to delivering his speeches without notes.
He traveled this fall to Salt Lake City for laser surgery, which he
said restored some black-and-white vision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything has been examined,'' he assured a local magazine
after declaring his candidacy. ``Stomach, kidney, blood, mental and
memory assessment. Everything is good, excellent.''
</P>
<P>
   His health aside, Wahid is revered by millions of Indonesians as
a brilliant and cultured man and the apostle of a tolerant and
inclusive brand of Islam that many people say embodies the best in
Indonesian society.
</P>
<P>
   As the leader of the nation's largest social group, a Muslim
organization called Nahdlatul Ulama, he has championed the rights
of minorities, of non-Muslims and particularly of the often-abused
community of ethnic Chinese. His organization claims a membership
of more than 30 million people.
</P>
<P>
   In his nickname, Gus is a Muslim honorific and Dur is an
affectionate use of the second syllable of his name.
</P>
<P>
   Though Indonesia _ the world's most-populous Muslim nation with
more than 200 million people _ practices a more moderate style of
Islam than is characteristic in the Middle East, Wahid has been
criticized by some clerics here for his ecumenism.
</P>
<P>
   He responds: ``Those who say that I am not Islamic enough should
reread their Koran. Islam is about inclusion, tolerance,
community.''
</P>
<P>
   His first gesture after his election Wednesday was
characteristic. Still sitting among the delegates to the national
assembly, he took the hand of Mrs. Megawati and continued holding
it as he joined in the singing of the national anthem and she
struggled to hold back tears. Then he raised her hand in a shared
salute of reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   There have been other gestures in the past. When other Muslim
leaders here joined in the condemnation of the British author
Salman Rushdie, Wahid stood alone in his defense. When others
condemned Israel, he visited Jerusalem to accept a prize in honor
of the assassinated leader Shimon Peres.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid received his Islamic education in Egypt and Iraq and he is
noted as a religious scholar. But his interests also range from the
arts (he was a member of a Jakarta arts council) to soccer (he once
wrote about the sport for the magazine Tempo). He is a lover of
Beethoven and Mozart.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   He is also known for his love of pranks. He recently placed his
traditional Indonesian cap atop a bust of Beethoven and posed for a
photographer side by side with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He jokes a lot, almost continuously,'' said a leading editor,
Goenawan Mohamad. ``Gus Dur loves joking _ of course at the expense
of others.''
</P>
<P>
   In one joke recounted by a friend, Wahid said Christians are
closer to God than Muslims because they whisper when they pray,
whereas Muslims have to chant their prayers through loudspeakers.
</P>
<P>
   While he is admired for his culture, he is also revered among
Indonesia's uneducated masses for more exotic qualities: He is
believed to have supernatural powers.
</P>
<P>
   After his election Wednesday, a radio host joked about his
blindness, saying that since a sniper uses just one eye, Wahid
would probably make a fine sniper.
</P>
<P>
   Hearing the joke, a taxi driver was aghast. ``He'd better be
careful what he says,'' the driver said of the radio host. ``Gus
Dur has a sixth sense and can send you bad luck.''
</P>
<P>
   Trusting in his special powers, people sometimes come to him for
guidance, an Indonesian journalist said. Sometimes they drink from
his unfinished glasses of water hoping to imbibe his spirit.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The new president's demeanor and his changeability lead to a
good deal of confusion about him. Is he smart or foolish?
</P>
<P>
   Wahid seems to relish the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good that everyone is now confused, with three
presidential candidates,'' he said as he challenged Mrs. Megawati
and the incumbent president, B.J. Habibie. ``So we will build a new
democracy based on the confusion of the assembly members.''
</P>
<P>
   A leading political scientist, Arief Budiman, worried Wednesday
that Wahid had been seriously damaged by his strokes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new Gus Dur is different from the old Gus Dur,'' he said.
``We can hope for the old Gus Dur. But what we can expect now is a
combination of the two. Sometimes he may be confused in his
actions, and that will have to be compensated for by his
advisers.''
</P>
<P>
   For Goenawan, the editor, there is no question about Wahid's
sharpness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, he is very clever,'' Goenawan said. ``But whether you can
trust him is another matter. He is too clever to be consistent.
That will make it very difficult for people to be comfortable with
his political positions.''

<P>
   For years, when Orpheus Hanley, a composer and computer-game
sound designer in San Diego, sat down to play a computer game, he
often felt a gnawing sense of estrangement from the action. Part of
the problem, he recently explained, was that as an
African-American, he seldom found characters within the game that
looked or behaved anything like him.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the '80s and '90s you never saw black characters,'' Hanley
said. ``If there were black ones, they would get beat up, really
whumped so fast, before they had time to get into character.''
</P>
<P>
   That may now be changing. As a result of a series of rapid
developments, both technological and sociological, blacks and
members of other minorities are being represented in more and more
computer games as fully realized characters.
</P>
<P>
   More often than ever before, the resourceful, square-jawed white
guys with tousled hair are less certain to dominate center stage in
popular games. In a broad range of new releases like Wu-Tang Clan's
Shaolin Style, Urban Chaos, Shadow Man and Ready 2 Rumble Boxing,
nonwhite characters are stars rather than bit players.
</P>
<P>
   Leah Guckenberg, 14, a video game veteran from Palm Springs,
Calif., applauds these new characters. ``I think that it's
awesome,'' she said as she wandered around a video game arcade in
New York last week. ``It shows that we don't care about race or
sex.''
</P>
<P>
   But while they are fighting to save virtual worlds, boldly drawn
computer game characters of identifiable races are also raising
sticky issues in the real world about the nature of racial
identity. What sets some of these characters apart from those of
previous video games is that their creators have tried to imbue
them with ``convincing,'' racially identifiable movements,
personalities and vocal qualities.
</P>
<P>
   Black running backs in Sega Dreamcast's new NFL2K, for example,
are more likely to prance and dance in the end zone than their
white computerized counterparts. In the boxing game Ready 2 Rumble,
Afro Thunder, one of more than a dozen boxers drawn in often crude
racial and ethnic stereotypes, enters the ring with a James
Brown-like scream before announcing, ``It's time to dance; it's
time to dance, dance, sucker.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's funny,'' said a player outside a New York
video arcade who would identify himself only as a Puerto Rican who
lives in the Bronx. ``They just look like another group of silly
stereotypes to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Adam Clayton Powell III, vice president for technology and
programs of the Freedom Forum, an advocacy group for journalists
and journalism education, said he was concerned about the threat of
furthering racial stereotyping in computer games, which he called
``high-tech blackface.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Because the players become involved in the action of the
character far more than sitting back and watching a character on
television,'' Powell said, ``they become much more aware of the
moves that are programmed into the game. Any game has a certain
stereotype, negative or positive, but a computer game is going to
pass that message along pretty powerfully.''
</P>
<P>
   Computer games, at least the ones that have included characters,
have always relied on stereotypes. As computing power increased and
the figures became more fleshed out, that polygon-created flesh was
mostly likely white.
</P>
<P>
   The result was a kind of racial stereotyping in which white men
were all muscle-bound, violence-prone, silent types who mostly
negotiated obstacles with grenades and machine guns. White women
were given the impossible physical characteristics of Lara Croft.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent years, the personal computer itself (and
television-based game consoles like Dreamcast) became muscle-bound,
packing microprocessors two or three times as powerful as high-end
models only a couple of years older. Consequently, some of the best
game play looks much more cinematic than cartoonish. Gone are the
days of simply darkening the skin color and calling a character
black or Indian, many game designers say.
</P>
<P>
   In Shadow Man, a computer game from Acclaim, the character
through which the game is played is a black cabdriver who has been
turned into a ``supreme zombie-warrior slave.'' To give Shadow
Man's voice a certain authenticity, an African-American was
selected to do the voice work.
</P>
<P>
   To give Shadow Man his catlike stroll, a black boxer's athletic
stride was digitally captured and infused into the computer
character, said Guy Miller, who designed the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to make sure that the motion capture and the voice
were black,'' Miller, who is white, said in a telephone interview
from his office in Teesside, England. ``We knew we had to get it
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Urban Chaos, a new computer game by Eidos Interactive, features
a rookie police officer named D'Arci Stern, a black woman born in
Chicago. In the game, Ms. Stern wears neck-length dreadlocks with a
strand of colored beads that dangles over the left side of her
honey-hued face.
</P>
<P>
   She is depicted with well-developed arms and thighs more
reminiscent of Gail Devers charging the finish line than Wonder
Woman leaping across the pages of a comic book.
</P>
<P>
   There are, of course, commercial considerations for the game
industry as it tries to broaden its audience. Several analysts said
that the mix of black and white characters amounted to nothing more
than a marketing strategy that had already proved successful in
movies and television.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a general trend for game designers to try to appeal to
the greatest number of potential players,'' said Jeremy Schwartz, a
senior analyst at Forrester Research. ``Look at television and
advertising. You've typically got a range of racial types.''
</P>
<P>
   Game makers like Emmanuel Valdez, who is Filipino, say a game
with a nonwhite focus is a means of making the game stand out in an
oversaturated marketplace that is swarmed by almost 2,000 new games
a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people are a little tired of the Aryan, square-jawed,
blond hero,'' said Valdez, a computer game artist for Midway, the
company that makes Ready 2 Rumble.
</P>
<P>
   Valdez used Hanley as the model for Afro Thunder _ a
spindly-legged, gigantic-Afro-wearing trash talker, whom Valdez
said was the game's most recognized character. Hanley also lent his
voice to the character.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Afro Thunder, the game features a Croatian brute named
Boris (The Bear) Knokimov, a Hawaiian
Sumo-wrestler-turned-overweight-heavyweight boxer called Salua Tua
and a wild-eyed, wilder-haired Mexican boxer named Angel (Raging)
Rivera.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the characters were based on real people in or around
the company, Valdez said. A curvy Brazilian character is based on
Valdez's wife.
</P>
<P>
   But some critics contend that these characters are destructive.
``The downside is that all of this can create differences that
don't need to be there,'' said Lalit Jain, president of Unified
Access Communications, an Internet security and network company in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Born in northern India, Jain said he shuddered to imagine how an
Indian man would be depicted in a game like Ready 2 Rumble. ``Yoga
man,'' he joked. ``He's scrawny and flexible.''
</P>
<P>
   But Adrian Smith, the British game designer and operations
director of Core Design _ the company created Lara Croft, star of
the $17 million Tomb Raider game franchise _ said designing
nonwhite game characters had little or nothing to do with racial
politics or political correctness. Sometimes, he said, the
development of a character required nontraditional approaches.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was developing a computer game that featured a
character called Roach who must quickly convey a particular blend
of wit, strength and bite. ``We hadn't made a conscious decision _
I never even thought about it,'' Smith, who is white, said about
choosing not to make Roach a white man. ``But he is right for the
character.''
</P>
<P>
   Elijah Anderson, a professor of sociology at the University of
Pennsylvania, said that the racial and ethnic shorthand behind
these nonwhite characters might be intended for white computer game
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Black people have always been the other in this country,''
said Anderson, who is black, adding that black culture was at once
frightening to some whites while also being mysterious and cool.
``A lot of people living in the suburbs admire this fire and this
spunk they see in blacks, a kind of aggressiveness a lot of them
want, too,'' said Anderson, whose new book, ``Code of the Street''
(W.W. Norton), examines the nature and value of urban-hardened
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of these suburban, white-bread kids hunger for this kind
of experience.'' Perhaps, he said, by inhabiting the soul of a
virtual black character in a game, they can safely get a taste of
urban-inspired cool.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said, ``Another part of this is that we all live in a
diverse society now, and these kinds of games play to that
diversity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In a certain sense,'' he added, ``it's a positive.''
</P>
<P>
   Leon Wynter, who is writing a book about social and commercial
depictions of race and ethnicity in the marketplace, notes that the
generations likely to reach for a computer game are far less rigid
in their conceptions of race, ethnicity and sex.
</P>
<P>
   He said young white Americans, especially those under age 30,
were much more accepting of nonwhite heroes, like Kobe Bryant, with
his wins on the basketball court, and Will Smith, with his exploits
saving the world on the movie screen, than previous generations. So
why wouldn't a 15-year-old white boy want to be a black or Hispanic
character in a game?
</P>
<P>
   ``That end of the market,'' Wynter said, ``is very inclined to
see racial distinctions and the connections between the races as
fluid.''

BUSH PRAISES TEXAS CLEANUP PROGRAM, DEFENDS ENVIRONMENTAL RECORD 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JIM HENDERSON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Under fire from environmentalists in recent weeks over
the declining air quality in some parts of Texas, Gov. George W.
Bush stopped by a ceremonial completion of a contamination cleanup
program Wednesday to condemn pollution.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of our prosperity means nothing if we leave future
generations with land that is contaminated,'' he said, standing in
a cavernous former Army Corps of Engineers laboratory that is being
converted into a mission for the homeless.
</P>
<P>
   The new Union Gospel Mission occupies once-contaminated land
that was cleaned up under federal, state and local programs that
target tainted properties and rehabilitate them.
</P>
<P>
   A state law passed in 1995 _ the Texas Voluntary Cleanup Program
_ offers incentives for redevelopment of such land. Future owners,
lenders or lessors, are released from liability for the land's
previous contamination.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years, sites such as this were closed to development
because of wrong management and bad regulations,'' Bush said.
``This program is making them productive again.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the law was passed, Bush said, 400 sites in the state have
been cleaned up and another 500 are in development.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a very successful program,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While a handful of demonstrators across the street held a banner
that said, ``Polluters For Bush _ Thanks Gov,'' Bush defended his
environmental record.
</P>
<P>
   That record has been sharply criticized in recent weeks, largely
because Houston surpassed Los Angeles as the city with America's
dirtiest air and the Dallas-Fort Worth area, under pressure from
the federal government, is considering harsh measures to reduce its
air pollution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Air pollution in Texas has declined 10 percent since '94,''
Bush said. ``Toxic pollution has declined 14 percent since '95. We

SPORTS COLUMN: A SERIES TO REMEMBER 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Cancel the limo. Don't bother upgrading the funds in
your EZ-Pass account. Never mind laying in extra Metrocards.
</P>
<P>
   The Subway Series is not going to happen, and maybe it is just
as well. The grandiosity and braggadocio and civic incivility
emanating from New York would have been too, too much.
</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers would have whipped themselves into a xenophobic
frenzy over a Subway Series, which would have been yet another sign
that New York is the center of the universe. Since everybody
sensible already knows that, who needed rival hordes riding the
Triborough Bridge and the IRT subway to prove the redundancy?
</P>
<P>
   Better to have self-important Yankee fans spewing their verbal
abuse and conformist Atlanta fans Tomahawk-chopping on command,
regional stereotypes coming true. A World Series of cliches. North
vs. South. Big Boss vs. Big Ted. Bluster vs. Bombast. Fine.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, how much can the fragile national ticker stand? The
dysfunctional Mets, a collection of disparate types who became
something akin to a team, thrilled the entire baseball diaspora
with their highs, their lows, their ups, their downs, as Lerner and
Loewe put it. We've grown accustomed to their inconsistencies.
</P>
<P>
   After all the local boosterism anticipating a Subway Series, the
Mets and the Yankees could only have been a hypester's letdown
compared to what transpired on recent nights.
</P>
<P>
   Zombie-like, people shuffled into work the next morning, still
replaying the machinations of the Braves-Mets series. People
bickered at the water cooler, disputing Bobby Valentine's logic on
the double switch in his lineup card or Bobby Cox's implacable
hesitancy to go for the jugular in the rain forest that was Shea
Stadium last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   With Tout New York waiting for the Subway Series, the Braves and
the Mets merely played the most exciting series imaginable,
although it took awhile for the plot to become apparent.
</P>
<P>
   In the first two games, the Braves, built with logic for the
past decade, pushed the Mets onto the tracks in front of an
oncoming Marta train.
</P>
<P>
   (Atlanta has its own little toy subway, by the way, two
bisecting lines with clean cars and quiet wheels and audible
announcements and readable graphics, rather than the Tunnel of
Babel system that is New York.)
</P>
<P>
   After losing the third game in front of their screeching home
folks, the Mets promptly clambered onto the platform. They won on
Saturday night in 10 innings, then Sunday night in 15 innings, with
both teams running out of players.
</P>
<P>
   Glorious personal things kept happening _ unexpected things, by
unexpected people, the way it happens with baseball, with its deep
25-player rosters and timeless games. Bearded John Smoltz, the
Braves' great pitcher, trudged out of the bullpen for the first
time in his career to save a game. A reserve catcher named Eddie
Perez clubbed vital home runs like a latter-day Yogi or Campy or
Bench.
</P>
<P>
   A bumpkin named John Rocker, with hair-trigger linebacker
emotions, dared to criticize the bards of the No. 7 line for their
foul language, if you can imagine. Now eyewitnesses are coming
forth with tales of the righteous Rocker making obscene gestures to
the fans.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets unveiled a player named Melvin Mora who had barely
spent time with the varsity during the season. The Mets were
clearly hiding him, for the value of a shock. By the extra-inning
games, Mora had gained the aura of a modern Mookie, that sweet and
mobile icon of the Mets' 1986 world championship.
</P>
<P>
   Mora ran. Mora caught. Mora threw. Mora hit. One can hardly wait
for spring training for Mora to resume his career. Or perhaps
nothing like this will ever happen to him again in his life, or our
lives. But for those late nights in October of 1999, there was
Melvin Mora.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly 48 hours, the world persuaded itself that there could
never be another game like the 15-inning madness in Flushing. But
there was. On Tuesday night in Atlanta, the Braves went ahead by
scores of 5-0 and 7-3. Then it was the Braves who had to fight
back, not once but twice.
</P>
<P>
   'Round midnight, between Tuesday and Wednesday, the Braves
mounted a rally. It ended with the weakest of series-winning
efforts, a bases-loaded walk.
</P>
<P>
   In New York and other rabid towns, fans toss back balls hit by a
yokel like Chipper (Lar-ree! Lar-ree!) Jones. The Braves did not
decline the gift. They wanted to get their fans back to the 'burbs.
They had to catch the Marta to the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Now the stage belongs to the Braves and the Yankees, but Mets
fans have their memories. In time, people will forget the angst of
the manager who called for his own scalp in the midst of a losing
streak. Fans will remember a pitching staff without an ace that
somehow terrorized the Braves up until 12:38 a.m. on the morning of
Oct. 20. The fans will remember the infield of Olerud and Alfonzo
and Ordonez and Ventura, who scooped up everything, and the big
gentle slugger, Mike Piazza, behind the plate, and mercurial Rickey
and promising Cedeno and Darryl Hamilton who came late with a
twinkle in his eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the third-best team in baseball,'' bragged Todd Pratt,
the useful reserve catcher, in the grieving clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   There is room for only two teams in the World Series. There will
be no transfer at Grand Central Terminal, no tollbooth on the
Triborough.
</P>
<P>
   The World Series between the Braves and the Yanks can never
possibly measure up to the league championship series. We've all
been wrong with those kind of predictions, haven't we? &QL;

CONVICTED VICHY OFFICIAL CHOOSES EXILE OVER PRISON
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ With only hours to go before he was to spend his first
night in jail, Maurice Papon, the 89-year-old career civil servant
convicted last year of complicity in Nazi war crimes, said
Wednesday that he would flee the country rather than surrender.
</P>
<P>
   Papon disappeared from his home near Paris a week ago, just
after a court ruled that he would have to start serving his 10-year
sentence before his appeal could be heard. He made no statement at
the time.
</P>
<P>
   But in a four-paragraph statement issued to newspapers here
Wednesday, Papon made clear that he had no intention of giving
himself up, as the court had ordered.
</P>
<P>
   Calling the latest court ruling only ``the crown'' on a long
list of illegal acts that had marked the investigation and trial
against him, Papon said he would ask the European Court of Human
Rights to condemn France for denying him a fair proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, he said, the only ``honorable course was exile,
as painful as this might be for a man in his 90th year.'' He added
that exile was ``a choice that had been made by some of the most
noted men of history.''
</P>
<P>
   French officials immediately said that they would use all
measures possible to find Papon, who has steadfastly refused to
take any blame for the hundreds of Jews deported from France to
Nazi death camps under his signature as the third-ranking official
of the Vichy government in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maurice Papon will, at the request of the prosecutor, be
pursued, apprehended wherever he is, and taken to the penitentiary
establishment where he will serve his sentence,'' said Daniel
Vaillant, the government's chief spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Lionel Jospin condemned the flight as a cowardly
act and said France would ask for Papon's extradition if it turns
out he is indeed in a foreign country.
</P>
<P>
   Papon's actions shocked many of his victims and their families
and is likely to raise questions about whether Papon still has
friends in high places protecting him. After the war, Papon went on
to serve as Paris' prefect of police and then budget minister. He
regularly met with President Francois Mitterrand.
</P>
<P>
   His statement Wednesday also set off an avalanche of speculation
about where he had gone; his chief lawyer, Jean-Marc Varaut, said
he would not discuss the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those representing the victims and their families blamed
authorities for allowing Papon to remain free without restrictions
after he was convicted. They pointed out that Papon's passport was
never confiscated.
</P>
<P>
   ``They put people in jail for stealing chickens, but this man
who is responsible for the death of hundreds of people just walks
free to go back to living in his chateau,'' said Therese Stopnicki,
whose two sisters were taken away under Papon's orders.
</P>
<P>
   Serge Klarsfeld, who helped collect the evidence against Papon
and whose son Arno represented some of the victims' families during
the trial, also admonished the authorities. ``We always believed he
would do this,'' Klarsfeld said. ``We warned the government and
they did nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking the stand during his trial, Papon argued that he had
actually saved Jews and done favors for the French Resistance. To
hear him tell it, if his Office of Jewish Questions had not existed
the Nazi ravages would have been much worse than they actually
were, with far more than 74,000 of the 330,000 Jews living in
France deported to Auschwitz.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1998, after the longest trial in modern French history,
Papon was convicted of helping to transport Jews to Nazi death
camps and sentenced to 10 years in prison. The court also ordered
Papon to pay $750,000 in damages and legal fees to the victims and
their lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Under French law, he was required to turn himself in for one
night in jail before his appeal hearing, scheduled for Thursday,
could begin. His lawyers said they would now seek a delay in
Papon's appeal proceeding, based on the notion that the case was
being appealed to the European Human Rights Court. No precedent
exists for such a request.

   WASHINGTON _ Jonathan Winters, who came to Washington to receive
the Mark Twain Prize for humor from the Kennedy Center for
Performing Arts on Wednesday night, warmed up for the event in the
afternoon with a discussion in which it was difficult to separate
the serious from his improvisational wit.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a true story,'' he began, an introduction that made
the listener wonder if it really was, and he went on to tell about
a recent trip around the world that found him one day at the Temple
of Athena in Greece.
</P>
<P>
   ``A woman asked what I thought of it,'' he related, ``and I said
that I was terribly disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is broken.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But it goes back five centuries before Christ.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It should have been fixed by now.''
</P>
<P>
   Winters will be 74 years old next month, and he made most of his
movies before actors were able to demand multimillion-dollar fees.
Robin Williams, who came to Washington to participate in the
tribute to Williams, gets $20 million for a movie, Winters said.
</P>
<P>
   So he said he told a studio executive, ``If Robin says I'm his
idol, shouldn't you give me $1 million more than that?''
</P>
<P>
   It did not work, and Winters said that for his movie work, which
includes ``It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World'' and ``The Russians Are
Coming! The Russians Are Coming!'', his biggest pay was $130,000.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Williams, many other comedians came to Washington to pay
homage to Winters and make some people smile.
</P>
<P>
   At a panel discussion at the Kennedy Center on the golden age of
television on Tuesday night, Steve Allen said a lot of humor comes
from the art of exaggeration, and he gave this example from Fred
Allen:
</P>
<P>
   ``This scarecrow was so scary that not only did it scare away
the crows, but they also came back with corn they had stolen two
years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Sid Caesar told two stories about television sponsors in the
1950s, one funny and the other serious.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dinah Shore wanted to book Tennessee Ernie Ford,'' Caesar
said, ``but she was told she couldn't because she was sponsored by
Chevrolet. She solved it by having him on as Tennessee Ernie
Chevrolet.''
</P>
<P>
   Caesar told of his own booking problem: When he tried to
schedule the singer Billy Daniels, who was known for his rendition
of ``That Old Black Magic,'' it was vetoed by the sponsor, Camel
cigarettes, because Daniels was black.
</P>
<P>
   That happened so many years ago that Carole Crosslin, a
spokeswoman for R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., the makers of Camels,
said Wednesday, ``I have no idea whether this ever happened and no
way of finding out.''
</P>
<P>
   Winters is the second recipient of the Mark Twain Prize for
humor. The first prize was awarded last year to Richard Pryor.
</P>
<P>
   The tribute to Winters was taped for broadcast on Jan. 12 on the
Comedy Central network.

RUSSIANS REJECT U.S. PROPOSAL TO RENEGOTIATE ABM TREATY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Alaska, N.D.)  (mk) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Senior Russian officials on Wednesday strongly rejected
an American proposal to renegotiate the 1972 ABM treaty, raising
the stakes for the U.S. debate over antimissile defenses.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is scheduled to make a formal
decision by June on whether to proceed with antimissile defenses
against potential missile attacks by North Korea, Iran and other
Third World nations.
</P>
<P>
   Washington has sought to persuade the Kremlin to amend the
accord and has even offered to help Russia complete a
missile-tracking radar installation near Irkutsk, Siberia.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, Vladimir Rakhmanin, said
Russia was not interested in bargaining over the ABM treaty. ``We
aren't negotiating any kind of amendments to the ABM,'' Rakhmanin
said.
</P>
<P>
   The accord, which has been a cornerstone of arms control for
more than 25 years, sharply restricts the testing and deployment of
antimissile defenses. The Clinton administration is now trying to
amend it so that the United States can build a new ``battle
management'' radar system in Alaska by 2005 and deploy 100
antimissile interceptors there. A second battle-management radar
could be erected in North Dakota and 100 interceptors deployed
there by 2010, under the plan.
</P>
<P>
   The sharp Russian response suggests that Washington may be
confronted with a stark and unpalatable choice: withdrawing from
the treaty in the face of strong opposition from Russia and China.
That would give the United States the opportunity to erect a
defense against possible missile attacks by Third World nations,
but it would also risk a new arms race with Moscow and Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials say the Russians may be posturing in
the hope of undermining public support for antimissile defenses in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But Russian officials said they were simply being blunt and that
Washington had understated the political and military risks of its
plan to the public and U.S. allies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There can be no compromise on this issue,'' the first deputy
chief of the Russian general staff, Col. Gen. Valery Manilov, told
reporters Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Washington insists that its plan would pose little threat to the
Russians, because they could easily overwhelm the defenses with
their sizable missile force.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright says the Clinton
administration is seeking nothing more than slight adjustments to
the accord that should not concern the Russians. Not all of the
United States' allies accept this argument. The French government,
in particular, is extremely critical.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officals, for their part, argue that what the Clinton
administration calls minor modifications amount to a wholesale
reversal of the treaty's central prohibition against the
establishment of a nationwide defense.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians also say that radars, command and control systems,
and satellites deployed under the American plan could serve as
building blocks for a more comprehensive missile defense.
</P>
<P>
   Stepping up the political pressure on Washington, the Russian
military warned Wednesday that it would consider an American
decision to withdraw from the accord as freeing Moscow from its
arms control obligations under several strategic arms accords.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians noted that they ratified START I, the treaty that
reduces long-range nuclear arms, on the assumption that the ABM
treaty would remain intact. The Russians have yet to ratify START
II, which makes deeper cuts, but say that it, too, would be
jeopardized by a U.S. decision to withdraw from the ABM treaty.
</P>
<P>
   ``An attempt to withdraw from the 1972 ABM treaty would destroy
the entire system of treaties dealing with the restriction and
reduction of weapons of mass destruction,'' Manilov said. ``All
these agreements can be implemented only as a single whole.''
</P>
<P>
   The Russian military also said it has developed plans to augment
its nuclear force if Washington withdraws from the treaty. They
include the deployment of new, multiple-warhead missiles and mobile
land-based missiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia can take about 20 steps without a substantial increase
in costs,'' said Col. Gen. Vladimir Yakovlev, the commander of
Russia's strategic forces. ``The history of weaponry suggests that
the shield is always weaker than the sword.''

UNESCO CHOOSES MATSUURA OF JAPAN AS   NEW DIRECTOR GENERAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By ALAN RIDING    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ The Unesco executive board Wednesday chose Japan's
ambassador to France, Koichiro Matsuura, as director general of the
organization. Matsuura's nomination for a six-year term is expected
to be confirmed by the 186-nation general conference of Unesco when
it meets here on Nov. 12.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese diplomat had long been considered a strong
contender, because Japan is the largest contributor to the $544
million biannual budget of the U.N. Educational, Scientific and
Cultural Organization. He also benefited from intense lobbying by
his government, which has in recent years been seeking a higher
profile in international organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Matsuura, 62, the front-runner in the first two ballots
conducted by the 58-nation executive board this week, won a
majority, with 34 votes. Ghazi Algosaibi, Saudi Arabia's ambassador
to London, was second, with 13. This election was the most open to
date. But the outcome was no less conventional than in previous
years.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, the Unesco headquarters here has been buzzing
with rumors that the Japanese and Saudi governments had promised
generous aid packages to several third world countries in exchange
for their votes. Japanese and Saudi diplomats strongly denied
engaging in so-called checkbook diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   The election has nonetheless brought to the surface widespread
unhappiness with the way Unesco and its 2,326-member staff have
been run by its current director general, Federico Mayor Zaragoza
of Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor promised sweeping change in 1987, when he succeeded Amadou
Mahtar M'Bow of Senegal, whose left-leaning scandal-ridden tenure
prompted a walkout in 1985 by the United States and Britain. But in
recent years, Mayor has come under increasing criticism. An
external audit requested by Canada last year said that Unesco was
wracked by inefficiency and nepotism.
</P>
<P>
   Although candidates to succeed Mayor did not directly attack his
administration, some made it clear that they believed that Unesco
needed a thorough shake-up. Matsuura, though, was decidedly more
cautious, noting in a campaign statement that ``I hope to make it a
more dynamic, efficient and harmonious organization'' and to win
recognition of Unesco's ``usefulness and dynamic potential.''
</P>
<P>
   In an apparent reference to the United States, where he studied
economics at Haverford College in Pennsylvania in the late 1950s,
Matsuura also said he would extend an invitation to nonmember
states to join. Although Britain returned after Prime Minister Tony
Blair's Labor government took office in 1997, congressional
hostility toward Unesco still appears to stand in the way of the
United States' rejoining in the near future.

INDONESIA'S NEW PRESIDENT CAN BE A MYSTERY, EVEN TO HIS FRIENDS 
</HEADLINE>
 
(Eds: SUBS 15th graf, There have ..., to CORRECT, assassinated
Israeli leader was Yitzhak Rabin, sted Shimon Peres.) (With INDONESIA-POLITICS) 
(nk) 
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ The revealing title of a biography of
Indonesia's new president, published just last week, is ``Gus Dur:
Who Are You?''
</P>
<P>
   It is a question many people, using his common nickname, ask
about President Abdurrahman Wahid. Indeed, the better people know
him the more often they ask it.
</P>
<P>
   His shifting pronouncements, alliances and public stands have
led to a common joke in Indonesia that there are three things you
can never be certain about: life, death and Gus Dur.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid, 59, a moderate Muslim leader who is one of the nation's
most prominent public figures, decided to become a presidential
candidate only this month, breaking a political partnership with
the woman he eventually defeated, Megawati Sukarnoputri.
</P>
<P>
   Almost everyone here dismissed his candidacy as unrealistic,
vain and even, literally, crazy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gus Dur is strange, strange,'' a former Cabinet minister who
knows him well, Sarwono Kusumaatmadja, said at the time. ``In no
way should he stand as a candidate. He is in ill health. He
suffered a major stroke one and a half years ago. It has impaired
his judgment and he is showing that.''
</P>
<P>
   Wahid has suffered two strokes in recent years. He is also
nearly blind, guided everywhere he goes, even around his own home,
by an aide and accustomed to delivering his speeches without notes.
He traveled this fall to Salt Lake City for laser surgery, which he
said restored some black-and-white vision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything has been examined,'' he assured a local magazine
after declaring his candidacy. ``Stomach, kidney, blood, mental and
memory assessment. Everything is good, excellent.''
</P>
<P>
   His health aside, Wahid is revered by millions of Indonesians as
a brilliant and cultured man and the apostle of a tolerant and
inclusive brand of Islam that many people say embodies the best in
Indonesian society.
</P>
<P>
   As the leader of the nation's largest social group, a Muslim
organization called Nahdlatul Ulama, he has championed the rights
of minorities, of non-Muslims and particularly of the often-abused
community of ethnic Chinese. His organization claims a membership
of more than 30 million people.
</P>
<P>
   In his nickname, Gus is a Muslim honorific and Dur is an
affectionate use of the second syllable of his name.
</P>
<P>
   Though Indonesia _ the world's most-populous Muslim nation with
more than 200 million people _ practices a more moderate style of
Islam than is characteristic in the Middle East, Wahid has been
criticized by some clerics here for his ecumenism.
</P>
<P>
   He responds: ``Those who say that I am not Islamic enough should
reread their Koran. Islam is about inclusion, tolerance,
community.''
</P>
<P>
   His first gesture after his election Wednesday was
characteristic. Still sitting among the delegates to the national
assembly, he took the hand of Mrs. Megawati and continued holding
it as he joined in the singing of the national anthem and she
struggled to hold back tears. Then he raised her hand in a shared
salute of reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   There have been other gestures in the past. When other Muslim
leaders here joined in the condemnation of the British author
Salman Rushdie, Wahid stood alone in his defense. When others
condemned Israel, he visited Jerusalem to accept a prize in honor
of the assassinated leader Yitzhak Rabin.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid received his Islamic education in Egypt and Iraq and he is
noted as a religious scholar. But his interests also range from the
arts (he was a member of a Jakarta arts council) to soccer (he once
wrote about the sport for the magazine Tempo). He is a lover of
Beethoven and Mozart.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   He is also known for his love of pranks. He recently placed his
traditional Indonesian cap atop a bust of Beethoven and posed for a
photographer side by side with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He jokes a lot, almost continuously,'' said a leading editor,
Goenawan Mohamad. ``Gus Dur loves joking _ of course at the expense
of others.''
</P>
<P>
   In one joke recounted by a friend, Wahid said Christians are
closer to God than Muslims because they whisper when they pray,
whereas Muslims have to chant their prayers through loudspeakers.
</P>
<P>
   While he is admired for his culture, he is also revered among
Indonesia's uneducated masses for more exotic qualities: He is
believed to have supernatural powers.
</P>
<P>
   After his election Wednesday, a radio host joked about his
blindness, saying that since a sniper uses just one eye, Wahid
would probably make a fine sniper.
</P>
<P>
   Hearing the joke, a taxi driver was aghast. ``He'd better be
careful what he says,'' the driver said of the radio host. ``Gus
Dur has a sixth sense and can send you bad luck.''
</P>
<P>
   Trusting in his special powers, people sometimes come to him for
guidance, an Indonesian journalist said. Sometimes they drink from
his unfinished glasses of water hoping to imbibe his spirit.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The new president's demeanor and his changeability lead to a
good deal of confusion about him. Is he smart or foolish?
</P>
<P>
   Wahid seems to relish the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good that everyone is now confused, with three
presidential candidates,'' he said as he challenged Mrs. Megawati
and the incumbent president, B.J. Habibie. ``So we will build a new
democracy based on the confusion of the assembly members.''
</P>
<P>
   A leading political scientist, Arief Budiman, worried Wednesday
that Wahid had been seriously damaged by his strokes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new Gus Dur is different from the old Gus Dur,'' he said.
``We can hope for the old Gus Dur. But what we can expect now is a
combination of the two. Sometimes he may be confused in his
actions, and that will have to be compensated for by his
advisers.''
</P>
<P>
   For Goenawan, the editor, there is no question about Wahid's
sharpness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, he is very clever,'' Goenawan said. ``But whether you can
trust him is another matter. He is too clever to be consistent.
That will make it very difficult for people to be comfortable with
his political positions.''

SAILING THE BLUE HIGHWAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., Oct. 24) 
(jt) 
 By JERI CLAUSING    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the first things I noticed when we arrived for our
much-anticipated week at Aruba's famous windsurfing village last
December was the so-called Blue Highway, a streak of light blue
water about a quarter-mile offshore where masters of the sport zip
back and forth at speeds as high as 40 mph.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The sea was flat and clear. That, combined with steady trade
winds and sunny skies, made it immediately apparent why Aruba has
become one of the favorite destinations of windsurfers from all
over the world, and the location for the sport's premier high-speed
sailing contest, the Aruba Hi Winds Competition, in June. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, as we prepared for our first windsurfing
venture, the young Dutchman who was helping out for the high season
at our guesthouse, Roger's Windsurf Place, showed us a map of the
beach and the shallow reefs to avoid. Out where the reef ends was
the Blue Highway, clearly marked, for experts only. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Experts only? I want to be sailing that before we leave,'' I
said with a cocky smile, half joking. Nonetheless, I was confident
that I had mastered the basics of the sport during my first
windsurfing vacation in the Outer Banks of North Carolina a few
months before. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If only I had known how quickly that wish would come true. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Blessed, or perhaps cursed, with the first strong winds of the
season, Roger (pronounced roh-ZHAY) Jurriens, the owner of Roger's
Windsurf Place, set my husband, Roberto, and me up on beginner
boards and sails, reminding us that we could swap equipment any
time if they weren't fast enough. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The offshore winds were gusting over 20 knots as we headed out.
Roger reminded us to sail close in, parallel to shore (and to the
Blue Highway) so as not to get blown out too far, where the winds
are even stronger. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sailing any direction would have been just fine with me. Just
when I'd get my balance and start moving, a gust would catch me off
guard and I'd plunge back into the water. After an hour or so of
struggling, I was getting a little more comfortable with the wind
and caught a few decent runs. But I was still falling a lot, and
getting exhausted hoisting the heavy sail back up each time. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Be patient, I told myself, unaware of how far out I was drifting
every time I had to pull myself and my sail out of the water and
get back into the proper beginner position. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I got up and caught a good, fast ride, but I kept getting pushed
out. For some reason, my basics in steering didn't seem to be
working. Then I caught a big gust and went flying forward. My knee
crashed into the board. Frustrated, in pain, and too far from
anyone else to worry about my composure, I clung to the board and
cried. After the initial pain and panic began to subside, I decided
to try swimming the board back closer to shore. I'm a strong
swimmer, but trying to swim a sailboard into the wind is like
trying to swim against a current. It didn't take long to realize
that wasn't going to work. And every time I kicked, my knee felt
odd, as if it were popping. I started looking around for the boats
that the windsurfing rental places keep on alert, ready to drag in
novices like me. Just my luck the boat was beached. I took a deep
breath and tried again. Another big gust toppled me. So I finally
gave up and sat down on the board. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, as another sailor zipped by, I realized where I was.
Yes, out in the expert-only area, stranded on the Blue Highway.
Panic set in. But I tried to hide it. Finally, at the sailor's
urging, I swallowed my pride, put my arms over my head and began
waving for a rescue. Not exactly the way I'd planned to make my
debut on the Aruba windsurfing scene. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Back at shore courtesy of the rescue boat, I sheepishly dragged
myself out of the water just as Roberto _ who, unaware of my
misadventure, had been off sailing on his own _ was coming in. He
had managed to make it back, but he was equally frustrated. Roger
promised a lesson the next day to get us on track. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Despite our frustration, we were pleased with Aruba and our
accommodations. Roberto likes to vacation in remote places, so I
had booked the seven-day trip at Roger's guesthouse _ all equipment
included _ as a holiday surprise. Then I kept hearing about how
developed the island had become. That made me nervous. It's true
that downtown Oranjestad and the hotel strip that extends north
almost to the island's main windsurfing area in Malmok are quite
built up, with shops and casinos catering not only to resort guests
but also to the heavy cruise ship traffic. But the development has
been tastefully done in the tradition of Aruba's Dutch Colonial
heritage, and the island is very clean. We saw no poverty anywhere
on the island. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Aruba is flat and arid, its plant life an odd mix of tropical
growth and cactus. In the northwest and parts of the interior, it
almost looks as if a chunk of Arizona had been plopped into the
Caribbean. The beaches vary. Along the northern shore, there are
mostly rocky cliffs overlooking very rough surf. The windsurf area
and the hotels are on the western side, which boasts pristine
white, sandy beaches.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's a small island, just 20 miles long and 6 miles across at
its widest point. Oranjestad is the capital and tourism center.
Sint Nicolaas, to the southeast, is the industrial area, with an
oil refinery. To the north are various attractions including a
natural bridge that was formed by the rough Atlantic surf. On the
southwestern side is Savaneta, the oldest town in Aruba, the former
capital and now a fishing village. It is here that the Dutch first
settled after re-establishing control of the island in 1816. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The windsurf strip was just far enough away from the bustle of
Oranjestad to satisfy my taste. Nestled in an oceanfront
neighborhood that is more like a suburb than a resort area, Roger's
guesthouse is actually a three-room extension of the house where he
grew up and where his parents still live. The rooms, simply
furnished, with private baths and cable television, are spotless
and share a courtyard and kitchen. Each room has a deck, where you
can watch the windsurfers, read, have a beer with other guests or
feed the resident geckos.
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere was quiet, relaxed and friendly. We made friends,
swapping windsurfing stories and sometimes exploring restaurants
together or trying our hand at blackjack in one of the island's 11
casinos. The casinos are simpler and for the most part smaller than
those in Las Vegas or Atlantic City, and never seemed crowded. Most
of the bettors are tourists, as the government restricts how often
residents can gamble.
</P>
<P>
   Getting around the island is quite easy. If you're content to
stay around the hotel and downtown areas, there is no need to rent
a car. Buses run regularly from near the windsurf area, through the
hotel strips and into town. But we enjoyed having a car, which we
rented for about $20 a day, because we could look for more
traditional restaurants and explore the island. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The biggest disappointment was the lack of unique restaurants.
There is no real Aruban food. The island is a Dutch territory with
a heavy Dutch influence. The food is a lot like the language,
Papiamento, a creolized Spanish with admixtures of Dutch and
Portuguese. With a little searching, we did find a few good
restaurants such as Gasparito, offering seafood and pork and
chicken dishes with an island flair. But the restaurants in town
were mostly mediocre, serving food much like that you could find in
chain restaurants in any United States city.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the real mission of the trip was to windsurf, not sightsee
or gamble. We soon discovered it was going to take a lot more than
a week to master anything beyond the very basics. And I was already
limping from what I later found out was torn knee cartilage from my
first-day fall.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We had already signed up for a lesson, so I hobbled across the
courtyard to the windsurf shop and listened to Roger review the
basics for us. My problem, and one of the big problems with the
sport, became immediately clear: different instructors teach very
different basics. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So I went to the beach and watched Roberto windsurf. He seemed
to be doing better with Roger's techniques. Later we took the
afternoon off to explore the the natural bridge, a place where the
ocean has carved out an overpass in the rocks on the Western
shore. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The next day, braced with Advil, I decided to get back onto the
board. But first we had another lesson. This time Roger was showing
us how to use a harness to hook ourselves to the sail. Although it
makes it easier to sail fast without so much strain on your arms,
there is a steep learning curve, he warned. You will take a lot of
spills into the sail before you learn how to unhook the harness
when falling. I decided to stick to the basics and not push
myself. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That turned out to be a wise choice. Roberto went out and almost
immediately fell into the mast, bruising his ribs. The next trip to
town was in search of a jumbo bottle of Advil.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We were certainly learning that this sport was much more painful
and difficult than we had anticipated. But Roger's is not overrun
with scheduled lessons from outside guests, so staying there was
really like having a private instructor. And one of the best things
about Aruba is that from December through June you are almost
guaranteed rain-free windy days. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Despite our injuries, we pushed ourselves to sail better each
day. And Roger was a good and patient teacher. His credentials were
impressive: he represented Aruba at the Olympic windsurfing
competition in Barcelona in 1992. Still, every time we tried to go
up a notch, it felt like starting over. ``No pain, no gain,'' our
fellow, more experienced windsurfers didn't fail to remind us with
a smile. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As our stay was ending, we were still frustrated. After a little
discussion, we signed on for three more days. On our last day we
were still in pain but felt we had managed to improve. We made
ambitious plans for more sailing in the United States. As we said
goodbye, I vowed, ``Next time you see me, I'll be sailing the Blue
Highway.''
</P>
<P>
   If you go:
</P>
<P>
   ROGER'S WINDSURF PLACE, 472 L.G. Smith Boulevard, Malmok, Aruba,
(297) 861-918, offers convenient packages that include unlimited
use of equipment that is stored right across the street from the
beach. Gear can be tied out in the water for easy breaks, or easily
swapped throughout the day if you want try different sizes of
boards or sails. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For $700 a week each, not including air fare, we had a room at
Roger's guesthouse. For about $100 more, you can rent an apartment
in a small building with a pool. The rates, which start at $600 a
week, go up slightly from late December through June, and drop from
July through December. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Private lessons with Roger cost $75 an hour. Or you can buy
three hours of private lessons for $200. When you're a guest, he is
quite flexible about breaking up the time over different days to
suit your needs. He also offers group lessons, as well as hourly
and daily equipment rentals for people not staying in one of his
rooms or apartments.
</P>
<P>
   Where to Eat
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   GASPARITO, 3 Gasparito, (297) 867-044, is a nice, family-owned
restaurant set in a neighborhood away from the main hotel strip.
The menu offers a mix of authentic Aruban dishes, as well as
internationally inspired entrees, such as barracuda-stuffed
ravioli. I enjoyed the Aruban combo, which included samplings of
seafood and meat dishes cooked Aruban style. None of the dishes
were too hot, but they still had an interesting mix of spices.
Dinner with wine averages $30 a person.
</P>
<P>
   BOONOONOONOOS, 18A Wilhelmina-straat in downtown Oranjestad,
(297) 831-888, bills itself as an Aruba Caribbean Bistroquet. Its
more traditionally Caribbean menu includes Jamaican jerk ribs,
roast chicken Barbados and plantain dishes. Its pumpkin soup was
delicious, as were the Cuban-style garlic shrimp. Dinner with wine,
$30 a person.

   CUCUTA, Colombia _ For Jose Moreno, his family of six and his
neighbors, life as refugees began suddenly in mid-July with the
arrival of a group of armed men at their small village north of
here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to do a cleanup in this area, so it is best you
go away for a time if you don't want to get hurt,'' Moreno
remembers the masked strangers announcing.
</P>
<P>
   Since members of a right-wing paramilitary death squad killed 11
people in a nearby settlement just a few days earlier, the
residents of the Morenos' village, La Pista, took the warning
seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving their animals and belongings behind, they fled across
the border into Venezuela, beginning an odyssey that has brought
them to a makeshift camp in an open-air coliseum here, where they
are officially classified as ``internally displaced people'' and
have little prospect of returning home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to go back to our homes and our yucca and banana
fields, but we are afraid the paras will kill us,'' said Luis
Mariano, another resident of the same remote mountainous area.
``And so here we are, without a peso to our name, without jobs or
hope, depending on the charity of others and sleeping on the ground
and waiting for someone to bring us our next meal.''
</P>
<P>
   As Colombia's longstanding civil conflict intensifies, the
fighting is inflicting a major social crisis on a country that is
already deeply fractured. Hundreds of thousands of civilians are
being forcibly uprooted.
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority are peasants caught in the crossfire between
Marxist guerrillas and the right-wing paramilitary forces that seek
to wipe them out.
</P>
<P>
   Fernando Medellin, director of the Solidarity Network, a
Colombian government agency that deals with the problem, estimates
that fighting has displaced 1.5 million of Colombia's 40 million
people at one time or another since 1985. But half of that has been
since 1996, human rights groups estimate, with the number expected
to swell by at least 300,000 this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even more important than the total is the fact that the
numbers are still increasing, not holding steady or declining,''
Leila Lima, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees' delegate to
Colombia, said in an interview in Bogota.
</P>
<P>
   International relief and aid agencies describe the plight of
Colombia's displaced people as the largest human emergency in the
Western Hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   In numerical terms the problem is greater than in East Timor,
Chechnya or even Kosovo. But in contrast to those places, ``here
the phenomenon is silent and gradual, and so it is invisible in a
certain way,'' Ms. Lima said.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike victims of those other conflicts, displaced people in
Colombia are not readily distinguishable by their ethnicity,
language or religion. Instead, they are ordinary citizens who
happen to stand in the way of the armed groups that have been
warring with increasing ferocity since the 1960s in this Texas-size
South American country.
</P>
<P>
   Nor, for the most part, have Colombia's displaced people been
resettled in large groups, provided for and protected by
international relief organizations or their own government _ which
has only belatedly acknowledged the extent of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   ``For the most part, this is not a country of camps,'' said
Rolin Wavre, chief delegate of the International Committee of the
Red Cross in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   No precise figures exist, but human rights groups estimate that
more than half of the displaced have been uprooted by right-wing
paramilitary groups. The Peasant Self-Defense Union is one that has
been active in this northeastern corner of the country _ an
especially rich prize for the combatants because coca is widely
grown here.
</P>
<P>
   Left-wing guerrilla groups are considered responsible for
forcing out more than a third of those displaced, with the
Colombian armed forces considered responsible for less than 5
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia's crisis is so widespread and deeply rooted that some
people have been displaced more than once. In 1993, for instance,
Roque Murcia, now 54, and his wife, Delia, fled from their farm
near Turbo in the northwest after a heavily armed paramilitary unit
showed up and accused local residents of collaborating with the
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came and said that we had better go away until further
notice, because they didn't want to have to kill us,'' he recalled
during an interview at the coliseum here. ``Since they had already
killed some friends of mine, I did what they said.''
</P>
<P>
   Unable to find anyone to buy his property, Murcia abandoned two
horses, two mules and 185 acres of fertile land planted with corn,
bananas and cocoa, to which he still holds title. After a time in a
camp in his native province, he fled here to the other side of the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Here he eventually found work as a laborer on the farms of
others, scratching out a meager living until the paramilitary
forces showed up once more with the same message.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now here I am living the same tragedy all over again,''
Murcia, whose wife, 53, was recently given a diagnosis of cancer
but has been unable to receive treatment, said morosely. ``I find
myself more desperate than when I was displaced from Turbo.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of the relief effort that the Colombian government has
begun to mount, refugees like Murcia are entitled to a card that
makes them eligible for free health care and other benefits.
</P>
<P>
   But after summary executions of some people carrying the card at
roadblocks by paramilitary or guerrilla units who suspect the
refugees of supporting the enemy, many of the displaced are
reluctant to apply for such status.
</P>
<P>
   Fear has also led many to flee camps or other organized
settlements where they might receive help, creating what one
foreign relief worker calls ``belts of misery'' around large cities
like this one or Medellin or Cali. But even there, they are
regularly hunted down and killed by one side or the other.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``Displaced families don't like to identify themselves as such,
out of fear,'' said a government employee who works with them here.
``They prefer to camouflage themselves among other people, and we
don't like to identify them either, because it stigmatizes them and
exposes them to danger.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM0
</P>
<P>
   One foreign relief worker here said, ``As the saying goes in
Spanish, they are caught between the hammer and the anvil.''

GORE BLASTS BUSH ON ENVIRONMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN CAHER  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Vice President Al Gore on Wednesday sharply
criticized the environmental record of Republican presidential
front-runner George W. Bush and suggested that turning the White
House over to the GOP next year could have a disastrous
repercussions for the Adirondacks and the Hudson River.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview from Washington with reporters
representing eight New York news organizations, Gore said Bush's
environmental policies have resulted in Texas having the most
polluted air, water and land in the nation. He also accused the
Texas governor of fostering an unhealthy relationship between his
state's environmental regulators and polluting industries, and said
Bush ``has carried water for the special interests; he has carried
dirty water for the special interests.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign insisted that the Texas governor is committed
to the environment and has signed legislation to reduce toxic
wastes and other pollutants. Spokesman Scott McClellan said Bush
was ``mystified'' by the vice president's remarks Wednesday and
``like New Yorkers ... (is) interested to know what Mr. Gore has
done to clean up the Hudson River during the last seven years.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who is locked in a tight contest with former New Jersey
Sen. Bill Bradley for the Democratic presidential nomination,
declined to say specifically what he would do to control Midwestern
factory emissions that cause acid rain to fall on the Adirondacks,
or how he would address the problem of PCB, or polychlorinated
biphenyl, contamination of the Hudson River.
</P>
<P>
   However, the vice president, who has a long history of
environmental activism, said his record on the environment stands
in stark contrast to Bush's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that if you look at Governor Bush's record in Texas
you would have to conclude that if ... he had the opportunity to
take the same approach nationally, we would see the same kind of
results,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he was ``committed to a cleanup of the environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Also during the telephone interview, Gore:
</P>
<P>
   _ Promoted the ``next step in welfare reform,'' a plan aimed at
strengthening child support collections and increasing parental
responsibility. The proposal, released in Washington on Wednesday,
would require fathers who owe child support to pay up or go to
work, deny new credit cards to parents who owe support, eliminate
the ``marriage penalty'' in the tax code to encourage couples to
stay together and provide government grants for marriage counseling
and parenting classes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sidestepped questions on whether he supports dairy compacts,
which require milk processors to pay farmers a minimum price for
their milk.
</P>
<P>
   _ Renewed his challenge to Bradley to engage in a series of
debates before the end of the year and quipped that his opponent
would only agree to debate on the ``eve of Christmas'' at 11:30 on
a Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Bradley has agreed to participate in six debates
before the end of January _ two of them before Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   _ Denied ever calling Bradley a ``quitter'' for retiring from
the Senate in frustration.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ignored comments suggesting that he had allowed or encouraged
surrogates, New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer and Comptroller
H. Carl McCall, to do name-calling for him.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent political event, Spitzer and McCall harshly
criticized Bradley for choosing to leave the Senate in 1996 rather
than continue battling with the Republican majority. Bradley, who
had served in Senate for 18 years, was among seven Democratic
senators who left office in 1996, and the Gore campaign repeatedly
suggested that Bradley abandoned his party and principles.
</P>
<P>
   However, with that issue clearly not resonating with voters,
Gore seemed to back off somewhat on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show Gore and Bradley running neck-and-neck in New York, a
critical battleground for both the primary and general elections,
and both candidates are stepping up their activity in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has been to New York state several times in recent weeks.
Bradley is scheduled to campaign in Schenectady and Albany on
Saturday.

CUCUTA, Colombia: the anvil.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The experience of the group of 635 families that lived in the
mountains north of here until this summer illustrates that point.
Desperate to avoid the growing clashes south and west of their
villages that accompanied the arrival of the paramilitary death
squads, they crossed the border into neighboring Venezuela, where
they were settled temporarily in a camp under military supervision.
</P>
<P>
   President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela has described the situation
along the border as ``a mini-Kosovo,'' but he has made no effort to
offer the refugees shelter or asylum.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in Caracas this summer, Foreign Minister Jose
Vicente Rangel said Venezuela's position was that Colombians who
fled ``are not refugees,'' but merely people who were ``temporarily
displaced'' and therefore were not entitled to any international
protections.
</P>
<P>
   Citing international law, relief and aid agencies unanimously
reject that interpretation. But when the peasants moved back across
the border and were placed in the coliseum here in their home
province, they were met with an even more threatening welcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Behind the peasant exodus is the hand of the guerrillas,''
Col. Victor Hugo Matamoros was quoted as saying in a recent
interview with La Opinion, a local newspaper. ``Those who are in
the coliseum are with the FARC,'' the acronym for the country's
biggest insurgent group. He later retracted those comments, saying
they were taken out of context, but the declarations, which the
refugees heatedly deny, added to the tension.
</P>
<P>
   The recent surge in the ranks of the displaced could hardly come
at a worse moment for the Colombian government. The country
enduring its worst recession in 70 years, and the cost of
rebuilding from a devastating earthquake on the other side of the
country in January is competing with the needs of the displaced for
the limited funds available for relief.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``The economy is in the red, and that is bad for Colombia
because it means there are even less chances for displaced people
to get help or find jobs,'' Wavre of the Red Cross said. ``The
people who in the past might have taken them in and helped them are
in trouble themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Hostility against the displaced seems to be growing. The mayor
of Cali said recently that he was going to install highway
checkpoints on the outskirts of his city to ferret out and turn
away the displaced. He retracted the measure after an outcry from
human rights groups.
</P>
<P>
   But conditions in organized settlements like this one are hardly
better. The displaced in the coliseum here have no tents, food is
strictly rationed and medicine is in short supply. Their children
are not in school, and most worrisome of all, there is no sign of
when their ordeal might end.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people are confused and drifting,'' said the Rev.
Gustavo Sanchez Ardila, a Roman Catholic priest whose parishioners
were forced to flee the settlement of San Martin de Loba, just
north of here, in August. ``They have lost the only things they
had, their homes and animals, and do not know what to do or where
to go. It is the saddest thing I have ever seen.''

 HOME IMPROVEMENT QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
</HEADLINE>
  By BERNARD GLADSTONE

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: When hanging wallpaper I am confused as to how I should hang
the strip next to and over the door frame. Some tell me that I
should slit the strip lengthwise to the width needed to fit up
against the vertical side of the door frame, then finish by using
the rest of the strip to go between the top of the frame and the
ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   However, others tell me to hang the full width of the strip so
that it overlaps the side of the frame, then cut diagonally in from
the corner as one does when fitting around a window frame. Which
method do you think is better?
</P>
<P>
   A: The second method will result in a neater job because you do
not create a new seam over or alongside the door frame.
</P>
<P>
   Hang the full-width strip against the wall and let it overlap
the door frame as though it were not there.
</P>
<P>
   Then use scissors or razor blade to cut diagonally up from the
corner as shown in the drawing in order to permit flattening the
top part of the strip against the wall above the door.
</P>
<P>
   Crease into place along the side and top of the door frame, then
trim off excess with a razor and smooth the paper down against the
molding edge with a seam roller.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am trying to remove some round, non-skid disks about five
inches in diameter that are stuck to the bottom of my bathtub. I
have tried lighter fluid, but this has not worked. Can you help me?
</P>
<P>
   A: Your best bet is to heat these decals with a hair dryer, heat
gun (set on low) or with a heat lamp of some kind. This will soften
the adhesive on the back so that you will be able to peel the
``stick-ons'' off more easily.
</P>
<P>
   If any of the sticky residue remains on the tub, you can wipe it
off with one of the liquid adhesive removers that are sold in many
hardware stores and home centers.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My family room has pine paneling that was originally
varnished and is now painted. I find that about two years after it
was painted the tongue-and-groove boards have shrunk and there is a
dark, narrow space showing between the boards. Can I fill these
dark spaces with spackling compound or some type of calking and
then paint over them?
</P>
<P>
   A. Spackling compound probably would not last because it is too
brittle and will crack out. Silicone calking does remain
semi-flexible after it has cured, so it may stand up better _ but
only if the crack is fairly narrow.
</P>
<P>
   However, if you want to paint over the silicone you must be sure
to use a brand that is paintable (not all can be painted). Even
then, chances are it won't last for very long.
</P>
<P>
   Your only permanent solution is to take the boards down and
replace them properly.
</P>
<P>
   Q. My house has exterior redwood siding that was painted by the
previous owner. I would like to get back to the natural redwood
color and then stain the wood.
</P>
<P>
   I know all of the old paint must be removed first, but am not
sure how to go about it. One painter suggested having it
professionally washed off with a pressure sprayer, but I'm
reluctant. Can I can use a chemical remover to take the paint off
myself?
</P>
<P>
   A. Removing paint with a high pressure washer works best if the
paint is badly weathered and already starting to peel. Even then
the high-pressure stream of water can harm siding, trim or windows
if not carefully handled.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, you can remove the paint yourself with a chemical paint
remover. Use a semi-paste, water-wash remover that will enable you
to take the softened paint off by scraping and washing it off with
an ordinary hose.
</P>
<P>
   This will work, but it is a time-consuming, tedious job that
will involve lots of ladder climbing and considerable expense for
many gallons of remover.

 (ATTN: Ga.)  (For release Thursday, Oct. 28)

 By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 Santa Rosa (Calif.) Press Democrat   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   TYBEE ISLAND, Ga. _ Frances introduced herself by saying she
first came to Tybee Island on her honeymoon in ``nineteen hundred
and thirty-three,'' drawing it out all slow and syrupy. It became a
favorite vacation spot of hers and her late husband's and she had
``no idea this is where I'd end up.''
</P>
<P>
   Ending up on an island off the coast of Georgia, bothered only
by the occasional hurricane threat, we told her, looks pretty good.
Don't even talk about that Floyd, she said, pulling a face and
calling it a nuisance.
</P>
<P>
   She, along with everyone else on the island, was forced to
evacuate and that meant she spent 14 hours in traffic with her son
and daughter-in-law driving to Atlanta and then turning around and
coming back.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricanes don't worry her. At 89, she says ``someone's always
saying it's going to blow hard and then it doesn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Two friends and I came to Georgia for a long weekend, choosing
the Savannah area because we thought it sounded exotic, we like
grits and we'd read ``Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil.''
</P>
<P>
   We often talk about how we'll still be together when we're very
old, sitting on a porch somewhere, finishing each other's sentences
and continuing to bicker over politics and the acting abilities of
Kevin Costner.
</P>
<P>
   Even though an 89-year-old kindly called us ``y'all girls,'' the
idea of how and where people end up is something we relate to. We
notice a woman like Frances, walking barefoot with a cane, gold
earrings in, cutting a sharp figure in a cream-colored blouse
tucked into cream-colored shorts.
</P>
<P>
   Frances has a best friend, too, whose name is Mabel and who just
turned 90. They've known each other since they were 5 and 6 years
old. Mabel was there when Frances gave birth, telling her when to
push and forever claiming that Frances' son Charlie is part hers.
Frances keeps a photograph of Mabel on her coffee table and the two
talk on the phone every day.
</P>
<P>
   Since Frances moved to the island, seven of her friends have
died and five have moved into nursing homes. My friends and I know
about people dying and living in nursing homes. Frances has lived
longer and happier than two of our mothers. We prefer her way.
</P>
<P>
   She didn't plan ahead to age well. She claims she never even got
much exercise before she started walking up three flights of stairs
three times a day from the beach to her apartment. She says
``people have always spoiled me,'' including her son, who lives
down the beach and comes by every day.
</P>
<P>
   Her balcony looks out to where the wide Savannah River joins the
Atlantic. From a tall captain's chair she sees container ships go
by and shrimp boats, like the ones in ``Forrest Gump.'' She has a
sunset view of the Savannah skyline. On the beach, groups of people
catch shrimp in wide nets, and someone is always dropping off some
at her door.
</P>

   Best of all there are dolphins. If you've never been here before
you will stare at the water when the sun is coming up and think you
see a swimmer, but it's a fin. When that fin becomes a
better-than-Sea World leaping dolphin, you'll jump up and down in
your pajamas and force your friends awake for the miracle, which as
it turns out, happens every morning with many dolphins.

   Frances streamlined her life when she moved to Tybee, giving
most of her furniture to relatives who still had big houses and
taking with her mostly photographs of friends and family. She may
have great stories to tell. She hinted at something involving Henry
Ford and a woman she once knew. But she wants to talk about our
lives as much as we do hers and invites us back for ice cream,
``any time before midnight.''
</P>
<P>
   So, that's what we'll strive for. To live long and be lucky
enough to wake up to dolphins and eat ice cream before bed.

HAVE MILLENNIUM ANXIETY? BLAME THE MEDIA
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Friday, Oct. 22) 
(mk) 
 By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   According to the American Dialect Society (how many ``Brand X''
humor-columns begin with those words?), Millennium Anxiety
Disorder, or MAD, was one of the top-three new words in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that you have never heard of the term Millennium
Anxiety Disorder before could be a sign that you are suffering from
the thing. Or it could simply mean that you do not keep up with the
comings and goings of the American Dialect Society, which is
another problem entirely.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the American Dialect Society are much too busy
nominating words in categories like ``most useful,'' ``most
unnecessary'' and ``most outrageous'' to offer any clues to what
the causes and, more importantly, the cures, of Millennium Anxiety
Disorder might be. This is just another service that I perform,
along with weekly updates on my dog.
</P>
<P>
   If you look around, it is obvious that nearly everyone is
suffering from MAD, to a greater or lesser extent. If you're
nervous, excited and irritable, chances are you're suffering from
MAD. If you're not nervous, excited or irritable, then you are deep
in MAD-denial, which is even worse. Like everything else that's
wrong with America today, the blame rests squarely on the hairy,
sloping, apelike shoulders of the evolution-loving media.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the media drove us crazy by repeating the phrase
``millennium bug,'' ``millennium bug,'' ``millennium bug'' over and
over again until some of us went completely over the edge and began
collecting Pokemon cards, which apparently can be boiled down into
a nourishing broth in the event of the apocalypse.
</P>
<P>
   (The American Dialect Society, which does not create the problem
but simply acknowledges it, voted ``millennium bug'' the 1997 Word
of the Year.)
</P>
<P>
   The media hammered other words into the American consciousness
with equally predictable results. One example is the phrase
``sexual relations'' (No. 2 Word of the Year for 1998; No. 5 in the
category Most Euphemistic), one of many anxiety-producing words
that emerged from Monicagate (there's another). Another is ``Big
She'' as a synonym for you-know-who, and the verb ``Lewinsky,''
which means to have what might or might not be sexual relations
with another person, depending on what your definition of the word
``person'' might be.
</P>
<P>
   (All Monica-related words, by the way, were voted, as a wad, the
Most Unnecessary Words of 1998. Can we give the American Dialect
Society some sort of medal?)
</P>
<P>
   Other media-promoted words that could lead directly or
indirectly to Millennium Anxiety Disorder include e-commerce,
Viagra, road rage, wrong-site surgery (euphemism for cutting off
the wrong leg, arm or whatever), angst bunny (young woman with
black clothes and lots of body piercings), symmetry failure
(another term for wrong-site surgery) and dot (to strike someone
with the light from a laser pointer).
</P>
<P>
   So if the media are responsible for Millennium Anxiety Disorder
(and I think we have established that beyond a shadow of a doubt),
then what is the cure? Less media? Good luck. That's like telling a
Florida resident that the cure for mildew is less humidity.
</P>
<P>
   No, I'm afraid that the media, like professional wrestling, will
be with us for quite some time.
</P>
<P>
   The millennium itself, however, is another story. In another 78
days, we'll be able to put this whole thing behind us. All the
world's computers will have crashed or they won't have crashed.
Either way, it will be over.
</P>
<P>
   Unless, of course, you happen to be one of those annoying
literalists who insist that the millennium will not end until 2001.
</P>
<P>
   If you are, then I hope you come down with Millennium Anxiety
Disorder so bad that you require wrong-site surgery from a
road-raging angst-bunny.

COMMENTARY: BRADLEY'S POVERTY PUSH 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By BOB HERBERT    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bill Bradley, eschewing small themes in favor of a
grander vision of America, will argue Thursday, at a speech in
Brooklyn, that the United States has a moral obligation to do what
it can to lift as many children as possible from the punishing
confines of poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in a time of unprecedented prosperity,'' he said in an
interview, ``and yet there are still nearly 14 million children who
live in poverty. I think there is a broad consensus that we need to
change that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said he planned to ``lay out a broad goal to reduce
child poverty by a specific amount at a specific time.'' And he
will detail what he described as the initial steps, or ``down
payment,'' needed to move toward that goal.
</P>
<P>
   The speech is scheduled for Thursday morning at the Concord
Baptist Church in Bedford-Stuyvesant. And like his proposal to make
health care available to virtually all uninsured Americans, and his
insistence that a Bradley administration would work constantly to
break down racial barriers, his approach to child poverty appears
to be far more ambitious than the terminally incremental
initiatives that have plagued the country since the Clinton health
plan imploded.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said his speech would address the following: ``How do we
increase income for people who are poor? How do we provide child
care for people who are poor? How do we generate hope in the lives
of people who have had very little hope in their lives?''
</P>
<P>
   This antipoverty initiative is linked both literally and
symbolically to Bradley's desire to forge a more tolerant and
unified society. He noted that 36 percent of the poor children in
the United States are white, about 30 percent are black, and 22
percent are Latino. ``What I see as a possibility,'' he said, ``is
a multiracial coalition that would rekindle the same kind of
purposefulness as the civil rights revolution in the 1960s.''
</P>
<P>
   Most politicians have run like rabbits from that kind of talk.
Grand visions, idealism, kind words about the '60s _ all have been
anathema in the '90s. But Bradley, quietly, almost serenely, has
been saying the nation is ready once again to assert its better
self.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we still have a lot of catching up to do in terms of
our commitments to each other and our commitments to children who
are poor,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley acknowledged that inroads against poverty had been made
as the economy has improved over the past few years, but he said
that was not enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Poverty dropped, I think, 1 percent last year,'' he said.
``I'd rather have that happen than not happen. But it is still
higher than it was in 1989 and far higher than it was in 1970.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley voted against the so-called welfare reform legislation
that Bill Clinton signed into law in 1996. ``I didn't think the
federal government should cut off its commitment to individual
children who are poor,'' he said, adding, ``I didn't think the
answer to the problem of children in poverty was to have a group of
federal politicians take a pot of money and send it to the state
politicians and say, `Handle this problem as best you can.'''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said some of the more objectionable aspects of the law
had been modified, but more changes were needed.
</P>
<P>
   The Bradley campaign has been on a roll lately. He has raised
more money than expected, is doing better in the polls than
expected, and is planning a Madison Square Garden fund-raiser for
mid-November that will feature many of his big-name pals from
professional basketball.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign of Vice President Al Gore has been thrown on the
defensive, and Gore has been insisting he is now the underdog. I
asked Bradley for his view. He laughed and said, ``I'm running
against entrenched power. Anytime someone has the support of the
president of the United States, who is loyal to you because you've
been loyal to him; anytime someone has essentially the Democratic
National Committee and its leadership; anytime somebody has all the
big Democratic fund-raisers; anytime somebody arrives in Air Force
2 _ that's entrenched power.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I have are the people. And what I have is going out and
telling them what I want to do, and what I believe _ and just
trying to be who I am. And I think up to now, that's why we're
making progress.''

CRITICS CALL IOC CRACKDOWN A `PUBLIC RELATIONS PLOY' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ANDREW BROMAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House drug czar said Wednesday an
International Olympic Committee crackdown on the use of
performance-enhancing drugs by athletes amounted to a ``public
relations ploy.''
</P>
<P>
   The IOC has proposed a new independent agency to oversee
existing anti-doping programs that critics say are too lax.
</P>
<P>
   But those same critics say the proposed agency only appears to
be independent and will lack the sort of power needed to ensure all
Olympic athletes play by the rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is our view that the IOC is rushing forward to build an
institution that we cannot support,'' said Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey,
director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The proposal should have strong guarantees that the agency
will be independent and operate based on basic principles of good
governance ... '' McCaffrey said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and other lawmakers are advocating
the creation of an agency that would mandate year-round, random
drug tests for all Olympic athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the IOC controls drug-testing operations and is not
accountable to any other agency or government.
</P>
<P>
   One IOC official told the Senate committee they would welcome
more oversight by the international community.
</P>
<P>
   The formation of IOC policy should involve ``close cooperation
from all those countries involved,'' said Richard Pound, vice
president of the IOC. But the agency did not include the United
States or any other country in its planning process for an
anti-doping agency because he said it would have ``complicated
things.''
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey saw problems with excluding the United States. ``The
proposal asks national governments to pay half the bill for the
agency but fails to accord these governments a sufficient role in
the policy-making process,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Schamasch, director of the IOC medical commission, said
the international community should give the IOC's proposal a chance
to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to set up something and people say we don't do it
ight. Let the people who want to work, work,'' Schamasch said.
</P>
<P>
   Scrutiny of IOC operations peaked in January when officials were
accused of taking bribes so that Salt Lake City could land the 2002
winter games.
</P>
<P>
   That event, along with the discovery of widespread substance
abuse at the Tour de France in 1998, has prompted more calls for
reforms within the IOC.
</P>
<P>
   Former Olympian Frank Shorter said athletes can attain human
growth hormone, and even laboratory-produced artificial blood, to
enhance performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those of us close to international sport were not surprised''
by the use of drugs at the Tour de France, he said. ``The elite
athletes' grapevine is very extensive.''
</P>
<P>
   He said any new agency to conduct drug tests will have to
administer both blood and urine tests to detect different types of
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Wadler, associate professor of clinical medicine at New
York University, said more extensive research on performance
enhancements is needed because many of those substances banned are
found naturally in the body, making their presence difficult to
detect.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the IOC has not kept up with science, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because advances in biotechnology have outpaced advances in
laboratory science, the detection of certain drugs or biologicals
is today either impractical or impossible,'' he said.

COMMENTARY: THE FORBES FACTOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Elizabeth Dole's withdrawal was not good news for
the Republican front-runner, George W. Bush, who hoped she would
stay in, split his opposition and muddy up debates. Her supporters
will go mainly to John McCain, partly to Steve Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   Though the maverick McCain's steady rise in the polls has made
him the realistic alternative to Bush, Forbes is the Texan's
immediate worry. The well-heeled publisher knows where to spend and
how to hit.
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, the Bush campaign lined up focus groups in Iowa,
New Hampshire and South Carolina. After absorbing 10 TV spots
extolling Bush's virtues, these 70 willing guinea pigs were
subjected to three attack ads _ the sort of mean-spirited stuff
that Forbes is expected to use against Bush. Finally, the focus
groups were treated to the Bush response, deploring such tactics
and looking nobly put-upon.
</P>
<P>
   Bush sources assured The AP's Ron Fournier that the results were
``encouraging'' to their man. The Bush strategist Karl Rove tells
me the same, but won't be specific. The Forbes people smile,
disbelieving, and smack their lips.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes will not make the same mistake he did four years ago,
when his spot onslaught savaged Bob Dole but lashed back against
himself. This time a friendly Steve Forbes will appear on camera,
make nice to his GOP rival George W., and then take issue on a high
level.
</P>
<P>
   He will lay bare to GOP viewers Bush's tax raises in Texas,
perhaps recalling the read-my-lips heritage. Forbes will
respectfully disagree with Bush's education proposal, arguing
against transferring power from local parents to Washington. He
will deplore Bush's refusal to debate health care in depth and
stress the need to be able to choose one's own doctor. He will
contrast his strong policy toward Russia and China with the
Clinton-like Bush's ``tepid'' (never say ``wimpish'') approach.
</P>
<P>
   This will be subtler than the ``harsh, ugly words'' Rove reports
were used in Bush's simulated attack ads on himself. (Gee, I'd like
to see those self-flagellating spots.) Will the Forbes substitution
of the stiletto for the bludgeon enable him to run ``better than
expected'' in Iowa's January caucuses? Bush cannot counterattack in
kind; he will have to defend his record and expound his positions.
</P>
<P>
   With McCain passing up Iowa (his opposition to ethanol subsidies
infuriates farmers), Forbes might give Bush a run for both of their
money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am the conservative alternative,'' Forbes told me after
Dole's withdrawal Wednesday, ``in what is now a three-man race.''
He sees himself alone on the right (the tenacious Gary Bauer
notwithstanding), opposing a moderate and a maverick.
</P>
<P>
   It's true that Forbes is the only one of the three not running
against the conservative GOP congressional leadership, but I see
Forbes as a key factor in Bush vs. McCain rather than an
alternative to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   So does John Zogby, the only major pollster who was right on the
money in the last presidential campaign. ``When you ask people the
first thing that comes to mind about Forbes,'' Zogby says, ``the
answer is `multimillionaire.' His negatives are much too high for
him to be a nominee.'' Life is unfair.
</P>
<P>
   The Forbes Factor, however, is a constructive one. With not one
primary vote cast, the Bush war chest has already forced out Dole,
Dan Quayle and Lamar Alexander, but it won't force out Forbes. His
role is the opposite of spoiler; this time, he could be The
Improver, whose intelligent right-wing challenge will test Bush's
mettle in both necessary debate and in a preliminary War of the
Spots.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush can take on Forbes head-to-head in Iowa debates, and
then McCain head-to-head in New Hampshire debates, he will be not
bloodied but what old pols call ``blooded'' _ in shape to take on
either Al Gore or Bill Bradley. But if he ducks early, he will lose
later.
</P>
<P>
   Zogby sees Bush support ``a mile wide and an inch deep.'' Here's
the polling trend to watch: Last month, Bush beat the Democrats
Gore and Bradley by an average of 16 points, while McCain lost to
them by 9 points. That's changing; let's see how much
``winnability'' changes in the months to come.
</P>
<P>
   Note to Steve Forbes: The last day for filing in the New Jersey
senatorial race is March 8. That is the day after the decisive New
York and California presidential primaries.

HOUSE CONSERVATIVES ISSUE BUDGETARY WARNING TO CLINTON 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Sub to fix headline) 
 
By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House conservatives warned President Clinton on
Wednesday they will defeat any attempt to raise taxes to pay for
his spending priorities, a shot across the bow as budget
negotiators opened their first session on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, meanwhile, signed a $99 billion spending bill for
housing, veterans and space programs, hailing the measure as
symbolic of the bipartisan cooperation that can be displayed
between the White House and Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But while Clinton talked peace, he also prepared for budgetary
war, suggesting he would hold the $268 billion defense spending
bill, containing lucrative pork for Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott's hometown in Mississippi, until negotiators reach agreement
on all outstanding funding issues.
</P>
<P>
   A day after Clinton met with congressional leaders and they
agreed on a framework to begin resolving a spending impasse, the
spirit of bipartisan cooperation seemed to wane.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are here today to send one very clear message: Mr.
President. No means no,'' said Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas.
``When the Republicans say we're not going to touch the Social
Security surplus, we mean it. When we say that we're not going to
raise taxes, we mean it.''
</P>
<P>
   DeLay said Republican leaders left the White House session with
the understanding that Clinton would keep all the Social Security
surplus off limits and forgo tax increases. He termed ``very
unsettling'' comments made later by Democrats that taxes remained
on the table.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told reporters that he realized his proposal to raise
cigarette taxes by 55 cents a pack would not be acceptable to
Republicans. However, he said his spending priorities were ``quite
modest'' and that a way would be found to pay for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``So all I said was that I realized they weren't going to accept
my proposal, but that now we were talking about much more modest
amounts. ... I thought we could find a way to pay for them that
they (Republicans) could live with,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also kept Republicans bristling by saying he agreed to
avoid the Social Security surplus but that the GOP already had
dipped into the extra cash. Republicans, in turn, continued touting
a Congressional Budget Office letter that says they had not spent
the surplus.
</P>
<P>
   The tax issue is just one of many that White House and Congress
must resolve by a Tuesday deadline set for themselves. Negotiators
held an opening session on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   The 2000 fiscal year began Oct. 1, but Congress has not
completed work on all 13 spending bills. Clinton, with his action
Wednesday, has signed six into law, two remain on his desk and he
vetoed two. Three others are pending in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Again I say, in spite of all the conflicts of the last few
weeks, we still have a great opportunity to make this a season of
progress and work together to pass a budget that lives within its
means and lives up to our values,'' Clinton said as he signed the
spending bill funding the Veterans Affairs, Housing and Urban
Development, and independent agencies such as NASA.
</P>
<P>
   The measure provides $13.7 billion for the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration, an additional $100 million over current
funding. The House wanted to cut NASA by $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives NASA the resources it needs to probe the mysteries of
space,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   It also provides money for an additional 60,000 home vouchers
for low-income families, provides $70 million for Rural/Urban
Empowerment Zones that provide tax breaks for businesses moving
into designated areas and provides $19.8 billion for medical care
for veterans. It includes $2.5 billion in emergency funding for
victims of Hurricane Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he would not decide until next week whether to sign
a defense spending bill that Republicans are pressing him to
approve immediately.
</P>
<P>
   It contains a 4.8 percent pay increase for military personnel.
But, it also includes a $375 million downpayment on a $1.5 billion
``minicarrier'' being built in Pascagoula, Miss., the home town of
Lott. The Navy did not want the ship until 2011.
</P>
<P>
   The defense bill may become the White House's hold card as
Republicans push for an across-the-board spending cut. Republicans
want to exempt the defense bill from reductions, but the White
House contends the GOP would have to cut 17 percent from other
bills if they exclude the military.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he outlined the priorities to Republicans that he
intends to fight for. They include more funds to place 100,000
teachers in the classroom, to hire more police, to help finance the
Middle East peace process, to help reduce Russia's nuclear arsenal,
to pay for debt relief for poor nations and to pay the back dues
owed the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Despite negotiations, Republicans moved ahead to send remaining
spending measures to the president. The House narrowly passed, on a
215-213 vote, a $38 billion funding bill for the departments of
commerce, state and justice. Clinton has said he would veto the
measure as written.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the House also takes up its version of education
policy, eliminating Clinton's program for 100,000 classroom
teachers enacted last year and turning over the money to states in
the form of block grants.

   Calvin Griffith, who in his three decades as owner of the
Washington Senators and their successor, the Minnesota Twins,
personified a lost age when baseball teams were run as
tight-spending family businesses, died Wednesday at a hospital in
Melbourne, Fla. He was 87.
</P>
<P>
   ``Calvin was one of the dinosaurs in the game,'' said Tom Kelly,
the Twins' manager.
</P>
<P>
   In the decades following World War II, baseball was becoming a
huge corporate enterprise. But Griffith, whose family baseball
roots dated back to the 19th century, ran his teams in a manner
befitting those simpler days. His Twins won one pennant and two
division titles, but he usually refused to pay competitive
salaries, shunned modern marketing methods and loaded the front
office with relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``People said he threw around nickels like manhole covers,''
said pitcher Jim (Mudcat) Grant, who won 21 games for the
pennant-winning Twins in 1965, then was offered a $3,000 raise.
``He protected his money.''
</P>
<P>
   But Griffith pointed out he was one of the only club owners
remaining who made a living solely from baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who call me cheap never had to make a payroll,'' he
said in the early 1980s, his last years in Minnesota. ``This is one
club that always pays its bills. We owe nobody.''
</P>
<P>
   Calvin Griffith, a native of Montreal, was a nephew of Clark
Griffith, a National League pitching star of the 1890s, a founder
of the American League, a manager and then the owner of the
Washington Senators.
</P>
<P>
   After Calvin's father, Jimmy Robertson, died when Calvin was a
youngster, Clark Griffith adopted him and a sister, Thelma.
</P>
<P>
   Calvin, who then took the Griffith name, became the senators'
batboy, and he watched Walter Johnson win the seventh game of the
1924 World Series against the Giants. After attending George
Washington University, and catching for its baseball team, he
became an executive, manager and part-time player in the senators'
minor league organization, then returned to Washington in 1941 to
run the concession operation at Griffith Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   When Clark Griffith died in October 1955, Calvin and his sister
Thelma gained control of the team, and Calvin was named club
president.
</P>
<P>
   By then, the senators had gone without a pennant for more than
two decades. The opening-day ceremony when the president threw out
the first ball was the high point of the season. The senator ball
park was small, the parking inadequate and the broadcast revenue
relatively meager.
</P>
<P>
   Although plans were in the works to build a new stadium with
Federal funds _ the future Robert F. Kennedy Stadium _ Griffith
left after the 1960 season, taking the team to the Minneapolis-St.
Paul area, where it became the Minnesota Twins. An expansion club,
taking the name Washington Senators (now the Texas Rangers),
arrived in the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Griffith finally began spending money and saw success on the
field in 1965, when the Twins, led by Harmon Killebrew, Bob
Allison, Tony Oliva, Zoilo Versalles, Jim Kaat and Grant, won the
American League pennant, then lost the World Series to the Dodgers
in seven games.
</P>
<P>
   The team captured divisional titles in 1969 and 1970, but by the
early '70s, attendance began to fall off. After free agency arrived
in 1976, the Twins lost several top players because Griffith
declined to meet mounting salary demands.
</P>
<P>
   Griffith seemed happy, however, to be in Minnesota. But in
September 1978, telling a civic group in the town of Waseca that he
had no regrets about having left Washington, he created a storm.
</P>
<P>
   He was quoted as saying ``we came here because you've got good,
hardworking white people here,'' and that ``black people don't go
to ball games, but they'll fill up a rassling ring and put up such
a chant it'll scare you to death.''
</P>
<P>
   In a front-page editorial, The Minneapolis Star called for
Griffith to sell the team. He said his remarks were taken out of
context, but civil rights groups advocated a boycott of Twins games
and the future Hall of Famer Rod Carew said he did want to keep
playing for Griffith's ``plantation.'' Carew left for the
California Angels as a free agent in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, the Twins moved from Metropolitan Stadium in suburban
Bloomington to the Metrodome in downtown Minneapolis, but the
payroll was only one-third the major league average and the team
lost 102 games.
</P>
<P>
   Griffith nonetheless disdained marketing efforts. In early 1984,
when it was feared he might sell the team to interests who would
move it, a business task force drew up a marketing plan to win back
the fans, then asked for $125,000 from Griffith to implement it. He
refused to spend the money.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1984, Griffith gave up. He and Thelma Griffith Haynes
sold their 52 percent interest in the Twins for $32 million to Carl
Pohlad, a Minneapolis banking executive, under whose ownership the
Twins won World Series titles in 1987 and 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Griffith, who had homes in Melbourne and Edina, Minn., is
survived by his wife, Belva Block; a son, Clark, of Minneapolis;
two daughters, Corinne Pillsbury of Wayzata, Minn., and Clare
Griffith, of Berkeley, Calif; a sister, Mildred Cronin, of
Osterville, Mass., the widow of the Hall of Famer and Senator
shortstop and manager and American League president Joe Cronin; a
brother, Billy Robertson, of Melbourne, and three grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   When Griffith sold the Twins, he gave up a family ownership that
went back to 1919, when Walter Johnson won 20 games for the
Senators and Babe Ruth was in his final year with the Red Sox. But
he seemed to have few regrets. The day the sale was approved by his
fellow owners, Griffith, at age 72, said, ``I feel a lot younger
already.''

 &HT;    UPS sets price for IPO
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ United Parcel Service set a price range of $36 to $42
a share for its upcoming initial public offering.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based UPS will sell 109.4 million shares, or about 10
percent of its stock. The expected price range and number of shares
to be sold reflect the effects of a planned 2-for-1 split prior to
the offering.
</P>
<P>
   A midrange price of $39 would value the offering at $4.2
billion, eclipsing the $4 billion Conoco Inc. offering of 1998,
considered the biggest to date.
</P>
<P>
   UPS shares are valued at $25.50 internally, including the effect
of the split, so the company hopes for a significant boost in the
public market. The offering is expected to occur in November,
pending employee-shareholder approval at a special meeting Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, employee-owned shares still would exercise 99
percent voting control after the offering. UPS would use cash from
the offering to launch a tender offer to employee shareholders,
giving them a chance to sell up to 10 percent of their shares at
the market-established price. The company says the main purpose of
the offering is to create a public market for shares that can be
used as currency in future acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   Separately on Wednesday, the Teamsters union said UPS is
creating the first 2,000 new full-time jobs under terms of a 1997
strike settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement had called for 2,000 new full-time jobs in each
year of the five-year deal, for a total of 10,000. But UPS refused
to add the jobs during the first two years of the pact, saying it
didn't have to because package volume remained below pre-strike
levels.
</P>
<P>
   UPS spokesman Norman Black said volume has now recovered, and
that the company expects to add 2,000 jobs in each of the next two
years.
</P>
<P>
   The union has filed grievances against UPS, contending it should
still add the total of 10,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than 180,000 Teamsters waged a major national strike to
win these new jobs,'' Teamsters President James P. Hoffa said. ``My
administration is committed to getting all 10,000 jobs. We will not
tolerate company delays and numbers manipulations.''

BOSTON COLLEGE SHOWED SPUNK ON DEFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Pedro Cirino and Chris Hovan, Boston College's
defensive cocaptains, sat beside each other on the Alumni Stadium
bench last Saturday and fought feelings of frustration. The Eagles
trailed Pittsburgh, 16-13, with 4:01 left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how much eye black Hovan smeared on his face _ which
has been his custom before every game the last two seasons _ there
was no masking the emotions that stirred within the senior
defensive tackle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I remember most about the game was sitting on the
sidelines with Chris Hovan and his eyes were watering,'' Cirino
said. ``He was like, `We can't lose this game, you know?' And I was
like, `We're not losing this one. Don't worry about that.' And he
went out there, man, and he put on a damn show. If there's a better
defensive lineman than he is, I'd like to see him in person,
because I doubt there is one.
</P>
<P>
   ``There can't be anyone better than he is.''
</P>
<P>
   On BC's final two defensive series, Hovan dominated the line of
scrimmage and, for all intents and purposes, took control of the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just unleashed Chris,'' Cirino said Wednesday, four days
after the Eagles' 20-16 victory. ``There's not that much to say
other than they just unleashed him. They put him at the end and,
like I said, they can't block that kid, man. They can't block him.
He's such a pleasure to watch out there. I'm sitting in the
secondary and I watch him sometimes, he's so much fun to watch.''
</P>
<P>
   Hovan dropped Pitt running back Kevan Barlow for a 3-yard loss
on the Panthers' first play from scrimmage on their own 30. After
two incompletions, the Panthers punted and BC's offense capitalized
with Tim Hasselbeck's 36-yard strike to Dedrick Dewalt with 1:48
left. Then Hovan and Co. shut the door on the Panthers.
</P>
<P>
   On Pitt's final possession, Sean Guthrie and Hovan rang up
back-to-back sacks of quarterback David Priestely to force the
Panthers back to their 10, where a fourth-and-28 completion fell 3
yards shy of a first down.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last four minutes of the game, I've been there so many
times in my life where you look back at the Notre Dame or maybe the
Navy game, and sitting there on that last series I'm like, `This is
up to us,' '' said Hovan, a 6-foot-3-inch, 290-pound senior from
Rocky River, Ohio. ``It's up to us on the defensive line to put
pressure on the quarterback so he can't make things happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sean Guthrie came up big on first down and fueled the fire,
and I came back on second down, and then we forced him out of the
pocket on third down, and forced him to make a bad pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew what we had to do to win that game. The emotion that
was present at that stage of the game was (pretty) high.''
</P>
<P>
   Hovan's inspired effort against the Panthers, who were held to
45 yards rushing, earned him Big East Defensive Player of the Week
honors. He rang up seven tackles (including four for losses
totaling 27 yards), had two quarterback sacks, one quarterback
hurry, and one forced fumble. It prompted Pitt coach Walt Harris to
seek out and salute Hovan afterward _ as coaches often do to
players _ with a pat on the butt.
</P>
<P>
   Several members of Miami's offensive line offered Hovan a
similar gesture after he waged a tremendous battle in the trenches
last Halloween in a 35-17 loss to the Hurricanes at the Orange
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, it was great respect, but the fact of the matter was
that they won that game,'' Hovan said. ``No matter how hard I
played, we still should have won that game. That's the thing I
remember. Some of those guys said, `You're the hardest guy I've
played against,' but they still beat us, so I have that hanging
over my head.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Eagles (5-1 overall, 2-1 Big East) play host to No. 23
Miami (2-3, 0-0), Hovan would like nothing more than to return the
compliment after a BC victory. However, BC's defense will first
have to figure a way to contend with the Hurricanes' myriad of
playmakers, _ from running back James Jackson to wideout Santana
Moss to quarterback Kenny Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has to start with the defensive line,'' said Hovan, who has
made five sacks, forced three fumbles, and leads the conference in
tackles for a loss (11 for 59 yards). ``They have a good offensive
line, a great tailback, a good quarterback, and two great
receivers. So it's going to have to start with us, because we're
going to have to step up and stop the run, and we're going to have
to put more pressure on the quarterback.''

BROWN HOPES TO BREAK PENN'S HOME FIELD ADVANTAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Brown is off to a successful start to the Ivy League season and
has won 10 of its last 11 games the past two years. But if the
Bears lose to Pennsylvania on Saturday, their league title hopes
could be finished. Brown has not won at Philadelphia's Franklin
Field since 1979.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to put that kind of pressure on the team, but I
don't think you are going to win the Ivy League with a 5-2
record,'' Brown coach Phil Estes said.
</P>
<P>
   Brown (2-1 in the league, 4-1 overall) squandered a 21-point
lead against Cornell Oct. 2 and lost, 33-28. Last week, the Bears
had a 24-point advantage over Rhode Island, but prevailed, 27-25.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been jumping out to the lead by 14 or 21 points and
squandering it in the second half,'' Estes said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've set goals for the team each game _ to beat Yale at the
Yale Bowl, to beat Princeton at Brown, where we hadn't beaten them
since 1987, and now it's to win at Franklin Field.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Brown defeated the Quakers, 58-51, in Providence as
James Perry passed for 470 yards and five touchdowns. Perry passed
for 299 yards and four touchdowns against Rhode Island and is the
Ivy League career leader in completions (634) and touchdown passes
(60). Perry has 7,591 career passing yards, second to Columbia's
John Witkowski (7,849 yards).
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Perry) directs our offense and he has a great sense of
being in the pocket,'' Estes said. ``And our receivers have really
stepped up.''
</P>
<P>
   This could be another high scoring game. Penn's Gavin Hoffman
had a school-record 399 yards passing in a 41-17 win over Columbia
last week. Hoffman threw four touchdown passes.
</P>
<P>
   In other Ivy League games, Cornell (3-0, 4-1) visits Dartmouth
(0-2, 0-5); Harvard (1-1, 3-2) hosts Princeton (0-2, 2-3); and Yale
(1-1, 4-1) visits Columbia (0-2, 2-3). In a Patriot League game,
Holy Cross (1-1, 2-4) visits Lehigh (1-0, 6-0).
</P>
<P>
   Harvard has struggled to maintain a lead the last three games,
but held off Fordham, 37-30, in a nonconference win last week.
</P>
<P>
   Holy Cross snapped a three-game losing streak with a 24-23 win
over Fairfield last week as Tavares Brewington made five tackles
for losses and James Jenkins blocked a 26-yard field goal attempt
on the final play of the game. Holy Cross displayed resourcefulness
against Fairfield, which had 27 first downs to 15 for the
Crusaders.
</P>
<P>
   The Crusaders will have a difficult test with Lehigh, which has
an 18-game winning streak. Last week, Lehigh defeated Delaware,
42-35, as Rick Moore caught nine passes for 224 yards and two
touchdowns.

<P>
   Considering the once-in-a-millennium marketing opportunity that
potential year 2000 computer malfunctions present, the nation's
large manufacturers and retailers of consumer products _ even many
that stand to benefit from fears of disruption _ have been
remarkably restrained.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not going to exploit this,'' said William Spain, a
senior vice president for public affairs at Del Monte, the largest
producer of canned fruits and vegetables. ``We don't think that's
responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   Even companies that have enjoyed soaring demand from the limited
ranks of consumers who appear to be stockpiling goods in advance of
what many now refer to as Y2K have been strikingly passive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have never mentioned Y2K on our Web site or in marketing
letters,'' said David Kauntarich, president of Crown Point, a
packager of ready-to-eat meals in Mullins, S.C., whose main
customer is the U.S. military. Kauntarich said he was happy to see
commercial sales for Crown Point, which is part of Unaka Corp.,
rocket up from an average of about 7,000 cases a month to a peak of
42,000 in March, mostly on the strength of year 2000 advertising by
independent distributors. But he did nothing to try to reverse the
subsequent slide back to the current level of about 12,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want people to say we were fanning the flames, and I
don't want to be labeled as a Y2K product,'' Kauntarich said.
</P>
<P>
   Legions of entrepreneurs at the fringe of the economy have
avidly promoted products like dried foods and home power generators
that might help people through potential disruptions. And a few
subsidiaries of major companies have been aggressively trying to
persuade consumers _ or at least the retailers that sell to them _
that the potential for year 2000 disruptions justifies loading up
on their wares.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``Y2K is a marketers' dream, an opportunity created by the media
and a date change,'' said Edward Brice, director of business
development for Sony Media Solutions, a unit of Sony Corp. that is
based in Oradell, N.J., and makes data storage products. Brice says
he has been working with wholesalers and retailers to ``get Y2K on
people's minds.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, some big names like Staples Inc., the nation's
largest office supply chain, and Eveready Battery Co., the Ralston
Purina unit that makes Eveready and Energizer batteries, have begun
promotional campaigns highlighting how their services and products
can help protect consumers from year 2000 troubles.
</P>
<P>
   Such steps are still unusual, though, and most companies with
Y2K-linked promotions have been careful to make it clear that they
are not predicting how the transition to next year will unfold.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Among those taking this low-key approach is Giant Food, a
supermarket chain that serves the Washington and Baltimore areas.
The company, a subsidiary of the Dutch supermarket giant Royal
Ahold, has sponsored radio messages proclaiming its readiness for
year 2000 and is providing customers with lists of items that the
American Red Cross recommends for Y2K preparedness, like batteries
and bottled water for use in the event of utility failures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not telling people to buy it now, but, if you're
worried, it's available,'' said Barry Scher, Giant Food's
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The year 2000 problem stems from the inability of many computers
to handle year 2000 dates. Preparedness advocates argue that an
accumulation of foul-ups, most of them tiny, could shut down some
crucial services like electrical power and gum up others next year.
The risk of last-minute panic buying, these advocates say,
increases as major companies shun aggressive marketing of products
that consumers might want in the event of shutdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``People aren't going to panic if they are prepared,'' said
Paloma O'Riley, a preparedness advocate based in Louisville, Colo.
Consumers are more likely to stock up gradually and sensibly if
retailers raise Y2K awareness, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, but there is scant evidence of that so far. Hannaford
Brothers Co., which has 155 supermarkets from South Carolina to
Maine, began adding inventories of items on the Red Cross
preparedness list this summer and displaying them at the ends of
aisles with preparedness information.
</P>
<P>
   ``It came in handy when Hurricane Floyd hit,'' said William
Homa, Hannaford's chief information officer. But aside from the run
on such items in the North Carolina stores when the storm struck in
September, sales of such items have not significantly increased.
</P>
<P>
   That could change if the number of reported computer date
failures rises noticeably this fall, a development that consultants
like Gartner Group in Stamford, Conn., say is likely.
</P>
<P>
   For now, even though many companies are preparing contingency
plans for serious disruptions, betting on such trouble looks like a
no-win situation to many corporate marketers. Most agree with the
government's current view that the computer date problems are
unlikely to produce more than minor, short-lived problems around
most of the country. That makes pushing the sale of preparedness
products seem like a high-risk strategy.
</P>
<P>
   The risks are partly a matter of corporate reputation. If a
last-minute wave of panic leads to food hoarding, runs on banks or
other chaotic behavior, companies with advertising programs
reinforcing the climate of fear will be branded as reckless and
greedy. And consumers faced with bare shelves might focus their
blame on companies that had advertised themselves as sellers of
year 2000 preparedness.
</P>
<P>
   Many companies say that financial considerations also point to a
cautious approach. Consumers may well stay calm and leave merchants
who fill their shelves with year 2000 goods choked with inventory
at the end of December, when taxes on everything they own are
calculated. And most retailers do not want to do anything that adds
to the seasonal problems of handling Christmas exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``What if customers load up on Y2K merchandise in December and
then bring it back in January?'' said Janice Drummond, a
spokeswoman for Sears, Roebuck.
</P>
<P>
   Sears recently began telling purchasers of home generators that
they will have to pay a ``restocking fee'' of 20 percent of the
sale price if they return the generators next year.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Returns are a major concern for smaller retailers. McGuckin
Hardware, a family-owned store in Boulder, Colo., has sold several
hundred kerosene heaters so far this year, up from just a handful
two years ago. The heaters and other big-ticket Y2K items like
generators carry ``no refund, no return'' stickers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no way I can take hundreds of heaters back,'' said
Harry Ransom, the assistant store manager in charge of McGuckin's
Y2K program. The store has set aside a Y2K section with
ready-to-eat foods, heating and lighting equipment and even theme
T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   Reluctance to exploit Y2K fears does not mean that retailers and
manufacturers have not thought long and hard about how consumer
behavior might change as the rollover approaches.
</P>
<P>
   Some are taking the approach of banks, which have made
arrangements to refill automated teller machines more quickly than
usual if consumers begin withdrawing large amounts of cash as the
New Year weekend approaches.
</P>
<P>
   The bottled-water businesses of Nestle, including brands like
Perrier and Poland Spring, have begun ramping up production and
shipments to handle post-Christmas sales that some in the industry
expect to surge 25 percent, to peak summer levels. But a rival,
Groupe Danone, maker of Evian, is still searching for signs that
such a demand spike is coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``Behavior assumptions can be very tricky,'' said Michael
Neuwirth, a spokesman for Danone's North American water operations.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street is certainly not expecting any spectacular financial
returns as a result of Y2K-inspired consumer-goods purchases. The
industry leaders for many of the products on popular preparedness
lists are units of large, diversified multinationals. A major jump
in end-of-year disposable diaper sales, for example, would not move
the Procter &AMP; Gamble battleship much. The same might be said of
Gillette Co. and its Duracell batteries or Eli Lilly &AMP; Co. and
insulin for diabetics. In addition, analysts expect that most of
the extra purchases in 1999 will reduce demand for such products
early next year.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some major companies are beginning to back modest
marketing efforts. In September, Staples announced a program for
both Y2K preparations and ``sound record-keeping practice at the
end of every year.'' Staples, which is based in Framingham, Mass.,
is waiving fees through Dec. 31 for downloading and reading
computer files that small business owners and home office workers
send to its copy centers for backup. Staples is also paying the
costs of shipping paper copies.
</P>
<P>
   And Eveready recently sponsored advertising inserts in
newspapers to kick off an $11 million campaign highlighting the
advice by the American Red Cross to set aside three days' to a
week's worth of supplies _ including batteries _ for Y2K, treating
it like a major storm. It is also donating $100,000 worth of
batteries to local Red Cross units.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The working assumption for most merchants is that any surge will
begin after Thanksgiving and hit hardest after Christmas. A few
companies say they are gearing up already to court such business.
7-Eleven Co., which normally runs monthlong advertising promotions
for its 5,000 stores, is currently leaning toward introducing
banners promoting Y2K preparedness products along with its New
Year's party goods on Dec. 26. It has also added Sony Walkman
radios to its inventory in part because portable radios are on most
Y2K preparation lists.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great opportunity to deliver on our promise of
convenience,'' said Margaret Chabris, a spokeswoman for the
company.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Much of the planning is mere guesswork, though. After all,
American business has little incentive to do much research.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no ongoing return for learning how to do this,'' said
Robert Blattberg, a marketing professor in the J.L. Kellogg
Graduate School of Management at Northwestern University. ``It's a
one-time event.''

SMALL TEXAS CITY SEEKS TO PUT CAP ON ITS POPULATION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By EVAN MOORE 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KELLER, Texas _ Surrounded by Fort Worth and two airports and
faced with growth that many communities would envy, this city is
moving to cap its population at fewer than 45,000 residents.
</P>
<P>
   The plan may seem surprising to other communities, but not to
the 24,500 residents of Keller or any of its neighboring North
Texas towns, said Mayor Dave Phillips.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's any opposition to it, it's only come from people
who don't think we're limiting it enough,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The City Council this week voted to pursue a plan to increase
the minimum size of a single-family residential lot from 8,400
square feet to 12,000 square feet. The idea is that, that will
result in no more than 43,400 residents within Keller's 19 square
miles during the next 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting about 10 miles north of downtown Fort Worth, Keller was
a rural whistle-stop for almost 90 years. It was originally named
Athol, but when a railroad stop was placed there in the 1880s, the
town was renamed after Texas and Pacific Railroad foreman John C.
Keller. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Its growth was slow until the 1970s, when Fort Worth's
population began to edge northward. Even then, however, it remained
rural with a population at less than 5,000. Recently, though,
Alliance Airport and its attendant growth has been added to north
Tarrant County. On top of that is the North Texas Speedway
northwest of Keller and Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport on
the east.
</P>
<P>
   And Keller has been growing steadily. Between 1980 and 1990 the
town's population grew from 4,156 to 13,683. By 1999, estimates put
the number at 24,500. At that rate, Keller's projected population
could be at 50,000 within five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't mean we'll have absolutely no lots less than 12,000
square feet,'' said Phillips of the city's new plan. ``We have
subdivisions on the south side of town, what I'd call ``high end'
subdivisions, but with lots as small as 8,400 square feet, and
those lots are not all filled.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the north side it's almost all `ranchettes.' People from
Fort Worth with the money to buy acreage and build on it have moved
in up there. They've been there for several years with pasture land
and cows surrounding them and, all of a sudden, they fear a
subdivision with little lots coming in behind them, and they don't
want it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes they'll even oppose a subdivision with the same size
lots as the one they live in.''
</P>
<P>
   The concept of limiting growth is not unique to Keller. The
nearby community of Flower Mound has opted for no population
expansion with an ongoing moratorium on new housing, and Southlake,
to the east, also is temporarily limiting building permits to no
more than one house per acre.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody moved up here just so they could reach out and touch
their neighbor's house,'' said Susan Ford, president of the Keller
Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband and I could have moved just about anywhere in north
Tarrant County, but we chose this place because it was rural and we
wanted the acreage. There might be some opposition from some
developer to this plan, but I doubt if you'd find any resident of
Keller who opposed it.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor said the council considered the fact that limiting
residential growth would mean higher taxes but decided residents
would prefer higher taxes to closer neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on current costs, we projected taxes will rise between
$48 and $65 per capita over the next 20 years,'' he said. ``Based
on the average family of 3.08, that would mean an increase of about
$150 per household. We think they can afford it and are willing to
pay it.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposal will have to go through a series of public hearings
by the City Council and Planning and Zoning Commission before it
can be adopted, but Phillips said he foresees little opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just surprised at the interest we generated with this,''
he said. ``I've even gotten calls from Austin about it.''

NORRIS WON'T BITE ON SIDESHOW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ Could Mike Tyson and Co. be trying to rattle
Orlin Norris, the former heavyweight champion's opponent Saturday
in Las Vegas?
</P>
<P>
   First, the bout was changed from 12 to 10 rounds and no one
bothered to tell Norris. Then, Tyson said he would bite again under
similar circumstances to that of his infamous ear-chomping bout
with Evander Holyfield in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Norris, 34 and a 14-year veteran, isn't fazed.
</P>
<P>
   He joked about the prospect of Tyson chewing off part of his
body, saying that if the referee didn't stop the fight immediately,
he'd get in his own chomps.
</P>
<P>
   However, in a more serious moment, he said Tyson's
unpredictability is no factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to draw away from what I have to do in the
fight,'' he said. ``I'm going to do what I have to do. If he
resorts to (unusual tactics), I can't say what's going to happen. I
have to see what the referee is going to do, if he's going to do
his job, and go from there.''
</P>
<P>
   Norris' handlers were upset that they found out about the change
in the number of rounds through the grapevine. Norris, however,
doesn't seem to care.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't really make a difference to me,'' he said. ``I know
I signed a contract for a 12-round fight. And it was never told to
me or my people it was changed.''
</P>
<P>
   The important thing to Norris, who will be paid $800,000, is
that Tyson selected him for his latest comeback fight. He'd waited
his entire career for such an opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sitting back praying it was me they would pick,'' Norris
said. ``I was hoping they would make that mistake and say we want
Orlin Norris.''
</P>
<P>
   The fight was originally scheduled for 12 rounds because a minor
championship was supposed to be at stake. That later changed.
</P>
<P>
   __ More biting comment: Tyson said he wasn't serious when he
suggested he would bite again if the referee failed to protect him
from repeated head butts, which he claims was the case against
Holyfield.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was simply trying to sell the fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fight talk,'' he told the Las Vegas Review-Journal. ``Get
the people interested. Make them want to see you do what you do.
Have you ever watched wrestling on TV? When you hear Stone Cold
Steve Austin say he's going to give the other guy a neck-breaker
and do this and do that to him, doesn't it make you want to go out
and see the next match or buy the pay-per-view?
</P>
<P>
   ``. . . We need to get people out to watch us. That's how we
make our living.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyson also dismissed a comment he made that he tried to break
the arm of Francois Botha in his last bout, even though it seems
clear he !ital!did try to hurt Botha.
</P>
<P>
   __ Enough prison: Tyson, who has had two stints behind bars,
said he's had enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I don't ever want to see a courtroom again,'' he
said. ``I don't even want to watch on TV and see one of those
shows. I don't want nothing to do with prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want any legal situations.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Too small?: One reason Norris is a 12-1 underdog and
dismissed as a hand-picked opponent is that he spent much of his
career as a cruiserweight.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he has been at the 190-pound cruiserweight limit in
only 12 of his 55 fights.
</P>
<P>
   He went down in weight because he thought that would provide him
the best opportunity to win a world championship _ and it did _ but
could not longer make the weight by the end of 1995. His last eight
fights have been as a heavyweight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know those comments are out there and they don't really
bother me,'' he said. ``I had more than 30 heavyweight fights
before I fought as a cruiserweight.
</P>
<P>
   ``. . . When I fought as a cruiserweight, I was a very weak man.
I had to lose 40 pounds for each fight. I wasn't strong at all.''

 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Elizabeth Dole, the first woman to be taken
seriously as a candidate for her party's presidential nomination,
dropped out of the race on Wednesday, saying she could not raise
enough money to compete with the personal fortune of one Republican
rival and the political heritage of another.
</P>
<P>
   Her withdrawal came before a single ballot had been cast _ in
itself a searing statement about the overriding importance of money
in politics. Mrs. Dole had raised $4.7 million in the last nine
months, compared with more than $56 million raised by Gov. George
W. Bush of Texas, the Republican front-runner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've learned that the current political calendar and election
laws favor those who get an early start and can tap into huge
private fortunes or who have a pre-existing network of political
supporters,'' Mrs. Dole told reporters at a hotel news conference
here. ``Steve Forbes has unlimited resources. Governor Bush has
raised over $60 million and has about $40 million on hand. Both are
starting to run TV ads next week.''
</P>
<P>
   Their advantages, she said, had overwhelmed her. ``It would be
futile to continue,'' she said, tears welling in her eyes. Mrs.
Dole, a controlled performer and notorious perfectionist, loathed
admitting defeat, friends said, but felt relieved that she was
getting out.
</P>
<P>
   Her absence does little to alter the balance of power in the
now-seven, now-all-male Republican field, where she had been
sliding from second place to third. But her presence _ as a woman _
carried an element of unpredictability that might have propelled
her to the front of the pack had it not been for Bush's early sweep
of cash and endorsements and Mrs. Dole's own failure to capitalize
on her strengths.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has learned the lesson that others have learned who have
been pruned from the field _ that Governor Bush is sucking all of
the available establishment and center-right money out of the
process,'' said Rich Bond, a former chairman of the Republican
Party. ``She was faced with a very stark choice _ spend 100 percent
of her time fund raising in order to be marginally competitive, or
beat a strategic retreat in the face of actual electoral losses.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Dole blamed her poor showing on tactical problems. She said
she should have become an active candidate sooner than January,
when she quit as president of of the American Red Cross. When she
started making calls for support in early February, she said, it
was too late. ``The endorsements were gone by that point,'' she
said, snapped up by Bush, who, she said, had been laying the
groundwork for his campaign since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   And she painted a grim picture of the cycle of defeat that
ensnares a cashless campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line remains money,'' she said. ``In fact, it's a
kind of Catch-22. Inadequate funding limits the number of staff at
headquarters and in key states. It restricts your ability to
communicate with voters. It places a ceiling on travel and travel
staff. Over time, it becomes nearly impossible to sustain an
effective campaign. Wherever you go, you find yourself answering
questions not so much about guns in the classroom or China in the
World Trade Organization, but money in the bank and ads on the
airwaves.''
</P>
<P>
   But her campaign was beset by other problems, and her candidacy
never gathered steam. Analysts said there was particular
disappointment after she came in a strong third in August in the
Iowa straw poll _ then vanished from public view for a couple of
weeks instead of building her popularity.
</P>
<P>
   Allan J. Lichtman, the chairman of the history department at
American University, said that Mrs. Dole failed to take risks or
set herself apart from her rivals, despite her obvious appeal to
women.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought she had a chance to catch fire and maybe transform
the race,'' he said, ``but she didn't give herself a chance to win.
She didn't do anything to heat things up.''

 &HT;    Magazine perfectly in tune with Fed chief
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Does Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan read
Kiplinger's Personal Finance Magazine (November)?
</P>
<P>
   The Fed chairman warned in a speech last week that the biggest
Y2K risk isn't likely to be the breakdown of computers on Dec. 31
but the potential panic of investors. That's the same message from
Kiplinger's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fear of the computer bug will harm stocks more than the bite
of the bug itself,'' the magazine says. ``Many people worry more
about fellow investors bailing out of the market than about the
computer code.''
</P>
<P>
   Kiplinger's editors offer this advice in reassuring readers that
Y2K won't be a disaster: ``Long-term investors should do nothing,
but people planning to spend some investments early next year might
want to protect themselves from an overreaction.''
</P>
<P>
   A separate, special publication _ Kiplinger's Stocks 2000
(available until February) _ offers some nuts-and-bolts advice on
stock picking, online trading, planning and data on 2,000 stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ONE MORE FOR LIST FREAKS
</P>
<P>
   Forbes (Nov. 1) is out with still another ``best list,'' this
time the 200 ``best small companies in America.'' They are ranked
according to a formula that includes return on equity, sales growth
and profit growth for one-year and five-year periods.
</P>
<P>
   The highest-ranked Georgia company _ sixth place _ is Innotrac,
a Duluth provider of Caller ID and other phone services.
</P>
<P>
   The others, all in Atlanta, are LHS Group, 16th place; Advanced
Technology Products, 26; Profit Recovery Group International, 54;
Theragenics, 117; and Cotton States Life Insurance, 198.
</P>
<P>
   At the top of the list is Cognizant Technology Solutions, a
Teaneck, N.J., software company.
</P>
<P>
   INTERNET TAKES OVER
</P>
<P>
   No topic has dominated the covers of U.S. business publications
in the past year more than the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   This continues with Business Week (Oct. 25), whose cover story
profiles David Wetherell, a veritable evangelist of the Internet as
chief executive officer of a company that owns 11 Internet
companies, has sizable shares of 38 others and has three deals
pending.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine says his company, CMGI, became a hit with investors
``as a kind of Internet mutual fund: a way for investors to buy
into a broad array of Internet companies through just one stock.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortune (Nov. 8) looks at the ``e-volution'' of big business
with a package of articles that concludes that ``the window of
opportunity may be closing on large corporations who haven't yet
adopted e-business strategies.''
</P>
<P>
   Columnist Stewart Alsop says a slew of new companies rushing to
use e-business ``is quickly edging out opportunities for big old
companies who want in on the action.''

GORE TARGETS FATHERS WHO FAIL TO PAY CHILD SUPPORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Al Gore, decrying the steep rate of child poverty
in homes without a father, Wednesday proposed steps to crack down
on ``deadbeat'' dads.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time for fathers to accept their responsibility for their
children,'' Gore said in a visit to Congress Heights Methodist
Church, in the impoverished Anacostia neighborhood of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Gore proposed requiring states, as a condition for receiving
federal child-support funds, to force noncustodial parents to go to
work and pay child support. Those who don't pay would go to jail.
</P>
<P>
   Standing in front of a semicircle of men who are involved in
their children's lives and a mother of two whose former boyfriend
is not, Gore said, ``There are too many absent fathers in our
society today. There are too many mothers who are struggling
because their partners are not helping them as they should.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president announced his proposal to reduce child
poverty a day before his rival for the Democratic presidential
nomination, Bill Bradley, is scheduled to make a long-planned
policy speech on the subject, Wednesday morning at Concord Baptist
Church in Brooklyn, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's aides were guarding closely the content of his speech,
but a spokesman for the former New Jersey senator said, ``A primary
focus will be helping poor people get more money in their pockets
to help their children.''
</P>
<P>
   Eric Hauser, the Bradley spokesman, said: ``Poverty, to
Bradley's mind, is a national moral challenge, and we need a level
of effort to take it on that's equal to the significance of the
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, who has made eradicating child poverty a signature
issue in his campaign, often captivates his audiences with an
anecdote about a child who goes to school hungry one morning
because her family is poor and it wasn't her turn to eat.
</P>
<P>
   A Gore adviser said the vice president has been working for
months on his child-poverty plan and that the announcement a day
before Bradley's speech was ``an accident of timing.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hauser doesn't buy that. ``It's pretty clear that he's
trying to jump the gun on us. This was sort of quickly put
together,'' Hauser said. In his speech Wednesday, Gore said child
poverty is epidemic in female-headed households. ``Children with
absent fathers are five times as likely to live in poverty,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   While most of his ideas were punitive toward deadbeat dads, Gore
said it also is ``important to understand that yes, there are a lot
of deadbeat dads. There are also dead-broke dads, as many as a
quarter of all the fathers who are absent are either young,
struggling fathers in fragile families that have lost their way,
and they really don't have the means to support their children and
they need help.''
</P>
<P>
   His proposal includes allowing states to use federal welfare
money for job-training and job-placement programs to help
impoverished fathers. But these men also would be required to sign
``personal responsibility contracts'' acknowledging paternity,
pledging to work to pay child support, and to be an involved parent
in order to receive aid from the Welfare to Work program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Outside of a genuine religious experience, there is hardly
anything that is more transforming in the life of a man than
getting involved with his children,'' Gore said. ``We need to make
it easier for that to happen.''

 By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Justice Department took extraordinary steps to
enhance the chances of clemency for a group of imprisoned Puerto
Rican nationalists after receiving regular expressions of interest
from the White House, according to documents released Wednesday. In
one instance, the department's top officials repeatedly urged the
prisoners' supporters in Congress to persuade them to fashion a
statement of repentance to help their chances of release.
</P>
<P>
   The documents released at a hearing by the Senate Judiciary
Committee also show that the Puerto Rican nationalists did not
apply for clemency personally, as is usually required, but
department officials processed an application anyway. Under
department regulations, a personal application is usually required
to start the process, because such a move is taken as a sign of
remorse for the criminal acts.
</P>
<P>
   The documents suggest that the prisoners did not apply for
clemency themselves as a symbolic demonstration of their political
credo that they have not accepted the authority of the U.S.
government. Department officials acknowledged in internal memos
that it was highly unusual even to consider clemency in cases in
which the prisoners themselves declined to file their own
applications.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton offered clemency to 16 of the prisoners on
Aug. 11 after supporters applied on their behalf. The prisoners
were convicted of crimes on behalf of the FALN, a militant Puerto
Rican independence group, more than two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   The details and sequence of events leading up to Clinton's
clemency offer have remained murky because the White House and
Justice Department have declined to release much information,
citing executive privilege. Because the Constitution explicitly
gives the president the sole authority to issue pardons,
administration lawyers have argued that the president's discussions
with subordinates over the issue of clemency for the Puerto Rican
prisoners is privileged and need not be disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   But the documents disclosed Wednesday give a partial picture of
the unusual way in which the issue was handled. Applications for
clemency are typically generated when a prisoner presses the issue.
In this case, it appears that the White House and Justice
Department were interested in keeping the issue of clemency alive
even after the department's pardon attorney recommended that
clemency be denied.
</P>
<P>
   A letter in July 1997 from Margaret C. Love, the pardon
attorney, to White House counsel Charles F.C. Ruff showed that she
recommended against clemency. But her successor, Roger Adams, filed
a second report this year that contained no explicit recommendation
for the president, as such reports usually do. but instead offered
Clinton a range of options, law-enforcement officials have said.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's documents show that Adams and Eric Holder, the
deputy attorney general, met with Democratic Reps. Luis Gutierrez
of Illinois, Jose Serrano and Nydia Velasquez, both of New York, on
Nov. 5, 1997, to discuss the case of the Puerto Rican inmates.
According to Adams' notes, Holder told the three members of
Congress that because the prisoners had not applied for clemency
themselves, this could be taken that they were not repentant and he
suggested that a statement expressing some remorse might help their
chances.
</P>
<P>
   On April 9, 1998, according to Adams' notes, he contacted a
staff aide to Gutierrez and said the department had not received
any statement of remorse. The notes show that Adams counseled the
staff aide as to how the statement should be worded for maximum
effect and he added that the department's new report would await
the statement.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the prisoners provided a long ambiguous statement,
with no explicit statement of regret. While some people had been
hurt, the statement said, ``innocent victims were on all sides.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, who is the Judiciary Committee
chairman, also noted that just a month after Clinton's clemency
offer, Attorney General Janet Reno said in a report that the
nationalist groups the prisoners had been aligned with posed an
``ongoing threat'' to national security.
</P>
<P>
   ``Factors which increase the present threat from these groups
include ... the impending release from prisons of members of these
groups jailed for prior violence,'' Reno wrote in the Justice
Department's Five Year Interagency Counterterrorism and Technology
Crime Plan published last month and made public at Wednesday's
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI and the federal prosecutors in Illinois and Connecticut,
where many of the convictions had been obtained, flatly recommended
that the president refuse clemency. After he did so over their
objections, Clinton was widely criticized by law enforcement
groups, families of the victims of some of the crimes committed by
the FALN and both Republican and Democratic members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton denied speculation that he had granted clemency to help
the candidacy of his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, a likely
Democratic candidate for the senate from New York, which has a
large Puerto Rican voting population.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont was the only Democrat to appear at
the hearing. After saying he was disturbed by the decision to grant
clemency but that it was Clinton's prerogative, Leahy departed
leaving the Republicans to take turns grilling the two Justice
Department witnesses, Holder and Adams.

JAPANESE OFFICIAL FORCED TO QUIT OVER REMARKS ON NUCLEAR ARMS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By HOWARD W. FRENCH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ A political furor erupted Wednesday over a senior
Defense Ministry official's proposal that Japan abandon one of its
most hallowed principles: its longtime renunciation of nuclear
weapons. As a result, the official was forced to resign.
</P>
<P>
   In remarks published Tuesday, the deputy vice minister of
defense, Shingo Nishimura, said that since other countries
considered Japan a target, parliament should ``consider the
possibility that Japan would be better off if it armed itself with
nuclear weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nuclear weapons equal deterrence,'' said Nishimura, who
emphasized that he was expressing a personal opinion. ``If there
were no punishments for rape, we would all be rapists. We do not
become rapists because there is the deterrent of punishment.''
</P>
<P>
   The remarks, published in Weekly Playboy, which specializes in
light political commentary, humor and semi-nude portraits of women,
quickly set off an unusually intense round of denunciations.
</P>
<P>
   And Wednesday, Nishimura, a self-styled defense expert and
conservative politician who has called Japan's rearmament his
``life's work,'' was forced to resign his defense post under heavy
pressure from the prime minister's office, which seemed deeply
embarrassed by the comments.
</P>
<P>
   Japan is the only country to have been attacked with nuclear
weapons, and has made banning them a cornerstone of its foreign
policy. And under the constitution imposed by the United States
after World War II, Japan has forsworn ``war as a sovereign right
of the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Interviewed by the daily Asahi Shimbun late Tuesday, before his
resignation, Nishimura seemed to dismiss the idea that either
longstanding policy or the constitution would bar nuclear armament.
``I did not think that the government principles were written in
stone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister's chief Cabinet secretary, Mikio Aoki,
commented, ``Although it is only natural for politicians to have
personal opinions, it is extremely inappropriate for a
parliamentary vice minister to voice them in public, or in an
interview like this.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Japan's Defense Agency, Tatsuhiko Fukui, said
that ``any discussion on nuclear armament is simply impossible,''
adding that officials of his ministry were not authorized to
discuss the topic.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Despite the the government's quick effort to dissociate itself
from the official, the strong reactions by Japan's political
parties made clear that Nishimura's comments had a resonance beyond
the simple matter of a gaffe by an official.
</P>
<P>
   The furor laid bare deep fault lines in the new and politically
shaky coalition government and seemed bound to prematurely trigger
a long-planned parliamentary debate on a revision of Japan's
national defense policies.
</P>
<P>
   Nishimura was appointed earlier this month in a government
shuffle when Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi formed the largest
governing coalition in postwar Japanese history.
</P>
<P>
   Although it has never been directly cited as a platform issue,
it has been said that a principal reason for enlarging the
coalition was to gain passage of legislation to amend the
constitution to allow more leeway in defense.
</P>
<P>
   Public and political support for a more assertive defense stance
has grown sharply in the last two years in response to a missile
test by North Korea that violated Japanese airspace.
</P>
<P>
   One of Obuchi's longstanding coalition partners, the
conservative Liberal Party, led by Ochiro Ozawa, has always made a
strengthening of Japan's defense posture a centerpiece of its
policies.
</P>
<P>
   But the governing Liberal Democratic Party's newest coalition
partner, the loosely Buddhist-affiliated New Komeito Party, has a
longstanding tradition of pacifism. Although the New Komeito has
indicated that it will support a greater Japanese role in
international peacekeeping efforts, it has said nothing in support
of broader military activity by Japan.

THE MORNING AFTER , METS REMEMBER A REMARKABLE SEASON  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
 2TAKES(TRIM)- NYT   By JUDY BATTISTA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Shawon Dunston stood in the middle of the clubhouse
early Wednesday morning, still in uniform after the Mets'
season-ending loss to the Braves, his head down. He could not look
everyone in the eye, Dunston said later, but he wanted to tell the
team he reluctantly joined at the trading deadline one thing before
he headed home.
</P>
<P>
   ``That I was proud to be a Met,'' said Dunston, who created one
of the signature moments of the this series when he ended a
12-pitch, 9-minute at-bat with a single that began the Mets' rally
in the 15th inning of the Game 5 victory. ``They're all
professionals. They had to know that. It was nice being here. I
hope I stay here. It's very first class. I met a lot of nice
people. hen I retire in three years or five years, I'll take that
with me.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the valedictory of a man who had to be convinced by his
wife and parents to join his hometown team after he was traded in
late July against his wishes. If there was some scattered sadness
in the clubhouse after the bittersweet ending to the Mets'
captivating season _ the banged and bruised Mike Piazza seemed
mentally and physically spent and Bobby Valentine, befitting his
intense personality, looked inconsolable _ the rest of the Mets
seemed to appreciate just how magnificent their last few weeks had
been.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few of us on the way stopped in the video room to make sure
we get a copy of the last two games,'' Darryl Hamilton said. ``We
could get old and gray and still watch those games.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday afternoon, about half the team came home to Shea
Stadium to pile personal belongings into garbage bags and boxes and
head off to a winter of wondering what if. It was as if Game 6 of
the National League Championship Series was scripted to embody, in
11 innings, all that the Mets had endured for the last month _ the
failings and recoveries and, ultimately, the heartache of a near
miss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking, `We're going to play the Yankees,''' Dunston
said. ``The little kid came back to me. I was so excited. I was
like a kid in high school and like in high school, I always miss
the championship game.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the Mets were spent from fighting for almost every
victory in a harrowing and exuberant four weeks. When Kenny Rogers
walked in the game-winning run in the 11th inning, the Mets went
down quietly for perhaps the only time all season, which might
explain why, after the initial devastation of the loss, this was no
morose clubhouse, with no tears and with more than a few hugs and
pats on the back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they should hold the heads up high,'' Valentine said.
``It may leave a void, but they should have a feeling of a job well
done. There's not even a question it's the best group I've ever
had. Let's not say it was always perfect, but the majority ruled
here and the majority was very good.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as the Mets reflected on the burnished finale to the
season, they, inevitably had to look forward, too. For all the
millions of dollars spent to improve this team _ for the enormous
contracts given to Al Leiter, Mike Piazza and Robin Ventura last
year _ the Mets challenged the Braves enough to make most games
close, but they are still not complete enough to beat them
consistently. So, with the obstacle not yet overcome, the Mets head
into the winter with a few large questions still looming.
</P>
<P>
   What is Valentine's fate? The frequently embattled, always
compelling manager has received several high-profile votes of
confidence from the Mets' co-owner, Fred Wilpon. But a recent
magazine article suggested that Valentine's wife was trying to
convince him not to return and that his friends would be shocked if
he came back. It is hard to imagine a man as competitive as
Valentine walking away from a team as good as this one. But his
reluctance to answer directly the question of whether he will
return will leave the story floating for weeks, which is probably
just what Valentine wants, in the hope that he will be offered a
contract extension before he begins the final year of his deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a contract for next year,'' Valentine said after the
game. ``I can't wait to come back.'' Wednesday, pressed for a
clarification, Valentine said of his chances to return: ``Why
wouldn't I? I don't want to talk about it. It gives credence to
ridiculous thoughts.''
</P>
<P>
   Will first baseman John Olerud, who is eligible for free agency,
re-sign with the Mets? The team certainly hopes so, and _ as they
did with Leiter and Piazza last season _ they'd like to wrap it up
quickly. ``We've made it clear we want to bring him back, and we'll
move aggressively to do that,'' General Manager Steve Phillips
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Olerud, who took a pay cut to sign his two-year, $8 million
deal, may not be in such a rush. He said after the game that he
wants to talk to his wife, Kelly, before deciding what to do and he
was noncommital about whether he wants to return to New York, or
possibly return to his home state and play for Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've both had a great time in the city,'' Olerud said. ``It's
been a great experience for us. It's a big decision. It's something
I'm going to talk about. It's what's best for my family.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens with Olerud, one thing is certain: Piazza,
banged up as he is, will be the catcher next season, even if an
eventual move to a less jarring position would protect his
offensive production.
</P>
<P>
   Wither Rickey Henderson? The phenomenal age-resistant leadoff
man put up great numbers for the Mets this season, batting .314 and
stealing 37 bases. But there were startling lapses in his hustle in
the field and around the bases. Although the team holds an option,
which vested when he made his 500th plate appearance in the waning
days of the regular season, that would pay him $2 million next
season, Henderson says he wants more money. ``If they want me to be
here, I want to be here,'' Henderson said. ``I want to be paid what
I mean to the club. I probably meant more to the club this season
that what I signed for.''
</P>
<P>
   Will Henderson come along quietly? ``I'm not worried about
that,'' Phillips said, chuckling.
</P>
<P>
   Will the Mets have any interest in re-signing Rogers, in light
of the calamity of Game 6? Does Melvin Mora _ ``Who is this guy?''
NBC's Joe Morgan said in wonder during Game 6 _ get a shot at a
starting job next season based on his dazzling performance in the
playoffs?
</P>
<P>
   What about the loose ends?
</P>
<P>
   Orel Hershiser, according to some reports, is considering a
career switch to coaching, and he has reportedly had contact with
the Cleveland Indians. But Hershiser was a valuable presence in the
clubhouse, particularly as an elder statesman among pitchers and
became, in effect, a part-time coach to Valentine.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Bonilla, and his $5.9 million salary, are almost certain
to be gone next year in some fashion, with the Mets probably having
to eat a large part of his contract. He and Valentine clearly can
not exist together. When Valentine left the clubhouse in Atlanta at
1:50 a.m. Wednesday after the game, he walked right past Bonilla
without saying a word.

NEW YORK: a word.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Valentine seemed to take the loss the hardest of anyone in the
organization, perhaps because he has been on the firing line with
regularity. It seems, in retrospect, as if the season could not
possibly have been long enough to contain all the events that
occurred within it, many of them involving the manager.
</P>
<P>
   An early eight-game losing streak, the firing of three coaches,
Valentine's near brawl with Bonilla, a surge in the second half, a
seven-game losing streak that nearly cost the Mets a trip to the
post-season, a four-game span where the Mets fought off elimination
every day, Valentine, in late September, musing that he might be
fired, a one-game playoff to clinch the wild-card berth, the
manager opining that his players weren't very smart, and then a
recovery from losing the first three playoff games to the Braves to
fashion one of the most compelling post-season series in memory.
</P>
<P>
   If Valentine looked heartbroken afterward _ until the rookie
Octavio Dotel walked into his office for a hug and a few words from
Valentine, reminding him that he was only at the beginning of what
promises to be a successful career _ then his players seemed to
have come around, at least a bit, to Piazza's way of thinking.
Before the series began, Piazza said that anything that happened
would be gravy, considering where the Mets had come from in recent
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   One large group of players, that included several relief
pitchers, pulled the folding chairs that sit in front of each
locker into a circle and sipped beer together. ``It was a great
season,'' one said, to nobody in particular. Who could argue?

   The Mets' sick ward is overflowing. The following players will
have magnetic resonance imaging tests either Thursday or Friday:
Robin Ventura (left knee), Darryl Hamilton (left knee), Edgardo
Alfonzo (right knee), Al Leiter (left knee), John Franco (right
knee) and Benny Agbayani (left elbow). Billy Taylor will have left
knee surgery and Armando Benitez's left ankle will also be looked
at. ... Mike Piazza was taken out of Game 6 because, Bobby
Valentine said, his right shoulder was causing him pain and it was
affecting his ability to throw.

AFTER ASSAILING `SOFT MONEY,'' KERRY WILL RAISE IT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Brimming with indignation, Senator John F. Kerry
this week clamored on the Senate floor for an end to ``soft
money,'' warning that the large, unregulated contributions are
poisoning the nation's politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you know where it comes from?'' Kerry asked Tuesday,
standing at his mahogany desk in the Senate chamber. ``It comes
from U.S. senators who are passing legislation, making telephone
calls or having meetings with high-powered corporate types or very
rich people who write checks for $50,000, $100,000, $250,000 and
$300,000.''
</P>
<P>
   And just because Democrats sometimes have exploited the
``soft-money'' loophole in federal election laws better than
Republicans, Kerry said, ``It doesn't make it right.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, Kerry is scheduled to host a private
fund-raiser at his townhouse in Washington's Georgetown section
that is expected to generate $250,000 for the Democratic Party _ in
soft money.
</P>
<P>
   As he planned to fuel the multimillion-dollar, soft-money
machine he has railed against, Kerry Wednesday drew scorn from his
Republican foes and varied measures of support from his allies in
the stymied effort to revamp the nation's campaign finance system.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry's fund-raiser, highlighted by an appearance by President
Clinton, comes two days after Senate Republicans killed two
campaign-finance measures that Kerry supported, both of which
called for banning soft money.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Senator Kerry was truly committed to ridding the system of
soft money, he would cancel his fund-raiser,'' said state
Representative Brian Cresta of Wakefield, chairman of the state
Republican Party. ``It's another proof that he is the do-as-I-say
senator and not the do-as-I-do senator, and he just can't be
trusted.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerry, who developed a formidable fund-raising network as a
former chief of the Senate Democratic election effort, is an
honorary chairman of the Democratic National Committee's elite
Leadership 2000 group of donors who have pledged to raise $350,000
in soft money for the fight to hold the White House and gain power
in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   His spokesman, David Wade, defended Kerry's pursuit of soft
money while trying to ban it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, under the current system, Democrats have to
fund-raise just to remain competitive, and we simply cannot disarm
unilaterally,'' Wade said. ``Throughout his public life, John Kerry
has tried to reform the campaign finance system, and he thinks it's
time right now to elect Democrats to Congress who are going to pass
campaign finance reform.''
</P>
<P>
   A short motorcade ride from Kerry's event, Clinton also will
attend a fund-raiser Wednesday night at Senator Edward M. Kennedy's
Washington home near Embassy Row. Kennedy expects 350 guests to
contribute about $400,000 for his reelection campaign, none of it
in soft money.
</P>
<P>
   Federal election law limits the amount individuals may
contribute to a specific candidate to $2,000 per election cycle.
But there are no caps on soft-money donations to political parties
from corporations, labor unions and wealthy individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry's fund-raiser will be more intimate than Kennedy's, with
about 25 donors from the high-tech industry each contributing at
least $10,000 to the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Both poliical parties are scrambling to cash in on the
burgeoning wealth among leaders of the high-tech industry. The soft
money he hopes to raise is expected to be earmarked for party
building endeavors such as voter registration drives.
</P>
<P>
   Although some election watchdog groups questioned the timing of
Kerry's soft-money fund-raiser so soon after the Senate showdown on
campaign finance, advocates for overhauling the system generally
expressed support for Kerry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soft money is bad,'' said David Donnelly, executive director
of Massachusetts Voters for Clean Elections. ``But reform groups
measure senators and representatives on their support of campaign
finance reform, and Senator Kerry is about as good as they get.
Unfortunately, he has to play in this system, but it's the only
system we've got.''

 &HT;    Slump in paper prices at fault for slow sales, Mead says
 &HT;    By Laura A. Bischoff
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Mead Corp. blamed a dip in third-quarter sales on
a continued slump in paper prices, the struggling School and Office
Products Division and operational trouble in its Stevenson, Ala.,
mill.
</P>
<P>
   Mead reported Wednesday third-quarter sales of $982.2 million,
down from $1.01 billion for the same period last year. Earnings,
excluding special items, were $49.1 million, or 46 cents per share,
down slightly from $49.4 million, or 47 cents per share, for the
same period last year. The analysts' consensus estimate was 46
cents per share, based on 13 estimates, according to First
Call/Thomson Financial, an analysts monitoring service.
</P>
<P>
   For the first nine months of the year, Mead's sales were $2.85
billion, down slightly over $2.9 billion for the same period in
1998. Earnings, excluding special items, for the first nine months
of 1999 were $126.8 million, or $1.20 per share, compared with
$146.1 million, or $1.39 per share, for the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the third quarter, coated paper prices declined, impacting
our largest segment. However, as the fourth quarter begins, we
anticipate some price improvement,'' said Mead Chairman, President
and Chief Executive Jerry Tatar. ``When combined with ongoing
productivity efforts and continued market improvement in other
segments, we are becoming more optimistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Third-quarter earnings in the paper division dropped 24 percent
to $42.2 million while sales dipped only 1 percent. Excluding
special items, earnings in the packaging and paperboard segment
slipped 11 percent to $41.4 million while sales were $389 million,
up $1 million over the same period last year. Tatar said
technicians are still trying to solve problems with a new machine
at the Stevenson mill _ difficulties that have been hurting Mead
for about three quarters.
</P>
<P>
   In the high-profile School and Office Products Division,
third-quarter earnings dropped 30.5 percent to $9.1 million while
sales dipped 14 percent to $146 million. Mead officials are hoping
to turn sales and earnings around with new licensing agreements and
the purchase of AT-A-GLANCE Group, a calendar and planner maker
based in upstate New York. The division also signed new licensing
agreements with Nike Inc. and M&AMP;M/Mars to feature their brands on
Mead products.
</P>
<P>
   Mead stock (NYSE:MEA) closed Wednesday at 33 7/8, up 7/8.

   NCR registers solid third-quarter report
</P>
<P>
   By Laura A. Bischoff
</P>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ NCR Corp. more than doubled its third-quarter
earnings to $53 million, or 53 cents per share, easily exceeding
analysts' estimates, company officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Boosting the earnings were a number of real estate sales and
one-time gains. Without those special items, earnings from
operating income was 44 cents per share _ still 3 cents ahead of
the analysts consensus estimate of 41 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
   NCR saw strong growth in its retail store automation and
automatic teller machine businesses, said NCR Chairman and Chief
Executive Lars Nyberg.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are seeing market confirmation that our strategy and
emphasis on data warehousing is the right one, although we continue
to face challenges for our data warehousing solutions in the
financial industry,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that the data warehouses _ huge computers that track
vast amounts of information _ are selling well in the airline,
retail and telecommunications industries.
</P>
<P>
   Overall sales were down 2 percent _ a decline NCR attributes to
it getting out of the computer hardware commodity market.
Third-quarter sales this year were $1.53 billon compared with $1.55
billion for the same period last year. For the first nine months of
the year, sales were $4.435 billion compared with $4.438 for the
same period last year.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of retail automation systems in the third quarter
increased 32 percent to $253 million, while ATM and related
services sales increased 10 percent to $280 million. Data
warehousing sales fell 4 percent to $180 million and customer
services maintenance fell 8 percent to $427 million.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Financial Officer David Bearman told Wall Street stock
analysts Wednesday that NCR's key businesses are healthy and data
warehousing is looking promising.
</P>
<P>
   He told analysts that NCR is expecting to sign up new data
warehousing customers in the fourth quarter and revenues will show
healthy increases over last year, but that retail store automation
and financial self service revenues may decline over last year's
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   NCR officials will hold another conference call on Tuesday to
discuss the company's long-term strategies.
</P>
<P>
   NCR's stock (NYSE:NCR) closed on Wednesday at 28, up 1 1/4 on a
volume of 1,396,000.

LAUDING NIGERIA, ALBRIGHT VOWS INCREASE IN AID 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By NORIMITSU ONISHI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABUJA, Nigeria _ Secretary of State Madeleine Albright praised
the five-month-old democratic government of Nigeria Wednesday and
pledged more financial support for the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Albright, who is on a weeklong visit to Africa, said Nigeria was
undergoing a historic transformation that could potentially rank
alongside ``the Czechoslovak Velvet Revolution and South Africa's
long walk to freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States, she said, will try to ensure that democratic
change continues in Nigeria, which has emerged from 16 years of
military rule. She proposed raising aid to the country threefold or
fourfold from its current level of $27 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria is Africa's most populous country and supplies 8 percent
of America's oil.
</P>
<P>
   Early this week, President Clinton vetoed a $12.6 billion
foreign aid bill passed by the Republican-led House. The amount was
$2 billion less than the president requested.
</P>
<P>
   In her tour so far of Africa, Albright has also pledged $55
million in aid to Sierra Leone, where an agreement has been signed
to end an eight-year-old civil war. The Clinton administration has
been accused of neglecting Africa while responding quickly to
Kosovo and East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   Albright arrived here late Tuesday and held a two-hour meeting
with President Olusegun Obasanjo, who is to visit the White House
next week.
</P>
<P>
   A State Department official who attended the meeting said
Obasanjo pledged to pursue an aggressive campaign against
corruption no matter ``whose goat is gored.'' Cronies of the late
dictator Gen. Sani Abacha are already targets of the anticorruption
drive.
</P>
<P>
   Obasanjo also said he expected a ``democracy dividend'' in the
form of debt relief, according to the State Department official.
Nigeria's shaky economy cannot get back on its feet and its leaders
will find it hard to sustain democracy if the country has to spend
more than 30 percent of its export revenues to service its $30
billion debt, the official reported him as saying.
</P>
<P>
   The Obasanjo government has ``already done much to restore
Nigeria's democratic institutions,'' Albright said in a speech here
to a West African economic organization. But she said the
government still needed to repeal repressive laws and to reform its
judiciary and military fully.

EARLY SUPPORT WANED IN NEW HAMPSHIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ She arrived like a phenom last February,
before a capacity crowd of more than a thousand people at the
Greater Manchester Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Dole's reception on that blustery day in the first
primary state turned out to be the high point of her campaigning
here.
</P>
<P>
   Almost everything after that seemed a struggle _ to fill chairs,
to convey a message, to emerge as a first-tier candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``She burst on the scene kind of like a supernova,'' said Thomas
D. Rath, an activist who is backing Texas Governor George W. Bush.
``That . . . attraction is hard to maintain.''
</P>
<P>
   By summer, Dole's visits to New Hampshire had lost a lot of that
early energy. Dole swung by the Manchester Rotary Club in August,
days after a strong finish in the Iowa straw poll. At the Chateau
Restaurant, Dole arrived late, spoke briefly, took three questions
and then rushed out without spending the 15 minutes it would have
taken to shake hands with the 60 people there.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to look them in the eye, you've got to shake their
hand and answer some of their tough questions,'' said Beverly
Rodeschin, the Republican chairwoman of Sullivan County. ``People,
if they take the time to come out and see the candidate, they
expect that handshake.''
</P>
<P>
   If Dole seemed nervous about mixing it up with the voters, she
also seemed to avoid attention-getting positions on the issues. One
exception centered on a sensitive topic: guns. At a kickoff dinner
in May, she waded into the subject before a conservative,
right-to-bear-arms crowd. Silence greeted her call for stricter gun
controls.
</P>
<P>
   ``When she came out and said what she did on firearms, it didn't
set well with a lot of the sportsmen around here,'' Rodeschin said.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to take on the gun lobby was also a surprise to
some of her core supporters in New Hampshire. At a private meeting
in Concord on the morning after her talk, Dole apologized for
springing the subject without running it by her key backers first.
</P>
<P>
   That was not good enough for State Representative Fran Wendleboe
of New Hampton. She quit the Dole team and headed to Dan Quayle.
</P>
<P>
   One thing Dole did do well was to attract people who had not
been involved in politics before. Her crowds were predominantly
women; oftentimes they were mothers who had brought their young
daughters to take a look at the first woman to mount a credible
major party campaign for president.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Smith, director of the University of New Hampshire survey
center, asked voters who supported Dole where they would go if she
had not been in the race. Sixty-eight percent said they would
support Bush, and 9 percent said they would go to John McCain of
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Still, not everyone believes these newcomers will stick around
to vote on primary day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of these folks turned out because of Elizabeth
Dole, and I don't think they will necessarily translate to another
race,'' said Sherry Young, a Concord lawyer and a member of Dole's
New Hampshire leadership team.
</P>
<P>
   Gus Fromuth, a Manchester businessman, recalled the hoopla
surrounding Dole's first foray into the state last winter. He and
his wife attended the Chamber of Commerce dinner, eager to hear the
former Red Cross director speak.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt it was the most exciting potential entrance into the
race,'' he said. ``She had high, high, high _ way up in the charts
_ she had mountains of opportunity to work with. It was all at her
feet how to exploit it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hal Eckman, the chief executive officer of Eckman Construction
in Bedford, was also at the dinner with his wife. ``We were excited
about her and anxious to hear her speak,'' he said. ``I think a lot
of people were.''
</P>
<P>
   And nothing happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a drought,'' said Fromuth, who serves as finance
chairman for the state Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   Dole had a limited campaign organization and no adequate way to
capitalize on the enthusiasm of the people who wanted to help her.
</P>
<P>
   ``If she had played her cards right, she could have given
everyone in the party a real pasting,'' Fromuth said. ``When you
bring her name up now, more people shake their heads.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Dole brought in Jesse Devitte, an entrepreneur and
chairman of the New Hampshire Software Association, to run her New
Hampshire campaign. The organization never took off, and Devitte
was stymied in his ability to force her Washington office to make
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it was any different than any state campaign has
with a national organization,'' said Devitte, who is being courted
by the other campaigns. ``The issue we had was, I wanted her here
more, I couldn't get her.''

</P>
<P>
   &UR; FEATURE story &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SOBEL-ISRAEL-THEATER (Jerusalem) _ The Israeli theater writer,
Yehoshua Sobol, 60, a former director of the Haifa Theater, looks
back on an earlier era of theater in Israel. His plays includes ``A
Palestinian Girl'' and ``The Jerusalem Syndrome.'' Today he is
concerned that a depressing commercialism has overtaken the Israeli
theatrical scene. By Deborah Sontag. (Moved). Photo.

<P>
   &UR; FILM AND VIDEO &LR;
</P>
<P>
   JOAN-OF-ARC-VIDEO (Undated) _ No particular reason comes to
mind, but on film and video there is a resurgent call for the
French peasant girl with, in the words of one critic in 1929, ``a
face supernaturally illumined by faith, with lips parched through
excitement and with a pair of eyes that see Heaven opening before
them.'' This is how he described the uplifted visage of Maria
(sometimes called Renee) Falconetti as Joan of Arc in Carl Theodor
Dreyer's silent classic ``The Passion of Saint Joan,'' released in
1928 and by far the most interesting of three titles about the Maid
of Orleans to be seen this fall. ``The Passion'' is to be released
on tape by Home Vision and on a fine DVD from the Criterion
Collection on Nov. 9. By Peter M. Nichols. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   CRAVEN-FILMS (Undated) _ From his cringingly inexpert yet
profitable debut with ``The Last House on the Left'' (1972), the
story of a Manson-like family of killers and the vengeance that is
wreaked upon them, through the imaginatively sinister and
profitable ``A Nightmare on Elm Street'' (1984), which established
the teen-age horror movie genre, and on to the witty and profitable
``Scream'' (1996) and ``Scream 2'' (1997), the second amusingly
deconstructing the first, Wes Craven could always be counted on to
spill an audience-pleasing ocean of blood. This was a source of no
small amount of frustration for him over the years, as producers
and studios ruled him out of consideration for projects merely
because of the images his name conjured up. But fortunately for
him, the success that so long pigeonholed him eventually sprang
him. Craven's new movie, ``Music of the Heart,'' which opens
Friday, stars Ms. Meryl Streep as a music teacher in East Harlem.
It is based on a true story, is chock-full of feet-on-the-ground
characters and has heart and grit and genuine warmth. By Jame
Malanowski. (Moved). Photo.

   &UR; THEATER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   DAME-EDNA-THEATER (New York) _ Dame Edna Everage, the Melbourne
housewife, social anthropologist, talk-show host, investigative
journalist and self-styled megastar, has clearly outgrown the
control of her mentor, Barry Humphries. He's the Australian wizard
who, as a young actor and writer, created the character for a
Melbourne revue in 1955 and has been at her side ever since. The
extent to which this gloriously opinionated, mauve-haired golem has
taken over Humphries is now nakedly apparent in ``Dame Edna: The
Royal Tour'' at the Booth Theater on Broadway. By Vincent Canby.

<P>
   &UR; DANCE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MONTALVO-DANCE (Creteil, France) _ With close to 20 years'
experience as a choreographer, Jose Montalvo is hardly a novice,
yet for a long time this tall simpatico Frenchman of Spanish
descent was known _ when he was known at all _ as a peripheral
artist more interested in experimentation than fame. Then he
created ``Paradis,'' a delightful multimedia, multicultural collage
of a work. After that, everything was different. Since its premiere
in March 1997, ``Paradis'' has been performed almost 200 times _
that's about once every four days _ in France and on tour in
Europe, the Far East and Latin America. Now the 60-minute work is
traveling to New York for eight performances at the Joyce Theater
starting on Tuesday as part of the New Europe '99 Festival. By Alan
Riding. (Moved).
 &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CLASSICAL MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   TENORS-MUSIC (Undated) _ For a generation Luciano Pavarotti
thrilled and amused us; Placido Domingo evoked undying admiration.
Jose Carreras gave us early hope, but unwise career decisions,
choices made long before a serious and unrelated illness, left him
with fame, money and a ravaged voice. Opera in general sharpens our
nerve endings, sometimes to the point of hysteria. Tenors, for
better and worse, drive us crazy. We need a couple of big ones. So
audiences and a music business operatives are now taking a hard
look at three new tenors, Roberto Alagna of Italy, Marcelo Alvarez
and, most recently, Jose Cura, both from Argentina. By Bernard
Holland. (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   SYMPHONIC-ORGAN (Paris) _ Anyone familiar with organ music would
recognize the name. Aristide Cavaille-Coll (pronounced
cah-vah-yea-COLL) developed the ``symphonic'' organ in France and
died 100 years ago this month. The instruments he left behind could
fill vast spaces with sound as varied and powerful as a symphony
orchestra's, and they inspired composers from Cesar Franck, Camille
Saint-Saens, Charles-Marie Widor and Louis Vierne to Marcel Dupre
and Olivier Messiaen to play and write a dramatically expressive
kind of music for the instrument that pipe organs had never been

   HOME-STUDIOS-RECORDINGS (subslug) (Undated) _ Since 1991, F.M.
Cornog in an upstairs room of his Summit N.J., home, has been
writing songs, recording them and releasing them under the moniker
East River Pipe. Every day, instead of going to work in an office
or factory, or, for that matter, a recording studio _ he goes to
this room and fiddles around and lays down ideas until he has
enough material for an album. East River Pipe's fourth and most
recent album, ``The Gasoline Age,'' released on the independent
label Merge, is a dreamy, Springsteenish meditation on suburban car
culture. By Karen Schoemer. (Moved). Photo.

   ISRAEL-MUSEUM (Jerusalem) _ It is never easy building a major
art museum from scratch, but Teddy Kollek, the former mayor of
Jerusalem, has good reason to crow. In less than four decades, he
has seen the Israel Museum evolve from an improbable fantasy into a
world-class institution whose collection now consists of some
500,000 objects _ roughly five times as many as the National
Gallery of Art in Washington. By Deborah Solomon. (Moved). Photo.

<P>
   MEXICO-POTTERS (Undated) _ Over the last 400 years, the
innovative potters of Puebla, a town east of Mexico City, have done
what potters do best: they have taken dazzling designs from the
ceramics of other cultures and reproduced them. Then, to mark them
as Mexican, they have added images of a cactus here, a parrot
there. The story of how Spanish potters succeeded in transforming
the traditional terra cotta ceramics in Mexico is the little known
story that is revealed in ``Talavera Poblana: Four Centuries of a
Mexican Ceramic Tradition,'' an exhibition at the Americas Society
Art Gallery, in Manhattan, through Dec. 12. By Rita Reif. (Moved).

<P>
   SENSATION-ART (New York) _ New art has rarely had as many
reluctant champions as ``Sensation,'' the exhibition of work by
young English artists from the collection of Charles Saatchi, the
English advertising executive, at the Brooklyn Museum of Art.
People both inside and outside the art world have been defending to
the death the exhibition's right to be seen in a public museum,
while turning up their noses at the art it contains or dismissing
it wholesale. By Roberta Smith. (Moved).

   TSCHUMI-ARCH (New York) _ Alfred Lerner Hall, the new student
center at Columbia University, will plunge some baby boomer alumni
into a cool nostalgic bath. The architect, Bernard Tschumi, has
long made a touchstone of the events of 68: the student uprisings
that for many epitomize the turmoil of the 1960s. Columbia
University's architecture school was one of the epicenters of those
events. Today, the school is run by Tschumi, an architect whose
sensibility was formed by the Paris edition of those
demonstrations. No practicing architect of his generation has
identified himself more closely with the anarchic energies of that
era. By Herbert Muschamp. (Moved).

   CORWIN-RADIO (Undated) _ For more than 60 years, Norman Corwin's
radio dramas about the human condition and the state of the planet
_ America, in particular _ have helped shape the public perception
of who we are and what we're doing here. Through war and peace,
Corwin opened his microphone to big thoughts and the common man:
freedom, loyalty, courage, fear, despair, triumph. For nine years
at CBS _ 1938 to 1947 _ he presided over national catharsis at the
radio console. And now, with the last 1,000 years to look back on,
Corwin has come up with ``Memos to a New Millennium,'' a half-hour
script he calls a meditation for radio. Underwritten by the
Corporation for Public Broadcasting, it will be distributed
nationally at year's end by Public Radio International. By Charles

GEN X VOLUNTEERS, DOESN'T VOTE: ONETIME `SLACKERS' STILL
DISILLUSIONED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By YOJI COLE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   We Americans love our traditions: baseball, the Fourth of July,
hot dogs, apple pie, jeans and voting.
</P>
<P>
   Well, we're not exactly in love with voting, or maybe we are and
that's why we ignore it.
</P>
<P>
   Voting continues to be a right that only Americans older than 35
show interest in, and somehow members of that group, now parents
and grandparents, aren't passing on the practice to their youth.
</P>
<P>
   Americans who are ages 18 to 35, Generation X, who were once
thought of as the slacker generation, indeed slack at one duty _
voting.
</P>
<P>
   No longer a glut of sniveling teens, Gen Xers are graduating
with degrees, getting hitched, buying homes, setting up 401(k)
plans and investing in the latest Internet company, which they are
probably running.
</P>
<P>
   However, even with all that adult responsibility, you can bet
that more Xers across the nation stood in lines to see ``The Blair
Witch Project'' than those who stood in lines to vote in the
September elections.Is it apathy?
</P>
<P>
   ``Politicians rant and rave about change, but when they get
elected, nothing happens,'' said Michael Growe, 32.
</P>
<P>
   A medical technician at a Scottsdale, Ariz., clinic, Growe did
not vote in September. He feels the winds of political change are
interest groups' hot air.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all the lobbyists pushing their views, a single vote
won't count,'' Growe said.
</P>
<P>
   However, he forgets the adage that Heather Locklear made famous
in her Faberge Organic Shampoo ad: ``You tell your friends and
they'll tell their friends and their friends will tell their
friends,'' so on and so forth. One vote produces many.
</P>
<P>
   Locally, since 1994, all voter turnout in the county's bi-yearly
elections has languished below 20 precent, according to the
Elections Department. And Generation X is the most lackluster group
in terms of voting.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the trend is also daunting. According to the Census
Bureau, in 1996 only 39 percent of people ages 18 to 34 cast
ballots for a presidential candidate. That compares with 60 percent
of baby boomers, people ages 35 to 64.
</P>
<P>
   Generation X's professors warn that issues demanding their
attention exist now. They point out that the political system is a
back-scratching affair between voters and candidates. Apathy is a
detriment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until younger folks get involved, no attention will get paid
to issues that hurt them,'' said Kenneth Goldstein, a
political-science professor at Arizona State University.
</P>
<P>
   X-ers need to march up the steps of their capitols and down the
D.C. Beltway, trumpeting issues such as Social Security and
Medicare reform, public versus private education, and environmental
issues, Goldstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Boomers are spanking X-ers at the polls in regards to those
issues being addressed for the future of the younger generation.
</P>
<P>
   So, is the Gen-X cohort too self-involved to care?
</P>
<P>
   Studies indicate that members of Gen-X are more likely to
volunteer than to vote. According to the 1997 Survey of Public
Participation in the Arts, among people polled about their
volunteer efforts in 1996, 35 percent of Americans ages 18 to 24
participated in ``charity work,'' and 41 percent of those ages 25
to 34 did. Only 39 percent of people ages 18 to 34 voted that same
year, a presidential election year.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Solop, a professor at Northern Arizona University in
Flagstaff who teaches a course in political participation, said his
students are aware of issues, but they feel the odds of achieving
anything are insurmountable.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are concerned with whether they (people 18 to 34 years
old) will have access to training and education programs,
insurance, adequate health care, environmental issues,'' Solop
said. ``(But) there is a sense of despair, that they can't be
effective.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Klain, a Scottsdale, Ariz., attorney, feels that despair.
He is registered to vote but hasn't cast a ballot since the 1996
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   Klain, 30, still considers himself to be concerned, civically
involved. He pays close attention to a range of issues from
education to Supreme Court vacancies to tax and Social Security
reform.
</P>
<P>
   However, ``I'm not real big on voting,'' Klain, said. ``I've
become disillusioned with the two-party system, and I get a feeling
of futility.''
</P>
<P>
   To understand the system and the issues, one must be attentive
to it. Inattentiveness is a sign of a generation reared on
entertainment, said Tom &UR; Keating, a political-science professor at
ASU.
</P>
<P>
   From television to books, everything is flashy, shocking, bright
and exciting. Keating, a boomer in his 50s, noted the stark
difference between the text-only books he read as an undergrad and
the books he teaches from.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now (books come with) four or five colors, cartoons and all
kinds of much more flashy stuff,'' Keating said.
</P>
<P>
   He concedes that some students are cognizant of the issues, but
that many lack the attention span to follow them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless you grab their interest in a class discussion early,
they're gone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Keating also attributes the lack of interest to the media's
portrayal of election campaigns. People such as Growe and Klain
believe candidates fudge on campaign promises because TV and print
reporters focus their coverage on interpreting what the candidates
mean, rather than on the simple facts of what the candidates say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the new biography of Reagan, where the author
injects himself,'' Keating said. ``The reporter judges the validity
of the candidate when there is no evidence that the reporter has
the authority to do so. Actually, candidates try to fulfill their
campaign promises at a high rate.''
</P>
<P>
   One political campaign that recently grabbed the attention of
Gen-X-ers was Jesse Ventura's run for governor of Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura, a former World Wrestling Federation character, was
ushered into Minnesota's governorship on the backs of ballots cast
by young people. Among the youngest voters casting ballots _ those
younger than age 30 _ Ventura got nearly half of those votes,
according to an exit poll conducted for the ``Minneapolis'' ``Star
Tribune'' by Voter News Service among 1,449 voters statewide.
</P>
<P>
   The point was made: When moved to vote, Gen-X is a force worth
reckoning with, but what is daunting is that it takes a former TV
personality to arouse them.
</P>
<P>
   The generation's boredom with politics is evident in college
political-science classes across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Freshmen interest in keeping up to date with politics is now
less than half of what it was in 1966, then 58 percent, according
to the American Political Science Association.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, President Kennedy had been assassinated, the
civil-rights movement was burning throughout America, and the
country's involvement in Vietnam was escalating. Still, somehow
that politically involved 58 percent has not been able to inspire
its offspring into political action.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s, freshmen interest in keeping up with political
affairs has dropped from 42 percent in 1990 to its present record
low of 26 percent, AMPSA statistics indicate.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Kissell, 22, summed up Generation X's disillusionment by
saying, ``I don't have a lot of faith in political campaigns, and
you don't vote for the lesser of two evils.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to the void of indifference, the National Council of
State Legislators has passed a resolution calling for education on
representative democracy, and the National Association of
Secretaries of State devoted its 1999 meeting to considering ways
to encourage young Americans to pay attention to politics and to
become voters.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona Secretary of State Office mails a greeting card to
teens on their 18th birthdays, reminding them to register. The
office also provides voter registration over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young people are used to using the Internet, and they can
register through the Internet,'' said Jessica Funkhouser, elections
director for the Secretary of State Office. ``We're trying to
connote turning 18 with being able to vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Secretary of State's elections department reports
that Internet registration is catching on, it hasn't translated
into a greater number of voters, especially among the young.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, maybe the Internet informed are too young yet to
vote and are fixed in a political eddy waiting for their wind of
change at 18.
</P>
<P>
   Zaira Balmaceda, 16, a Phoenix-area high school student,
provides a positive outlook for Generation Y, or the millennials,
Generation X's younger counterpart.
</P>
<P>
   Balmaceda, who said that politics is not a regular subject in
her house, still relishes a desire to back issues and choose a
candidate sans singlets. She also, believe it or not, reads the
newspaper to keep up on the issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always reading the newspaper to see what's going on and
listening to the news,'' Balmaceda said. ``These (politicians) are
the people who are going to be deciding the future in our
community.'' &QL;

   Here are Anne Stephenson's capsule reviews of new books.
</P>
<P>
   ``THE POP-UP BOOK OF PHOBIAS'' &QL; 
By Gary Greenberg (Morrow, $24.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We heard about this one before we saw it, and that's always a
good sign. It has been New &AMP; Notable's policy to mock pop-up books
on the grounds that they are both silly and oxymoronic _ something
can't pop up and be a book at the same time. We prefer to think of
them as ````gadgets''.'' The last one we paid any attention to was
about golf courses, and it might have been the nadir of pop-up
books _ little greens rising at you like some dopey delusion, sand
traps floating through the air. So, when we got wind of this one,
we licked our chops, found ``moronic'' in the thesaurus and waited
for the kill. Now, we must eat crow. New &AMP; Notable has been
conquered by a pop-up book, wrestled into submission by a gadget.
Gary Greenberg, the stand-up comedian who created it, begins with
the mother of all phobias, the Dentist and the Drill. This
particular drill twists as it rises into view, and it is big enough
to roto-rooter your nostril. When it reaches dead center, it is
aimed straight at you, right at your very teeth, and behind it is a
dentist who bears more than a passing resemblance to Joseph
Mengele. You have to laugh _ what else can you do? Greenberg has
paired off the ludicrous and the macabre, and we couldn't wait to
turn the page and see what he'd do next. There are 10 phobias here,
including most of the big ones, but we won't say more. The
dentist's drill is funny whether you know it's coming or not, but
others profit from an element of surprise. Either way, phobias beat
golf courses, hands down. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``DOGS THAT KNOW WHEN THEIR OWNERS ARE COMING HOME'' &QL; 
By Rupert Sheldrake (Crown, $25) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Surely, Sheldrake is preaching to the converted when he makes
the case for studying our own pets (and not just creatures in
research labs) to foster our awareness of ``the unexplained powers
of animals.'' After all, the people most likely to buy his book are
those who agree with him, who object to our longstanding taboo
against taking pets seriously. There's nevertheless something
heartwarming about his arguments, which embrace the animals we love
as both gifted creatures and sources of scientific knowledge.
Through interviews and surveys with pet owners, veterinarians, dog
trainers and zoo keepers in the United States and Britain,
Sheldrake explores the phenomenon of telepathic communication
between people and animals _ in other words, he asks why a dog
might know 20 minutes in advance that its owner is coming home,
even when the owner is unexpected. Or how a cat hearing a ringing
telephone would know that someone it loves is on the other end of
the line. What makes an animal show unmistakable signs of agitation
a full three hours before an earthquake, or enables a horse to find
its way home across unfamiliar terrain? And why, if there are some
dogs that know their owners are coming home, are there other dogs
that don't have a clue? Are some breeds more sensitive than others?
Sheldrake explores animal empathy, the therapeutic effect of pets,
animal-to-animal telepathy, the phenomenon of bird migration, and
animal premonitions. His book is an engaging look at domesticated
creatures and the mysterious things that connect us to them. &QL; 
``PLAINSONG'' &QL; 
By Kent Haruf (Knopf, $24) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This lovely, evocative novel is set in Holt, Colo., a prairie
town so small that it takes only an hour for two boys to deliver
all of its newspapers. Those boys are Ike and Bobby Guthrie, whose
father, Tom, teaches history at the high school, and whose mother,
Ella, has taken silently to her bed and will soon move out of the
house and then out of town altogether. Other characters are
Victoria Roubideaux, a pregnant teenage girl whose mother has
locked her out of the house, and the senior McPheron brothers, two
self-described decrepit old bachelors who agree to let Victoria
come and live with them on their farm until her baby is born. Haruf
lets his characters reveal themselves slowly and compassionately,
and the story that takes shape as the ties between them grow is
oddly comforting even as they grapple with changes in their lives.
The feel of this book is not unlike that of Cormac McCarthy's later
novels, both in tone and in the atmospheric sense of place that
becomes almost a character in itself (missing is McCarthy's
trademark violence, although there is one menacing scene in which
Ike and Bobby are roughed up by a teenage bully). Haruf has written
a quietly moving book about ordinary people dealing with the
emotional twists of ordinary life. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``BROTHERS'' &QL; 
(Hyperion, $26.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Writing about my brothers is a dangerous occupation, dancing
through a minefield,'' Frank McCourt says. Maybe so, but there's
something to be said for having tissues on hand if you intend to
read this book _ you might get weepy. There are some fine writers
here _ McCourt, Tobias Wolff, Richard Ford, David Sedaris, James
Alan McPherson _ all talking about their brothers and the bonds and
conflicts between them. We were most taken, however, with the essay
by Charles P. Pierce, who is the son of a brother and the father of
brothers, but who himself is an only child. His is the clear-eyed
view from beyond: ``I have watched brothers all my life,'' he says.
``I watched them in my family growing up, and I watch my children
today, the blood speech of the code-talkers in the other bedrooms,
the swift bursts of anger and the reconciliations, all operating on
rules as foreign and distant to me as Hammurabi's Code.'' Mixed
with these essays are portraits of brothers, some well-known (the
Dalai Lama and his brother, Martin Scorsese and his), some not at
all. This was put together by the editors of ``Esquire.'' &QL;

SCOTT TUROW LOOKS AT JUSTICE SERVED IN `PERSONAL INJURIES' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE STEPHENSON  
 c.1999 Special for The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Personal Injuries'' &QL; 
By Scott Turow &QL; 
(Farrar Straus &AMP; Giroux, $27) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are many lawyers publishing novels these days, but there's
no one better than Scott Turow. He doesn't just churn out
bestsellers. He WRITES them, with intelligence and depth and a feel
for our fascination with the nether regions of the law _ those back
rooms and muted conversations in which the truth comes out, deals
are struck and destinies, however illustrious or tawdry they might
be, are made.
</P>
<P>
   Turow finishes a book like clockwork, every three years:
``Presumed Innocent (1987),'' ``The Burden of Proof
(1990),''``Pleading Guilty (1993)''and ``The Laws of Our Fathers
(1996).'' Now, we have ``Personal Injuries,'' a novel meant not so
much to entertain as to make us think about ambition and
compromise, and their affect on how justice is served.
</P>
<P>
   It's the most layered and introspective book Turow has written.
That doesn't mean it's his best _ there are whole chapters that
will try a reader's patience _ but it's certainly his most
ambitious. And in Scott Turow, ambition can be a mighty impressive
thing.
</P>
<P>
   The character at the center of ``Personal Injuries'' is Robbie
Feaver (pronounced ``favor''), a personal-injury lawyer who with
his partner has been caught shortchanging the IRS. In this
instance, tax evasion is less a crime than convenient leverage _ on
the heels of the IRS agents comes U.S. Attorney Stan Sennett, who
offers to keep Feaver out of jail if he will provide evidence
against judges suspected of taking payoffs from lawyers (Feaver
among them) in exchange for favorable decisions.
</P>
<P>
   There are several judges in question, but the one Sennett really
wants is the powerful Brendan Tuohey, the man most likely to become
chief judge of Kindle County, the fictional setting of Turow's
novels. In his effort to get Tuohey, Sennett sets up an elaborate
ruse that includes fake lawyers, fake clients and fake
personal-injury cases. Project Petros, as the sting is called, will
go on for months, with Robbie Feaver attempting to record judges as
they sniff at, then swallow, his bribes.
</P>
<P>
   Turow uses these circumstances to create some memorable
characters, all laden with contradictions. Stan Sennett is an
ambitious man whose righteous convictions are served by devious and
often cutthroat tactics. Evon Miller, the FBI agent brought in to
pose as Feaver's associate and latest lover, grapples with her own
secrets (she is a poor imitation of Thomas Harris' Clarice Starling
in ``The Silence of the Lambs'') while she tries to fend off
Feaver's amorous attentions.
</P>
<P>
   The crooked judges are colorful even as they flirt with disaster
on Robbie Feaver's surveillance tapes. Barnett Skolnick is a
rambling but likeable dimwit (``There are dead men,'' Feaver says,
``who are not as dumb as Barney Skolnick'') who owes his place on
the bench to the tactics of his brother, a thug named Knuckles.
Sherman Crowthers is a huge and powerfully spoken Black man, once
one of the best defense attorneys in the county, now a judge who
rules his courtroom with rough eloquence and intimidation. And
Brendan Tuohey, the biggest prize, hides his avarice under a veneer
of serenity, protected by the loyalty of the lackeys around him.
</P>
<P>
   But the real enigma is Feaver himself, a pretty boy who appears
to have slept with every woman he has ever met (he would have sex
with a spoon if it seemed willing), yet remains devoted to his
wife, who is dying of Lou Gehrig's disease. Feaver starts the book
as a sleazy yukster, a used-car salesman in an Italian suit and a
perpetual tan, but grows in substance and stature until we almost _
ALMOST _ understand what women see in him. By the end, he is the
novel's symbolic Good Man, and he deserves the emphasis. Caught
among the criminals, the cops and the lawyers, he is the key to all
of their ambitions, but is left with nothing to call his own.
</P>
<P>
   Having created such a dense abundance of character, Turow tells
his story with a surprisingly heavy hand. This is his most
descriptive book, and that's not such a good thing. He gives us the
details of everything _ rugs, desks, buildings, courtrooms,
clothing, people and, most annoyingly, the minutiae of surveillance
(it seems as if we receive an inventory of Robbie's cameras and
microphones every time he approaches a judge over the long months
of Project Petros). Once, when Robbie walks through an innocuous
patch of woods on his way to a golf-course meeting with Brendan
Tuohey, Turow describes not only the trees and the land around him,
but the settlers who had walked that way a century before.
</P>
<P>
   It makes for some slow going, and that, unfortunately, is one of
the lingering impressions of this book: ``Personal Injuries,''
which is 400 pages long, could have lost 50 and been better for it.
There's also the matter of its narrator. George Mason, who is
Robbie Feaver's attorney, begins the novel in the first person,
establishing himself as the teller of the story. His voice fades in
and out, however, giving way without warning to an omniscient
narration in the many scenes during which George is not present
(private conversations between Evon and Robbie, for example, or
between Evon and Robbie's dying wife).
</P>
<P>
   Depending on your mood, you'll think this reappearing ``I'' is
arty or distracting. Or maybe, if you're feeling very generous,
you'll choose to look at it as a lawyer's tactic. After all, as
George tells us from the start, ``This is a lawyer's story, the
kind attorneys like to hear and tell.''
</P>
<P>
   If you want action, look elsewhere. But if you want a glimpse of
the legal profession through one of its own (Scott Turow still
practices in Chicago), this is not a bad place to be. His mistakes
are a writer's mistakes, something most lawyer-novelists don't have
the talent to make. If you want proof, just wait three years. &QL;

HIS POPULARITY SURGING, RUSSIAN PREMIER TOURS CHECHNYA WAR ZONE 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By CELESTINE BOHLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ With his own popularity ratings soaring, Russian Prime
Minister Vladimir Putin on Wednesday took a 10-minute ride aboard a
Sukhoi 25 fighter plane during a one-day tour of the war zone along
the border of the rebellious region of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Two months after he was picked to head President Boris Yeltsin's
latest government, Putin has shot up in the rankings of potential
presidential contenders, buoyed by broad public support for a
military campaign aimed at crushing Islamic guerrillas who have
made Chechnya their base.
</P>
<P>
   One recent poll showed Putin _ named by Yeltsin as his preferred
successor in next summer's presidential election _ moving in right
behind former Prime Minister Yevgeni Primakov, now the leader of
the largest political coalition arrayed against the Kremlin. Asked
who they would elect as president if the elections were held now,
27 percent chose Putin, while 28 percent chose Primakov.
</P>
<P>
   In a similar poll taken in September, Putin, a former KGB
officer and then still a political unknown, had a popularity rating
of 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Putin on Wednesday handed out medals to pilots who have been
leading Russia's bombing attacks against Islamic militants who
Moscow says staged armed raids against neighboring regions and
terrorist attacks in Moscow and other cities.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   According to Chechen government officials in Grozny, the
regional capital, hundreds of civilians have been killed in the
bombing raids, but little information about casualties has filtered
back to Russia.
</P>
<P>
   As the bombing continues _ war planes flew 15 missions during a
recent 24-hour period, according to the Russian military _ refugees
have continued to flee the region, putting an enormous political
and social strain on Chechnya's neighbors in the volatile North
Caucasus. The number of refugees has now topped 170,000, more than
one-third of Chechnya's already diminished population.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Putin has been credited with taking a tough, decisive
line against Chechnya, a secessionist region that won a military
victory against Russian troops in 1996 but which has since been
plagued by banditry and kidnappings that have soured its relations
with the Russian press and public. In recent weeks, one Russian
journalist was briefly held by kidnappers, and another has been
reported missing.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's dour manner and blunt words, as well as his background
in Russia's security services, have given him added authority in a
country where a majority of people tell pollsters that they do not
trust politicians and yearn for a ``strong hand,'' that can remedy
Russia's distress.
</P>
<P>
   According to a poll by the Russian Center for the Study of
Public Opinion, 70 percent of Russians polled in large cities said
they trust Putin. In another poll, 32 percent said that ``will and
determination'' were his dominant character traits.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Putin has repeatedly refused to negotiate with Chechen President
Aslan Maskhadov unless he repudiates Shamil Basayev, a local
warlord who reportedly runs a series of guerrilla training camps on
Chechen territory. Regarded by Moscow as an international terrorist
because of his reported links to foreign Islamic extremists,
Basayev has remained at large during Russia's month-long military
campaign, and has met with foreign journalists in Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   Russian troops advanced into Chechnya's northern tier earlier
this month, and are now massed along the banks of the Terek River.
Speculation about a possible assault on Grozny was fanned today by
comments by Gen. Valery Manilov, chief of the Russian general
staff, who told reporters that if necessary, ``Grozny, like other
settled areas, will be freed from terrorists and the terrorists
themselves destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   According to news reports from Grozny, Russian troops are now
concentrated to the north and west of the capital, and in some
cases, are holding positions as close as 10 miles to the city.
</P>
<P>
   But memories of Russia's disastrous assaults against Grozny in
the last war _ which killed tens of thousands of civilians and left
much of the city in ruins _ are still fresh. Several leading
Russian politicians _ including Primakov _ have urged the
government not to move troops deeper inside Chechen territory.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting Wednesday with residents of Znamenskoye, a village in
the Russian-occupied zone in northern Chechnya, Putin suggested
that a final decision of a full-scale assault has not yet been
made.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to stress that political issues including the issue of
the status of the Chechen republic will not be solved by military
methods,'' he said. ``We shall solve them in the course of
negotiations with all those who are willing to participate in the
talks under condition of extraditing terrorists and prevention of
revival of terrorism on the territory of the Chechen republic.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   As several commentators have pointed out, Putin's current
popularity could vanish just as quickly as it appeared, if the
military campaign gets mired in a guerrilla war, fought in
Chechnya's rugged mountains as winter sets in.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Russian troops have suffered relatively few losses.
According to Manilov, about 190 servicemen have killed in fighting
in Chechnya and neighboring Dagestan, a figure that does not
include Interior Ministry casualties. But as the numbers rise,
experts say Russian public opinion could swing against Putin,
particularly if no political solution to the war is in sight.

 &HT;    South Florida faces overpopulation
 &HT;    By Michael Browning
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Like the lower bulb of an hourglass,
South Florida is filling up with people and running out of time,
simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   Florida's ballooning population is likely to become a
significant issue in the 2000 election, according to a poll of 500
likely voters by a Washington-based group that advocates tightening
immigration laws
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time a poll like this has been taken, and
it's some pretty startling stuff,'' said Christopher Conner, a
spokesman for Negative Population Growth, an organization that
claims 18,000 members nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we found was that the longer a person has been in
Florida, the more unhappy they are with the way the state is going.
Some 72 percent feel that growth, sprawl and overpopulation are
Florida's major problem, and 39 percent feel that Florida is
generally worse off than it was five years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   It is estimated that Florida adds 650 new residents every day, a
million every four years. Even at 1992 growth rates, each day we
needed two new roads, two new classrooms, two new teachers, two new
police officers, one more jail cell and two more prison beds,
according to a state-sponsored study.
</P>
<P>
   At current growth rates, each day we need 111,000 more gallons
of fresh water than we did the day before. Each day we flush 95,000
more gallons of waste water and generate 3,500 more pounds of solid
waste.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty percent of Florida's wetlands have been lost in this
century. Each year about 150,000 acres of farmland in Florida are
lost to development, according to the U.S. Department of
Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   THE `MEZZANINE SOLUTION'
</P>
<P>
   Florida, which had a population of just 34,730 in 1830, hosts 15
million people today. It is the fourth most populated state in the
country, after California, New York and Texas. Forecasts predict
the population will top 20 million in 2020, and reach 30 million by
2050. Now, 27 of the state's 67 counties have populations over
100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Two counties, Broward and Sarasota, have passed resolutions
calling this week ``Overpopulation Awareness Week.'' It's little
more than a gesture, a bit like locking the barn door after the
horse has run away. Broward had a population of 1,503,407 in 1998,
and many people in the western reaches of the county live like the
Dutch, behind levees, on land wrested from the Everglades _ land
that ought to be submerged. Sarasota County boasts 321,404 people,
according to 1999 estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Palm Beach County, with a population of 1,032,625 in 1998, is
rapidly following in Broward's footsteps. Martin County numbered
211,707 in the last Census, in 1990. St. Lucie County hosted
150,171.
</P>
<P>
   Miami-Dade County will likely add another 1.2 million people by
2015. Broward expects to have 1,737,041. Palm Beach will have
1,373,800, according to comprehensive land use plan projections.
Miami-Dade County planners jest darkly about ``the mezzanine
solution:'' adding one floor to everything that has already been
built _ going vertical, in effect.
</P>
<P>
   THE COMPREHENSIVE PLANS
</P>
<P>
   Don't look to the state, the counties or the cities to rein in
development, either. In 1985, compelled by law, city and county
planners drew up comprehensive land use plans _ blueprints for
future growth. Everyone who wanted to build in Florida would have
to be ``in compliance'' with the ``comp plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, out of curiosity, a team of planners working for the
Southwest Florida Regional Planning Council totaled up the
theoretical state population allowed by all the comp plans.
</P>
<P>
   The sum: 101 million people.
</P>
<P>
   It was a figure eerily close to the projections aired during the
lunatic days of the 1920s Florida land boom, when it was
confidently predicted that Florida could easily host 100 million
people because its land mass was a certain multiple of
Massachusetts' area, and Massachusetts' population times Florida's
size equaled 100 million.
</P>
<P>
   Already the phenomenon of ``half-backs'' is manifesting itself.
It began with Hurricane Andrew in 1992. South Floridians, who may
have come here from out of state and who are fed up with South
Florida, are moving to North and Central Florida: They are heading
back northward, but only part way. They are ``half-backs.''
</P>
<P>
   Seven Florida cities _ Orlando, Fort Lauderdale, West Palm
Beach, Miami, Tampa, Daytona Beach and Pensacola _ suffer from
urban sprawl, the tendency of cities to expand into outlying areas,
causing excessive traffic and smog, according to a 1998 report by
the Sierra Club, a national environmental group. The cities were
ranked by population.
</P>
<P>
   The Orlando area is the most threatened by sprawl among regions
with between 500,000 and 1 million residents. West Palm Beach is
fourth. Fort Lauderdale is ninth on the group's list, Tampa is 14th
and Miami is 18th. Among cities with a population between 200,000
and 500,000, Pensacola is third and Daytona Beach is fourth.
</P>
<P>
   IMMIGRATION POLICY UNDER FIRE
</P>
<P>
   Florida's extraordinary growth spurt has alarmed some people
enough to act: Joyce Tarnow, a Pompano Beach anti-growth activist,
heads a group called ``Floridians For a Sustainable Population.''
It was Tarnow who persuaded the Broward commission to issue its
growth awareness proclamation.
</P>
<P>
   Tarnow disagrees with the notion that growth is strictly a local
issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The federal government could enforce the Clean Air Act,''
Tarnow said. ``It could compel communities to adhere to strict
water standards. Above all, it could reform immigration policy.
We're letting in nearly a million people a year. That should be cut
back to something like 250,000. We've got to put a stop to `chain
immigration,' where one family member can invite all the rest of
his family, and all the rest of their families, to the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service's figures show
that in budget year 1998, the most recent for which firm numbers
exist, the U.S. admitted 660,477 immigrants legally, of whom
284,270 were relatives of prior immigrants. The six most desirable
states for new arrivals in this country are California, New York,
Florida, Texas, New Jersey and Illinois, in that order, immigration
records show. Negative Population Growth's Conner realizes that
anti-immigration attitudes don't sit well in South Florida, where
the Cuban exile community has a powerful political voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not xenophobic,'' he said. ``We don't hate immigrants.
We aren't singling out Asians, or Cubans, or Mexicans, or Latin
Americans. We're just saying we need a rational immigration policy,
one that allows us to absorb newcomers naturally.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Since his confirmation as chief delegate to the
United Nations, Richard Holbrooke has turned himself from
high-flying diplomat to part-time lobbyist, walking the halls of
Congress and buttonholing members on the elevator, on the Capitol
subway, at their doors _ anywhere he can find them.
</P>
<P>
   He was campaigning again Wednesday, and by midafternoon, with a
bevy of aides in tow, the tally was six formal appointments, 14
chance encounters and still more meetings to go, all in the cause
of rescuing the United States' standing at the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke, whose appointment was confirmed by the Senate in
August, has come to Washington every week, sometimes twice a week,
to try to persuade Congress to pay nearly a billion dollars that
the United States owes the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The consequences are catastrophic if we don't get this,''
Holbrooke said to Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard, D-Calif., after
running into the congresswoman in the corridor.
</P>
<P>
   He then dashed into the office of Rep. James Greenwood, R-Pa.,
who is one of the high hopes in Holbrooke's nitty-gritty campaign
to persuade Republicans who are against abortion to untie that
issue from legislation authorizing payment of the U.N. money.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, President Clinton vetoed a bill containing payments
for the United Nations because it included an amendment restricting
U.S. funding for family planning organizations abroad. Holbrooke,
whose success as the American representative depends in part on
whether Washington pays the arrears, is seeking to avoid a similar
outcome this year.
</P>
<P>
   But for all his crusading, Holbrooke knows that as the budget
battle with the Republicans unfolds, the heavy lifting on the U.N.
payments must come from the White House.
</P>
<P>
   He said Wednesday that he was heartened to be informed by Sandy
Berger, the national security adviser, that Clinton had put foreign
policy _ including the U.N. arrears and financial assistance to the
Middle East _ ``on top of the agenda'' during a budget negotiations
session with Republican leaders Tuesday night at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president has made it a priority issue,'' Holbrooke said,
just as he bumped into an old friend, Rep. Patsy Mink, D-Hawaii,
who served at the State Department with Holbrooke and who did not
need any cajoling on the U.N. issue as they rode the subway
together.
</P>
<P>
   But the Republicans were not sounding so positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The White House has to come up with some ideas on how to solve
this issue,'' said a senior aide to the Republican leadership.

 &HT;    MindSpring, EarthLink earnings top
 &HT;    estimates
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ MindSpring Enterprises performed better than expected
in the third quarter, beating Wall Street expectations despite
posting its third straight losing quarter.
</P>
<P>
   MindSpring reported a loss of $10.8 million, or 17 cents a
diluted share. The Atlanta-based Internet access provider reported
income of $4 million, or 7 cents a diluted share, for the same
three months in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   EarthLink Network, the Pasadena, Calif., company expected to
merge with MindSpring early next year, also beat analysts'
expectations with its third-quarter performance. If the merger is
completed as expected, the two companies would be the nation's
second-largest ISP behind America Online. The combined company will
be called EarthLink, but will be based in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of MindSpring dropped 87 1/2 cents, closing Wednesday at
$25.81 1/4. EarthLink shares closed at $41.68 3/4, down $1.06 1/4.
</P>
<P>
   MindSpring is amortizing ``goodwill'' costs for its recent
acquisitions of Sprynet ($32 million) and Netcom ($245 million).
The deals gave MindSpring 500,000 more customers. Excluding those
costs, MindSpring reported income of $3.4 million, or 5 cents a
share, beating the First Call consensus estimate by 2 cents.
</P>
<P>
   When a company buys another company, it is allowed to write off
``goodwill amortization,'' the difference between what one company
pays for another company and the acquired company's book value.
</P>
<P>
   MindSpring also said it will spend between $7 million and $9
million less than planned on sales and marketing in the fourth
quarter. The company planned to spend more than $55 million on a
advertising campaign to make the MindSpring name better-known
nationwide. But if the EarthLink merger is approved, the name
MindSpring will exist only in the e-mail addresses of its existing
customers.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the company will use some of the national marketing
money to send disks, America Online-style, through the mail and
with Sunday newspapers closer to home.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of September, MindSpring had about 1.3 million
customers, an increase of 69,000, or 5.6 percent, from the previous
quarter. The advertising campaign did not start until September.
The company said it does not expect to see large numbers of new
subscribers until the fourth quarter and that even that growth will
be slower than expected.
</P>
<P>
   EarthLink has 1.57 million subscribers. The company said it
added 231,000 customers, a 17 percent increase from the previous
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   EarthLink is growing more quickly because it started an
aggressive marketing campaign nine months before MindSpring, said
Jeff Sadler, an analyst with F.A.C. Equities.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is EarthLink growing more quickly, it is keeping more
of its customers than MindSpring. EarthLink loses 3.6 percent of
its customers each month, compared with MindSpring's ``churn rate''
of 4.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   MindSpring has one full-time person and two half-timers working
on the churn issue, said Mike McQuary, MindSpring president and
chief operating officer. He said the company will focus on
customers who drop out in the first two months by calling new
customers who aren't using the service much and asking why.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to rely on them calling us,'' McQuary said.
</P>
<P>
   People calling MindSpring's technical support spent an average
of seven minutes on hold during the third quarter, an increase of
five minutes from the previous quarter. Callers to the customer
service center saw their average hold time increase from one minute
to four minutes over the same period. Call center hold time, or
lack therof, is something MindSpring has used to distinguish itself
from its competitors with billboards teasing, ``Their hold music is
better than ours. It has to be.''
</P>
<P>
   McQuary said MindSpring was deluged by the number of calls from
former customers of Netcom, who, prior to MindSpring's acquisition
of Netcom, had no toll-free customer support number.
</P>
<P>
   The company hired 185 customer service employees during the
third quarter. McQuary said callers to the technical support lines
are averaging four minutes this month.
</P>
<P>
   Miles Russ, an analyst with Robinson-Humphrey, attributed the
call center delays to normal issues that occur when a company tries
to absorb customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you double your subscriber base like they did with
Netcom, there's going to be a little bit of a lag time before you
can catch up with it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   EarthLink took in $89.6 million in the third quarter but spent
that, and $31.4 million more, for a per-share loss of $1.07. A year
ago, EarthLink reported a net loss of $18.8 million, or 78 cents
per share, on $49.8 million in revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Not counting goodwill amortization, EarthLink reported a net
loss of $13.7 million, or 42 cents per share. Analysts expected
EarthLink to lose 43 cents per share.

IN A SURPRISE, MODERATE MUSLIM LEADER CHOSEN TO LEAD INDONESIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (With INDONESIA-WAHID) 
 (nk) 
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ In the first democratic transfer of power
in its history, Indonesia chose a new president Wednesday,
Abdurrahman Wahid, a respected Muslim religious leader whose
message is tolerance, inclusion and self respect.
</P>
<P>
   The vote for Wahid, 59, in an electoral assembly Wednesday, was
a surprise, the result of fast-moving coalition building that
followed a general election in June in which the prominent
opposition figure, Megawati Sukarnoputri, won a plurality of
parliamentary seats.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid, nearly blind and weakened by a stroke, defeated Megawati
373-313, with five abstentions, after President B.J. Habibie
withdrew his candidacy earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid raised Megawati's hand as he joined in the singing of the
national anthem at his inauguration. His opponent stood beside him
swallowing back tears and biting her lip.
</P>
<P>
   It was an extraordinary moment of anticlimax as, suddenly, with
a minimum of fuss, a new leader took power in the world's fourth
most-populous nation.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid, who is a practicing cleric as well as a religious leader,
pushed ahead with his presidential bid despite almost unanimous
warnings here that he could not win. After his National Awakening
Party placed a distant third in June, he had become a key supporter
of Megawati, then broke with her early this month when she hung
back from forming a coalition, seeming to believe the presidency
was hers.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid put together his own winning numbers in the hours before
the balloting began when Habibie's withdrawal left hundreds of
anti-Megawati votes looking for a standard-bearer.
</P>
<P>
   His victory gives Indonesia the clean break with the past for
which Megawati had been the symbol, and in a moderate form that is
acceptable to most minorities. It also gives the world's most
populous Islamic nation its first cleric as a leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little surprised,'' said a leading economist, Emil
Salim. ``Everybody is surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   And the only thing that is certain is the likelihood of more
surprises, according to those who know Wahid, who he is
unpredictable by nature.
</P>
<P>
   The electoral assembly was scheduled to choose a vice president
on Thursday. The choice, which is not governed by party tickets,
gained special importance because of Wahid's poor health and
because of the need to create an alliance that would mend political
rifts.
</P>
<P>
   Then the real, long-postponed work of government must resume as
the country attempts to settle down from a two-year period of
economic and political turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   The urgent agenda is daunting as Indonesia works to restart its
economy and rebuild its government institutions and its sense of
national pride and purpose.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, there was violence on the streets of Jakarta
Wednesday night as street thugs joined disappointed supporters of
Megawati in battling the police and soldiers in what has almost
become a ritual here.
</P>
<P>
   The violence included stone throwing, vandalism, arson, tear gas
and a car bomb that the police said injured 18 people. At least one
person was reported killed. At nightfall, the Jakarta Convention
Center was on fire and gangs continued to roam some streets,
pursued by the police.
</P>
<P>
   But the evening's rampage did not approach the kind of broad
social unrest that people had feared might occur if Megawati lost
the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Schwarz, an expert on Indonesia at Johns Hopkins
University, said it would be up to Megawati now to draw on her
popularity to contain the anger and frustration of her followers,
who were convinced that she would win.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the violence, Wednesday was a day of national pride as
Indonesia embraced its experiment with democracy, breaking away
from 32 years of selfish and autocratic rule under President
Suharto, who was forced to resign in May 1998.
</P>
<P>
   His vice president, Habibie, who had taken over leadership and
then fought hard to win Wednesday's vote, accepted defeat with
smiling good grace.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The armed forces, which had served as the arm of Suharto's
repression, and which hold seats in the assembly, for the most part
were careful to stay out of the political fray both in the June
ballot and in the electoral assembly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The military has played a fairly responsible role in terms of
what is apparent,'' Schwarz said. ``It was a secret ballot so we
don't know how they voted. But clearly they have decided to make a
concerted effort to at least give the impression that they are
playing a neutral, on-the-sidelines role.''
</P>
<P>
   The armed forces on Wednesday pledged its support to a new
president who may have benefited from the parliamentary votes of
its 38-member bloc but, for the first time in Indonesian history,
did not appear to owe his tenure to it.
</P>
<P>
   The chief military spokesman, Maj. Gen. Surdrajat, said the
country's armed forces, ``together with the Indonesian people, are
thankful in having Abdurrahman Wahid as our new president.'' He
added, ``I believe that people will accept the reality of
democracy. We ask people to return to their homes and not to create
unrest.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The day was marked by gestures of unity and conciliation from
the new president and his two defeated rivals, moments of
extraordinary emotion given Indonesia's history of ruthless
transfers of power.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am here with Mrs. Megawati to celebrate our victory and our
democracy and our second independence since the founding president,
Sukarno, planted the flag upon our soil,'' Wahid said immediately
after the vote, as he held her hand. ``I have great respect for
Mrs. Megawati and she must be respected for her role in all of
this.''
</P>
<P>
   The reference to Sukarno was a generous nod to Megawati, who is
the former president's daughter and who drew much of her popularity
from her association with him.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a seat beside Wahid, she addressed television cameras,
saying, ``For the unity of the nation, I call on the people of
Indonesia to accept the results of the election.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, as Wahid slowly climbed to the dais to take
his oath of office, Habibie _ humiliated just hours before in the
same chamber by a no-confidence vote _ rose to take the new
president's arm and guide him to the podium.
</P>
<P>
   The show of reconciliation was all the more remarkable because
the outcome of the vote differed so completely from that of the
June vote and from the months of horse trading that followed it.
</P>
<P>
   Almost nobody apart from Wahid himself had expected him to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who could have predicted this eight months ago?'' said a
diplomat Wednesday as the voting was about to begin. ``The two
people who you thought were most solid with each other are now
vying for the presidency. It is a remarkable turn of events.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   According to most analysts, Wahid's victory resulted primarily
from Megawati's refusal to compromise or build coalitions after the
election in June in which her party won 34 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   As she and her advisers waited for other parties to come to
them, and then as often as not rejected their overtures, the
political landscape shifted rapidly. Wahid broke away from her
earlier this month, supported by a coalition of Muslim and other
groups.
</P>
<P>
   Then, when the assembly on Tuesday night voted to reject
Habibie, after 17 months in office, he withdrew from the race,
leaving scores of votes uncommited. Most of them apparently went to
Wahid.
</P>
<P>
   Now the nation must turn from politics to policy as it faces an
economic crisis, separatist rebellions, and what many analysts say
are urgent needs for fundamental political and structural reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Several analysts said that, particularly because Wahid was not
seen as a hands-on manager, his selection of a Cabinet would be the
most crucial step he would take in the early part of his
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   In his inaugural speech Wednesday evening, he stressed his
vision of national reconciliation and mutual respect and touched on
some of the themes that most concern Indonesians today: national
dignity and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to a mood of wounded pride following months of
demands for reform by the International Monetary Fund and following
the introduction of foreign troops in East Timor, he spoke of
``insensitive'' criticisms from other nations.
</P>
<P>
   Characteristically he included a small joke, saying he would
keep his speech short because ``the longer I speak the more
responsibilities I'll have in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   During his campaign he said that he supported Indonesia's
emerging democratic reforms and that he would support the economic
reforms that have been demanded by international lenders in return
for continued assistance.
</P>
<P>
   But most economists agree that given the strictures of the
demands of donors and investors, there is in any case little room
for maneuver in setting economic policy.
</P>
<P>
   If Wahid hopes to lead Indonesia to a clean new page in its
history, he brings a not-insignificant new virtue to the
presidency. He has not been tainted by accusations of corruption or
ill-gotten wealth.

ANALYSIS: WILL TOO MUCH SUCCESS SPOIL GEORGE W. BUSH? 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also DOLE-WITHDRAWS) 
(sw) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ For Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, it may be too much
success _ and too soon.
</P>
<P>
   Now that he has chased the fifth candidate _ Elizabeth Dole _
out of the Republican presidential competition, Bush leaves
absolutely no question about his political might.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Bush's unprecedented success _ never have so many
big-name candidates exited a presidential race more than three
months before the first votes are cast _ could complicate what thus
far been his painless glide to the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   For months, Bush has benefited immeasurably from divisions among
his opponents. But now, those left standing, particularly Sen. John
McCain of Arizona and Steve Forbes, have a much clearer, though
certainly uphill, shot at toppling the front-runner, particularly
as the campaign enters a phase of high-profile debates.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Bush's advisers said they would have preferred that Mrs.
Dole had stayed in the race, at the very least to distract McCain
and the others.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a mixed blessing for us,'' said one Bush operative,
speaking on the condition of anonymity. ``It shows our continued
incredible strength. Anytime you begin to shrink the field, you
increase the potential of the vote for those who remain. So I would
have liked Elizabeth to stay in for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as former Sen. Bill Bradley is drawing enormous press
attention from his one-one-one competition with Vice President Al
Gore, the shrunken Republican field will give those still competing
a much larger public stage. Besides McCain and Forbes, Gary Bauer
has been organizing aggressively among grassroots conservatives.
Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah and Alan Keyes, the radio talk show host,
are also campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   But the timing of Mrs. Dole's announcement was most propitious
for McCain because he has been battling Mrs. Dole over the same
pool of moderate and independent voters and, in the past several
weeks, has been on something of a roll: He recently completed a
successful book tour. He is creeping up on Bush in polls in New
Hampshire, which holds the first primary. This week, he grabbed the
endorsement of the borough president of Staten Island, Guy
Molinari, who defected from the Bush campaign. And while his bill
to overhaul the campaign finance system suffered a stinging defeat
in the Senate on Tuesday, McCain attracted plenty of publicity for
pushing the measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a nice little boomlet going here,'' said Rick Davis,
McCain's campaign manager. ``This brings it into focus as a two-man
race.'' The altered dynamics, he said, could lead his campaign to
reconsider elements of its strategy, such as the decision not to
compete heavily in Iowa, which holds the first important caucuses
in January.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain's greatest vulnerability is Forbes' greatest
strength: money. Because he is dipping into his personal fortune,
Forbes has the resources to stay in the contest longer. The
narrowed field allows him to train his advertising blitz more
directly on Bush and to draw contrasts between his conservative
views and more moderate positions of Bush and McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``This underscores that I am the conservative alternative
against two moderate establishment candidates,'' Forbes said in an
interview. He added that he believed the others dropped out because
of ``discouragement over what they see as the coronation process
for the front-runner.''
</P>
<P>
   One Bush adviser, expressing concern that Forbes will begin to
attack the governor on television commercials, said, ``This shifts
the dynamic so Forbes gets rid of the clutter and he gets to really
rumble with Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   But another Bush adviser shrugged at the notion that the
campaign was unnerved by Mrs. Dole's withdrawal. ``You don't have
any control over any of that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While there are now more big-name candidates out of the race
than in it, Mrs. Dole's departure is particularly notable because
as the only woman contender, she brought a star quality to the
campaign and was something of a wild card because she was popular
with many women and young voters who had not before participated.
In survey after survey, she had scored second to Bush _ albeit a
far distant second.
</P>
<P>
   No matter who benefits from the hasty exits, Bush deserves
credit for showing his opponents to the door, with the help of a
$60 million warchest and towering poll numbers. Mrs. Dole was
preceded by former Vice President Dan Quayle, Rep. John Kasich of
Ohio, Sen. Bob Smith of New Hampshire and former Gov. Lamar
Alexander of Tennessee. And though it is not official, Pat Buchanan
is out the door as well, positioning himself for the Reform Party
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``However this plays next January in terms of who it helps or
who it hurts, the plain fact is that Bush has enjoyed a level of
support never seen in presidential politics,'' said Ralph Reed, an
adviser to Bush. ``This speaks more to the strengths of Governor
Bush than it does the weakness of the Dole candidacy.''
</P>
<P>
   While the shrunken field may offer new hopes and opportunities
for Bush's rivals, in practical terms there were no immediate signs
that he is diminished. Thus far, there is no change in the dynamic
of Bush dominance that has guided this race from the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Even here in Arizona, where McCain is the favorite son, the
senator is still in a neck-in-neck competition with Bush in the
latest polls. ``I hope to do well here,'' Bush said in an interview
in Phoenix on Monday. ``I'm in the business of trying to earn a
broad base of support across the country.''
</P>
<P>
   And although McCain and Mrs. Dole were battling the same turf,
Bush could actually pick up more raw votes from her withdrawal than
McCain because of his broad appeal to Republicans across the
political spectrum and his aura of invincibility.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Newport, editor in chief of the Gallup Poll, said that in
a national survey taken by his organization early this month Bush
drew 60 percentage points. Mrs. Dole pulled in only 11 percent. But
when her supporters were asked for their second choice, Bush was
the overwhelming favorite.
</P>
<P>
   ''This doesn't alter the lineup _ it makes everybody a little
bit bigger,'' said Ed Gillespie, a Republican strategist. ``The
question is whether Forbes or McCain can capitalize enough right
now to thrust themselves into the principal challenger's spot.''
</P>
<P>
   The two men will have an opportunity to once against make their
pitches at the first Republican debate on Friday in New Hampshire.
Bush has opted not to participate.
</P>
<P>
   But Ed Goeas, a Republican pollster, warned that it would be
foolish for Bush's rivals to get too excited. ``People are slowly,
some more slowly than others, coming to the conclusion that this
nomination is over,'' he said. ``It's not being confronted just
with the money. It's the fact that 60 percent of Republican primary
voters support Bush. It's a tough wall to get over.''

CAST OR ELSE: SIERRA TO CLOSE SOON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRETT PAULY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MAMMOTH LAKES, Calif. _ Most creeks, rivers and lakes in the
Eastern Sierra will be closed to trout fishing for the season on
Halloween. But don't be too fearful: There are several productive
options for fishing all through the winter.
</P>
<P>
   First things first, however. While the general season remains
open, some hot spots _ from south to north _ to consider within the
next 10 days:
</P>
<P>
   __ Crowley Lake: The scorching late-summer fly-fishing bite at
angling's granddaddy of the Eastern Sierra has continued well into
fall.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Farris at Brock's Flyfishing Specialist in Bishop has heard
of the trend. ``Real good,'' he said. ``And that can be r-e-e-l
good, too.'' Drop a size No. 20 midge larval-pattern fly _ either
suspended under a strike indicator with a fly rod or below a bubble
float with a spinning outfit _ in McGee Bay or at the lake's
northern neck, Farris said, and watch as rainbows from 12 to 16
inches or longer take the bait.
</P>
<P>
   Overnight temperatures at Crowley might reach freezing, but
daytime highs are ``balmy,'' in the 55- to 60-degree range.
</P>
<P>
   __ George Lake: Despite the shorter days and cooler nights, the
Mammoth Lakes Basin remains a fruitful producer, with George Lake
spitting out more large fish than its brethren, according to Gary
Hooper at Rick's Sports Center in Mammoth Lakes.
</P>
<P>
   Trout Teaser tube gigs and night crawlers on bubble floats are
doing the most damage, he said, raising some Alpers trout to 6
pounds that were planted during the summer. Fly-anglers might want
to try brown and black woolly buggers.
</P>
<P>
   __ Gull Lake: A 9-pound rainbow was taken Oct. 8 from shore on
an inflated night crawler. Less than a week earlier, an 8-pound,
14-ounce bruiser 'bow was boated on a Trout Teaser that was cast
and retrieved.
</P>
<P>
   But the majority of Gull's bigger trout _ often 4 to 5 pounds or
more _ have been trolled up early in the a.m. or late in the
afternoon with streamer flies and hardware such as a frog- or
bikini-pattern Needlefish or a bronze Triple Teaser.
</P>
<P>
   Trolling isn't your thing?
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to throw lures, do it in the afternoon when the
fish are more active,'' advised Joe Moran of Ernie's Tackle and Ski
Shop in June Lake. ``And bait-fishing is best during the day, when
they're cruising and less active'' _ and not apt to chase anything
that's not absolutely tasty and presented in close proximity.
</P>
<P>
   All of the other usual suspects in the June Lake Loop are
providing fair numbers of trout, with June Lake itself especially
notable for those trolling night crawlers with a flasher or
lead-core line to specimens holding in deeper waters.
</P>
<P>
   __ East Walker River: With Bridgeport Reservoir so-so and the
Twin Lakes downright frigid to anglers, the best bet in the
Bridgeport region is the East Walker, which has a bounty of
late-season prizes for fly-anglers casting nymphs and streamer
patterns.
</P>
<P>
   The river, serving as the outlet to Bridgeport Reservoir, is
flowing at a very fishable 90 cubic feet per second. (At the height
of the season, the river can run at 700 CFS, or about 400 CFS over
the comfort level for fly-fishing.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The fish are in obvious spots. You can wade the whole river.
They are not real spooky or leader-shy because the water has a
tea-colored stain to it and most fish are deep holding in
pockets,'' said Jerry Abbott at Ken's Sporting Goods in Bridgeport.
</P>
<P>
   +++ Open all year
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there all portions of the Eastern Sierra open for
angling year-round.
</P>
<P>
   The Owens Gorge, Pleasant Valley Reservoir and Lower Owens River
outside of Bishop are exempt from seasonal restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Some pundits believe Pleasant Valley will produce a state-record
brown trout _ surpassing the 26{-pound standard _ now that
float-tubing has been allowed and deeper waters can be targeted.
</P>
<P>
   Three sites in Inyo County _ Tinemaha Reservoir south of Big
Pine; Diaz Lake, 2{ miles south of Lone Pine, and Haiwee Reservoir,
another 20 miles to the south _ can be tackled throughout the
entire calendar.
</P>
<P>
   Tinemaha yields some large channel catfish in the spring. Diaz
and Haiwee have been planted liberally with brood stock _ trout
often to gigantic proportions that have passed on their genetic
heritage to at least two sets of offspring and have earned freedom
as a reward for their services. The lake record at Diaz is a
14-pound rainbow, and seldom-pressured Haiwee is home to rainbows
and browns, as well as smallmouth and largemouth bass, that dine on
steady diets of crayfish.
</P>
<P>
   Those who don't mind traveling farther north and doling out $12
for a single-day out-of-state license can consider hitting the
Nevada side of the East Walker River out of Bridgeport. While catch
and release is the law and only artificial lures of flies with
single, barbless hooks are permitted, serious fly-anglers know the
disco midge and other larval patterns can be deadly on the resident
browns and rainbows. &QL;

 &HT;    Blindness prevention part of Carter's vision
 &HT;    By Keith Graham
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Jimmy Carter was talking about vision.
</P>
<P>
   No, not grand sweep, big picture kind of vision.
</P>
<P>
   The former president of the United States was talking about the
failing eyesight of a child.
</P>
<P>
   Carter, 75, was haunted by the image of a 2-year-old boy he had
seen last weekend in the poor West African nation of Mali.
</P>
<P>
   The boy suffered from the early stages of a disease called
trachoma, which has blinded 6 million people and infects millions
more.
</P>
<P>
   The boy's grandmother has already been blinded by the disease.
</P>
<P>
   But the boy, the former president said, still ``has a chance''
of keeping his eyesight.
</P>
<P>
   The youngster from Mali and others like him will have more of a
chance, thanks to new programs the Carter Center is announcing
today.
</P>
<P>
   Grants from the Lions Clubs International Foundation and the
Conrad N. Hilton Foundation _ totaling almost $30 million _ will
allow the Atlanta-based center to expand its existing blindness
treatment and prevention programs in Africa and Latin America and
start new ones.
</P>
<P>
   The first trachoma program is cranking up in Mali, where the
Carter Center has had great success in fighting another illness,
Guinea worm disease. From there, trachoma programs will expand to
Sudan, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Niger, Ghana and Yemen.
</P>
<P>
   The Carter Center has been combating another eye disease, river
blindness, since 1987 and will expand those programs to additional
countries with help from the new grants.
</P>
<P>
   Both ailments have symptoms that can make your stomach churn.
</P>
<P>
   River blindness, which infects 18 million people, is spread when
parasites enter the body through bites from black flies. It has
terrible side effects, Carter said. ``You get itching that is worse
than poison ivy. ... Large sores form on your body where the
micro-organism ... breeds, and the skin changes color so it looks
like you've got leprosy. And then it takes about 12 years for a
person to go blind.''
</P>
<P>
   Trachoma begins with an inflammation of the upper eyelid that
causes scarring. The eyelid turns inward and the movement of
eyelashes causes painful scratches on the cornea.
</P>
<P>
   Again, flies are culprits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's horrendous,'' Carter said, ``in that it starts with
little children because they're not educated well enough or
competent to keeps the flies out of their eyes. It's just
disgusting to a Westerner to see the little child when he opens his
eyes might have 10 flies trying to get moisture out of his eyes.
... And he's not even aware of the fact that he ought to brush them
away. And, of course, the filth builds up on the eye and then it
becomes infected.''
</P>
<P>
   But both diseases are relatively easy to treat.
</P>
<P>
   River blindness is ``treated quite simply with one tablet a year
that Merck &AMP; Co. gives us,'' Carter said. The center has
distributed 17 million of those annual doses so far and expects to
give out more than 6 million in the coming year.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a person with river blindness, they would rather have that
one pill a year than to have a diamond the same size,'' Carter
said.
</P>
<P>
   Simply improving hygiene can prevent trachoma. But Pfizer Inc.
is donating pills that are also effective in treating the disease.
</P>
<P>
   To get such programs going, Carter starts at the top, meeting
with a country's president and relevant ministers of government.
The programs are administered at the grass-roots level, partly
through existing health arms of the governments but also with the
help of local Lions Clubs.
</P>
<P>
   The service organization has been committed to fighting
blindness since it was challenged in 1925 by Helen Keller. Carter
himself is a longtime Lion. He was elected to be a district
governor of the organization before he was elected governor of
Georgia. Today the Lions have grown to 44,500 clubs in 185
countries, including most developing nations.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the Hilton Foundation _ which is chipping in
$13.6 million over 10 years for Carter Center blindness prevention
programs _ and the Lions Clubs _ which are providing $16 million
over five years _ traveled with Carter to Mali last week.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Ervin of Albany is the president of Lions Clubs
International. He confessed to ``very strange'' feelings as he saw
people suffering from ailments so easily preventable. But the Lions
believe the Carter Center programs will be effective because they
are designed to help people help themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Ervin praised the local Lions who will take part in the
programs, including those already assisting the Carter Center in
Nigeria, Cameroon and Sudan. And he praised one aging Lion in
particular.
</P>
<P>
   In the parts of Africa where the Carter Center has worked, Ervin
said, Jimmy Carter is looked on ``almost as a savior.''
</P>
<P>
   Chances are, if you were a 2-year-old boy with trachoma _ or the
people who love that child _ you could see why.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hundreds of families were crowded together in
despair in the desert heat of an Arizona internment camp in 1942
when Eleanor Roosevelt suddenly appeared one day pleading with them
not to lose faith in American democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you imagine?'' asked Cherry Tsutsumida, exulting anew at
the apparition-like visit 57 years ago. She was then a disheartened
6-year-old in the camp of uprooted Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that's a great woman,'' Ms. Tsutsumida said, remembering
details of the first lady's silk blouse and gabardine skirt and,
above all, of the comfort that she brought to the traumatized
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the great domestic tragedies of World War II, 120,000
Japanese-Americans had been denied due process and trucked off by
federal agents after Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, solely because of
their Japanese ancestry.
</P>
<P>
   ``This great lady, coming out to tell us not to lose faith,''
said the American-born Ms. Tsutsumida, explaining in a rush of
recollections just why she could never lose faith.
</P>
<P>
   Such memories of the harsh world of the interned
Japanese-Americans of World War II will soon have a focus near the
Capitol in a sculptured pair of graceful flying cranes _ one
pinioned by the barbed wire of internment, the other soaring like
Ms. Tsutsumida's faith in America.
</P>
<P>
   The bronze sculpture will be the centerpiece of a street-corner
memorial park three blocks north of the Senate chamber.
Construction is to begin Friday amid a celebration by some durable
Americans who well recall their internment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The monument will tell the story forever,'' 80-year-old Joe
Ichiuji said, looking back to when federal agents ominously
descended along the Pacific Coast.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tsutsumida's nation turned upside down, she recalled. In
that frenzied time, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover argued against the
need for internment, proving more liberal than California Attorney
General Earl Warren, who led the internment drive yet was later
chief justice during an historically liberal era of the U.S.
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   To neutralize local leadership and forestall any protest, agents
first arrested the elders _ fathers of thousands of
Japanese-American families. Most were too stunned to disobey the
government, said Ichiuji, who went from being a 22-year-old
citizen, proud to have been drafted into the United States Army,
before Pearl Harbor, to an official pariah discharged as an ``enemy
alien'' and bound for internment.
</P>
<P>
   Families soon followed the fathers into exile solely on the
strength of an executive writ from President Franklin D. Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   In the camps, fathers were often separated from their families,
and the barracks style of living _ lining up for meals and showers
and losing privacy in common rooms _ presented a woeful threat to
family integrity, Ms. Tsutsumida recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I later studied political science,'' said Ms. Tsutsumida, who
is director of the National Japanese American Memorial Foundation,
which financed the $10.6 million memorial. ``And I remember one of
my professors, Hannah Arendt, teaching that the internment was
significant because it was the first time a democratic nation took
a group of people who had citizenship and acted on them without due
process.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Far from bitter, Ichiuji yearned like many friends in the camps
to show his loyalty and demanded military service. When the
government formed an Army unit of Japanese-Americans to fight in
Europe, he volunteered. That unit, the 442nd Regimental Combat
Team, was one of the most decorated front-line units of the war.
</P>
<P>
   Ichiuji's most harrowing war memory is of being in the vanguard
that liberated the Dachau concentration camp. He winced in
recalling a scene of starved inmates staggering into the street to
claw sustenance from the carcass of a dead animal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a sight I will never forget,'' said Ichiuji, a
shoemaker's son who used the GI Bill of Rights after the war to go
to college and achieve a 37-year career in the Agency for
International Development. ``It is indeed ironic that I, who had
come from an American internment camp, would come upon the Nazi
death camp and its Jewish victims. There were vast differences, of
course, but the basis for incarceration was the same: racial
prejudice.''
</P>
<P>
   In the camps, some young men became known as the No-No Boys,
refusing as conscientious objectors to fight for a nation that took
away their families' rights. ``These days, our young generation
resonates to the No-No Boys,'' said Ms. Tsutsumida who celebrates
patriot and objector as one. ``The diversity, that's what so
important. Japanese-Americans were not stereotypical.''
</P>
<P>
   As Ms. Tsutsumida and Ichiuji offered their recollections in
separate conversations, they shared an admission of pride as
Americans in having seen their government steadily, if slowly,
reverse the injustices of internment. Laws barring foreign-born
Asians from owning land or obtaining citizenship were repealed.
Apologies were offered by Congress, and reparations paid.
</P>
<P>
   ``This memorial celebrates the fact that our great democracy did
finally admit it did a great wrong,'' Ms. Tsutsumida said. ``This
is not a war memorial. This is a civil rights memorial.''
</P>
<P>
   Ichiuji agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Truman pinned a citation to our unit's colors,'' he
said, ``And he told us, `You fought not only the enemy, but you
fought prejudice, and you won.'''
</P>
<P>
   The memorial will occupy three-quarters of an acre and offer the
quiet of a rock garden and pool set amid cherry trees and a
28-foot-tall ceremonial bell suggestive of a Japanese shrine. The
government donated the land and will maintain the park, while
Japanese-Americans financed the construction.
</P>
<P>
   When Ichiuji came back from the war, he found that his family's
old home, unlike that of many other internment victims, had been
kept empty and protected by friendly fellow citizens in Pacific
Grove, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``My folks were lucky,'' he said. ``I am proud of my heritage
and my country.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tsutsumida recalled internment as ``a very quick lesson in
civics.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We understand the potential of the United States,'' she said,
anticipating the memorial as a redemption of the long-ago plea she
heard from Mrs. Roosevelt.  &QL;

BOY, 11, HELD ON INCEST CHARGE AMID PROTESTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Colo., Switzerland)  (bl) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ The case of an 11-year-old Swiss-American boy charged
with aggravated incest has spawned an international dispute over
the treatment of children in the American justice system.
</P>
<P>
   The boy, identified only by his first name, Raoul, is accused of
making inappropriate sexual contact with his 5-year-old sister when
the children were in their yard. On Tuesday, after a hearing, a
Jefferson County juvenile magistrate set an arraignment date of
Nov. 8, and the boy was released into foster care. The boy's
lawyer, Arnold Wegher, said the child would plead not guilty.
</P>
<P>
   The boy had been living with his mother, stepfather, 13-year-old
sister and two half-sisters, ages 5 and 3, in Evergreen, about 30
miles west of Denver. A neighbor, Laura Mehmert, testified at the
hearing that in May she saw the boy touching the younger girl's
genitals with his face and hands. After speaking with the boy's
mother, the neighbor reported the incident to the authorities.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 30, the boy was arrested and led in handcuffs from his
home. Since then, he has been held without bail in a county
juvenile center.
</P>
<P>
   Manuel Sager, a spokesman for the Swiss Embassy in Washington,
said the circumstances of the boy's arrest ``seemed
disproportionate to us to the charges.'' He said the boy was
brought into the courtroom in handcuffs and ``foot chains.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the Jefferson County district attorney's
office said the use of restraints was ``standard procedure.''
</P>
<P>
   If the boy, who has dual U.S. and Swiss citizenship, is found
guilty, he could face up to two years in a juvenile center.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a travesty,'' said Hanspeter Spuhler, director of
the Denver-based Swiss-American Friendship Society, and a friend of
the boy's family. ``The reason why it's such a big deal to the
Swiss and the Europeans is because this is part of growing up,
playing doctor or something. If indeed he touched her
inappropriately, then it will be talked over with the parents.''
</P>
<P>
   Spuhler said the boy's parents had fled to Switzerland with
their other children out of fear that their three daughters would
also be taken from them. He said the parents were seeking help from
the Swiss government to have their son returned.
</P>
<P>
   Spuhler joined protesters in front of the Jefferson County
courthouse Tuesday during the hearing, where the case was being
covered by more than two dozen European journalists.

DESPITE HER EFFORTS, DOLE WAS DEFINED BY GENDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As hard as Elizabeth H. Dole tried to make her bid
for the GOP presidential nomination more than one-dimensional, she
still was defined by her gender and could not jump the barrier of
being the only woman in the race.
</P>
<P>
   That was clear from the way the news media described and
questioned her, the way curious young women with instant cameras
would flock around her, and the way she failed to tap into the
network of rich male donors who supported the candidacy of her
husband, Bob Dole, in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Polls say a sizable majority of Americans are ready to put a
woman in the White House. But analysts say that as long as there is
only one female in the contest, the novelty of her gender will
probably overshadow the substance and the message that would
attract financial support and votes.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Dole turned it into a men-only race, announcing
that a lack of money made it impossible for her to continue. She
said she did not think women would be discouraged by her
withdrawing because ``I think what we've done is pave the way for
the person who will be the first woman president. I'm just
delighted by what has happened because I feel like we've really
made a great contribution.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Hawkesworth, director of the Center for American Women and
Politics at Rutgers University, called Dole ``extraordinarily
brave'' but was sorry to see her abandon her race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly am discouraged,'' Hawkesworth said. ``Dole was
trying to mobilize young women voters who haven't been actively
involved in politics. To have a woman capture that excitement is
terrific to see. To have it knocked out by the power of money is a
sad thing to watch.''
</P>
<P>
   Dole isn't the first White House 2000 aspirant to drop out, but
unlike her rivals and unlike any female candidates before, Dole
targeted her fund-raising on women. She was not unsuccessful _ she
raised almost 50 percent of her $5 million from women. But that
only enhanced the perception that gender was the focus of Dole's
candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Dole denied she was running as a woman candidate, though she
always ended her stump speech with a reference to how she was
``making history.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, she said she had been trying to reach out to women.
``It's almost as if you see some women sit up a little straighter
because you're trying to empower them to understand that they can
do it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Former US Representative Patricia Schroeder, who made a
short-lived run in the 1988 White House race, asked why this was
not translating into support, answered: ``Because she sent a
confusing message _ she said she wanted to make history, but no one
had seen her in the women's movement when it was making history.''
</P>
<P>
   There was also confusion about Dole's message. She said she was
not the women's candidate. But on a host of issues _ gun control,
education, school safety, controlling illegal drugs _ Dole hit all
the hot buttons that pollsters say appeal to women. She was also
cautious on what she said about abortion. She insisted she was
against abortion but quick to add she would not lead a charge as
president to restrict abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   She also seemed so feminine, telling little stories about her
house-husband in her honeyed drawl, color-coordinating her outfits,
and looking more like a candidate for president of the Republican
women's club than president of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elizabeth Dole had problems beyond money, a bumpy
organization, and a failure to capitalize on her standing in the
polls,'' said Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a political scientist at
Claremont Graduate University. ``I don't think she was comfortable
in her own skin.''
</P>
<P>
   Marie Wilson, president of the White House Project, a group
aiming to elect a woman president, said the fact that Dole was
taken seriously and that she ``brought women out of the woodwork''
helped to lower the bar for future women candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``But until we have more than one woman in the race, her agenda
will be muted by gender,'' Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   Over and over Dole said she was not in the race to become some
other nominee's running mate. But Wednesday analysts handicapped
her as a likely No. 2 precisely because she is attractive to women
and has not taken feminist positions that alienate the Christian
right or antiabortion activists.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Republicans want to do something about the gender gap,
Dole absolutely would be a very smart choice,'' said Elizabeth
Sherman, director of the Center for Women in Politics and Public
Policy at the University of Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Harrington, Dole's press secretary, said Dole
``honestly hasn't thought about it. She will measure her ability to
make a difference, that's what matters to her.''
</P>
<P>
   Geraldine Ferraro, who was the vice presidential candidate on
the Democratic ticket in 1984, said, ``It's garbage'' to say voters
won't support a woman candidate. ``Did Dan Quayle drop out because
voters wouldn't support a male? Did Lamar Alexander drop out
because voters wouldn't support a candidate with a Southern
accent?'' Ferraro said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed Dole decided not to continue. I would have
loved to see her debate the other guys in New Hampshire because she
knows more than any of them,'' she said.

<P>
   CORWIN: O.K. Give me 30 minutes of air time, Walter Cronkite and
Elmer Bernstein and call me in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   Not much of a stretch, this little scene. For more than 60
years, Norman Corwin's radio dramas about the human condition and
the state of the planet _ America, in particular _ have helped
shape the public perception of who we are and what we're doing
here. Through war and peace, Corwin opened his microphone to big
thoughts and the common man: freedom, loyalty, courage, fear,
despair, triumph. For nine years at CBS _ 1938 to 1947 _ he
presided over national catharsis at the radio console.
</P>
<P>
   And now, with the last 1,000 years to look back on, Corwin has
come up with ``Memos to a New Millennium,'' a half-hour script he
calls a meditation for radio. Underwritten by the Corporation for
Public Broadcasting, it will be distributed nationally at year's
end by Public Radio International.
</P>
<P>
   But its premiere will be Tuesday evening at the Museum of
Television and Radio, in Manhattan, followed by a discussion
featuring Corwin, who is flying in from his home in Los Angeles,
and Cronkite, who narrates the piece.
</P>
<P>
   Corwin's ``Memos'' are not prescriptions from the perspective of
his long life, 89 years so far, or his illustrious career as
dramatist or propagandist for the good guys and the right stuff.
He's too smart to make predictions for the next thousand years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking back on predictions, you and I know for a certainty,''
Corwin said in an interview last week, ``that nothing's going to
change overnight. But the logic finally asserts itself.'' His
memos, then, are offered as hopes for the coming 365,000 or so
days: keeping the peace, cleaning the environment and giving
shelter.
</P>
<P>
   With a ghostly trumpet fanfare scored by Elmer Bernstein,
Cronkite, in the familiar voice that is itself a kind of studio
sound effect, starts his narration slowly: ``The new millennium.
Say it slowly. It will be with us for the next 1,000 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the birth of Jesus and the calendar that brings us
to the year 20 centuries into the present, he continues: ``It was
one of very few global covenants ever made without having to fight
over it. Not everybody was satisfied with the arrangement, but
right now, this being the last day, you have only to put a simple
question to every knowing civilization in the atlas. Ask them what
date they will print in their newspapers tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   An actress' voice says, ``Jan. 1, 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Cronkite follows up, ``Even though the new millennium will have
arrived on schedule and to nobody's surprise, it will be the
biggest of all late-breaking news.''
</P>
<P>
   News, especially breaking news, was where Norman Corwin began
his career but not always where his mind and heart wandered. A
Bostonian by birth, Corwin finished high school and went to work
almost immediately for a small Massachusetts paper, The Greenfield
Daily Recorder. He joined The Springfield Daily Republican two
years later, in 1929, where besides covering courts and the police,
he became radio editor.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A stint on a local station in Massachusetts and in Cincinnati
adapting, writing and reciting poetry in 15-minute broadcasts
eventually got him to CBS in New York.
</P>
<P>
   At CBS, Corwin was often given free rein to write, cast and
direct radio dramas as well as several landmark patriotic programs
that continue to be studied and marveled at in radio-journalism
classrooms today.
</P>
<P>
   Among them were ``We Hold These Truths,'' an all-star program
that featured Orson Welles, James Stewart (then an Army Air Corps
corporal), Edward G. Robinson, Lionel Barrymore and Walter Huston
in a coast-to-coast, four-network extravaganza to commemorate the
150th anniversary of the Bill of Rights. But eight days before the
broadcast, the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, so the show served
at least two purposes: a group hug to a frightened America and a
call to arms for the sake of liberty and security.
</P>
<P>
   Corwin orchestrated similar programs with nationalistic themes
for V-E Day and V-J Day. His dramas derided fascism and cheered on
Allied soldiers, sailors, marines and airmen. Other productions,
like ``The Plot to Overthrow Christmas'' (Will Geer as the Devil in
an unsuccessful attempt to assassinate Santa Claus) and ``The
Undecided Molecule,'' about a molecule ``that couldn't make up its
mind what phylum it wanted to be assigned'' (Groucho Marx portrayed
the judge at the molecule's trial) were bright and inventive in
ways uniquely Corwin.
</P>
<P>
   He adapted works by Carl Sandburg and Edgar Lee Masters and made
the language of the Bible, Shakespeare and Whitman the common
currency of his research and writing.
</P>
<P>
   At CBS, Corwin was largely free to write, direct and produce in
the artistic or public service vein that shielded him from the
pressures of advertising agencies, sponsors and broadcasting
executives.
</P>
<P>
   Corwin considers himself blessed to have landed at CBS, because
``at that time, and at no time since, or in any other radio entity,
it was possible for a writer like myself to have complete autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the prime examples of that is when CBS asked me to do a
program commemorating the end of the war in Europe, `On a Note of
Triumph.' They said, `We are going to requisition an hour of
commercial time for you to do the program. They never asked me for
a first draft; they never asked what my approach would be; they
didn't ask me to send them the first 20 pages; they didn't ask who
I was going to use in the cast. The first time any of the hierarchy
heard it was when it was on the air.''
</P>
<P>
   Corwin, who has taught telecommunications and journalism at the
University of Southern California since 1970, said that within five
years of that broadcast ``radio became more guarded.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he has published 17 books, written plays and stories
and lectured for decades, the radio is home. ``Memos to a New
Millennium,'' is, in fact, the sixth in a series called ``More by
Corwin,'' an undertaking for public radio commissioned by his
collaborator and producer Mary Beth Kirchner.
</P>
<P>
   With easygoing chauvinism, he added: ``In radio, there was never
a term equivalent to boob tube or couch potato. The eye is so
literal, whereas the ear makes a participant of the listener. The
listener becomes the set designer, the wardrobe mistress, the
casting director. You can listen to `Carmen' on radio. Carmen in
person may weigh 350 pounds, but to the listener she's a beautiful,
steamy lady with a rose in her teeth.''
</P>
<P>
   So Corwin is a romantic? ``Yes, but not religiously so.'' And an
optimist? ``I would say not an optimist as much as an
affirmationist. I believe in affirming what is valuable. I believe
America should remind itself of who it is and how it began.''

INCREASE BELIES VULNERABILITY OF TECH STOCKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The technology-heavy Nasdaq stock index rose 3.72 percent
Wednesday, its fourth-biggest percentage gain this year.
</P>
<P>
   Judging by the Nasdaq alone, technology stocks are still on a
roll. Amid concerns about inflation, an overpriced stock market,
and the new millennium, the index reached an all-time high of
2915.95 last week.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's rise of 99.95 points erased part of the loss in the
index since then. The index closed at 2788.13. But the Nasdaq, on
closer inspection, is increasingly being pulled up by a few heavy
hitters, such as Microsoft Corp. and Cisco Systems.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the broad index, a raft of technology companies _ and not
just Internet companies _ have shed 20 percent to almost 60 percent
of their value since reaching highs earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Across the board right now, tech stocks are under pressure,''
said Mark Minervini, chief investment strategist for Quantech
Research Group.
</P>
<P>
   Several major computer firms have suffered steep falls from
their levels early this year. They are among the workhorses that
money managers a year ago were hailing as unstoppable leaders of a
rising market.
</P>
<P>
   Based on Wednesday's closing prices, Dell Computer Corp. has
dropped 26 percent from its 1999 high; Intel Corp., 22 percent;
Unisys Corp., 51 percent; Compaq Computer Corp., 59 percent; and
Lucent Technologies Inc., 27 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these stocks staged short rallies in late summer but
have fallen further since.
</P>
<P>
   If the once high-flying tech sector is in the midst of a huge
pullback, as pessimists think, its impact would go far beyond the
Nasdaq. The sector has grown to more than 22 percent of the value
of the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 stock index, up from 8 percent just
six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The S&AMP;P 500 gained 28.11 points Wednesday, or 2.2 percent, to
1289.43. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 187.43 points, or
1.8 percent, to close at 10,392.36. IBM Corp. and Hewlett-Packard
Co. are the only pure technology stocks among the Dow30.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, the largest company by market value, contributed most
to gains Wednesday in both the Nasdaq and S&AMP;P 500.
</P>
<P>
   Kathryn Kirk disagrees with the pessimists. A managing director
in the Boston office of Hambrecht &AMP; Quist, Kirk sees the high-tech
sector heading in one direction in the long term: up. ``We're
surrounded by technology in our everyday lives,'' she said. ``I
think we're in a great secular growth trend for tech long-term.''
</P>
<P>
   Then why is the stock price for Compaq Computer Corp. about 59
percent below its all-time high, reached on Jan. 26, of 49 1/4?
Compaq closed Wednesday at 20 3/16.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq, one of the world's largest makers of personal computers,
has struggled for months. But a warning by the Houston company last
week that the recent earthquake in Taiwan may make it more
difficult for the company to fill orders for personal computers
caused its stock to drop again.
</P>
<P>
   L. Emerson Tuttle, portfolio manager for State Street Global
Advisors, traces the tech shares' woes back to last April when many
investors moved into lower-priced cyclical stocks. ``This has been
a market in which investors have been very unforgiving of any
company that provides even a whiff of bad news,'' Tuttle said.
</P>
<P>
   Small firms can be more vulnerable to bad news, creating a
market in which companies either hit home runs and their stock
soars or are eclipsed by competitors, causing their shares to drop.
</P>
<P>
   As the Nasdaq has charged higher each month, individual tech
stocks that are small to midsize have declined steadily. Since
highs reached during 1998, Avid Technology Inc., which is in the
digital entertainment business, and Cambridge Technology Partners,
a computer consultant, are among those whose stocks have sunk,
respectively, 31 percent and 74 percent.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, other small firms, particularly in the software
industry, have been hit. Since reaching an all-time high in
September, Houston-based BMC Software Inc.'s stock has fallen
nearly 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Disappointing profits are to blame for declines in some stocks.
Drops in Intel's and Dell's shares followed recent predictions that
third-quarter profits would be disappointing.
</P>
<P>
   For the tech sector overall, however, earnings are very strong.
</P>
<P>
   The 32 tech companies in the S&AMP;P 500 that have announced
third-quarter earnings posted profits that are a total of 34
percent higher than they were last year, according to First
Call/Thomson Financial Corp. Revenues are 11 percent higher.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft used the word ``awesome'' to describe sales of
personal computers in the third quarter, which pushed up its
revenues and profits.
</P>
<P>
   Technology companies ``are having a good quarter,'' said Ken
Perkins, analyst.
</P>
<P>
   But Tim Ghriskey, a senior portfolio manager for Dreyfus Corp.,
said investors these days flee technology stocks if their earnings
are anything less than awesome.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shoot-now-ask-questions-later mentality,'' he said.
``If there's any bad news, even if it's explainable, the market
doesn't want to hear it.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the vulnerability of tech stocks, Ghriskey said, are
the extremely high valuations of many stocks _ ranging from 37
times forecast earnings in 2000 for Dell to 128 times 2000 earnings
for America Online Inc.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, the S&AMP;P 500 is priced at 23 times its year 2000
earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker Walsh, an associate portfolio manager who invests in
small technology firms for State Street Research &AMP; Management Co.,
said increasingly he is hunting for companies with unique products
that are immune to the competition coming from newly capitalized
companies that come into the market to take on the market leaders.
</P>
<P>
   There are gems to be found, he said. But the high valuations of
many stocks make more difficult his decision about when or whether
to invest.

 &HT;    NAACP may focus on BMW, Michelin in boycott against S.C. flag
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The NAACP is ready to shift gears in its economic
boycott of South Carolina, a plan designed to force the Confederate
battle flag from the top of the state Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   As early as this afternoon, when the South Carolina Conference
of the NAACP convenes its annual meeting in North Carolina,
delegates may drive a new symbol into the fray: BMW's Z3 roadster
and the company's new X5 sport utility vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Since July, the South Carolina NAACP has relied on a tourism
boycott focused on beaches from Charleston to Myrtle Beach. Last
week, the national NAACP formally endorsed a boycott of the state
beginning in January.
</P>
<P>
   The BMW vehicles are manufactured near Greenville, S.C., the
``business capital'' of the state, said Nina Brook, press secretary
for the state's governor, Jim Hodges. NAACP officials also hinted
that Michelin North America Inc., which makes Uniroyal and
BFGoodrich tires throughout South Carolina, is a potential target.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone talks about BMW and Michelin in all of this,'' said
James Gallman, president of the NAACP's South Carolina conference.
``Whatever is at the top, we'll take a look at. I'm not discounting
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   However, as boycotts broaden, the less effective they become,
said Donald Ratajczak, director of the Economic Forecasting Center
at Georgia State University.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure BMW is quaking at its potential sales loss,''
Ratajczak said.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Hitt, a spokesman for BMW Manufacturing Corp. in Greer,
S.C., said the company will steer clear of the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the business of building cars,'' Hitt said Wednesday.
``We don't get involved in political positions. We didn't get
involved in video poker. We didn't get involved in abortion. We've
only been here six years. The debate has been going on for more
than 20 years and has roots more than a century old. It doesn't
seem appropriate for us to get involved in the debate.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Michelin has worked toward a compromise that
would display the Confederate flag in a memorial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michelin is very interested in finding a way to resolve this
issue so all parties concerned are satisfied,'' said Jim Morton, a
company spokesman. ``People do not forget a boycott.''
</P>
<P>
   The South Carolina resolution adopted Saturday by the NAACP
national board calls for economic sanctions Jan. 1. But several
groups, most of them with predominantly black memberships, already
have canceled meetings in the state. South Carolina tourism
officials still are trying to figure the exact dollar impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to bring tourism in the state to its knees,''
said Lou Fontana, a South Carolina tourism spokesman. ``But they
don't mind kicking us in the shins. It hurts.''
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature hoisted the Confederate flag over the State
House in 1962 to commemorate the centennial of the Civil War, which
saw its first shots fired in South Carolina. The red flag with its
blue X and white stars has flown there ever since.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is different than in Georgia,'' where the Confederate
emblem is incorporated into the design of the state flag, said
Democrat Tom Turnipseed, who ran unsuccessfully for state attorney
general last year. ``We have the Confederate flag over the State
House.''
</P>
<P>
   Viewed as a political fulcrum, BMW and Michelin sit in the back
yard of state House Speaker David Wilkins. But the top Republican
at the State House says there's no political will to move the flag
from atop the capitol, especially under threat by the NAACP.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a two-edged sword,'' said Wilkins, reached Wednesday at a
conference of state House speakers in San Antonio. ``While (the
boycott) is of great concern to all of us, people are not going to
do anything while there's a boycott. People resent being pushed
into a corner.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilkins always has voted to keep the Confederate symbol flying.
He voted against a proposal that would have moved it to a memorial.
</P>
<P>
   ``It represented part of our heritage, and I felt no reason to
make any changes,'' Wilkins said.
</P>
<P>
   When Republican David Beasley, voted out of the governor's
mansion last year, proposed moving the flag to a memorial site,
conservatives ended their allegiance to him.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's spokeswoman criticized Wilkins for not working
toward a compromise.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor doesn't feel there's enough support in the House
for removal of the Confederate flag to be viable this year,'' said
Brook. ``The business community says the flag should move, but it's
just not worked its way through, especially to the majority party
in the House ... Legislative reservation is a major road block.''

 WASHINGTON: things up.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mrs. Dole spoke fervently of the historic nature of her campaign
and the excitement she generated among many women, who often
brought their daughters to meet her. But she rejected the
suggestion that she was running as a woman and her message was
uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster based in Atlanta, said that
being female was a plus for Mrs. Dole. ``There was some grumbling
that people were more reluctant to give to a woman, but it gave her
a certain cachet among Republican primary voters and got her more
attention than she might otherwise have gotten,'' he said. ``She
excited moderate and conservative women, and it's a shame she
couldn't have leveraged that cachet into serious contention.''
</P>
<P>
   Another drawback was that she had never been elected to public
office. Only Dwight D. Eisenhower and Herbert Hoover have been
elected president without running for office before.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Mrs. Dole's pollster, Linda DiVall, said that in a
hypothetical match-up with the Democratic frontrunner, Vice
President Al Gore, Mrs. Dole was leading, 44 percent to 37 percent.
Bush leads Gore by even wider margins in most polls, but Ms.
DiVall's point was that only in a primary so skewed by Bush's
outsized bankroll and sweep of endorsements does Mrs. Dole look
wanting.
</P>
<P>
   ``She will clearly go down in history for running a serious and
substantive campaign,'' Ms. DiVall said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Until now, women had run for president as little more than
tokens of protest. The Equal Rights Party began running female
candidates in 1872, to little notice. It was not until 1964 that a
woman, Sen. Margaret Chase Smith of Maine, was nominated at a major
party convention. She received 27 votes at the Republican
convention, then withdrew after the first ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Shirley Chisholm of New York became the first woman and the
first black woman actually to campaign for the nomination of a
major party. In 1972 she earned 151 delegates through the
Democratic primaries and caucuses. This was only a fraction of the
total, but unlike Elizabeth Dole, Ms. Chisholm at least had her
name on the ballot in several states.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Mrs. Dole, a former Cabinet secretary and Harvard-trained
lawyer, was the first woman to be perceived as a serious
presidential prospect. As she said on Wednesday, ``What we've done
is paved the way for the person who will be the first woman
president.'' And there is much speculation now whether she would
consider the vice presidential nomination or at least a position in
a Republican Cabinet. She demurred on Wednesday, but did not rule
out accepting the number-two spot.
</P>
<P>
   Ayres said that Mrs. Dole was a serious prospect for vice
president but added: ``She is a higher-risk choice now because you
won't know how she would react in the heat of a campaign as a
candidate.''

 Jamie Malanowski's most recent article for Arts &AMP; Leisure was about
the movie ``Dick.''  
 By JAMIE MALANOWSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's not hard to believe that any director, even a veteran
director, would feel butterflies at his first meeting with Meryl
Streep, especially if that gold-standard actress was considering
taking the lead in his new film.
</P>
<P>
   Forgiveness could be granted if he felt obliged to mention his
credits, refer to his grosses, point to the performances he had
wrung over the years from Johnny Depp, Sharon Stone and Eddie
Murphy, among others.
</P>
<P>
   But this time the director had something else on his mind. ``The
first thing I did,'' admits Wes Craven, ``was try to make her feel
like she'd be working with someone who had a brain in his head and
normalcy to his life.''
</P>
<P>
   Displaying ``a brain'' and ``normalcy'' is usually an achievable
goal for a vertebrate, even for ones who work in Hollywood, but
Craven of course has for a quarter century been famously producing
work less known for brains and normalcy than for viscera and
extremes.
</P>
<P>
   From his cringingly inexpert yet profitable debut with ``The
Last House on the Left'' (1972), the story of a Manson-like family
of killers and the vengeance that is wreaked upon them, through the
imaginatively sinister and profitable ``A Nightmare on Elm Street''
(1984), which established the teen-age horror movie genre, and on
to the witty and profitable ``Scream'' (1996) and ``Scream 2''
(1997), the second amusingly deconstructing the first, Craven could
always be counted on to spill an audience-pleasing ocean of blood.
But his success had the effect of placing him in a sanguine
straightjacket.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the beginning, I had never really intended to do
horror,'' says Craven, who is the kind of person _ tall, lean,
soft-spoken, modest, 50ish, neatly bearded, professorial,
Midwestern _ that you might believe is repressing a kink or two but
not a ravenous appetite for the macabre. ``All of a sudden, after
`Last House on the Left,' I was a maker of scary movies. It
immediately cut off any perception that I was capable of something
different.''
</P>
<P>
   This was a source of no small amount of frustration for him over
the years, as producers and studios ruled him out of consideration
for projects merely because of the images his name conjured up. But
fortunately for him, the success that so long pigeonholed him
eventually sprang him.
</P>
<P>
   Craven's new movie, ``Music of the Heart,'' which opens Friday,
stars Ms. Streep as a music teacher in East Harlem. It is based on
a true story, is chock-full of feet-on-the-ground characters and
has heart and grit and genuine warmth. And while there's a lot of
sawing in the movie, it's done not with Freddie Krueger's
fingernails but with horsehair bows.
</P>
<P>
   Craven's moment of liberation came during dinner at Harry
Cipriani's, a Manhattan restaurant, after ``Scream'' came out.
Craven, his longtime producer Maryanne Maddelena and others who'd
worked on the Miramax production, were celebrating the success of
the movie, when, quite unexpectedly, in came the maharajahs of
Miramax, Bob and Harvey Weinstein.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps,'' says Craven, ``because I had been speaking a lot in
the press about hoping to make whatever picture I was working be
the last one in the horror genre, and they wanted more out of me,
they made a very canny offer.'' Hoping no doubt to keep their
lucrative ``Elm Street''-like franchise from evaporating, the
Weinsteins, with characteristic bravura, spread their development
schedule across the table. ``They offered me a deal for three
pictures,'' recalls Craven, ``one of which could be a nongenre
film, and that film could be anything on their schedule.'' Dinner
did not proceed much farther before Craven was focusing on a
project called ``Fifty Violins.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of those flukes,'' says Craven. ``Some years
earlier I had had some time, so I signed up to be on the Academy of
Motion Picture Arts and Sciences prescreening committee in the
documentary category.'' There he first saw ``Small Wonders,'' which
would become a 1996 Oscar-nominated documentary.
</P>
<P>
   It is the story of Roberta Guaspari, a high school violin
teacher, and of how her music program was saved from the budget ax
by a benefit concert at Carnegie Hall that featured not only Ms.
Guaspari's current and former students but eight prominent
admirers, including Isaac Stern, Itzhak Perlman and Arnold
Steinhardt.
</P>
<P>
   Craven _ former teacher, classical music devotee, Guaspari
enthusiast, artist in search of an antipodal project _ saw his
destiny. ``The guys ran down the list of properties, and I said,
`That's the one!'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Music of the Heart'' _ the title ``Fifty Violins'' was
scrapped after research showed potential audience members were
reluctant to see a Meryl Streep movie that had violins in the
title, fearing it would be, as Craven puts it, ``either something
very sad or incredibly erudite'' _ will inevitably be compared to
``Mr. Holland's Opus,'' Disney's successful 1995 foray into
``Goodbye, Mr. Chips'' territory.
</P>
<P>
   But though both are about high school music teachers, they're
different in tone and approach. ``Mr. Holland's Opus'' is a warm
story that follows a teacher over the years as he develops his
inner mensch-hood. ``Music of the Heart'' is far more realistic and
far less contrived.
</P>
<P>
   In the film, Ms. Guaspari is a gifted teacher with a sometimes
prickly and imperious personality, one who shows no reluctance to
toss the lackadaisical and ditsy out of her class. She also has a
healthy ration of problems that she just has to deal with _ men,
children, mother, co-workers, building renovation, parking tickets
_ all of which are pretty much based on fact.
</P>
<P>
   Pamela Gray, the screenwriter who also wrote ``A Walk On The
Moon,'' ``virtually moved in with Roberta for a month,'' says
Craven, ``and she just let her hair down about the most intimate
details of her life, many of them revealing and not very glamorous,
like her unsuccessful attempts with men and the pain of her
divorce.'' What comes across very clearly is a very realistic and
likable person who has found in music a way she and others can deal
with the challenges life presents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember the first conversation I had with her,'' Craven
said. ``I said, `You must be so proud to have kids playing in the
Denver Philharmonic and elsewhere,' and she said: `It's O.K., but
it's not the most important thing. I'm teaching them how to play
their lives.' She said the violin is a terribly difficult
instrument, but life is a much more difficult instrument.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said: `Everything I teach _ discipline, how to stand, how
to stand strong, how to learn the rudiments before you try anything
more, to be responsible for the tone you make _ is teaching them to
play their lives better. I teach them that you have to learn the
process, and that it's difficult, but you also get that knowledge
that people have been there before you, and that they've figured
out certain things you can do that are better than other things,
and if you put in the time and you put in the discipline, you give
yourself a leg up on life.'''

MANAGING EDITOR OF TEXAS PAPER TO LEAD FREE PRESS ORGANIZATION

c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Managing Editor Tony Pederson of the Houston Chronicle
took over as president of the Inter American Press Association on
Wednesday night, pledging to continue an ``unflinching, unrelenting
and uncompromising'' fight for media freedom in the hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   Pederson, 48, closed the 55th assembly of the association by
recognizing journalists who have died while doing their jobs,
including Philip True, the San Antonio Express News reporter killed
last year in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Pederson noted that many of the journalists at the Houston
meeting had been victims of violence or forced from their home
countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are real heroes among those here who have been a part of
the historic fight for a free press in the Americas,'' Pederson
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We owe those heroes past and present nothing less,'' than to
fight against threats against journalists, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Pederson also promised to continue pressuring Cuban President
Fidel Castro to increase press liberty on the island.
</P>
<P>
   His speech came after an awards ceremony in which True's wife,
Martha, received an IAPA grand prize for his work. Philip's infant
son, Philip Jr., who was born after Philip was murdered last
December while hiking in central Mexico, was also present at the
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL; 
Martha True thanked the organization for the honor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I receive it in his name, in the name of his son and in the
name of all those who have lost their lives working as
journalists,'' she said in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The press association also gave its Freedom of the Press award
to four Cuban dissidents who were imprisoned for producing a
political flyer calling for increased freedom.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL; 
One of the four sent a letter of thanks from his jail cell in
Ariza, Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope we can be there next year to thank you personally for
this award,'' wrote Vladimiro Roca.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The IAPA, which represents 1,300 news agencies from throughout
the Americas, also produced a final set of resolutions Wednesday,
condemning continued problems for journalists throughout the
region.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution noted that seven journalists have died in the 12
months since its last annual assembly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even in democratic nations, politicians uneasy with a free and
independent press are using every means at their disposal to
silence or pressure their critics and limit the watchdog role of
the media,'' the resolution said.
</P>
<P>
   The IAPA also noted that Venezuela represents a ``disturbingly
new'' threat to press freedom.
</P>
<P>
   A leftist Army leader, Hugo Chavez, was elected president of
Venezuela last year. His allies are now rewriting the country's
constitution, and press freedom appears at risk.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Pederson said the IAPA will likely send a
mission to Venezuela next month to lobby for journalists there. He
also said he would like to send a mission to Cuba, though he
doubted Fidel Castro would allow it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am particularly concerned about Cuba,'' Pederson said.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Waco, Texas, Pederson graduated from Baylor before
receiving a masters degree in journalism from Ohio State
University. He was sports editor at the Chronicle before being
named managing editor in 1983. He is now vice president and
managing editor of the paper.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fluent in Spanish, Pederson attended his first IAPA meeting a
decade ago, but was skeptical at first, based on what he had heard.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rap against the IAPA at the time was that it was a group
of rich and conservative Latin American newspaper owners who were
more interested in promoting their own business than in preserving
freedom of the press,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But after getting to know the organization, Pederson discovered
that many of its members were serious journalists who had risked
their lives to tell the truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I started to appreciate were the stories,'' he said.
``People losing their family, going to jail.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he hopes his one-year term as president will do at least
some help bringing new freedom throughout the Americas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Journalism is part of the greatest freedom people are given,''
he said, ``the freedom of speech.''

`BACKUP' IS ON A ROLL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE BURRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ His work title is backup catcher. Despite his extra
duties of late, and his exceptional job in carrying out those
duties, Atlanta upstart Eddie Perez has no illusions. He said when
starter Javy Lopez returns to the team when his knee is healthy, he
will return to the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Even if he is the reigning Most Valuable Player of the National
League Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   Perez was 10 for 20 in six games with two home runs and five
RBIs. His last hit of the series, a one-out single, came in the
eighth inning Tuesday. Otis Nixon pinch-ran, stole second, went to
third on a throwing error, and scored the tying run on Brian
Hunter's single.
</P>
<P>
   Three innings later, Kenny Rogers walked in the winning run and
the Braves were headed back to the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the biggest thing that happened to me,'' Perez said.
``Now I've gotten the chance to play and win the National League
Championship. And hopefully, this will be my biggest moment, the
next step.''
</P>
<P>
   If Lopez can't return next spring, the Braves know they won't
have to go shopping for a quality catcher. They will only need to
change Perez's job description.
</P>
<P>
   The 31-year old catcher from Cuidad Ojeda, Venezuela, who was
used primarily as Greg Maddux's catcher (catching all 33 of
Maddux's starts this season), is making the most in Lopez's
absence. Perez started a career-high 86 games this season and set
career-highs in games (104), at-bats (309), runs (30), and hits
(77). He threw out 21 of 72 base stealers.
</P>
<P>
   But it is the postseason where Perez has shone. He homered in
the first two games of the National League Championship Series,
when he went 7 for 10.
</P>
<P>
   In Game 1, Perez belted a sixth-inning homer off Pat Mahomes for
the decisive run in the Braves' 4-2 triumph.
</P>
<P>
   In Game 2, Perez hit a home run off Kenny Rogers in the sixth
after Brian Jordan's two-run home run tied the game. Perez's shot
put the Braves up 4-2 in a 4-3 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still the backup catcher,'' said Perez, who has been the
starter since his friend Lopez suffered a partial anterior cruciate
ligament tear in his right knee in July. Perez hit .249 during the
season with seven home runs and 30 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just doing the job because Javy is not here. That's why
I'm backup catching. But I think my knee is worse than Javy's
knees.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez, who was on the disabled list from Aug. 30 to Sept. 14,
1996, with a torn right quad muscle, said he will have offseason
surgery because of tendinitis in both knees.
</P>
<P>
   But until then he hopes to help the Braves in their march toward
another title. ``This year I don't think I'm doing the job I want
to do at hitting, but I'm concentrating more, and catching, because
we've got a good pitching staff,'' said Perez. ``That's what I'm
trying to do. When it's time to hit, I hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Prior to this season, Perez was best known for the grand slam in
the eighth inning off then-Cub closer Rod Beck to give the Braves a
6-0 lead in the clinching Game 3 of the NL Division Series last
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year was in the first round, this is in the second
round,'' said Perez, when asked to compare the home run off Rogers
to the one off Beck. ``This is a lot better, and especially against
a pitcher who was throwing _ I was, like, 0 for 100 against that
guy _ and I finally got a hit. It was very good.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez might draw comparisons to former Braves star Francisco
Cabrera, a reserve known for a ninth-inning, two-out, two-run,
pinch-hit RBI single in the deciding game of the 1992 NLCS.
</P>
<P>
   But like Cabrera, Perez has had other quality moments as a
reserve. Last year, in his third full season, he batted a
career-high .336 and posted career-highs in RBIs (32), doubles (12)
and hits (50). He also recorded his first stolen base after 208
career games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, I put up good numbers,'' said Perez, who was signed
by the Braves as a free agent on Sept. 27, 1986.

 UNDATED: on life.'''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ms. Guaspari, by the way, also remembers her first meeting with
Craven warmly, though she allows: ``I was pretty leery. I hadn't
seen any of his pictures, but my sons explained who he was. It
seemed so absurd, so weird! But I had coffee with him, and he was
so gentle, and kind and sensitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Madonna was originally set to play Ms. Guaspari, but her
relationship with Craven was marked by creative differences of an
actually creative and not a National Enquirer sort.
</P>
<P>
   According to the director, Madonna wanted the story to focus
more on Ms. Guaspari's relationships with adults, particularly
boyfriends. ``We were not far from shooting, and she was calling
for more and more really quite drastic script changes,'' Craven
said. ``I felt if I went along with it I would be giving up control
of the picture I wanted to make, to make one Madonna would see but
that I wouldn't. And I thought, what was the point? I wasn't going
to come all this way and get my chance to make a nongenre film,
just to make somebody else's movie.''
</P>
<P>
   This placed the Weinsteins, who were trying to entice Madonna
into starring in a film version of ``Chicago,'' in a predicament,
but Miramax backed Craven, and Madonna departed. (Her withdrawal
from the project was an ``amicable decision,'' a spokeswoman for
Madonna said.)
</P>
<P>
   Over the next two months, Craven and Ms. Maddelena searched
furiously for a Roberta.
</P>
<P>
   ``Susan Sarandon was one of the people I thought would be good,
but she wasn't available. For about a week Julia Roberts was
interested in doing it, but she had a conflict with `Runaway
Bride.' We had always hoped Meryl would do it, but early on she had
said she was too tired.'' Meanwhile, the project was in free fall.
``We went from 70 staff members to two. We lost all the locations
and had to sell off our coffee makers. We were sharing our office
with another production, and we were two days from having to
vacate.''
</P>
<P>
   Craven approached Ms. Streep again in the form of a letter. ``I
poured out my heart to her,'' he said. ``I said I thought the story
of Roberta deserved to be told, and all these kids had worked so
hard and they were primed to go, and I desperately wanted to do
this, and I thought she was perfect for it, and would she please
reconsider.''
</P>
<P>
   He allows that at one point he even offered to mow her lawn for
her. With mere days to go before the project was to be shelved, Ms.
Streep reconsidered; she credits the letter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time Meryl met Roberta at my office,'' Craven
recalls, ``Meryl said to her, `Let's go into wardrobe.' After 10
minutes you could hear them laughing. And then they closed the
door. They were in there for three hours, and you could hear all
this laughing and loud voices, and while they were in there, they
completely told each other their lives. It was Meryl's way of
drawing everything out about this woman that was germane to this
role, and when she came out, she had Roberta cold. It was like she
had downloaded her.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Streep also undertook a crash course in the violin, her
success at which was demonstrated at the culmination of the shoot,
when the concert at Carnegie Hall scenes were filmed. ``Meryl took
her position for the first run-through, and as she did, she looked
over and saw Itzhak Perlman and Isaac Stern staring at her. It was
one of the few times I'd seen her shake. Of course, she did it
perfectly, and their jaws just dropped open. They said, `We can't
believe her, she's perfect, her form is perfect, how did you do
it?' Of course, it was all her.''
</P>
<P>
   The way Craven is tossing around compliments _ to Ms. Streep, to
Ms. Guaspari, to Miramax _ one might get the impression that he was
merely a very fortunate bystander. But in fact he ramrodded the
production, which included numerous scenes with a lot of tightly
scheduled amateur child actors and tightly scheduled professionals,
on time and under budget, while managing to help mold some
marvelous performances from his pros.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wes was generally very open to hearing how we wanted to do
things, which I like,'' said Aiden Quinn, who plays Roberta's love
interest in the film, ``but he was also sometimes very specific
about line readings, which I generally don't like, and which I
usually regard as a sign of an insecure director. But it was just
the opposite here. Every time he wanted that specificity, it was
because the rhythm of the scene was off and wasn't working. And
every time, what he wanted us to do brought the scene together.''
</P>
<P>
   Apart from keeping his fingers crossed for ``Music of the
Heart,'' Craven has been putting ``Scream 3'' through
post-production, as well as monitoring the release of his first
novel, ``The Fountain Society.'' The novel isn't quite a horror
story, but it does have clones, brain transplants, murder-mad
scientists and high-level government conspiracies.
</P>
<P>
   Film rights to the book have already been purchased by
Dreamworks SKG, and Craven will direct. Beyond that, is he
contemplating a return to scary subjects? Could be. ``I'd like to
explore something more personal,'' he says, ``perhaps divorce from
the father's side.''

 &HT;    Waters of Ganges River unrivaled for many Hindus
 &HT;    By Moni Basu
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Along the lanes of Calcutta's congested Kumartuli
neighborhood, artisans craft colossal idols of the goddess Durga
for one of India's biggest religious festivals. The mud they use to
mold their gaudy images comes from the Ganges River, which flows a
few hundred yards behind them.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of this week, public worship of the goddess of
strength will be over. The idols will be immersed in the river from
where they came to dissolve in the waters believed holy by Hindus _
symbolic of how, for many Indians, life begins and ends with the
Ganges.
</P>
<P>
   In the towns and cities that have grown up along its banks,
ancient rhythms go on, reflected in the daily ebb and flow of life
along the river.
</P>
<P>
   The Ganges supports more than 400 million Indians, in the most
populous river basin in the world. It provides irrigation for
agriculture, food from fisheries, transportation and trade.
</P>
<P>
   In Calcutta, when the river is not swollen with monsoon rains,
life bustles on its crowded, muddy banks. Under the shade of an old
railroad overpass, 33-year-old Ballav Sen lies on his back on a
slatted wooden mat just a few yards from water's edge.
</P>
<P>
   Sen, an orthodox Hindu, frequents the river to fetch water for
his home. To the Hindus, the Ganges, or Ganga as it is locally
known, is the holiest of rivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We respect Ganga jal (water),'' says Sen, as a professional
masseur works his body over. ``All the gods we worship depend on
Ganga jal. So I come here to take water home. When I have the time,
I get a massage.''
</P>
<P>
   Between Sen and the stone-paved accesses to the water, garbage
is strewn in the silt. Gentle waves lap piles of rotting marigold
garlands, cracked earthen urns and straw-filled skeletons of
immersed mud idols.
</P>
<P>
   None of the thousands gathered on the bank or ghat are bothered
by the debris.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not waste products,'' says Sen. ``What you see are
all natural products. After worshiping, we Hindus immerse figures
of the Gods into the Ganga. The straw, the bamboo, the flowers, the
urns, they are all left over from our pujas (ceremonial worship).''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Sen's claims, the waters of the Ganges in Calcutta are a
far cry from their pristine beginnings high up in the Himalayas.
Chemicals and human and animal waste make India's largest river
increasingly polluted in its 1,560-mile trip from the mountains
through the vast fertile plains to the Bay of Bengal just south of
here. Along its southward route, the Ganges picks up a
mind-boggling 343 million gallons of sewage and 687,000 gallons of
industrial waste per day from about 30 cities, 70 towns and
thousands of villages. In addition, the river accumulates thousands
of animal carcasses and the remains of dead Hindus, whose cremated
ashes are put into the river for spiritual salvation.
</P>
<P>
   But this does not matter to Sen and other Hindus. They believe
in the magical self-cleansing properties of the river they call
Mother Ganga.
</P>
<P>
   `it's a problem, I suppose. It is a fact the waters are
polluted and even dangerously polluted, but what can we do? It is
the Ganga, after all,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   A stone's throw away from the makeshift massage parlour, Khokon
Shai and his three brothers perform last rites for their father.
The Shai brothers have their heads shaved, make their offerings to
the departed soul and take a dip in the holy water. Their father's
ashes are scattered in the same water.
</P>
<P>
   No other water will do, says Khokon Shai.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have gathered here for a simple bath are oblivious to
the ritual around them. An old woman shuttles back and forth from
the river, wringing the water from the sari she has just washed.
Another woman shampoos her hair. Others clean their cooking
utensils.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, elevated ramps lead from ticket booths to the commuter
ferry docks. A million Calcuttans each day walk over the creaky
wooden paths at various ghats to board the ferries.
</P>
<P>
   Hari Chetri, a dock worker, uses the ferry to go back and forth
from work in the morning, at lunch and in the evening. The trip
from Babughat south to Shibpur takes him 13 minutes. By land, it
would take an hour and a half.
</P>
<P>
   Jibon Shardar prefers the 4 cent boat ride to a bus because of
Calcutta's pollution and horrific traffic, which averages just 5
miles per hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is so much more comfortable this way, isn't it? Especially
in the heat,'' he says aboard the Shibpur ferry.
</P>
<P>
   The boat is now midway in its crossing of the river. The water
glistens under the afternoon sun like a sheet of metal. To the
right, two barges carry bundles of straw down river. To the left,
the greenery along the once majestic Strand Road adds a bit of
welcome color to the dreary backdrop of Calcutta's skyline.
</P>
<P>
   Fishermen watch their nets that haul in the giant carp and other
fish that fill city markets every morning and evening.
</P>
<P>
   And at Babughat, a new set of bathers has descended to the muddy
shore, just as keen as the last group to take a dip in Ganga jal.

BLEDSOE'S FRUSTRATIONS RUN DEEP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH _ Patriots fans expect Bledsoe to win every week,
just as Red Sox fans expect Pedro Martinez to win every game he
pitches.
</P>
<P>
   The realists know this is not always going to happen. During the
course of making 35 starts, Martinez is not going to be on his
``A'' game in a half-dozen or so games. He might miss with a
breaking pitch on a full count, and instead of a strikeout, there's
a walk, and that leads to the other team ultimately scoring.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, Bledsoe hasn't been completely on his game. He's missing
deep. This is the strength of the Patriots' offense, the basic
element of it, really. The Patriots have speedsters in Terry Glenn,
Shawn Jefferson, and Tony Simmons who can blow away the opposition.
Two Sundays ago in a 16-14 loss in Kansas City, Bledsoe missed
Jefferson downfield twice, all alone for potential touchdowns. Last
Sunday, in a 31-30 loss to Miami, he missed Jefferson twice and
Glenn once, though he nailed Simmons on a 29-yard touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas City game was more understandable because he was
pressured, hit, and hurried beyond belief. Last week, the Patriots
had more protection, sometimes using seven players to block, and
were able to pick up the Dolphin blitzes. Bledsoe just missed his
targets, especially on third down when he converted only 2 of 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went in with a different emphasis in that we kept more guys
in to block,'' Bledsoe said. ``The pass protection was excellent.
But when we win battles down the field, it's my job to make the
throws and I didn't do that. This week (against) Denver), we have
to find a balance between keeping seven guys in or sending
everybody out. When my guys are open downfield, I have to hit
them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots have won the four games in which the ratio of
passes to runs was close, and have lost the games in which they had
to pass much more than they ran. It seems a simple prescription for
victory. Run it, even if you're only grinding out 2-3 yards at a
time. But you'll have to pardon offensive coordinator Ernie Zampese
and Bledsoe if they're tempted too much down the field. When
Jefferson is waving his arms because he's so loose and free, the
temptation is there.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what we do best,'' said Jefferson. ``Sure we need a
running game, every team does, but I think I've done the best I can
do as far as getting downfield and getting open. We've missed some
of those opportunities, but we'll have others we're not going to
miss. We just have to be consistent with it and things will happen
in our favor most of the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe is correct when he says the Patriots could have iced
Miami with just ``one or two'' more third-down conversions. And one
huge reason why they couldn't do it was the absence of wide
receiver Troy Brown, who missed the game with an ankle sprain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think particularly in this last game with the type of
coverage the Dolphins played against us, Troy would have made a big
impact in that game,'' Bledsoe said. ``He would have been good for
a couple of third-down conversions which is all we would have
needed to win the game. (Vincent) Brisby came in and did a great
job. Briz is a guy who would start for a lot of teams, but Troy's
ability as an inside receiver is unparalleled.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots tried moving Glenn inside a few times, but the
Dolphins anticipated the move by doubling Glenn with a linebacker
and a cornerback. Bledsoe admitted that when Glenn was outside, he
often drew single coverage and ``we should have exploited that more
than we did.'' Glenn did not make a catch against the Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   Every week brings a new set of problems. The revived Broncos are
probably going to copy much of what Miami did to Glenn, though
Brown has a chance of getting back on the field. If he does, he
should take care of the third-down issue. But if he doesn't, Glenn
and Brisby go back into Brown's role and they must be more
effective.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a different way and a different style, Brisby is very
effective,'' said Bledsoe. ``He's stronger and he can get
separation because of his strength. Briz will do a very good job
for us when he fills in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, Bledsoe and the Patriots must rediscover the middle
of the field.
</P>
<P>
   Hello, Ben Coates.
</P>
<P>
   There's no doubt now a coach or two must have gotten the ear of
the officials and told them to watch Coates. The Patriots tight end
has made his living catching the ball as he's being pushed and
shoved _ while also using his strength to get free. Now in search
of that freedom, he's being tagged by the officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a frustrating thing because Ben gets mugged all over the
field,'' said Bledsoe. ``On one play early in the (Miami) game,
(linebacker Zach Thomas) just grabbed him and prevented him from
making a play, and that doesn't get called. And then Ben gets
called for one that looked less severe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes what happens is when Ben is getting held, he'll talk
to the refs about it and then they'll start watching. And all of
sudden they'll see him do something and it works against him. Ben,
all (of) his career, has been good at getting free and he has to
continue to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe is calling Sunday's game ``critical'' for both teams.
The Patriots (4-2) have an 11-game losing streak against the
Broncos dating back to Sept. 29, 1980, when the Patriots beat the
visiting Broncos, 23-14, when the stadium was called Schaefer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have our work cut out for us,'' said Bledsoe. ``When we got
through the first four weeks, we hoped Denver would continue to
lose and it looked like they were a terrible team. That's not the
case now. Over the past two weeks they've looked like a very good
football team. I don't think anyone expected it.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Broncos (2-4) making changes at quarterback (Brian
Griese instead of John Elway), running back (Olandis Gary instead
of the injured Terrell Davis), and tight end (Dwyane Carswell and
Byron Chamberlain for the injured Shannon Sharpe), Bledsoe thinks
Denver looks the same on defense. Broncos defensive coordinator
Greg Robinson and Patriots coach Pete Carroll are friends and share
the same defensive philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understand what they're trying to do against us,'' said
Bledsoe. ``We can do some things scheme-wise. It's important to
establish the running game, balance in the offense. We're playing a
team that, if they had continued to lose, they'd be 0-6 right now
and pretty much out of it. But if they win three or four in a row,
they're right back in the race. We've lost two straight, so this
becomes a pivotal game for both of us.''
</P>
<P>
   He has tried to forget the Miami loss, but in retrospect, ``It
was very frustrating for me because our defense shouldn't have been
put in that position,'' he said. ``But you have to have the ability
to put it behind you. Nobody wins during the week. If you're going
to be ultimately successful, you have to move on and make it right.
Football is unique in that you have to wait a week to make things
right.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not unique in that those who throw the ball for a living
can be off from time to time. This week, Bledsoe is out to show
he's back.

 &HT;    Dole's hometown has a tip for Bush
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALISBURY, N.C. _ Retired textile worker Colene Williams likes
the sound of ``Vice President Dole.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If she could not make it as president, I think she would make
a great vice president,'' Williams said of Elizabeth Dole, a
Salisbury native who had hoped to be the first woman elected to the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   Dole's announcement Wednesday that she is dropping her
Republican campaign got people talking _ in a city where Dole and
the soft drink Cheerwine are local favorites _ about the political
future of the 63-year-old former Cabinet secretary.
</P>
<P>
   The news spread rapidly across the city of 26,792, several hours
before a screaming headline in the local afternoon paper, the
Salisbury Post, proclaimed ``Dole dropping out.''
</P>
<P>
   At a press conference in Washington, Dole declined to comment on
speculation that she would like to be the GOP vice presidential
candidate. But in her hometown, at one of Dole's favorite breakfast
places, the Big Pig, people were hoping that GOP front-runner
George W. Bush would tap her as his running mate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush says he wants the women's vote,'' said waitress Mable
Hatfield, carrying out plates of chopped pork and reddish cole
slaw. ``He'd be stupid if he does not ask her.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She would be a credit to him ...'' said Mary Penley, 72,
interrupted by friend June Curran, 76, who finished her sentence.
``... if he would listen to her,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A mile away, inside the stately English Tudor home where Dole
grew up, her brother, John Hanford, said she might wind up on the
ticket as part of the GOP's strategy late in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But the 76-year-old retired businessman said, ``She will not go
out seeking the nomination.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanford learned of his sister's decision Tuesday, after Dole had
concluded that Bush, the Texas governor, and millionaire publisher
Steve Forbes had ``insurmountable'' leads in fund-raising. Dole was
particularly concerned that she couldn't compete with her rivals'
upcoming TV ads in New Hampshire and Iowa. ``That is when this
discrepancy (in funds) begins to make a huge difference in the
effectiveness of campaigning,'' Hanford said.
</P>
<P>
   Dole's 98-year-old mother, Mary Hanford, eating lunch in the
kitchen, declined to comment. Her son said she was comfortable with
her daughter's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Several diners at the Big Pig said they were disappointed, but
not surprised that Dole dropped out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she would have made a pretty good showing,'' said
retired trucker Turner Williams, drinking coffee with his wife,
Colene, in the Big Pig.
</P>
<P>
   Hatfield, the waitress, said she would have supported Bush, even
if Dole had stayed in the race. ``I don't think a woman is going to
be president,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody believes she would have gone all the way, but people
thought she'd make a better showing than she did,'' said Walter
Koontz, 57, the Big Pig's owner.
</P>
<P>
   Penley was relieved to hear that Dole was dropping out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want her to go up there and get hurt in all that
political mess,'' she said. ``She is too good a woman.''

DEVELOPERS PLAN RETIREMENT COMMUNITIES FOR GAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Calif., N.Y.)   (bl)  
 By RICK BRAGG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ David Krongelb, a Fort Lauderdale businessman, came out
of the closet in his 20s and believed that the door would never
close on him again. He is 50 now, and wonders if he will need that
secret place again when he grows old.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're old,'' he said, ``the last thing that you want to
do is to have to hide.'' .
</P>
<P>
   Many gay Americans who, like Krongelb, have lived openly as
homosexuals well into middle age are now worried that they will
have to retreat into secrecy if they enter retirement communities
or nursing homes.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these Americans, in particular the baby boomers who
endured years of discrimination, worry that they will be isolated
and discriminated against by elderly neighbors and health care
workers.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the first openly gay generation grows grayer and
contemplates retirement, developers around the country are planning
gay-only retirement communities and assisted-care complexes that
would allow aging gays to grow old surrounded by other gays, where
they do not have to live, and ultimately die, amid lingering
condemnation.
</P>
<P>
   In Fort Lauderdale, Boston, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Atlanta
and other cities, these developers _ many of them gays themselves
who have their own fears of old age _ are promising a haven for
those who will become old and infirm, many of them without the
support of children or other family members.
</P>
<P>
   For gay men in particular, the ones who have lived into middle
age under the stigma of AIDS and amid fear and talk of shortened
lives, the idea of living too long once seemed novel. But gays
around the country say that retirement has been dinner-table
conversation for the past few years, talk that is growing more
urgent as they grow older.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always ask, `What are we going to do?'' said Jeffrey
Dillon, 37, who, along with John DeLeo, 54, is arranging financing
for a 270-unit assisted-care high rise in downtown Fort Lauderdale.
</P>
<P>
   DeLeo and Dillon envison a community in which gay couples can
live together without persecution, but also one in which the
community would stave off loneliness and insulate people from the
meanness outside.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Scott Schieman, an assistant professor of sociology at the
University of Miami who specializes in aging, said the planned
developments could become more than just places to grow old among
people with similar pasts and similar stories.
</P>
<P>
   ``What defines later life for gays?'' he said. ``Many of them
have not formed any kind of nest.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Gay men in particular,'' he said, ``saw a truncated life,''
because of AIDS, and spoke more of dying young than growing old.
``They deal with a lot of loss, loss of partners, and loss of
friends.'' The survivors often find themselves with an isolation
that is complete, or almost so, when they finally enter retirement
homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here, you have a new form of self-segregation,'' he said of
the gays-only retirement developments. But it is one that many gays
say they would find much more preferable to fighting old battles _
or hiding _ amid a colony of elderly strangers.
</P>
<P>
   They have seen it happen to people like 76-year-old like Evelyn
Kinser, who lives in a Los Angeles retirement home.
</P>
<P>
   To her, it is like being a girl again, made to feel ashamed
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``A sad world to live in,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   For her generation, the solution had always been secrecy. ``They
go back into the closet,'' said Krongelb, ``and play bridge.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kinser came out when she was 12, a pioneer of sorts. Like
Krongelb, she thought she was out for good. But now, living in a
senior citizens home in Los Angeles operated by the Salvation Army,
she hides her sexual orientation out of fear she will be ridiculed
or isolated.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a hard way to live, having to be someone you're not,''
she said. ``I don't talk to my neighbors about much of anything.
Except sports. That's a safe topic.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kinser has never told her neighbors at the home that she is
gay. But she knows that they know she is different.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen that look in their eye,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Even friends who give her that look are better than no friends.
So, she remains quiet. But she is tired of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm closeted again,'' she said. ``I hate it.''
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of special housing for elderly gays cite a number of
incidents as evidence of a need for it. In 1996, a lesbian couple
who had shared a home for years were forbidden to stay together in
an assisted-living center in Northern California, said Doni
Gewirtzman of the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, the gay
rights group.
</P>
<P>
   About the same time, in Virginia, an elderly woman was refused
personal care in a nursing home because the staff claimed that she
had engaged in ``inappropriate sexual behavior.'' The staff there
claimed that she made sexual advances towards them, Gewirtzman
said.
</P>
<P>
   And some years back, a nursing home employee refused to give a
resident a bath after learning she was a lesbian, according to the
New York chapter of Senior Action in a Gay Environment. ``It's very
daunting, especially for those people who have been out a long
time,'' said Sandy Warshaw, director of policy education and
community outreach for that organization.
</P>
<P>
   Max Weatherly, 78, lives in public housing in Delray Beach,
Fla., amid neighbors who are not unkind to him, but with whom he
has little in common. To him, a self-contained, gays-only
retirement home would be a utopia.
</P>
<P>
   ``People like my grandfather told me I would turn out to be no
good,'' he said. ``I would play the piano and read books, but they
thought I was a sissy because I couldn't get on a horse.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   He would like to spend his last years among people who would nod
their heads in understanding when they hear that story.
</P>
<P>
   It is not unusual for a gay person to walk the corridors in a
nursing home or an assisted-living center and find themselves, even
among so many people, completely alone, said Veronica St. Claire,
chief executive of the Gay and Lesbian Association of Retiring
Persons, in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   She knows one man, a retired teacher who developed Parkinson's
disease, who went to live in an assisted-care home and found that
he was the only gay man there. ``He can't have his books out, or
his magazines. He felt his care would be compromised if they
knew,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But while gays his age see it almost as a dream, gays of a
younger generation _ the baby boomers _ will demand that kind of
retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're the first to come forward,'' as a generation with an
openly gay life style, said Stephen Golant, a gerontologist at the
University of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   And those who helped create thriving gay communities in American
cities will insist on living that way, if at a somewhat slower
pace, in retirement, said developers in Boston, Fort Lauderdale and
other cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a healthy phenomenon,'' said Golant, who sees plans for
the developments as proof that a generation of gays have the social
and economic power to carry it off.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're willing to define themselves as old and gay. These are
big self-identity issues. They're saying, `We're not afraid of who
we are. I'm proud of who I am, and I'm going to stand by it,''' to
the grave.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of creating communities specifically for gay people is
really not new, said Dillon. It is just the first time the concept
has been applied with older gays in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since we don't have big families, we tend to think of our
friends as family, and our neighbors become our friends,'' said
Dillon. ``So they become like our family. This way, we're
surrounded by family.''
</P>
<P>
   Developers have said would not undertake such projects if they
did not think they could sell them.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, a project called the Stonewall Communities _ named
after a gay bar in New York's Greenwich Village where a 1969 clash
with police is credited with beginning the modern gay rights
movement _ is planning a retirement community in or near that
city's downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Gay and Lesbian Association of Retiring Persons
in Los Angeles is in the process of financing and designing a
retirement community on 19 acres near Palm Springs that, like the
high-rise in Fort Lauderdale, will offer both assisted living and
nursing care. Another feature: vistas of the Santa Rosa Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   She believes there will be more such communities, as gays and
lesbians insist on the same freedom in old age they won over time.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, the project is past the planning stage, and awaiting
financing. If the financing continues on schedule _ DeLeo said he
does not expect any problem _ then construction on that project,
estimated to cost between $40 million and $60 million, would begin
within the coming year.
</P>
<P>
   Living there would not be cheap. Residents would pay $235,000 or
more for one- and two-bedroom apartments, and a monthly fee of
$2,000 to $4,000, depending, DeLeo and Dillon said, on how much
care the resident needs.
</P>
<P>
   Besides a nursing staff and in-house health care, the high-rise
would have its own theater, where independent films could debut,
its own art gallery, a market with specialty foods and restaurants.
The developers say it would be the first of many, and plan other
high-rises in Atlanta, San Francisco, Los Angeles and New York.
</P>
<P>
   The developers picked Fort Lauderdale, they said, because it has
a history as a gay-friendly city.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people will support it, some people will oppose it,''
said Mayor Jim Knaugle. ``I think it could be a successful
project.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Latona, a Fort Lauderdale city commissioner, said he doubts
if the construction of the facility would become an issue. ``We
have a substantial gay community that is well received,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But would not the construction of such a place be a form of
unlawful exclusion? The developers say not, that _ while it is
designed with gays in mind _ it would be open to anyone.
</P>
<P>
   It makes sense that any straight people who want to live in a
place intended mostly for gay people would not be the kind of
people who would be hurtful. They would just be neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will always be homophobes out there,'' said Krongelb.
``But we've come too far to suffer like that again.''

NORRIS IS GIVEN LITTLE CHANCE   IN BOUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ The father's nickname is ``Shot.'' Most people think
his son should be called ``No Shot.''
</P>
<P>
   That is what the majority of fight fans and Las Vegas wise guys
think of Orlin Norris Jr.'s chances of surviving a business meeting
with Mike Tyson Saturday night at the MGM Grand Garden Arena. Shot?
No shot.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a reflection on Tyson, who did not look good in his
January knockout of Frans Botha. Tyson lost every round up until he
landed a bomb on Botha's face that rendered the need for additional
rounds unnecessary. Botha folded up like a beach umbrella late in
the fifth, his mind suddenly put on hold for about 30 seconds while
his body quivered on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Although Tyson has knocked down sparring partners each of the
last two days at the Golden Gloves Gym and looks fit and trim at an
estimated 220 pounds, the prevailing opinion is that, at 33, he is
on the dark side of the fistic mountain. Although he retains his
legendary punching power, much of Tyson's speed and reflexes have
deserted him because of age and inactivity, leaving him appearing
more like just another small heavyweight rather than the small
nuclear bomb he once was.
</P>
<P>
   Still, few see that as helpful to poor Norris, who is no spring
chicken himself at 34, and stubbier than even Tyson. Although
Norris will weigh in Thursday at around 212 pounds, he is a
cruiserweight by breeding and class, having once held the WBA
version of the junior heavyweight title (1993-1995).
</P>
<P>
   After losing the championship to a losing battle of the bulge
and a losing battle with someone named Nate ``Mr.'' Miller, Norris
returned from whence he'd first come and decided to campaign as a
full-fledged heavyweight. He has won seven times in eight fights
since. His only loss a 12-round decision to 6-foot-7-inch Henry
Akinwande on a night when it looked like Akinwande had chosen his
opponent from the jockey room at Aqueduct. The 5-9 1/2 Norris
struggled to get close enough to reach him with a local call.
</P>
<P>
   Norris (50-5, 27 KO) failed at that but pressed on, fighting
occasionally until Tyson's people called this summer looking for
just what he appeared to be: an aging, short heavyweight with
minimal punching power, but the boxing ability to give Tyson some
much needed rounds without posing a threat.
</P>
<P>
   With that call came a check for $800,000, money Norris sorely
needed to help pay his father's mounting medical bills. After
watching Shot fight leukemia to a standoff after looking like he
might not make it through the summer, No Shot now looks at Tyson as
far less formidable than most of the observers who won't be in the
ring with him Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   If his father could win his fight, why can't he win his?
</P>
<P>
   ``I never had anything easy come to me,'' Norris said. ``This
will be no exception. But I plan to be there. I know he's going to
hit me and I'm going to hit him. My job is to not get hit with that
big shot.''
</P>
<P>
   The odds of Shot getting to see No Shot avoid being hit by a big
shot long enough to win Saturday night are 12-1 on the Strip.
</P>
<P>
   That's not good if you're a gambling man, and worse if you're a
fighter. But that's the way it is for Norris this morning, and
he'll take it because Wednesday his father was at his side against
longer odds, walking a bit slower than when he used to work his
son's corner, but still walking tall. Walking the same walk his son
will walk Saturday night. A long walk against long odds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very relaxed,'' the son said as the father looked on.
``That's my personality. At this point of my career, I still have
speed and the ability to think in the ring. People expect me to box
him and take him into the later rounds, and that is what I'll do.
That's the way I fight. The longer the fight goes, the larger the
advantage for me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have always been an underdog so this is nothing new. I like
being an underdog. I like doing something no one expects to have
happen. The media all say I'm the first rung on Tyson's ladder to
the top. If I am, it won't be an easy step. I'm one tough old
chicken.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyson can vouch for that because when they were both spring
chickens, he lost an amateur fight to Norris on a decision down in
Texas. That was 18 years ago and neither can remember much about
the fight beyond its outcome. Neither thinks it will make a
difference Saturday night except it tells Norris something. It
tells him that long odds aren't the same as no shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Orlin did it once so he knows he can do it again,'' said Abel
Sanchez, his lead trainer. ``It was the same kind of fight. Power
puncher against a boxer and the boxer won. Mike Tyson gets
frustrated when you box him. Orlin knows that. He knows he can beat
this man again.''
</P>
<P>
   If he can, he knows something else, too. He knows what he'll
become if he does. He'll become a big shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realize what a fight like this can do for my career,''
Norris said.
</P>
<P>
   If it does more than just pay his father's medical bills, it'll
be a miracle. But Orlin Norris has already seen one of those this
summer, so he understands what the world does not. He understands
all things are possible for a guy called Shot. And maybe even for
one called No Shot.

FORMER LEADER OF PAKISTAN MAY FACE CORRUPTION TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By TIM WEINER and STEVE LeVINE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan _ The military said Wednesday that Nawaz
Sharif, the prime minister it overthrew last week, was being
investigated for corruption, including the stealing of hundreds of
millions of dollars from state banks.
</P>
<P>
   Brig. Rashid Qureshi, the spokesman for Pakistan's military
ruler, Gen. Pervaiz Musharraf, said that Sharif would probably face
a trial for defaulting on bank loans and for tax evasion.
</P>
<P>
   This kind of challenge to Pakistan's politicians is popular
among ordinary Pakistanis and has been used by the military as
justification for seizing power from the elected government last
week. It is routine in Pakistan for a new government to investigate
its predecessor and for corruption charges to become the fodder of
political vendettas.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Sharif was overthrown, federal investigators in his
government and the one before him, under his rival, Benazir Bhutto,
had already compiled evidence against him. It suggests that Sharif
was part of a longstanding culture of corruption that has nearly
bankrupted the country and turned its political parties into
criminal enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan, a nation of more than 140 million people, has about
$1.4 billion in its treasury. Its national banks say they are
holding at least $4 billion in unsecured loans.
</P>
<P>
   And at least 70 percent of those bad loans can be traced to the
democratically elected leaders who held power in Pakistan over the
past decade, along with their families and friends and politically
powerful military officers, according to state bank records and
interviews with senior bankers and former government officials.
</P>
<P>
   Their use of unsecured loans has ``brought the banking system
down on its knees and rocked the financial stability of the
nation,'' said Mehriyar Pataudi, senior vice president of Askari
Commercial Bank. ``The national banks have been treated as coffers
for people who took money without a thought of having to return
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The corruption accusations against Sharif have yet to be proved
in the nation's politically crippled courts. But the evidence
suggests that Pakistan's rulers in recent years have collectively
beggared their country.
</P>
<P>
   According to government records and interviews with leading
bankers and politicians, Pakistan's leaders, including previous
military dictators, have long stolen public funds and public lands,
taken kickbacks from public projects and, especially in recent
years, exploited nationalized banks as personal exchequers.
</P>
<P>
   Sharif, the ousted prime minister, has been held in isolation at
one of his residences near Islamabad since the coup last week.
Repeated attempts to reach him, his government spokesman, who was
also being held, and representatives of his government and his
family have been unsuccessful this week.
</P>
<P>
   Sharif has not been formally accused of any crime since
beginning his second term as prime minister in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But he was accused in a formal report, submitted last year to
Pakistan's president, of theft from the state, money laundering and
fraud, including the taking of hundreds of millions of dollars in
bad loans from state banks.
</P>
<P>
   The origins of that report date to Sharif's first term as prime
minister, which ended in 1993, when he was dismissed,
constitutionally, by Pakistan's president for allowing corruption
to flourish in government institutions, including state-controlled
banks.
</P>
<P>
   In that same year, 1993, Sharif, a multimillionaire even before
taking power, paid $60 in income tax. He has never paid a tax
judgment of $50 million levied against him in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   When his rival, Ms. Bhutto, took power, Pakistan's chief
investigative agency began to look into the charges of corruption
against Sharif. In 1996, Ms. Bhutto's government was itself
dismissed by the president on corruption charges. Re-elected,
Sharif attempted to suppress the federal investigation and, while
in power, Sharif's government compiled its own corruption charges
against Ms. Bhutto.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation into Sharif's alleged wrongdoing nonetheless
continued and culminated after a five-year inquiry in a report
written by Rehman Malik, then deputy director of the nation's top
criminal investigative agency. In 1997, Sharif suppressed the final
draft of the report and threw Malik into solitary confinement for
almost a year.
</P>
<P>
   The report, which has been reviewed by The New York Times, said
Sharif used ill-gotten gains to buy, among other things, a $5
million family pied-a-terre in London. It was, the report alleged,
one of four apartments bought with laundered money siphoned from
Pakistani banks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The extent and magnitude of this corruption is so staggering
that it has put the very integrity of the country at stake,'' said
the 1998 report by Pakistan's Federal Investigation Agency.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Malik said in an interview from London, where he now lives, that
Sharif and his family had taken hundreds of millions of dollars
from Pakistan's banks.
</P>
<P>
   ``No other leader of Pakistan has taken that much money from the
banks,'' he said. He added that Sharif had no fear of prosecution
while he was prime minister. ``There is no rule of law in
Pakistan,'' he said. ``It doesn't exist.''
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Investigative Agency report said that Sharif, now
being held in what the military calls protective custody, evaded
millions of dollars in taxes, profited by manipulating import
duties on goods and took money generated by state-owned
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   He and his family, the report said, used dummy companies as
repositories for millions of dollars. It cited, in detail, the
family's purchase of its properties in London as one example.
</P>
<P>
   The report documented the following transactions:
</P>
<P>
   _ Sharif, it said, used a close friend's nephew to open three
dummy accounts in the names of nonexistent people at a Swiss bank.
</P>
<P>
   _ At least $3.8 million, the report said, flowed into those
dummy accounts from two other accounts at a bank in Lahore,
Sharif's hometown. It said those accounts were opened in the name
of two Pakistanis who lived in London and had nothing to do with
the transaction.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Swiss bank funds, it said, were used to purchase the
London property, where two of Sharif's children live, through two
offshore companies registered in the British Virgin Islands.
</P>
<P>
   Sharif's name appears nowhere in these transactions.
</P>
<P>
   The report also documents sweetheart deals for the main family
business, the Ittefaq Group.
</P>
<P>
   Ittefaq, a company that began as a small foundry, was started by
Sharif's father, Mohammed, a blacksmith. But as Sharif rose to
power, the company grew to become ``an unparalleled industrial
empire in Pakistan,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   When he served as a minister under Pakistan's last military
dictator, Gen. Zia ul-Haq, who seized power in 1977, the foundry
became a diversified holding company of nine industrial firms. By
the middle of his first term as prime minister, it had grown to 30
companies.
</P>
<P>
   The growth of Ittefaq was financed in part by at least $200
million in unsecured loans from Pakistan's banks, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The use of nationalized banks as cash cows has destabilized
Pakistan, according to bankers and politicians.
</P>
<P>
   The use of the state banks for personal profit created a climate
in which legitimate loans became hard to find, international
lenders looked askance and the nation's reputation as a sinkhole
for finance capital deepened.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pakistan is a criminal society,'' said Irshadullah Khan, a
prominent businessman and former Rhodes scholar. ``Our banking
system is the most corrupt in the world.''

SPORTS COLUMN: YANKEES PREPARE TO FACE BRAVES AND AN OLD FRIEND  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   They rode buses together for long, hot summers in the minor
leagues, and rose to the majors to spend more than a few nights
chilling out on the bench. They would engage in the chatter of
chances, wondering when their respective turns might come.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Leyritz was brash, eager to inflate his worth, the
occasional irritant to established players. Gerald Williams was
reflective, easygoing, best friend to a born star, Derek Jeter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy had five tools,'' Leyritz said, giving Williams the
ultimate baseball scout's honor. ``I would've had to have been the
first to tell you it would've been Gerald who got a chance, with
the talent he had.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Williams, an outfielder with speed and a quick
bat, he didn't have the ability to retire a left-handed hitter late
in a game. In August 1996, the Yankees had one crying need as they
coasted toward their first post-season under their new manager, Joe
Torre.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt we had built this $60 million house with a hole in the
roof,'' said Brian Cashman, the general manager who, at the time,
was assistant to Bob Watson.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Williams, after nine patient years in the Yankee
organization, was deemed expendable. He went to Milwaukee as part
of what would become a very good deal for the lanky southpaw Graeme
Lloyd. Hole repaired, the Yankees went to the World Series.
Eventually, Leyritz went to the plate in Game 4 against the Atlanta
closer Mark Wohlers, who was in to protect a 6-3 Braves lead in the
eighth inning, two men on, at Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   Wohlers, with heat often too nasty to hit, threw Leyritz a
slider without enough snap. Leyritz sent it over the left-field
fence and turned around a World Series that the Braves had appeared
certain to win.
</P>
<P>
   Fate and fortune are funny that way. While Williams and his
tools were gone from the Yankees, the headstrong Leyritz had struck
a blow that made him, as he said Wednesday while contemplating
another World Series against the Braves, ``a Yankee forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Like all good Yankees and half the city, Leyritz was up past
midnight Tuesday, into Wednesday morning. Starring in their roles
of dead men slugging, the Mets were making a gallant last stand,
the brave against the Braves. But in the bottom half of the 11th
inning, here came Gerald Williams to lead off against Kenny Rogers,
star-crossed man on his nightmare mound.
</P>
<P>
   It was Rogers, remember, who had started for the Yankees,
pitched them into a hole, on the night Leyritz rode to the rescue.
Now Bobby Valentine had handed him the ball, and every Met fan and
maybe most Yankee fans saw sudden death for the Subway Series.
</P>
<P>
   Leyritz said he had been rooting for the Mets, but a return to
the scene of personal glory was all right with him. The truth was,
he also couldn't help but pull for Gerald Williams, the unlucky
soul who had been hauled off baseball's equivalent of the space
shuttle a month before launch, and ordered aground to a team with
no wings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard not to root for guys you came up with,'' Leyritz
said. ``Especially a guy like him.''
</P>
<P>
   When Leyritz was in San Diego last season, the Padres had one of
those bench-clearing tangos with Atlanta, where Williams had
happily gone in an off-season trade. The two former Yankees found
each other, held on, not quite like Jeter and Alex Rodriguez, just
two journeymen who had done their bench and bus time together.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, this season, Williams stepped into a floodlight of
opportunity. He had 422 at-bats. He played left field, often led
off, hit 17 home runs, drove in 68 runs and became another example
of the Atlanta organization's stubborn resourcefulness in a season
supposedly lost to crippling injury and illness. In the Braves'
neediest hour, the 11th inning of Game 6, Williams lined a double
off Rogers into the left-field corner. He soon crossed the plate as
the series-winning run. He stepped into a celebration that would
carry him, finally, to a Braves-Yankees World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to make sure I didn't take wings,'' he said, when
someone asked what he was thinking as he came down the third-base
line following ball four to Andruw Jones. By this he meant that, if
anything, experience had taught him to stay grounded _ the advice
he shares with nephews and nieces.
</P>
<P>
   That is what Williams told Leyritz he would do long after he was
traded by the Yankees, after he missed out on those ultimate games.
He told Leyritz he would stay calm, and things would work out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good to play against old friends,'' Williams said after
they had.
</P>
<P>
   Leyritz _ to date off the Yankees' post-season roster after his
midsummer return to New York _ can only assume that Torre wants his
bat for late-inning at-bats against the tough lefties in the
Braves' bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, when opportunity was with him, Leyritz became a
World Series hero. Maybe you believe in fate. Maybe you don't. Some
good advice for Mariano Rivera, though: stay grounded, and watch
those sliders when Gerald Williams comes up.

SNIPING OVER BUDGET RESUMES IN CONGRESS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After a conciliatory meeting at the White House on
Tuesday night, Republicans and Democrats in Congress reverted to
form Wednesday, sniping at each other over the budget and attending
more to political positioning than to bridging their differences.
</P>
<P>
   First thing Wednesday morning, the House Republican leaders
brought up a bill to finance programs of the Departments of
Commerce, Justice and State and pushed it through on a near
party-line vote in the full knowledge that President Clinton would
veto it.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas, the majority whip, called a news
conference with several other Republicans and accused the president
of wanting to raise taxes and spend money reserved for Social
Security on other programs, like foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats in Congress said Republicans were negotiating in bad
faith. Sen. Tom Daschle, D-S.D., the minority leader, accused
Republicans of ``duplicity when it comes to the budget.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep.Dick Gephardt of Missouri, the Democratic leader, said in an
interview that the Republicans had agreed at the White House
meeting on Tuesday to consider all the spending bills at once but
were already reneging and taking them up one at a time.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a bad disagreement on process,'' Gephardt said. ``The
result is that we're going to be here till the Super Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans acknowledged that the president requested
consideration of all the controversies together, but they said they
had never agreed to that procedure.
</P>
<P>
   In other budget battles over the years, Clinton has found it
advantageous to deal with one omnibus bill rather than many
separate ones, a point on which the Republicans do not need to be
reminded.
</P>
<P>
   After the White House meeting, both sides promised to work
together over the next week or so to resolve their budget
differences.
</P>
<P>
   In that spirit, Jack Lew, the president's budget director, went
to the Capitol on Wednesday afternoon and met for about an hour
with the senior members of the Congressional Appropriations
Committees. No specifics were discussed, the participants said, and
no disagreements were settled.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. David R. Obey of Wisconsin, the top Democrat on the House
Appropriations Committee, said after the meeting that progress was
impossible without House Republican leaders participating.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem lies above our pay grade,'' Obey said. ``We are
light colonels, not four-star generals.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Appropriations Committee chairman, Rep. C.W. Bill Young,
R-Fla., said that the meeting with Lew had ``opened a lot of
doors'' and that another meeting to deal with specific budget
issues might be held on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The spending bill for the Commerce, Justice and State
Departments was approved, 215-213, after Republican leaders twisted
arms at the last minute to assure a majority. Only 13 Democrats
voted for the measure; 17 Republicans and one Independent voted
against it.
</P>
<P>
   The president opposes the bill because it allocates only $325
million of the $1.3 billion he requested for his program to put
more police officers on the streets. He also objects to provisions
that freeze financing for the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission and make it unlikely that money will be available for
the United States to pay its debt to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   The president Wednesday did sign a $99 billion bill for
veterans, housing and space programs. He called this bill a product
of bipartisan cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans insisted Wednesday that they would be able to clear
all the spending bills without dipping into Social Security
reserves. DeLay said that when all the spending bills had been
completed, the Congressional Budget Office would be asked to
certify that no Social Security money had been used.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they don't, then we'll go back and cut spending until they
do,'' DeLay said.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans actually drafting the spending bills said DeLay
and the other leaders had still not decided where they would trim
to meet their spending goal.

SUSAN FALUDI ON MEN'S ANGER AND CRISES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN MARSHALL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Why American men are so angry was the question that originally
confounded feminist Susan Faludi.
</P>
<P>
   So this is where the Pulitzer Prize-winning writer went for
answers: to Promise Keepers and the Spur Posse, to aerospace and
shipyard workers laid off during downsizing, to a group of men
convicted of domestic violence, to Vietnam vets and the original
astronauts, to the ``Dawg Pound'' bleacher fans of the Cleveland
Browns, to L.A. gang bangers and military cadets at the Citadel and
also to Sylvester Stallone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was interested in men who are facing crisis today,'' Faludi
said in an interview, ``men who are angry and have been lashing
out, often at false enemies. I was not interested in doing a Gallup
Poll on men today. I wanted to understand the dynamics of men with
real anger and frustration. And I believe that is a significant
number of American men, who demanded an investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Faludi's investigation, almost seven years in duration, has now
yielded ``Stiffed: The Betrayal of the American Man'' (William
Morrow, 608 pages, $27.50). This is a tour de force of personal
reportage, brilliantly written, immensely compelling, filled with
fascinating stories and insights worthy of thorough study, but also
a book that is way too long.
</P>
<P>
   ``You feel an obligation to write longer when you have been
generously supported,'' related Faludi, who received a reported
$1.5 million advance for the book and last week received a
``mid-six-figure'' sum from Home Box Office, which plans a
television adaptation. ``I wish `Stiffed' was shorter; no doubt,
there would be more readers. But I also felt a responsibility to
the men I interviewed to tell their stories in a longer form.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Stiffed'' is, without question, one of this fall's most
important books. But it is also a big book that is having
considerable trouble finding an early audience, despite massive
coverage in the media (the cover of Newsweek, covers of most major
book reviews, a 17-city cross-country tour by the author).
</P>
<P>
   Male readers seem in no hurry to weigh into a massive book about
their plight written by one of the country's leading feminists.
Female readers, who buy far more books than men, seem put off by
the notion of a feminist spending 600 pages to detail just how
rough men have it today. ``Stiffed'' has yet to crack the major
best-seller lists, and is languishing well below the ``Hot 100''
books at Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   So it was a tired and frustrated Faludi who flew into Seattle
for another dizzying round of media interviews and a packed reading
at The Elliott Bay Book Co.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the 40-year-old writer's dismay comes from the number of
interviewers asking her questions based on a press kit instead of
her book. Part of it comes from suggestions that ``Stiffed'' is not
selling as well as might be expected (``I didn't write this book to
compete with `Titanic,''' she countered. ``It's only been out three
weeks, but everything these days has to be an overnight
sensation!''). But nothing unsettles Faludi quite like hearing that
some female readers, especially fellow feminists, have no interest
whatsoever in reading about the travails of men.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find that shocking,'' Faludi said. ``It just shows that
women can be as heartless as men. It is really depressing to me to
hear women boo-hooing about what more do they need to know about
men and their problems, as if they're competing to be on some
higher level of oppression. ... I would think people would want to
read this book to better figure out the world. And women, for all
the energy they spend berating men, talking about men, obsessing
about men, could spend five minutes looking at things from the
man's point of view. It wouldn't kill them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Stiffed'' looks at things from the male point-of-view in
exhaustive detail, mostly through in-depth and empathetic profiles
of the men whom Faludi interviewed. This technique of chronicling
social history through individual stories is quite similar to that
used, to great effect, by fellow journalist David Halberstam.
</P>
<P>
   Faludi, a summa cum laude graduate of Harvard, is a far more
adroit writer than Halberstam, turning memorable phrases on many
pages (``the astronaut was a dependent strapped to a couch in a
fetal position, wrapped in swaddling clothes''). But Faludi is also
a master interviewer, a thin rail of a person who obviously uses
her shy, unadorned manner to best advantage, the sort of intently
interested questioner who hangs around a subject and then hangs
around more and more and more until finally the subject is
thoroughly disarmed and willing to tell her anything and
everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be very frank with you,'' a displaced McDonnell Douglas
worker tells Faludi in a slow manner which she describes as
``placing every word down as if each were an increasingly heavy
weight.'' Then he concludes: ``I. Feel. I've. Been. Castrated.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a recurrent complaint of the men in crisis. So, too, is
a sense of being cast adrift in a consumer-driven,
celebrity-obsessed culture where the old ``male'' virtues (doing
productive work, loyalty, sacrifice, fellowship) no longer matter.
So, too, is the sense, especially among baby boomer men, of being
abandoned by their fathers or at least being left clueless by
silent fathers about ``how to be a man.''
</P>
<P>
   ``An aching sadness remained,'' Faludi writes. ``Men spoke to me
of waiting, year after year, for a sign, a late-night confidence, a
death-bed confession, even _ desperately _ a letter delivered
posthumously, for any moment that would decode the mystery of their
mute fathers.''
</P>
<P>
   This complaint about absent or silent fathers fueled much of the
``men's movement'' and its literature in the last decade. But it
seems to acquire more gravity somehow when it is recounted
sympathetically not by Robert Bly or Sam Keen but by a feminist
icon, the celebrated author of ``Backlash: The Undeclared War
Against Women,'' a well-timed, well-argued polemic that was a best
seller in 1992 and has gone on to become an important work in the
feminist canon.
</P>
<P>
   Faludi's criticism of the generation of men who won World War II
and then somehow let their sons down is among the most pointed in
the book (although she tends to let that complaint stand
unchallenged either by historical research or by a response from
men in the criticized generation). But, in person, Faludi is far
less critical of the World War II fathers, contending that both the
fathers and their sons fell victim to sweeping cultural forces that
overwhelmed them, especially the rapid onrush of the consumerist
mentality (Faludi's prime villain).
</P>
<P>
   These cultural forces are the main reason why many men feel
emasculated and angry, Faludi discovered. Men are not lashing out,
as she initially suspected, because of ``masculinity on the
rampage'' or even because they feel threatened by the gains made by
women, although feminists themselves are a frequent target of male
complaint.
</P>
<P>
   Faludi concludes ``Stiffed'' with a brief note of optimism that
``men and women are at a historically opportune moment when they
hold the keys to each other's liberation.'' But that closing
optimism, which does not seem all that justified by what has been
detailed in the 600 pages that have preceded it, does depend on
both men and women recognizing that their real enemy is not one
another but rather the culture that enslaves them both.
</P>
<P>
   Faludi, in person, has some hope of that happening, but not
much.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think there comes a point when people can't bear the
soullessness, the deadened quality of being in a culture that does
not nurture human creativity,'' she stressed. ``One hopes that
enough people will have had it with the dehumanizing aspects of
this culture to rebel against it. But we're in new territory here,
when the seductive consumer culture seems both benign and
consoling. It is not a situation where it's like we're sending
children to work in the mines and everyone knows that is wrong. So
what it will take to overcome this culture, I just don't know.''

SUPPORTERS SADDENED BY DOLE'S WITHDRAWAL
</HEADLINE>
   (See also DOLE-WITHDRAWS, DOLE-ASSESS) 
(sw) 
 By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Wherever she spoke, Elizabeth Dole unfailingly
brought up the trailblazing nature of her candidacy. She often
managed to get introduced by a woman in authority, and would quip,
``Hmm. A female president . . . Sounds good to me.'' Banners, signs
and even the chocolate mousse cake at a recent luncheon for her
urged, ``Let's Make History.''
</P>
<P>
   But on Wednesday, Mrs. Dole gave up on making history. She
blamed not her gender, but the quirk of political fate that pitted
her against George W. Bush, who had amassed a war chest of some $60
million, and Steve Forbes, the multimillionaire publisher with a
seemingly bottomless personal fortune to finance his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Dole's exit from the race saddened many, including those
who disagreed with her position on specific issues but who were
pleased to see a woman slug it out for the nation's top job.
</P>
<P>
   ``My disappointment is acute that she is not in there,'' said
Geraldine Ferraro, the first woman to run for vice president, in
1984. ``I would have liked to have seen her participate in the
primaries. She would have added to the dialogue in that party.''
</P>
<P>
   But in fact Mrs. Dole did not alter her message to appeal
strictly to women. Mrs. Dole, a conservative Republican, traced a
fine line on her road to the presidency: If she tried to build on
the unique nature of her campaign by embracing traditional
``women's causes,'' she risked feeding into stereotypes and
alienating men who might otherwise vote for her.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Mrs. Dole took on many of the same issues her rivals
raised, like education and defense, calling for greater local
control of schools and a nuclear arms buildup. She called for
pouring more money into drug interdiction.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, her longtime opposition to abortion except in dire
circumstances lost her the support of liberal-minded women, who
might have been considered her natural constituency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Outside of her gender she didn't have a cause behind her,''
said Tanya Melich, a political consultant and author of the 1996
book, ``The Republican War Against Women (Bantam).'' ``She was a
traditionalist running a non-traditionalist campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference after her announcement, Mrs. Dole said she
did not think her decision to drop out would discourage other women
from entering politics. ``What we've done is paved the way for the
person who will be the first woman president,'' she said, adding
that she was ``delighted,'' because ``we've really made a great
contribution.''
</P>
<P>
   Where Mrs. Dole's candidacy did break new ground was in its
success attracting women and young people who had never before
taken part in the electoral process. More than 50 percent of Mrs.
Dole's big supporters were women, more than twice the number who
usually contribute more than $200 to political campaigns. Through
the Internet and personal and professional connections, she had
signed on thousands of volunteers, many of them young people and
women.
</P>
<P>
   Polls, however, did not show Mrs. Dole's support running
stronger among women than men. Kate Michelman, president of the
National Association for Reproductive Rights League, said, ``Many
women were understandably excited about a woman running for
president, but I think her candidacy failed to excite most people,
women as well, because she didn't connect on the issues of greatest
concern to women.'' Mrs. Michelman's group opposed all Republican
candidates because of their stand against abortion.
</P>
<P>
   A good number of the political greenhorns Mrs. Dole attracted to
politics were drawn by her charm and character, rather than her
position on issues. It is unclear whether these supporters will
translate into a political force with her campaign now over.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're dealing with people who don't have an intrinsic
interest in the process, said Norman Orenstein, of the American
Enterprise Institute, ``and whose attention span can be turned to
something else quite quickly.'' .
</P>
<P>
   Mary Mason, a 61-year-old bookkeeper who helped organize a
reception for Mrs. Dole in Richmond, Va., said she volunteered
because a friend in the campaign had asked her to. Now, she said,
she did not plan to throw her energy behind another candidate.
``I'm disappointed,'' Ms. Mason said in a telephone interview on
Wednesday. ``I think it's sad that we can't even get to the year
2000, when the campaign really gets started.''
</P>
<P>
   Tanya White, the campaign's finance chairwoman in South
Carolina, said Dole supporters had signed up 4,000 volunteers in
her state. ``That's what she brought, people who were disenchanted
or saw a way to become involved in the process.''
</P>
<P>
   She contended that Mrs. Dole did bring a woman's perspective to
her bid, focusing on what was practical and attainable, whether the
issue was handguns or drug interdiction.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. White herself was not a newcomer to politics, but had no
plans to throw her expertise behind anyone else for the moment. ``I
was trying to get uninvolved in campaigns, but I wanted to help
because I thought it was a worthy cause,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Dole's staff and supporters contended that her favorable
ratings in opinion polls, which showed her beating Al Gore and Bill
Bradley in two-way races, proved that Americans were ready to elect
a woman president.
</P>
<P>
   Her national finance chairman, Bonnie McElveen-Hunter, said it
was timing, not sexism, that blocked the Dole campaign from winning
more money or endorsements from Republican leaders. ``This process
began three years ago,'' she said. ``I think there were commitments
that were made.''
</P>
<P>
   And Mrs. Ferraro said she had no doubt Americans were ``ready''
for a female chief of state. ``Were they ready for a wrestler in
Minnesota? Are they ready for a billionaire?'' she asked. ``This is
a country where everybody has a chance, especially women.''

STATE IS DUBBED `DOT-COMMONWEALTH' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Portraying the Bay State as a world center of computing
technology, Gov. Paul Cellucci and dozens of the state's top
high-tech business leaders Wednesday awarded Massachusetts another
nickname _ the ``.commonwealth.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a dot there before the word ``commonwealth,'' as in an
e-mail address, and pronounced the same way _ dot-commonwealth.
</P>
<P>
   State officials and business leaders said they intend to exploit
the new nickname to promote Massachusetts for further high-tech
business investment and employment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The `dot-commonwealth' campaign will help us educate
businesses and employees about the strength of the Massachusetts
economy and what sets us apart from other high-tech states,''
Cellucci said at a news conference at the Museum of Science.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, said Joyce Plotkin, executive director of the
Massachusetts Software Council, the new name is cool.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would not believe the positive feedback we have gotten
about that name,'' Plotkin said. ``It makes Silicon Valley sound
old.''
</P>
<P>
   A little East Coast hipness might make it easier to attract new
technology businesses and trained workers to the state. With a
nationwide shortage of high-tech workers, industry leaders say
Massachusetts needs a program that will attract competent employees
from out of state.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need constant acess to intellectual property to help our
company grow,'' said Jon Radoff, chairman and chief technology
officer of Eprise Corp., a Framingham-based maker of Web server
software. ``The only way to do that is to get people to come to the
region.''
</P>
<P>
   So the ``.commonwealth'' initiative will feature national
advertising, such as an insert in the Nov. 22 issue of Business
Week magazine. The group has established a Web site
(http://www.the.commonwealthmass.com) to tout the advantages of
setting up technology businesses in Massachusetts. And local tech
firms will begin adding the new ``.commonwealth'' logo to their ads
and Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   The state Department of Economic Development will provide some
funding to the initiative through an existing $50,000 fund used to
bring new businesses to Massachusetts. But most of the money will
come from 100 local technology companies and several of the state's
top technology trade associations. Plotkin would not disclose the
exact amount budgeted for the campaign, but said it was in the
six-figure range.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the member companies in the ``.commonwealth'' campaign
are relatively small startup firms, the sort that dominate today's
Massachusetts tech economy. But Cellucci doesn't think this puts
the state at much of a disadvantage in the struggle for high-tech
hearts and minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have the global headquarters like we used to have.
But in a global economy, that's not so important,'' Cellucci said.
``But I'll tell you what _ Harvard isn't going to go away; MIT is
not going to go away; Boston College is not going to go away.''
Cellucci said the state's reputation for academic excellence would
be one of the chief selling points in the ``.commonwealth''
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci asserted that one nickname that no longer applies to
the state is ``Taxachusetts,'' and touted his administration's
policy of cutting taxes on Massachusetts businesses.
</P>
<P>
   He also called for a permanent, worldwide ban on all taxation of
economic activity on the Internet. With more than 60,000 taxing
authorities worldwide, he said, it is utterly impractical to levy
sales taxes on Internet transactions. ``It seems to me it's crazy
to try to sort that out,'' Cellucci said.

 &HT;    Dole quits for lack of cash
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Elizabeth Dole ended her run for the White House,
short of the cash she said she needed to become the nation's first
woman president.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line remains funding,'' Dole said at a news
conference Wednesday with her husband, former Sen. Bob Dole, at her
side.
</P>
<P>
   She is the fifth candidate to exit the Republican field this
year. A sixth, Pat Buchanan, is expected to switch to the Reform
Party next week.
</P>
<P>
   Dole brushed off questions about her interest in the vice
presidency. But she did say, ``I'm a long way from the twilight.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she reached the decision to leave the race on a flight
Sunday from Seattle to Washington, D.C., after reflecting on the
massive spending by two of her Republican rivals: Texas Gov. George
W. Bush and magazine publisher Steve Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two people have spent $19 million already'' before costly
television advertising campaigns have even begun, Dole said.
</P>
<P>
   Dole was a distant second to Bush in most polls, although Sen.
John McCain (R-Ariz.) passed her recently in New Hampshire. She
said although she was used to facing long odds in the
male-dominated worlds of law and government, she could not ask her
supporters to persist while she was being outspent 75 or 80 to 1.
</P>
<P>
   But Dole's tepid fund-raising _ she raised $1 million to Bush's
$20 million in the past three months, for example _ was symptomatic
of other problems in the campaign, said Larry Sabato, a University
of Virginia political scientist.
</P>
<P>
   ``What she said was true, but as with all politicians, it was
only a part of the story,'' Sabato said. ``She ran a terrible
campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking back on her brief campaign, Dole said she might have
been better off leaving the presidency of the American Red Cross
earlier than January to begin countering Bush's quiet attempts to
line up financial commitments from Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Dole seemed to be in an enviable position to raise money as the
former Red Cross chief executive, a former Cabinet secretary and
the wife of a former Republican nominee for president and vice
president who maintains a formidable network of supporters.
</P>
<P>
   She and Bush were neck and neck in polls early this year, before
either really started campaigning. No woman had ever had such
standing in a national presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Dole's inability to capitalize on her advantages puzzled
political analysts and frustrated her staff. An example: She
finished a surprisingly strong third in the Iowa straw poll in
August, then took a 10-day vacation instead of building on her
showing. Her two main spokesmen left the campaign shortly
thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   There was an undeniable excitement in the large crowds that
turned out for Dole events. Among those she attracted were people
who hadn't voted before or who hadn't considered voting for a
Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Her speeches sometimes rambled, but she roused audiences by
talking about the prospect of her becoming the first woman
president.
</P>
<P>
   Dole altered her pitch somewhat Wednesday. ``I think what we've
done is pave the way for the person who will be the first woman
president,'' she said, as supporters cheered in a crowded room in a
Washington, D.C., hotel. Many in the room, including her husband,
struggled to fight back tears.
</P>
<P>
   Dole's national finance team, in a morning conference call,
tried to dissuade her from quitting, said Margaret Kluttz, a
longtime friend and former mayor of Salisbury, N.C., Dole's
hometown. ``But she had reached her decision,'' Kluttz said.
</P>
<P>
   Her pollster, Linda DiVall, said Dole should be seriously
considered as a vice presidential candidate because she would help
keep women from deserting the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   Praise flowed Wednesday from Bush and McCain, the two candidates
who might benefit from her withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   Bush called her a ``trailblazer.'' McCain, stressing campaign
finance reform in his own campaign, lamented that money had forced
Dole from the race.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia GOP Chairman Charles ``Chuck'' Clay said he expects Bush
to pick up the bulk of Dole's support in the state, mainly because
McCain has made little effort in Georgia. Already, Atlanta lawyer
Oscar Persons, a leader of the Dole campaign in Georgia, said he
has offered his services to Bush. Of the three leading Republicans
in the race, Forbes probably will attract relatively few Dole
supporters, if for no other reason than his barrage of television
ads against Bob Dole in the 1996 Republican primaries.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans had 12 candidates for president at one point
this year. If Buchanan joins the Reform Party as expected, the GOP
field will consist of: Gary Bauer, Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, Alan
Keyes, Bush, Forbes and McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have dropped out are: Lamar Alexander, Dan Quayle, New
Hampshire Sen. Bob Smith, Ohio Rep. John Kasich and Dole. Smith is
now an independent, mulling whether to continue his campaign for
president.

MUSLIM CLERIC PICKED AS PRESIDENT, INCITING PROTESTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ A respected but sickly Muslim cleric
snatched Indonesia's presidency Wednesday from the people's
favorite, the daughter of the country's founder, setting off a wave
of deadly protests by her frustrated followers.
</P>
<P>
   Abdurrahman Wahid, 59, the moderate leader of the largest Muslim
organization in the world's largest Muslim country, was not even a
candidate until a coalition of Islamic parties this month urged him
to abandon his longstanding support for presidential frontrunner
Megawati Sukarnoputri. He cited her party's alleged use of ``money
politics'' when he jumped in, but critics saw it as an ego trip and
few took his candidacy seriously.
</P>
<P>
   The selection of a cleric over Megawati, a populist, secular
nationalist, highlighted the rising power of Islam in this
historically secular nation. The violence sparked by Wahid's
surprise victory also raised the spectre of an eruption of
fraticidal conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Two people were reported killed and at least two dozen injured
here in the capital Wednesday as three bombs exploded in the
streets and melees broke out among protesters. Mobs set fire to the
Jakarta Convention Center and a highway toll booth, churning black
funnels of smoke into the night sky.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid's bid was bolstered when incumbent President B.J. Habibie
withdrew from the race at the last minute Wednesday after the
national assembly dramatically rejected his accounting of his 17
months in office. After a flurry of attempts to nominate
alternatives, many ruling party members and more radical Muslim
groups apparently threw their votes behind Wahid rather than cede
them to longtime opposition figure and secularist Megawati.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid, who within hours was sworn in as the first president ever
elected in a contested race in Indonesia, will shape the future of
Asia's newest, and still fragile, democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid will face a host of challenges, including Indonesia's
worst economic crisis in three decades and a persistent wave of
religious and separatist violence that has claimed thousands of
lives this year across a diverse chain of islands that are home to
210 million people.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers immediately questioned whether the frail and
legally blind leader, who had to be physically aided to cast his
vote, read his inaugural address and sign his oath of office
Wednesday, is up the far more difficult tasks ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Megawati, once a close friend of Wahid's who considered him her
``teacher,'' walked to his seat in parliament and stood behind him,
holding his hand high in the sign of victory after his win was
announced. But as he and others sang the national anthem, she held
back tears, bit her lip and remained silent.
</P>
<P>
   In a bow to her father Sukarno's legacy and Megawati's own
contribution to the transition from the autocratic rule of former
President Suharto, Wahid praised ``our second independence since
founding president Sukarno planted the flag upon our soil. I have
great respect for Madam Megawati. She must be respected for her
role in all this.''
</P>
<P>
   Megawati conceded victory to ``my dear friend'' and urged
loyalists to accept the result ``for the unity of our nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Megawati's bid failed in part because conservative Muslims
didn't want a woman president. She also became arrogant after her
June parliamentary win, critics say, refusing to lobby the assembly
and make deals with other parties _ one reason for her fallout with
one-time coalition partner Wahid.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid's election was cheered by many observant Muslims who have
felt sidelined in a country where they are the overwhelming
majority. They see Wahid's ascension as gaining unprecedented
influence for Islam in a diverse nation where ethnic Chinese and
Christians have held disproportionate power in economic, military
and political spheres.
</P>
<P>
   But others _ especially rank-and-file supporters of the woman
whose party won the largest number of popular votes in
parliamentary elections four months ago _ felt cheated. They called
the final result a mockery of the will of voters who favored a
pluralist nationalist leader.
</P>
<P>
   Megawati's party won 34 percent of the popular vote for
parliament in June, finishing first. Wahid's party finished third
with 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Street protests that followed Wahid's 373-to-313 victory _ which
surprised even many in parliament, where Megawati led in the early
vote count _ drew well over 10,000 people outside parliament alone.
</P>
<P>
   At the city's main traffic circle where Megawati loyalists had
camped out for days preparing to celebrate, her supporters seemed
stunned as a live television broadcast announced Wahid's name. A
few cried, others staggered around in a daze, and some _ in
apparent confusion _ jumped into the fountain where they had
planned to celebrate when victory seemed so sure.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of Megawati supporters then walked to a major
intersection where she and Wahid had promised to address the
people, but when the leaders were unable to arrive, angry youths
began occupying office buildings, setting fires and viciously
beating a few bystanders. Outside parliament, an apparent car bomb
exploded around 4 p.m., killing at least two people and sending
protesters and journalists scurrying at first, but failed to
disperse the crowd. In the morning, an explosive hidden in a flower
pot at the main traffic circle injured four Megawati supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, thousands of Megawati supporters trudged home
disconsolately, but several hundred continued to hurl stones,
sticks and firebombs at riot police and soldiers, who responded
with tear gas and, finally, shots. It was not clear if the bullets
were live or rubber.

   ``If you care about Megawati, go home!'' a party organizer

   ``I am very disappointed, because we paid such a high price for
these elections,'' said Rosita Sitohang, 36, a business owner,
holding back tears. ``This winner is not from the people, but from
the factions in parliament. . . . He just came out of the blue to
be president.''

<P>
   Given Wahid's ill health, Thursday's selection of a vice
president takes on greater significance. Wahid on Monday named the
ruling Golkar party's chairman, Akbar Tandjung, as his preferred
vice president. The ruling party Wednesday named the armed forces
chief, General Wiranto, as its No. 2 choice. But Wahid might have
to offer the slot to Megawati to appease the masses.

</P>
<P>
   In a search at the former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's
home and office, police officers found and seized what they said
were dozens of expensive gifts, including gold and silver objects,
that he should not have kept after leaving office. Netanyahu's
attorneys said that the items came from boxes that had not yet been
unpacked or sorted.

   WEST BANK: SETTLERS DIG IN
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of religious settlers showed up to dedicate a makeshift
synagogue at one of the illegal outposts destined to be torn down.
Havat Maon is the one outpost that contains a militant population
and authorities are most concerned about a confrontation with its
settlers.

   IRAN: 4 FACE DEATH
</P>
<P>
   The threat of death sentences loomed over four students and a
professor who went on trial in Tehran accused of insulting one of
Shiite Islam's holiest figures in a campus magazine satirical
dialogue that was denounced as insulting to the 12th Imam, whose
return is awaited by pious Shiites. Judge Saeed Mortezavi noted
that the death penalty has been applied in similar cases.

tanks to Turkey. The decision, approved by Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder, angered the Greens, his junior coalition partners. The
party is concerned that the tanks will be used against Turkey's

   BRITAIN: PADDINGTON UP AND RUNNING
</P>
<P>
   Trains were scheduled to resume running in and out of Paddington
Station in West London today more than three weeks after an
intercity express collided with a commuter train, killing 30
people. John Prescott, the deputy prime minister, said he would
await final studies before deciding whether to take authority over
safety away from Railtrack, a company that owns tracks, signals and
stations, which has been accused of placing profits before
standards.

<P>
   The Egyptian-born owner of Harrods, Mohamed Fayed, 66, will
learn from the High Court on Thursday whether his four-year-old
fight for British citizenship has been successful. His lawyers
argued that Home Secretary Jack Straw had acted in a
``disproportionate, irrational and unfair'' manner in refusing him
a passport. Straw ruled him ``not of good character'' for having
made payments to members of Parliament for favors.

   Foreign Minister Abel Matutes said the Spanish government would
not appeal if Home Secretary Jack Straw of Britain decided to free
Gen. Augusto Pinochet from house arrest on humanitarian grounds. A

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    (EDS: In two takes.)
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at q&AMP;a(at)ajc.com
</P>
<P>
   Q: I haven't seen William F. Buckley's TV show in quite some
time. What has happened to him?
</P>
<P>
   A: Buckley's PBS program ``Firing Line'' hasn't been broadcast
in some markets in recent years, which perhaps is why you haven't
seen him except when he turns up on other shows. But as of
December, ``Firing Line'' will end for good in all markets,
according to a spokesman for the program in New York. ``Firing
Line,'' which started in 1966 and has been seen on PBS since 1971,
is said to be the longest-running public affairs program on
television.
</P>
<P>
   But the show's demise doesn't mean that the
editor-author-commentator with the affected speech and dry
political wit is disappearing from the public eye. He will continue
to write and edit and make speeches, keeping his relentlessly
erudite and conservative views out front for everyone, including
many liberals who count themselves as fans.
</P>
<P>
   While he's best known for his political commentary, the
73-year-old Buckley of late has expanded to a new subject:
religion. Just last year, Doubleday published his 314-page ``Nearer
My God: An Autobiography of Faith.'' Buckley admitted that he is no
theologian, but he does have some expertise in Catholicism. He was
born into a wealthy and devout Catholic family, the sixth of 10
children.
</P>
<P>
   Q: New York Mets fans roasted Atlanta Braves fans because some
of the post-season games at Turner Field weren't sold out. How did
the teams compare in attendance at regular-season home games?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Braves were a clear winner: Braves 3,284,897; Mets,
2,725,920. A mitigating factor for Atlanta's Turner Field not being
filled for some of the games probably was because of the early
afternoon starting time mandated by TV, combined with the short
notice given to fans about the game time and the difficulty of
getting off work.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why are there so many fire ant hills this year? I've been
visiting my father's grave for 69 years and have never seen so many
mounds before. How do I get rid of them?
</P>
<P>
   A: Fire ant mounds may go undetected in hot, dry weather, so you
just didn't notice them before, said entomologist Beverly Sparks of
the University of Georgia. But as temperatures cooled and the soil
became saturated by fall rains, the mounds became conspicuous. An
observer may not even realize that an area is infested until the
upper portions of the mounds become more developed.
</P>
<P>
   To manage fire ant populations efficiently and economically over
large areas, you need to broadcast fire ant baits over the infested
area twice a year (spring and fall). Research shows that applying
fire ant baits will reduce ant populations by more than 85 percent
within four to 12 weeks, Sparks said.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I saw a recipe in the newspaper for a cheese mold with fruit
in the middle, but I lost it. Rosalynn Carter was making it for
ex-President Carter's birthday. Can you print it again?
</P>
<P>
   A: Here's how to make the appetizer: Combine 16 ounces of
cheddar cheese, one cup of mayonnaise, one cup of chopped pecans,
one small grated onion, black pepper to taste, and a dash of
cayenne pepper. If you mold the mixture into a circle, spoon a jar
of strawberry preserves into the center of the ring. Chill before
serving.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It was reported recently that Delta and Atlantic Southeast
Airlines put Andrew Young, his wife and nephew on a flight from
Atlanta to Roanoke, Va., which then made an unscheduled stop in
Asheville, N.C., so Young could make a speaking engagement on time.
Will the passengers who were inconvenienced and delayed by that
decision be compensated?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. On Oct. 1, Young and his party were scheduled to fly
from Washington to Atlanta on a Delta flight, then from Atlanta to
Asheville on ASA. Because the Delta flight from Washington was
delayed, they missed their connecting flight. So they were put
aboard ASA Flight 4715 to Roanoke, which made an unscheduled stop
in Asheville to let Young and the others off.
</P>
<P>
   ASA spokesman Sam Watts told Q&AMP;A that the Roanoke-bound
passengers arrived at their destination only 58 minutes later than
scheduled. ``We have done two things for the passengers on 4715,''
Watts said. ``Through media reports, we have apologized publicly
for any inconvenience. In addition, we have sent letters of apology
and provided a goodwill gesture of transportation credits to those
passengers affected.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: We read a lot about the Mount Washington Observatory weather
station in New Hampshire, but I've never seen anything explaining
what it does. Do you know?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's a non-profit scientific and educational institution
created to observe and record the mountain's extreme weather
conditions, conduct research, and promote the science, history and
natural history of the White Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   The first regular meteorological observations there were
conducted by the U.S. Signal Service, a precursor of the Weather
Bureau, from 1870 to 1892. Although its relationship with the
Weather Service always has been close, the observatory isn't part
of any government agency.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the facility unique is its location, on the summit of
Mount Washington at an elevation of 6,288 feet. The weather
extremes are said to be the greatest found outside the deep polar
regions, with cloud or fog at least 300 days out of the year,
annual temperatures ranging from 47 degrees below zero to 72 above,
as much as 556 inches of snow in a season, and a record wind
velocity of 231 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Online information is available at the observatory's Web site _
www.mountwashington.org/index.html _ and includes up-to-the minute
weather conditions at the station.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you explain the term ``Bible Belt'' as it's often used in
reference to the South?
</P>
<P>
   A: Bible Belt can be defined as an area, chiefly in the South
and Midwest, noted for its religious fundamentalism.
</P>
<P>
   A 1998 Southern Focus poll conducted by The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution and the University of North Carolina confirmed
that the roots of fundamental Christianity are deep, and the
influence of Bible-based beliefs pervades the region. The poll, for
example, showed that 9 out of 10 lifelong Southerners express a
firm belief in God.
</P>
<P>
   An article about the poll quoted Dan Carter, an Emory University
professor who has studied Southern culture for years, as being
impressed by the powerful relationship between the region and
religion. He cited this statement on a bumper sticker as expressing
it concisely: ``Jesus is coming. Y'all try to look busy.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: How can I find out when future shuttle launches are scheduled
from the Kennedy Space Center, say over the next six months? Is
that information published by NASA?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's as near as your telephone, but if you're planning a
Florida vacation around a launch, keep in mind that schedules are
subject to change because of weather, mechanical problems and many
other factors. The number to call for recorded information is
407-867-4636.
</P>
<P>
   These are launches currently scheduled: Discovery, Dec. 2, a
10-day mission; Endeavour, Jan. 13, 11 days; Atlantis, Feb. 10, 11
days; Discovery, liftoff ``no earlier than Feb. 24,'' 10 days;
Endeavour, March 23, 9 days; Atlantis, ``no earlier than April
20,'' 10 days; and Discovery, June 29, nine days.
</P>
<P>
   Q: For your readers who want to keep clothing sparkling clean,
can you share Major League Baseball's secret for maintaining such
white uniforms? Or are they discarded after every game and new ones
worn the next game?
</P>
<P>
   A: The uniforms are kept clean and reused. The Atlanta Braves
say they use a combination of Amway products and some
pretreatments, such as Shout or Spray and Wash. After pretreatment,
stains are scrubbed and the uniforms are soaked. Then, as quickly
after a game as possible, the uniforms are washed in as hot water
as tolerable. Bleach is not used, and the uniforms are hung up to
dry.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In a recent item about the Bataan Death March in World War
II, Q&AMP;A mentioned a Camp O'Donnell. For whom was it named?
</P>
<P>
   A: The U.S. Army Center of Military History has no definitive
explanation, nor does retired Army Maj. Richard Gordon, who
represents a group of Bataan Death March survivors. But both offer
some possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   There are two schools of thought, Gordon says. One is that it
came from an American officer of that name killed in the Philippine
Insurrection. The other, said to be a Filipino story, is that the
town's original name was Odonnel, traced to a Spanish officer.
</P>
<P>
   The Army Center for Military History quotes indecisive
information from the book ``O'Donnell,'' subtitled ``Andersonville
of the Pacific.'' The author, retired Army Col. John E. Olson,
traces the earliest written record to an account of the capture of
a remote town in the Philippines named O'Donnell. There's no
explanation for the Irish name.
</P>
<P>
   Olson's book also cites a ``prevalent rumor'' in the 1960s that
the camp was named for ``an Army Air Corps hero.'' Although a Maj.
Emmett O'Donnell Jr. did command a B-17 squadron at Clark Air Base
after September 1941, the camp name was published as early as 1900,
so that connection is impossible.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is known for certain. Camp O'Donnell was the terminus
of the Bataan Death March. And as such, it had this chilling
nickname: ``Camp O'Death.''

 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I paid into Social Security, but I lack about 24 quarters.
I'm 68 years old and retired, so it's unlikely that I will work the
remaining quarters I need to receive benefits. Can I be refunded
the money I paid in?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. People cannot withdraw their Social Security taxes, even
when no benefits are payable, according to Social Security
Administration rules. Under normal circumstances, 40 calendar
quarters are needed to qualify for retirement benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The Social Security taxes paid on a worker's earnings aren't
placed in an individual worker's account, but are pooled in special
trust funds from which benefits are paid to eligible workers and
families. Social Security's rationale is that it's a system of
social insurance under which covered workers and their employers
pay taxes to provide insurance protection for the workers and their
families. Such people are protected against the loss of income from
work because of the retirement, disability or death of the worker,
as well as hospital care costs in old age and in severe and
extended disability.
</P>
<P>
   So, to put it plainly: The program isn't intended to guarantee
the return of a person's Social Security taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where do I call to find out the winning numbers in the
Florida Lottery? I tried the number printed on the ticket, but it
doesn't work.
</P>
<P>
   A: It's 1-900-737-7777, with a charge to the caller of 77 cents
a minute. There's no toll-free number. A Florida Lottery spokesman
said calls won't go through if your phone has a block on 900 calls,
which involve a fee.
</P>
<P>
   An option for Internet users is the Florida Lottery's Web site _
www.flalottery.com/ _ which posts winning numbers. No charge for
viewing, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A newspaper item on the subject of flying a flag on the
Martin Luther King Jr. holiday referred to 10 federal holidays. I
can only think of seven. Can you list them all?
</P>
<P>
   A: There are indeed 10 annual legal federal holidays as declared
by Congress: New Year's Day (Jan. 1); Martin Luther King Jr.'s
Birthday (Jan. 15, but observed on the third Monday in January);
Washington's Birthday (Feb. 22, but observed on the third Monday in
February); Memorial Day (the last Monday in May); Independence Day
(July 4); Labor Day (the first Monday in September); Columbus Day
(the second Monday in October); Veterans Day (Nov. 11);
Thanksgiving Day (the fourth Thursday in November); and Christmas
Day (Dec. 25).
</P>
<P>
   Q: Some televised football games have a yellow line that appears
across the field designating where the first-down marker is. How is
this done?
</P>
<P>
   A: Talk about smoke and mirrors! New Jersey-based Princeton
Video Image calls the ``virtual first-down line'' one of several
innovations _ which include ``the virtual strike zone, real-time
box scores and more'' _ designed to enhance the viewer experience
of broadcasts. A person actually attending the games sees no such
thing, of course.
</P>
<P>
   The L-VIS (Live Video Insertion System) is described by the
company as a system of proprietary hardware and software designed
to insert electronic images into live televised broadcasts. The
inserted images may be two- or three-dimensional, static or
animated, opaque or semitransparent, and may be placed so they
appear to exist on the playing field.
</P>
<P>
   Before the broadcast, images to be inserted into the broadcast _
such as the first-down line or an advertisement that appears to
viewers to be on the stadium wall _ are prepared and the operator
identifies the location in the broadcast scene where they will be
inserted. The L-VIS system recognizes the scene in ``real time''
during the broadcast and inserts the image as instructed.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who assigns names to hurricanes, and why do they always have
America-style names? I am not a native of this country and find
this confusing.
</P>
<P>
   A: Names are selected from library sources and are agreed upon
by nations involved in international meetings of the World
Meteorological Organization. The names are chosen because they're
short and distinctive and easier to understand than the older,
cumbersone longitude-latitude identification methods when exchanged
between hundreds of widely scattered stations, airports, coastal
bases and ships at sea. At attempt is made to give some of the
storms names with what the WMO calls an ``international flavor''
because hurricanes affect, and are tracked by, nations other than
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Atlantic storms have a rotating six-year list of names. Some
samples of those that can be considered ``international'': (1999)
Jose, Philippe; (2000) Alberto, Ernesto, Rafael; (2001) Humberto,
Lorenzo, Pablo; (2002) Cristobal, Marco, Omar, Paloma; (2003)
Henri, Isabel; (2004) Tomas.
</P>

   Q: Our grandchildren have started collecting the Mint's 50 state
coins. Does anyone make a folder to put them into? I've tried
national bookstores with no luck.
</P>
<P>
   A: If you can't find something at a coin shop, the U.S. Mint may
have just what you're looking for. It's a map of the United States
_ The Official United States Mint 50 State Quarters Collector's Map
_ that folds out to about 3 feet in length, with pockets to hold
each state's coins as they are produced. The map has information
about each state, and the year each will be featured on a U.S.
quarter. The map costs $24.95 and can be ordered by calling
1-800-872-6468, or online at www.usmint.gov/catalog/help.cfm
</P>
<P>
   Another option is a folder available for $4.95 from Littleton
Coin Co. Call 1-800-645-3122 or, for online information and
ordering, check the company's Web site: www.littletoncoin.com

   Q : What has become of a striptease artist in the 1950s who
performed under the name Candy Barr? As I recall, she was convicted
of some crime and went to prison. I haven't seen anything about her
in years.
</P>
<P>
   A: At last report she was living near Brownwood, Texas, as
Juanita Phillips. Her birth name was Juanita Dale Slusher; Phillips
was the last name of one of her four ex-husbands.
</P>
<P>
   She was born around 1935 in Edna, Texas, and ran away at 12. As
a Dallas newspaper reported in a 1985 interview, she was a
prostitute in Dallas as a teenager, a stripper at 19 _ when she
took the name Candy Barr _ and, later, a nightclub performer in
Dallas and Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1957, Dallas narcotics officers arrested her at her
apartment on a charge of illegal possession of marijuana. After
being convicted and sentenced to 15 years, she entered prison in
December 1959, and was paroled after serving three years and 91
days. In 1967, Texas Gov. John Connally granted her a pardon.
</P>
<P>
   She tried dancing again, but her comeback failed. In the years
since she has published a book of poetry and posed for pictures in
Oui magazine, but other than that she seems to have dropped out of
public view.

CLINTON TO SEE BARAK AND ARAFAT IN EFFORT TO SPEED PEACE MOVES
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton will use a visit to Norway early
next month to give ``added momentum'' to the Middle East peace
effort and will meet there together with Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, administration
officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech to the Israel Policy Forum on Wednesday, Sandy
Berger, the national security adviser, said Clinton would reinject
himself into the negotiations between the two leaders because ``we
are at a pivotal strategic moment'' in carrying through on the Wye
River Accord, signed a year ago this week.
</P>
<P>
   All three leaders will be attending a commemoration for Yitzhak
Rabin, the Israeli prime minister who was assassinated four years
ago. Oslo was also the site of the 1993 peace accord in which
Israel first agreed to withdrawals from the West Bank and both
sides agreed to negotiate a final peace settlement.
</P>
<P>
   But progress since then has been episodic, and Clinton is
clearly concerned that the peace effort could simply drag on
without concrete results.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of his legacy issues,'' one of Clinton's top
foreign policy advisers said recently. ``Along with Ireland, and
getting China relations back on course, the Middle East is what he
wants to be remembered for.''
</P>
<P>
   Establishing just what role America will play, however, has been
a sensitive issue, as Berger acknowledged Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has made it clear that he hopes the United States will
lower its profile, and Berger suggested Wednesday that Washington
has taken on a more restrained role with the accord signed at Sharm
el Sheik, along the Red Sea in Egypt, in early September, two
months after Barak took office and formed a new government.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially a revision of the Wye Accord, the latest agreement
was negotiated without a visible American role, though Clinton and
Berger spent much of August on the phone to both leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement envisions the end of conflict between the
Palestinians and Israelis a year from now, with the emotional
issues of boundaries and the status of Jerusalem solved by that
deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have witnessed since then is powerful evidence that
having the two parties work together directly, while maintaining a
robust American role, is the most effective way to advance peace,''
Berger said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   While suggesting that Barak and Arafat are now able to deal
directly with each other, Berger was clearly making the case that
Washington remained an indispensable player in the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the Palestinian track, the parties at long last have agreed
to address the core issues that have defined their conflict for the
past 50 years and that will define the peace for generations to
come.
</P>
<P>
   ``It must not be said that when the parties were prepared to do
what we all along have pressed them to do, America opted for the
sidelines.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   His comments came as Clinton is still fighting the
Republican-controlled Congress over Washington's financial
contributions to the peace effort. Clinton sought $800 million to
finance the Wye accord this year and $500 million for next year.
But both were deleted from the Foreign Operations budget bill that
Clinton vetoed earlier this week. Berger said that ``the president
will not sign a foreign operations bill that does not contain this
funding.''

YANKS SEEK 25TH TITLE TO ROUND OUT CENTURY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JACK CURRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Wednesday was a casual day at Yankee Stadium. Only
about a dozen players worked out indoors on a voluntary basis,
David Cone bypassed throwing baseballs to pack two boxes and Joe
Torre wore blue jeans during a relaxing session with the smallest
assemblage of reporters he has seen in three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   A day and a half before this calm setting, the Yankees had
stymied the Red Sox to snatch the American League Championship and
rumble into the World Series. About twelve hours earlier, the
Yankees yawned and stretched while learning that the Atlanta
Braves, not the Mets, would be their opponents in Game 1 on
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Yankees admitted that they watched the Mets lose to
the Braves in a thrilling game that did not end until Wednesday
morning, which is why many of them looked so sleepy. While some
Yankees were disappointed that there would not be a Subway Series
that surely would have turned this city into wall-to-wall baseball,
others sounded relieved. The Yankees should be.
</P>
<P>
   As much pressure as is already inherent in trying to defend a
World Series title, especially for a historic team like the Yankees
and especially against a pitching-rich team like Atlanta, the
attention would have intensified even more drastically if the
series was New York, New York.
</P>
<P>
   The hype about the Yankees-Braves being a skirmish for who is
crowned the team of the decade will be persistent, but pursuing
that fabricated distinction is not as burdensome as trying to win
while being scrutinized by a city of eight million fans, all
experts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if we had played the Mets, it would be a much more
difficult situation,'' said Joe Girardi. ``Not from the standpoint
of who we played, but how you're remembered. If it was the Mets,
neither the Mets or Yankees would want to be remembered as the team
that lost. That would have been a hard thing because that's how the
players who played in that would have been marked and that's not
really fair.''
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of being brandished would have been especially
dangerous to the Yankees, who would have been the solid favorites.
Other than obviously winning their third title in four years, the
Yankees would have had little to gain in conquering the Mets
because George Steinbrenner would have expected it and they would
have had much more to lose, including some jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the back of our minds, everybody would have liked to play
the Mets to see what the city would be like, but, in a way, it is
kind of a relief,'' said Jeff Nelson. ``It would be a mad house
around here. Maybe it is a little relief that we don't have that.''
</P>
<P>
   But Paul O'Neill, who was chagrined that reporters were even
allowed in the clubhouse after the optional workout and then
lectured them about what is and what is not a legitimate story, did
not feel the Yankees will receive any benefit from the Mets going
home. To O'Neill, any World Series foe is scary.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pressure is to win the World Series, whether you play the
Mets, you play the Diamondbacks or you play the Braves,'' said
O'Neill. ``You're going to have to beat a quality team. Being with
the Yankees and having done what we've done, we've kind of set
ourselves up to where you got to win. That's all there is to it.
You win the World Series. You don't just get there.''
</P>
<P>
   Soaked with Champagne at Fenway Park on Monday night,
Steinbrenner vowed, ``We're not going there to lose, I'll tell you
that.''
</P>
<P>
   General Manager Brian Cashman, who has watched Steinbrenner
explode after losses to the Mets during spring training, admitted
that playing the Mets would have created distractions that might
have proved detrimental. Although Cashman stressed that the Yankees
have deep respect for the Braves, a team that stifled them twice in
three games this season, and will approach them in the same way as
they would have the Mets, there is a big difference between
opposing Atlanta and the team from Flushing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There would be a lot more at stake than just the World
Championship if we were playing the Mets,'' Cashman said. ``It
would be the city and bragging rights. That's a story within the
story, whereas now we're playing for the world title, which really
should be everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Since half of the Yankees took the day off, Torre declined to
discuss any rotation or roster decisions. But Orlando Hernandez is
on schedule to pitch the opener on Saturday and David Cone hinted
that he would start Game 2. There is a chance that Torre would
flip-flop Roger Clemens and Andy Pettitte, meaning that Pettitte
would pitch Game 3 at Yankee Stadium and a possible Game 7 on the
road and Clemens would only start Game 4.
</P>
<P>
   Torre explained how he is not as worried about O'Neill's
fractured rib as he was last week so the Yankees could replace
reserve outfielder Shane Spencer with Jim Leyritz. When Leyritz was
left off the ALCS roster, Torre told him he would probably be
reinstated if the Yankees advanced to the World Series. It helps
Leyritz that he belted one of the most important homers in recent
Yankees history off Atlanta's Mark Wohlers in Game 4 of the 1996
World Series, which the Yankees won in six games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had a little success against them,'' said Leyritz,
smiling.
</P>
<P>
   The team of the '90s debate will certainly follow this World
Series like a full-time scalper. Chili Davis called the matchup
``perfect'' and Alan Watson said it was ``neat,'' but some players
denounced the debate and most Yankees were quiet when asked to
select the team of the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our intention is to win the World Series,'' said Torre, ``but
not just so we're the team of the '90s.''
</P>
<P>
   Cashman was even more direct and said, ``I don't know what it
means to be the team of '90s. We're just trying to win this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Cashman paused and asked reporters, ``Are we the team of
the century?'' There was silence and then knowing laughter because
the Yankees have a record 24 World Series Championships and the
answer is obviously a resounding yes. Still, the Yankees know the
25th would end the century symmetrically and stylishly.

Manhattan, and take it them somewhere else. (Librado Romero/New

EPA CHIEF FINDS WTO A HARD SELL TO SEATTLE PROTESTORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT MCCLURE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ A boisterous crowd of eco-demonstators challenged the
United States' head environmental regulator Wednesday when she came
to Seattle with a seemingly conciliatory message: The World Trade
Organization, properly tweaked, could help preserve the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Peppering Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Carol
Browner and her Clinton administration allies with catcalls, the
protesters would not take yes for an answer.
</P>
<P>
   Browner and the other administration officials acknowledged that
the WTO must change significantly to better preserve the
environment. Critics say the organization's rules are being used to
subvert hard-won environmental protections.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we deal with the realities of global trade, it gives us an
opportunity to work around the world to secure environmental and
public-health protections,'' Browner said. ``The president has been
very clear that it is important to integrate environmental and
public-health protections in the WTO.''
</P>
<P>
   But the demonstrators were not swayed. Their signs answered:
</P>
<P>
   ``WTO _ Trading away life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``WTO  &QC;  Fascists.''
</P>
<P>
   And so did their voices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't fix it _ dismantle it!'' shouted one protester.
</P>
<P>
   The crux of the disagreement _ amending the WTO versus scrapping
it _ simmered just below the surface for most of a two-hour ``town
meeting'' in downtown Seattle. It was one of a series of appeals to
WTO opponents the Clinton administration is organizing in
preparation for a meeting of WTO ministers in Seattle Nov. 30-Dec.
1.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States can't impose an agenda on the rest of the
World Trade Organization,'' said Dorothy Dwoskin, assistant U.S.
trade representative. ``We are engaged in an important
consensus-building effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Browner started the meeting with a request to the approximately
175 people who showed up, mostly environmentalists: ``I would ask
you to do one thing, and that is listen with an open mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Browner and her fellow officials contend that if environmental
and labor protections can be written into WTO rules, countries
around the world will be compelled to go easier on the planet and
on workers in order to get a piece of the trade pie.
</P>
<P>
   Getting those rules written into the WTO, though, is going to be
difficult, they acknowledge. Poor countries suspect rich countries
of using environmental policies as self-enriching protectionist
trade policies.
</P>
<P>
   WTO defenders say the organization's rules are imposed only on
countries that wish to join. The rules, they point out, only say
that nations cannot discriminate against products because of where
they are produced. A shrimp is a shrimp. A chair is a chair.
</P>
<P>
   Critics, though, say countries should be allowed to
discriminate. For example, shrimp caught by fishing vessels whose
nets drown sea turtles are not the same as shrimp caught more
judiciously by boats equipped with special turtle-sparing devices.
</P>
<P>
   WTO rules, though, will soon force the United States to allow
the importation of shrimp from Pakistan, Malaysia, Thailand and
India _ even though shrimpers' nets there kill sea turtles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many say that Nelson Mandela would still be in prison if the
WTO had been in place then,'' said town hall panel member and
Washington state Rep. Velma Veloria, D-Seattle, recalling the
international boycott that forced South Africa to abandon its
institutionalized policy of racism.
</P>
<P>
   A key point of disagreement came over a WTO ruling that forced
Browner's agency to rewrite rules on imported gasoline. The rules
deal with measuring levels of pollutants in Venezuelan and
Brazilian gasoline imported for sale in pollution-choked
northeastern U.S. cities.
</P>
<P>
   Browner began to explain her position, but was interrupted by
members of the audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, we're not going to agree on this,'' Browner said.
``You are convinced that we changed an air pollution standard ... I
never, ever agreed to change an air pollution standard.''
</P>
<P>
   When a protester began to interject, she snapped: ``Excuse me,
but if you want me to answer the question, please pay me the
courtesy of listening to my answer. I paid you the courtesy of
listening to you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you?'' came the answer.
</P>
<P>
   Browner cut short her reply, asking ``Why don't we move on?''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Loy, U.S. undersecretary of state for global affairs,
insisted that the United States' internal environmental regulations
will not be affected by the WTO.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those national laws and regulations have to be protected, and
if it turns out at some point that those are under real attack,
we're going to have to do something about it,'' Loy said.
</P>
<P>
   Patti Goldman, a lawyer with the Earthjustice Legal Defense
Fund, said the Venezuelan gas case reveals that Loy's line already
has been crossed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not opposed to trade. ... Our complaint is with the
rules this organization has in place,'' Goldman said. ``The WTO
should not be second-guessing individual governments' decisions
about protecting the environment. ... The administration has
sidestepped the core issue.''
</P>
<P>
   She elicited an admission by Loy that the WTO's Committee on
Trade and the Environment, the organization's mechanism for
wrestling with environmental policy, is not adequate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way it operates, I don't think is right,'' Loy said. ``It
has not been a successful body. ... We need more than the Committee
on Trade and the Environment is going to be able to produce.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldman pressed on, accusing the administration of saying one
thing but doing another.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States has not been a passive victim of these trade
rules,'' Goldman said. ``It has been an active proponent when it
served our economic interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Examples Goldman cited include U.S. opposition to two European
Union proposals: ``ecolabels'' on paper products to inform
consumers about recycled content, and eliminating lead, cadmium and
other toxins in electronic equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The gathering ended when about a dozen ``radical cheerleaders,''
interrupting a scripted question-and-answer format, marched to the
front of the cavernous meeting room to chant in unison:
</P>
<P>
   ``WTO, your scheme and system we are going to overthrow. ... The
corporations have blood on their hands. When so few own so much,
it's time to take a stand. Take back the power. Stop corporate
greed.''
</P>
<P>
   Browner dashed out a side door to catch her plane back to
Washington, D.C.

could evict the museum from the city-owned building. If that
strategy succeeds, it could have a remarkable result. The museum,
not the city, owns the artwork. So if the museum were evicted, it

Manhattan, and take it them somewhere else. (Librado Romero/New

BOBBY VS. TOMMY: BOWDEN BOWL I
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bobby Bowden is never lacking for a one-liner, even on the eve
of history.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly every family member is converging on Clemson's Death
Valley on Saturday for college football's first father vs. son
game. If that wasn't enough, the Florida State coach will be going
for his 300th victory when he takes on Tommy and the Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   So how did Bobby feel about the matchup? Asked this week, he
said he was going to play his wife ``Ann's boy _ not mine but
Ann's.''
</P>
<P>
   Tommy, who has Clemson off to a respectable 3-3 start, didn't
miss a beat with a comeback.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I always wondered about that,'' he cracked. ``I'm
taller, my eyes are different than his. We've got to find that
guy.''
</P>
<P>
   The top-ranked Seminoles (7-0) might be fighting for a national
championship and dealing with Peter Warrick's legal troubles, but
the good-natured Bowden is trying to enjoy facing his son. At least
most of the family will be rooting for him, as Tommy duly noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's see, there's two parents and six kids and they'll all be
rooting for my father but me,'' Tommy Bowden said. ``No, my sister
will be with me since her husband's on my staff.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Kines, who is married to Tommy's sister Robyn, coaches
Clemson's defensive backs.
</P>
<P>
   It makes more sense for the family to pull for Bobby, because he
is chasing his 300th win, Tommy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd think they'd like to see one where we lose close; that way
it's OK for everybody,'' Tommy said.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Bowden anticipated this moment for a while but with son
Terry and Auburn. Terry resigned last year, but when Tommy left
Tulane for Clemson, the historic matchup was set again. Terry, an
analyst for ABC, will be in New York and can't attend.
</P>
<P>
   Today, at 9:30 a.m., the three Bowdens will hold an audio chat
on ESPN.com.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby is not taking his son's team lightly. The Tigers have
three other assistants with bonds to Florida State: Brad Scott was
the Seminoles' offensive coordinator, Reggie Herring was an FSU
linebacker and Rick Stockstill a former quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got so doggone many FSU people up there, it scares you to
death,'' Bobby Bowden said. ``They know more about us than we do.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemson's Bowden says the history probably won't hit him until
just before he's on the field Saturday night, seeing his father's
red, white and yellow outfit, preparing to shake his hand.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy knows what the two will talk about.
</P>
<P>
   ``How much (brother) Terry will criticize us on ABC,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Bad analysis: Louisiana State's 1996 recruiting class has
been a flop. Or maybe it's the recruiting analysts who are flops.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, some services had LSU's class 10th in the nation,
second in the SEC behind Tennessee. Coach Gerry DiNardo was hailed
as a recruiting genius. Today, only 13 of the 29 players signed in
1996 are on the team and LSU football is on the verge of collapse.
</P>
<P>
   The problems with the class have been many: Players quit, were
kicked off the team, flunked out, failed to qualify for entrance
and transferred to other schools. It's just one more example that a
good recruiting class doesn't necessarily translate into a winning
season.
</P>
<P>
   __ Silent treatment: South Carolina coach Lou Holtz wasn't
exactly real chummy with Arkansas coach Houston Nutt when they
shook hands after the Hogs' 48-14 victory. In fact, the Gamecocks
coach didn't say anything to Nutt. Holtz also blew off Arkansas
assistant coach Keith Burns.
</P>
<P>
   Nutt and Burns played for Holtz when he was at Arkansas. They
also served as graduate assistants on his staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope he wasn't mad after the game,'' said Nutt, who mostly
restricted his offense to straight handoffs after grabbing a 38-7
lead in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew he was probably hurt and discouraged. At first, I
thought he thought I was trying to run the score up. The
first-teamers were out by midway through the third quarter. He
didn't say anything. He walked away so I walked away. I just think
when you're 0-7, that's tough. Everywhere he's been, from the
national title and all the highs, coming back to Little Rock,
that's not easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Holtz did his best spin-control on the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't anything to say. They beat us,'' he said.
``Houston knows how I feel about him. I'm very proud of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever you say, Lou.
</P>
<P>
   __ Shake it up: Cal's players and coaches got a nice jolt from
Saturday's 7.1 earthquake, with the the team hotel swaying for more
than a minute.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the players and coaches handled it fine, except for
offensive coordinator Steve Hagen, who was on the 14th floor. He
promptly fled the hotel, drove his rental car to a vacant parking
lot across the street and slept in the car the rest of the night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in a lot of earthquakes,'' Hagen said. ``I've been
in my living room during earthquakes, I've been in my backyard
during earthquakes, but I've never been in a 19-story building
during an earthquake. It was freaky.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Hagen: ``I was on the 14th floor. It scared me to death,
especially hearing the building creak like it was breathing.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Stat of the week: In Georgia Tech's past 13 games,

__ No. 3 Nebraska (6-0) at No. 18 Texas (5-2) &QL; 
Since the Big 12 began playing football in 1996, the Longhorns are
2-0 against the Cornhuskers, prevailing both times as double-digit
underdogs. Texas won the 1996 league-title game 37-27 in St. Louis
and pulled off a 20-16 upset last season in Lincoln, Neb., ending
the Cornhuskers' 47-game home winning streak. Nebraska is 25-4
against Big 12 opponents, but half of those losses have come to
Texas.

</P>
<P>
   The Ravens are always in games, making them close, hanging
around. Their last four contests have been decided by seven points
or less. Normally, your typical Kansas City team, which won in Week
5 against New England and had a bye last week, would lose a game
they were expected to win after winning a game they were expected
to lose. This Chiefs team has a different feel and they also have
the better offense.

advertising the museum's controversial exhibit, ``Sensation.'' City
Hall's lawsuit against the museum over its showing of ``Sensation''
could evict the museum from the city-owned building. If that
strategy succeeds, it could have a remarkable result. The museum,
not the city, owns the artwork. So if the museum were evicted, it
could theoretically pack up all its artwork, the second largest
collection in the country, after the Metropolitan Museum of Art in
Manhattan, and take it them somewhere else. (Librado Romero/New

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The target of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's public fire in
his battle against the Brooklyn Museum of Art has been the museum's
trustees, whom the mayor says he wants to oust as irresponsible and
insensitive for staging an exhibition he considers offensive.
</P>
<P>
   But City Hall's lawsuit against the museum has a different and
specific goal: to evict the museum from the city-owned building on
Eastern Parkway in Brooklyn. If that strategy succeeds, it could
have a remarkable result. The museum, not the city, owns the
artwork. So if the museum were evicted, it could theoretically pack
up all 1.5 million artworks, the second largest collection in the
country, after the Metropolitan Museum of Art in Manhattan, and
take them somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   Anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Mayor Joseph Lhota acknowledged this possibility when he
was questioned recently by lawyers for the museum. After agreeing
that the museum owns the art, Lhota was asked to consider what
would happen if the city succeeded in terminating the museum's
lease.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you aware that if that corporation is ejected from the
building, it can remove its property and go elsewhere?'' Susan
Buckley, a lawyer for the museum, asked Lhota.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am aware of that,'' he answered. ``I would like to say that
`it can,' I think, should be changed to `it will' have to take its
artwork and move elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Buckley continued: ``And it could move it to Los Angeles,
couldn't it?'' Lhota replied, ``My answer to your question is
yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the museum trustees who expect the worst from the mayor say
they find it impossible to believe that he would go through with an
eviction. It has taken the museum a century to assemble its
collection through acquisitions, private donations and expeditions
to the far regions of the earth.
</P>
<P>
   Trustees have donated millions of dollars for building
improvements. To them, the notion of moving vans pulling up to cart
off Egyptian mummies and African fertility statues and bucolic
Winslow Homer paintings seems too preposterous to consider, except
that this is precisely what Giuliani is demanding. It is right
there in his lawsuit, which asks a judge to order that the museum
``deliver possession of the premises and the building thereon to
the city.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just can't believe he means it,'' said Frieda Rosenthal, a
vice chairwoman of the Board of Trustees. ``I don't really believe
they could do this. It would be so harmful to the city.''
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``What would the city do with the building? It's all
been redone. It's suitable just for us, with special climate
control and remodeled galleries.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the trustees, there is speculation that Giuliani
miscalculated and assumed the board would back down rather than
fight it out in court. Some suspect that Giuliani knows he cannot
win in court, and so he is simply trying to make as much noise as
possible to increase his support among conservative voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's always been threatening gestures,'' said Barbara
K. Debs, a trustee and chairwoman of the museum's strategic
planning committee. ``I'm quite sure that he felt we might actually
back down, but it's very hard for me to figure out the real motives
of any of this. It just strikes me as bizarre.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael D. Hess, the corporation counsel, said Wednesday that
the mayor has no desire to see the collection ``scattered about''
to other cities. The mayor's intent, he said, is to gain leverage
over the museum's board. Lacking any clear authority to remove the
trustees himself, the mayor hopes that the trustees will, if
evicted, voluntarily agree to cede ownership of the art to the city
rather than see it leave Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   ``My feeling,'' Hess said, ``is that if we win the eviction, the
practical result is that the art will not be scattered all over the
place. Human beings of good faith will find a way to work it out.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hess acknowledged the risks implicit in the city's strategy.
What happens should the trustees decide they cannot stomach giving
Giuliani control of more than $1 billion worth of art?
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess what they own they would have to take with them and
either set up a collection elsewhere or merge it with other
collections,'' Hess said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Debs barely paused when asked if the museum would ever
agree to surrender the art for the sake of keeping it in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't see it happening,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Other trustees laughed at the idea, in part because they were so
confident of victory in court. As with another of the mayor's
recent forays into First Amendment territory _ his failed attempt
this summer to ban a youth rally in Harlem _ city lawyers have been
unable to cite a legal precedent that squarely supports his
position.
</P>
<P>
   In perhaps the most analogous case, a federal judge ruled in
1991 that the city of Miami violated the First Amendment when it
tried to evict the Cuban Museum of Arts and Culture from a city
building for displaying art that angered Cubans in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   In Brooklyn, Judge Nina Gershon of the U.S. District Court is
expected to rule soon on whether Giuliani's decision to cut off
public financing and seek eviction has likewise violated the First
Amendment. In a brief hearing Wednesday, Gershon gave City Hall
until noon Thursday to submit final papers in the case.
</P>
<P>
   For a time, city officials sought to sidestep the First
Amendment issues by raising as reasons for eviction the museum's
initial plan to restrict children from viewing the ``Sensation''
exhibition and its decision to charge adults $9.75 for admission.
They had said that the city's lease required the mayor to approve
such conditions.
</P>
<P>
   But in arguments before Gershon, the city's lawyers abruptly
dropped those issues as grounds for terminating the lease. They
also abandoned the argument that the museum violated its lease by
staging an exhibition to advance the commercial interests of
Charles Saatchi, the wealthy British advertising entrepreneur who
owns all 90 of the works. Despite Giuliani's threats, his lawyers
have yet to assert in court that he has the authority to remove
trustees from the museum board.
</P>
<P>
   The only official empowered under state law to act against
trustees of charitable institutions is the attorney general,
lawyers in the case said.
</P>
<P>
   This leaves Giuliani with but one remaining rationale for
eviction. By staging an exhibition of ``sick stuff,'' the mayor and
his lawyers contend, the museum violated a provision in its lease
from 1893 requiring it to ``enlighten, educate and provide
enjoyment.''
</P>
<P>
   Arnold Lehman, the museum's director, and Robert S. Rubin, its
chairman, declined to comment on what would happen to the art if
the museum were evicted. According to a recent sworn statement
submitted to Gershon by Lehman, the mere threat of eviction has
already inflicted ``extraordinary damage'' on the museum. Donors,
he said, have called to express ``very serious concerns'' about the
museum. Lenders of art have called to ask whether their pieces
``will be returned safely.'' The museum, he said, ``cannot
responsibly make plans for future exhibitions.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Giuliani this month, District Council 37, the
municipal union that represents 5,800 employees in 20 of the city's
cultural institutions, warned that the mayor's actions have
imperiled the jobs of its members at the Brooklyn Museum. ``This
union can't stand idly by and allow the jobs of our dedicated
workers to be threatened,'' union leaders wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Floyd Abrams, the museum's First Amendment lawyer, is
squeezing the eviction issue for all it is worth in the battle for
public opinion. Almost gleefully, he raises the prospect of moving
vans spiriting art off to, say, New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``The museum would own the art, so the board would have to
consider where to set up a new museum,'' he said with a smile. ``I
assume there would be a serious amount of bidding by other museums
in the country.''

TRADE DEFICIT NARROWED IN AUGUST AS EXPORTS GREW 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY JR.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Reflecting some long-awaited gains from economic recovery
abroad, the huge American trade deficit narrowed in August for the
first time in four months as exports rose faster than imports.
</P>
<P>
   Financial markets reacted calmly to Wednesday's government
report, a sharp contrast to the previous month, when currency and
bond markets fell after the Commerce Department reported a large
increase in the trade gap at a time when Japanese authorities were
doing little to reverse a worrisome rise in the yen. Indeed,
indications that the trade gap may no longer be widening appear to
have contributed to a powerful rally in stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The latest tally showed a gap between exports and imports of
$24.1 billion, down from $24.9 billion in July.
</P>
<P>
   With economies in Asia, Latin America and Europe on the mend,
demand for American exports of goods and services is finally
improving. But some experts worry that such gains will only further
stoke a U.S. economy that is already operating at a pace that
leaves the Federal Reserve nervous about revived inflation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This confirms that economic growth overseas is taking hold,''
said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at Wells Fargo &AMP; Co. in
Minneapolis. Noting a near-doubling of American exports of
aircraft, he added, ``Asian airlines are buying again because their
traffic has built tremendously.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, however, the U.S. deficit with China soared to
$6.9 billion, the largest ever with any country, from $6.3 billion
in July. This prompted a fresh expression of unhappiness in
Washington, where support for China's efforts to join the World
Trade Organization seem to be fading.
</P>
<P>
   ``U.S.-China trade remains a troubling story,'' William Daley,
the commerce secretary, said. American imports from China exceeded
exports by an additional $6 billion so far this year compared with
the similar period in 1998. He said that at talks set in Seattle
next month he would keep pressing the Chinese to remove obstacles
to American companies seeking to do business there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everywhere you look, you see stuff made in China,'' said James
Glassman, senior U.S. economist at Chase Securities, adding that
the primary ``culprit'' causing the widening of the nation's trade
imbalance in previous months was recession in Asia rather than any
lack of competitiveness on the part of American business, as was
the case in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The government's statistics on trade between individual
countries, which are not adjusted for normal seasonal variation,
also showed that the deficit with Japan shrank in August to $6.4
billion, from $6.8 billion in July.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the report showed, exports climbed $2.9 billion in
August, to $82 billion, while imports rose $2.1 billion, to $106.1
billion. That reduced the trade gap $800 million, with July's gap,
upon revision, moderately lower than first reported.
</P>
<P>
   This was the eighth consecutive monthly rise in imports,
reflecting the continued domestic boom and by far the largest of
three consecutive gains in exports.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're starting to see evidence of global healing,'' said
Richard Berner, chief U.S. economist at Morgan Stanley, Dean
Witter.
</P>
<P>
   Still, while encouraged by rising exports, Berner said the trade
deficit could easily expand again in coming months since exports
must grow 30 percent faster than imports at current levels merely
to keep it steady.
</P>
<P>
   James Annable, chief economist at Wingspanbank.com, also
expressed concern about the impact of American consumers' strong
demand for foreign goods. If this doesn't subside, he said, the
deficit could swell enough that the dollar would weaken, tending to
bring inflation, higher interest rates or both.
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, the deficit is raising far fewer alarms than it
did a decade ago; it is less than 3 percent of gross domestic
product, about half a percentage point less than a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   That is largely because American industry is making immense
investments in new equipment that should raise productivity.
Moreover, consumers are likely to slow spending since rising
interest rates have nearly ended home refinancings which, along
with the stock market, had helped fuel the current binge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not in the worst of all worlds yet,'' Annable said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States' trade deficit with Canada, muddied by
border-area production for tax reasons and other issues, climbed to
$3.5 billion from $3.1 billion for the month while the deficit with
Mexico was essentially unchanged at $2.2 billion. The American
deficit with Western Europe narrowed to $4.4 billion, from $6.1
billion.
</P>
<P>
   For the industrialized countries of the Far East _ Hong Kong,
South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan _ the gap shrank to $1.7 billion,
from $2.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest rise in imports in August was for industrial
supplies and materials _ mainly crude petroleum that has risen
sharply in price this year. Petroleum imports rose to $5 billion,
from $4.44 billion in July, as the price for a barrel jumped to
$17.40, the highest level since March 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The next biggest increase was for automotive vehicles, parts and
engines.

 &HT;    Bowdens getting ready for family feud
 &HT;    By Tom DeAngelo
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The college student was in no mood for
pranks _ especially ones aimed at his father.
</P>
<P>
   So West Virginia tight end Tommy Bowden told his dad to stop the
car one Sunday morning as the family was headed for church. Right
there, along the main street on the Morgantown campus, was a
crude-looking dummy hanging from a tree by its neck with a sign
that read ``Coach Bowden.''
</P>
<P>
   Tommy hopped out of the car armed with scissors. A security
guard appeared and said, ``You can't cut that down.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's my father,'' Tommy replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``You still can't cut it down,'' the guard said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to cut it down,'' Tommy said, ``I want to add to
it. He's not fat enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Bowden, of course, freed the likeness of his father from
the noose that day 25 years ago. But Saturday, he has the chance to
tighten the grip around the old man's national championship hopes
in a game featuring more intrigue than perhaps any other in the
history of college football.
</P>
<P>
   When Bobby Bowden's Florida State Seminoles play Tommy Bowden's
Clemson Tigers, the game not only will mark the first time in NCAA
football history a father and son have faced each other as head
coaches, but it could result in Bobby's 300th victory. If Clemson,
a 16 1/2-point underdog, pulls off the upset, Tommy will be toasted
in South Carolina as if it were his 300th victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a national championship at stake,'' Tommy said. ``All
the pressure is on him. It's an opportunity for me to enjoy the
game. They'll be tightened up over there _ one slip and they're
out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bowden Bowl is more than father vs. son, it's a family
affair. Also on the sidelines will be Bobby and Ann Bowden's
youngest son Jeff, Florida State's receivers coach, matching wits
against brother-in-law Jack Hines, Clemson's secondary coach. Hines
is married to the Bowden's oldest child, Robyn.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, Terry Bowden, the former Auburn coach who was
supposed to play his Dad this season before resigning last season,
will be in the ABC studio to analyze the game.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves Ann, Bobby's wife of 50 years, and the rest of the
children _ Steve Bowden and Ginger Bowden Madden _ to watch from
the stands, along with many of Bobby and Ann's 21 grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once I get there and see Tommy on one side and Bobby on the
other, I think I am going to retreat up to the end zone and let my
emotions hang out,'' Ann said.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy, 45, is the Bowden's second-oldest son, behind Steve, the
only son not in coaching. Tommy, according to the family, is most
like his father in his personality, his beliefs and his religious
convictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a scaredy cat,'' Bobby said. ``I was always afraid to
try things. If we were going in a swimming pool, Terry would run
and jump in before he'd see if there was water in it. Tommy was
like I was. I would go up to the water put my toe in and pull it
out. Then I'd stick my ankle in and pull it out. Then I might
finally go in if it was just right.''
</P>
<P>
   But Tommy was not scared the night he tracked down a fraternity
president and demanded he send a retraction to the local newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The frat boy, a West Virginia student, wrote a letter to the
editor criticizing Bobby and saying the players did not have
confidence in their coach. Tommy saved it in his wallet for six
months, the time it took to track down the author.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy took six teammates, including FSU's current strength and
conditioning coach Dave Van Halanger, and visited the fraternity.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was upstairs and someone said a couple of people want to
see you,'' the 6-foot-6 Van Halanger said. ``He came downstairs and
his face turned white. We said, `We don't want to have trouble but
we could start trouble. We just want you to write a retraction.' He
said, `Yes sir.'''
</P>
<P>
   Watching how his dad handled adversity was an important lesson
for Tommy, who decided at an earlier age than Terry or Jeff that he
wanted to coach. Ann still keeps a paper Tommy wrote in sixth grade
about how he wanted to be a football coach. And unlike Steve, who
has his Ph.D. in philosophy, and Terry, an Oxford graduate who has
a law degree, and Jeff, who graduated from Florida State, Tommy
majored in physical education at West Virginia with the sole
purpose of becoming a coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tommy didn't prepare himself for any other profession but
coaching,'' Terry said.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy took a much different path than Terry. Although two years
younger than Tommy, Terry's first full-time job was as a head
coach, at Salem College in 1983. Tommy had seven stops before his
first head coaching job, at Tulane in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terry wants the brass ring right away,'' said Ginger, 38, the
youngest of the Bowden children. ``Tommy is more willing to take
the longer route to get to the same place. ... take a lot less
risk. Dad is not a big risk taker. ... except with his offense.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the Bowdens felt pressure to follow Dad into coaching,
and none was being compared to Bobby. Terry believes Steve's
decision not to pursue the profession was the best thing for him,
Tommy and Jeff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve, being the oldest son, he may have felt the most
pressure to be Bobby Bowden's son,'' Terry said. ``When he didn't
become a coach, that took the pressure off of us. The oldest son is
supposed to take over the legacy. It kind of freed us up to do what
we wanted to.''
</P>
<P>
   The three coaching sons have worked for their father. Tommy's
career started in 1978 at Florida State. After switching jobs five
times, he was hired by Pat Dye at Auburn, where he was eventually
reunited with Terry after Terry replaced Dye in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew he could coach,'' Dye said. ``What I didn't know is
what a class guy he is and the character he had. Tommy Bowden is
real. A lot of people project what Tommy Bowden is. I can tell you
now Tommy Bowden is genuine.''
</P>
<P>
   Before he was at Auburn, Tommy spent three years coaching
receivers at Alabama for coordinator Homer Smith. Tommy's offensive
philosophy was rooted in Tuscaloosa.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Bobby visited Tommy at Auburn to talk about the shotgun
formation. Bobby had never used the offense and figured he had the
perfect quarterback for it in Charlie Ward.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby took it back to Tallahassee, redesigned his two-minute
offense using the shotgun and by the end of the season he was
running it on almost every down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terry copied it as soon as I did,'' said Bobby. Terry was in
his final season at Samford.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy was feeling pretty good about teaching his dad something
about the game when he had his most humbling experience as a coach
the next year. That was when Terry was hired at Auburn and Tommy
was forced to work for his younger brother.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had been working hard in the SEC to get a job like that and
all of a sudden your younger brother gets that job in your home
state,'' Tommy said. ``I didn't work 15 years to work for my
younger brother.''
</P>
<P>
   When Terry was hired, he was told he had to fire the entire
staff, including his brother. Terry told Auburn officials he would
not take the job if he had to fire Tommy. ``I felt that was not the
way to start my career in Division I,'' Terry said.
</P>
<P>
   Terry won the struggle and named Tommy receivers coach, although
he was technically the offensive coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody was blaming Tommy for not being able to run the
offense (under Dye),'' Terry said. ``I didn't name him coordinator
because I thought we wouldn't be any good and I wanted to take all
the blame. But he was the coordinator. I just had the title.''
</P>
<P>
   Terry's prediction was way off. The Tigers went 11-0, but
because of NCAA sanctions were not eligible for a bowl. Otherwise,
the first father-son match-up could have occurred Jan. 1, 1994, in
the national championship game. Instead, the door was open for
Bobby to win his first and only title, which he did with a victory
over Nebraska in the Orange Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Tommy joined Terry as the only Bowdens to finish a
season undefeated as a head coach, leading Tulane to an 11-0
record. Bobby still is looking for his first perfect season after
34 years. But like Terry, Tommy did not coach the bowl game,
leaving for Clemson before the Green Wave's final game.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a little bit of needling, but Dad's response is
neither of you coached in the bowl game at the end of the
(undefeated) season,'' Terry said.
</P>
<P>
   Standing in the way of Bobby's undefeated season this week is
his son, but that will not stop Tommy from trying to break his
father's heart. The Bowdens are a competitive family and will use
any tactic to win, whether it's a trick play on the football field,
or tricks on the golf course.
</P>
<P>
   If Saturday is anything like the Bowdens' annual Father and Sons
Skins game at the Tyndall Air Force Base in Panama City each
summer, Tommy isn't about to give his old man a break.
</P>
<P>
   Every summer, sides are picked for the outing. According to
Steve, Bobby was on the winning side in the inaugural match 13
years ago after some creative scorekeeping and even more creative
shots. From that point on, the tournament was dubbed the Tyndall
Swindle and the losing team receives a trophy of a slack-shouldered
golfer.
</P>
<P>
   ``There ain't nothing but cheatin' going on, full-blooded
cheatin','' Bobby said. ``There ain't a lie you can't improve.
There's a lot of trash talking going on. Talking on somebody's back
swing, disrupting them.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, a good ol' family feud, just like the one that
will take place at Memorial Stadium.

 &HT;    First Union sells stamps, phone time via ATMs
 &HT;    By Jeff Ostrowski
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ First Union is selling long-distance
phone time and postage stamps through its ATMs.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's sixth-largest bank is among the first to turn
automated teller machines into vending machines.
</P>
<P>
   It's a trend that could catch on, bankers say. ATMs soon could
sell traveler's checks and tickets to movies, concerts and
ballgames.
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte, N.C.-based First Union sells MCI long-distance
service at its 2,900 ATMs on the East Coast.
</P>
<P>
   The ATMs don't dispense calling cards. Instead, they print
receipts that list an 800 number and a long-distance code.
Customers can buy 30 minutes for $8.40 or an hour for $16.80.
</P>
<P>
   First Union also sells stamps in packages of 18 for $6.60.
That's 66 cents more than at the post office, a trade-off for
convenience.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 10 First Union ATMs in Palm Beach County and the
Treasure Coast hawk stamps, because they take space otherwise
occupied by cash, said Gary Bargeron, the bank's vice president of
ATM operations.
</P>
<P>
   Some banks plan to use ATMs as vending machines; others are
waiting to see how the strategy works.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Levan, president of BankAtlantic in Fort Lauderdale, said
his ATMs will sell stamps and phone cards in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   NationsBank says it won't sell through ATMs because customers
don't want to wait while someone else shops.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always joke that I don't want to wait in line behind the
person who's buying opera tickets,'' said Ann DeFabio, spokeswoman
at NationsBank parent Bank of America, also based in Charlotte.
``We're still looking at the convenience factor.''
</P>
<P>
   First Union's Bargeron says it's a balancing act.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ATM can become an electronic vending machine,'' Bargeron
said. ``All that has to be couched in the mantra of fast,
convenient transactions.''
</P>
<P>
   First Union (NYSE: FTU, $37.38) wouldn't say how much it expects
to make from ATM sales.
</P>
<P>
   Wells Fargo of San Francisco and BB&AMP;T of Winston-Salem, N.C.,
also use ATMs as vending machines.
</P>
<P>
   Bank critics say the trend of squeezing more profits from ATMs
weakens the industry argument that customers should pay fees to use
ATMs owned by banks where they don't have accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes it a whole lot harder to argue that they need those
surcharges,'' said Gail Hillebrand of Consumers Union in San
Francisco.

FEARFUL OF ISOLATION IN RETIREMENT, GAY GENERATION SEEKS HAVENS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Calif., N.Y.)  
 (Expands and clarifies third graf; editing and smoothing changes
throughout)   (bl)  
 By RICK BRAGG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ David Krongelb, a Fort Lauderdale businessman, came out
of the closet in his 20s and believed that the door would never
close on him again. He is 50 now, and wonders if he will need that
secret place again when he grows old.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're old,'' he said, ``the last thing that you want to
do is to have to hide.'' .
</P>
<P>
   Many gay Americans who, like Krongelb, have lived openly as
homosexuals well into middle age are now worried that
discrimination will have them retreating into secrecy if they enter
retirement communities or nursing homes. As independent adults,
they have been able to pick their neighbors; as aged people needing
care, their choices would be limited. And where many have been able
to defy bias and so lead prosperous and rewarding lives, they
wonder whether their strength in old age will allow them to
continue doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the first openly gay generation grows grayer and
contemplates retirement, developers around the country are planning
retirement communities and assisted-care complexes marketed
specifically for homosexuals, places that will allow gays to grow
old surrounded by other gays, where they do not have to live, and
ultimately die, amid lingering condemnation.
</P>
<P>
   In Fort Lauderdale, Boston, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Atlanta
and other cities, these developers _ many of them gays themselves,
who have their own fears of old age _ are promising a haven for
those who will become old and infirm, many without the support of
children or other relatives.
</P>
<P>
   For gay men in particular, the ones who have lived into middle
age with the stigma of AIDS and talk of shortened lives, the idea
of living too long once seemed novel. But gays around the country
say retirement has been dinner-table conversation for the last few
years, and the talk is growing more urgent as they grow older.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always ask, `What are we going to do?''' said Jeffrey
Dillon, 37, who, along with John DeLeo, 54, is developing a
270-unit assisted-care high-rise in downtown Fort Lauderdale.
</P>
<P>
   DeLeo and Dillon envision a community where gay couples can live
together in peace, where loneliness can be staved off and the
residents insulated from the meanness outside.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Schieman, an assistant professor of sociology at the
University of Miami who specializes in aging, said such
developments could become more than just places to grow old among
people with similar pasts and similar stories.
</P>
<P>
   ``What defines later life for gays?'' Schieman said. ``Many of
them have not formed any kind of nest.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Gay men in particular,'' he said, ``saw a truncated life,''
because of AIDS, and spoke more of dying young than of growing old.
``They deal with a lot of loss, loss of partners, and loss of
friends.''
</P>
<P>
   The survivors often find themselves with an isolation that is
complete, or almost so, when they finally enter retirement homes
for the general population.
</P>
<P>
   Of the gays-only retirement developments, Schieman said, ``Here,
you have a new form of self-segregation.'' . But it is one many
gays say they would find far preferable to fighting old battles _
or hiding _ amid a colony of elderly strangers.
</P>
<P>
   One woman who has hidden is Evelyn Kinser, a 76-year-old
resident of a Los Angeles retirement home. Her life now, she says,
is like being a girl again, made to feel ashamed again.
</P>
<P>
   ``A sad world to live in,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kinser came out when she was 12, a pioneer of sorts. Like
Krongelb, she thought she was out for good. But now, living in the
home for the elderly, she hides her sexual orientation, out of fear
she will be ridiculed or isolated.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a hard way to live, having to be someone you're not,''
she said. ``I don't talk to my neighbors about much of anything.
Except sports. That's a safe topic.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kinser has never told other residents of the home that she
is a lesbian. But she knows that they know she is different.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen that look in their eye,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Even friends who give her that look are better than no friends.
So she remains quiet, although she is tired of doing so.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm closeted again,'' she said. ``I hate it.''
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of special housing for elderly gays cite a number of
incidents as evidence of a need for it. In 1996, for instance, a
lesbian couple who had shared a home for years were forbidden to
stay together in an assisted-living center in northern California,
said Doni Gewirtzman of the Lambda Legal Defense and Education
Fund, the gay rights group.
</P>
<P>
   And some years back, a nursing home employee refused to give a
resident a bath after learning that she was a lesbian, according to
the New York chapter of Senior Action in a Gay Environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very daunting, especially for those people who have been
out a long time,'' said Sandy Warshaw, director of policy education
and community outreach for that organization.
</P>
<P>
   Max Weatherly, 78, lives in public housing in Delray Beach, ,
amid neighbors who are not unkind to him but with whom he has
little in common. To him, a self-contained, gays-only retirement
home would be a utopia.

BRAZIL IS BUYING DOLLARS, PUTTING NEW PRESSURE ON ITS CURRENCY 
</HEADLINE>
  (pr) 
 By SIMON ROMERO    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ Facing market pressure to meet obligations
to foreign creditors, including an outflow of capital, Brazil found
its currency under stress for a seventh consecutive session
Wednesday, with the currency fluttering around a psychological
threshold of 2 to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   The Brazilian real weakened to a rate of 2.007 to the dollar,
its lowest level in more than seven months, before recovering a
little to settle in New York at 1.9890 after new unemployment data
suggested a modest improvement in economic activity.
</P>
<P>
   Still, currency traders remained jittery as concern grew over
recent government actions that have caused the currency to weaken.
</P>
<P>
   In moves that surprised many people, the Brazilian Treasury has
purchased hundreds of millions of dollars from banks in the last
three weeks to pay off installments and interest on foreign debt.
By doing so, it departed from a strategy of dipping into the
central bank's foreign-currency reserves to honor obligations
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The logic behind such a move has to do with Brazil's agreement
with the International Monetary Fund, which put together a $41.5
billion bailout package for the economy early this year. The
agreement requires Brazil to maintain $22 billion in
foreign-currency reserves, aside from money from the IMF and other
international organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, this means that the government has to buy the
dollars it needs elsewhere to prevent a depletion of reserves. Yet
while the central bank president, Arminio Fraga, expressed calm
over the effect this has had on the Brazilian real's value, saying
his concern is focused on inflation, a declining real has generated
some alarm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some elements are sensing weakness on the part of the
authorities and are wondering how far the real can be pushed,''
said Alexandre Fialho, head of the foreign-exchange desk at
Finambras Corretora, one of the country's largest currency-trading
houses.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the concern stems from an easing by the central bank of
the sale of dollar-linked bonds, which it used until recently to
curb the real's decline. The bonds themselves, which now account
for a quarter of the domestic debt, may have generated wider
anxiety over the debt service burden, since financing costs rise
with the weakening of the currency.
</P>
<P>
   Still, such concern may be overdone as recent data show an
improvement in the fundamentals of Brazil's economy. The data
released today said that unemployment fell in September to its
lowest level this year, 8 percent, down from 8.3 percent in August.
And the deficit in the current account, a wide measure of foreign
transactions, shrank to 4.69 percent of the gross domestic product
in the 12 months ending in September, down from 5.14 percent in the
previous 12-month period.
</P>
<P>
   ``Logic is not the currency market's forte,'' said Roberto
Macedo, an independent consultant and economics professor at the
University of Sao Paulo. ``The pressure from external commitments
is passing and should be absorbed with time.''

AIRLINES CONTINUE TO REPORT WEAK QUARTERLY PROFITS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The nation's airlines continued to report weakened third-quarter
earnings Wednesday as rising fuel prices, the growing number of
airplane seats and bad weather helped to reduce profits from last
year's record highs.
</P>
<P>
   US Airways, Trans World Airlines, and the UAL Corp., the parent
of United Airlines, all disappointed Wall Street, while the AMR
Corp., the owner of American Airlines, was the lone bright spot.
</P>
<P>
   After four consecutive years of record profits, many airline
executives contended they had finally learned how to increase
profits consistently in the notoriously cyclical industry. But even
as the domestic economy remains strong, carriers are having
difficulty maintaining past earnings levels. Third-quarter profits
were also down at some other major carriers. Part of the problem is
that the number of new seats is growing faster than the number of
new passengers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating in a reasonably good operating environment,
year over year, that we haven't been able to keep our shareholder
returns up,'' Gerard J. Arpey, AMR's chief financial officer, told
reporters Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   UAL said its net income fell to $456 million, or $3.75 a share,
from $516 million, or $4.02 a share, in the corresponding period
last year. Revenue rose 1.3 percent, to $4.85 billion from $4.78
billion. UAL, which is the nation's largest employee-owned company,
reports results as if all employee shares have been distributed.
</P>
<P>
   The earnings just missed the $3.76 a share average estimate of
analysts polled by First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
   Rono Dutta, UAL's president, said the performance of United,
which is the world's largest airline, was strong in July and
August. But last month, Hurricane Floyd forced the airline to
cancel 750 flights, costing it $15 million. Revenue per seat
declined 3 percent domestically during the quarter, while it rose
12 percent overseas. The airline's costs were up 3 percent, mainly
because of higher wages and salaries, Dutta said.
</P>
<P>
   AMR said Hurricane Floyd cost it $17 million after it canceled
700 flights. But a hurricane also upset American's operations last
year, neutralizing the effect of Floyd on this year's earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Profits declined 36 percent during the quarter to $279 million,
or $1.76 a share, from $433 million, or $2.49 a share in the third
quarter last year. Revenue rose 2.1 percent, to $5.1 billion from
$5.05 billion last year. The average estimate of analysts surveyed
by First Call/Thomson Financial was $1.69 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Arpey of AMR said the average cost of jet fuel had risen 3
cents, to 56 cents a gallon, in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Arpey said an offer made on Monday by Air Canada to
buy the rival Canadian Airlines with the financial backing of UAL
and Deutsche Lufthansa A.G. was not credible. The Air Canada bid
counters an offer, backed by AMR, from the Onex Corp., a Canadian
buyout specialist.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing in it for any of the Canadian
constituencies,'' Arpey said of the Air Canada proposal, ``and
there is certainly nothing in it for AMR shareholders.''
</P>
<P>
   US Airways, which is the nation's sixth-largest airline and has
struggled all year, continued to disappoint Wall Street. It lost
$85 million, or $1.19 a share, during the quarter in contrast to a
profit of $142 million, or $1.51 a share, in the period last year.
Revenue fell to $2.1 billion from $2.2 billion last year. Analysts
had predicted a 33-cent loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``These results are clearly unacceptable,'' said Rakesh Gangwal,
the president and chief executive of US Airways. ``Our operational
difficulties during this quarter have taken a significant toll on
our financial performance.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Hurricane Floyd, which forced the airline to
cancel 1,500 flights, US Airways suffered from shortages of pilots
and airplanes because of slowdowns in its training and maintenance
operations. As a result, the capacity, or number of seats, fell 6.6
percent. Its costs, which were already the highest in the industry,
soared to 13.51 cents per seat-mile flown from 12.26 cents in the
third quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   TWA said it had suffered from rising fuel costs and the threat
of a strike by its flight attendants and machinists. Its loss
widened to $36.2 million, or 61 cents a share, from $923,000, or 11
cents a share, in the period last year. Revenue rose 1.5 percent,
to $876 million from $863 million in 1998. Analysts polled by First
Call had expected TWA to lose 52 cents during the quarter.

ABC NOT REQUIRED TO PAY DAMAGES TO FOOD LION SUPERMARKET, APPEALS
COURT RULES 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: 2nd take will move by 10:15 p.m. ET.) 
(js) 
 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A divided federal appeals court Wednesday threw out all but $2
of the remaining $315,000 in damages that a jury had ordered ABC
News to pay to the Food Lion supermarket chain after it reported
that the grocery chain sold beef and other food that was tainted.
</P>
<P>
   In the majority opinion, a panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals, in Richmond, wrote that Food Lion's attempt to win a
multimillion-dollar fraud verdict because two ABC employees had
lied their way into jobs in Food Lion stores was ``an end-run
around First Amendment strictures foreclosed'' by existing legal
precedents.
</P>
<P>
   The case had been closely followed by major news organizations
that feared that, unless constitutional barriers were explicitly
provided in lawsuits focused on newsgathering techniques,
plaintiffs could win cripplingly high damage awards without having
to prove that the news reports in question were false or malicious.
Specialists in media law said the ruling Wednesday set high
constitutional hurdles for plaintiffs whose lawsuits focus on
journalists' newsgathering techniques and could blunt that line of
legal attack.
</P>
<P>
   The case was initially filed in a North Carolina court after the
ABC program ``Primetime Live'' broadcast a report that Food Lion
workers mixed out-of-date beef along with new beef. The report also
included videotapes secretly made of the chain's employees.
</P>
<P>
   An earlier federal district court ruling in the Food Lion case
struck down most of the $5.5 million in damages awarded by the jury
in the fraud suit, but did so on narrow grounds that avoided First
Amendment issues. The $315,000 punitive damage award which the
district court had left standing was struck down by the appeals
court Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   With the appeals court's ruling only $2 of the original damage
award remains untouched. The jury awarded Food Lion $1 because the
journalists had trespassed on the supermarket chain's property and
$1 because they had breached their legal duty to be loyal to their
employer.
</P>
<P>
   David Westin, the president of ABC News who was the network's
general counsel when the lawsuit was filed, applauded the ruling,
which, he said, ``should help blunt'' an ``important and dangerous
shift.'' Instead of plaintiffs ``challenging what we said, through
libel and defamation, they are trying to get around through the
back door, attacking the process we used to get'' the information
used in news reports.
</P>
<P>
   Westin and several specialists in media law said that the high
hurdles faced by libel plaintiffs have led plaintiffs to attack not
the substance of news reports, but the sometimes questionable way
journalists gathered their information _ in this case, ABC
reporters' deception on their job applications.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the court wrote in its majority opinion Wednesday, ``We
are convinced that the media can do its important job effectively
without resorting to the commission of run-of-the-mill'' breaches
of the law.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd Abrams, a partner at the law firm of Cahill Gordon &AMP;
Reindel who is a well-known First Amendment specialist, said of the
case Wednesday that: ``What people have tried to do is an end run
around the First Amendment protections that exist in libel law.
This case is a quintessential example. Food Lion didn't care at all
that two employees had false information on their applications for
employment. What they cared about was what ABC said about them.''

 &HT;    Reeves to Chandler: Stay in
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Falcons coach Dan Reeves reminded quarterback Chris
Chandler in a talk this week that part of his job description
includes setting an example.
</P>
<P>
   Simply put, Reeves wants Chandler to start and finish a game.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler's season has been an exercise in frustration. He missed
three of six regular-season games with a right hamstring injury. He
also left two regular-season games when he aggravated the injury.
</P>
<P>
   Then, during Sunday's game against the Rams, Chandler left in
the third quarter of a 41-13 loss with flulike symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler said that Reeves pulled him; he did not ask to be taken
out. And after taking intravenous fluids, he wanted to return. But
if he had taken an IV before the game, Chandler might have felt
well enough to start and finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to make sure we're on the same page,'' Reeves
said. ``(The conversation) was mostly things that are private. We
tried to get him to take an IV; he didn't want it. We can't force
anything on (players).''
</P>
<P>
   Chandler, a 12-year veteran, has never had a season without
missing games because of injuries or illness. Since joining the
team in 1997, he has missed seven of 38 regular-season games and
left 10 others.
</P>
<P>
   When the Falcons signed Chandler to a five-year, $27 million
contract before last season, Reeves said the team was taking a risk
on a player with a history of injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're sticking our necks out,'' Reeves said at the time.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Chandler still had a cough, but he said he felt
better.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are very few people who should and do care about how I
feel,'' he said. ``(We) didn't talk about IVs. (Reeves) said some
things, I said some things, and that was about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Left tackle Bob Whitfield, who has played in 108 consecutive
games and started 102 in a row, said players like himself and wide
receiver Terance Mathis, who has started 62 games in a row, aim for
durability.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we try to do is set examples,'' he said. ``You see
Terance practicing every day and playing, and he doesn't get hurt.
You see me practicing every day and playing, and I don't get
hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Dallas quarterback Troy Aikman has missed 15 games in the 1990s,
and San Francisco's Steve Young is about to miss his 14th in five
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   However, Green Bay passer Brett Favre has started 114 games in a
row, Tampa Bay's Trent Dilfer 69, Miami's Dan Marino 46, and
Pittsburgh's Kordell Stewart 38.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves said his team desperately needs Chandler to get in a
rhythm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chris... hasn't played enough (this season) to see things,''
Reeves said. ``You don't just go out there and start playing and
all of a sudden get your timing back.''

 &HT;    Looking for jackpot in the slot
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Thrashers undeniably have a relative shortage of
speed and skill. But with a little attitude _ and perhaps a
willingness to trade body parts for goals _ from the players, coach
Curt Fraser is convinced that goals don't have to be a rare
occurrence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rebounds, tips, all those things come from a willingness to go
to the net,'' Fraser said. ``You're going to get whacked. You're
going to get a stick in the mouth. But that's what's going to give
you an opportunity to score. After awhile, your skin gets thick,
and the rewards start coming.''
</P>
<P>
   Similar to the key in basketball, the slot area between the two
faceoff spots is where a majority of the damage is done in hockey.
As a player, Fraser, who did not have a lot of natural ability,
would park himself in the slot, when he wasn't in the corners. From
the slot, he created traffic, followed shots and scored 193 goals
in 12 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked playing there, but that's where I had to play to be
successful,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, his players have to follow that example. The Thrashers have
scored 14 goals in six games, and nine of those came in ties with
Buffalo (5-5) and Tampa (4-4). They scored two goals in one game
but one each in the other three.
</P>
<P>
   A 4-1 loss to the New York Rangers on Sunday exemplified the
problems, Fraser said. By his count, the team had 64 offensive
opportunities, including official shots, blocked shots and shots
that went wide of the net. Second attempts, however, could be
counted on one hand. Seldom did the Thrashers have a player in
front of goalie Mike Richter to set a screen or get a rebound.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to pay the price if you're going to score goals,''
forward Kelly Buchberger said. ``(Edmonton's) Ryan Smyth isn't a
great skater or shooter or passer, but he pays the price, and he's
hungry and he goes to the net.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A basketball player has to put his time in the paint to get
rebounds, and it's the same in hockey,'' Andrew Brunette said.
``You're going to take some abuse in there, but that's how you
score goals, especially with how we're going to play. We're not
going to go around three guys and beat the goalie and score. We
have to find other ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not always going to get rewarded, that's for sure,''
Brunette said. ``Maybe one every 20 times, you'll get a goal, if
that. You usually get a whack or a cross-check or a punch in the
head.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson Emerson said, ``We're all trained to get in there. But
the other team is trained to keep you out of there. I know I've
seen a lot of pucks on the ice. I've just got to be quicker getting
there.''
</P>
<P>
   As evidence that skilled players aren't needed to score goals,
Fraser cites career minor-leaguer Craig Fisher. In 1995-96, Fisher
scored an IHL- leading 74 goals for the Orlando Solar Bears. ``He
was a soft guy, not tough at all,'' Fraser said. ``But there was
nothing getting between him and the net. I've seen him get smoked
and his helmet go 20 feet in the air. But he kept at it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can work on it, teach it and insist upon it. But a player
has to be willing to get into that position.''
</P>
<P>
   BRIEFLY
</P>
<P>
   A doctor confirmed Wednesday that defenseman Maxim Galanov needs
surgery on his broken left hand. It's expected that he will be
placed on injured reserve and be sidelined for about four weeks,
but he probably will seek a second opinion. Galanov started
experiencing pain after the first exhibition game, but doctors said
the injury might have occurred last season when he played for the
Pittsburgh Penguins.... Left winger Matt Johnson (groin) and
defensemen Petr Buzek (hip) and Yannick Tremblay (hip flexor)
missed practice Wednesday. Tremblay is questionable for Saturday's
game against Colorado, but Buzek and Johnson should be ready.
Because of the defensive shortage, Steve Staios skated on the blue
line.... The Thrashers are not going to change the scheduled
faceoff times for Saturday's game against Colorado or Oct. 31
against Ottawa, despite conflicts with the World Series. The
Halloween game could not be switched to the afternoon because
Ottawa plays in Florida the night before.... As projected, Vladimir
Vujtek, who is expected to be activated in time for Saturday's
game, skated on a line with Patrik Stefan and Emerson.

JUDGE RULES GROCERY CHAIN CANNOT USE A TAX SHELTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A tax court judge has ruled that Winn-Dixie Stores cannot deduct
interest paid on loans it took out on life insurance policies
covering 36,000 of its employees in 1993, throwing into doubt
several billion dollars of income tax deductions taken by hundreds
of major corporations since 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Winn-Dixie's corporate-owned life insurance program is ``a sham
for tax purposes,'' Judge Robert P. Ruwe wrote in a strongly worded
81-page opinion reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of big corporations have taken out life insurance
policies on all their workers and then borrowed back the premiums,
creating an income tax deduction for the interest expense. The
companies said the deduction helped pay for life insurance benefits
for their workers. In 1996, Congress outlawed the practice.
</P>
<P>
   Winn-Dixie said it ``followed the letter of the law'' in
designing its program and would appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The case, the latest in a string of victories by the Internal
Revenue Service against corporate tax shelters, is significant
because many similar programs are more aggressive than
Winn-Dixie's.
</P>
<P>
   Winn-Dixie, which operates nearly 1,200 grocery stores in 14
states, took out life insurance policies on 36,000 of its 109,000
workers and then borrowed the cash value of the policies at more
than 11 percent interest, taking a $3.7 million tax deduction for
1993.
</P>
<P>
   Michael J. Henke, a lawyer with Vinson &AMP; Elkins in Washington
who represented Winn-Dixie, said that ``if the judge finds that
this is a sham, then all of these things are shams,'' because ``we
spent a lot of time at trial attempting to show the judge that the
Winn-Dixie program was very middle of the road.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not an aggressive policy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Henke said his client ``threaded the statutory needle'' in
designing its plan and that it served a legitimate business purpose
of helping pay for employee benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``This decision,'' Henke said, ``runs roughshod over a long
history of congressional actions.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruwe relied heavily on internal company documents in finding
that the program was a sham meant solely to generate tax
deductions. He reproduced a chart that showed money flowing from
the IRS to Winn-Dixie and then flowing in a circle between
Winn-Dixie and the American Heritage Life Insurance Co., a unit of
the American Heritage Life Investment Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The judge also quoted at length from internal memos that said so
few employees died before quitting or retiring that ``the cost of
providing the benefit is insignificant.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a disappointing opinion that the judge painted with a
broad brush'' that will affect many other companies, said Lawrence
M. Hill, a tax specialist at White &AMP; Case in Manhattan, who has a
similar case in U.S. District Court.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas P. Ochsenschlager, a tax partner with the Grant Thornton
accounting firm in Washington, said that ``this was a very popular
shelter, but a lot of us wondered why it wasn't challenged before
this.'' He added, ``The IRS already has the tools it needs to deal
with all the crazy schemes out there, and they never seem to use
those tools, but maybe that is changing.''
</P>

   In recent months the IRS has won cases against Compaq Computer,
United Parcel Service and other companies. Ochsenschlager said this
suggested there was no need for Congress to pass broad new
authority for the IRS to challenge corporate tax shelters, as the
Clinton administration has requested.

 &HT;    Barcelona first to reach Champions quarterfinals
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The legendary _ and notoriously crabby _ Johan Cruyff
says he isn't watching the first group round of the European
Champions League because it is ``decaffeinated.''
</P>
<P>
   The new, but not necessarily improved Champions League, which
has gone from 24 to 32 teams this season, has drawn complaints from
players, coaches and international soccer officials, as the global
calendar grows increasingly unwieldy.
</P>
<P>
   After the fourth match day of Champions League play concluded
Wednesday, only Barcelona, the defending Spanish champions, had
clinched a spot in the quarterfinal round that begins next month.
</P>
<P>
   Barca's deep, flexible lineup has remained injury-free, unlike
some of the other leading European powers, and has been disciplined
in avoiding cards and suspensions. In tough Group B, Barca routed
Arsenal 4-2 in London on Tuesday, getting goals from Rivaldo on a
penalty kick and Luis Enrique a minute apart in the first half to
set the tone. Next week's showdown between Arsenal and Fiorentina,
a 3-0 winner over AIK Stockholm, should determine the other
qualifier from that group.
</P>
<P>
   Defending champion Manchester United, which has struggled in the
past month, had its 19-match Champions League unbeaten streak
snapped Tuesday in a 1-0 loss to Olympique Marseille in Group D.
Next week's United match at Croatia Zagreb is crucial for its
advancement hopes.
</P>
<P>
   Real Madrid thrashed Porto three weeks ago, but the Portuguese
champions, playing at home, held on for a 2-1 win on two goals from
Mario Jardel to take the lead in Group E. AC Milan dropped a 1-0
decision on Hertha Berlin, which now leads Group H. Right behind is
enigmatic Chelsea, which throttled Galatasaray 5-0 in Istanbul on
Wednesday as Tore Andre Flo had two goals.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio is on the verge of advancing from Group A after soundly
defeating Slovenian side Maribor 2-0. In Group F, Rangers grabbed
the lead with a 4-1 win over PSV Eindhoven as Dutchman Michael Mols
had two goals. Valencia and Bayern Munich played to a 1-1 draw in
Spain.
</P>
<P>
   ENGLAND: SUNDERLAND GOES THIRD
</P>
<P>
   A goal in the 80th minute by Premier League scoring leader Kevin
Phillips lifted Sunderland to a 2-1 win over Aston Villa on Monday
and into third place, a point behind Manchester United and two
behind Arsenal. ITALY: INTER SUFFERS FIRST LOSS
</P>
<P>
   A goal by Venezia's Filippo Moriero was enough to hand Inter
Milan its first loss of the season in a 1-0 surprise on Sunday.
Lazio took a slim Serie A lead with a 3-0 win over Udinese....
Zinedine Zidane's first goal in 10 months, on a free kick, lifted
Juventus to a 1-0 win over AS Roma, which lost for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   GERMANY: BAYERN THRASHES HERTHA
</P>
<P>
   Bayern Munich chased away some demons in destroying Hertha
Berlin 3-1 in its best Bundesliga outing of the season. Paulo
Sergio had two goals and Giovanne Elber, who signed a long-term
contract extension, had the other. The club also has dropped
troubled Mario Basler and Sven Scheuer from the active roster after
they got into a fight at a Munich restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   SPAIN: BARCA DRAWS TWICE
</P>
<P>
   Newly promoted Numancia got its best result of the Primera
Division season when Pachete scored the tying goal in the final
moments of injury time in a 3-3 draw with Barcelona. The defending
champions also missed out on three points last week when Real
Madrid's Raul scored a late equalizer to salvage an electrifying
2-2 draw at the Nou Camp.
</P>
<P>
   MEXICO: TOLUCA WIDENS LEAD
</P>
<P>
   While three of the four group races in the Torneo Invierno
appear to be up for grabs through the end of the season, Toluca
took a big step last week toward wrapping up a playoff spot. The
defending Verano season champions routed hapless Leon 5-2 on Sunday
as Carlos Maria Morales had two goals. Toluca, which has 25 points
in Group 1, has a comfortable 11-point lead. Second-place UAG was
routed 4-0 by Club America as Cuauhtemoc Blanco, Pavel Pardo and
Fabian Estay had goals.
</P>
<P>
   SOUTH AMERICA: RIVER DUMPS BOCA
</P>
<P>
   Two goals by Pablo Aimar fueled River Plate to a 2-0 win over
Buenos Aires rival Boca Juniors on Sunday in the ``El Classico''
grudge match as the victors took over first place in the Apertura
season.... Penarol defeated Montevideo rival Nacional 2-1 on Sunday
to win the Uruguayan Clausura season and set up a two-leg matchup
between the two clubs to determine the overall champion.

 &HT;    A series for the ages
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ They shall be known, simply and forevermore, as the
Fall Classics.
</P>
<P>
   Someday, when you're awfully low, when the world is cold, you
will feel a glow just thinking of them. Games 5 and 6 of the 1999
National League Championship Series. The Fall Classics.
</P>
<P>
   Years from now, you'll gather the grandkids at your knee and
begin: ``Back in '99, just before the turn of the millennium, in
quaint old ballparks without retractable roofs, the Braves and Mets
played the most remarkable series of games you ever saw. And those
last two games? Well, folks just called 'em the Fall Classics.''
</P>
<P>
   Two games in two cities. Two games spread over three days that
spilled into the wee hours of a fourth. Two games that lasted
nearly three games, two extra-inning games totaling 26 innings and
untold tension and drama, heartache and gallantry, improbable
heroism and rain, lots of rain. Two games that each concluded in
the most implausible manner, one leaving the Mets high, if not dry;
the second prompting Dixie delirium and this Internet headline:
``Subway Series? No thanks, we'll walk.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, as Saturday night awaits a Braves-Yankees '96 redux and the
first World Series game at Turner Field, take a moment and look
back in wonder: The Fall Classics, indeed.
</P>
<P>
   GAME 5
</P>
<P>
   It took the Mets three batters to score twice off Greg Maddux.
It would be another 14 innings before they'd score again. By then,
Mets coach Mookie Wilson was recalling his playing days. This day:
Oct. 15, 1986, when the Mets and Houston went 16 innings in the
Astrodome in Game 6 of that NLCS.
</P>
<P>
   In '86, the Mets scored three runs in the ninth to force extra
innings; once in the 14th, only to see Billy Hatcher homer in the
bottom half; and finally three more times in the 16th, only to see
Houston score two before Jesse Orosco saved the longest day and the
NL pennant.
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday in Shea, though, proved even longer, if an inning
shorter. The longest postseason game in major-league baseball
history lasted 5 hours, 46 minutes. What began in late-afternoon
sunshine ended in a dark-of-the-night downpour, courtesy of a
baseball rarity: A grand-slam single.
</P>
<P>
   When Robin Ventura, just 1-for-18 in the NLCS after starting out
0-for-16, launched Kevin McGlinchy's pitch over the right-center
field wall, the Mets had staved off elimination for a second
consecutive game. This was far more dramatic than Game 4; Atlanta,
somnolent all that day, had taken a 2-1 eighth-inning lead Saturday
on back-to-back homers by Brian Jordan and Ryan Klesko, only to see
John Olerud's two-out, two-run single in the bottom half glance off
the diving Ozzie Guillen's glove for a 3-2 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Yet that paled beside Ventura's Sunday best. Never mind that
after Ventura rounded first base, Todd Pratt touched second, then
raced back to embrace Ventura and turned his grand slam into an RBI
single. Shea was electrified. The Braves, mortified.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys were down coming back on the plane,'' said Braves
hitting coach Don Baylor. Atlanta _ chasing bad pitches all game
long _ left 19 runners on base, hitting 4-for-29 with men on base,
3-for-20 with men in scoring position. There was Maddux's failed
suicide squeeze-turned-double play in the sixth inning. In the
13th, Keith Lockhart was easily thrown out at the plate on Chipper
Jones' double. Even after Lockhart tripled home Walt Weiss in the
top of the 15th, the Mets rallied against the rookie McGlinchy, the
last guy left in Atlanta's bullpen on a day-night the teams used a
total of 45 players.
</P>
<P>
   After loading the bases and walking in the tying run, McGlinchy
gave up Ventura's blast. That gave the Mets the chance to become
the first team in big-league history to overcome an 0-3 deficit. It
also set the stage for perhaps the most riveting back-to-back games
in major-league postseason history. Or as Brian Hunter, who would
become one of Atlanta's many Game 6 heroes, said, ``The last two
games are probably the best two games in a long time.'' Perhaps
since Games 6 and 7 of the 1991 World Series, when Minnesota's
Kirby Puckett homered off Charlie Leibrandt in the 11th to force a
Game 7. Then John Smoltz matched zeroes with Jack Morris before
Gene Larkin's pinch single in the 10th gave the Twins a 1-0 win and
the title.
</P>
<P>
   GAME 6
</P>
<P>
   This looked easy. Al Leiter hit two of the first three men he
faced, got no one out and the Braves scored five times in the first
inning for a 5-0 lead. Easy, right? Look again. The Mets got three
runs off Kevin Millwood in the sixth before the Braves' first
unlikely hero surfaced in the bottom of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Hernandez, who lost his starting shortstop job after Game 3
of the Division Series, stroked a two-out, two-run pinch single in
the bottom half. But when Mike Piazza completed a four-run uprising
in the seventh with a two-run homer off Smoltz, it was tied 7-7.
When Melvin Mora's pinch single put New York up 8-7 in the eighth,
more Atlanta heroes emerged.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Perez, voted the MVP of the NCLS after hitting .500
(10-for-20) with two homers and five RBIs, singled off John Franco.
Enter Otis Nixon, the pinch runner who is 40 years old, looks 60
facially but ran like 20 in stealing second and taking third on
Piazza's throwing error. Nixon scored on Hunter's single, his first
hit of the entire postseason.
</P>
<P>
   After the Mets took a 9-8 lead in the 10th, Andruw Jones led off
with a single and advanced on pinch hitter Ryan Klesko's one-out
walk. Enter Guillen, who at 35 has lost a step but not his ability
to hit a fastball. Even the blazing fastball of Mets closer Armando
Benitez, who'd allowed just one Atlanta baserunner all year in 10
2/3 innings of relief. Guillen drilled a single to right to tie it.
</P>
<P>
   The 11th? Heavenly after Williams _ 1 for his previous 21 _ made
an adjustment, waiting long enough to pull an 0-2 off-speed pitch
from Kenny Rogers for a double. As Bret Boone's sacrifice moved
Williams to third and Chipper Jones came to the plate, Baylor was
already thinking three batters ahead and talking in Andruw Jones'
ear.
</P>
<P>
   Baylor knew the Mets would intentionally walk Chipper Jones,
``and I knew they wouldn't pitch to Brian Jordan.'' That left
Andruw Jones. ``Uh-oh,'' Baylor thought, ``my impatient young
hitter, they're going to give him a chance to win the ballgame for
us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets did, walking Jordan to load the bases with one out. By
then, Baylor had already told Andruw Jones what he'd been preaching
in the batting cage all year and earlier that night: ``Just relax,
take a deep breath, be selective and get a good ball to hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Jones, the most impatient Atlanta hitter, found himself
ahead 2-0 in the count, then 3-1, and showed some restraint. Then
the count ran full and Rogers made his 3-2 delivery. ``Usually,''
Baylor recalled later, ``Andruw swings at that pitch _ five feet
outside!'' And Baylor grinned, chuckling. When Jones took ball
four, Williams safely touched home plate (``I just wanted to make
sure I didn't take wings,'' he later said), Jones reached first and
52,335, the largest crowd in Turner Field history, went berserk one
last time. ``Well,'' Braves president Stan Kasten said later in the
clubhouse afterglow, ``baseball got what it wanted.'' Perhaps. If
not an all-New York Subway Series, then a Braves-Yankees World
Series for validation as the Team of the '90s. But whatever that
outcome, we've already got something to treasure forever: The Fall
Classics.

PARTIES TRADE ACCUSATIONS OVER RACE AND NOMINATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., S.D., N.C., Mo., Texas)  (mk) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The two political parties traded angry accusations
over race and nominations Wednesday after the Democratic leader of
the Senate accused Republicans of demonstrating an ``array of
anti-minority sentiment'' in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic leader, Sen. Tom Daschle of South Dakota, said
the Republicans had shown a ``pattern'' of insensitivity to
minorities, and called on Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., the chairman of
the Foreign Relations Committee, to show a ``change of heart'' over
President Clinton's nomination of Carol Moseley-Braun as ambassador
to New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   Moseley-Braun, D-Ill., who had been the first black woman
elected to the Senate, lost her re-election bid last November.
Helms, who has had run-ins with her in the Senate, made clear this
week that she would not have an easy confirmation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The array of anti-minority sentiment expressed almost each
week now by Republicans is historic,'' Daschle said at his weekly
Capitol news conference. ``I have never seen a party become this
defiant when it comes to protecting minority rights in my time in
public life.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., the majority leader,
shot back by recalling the Senate confirmation hearings, when the
Democrats were in the majority, in which Anita Hill accused
Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment. The spokesman, John
Czwartacki, echoing a phrase Thomas had used, said he found
Daschle's remarks ``ironic'' coming from a member of a political
party that he said ``attempted a high-tech lynching of the Supreme
Court's only African-American justice.''
</P>
<P>
   The bitter exchanges escalated the political warfare over
Clinton's nomination earlier this month of Moseley-Braun. Helms,
who as head of the powerful Senate Foreign Relations Committee has
stopped the appointments of other high-profile diplomatic nominees,
said this week, ``This nomination comes o the Senate with an
ethical cloud hanging over Ms. Moseley-Braun.''
</P>
<P>
   The exchanges also came at a time when both parties recognize
minorities as a crucial voting bloc. Black voters turned out in
record numbers in some areas last November, helping Democrats win
some House seats as well as the governorship of South Carolina.
Hispanic voters helped Democrats in California and were considered
crucial to the coalition that propelled Gov. George W. Bush, now
the Republican Party's front-running presidential contender, to
re-election in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Helms this week attributed his reservations about Moseley-Braun
to ethical questions. In a statement criticizing her actions as a
senator, he went on to wonder ``if the president and his associates
even examined her record before submitting it to the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   During her failed re-election bid last year, Moseley-Braun was
heavily criticized for her 1996 meetings with the former Nigerian
dictator, Gen. Sani Abacha, and dogged by accusations _ never
proved _ that she used 1993 campaign money to pay for personal
luxuries. She was defeated by Peter Fitzgerald, a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   But Helms also suggested to a reporter for Roll Call, a
newspaper that covers Congress, that Moseley-Braun should apologize
for a battle with him in 1993 in which she defeated Helms' proposal
to grant the United Daughters of the Confederacy a renewed patent
on an emblem featuring the Confederate battle flag. She called the
flag an emblem of slavery.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday Daschle sought to put the nomination battle in a
larger context. He cited the Senate's recent party-line vote
rejecting Ronnie White, a black judge on Missouri's state Supreme
Court, for a federal judgeship, and its three-year stall on taking
up Clinton's nomination of Richard Paez, who is Hispanic, to the
9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   He also mentioned the dispute between Sen. Phil Gramm, R- Texas,
and Clinton over the Community Reinvestment Act, a 1977 law
intended to eradicate discrimination in lending. The dispute has
been stalling legislation to overhaul the nation's financial
system. Gramm has urged changes in the act, calling it burdensome
on small financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Asked by a reporter whether he was saying that Senate
Republicans are racist, Daschle said, ``I'm not calling them
racist.'' But he went on to say ``it raises some ve2y serious
questions about the perception, the attitude of some on the other
side when it comes to minorities.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made similar comments after the Senate's rejection of
the nomination of White, saying the action was ``strong evidence
for those who believe that the Senate treats minority and women
appointees unequally.'' Republicans said White, the first black
judge on Missouri's state Supreme Court, was insufficiently
supportive of the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Czwartacki indicated Wednesday that Lott would not interfere
with Helms. And he noted that the Senate had recently approved
three judges. He asked: ``Are we being asked to go back and catalog
and identify everyone's race, religion or ethnic background? I
mean, there's a term for that. It's called racial profiling. I
thought we were all trying to get away from that.''
</P>
<P>
   Helms on Wednesday referred reporters back to his earlier
statement raising questions about Moseley-Braun's ethics.

computer, has been compared to everything from a Creamsicle to a

 UNDATED: about them.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Food Lion is a supermarket chain with more than 1,400 stores,
mostly in the East, and it has more than $13.5 billion in yearly
revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Food Lion issued a statement through its lawyer, Richard L.
Wyatt Jr., saying: ``We are disappointed that the 4th Circuit did
not affirm the decision in Food Lion's favor in its entirety.
However, the court did recognize that ABC's manipulative illegal
tactics caused unwarranted damage to our company and our
employees.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement continued, ``This is a complex legal area, and our
lawyers will review the court's decision and advise us of our
options.''
</P>
<P>
   The central finding in the appeals court ruling was that ``an
overriding (and settled) First Amendment principle precludes the
award of publication damages in this case.'' The lower court had
overturned the $5.5 million punitive damage award on a narrower
ground.
</P>
<P>
   The district court had also held that under the applicable state
laws in the case, ABC's reporters had defrauded Food Lion by their
actions. This fraud finding, however, was overturned by Wednesday's
appellate ruling.
</P>
<P>
   In a dissent, Judge Paul V. Niemeyer argued that the two ABC
journalists, Lynne Dale and Susan Barnett, ``applied to Food Lion
with the secret intent to obtain sensational and damaging evidence
to publish against Food Lion.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Niemeyer wrote, ``in seeking to `uncover'
practices, the ABC employees baited fellow employees to say and do
things that they knew would undermine Food Lion's standing
food-handling practices.'' He parted with his two colleagues by
saying that such actions gave the jury ``ample evidence'' to
conclude that ABC had committed common-law fraud, on which the
$315,000 damage award was based.
</P>
<P>
   One lawyer who filed briefs on Food Lion's behalf in the case,
but declined to be quoted by name, said Wednesday that the court's
ruling erred in not relying on a different set of legal precedents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Food Lion's claim was that we get damages for the illegally
obtained, even staged videotape, which is a very live issue,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But, as Food Lion's formal statement indicated, the lawyer said
the company needed time to decide if it would pursue this logic in
an appeal, either to the full circuit court, which is based in
Richmond, or to the Supreme Court.

   Expanding its growing domain into the PC market, America Online

percent stake in the maker of consumer computers.

Gateway will offer America Online membership to new PC customers.
</P>
<P>
   Many computer makers already bundle America Online with all
their new machines. But the marriage goes far deeper than those
agreements. As part of the deal, Gateway will move the 600,000
subscribers of its own Internet access service, Gateway.net, to the
America Online network, in effect putting two competing services
onto the same network infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, AOL, already the world's largest Internet service
provider, or ISP, will handle all network operations, billing and
customer service functions, Gateway officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Gateway said it would commit $85 million to market its products
on AOL and would market AOL's products and services in nearly 200
Gateway retail stores.
</P>
<P>
   News of the deal was released as the online service reported net
income of $184 million, or 15 cents a share on a diluted basis. The
results exceeded analysts projections of 13 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
   The company announced its earnings after the close of the
regular trading day which ended with the shares at $118, a rise of
$2.75, on the New York Stock Exchange. In after-hours trading, the
shares fell slightly.
</P>
<P>
   In separate conference calls with reporters, American Online and
Gateway asserted that their deal represented an inevitable
convergence of hardware makers and Internet providers. For example,
they said they planned to use the partnership to pursue development
of and deploy high-speed Internet technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Weitzen, president and Chief Operating Office of Gateway,
said the deal with the world's largest Internet access provider did
not amount to an admission of failure for Gateway.net. He said the
service had added 200,000 subscribers this quarter, equal to the
growth it had last quarter.
</P>
<P>
   He sought to differentiate Gateway's Internet offering, which is
more of a direct pipeline to the Internet, from America Online,
which offers more proprietary content, including chat rooms, news
services and shopping channels.
</P>
<P>
   ``AOL is more of a mass-market pre-packaged service,'' he said.
``Gateway.net is a more personalized service.''
</P>
<P>
   Some industry analysts said the deal had the markings of
throwing in the towel on Gateway.net, despite its seemingly healthy
growth in recent quarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you think about it,'' said Bran C. Oakes, senor Internet
analyst with Lehman Brothers, ``it sounds like Gateway is saying,
`We gave it a good run. Let's do a good deal and get out of the ISP
business,'''
</P>
<P>
   This is the largest investment by AOL in a PC maker, but it is
hardly a unique strategy, and the company has made substantial
investments in other hardware companies. For instance, it invested
$1.5 billion in Hughes Electronics, the General Motors unit that
makes satellite receivers and direct television.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Robert Pittman, the president of American
Online, said the latest deal showed the clear convergence of PC
makers and the Internet industry. ``The big reason people are
buying computers is so they can go online,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   American Online's earnings report underscored the fact that it
knows something about consumers' rush to get online. Continuing its
unmatched growth, the company reported that it added 1.1 million
subscribers worldwide in its first fiscal quarter, which ended
Sept. 30, for a total of more than 18 million. Its subsdiary
Compuserve, has 2.2 million subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   America Online attributed the growth in revenues and profits to
strong performance in several of its brands, _ including the online
service itself, the ICQ chat service and its subsidiary Compuserve
_ and in particular to a continued growth in revenue from
advertising and electronic commerce transactions.
</P>
<P>
   The company said revenue from advertising, e-commerce and other
non-subscription based revenue rose to $350 million, compared with
$175 million in the same quarter a year ago. Its quarterly
subscription revenues rose to $995 million, compared with $723
million for the first fiscal quarter last year.
</P>
<P>
   The growth came amid a period in which there were increasing
competitive pressures on AOL. Growth in low-cost services,
including free ISPs and broadband access, notably cable modem
services.
</P>
<P>
   And there was some concern that AOL would face competition from
itself, in the form of its subsidiary, Compuserve, which it has
marketed aggressively in the last several months.
</P>
<P>
   And there was some concern that AOL would face competition from
itself, in the form of its subsidiary, Compuserve, which it has
marketed aggressively in the last several months.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have said AOL could cannibalize its namesake service by
making Compuserve too attractive. But company officials argued
Wednesday that the growth in both Compuserve and America Online
showed that those fears had not been borne out.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're cannibalizing anything, it's Earthlink and
Mindspring,'' said Oakes, the Lehman Brothers Analyst.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Case, Chairman of AOL, said the earnings augur a bright
future for America Online, which was launched 10 years ago this
month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've made a lot of progress in the decade,'' he said. ``But
most people still aren't connected, so the big opportunity during
the next decade is to make the transition to a connected society.''

 _ SF CHRON  
 State's HMOs Are Facing Legal Fight  &HT;     By Tom Abate 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Two different legal groups are on the verge of filing class-action
lawsuits against HMOs in California, setting up state courts here
to become the latest battleground between lawyers and health
insurers.
<P>
   Prominent San Francisco attorney Fred Furth confirmed that he
will file state and federal class-action suits ``maybe next week''
against unspecified HMOs in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``California hasn't had any of these class actions yet,'' said
attorney Suzanne Ethpison, whose San Diego firm of Casey Gerry Reed
Schenk plans to file its own HMO lawsuits ``very soon.''
</P>
<P>
   The California actions are patterned after suits filed in other
state and federal courts in recent weeks by several legal groups
dominated by law firms that earned huge fees from tobacco
litigation.
</P>
<P>
   Valerie Kockelman, a widow in Palo Alto who has been engaged in
a long struggle to sue her HMO for negligence in her husband's
suicide in 1993, said Furth and Ethpison have both asked her to
become members of their class-action suits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know lawyers get an unconscionable amount of money but I
think they do a real service,'' Kockelman said, adding that she is
angry enough to join a class-action because ``maybe they'll win and
somebody will notice.''
</P>
<P>
   Furth is affiliated with the Scruggs law firm in Mississippi, a
successful tobacco law firm which filed a class-action against
Aetna Inc. earlier this month. Ethpison is part of another group of
ex-tobacco lawyers led by New Orleans attorney Russ Herman.
</P>
<P>
   The current spate of class-action suits that have been filed
against HMOs in other states were made possible by a groundbreaking
U.S. Supreme Court decision in January.
</P>
<P>
   In that decision, the high court held that insurance companies
could be sued for fraud under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations Act, if the evidence showed that they misled policy
holders.
</P>
<P>
   Furth, the San Francisco attorney, said his planned lawsuit is
based on the same legal theory.
</P>
<P>
   However, Harvey Rosenfield, head of Consumers for Quality Care,
a Santa Monica group that supports lawsuits against HMOs,
questioned the timing of the lawsuits because they make it seem as
if Congress does not need to change the law for individuals to sue
their health insurers.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Congress is still debating whether individuals can
recover damages when they sue HMOs. California recently changed
state law to favor such HMO suits, but those changes don't take
effect until 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenfield said the current round of class-action suits against
HMOs would not provide consumers the same protection proposed in
the legislation now before Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover he is afraid the class-action suits will give HMOs
ammunition to claim they are already vulnerable. ``It's too easy to
turn this into a propaganda victory for the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   HMO lobbyist Karen Ignagni, president of the American
Association of Health Plans in Washington, D.C., agrees. ``The
entire debate in Congress has proceeded from the misconception that
health plans couldn't be sued,'' Ignagni said, adding ``members of
Congress are getting a chance to see that the fundamental premise
is wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Robinson Jr., president of the Consumer Attorneys of
California, said that while individuals technically have the right
to sue, that right is extremely limited.
</P>
<P>
   Under current federal law, Robinson noted, an individual can
only sue an HMO for the actual cost of some denied treatment.
Plaintiffs can't collect damages for pain and suffering.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without the possibility of damages, you can't get a lawyer to
take the case on a contingency fee,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson said he favors the recently passed California state law
and the proposed changes in the federal law that would allow
individual plaintiffs to collect damages in lawsuits against HMOs.

IOC'S DRUG PLAN CRITICIZED AT HEARING 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The International Olympic Committee's plan to
create an anti-doping agency to combat athletes' use of
performance-enhancing drugs _ a proposal flayed by foreign
government officials when it was proposed eight months ago in
Lausanne, Switzerland _ received further censure Wednesday at a
Senate hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC offered its plan last winter in the middle of the
growing bribery crisis surrounding the awarding of the 2002 Winter
Olympics to Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal was excoriated for its lack of independence from
IOC control, for advocating a statute of limitations on positive
drug tests and for an unwillingness to save urine samples for as
long as 20 years. ``The IOC is rushing forward to build an
institution that we cannot support _ one that is more public
relations ploy than public policy solution,'' said Barry McCaffrey,
director of the White House Office of Drug Control Policy. The IOC
created its plan, he said, without advice from the United States,
Australia, Britain, Germany or France.
</P>
<P>
   The ideal for an anti-doping agency, McCaffrey said, is one that
can test 365 days a year, without notice; offer no statute of
limitations on cheating; keep samples for at least 10 years and
step up the research needed to test for substances difficult to
detect or easily masked, like anabolic steroids, human growth
hormone and erythropoietin (EPO).
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. Olympic Committee plan to set up an external anti-doping
agency to replace in-house testing was deemed by McCaffrey to be
more independent than the IOC's. ``Some have argued that having the
USOC test its `own' athletes compromises the entire anti-doping
process,'' said William Hybl, the USOC president. ``While the USOC
does not hold completely with this view, we also appreciate the
impact of such a perception must be taken seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   In previous congressional hearings, the IOC has been pummeled by
contentious lawmakers skeptical of the insular Swiss organization's
desire to change with complete accountability and openness. While
the IOC prepares to vote on its changes in December, the Olympics,
and pro and amateur sports organizations struggle with the
pervasive use of performance-enhancing drugs and the inadequacy of
current testing.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC's testing at the Olympic has uncovered relatively few
violations, and its failure to take retroactive action against
athletes for using illegal performance-enhancing drugs has been
persistently scorned.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC's response to the doping crisis ``has been terribly
late, inadequate and inconsequential,'' testified Nancy Hogshead,
the winner of three gold medals and one silver medal in swimming at
the 1984 Summer Games. ``The IOC has wasted decades on this
problem, and now it is time to put doping in the hands of an
independent body of experts.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Pound, an IOC vice president who testified Wednesday,
defended its anti-doping proposal, and said the agency could not be
controlled by IOC members, who would make up 12.5 percent of the
panel. Pound said any agency has to have a statute of limitations.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding the storage of test samples, he said, ``I have a
problem with the legal and physical demands of storing 1.2 million
bottles of urine.''
</P>
<P>
   In his testimony, Frank Shorter, who won the 1972 Olympic
marathon, said, ``With regard to any statute of limitations, it is
intuitively obvious to me, as an athlete, that to be constantly in
fear that even your grandchildren might have to give back your
Olympic medals would be a huge deterrent.''

 Gay Groups Accuse AOL of Prejudice  &HT;     By Tom Stein 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
America Online, the nation's leading Internet service, is censoring
the way gay members describe themselves online while ignoring
gay-bashing remarks from other members, three lobbying
organizations alleged this week.
<P>
   The American Civil Liberties Union, NationalGayLobby.Org and
HateWatch criticized AOL on their Web sites for preventing a gay
member from including sexually suggestive information about himself
in his personal profile, while allowing other members to litter
their profiles with racist comments and hate rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   AOL members typically create profiles to publicly describe
themselves and their interests. An auto enthusiast, for example,
can enter the words ``classic cars'' into the AOL member search
engine and be connected to hundreds of other members with the same
hobby.
</P>
<P>
   But last week, AOL deleted the profile of a gay man because he
described himself as a ``submissive bottom.'' AOL informed the
member that his description violated the company's terms of service
agreement. He was asked to create a new profile free of
``objectionable content'' and ``sexually oriented language.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is essential that (content created by members) reflects our
community standards, and we may remove it if, in our best judgment,
it does not meet those standards,'' according to the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   AOL hosts a handful of gay chat rooms where men can exchange
ideas and even hunt for dates.
</P>
<P>
   The gay man, who felt that he was within his rights, contacted
the Fort Worth, Texas, chapter of free-speech watchdog ACLU, which
now is championing his cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're concerned there is a double standard being applied to
gay members of AOL,'' said Frank Provasek, president of the Fort
Worth ACLU chapter. ``You can't say you're a submissive bottom, but
then there are plenty of examples of nongays who list `killing
fags' as their hobbies.''
</P>
<P>
   A quick, informal investigation conducted last weekend by Wired
Strategies, an Internet consulting firm in Washington, turned up
hundreds of objectionable profiles, including one member who said
he ``liked his beer cold and fags dead,'' and another who listed
his hobby as ``fag bashing.'' AOL has 18 million subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   AOL spokesman Rich D'Amato said the company does not proactively
police member profiles, but instead relies on members to alert it
to objectionable material. He said the company has a ``community
action team'' that investigates all complaints and determines
whether content is offensive and should be removed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Content only comes to our attention if another member reports
it,'' he said. ``Certainly we would view any anti-gay sentiment as
hate speech.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time AOL has been embroiled in controversy
with the gay community. Last year, Navy officer Timothy McVeigh was
outed when an AOL employee turned over McVeigh's member profile to
a Navy investigator. The profile led to discharge proceedings
against McVeigh for being homosexual.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Romanello, executive director of NationalGayLobby.Org in
Washington, said he has heard rumblings in the gay community for
years about profiles for gay AOL subscribers being deleted, while
derogatory remarks about gays and lesbians remain uncensored. He
said his group plans to measure the extent of the problem by asking
gay AOL members to visit his site and fill out an online form
detailing their experiences with the company.
</P>
<P>
   So far, his group has not filed any legal complaints against
AOL.
</P>
<P>
   Critics also point out that while AOL has software that
automatically censors racial slurs, it does nothing to prevent
members from using the defamatory term ``faggot.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people should be free to say whatever they want,''
said Romanello. ``But if AOL has a policy, they should apply it
evenly across the board.''
</P>
<P>
   Will Doherty, director of online community development for the
Gay &AMP; Lesbian Alliance Against Discrimination in San Francisco,
said he does not believe that AOL has an anti-gay bias.
</P>
<P>
   ``(AOL chairman) Steve Case is a friend of the gay and lesbian
community,'' he said. ``But there appears to be some individuals
working on behalf of AOL who at times have been overzealous in
applying the terms of service policy to lesbian and gay users.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Just when the Braves' 1999 postseason story shouldn't
get any better, they get the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   After fighting off the New York Mets, one of the most stubborn
teams in baseball history, the Braves are headed to their first
World Series since 1996. And waiting for them are the Yankees, the
team responsible for the Braves' most brutal postseason experience,
in a decade loaded with them. In the '96 Series, the Yanks came
back from a 2-0 deficit to win the next four.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves have had a hard time shaking those memories.
</P>
<P>
   During the Braves' wild 10-9 win in Game 6 of the National
League Championship Series on Tuesday night, Chipper Jones watched
in agony while the Mets laughed in the face of 5-0 and 7-3 Braves
leads. The Mets did to the Braves what nobody does: They made their
pitching look helpless. And Jones thought of the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Game 4 of the World Series back in 1996,'' Jones said,
referring to the pivotal game, when Jim Leyritz homered off Mark
Wohlers. ``Give our guys a lot of credit. We didn't hang our
heads.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves found new life against the Mets on game-tying RBI
hits by Brian Hunter and Ozzie Guillen. And by the time they scored
in the bottom of the 11th, they might have reminded any Yankees
watching of their own resilience.
</P>
<P>
   Former Yankee Gerald Williams doubled off another former Yankee
Kenny Rogers to lead off the 11th and was bunted to third by Bret
Boone. Intentional walks to Chipper Jones and Brian Jordan, nearly
a Yankee, brought up the one Brave no Yankee could ever forget _
Andruw Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Jones still is baby-faced, but he's a grown man compared with
the 19-year-old rookie who homered twice in his first two World
Series at-bats in 1996. Those hits made him just the second player
to accomplish that feat and also made him the youngest to hit a
home run in a World Series game.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, though, Jones has struggled with a tendency to swing
at breaking balls off the plate. But on Tuesday night, he showed
the utmost in discipline in drawing a bases-loaded walk to win the
game _ and bring the Braves and Yankees together again.
</P>
<P>
   The two teams are different now. The Yankees aren't the
formidable force that won a major-league record 125 games last year
and swept the Padres in a four-game World Series laugher. The
Braves are not the invincible pitching bastion with a loaded
power-hitting lineup. Both are scrappers, which should make this
World Series as intriguing as any.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have the miracles all the other teams were having,
but we just hung in there,'' Yankees owner George Steinbrenner
said.
</P>
<P>
   This World Series will be the first in which the teams played
during the regular season. The Braves won two out of three
interleague games at Yankee Stadium right after the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves did some unusual things to the Yankees in that
series. In their second consecutive win, 10-7 on July 16, the
Braves homered three times off the Yankees' Orlando ``El Duque''
Hernandez. Then, on a night when Greg Maddux was ineffective, the
Braves beat Yankees closer Mariano Rivera on a two-out, three-run
home run by Andruw Jones. Rivera, who allowed four runs that day,
has allowed only one run in the three months since. Jones' homer
was one of only two he allowed this year. The game also was the
last of his four blown saves and the third of his three losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've almost got the same starting rotation that we saw in
the series, and almost the same one as in '96 when we faced them in
the World Series,'' NLCS MVP Eddie Perez said. ``I don't know if
they're pitching different. I think we have to play better than we
did the last four games, that's for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves avoided blowing a 3-0 lead in the NLCS and withstood
the Mets to earn this shot at the Yankees. But the way it happened
might give them reason to feel good about their chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully,'' Chipper Jones said, ``we've got destiny on our
side.''

 MEDIABYTES/DAN FOST  &HT;     Red Hat Plans Net Publication to Cover the Open Source 
 Phenomenon 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
As the open source software Linux gives Microsoft's Windows
operating system its first real challenge, dozens of Web sites have
proliferated that are devoted to the movement.
<P>
   Now Red Hat, the North Carolina company that sells and supports
Linux operating systems, plans to start an online journalistic
venture devoted to authoritative coverage of the open source
phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   Red Hat has hired U.S. News and World Report's technology
correspondent Russ Mitchell, a veteran scribe who has served as a
Business Week bureau chief and managing editor of Wired magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell is editor in chief of the company's Web site at
www.redhat.com and now is starting up a San Francisco Web
publication called Wide Open that will cover the open source
movement, which advocates giving away for free the computer code
for software like Linux.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell and Red Hat say the site _ to debut early next month at
www.wideopen.com _ will be an independent look at all things open
source. If that means writing something flattering about a Red Hat
competitor, or negative about Red Hat, so be it.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell, 45, admits that when Red Hat approached him, he found
the notion hard to believe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was skeptical at first of the idea that a company could or
would journalistically cover an industry that it's a part of,''
Mitchell said.
</P>
<P>
   But when he went to North Carolina to meet with Red Hat chief
executive Bob Young and President Matthew Szulik, he was convinced
that their commitment to open source extended to journalistic
objectivity.
</P>
<P>
   Red Hat's Web site is run out of an office on Folsom Street, and
Mitchell is one of four employees working on Wide Open. That number
could double as the site gets off the ground and starts updating
stories throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
   Although the site will be meant mostly for the information
technology managers who use programs like Linux, Mitchell also
hopes to draw in journalists, venture capitalists, lawyers and
economists. Mitchell plans a mix of features and analysis about
such topics as the legal and economic ramifications of open source.
</P>
<P>
   As with other journalists who have left their old media careers
for a new life on the Web, Mitchell said he wanted to be part of
the phenomenon, as well as to cover it.
</P>

   ``I really think that the future of news is on the Web,''
Mitchell said. ``I've had other opportunities to get involved in
Web operations, but they didn't make sense because I couldn't
continue to do journalism. And this will allow me to maybe buy a

MR. SPACEMAN: Former CNN ``Moneyline'' anchor Lou Dobbs, who left
one of the prime perches of financial journalism to become an
Internet entrepreneur, spoke to several hundred people this week in
San Francisco as part of the Internet Commerce Expo. In his talk on
economics and politics, Dobbs confessed to being a poor
prognosticator who forecast George Bush's resounding re-election as
president and who initially dismissed Ted Turner as a ``millionaire
drunken playboy.''
</P>
<P>
   He then offered his own predictions: The current economic
prosperity ``will continue unabated,'' and George W. Bush will win
election to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   More entertaining, however, were his tales of Turner, the
flamboyant founder of CNN and Dobbs' boss and friend for 19 years.
This year, even though Dobbs left the cable network to seek his
fortune running Space.com, a Web site devoted to space-related news
and entertainment, he still went to Turner's Montana ranch for an
annual fishing trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ted said, `This is kind of funny. You don't work for me any
more,''' Dobbs said. ``I said, `Yes, and I outrank you. I'm
chairman and CEO of Space.com. You're a lousy vice chairman of one
division.'''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, as the head of Time-Warner's CNN division, Turner is
still worth several billion dollars. But he played along. ``He
said, `I'm chairman _ of the Turner Foundation,''' Dobbs said. ``I
said, `Yeah, but that's a nonprofit.'
</P>
<P>
   ``And he said, `So's Space.com.'''
</P>

BIG GAMES: Computec Media will launch two splashy computer game
magazines next week, part of a $20 million effort by the German
company to invade a U.S. market dominated by Ziff-Davis, Imagine
Media and IDG.
</P>
<P>
   Incite Video Games and Incite PC Games, both published in San
Francisco, aim to break the mold of traditional gamer mags by
selling for low prices and by appealing to the casual gamer.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, said Computec CEO Torsten Oppermann, magazines in
this space aim for the hard-core gamers and sell for $5 or more.
Incite Video Games will sell for a mere 99 cents at first, going up
only to $1.99, while the PC pub, which comes with a CD-ROM, starts
at $1.99 and will be hiked to $2.99.
</P>
<P>
   Incite's covers will feature celebrities for a dose of ``real
humans, not computer graphics,'' Oppermann said.
</P>
<P>
   Oppermann hopes to produce magazines that people would be proud
to leave out on their coffee tables.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you read any old gaming magazine, you are characterized as
a nerd,'' Oppermann said. ``You don't need to be embarrassed if you
play games and read our magazine in public.''
</P>
<P>
   The magazines will start with more than 80 pages of advertising
each and will guarantee advertisers a reach of more than 400,000
readers. But with Oppermann claiming that 75,000 retail outlets
already have agreed to carry the magazines, he plans a circulation
that will top 1.3 million copies on each.
</P>
<P>
   Computec, a 10-year-old firm that went public last year in
Frankfurt, has a five-year lease at Eighth and Townsend streets in
San Francisco, where it now employs 75 people.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the magazine business, you have to be in it for the long
term,'' Oppermann said. ``We are here to stay.''

FTC RESTRICTS WEB DEALINGS WITH YOUTHS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With advertisers eyeing the growing multibillion
dollar children's market, the government Wednesday issued new rules
that companies must follow to solicit personal information from
Internet users under 13 years old.
</P>
<P>
   The rules, expected to change the way hundreds of Web sites
operate, were prompted by reports in recent years that companies
were asking children to reveal personal details before allowing
them to participate in on-line contests or games.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, the Federal Trade Commission complained that a
Boston money management firm sought information about family
finances from children and said the data would be retained
anonymously. In fact, the FTC said, the company kept the names and
addresses of the children along with their responses.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses can use personal information to fashion
advertisements that appeal to specific audiences and then, through
the unique medium of the Internet, present the ads to those groups
by e-mail or on Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   While many companies changed some of their most aggressive
practices after regulators intervened, Congress last year issued
new rules for soliciting information from children and asked the
Federal Trade Commission to set specific requirements.
</P>
<P>
   In the rules issued Wednesday, which take effect in April, the
FTC said that companies must ask for parental permission in many
cases before seeking information from children.
</P>
<P>
   When companies plan to make the information public through chat
rooms or other Internet activities, they must seek parental
permission by mail, fax, toll-free phone line or by electronic mail
message in which the parent attaches a digital signature or
password. Companies must also use these methods if they plan to
disclose the personal information to business partners. These
methods are considered more secure than merely asking a parent to
send approval by e-mail, which could be forged by a child.
</P>
<P>
   When companies seek personal information for internal use to
market products and services to children via e-mail, they may ask a
parent to send an e-mail giving consent. The company must send its
own e-mail to the parent, however, to confirm that consent was
given.
</P>
<P>
   Companies are not required to seek parental consent when
collecting limited information for certain Web activities, such as
one-time homework help. And companies may enter a child in a
contest or send an e-mail newsletter as long as the parent receives
notice and can prevent further use of the child's information.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer and business groups were generally enthusiastic about
the rules, though they were cautious about some provisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, we are pleased,'' said Kathryn Montgomery, president
of the Center for Media Education, which had complained to the FTC
about some company practices. She said the government had acted
wisely to post rules early, while on-line marketing is still
developing as a business.
</P>
<P>
   Business groups had lobbied hard against the requirement that
they seek parental consent by phone, fax or mail, which they said
would be costly for Internet start-ups. But most said they were
generally happy with the FTC rules.
</P>
<P>
   The phone or mail requirement ``is going to be a sticking point
for some, but I think that marketers are going to be able to live
with it _ not without some effort,'' said Hal Shoup of the American
Association of Advertising Agencies. ``But nonetheless, given the
complexity of the issues, what has been worked out here is on
balance quite good.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumer groups said they had concerns about a provision that
allows schools to act on behalf of parents in giving consent for
companies to seek personal information from children.
</P>
<P>
   They noted that rules were released on the same day as the
initial public stock offering of ZapMe!, a company that provides
free computers and an online service to schools in return for the
right to post Web ads. Some consumer advocates cautioned that
schools were essentially allowing companies to set up shopping
malls in the classroom through the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The computer can become ``a surveillance device that collects
information and exposes (students) to extremely targeted and
intrusive advertising,'' said Jason Catlett, president of
Junkbusters Corp., which offers products to filter unwanted postal
mail, e-mail and telemarketing calls.
</P>
<P>
   Catlett said that schools that are eager to receive free
computers might not properly guard students' privacy. ``Parents
shouldn't assume that schools are looking out for the privacy
concerns of their children . . . . We don't think the school is
necessarily on the side of your kids,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ZapMe!, based near San Francisco, has been called a computer
equivalent of the Channel One Network, which gives free television
equipment to schools that agree to show a daily 12-minute broadcast
that includes advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   A company spokeswoman said ZapMe! was in a ``quiet period''
because of the stock offering and could not comment on the FTC
rules.
</P>
<P>
   According to information provided by the company, the content it
offers through its on-line service is targeted at students aged
13-19, while the new FTC rules cover Web sites that market to
children under age 13. However, the company also says its free
computers are available for kindergarten through grade 12.
</P>
<P>
   Students can sign up for e-mail accounts and are asked only for
their gender, age and zip code, according to information provided
by the company. But the company's web site does not say whether it
monitors how students use the computers and which Web sites they
favor, and whether it will share that information with other
companies. Computers have been installed in about 230 schools, and
6,000 others have asked to participate.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC said it would review its parental consent rules in 18
months and might make changes to account for new technology.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the parental consent provisions, the FTC said
that Web sites aimed at children must post a ``clear and
prominent'' link to the company's privacy policy on its home page
and at each area where personal information is collected.
</P>
<P>
   Companies are already barred from soliciting more information
than necessary for a child to join an online contest or game. That
provision was included in a 1998 law, called the Children's Online
Privacy Protection Act, which also required the FTC to flesh out
the privacy rules.
</P>
<P>
   In the Boston privacy case, the FTC last May settled a complaint
against Liberty Financial Companies Inc., an asset management
company and operator of the Young Investor site. The company
admitted no wrongdoing and said it did not use or resell any of the
information it collected. It agreed to post a clear privacy policy
and to seek parental consent before soliciting information from
children.
</P>
<P>
   Companies appear to be disclosing more about their privacy
policies. Nearly 66 percent of companies online tell customers how
they use personal information, according to Georgetown University
study. That compares to 14 percent in an FTC study a year earlier.

 _ SF CHRON  
 Checking Out Apple's New iBook  &HT;     By Henry Norr 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
The iBook, Apple's curvy and colorful new notebook computer, has
been compared to everything from a Creamsicle to a toilet seat and
lid. It's also been called a ``people magnet'' and ``almost a
sensuous object of desire.''
<P>
   Most of the buzz has been about the $1,599 machine's design,
which is every bit as distinctive among laptops as the iMac was on
the desktop _ and even more controversial because some complain
that it looks like a ``girly computer.''
</P>
<P>
   But on the theory that you can't judge an iBook by its cover,
I'll steer clear of such debates. Instead, I'll focus on what the
iBook is and isn't good for, based on my experience using it daily
for the past few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In general, with one important qualification and a few
additional cautions, I think it's a terrific computer for the
purposes for which it mainly was designed. Just make sure your
needs match its talents and pay attention to the caveats, or you'll
be sorry.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of the components that differentiate great laptops from
also-rans _ the screen, the keyboard and the battery _ the iBook is
a clear winner:
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; The screen.  &LR; It measures 12.1 inches diagonally, which is
relatively modest compared with many competitors. But it displays
an ample 800 by 600 pixels, and it's as bright and crisp as they
come; to my eye, it's better than most desktop monitors.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; _The keyboard.  &LR; It's made of white plastic and is pleasant to work
at. The main keys are full-size, and the wrist rests are generous
and comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; _The battery &LR; . According to Apple, it can keep the device working
for ``up to six hours.'' That's more than twice the industry norm.
In real life, your mileage will vary depending on how you use the
machine, but in my testing, I frequently got more than five hours
per charge.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason the battery lasts so long is that the machine
goes into power-saving mode whenever it's been idling for ``a
substantial period of time (a half second or so),'' as the
technical documentation for the machine puts it.
</P>
<P>
   It also automatically goes into a deep and silent sleep whenever
you close its clamshell case. In that state, it draws fewer than 7
watts of power, compared with 5 watts when it's completely shut
down but still plugged in.
</P>
<P>
   Unless you're worried about that 2-watt differential, that means
you never have to shut down at all. The big advantage: When you
lift the lid again, you're right back where you left off in about
15 seconds, without having to wait for the minute or two it takes
to boot up from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   As exceptional as the iBook is with these sensitive components,
it's anything but outstanding with respect to some more mundane
ones.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, the hard disk has a capacity of only 3.2
gigabytes. Today's software eats gigabytes for breakfast, and 3.2
of them won't last long _ especially if you get into collecting MP3
digital-audio cuts or QuickTime movies.
</P>
<P>
   A worse problem is that the iBook comes with only 32 megabytes
of RAM. That may sound like a lot, but Apple's operating system
grabs most of it _ about 28 megabytes _ before you even have a
chance to launch a program. With so little memory free, the iBook
has to depend on ``virtual memory'' _ a technique that fools the
system into using some hard disk space as if it were RAM. Apple
configures it to give the machine an effective memory of 64
megabytes, but you pay a severe performance penalty because drives,
even fast ones, are always much slower than real RAM. When I first
hooked the iBook up to the Internet, I was struck immediately by
how sluggish it felt downloading even routine pages.
</P>
<P>
   To check my impression, I fired up my Windows 95 laptop, a
2-year-old Fujitsu model with a lowly 150-megahertz Pentium chip
but 48 megabytes of memory. Stopwatch in hand, I timed how long it
took Internet Explorer on each machine to connect to 15
representative Web sites, including Apple's own home page, online
store and QuickTime site.
</P>
<P>
   Results: The Fujitsu took a total of 81.1 seconds, or an average
of 5.4 seconds per site, while the iBook needed 190.6 seconds in
all, or 12.7 on average.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, even though Apple calls the iBook ``the
second-fastest notebook in the world'' (after the PowerBook G3,
naturally) and says it was designed specifically for Internet
access, my ancient PC laptop ran rings around it on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   After totaling up those results, I appealed to Apple to lend me
some extra memory for testing. They sent up another 32 megabytes,
which I installed myself with only a minimum of grief. Then I redid
my tests, without in any other way reconfiguring the system. This
time, the iBook needed only 75.1 seconds in all to download the
same 15 pages, or an average of just 5 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   The moral of the story is clear: With only 32 megabytes of RAM _
the only configuration Apple offers _ the iBook is a crippled
computer.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the company should make 64 megabytes standard, as it
did in its revamped iMac models. Because the company chose not to
do so _ ``We had a price point to hit,'' a senior executive
explained _ you'll have to do it yourself, or get your dealer to do
it or keep living with the World Wide Wait.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the ever-volatile price of RAM has risen sharply
of late. An extra 32 megabytes today likely will cost you between
$130 and $200 extra; an extra 64 megabytes, which I'd recommend,
will set you back $200 to $300.
</P>
<P>
   Before you plunk down the cash, though, consider some of the
iBook's other limitations:
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; _Size and weight.  &LR; The iBook is pretty big and pretty heavy to
carry around. Not that it's much different from most comparably
priced Windows notebooks marketed to consumers _ IBM's latest
consumer ThinkPads are a shade smaller but weigh even more (7.7 to
7.8 pounds).
</P>
<P>
   Still, as I can attest from carrying the iBook back and forth
between home and The Chronicle for the past few weeks _ by foot and
by BART _ 6.6 pounds, on top of my usual load, is a lot to haul
around.
</P>
<P>
   As for air travel, even if I were willing to cart it through the
airport, I don't think one could even open it on an airline tray,
at least not in coach class. Apple's marketing materials say the
machine ``was born to travel,'' but they must mean by car.
</P>
<P>
   Another note about the size issue: Apple made the machine's
footprint on the desktop even larger than necessary by putting all
of its ports and the power connector on the sides rather than in
back, apparently to leave the rear clear for the handle.
Personally, I'd much rather have the cables out of sight behind the
screen, rather than dangling from both sides like an unruly mane.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; _Limited expandability.  &LR; In the name of simplifying and modernizing
the Mac architecture, Apple has eliminated the serial,
keyboard-and-mouse and SCSI ports that were standard on its old
models.
</P>
<P>
   They even omitted a microphone jack, spoiling my plan to try out
video-conferencing with my iMac-equipped daughter in college, and a
video-out port for connecting to a larger display or projection
system _ a significant deficiency, I should think, in one of its
target markets, K-12 classrooms. And unlike almost every other
notebook today, the iBook lacks a slot for plugging in the
credit-card-size add-ons known as PC Cards.
</P>
<P>
   In fairness, it's true, as Apple argues, that most PC Card slots
are used for modems or network adapters, and the iBook has both a
56K modem and a fast Ethernet connector built in. But those who
might like to add something else are out of luck.
</P>
<P>
   Unless, that is, you can find the features you'd like to add in
the form of an external device you can connect to the iBook's
Universal Serial Bus port. Recent months have brought a rising tide
of USB products, including printers, scanners, video-capture
devices, Zip drives, CD-ROM burners, pocket-size MP3 music players
and lots more. Many of these products work on Macs as well as PCs.
</P>
<P>
   USB was designed to handle up to 127 devices simultaneously, but
you need ports to plug them into. Unfortunately, Apple cut another
corner by giving the iBook only one port. If you use it for your
printer (or for an adapter connected to an older printer) and then
you decide to add, say, a Zip or floppy drive, which Apple doesn't
offer even as an optional extra, you'll have to purchase a USB hub
with extra ports.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that these hubs aren't expensive _ they start
at $35 or so _ and they couldn't be easier to set up. But
considering that Apple, by removing all other expansion connectors,
put so much weight on USB, it could at least have provided a pair
of these ports.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the ledger, the iBook has one other
important feature I haven't mentioned yet: support for wireless
networking. Sometime during the next few weeks, Apple will begin
selling its $99 AirPort card. Plug it into a special slot inside
the machine and you should be able to communicate at 11 megabits
per second _ faster, if only slightly, than the typical office
network _ over a distance of up to 150 feet without a wire
connection.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you'll need a similarly equipped device to
communicate with. Apple will sell an AirPort ``base station'' _ a
flying-saucer-shaped device equipped with its own modem and network
connector so that it can serve as a link to the Internet for up to
10 client machines with AirPort cards _ for $299.
</P>
<P>
   But the company also is building AirPort slots into all its
latest models, and any Mac that has both an AirPort card and a
modem or network connection, even another iBook, can function as a
base station for just the cost of the $99 card.
</P>
<P>
   The AirPort products aren't available yet, so I wasn't able to
test them. But if they perform as advertised, they'll give the
iBook a significant advantage over any other current laptop.
</P>
<P>
   With or without AirPort, the iBook is a great choice for many
settings _ for use in a dorm room or small apartment or in a
classroom, or for anyone who just enjoys surfing the Web in an easy
chair or catching up on work out on the deck.
</P>
<P>
   Just be sure its weight and its limited expandability won't
interfere with your plans for it.
</P>
<P>
   And don't forget to budget for that extra memory.

BOEING IN A DEAL TO DEVELOP MISSILES FOR EUROPEAN WARPLANES
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By ALAN COWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The Boeing Co. said Wednesday that it would join French
and British manufacturers to develop a sophisticated air-to-air
missile, opening a head-on competition with the Raytheon Co. to
supply at least $1.65 billion worth of missiles for a new
generation of European warplanes
</P>
<P>
   Coinciding with the separate introduction Wednesday of a joint
missile company grouping the top military contractors in Britain,
France and Italy, the Boeing deal with British Aerospace PLC and
Aerospatiale Matra SA showed the dizzying pace of efforts to
streamline the military business as the arms market shrinks after
the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   The two deals were a further illustration of the crosscurrents
within the trans-Atlantic military industry as European companies
slowly coalesce.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Aerospatiale Matra announced a merger with
DaimlerChrysler AG of Germany that would make it the world's
third-largest aerospace and military company after Boeing and
Lockheed Martin.
</P>
<P>
   In the missile businesses announced Wednesday, Aerospatiale
ended up as a partner of both Boeing and British Aerospace in the
development of the Meteor air-to-air missile for the Eurofighter _
a long-running venture between Britain, Germany, Italy and Spain to
build the Continent's own warplane. The British government has
ordered 232 of the 620 Eurofighters to be supplied to the countries
making the airplane.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon, currently the world's third-largest military and
aerospace company and the dominant global missile maker, won U.S.
government endorsement last month for a bid to sell its own Amraam
missiles to Britain for its Eurofighters. While the contract for
missiles supplied to Britain is valued at $1.65 billion, the figure
could be much higher if other European air forces follow Britain's
lead in choosing air-to-air missiles. Alan Garwood, deputy chief
executive of Matra BAE Dynamics _ a joint missile venture owned by
Aerospatiale Matra and British Aerospace _ said the total value of
sales could reach $10 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoever gets this, you are talking about lots and lots of
missiles,'' said Andrew Brooks, a military analyst with the
International Institute for Strategic Studies in London. ``It's big
bucks.''
</P>
<P>
   European countries are desperately seeking to build their own
military identity to offset what they see as an embarrassing
dependence on far more advanced American military technology _
illustrated most recently in the high-technology air war over
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's involvement in Europe's Meteor project thus ``muddies
the waters,'' Brooks said, `'and for that reason, Meteor will be
presented as a European solution.'' Garwood said the Meteor project
``is an opportunity to take Raytheon on its own back yard and score
a win for Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Schlueter, a spokesman for Boeing's military operations,
said the company would provide expertise in low-cost manufacturing
and in integrating the systems linking the Meteor missile to the
Eurofighter. But it is not expected to take an equity stake in the
venture.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, British Aerospace and Aerospatiale Matra announced a
link-up Wednesday with Finmeccanica of Italy intended to pool their
missile businesses, creating the world's second-largest missile
operation after Raytheon. ``This move is a natural development in
the consolidation of the European aerospace and defense industry,''
the three companies said.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement added a further strand to the web of deals
linking European military and aerospace. Just this week,
Aerospatiale Matra and Marconi Electronics said that they planned
to form Europe's biggest space venture with DaimlerChrysler's
aerospace unit.

LAKERS ADD GUARD DEPTH, SIGN SHAW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Brian Shaw's offseason has been dizzying to say
the least. And to make matters dizzier, now he has to learn the
triangle offense. He welcomes the vertigo.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw became the latest beneficiary of Kobe Bryant's hand injury
when the Los Angeles Lakers signed him to a one-year, partially
guaranteed deal Wednesday. If he makes the team, Shaw is eligible
to earn $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't figure to get this opportunity. The Lakers had scouted
Shaw in pickup games at UCLA last month but eventually signed Ron
Harper to add veteran depth to the backcourt. The door reopened for
Shaw when Bryant broke his right hand last week. Harper had to move
to Bryant's off-guard slot, leaving a gap behind Derek Fisher at
point guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a big guard (6-foot-6) that has experience in this
league,'' coach Phil Jackson said of Shaw, 33. ``We think maybe he
can add something.''
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear if Shaw is just a temporary acquisition or a
longer-term role player. His signing increases the roster to 18
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how anybody's going to fit in until they come in
and play in this game,'' Jackson said. ``This is an opportunity for
us to get a player that has what we consider a valuable asset to
us, which is that he can play a big guard, he can originate an
offense, he reads defenses pretty well and he's got some speed.''
</P>
<P>
   If Shaw picks up the offense quickly, he could stick even after
Bryant returns. That would be a welcome bit of stability for the
10-year veteran. After playing for Portland last season, Shaw was
dealt to Houston as part of the package for Scottie Pippen. The
Rockets, stocked with guards, waived him the next day. That was
fine with Shaw, who wants to be closer to his 5-month-old son in
Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to go too far away. This is a perfect
situation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw played just one game for the Blazers last season. His
career averages are 8.2 points, 3.7 rebounds and 5.0 assists.
</P>
<P>
   __ Game on: The Lakers' light exhibition-game schedule just got
heavy. They will play the Miami Heat on Sunday at 1 p.m. in
Bakersfield, replacing the canceled Oct. 12 game in Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   That makes five games in six days, a pace reminiscent of last
season's post-lockout schedule. After playing tonight and Friday in
the Lakers Shootout at the Forum, the Lakers will have Saturday
off, then play three in a row _ at Bakersfield, Albuquerque and Las
Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're glad about the game,'' Jackson said. ``Three in a row,
we're not so glad about.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Hot seat: Jackson didn't name names, but he was clearly
disappointed with the play of his second unit in Tuesday's victory
over Golden State. The reserves lost an early lead and generally
struggled.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got some guys out there in the second unit that just
aren't giving us anything out there on the floor,'' Jackson said.
``They're veterans, they're just not playing well and it's just
unfortunate. They're teamed up with some kids that are looking for
some leadership; we're just not getting leadership in our second
unit.''
</P>
<P>
   The remarks seemed to be aimed at reserve forwards Rick Fox and
Robert Horry. Fox finished with three points and three turnovers in
17 minutes. Horry had two points, five rebounds and a pair of
turnovers in 18 minutes, going 1 for 5 from the field.

ADVERTISING: DEVELOPER PROMOTES ITS MALLS AS DESTINATIONS FOR FUN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich., Va., Texas, N.C., Fla.)   (bl)  
 By PATRICIA WINTERS LAURO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The commercial depicts a suburban dad greasing a pig, then
setting him free in the living room for a fun, family chase.
</P>
<P>
   An ad for hog farming, perhaps? A spot for a new game?
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the commercial, which is being broadcast this week in
the Houston area, advertises the grand opening of Mills Corp.'s
Katy Mills, a new kind of mall that mixes off-price retailing with
a heavy dose of interactive entertainment. The message is that Katy
Mills offers an exciting outing _ without the extreme of
pig-chasing.
</P>
<P>
   Call it ``shopper-tainment.'' But in a retail environment filled
with growing competition for shoppers from mail-order houses, home
shopping and e-commerce, real estate companies have been adding
entertainment-type businesses as featured attractions in the
nation's 1,800 enclosed malls.
</P>
<P>
   Mills, a real estate investment trust based in Arlington, Va.,
is credited with expanding the entertainment concept at malls,
creating something more like tourist destinations by blending
off-price shopping with high-technology amusements from arcades,
theme restaurants, interactive retailers and vast 24-to-30-screen
multiplex theatres.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the company is trying to explain the concept in two
30-second television spots from its agency, the Southfield, Mich.,
office of Doner that barely mentions shopping at all. Instead, it
promotes its newest malls as simply places to have fun.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign theme is also intended to give the 10 Mills malls
around the country a single, national brand image. All 10 Mills
malls will use the same ``total experience'' theme, though the
individual executions will differ. Combined, Mills' total budget
for the campaigned is about $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   Mills began adding many entertainment features to its malls in
1996, but this is the first time its campaign focuses strictly on
the Mills ``experience.'' Because the campaign is such a departure
from typical mall advertising, Mills tested the ads before the
introduction in Houston, and also ran tests in Charlotte, N.C.,
where they ran in September to open the Concord Mills mall there.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Lipscomb, group marketing vice president for Mills, said
the research found consumers by and large understood the message
that the malls offered a different shopping experience _ aside from
a few exceptions where viewers were left scratching their heads.
</P>
<P>
   The wacky spots were even preferred over the old Mills campaign
that was humorous but with a more traditional shopping message, Ms.
Lipscomb said. ``Where consumers' heads are, I think, is that
people feel rushed, and they just want to have fun, to go and do
and not take life too seriously,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The company's second TV spot features friends wrapping
bubble-wrap around a Diane Keaton look-alike and then rolling her
down a hill through a sprinkler. Shopping isn't even mentioned
until the tagline, which is ``shop together, play together, eat
together.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That was very deliberate,'' said John Parlota, executive vice
president at Doner. ``The idea is to give a sense of intrigue that
this is a new type of experience. This does not look like other
mall advertising.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides evoking an experience, the ads are also intended to
``brand'' Mills properties. Other mall companies also branding
their properties with image campaigns include the Simon Property
Group _ the nation's largest owner-operator of malls _ and
Westfield Shopping Centers.
</P>
<P>
   Branding builds an image not only for consumers, but also for
Wall Street as many mall owners and developers have become public
companies, said Malachy Kavanagh, spokesman for the International
Council of Shopping Centers in New York. ``Malls that use branding
are attempting to build an identity,'' he said. ``It's no different
than, say, what the Gap does or other retail brands.''
</P>
<P>
   Establishing a unified national image may also help attract
marketing partners that are not traditional mall advertisers, like
big national name brands, Malachy said. Over the years, malls have
marketed themselves by selling brand signage, merchandising and
sponsorship opportunities. Simon Brand Ventures, for instance,
offers mall marketing programs and includes clients like Visa, AT&AMP;T
and Pepsi-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   Besides 200-plus stores and an average of 1.5 million
square-feet of space, Mills shopping malls typically feature theme
restaurants like Rain Forest Cafe, which features food in a faux
jungle with mechanical butterflies; ``interactive'' retailers like
Bass Pro Shops Outdoor World where the shopper can try out all
manner of sports equipment before buying; and virtual-reality game
centers/restaurants like Dave &AMP; Busters that offer huge arcades and
games like simulated skiing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't a large mall today that isn't incorporating some
elements of entertainment,'' Malachy said, ``but Mills has perhaps
taken it to a higher level _ everything in their center is geared
to entertainment.''
</P>
<P>
   With entertainment such a large part of its experience, Ms.
Lipscomb said that the company's campaign relates more to tourism
than to traditional mall advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Mills centers draw from a broader geographical reach than the
typical mall, and often get tourists, she said. Some 40 percent of
the visitors to its Sawgrass Mills mall in Florida are tourists,
many of them from outside the United States. Indeed, Mills compares
its total number of visitors not to that of other malls, but to
other entertainment outlets like Disney amusement parks and Major
League Baseball attendance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a brand,'' Ms. Lipscomb said. ``The reason why people
shop regional malls? We're not those reasons. Their product
attributes are different from ours _ and for us, fun is way up
there on our product-attribute list.''

SHARPTON IS UNLIKELY ALLY OF KLAN IN SUIT AGAINST CITY ON RALLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Amsterdam News, the largest black newspaper in
New York City, and the Rev. Al Sharpton said Wednesday that they
had each filed legal papers supporting the right of a Ku Klux Klan
group to demonstrate Saturday in lower Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper's publisher and Sharpton said they despised the
Klan's message, but also believed that Mayor Rudolph Giuliani was
wrong to block the group from holding the rally, which is expected
to draw several dozen Klan members and hundreds of Klan opponents.
</P>
<P>
   The court filings come on the eve of a hearing set for Thursday
in U.S. District Court in Manhattan where two judges will consider
claims by the Klan and a group of opponents who will contend that
the Giuliani administration violated the Klan's First Amendment
rights by denying permission for the demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, a lawyer for the city, Daniel Connolly, said of
the new filings in support of the Klan's First Amendment position:
``This is a case about balancing individuals' First Amendment
rights with the city's ability to maintain public order and protect
the rights of every citizen to freely and safely express
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Elinor Tatum, publisher and editor in chief of the Amsterdam
News, said her paper ``has stood up for the First Amendment rights
of several organizations,'' adding that ``if we did not stand up
for the Klan's right, we had no right to stand up for anybody
else's rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton's brief was filed in the name of the National Action
Network, a nonprofit group of which he is president. ``I feel
strongly that the Klan is a terrorist group,'' Sharpton said
Wednesday. ``But I feel just as strongly that the mayor should not
be allowed to use this group to suspend the constitutional rights
of others.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
ATLANTA _ This is the way baseball should end the 1900s _ with its
franchise of the ages battling its franchise of the decade for the
World Series championship.
<TEXT>
<P>
   To some, that would suggest the New York Yankees and the Atlanta
Braves will meet in the Fall Classic; to others, it means the
Yankees are battling themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves hold the distinction of being the Team of the '90s
based on their eight consecutive playoff appearances, five National
League pennants and 1995 World Series championship.
</P>
<P>
   While those are certainly strong credentials, some might argue
the Yankees have a greater stake to the claim because they have won
the World Series twice this decade, a feat matched only by the
Toronto Blue Jays _ the last team to win back-to-back World Series
titles.
</P>
<P>
   Considering how the Blue Jays have struggled since their
early-'90s success, the Braves and Yankees clearly are at the top
of the heap. But which is the team of the decade?
</P>
<P>
   That's a matter to be settled over the next several days,
beginning Saturday when the Braves host the Yankees in Game 1 of
the World Series. Game 2 also is in Atlanta, and the next three
games are scheduled for Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Neither team has revealed its pitching rotation.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees reached the World Series by disposing of the Boston
Red Sox in five games in the American League Championship Series.
The Braves needed six games to rid themselves of the pesky Mets in
the NLCS, setting up a rematch of the 1996 World Series, which the
Yankees won in six games.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, determining the Team of the '90s depends on the
criteria. The Braves' .595 winning percentage is tops in the majors
during the decade, while the Yankees check in at .548, good for
second place.
</P>
<P>
   How much would that really matter if the Yankees beat the Braves
in the World Series again, claiming a third title in the '90s?
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope we win another World Series,'' said Braves general
manager John Schuerholz, who doesn't believe the issue should be
open to debate. ``At least that would put an end to that question.
We don't need to do anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've won more games (in the '90s) than any team; we've won
100 games three years in a row; we've won eight straight division
titles. If you choose any criteria except for one narrow criterion
_ World Series championships _ we lead it.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a good argument _ but one the Yankees aren't buying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone talks about pitching and how the Braves are this and
that, but if we win the whole thing, we are the Team of the '90s,
no doubt about it,'' Yankees reliever Jeff Nelson said. ``They've
been in the playoffs every year since 1991 but won it all only
once. We would have three in four years.''
</P>
<P>
   Which, of course, would be impossible to simply discard in this
team-of-the-decade debate, no matter what Schuerholz says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would think we have a pretty good shot,'' Yankees pitcher
Andy Pettitte said. ``We have a pretty good thing going right now.
We've been in the playoffs five straight years. But we have to win
it first.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees should be favored to beat the Braves in the World
Series. But if they don't, Atlanta likely would be recognized as
the Team of the '90s, having matched the Yankees in World Series
championships with more pennants and a superior won-lost record in
regular-season play.
</P>
<P>
   Those who claim interleague play removes some of the intrigue
from the World Series will no doubt note this is the first matchup
of World Series teams that played during the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves took two of three games at Yankee Stadium, but that
hardly avenged their 1996 World Series defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Winning the World Series would do the trick, while no doubt
ending the debate regarding the team of the decade.

BRAVES AND AN OLD FRIEND  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
(Eds: subs to correct reference to Turner Field in 6th graf to
Fulton County Stadium) SPORTS COLUMN: YANKEES PREPARE TO FACE By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   They rode buses together for long, hot summers in the minor
leagues, and rose to the majors to spend more than a few nights
chilling out on the bench. They would engage in the chatter of
chances, wondering when their respective turns might come.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Leyritz was brash, eager to inflate his worth, the
occasional irritant to established players. Gerald Williams was
reflective, easygoing, best friend to a born star, Derek Jeter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy had five tools,'' Leyritz said, giving Williams the
ultimate baseball scout's honor. ``I would've had to have been the
first to tell you it would've been Gerald who got a chance, with
the talent he had.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Williams, an outfielder with speed and a quick
bat, he didn't have the ability to retire a left-handed hitter late
in a game. In August 1996, the Yankees had one crying need as they
coasted toward their first post-season under their new manager, Joe
Torre.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt we had built this $60 million house with a hole in the
roof,'' said Brian Cashman, the general manager who, at the time,
was assistant to Bob Watson.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Williams, after nine patient years in the Yankee
organization, was deemed expendable. He went to Milwaukee as part
of what would become a very good deal for the lanky southpaw Graeme
Lloyd. Hole repaired, the Yankees went to the World Series.
Eventually, Leyritz went to the plate in Game 4 against the Atlanta
closer Mark Wohlers, who was in to protect a 6-3 Braves lead in the
eighth inning, two men on, at Fulton County Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Wohlers, with heat often too nasty to hit, threw Leyritz a
slider without enough snap. Leyritz sent it over the left-field
fence and turned around a World Series that the Braves had appeared
certain to win.
</P>
<P>
   Fate and fortune are funny that way. While Williams and his
tools were gone from the Yankees, the headstrong Leyritz had struck
a blow that made him, as he said Wednesday while contemplating
another World Series against the Braves, ``a Yankee forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Like all good Yankees and half the city, Leyritz was up past
midnight Tuesday, into Wednesday morning. Starring in their roles
of dead men slugging, the Mets were making a gallant last stand,
the brave against the Braves. But in the bottom half of the 11th
inning, here came Gerald Williams to lead off against Kenny Rogers,
star-crossed man on his nightmare mound.
</P>
<P>
   It was Rogers, remember, who had started for the Yankees,
pitched them into a hole, on the night Leyritz rode to the rescue.
Now Bobby Valentine had handed him the ball, and every Met fan and
maybe most Yankee fans saw sudden death for the Subway Series.
</P>
<P>
   Leyritz said he had been rooting for the Mets, but a return to
the scene of personal glory was all right with him. The truth was,
he also couldn't help but pull for Gerald Williams, the unlucky
soul who had been hauled off baseball's equivalent of the space
shuttle a month before launch, and ordered aground to a team with
no wings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard not to root for guys you came up with,'' Leyritz
said. ``Especially a guy like him.''
</P>
<P>
   When Leyritz was in San Diego last season, the Padres had one of
those bench-clearing tangos with Atlanta, where Williams had
happily gone in an off-season trade. The two former Yankees found
each other, held on, not quite like Jeter and Alex Rodriguez, just
two journeymen who had done their bench and bus time together.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, this season, Williams stepped into a floodlight of
opportunity. He had 422 at-bats. He played left field, often led
off, hit 17 home runs, drove in 68 runs and became another example
of the Atlanta organization's stubborn resourcefulness in a season
supposedly lost to crippling injury and illness. In the Braves'
neediest hour, the 11th inning of Game 6, Williams lined a double
off Rogers into the left-field corner. He soon crossed the plate as
the series-winning run. He stepped into a celebration that would
carry him, finally, to a Braves-Yankees World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to make sure I didn't take wings,'' he said, when
someone asked what he was thinking as he came down the third-base
line following ball four to Andruw Jones. By this he meant that, if
anything, experience had taught him to stay grounded _ the advice
he shares with nephews and nieces.
</P>
<P>
   That is what Williams told Leyritz he would do long after he was
traded by the Yankees, after he missed out on those ultimate games.
He told Leyritz he would stay calm, and things would work out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good to play against old friends,'' Williams said after
they had.
</P>
<P>
   Leyritz _ to date off the Yankees' post-season roster after his
midsummer return to New York _ can only assume that Torre wants his
bat for late-inning at-bats against the tough lefties in the
Braves' bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, when opportunity was with him, Leyritz became a
World Series hero. Maybe you believe in fate. Maybe you don't. Some
good advice for Mariano Rivera, though: stay grounded, and watch
those sliders when Gerald Williams comes up.

WHEN OPPORTUNITY KNOCKED, MANY MISSED IT
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bobby Valentine, master of all managerial minds, had one ploy
left in his duffel bag of tricks. It was the 11th inning of Game 6
of the playoff series with Atlanta and the Braves had runners at
first and third with one out. As Brian Jordan took his bat to the
plate, the Mets' manager went to the mound.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bobby came out,'' related Todd Pratt, who was catching, ``and
said we're going to walk him, but let's try to bait him into a
squeeze or maybe Chipper would run to second and I'd throw him out.
Pretty good idea, but it didn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Cox, the Atlanta manager, did not take the bait. Playing
the situation conservatively, confident there was a run lurking in
that inning, he called for neither squeeze nor steal. Kenny Rogers
pitched out on his first two pitches to Jordan, and no one moved.
The next two pitches were balls intentionally and loaded the bases.
The four balls Rogers subsequently threw to Andruw Jones were not
intentional.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers, a veteran at pitching poorly in post-season games, thus
joined Kevin McGlinchy, a Braves rookie, in incurring the onus of
being the losing pitcher in one of the last two games of one of the
most scintillating post-season series ever played. If their
teammates had done their jobs, though, Rogers and McGlinchy would
never have been put in position to fail. And failure comes often to
pitchers who work in extra innings. Someone has to lose.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that other players on both teams failed to do their
jobs highlighted the missed opportunities that abounded in the
series. McGlinchy was the losing pitcher in Game 5, but before he
even got into the game, his teammates had left 17 runners on base.
Rogers will be remembered as the man who walked in the run that
decided the 1999 National League Championship Series, but what
about the opportunities John Franco and Armando Benitez had to shut
down the Braves and protect one-run leads?
</P>
<P>
   Franco, pitching in the first post-season of his 16-year career,
gave up the game-tying run in the eighth inning. Benitez, who had
supplanted Franco as the closer, surrendered the game-tying run in
the 10th, setting the stage for Rogers to fail.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the Mets had run out of comebacks in what had been a
remarkable three-week sprint, Darryl Hamilton said, ``I just think
we ran out of gas. We had a lot of guys playing hurt. Armando
Benitez's knee has been bothering him the last month and a half. He
still went out there and gave us everything he had. He didn't have
much the last week, but he didn't care. He went out there and
pitched. The same with Kenny Rogers. The guy's been tired, very
tired. He's been getting up every other inning, it seems, and he
went out there and gave us everything he had.''
</P>
<P>
   Al Leiter, starting on three days' rest for the first time when
it meant something, did likewise, but he discovered too late he had
nothing to give in Game 6. ``The break on his ball was so big,''
Don Baylor said, ``that he had to sacrifice stuff to try to get it
over. That comes from three days' rest.'' The Braves hitting coach
explained that the plan was for the hitters to take as many pitches
as possible, wearing Leiter down. But Leiter self-destructed in six
batters and 25 pitches, washing away all of the brilliant
performances he had provided in previous weeks.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the series, most of the pitchers were exhausted.
Valentine used 17 pitchers in the last two games, Cox 12. ``The
series was so intense pitchers were used over and over and over,''
Baylor said. ``That's what it came down to.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves' starting pitchers, however, once again shined. In
lasting only five and one-third innings and giving up three runs in
Game 6, Kevin Millwood was the only starter who didn't pitch at
least seven innings and gave up more than two earned runs. ``It
ended up being our pitchers vs. their good-hitting lineup,'' Baylor
said. ``They have a bunch of good hitters on that club.''
</P>
<P>
   But the good hitters didn't hit enough. Robin Ventura had three
hits, including his memorable grand-slam single, in 25 at-bats;
Mike Piazza, four in 24. Edgardo Alfonzo started the series well
with four hits in eight at-bats in the first two games, which the
Mets lost in spite of his hitting. But then Valentine flip-flopped
Alfonzo and John Olerud in the batting order in an attempt to
generate better hitting, and Alfonzo stopped hitting. He did not
get a hit and struck out seven times in his next 10 at-bats, and he
had only two hits in his last 19 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets' leading hitter in the series was their least known
player, Melvin Mora. The 27-year-old rookie batted .429, his six
hits including a second-game home run and a sixth-game single that
gave the Mets an 8-7 lead. Mora also was the impetus for and part
of the double steal that led to the victory in Game 4, the one that
nearly turned the series around.
</P>
<P>
   But even more impressive was Mora's right arm. The Venezuelan
had offered a glimpse of what he could do when, playing left field,
he threw out Jay Bell at the plate in the eighth inning of what
turned out to be the last game of the division series against
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Playing center field in Game 3 against Atlanta, he threw out
Bret Boone at home in the first inning. In Game 5, as a right
fielder, he initiated the relay that caught Keith Lockhart at the
plate in the 13th before he could score what could have been the
winning run. In Game 6, he executed a dandy play in the 10th
inning, realizing he couldn't get Andruw Jones at home on Ozzie
Guillen's single to right and throwing instead to third, where he
nailed Ryan Klesko.
</P>
<P>
   Mets fans can't wait to see more of Mora.

 &HT;    Flooding tests historic N.C. town's hearts, history
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRINCEVILLE, N.C. _ The Tar River rose again, cresting Wednesday
for the fourth time in two months in this abandoned, flood-socked
town founded by former slaves. But Murray Morning plans to come
back.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my home,'' the 49-year-old man said, sitting on the
brick steps that had led to his double-wide mobile home, destroyed
by Hurricane Floyd's historic flood waters a month ago. ``I plan to
rebuild.''
</P>
<P>
   But across town, past the leaning houses with blown-out windows
and past the stinking piles of shoes, mattresses and spoiled food,
Isaiah Dickens, 55, is leaving Princeville for good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to come back,'' he said, loading his black pickup
truck with a big-screen TV and other household items he hopes will
dry out and, somehow, work again.
</P>
<P>
   Princeville is among dozens of eastern North Carolina
communities deluged by three hurricanes _ Dennis, Floyd and Irene _
the past two months. The state's most costly natural disaster,
Floyd flooded an estimated 60,000 buildings. Among those, 6,500
were destroyed and another 9,000 were so badly damaged they're
considered unlivable.
</P>
<P>
   As home to descendents of ex-slaves who settled here after the
Civil War, Princeville drew national attention during the flooding.
Now, as it tries to recover, the town is grappling with preserving
its history while providing a safe environment for residents who
return.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a balancing act,'' said Gavin Smith, an assistant
director for the North Carolina Emergency Management Division.
</P>
<P>
   It could be months, even years, before Princeville's future
becomes clear. Now, as town officials conduct business in nearby
Tarboro and federal inspectors assess damage to water-soaked houses
standing in buggy pools, prospects for the town seem as murky as
the brown film left by receding waters.
</P>
<P>
   This week's culprit is torrential rain from Hurricane Irene,
which is swelling the Tar River above flood stage. Flood waters
were not expected to breach the crescent-shaped earth levy along
the river. For more than 30 years, until Floyd, the man-made wall
had protected Princeville whenever the river rose above its banks.
</P>
<P>
   As the Tar's black waters rose silently, Morning strode across
the levy. He stopped at the sandy spot where Floyd's flooding first
spilled over, before it covered all but Princeville's highest
rooftops and church steeples with foul, swirling water.
</P>
<P>
   He gazed toward the abandoned town, where officials have vowed
to rebuild in a flood plain originally named Freedom Hill by freed
blacks who settled there in 1865. Others, however, are talking
about relocating all but Princeville's most historic buildings and
rebuilding on higher ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to see it come back,'' said Mayor Pro Tem Milton
Johnson, 58, who, like the town's other 2,100 residents, evacuated
during Floyd. He lost almost everything he owned. With most
buildings declared ``unfit for human habitation,'' many of the
people haven't returned. ``It takes people to make a town,'' said
Johnson, a 30-year resident. ``But I don't know what is on people's
minds.''
</P>
<P>
   Residents will get the chance to speak up Monday when the Town
Council meets at Edgecombe Community College in Tarboro with
representatives of federal and state relief agencies. ``We are not
going to tell Princeville what to do,'' North Carolina Gov. Jim
Hunt said. ``I think they will want to take steps to see that this
doesn't happen again.
</P>
<P>
   ``How it is going to be done, I don't know,'' Hunt said. ``You
can say move to a high area, or raise the levy, or put everything
on stilts. There are a lot of ways you can do this, and Princeville
is going to determine its own future.''
</P>
<P>
   Breaks in the levy have been repaired temporarily. Officials are
determining whether Floyd's flooding at Princeville was greater
than what is considered a 100-year level. If that is the case,
federal laws would allow Princeville to rebuild where it is,
officials said. Few property owners in Princeville had flood
insurance. Few imagined the Tar River would rise higher than the
levy, which is 48 feet above sea level.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Good gracious, I reckon, where did all that water
come from?''' Morning recalled. ``Wherever it came from, it wiped
us out.''
</P>
<P>
   Recovery has a long way to go. The stoplights in Princeville
don't work. When residents venture back into their homes, they wear
rubber gloves. At the police station, officers drape soaked
uniforms over squad cars to dry.
</P>
<P>
   At Mutual and Greenwood boulevards, eight feet above the ground,
a tan lounge chair hangs over a dogwood limb. Beside it, a white
wooden bench is stuck on a utility pole hook. Trucks continue to
haul away debris discarded by the roadside.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to construct the whole town like it was,'' said
Rodney Cogdell, 31, Princeville's acting police chief. ``In fact,
it is going to be better.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody thought we were going to bulldoze the whole town,''
he said, ``but we are not.''
</P>
<P>
   Town Manager Sandra White said pledges of money and labor for
rebuilding Princeville are coming in. Outside of Raleigh,
fast-growing, prosperous Cary has adopted the town. ``We are still
in the infancy,'' White said. ``You cannot put a timetable on this
type of devastation.''

PANEL URGES COLLEGE STUDENTS TO CONSIDER MENINGITIS IMMUNIZATION  
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga.)  (mk) 
 By DON VAN NATTA Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A federal health advisory panel on Wednesday urged
first-year college students to consider being immunized against
bacterial meningitis, an extremely rare but potentially fatal
infection.
</P>
<P>
   The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices urged
universities and health professionals to tell college freshmen
about the availability of a vaccine that has proved to be effective
against most strains of meningitis that circulate in the United
States. Health officials have found that college students living in
dormitories are more susceptible to the disease because they live
in close proximity to many other people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Individuals who provide care to freshmen, particularly those
who live in or plan to live in dormitories or residence halls,
should provide information about meningococcal disease and the
benefits of vaccination to those students and their parents,'' the
advisory panel said in a statement that was unanimously adopted
Wednesday at its meeting in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Even among college students, the disease is extremely rare,
striking only 3.8 of every 100,000 freshman dorm residents,
according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Meningococcal invasive infection, or bacterial meningitis, causes
an inflammation of the membranes that cover the brain and spinal
cord. It causes flulike symptoms like headache, high fever, stiff
neck, nausea, vomiting and drowsiness.
</P>
<P>
   Meningitis is an especially virulent disease, and it is fatal in
10 to 15 percent of the cases, studies show. It can get worse very
quickly, sometimes in a matter of hours, if it is not promptly
treated by antibiotics, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, health professionals have become increasingly
concerned about the risks of bacterial meningitis to college
students who live in dormitories. In May, the CDC reported that
college freshmen living in dormitories were six times more likely
to contract meningococcal meningitis than college students living
off campus. Another study, conducted by medical investigators at
the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health in Baltimore, reached
similar conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   The federal advisory committee released its recommendation after
hearing testimony from a Georgia woman whose 20-year-old son died
in April 1998, 26 days after contracting meningitis at Georgia
Southwestern University. Several former students from other
colleges around the country who had contracted meningitis also
testified that they had never been told about the availability of a
vaccine.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Elizabeth Dole, the first woman to be taken
seriously as a candidate for her party's presidential nomination,
dropped out of the race on Wednesday, saying she could not raise
enough money to compete with the personal fortune of one Republican
rival and the political heritage of another.
</P>
<P>
   Her withdrawal came before a single ballot had been cast _ in
itself a searing statement about the overriding importance of money
in politics. Mrs. Dole had raised $4.7 million in the last nine
months, compared with more than $56 million raised by Gov. George
W. Bush of Texas, the Republican front-runner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've learned that the current political calendar and election
laws favor those who get an early start and can tap into huge
private fortunes or who have a pre-existing network of political
supporters,'' Mrs. Dole told reporters at a hotel news conference
here. ``Steve Forbes has unlimited resources. Governor Bush has
raised over $60 million and has about $40 million on hand. Both are
starting to run TV ads next week.''
</P>
<P>
   Their advantages, she said, had overwhelmed her. ``It would be
futile to continue,'' she said, tears welling in her eyes. Mrs.
Dole, a controlled performer and notorious perfectionist, loathed
admitting defeat, friends said, but felt relieved that she was
getting out. She declined to say whom she might endorse for the
nomination and brushed back speculation that she might be a vice
presidential contender.
</P>
<P>
   Her absence does little to alter the balance of power in the
now-seven, now-all-male Republican field, where she had been
sliding from second place to third. But her presence _ as a woman _
carried an element of unpredictability that might have propelled
her to the front of the pack had it not been for Bush's early sweep
of cash and endorsements and Mrs. Dole's own failure to capitalize
on her strengths.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has learned the lesson that others have learned who have
been pruned from the field _ that Governor Bush is sucking all of
the available establishment and center-right money out of the
process,'' said Rich Bond, a former chairman of the Republican
Party. ``She was faced with a very stark choice _ spend 100 percent
of her time fund raising in order to be marginally competitive, or
beat a strategic retreat in the face of actual electoral losses.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Dole blamed her poor showing on tactical problems. She said
she should have become an active candidate sooner than January,
when she quit as president of of the American Red Cross. When she
started making calls for support in early February, she said, it
was too late. ``The endorsements were gone by that point,'' she
said, snapped up by Bush, who, she said, had been laying the
groundwork for his campaign since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   And she painted a grim picture of the cycle of defeat that
ensnares a cashless campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line remains money,'' she said. ``In fact, it's a
kind of Catch-22. Inadequate funding limits the number of staff at
headquarters and in key states. It restricts your ability to
communicate with voters. It places a ceiling on travel and travel
staff. Over time, it becomes nearly impossible to sustain an
effective campaign. Wherever you go, you find yourself answering
questions not so much about guns in the classroom or China in the
World Trade Organization, but money in the bank and ads on the
airwaves.''
</P>
<P>
   But her campaign was beset by other problems, and her candidacy
never gathered steam. Analysts said there was particular
disappointment after she came in a strong third in August in the
Iowa straw poll _ then vanished from public view for a couple of
weeks instead of building her popularity.
</P>
<P>
   Allan J. Lichtman, the chairman of the history department at
American University, said that Mrs. Dole failed to take risks or
set herself apart from her rivals, despite her obvious appeal to
women.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought she had a chance to catch fire and maybe transform
the race,'' he said, ``but she didn't give herself a chance to win.
She didn't do anything to heat things up.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Dole spoke fervently of the historic nature of her campaign
and the excitement she generated among many women, who often
brought their daughters to meet her. But she rejected the
suggestion that she was running as a woman and her message was
uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster based in Atlanta, said that
being female was a plus for Mrs. Dole. ``There was some grumbling
that people were more reluctant to give to a woman, but it gave her
a certain cachet among Republican primary voters and got her more
attention than she might otherwise have gotten,'' he said. ``She
excited moderate and conservative women, and it's a shame she
couldn't have leveraged that cachet into serious contention.''
</P>
<P>
   Another drawback was that she had never been elected to public
office. Only Dwight D. Eisenhower and Herbert Hoover have been
elected president without running for office before.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Mrs. Dole's pollster, Linda DiVall, said that in a
hypothetical match-up with the Democratic frontrunner, Vice
President Al Gore, Mrs. Dole was leading, 44 percent to 37 percent.
Bush leads Gore by even wider margins in most polls, but Ms.
DiVall's point was that only in a primary so skewed by Bush's
outsized bankroll and sweep of endorsements does Mrs. Dole look
wanting.
</P>
<P>
   ``She will clearly go down in history for running a serious and
substantive campaign,'' Ms. DiVall said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Until now, women had run for president as little more than
tokens of protest. The Equal Rights Party began running female
candidates in 1872, to little notice. It was not until 1964 that a
woman, Sen. Margaret Chase Smith of Maine, was nominated at a major
party convention. She received 27 votes at the Republican
convention, then withdrew after the first ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Shirley Chisholm of New York became the first woman and the
first black woman actually to campaign for the nomination of a
major party. In 1972 she earned 151 delegates through the
Democratic primaries and caucuses. This was only a fraction of the
total, but unlike Elizabeth Dole, Ms. Chisholm at least had her
name on the ballot in several states.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Mrs. Dole, a former Cabinet secretary and Harvard-trained
lawyer, was the first woman to be perceived as a serious
presidential prospect. As she said on Wednesday, ``What we've done
is paved the way for the person who will be the first woman
president.'' And there is much speculation now whether she would
consider the vice presidential nomination or at least a position in
a Republican Cabinet. She demurred on Wednesday, but did not rule
out accepting the number-two spot.
</P>
<P>
   Ayres said that Mrs. Dole was a serious prospect for vice
president but added: ``She is a higher-risk choice now because you
won't know how she would react in the heat of a campaign as a
candidate.''

CLINTON USES DOLE WITHDRAWAL TO ATTACK BUSH 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In an exchange that suggested a growing dynamic in
the 2000 presidential race, President Clinton seized the occasion
of Elizabeth Dole's departure from the Republican field Wednesday
to take a swipe at the front-runner, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, and
the Bush campaign promptly returned the favor.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to Mrs. Dole's stated frustration with her campaign's
financial disadvantage, the president said, ``I think that part of
what you see is the fact that Governor Bush is the first candidate
in the history of the modern era, when we've had federal financing,
who's given it up so that an unlimited amount of money could be
raised.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something that some people urged on me four years ago,
because I could have done that, and I decided it wasn't fair,''
said Clinton, who turned the Lincoln Bedroom into guest quarters
for big givers to the Democratic Party. ``I didn't think it was the
right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Karen Hughes, the communications director for the Bush campaign,
thanked Clinton for his perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``We appreciate the president's advice,'' Ms. Hughes said in a
written statement. ``But we don't intend to use him as a model for
how Governor Bush will raise money or lead the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   The acidic thrust-and-parry held a broader significance. It
provided a glimpse into the extent to which Clinton or members of
his administration may try to do the work of impugning and
provoking Bush, thereby freeing Vice President Al Gore, the
Democratic front-runner, from that task.
</P>
<P>
   It also hinted at the Bush campaign's readiness to market Bush
as an antidote to the disappointments of the Clinton presidency.
Although Bush and his advisers often say that his campaign will be
as positive as possible, Bush's public remarks sometimes include
none-too-gentle skewerings of Clinton, who just so happens to be
Gore's friend and boss.

JACK LYNCH, FORMER PRIME MINISTER OF IRELAND, DIES AT 82  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES F. CLARITY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN _ Former Prime Minister Jack Lynch, who declined to send
Irish troops to fight the British police in Northern Ireland at the
start of the sectarian warfare there 30 years ago, died Wednesday
at a hospital in Dublin. He was 82 and lived in Cork, his native
city, south of Dublin.
</P>
<P>
   His restraint is now widely seen as the beginning of a more
tolerant Irish attitude toward British sovereignty in the
Protestant-dominated North, leading ultimately to the peace effort
in 1993 that produced the peace agreement of 1998. The accord gives
Roman Catholics more political power while keeping the province
British, and though implementation is stalled, it is still alive.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch, a tall, pipe-smoking former star athlete in hurling and
Gaelic football, also moved Ireland into the European Economic
Community in 1973, when the country was suffering a depressed
econmy and losing tens of thousands of emigrants. Billions of
dollars of European aid gradually helped Ireland become one of the
25 richest nations in the world, with an unemployment rate of about
5 percent, half the European Union average.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch was prime minister, or Taoiseach (TEE-shuck), from 1966 to
1973 and from 1977 to 1979.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969 he resisted pressure from his party, Fianna Fail, and
from many people in Ireland to send troops across the northern
border to protect Catholics in Londonderry who were under attack by
the police and Protestant paramilitaries.
</P>
<P>
   Hopes of militant nationalists had been raised when he said,
``It is clear the Irish government can no longer stand by and see
innocent people being injured, or worse.''
</P>
<P>
   British officials found the remark inflammatory, but Lynch never
did order troops to invade the northern province. He also
established field hospitals along the border for Catholics coming
south to avoid violence in the north.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, after he had retired from politics, Lynch said sending
in the troops, a tactic that he considered to persuade the United
Nations to send a peacekeeping mission, could have killed 250,000
civilians and soldiers in an Irish-British war.
</P>
<P>
   When Lynch had traveled to Belfast earlier to discuss peace with
British officials, the flamboyant Protestant leader and
self-professed anti-Catholic, the Rev. Ian Paisley, led a group of
Protestant politicians in pelting Lynch's car with snowballs. But
by the late '70s Lynch was talking about peace and tolerance with
Margaret Thatcher, then the British Prime Minister.
</P>
<P>
   He had also assuaged British misgivings _ while provoking Irish
Republican anger _ when he dismissed Charles J. Haughey from his
Cabinet in 1970. Haughey, who succeeded Lynch as prime minister in
1979, was accused and acquitted in an Irish court of plotting to
send guns to northern Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   Haughey, whose finances are now under scrutiny by two special
tribunals and who is alleged to have taken millions of dollars in
gifts from business executives and loan write-offs from banks,
declined today to discuss their differences, saying only that Lynch
``had a capacity to reassure the public.''
</P>
<P>
   The current prime minister, Bertie Ahern, said of Lynch, ``His
firm leadership saw the nation through a period of great political
tension and turbulence and his outstanding work to gain Irish
membership in the EEC changed forever the way we see ourselves as a
nation.''

ASIANS GO TO MARKET, AND FIND THE DEMAND RESTRAINED 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MARK LANDLER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ With Asia's stock markets shaking off two years of
near-paralysis, it is no surprise that Asian companies are rushing
to raise billions of dollars. The surprise is how hard they are
finding the job.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the third-largest Chinese petroleum company, China
National Offshore Oil, postponed a $1 billion share offering _ a
day after it had cut the size of the sale by more than half. And
that came after a leading Thai bank shelved its plan to raise $800
million in a stock sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rally in Asia made companies desperate to raise capital,''
said Marc Faber, the head of his own investment firm in Hong Kong.
``Unfortunately, the markets peaked in July and have been weakening
ever since.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest reversals have unnerved Asian government officials,
corporate executives and investment bankers, none more than in
China and Hong Kong. A flood of new Chinese and Hong Kong shares is
scheduled to reach the Hong Kong stock market over the next six
months.
</P>
<P>
   Now, some bankers express fear that they may have missed the
window to cash in on Asia's improving health. Others worry that the
raft of offerings _ $30 billion or more in Hong Kong alone _ could
overwhelm demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a very large pipeline, which has contributed to the
mart's fragility,'' said Richard Margolis, a regional strategist at
Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing is leading the auction. Besides reviving an attempt to
sell stock in China National Offshore Oil, it plans to offer shares
in several flagship state-owned companies, including the China
Petrochemical Corp., China National Petroleum and China Unicom, the
second-ranking telecommunications provider.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the largest phone company, China Telecom, began
marketing a new offering of at least $2.6 billion in stock and
debt. In 1997, China Telecom, the country's dominant mobile phone
operator, set the standard for China stock issues with a wildly
successful initial public offering.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong's government plans to begin disposing of the $27
billion in shares it acquired in August 1998 in a buying campaign
intended to thwart currency traders whose speculation was
disrupting the market. The shares are being packaged in a mutual
fund that tracks the benchmark Hang Seng index. They will be
offered to investors in chunks, the first of which could raise as
much as $2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The government will begin marketing the fund, to be called the
Tracker Fund of Hong Kong, next Monday and hopes to list it here on
Nov. 12. The government notes that the fund contains the bluest of
blue chips, including the global banking giant HSBC Holdings, which
now has its headquarters in London. Critics said the fund is
overweighted toward property companies.
</P>
<P>
   Optimists note that in 1997, before the regional economic crisis
took hold, Asia's markets produced $42 billion in equity offerings.
</P>
<P>
   ``If everything falls into place, there's no reason why Asian
markets couldn't generate $70 billion in equity financings a
year,'' said John S. Wadsworth Jr., the chairman of Morgan Stanley
Dean Witter Asia. ``But I don't want to give the impression it's a
shoo-in. It all has to come together correctly.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the requisites, he said, is the continued strength of
United States stock markets. Asian markets are heavily influenced
by the performance of the Dow Jones industrial average, and Hong
Kong especially follows Wall Street because its currency's value is
linked to the United States dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Then, too, investors have to be persuaded that Asia is entering
a genuine recovery, not just a temporary rebound. Economists are
confident that Asian countries will return to moderate growth. But
initial euphoria fueled by resurgent stock markets has given way to
a more cautious outlook.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think, after the devastation that Asia suffered, that
you get a V-shaped recovery,'' Faber said, using economics
shorthand for a steep turnaround. ``I think you get a strong
rebound, followed by a period of volatility.''
</P>
<P>
   China National Offshore Oil fell victim to one of these
unpredictable swings. But bankers said that the underwriter,
Salomon Smith Barney, a unit of Citigroup, also priced the offering
too high. When it realized its error, they said, it could not get
approval from Chinese officials to lower the price in time.
</P>
<P>
   Such missteps are common with Chinese companies. Morgan Stanley
Dean Witter had hoped to hold an initial public offering for China
Unicom next month. But it was forced to postpone it until next year
to allow China Unicom to unravel a series of joint ventures with
foreign telecommunications companies.
</P>
<P>
   Wadsworth said the latest wave of Chinese stock offerings is
different from most previous ones in a key respect: the Beijing
government is offering stakes in potential blue-chip companies. In
the past, most Chinese offerings have been been in hastily
assembled conglomerates, many of which were poorly managed or
involved in dubious businesses. The question this time around is
whether quantity will drown out quality.  &QL;

 CHASE POSTS BETTER-THAN-EXPECTED EARNINGS IN 3rd QUARTER  
 (bl)  
 By MELODY PETERSEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Chase Manhattan Corp., the nation's third-largest
bank, said Wednesday that its third-quarter earnings were 67
percent higher than last year _ a report that was better than
expected and came less than two weeks after the company said it was
moving thousands of jobs out of Manhattan to save money.
</P>
<P>
   The company's third-quarter net income was $1.19 billion, or
$1.37 a share, beating analysts' average estimates by 5 cents. In
comparison, a year ago, net income for the third quarter was $738
million or 82 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   The company's shares surged, closing Wednesday, at $75.8125, up
$4.6875.
</P>
<P>
   ``These were very good numbers,'' said Timothy Ghriskey, senior
portfolio manager at Dreyfus Corp., which manages $100 billion in
assets, including shares of Chase. ``We are slightly increasing our
estimates for next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Chase Manhattan has bolstered its earnings recently by
diversifying its traditional banking business and trying to build a
strong investment banking practice. Investment banking fees were
$486 million in the third quarter, compared with $322 million in
the same quarter last year.
</P>
<P>
   The bank has also greatly increased the revenue it earns from
trading. For the quarter, trading revenue was $679 million,
compared with $76 million in the third quarter last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chase's earnings are much more tied to the stock market now,''
said Ghriskey. ``If we have a market correction, Chase will feel
it,'' he said, just like many other banks, which have also
diversified.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 7, Chase Manhattan, the largest corporate employer in
New York City, announced that it would soon move 3,500 of its jobs
there to offices in Florida, Texas and Massachusetts. By moving its
jobs, the bank plans to cut costs significantly. Salaries, real
estate costs, taxes and utility expenses are all lower in Tampa,
Fla., and Dallas, where most of the jobs are to be relocated.
</P>
<P>
   William B. Harrison, Jr., who became the company's president and
chief executive June 1, said Wednesday that the company would
continue to make investments aimed at growing revenues. One of
those investments came in September, when Chase announced it was
buying Hambrecht &AMP; Quist, an investment bank based in San
Francisco, for $1.35 billion. By buying the investment bank, Chase
can increase the number of technology companies and Internet
start-ups it underwrites.
</P>
<P>
   Although it leads its competitiors in the traditional lending
business, Chase has been slow to seize opportunities to expand into
stock underwriting. Competitors like Citigroup, Bank of America and
BankBoston have been quicker to snap up stock underwriters.
</P>
<P>
   In a statment, Harrison said Wednesday: ``This is another strong
quarter, with each of our major business lines _ global banking,
global services and national consumer services _ producing income
growth of 25 percent or more, and return on equity in excess of 20
percent. These earnings continue to demonstrate Chase's disciplined
approach to managing capital and making investments that propel
future growth.''

2 BIG BROKERAGE FIRMS GIVE CLIENTS A WAY TO TRADE ONLINE AND HAVE A
BROKER TOO  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Morgan Stanley Dean Witter calls it ``ichoice.''
Merrill Lynch named its offering ``unlimited advantage.'' But the
message from America's two biggest traditional brokerage firms is
the same: Clients can trade stocks online for cut-rate prices and
keep their broker, too.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley formally introduced an overhaul of its brokerage
operation Wednesday, matching a revamp Merrill began in June and
expects to complete by Dec. 1. The two Wall Street firms had
watched warily as online rivals turned stock trading into a
commodity and lured customers away from them with relentless
advertising, some of which attacked brokers as expensive
anachronisms. Now, they are planning their counterstrike.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world has changed,'' said James F. Higgins, president of
Morgan Stanley's private client group. ``The traditional way of
dividing the market into full service on the one hand and self
directed on the other is not what it's about.''
</P>
<P>
   What it is about, the full-service firms now say, is finding a
way _ and a pricing structure _ that allows customers to trade
cheaply when they want to, but fall back on the help and advice of
a broker when they don't. That model theoretically serves a range
of clients, from the aggressive do-it-yourself stock picker who
likes to bounce ideas off a broker now and then to a busy executive
who relies mostly on his broker but wants to dabble at trading on
the side.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley, Merrill and other leading full-service firms
like Paine Webber and Prudential Securities are converging on a
solution. In exchange for paying a percentage of their invested
assets, customers can trade as much as they want and keep ties to
their brokers, these firms say. The fee-based accounts range widely
in pricing, and the firms offer other types of accounts as well.
But it is clear that the emphasis in the industry has shifted to
paying a standard quarterly fee in exchange for a menu of brokerage
services that includes trading and advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mixing advice with do-it-yourself is a successful model,''
said Richard Strauss, a brokerage industry analyst at Goldman,
Sachs. ``More and more, people want to do it themselves, but they
also want the hand-holding, the service and the attention.''
</P>
<P>
   The full-service firms are cutting prices. Like Charles Schwab,
the leading online brokerage firm, both Morgan Stanley and Merrill
will charge $29.95 for Internet trades for cost-sensitive,
do-it-yourself investors, though that level is still several times
higher than the lowest-priced rivals on line. For clients who
choose to pay a fee on money invested, the comparison is harder to
make.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley, for example, is quoting a wide range of fees
that depend on how much money is invested, what kinds of
investments are made and how much advice the client wants. But fee
levels are coming down as well, to the point that some analysts see
the cost advantage long enjoyed by online firms becoming less of a
factor in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the proposed combination of full-service and
self-service allows the traditional firms to claw back market share
from rivals on line is another question. Schwab, ETrade, Fidelity
and many other online brokers are also offering enhanced services
for their best clients, moving away from the no-frills model that
attracted the most self-confident investors to the Web in the early
days. Schwab in particular has tried to hog the middle ground _ the
area between advice and self direction _ that the full-service
brokers are now rushing to fill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this is going to stop the migration'' from
full-service to online brokerage firms, said L. Russell Keene, an
online brokerage analyst for Putnam, Lovell, de Guardiola &AMP;
Thornton. ``This is something they have to do anyway because of
their infrastructure. They don't have a choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Morgan Stanley and Merrill have designed new retail
brokerage models around, no surprise, their brokers. Merrill has
18,000 of them, Morgan Stanley 12,000. Internet trading has been an
unending nightmare for full-service brokers, who are losing clients
to online competitors and seeing themselves belittled in television
advertisements. But the full-service firms are trying to change
that image.
</P>
<P>
   Both Morgan Stanley and Merrill are increasing ad spending _
Morgan Stanley said Wednesday that its spending over the next year
would double, to more than $100 million _ to promote the idea that
brokers and self-starting Internet traders belong at the same firm.
They will be competing to be heard amid a blitz of ad spending by
online firms urging the opposite. But after months of plotting how
to deal with the Internet challenge, full-service firms now have
something new to sell.
</P>
<P>
   They have some advantages that online competitors will find hard
to match. Both Merrill and Morgan Stanley have blue-chip investment
banking operations along with their brokerage business. That means
customers can have access to first-run stock research, buy stocks
underwritten by the firm, get advice from a broker and trade on
line themselves, all under one roof. Morgan Stanley is a step ahead
of Merrill in this regard.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill is still setting up the technological infrastructure to
allow all of its customers to trade on line. Morgan Stanley plans
to introduce its new integrated platform Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike anyone else, they combine all the elements _ content,
technology and advice,'' said Guy Moszkowski, who follows the
industry for Salomon Smith Barney. ``Customers tastes are evolving
rapidly, but there are clearly people who want it all.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After more than 20 years of battles, truces and
unholy alliances over broad legislation to reshape the nation's
financial system, the measure's fate rests on what has turned into
a bitter and largely symbolic political fight between President
Clinton and Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   More than seven hours of negotiations Wednesday involving Gramm,
chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, Treasury Secretary
Lawrence Summers and Gene Sperling, the president's top economic
adviser, inched closer to a resolution but failed to yield a deal
over the legislation's effect on a 1977 law aimed at eradicating
discrimination in lending.
</P>
<P>
   The main sticking point appeared to be whether to require
community groups to divulge the details of deals they strike with
banks to make loans to minorities and the disadvantaged.
</P>
<P>
   The talks may continue this week, or Gramm, and his counterpart
in the House, Rep. James Leach, may try to force the issue by a
vote of the House-Senate conference committee.
</P>
<P>
   But even as the administration and Gramm moved slightly closer
to agreement, the positions on both sides of the Community
Reinvestment Act of 1977 have begun to harden. As the talks, which
began late Monday night, begin to stretch out, the prospects of
overhauling the banking system begin to fade.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides have begun to recognize political benefits from
standing firm as the new election cycle begins, even as the most
powerful financial interests in America clamor for a new law. Gramm
and other Republicans would undoubtedly blame the White House for
failing to approve a bill long sought by Wall Street and corporate
America. Equally, Clinton and Vice President Al Gore would
undoubtedly be able to accuse the Republicans of retarding decades
of progress in civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``When symbolic politics begins to get elevated, it gets harder
to make a deal,'' said one Democratic senator who wants to see the
legislation signed into law.
</P>
<P>
   Lobbyists who champion the legislation agreed. ``If there is not
a bill, it will be because the White House and the Treasury
Department feel very strongly about the Community Reinvestment Act,
and Senator Gramm feels equally strongly, and both sides think they
will win the White House next term and can get a better bill,''
said Paul A. Equale, a lobbyist for the Independent Insurance
Agents of America.
</P>
<P>
   Already Wednesday there was talk on both sides that foreshadowed
what may be to come, including angry accusations over race as it
related to several issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The array of anti-minority sentiment expressed almost each
week now by Republicans is historic,'' said Sen. Tom Daschle,
D-S.D., the minority leader, citing Gramm's view on the Community
Reinvestment Act, among other things. ``I have never seen a party
become this defiant when it comes to protecting minority rights in
my time in public life.''
</P>
<P>
   Gramm said that ``in the end the administration has to decide if
they want a bill or not.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be that we have to wait 15 months for a new
administration to approve this bill,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   For years, efforts to overhaul the nation's financial system
failed in Congress because three of Washington's most powerful
lobbying interests _ banks, insurers and securities firms _ were at
war, each lobbying to defeat the interests of the other. Their
efforts led to many stalemates, but ultimately, the three interests
became allies, as the distinctions between the financial products
offered by the three industries began to blur.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the prospects of the legislation remained dim because of
a turf war between the Treasury and the Federal Reserve over which
agency should oversee the new financial conglomerates of the 21st
Century.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Fed and the Treasury reached an agreement to
share that authority, and the mood brightened considerably among
advocates for wholesale changes to the 66 years worth of laws that
have made it difficult for banks to expand into securities and
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Now one obstacle remains in the way of a new law: a partisan
fight between Democrats and Republicans over the meaning of
community lending and the philosophy behind the Community
Reinvestment Act, a 22-year-old law that was intended to eradicate
red-lining and other forms of discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   While the provisions under debate affect relatively obscure
elements of the act, they are powerfully symbolic, affecting core
constituencies of both parties. Gramm has repeatedly criticized the
way regulators have interpreted the act, saying the federal
government should not be in the business of ``reallocating
capital'' and that the law imposes unnecessary and burdensome
requirements on small banks and savings associations.
</P>
<P>
   His critics say that the Financial Services Act of 1999, as his
bill is called, would roll-back the Community Reinvestment Act.
Those critics include the Congressional Black Caucus, a group that
helped rescue Clinton from removal during the impeachment
proceedings this year.
</P>
<P>
   There were fresh signs Wednesday that Democrats and Republicans
were hardening their views. Nine Republicans sent a letter to Gramm
urging him to hold the line and not make any significant
concessions on the issue. At the same time, the Rev. Jesse Jackson
said in an interview that he was urging the White House to hold
firm and that a compromise on the Community Reinvestment Act would
undermine the president's commitment to raising capital in poor
areas.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats criticized the White House on Wednesday, saying
that it had caved in to industry pressure by abandoning their fight
to put provisions in the legislation that would have made it more
difficult for financial conglomerates to share confidential
customer information with other businesses and telemarketers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They inexplicably pulled the rug out from underneath us,''
said Sen. Richard H. Bryan, D-Nev., who had been leading an effort
in the Senate for provisions that would have strengthened the
privacy protection elements of the legislation.

MARKET PLACE: A FLUSTERED HOUR OF TRADING ON THE BIG BOARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Martha Stewart Omnimedia initial public offering
was the hottest one to hit the New York Stock Exchange in many
years. The shares, which were offered at $18 each, more than
doubled when they began trading Tuesday morning. Then they went
much higher.
</P>
<P>
   But while the Big Board may be happy to have had one of the most
notable initial offerings of the year, it should not be happy with
the way the stock traded in the first hectic hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks very peculiar,'' said a senior official of the
Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday. He declined to be
identified, or to say what action, if any, might be taken.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all hot initial offerings in recent years have been
listed on the Nasdaq market, where the existence of multiple market
makers can produce chaos when a stock opens for trading. But the
Big Board, with an auction market centered on a single specialist
firm, contends that it is able to provide something better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our desire to bring supply and demand into balance is what
makes us different,'' said New York Stock Exchange president
William Johnston in a telephone interview Wednesday. ``The whole
point of the auction market is to try and get sellers and buyers
together and trade at reasonable prices.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnston argued that the Big Board accomplished just that. It
was true that the trades that were reported by the exchange seemed
to reflect an effort to have a balance of buyers and sellers. But
that was not true in the so-called third market, comprising
brokerage firms that trade exchange-listed stocks off the exchange.
</P>
<P>
   ``The exchange doesn't like to halt the stock,'' said one trader
involved in Tuesday's action. ``In lieu of halting the stock, they
spread the quote, which effectively stops trading in the stock and
allows natural buyers and sellers to come together.''
</P>
<P>
   But while trading was more or less halted on the Big Board, the
third market was up and running. From 10:09 a.m. through 10:21
a.m., the posted bid stayed at $37.44 a share. But the ask price
rose as high as $52. Small investors who had submitted market
orders, and whose orders were sent by their brokerage firms to
third-market brokers rather than to the exchange floor, were taken
to the cleaners. Those who were selling stock were paid the $37.44
price. Those who were buying were charged up to $52 a share.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buying at $37 and selling at $52 is extremely profitable,''
Johnston said dryly.
</P>
<P>
   All the trades at $52 were later canceled, perhaps out of
embarrassment. But some of the $50 orders stood, as did many others
above $47.50 a share, the highest the stock traded on the exchange
floor.
</P>
<P>
   The Martha Stewart offering was hot in large part because the
founder of the company is so well known. Only 8.28 million shares
were available for trading, including the offering of 7.2 million
shares and the shares the underwriter had an option to sell if
demand was high.
</P>
<P>
   The opening trade in the stock, at 10:08 a.m., was for 3.6
million shares. The price was $37.25, more than double the price
that investors had paid in the offering.
</P>
<P>
   But then, said John Lyden, a senior managing director of Lyden,
Dolan, Nick &AMP; Co., the specialist firm that handled the stock,
``the Dot machine just lit up.'' That is the machine that relays
orders from small investors. As the buy orders poured in,
specialists _ including Lyden's son, Barry, also a senior managing
director _ conferred with representatives of Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter, the lead underwriter, about prices at which more shares
would be available from customers who had bought in the offering.
To draw in those shares, the posted ask price began to rise, first
to $45 at 10:10, then to $50 at 10:11 and finally to $52 at 10:20.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Board executed large trades, sweeping in all the orders
it had, at $45 at 10:14, at $46 at 10:17 and at $47 at 10:19. In
the meantime, many trades were reported by third-market firms. The
Big Board high trade, of $47.50, was reported at 10:22, and by
10:23 the spread was down to reasonable levels.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, a clerk for Lyden, Dolan made a serious error,
and then repeated it a few minutes later. About 150,000 of the
324,200 shares bought in the $45 trade were bought by customers
whose orders had arrived over the Dot machine. But because the
clerk did not push the right button, the Dot machine still showed
those orders waiting to be executed. He made the same mistake on
the $46 trade. So some orders were executed again at $47.
</P>
<P>
   By the time that mistake was discovered hours later, the price
of the stock had fallen to the high $30s. Because the real buyers
were not going to buy the shares three times, the specialist became
the buyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost substantial money,'' said John Lyden, refusing to
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, because the error had made demand appear to be higher
than it was, it drove up the price. ``There is no way it sells at
$47.50'' without the error, he said.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the day, the price had fallen to $35.56, a price
that may have been driven down as the specialist sold some of the
shares that it had been forced to buy because of the mistake.
Wednesday it rose $4.1875, to $39.75. Total volume for the two days
was 14.5 million shares.
</P>
<P>
   And what will happen to the clerk who made the mistake? ``I'm
not going to fire him,'' Lyden said.
</P>
<P>
   With benefit of hindsight, it appears that the Big Board would
have served the public much better if it had simply halted trading
to deal with the huge volume of orders. The clerk's mistake might
not have been made, and third-market brokers would not have been
given a huge spread to work with.
</P>
<P>
   If trading had been halted, that would have seemed embarrassing
to exchange officials, who are tired of taunts from Nasdaq about
such halts. But what actually happened should be far more
embarrassing. &QL;

IBM EXPECTS LOWER PROFITS DUE TO REDUCED DEMAND FOR MAINFRAMES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   IBM warned investors Wednesday that its profits would be as much
as 15 percent below expectations in the current quarter and in the
first quarter of next year, because corporations' efforts to deal
with the Year 2000 computer problem were dampening demand for its
big mainframe systems.
</P>
<P>
   For the third quarter, ending Sept. 30, International Business
Machines Corp. met Wall Street's profit expectations, despite a
sharp drop in mainframe sales. The company said Wednesday it earned
$1.8 billion, or 93 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
   But that news was overshadowed by its announcement that for the
next two quarters, earnings would be 15 to 20 cents below the
corresponding quarter a year earlier. That would represent a profit
shortfall of as much as $540 million below what analysts had been
expecting for each of the two quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, investors, anticipating a solid earnings
report, sent IBM's shares up $7.75 to $112.75. But after the 4 p.m.
announcement, they fell sharply, ending the trading day at $107,
and falling to as low as $99 in after-hours trading.
</P>
<P>
   IBM's announcement was the latest in a series of surprising _
and contradictory _ results posted by technology companies, a mixed
bag that has sent technology stocks careening.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, shares in Unisys fell by one-third when it said its
revenue growth rate had slowed. On Monday, Dell Computer said its
profits would suffer because the Taiwan earthquake was causing
memory prices to rise. Its shares fell by 8.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday, Microsoft reported that its profits were well above
expectations because of ``awesome'' demand for personal computers.
As a result, Microsoft's shares rose by $5 15/16 Wednesday, and the
entire Nasdaq market rose by 104 points to 2466.
</P>
<P>
   ``Between Y2K and Taiwan, the tech stock market is on pins and
needles,'' said Steven Milunovich, an analyst with Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Milunovich said that IBM's woes shouldn't affect most
other technology firms, as the slowdown is related to the sort of
very large computers for which IBM has few competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like most of the Y2K effect has landed on IBM's
doorstep,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, IBM said that its largest customers, like banks
and insurance companies, had bought extra mainframes earlier in the
year in order to test their software to make sure it would operate
properly with dates after the turn of the millennium. Now that this
testing is largely completed, the companies have the extra machines
available to put to work in their main systems, reducing their need
to make new purchases.
</P>
<P>
   IBM said that it had not expected the slowdown because it had
thought that the surge in mainframe purchases in recent quarters
was due to a rise in new applications related to the Internet.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Analysts expressed frustration that IBM hadn't warned them of
the shortfall.
</P>
<P>
   ``They provided a level of comfort that didn't exist,'' said
Laura Conigliaro, an analyst with Goldman Sachs.``You can never
believe companies when they give you a prediction for the end of
the year at the beginning of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call with investors, IBM chief financial officer
Douglas Maine said the company's earlier surveys of customers
indicated that demand for mainframes would hold up through the end
of the year and that it didn't notice the shortfall until the end
of the third quarter. He said that after the first quarter of 2000,
the company expected its sales to rebound to the levels that
analysts had expected.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Unisys reported that its sales of mainframes had
increased in the third quarter, but would fall by a corresponding
amount in the fourth quarter, because its customers didn't want to
install new machines right before new years.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, IBM said its revenue increased by 5 percent to $21.1
billion in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   It earned 93 cents per share, but of that, 3 cents or $63
million, represented one-time items. Thus its 90 cent per share
operating profit matched expectations.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Year 2000 problem, IBM said its results were
also hurt by a shortage of display screens for its popular line of
ThinkPad portable computers and by sharp price cutting in hard disk
drives.
</P>
<P>
   Making up for these shortfalls, IBM said it experienced
continued growth in computer services, software and semiconductors.
Moreover, it was able to cut $100 million in expenses compared with
a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of mainframes and other big computers known as servers
fell by 30 percent to $2.0 billion. The pre-tax profit from the
servers fell by 60 percent to $295 million.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the company's money-losing personal computer
business continued to show improvement. Sales increased by 11
percent to $3.7 billion. The company lost $69 million from PCs, but
that was a 43 percent improvement over last year, mainly because
the company is shifting sales to higher margin products like
portables. On Tuesday, IBM said that it would no longer sell
desktop computers to consumers through retail stores and that it
would shift the business to the Internet, where costs are lower.
</P>
<P>
   IBM's global services unit posted sales of $7.9 billion, up 12
percent. The increase would have been 15 percent, the company said,
had it not sold its network unit to AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   IBM said that it did not expect the earthquake in Taiwan to have
a significant effect on its business. It is paying more for memory
and other components, but the cost is partially offset because
IBM's semiconductor business benefits from the higher market
prices.

A MORE SUBDUED TYSON GETTING READY TO RETURN 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS, Nev. _ The promoter Dan Goossen introduced Mike Tyson
Wednesday afternoon at a news conference for his heavyweight bout
Saturday against Orlin Norris at the MGM Grand, and everyone waited
and waited and waited some more.
</P>
<P>
   After about two minutes, Tyson emerged from behind a curtain
onto the stage. It was not a grand entrance, such as when he
entered wearing a crown and flowing royal robe before his bout
against Tony Tucker to unify the heavyweight title in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with his latest attempt to be more mature, Tyson was
subdued. No ranting. No raving. No cursing. About as heated as it
got was near the end when Tyson was asked how he saw the fight
going and what he planned to do. ``I'm bringing some pain, baby,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson (46-3) has not fought since he met Francois Botha on Jan.
16. Botha toyed with Tyson over four rounds until Botha walked into
Tyson's loaded right hand in the fifth round and was knocked out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hadn't fought in two and a half years,'' said Tyson, who is
33. ``That wasn't a good experience, but a sensational ending.''
</P>
<P>
   Both of the major fights this year were unsatisfying duds:
Evander Holyfield and Lennox Lewis fought a controversial draw in
March, and Oscar De La Hoya ran a marathon and lost his title to
Felix Trinidad last month without the exchange of a telling blow.
So Tyson has the opportunity to bring some excitement back into the
sport.
</P>
<P>
   If he can keep his head about him, maintain his current level of
maturity, stay out of trouble and fight on a regular basis, Tyson
can regain viability in the sport. Talks are already under way for
him to fight at Madison Square Garden in December. Plans are also
being made for a bout in February of next year.
</P>
<P>
   And for the first time since he first lost to Holyfield in 1997,
Tyson is talking about being heavyweight champion again. ``If
nothing happens to me, like Monday following Sunday, I'll be
champion again,'' Tyson said.
</P>
<P>
   Goossen, who has a four-fight deal with Tyson, is eager to see
how Tyson looks against Norris, a former cruiserweight with a 55-5
record. That will determine Tyson's credibility as a heavyweight
contender.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mentally, he's got his stuff together,'' Goossen said. ``He's
talking about being the world champion again. I didn't hear that in
the Botha fight. He says he's in the best shape he's been in in the
last 10 years. I believe him, because I see it.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyson had to overcome several hurdles to set up the Botha fight.
He had to undergo a battery of psychological tests at Massachusetts
General Hospital in Boston to satisfy the Nevada Athletic
Commission that he was psychologically fit to return to the ring.
The commission had revoked Tyson's license after he bit Holyfield's
ears during a bout on June 29, 1997. Tyson was also facing assault
charges in Maryland, involving a minor fender-bender after which he
punched one man and kicked another.
</P>
<P>
   After the Botha fight, Tyson was sentenced to one year in jail
on the charges. He spent three and a half months in jail. It may
have been humiliating, but Tyson has not blamed anyone else for his
troubles: he has said he wants to take responsibility for his
actions. He said he was trying to salvage his marriage, which had
been strained.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything that I've been through has been slightly stressful,
but I overcame it,'' Tyson said.
</P>
<P>
   He came out of jail in June weighing 280 pounds. Through
conditioning and training he has trimmed down to 220 pounds. He has
rehired Jay Bright as one of his trainers. Bright, a disciple of
Cus D'Amato, is working with Tommy Brooks, whom Tyson hired before
the Botha fight to try to get Tyson back to the form he had 10
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   During a public sparring session here on Tuesday afternoon,
Tyson displayed the kind of explosiveness and hand speed that made
him dangerous when he raced through the heavyweight division in the
late 1980's. His sharp left hook knocked down a sparring partner,
Everett Martin, in the first round of a three-round session.
Wednesday Tyson used a double left hook to knock down another
sparring partner, Stan Allen. The session was stopped.
</P>
<P>
   It is always hard to know with Tyson whether he has really
changed. Even Shelly Finkel, Tyson's adviser, said as much.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' Finkel said about Tyson's new mature approach.
``All I know if for the last four or five weeks he's really been
trying.''
</P>

   Prospects for Bank Law Fade, on Political Fight
</P>
<P>
   Prospects of overhauling the nation's financial system have
begun to fade, as Clinton administration officials and Sen. Phil
Gramm, R-Texas, remain locked in a bitter and largely symbolic
fight over a 1977 law aimed at eradicating discrimination in
lending.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides have begun to recognize political benefits of
standing firm as the new election cycle begins, even as the most
powerful financial interests in America clamor for a new law.

   Morgan Stanley in Online Plan
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley Dean Witter formally introduced an overhaul of
its brokerage operation, matching a revamp that Merrill Lynch began
in June. The message from America's two biggest traditional
brokerage firms is the same: Clients can trade stocks online for
cut-rate prices and keep their brokers, too. Some analysts said the
move, which sent the firm's stock up, was inevitable as clients
switched to online competitors.

   Airlines Earnings Disappoint
</P>
<P>
   U S Airways, Trans World Airlines, and UAL continued the trend
of weakened third-quarter airline earnings as rising fuel prices,
the growing number of airplane seats and bad weather eroded

spot.
</P>

A TOLERANT AND INCLUSIVE MUSLIM TRADITION THRIVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The election of Indonesia's most important Muslim
religious leader as its first democratically chosen president was
welcomed Wednesday by Western governments and human rights
advocates who describe the new Indonesian leader as a champion of
human rights and religious tolerance.
</P>
<P>
   Islam as practiced by the new president _ Abdurrahman Wahid,
leader of what amounts to the largest Muslim political party in
Indonesia _ is a faith in which religious and cultural differences
between neighbors are carefully respected, and in which free speech
is a right.
</P>
<P>
   His rise to power put human rights groups in an unusual _ and,
they said, welcome _ position: greeting the ascension of a foreign
religious leader to the reins of power.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights advocates often cringe when religious leaders take
control of a government, fearing the intolerance of Muslim-governed
nations like Iran or Afghanistan, or recalling the first months
after Hindu nationalists took power in India last year and were
accused of orchestrating violence against Muslims and Christians.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be very important in terms of showing the
rest of the world such a tolerant Muslim leader,'' said Sidney
Jones, Asia director of Human Rights Watch.
</P>
<P>
   Although she is critical of some of Wahid's political alliances,
Ms. Jones said that he ``has personally been a staunch defender of
human rights'' and that his election begins ``an experiment to see
whether an overwhelmingly Muslim country can be a true democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People despair of that ever happening,'' she said. ``Maybe
Indonesia will be the first.''
</P>
<P>
   With approximately 220 million people, 90 percent of whom
describe themselves as Muslim, Indonesia is home to more followers
of Islam than the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   The faith found its way to Indonesia beginning in the 13th
centurie aboard the trading ships from the Indian subcontinent.
Islam was not forced on the population, and it did not replace
traditional Indonesian spirit-worship and mysticisim. Rather it
became layered upon Hindu and Buddhist practices.
</P>
<P>
   For most Indonesians, the fact that they are Muslims is only one
element of their identity, and not necessarily the first to come to
mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Islam in Indonesia has never been an extreme orthodoxy,'' said
James Clad, a professor of Southeast Asian politics at Georgetown
University who recently returned from Indonesia. ``It's a religion
there that has been in tune with traditions that are open to
tolerance and a willingness to disagree. Broadly speaking, this is
a place where Islamic fundamentalism finds the soil pretty thin.''
</P>
<P>
   When Muslim political parties were first formed in Indonesia
early this century, few called for an Islamic state. Instead,
historians say, they reflected a desire to defend their basic
political and economic rights from encroachments by the Dutch
colonialists.
</P>
<P>
   When Indonesia won its independence in 1949, its constitution
guaranteed freedom of religion, and Hinduism, Buddhism and
Christianity are widely and openly practiced.
</P>
<P>
   In recent decades, no one has been a more important champion of
religious and cultural tolerance than Wahid, the leader of the
Council of Islamic Scholars.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s and early 1990s, Wahid was outspoken in his
condemnation of human rights abuses by the Indonesian Army in East
Timor.
</P>
<P>
   ''The richness of Indonesia _ it's diversity _ is also its
weakness,'' he said in an interview in 1993. ``Look at what has
happened in Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union. That's what I'm afraid
of in Indonesia _ disintegration.''

UPS' INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING COULD BE BIGGEST EVER 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   United Parcel Service said Wednesday that it could raise as much
as $4.6 billion when it sells its shares to investors for the first
time in its 92-year history later this year, making its initial
public offering perhaps the biggest ever.
</P>
<P>
   UPS, which is the world's largest package &UR; - &LR; delivery company and
is currently owned by its employees, announced in July that it was
finally succumbing to the siren song of Wall Street and would sell
its shares to the public. But until Wednesday it did not say how
many shares it would sell or at what price.
</P>
<P>
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, UPS
revealed that it planned to sell 109.4 million shares, or a 9
percent stake, at an estimated price between $36 and $42. At the
high end of the spectrum, UPS would raise $4.6 billion, larger than
the record $4.4 billion raised by Conoco last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sense is it is going to be very well subscribed,'' Edward
Wolfe, transportation analyst at Bears Stearns, said of the UPS
offering. ``I am getting more questions on a daily basis about this
than about any other company I am following. There is tremendous
interest.''
</P>
<P>
   UPS hopes to sell the stock in November after employees vote to
approve the offering later this month. Oddly enough, the company,
which had $25 billion in sales last year and has more than $3
billion in cash on its balance sheet, does not need the money. It
has said it would use the cash it raised to buy shares back from
its employees.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it was going public because it needed to have
stock to use for acquisitions at a time when the package &UR; - &LR; delivery
industry is consolidating around a few global players, including
UPS &UR; ; &LR;  FDX Corp., which is the parent of Federal Express &UR; ; &LR;  DHL,
and several European postal services.
</P>
<P>
   To preserve its employee-managed culture, UPS has structured the
stock offering so that 99 percent of the voting rights will remain
with its employee-managers.
</P>
<P>
   Though Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, the offering's lead
underwriter, suggested the estimated price range between $36 and
$42, the UPS sale could ultimately yield more.
</P>
<P>
   Neil Barsky, co-manager of MRG Nucleus Fund, which invests in
new public companies, said that in general there had been two kinds
of initial public offerings recently: established large, name-brand
companies, like Conoco and Delphi Automotive, with long histories
and strong earnings, and Internet startups with short track records
and no earnings.
</P>
<P>
   While the prices of Internet offerings have often soared, few of
the established companies have priced above their suggested ranges.
But UPS is an interesting case because in addition to being a
long-established business with multibillion-dollar earnings, it
also has a strong Internet connection since its signature brown
trucks deliver many of the products now being ordered via the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts said they felt UPS could be priced like an
Internet offering. ``Why not? It helped Martha Stewart and WWF,
both of which were positioned as Internet plays,'' Barsky said,
referring to two recent successful offerings _ Martha Stewart
Living Omnimedia and World Wrestling Federation Entertainment.
``And UPS is arguably much more related to the Internet economy
than they are.''

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Everything the UCLA Bruins are experiencing this
season _ the injuries, the preseason suspensions, the crushing
last-second loss, the departure of an All-American quarterback _
they've lived before.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, as now, the momentum of back-to-back 10-win seasons
ended when several important players were suspended for offseason
infractions.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, the Bruins were replacing an All-American quarterback,
Troy Aikman, with a redshirt freshman, Bret Johnson. Now, they're
replacing an All-American quarterback, Cade McNown, with a redshirt
freshman, Cory Paus.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, they suffered a demoralizing loss when Michigan scored
nine points in the last 90 seconds to escape with a 24-23 victory.
This year, their Rose Bowl chances vanished when Arizona State's
Delvon Flowers raced 49 yards for the winning touchdown with 23
seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago this week, the Bruins were 3-4 after a one-point
loss at Oregon State. This year, the Bruins are 3-4 entering
Saturday's game at Oregon State.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, they collapsed in the stretch and finished 3-7-1.
</P>
<P>
   This year . . . what?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a strange year,'' Bruins coach Bob Toledo said.
``Boy, I hope it all passes.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't count on it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The summer of '89 was as turbulent as the summer of '99.
Starting linebacker Roman Phifer and cornerback Damion Lyons were
suspended for the season and given two years probation for beating
up a campus security officer. Cornerback Willie Crawford was
suspended by the dean of students for allegedly stealing a woman's
handbag and charging her credit card. Safety Anthony Burnett was
ruled academically ineligible and dismissed from school.
</P>
<P>
   All four were starters or top reserves.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins were ranked ninth in the preseason polls despite a
rookie quarterback _ Johnson won the job over sophomore Jim Bonds _
an unproven running game, a suspension-depleted secondary and a
young defense. Sound familiar?
</P>
<P>
   What Ohio State was to UCLA this year, Tennessee was in '89. The
Volunteers overwhelmed UCLA's frontlines, rushed for 247 yards and
took a 24-0 lead before the Bruins scored a late touchdown. A week
later, UCLA rallied past San Diego State 28-25 when Johnson scored
with two minutes left.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan was next. On a warm, late-September afternoon in the
Rose Bowl, the Bruins jumped to a 23-15 lead midway through the
fourth quarter, then crumbled. Michigan scored with 1:35 left,
recovered an onside kick, then made the game-winning field goal
with a second remaining.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins recovered in time to beat Cal and Arizona State, but
the success didn't last. The end came Oct. 14 in Arizona Stadium,
under a deep-blue desert sky. No one suspected it would carry such
a wallop.
</P>
<P>
   With an extra week to prepare, Wildcats coach Dick Tomey
jettisoned his beloved triple option (three running backs) and flew
to Colorado for a quick lesson in the Buffaloes' I-formation (two
running backs). UCLA was unprepared, then overpowered as Arizona
rushed for 480 yards in a 42-7 win.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was one of the most devastating losses and physical
poundings we've ever taken,'' longtime assistant coach Bob Field
said. ``It crushed us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins didn't win another game.
</P>
<P>
   A week later, they lost at Oregon State 18-17 when the Beavers
covered 67 yards in the final minutes for the winning touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we're in a rebuilding-type process,'' coach Terry
Donahue said at the time. ``But we did not expect to be 3-4.''
</P>
<P>
   It got worse. Once their bowl chances disappeared, so did their
spirit. They lacked senior leadership and, because of the
suspensions, had no continuity.
</P>
<P>
   Washington scored two touchdowns in the fourth quarter for a
28-27 victory in the Rose Bowl. The Bruins lost a close game at
Stanford, then watched helplessly as Oregon scored 24 consecutive
points in the second half for an easy victory.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins had lost five in a row _ their longest streak in 26
years _ when the USC game arrived. Although they played with
passion not shown since Michigan, they settled for a 10-10 tie when
kicker Alfredo Velasco's last-second field goal hit the crossbar, a
fitting, painful end to their worst season since 1971. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Are these Bruins destined for a similar fate? Without a large
senior class, will they descend into the leaderless mire that
claimed the '89 team? Without a New Year's Day bowl in sight, will
they summon motivation for any game save USC? Will last week's
pounding by Cal have the same impact as the Arizona loss in '89?
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, the important thing is to maintain our focus,''
defensive captain Pete Holland said, unknowingly echoing the '89
team's greatest failing. ``The most challenging thing is adjusting,
given the way the last two seasons went.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the guys were here when we went 10-2 each year, and it
would be easy to panic, to say, `What do we do now?' But we have to
keep goals in mind. At no point is all lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the ingredients for a collapse are present. The
Bruins have just 12 healthy seniors, and six participated in the
humiliating disabled-parking scam. The depth chart oozes freshmen
and sophomores. The quarterback has started four games. The
secondary is a mess. There's no January bowl to play for, no Pac-10
title at stake and a difficult schedule looms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's shocked,'' injured cornerback Jason Bell said.
``We're not a losing school. We've been 10-2 two years in a row. We
expect to win and we have a lot of good, young players. I don't
know why we aren't winning.''
</P>
<P>
   They didn't know in 1989, either.

JUDGE BARS USE OF SECRET DATA TO HOLD IMMIGRANTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By RONALD SMOTHERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ A federal District judge ruled Wednesday that the
use of secret evidence of alleged terrorist connections to detain
immigrants violated the due-process protections of the
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   In a strongly worded decision, the first in the nation to find
such use of secret evidence unconstitutional, Judge William H.
Walls ordered the immediate release of Hany Kiareldeen, 31, a
Palestinian who has been held for 18 months in a New Jersey county
jail while immigration officials have sought to deport him.
</P>
<P>
   But lawyers for the Immigration and Naturalization Service
quickly obtained a stay from the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals,
which agreed to hear an appeal of the release order on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   That meant that Kiareldeen would remain in the Hudson County
Correctional Center for at least another day, said Regis Fernandez,
one of his lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we will get him out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the delay, the judge's ruling delighted Kiareldeen's
lawyers and other national advocates for detained immigrants, who
said it made it clear that resident aliens have the same rights to
due process that citizens have.
</P>
<P>
   They also said the ruling would help the cases of about 20 other
people of Arab descent whom the immigration service is holding on
the basis of classified information from undisclosed sources.
</P>
<P>
   All are considered to have connections to terrorist groups, and
are therefore deemed threats to national security, according to the
sketchy summaries of the secret evidence against them.
</P>
<P>
   In Kiareldeen's case, the summaries of the classified FBI
reports refer to sources linking him to one of the men convicted in
the 1993 World Trade Center bombing.
</P>
<P>
   In his 35-page decision, Walls wrote ominously of ``government
processes initiated and prosecuted in darkness,'' and said the case
raised ``serious issues about the integrity of the adversarial
process.'' He also took the unusual step of ordering the
immigration agency to pay Kiareldeen's lawyers' fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is as strong an opinion as we could have ever hoped
for,'' said David Cole, a volunteer lawyer with the Center for
Constitutional Rights, a Manhattan nonprofit legal services agency.
An expert on secret evidence, he has been one of Kiareldeen's
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   William Strasberg, a spokesman for the immigration service, said
the agency had sought to prevent Kiareldeen's release Wednesday
because it continues to believe that Kiareldeen is a ``terrorist
threat.'' He declined to give any details of the legal basis of the
agency's appeal of the release order, and added that it was
considering whether to appeal the decision itself.
</P>
<P>
   Walls' ruling came just five days after administrative law
judges on the Board of Immigration Appeals, in another rebuke to
the government's use of secret evidence in the case, upheld an
immigration court judge's April ruling that Kiareldeen should not
be deported and that he was entitled to a green card, which grants
legal residence in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   That ruling had not led to his release because the immigration
agency obtained a stay while it decided whether to appeal the
decision to Attorney General Janet Reno.
</P>
<P>
   In a related ruling late Wednesday, a Board of Immigration
Appeals panel ordered that Kiareldeen be released on $1,500 bond.
That ruling, like the earlier immigration court rulings, does not
take precedence over the federal court actions, said Fernandez, but
it serves to bolster his argument that his client is not connected
to terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Kiareldeen, who came to the United States nine years ago on a
student visa, had maintained throughout his hearings before the
immigration judges that the allegations against him were the work
of a vindictive former wife who was born in Egypt. He had been
remarried to an American citizen and was applying for a green card
when he was taken into custody by immigration authorities in March
1998 for having an expired student visa.
</P>
<P>
   It was only then that he learned that the government had
evidence that it would not disclose. On the basis of that evidence,
the government accuses him of having links to terrorist groups,
threatening the life of Ms. Reno and, a week before the bombing,
meeting in his Nutley, N.J., home with Nidal Ayyad, one of the men
convicted in the World Trade Center attack.
</P>
<P>
   Kiareldeen's lawyer presented documentation and more than a
dozen witnesses countering those charges while immigration lawyers
did little more than repeat the charges in the FBI report.
</P>
<P>
   In his ruling, Walls noted that prior court precedents dating
back to the 1950s had dealt narrowly with the issue of whether
federal immigration laws and regulations authorized the use of
classified information that can be kept secret in determining
detention, exclusion, deportation or change in immigrant status.
None of those rulings, however, had addressed ``the overall
fairness'' and constitutionality of the practice, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Review of the Immigration and Naturalization Services
procedures involving Kiareldeen leads the court to believe that the
petitioner's case is an example of the dangers of secret
evidence,'' Walls wrote. ``Here, the government's reliance on
secret evidence violates the due-process protections that the
Constitution directs must be extended to all persons within the
United States, citizens and resident aliens alike.''
</P>
<P>
   He wrote that the unclassified summaries of the secret evidence
were ``unreliable'' and lacking in detail or attribution, forcing
Kiareldeen to battle ``anonymous slurs of unseen and unsworn
informers.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge said that he could hardly imagine a situation ``more
likely to result in erroneous deprivations.'' And he wrote that his
skepticism about the secret evidence was deepened by the fact that
the government did not find it serious enough to bring criminal
charges against Kiareldeen.

S.L. DRITZ, 88, RETOOLER OF ZIPPER AND OTHER HANDY SEWING ITEMS
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Fla.)  (nk) 
 By WILLIAM H. HONAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stanley L. Dritz, the last of four brothers whose gadgets made
their family name a household word for generations of people who
sew, died Saturday at the White Plains Hospital in White Plains,
N.Y. He was 88.
</P>
<P>
   Dritz had lived in Palm Beach, Fla., since his retirement more
than 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   When he was president of John Dritz &AMP; Sons, the company catalog
listed hundreds of items, ranging from hooks, snaps, buttons, pins
and needles of all shapes and sizes to a see-through plastic
T-square ruler with slots that allowed the user to make precise
markings before cutting fabric.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers like J.C. Penney and Sears, Roebuck mounted lavish
displays of Dritz products in their stores. Among the most popular
were the seam ripper, which made quick work of unwanted stitches
and was much safer to use than a razor blade, and the electric
scissors, an egg-shaped instrument that fit snugly in the palm of
the hand. The scissors sold for $9.95 in 1953.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of his life, Dritz told members of his family
that to promote sales of a type of fastener he had first seen in
Britain, he coined the word ``zipper.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The scientific name was hookless fastener, but he knew that
term was awkward,'' said his wife, Dorothy. ``He said it made a
zipping sound and that's how he made up the name.''
</P>
<P>
   Others have also claimed to have named the zipper. No less a
figure than the industrialist B.F. Goodrich is credited with using
it for the Zipper Boots he sold in 1923, according to
``Extraordinary Origins of Everyday Things'' by Charles Panati
(Harper &AMP; Row, 1987).
</P>
<P>
   But it was Dritz who helped heighten the consumer appeal of the
zipper by making it of plastic and rust-proof metals and by
creating attractive packaging and displays.
</P>
<P>
   He promoted his business by introducing high school teachers of
home economics to new techniques and products _ from Dritz.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Leon Dritz was born on June 15, 1911, in New York City.
After graduating from Syracuse University, he joined the business
founded by his father, John Dritz, which was focused on the
production and sale of beaded handbags.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the family business included Dritz's brothers,
Lawrence, Eugene and Arthur. Together, they brought an extensive
array of products to home sewers.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, Dritz served as president of the National Notion
Association, an industry trade organization, which sponsored the
semi-annual Notion and Novelty Market Show in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Dritz was president of the family business in the 1950s and
'60s. The company was sold when he retired. It is now owned by the
Prym Dritz Corp. of Spartanburg, S.C., a division of Prym, of
Stolberg, Germany.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, Dritz is survived by a son, James Dritz
of Armonk, N.Y.; three grandchildren, and three
great-grandchildren.

ROCHE CANCELS BOND OFFERING ON GENENTECH 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Roche Holding AG said Wednesday that it would
not proceed with a previously announced offering of bonds
convertible to 5.5 million shares in Genentech Inc., the
biotechnology company in which it holds a controlling stake..
</P>
<P>
   But Roche, based in Basel, Switzerland, said a planned offering
of 22 million shares of Genentech common stock would proceed as
planned. J.P. Morgan priced the offering at $143.50 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Piller, a spokesman for Roche, said the company wanted to
avoid conflicts between the equity and debt offerings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were aware that this could happen but we couldn't foresee
the impact, because that's always the result of the market
conditions and the market forces,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts noted that Genentech shares had dropped sharply since
the equity offering was announced earlier this month. In June,
Roche exercised an option to buy the 33 percent of Genentech it did
not already own for $82.50 a share. Since July, when Roche sold 18
percent of Genentech at $97 a share, Genentech shares have traded
as high as $179.50, only to drop by 20 percent since the secondary
offering was announced.
</P>
<P>
   ``They announced the sale of convertibles and shares and the
Genentech investor didn't like it so they drove the price down,''
said Sergio Traversa, an analyst with Mehta Partners. ``Investors
basically got scared of this huge amount of shares coming on the
market at once. At a certain point it was clear the amount Roche
was losing would not be made up for by the convertibles so they
pulled it,'' he said. ``If you look at the market reaction today,
it makes sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Genentech, based in South San Francisco, closed at
$143.8125, up $6.625, on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Leber, a Genentech spokeswoman, said the company had
received no guidance from Roche about the canceled offering.
</P>
<P>
   For Roche, the planned debt and equity offerings presented an
opportunity to raise cash while retaining control of Genentech. For
Genentech, offering additional equity to the public offered
investors additional liquidity, while strengthening the appearance
of the company as a quasi-independent entity. Having publicly
traded shares also helps Genentech attract and retain key
employees. The equity offering, if successful, will reduce Roche's
stake in Genentech to 65 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Genentech has been on a roll this year, driven by sales of new
drugs for the treatment of cancer. For the third quarter, exclusive
of special and recurring redemption-related charges, Genentech
earned $66.9 million, or 51 cents per diluted share, beating Wall
Street estimates by 12 cents, according to First Call/Thomson
Financial.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Genentech reported a loss of $62.8 million,
including the charges, compared to earnings of $63.4 million, or 49
cents per share, in the comparable period a year ago. Revenues grew
by 10 percent to $345.3 million from $313.9 million in the same
quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Genentech attributed the revenue growth primarily to sales of
Herceptin, which is used for the treatment of certain patients with
metastatic breast cancer, and Rituxan, used for the treatment of
certain patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

DOLE ENDS WHITE HOUSE BID, CITES BUSH MONEY MACHINE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Republican presidential field shrunk again
Wednesday as Elizabeth Dole abandoned her pioneering quest for the
White House because, she said, she was unable to compete with
George W. Bush's mighty money machine.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by Dole, who had been running a distant second to
Bush in most polls, is likely to further strengthen the Texas
governor's front-runner status as the 2000 primary season
approaches.
</P>
<P>
   However, political experts said they were uncertain if many of
the young, independent female voters that Dole drew to her rallies
will remain engaged in the contest.
</P>
<P>
   Although she declined to endorse any of her rivals or discuss
future plans, Dole's decision to bow out stoked speculation that
she may want to be Bush's running mate.
</P>
<P>
   In her announcement, Dole took a subtle dig at Bush by noting
that the emphasis on his war chest made it harder for her to get
her message out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line remains money,'' she told a roomful of
reporters at a Washington hotel. ``There (is a tendency to make)
money the message ... And people outside the Beltway don't really
understand why their enthusiasm and these big crowds isn't the
measure of success.''
</P>
<P>
   Dole's departure may boost the presidential campaign fortunes of
Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., a maverick lawmaker who appeals to
independents and who has already replaced Dole as Bush's major
threat in the first primary state of New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Her quitting also underscores what some experts believe is a
worrisome trend in presidential politics, where the need to raise
lots of cash early to compete in an increasingly front-loaded
primary season has forced many candidates out months before the
first votes are cast.
</P>
<P>
   Already the Republican field has dwindled from a dozen
candidates earlier this year to half that now. The remaining
contenders include Bush, McCain, millionaire magazine publisher
Steve Forbes, who is financing most of his own campaign;
conservative activists Gary Bauer, Alan Keyes and Utah Sen. Orrin
Hatch.
</P>
<P>
   Another former GOP candidate, conservative firebrand Pat
Buchanan, is expected to announce Monday that he will seek the
Reform Party nomination.
</P>
<P>
   A 63-year old Harvard Law School graduate who served in the
Reagan and Bush Cabinets, Dole enjoyed an initial burst of positive
media attention and voter interest last winter when she announced
she was leaving as head of the Red Cross to explore a presidential
bid.
</P>
<P>
   She had burnished her public image earlier with a polished
performance during the 1996 Republican convention where she roamed
the arena in talk-show like fashion touting the virtues of her
husband, GOP nominee Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
   As the novelty wore off over the spring and summer, her
candidacy could not gain traction. Political experts attributed it
to poor organization, lack of a compelling message and inability to
compete with Bush's unprecedented fund-raising. Even a strong third
place showing in the Iowa straw poll in August did not direct the
money to her campaign.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of September, Bush had raised $56 million compared
with Dole's $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Dole, who on the stump often spoke of her achievements in
overcoming gender barriers, said she did not believe that her
pulling out of the race would discourage other young women about
politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what we've done is pave the way for the person who
will be the first woman president,'' Dole said, adding that when
she addressed largely female crowds, ``it's almost as if you see
some women sitting up a little straighter because you're trying to
empower them to understand that they can do it; they can really
make a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   During her withdrawal speech, Dole praised her husband, the
former Senate Republican leader, who stood behind her as she spoke
and even appeared tearful. But Bob Dole had made public comments
that undermined his wife's efforts. He publicly raised doubts that
she could win and said he would contribute $1,000 to McCain's rival
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Others said that while Dole's complaints about fund-raising are
valid, she also must share some of the blame for failing to
capitalize on the initial burst of publicity.
</P>
<P>
   The experts said she was not prepared to set up the state
organizations needed to marshal volunteers and build support. A
demanding boss, she suffered from high staff turnover that included
the loss of her press secretary.
</P>
<P>
   A North Carolina native who has spent most of her adult years in
Washington, Dole rarely deviated from her well-scripted speeches.
</P>
<P>
   Her fall in fortunes in New Hampshire, the first primary state,
are particularly striking. According to a poll released Wednesday
by the American Research Group, Dole was garnering only 3 percent
of the primary vote, tying for fourth place with Keyes. Last
February, the poll showed Dole with 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   While Dole has frequently been mentioned as a possible running
mate for Bush, the Texas governor did not broach the issue at a
campaign appearance in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Bush called Dole ``a trailblazer. She is an inspiration for a
lot of women. She made a mark on the political process.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican political consultant Whit Ayres said he believed
Dole's supporters would split among Bush and McCain.

   NEW YORK _ Felix and Brenda Manglinong, newlyweds from
Sacramento, Calif., spread a Mets jersey between them Wednesday as
if examining a religious frock. Married on Saturday, they had flown
to New York this week with hopes of spending their honeymoon in a
frenzy of giddy borough-hopping. A Subway Series, they said, that's
how they wanted to spend the first days of their marriage, watching
the Mets face the Yankees in a battle for New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wouldn't have needed a hotel room, because we just would
have gone from stadium to stadium night by night,'' said
Manglinong, musing over their team's extra-inning elimination at
the hands of the Atlanta Braves on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Manglinongs, Californians with an almost inexplicable
fascination with the Mets, were still feeling a bit world-weary
Wednesday after suffering fandom's one-two punch.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves had finished the season for their favorite team (this
is a couple, after all, that has an oil painting of Darryl
Strawberry, in a Mets uniform, hanging in their bedroom). Their
ideal of a Subway Series-honeymoon had ended even as they prepared
to get in line and wait for tickets overnight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I brought a rain suit, an umbrella, heavy boots and a
thermos,'' Manglinong said. ``I would have stood outside Shea
Stadium as long as it took.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many a New York baseball fan, the Manglinongs found
themselves seeking commiseration, and so they lingered at the Mets
Club House Shop in Manhattan, where memorabilia and misery mixed in
equal measure as the rain drizzled outside. ``You can look at that
weather right now, and that pretty much describes how the Mets fan
feels,'' said Joey Torres, a cashier, as he tended to the wounded
wandering around the store.
</P>
<P>
   Big things had been lost, the fans in the shop said, big things
like a citywide celebration and a chance to get to the bottom of
whose baseball town this really is. ``Straight up, this would have
been the ultimate challenge,'' said Rafael Torres, 23, a Grand
Central Partnership security guard who ducked in with his partner
during his lunch break.
</P>
<P>
   Torres is a Yankees fan, an irretrievably partisan Yankees fan,
and he said he had dropped by the shop to buy a jersey for his
girlfriend, a Mets fan, who had refused to speak to him since
Atlanta won. His intentions started out good. But he had gravitated
toward a display of Yankees caps and he had begun to gloat.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was a Subway Series,'' he said, ``they all would have
found out that the world we live in is __.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A Yankee world,'' said Shekemia Napoleon, 25, his partner, who
also roots for you-know-who.
</P>
<P>
   The dispiriting realization that 1999 would not include the
ultimate Mets-Yankees showdown traveled far beyond this little
corner of the Mets' universe. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, a similarly
partisan Yankees fan, but one who can at least root for the Mets
when he has to, expressed disappointment at the Braves victory at a
dedication of a library in Central Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were virtually this close to it,'' the mayor said, holding
his thumb and index finger about an inch apart. ``Maybe we'll get
there next year. One of my unredeemed campaign promises is that we
would have a Subway Series.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Giuliani announced that a pep rally for the Yankees would
be held at 4:30 p.m. Thursday near the fountain in City Hall Park.
Back at the Mets Club House Shop, the security guards left without
a jersey, passing by Robert A. Katz, who stops in almost every day.
Katz, who described himself as ``acting like I'm 20 but I'm really
34'' was complaining bitterly that Yankees caps were for sale in
his sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe that George Steinbrenner would let this
happen, would let Mets hats in the Yankees Club House,'' he said,
sharply, to Joseph McGrath, the general manager.
</P>
<P>
   McGrath seemed not to mind. ``It's like the Hatfields and
McCoys,'' he said, after Katz wandered off.
</P>
<P>
   Katz, for his part, managed to find some solace in the loss: no
more late nights watching baseball, at least until next year.
``I'll get to bed at 10:30 and I'll get to see my wife and kids a
little more often,'' he said.

EDITORIAL: MRS. DOLE DEPARTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, Oct. 21:
</P>
<P>
   In the end, not even her brave stand on gun control, her swarm
of sorority sisters or her winning ways with large crowds could
save Elizabeth Dole's campaign for the Republican presidential
nomination. In the end, there simply was not enough money. As she
explained Wednesday in her graceful departure from the race, the
big bucks were elsewhere. Gov. George W. Bush of Texas has his $60
million campaign bankroll, and the publishing millionaire Steve
Forbes has the family fortune. At the present rate, their cash
advantage going into the primary season next year would be 80 to 1,
Mrs. Dole figured. ``I can handle 2 to 1 or even 10 to 1, but not
80 to 1,'' she told friends, supporters and the largest collection
of television cameras she had seen since she launched her campaign
nine months earlier.
</P>
<P>
   When candidates quit for lack of money, there are usually other
problems as well. In this case her helpmate, Bob Dole, gave
interviews hinting, most unhelpfully, that his wife could not win.
Still, Mrs. Dole departs sounding an important alarm about how
money shoves real debate under an expensive carpet of television
ads. As she put it, ``In the real America, it's more important to
raise issues than to raise funds.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Dole, the fifth Republican to drop out of the presidential
race, had one of the more impressive resumes in the field, having
served in two cabinet posts and a successful term as president of
the American Red Cross. Despite her lack of experience campaigning
for herself, as opposed to her husband, she did well with women.
That means the Republican nominee might consider her for the second
position on the ticket or other important jobs. Her statement hints
that she is not retiring from the fray to become one of the poor
spirits described by Theodore Roosevelt who ``live in the gray
twilight that knows not victory nor defeat.''
</P>
<P>
   More concretely for next year's early primaries, Mrs. Dole's
departure leaves an all-male contest that tightens the pressure on
its front-runner, Bush. Forbes will aim to his right, and Gary
Bauer to his far right. Meanwhile, Sen. John McCain of Arizona, who
has been gaining strength in early-primary states including his
own, could be an even more durable competitor. McCain offers an
interesting contrast in style and substance, with his deeper
knowledge of global issues and his strong views on campaign finance
reform. Like Mrs. Dole, voters can hope that the next rounds of the
campaign will include not merely the most expensive campaign ads
that fund-raising can buy but open debates on issues as well.

<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ When ``A Palestinian Girl'' opened at the Haifa
Theater in 1985, protests arose over the very title. On that basis
alone, some season ticket holders canceled their subscriptions.
Others packed the premiere and, as the curtain fell, exploded into
spontaneous debate over whether the subject matter itself was
subversive.
</P>
<P>
   Several years later, another play by the same writer, Yehoshua
Sobol, engendered an even stronger reaction. ``The Jerusalem
Syndrome'' was not meant as allegory. But it dealt with the revolt
of the Jews against the Romans at the time of the Second Temple,
and it opened at the start of the intifada, the Palestinian
uprising against Israel. Extreme right-wing groups stormed the
theater, threw stun grenades and provoked fistfights with audience
members.
</P>
<P>
   The play was forced to close early and Sobol to step down as the
artistic director of the Haifa Theater. Feeling bitter and
suffocated, Sobol flew to London for a few years of self-imposed
exile and turned his pen away from his homeland, to historic
figures like Baruch Spinoza, the 17th-century Dutch philosopher.
</P>
<P>
   Sobol, now 60, looks back on that era from the vantage point of
a very different one. Now he is concerned that a depressing
commercialism has overtaken the Israeli theatrical scene, and he
finds himself almost nostalgic for the days of intolerance.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was intense violence in the cultural arena, and it was
perhaps the darkest period for trying to choke the expression of
artists,'' he said. ``But for me the most exciting years were those
of very brutal reactions to some of my plays. Because then I knew
that the plays meant something, that they were of some
importance.''
</P>
<P>
   Many outsiders assume that Israeli artists still create and
perform in a hyperconflicted, even censorious, environment. They
assume that free expression is delimited by both religious
fundamentalists and the political right wing. They also imagine
that such conflict is a negative. But their assumptions have more
to do with the Israel of a decade ago than today.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, these misconceptions were reinforced by the
internationally publicized controversy surrounding the religious
right's objections to a piece by the Batsheva Dance Company of Tel
Aviv. In one passage, the performers, dressed in black garb
resembling that of Hasidic Jews, stripped to their briefs and
danced to a central song about Judaism from the Passover Haggadah.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let them wear gatkes,'' or long underwear (in Yiddish),
President Ezer Weizman of Israel had suggested, in mediation. The
company withdrew from a scheduled performance at Israel's
50th-anniversary extravaganza rather than edit its work by
political dictate.
</P>
<P>
   The political climate suddenly looked hostile to the arts, as
the world's eyes focused on Israel's half-century birthday party.
But in reality, the moment was anomalous. Such tensions have
actually dissipated over the last 10 years. As Israeli society has
grown more normalized, taboos have been broken and barriers
flattened.
</P>
<P>
   Tolerance has grown so much that like Sobol, some artists long
for the old days of rabid response to their work. Mere passionate
debate, when it arises, feels tepid. Everything else seems like
indifference.
</P>
<P>
   Batsheva included, most Israeli artists have long relished and
exploited the charged context in which they make their art. The
conflicts _ over religion, ethnicity and peace _ that dominate
Israeli life fueled their creativity, giving them a critical role
in the ever-evolving national debate over Israeli identity. The
swirling conversations about their plays, their films, their
protest songs and their art installations meant that what they did
mattered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Culture here has held a powerful role,'' said Amos Gitai, 48,
a film director. ``In the Western world, both the visual arts and
the cinema suffer from a lack of context. But in the Middle East,
we are anachronistic: things still count. Until very recently,
every work of art that tried to be something was treated as
something defining, something that strove to express what it is to
be Israeli.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, though, while the nation's identity remains in flux, most
artists say that their role has become more limited, provoking a
raging debate within the arts about how to adjust. Most agree that
political art has become less explosive as Israelis lose the
nervous feeling that they are living in a chronic state of
emergency. Confrontational points of view have become less
threatening, less heretical and ultimately less important.
</P>
<P>
   Still, artists point out, normal is relative. Jerusalem and Tel
Aviv are not New York or Paris, not with the ubiquitous armed
soldiers, police cars that travel everywhere with blue lights
flashing and security guards who examine every handbag entering the
local supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Here, normal means that a fragile social equilibrium has been
re-established four years after Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin was
assassinated by a right-wing Jewish extremist. It means that the
days when ``A Palestinian Girl'' was such a provocative title are
probably gone, and probably irreversibly, but it is impossible to
tell.
</P>
<P>
   Normal also means that the Sabbath wars have calmed down from
the days when ultra-Orthodox Jewish youths threw bottles to protest
Friday night screenings at the Cinematheque in Jerusalem. A
potentially destabilizing debate persists about whether Israel
should be a democracy or a theocracy, but, in the meantime, the
Israel Museum in Jerusalem calmly opens not only every Saturday but
on the Jewish New Year.
</P>
<P>
   Many artists are more than happy to adjust by relinquishing the
role that a fraught political context forced upon them. They long
to feel liberated from the yoke of being self-consciously Israeli
in all their work and of being ``meaningful'' in a political
context.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes `Macbeth' is just `Macbeth' and not a fable,'' said
Micah Lewensohn, 47, a theater director and also director of the
annual Israel Festival. He described a workshop of Israeli and
Palestinian directors with Peter Brook in 1996, in which everyone
expressed a similar yearning to put on plays for the sole reason
that they were beautiful or well-crafted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The feeling was that we had paid our political dues,''
Lewensohn said. ``Enough of this region. We all of us wanted to do
something out of love for the theater and not as compensation for
the fact that we didn't go into politics.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is no consensus within the arts worldthat it is
acceptable to relinquish a sense of engagement. Some artists insist
that their political work is not finished, contending that they
themselves, by pushing at the edges of the acceptable, helped lead
Israeli society down a road to greater tolerance.
</P>
<P>
   This feeling is particularly striking in the visual arts, where
conceptual mixed-media art rules. Years ago, Israeli artists began
exploring this approach to engage burning questions, say, about the
morality of the Israeli occupation in the West Bank. Many of those
artists see pure painting or drawing, with no text or message
attached, not only as a luxury but also as part of an alien
(European, Christian, old-fashioned) tradition.
</P>
<P>
   One classical painter, Eli Shamir, who concentrates on
straightforward portraits and Israeli landscapes, said that he was
effectively shunned by the art establishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Israeli culture is monolithic culture, very much a part of the
modern era, a kind of mandatory avant-garde,'' said Shamir, who
teaches drawing and painting at some of the finest art schools in
the United States but cannot get equivalent work in Israel. ``Many
people find what I do irritating.''
</P>
<P>
   James Snyder, an American who is director of the Israel Museum,
said, ``At this moment, if, like Eli Shamir, you decide to be a
representational painter, it's a political act.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the tensions in Israeli society, it took a conscious kind
of chutzpah when Gitai, a secular filmmaker, cast an Israeli-Arab
actor in the role of an ultra-Orthodox rabbi in his latest film,
``Kadosh.'' Later he wondered whether that was the key provocation,
the reason the Israeli film board, which was then controlled by the
National Religious Party, denied him financing in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kadosh,'' a haunting depiction of life inside an
ultra-Orthodox community in Jerusalem, tenderly renders rituals and
intimate portraits of religious characters. But it ultimately
paints a stultifying picture, particularly for women, of life in a
ghetto.
</P>
<P>
   The film board, which subsidizes nearly every Israeli film, told
Gitai, one of Israel's best-known directors, that it was turning
him down ``on artistic grounds.'' Then, earlier this year, after
the Cannes Film Festival selected ``Kadosh'' as the first Israeli
film ever to be shown there, the film board reconsidered the film's
artistry. And it retroactively awarded Gitai nearly half the film's
$1.3 million budget.
</P>
<P>
   Were they originally motivated by political concerns? It is
entirely possible that the board really didn't like the movie in
the first place, since political intrusions into the creative
process are uncommon here. The censorship board for theatrical
works was abolished a decade ago, after contributing to the success
of several banned works that refused to close.
</P>
<P>
   But what happened with ``Kadosh'' and with the Batsheva Dance
Company did come at a time when internal social divisions were
exacerbated. The country was moving toward a celebration of its
50th birthday, three years after the Rabin assassination ripped it
apart. Benjamin Netanyahu led a right-wing government in which the
ultra-Orthodox wielded particular power.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions generally escalate here anyway when an artist is
selected to represent Israel. Also in 1998, for instance, a small
scandal erupted _ and fizzled _ when Dana International, a
transsexual diva, won the Eurovision pop music contest on behalf of
the Jewish homeland. The rabbis weren't thrilled, although many
Israelis considered it a weird kind of post-Zionist accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Anaphase,'' the full-length Batsheva piece, was scrutinized
after it was chosen as a featured work of art for Israel's
official, nationally televised birthday party. In that context,
some found it unnecessarily offensive to religious Israelis. Others
_ especially after the Chief Rabbi of Israel warned that those who
did not condemn Batsheva's ``forbidden act'' would bring upon
themselves ``suffering, and even death'' _ wondered if what had
transpired portended a wave of repression.
</P>
<P>
   But Batsheva's state subsidy of over $1 million a year was never
touched, and in Tel Aviv, performances of ``Anaphase'' eventually
went on unedited. So the moment had faded into a cautionary tale by
the time Ehud Barak, a dovish hawk who preaches unity, was elected
prime minister in May, putting secular liberals back in charge of
the ministries that finance culture.
</P>
<P>
   Partly crediting themselves, Israeli artists say tolerance has
grown nearly continuously over the last 10 years, with a steady
movement toward greater freedom of expression on the sensitive
subjects for their society: the Israeli-Arab relationship,
militarism, religion and the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   In the journey toward tolerance, there have been dozens of
battles. Hanoch Levin, a leading Israeli playwright who died this
year, fought some of the crucial ones. Starting in the late 1960s,
he began defying the censors with works that skewered Israeli
mores, subversively mocking its militarist pride, its political
leaders and its very self-image.
</P>
<P>
   By the mid-1990s, confrontational art was almost de rigueur but
still powerful. Three years before the brouhaha over ``Anaphase,''
for instance, at the opening of the Israel Festival in 1995, the
Batsheva Company dancers sat with their backs to a capacity
audience that included Rabin. They appeared to be simulating
masturbation until they turned to reveal that they were cleaning
their army-issued guns.
</P>
<P>
   It was a startling enough image to make the audience gasp.
Rabin, a peacemaker but former general, seemed palpably
uncomfortable. But the only action he took was to shift in his
seat.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, a few years later, two provocative exhibits at the
Israel Museum played with the Holocaust era in a way that many
Israelis found disturbing. ``To Live and Die as Eva Braun,'' an
installation by Roi Rosen, dealt with Hitler's mistress; a piece by
Ran Katzir transformed Nazi propaganda into children's coloring
books. On the radio, Holocaust survivors protested that a line had
been crossed. But both shows completed their full runs.
</P>
<P>
   The days when theaters were stormed for presenting Palestinians
sympathetically or Israelis critically are long gone. Now it is
fashionable to collaborate with Palestinian artists and, as the
Cameri Theater in Tel Aviv does, to invite Palestinian teen-agers
to Israel for special productions in Arabic.
</P>
<P>
   Early this month, for the first time ever, a Palestinian
director's movie _ ``A Chronicle of Disappearance,'' by Iliya
Suleiman _ was selected as the best Israeli film of the year by
Israeli critics. If anything, the resistance comes from abroad:
Lewensohn, the director, cannot persuade Muslim musical stars to
perform at the Israel Festival; they are certain they will lose
their audience.
</P>
<P>
   The Parisians expressed initial concern when Dani Karavan, a
world-renowned environmental sculptor, chose to construct ``Peace
Sukkah'' for his contribution to a current exhibit on the
Champs-Elysees. It seemed destined to offend several parties at
once: religious Jews, right-wing Israelis and anti-peace
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Karavan went ahead anyway and constructed a traditional
religious tabernacle, like those built all over Israel during the
fall harvest festival, but subverted it to a political message. He
centered in it an olive tree and topped it with handmade Israeli
and Palestinian flags.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the work would be too politically controversial for
Israel, Karavan laughed and recalled his last exhibit in his
homeland, two years ago at the Museum of Israeli Art in Ramat Gan.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most of his large-scale work, which espouses peace and
tolerance in general terms, this was an angry exhibit of political
art directed at the Netanyahu government. Karavan took an olive
tree, hung it upside down by the roots and called it Har Homa, for
the housing project outside Jerusalem that had stopped the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
   He shot a bullet hole through a sabra, the prickly cactus that
is emblematic of Israel, and called it ``Nature Morte.'' He printed
the Declaration of Independence of Israel with the sections about
peace and relations with the Arabs written upside down.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very strange,'' he said. ``I was afraid it would have
demonstrations. My wife wanted us to change our phone number. The
director of the museum said he would be fired. But he's still there
and we still have the same telephone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It went very calm,'' Karavan continued. ``If it had been in
the street, maybe they would have tried to destroy it, but it was
in a museum. It was art, and at this moment, art is not so
influential.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, he continues to work from the heart, even if it
means erecting giant projects in the desert that few will travel to
see. One of his latest, ``Path to Peace,'' is what he calls a
``border sculpture.'' It consists of 108 columns, forged from
ancient stone and inscribed with the word ``peace'' in many
languages, that form a path through Negev to the border with Egypt
at Nitzana.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Karavan's ambition is to find an Egyptian sculptor who will
continue the path on the other side, but so far he has not found
anyone ``brave enough,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   From the early, pioneering days, even before the state was born,
there was an effort to forge a positive national identity through
culture, starting with the very revival of the Hebrew language and
then with imagery in painting and lyrics in songs that celebrated
Zionism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically, our traditions are a bit Soviet,'' Lewensohn,
the director, said.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was to use state subsidies to help create a unified
cultural identity, not in a melting pot but, as it was said, in a
pressure cooker. That had both political and ethnic ramifications.
</P>
<P>
   It took a long time before the state, with its interest in
nation-building, was willing to finance protest art or experimental
art. But the ethnic was considered political, too. For despite the
huge influx of Sephardic Jews from the Middle East and Northern
Africa, the unified culture identity was to be European, or
Ashkenazic.
</P>
<P>
   Western and symphonic traditions prevailed in music, for
instance; even today there are at least 11 state-financed symphony
and chamber orchestras in a country of six million people.
</P>
<P>
   Until about 10 years ago, Middle Eastern music was sold mainly
at the central bus station in Tel Aviv, on cassette racks.
Mainstream pop music was very nationalist and saccharine and never
featured any instrument as naturally regional as an oud (a sort of
Middle Eastern lute). Now, Eastern and hybrid East-West music
dominate the pop charts, and protest rock is as commonplace as
house music, rap and even salsa in Hebrew.
</P>
<P>
   By now the so-called Kulturkampf has many battlefields. Israeli
society is intensely fragmented. Not only are there tensions
between doves and hawks and secular and religious Jews, but also
between Ashkenazim and Sephardim, between Moroccan immigrants and
Russian immigrants, and, of course, between Jews and Arabs.
</P>
<P>
   Many older Israelis fret that in the post-Zionist era an
identifiable Israeli art, even if it is the confrontational
conceptual work of the multimedia artists, will disappear.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is concern that the segmentation of society is
overpowering the shared culture and that genuinely shared
achievement is being discredited as hegemonic,'' wrote Elihu Katz,
a communications professor in a new comprehensive study of Israeli
culture policy for the Beracha Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, individual populations _ the ultra-Orthodox, the
Russians and the Israeli Arabs, for instance _ are starting to
generate a self-enclosed cultural repertory that has no desire to
go mainstream. But many artists make a point of extending
themselves, if only for commercial reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The need for wider commercial success is particularly pressing
in a small country where an appeal to a fragment of the population
can rarely be self-sustaining.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the cross-fertilization can be dizzying. Zehava Ben, a
popular Eastern-style singer, not only plays to ethnically mixed
crowds but to Palestinians in Nablus. Fishy HaGadol, or Fishy the
Big, a Tel Aviv rapper whose real name is Adam Levinzon, is a
descendant of a leading Sephardic rabbi; he considers himself a
Black Panther and honed his craft at a club called Soweto in Tel
Aviv.
</P>
<P>
   Tofaa, an Orthodox, all-woman rock-pop-blues-and-klezmer band,
attracts both religious and secular audiences _ but only women,
since they are proscribed from singing to men by religious law.
</P>
<P>
   Against this backdrop, it is no wonder, then, that in the nexus
between culture and politics, mainstream artists feel that many of
the battles have been fought and won and are now passe. Some think
that the commercial battles loom ahead, especially if state
financing shrinks as feared. Playwrights and filmmakers, in
particular, are concerned that Israeli producers, their eyes on the
box-office receipts, are growing increasingly reluctant to take
chances.
</P>
<P>
   In the last couple of years, two works by serious playwrights
that dealt with Rabin's killing were rejected by producers here and
had to go abroad to find audiences. What chilled the playwrights is
that this time, reflecting the new era, the rejections were not
ideological but commercial. The plays were too heavy, and the
subject matter too wearisome for audiences who want some diversion,
they were told.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the current theater fare is light or melodramatic or a
kind of particularly Israeli docudrama. A mean-spirited joke in
drama circles concerns a terrible car crash on the Haifa-Tel Aviv
highway. Immediately, screaming ambulances appear on the scene _
joined in short order by the resident director of a leading
theater, hungry for new material to be converted into an
insta-play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see anything really radical or biting done nowadays in
Israel,'' Sobol said glumly. But then he perked up. ``Great
difficulties will arise when Israeli writers and playwrights start
a deep exploration of what we did during those decades of
occupation, how it affected them and how it affected us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then,'' he said hopefully, ``it will probably become
controversial again.''

EDITORIAL: INDONESIA'S PRESIDENTIAL SURPRISE 
 
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, Oct. 21:
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia's new democratic era got off to a wobbly but
encouraging start Wednesday with the national assembly's unexpected
choice of Abdurrahman Wahid, the leader of a moderate Muslim civic
organization, as president of the world's fourth most populous
nation. Wahid is respected for his personal integrity and strong
support of human rights. But he is frail after a recent stroke and
has had limited experience with the economic issues that now
require urgent attention.
</P>
<P>
   Until this week, few had imagined that Wahid, whose party ran a
poor third in parliamentary elections in June, would become
president. The final choice was made by the national assembly,
composed of elected and appointed members, not by the voters
themselves. This flawed system should be reformed. But even with
its defects, it was a big improvement over past elections in which
only a single candidate was allowed to run for president.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid must now win over supporters of the candidate whose party
resoundingly won those June elections, Megawati Sukarnoputri.
Thousands of her backers took to the streets Wednesday in violent
protest. To her credit, Megawati urged the nation to rally behind
Wahid, as did the outgoing president, B.J. Habibie, who had also
been a leading contender until he dropped out just hours before the
assembly vote.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid will need to assert firm civilian control over the army
and find new ways of knitting together Indonesia's sprawling
archipelago without reliance on repressive force. He must also
clean up and revive an economy that has been devastated by decades
of officially countenanced corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Once economic changes are under way, the International Monetary
Fund can generously help this new democracy recover its economic
balance. The United States, whose past relations with Indonesia
have revolved too much around military-to-military ties, needs to
provide aid to civilian groups that want to play an active part in
civic life.
</P>
<P>
   For all the challenges that lie ahead, it is important to
recognize the remarkable progress Indonesia has made. After a
half-century of authoritarian and corrupt leaders, it can now move
toward meaningful democracy.

 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
They're brothers who will be playing on the same field for the last
time.
<TEXT>
<P>
   TCU senior punter/receiver Royce Huffman and Rice redshirt
freshman linebacker Scott Huffman _ both from Elkins _ could
literally run into each other Saturday when the Horned Frogs and
Owls meet at Rice Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know who our parents will be for,'' said Royce. ``They
might be fair-weather fans, rooting for whoever does well. I think
the main thing is that they want to see us both do well.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Scott: ``We are just going to go out there and compete with
each other and see which team comes out on top.''
</P>
<P>
   The Huffmans aside, Saturday's game is more than a sibling
rivalry.
</P>
<P>
   Rice and TCU have long been like brethren, sharing the same
conference affiliation for decades. Rice was an original member of
the Southwest Conference in 1915, and TCU joined in 1923. Both went
to the Western Athletic Conference four years ago after the breakup
of the SWC.
</P>
<P>
   Now, TCU is leaving the WAC for Conference USA. Some interpret
that to mean TCU thinks it is better than Rice and the rest of the
WAC.
</P>
<P>
   TCU is scheduled to join C-USA after the 2000-2001 academic
year, but WAC officials say privately they want to force the Frogs
out earlier. Whether the conference can do that is unclear, but
regardless, Saturday's game will be the last between the schools in
Houston in the foreseeable future. Neither school has immediate
plans to schedule the other once TCU bolts.
</P>
<P>
   With both teams in the thick of the WAC championship hunt _ Rice
is 3-0 and TCU 2-1 in league play _ Saturday's game is probably the
most important between them since the 1950s. But there will be much
to prove on other levels as well.
</P>
<P>
   Rice has a three-game win streak in the series, and its
fourth-year seniors have a chance to go out perfect against the
Horned Frogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to go 4-0,'' said senior quarterback Chad Richardson,
``and this is going to be the hardest year to do it. They were down
the first two years we played them. Last year was hard because they
were good, and this year will be tougher.''
</P>
<P>
   TCU, obviously, wants to reverse the trend. As a fifth-year
senior, Royce Huffman was with the Frogs the last time they beat
Rice (33-28 in 1995). ``There are only four, maybe five, of us on
the team who have beaten Rice,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Because they have won the last three meetings in the series, the
Owls still are burning over the fact most preseason forecasts had
TCU as the better team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's got an opinion,'' Rice coach Ken Hatfield said.
``I don't worry about what you think. I worry about how well we
play against them on Saturday. That is my main concern.''
</P>
<P>
   A lot of the preseason thinking took into account TCU's win over
Southern California in last year's Sun Bowl. Rice officials chide
TCU by noting its fans can't seem to go 50 words into a
conversation without the words Sun and Bowl coming up.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Horned Frogs could counter that Rice is just
jealous, since ``Bluebonnet Bowl'' has lost some of its luster
since the Owls made their last postseason appearance in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   Rice feels it was lied to by TCU. When Rice officials called to
ask if the Horned Frogs were pursuing C-USA membership instead of
emphasizing their five-year commitment to the WAC, TCU officials
said no. As it turned out, the answer was yes. ``That's not the way
we do business,'' said Rice president Malcolm Gillis.
</P>
<P>
   The teams pit similar strengths against each other. Both have
superior running games and quality defenses. They rank 1-2 in the
WAC in rushing offense, scoring defense, total defense and rushing
defense.
</P>
<P>
   The Owls bring the momentum of a four-game win streak and are
playing at home, where they have won 12 of their 13 WAC games. A
fifth straight win would put them in the catbird seat for the Las
Vegas Bowl bid extended to the WAC champion. Hawaii, Fresno State
and Texas-El Paso, which like TCU have one conference loss, will be
watching with interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everyone in the league will be for us,'' Royce Huffman
said. ``Rice is undefeated in league play. If we win, then we level
the playing field for the other teams. However, it's still early to
say this makes the season, because all games are important.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past three years, Rice has been in the league chase
through November. Had the Owls defeated Air Force in Colorado
Springs last year, they would have advanced to the WAC championship
game as Mountain Division champions. Instead, the Owls lost a 22-16
heartbreaker.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Rice would have won the Mountain title if not for a
31-14 loss at Utah. And in 1996, a 49-0 loss at Brigham Young took
the Owls off the title track.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Hatfield and TCU coach Dennis Franchione don't want to
put too much emphasis on this week's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe if we win this game, we talk about winning the league
more,'' Franchione said. ``But as of yet, we have not played
ourselves into position to talk about the league chase.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice admits the grudge factor against TCU is not as strong as it
was against Baylor and Texas Tech, who surprised the Owls by
bolting from the Southwest Conference to the Big 12 along with
Texas and Texas A&AMP;M, two schools the Owls knew were gone.
</P>
<P>
   Nor are there the same ugly feelings Rice officials held toward
Colorado State, whose president, Al Yates, organized the departure
from the WAC of the eight teams that formed the Mountain West
Conference. There was dancing in the streets of West U. last year
when Rice played its best game in years to slap the Rams 35-23 at
Rice Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   But as Saturday inches closer, Rice's players, coaches and
administrators might at least find some of their dislike for the
Horned Frogs seething a little.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Royce Huffman, who left his minor-league baseball team
early last summer to once again be a part of TCU's football team,
said it best when he talked about playing his brother in what he
knew would be their last meeting. He wants to be able to say he
bested him.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game had a little bit more meaning for me to come back to
TCU and play because I wanted to play against my brother,'' Royce
said. ``We can talk about it for the rest of our lives. Whoever
wins this ballgame will have bragging rights for the rest of his
life.''

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, Oct. 21:
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Party is being pulled in contradictory directions
on the question of how to close the school performance gap between
affluent white children and poor minority children. Progressive
Republican reformers have seen that school districts tend to ignore
the poorest, least prepared students unless pressured from above.
But the Republican leadership in Congress views federal pressure as
evil, even when it is applied on behalf of the nation's most
vulnerable children.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans in Texas, led by Gov. George W. Bush, have seen
their state make impressive progress in closing the achievement gap
between the affluent and the poor, mainly by targeting its effort
on poor students and penalizing schools that fail to meet
improvement goals for  &UR; all  &LR; of their students. Even so, Republicans
in Congress have consistently backed legislation that would
eliminate the targeting mechanisms under Title I, the federal
funding stream that was developed in order to supplement
instruction for the nation's poorest students.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called ``straight A's'' bill, for example, would harm
America's poor, despite its bright and shiny name. The GOP
leadership argues that the bill would give the states
``flexibility'' in how they spend federal money. But the bill would
allow legislatures to rewrite the distribution formula, shifting
the money around at will _ even taking it away from poor schools.
The possibility that federal education dollars targeted at the poor
would become subject to political horse-trading at the state level
has caused even the National Governors' Association to oppose this
plan.
</P>
<P>
   The duplicitously named bill is an attempt to undermine HR-2,
the sensible bipartisan measure that would require states that
accept Title I money to improve instruction for the poorest
students and commit to narrowing the achievement gap. That is the
goal to support.

EDITORIAL: SELLING RUSSIA ON MISSILE DEFENSE 
 
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, Oct. 21: &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Russia has made it clear that it does not like American
proposals to renegotiate the 27-year-old Antiballistic Missile
Treaty in order to permit America to build defenses against nuclear
attacks from unpredictable nations like North Korea. Moscow has
even rebuffed Washington's offer to help Russia create its own
missile defense by financing a new radar system in Siberia. But
Russia's current resistance may be a bargaining ploy. America
should keep trying to negotiate mutually agreeable modifications to
the treaty. What Washington must not do is abandon the treaty in
frustration if such revisions prove beyond immediate reach.
</P>
<P>
   The ABM treaty has been an essential component of arms control
understandings between Washington and Moscow since the Nixon
administration. It has effectively precluded most defensive missile
systems on the grounds that they would encourage the development of
increasingly powerful offensive weapons to penetrate them. But the
Clinton administration believes that it is necessary to update the
treaty to guard against the North Koreas of this world, and that
this can be done without setting off a destructive and costly new
arms race. The Russians have agreed to listen to the
administration's proposals, but have made it clear that they do not
like what they have heard so far and have warned that American
abandonment of the treaty could put all other arms control
agreements at risk.
</P>
<P>
   Under most circumstances, fiddling with the ABM treaty would not
be a good idea. The biggest potential threat to America comes from
established nuclear powers like Russia and China, not smaller ones
like North Korea. Existing arms control agreements, like the 1972
treaty, have a good record of managing these threats. But the
administration makes a plausible case, and its proposal ought to be
the basis for further discussions.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's concept of a limited missile defense would not
require Russia or China to build more missiles to penetrate the new
American shield. Ambitious missile defense systems that could
provide effective coverage against Russia's thousands of missiles
are well beyond the reach of existing technology. But a limited
system would also serve Moscow's interest, since Russian territory
is even more exposed than America to attack from rogue states.
Still, Washington should not go ahead with a defensive system until
the technology is more certain and the negotiations with Moscow
have reached a satisfactory conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   The interest both sides share in countering the threat from
rogue states suggests that with good-faith negotiation, agreement
on carefully drawn changes in the ABM treaty may eventually come to
pass. With a new Russian government possible after next year's
elections, Washington should continue negotiating with Moscow in an
effort to find mutually acceptable revisions, and defer any thought
of renouncing the treaty.

`THE WATER ENGINE': AT THE 1934 WORLD'S FAIR, SPEAKING THE WRONG
LANGUAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes are at end of review.) 
(mk) 
 By BEN BRANTLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Charles Lang, the clear-speaking inventor hero of
David Mamet's pithy fable of a play, ``The Water Engine,'' which
has been given a befittingly lucid revival by the Atlantic Theater
Company, is a man uncontaminated by the pollutions of contemporary
English.
</P>
<P>
   He talks in simple, declarative sentences that are heavy on
monosyllables. As he carefully places one word before the other,
avoiding slang, hyperbole and indirection, he suggests the verbal
equivalent of a mountaineer walking a straight line on a high,
narrow ledge.
</P>
<P>
   In most fictive worlds, people who talk like Charles are usually
the victims of lobotomy, brainwashing or hypnosis. In Mamet's
world, they are more likely to represent an elemental purity, which
can translate into either idealism or brutal primitivism. In either
case, they're children in a land of conniving grown-ups. And poor
Charles, living in the sea of fancy, self-congratulatory elocution
that surrounds the Chicago World's Fair in 1934, is clearly a
doomed soul.
</P>
<P>
   Language is fate in the dramas of David Mamet, a key not just to
character but to chances of survival, something especially evident
in his short, elliptical morality plays of urban life. Having done
brilliantly by one of those plays, ``Edmond,'' several years ago,
the Atlantic Theater Company (of which Mamet is a founder) has now
taken on ``The Water Engine'' as the opening production of a season
devoted to the playwright.
</P>
<P>
   It's a smart choice, in many ways. ``The Water Engine'' was
first conceived as a radio play, and most of its subsequent
stagings (which included a run on Broadway in 1978) have retained
the central conceit of a work intended as much to be heard as seen,
blurring the lines between genres. This puts the emphasis on
listening as an active, rather than passive, process, which is
always essential in approaching this dramatist. And the
diagrammatic quality of ``The Water Engine'' serves as something of
a primer for Mamet's murkier plays.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is possible to be too clear and careful in the
theater, and this incarnation of ``The Water Engine,'' directed by
Karen Kohlhaas, is suffused with an air of caution that keeps the
evening from ever rising above room temperature. As designed by
Walt Spangler (sets), Rick Gradone (costumes) and Robert Perry
(lighting), it is an exceptionally handsome production. Yet it only
rarely creates that electric friction, the sense of words' rubbing
fiercely against each other, that sets off such memorable sparks in
the best of Mamet productions.
</P>
<P>
   There is a feeling that the talented actors (many of them Mamet
veterans) are reciting their lines as though they were reading
sheet music on which pauses and inflections are carefully noted.
Now this may conform to Mamet's own published theories about
acting, which are basically of the ``just-say-the-words'' sort, but
it makes the pleasures of this production more academic than
emotional. It also makes the none-too-subtle thematic ironies of
``The Water Engine'' fall more heavily than need be.
</P>
<P>
   The engine of the title is the invention of Charles (Steven
Goldstein), a contraption that runs on basic water. How appropriate
that Charles should have made his discovery in the year of the
World's Fair, a celebration of science and progress.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as Charles begins to deal with a pair of slick-tongued
lawyers (Peter Jacobson and Jordan Lage) who claim to represent his
best interests, it becomes obvious that the organic water engine is
actually a threat to the status quo of official Science and
Progress, and their corporate embodiments. Charles and his equally
idealistic sister, Rita (Mary McCann), become innocents in
jeopardy, and the play soon acquires the tone of a radio suspense
thriller.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, this production never picks up those rhythms of
suspense, a surprise given Ms. Kohlhaas' wonderfully energetic
staging of Harold Pinter's ``Hothouse'' last season. The show
smoothly orchestrates disparate voices into a symphony of
counterpoints, from the grandiloquence of a guide in the fair's
Hall of Science (Jacobson) to the contrastingly superstitious
admonitions of a chain letter (spoken by Kelly Maurer).
</P>
<P>
   But it keeps you at an unengaged distance, despite winningly
unctuous performances from Lage and Jacobson, and an affecting (and
expertly lighted) moment from Goldstein, in which Charles visits
his own Gethsemane of doubts.
</P>
<P>
   While the themes of corruption and Darwinian struggle so
abundant in Mamet's work are sharply sounded here, so is a more
poignant and empathetic note, one that the playwright explored most
deeply in the autobiographical ``The Old Neighborhood.'' This is
the idea, which the very notion of the radio play picks up on, of
the fumbling ways in which people grasp for connection, form and
explanations in life.
</P>
<P>
   This is also the subject of ``Mr. Happiness,'' the evening's
brief curtain raiser, in which a radio problem solver (Bob Balaban)
reads letters from assorted distressed listeners and offers advice.
Balaban wisely avoids the temptations of canned glibness,
presenting Mr. Happiness as a simple, pious man who has come to
accept the culture's prevailing platitudes as gospel.
</P>
<P>
   Balaban occasionally falls prey to mechanical
self-consciousness, like someone following an orchestra conductor's
baton, that is the evening's dominant danger. Presumably, both he
and the ensemble of ``The Water Engine'' will melt a bit more into
their roles as the run continues.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, there is absolutely nothing to fault in the
technical execution of the production. Andrew Keister has done
wonders in making standard radio sound effects seem like part of a
natural reality. And Spangler and Perry make marvelous use of the
play of repeated shadows, of both words on signs and technological
images, against the gleaming chrome of the set. In fact, as it
stands, ``The Water Engine'' is more of a thrill for the eye than
the ear, which is surely a first in a Mamet production.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Jonathan Winters was awarded the Mark Twain Prize
for humor by the Kennedy Center Center for the Performing Arts on
Wednesday night, getting praise from contemporaries like Steve
Allen and Sid Caesar, who starred with him in television situation
comedies, as well as from younger proteges, including Bonnie Hunt
and Robin Williams.
</P>
<P>
   It was the kind of show in which a star was honored and all of
those singing praise performed their own routines. Caesar, for
example, spoke in the fractured foreign-language gibberish that he
perfected when he was a star in the early days of television.
</P>
<P>
   With Allen as his straight man, Caesar spoke in an unknown
French dialect in which some of the few discernable words were
Voltaire, Victor Hugo and Louis Pasteur. Similar injustice was
visited upon German (some words were Richard Wagner and Lily
Marlene), Italian (Leonardo da Vinci and Enrico Fermi) and ersatz
Japanese (Datsun and Toyota).
</P>
<P>
   Another comic, Robert Wuhl, put Winters on his all-star baseball
team of comedians, in which, he said, batting cleanup were ``the
Three Stooges _ Buchanan, Trump and Beatty.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams picked up the political theme, saying Winters should
seek the White House because with his gift of impersonation, ``Not
only will he be president, he'll be the whole Cabinet.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Winters prepared for the event on Wednesday afternoon
with a discussion in which it was difficult to separate the serious
from his improvisational wit.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a true story,'' he began, an introduction that made
the listener wonder if it really was, and he went on to tell about

   Winters, who will be 74 next month, made most of his movies
before actors were able to demand multimillion-dollar fees.
Williams gets $20 million for a movie, Winters said. So he said he
told a studio executive, ``If Robin says I'm his idol, shouldn't
you give me $1 million more than that?''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't work, and Winters said that for his movie work, which
includes ``It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World,'' his biggest pay was
$130,000.
</P>
<P>
   Winters is the second winner of the Kennedy Center Prize for
comedy; Richard Pryor won the first award last year. Wednesday
night's tribute to Winters was taped for broadcast on Jan. 12,
2000, on the Comedy Central cable network.

CLASSIC OLYMPIO DOESN'T DISAPPOINT

<P>
   ARCADIA, Calif. _ Back after breaking her maiden, Classic
Olympio showed Wednesday why she was the favorite in Wednesday's
$75,000 Anoakia Stakes at Santa Anita.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a late run from second choice She's Classy, Classic
Olympio stormed to her second win and paid $3.20, $2.20 and $2.20.
</P>
<P>
   Trained by Ron McAnally, Classic Olympio covered the 6 furlongs
in 1:09.70 with Alex Solis in the saddle.
</P>
<P>
   She's Classy, ridden by Victor Espinoza, paid $2.60 and $2.60.
Third was Bold Feat, with Corey Black up. Bold Feat paid $2.80.

   __ Big field expected: Saturday's $250,000 Grade II Oak Tree
Derby could draw a large field of 3-year-olds. Part of the reason
is the cancellation of last weekend's Ascot Handicap at Bay Meadows
in Northern California. The race was taken off the card when safety
concerns forced officials to close the Bay Meadows turf course.
</P>
<P>
   The race has not been rescheduled, so several Northern
California trainers are looking for a race that fits their
3-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   One of those trainers is Thomas R. Bell, who might run Good
Fellow Robin in the 1[-mile race. In his last local run, Good
Fellow Robin finished fourth in the Pomona Derby.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Pomona Derby, he really didn't handle the (Fairplex)
bullring,'' Bell said. ``He seemed a bit confused about the
dimensions of everything there.''
</P>
<P>
   Other probables for the Oak Tree Derby include Eagleton,
Fighting Falcon, Outstanding Hero, Prime Timber, Red Sea,
Rhapsodist, Super Quercus and Zanetti.
</P>
<P>
   __ Uncoupled: Look for two Bob Baffert-trained horses in
Friday's Sunny Slope Stakes. Just don't expect them to run as an
entry. Baffert will run Cameron Pass with Gary Stevens and Magical
Dragon with David Flores as an uncoupled entry in the $75,000
6-furlong test for 2-year-olds.

OHALETE STAYS IN LINEUP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ After Ife Ohalete committed a costly
personal-foul penalty against Notre Dame, USC flirted with the idea
of benching the strong safety this weekend and replacing him with
cornerback Kris Richard.
</P>
<P>
   The change would have also forced freshman Kevin Arbet to start
at cornerback in place of Richard against Pacific-10 Conference
leader Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday, Ohalete was told he had his starting job back and
the defense remained intact.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an alarm,'' Ohalete said of his temporary demotion.
``It's just to get my emotions under control. I can't be having
these stupid problems. The last couple of days I've grown up a
lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Ohalete's personal foul against Notre Dame's Bobby Brown on a
third-down play allowed the Irish to keep a drive alive and score a
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to keep the defensive lineup the same was a relief
to Richard, who wasn't keen on moving to safety six games into the
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad I'm staying in my own spot, but I was up for it,''
Richard said. ``I'm glad Ife's still in there. I wouldn't say it's
too late to make a change, but this is a big game. This is a
must-win game.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Steele sits: Linebacker Markus Steele will not start but will
play Saturday, after sitting out Tuesday's and Wednesday's
practices with torn tissue in his left shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   The injury will require surgery after the season but should not
force Steele to miss any games.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said sophomore Henry Wallace would probably start at
weakside linebacker, or possibly freshman Troy Polamalu.
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver Windrell Hayes re-aggravated his ankle injury but
is expected to be OK.
</P>
<P>
   __ Freshman mark: USC wide receiver Kareem Kelly's 26 catches is
already a USC freshman record, according to a spokesperson. Kelly
also needs five more yards to surpass R. Jay Soward's
freshman-record yardage total of 507 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   __ Where's the D? Stanford is ranked 110th in the country in
total defense, 104th in pass-efficiency defense and 98th in scoring
defense.
</P>
<P>
   But the Cardinal is vastly improved in run defense, where it was
ranked among the worst in the nation last season. It is currently
37th.

 By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Justice Department took extraordinary steps to
enhance the chances of clemency for a group of imprisoned Puerto
Rican nationalists after receiving regular expressions of interest
from the White House, according to documents released Wednesday. In
one instance, the department's top officials repeatedly urged the
prisoners' supporters in Congress to persuade them to fashion a
statement of repentance to help their chances of release.
</P>
<P>
   The documents released at a hearing by the Senate Judiciary
Committee also show that the Puerto Rican nationalists did not
apply for clemency personally, as is usually required, but
department officials processed an application anyway. Under
department regulations, a personal application is usually required
to start the process, because such a move is taken as a sign of
remorse for the criminal acts.
</P>
<P>
   The documents suggest that the prisoners did not apply for
clemency themselves as a symbolic demonstration of their political
credo that they have not accepted the authority of the U.S.
government. Department officials acknowledged in internal memos
that it was highly unusual even to consider clemency in cases in
which the prisoners themselves declined to file their own
applications.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton offered clemency to 16 of the prisoners on
Aug. 11 after supporters applied on their behalf. The prisoners
were convicted of crimes on behalf of the FALN, a militant Puerto
Rican independence group, more than two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   The details and sequence of events leading up to Clinton's
clemency offer have remained murky because the White House and
Justice Department have declined to release much information,
citing executive privilege. Because the Constitution explicitly
gives the president the sole authority to issue pardons,
administration lawyers have argued that the president's discussions
with subordinates over the issue of clemency for the Puerto Rican
prisoners is privileged and need not be disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   But the documents disclosed Wednesday give a partial picture of
the unusual way in which the issue was handled. Applications for
clemency are typically generated when a prisoner presses the issue.
In this case, it appears that the White House and Justice
Department were interested in keeping the issue of clemency alive
even after the department's pardon attorney recommended that
clemency be denied.
</P>
<P>
   A letter in July 1997 from Margaret C. Love, the pardon
attorney, to White House counsel Charles F.C. Ruff showed that she
recommended against clemency. But her successor, Roger Adams, filed
a second report this year that contained no explicit recommendation
for the president, as such reports usually do. but instead offered
Clinton a range of options, law-enforcement officials have said.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's documents show that Adams and Eric Holder, the
deputy attorney general, met with Democratic Reps. Luis Gutierrez
of Illinois, Jose Serrano and Nydia Velazquez, both of New York, on
Nov. 5, 1997, to discuss the case of the Puerto Rican inmates.
According to Adams' notes, Holder told the three members of
Congress that because the prisoners had not applied for clemency
themselves, this could be taken that they were not repentant and he
suggested that a statement expressing some remorse might help their
chances.
</P>
<P>
   On April 9, 1998, according to Adams' notes, he contacted a
staff aide to Gutierrez and said the department had not received
any statement of remorse. The notes show that Adams counseled the
staff aide as to how the statement should be worded for maximum
effect and he added that the department's new report would await
the statement.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the prisoners provided a long ambiguous statement,
with no explicit statement of regret. While some people had been
hurt, the statement said, ``innocent victims were on all sides.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, who is the Judiciary Committee
chairman, also noted that just a month after Clinton's clemency
offer, Attorney General Janet Reno said in a report that the
nationalist groups the prisoners had been aligned with posed an
``ongoing threat'' to national security.
</P>
<P>
   ``Factors which increase the present threat from these groups
include ... the impending release from prisons of members of these
groups jailed for prior violence,'' Reno wrote in the Justice
Department's Five Year Interagency Counterterrorism and Technology
Crime Plan published last month and made public at Wednesday's
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI and the federal prosecutors in Illinois and Connecticut,
where many of the convictions had been obtained, flatly recommended
that the president refuse clemency. After he did so over their
objections, Clinton was widely criticized by law enforcement
groups, families of the victims of some of the crimes committed by
the FALN and both Republican and Democratic members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton denied speculation that he had granted clemency to help
the candidacy of his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, a likely
Democratic candidate for the senate from New York, which has a
large Puerto Rican voting population.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont was the only Democrat to appear at
the hearing. After saying he was disturbed by the decision to grant
clemency but that it was Clinton's prerogative, Leahy departed
leaving the Republicans to take turns grilling the two Justice
Department witnesses, Holder and Adams.

ABC NOT REQUIRED TO PAY DAMAGES TO FOOD LION SUPERMARKET, APPEALS
COURT RULES 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: LEADS to clarify details of ruling in first 6 grafs, ADD
corporate background on Food Lion, combines takes.) 
 (js) 
 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A divided federal appeals court Wednesday threw out all but $2
of the damages that a jury had ordered ABC News to pay to the Food
Lion supermarket chain after it reported that the grocery chain
sold beef and other food that was tainted.
</P>
<P>
   In the majority opinion, a panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals, in Richmond, Va., wrote that Food Lion's attempt to win
a multimillion-dollar fraud verdict because two ABC employees had
lied their way into jobs in Food Lion stores was ``an end-run''
around First Amendment protections for journalists.
</P>
<P>
   In the case, a federal District Court jury in Greensboro, N.C.,
awarded the supermarket chain $5.5 million in 1997 after finding
that ABC had engaged in fraud. The case had been closely followed
by news organizations that feared that plaintiffs could win
crippling damage awards without having to prove that the news
reports in question were false or malicious.
</P>
<P>
   Specialists in media law said the ruling Wednesday could blunt
that line of legal attack by setting high constitutional hurdles
for plaintiffs whose lawsuits focus on journalists' newsgathering
techniques.
</P>
<P>
   The case was filed after the ABC program ``Primetime Live''
broadcast a report that Food Lion workers mixed out-of-date beef
along with new beef, bleached rank meat to remove its odor and
redated products. The report also included videotapes of the
chain's employees secretly made by ABC employees who had obtained
jobs at the chain.
</P>
<P>
   An earlier federal district court ruling had already struck down
most of the $5.5 million in damages awarded by the jury in the
fraud suit, but did so on narrow grounds that avoided First
Amendment issues. The $315,000 punitive damage award that the
district court had left standing was struck down by the appeals
court Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   With the appeals court's ruling only $2 of the original damage
award remains untouched. The jury awarded Food Lion $1 because the
journalists had trespassed on the supermarket chain's property and
$1 because they had breached their legal duty to be loyal to their
employer.
</P>
<P>
   David Westin, the president of ABC News who was the network's
general counsel when the lawsuit was filed, applauded the ruling,
which, he said, ``should help blunt'' an ``important and dangerous
shift.'' Instead of plaintiffs ``challenging what we said, through
libel and defamation, they are trying to get around through the
back door, attacking the process we used to get'' the information
used in news reports.
</P>
<P>
   Westin and several specialists in media law said that the high
hurdles faced by libel plaintiffs have led plaintiffs to attack not
the substance of news reports, but the sometimes questionable way
journalists gathered their information.
</P>
<P>
   Judge M. Blane Michael, author of the majority opinion, wrote,
``We are convinced that the media can do its important job
effectively without resorting to the commission of
run-of-the-mill'' breaches of the law.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd Abrams, a partner at the law firm of Cahill Gordon &AMP;
Reindel who is a well-known First Amendment specialist, said of the
case Wednesday: ``What people have tried to do is an end run around
the First Amendment protections that exist in libel law. This case
is a quintessential example. Food Lion didn't care at all that two
employees had false information on their applications for
employment. What they cared about was what ABC said about them.''
</P>
<P>
   Food Lion is a supermarket chain based in Salisbury, N.C., that
is a subsidiary of the Belgian company Etablissements Delhaize
Freres et Cie ``Le Lion.'' The American unit has more than 1,100
stores in 14 states, and has annual revenue of $10.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Food Lion issued a statement through its lawyer, Richard L.
Wyatt Jr., saying: ``We are disappointed that the 4th Circuit did
not affirm the decision in Food Lion's favor in its entirety.
However, the court did recognize that ABC's manipulative illegal
tactics caused unwarranted damage to our company and our
employees.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement continued, ``This is a complex legal area, and our
lawyers will review the court's decision and advise us of our
options.''
</P>
<P>
   The district court had also held that under the applicable state
laws in the case, ABC's reporters had defrauded Food Lion by their
actions. This fraud finding, however, was overturned by Wednesday's
appellate ruling.
</P>
<P>
   In a dissent, Judge Paul V. Niemeyer argued that the two ABC
journalists, Lynne Dale and Susan Barnett, ``applied to Food Lion
with the secret intent to obtain sensational and damaging evidence
to publish against Food Lion.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Niemeyer wrote, ``in seeking to `uncover'
practices, the ABC employees baited fellow employees to say and do
things that they knew would undermine Food Lion's standing
food-handling practices.'' He parted with his two colleagues by
saying that such actions gave the jury ``ample evidence'' to
conclude that ABC had committed common-law fraud, on which the
$315,000 damage award was based.
</P>
<P>
   One lawyer who filed briefs on Food Lion's behalf in the case,
but declined to be quoted by name, said Wednesday that the court's
ruling erred in not relying on a different set of legal precedents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Food Lion's claim was that we get damages for the illegally
obtained, even staged videotape, which is a very live issue,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But, as Food Lion's formal statement indicated, the lawyer said
the company needed time to decide if it would pursue this logic in
an appeal, either to the full circuit court or to the Supreme
Court.

STATUS QUO WINS ON TOBACCO, CAMPAIGN SPENDING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE WILSON  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (UNDATED) - On a visit to Lexington, Ky., last weekend, where I
lived for a decade and learned that betting on horses was not a
reliable investment strategy, the earthy aroma of burley tobacco
being trucked from the farms to the auction warehouses wafted
through town.
</P>
<P>
   I like the smell of freshly cured burley. Even though cigarette
smoke bothers me, the leaves have a rich, satisfying scent.
</P>
<P>
   For people who raise it, the crop also smells like money. Almost
half of Kentucky's agricultural income comes from the state's
45,000 tobacco farms. Thanks to a federal price-support program,
tobacco has long been America's most profitable crop. Legal crop,
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Something I read in the Lexington paper, however, didn't smell
so good. Tucked into the record $8.7 billion farm-relief bill
signed into law last week is $328 million for tobacco farmers. Why
such generosity? Because Congress bought the twisted argument that
the government ought to compensate them for falling cigarette
sales.
</P>
<P>
   One of the leading advocates for this gift was Kentucky's senior
senator, Republican Mitch McConnell. He contends that it's only
fair for tobacco farmers to get more federal money since their
incomes will be down as the result of a 29 percent quota cut
imposed this year because of declining demand.
</P>
<P>
   Quotas are set by the federal government to maintain a
supply-demand balance and keep the price of tobacco up. So the
tobacco farmers will get high prices from the quota cut and will
receive an extra $328 million to offset the lower quotas.
</P>
<P>
   This would be farfetched for any product, but it's nuts in the
case of tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government has no business enriching tobacco farmers
at a time when it's waging a war against smoking and suing tobacco
companies. And it shouldn't be tossing around millions to offset
free market forces. With demand for tobacco dropping sharply, many
farmers should start planting other crops. When the federal
government acts to prop up their incomes artificially, where's the
incentive?
</P>
<P>
   Rather than face up to the reality of changing times for
tobacco, politicians like McConnell work to preserve the status
quo, even when it takes your and my tax dollars.
</P>
<P>
   But McConnell's strongest efforts to keep the system unchanged
have been made as an opponent of campaign finance reform. He scored
another big victory Tuesday when his attacks on the McCain-Feingold
bill helped bury it in the Senate for the fourth straight year.
</P>
<P>
   McConnell cloaks his approval of the escalating millions poured
into political campaigns in the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spending is speech,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Those who want to impose limits on campaign contributions are
``trying to take away your right to speak. They want the speech
police,'' McConnell insists.
</P>
<P>
   That's a fat distortion, and he knows it. Reform proponents
don't want to curtail speech. To the contrary, they want a more
level playing field that allows opposing candidates a decent chance
to get their message out, rather than a system that lets big money
determine what voters hear.
</P>
<P>
   Under current finance laws, big contributions come with the
expectation that the favor will be repaid. Special interests thus
gain priority over the public interest.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians like McConnell resist reform for the plain reason
that the current system serves them well and makes unseating
incumbents extremely hard.
</P>
<P>
   The Kentucky senator sought to put John McCain on the spot last
week in the Senate for daring to say that big money has a
corrupting influence. Show us where the corruption is, McConnell
demanded.
</P>
<P>
   McCain resisted the temptation to point straight at McConnell.
Instead, he responded with an honest admission:
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us are tainted by the system, myself included.''
</P>
<P>
   McConnell's embrace of the First Amendment to give wealthy
special interests enormous influence over government is no less
offensive than Larry Flynt wrapping himself in it to defend his
pornography.
</P>
<P>
   The only difference is that Flynt doesn't have the power to
write the nation's laws. McConnell and the deep pockets making
six-figure campaign contributions do. &QL;

UCLA HAS LONG ROAD TO BOWL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ To qualify for a bowl game, UCLA must win three of
its final four games. To win three of its final four games, UCLA
must win at least one on the road.
</P>
<P>
   And that's a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to learn to win on the road,'' Bruins coach Bob Toledo
said. ``That's something we talk about.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins are 0-3 away from home entering Saturday's game at
Oregon State. (They also play USC in the Coliseum on Nov. 20.)
</P>
<P>
   UCLA lost at Ohio State and Stanford, but its worst road
experience came three weeks ago at Arizona State, where the Bruins
blew a 24-14 fourth-quarter lead and lost in the final minute.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo believes the lack of sideline support is the most
difficult aspect of road play. Because travel squads are limited to
60 players, there aren't many friendly faces when something goes
wrong and young players look to the bench. Two-thirds of UCLA's
travel squad is freshmen and sophomores.
</P>
<P>
   ``With an experienced team, I think they look more forward to
the challenge of, `It's us against the world,' '' Toledo said.
``Young teams are intimidated. Young teams have to learn to finish
games on the road. You've got to crank it up.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Mr. Efficient: The Bruins keep stats on every aspect of the
game, including tackles per play. According to defensive
coordinator Bob Field, middle linebacker Robert Thomas leads the
team with one tackle every 8.6 plays.
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Tony White is second (10.6), followed by safety Joey
Strycula (12.4), linebacker Ali Abdul Azziz (12.7) and freshman
linebacker Marcus Reese (12.7).
</P>
<P>
   ``Linebackers should have more tackles,'' Field said. ``Robert
has probably had more opportunities than anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Red alert: UCLA's opponents have kicked just two field goals
in seven games this season _ thanks in part to UCLA's porous
defense. Opponents have scored touchdowns on 71 percent of their
red-zone opportunities (17 of 24).
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the Bruins have scored touchdowns on 56 percent of
their red-zone visits.
</P>
<P>
   __ High praise: The Bruins haven't lost confidence in freshman
quarterback Cory Paus despite his 9-of-28 performance against Cal.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to be something else,'' cornerback Jason Bell said.
``Every day I tell him, `You're going to be !ital!it.' And he says,
`You think so?' He's just got a lot to learn.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Since his confirmation as chief delegate to the
United Nations, Richard Holbrooke has turned himself from
high-flying diplomat to part-time lobbyist, walking the halls of
Congress and buttonholing members on the elevator, on the Capitol
subway, at their doors _ anywhere he can find them.
</P>
<P>
   He was campaigning again Wednesday, and by midafternoon, with a
bevy of aides in tow, the tally was six formal appointments, 14
chance encounters and still more meetings to go, all in the cause
of rescuing the United States' standing at the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke, whose appointment was confirmed by the Senate in
August, has come to Washington every week, sometimes twice a week,
to try to persuade Congress to pay nearly a billion dollars that
the United States owes the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The consequences are catastrophic if we don't get this,''
Holbrooke said to Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard, D-Calif., after
running into the congresswoman in the corridor.
</P>
<P>
   He then dashed into the office of Rep. James Greenwood, R-Pa.,
who is one of the high hopes in Holbrooke's nitty-gritty campaign
to persuade Republicans who are against abortion to untie that
issue from legislation authorizing payment of the U.N. money.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, President Clinton vetoed a bill containing payments
for the United Nations because it included an amendment restricting
U.S. funding for family planning organizations abroad. Holbrooke,
whose success as the American representative depends in part on
whether Washington pays the arrears, is seeking to avoid a similar
outcome this year.
</P>
<P>
   But for all his crusading, Holbrooke knows that as the budget
battle with the Republicans unfolds, the heavy lifting on the U.N.
payments must come from the White House.
</P>
<P>
   He said Wednesday that he was heartened to be informed by Sandy
Berger, the national security adviser, that Clinton had put foreign
policy _ including the U.N. arrears and financial assistance to the
Middle East _ ``on top of the agenda'' during a budget negotiations
session with Republican leaders Tuesday night at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president has made it a priority issue,'' Holbrooke said,
just as he bumped into an old friend, Rep. Patsy Mink, D-Hawaii,
who served at the State Department with Holbrooke and who did not
need any cajoling on the U.N. issue as they rode the subway
together.
</P>
<P>
   But the Republicans were not sounding so positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The White House has to come up with some ideas on how to solve
this issue,'' said a senior aide to the Republican leadership.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The aide said the White House was trying to figure out how to
solve the matter through deft legislative and political handiwork.
``They have to think out of the box,'' the aide said.
</P>
<P>
   As Holbrooke made his rounds Wednesday, the House passed the
Commerce, Justice, State appropriations bill that contains the
money for the United Nations. But there was little room for
Holbrooke to celebrate. For the money to be actually paid, the
Republicans have insisted that an authorization bill be passed as
well. In the past, the amendment restricting financing of
family-planning groups that support abortion has been attached to
the authorization legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke concedes that he leaves the intricacies of legislation
to experts from the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   For him, there is only one issue: national security.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about the United States and our national security,
about funding peacemaking efforts in East Timor and local police in
Kosovo,'' he said. In both those places, the United States has
argued for strong U.N. involvement rather than sending the American
military.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke, like any savvy lobbyist, has his script rehearsed. He
reminds members of a deal between Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., and
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, which calls for the payment
of $926 million in arrears in exchange for Washington's insistence
on various U.N. reforms. Those include zero growth in the U.N.
budget and a reduction in the United States' share of the
administrative budget, to 22 percent from 25 percent. The deal also
mandates that the United States get back its seat on the budget
committee, which Holbrooke tells members has been accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   The $926 million is actually less than the United Nations says
the United States owes, but it is enough to continue the ``United
States in the business of the United Nations,'' Holbrooke said. The
total tab is $1.7 billion, according to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   One of Holbrooke's last calls Wednesday was to Rep. David
Dreier, R-Calif., the chairman of the subcommittee on rules and
organization. When it gets down to the wire, Dreier can decide how
the vital authorization legislation is played out.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke emerged from the half-hour meeting satisfied.
``Congressman Dreier is clearly in the category of
national-security-conscious members of the congressional
majority,'' he said.
