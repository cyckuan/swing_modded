METS CRUSH BLUE JAYS, 11-3 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When the Mets raved about Jason Isringhausen four
years ago, it was because they believed he would be a reliable
starter for them for the next decade. When the Mets talked about
the right-hander pitcher during the last three years, it was
usually because they were giving injury updates. So when the Mets
discuss Isringhausen these days, they do it very cautiously.
</P>
<P>
   But Isringhausen gave the Mets ample reason on Tuesday night to
be a little more daring when his name is mentioned by pitching
strongly into the sixth inning and getting credit for an 11-3
victory over the Toronto Blue Jays at Shea Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   It was not a dominant performance and it will not be enough to
keep Isringhausen in the rotation when Bobby Jones returns. But it
was Isringhausen's first triumph in 21 months and that is
significant. Mostly for him, but also for the recuperating Mets,
who won their third straight after an eight-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   Isringhausen, whose career has been hampered by too many
expectations and too many injuries, had not won a major league game
since he beat the same Pat Hentgen and the Jays, 3-0, on Sept. 1,
1997. He missed the entire 1998 season after undergoing
reconstructive right elbow surgery. That came after he broke his
right wrist and had tuberculosis in 1997, and he endured
arthroscopic surgery on his right shoulder and his elbow in 1996.
Of the first 17 lines of Isringhausen's biography in the Mets'
media guide, 13 are related to injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is funny, in a way,'' Isringhausen said. ``At times, I've
thought that if I didn't have bad luck, I wouldn't have any luck at
all. Those 21 months, I got through it and I kept my mind straight.
I got through everything. It makes me realize I can get through a
lot.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It should be a night he has been waiting for and he could put
to rest,'' Manager Bobby Valentine said. ``He can go to bed and
feel that those two years or whatever it was has brought him
fulfillment and the first of many wins.''
</P>
<P>
   So it was obviously a relief to Isringhausen on Tuesday night
when the bullpen did not crumble after he left with a 4-1 lead two
outs into the sixth inning, having yielded two hits and two earned
runs. Dennis Cook replaced Isringhausen and promptly allowed a
pinch-hit two-run homer to Jacob Brumfield. But three relievers
held the Jays scoreless after that and the Mets exploded for four
runs in the seventh and three in the eighth to turn the game into a
rout.
</P>
<P>
   For the Mets, Rey Ordonez had four hits and knocked in two runs,
Robin Ventura had three hits and drove in a run, Edgardo Alfonzo
stroked a two-run homer and Roger Cedeno had a three-run homer.
</P>
<P>
   With a fastball that reached 93 miles an hour, Isringhausen
whiffed six and allowed only a homer to Jose Cruz Jr. and a single
to Hentgen. He walked five, but held the Jays without a hit in four
at bats with runners on while improving to 1-1 this year and 18-18
in his career. Half of those victories came during his rookie
season, when Isringhuasen went 9-2.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, rallies start in strange places. Could there be any
stranger place for the Mets than with Ordonez and Isringhausen?
After Ordonez's single in the third, Isringhausen tried to bunt him
to second base. Darrin Fletcher, the Blue Jays' catcher, grabbed
the ball and fired it past Homer Bush, who was covering first, to
put runners on first and third.
</P>
<P>
   Hentgen tried to catch Isringhausen napping at first and nearly
picked him off when he started his motion, stepped toward third and
then quickly threw back to first. Isringhausen was safe on a close
play, but the Mets' third base coach Cookie Rojas began shouting at
Umpire Angel Hernandez because he felt Hentgen had balked. Rojas
was ejected.
</P>
<P>
   That caused Valentine to step in as third base coach. Valentine
coached one inning and in it the Mets scored three runs to take a
3-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Rickey Henderson roped a fly to deep center field, which enabled
Ordonez to tag up from third. When Alfonzo followed with a massive
two-run homer over the left field fence, Valentine hustled down the
line to congratulate both players as they passed. Valentine
replaced himself with Bruce Benedict in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   One inning later, John Olerud stroke a two-out double to left
and scored on Mike Piazza's single through the middle to bump the
advantage to 4-1. Piazza had been batting .220 with runners in
scoring position.

BUHNER CONFIDENT OF FUTURE WITH M'S 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ As pivotal as this season is for the Mariners
franchise, it is just as important for right fielder Jay Buhner.
</P>
<P>
   Buhner, who turns 35 in August, missed most of last season with
injuries, and is on the disabled list with a strained left
hamstring now. The Mariners have a $6.3 million option on him for
next year, with a $400,000 buyout.
</P>
<P>
   Given the Mariners' budget concerns, and the pending free agency
of starter Jeff Fassero, first baseman David Segui and designated
hitter Edgar Martinez, $6.3 million is a hefty price. Buhner said
he's thought about those issues, but he's confident he'll come back
_ somehow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I've got to get myself healthy, and once I do that, I'm
going to be able to help the team win ballgames,'' Buhner said.
``Whatever happens at the end of the year happens. It'll work out
one way or another, if I've got any say-so. The three of us
(Martinez, Buhner and Ken Griffey Jr.) have been together over 10
years, and they know I want to continue to keep doing that and end
my career here, and I'm going to. I'm not worried about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Buhner's immediate return is not less than two weeks away, he
said. He ran lightly for the third day in a row Tuesday and will
undergo a more rigorous workout Wednesday. He said his main problem
has been lateral movement, bending down for balls and coming back
up again, and cutting on the bases. Lingering inflammation has
caused the leg to cramp.
</P>
<P>
   Buhner was not on the Mariners' last road trip, but he chose to
make this one. He needs to be with the training staff, but there is
another reason. Even if he can't play, Buhner said, he still can
exercise his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day, you're always learning something new,'' Buhner
said. ``You can always take something in and see certain things,
and just being around the game a little bit kind of keeps your
brain working. I may not be seeing a whole lot here, because it's
interleague and we're not facing these guys again, but at the same
time, you're seeing the ball out of the pitcher's hand, and you're
just able to take in the game and be a part of it. So you can make
a positive out of something.''
</P>
<P>
   When Buhner returns, it will put manager Lou Piniella in the
same bind he faced before: how to fit seven outfielders on a roster
that also should have 11 pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want Jay back, but I don't like to look at the
repercussions,'' Piniella said. ``Let me enjoy it while I can.''
</P>
<P>
   JUGGLING ACT: Piniella made a few lineup changes Tuesday, giving
Rafael Bournigal a start at second base and playing John Mabry at
third. David Segui also returned to the lineup after missing five
starts because of a sinus infection.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've tried to play our bench some, and we've continued to do
that,'' Piniella said. ``The weather's starting to get hot, and
we're hoping to keep some players sharp. Tomorrow, I'm thinking of
using (Matt) Mieske in left field to give (Brian) Hunter a day off.
We'll give everybody a little playing time on this road trip.''
</P>
<P>
   Bournigal, who batted .343 filling in for Alex Rodriguez, made
his second start since Rodriguez returned from the disabled list
May 15.
</P>
<P>
   COORS WEST? With its brick facade, forest-green seats and
three-tiered stands, Coors Field has some similarities to Safeco
Field.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Safeco designers were influenced two ways by Coors. At
both parks, the concourse level offers a field view from every
point. And Safeco Field's home-plate entrance was expanded when the
Rockies told the Mariners that most fans prefer to enter through
one gate.
</P>
<P>
   But Mariners pitcher Jeff Fassero, who took a tour of Safeco
Field last week, said he doesn't see the similarities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Safeco's going to be a pretty different place,'' he said. ``In
foul territory, it's similar, but between the foul poles, it's all
different. The scoreboard's in a different place (left field at
Coors, center at Safeco), they have seats where our bullpens are,
and there's a whole level of seats in left field that they don't
have here.''
</P>
<P>
   And what about that row of purple seats that rings the upper
deck at Coors Field, signifying one mile above sea level?
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we'll have a teal line where sea level is,'' Fassero
said.
</P>
<P>
   A JUNIOR SALUTE: Griffey found himself surrounded by autograph
seekers about 10 minutes before Tuesday night's game. Nothing new,
right?
</P>
<P>
   Well, these hounds were members of the Super Bowl champion
Denver Broncos. About 50 players and coaches lined up on the Coors
Field baselines, with head coach Mike Shanahan tossing the first
pitch to ``catcher'' Terrell Davis. After the ceremony, about 10
Broncos crowded around Griffey to get him to sign the souvenir bats
they'd received from the Rockies. The Mariners star was happy to
oblige.

INDIA AND PAKISTAN AGREE TO TALK ABOUT KASHMIR  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ For the first time since fighting erupted in
the disputed province of Kashmir last month, senior Indian and
Pakistani officials agreed on Tuesday to discuss ways of defusing
the tension, Pakistan announced.
</P>
<P>
   Although the two countries remain far apart in their perceptions
of the crisis and the possible solutions, the announcement that
they are ready to open peace talks is certain to be welcomed by the
outside world. This is the first conflict to erupt along the border
since both countries successfully tested nuclear weapons last year,
and it has raised fears in some foreign capitals that hostilities
could worsen rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan had offered to send its foreign minister, Sartaj Aziz,
to New Delhi on Tuesday, but India had demurred, apparently hoping
to delay talks until its army could make more progress on the
ground. India suggested Saturday for the talks and on Wednesday
Aziz accepted the invitation.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting broke out in Kashmir last month when Indian soldiers
sought to move back into their mountain positions along the border.
The Indians normally hold these positions in warmer months and
abandon them during the forbidding winter. But when they sought to
re-occupy them last month they came under fire. It soon became
clear that hostile forces had seized the snowy ridges on India's
side of the line of control.
</P>
<P>
   India describes the opposing forces as infiltrators supported by
Pakistan and including Pakistan army troops. Pakistan denies any
involvement and says the forces are Muslim rebels seeking to free
Kashmir from Indian control.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfair to call them infiltrators,'' said Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan. He described them as members of ``a
freedom movement.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The often violent conflict over Kashmir dates back to the
founding of India and Pakistan in 1947. Under an agreement that
neither side accepts, India came to control two-thirds of the
province and Pakistan the rest. Both claim all of it, and they have
fought two wars to assert their claims.
</P>
<P>
   Kashmir's maharaja at partition was Hindu and chose to be part
of India, but the people are mainly Muslim, and the region has
become a rallying point for Islamic militants around the world who
see it as unjustly subjected to the yoke of a Hindu power. India
contends that it respects the rights of the Muslims and offers them
every privilege.
</P>
<P>
   If negotiations begin as planned on Saturday, the agenda is
likely to be the first issue disputed. Pakistan does not agree that
it is a party to the conflict; it says it has done nothing to
promote the infiltration of fighters, and that none of them are
Pakistani soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Aziz, the Pakistani foreign minister, may seek to question the
legality of the division of Kashmir, a gambit India has vowed to
reject. In a nationally televised speech on Monday, India's prime
minister, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, said that if Pakistan seeks to
discuss the Kashmir issue as a whole, ``the proposed talks will be
over before they even begin.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The subject is one and one alone: the intrusion, and how
Pakistan proposes to undo it,'' Vajpayee said.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting along the border is intense. Indian forces have been
bombarding hostile positions in the forbidding mountains, both from
the air and with artillery. India's strategy is evidently twofold:
agreeing to negotiate while pressing its military campaign to
regain control of the high ground along the border.
</P>
<P>
   India claims to have killed dozens of Pakistani soldiers on its
side of the border, but has not given the total. It has reported
the death of 63 Indian soldiers, with 217 wounded and 14 missing
and possibly captured.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of civilians have been forced to flee their homes in
Kashmir, overwhelming the local resources to provide them with
shelter and medical care.

BABBITT WANTS MORE WATER FOR WILDLIFE IN WESTERN RIVERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By SHAUN MCKINNON  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   No more rivers should be sucked dry, Interior Secretary Bruce
Babbitt told a gathering of Western water officials Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Sounding more like an environmentalist than the steward of the
nation's vast network of dams and waterways, Babbitt proposed
setting minimum water levels necessary to keep natural river
systems healthy.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Babbitt described a three-pronged plan to
enable the West's rapidly increasing human populations to continue
growing.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt said water supply problems are related to allocation and
distribution, and he told water officials that those problems can
be solved with better conservation, with better development of
water markets and with underground water storage _ all of which are
being pioneered in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is time to acknowledge that the natural values of river
systems can no longer be treated as table scraps, left over after
every conceivable consumptive appetite has been fully satisfied,''
he said during a speech at the Natural Resource Law Center in
Boulder, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   ``A river is a living resource, entitled to at least parity with
consumptive uses,'' the former Arizona governor said.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt's new proposal to guarantee river flows, were it to
become policy, would mark a dramatic shift in the way the federal
government manages rivers in the West, where water rights are
prized more than gold.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, Western water law has been based on the bedrock
doctrine that the only beneficial use of water is consumptive use,
and any water left in a stream is wasted.
</P>
<P>
   It's a philosophy that environmentalists say has severely
damaged river systems. In Arizona, a century of such practice has
eliminated flowing water from many of the state's rivers, including
major stretches of the Salt, the Gila and the Santa Cruz.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt conceded that past policies have not encouraged
conservation of water for the sake of wildlife and river
ecosystems.
</P>
<P>
   In what Babbitt's aides characterized as the most important
water speech of his tenure, the secretary said the federal
government must be willing to change its course, as a river
sometimes does.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big task of the coming century will be to restore rivers,
wetlands and fisheries,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Reactions to Babbitt's remarks were mixed.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Orton, Southwest director for the American Rivers
conservation group, said Babbitt did not sound like a typical
Interior secretary when he talked about finding a balance in the
management of rivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he's talking about an assessment, river by river, of what's
best for that river's restoration, balanced with needs of people,
that's very exciting,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think balance is the key. We're certainly not
anti-development and not anti-dam. But if we ignore the state of
our rivers, development will be a moot point because we won't have
water to develop,'' Orton added.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Hogan, desert rivers coordinator for the Tucson-based
Southwest Center for Biological Diversity, was far less impressed,
saying Babbitt's words belie his policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly good news Babbitt is speaking in favor of these
concepts. But the reality is Interior is not implementing them,''
Hogan said. ``Under Babbitt's Interior, conservation gets the
lowest or no priority in river management.''
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt speaks the language of environmentalists, Hogan said,
but does nothing to back up his words. Tuesday's speech ``sounds
like greenwash to me,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups long have pleaded with federal and state
water managers to set aside water to help preserve and restore
river systems. Low flows in the Colorado River, for example, have
destroyed entire ecosystems because so little water from the
Colorado actually reaches the Gulf of California.
</P>
<P>
   In Arizona, conservationists are fighting with the U.S. Army and
fast-growing Sierra Vista to slow the withdrawal of groundwater
near the San Pedro River, which runs low enough now to endanger its
natural system.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Babbitt said water managers must learn to see how
systems like the San Pedro are related.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the coming century, water policy must be made in the
context of the entire watershed,'' he said. ``Water is a natural
resource with no fixed address, and any water use inevitably affect
many other uses, both upstream and downstream.''
</P>
<P>
   Water supply should not be the issue that prevents water
conservation, Babbitt insisted, in spite of the rhetoric coming
from states along the Colorado River.
</P>
<P>
   ``The water supplies that have been developed over the past
century of reclamation are truly impressive, and they should be
sufficient for the next century,'' he said. ``Our challenge is not
to build more dams, but to operate them in a more river-friendly
way.''
</P>
<P>
   And much more can be done, Babbitt said.
</P>
<P>
   In Phoenix, Los Angeles and other Western cities, he said, as
much as 40 percent of the water supply is slurped up for watering
lawns and landscaping.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conservation should begin by recognizing that Western cities
were not meant to resemble Brazilian rain forests or suburbs of
Minneapolis,'' Babbitt said. ``If a city wants more growth, it
already has the water at hand by moving toward sustainable,
desert-friendly landscaping.'' &QL;

   LOS ANGELES _ Right-hander Chan Ho Park will pitch June 17
against the Pittsburgh Pirates in what he and the Los Angeles
Dodgers hope is a triumphant return from a forced vacation.
</P>
<P>
   National League President Leonard Coleman announced Tuesday that
Park was suspended for seven games and fined $3,000 for his part in
a bench-clearing brawl Saturday with the Angels. Park began serving
the suspension immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expected three or five games,'' Park said. ``Seven games,
it's so long.''
</P>
<P>
   When told of the length of the suspension, several Dodgers shook
their heads in disbelief. Park said a message was relayed to him
from the National League office that he was given two extra games
for scissor-kicking Angels pitcher Tim Belcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's severe,'' manager Davey Johnson said. ``It's
normally three or five.''
</P>
<P>
   However, it made sense for Park to accept the suspension because
the Dodgers are off Thursday and Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Brown starts today in the series finale against the
Rangers. Carlos Perez, Ismael Valdes and Darren Dreifort will pitch
in the weekend series with Oakland. Brown and Perez will pitch the
first two games of the Pittsburgh series before Park starts the
series finale.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone called the ruling ``fair''
and ``appropriate,'' which is why the verdict wasn't appealed.
Malone's hope is that Park, who is 4-3 with a 4.84 ERA, returns
rejuvenated and distraction-free.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's get this behind us with Chan Ho and the injuries,''
Malone said. ``I think it's better to get it over with and behind
us.''
</P>
<P>
   But even with the suspension handed down, Park said he was
unsure of how or why the situation developed.
</P>
<P>
   Park took umbrage to a hard tag by Belcher after a bunt along
the first-base line. The two exchanged words before Park hit
Belcher with a forearm to the face and then grazed him with a
scissor-kick.
</P>
<P>
   ``I apologize for trying to hurt him and I want to tell the fans
I'm sorry,'' Park said. ``I was so mad about it. He pushed me
first. I asked him why he did that and he said, `Get the
(expletive) out of here.' ''
</P>
<P>
   However, Park was miffed by comments Belcher made to reporters
Monday in San Francisco in which the Angels pitcher was quoted as
saying, ``There are cultural differences and he might have that as
a legitimate excuse. But if he can be taught the language, he can
be taught the customs.''
</P>
<P>
   Park responded by questioning whether Belcher tagged him hard
because he is Korean.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that is not the reason he did it,'' Park said. ``I
don't think it is. I hope it's not.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Weekend is target: Johnson said injured outfielders Devon
White and Todd Hollandsworth could return during the weekend series
at Oakland. White left Monday's game with a groin strain.
Hollandsworth has been on the disabled list since June 4
(retroactive to May 28) with a torn muscle in his side and is
eligible to be activated Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping (White) returns by Friday and I'm hoping Holly by
Saturday,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   If both can return, it would boost the Dodgers outfield
situation greatly. They have three healthy outfielders _ Raul
Mondesi, Gary Sheffield and Trenidad Hubbard _ and Johnson is using
infielders Tripp Cromer and Dave Hansen as backups.
</P>
<P>
   __ Balks, walks and chalk: The Dodgers bullpen entered Tuesday's
game 2-1 with a 1.76 ERA and five saves in the last 12 games. . . .
Mondesi is fifth in the NL All-Star voting among outfielders,
trailing Chicago's Sammy Sosa, San Diego's Tony Gwynn, Colorado's
Larry Walker and San Francisco's Barry Bonds.

THEATER GROUP GETS BEHIND CLINTON'S CALL TO CHECK TEEN IDS AT
MOVIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DONALD BRADLEY  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ At the request of President Clinton, the
National Association of Theatre Owners announced Tuesday that its
members would require photo identification, most likely a driver's
license, from teen-agers who want to see R-rated movies without a
parent.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had challenged the industry to enforce the rating system
more strictly in the wake of the high school shootings in
Littleton, Colo. The North Hollywood-based trade organization
represents 65 percent of all movie screens in the country.
</P>
<P>
   But while the White House heralded the agreement, some in the
theater industry questioned its value. Childrens' advocates
observed, too, that the rule does nothing about cable access to
movie violence, or about video rentals.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, some chains _ including Kansas City area-based AMC
Theatres and Dickinson Theatres _ have been requiring teens to show
proof of age for years.
</P>
<P>
   But the rule is not always effective, said Andrew Armstrong,
Dickinson's director of operations.
</P>
<P>
   Teen-agers can be sneaky. They buy a ticket to see Macaulay
Culkin in ``Home Alone'' and then, once inside the big megaplex,
they slip in to watch Demi Moore in ``Striptease.''
</P>
<P>
   To prevent the deception, Armstrong said, an employee would have
to be posted at each ``screen'' door.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who wants to pay for that?'' Armstrong asked.
</P>
<P>
   At large megaplex theaters, especially, the additional check
points could add substantially to the ticket price.
</P>
<P>
   Dickinson provided the extra staffing for ``Showgirls'' which
appealed hugely to adolescent boys. ``Forbidden fruit,'' Armstrong
called it.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong puts the onus on parents. They are the ones who should
be assuming responsibility for the movies their children see.
</P>
<P>
   But parents often drop children at the door and drive away. Kids
can then often find a way into the movie they want to see,
Armstrong said.
</P>
<P>
   And not only that _ some parents will attempt to purchase
tickets to R-rated movies for children, then leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen parents get verbally abusive when we won't let
their kids into `R' movies,'' Armstong said.
</P>
<P>
   AMC spokeswoman Brenda Nolte said the theater chain has a couple
of secret methods to ensure that youngsters don't get into theaters
where they don't belong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying it hasn't happened, but I think we do a pretty
good job,'' Nolte said.
</P>
<P>
   Interviewed while shopping Tuesday in south Kansas City, a
16-year-old high school student agreed that the AMC Town Center 20
in Johnson County, which she often patronizes, strictly enforces
the rule.
</P>
<P>
   But she's found some movie houses that don't even question a
ticket-buyer's age. Other theaters won't sell tickets to underage
teens, she said, but it's common practice to sneak into forbidden
movies anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen every movie I've wanted to see,'' said the girl, who
asked that her name not be used.
</P>
<P>
   John Shipp of Cinema Consultants, which manages several local
theaters, thinks Kansas City theaters do a good job of policing
movie admission, but acknowledged that some operators aren't as
diligent as they could be.
</P>
<P>
   He suspected the new policy could help bring the others into
compliance.
</P>
<P>
   James Caccamo, executive director of Kansas City's Partnership
for Children, applauded Clinton's idea but said it's not the
solution.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great that they are going to make it harder for kids to
get into those movies, but that's only part of the problem of teen
violence,'' Caccamo said.
</P>
<P>
   He agreed with Armstrong that parents must do more.

UNION EMPLOYEES VOTE ON TWA OFFER, AND UNION OFFICER PREDICTS
DEFEAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RANDOLPH HEASTER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Area union employees of Trans World Airlines
voted Tuesday on the company's ``best and final'' offer for a new
contract, and a union officer said he expected the membership to
reject it.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the sacrifices our members have made over the years,
they're insulted by what's been offered,'' said Keith Nelson,
president of Machinists Local 1650. ``My opinion is that they're
going to overwhelmingly turn down the contract and provide a very
strong strike (authorization) vote.''
</P>
<P>
   About 600 TWA employees attended a meeting on Tuesday morning,
Nelson said. The terms of TWA's contract were discussed by union
officials and rank-and-file members before balloting was conducted.
Union members also voted on whether to authorize a strike against
TWA.
</P>
<P>
   The morning meeting consisted of workers from the second and
third shifts at TWA's overhaul base at Kansas City International
Airport. An evening meeting was scheduled for those who work the
first shift, and Nelson said about 1,100 people were expected to
attend.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas City mechanics and ramp workers were the first group
of employees to vote on TWA's contract offer, a process that is
expected to take the rest of the month. TWA workers in St. Louis
will be voting today.
</P>
<P>
   TWA has about 2,300 union employees in Kansas City, and the
Machinists union represents about 16,000 TWA workers systemwide.
The union is not expected to release the results of the balloting
until all the votes are in at the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   Union leaders have urged the members to reject TWA's contract
proposal, which they contend does not provide enough in wage
increases.
</P>
<P>
   TWA management has said its $350 million package of pay raises
and lump-sum payments would stretch the resources of a company that
has not posted a profit in 10 years. The contract would bring TWA
employees to 90 percent of the industry standard by July 2001, the
company said.
</P>
<P>
   Among those attending the meeting and election Tuesday was Al
Calhoun, general chairman of Machinists District 142. District 142
is the negotiating arm for the union in its talks with TWA.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson said conversations before and after the vote, as well as
comments during the meeting, indicated that the employees were
against the contract proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, TWA and St. Louis civic leaders tried to make a case
for approving the contract proposal.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, TWA brought in Darryl Jenkins, executive director of
the Aviation Institute at Georgetown University, to present his
analysis of TWA's contract offer.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins said the $350 million package was achievable but would
tax TWA's resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any additional commitment of resources by TWA would be
unrealistic, and the offers as currently constituted could cause
some financial uncertainty in the future,'' Jenkins said in his
report.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson dismissed the report.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a typical tactic taken when a company is involved in a
labor-management dispute,'' he said. ``There's a lot of stockholder
money out there that wants this new contract, but I don't think
that's going to happen.''

ADOBE TO ADD NEW DIVISION IN SEATTLE, FOCUSING ON INTERNET
PRODUCTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN COOK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Adobe Systems Inc., the San Jose, Calif.-based maker
of publishing and graphics software, on Tuesday announced a new
corporate division in Seattle that will help the company strengthen
its move to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Adobe, which already has about 500 employees in its Seattle
office, plans to add at least 50 jobs to the new division _ called
the Internet Products Group _ by the end of the year. But Hank
Skorny, who is overseeing the new division, indicated that the
number of new hires could be a lot higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``As fast as we can grow, we will grow,'' said Skorny, adding
that he will rely on his contacts in the Seattle technology
community to ramp up recruiting efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Only last week, Adobe cut 9 percent of its worldwide work force
in a move to reposition the company for the Internet. Only about 10
of the 250 jobs cut were in Seattle. And Tuesday's announcement to
focus the new direction of the company in Seattle could be seen as
a boost to the local technology industry.
</P>
<P>
   It's also another sign that technology companies, some based as
far away as Silicon Valley and London, view Seattle as a hotspot
for e-commerce and Internet technology.
</P>
<P>
   Adobe, which makes the PhotoShop, PageMaker and Illustrator
software products, joins an impressive list of companies trying to
latch on to the energy in Seattle's Internet and e-commerce
sectors. In March, Getty Images, a company that sells electronic
photographs over the Internet, moved its headquarters from London
to Seattle to be closer to the budding e-commerce community.
</P>
<P>
   The new companies include some of the biggest names in their
fields. HomeGrocer.com, Onvia.com and Concur Technologies are among
those who have moved here in the past couple of years for reasons
such as tax benefits and quality of life issues.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Washington Software Alliance, more than 2,500
technology companies are located in the state, up from 1,600 in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``A significant portion of Adobe's growth and revenue in the
future will be driven out of Seattle,'' said Skorny, who before
taking over the Internet Products Group served as senior director
of publishing at Adobe.
</P>
<P>
   Like Microsoft and other old-guard software companies, Adobe
Systems _ founded in 1982 _ is going through growing pains as it
attempts to embrace the Internet revolution.
</P>
<P>
   While that repositioning has caused some uncertainty at Adobe's
San Jose headquarters, it could mean a potential boom for the
company's Seattle office. In many respects, Adobe is placing a big
bet on Seattle and its burgeoning Internet community.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look at Seattle as an up-and-coming player with a lot of
vibrant, young energy,'' said Skorny. ``There is a certain edge
that the Seattle Internet community has.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Adobe's creation of a new division in Seattle caught some
analysts by surprise. ``I really don't know why they are choosing
Seattle,'' said Steve Shepich, an industry analyst at Olde Discount
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Since Adobe recently announced that it was consolidating part of
its international division in San Jose, Shepich said it would make
sense for the company to expand the Internet Products Group there
as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is there really that much more talent available in Seattle?''
</P>
<P>
   Skorny, who said Adobe plans to host a recruiting ``open house''
at its Seattle facility Thursday from 4-8 p.m., firmly believes the
talent pool in Seattle is stronger than other areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least in my experience the availability of (technology
workers) in Seattle is greater than Silicon Valley,'' Skorny said.
</P>
<P>
   According to a recent study by the Washington Software Alliance,
there are currently 10,000 open positions in the state's high-tech
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Adobe's Internet Products Group will be responsible for
expanding the company's GoLive Web-creating products which it
acquired earlier this year. It will also develop new technologies,
products and services for creating and assembling Web pages.
Expanding into the areas of Internet publishing is a smart and
necessary move for the company, said Shepich.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is definitely a huge area of growth potential for these
guys,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Vleeschhouwer, an analyst at Merrill Lynch Global
Securities, said Adobe is in the process of adopting a new business
model that is tied directly to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are trying to drive as much attention as they can to
their Web strategy,'' said Vleeschhouwer, adding that the cost
savings from the recent round of job cuts would be transferred to
the Internet division. ``Adobe believes _ and I think rightly so _
that they are well positioned to take advantage of the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Two computer scientists from the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center
founded Adobe 17 years ago. The company, which now has revenues of
almost $1 billion, opened a Seattle office in 1994 after it
acquired desktop software developer Aldus.

POLICE WARN ATM-CARD THEFT VICTIMS NOT TO GIVE OUT PINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JANE HADLEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ A rash of bank-card thefts has hit Seattle office
buildings, police say, but the worst part is that the victims are
unwittingly aiding the thieves in emptying their bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Since December, the Seattle Police Department's West Precinct
has had 55 complaints of stolen automatic teller machine (ATM)
cards, said Jim Pugel, precinct commander.
</P>
<P>
   In 25 of those cases, the thief followed up with a telephone
call to the victim. Pretending to be a police detective or bank
security officer, the thief asked victims for their personal
identification numbers (PIN).
</P>
<P>
   Armed with the stolen card and the personal identification
numbers, they then are free to empty the victim's bank account.
</P>
<P>
   A common scenario is for the thief to distract the receptionist,
getting the receptionist to leave the desk. The thief then rifles
through the purse and takes the purse or the wallet or sometimes
just the card.
</P>
<P>
   Pugel emphasized that police and security officers ``never,
never'' ask citizens for PIN numbers and that citizens should never
give them out over the phone.
</P>
<P>
   In the 25 phone calls made to victims after their cards were
stolen, the caller claimed to be bank security officers 21 times.
Claims to be a police officer were made four times, Pugel said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They sound very credible,'' he said. The call usually is made
within an hour of the time the ATM card is stolen.
</P>
<P>
   ``They sometimes may state they have a person in custody and
will be returning the victim's purse or wallet or card, but just
need to get the PIN to verify they have an account and have the
right card,'' Pugel said.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Eric Sano, head of the police department's check forgery
unit, said victims usually end up getting most of their money
refunded by the bank. But it takes a while and in the meantime the
victims are seriously incovenienced.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can't write checks. Their credit is damaged.'' And the
bank ends up having to take the loss, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The west precinct covers Magnolia, Queen Anne, downtown Seattle
and Pioneer Square.

SABRES CAUSE STARS POWER OUTAGE
</HEADLINE>
 CUP LEDE-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The Dallas Stars suffered a power outage Tuesday night,
the kind that could have melted the ice at steamy Reunion Arena.
</P>
<P>
   What's worse, it could be the first step in melting the Stanley
Cup hopes of the Stars.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars went 1-for-10 on the power play, including two rare
opportunities in overtime, and lost a 3-2 game when Buffalo Sabres
defenseman Jason Woolley whipped in a one-timer from the slot at
14:30 of overtime.
</P>
<P>
   The goal gave the Sabres a one-game lead in the best-of-seven
Stanley Cup Finals and pushes the Stars into a near must-win
situation for Game 2, scheduled for 7 p.m. tomorrow at Reunion
Arena. It also broke a 12-game losing streak for the Eastern
Conference, which had been swept in the three previous Finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't get swept now, anyways,'' Sabres coach Lindy Ruff
said. ``We just won one for the East.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres, who were dominated for the first two periods by the
Stars, now hold home-ice advantage; the Stars must win at least one
game at Marine Midland Arena, where the Sabres are 7-0 in the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Game 2 is a game that has a lot of pressure on the home team
regardless of what happens in Game 1, and the same thing goes for
the home team in Game 3,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said. ``There
will be some pressure on us in Game 2, and there will be some
pressure on them in Game 3.''
</P>
<P>
   Woolley's goal was a result of the hard-working forecheck of the
Sabres as Curtis Brown stole a soft clearing pass from Stars
defenseman Derian Hatcher at the halfboards and fed Woolley, who
was coming off the bench and had sneaked into the slot after a line
change.
</P>
<P>
   Woolley's shot went between the legs of Stars goalie Ed Belfour
and stunned a crowd of 17,001.
</P>
<P>
   It was a shocking ending for a rowdy crowd that had been pumped
up to its highest volume after the Stars sent the game into
overtime on Jere Lehtinen's goal with 49 seconds remaining in
regulation.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars had pulled Belfour for the extra attacker and
benefited from a great play by center Mike Modano. Modano squeezed
past Sabres goalie Dominik Hasek, stole the puck from Sabres center
Michael Peca behind the net and fed Lehtinen for an easy shot past
a stunned Hasek.
</P>
<P>
   ``The far corner was open, and it was a great pass from Mike,''
Lehtinen said of the slam-dunk. ``I was just out there, and it went
in.''
</P>
<P>
   The goal gave Stars fans hope after the Sabres had rallied from
getting only nine shots in the first two periods to scoring two
goals in the third. The Stars took a 1-0 lead on a Brett Hull
power-play goal at the 10:17 mark of the first period. But then
they squandered power-play chance after power-play chance until the
Sabres made them pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``From our standpoint, we'll have to get more desperation and
play for 60 minutes instead of 45,'' Hitchcock said. ``We didn't
score on the quality chances we had.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres took advantage as they finally skated up the ice that
had seemed to be tilted toward their goal all night and scored at
the 8:33 mark of the third period.
</P>
<P>
   Stu Barnes got the goal for the Sabres, whipping a shot through
a crowd to give the Sabres new hope.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Primeau then showed just how important the Sabres'
NHL-leading power play has been in the playoffs. Primeau chipped in
a rebound on the power play after camping out in front of Belfour
to put the Sabres ahead, 2-1 with 6:23 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars would get their own power-play opportunity a minute
later and fail on that. They would also fail on two power-play
chances in the overtime.
</P>
<P>
   It was the kind of game the Sabres had been hoping to steal. And
it was clear that this robbery had a lot to do with turning out the
Stars' power and sneaking in through the dark. But the Stars say
they know what it's like to lose Game 1 at home. After all, they
did the same thing against the Colorado Avalanche in the Western
Conference finals and won that series in seven games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like to do things the hard way,'' Hatcher said. ``We've
dropped Game 1s before. We're confident we can come back again.''

STARS SAY ONE LOSS IS NOT A CATASTROPHE
</HEADLINE>
 STANLEY CUP SIDEBAR-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ In one simple phrase, Mike Modano succinctly and
eloquently wrote the epitaph for Game 1 of the Stanley Cup Finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had our chances,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars lost Game 1 to the Buffalo Sabres, 3-2, Tuesday night
at Reunion Arena because they didn't take advantage of those
chances.
</P>
<P>
   They rained 37 shots at Sabres goalie Dominik Hasek, but got
just two past him. They rarely got to a rebound.
</P>
<P>
   ``He played his style of game,'' Modano said. ``Our inability to
get in there and get second and third chances was key.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars had eight power plays in regulation, but after scoring
on the first, they were shut out.
</P>
<P>
   They had an almost unheard of two power plays in overtime, when
the referees mostly skate around with the whistles in their
pockets, but couldn't cash in.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have that many power plays ... '' Stars forward Mike
Keane said. ``Special teams were a factor. We have to get better.''
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, they had the lead after the first two periods, and
seemed to be in control of the game. They were playing their usual
brand of aggressive-defensive hockey, taking 24 shots while holding
the Sabres to nine.
</P>
<P>
   In the Stars' system, when you're playing that well and have the
lead, you don't lose.
</P>
<P>
   But the visitors, perhaps spurred by desperation, had the most
energy in the third period. After playing on their heels for two
periods, the Sabres did most of the attacking and scored two goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The third period was really a bad period,'' Modano said. ``We
got away from our game, and let them back in it. We lost a lot of
our aggressiveness. We lost our edge in the third period.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Hasek made a couple of spectacular saves, including one
in overtime seconds before Jason Woolley's game-winner, the Stars
said they won't let him get in their heads.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hasek played well, but we have to find a way to beat him,''
Keane said. ``We didn't cause enough pressure in their end, or get
enough traffic in front of Hasek.''
</P>
<P>
   On the positive side, the Stars did get off the 37 shots, plus
another 25 that went wide or high.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as you have that many chances, eventually they'll go
in,'' Modano said. ``We have to fight for space in front of the
net.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars are in a familiar position. They lost Game 1 at home
to the Colorado Avalanche in the Western Conference finals, but
rallied to win Game 2 and eventually the series in seven games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were very frustrated,'' Modano said. ``We didn't play our
game. We felt we let each other down as a team, and we'll regroup
as a team. We've done it before, taken losses personally, and come
back and tied the series up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to play desperation hockey.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars are down in the series, but not in spirit. They are a
veteran group that knows how to bounce back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone's disappointed, but one game is one game,'' Keane
said. ``We're far from out of this. No one's down.''
</P>
<P>
   They might not be down, but neither are they pleased. The
dressing room was almost deserted after the game, but before they
disappeared, the Stars players vented their frustrations at losing
a game in which they had so many opportunities to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a lot of upset guys after the game,'' Modano said.
``When we have that, we usually regroup.''

SABRES DEFEAT STARS, 3-2, IN OPENING GAME OF STANLEY CUP FINAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Ed Belfour, the Dallas goalie, goes by the nickname the
Eagle, and he wears the image of the bird on his head gear. Dominik
Hasek, the Buffalo goalie known as the Dominator, wears an
old-fashioned mask often called a ``bird cage.'' This aviary
rivalry goes back a decade, and Hasek flew highest on Tuesday night
in the opening game of the Stanley Cup finals as his Sabres stunned
the Stars, 3-2, in overtime, before at Reunion Arena.
</P>
<P>
   The winning goal was scored by Jason Woolley at 15 minutes 30
seconds of the extra session after Hasek made two stunning saves.
</P>
<P>
   Woolley scored on a wrist shot from the slot that beat Belfour
after taking a feed from Curtis Brown.
</P>
<P>
   He may have taken the Stars by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just came off the bench, said Wooley, who has scored 4
playoff goals. ``I think I snuck up on them a little bit. In
overtime, you just want to shoot. I got lucky and it went in. I
didn;t know how to react''
</P>
<P>
   Hasek stopped 35 shots and seemed weary in overtime, remaining
on the ice long after making saves and lying prone after Woolley's
winning goal. But Hasek said he felt no effects of the groin injury
that kept him out of two games of the Eastern Confgerence fianls
against Tornto.
</P>
<P>
   Game 2 is here on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night's game mixed excellent goaltending, hard hitting,
wonderful tension and most of the elements that display hockey at
its best.
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres finished a lowly seventh seed in the weaker East.
Dallas finished first in the Western Conference and first over all
in the 27-team National Hockey League. Although the Stars must
still be considered the favored team, a Buffalo surprise seems like
a more realistic possibility after Tuesday night's events.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was too tired; I couldn't even gop to the other side, Hasek
said referring to the celebration around Woolley. ``This building
is so hot. I made a save on Verbeek, I kicked up my leg and all of
a sudden I felt a cramp in my hip.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindy Ruff, the Buffalo Coach, made a reference to his team's
underdog status and the fact that the Eastern Conference
representative has been swept the last three seasons. ``the good
thing is we can't get swept now,'' Ruff said. ``We just won one for
the East.''
</P>
<P>
   Derian Hatcher, the captin of the Stars, said his team will
``have to make it tougher on Dominik'' in Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we shot a lot of pucks right at him,'' Hatcher said.
``We like to do things the hard way. ASe have dropped Game Ones
before. We're confident we can come back again.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars led for most of the game, but Buffalo tied it at 1-1
at 8:33 of the third period on a goal by Stu Barnes, who fired from
the slot to beat Belfour. This came while the Sabres skated with an
extra attacker because they had pulled Hasek during a delayed
penalty to Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres went up by 2-1 on a goal by Wayne Primeau, who camped
in front of the crease on the power play and knocked in a rebound
with a backhanded shot at 13:37. But Dallas tied it at 2-2 at 19:11
on a goal by Jere Lehtinen, who took a centering pass from Mike
Modano after Buffalo's checking center, Mike Peca, lost his stick
behind the Sabres' net.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars dominated the first two periods but emerged with only
a 1-0 lead despite a 24-9 edge in shots on goal. Brett Hull scored
with one second left in a power play, firing a one-time slap shot
from high in the Buffalo zone after passes from Modano and Lehtinen
at 10:17 of the first period.
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres escaped a worse fate later when James Patrick, their
veteran defenseman, took a double minor for accidentally
high-sticking Pat Verbeek of the Stars. The trend continued in the
second period, with Buffalo's streak reaching seven consecutive
penalties before the referees called a pair against Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Hasek, who missed two games in the previous series against
Toronto with a groin injury, seemed to be in fine form, dropping to
his knees and side and using moves goalies sometimes call
``swimming.'' Occasionally, he shed his goal stick, as is his
custom. When Jon Sim of Dallas took an extra whack at the puck
after Hasek made a save, the goalie reacted angrily, and so did
several of his teammates. During the ensuing multiplayer scrum,
Brian Skrudland of the Stars hit Vaclav Varada of the Sabres in the
face with a butt of his helmeted head. No penalty was called.
</P>
<P>
   Varada was involved in a complicated play early in the second
period that resulted in an apparent goal being waved off and Varada
going to the penalty box for interfering with Belfour. A Buffalo
shot by Mike Peca got past Belfour, and the puck bounced over the
line just as Belfour was falling to the ice after a light jostle
from Varada.
</P>
<P>
   Both Hasek and Belfour are known for shows of temper when
bothered by opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Both also are 34 years old, and that is not all they have in
common. Although neither has played for a Stanley Cup winner, both
Hasek and Belfour have been to the finals before, when both played
for the Chicago Blackhawks, who lost to the Pittsburgh Penguins in
the finals of 1992. And their memories of their time together show
how differently two people in the same circumstances can perceive
the same environment.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour was the first-stringer under Mike Keenan, the coach and
general manager of the Hawks. Chicago's part-time goalie coach was
then, and still is, Vladislav Tretiak, the Hockey Hall of Famer who
used to play for the national team of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a good relationship in Chicago,'' Belfour said. ``In
practice, we competed against each other and worked hard against
each other and I think it was an overall positive relationship for
both of us. We worked closely with Vladislav Tretiak, which I think
helped both of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Hasek's memories were different. ``Eddie was the starting goalie
and I was the backup goalie,'' Hasek said. ``Our relationship, I
mean, it was tough. But I don't think our relationship was bad.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Tretiak, Hasek said: ``He never really worked with me. He
worked more with Eddie Belfour. I cannot say he taught me
something.''
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1992, Keenan traded Hasek to Buffalo for
Stephane Beuregard and a fourth-round draft choice. Since then,
Hasek has won the Vezina trophy four times as the league's best
goalie and the Hart trophy twice as the best player.

CAMPS FOR CHERRY PICKERS INADEQUATE, FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TELLS
STATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By HEATH FOSTER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ As many as 1,600 migrant cherry pickers will end up
sleeping in their cars and camping in the woods of Eastern
Washington this summer because of a disagreement between the state
and federal governments.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Department of Labor recently told the state that its
cherry camp rules are inadequate to protect the health and safety
of farm workers.
</P>
<P>
   And the Labor Department two weeks ago warned growers that
participating in the state cherry camp program could expose them to
$1,000 fines.
</P>
<P>
   Growers expected to provide shelter for at least 1,600 workers
this summer have since begun pulling out of the cherry camp
program, and the state fears it will soon have no growers
participating.
</P>
<P>
   Just days before the cherry picking season begins in earnest,
state officials say they expect living conditions to be far worse
this summer than last. Then, hundreds of workers camped for weeks
without toilets and running water because some growers, frustrated
with tougher new farm worker housing regulations, chose not to
operate their camps.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will have a couple more thousand people without any place
to stay this growing season as a result of the U.S. Department of
Labor's position,'' said Rich Nafziger, Gov. Gary Locke's executive
policy assistant on farm worker issues.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 16,000 workers bring in Washington's cherry crop
every June and July. Nafziger said roughly half those workers will
commute from their homes to the orchards. Another 1,500 or so will
stay with growers that have cabins or other solid-wall housing. The
rest will stay with friends and relatives or camp where they can _
often on public land and along rivers and creeks _ Nafziger said.
Because thousands end up camping in rough conditions, the state has
worked to expand its licensed cherry camp program to encourage
growers to house more workers.
</P>
<P>
   The cherry camp regulations the state put in place this year are
less stringent than those for other crops partly because the cherry
season is short. Unlike the months-long apple harvest, it takes
only about three weeks to bring in a cherry crop. During that
intense period of picking, an individual grower often hires
hundreds of workers. And growers say it makes little sense for them
to spend thousands of dollars creating elaborate housing facilities
that are only used a few weeks a year.
</P>
<P>
   The state standards adopted this year require cherry growers to
equip labor camps with cooking facilities, showers, toilets and
electricity but allow workers to bring their own tents. The
Department of Health expected about 1,600 workers to use the
state-licensed camps.
</P>
<P>
   The regulations were adopted over the objection of farm worker
advocates who have long argued that the state is legally obligated
to ensure that cherry pickers have housing no worse than that
offered workers who harvest other longer-lived crops.
</P>
<P>
   In a May 10 letter to the state, Richard Terrill, regional
administrator of the federal Occupational Safety and Health
Administration, warned that state rules ``do not provide a level of
protection equivalent to approved... federal standards.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal law requires solid-wall housing, or at least
military-style tents with plenty of head room, as well as nearby
showers, refrigerators, electric lighting, toilets and cooking
facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Terrill said he made clear to state officials in April that
state cherry camp rules fall short of federal standards. The small
tents being allowed were particularly worrisome, he said. And he
was concerned that state officials would let growers substitute ice
chests for refrigerators.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if you have ever camped over in Eastern
Washington in the summertime, but when you wake up in the morning,
you'll find your food floating in water,'' he said. ``That is not
healthful storage of food.''
</P>
<P>
   But Nafziger said the state was ``blind-sided'' by the federal
agency's tough stance. He said the agency was well aware that the
state planned to enforce less-stringent standards this year and to
bring all camps into compliance with federal standards over a
decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's bad public policy to suddenly have 2,000 (fewer) units of
housing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Pacharzina, a lawyer who represents migrant pickers who
have challenged the state's cherry camp standards, said the state
bears responsibility for misleading growers about federal rules.
</P>
<P>
   She and several other farm worker advocates said Tuesday that
the state should ask the National Guard to provide safe,
military-style tent camps for workers.
</P>
<P>
   But Nafziger said such an operation would cost the state at
least $1 million, and that money is better spent on long-term
housing. The state opened a migrant center in Mattawa that
converted cargo containers into homes for as many as 300 workers
this month for $1.3 million, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People will be living in unacceptable conditions this summer
as they have been for the last 30 years,'' he said. ``But we are
better off trying to invest incrementally in providing incentives
for growers and building long-term housing than taking heroic
emergency steps.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Gempler, director of the Washington Grower's League, said
he will work to get OSHA to sign off on the state's pilot
Rent-A-Tent program.
</P>
<P>
   Under it, community agencies buy spacious, military style tents
they plan to rent to growers for the cherry season. Terrill, the
OSHA administrator, said he plans to inspect one of the 25 tents to
be bought by the Community Action Council of North Central
Washington, which serves Grant and Adams counties.
</P>
<P>
   Gempler said he hopes rent-a-tents can be used to rescue growers
that planned to have licensed camps where workers would bring their
own tents.
</P>
<P>
   But Nafziger said it's too late for the rent-a-tent program to
be expanded beyond 25 tents this summer, providing housing for just
150 workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no program for this year,'' he said.

SLEEP EXPERT DENIES KILLING PREMEDITATED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY KAMMER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some of Scott Falater's actions the night he killed his wife
were so strange and illogical that they contradict the charge of
premeditated murder and support the claim that he was sleepwalking,
a sleepwalking expert testified Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Roger Broughton, a witness for the defense, said he
concludes that sleepwalking ``is by far the most probable''
explanation of the 1997 attack at the family's north Phoenix home.
</P>
<P>
   ``If one were going to commit a homicide, much of the activity
that's documented makes no sense to me,'' said Broughton, referring
to reports by a neighbor who witnessed part of the attack and by
police who investigated it.
</P>
<P>
   Broughton, a Canadian physician, neurophysiologist and sleep
researcher, said a killer acting with premeditation would not have:
</P>
<P>
   Left a body floating in a pool made crimson with blood from 44
stab wounds.
</P>
<P>
   Waited until he had completed the attack before putting on a
pair of gloves to drag the victim to the pool.
</P>
<P>
   Gone back to bed after the attack and reacted with bewilderment
when police arrived to arrest him.
</P>
<P>
   Broughton said he had concluded that Falater remained asleep
even though his wife screamed loudly enough for a neighbor to hear
and resisted so desperately that she was stabbed many times in the
hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that's what happened,'' Broughton said with a cool
professorial calm that contrasted sharply with the rapid-fire and
almost indignant interrogation by prosecutor Juan Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   Broughton even granted Martinez's supposition that Yarmila
Falater, who died just short of her 41st birthday, may have
repeatedly screamed her husband's name during the frenzied attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``And one of the things we know from the literature,'' Martinez
said, ``is that one of the best ways to wake somebody up from
sleepwalking is to call their name.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the best ways, but it doesn't always work,''
Broughton responded.
</P>
<P>
   But the doctor acknowledged also that he had based his opinion
on information that he had received directly from Falater, 43, a
former Motorola engineer who could face the death penalty if he is
convicted in Maricopa County Superior Court.
</P>
<P>
   Broughton said his interview with Falater led him to conclude
that he had no motive to kill his wife of 20 years or memory of the
attack, and felt deep remorse for his actions.
</P>
<P>
   Broughton relied on Falater's word to conclude that the engineer
had been struggling with sleep deprivation brought on by severe
stress at work, where Falater was confronting the failure of a
sophisticated computer chip developed by a team he directed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this was the type of stress that would make
sleepwalking occur,'' the doctor said.
</P>
<P>
   Falater was so sleep deprived on the night of the attack that he
fell quickly into a deep sleep when he went to bed after an
unsuccessful attempt to fix a pump for the backyard pool, Broughton
said.
</P>
<P>
   He said sleepwalking episodes begin during deep sleep that
generally is characterized by the unstable brain wave activity
measured in Falater.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I presume may well have happened was that Scott was out
there working on the (pump) and Yarmila heard him and went out to
see if she could help or whatever, and that she probably touched
him,'' Broughton said.
</P>
<P>
   Such contact, particularly if it interrupts a sleepwalker in the
middle of a task, commonly provokes a violent attack, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The jury, 10 women and five men who have remained attentive
throughout the trial, submitted more than a dozen questions for
Broughton. Most were read aloud by Judge Ronald Reinstein.
</P>
<P>
   One juror, mindful of the defense claim that on the night of the
attack Falater had quickly fallen into a deep sleep, asked how long
it took Falater to reach deep sleep on the four nights he was
tested at St. Luke's Behavioral Health Center.
</P>
<P>
   Broughton said Falater had needed 60 to 124 minutes to reach
deep sleep. But he noted that Falater was not sleep deprived at the
time of the tests.
</P>
<P>
   Another juror wanted to know whether the study of sleep
disorders relied heavily on speculation rather than hard scientific
data.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have very detailed knowledge about a wide variety of sleep
disorders,'' he testified.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Martinez sought to undermine Broughton's credibility
by suggesting that the Canadian had played hide-the-ball by
refusing several months ago to provide information on his research.
</P>
<P>
   But with help from defense attorney Michael Kimerer, Broughton
appeared to repair any damage when he responded that he had never
before been part of a U.S. trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't realize the way it was done in the States,'' he said,
adding that he had responded to Martinez's questions in a five-hour
interview.
</P>
<P>
   The trial is in recess until Monday so that Reinstein can attend
a judicial conference. &QL;

rest will stay with friends and relatives or camp where they can _
often on public land and along rivers and creeks _ Nafziger said.
Because thousands end up camping in rough conditions, the state has
worked to expand its licensed cherry camp program to encourage
growers to house more workers.
</P>
<P>
   The cherry camp regulations the state put in place this year are
less stringent than those for other crops partly because the cherry
season is short. Unlike the months-long apple harvest, it takes
only about three weeks to bring in a cherry crop. During that
intense period of picking, an individual grower often hires
hundreds of workers. And growers say it makes little sense for them
to spend thousands of dollars creating elaborate housing facilities
that are only used a few weeks a year.
</P>
<P>
   The state standards adopted this year require cherry growers to
equip labor camps with cooking facilities, showers, toilets and
electricity but allow workers to bring their own tents. The
Department of Health expected about 1,600 workers to use the
state-licensed camps.
</P>
<P>
   The regulations were adopted over the objection of farm worker
advocates who have long argued that the state is legally obligated
to ensure that cherry pickers have housing no worse than that
offered workers who harvest other longer-lived crops.
</P>
<P>
   In a May 10 letter to the state, Richard Terrill, regional
administrator of the federal Occupational Safety and Health
Administration, warned that state rules ``do not provide a level of
protection equivalent to approved... federal standards.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal law requires solid-wall housing, or at least
military-style tents with plenty of head room, as well as nearby
showers, refrigerators, electric lighting, toilets and cooking
facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Terrill said he made clear to state officials in April that
state cherry camp rules fall short of federal standards. The small
tents being allowed were particularly worrisome, he said. And he
was concerned that state officials would let growers substitute ice
chests for refrigerators.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if you have ever camped over in Eastern
Washington in the summertime, but when you wake up in the morning,
you'll find your food floating in water,'' he said. ``That is not
healthful storage of food.''
</P>
<P>
   But Nafziger said the state was ``blind-sided'' by the federal
agency's tough stance. He said the agency was well aware that the
state planned to enforce less-stringent standards this year and to
bring all camps into compliance with federal standards over a
decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's bad public policy to suddenly have 2,000 (fewer) units of
housing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Pacharzina, a lawyer who represents migrant pickers who
have challenged the state's cherry camp standards, said the state
bears responsibility for misleading growers about federal rules.
</P>
<P>
   She and several other farm worker advocates said Tuesday that
the state should ask the National Guard to provide safe,
military-style tent camps for workers.
</P>
<P>
   But Nafziger said such an operation would cost the state at
least $1 million, and that money is better spent on long-term
housing. The state opened a migrant center in Mattawa that
converted cargo containers into homes for as many as 300 workers
this month for $1.3 million, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People will be living in unacceptable conditions this summer
as they have been for the last 30 years,'' he said. ``But we are
better off trying to invest incrementally in providing incentives
for growers and building long-term housing than taking heroic
emergency steps.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Gempler, director of the Washington Grower's League, said
he will work to get OSHA to sign off on the state's pilot
Rent-A-Tent program.
</P>
<P>
   Under it, community agencies buy spacious, military style tents
they plan to rent to growers for the cherry season. Terrill, the
OSHA administrator, said he plans to inspect one of the 25 tents to
be bought by the Community Action Council of North Central
Washington, which serves Grant and Adams counties.
</P>
<P>
   Gempler said he hopes rent-a-tents can be used to rescue growers
that planned to have licensed camps where workers would bring their
own tents.
</P>
<P>
   But Nafziger said it's too late for the rent-a-tent program to
be expanded beyond 25 tents this summer, providing housing for just
150 workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no program for this year,'' he said.

 By JOSEPH DUARTE  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
CHICAGO _ Glen Barker is in need of a little redemption. Tuesday
night, he committed a cardinal sin.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Barker was caught trying to steal third base to end the game as
the Chicago White Sox posted a 4-3 victory over the Astros at
Comiskey Park.
</P>
<P>
   It's no secret Astros manager Larry Dierker gives his players a
perpetual green light on the basepaths. Houston leads the major
leagues with 77 steals.
</P>
<P>
   But with the Astros down to their final out with arguably their
fastest player already in scoring position, Dierker acknowledged he
should have put a hold on Barker at second base, especially
considering Chicago reliever Bob Howry's quick delivery to the
plate.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, with the Astros trailing by a run and Ricky Gutierrez
at the plate, Barker headed for third on a 2-1 pitch from Howry.
Gutierrez took the pitch, and catcher Brook Fordyce gunned down
Barker to end the game. Howry earned his 10th save with a scoreless
ninth inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a stupid mistake,'' said Barker, who stole second base
two pitches earlier after being inserted as a pinch runner for
Daryle Ward. ``I should have just let him swing the bat. Any kind
of hit or error, and I could have scored. It was one of those times
I made a bad decision, and it cost us the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take the blame 100 percent. It's not the manager. I should
have been smarter. I've been playing this game long enough to know
I shouldn't get thrown out at third.''
</P>
<P>
   Astros outfielder Carl Everett was willing to cut some slack to
the 27-year-old Barker, who is playing his first big-league season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a young guy. You can't blame it on him,'' Everett said.
``He did his job to get in scoring position. I think he maybe was a
little confused whether to take the base or not. He's learning. You
just have to live and learn.''
</P>
<P>
   The blame can't all be placed on Barker. The Astros went back to
their bad habit of late, failing to come up with a clutch hit. A
day after pounding out 17 hits, they were limited to nine on
Tuesday, six of them singles.
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox were able to stage a pair of rallies, the latter
coming on Magglio Ordonez's two-run homer in the sixth inning that
wiped out a 3-2 Astros lead. Ordonez drove in three runs in the
game.
</P>
<P>
   Astros righthander Shane Reynolds (7-6) lost his third straight
decision, allowing four runs and seven hits in 7 innings. A 19-game
winner a year ago, Reynolds has struggled over the last month. He
is 2-5 with a 5.48 ERA in his last seven starts dating to May 8.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just struggling right now. It's just I made a mistake, and
they capitalized on it,'' said Reynolds, who retired the first
eight batters he faced. ``I'm not walking a lot of people or
anything like that. I made two mistakes, gave up two runs in two
different innings, and that was enough for the ballgame.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Sox pitcher Jaime Navarro (5-4) held the Astros to
three runs and eight hits over eight innings to win his third
straight decision. Navarro coaxed the Astros into 14 ground-ball
outs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was keeping the ball down and had a lot of life on it,''
Chicago manager Jerry Manuel said. ``His ball seemed to explode.
(Jeff) Bagwell is a great hitter, and he struck him out twice. That
was dominant stuff he had tonight. He's been pretty consistent this
year. He's evolving into that guy that we all hoped he would
become.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros had taken a 3-2 lead in the sixth inning on Everett's
one-out solo homer, his fourth of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox regained the lead off Reynolds when Frank Thomas
hit his second double with one out in the sixth and Ordonez
followed with his club-high 11th home run. Ordonez also had an RBI
groundout in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Ward, who went 2-for-3, collected his first major-league RBI
when he hit a two-out single just inside the first-base line in the
fourth to score Richard Hidalgo.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago responded in the bottom half of the inning with two
runs. Mike Caruso led off with a bunt single and moved to third on
Thomas' double off the left-field wall. Ordonez hit a grounder to
second to tie the game at 1, and Carlos Lee followed with a single
to put the White Sox ahead 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Spiers, who had two hits Tuesday and has five in the past
two games, tripled in the fifth and scored on a single by Bagwell
to tie the game at 2.

POLICE WARN ATM-CARD THEFT VICTIMS NOT TO GIVE OUT PINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JANE HADLEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ A rash of bank-card thefts has hit Seattle office
buildings, police say, but the worst part is that the victims are
unwittingly aiding the thieves in emptying their bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Since December, the Seattle Police Department's West Precinct
has had 55 complaints of stolen automatic teller machine (ATM)
cards, said Jim Pugel, precinct commander.
</P>
<P>
   In 25 of those cases, the thief followed up with a telephone
call to the victim. Pretending to be a police detective or bank
security officer, the thief asked victims for their personal
identification numbers (PIN).
</P>
<P>
   Armed with the stolen card and the personal identification
numbers, they then are free to empty the victim's bank account.
</P>
<P>
   A common scenario is for the thief to distract the receptionist,
getting the receptionist to leave the desk. The thief then rifles
through the purse and takes the purse or the wallet or sometimes
just the card.
</P>
<P>
   Pugel emphasized that police and security officers ``never,
never'' ask citizens for PIN numbers and that citizens should never
give them out over the phone.
</P>
<P>
   In the 25 phone calls made to victims after their cards were
stolen, the caller claimed to be bank security officers 21 times.
Claims to be a police officer were made four times, Pugel said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They sound very credible,'' he said. The call usually is made
within an hour of the time the ATM card is stolen.
</P>
<P>
   ``They sometimes may state they have a person in custody and
will be returning the victim's purse or wallet or card, but just
need to get the PIN to verify they have an account and have the
right card,'' Pugel said.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Eric Sano, head of the police department's check forgery
unit, said victims usually end up getting most of their money
refunded by the bank. But it takes a while and in the meantime the
victims are seriously incovenienced.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can't write checks. Their credit is damaged.'' And the
bank ends up having to take the loss, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The west precinct covers Magnolia, Queen Anne, downtown Seattle
and Pioneer Square.

ADOBE TO ADD NEW DIVISION IN SEATTLE, FOCUSING ON INTERNET
PRODUCTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN COOK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Adobe Systems Inc., the San Jose, Calif.-based maker
of publishing and graphics software, on Tuesday announced a new
corporate division in Seattle that will help the company strengthen
its move to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Adobe, which already has about 500 employees in its Seattle
office, plans to add at least 50 jobs to the new division _ called
the Internet Products Group _ by the end of the year. But Hank
Skorny, who is overseeing the new division, indicated that the
number of new hires could be a lot higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``As fast as we can grow, we will grow,'' said Skorny, adding
that he will rely on his contacts in the Seattle technology
community to ramp up recruiting efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Only last week, Adobe cut 9 percent of its worldwide work force
in a move to reposition the company for the Internet. Only about 10
of the 250 jobs cut were in Seattle. And Tuesday's announcement to
focus the new direction of the company in Seattle could be seen as
a boost to the local technology industry.
</P>
<P>
   It's also another sign that technology companies, some based as
far away as Silicon Valley and London, view Seattle as a hotspot
for e-commerce and Internet technology.
</P>
<P>
   Adobe, which makes the PhotoShop, PageMaker and Illustrator
software products, joins an impressive list of companies trying to
latch on to the energy in Seattle's Internet and e-commerce
sectors. In March, Getty Images, a company that sells electronic
photographs over the Internet, moved its headquarters from London
to Seattle to be closer to the budding e-commerce community.
</P>
<P>
   The new companies include some of the biggest names in their
fields. HomeGrocer.com, Onvia.com and Concur Technologies are among
those who have moved here in the past couple of years for reasons
such as tax benefits and quality of life issues.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Washington Software Alliance, more than 2,500
technology companies are located in the state, up from 1,600 in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``A significant portion of Adobe's growth and revenue in the
future will be driven out of Seattle,'' said Skorny, who before
taking over the Internet Products Group served as senior director
of publishing at Adobe.
</P>
<P>
   Like Microsoft and other old-guard software companies, Adobe
Systems _ founded in 1982 _ is going through growing pains as it
attempts to embrace the Internet revolution.
</P>
<P>
   While that repositioning has caused some uncertainty at Adobe's
San Jose headquarters, it could mean a potential boom for the
company's Seattle office. In many respects, Adobe is placing a big
bet on Seattle and its burgeoning Internet community.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look at Seattle as an up-and-coming player with a lot of
vibrant, young energy,'' said Skorny. ``There is a certain edge
that the Seattle Internet community has.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Adobe's creation of a new division in Seattle caught some
analysts by surprise. ``I really don't know why they are choosing
Seattle,'' said Steve Shepich, an industry analyst at Olde Discount
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Since Adobe recently announced that it was consolidating part of
its international division in San Jose, Shepich said it would make
sense for the company to expand the Internet Products Group there
as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is there really that much more talent available in Seattle?''
</P>
<P>
   Skorny, who said Adobe plans to host a recruiting ``open house''
at its Seattle facility Thursday from 4-8 p.m., firmly believes the
talent pool in Seattle is stronger than other areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least in my experience the availability of (technology
workers) in Seattle is greater than Silicon Valley,'' Skorny said.
</P>
<P>
   According to a recent study by the Washington Software Alliance,
there are currently 10,000 open positions in the state's high-tech
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Adobe's Internet Products Group will be responsible for
expanding the company's GoLive Web-creating products which it
acquired earlier this year. It will also develop new technologies,
products and services for creating and assembling Web pages.
Expanding into the areas of Internet publishing is a smart and
necessary move for the company, said Shepich.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is definitely a huge area of growth potential for these
guys,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Vleeschhouwer, an analyst at Merrill Lynch Global
Securities, said Adobe is in the process of adopting a new business
model that is tied directly to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are trying to drive as much attention as they can to
their Web strategy,'' said Vleeschhouwer, adding that the cost
savings from the recent round of job cuts would be transferred to
the Internet division. ``Adobe believes _ and I think rightly so _
that they are well positioned to take advantage of the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Two computer scientists from the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center
founded Adobe 17 years ago. The company, which now has revenues of
almost $1 billion, opened a Seattle office in 1994 after it
acquired desktop software developer Aldus.

 By JONATHAN FEIGEN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
Humility comes easily, naturally. It fits in San Antonio. It fits
the Spurs.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Other cities are glamorous, celebrated in song and in the media.
Other teams expect greatness, championships, awards. San Antonio
extols its charms more subtly. The Spurs seek their rewards more
quietly.
</P>
<P>
   They could have tried to build a champion by collecting as many
superstar talents as they could find and hiring a flashy coach in
Armani, then just assumed they had championship mettle.
</P>
<P>
   But they have tried the wrong route before. They cast David
Robinson in a do-everything, beat-everyone role that fit him
poorly. They tried coaches with long rsums, from Larry Brown to
Jerry Tarkanian. They even sold their soul for the horribly miscast
Dennis Rodman.
</P>
<P>
   That could never work. That would not have been San Antonio. It
would not have been the Spurs. This is the city whose
internationally known symbol is a monument to courage in defeat.
</P>
<P>
   The Alamo City could win only this way.
</P>
<P>
   It seems fitting now that the Spurs began the best season of
their 26-year, two-league history by playing terribly. Their
greatest players, Robinson and Tim Duncan, came as the result of
horrible slides into the draft lottery. But the Spurs believed
themselves ready to contend.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the season started, we knew we could be a heck of a
team,'' coach/general manager Gregg Popovich said. ``We won 56
games the year before and improved our team with some of the guys
we added. So we had great expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs' 6-8 start is now considered a footnote in their
history in the making. It was less significant than a 1996-97
season so horrible that they lucked into the first pick of the
draft that brought them Duncan, or even the 1995 Western Conference
finals loss to the Rockets that left them hungry for another
chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before we played a game, a lot of people picked us,'' guard
Avery Johnson said. ``When we got off to a bad start, they went
back to calling us soft again and overrated and stuff like that.
Everybody backed off us when we were 6-8.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Spurs did not become so unstoppable in spite of their
slow start. The Spurs became the league's best team in the regular
season and, with second- and third-round playoff sweeps, the most
successful postseason team to this point since the 1988-89 Lakers
because of their slow start.
</P>
<P>
   When the Spurs arrived at Compaq Center in early March with a
losing record, the Rockets were considered a suitable measuring
stick, a more worthy title contender. Popovich was thought to be
running out of time as coach. Spurs fans, still angry about
Popovich's dismissal of coach Bob Hill on the day of Robinson's
return from the injured list in 1997, were calling for his job with
almost every misstep.
</P>
<P>
   The addition of Mario Elie, Steve Kerr and Jerome Kersey was not
working. Elie was still coming off the bench, with Jaren Jackson
struggling as a starting guard. The big men were struggling with
the passes necessary to get Kerr going. Kersey was working as a
backup power forward, rather than in his more comfortable spot as a
small forward. And the wrinkles Popovich had added to the offense
were ineffective.
</P>
<P>
   ``We jumped right into the season, and all of our timing was
really off,'' Robinson said. ``Tim and I weren't working well
together at all. It was hard to carry that continuity from last
season. Plus, our offense was just awful. I have to give Popovich
credit, because he simplified our offense. He said, `Let's do some
basic things _ let's do some pick-and-rolls; let's go inside.
Instead of trying to fool everybody, let's go right at them.' That
made us do a better job. A lot of it was just getting our rhythm
going.''
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs had lost five of their previous seven games heading
into the March 2 game at Houston. But attacking that game as if the
championship was on the line, they won 99-82.
</P>
<P>
   ``The turning point was definitely at Houston,'' Robinson said.
``We came together that game. A lot of it is because Avery and
Mario are from Houston. That was their big show. Both played really
well that game. That was the turnaround. That was the point we
said, `We're not going to throw this season away.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Houston was playing real well at that time. We said, `If we
could come in here and win this game, we can go anywhere and win
games.' That was the point where everyone had faith in one another.
We went on a nice little run after that.''
</P>
<P>
   Beginning with the win over the Rockets, the Spurs won nine
straight games. Including their 11-1 postseason streak to the NBA
Finals, they are 42-6 since their stumbling start.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a slow start, of course, but nobody lost any confidence
in each other,'' Duncan said. ``We knew what we could do. We
started turning it around and winning games. People got more
confident in what we were doing and believing in what we could do.
It was a long process of everybody trusting each other.''
</P>
<P>
   But the long process had a sudden turnaround, as if the
struggles forced the Spurs to take stock and discover the potential
that was going unfulfilled. Popovich never addressed his personal
situation, and it will never be clear how much rope he had left.
But there was little doubt the Spurs were at the breaking point,
ready to go either way.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were talking about (firing) Pop,'' Elie said. ``The team
came together starting in Houston. We got together as a unit and
said, `Hey, we're better than we're playing.' We got on an amazing
roll.''
</P>
<P>
   They have not stopped rolling since.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs had little choice but to be humble.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Robinson and Duncan were first-pick-of-the-draft
selections, the sort of franchise centers who immediately make
teams contenders and gave the Spurs the two greatest season
turnarounds in NBA history.
</P>
<P>
   But other than Sean Elliott _ and he has been traded three times
(including a deal to the Rockets that was canceled when he failed
his physical) _ the rest of the Spurs were castoffs or role
players, passed around or kicked out of the league repeatedly. Most
went from team to team, league to league, even country to country
trying to find a job.
</P>
<P>
   Modesty comes naturally. Egos are easily held in check. Effort
is a given.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not being a lottery pick, not going top 10 or first round,
these are guys who worked their way from the bottom to the top,''
Elie said. ``We appreciate where we're at. That's the problem with
a lot of young players. They get stuff handed to them too early. We
have to work all the time. We have to improve. We keep a chip on
our shoulder because of the hard road we took.''
</P>
<P>
   And rather than seek blue-chip celebrities, the sort of big
names who filled the rosters of the now-beaten Lakers and Trail
Blazers, the Spurs came to believe in the role players they already
had.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last few years, we invested in one another,'' Robinson
said. ``We kept playing and said, `Hey, Avery, you may not be Jason
Kidd, but we love you, and we want you here.' And that's important.
Utah kept their players. They believed in those guys. They may not
be the most talented players in the league, but they invested in
those guys, and they play great together. That's the same way we
feel about Jaren Jackson, guys we're committed to.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Johnson is shooting accurately. Jackson has overcome
his struggles to become a dangerous sixth man. Malik Rose, at 6-6,
successfully battled the Lakers' Shaquille O'Neal and the Trail
Blazers' Brian Grant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all goes back to one thing I saw that Avery and Sean
said,'' Portland guard Jim Jackson said. ``They believe in each
other. A lot of people say Avery can't hit that shot. But if they
swing the ball and Avery is open, they'll pass it to him and expect
Avery to make that shot. That's the way that team is.''
</P>
<P>
   For every Johnson, Jackson or Rose, the Spurs added a player
with veteran savvy. Kerr, Kersey and Elie were brought in to give
the Spurs added perimeter shooting around Duncan and Robinson and
defensive toughness to a team long labeled soft. Four games into
the season, in a postgame locker-room interview at Minnesota, Elie
ripped into Duncan and Robinson loud enough for both to hear,
setting a tone for the fire he would add.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I spoke up, I took a lot of flak for it,'' Elie said.
``But I knew we had a great team. I saw our big guys getting moved
around. I had to speak up and told them, `You guys have to play
better. If you guys play better, it's going to lift the other guys
around you.'''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson was shocked. But he was not angered or offended.
Instead, he seemed willing to accept Elie's point of view,
understanding the compliment implied in the expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't upset me, because I felt like he wanted to win,''
Robinson said. ``I don't have to get along with everybody. You do
have to be on the same page when it comes to this team. Mario is
just a different personality. He talks in the media. I wouldn't
talk in the media, but I said to Mario, `I don't care what you say;
just bring your ``A'' game. If you're going to talk, back it up.'
</P>
<P>
   ``He's done that for us. That's why I've never criticized him.
He's brought a lot to our team _ intensity and a pressure shooter
and a good defensive player. It was a little unusual for this team.
You don't have to be friends with everybody. You just have to be on
the same page with basketball. When you accomplish your goals, all
the little discomforts along the way don't seem quite as big.''
</P>
<P>
   At 37-13, the Spurs shared the best regular-season record in the
league with Utah but only now seem to be appreciated. When they
beat the Lakers, much of the national focus was on LA's
dysfunctional mix and unfulfilled potential. When they beat
Portland, the Trail Blazers' immaturity was blamed.
</P>
<P>
   But the Spurs did not seem to mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give us the `W,' and you can say whatever the hell you want,''
Popovich said. ``I don't care. Give us the `W,' and you can put the
respect anywhere. Put it in China. Put it in New Zealand. Just give
us the `W.'
</P>
<P>
   ``All that matters is what we do on the court.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the Spurs don't seem to give themselves credit for their
accomplishments. Asked about their consecutive sweeps in the
conference semifinals and finals, a feat matched only by the 1982
and 1989 Lakers, they routinely respond that sweeps are
inconsequential if not followed by a championship. Former Bulls
Kerr and Will Perdue said it is too soon to make comparisons to
previous NBA champions. Elie has said the team wins ugly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to work our tails off every night,'' Robinson said.
``We're not an overwhelming team. Look at most of the games, and
they're very close games. We haven't been blowing everybody out. We
win all the close games, but yeah, they're close. My mom and wife
tell me, `We can't watch the games. You guys are killing us.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care what the situation is. We have to grind it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Spurs' last two wins have actually been routs and
San Antonio is going mad around them, Robinson says the team
remains determined to be a fitting, no-frills representative of a
city and franchise that remember what it means to lose. Humility
still comes easily.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things that kept us in perspective is (that) in San
Antonio everybody is so excited,'' Robinson said. ``They're talking
about the race for the rings in the first round. They don't give
away rings in the first round. It helps us stay focused. We haven't
accomplished anything yet.''
</P>
<P>
   They have accomplished a great deal, of course, more than any
Spurs team ever has. But it somehow seems appropriate that
Robinson, Duncan and Co. consider it nothing so far.

THREE FOUND DEAD IN DAY CARE AT WOMAN'S SEATTLE HOME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By VANESSA HO  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ For years, Patricia Whitfield's Mount Baker day care
bubbled with the laughter of neighborhood kids and offered a safe
place for working parents to drop off their children.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday, it was the scene of a grisly triple homicide. It
began with a hysterical call to 911 and ended with a close-knit
neighborhood convulsed in grief.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors and friends identified the victims as Whitfield, her
daughter Tizi Ingram, and Ingram's daughter, Champagne, believed to
be about 7 years old. Seattle police, however, would not identify
the victims, saying only that they believed they were a mother,
daughter and a granddaughter.
</P>
<P>
   Police Tuesday night said they had no suspects. When officers
arrived at the day care, which was also Whitfield's house in the
3200 block of South 34th Avenue, they found the two women in a
bedroom, and the little girl in another part of the four-bedroom
home. They were all shot, police say.
</P>
<P>
   Officers also found two babies: A 4- to 5-day-old infant, and a
4- to 11-month-old baby. They are believed to be Ingram's
daughters. Police spokeswoman Pam McCammon said the babies appeared
unharmed. They were transported to Seattle's Harborview Medical
Center for evaluation, a hospital spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   At 2:58 p.m., a hysterical person, believed to be a man, called
911, saying ``his sister and mother are dead,'' McCammon, the
police spokeswoman, said. Fire medics raced to the house and found
the victims dead from gunshot wounds.
</P>
<P>
   McCammon said officers did not find a weapon and that detectives
had not mentioned the possibility of a murder-suicide. Neighbors
said Ingram's boyfriend had had run-ins with her five brothers, but
police, despite the presence of gang detectives, would not discuss
a possible motive.
</P>
<P>
   Friends said the boyfriend was jealous of the amount of time
Ingram spent with her family, and that her brothers had forbade him
from coming to the house.
</P>
<P>
   As a precaution, officials at nearby John Muir Elementary shut
down the school, where classes ended at 3:15 p.m. Panicked parents
rushed to the school, but the vice principal told students on the
intercom to stay in their seats a few minutes longer. Later, they
exited through a back door.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesdasy, friends and neighbors of Patricia Whitfield waited in
a light rain under cloudy skies for the bodies to be removed from
the home. With ministers, they gathered at the nearby elementary
school to mourn the deaths. They hugged, cried and screamed ``No!''
in disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   A distraught neighbor, Ray Rogers, 29 , said Whitfield had taken
care of him since he was 3 or 4 years old and remembered that she
``always had a love for children.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe it,'' he said, pulling his hair and crying.
``There's no motive whatsoever. This is a quiet neighborhood. You
can't begin to believe why, why.''
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors described Whitfield, who was divorced, as a tough,
kind, hard-working woman who raised a daughter and five sons alone.
She also worked as a Seattle Times customer service representative.
</P>
<P>
   Some neighbors said they practically grew up at Whitfield's
house, which, with her large family, was always a welcoming
neighborhood hangout.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son played with her grandson, and I grew up with her
kids,'' recalled neighbor Michael Jackson. ``It's tragic to hear
something like that went on over there.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was well-kept, very respectful and a hard-driven single
parent with all those boys. She had a respect from the
neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   J.J. Wilkerson said she was one of Whitfield's closest friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were real neighbors,'' she said. ``We lived right across
the alley from each other. We shared butter, we shared eggs, we
talked every morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilkerson's daughter, Arnell, agreed that Whitfield was a kind
person.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was very motivated. She was always happy, but then she was
always going through something, you know, like family situations,''
said the younger Wilkerson.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Wilkerson recalled Whitfield's daughter, Tizi Ingram,
and her daughter, Champagne.
</P>
<P>
   The little girl had ``bright eyes the size of half dollars,
velvety skin. She was an angel,'' Wilkerson said. Champagne's
mother, Tizi, was a Franklin High graduate who honored in math and
also helped her mother at the day care.
</P>
<P>
   Tizi Ingram ``had a gentle, quiet spirit,'' J.J. Wilkerson said.
``She was a really smart young lady.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to think that if something happened to Pat, I could
talk to her daughter,'' she said. ``But her daughter's gone, too.''
</P>
<P>
   As authorities removed the bodies from the home, neighbors
watched and cried. When Champagne was taken out, anyone who hadn't
yet cried, began to.
</P>
<P>
   ``They executed her. Who in the world would execute a little
girl?'' asked a a neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   The King County Medical Examiner will do autopsies Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors said Whitfield had run her day care for at least 10
years. Kathy Spears, spokeswoman for the state Department of Social
and Health Services, said Whitfield had had a license in the past,
but closed her facility in 1996. Last year, Whitfield received
another license and reopened her day care, Spears said.
</P>
<P>
   Pearl Holcomb, who has lived in the area more than 30 years,
said her granddaughter used to attend Whitfield's day care and that
this was the first crime to occur there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of frightening,'' she said. ``This is close to
home.''
</P>
<P>
   Rico, a stand-up comic who prefers using only his first name,
has lived near the victims on and off for the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a smart woman,'' he said. ``She was a beautiful and
strong black woman.''

HAIRDRESSER WHO TANGLED WITH SHERIFF TO GIVE FREE MAKEOVERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MEGAN RYSZKOWSKI  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Scottsdale hairstylist who scuffled with Sheriff Joe Arpaio in
a restaurant parking lot will have to snip his way out of his legal
tangle.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Huskisson avoided standing trial for aggravated assault by
entering a plea agreement Tuesday that includes giving free
haircuts and makeovers for inmates released from the county jail
system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sean's very talented. He suggested this after spending one
night in jail,'' said Huskisson's attorney, Michael Terribile. ``He
wants to help women coming out of jail by giving them makeovers.
Why not utilize his talents?''
</P>
<P>
   Huskisson, 27, who works at Giggles Hair Salon in Scottsdale,
normally charges up to $200 for makeovers.
</P>
<P>
   He was sentenced to 50 hours of community service, 18 months of
supervised probation, one day in jail and ordered to pay $40 a
month in restitution.
</P>
<P>
   Huskisson pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of disorderly
conduct, which carries a maximum prison term of six months. In
exchange, prosecutors dropped the more serious charges of
aggravated assault.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the sentence is heavier than necessary,'' said
Terribile, who asked the judge for only community service hours and
not probation. ``If it had been anybody else that Sean would have
been obnoxious with, this case would be filed in city court. It was
bad luck he happened to run into Sheriff Joe.''
</P>
<P>
   Huskisson was arrested last July after he punched Arpaio and the
sheriff's top aide, Dave Hendershott, as he was leaving the parking
lot of When in Naples Restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Huskisson said he had been drinking with some buddies to
celebrate the birth of his first child and was about to get behind
the wheel of his car when Hendershott attempted to stop him.
Huskisson became agitated and hit Hendershott, a police report
says.
</P>
<P>
   When Arpaio approached, witnesses claimed that Huskisson became
even more angry and punched Arpaio in the neck.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to extend my apologies,'' Huskisson told Judge
Mark Aceto of Maricopa County Superior Court on Tuesday. ``This has
been an embarrassment to me and my family. I meant no harm. I had
too much to drink and I'm very sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   Huskisson recorded a blood-alcohol level of 0.187 at the time of
his arrest. Arizona law presumes that anyone with a reading of 0.10
or above is intoxicated.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy County Attorney Louis Stalzer said the Sheriff's Office
welcomed Huskisson's offer of haircut and makeover services as part
of his community service. But he told the judge that Arpaio wanted
Huskisson to provide his services within the jail and Tent City.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, however, decided that Huskisson could perform the
service out of his salon. &QL;

UNOVA STOCK DIPS AS EARNINGS FALL BELOW EXPECTATIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GREGORY J. WILCOX  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Shares of Unova Inc., a $2 billion industrial
technology products maker, fell 7 percent Tuesday after the company
announced that second-quarter earnings would fall short of
analysts' estimates.
</P>
<P>
   A survey of analysts by First Call Inc. had pegged earnings at
14 cents a share for the second quarter. But the company said late
Monday that earnings would be in the 6 cents-a-share range. That
would be in line with first-quarter earnings.
</P>
<P>
   The company's stock closed Tuesday at $13.375, down $1, on
trading of 491,000 shares, nearly four times the average daily
volume. That's well below the 52-week high of $23.75.
</P>
<P>
   Woodland Hills-based Unova blamed the lackluster performance on
the same problems that impacted first-quarter earnings, which came
in 8 cents lower than in the year-ago period.
</P>
<P>
   Unova said it is still experiencing glitches with a new computer
system used to track orders, manufacturing and deliveries at its
Intermec Technologies subsidiary in Everett, Wash. And it is
dealing with diminished sales and downsizing at the recently
acquired Cincinnati machine tool division that makes equipment used
by other manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Problems associated with getting orders shipped on time at
Intermec has forced Unova to hire temporary workers and maintain
higher inventory levels, both expensive propositions.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to correct the problems could stretch into the third and
fourth quarters, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Unova has two basic product lines. The company makes
manufacturing systems and machine tools for the automotive,
aerospace and general metalworking markets. Its high-tech
operations make automated data collection, mobile computing,
wireless network and radio frequency identification systems for a
variety of uses.
</P>
<P>
   Dirk Koerber, Unova's chief financial officer, said turmoil in
Asian and Latin American financial markets is impacting the
Cincinnati operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the U.S. has looked like it was in great shape, factory
utilization in North America was at an eight-year low,'' he said.
``Farming exports came down last year and with that, obviously, the
farmers do not buy capital equipment like tractors.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the company said that at the end of last month, its
backlog was at a record level, helped by large systems contracts
won at the beginning of the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Alexander Paris at Barrington Research in Chicago said
the problems are fixable; it is just taking longer than expected to
accomplish.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are kind of temporary problems. Demand is good, and
they've got good products,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Unova has operations in seven states, Canada and five European
countries. The company employs about 10,000 people worldwide.

SLEEPWALKING DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Los Angeles Dodgers, contrary to popular
opinion, don't need a wakeup call. What's the use after they've
slept through a dozen?
</P>
<P>
   They need a fire alarm. And the flicker of flames and a whiff of
smoke to really give their hearts a jolt.
</P>
<P>
   They continue to excuse their .500 start with variations on
``There's a long way to go.'' The latest was manager Davey
Johnson's lullaby _ ``It's still very early'' _ after Monday's loss
to the Texas Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   It's later than they think.
</P>
<P>
   June is baseball's most deceptive month. When it begins, the
season really is young. Hall of Famers are batting .200 and rookies
are hitting .400. Luck and schedule strength haven't evened out
yet. When it ends, you're making plans for the All-Star break. And
the newspapers are handing out the C-minuses on the midterm report
cards.
</P>
<P>
   That quickly, you can go from slow-starting to slow-roasted.
</P>
<P>
   June cooked the Dodgers last year. It was a frantic month off
the field, where they dumped Hideo Nomo, lost Ramon Martinez to an
arm injury and fired manager Bill Russell and GM Fred Claire. It
was a snoozer on the field, where they kept a .500 pace and slipped
12{ games out of first place.
</P>
<P>
   June could kill them this year. Only more softly.
</P>
<P>
   Entering Tuesday's game, they were 2-4 for the month and stuck
at .500. And they'd better not be fooled by a quick glance at the
schedule ahead. Oakland, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia and San Diego
come up next. Soft touches? Look again.
</P>
<P>
   The A's, Pirates and Phillies have better records than the
Dodgers. Check the standings if you don't believe it. The Padres,
for their part, will come to town bearing a grudge. Or have you
forgotten their April win over Kevin Brown?
</P>
<P>
   After San Diego, the Dodgers will face San Francisco for the
first time this season, just about the time the Giants get Barry
Bonds back. Then June ends with two more games against the Padres.
</P>
<P>
   Remember what Eric Karros said after his throwing error
contributed to a May 9 loss to Florida: ``I don't think we've been
eliminated yet.'' In other words, Don't panic. The Dodgers were
17-14 then, in second place, 1{ games behind the Giants. No cause
for alarm.
</P>
<P>
   It's exactly one month later. They've gone 11-15, slipped to
third and lost 3{ games in the standings. Arizona has jumped over
them and the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   Karros' words are still technically correct: They haven't been
eliminated yet. But much more of this and they're in trouble. Look
at their history.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Dodgers have won pennants after sub-.500 Aprils.
They've won pennants after sub-.500 Augusts. They've won pennants
after sub-.500 Septembers and Octobers. But they've never won a
pennant after a losing June or July.
</P>
<P>
   That cliche, ``strength up the middle,'' applies to the schedule
as well as the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Either the Dodgers don't know it, or they're not good enough to
do anything about it.
</P>
<P>
   Is this all there is to Todd Hundley, a .226 hitter and a .137
thrower?
</P>
<P>
   Is Eric Young a winner's leadoff hitter, with his .365 on-base
percentage?
</P>
<P>
   Is Devon White's groin pull a case of bad luck, or something to
be expected from a 36-year-old center fielder?
</P>
<P>
   Is there really somebody called Chance Sanford on the roster, or
is he a Think Blue Week winner?
</P>
<P>
   If Brown's arrival really improved the pitching staff, then why
are the Dodgers on their way to the franchise's highest staff ERA
since 1958 in the Coliseum?
</P>
<P>
   By June 30, we should have an answer.
</P>
<P>
   The wakeup calls keep coming. The Dodgers are sleeping with the
covers over their heads.
</P>
<P>
   There was the day St. Louis' Shawon Dunston charged the Dodgers'
Jamie Arnold. That was supposed to light a fire under the Dodgers.
That was May 23. They're 6-8 since then.
</P>
<P>
   There was the firing of pitching coach Charlie Hough. That was
supposed to turn up the heat. That was May 26. They're 5-7 since
then.
</P>
<P>
   There was the Chan Ho Park-Tim Belcher brawl. That was supposed
to kick-start the Dodgers. That was Saturday. They're 0-3 since
then.
</P>
<P>
   What's it going to take to rouse these late sleepers? How about
a good look at the schedule? The season is getting away from them.
</P>
<P>
   A June snooze is as bad as a June swoon.

SABRES GET JUMP IN GAME 1
</HEADLINE>
 HKN-STARS-SABRES-BOS  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ For the favored Stars, the night was a series of missed
opportunities, a boatload of chances that went for naught.
</P>
<P>
   For the underdog Sabres, it was the continuation of a remarkable
Cinderella story, a chance early on to say, in essence, ``Take
that, all you nonbelievers.''
</P>
<P>
   The hero of Game 1 of the Stanley Cup finals Tuesday night was
Jason Woolley, a 29-year-old defenseman who has a keen sense of
when opportunity is knocking.
</P>
<P>
   It was Woolley, on a nice feed from forward Curtis Brown, who
came through for Buffalo, charging down the slot and firing a
one-timer between the legs of Dallas goalie Ed Belfour at 15:30 of
overtime to lift the Sabres to a 3-2 victory at Reunion Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good thing is we can't get swept now, anyways,'' quipped
Sabres coach Lindy Ruff, referring to the fact that the Eastern
Conference team has been swept in the finals the last three years.
``We eliminated that in one night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope to maybe sneak another one out of here but . . . the
East has been swept the last three years. We just won one for the
East.''
</P>
<P>
   The first two periods heavily favored the Stars. The combination
of a nine-day layoff between games and a young squad's Cup jitters
resulted in the Sabres struggling early and spending far too much
time in the penalty box. They were shorthanded for 11:42 of the
first 29:34. Fortunately for them, they had Dominik Hasek. Though
hampered by a sore groin, the goalie was utterly sensational at
times.
</P>
<P>
   Brett Hull put the Stars on the board at 10:17 of the first
period during a power play, his sixth goal of the postseason. But
midway through the third period, which was awful for the Stars and
meant a whole new life for the Sabres, Buffalo tied it on Stu
Barnes's strike. Wayne Primeau gave Buffalo its first lead of the
game at 13:37 on the power play. The desperate Stars rallied with
49 seconds left in regulation when Jere Lehtinen beat Hasek, tying
the game at 2-2 and sending it into overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Then Woolley pulled the Sabres through.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas had a chance to win midway through the overtime on a
power play that came courtesy of a foolish boarding penalty taken
by Geoff Sanderson, who drilled Richard Matvichuk from behind at
9:06.
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres staved off the penalty, and Sanderson, coming out of
the box, took off up ice with the puck and blasted a shot that
Belfour turned back. It was Sanderson who was denied by Belfour on
a breakaway with a chance to put the Sabres up, 3-1, at 16:50 of
the third. A few minutes later, Lehtinen tied it.
</P>
<P>
   But there were so many missed opportunities for the Stars. Too
much Hasek, too little finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought our team played a very, very strong hockey game,''
said Stars coach Ken Hitchcock. ``I thought we went a little bit
flat when they scored their first goal and we were in a little bit
of shock because I think that certainly in the first period and
second period that's as sound a hockey game as we've played. To
give up those two goals was a little bit of a shock.''
</P>
<P>
   Stars center Mike Modano, who had an excellent game, said the
loss was particularly painful because of the team's play in the
third and the fact that Dallas was only 1 for 10 on the man
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The third period was a bad period,'' he said. ``We got away
from our style of play. We lost our edge and let them back into the
game. We had our chances to put it away but we didn't take
advantage.''

WALL STREET DOWN ON DISNEY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURBANK, Calif. -- Wall Street turned its nose up Tuesday at
Walt Disney Co.'s Internet plans, knocking the entertainment giant
stock down 4 percent in the wake of disclosing it may buy all of
Web partner Infoseek Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Disney, which made the announcement after the market
closed Monday, declined $1.25 to $29.625, off 30 percent from its
all-time high 13 months ago. The issue hit a 1999 low last week at
$28.8125, then rose Friday on speculation of a major restructuring
or spin-off of Internet assets.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Cesinger, an entertainment analyst with investment bank
Greif &AMP; Co., said Wall Street's enthusiasm is clearly limited for
Disney buying the 57 percent of Infoseek it does not own. Such a
deal probably would cost Disney more than $2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Wall Street is looking for Disney to show strength in
its core businesses,'' Cesinger said. ``Disney's already made a
very sizable commitment to the Internet, and they don't really need
to own Infoseek outright. I'm not sure it's a good strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Burbank-based Disney have been depressed over the past
year mostly by worries about the high programming costs and lagging
ratings at ABC and softness in consumer products. Meanwhile,
``pure-play'' Internet stocks have soared, but concerns persist
that Internet assets might be overvalued, Cesinger said.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, Disney shares could have been depressed Tuesday by
longtime bull Stewart Halpern of ING Barings Furman Selz cutting
his earnings estimates by 4 cents for the fiscal year ending Sept.
30, to 66 cents a share due to a bearish outlook for its
consumer-products sector. He also sliced 6 cents from his fiscal
2000 estimate to 77 cents for the same reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now see weakness in Disney's highly profitable
merchandising/licensing business as more fundamental and severe
than the `Star Wars' crowding-out perspective,'' Halpern said. ``We
expect this weaker-than-expected trend in merchandising/licensing
to continue.''
</P>
<P>
   Halpern repeated his ``buy'' rating with a 12-month target in
the low $40s, indicating the price will rise as investors begin to
give full credit for the ``hidden'' value of Disney's Internet
assets.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's major new licensing property this year is the
characters from the film ``Tarzan,'' due out June 18. Early reviews
have been positive, but the toys face a difficult task in catching
young customers' attention amid positive reception for ``Star
Wars'' toys.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, shares of Infoseek Corp. rose 13 percent Tuesday,
gaining $5.625 to $48.625 and driving up its market capitalization
to $1.73 billion from $1.53 billion. Disney presumably would have
to pay a premium for Infoseek to drop a provision in last year's
deal that prevented Disney from boosting its 43 percent share until
2001.
</P>
<P>
   Infoseek shares are still down 42 percent since it jointly
launched the Go Network portal site in January with Disney.

SOX OUT OF THEIR LEAGUE 
</HEADLINE>
 BB-RED SOX-EXPOS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ This interleague stuff didn't take long to get old,
did it?
</P>
<P>
   Seems like only yesterday that the Red Sox were knocking down
the big shots in the American League with an ease bordering on
insouciance.
</P>
<P>
   But remove them from their usual little milieu, and suddenly the
Sox have taken on the aspect of accidental tourists, fumbling for
their passports, stumbling on the language, and bumbling down paths
that looked harmless in the guidebooks.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox took another detour in the wrong direction Tuesday
night with their fourth straight loss, a 5-1 beating administered
by the Montreal Expos.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox have lost four in a row to National League teams, two to
the Braves, the so-called America's Team, and now two to the Expos,
a team that only 7,233 Canadians chose to call their own Tuesday
night in Olympic Stadium. And that number shrinks when you count
the Vermonters in the house who showed up to root for the Sox.
</P>
<P>
   The only reason the Sox remain in first is that their closest
pursuers in the AL East, the New York Yankees, are having their own
crossover problems. The Bombers blew a 5-0 lead and fell to the
Phillies, 11-5, their third straight defeat to their National
League cousins.
</P>
<P>
   No one appeared more lost here Tuesday night than Jeff Frye, the
miscast third baseman, or Jim Corsi, the downcast reliever, during
the Expos' three-run uprising in the eighth inning that took the
air out of a pitching duel in which the Sox trailed only 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   Frye, playing because John Valentin was laid up with a sore
groin, couldn't get Vladimir Guerrero's chopper out of his glove
after a ground single by Rondell White began the inning against
Corsi, who had taken over after seven strong innings by Tim
Wakefield. Wakefield, who allowed just five hits while striking out
nine, wound up paying dearly for one misspent knuckler, the one
Guerrero drove for a two-run home run in the sixth to wipe out a
1-0 Sox lead.
</P>
<P>
   With two on and none out against Corsi, Manny Martinez bunted
the runners over _ the sacrifice bunt still being an art form
practiced with some degree of competence in the National League _
and Corsi issued an intentional walk to Shane Andrews, loading the
bases.
</P>
<P>
   Corsi fell behind, 3-and-1, to the next hitter, Chris Widger,
who had entered the game batting .163 (7 for 43) with runners in
scoring position but drove a full-count fastball to left for a
two-run single that made it 4-1.
</P>
<P>
   After another base hit by Mike Mordecai and a fly out, Frye
bobbled Orlando Cabrera's grounder to third, then threw late to
second on an attempted force as another run scored.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was 3 feet away from being the goat or the hero,'' said
Corsi, who lately has had the look of a pitcher who should be
wearing a bell around his neck. ``The ball's moving good, the mound
feels good, I just have to get them to hit it at people. I can't
control where they hit it.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be true, but Expos pitchers have had no such difficulty
with Sox hitters. Rookie righthander Dan Smith, making his big
league debut Tuesday &UR;  &LR; night, gave up a run in the first inning on a
single to Jose Offerman, a double by Brian Daubach, and a single by
Nomar Garciaparra. He then set down the next 20 Sox batters until
being lifted for a pinch hitter in the seventh, finishing with nine
strikeouts while not walking a man.
</P>
<P>
   In the series opener Monday, another kid, former Sox prospect
Carl Pavano, retired 18 of 19 in one stretch. In their last five
games, the Sox are batting .199 (39 for 196) as a team.
</P>
<P>
   ``You like to play behind a guy who has that type of intensity
and tempo,'' Expos manager Felipe Alou said of Smith, a 23-year-old
righthander from Girard, Kan., who until this season had a losing
record in the minor leagues. ``You don't have to be Pedro Martinez
or Kevin Brown. Just throw strikes.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially on a night when Boston batters were missing most of
them. In all, 13 Red Sox went down on strikes, including the last
four, the final three succumbing to Expos closer Ugueth Urbina, who
has a name like a Secretary-General of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Daubach, the Belleville Basher, fanned three times. Garciaparra
fanned to end the game. The first three batters in the order _
Offerman, Damon Buford, and Daubach _ combined to whiff seven
times.
</P>
<P>
   Those kinds of numbers hardly make for conversation pieces,
which apparently is why most of the Sox who played Tuesday night,
with the exception of Wakefield, Corsi, and catcher Jason Varitek,
didn't stray from the shelter of the players-only lounge. Since
they couldn't hit _ which is an active verb _ the Sox must have
figured they didn't have much use for adjectives, adverbs, or (a
Jimy Williams favorite) gerunds, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some good at-bats in the first inning, then he retired
a bunch in a row,'' said manager Williams, who threw extra batting
practice for Varitek and rookie Trot Nixon but might need to
schedule double sessions this afternoon if every Sox batter who's
struggling shows up for extra tutoring. ``We didn't sniff too much
after that.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're good hitters. They'll come out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   And if they don't? Well, there's always Pedro. It's his turn
Wednesday night.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL SULLIVAN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
DALLAS _ The word had come up early, and it had become a sore point
with a No. 7 seed that had made such a remarkable run through the
Eastern Conference, only to be told once again it didn't belong.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tuesday night, then, Lindy Ruff brought it up himself. All of a
sudden, it didn't sound so bad in light of the Buffalo Sabres' 3-2
overtime win over the Dallas Stars in Game 1 of the Stanley Cup
Finals at Reunion Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good thing is we can't get swept now,'' the Sabres coach
said with a smile. ``We eliminated that in one night.''
</P>
<P>
   One long and intense night, ending with the heavily favored
Stars contemplating their mortality in a series that no longer
looks so one-sided.
</P>
<P>
   Just seconds after Dominik Hasek made the last of his 35 saves,
robbing Dallas' Pat Verbeek from point-blank, Jason Woolley ripped
a shot from the high slot that got under Dallas' Ed Belfour 15
minutes, 30 seconds into overtime. Given little chance against the
two-time Presidents' Trophy winners, the Sabres drew first blood.
</P>
<P>
   Game 2 is here Thursday night, and suddenly a Stars team many
deemed capable of sweeping this series turns its thoughts to
earning a split of the first two games at home.
</P>
<P>
   For that, they can thank Hasek, who kept his team in the game as
the Sabres weathered two periods of intense pressure before
beginning to turn things their way.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as their goaltender, if we have to get 70 (shots) to
score three, we'll get 70,'' Dallas coach Ken Hitchcock said after
watching his team come up dry on nine of 10 power plays. ``We have
to find a way to get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   Woolley's shot capped an evening that offered a bit of something
for everyone. Hasek stopped all but those two Stars shots but gave
up the tying goal with less than a minute remaining in regulation.
His teammates managed only 24 shots on Belfour, but that would be
enough.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars had the best of it for two periods, outshooting the
Sabres 23-9 and keeping the play in Buffalo's end most of the way.
To that point, the Sabres looked like the low seed that entered
these playoffs with limited expectations, but Dallas had only a 1-0
lead on Brett Hull's first-period goal to show for its trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we could have gotten that second goal, we might have been
able to open it up a little more,'' Hitchcock said. ``But they were
able to hang in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Things changed quickly in the third period. First, Stu Barnes
fired a shot from about 20 feet that beat Belfour high and to the
glove side, tying the score at 8:33.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we went into a little bit of shock after that first
goal,'' Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   A little more than five minutes later, Wayne Primeau put Buffalo
ahead when he poked a rebound past Belfour at 13:37. That was
looking like the game-winner until the final minute of regulation,
when the Stars' No. 1 line came through again.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Mike Modano went behind the net, turned and found
Jere Lehtinen in front of Hasek. Lehtinen took a perfect pass and
slipped it by Hasek low and under the goalie's glove at 19:11,
sending the game to overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas outshot the Sabres 7-5 in the extra period, but Woolley's
was the only one that counted.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have that many chances, that many just-abouts,
sometimes those things come back and haunt you,'' Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   Any concerns the Stars would be flat coming off the emotional
seven-game series with Colorado were quelled early. Dallas took the
offensive from the start and dominated the first period, keeping
the puck in the Sabres' end most of the 20 minutes and outshooting
Buffalo 11-5.
</P>
<P>
   ``The less time they have with the puck, the better for us,''
Modano said.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo might have broken through earlier. The Sabres got the
puck past Belfour at 4:53 of the second period, but winger Vaclav
Varada was called for goalie interference for bumping Belfour. The
Buffalo bench complained Belfour had taken a dive, and replays
seemed to support the contention, but the goal didn't count.
</P>
<P>
   It was one of the Sabres' few real chances through 40 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Sabres were just a shot away going into the final
period of regulation in a game the Stars had dominated in just
about every other respect. That shot finally came 8:33 into the
third when Barnes pulled Buffalo even.
</P>
<P>
   Considering the Stars' struggles with Hasek, Primeau's go-ahead
goal seemed to be more than enough to get the Sabres out with a
win. A few minutes later, Buffalo missed a chance to add to the
lead when Geoff Sanderson got loose on a breakaway, only to have
Belfour come up with a save that would look even bigger soon
enough.
</P>
<P>
   With the seconds ticking down, Lehtinen finally got the puck
past ``The Dominator,'' forcing the OT.
</P>
<P>
   ``The far side was open, and it was a great pass from Mike,''
Lehtinen said.
</P>
<P>
   But the game-winner would be considerably more elusive. Hasek's
save on Verbeek was a double deflection the goalie knocked away as
he rolled over.
</P>
<P>
   The near miss would haunt.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Thursday night takes on a whole new importance.

   KUMANOVO, Macedonia _ Two days after a first round of talks
ended in deadlock, NATO and Yugoslav generals met here again in
talks that dragged on into Wednesday morning to discuss the
withdrawal of Yugoslav and Serbian forces from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   At 7 a.m., after a negotiating session that dragged on through
the night, NATO officials said they were cautiously optimistic that
the Serbs would sign the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The main sticking points, they said, remained the ``timing and
sequencing of events'' meaning exactly when the Serbs would
withdraw, NATO bombing would pause, and a U.N. Security Council
resolution would be enacted. NATO has said the Serbs must begin to
withdraw before the bombing will halt.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav officers _ mostly the same who took part in the
earlier meetings _ arrived in vehicles just after 9 p.m. on Tuesday
at a hangar here in the center of a muddy French helicopter base.
Lt. Gen. Sir Michael Jackson, the Briton who is to lead the NATO
force, arrived minutes later by helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslavs spent the next several hours in a small trailer
reviewing proposed changes to the agreement they had rejected.
</P>
<P>
   At 1 a.m., three senior members of the Yugoslav delegation
crossed into Yugoslavia to consult with officials in Belgrade over
secure telephone lines. They returned an hour later.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gen. Robert H. Foglesong, a military adviser to Deputy
Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, met with the Yugoslavs on Monday
and Tuesday, NATO officials said.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday morning, NATO officials continued to insist that
they were not negotiating, but admitted that they were eager for a
settlement. ``Quite honestly, we don't want this to fall apart; we
want this to happen,'' said a NATO official. ``We are not
negotiating but we are not inflexible when it comes down to finer
details.''  &QL;

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
DALLAS _ Listen, pardner. It's about time the NHL got this thing
right.
</P>
<P>
   Got the puck to stop here, I mean.
</P>
<P>
   After all, this isn't just the Lone Star State. It's also home
to the Fort Worth Brahmas, Austin Ice Bats, Amarillo Rattlers and
Corpus Christi IceRays.
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention the champion Houston Aeros of the IHL.
</P>
<P>
   Truth is, Jean-Claude, there is more professional hockey played
in the state of Texas than in all of Canada. You could look it up.
</P>
<P>
   Which was, of course, the vision of Lord Billy Bob Stanley way
back in the 19th century when he and some ol' boys actually
invented the game one slow day out on the prairie by using the butt
end of their rifles to swat buffalo chips through the open flap of
an abandoned tepee.
</P>
<P>
   Next thing you know, Billy Bob's missus gets sick and tired of
that big silver spit bucket from his chaw constantly tipping over
onto the floor of the ranch house and makes him give it away to a
friend who's going on a trail ride up north.
</P>
<P>
   Now, at long last, it returns.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas vs. Buffalo. Where are Troy Aikman, Emmitt Smith, Jim
Kelly and Thurman Thomas? It sounds like an old Super Bowl rematch.
We know how those turned out, and according to the form chart
Dallas should come out on top again. But that was football, and
this is, well, almost-summertime hockey in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   And Sabres goalie Dominik Hasek put on one of his trademark
late-game performances with circus stops, and then defenseman Jason
Woolley darted down the left side to beat Eddie Belfour 15:30 into
overtime and give Buffalo a 3-2 victory in the series opener.
</P>
<P>
   Go figure the Stars, who had the game under their thumb for more
than two periods and let it get away in front of a raucous home
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   And while you're at it, try to figure out this winter wonder
called the NHL, supposedly the pride and passion of all of frigid
Canada and the rest of the places above the Arctic Circle. It goes
belly up in frozen outposts like Winnipeg and Minneapolis and then
becomes the coolest thing in June since the double-wide
refrigerator in a land where an afternoon high of 80 degrees is
considered a cold snap.
</P>
<P>
   So along came Tuesday night at Reunion Arena, and the Stanley
Cup Finals will never be the same. This was more, much more, than
just faded jeans and ostrich-skin boots, 10-gallon hats and a few
thousand natives trying hard to pronounce names like Smehlik and
Zhitnik through a drawl.
</P>
<P>
   The Stanley Cup Texas-style is Hawaiian-print shirts, tank tops,
silicone and more heat than a mouthful of jalapeos. It's the Stars
taking the ice to the brain-splitting sounds of heavy-metal band
Pantera, whose drummer, Vinnie Paul, grew up in Arlington,
befriended Dallas defenseman Craig Ludwig a few years back and has
become an unofficial mascot of sorts. It's equal parts music video,
exotic dance club and Friday night football frenzy, all played on
an ice surface that melts faster than a frozen margarita at a
high-noon barbecue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, it's June and it's Texas,'' said one NHL official. ``It
was 90 degrees down here two months ago, and the ice was already in
bad shape. You just deal with it the best way you know how.''
</P>
<P>
   Which maybe explains why the Sabres brought in No. 81, Miroslav
Satan, to play the wing.
</P>
<P>
   ``They ask me, `Is that really your name?''' he says.
</P>
<P>
   It's pronounced Shuh-tan. But you can call him Lucifer.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, the favored Stars temporarily avoided the hell of
surrendering the home-ice advantage in the series opener when Jere
Lehtinen's tying goal with 49 seconds left in regulation time
rescued them.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the Stars found themselves happy to be headed for overtime
after they had controlled most of the first 48 minutes with their
tight defensive style but managed only a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   When Dallas couldn't close the deal, the Sabres got back-to-back
goals from Stu Barnes and Wayne Primeau in the space of five
minutes, and Lehtinen's score could only force overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Or Hasek-time. The Dominator was dominating. Stifling.
Suffocating. Impossible. Impenetrable.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars had their OT chances. So many. Pat Verbeek was point
blank, and Hasek stopped him. Standing up and lying on his back
with the puck rolling across his chest, arms and legs flailing.
Then Woolley broke free, and it was over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes when you get that many chances, that many
just-abouts, it can turn on you,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said.
``But I think this is the way the series is going to be. Both teams
passionate, both physical, both putting a lot on the line.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the Stanley Cup Finals Texas-style, extra spicy.

November.
</P>
<P>
   A DANGEROUS FRIEND. By Ward Just. (Peter Davison/Houghton

<P>
   DEVIL'S VALLEY. By Andre Brink. (Harcourt Brace, $24.) A

as a cleaning lady is the victim of a struggle between her instinct
for self-invention and her inability to devise a suitable self.
</P>
<P>
   ENGLAND, ENGLAND. By Julian Barnes. (Knopf, $23.) This satirical
novel suggests that while there may always be an England, its
immediate future looks more like a theme park than an empire.

<P>
   FOR THE RELIEF OF UNBearable Urges. By Nathan Englander. (Knopf,
$22.) Ambitious short stories by a 29-year-old former yeshiva
student from New York, now living in secular Israel; his characters

of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   FREEDOM SONG: Three Novels. By Amit Chaudhuri. (Knopf, $24.)

in any particular story than in the bits of life and temporary
states out of which lives are made.
</P>
<P>
   THE GROUND BENEATH HER FEET. By Salman Rushdie. (Holt, $27.50.)
Gods, humans and rock performers mix and match conduct _ some
horrific, some charming _ in a novel not of our world but of a
dangerous, fragile world, riven with earthquakes and set at a
refractive angle to ours.
</P>
<P>
   HEAVY WATER: And Other Stories. By Martin Amis. (Harmony, $21.)

eye are applied to issues like sexual norms, the rewards of poetry
and the date of the end of the world.
</P>
<P>
   HUMAN VOICES. By Penelope Fitzgerald. (Mariner/ Houghton
Mifflin, paper, $12.) In her wry novel set during the London blitz,
the author uses the BBC's Broadcasting House as a microcosm in
which the 9 o'clock news kept Britain abreast of the progress of
its finest hour.
</P>
<P>
   INCUBUS. By Ann Arensberg. (Knopf, $24.) Symptoms of witchcraft
(wilted crops, monstrous births), followed by bodiless sexual
entities, descend on a Maine town, apparently as metaphors for its
social inadequacies, in this post-modern psychological Gothic
novel.
</P>
<P>
   THE INTUITIONIST. By Colson Whitehead. (Anchor/ Doubleday,
$19.95.) An ingenious, original first novel that pits empiricism
against intuition in elevator inspection by way of approaching
racial struggle and social progress.
</P>
<P>
   THE JEW OF NEW YORK. By Ben Katchor. (Pantheon, $20.) Set in a
shadowy, understated, mysteriously opaque New York of 1830, this
graphic novel revolves, often at some distance, around a plan for a
Jewish refuge upstate and a wandering, disgraced kosher slaughterer
who has briefly been there.
</P>
<P>
   A JOURNEY TO THE END OF THE MILLENNIUM. By A. B. Yehoshua.
(Doubleday, $24.95.) Starting in A.D. 999, the preeminent Israeli
modernist whisks some Jewish merchants across Europe to expose and

</P>
<P>
   KAFKA'S CURSE. By Achmat Dangor. (Pantheon, $22.) A novel of
magical fables in which the lies and lunacy of apartheid in the old
South Africa continue their work in the new _ when, for instance, a
man who had faked his race for a higher notch is metamorphosed into
a tree.
</P>
<P>
   LITTLE GREEN MEN. By Christopher Buckley. (Random House,
$24.95.) A witty, high-spirited political satire whose pretext is
that flying saucers are a hoax by a government organization so
secret even the president doesn't know about it.
</P>
<P>
   LOUSE. By David Grand. (Arcade, $23.95.) An eerie and angry
first novel that mirrors the anguish of workers in an age of job
insecurity, video surveillance and shameless corporate euphemisms;
its finest character is a monstrous capitalist modeled on the aging
Howard Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   LOVE IN A DEAD LANGUAGE: A Romance. By Lee Siegel. (University
of Chicago, $25.) An ambitious and imaginative novel masquerading
as a commentary on the Kama Sutra that becomes a literary puzzle in
which Nabokov, Joyce and Philip Roth provide the clues.
</P>
<P>
   MR. DARWIN'S SHOOTER. By Roger McDonald. (Atlantic Monthly,
$25.) An intellectually curious novel in which a devout seaman's
life is distorted by helping Darwin's research and later believing
Darwin meant all along to prove there is no God.
</P>
<P>
   MUSIC FOR TORCHING. By A. M. Homes. (Rob Weisbach/Morrow, $26.)
Another provocative novel from the author who was almost banned in
Britain, this time about a very odd couple in a middle-class
suburbia that even Cheever never imagined.
</P>
<P>
   THE MUSIC LESSON. By Katharine Weber. (Crown, $21.) An elegant,
suspenseful novel about a New York art historian who becomes part
of an I.R.A. plot to steal a Vermeer painting.
</P>
<P>
   MY PEOPLE'S WALTZ. By Dale Ray Phillips. (Norton, $22.95.) A
first collection of short stories, all concerning a family of
bighearted sinners and their fortunes, which run to bad debts, bad
love affairs and bad fishing trips but are always supported by a
misguided capacity for hope.
</P>
<P>
   THE NIGHT INSPECTOR. By Frederick Busch. (Harmony, $23.) A Union
sniper in the Civil War, encased in a mask to hide his
disfigurement from a wound that ended his Army career, makes
unlikely friends with a famous author down on his luck who sounds a
lot like Melville.
</P>
<P>
   NOVEMBER 1916. The Red Wheel: Knot II. By Aleksandr
Solzhenitsyn. (Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux, $35.) Disbelief is
suspended in this huge novel as the mass of muddle and detail
confronting ordinary Russians transcends the reader's knowledge of
what really ensued.
</P>
<P>
   OPENED GROUND: Selected Poems, 1966-1996. By Seamus Heaney.
(Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux, $25.) A selection from earlier books,
along with a few previously uncollected poems and his 1995 Nobel
Prize address, that eloquently confirms Heaney's status as the most
skillful and profound poet writing in English.
</P>
<P>
   ORIGINAL BLISS. By A. L. Kennedy. (Knopf, $21.) A novel by a
Glaswegian woman in which another Glaswegian woman, hungry for love
and touch, enters into a dark romance with a pop-psych guru, more
or less arranged, she understands, by divine providence.
</P>
<P>
   OUT OF THE WOODS: Stories. By Chris Offutt. (Simon &AMP; Schuster,
$21.) Lean, brilliant examinations of romantic obsessions whose
love objects are not men and women but the whole state of Kentucky
and in particular its landscape.
</P>
<P>
   THE PECULIAR MEMORIES OF THOMAS PENMAN. By Bruce Robinson.
(Overlook, $24.95.) This first novel by the writer and director of
``Withnail and I'' conveys an implausible empathy for a horrid
British schoolboy searching for personal identity in the grim,
unregretted 1950's.
</P>
<P>
   A PRAYER FOR THE DYING. By Stewart O'Nan. (Holt, $22.) In a
novel that explores both the nature of evil and the limits of human
endurance, a Civil War veteran must save a small Midwestern town
beset by fire and plague _ catastrophes with mutually exclusive
solutions _ or go mad trying.
</P>
<P>
   THE RIVER SOUND: Poems. By W. S. Merwin. (Knopf, $23.) In his
70's, a poet who has won most of the prizes is still at work on the
grieving that adheres to daily life, though part of his project is
now to discern how ``the pain of learning what is lost'' is
``transformed into light at last.''
</P>
<P>
   THE SEA CAME IN AT MIDNIGHT. By Steve Erickson. (Bard/Avon,
$23.) Several stories mesh together, or fail to do so, at the level
of echo and metaphor rather than plot in this firmly apocalyptic
novel at whose center is a dislocated girl who sells memories in a
Japanese brothel.
</P>
<P>
   THE SILENT DUCHESS. By Dacia Maraini. (Feminist Press, $19.95.)
In this novel by one of Italy's most prominent writers, an
18th-century Sicilian noblewoman's refusal to speak is depicted in
a slyly suspenseful story of grace and endurance.
</P>
<P>
   SINGLE &AMP; SINGLE. By John le Carre. (Scribner, $26.)
International finance and Oedipal tensions form the backdrop for
the new novel by the fictional spymaster.

MARINERS CLIMB ALL OVER ROCKIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ This is what exhaustion looks like: Tom Lampkin pulling
into third base on a stand-up triple in the seventh inning, and
doing it a mile above sea level. The Mariners catcher, who admits
he's ``not the most fleet of foot,'' had suffered six innings of
foul tips and short hops before going for the triple in the seventh
Tuesday night, but he knew he had to get there.
</P>
<P>
   As physically tiring as Coors Field can be, it's even even
tougher psychologically.
</P>
<P>
   ``This ballpark is so mentally draining,'' said Lampkin, a
former National Leaguer, after the Mariners downed the Colorado
Rockies, 10-5. ``I've played here so many times, and there are days
when you get a six-spot in the first inning, like we did tonight,
and they come back and score eight or nine runs in the eighth. When
you play games here, you've got to be ready to face that.''
</P>
<P>
   Facing it for the M's Tuesday night was right-hander Frankie
Rodriguez, who was making his first Seattle start. The Mariners
gave him a six-run lead, thanks in part to the first of two homers
by Ken Griffey Jr., who now is tied with Tampa Bay's Jose Canseco
for the major league lead with 22.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rockies went right to work on Rodriguez. They had scored
twice and had runners at first and second by the time they'd sent
five batters to the plate. Then Rodriguez escaped the inning by
getting Todd Helton to ground into a double play, preserving a 6-2
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Lampkin told his starter after the inning that although no lead
is safe in Colorado, all Rodriguez needed was to keep making
pitches; he was not hit hard in the inning. That's just what
Rodriguez did, working five innings and allowing only one more run.
He never once shook off Lampkin on pitch selection.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez was buoyed by his early lead. It was exactly what he'd
envisioned when the Mariners claimed him off waivers from the
Minnesota Twins on May 26.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was on the other side, pitching against the Mariners, and
sometimes you would sit in the dugout and just wonder what it would
be like to pitch for them, with that kind of firepower behind
you,'' he said. ``It allows you to pitch aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   That Mariner offense overwhelmed Rockies rookie Mark Brownson,
who allowed consecutive singles to open the game, then took on
Griffey. He fell behind 2-and-0, then hung a 66 mph curveball that
Griffey ripped into the right field bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you get away with pitches,'' said Brownson. ``I
didn't get away with anything tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   No kidding. Butch Huskey pounded a solo homer, John Mabry
doubled, Lampkin singled him home, and two batters later, Rodriguez
had his first major league hit, a run-scoring single up the middle
that knocked out Brownson. Rodriguez, a former shortstop, said he
was too nervous to ask for the ball until the inning was over.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez's single extended the hitting streak for Mariner
starting pitchers to four games. Coming into the game, all other
American League pitchers had combined for one hit.
</P>
<P>
   That was not the only statistical oddity. With four innings to
finish up, Cloude recorded his first professional save.
</P>
<P>
   Also, first baseman David Segui committed just his second error
of the season, one more than he had all of last year.
</P>
<P>
   Blinded by the setting sun in the second inning, Segui reached
for the throw by third baseman Mabry after a Vinny Castilla
grounder. He said he could not see it for the final 10 feet, and
was surprised he even caught it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never played in anything that bad; it'll be real fun
tomorrow,'' said Segui, referring to today's game, which starts 90
minutes earlier than yesterday's. ``I couldn't even see Alex
(Rodriguez, the shortstop) or the third baseman. I've never been
scared to play first base before, but I was petrified that they
were going to hit it over there.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Lou Piniella was also uncomfortable, but for a different
reason. Like Lampkin, he's aware of the perils of mile-high
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't feel comfortable until the last out was made,''
Piniella said. ``I read some of (Rockies manager Jim) Leyland's
quotes, about how he `perseveres.' There's no question you have to
keep scoring runs here.''
</P>
<P>
   And as a pitching staff, you have to prevent them. Ironic, then,
that this is the park in which the Mariners finally brought their
earned run average below 6.00. It stands at 5.92 after a pair of
well-pitched games.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the important thing,'' said Griffey of the staff's
success. ``Pitching's going to win.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners (30-27) are three games over .500 for the first
time since the end of the 1997 season.

RANGERS OUTLAST DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Los Angeles Dodgers have this knack for
teasing, adding drama, that makes winning exciting and losing most
agonizing.
</P>
<P>
   Trenidad Hubbard was tagged out after oversliding second base
for the second out of the ninth inning, but Eric Young followed
with a solo homer off Texas Rangers closer John Wetteland.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't much matter, though, as Rafael Palmeiro singled in a
run in the top of the 13th and the Texas Rangers beat the Dodgers
7-6 Tuesday at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   It drops the Dodgers (28-29) below the .500 mark for the first
time since April 26 when they were 9-10.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just the kind of season he's been having,'' said
Rangers manager Johnny Oates, who has used Palmeiro as a DH until
interleague play becasue of an injury. ``Every night I'm not sure
he's going tyo play until game time. But he's always there at the
end.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers had the leadoff batter on via walks in both the 11th
and 12th innings but couldn't get a two-out hit to score the
winning run. Mark McLemore began the winning rally with a one-out
single. He was erased on Rusty Greer's fielder's choice.
Pinch-hitter Gregg Zaun walked and Palmeiro singled sharply to
right field. Raul Mondesi had a chance to catch Greer at the plate
on Palmeiro's hit but his throw was up the third base line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to make excuses, but the ground was a little wet
and the ball slipped,'' Raul Mondesi said. ``If I make a good throw
I get him, but I can't make perfect throws all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan Mills (1-1) allowed the two-out hit to Palmeiro in his
second inning of relief. It was the only run the Dodgers' bullpen
allowed in 81/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Texas' Jeff Zimmerman (6-0) pitched two scoreless innings of
relief to remain undefeated. Mike Munoz pitched the 13th inning for
his first save.
</P>
<P>
   Young's second homer of the season represented Wetteland's
second blown save in 22 opportunities. It's similar to the Dodgers'
4-3 loss to Houston on May 20th when Tripp Cromer homered Astros
closer Billy Wagner in the 9th only to for the Dodgers to lose in
the 10th.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a flashback,'' Young said. ``We kept battling back, but
they kept battling back too _ but they got one more run.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers pulled within a run at 6-5 in the eighth inning on
Raul Mondesi's 19th homer of the season. Mondesi, who had a two-run
triple in the third inning, hit the first pitch Texas reliever Rob
Crabtree threw.
</P>
<P>
   Texas right fielder Juan Gonzalez hit his 16th homer of the
season in the first inning. He was ejected by home-plate umpire
Wally Bell in the ninth after being called out on strikes for the
second time in three innings. Though he walked straight to the
dugout, he left his bat at home plate.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers were forced to try to come back for a second time
after the Rangers scored three times in the fifth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers starter Darren Dreifort got the two outs that should
have been integral to success. The Rangers got the first two
runners on base in the fifth, but Dreifort retired Rusty Greer and
Gonzalez. Two-thirds of a great escape were done before sudden
nemesis Rafael Palmeiro batted.
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro had three hits and an RBI in the series opener, and he
didn't let Dreifort off the hook either. Palmeiro singled to
right-center to score Tom Goodwin and tie the score 4-4. So close
to being the turning point for the Dodgers, it turned the other way
for the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort didn't make it out of the inning. He had trouble
fielding Ivan Rodriguez's come-backer as the Rangers went ahead 5-4
on the infield single. Todd Zeile followed with a basehit to right
in which Mondesi fired to catcher Todd Hundley in an effort to get
Palmeiro at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   The throw was in time, but Hundley, playing for the first time
since injuring his left wrist in a home plate collision against
Pittsburgh last Wednesday, dropped the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers manager Davey Johnson summoned Jamie Arnold from the
bullpen to end another start for Dreifort prematurely. Dreifort
allowed six runs on nine hits in 42/3 innings. But the relief
contingent of Jamie Arnold, Mike Maddux, Doug Bochtler, Jeff Shaw
and Alan Mills didn't allow a run for the next 71/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, the Rangers activated Mike Morgan for the
start. The right-hander was on the 15-day disabled list with
inflammation in his right shin, had allowed eight earned runs in
two-thirds of an inning in his last start and opponents were
hitting .324 against him.
</P>
<P>
   It took the Dodgers until the third inning to inflict some
damage upon Morgan, and by then the Rangers had a 3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Goodwin led off the game with a single, stole second and
moved to third on Hundley's throwing error. He scored on Mark
McLemore's ground out. Gonzalez's put the Rangers ahead 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers added a run in the third on Greer's RBI double
before the Dodgers got to Morgan in the bottom of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbard, starting in center field for Devon White, doubled to
lead off the inning and eventually scored when Morgan's spikes got
caught on the mound for a balk. Jose Vizcaino and Gary Sheffield
walked and Mondesi tied the game 3-3 with a triple to left-center.
</P>
<P>
   An inning later the Dodgers took the lead and knocked Morgan out
of the game, which may have been the biggest detriment. Young
delivered the RBI single through the right side to put the Dodgers
up 4-3.

STARS POWERLESS IN GAME 1 LOSS
</HEADLINE>
 CUP STARS SIDEBAR-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAULA CABALLERO 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Remember the powerless play of the Dallas Stars?
Remember the 2-of-22 performance against Edmonton and the 3-of-28
performance against St. Louis?
</P>
<P>
   It's baaaaaack.
</P>
<P>
   During the Sabres' 3-2 overtime victory Tuesday night, the Stars
were 1-of-10 on the power play. Buffalo all but lived in the
penalty box for the first two periods, but the best the Stars could
manage was a one-goal lead in the first period, earned by Brett
Hull on their first power play.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just wanted to move with the puck quick, get some shots and
traffic,'' Mike Modano said. ``When we do that, plays like the one
to Brett open up.''
</P>
<P>
   The remaining nine opportunities, instead, closed down _
including a four-minute power play resulting from defenseman James
Patrick's high stick on the Stars' Pat Verbeek.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars sat on a one-goal lead until it wasn't a lead anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we got a little bit in a situation where we tried to
protect in the third period,'' Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock doesn't like his team sitting on a lead at all, let
alone a one-goal lead against a slick-skating team like Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we could have got that second goal, we could maybe made
them open it up a little bit more, but they were able to hang in
there and hang in there,'' Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   Aggressive penalty kills have given the Stars fits all season,
Hitchcock has said. But Hitchcock said that wasn't the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference in our power play is that we didn't score on
quality chances,'' Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres' penalty kill did get the job done, however, most
memorably when defenseman Richard Smehlik fished behind Dominik
Hasek to rescue Hull's shot off the goal line where it sat, sending
it to safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``Second and third efforts, that's what you have to count on,''
Sabres center Michael Peca said. ``You've got to battle for loose
pucks and then clear the zone as much as you can and make them work
for it. We were working extremely hard and did a good job.''
</P>
<P>
   But here's the thing: The Sabres have hardly proved invincible
on the penalty kill. Buffalo has allowed 14 power-play goals, so
why should it be so hard for the Stars to do better than 1-of-10?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's that Hasek guy.
</P>
<P>
   Although the shots were there _ 37 in the game _ the Stars might
need more.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as their goaltender, if we've got to get 70 \Rshots\S
to score three then we'll get 70 to score three,'' Hitchcock said.
``dWe have to find a way to get it done.''

STARS POWERLESS TO STOP SABRES AFTER STRUGGLING
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-STANLEY CUP-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Eager anticipation suddenly was transformed into stark
reality Tuesday night at Reunion Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Forget the long odds Buffalo supposedly faces in the Stanley Cup
Finals. After a stunning overtime victory in Game 1, the Sabres
have at least temporarily short-circuited Las Vegas odds, the
predictors, and the Dallas Stars.
</P>
<P>
   What began as drowsy hockey became a whirlwind of third-period
and overtime action, but when the Stars rode a near-miracle goal
into OT, they still couldn't survive the stout challenge of Buffalo
or the crease work of that man Dominik Hasek.
</P>
<P>
   With 4:30 left in overtime, the Sabres' Jason Woolley cruised
down the slot, took a perfect feed from Curtis Brown and blasted
the puck past Eddie Belfour.
</P>
<P>
   The seventh seed from the East was in seventh heaven.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo by 3-2 sent an alarming message to anyone in the
Metroplex who might have been assuming too much too soon. And that
means the Stars most of all.
</P>
<P>
   Two fact-filled story lines came out of last night's loss for
the Stars, starting with Game 2 now being a must win. But winning
can't happen if the Stars repeat 1-for-10 on the power play,
including nine consecutive failed chances.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo seemed to take one ``stupid'' penalty after another,
including two in overtime. But ``stupid'' became ``smart'' when the
Stars couldn't convert.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, the Sabres completely dominated the third period, scoring
twice to take the lead. The had the look of a younger, fresher
team, which they are. The only reason the Stars had an overtime
chance was Jere Lehtinen's goal with 49 seconds to play in
regulation after a great play behind the net by Mike Modano set it
up.
</P>
<P>
   New life meant new legs for the Stars. Overtime actually had the
Stars with more jump. They were the aggressive club. Except Hasek
would not fold. Hasek made a brilliant save, sending the puck the
other way, and that led to Woolley's game winner. Near-elation for
the Stars became despair, but that's just Hasek when he's on his
game.
</P>
<P>
   In the first two periods, all the critics blaming the Stars for
bringing ``boring'' and ``ugly'' to the NHL's showcase event were
at least partly right.
</P>
<P>
   Right about a homely snooze-fest breaking out due to style of
play.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, however, the Sabres had more to do with turning
prime-time hockey into a dreaded Knicks-Pacers imitation.
</P>
<P>
   You might also say Buffalo had a great scouting report: Give the
Stars the power play as often as possible.
</P>
<P>
   In a flashback to what happened against Edmonton and St. Louis
back in April and May, all the extra man meant was extra futility.
</P>
<P>
   Brett Hull crammed home a power-play goal on Buffalo's first
penalty of the game, but the Stars went 0-for-ever after that. In
fact, a fruitless four-minute power play in the second period
seemed to take the sting out of what had been a dominant Dallas
attack.
</P>
<P>
   At one point in the second period, Buffalo took three penalties
in less than five minutes, but with no damage done. And then there
were those two in OT.
</P>
<P>
   With the Stars a meager 1-for-7 on the power play through two
periods, it gave Buffalo exactly what it needed: a one-goal deficit
with 20 minutes still to play.
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres were rewarded for hanging around and keeping it
close. They pounced immediately in the third period, first with a
chain of big, jarring hits. The Stars seemed to soften up as
Buffalo became the pedal-to-the-metal predator. Stu Barnes popped
from the slot at 11:27, scoring on only the Sabres' 12th shot of
the game. That tied it, but there was no question the Sabres also
seemed to have the lead in incentive.
</P>
<P>
   Five minutes later, they had the lead on the scoreboard, too.
The Sabres' power play finally clicked on an excellent Wayne
Primeau effort when he went upstairs on a rebound goal off Belfour.
</P>
<P>
   With a 2-1 lead, Buffalo appeared headed for a quick advantage
in the series. And while it took awhile longer, the Sabres
eventually achieved what they had earned in the third period, and
in penalty kills.

HASEK SAVED HIS BEST FOR LAST
</HEADLINE>
 CUP-SABRES SIDEBAR-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Through the first 60 minutes of Game 1, Buffalo goalie
Dominik Hasek left you wondering: Is this it?
</P>
<P>
   Is this the goalie who has been beaten down with every possible
superlative _ from world's best to best ever.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't bad. He showed flashes of brilliance when Buffalo was
killing penalties, but he wasn't the Dominik Hasek you had heard so
much about, the Dominik Hasek who steals games all by himself, the
Dominik Hasek who can't be scored on.
</P>
<P>
   He instead saved that type of performance for overtime, and the
Sabres turned his excellence into a 3-2 victory against the Stars
in Game 1 of the Stanley Cup Finals Tuesday night at Reunion Arena.
</P>
<P>
   The crescendo was two point-blank saves on Stars forward Pat
Verbeek just seconds before Sabres defenseman Jason Woolley scored
the game-winning goal at the other end.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's Dom,'' Sabres winger Dixon Ward said. ``That's why he
was the best goalie in the game. That's why he's our best player.
He allows us to win games with saves like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Hasek: ``I went down and then I made the save on Verbeek,
and when I kicked up I got a cramp in my leg. Then we scored.''
</P>
<P>
   The record will credit Woolley with winning the game, but give
the assist to Hasek. He kept the Sabres in the game so there could
be a game-winning goal for Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars made Hasek prove it in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   They came out of the locker room for overtime still buzzing from
their game-tying goal by forward Jere Lehtinen with 49 seconds
remaining in the third period. They were flying, creating lots of
chances. The play, at times, seemed suspended in the Sabres end.
</P>
<P>
   The opportunities were there for the Stars, too.
</P>
<P>
   They had two power plays in overtime; that happens about as
often as snow in July in Fort Worth. They were in addition to the
seven power plays the Stars had in regulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It allowed them to get momentum where Dom was called upon to
save us at times,'' Sabres center Michael Peca said of the number
of power plays Buffalo allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Much like in regulation, Hasek wasn't tested on the first Stars'
power play in overtime, facing a single shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we shot a lot of pucks at him,'' Stars defenseman
Derian Hatcher said. ``Not to take anything away from him, but I
don't think we forced him to make too many spectacular saves.''
</P>
<P>
   At least not until overtime, the second power play especially.
</P>
<P>
   There was Stars defenseman Darryl Sydor firing a shot in from
the point. There was Stars center Joe Nieuwendyk flying in front of
the net and pushing a shot on goal. There was Stars center Mike
Modano unloading one from just below the faceoff circle.
</P>
<P>
   Each time there was a save by Hasek.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could probably list two years, probably 20 or 30 like
this,'' Buffalo coach Lindy Ruff said.''It was just a great
performance.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Dominator'' as he called was dominating. He stopped 35
shots in all, including seven in overtime. The two biggest were the
flopping, flying saves on Verbeek with about five minutes left in
overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still don't know how he got that,'' Stars coach Ken
Hitchcock said when it was all over.
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres do.
</P>
<P>
   They've seen it time and time again so much so that they've come
to expect it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our superstar is in the net as opposed to Mike Modano,''
Sabres defenseman Jay McKee said. ``He's not going to go out and
get the goal for us. He's just going to stop them.''

THIRD PERIOD DIDN'T FOLLOW `THE BOOK'
</HEADLINE>
 CUP-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ How does Ken Hitchcock put it? ``We textbooked 'em,''
is the way he likes to say the Dallas Stars played a nearly
flawless defensive hockey game.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, the Stars tried to use their defensive book to
hit the Buffalo Sabres over the head. And they almost did. But
there was no book for what happened in the final 6:23 of the third
period.
</P>
<P>
   What was interesting, as strategy goes, on the final two goals
in regulation _ the Sabres at 6:23 and the Stars with 48.3 seconds
remaining _ is that each coach made a nice move to make it happen.
</P>
<P>
   On the Sabres' goal, coach Lindy Ruff made a nice move,
inserting burly Wayne Primeau in front of the net to battle the
Stars' defense, which had been dominant. And Primeau, who had seen
little time on previous power plays, earned the goal, fighting off
the checks of Craig Ludwig to get to the net.
</P>
<P>
   On the Stars' final goal, Hitchcock made the somewhat risky
choice of calling a timeout with 1:20 remaining and pulling goalie
Ed Belfour. It could have cost the Stars, as the Sabres had a
chance to clear the puck, but it ended up giving the Stars the time
they needed to get in and make the play on Jere Lehtinen's
game-tying goal.
</P>
<P>
   What's important for Game 2 is that the lessons learned in the
first 55 minutes aren't lost.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars say they don't care about a lack of beauty or skill in
their game, just as long as they outwork their opponent. The Sabres
say they, too, don't mind being the villain, they don't mind
dragging the game into the gutter. And both coaches were able to do
that for much of last night.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the game wasn't that far off what both teams like to
do.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars want to work harder in the areas that they can control
_ checking, winning one-on-one battles, forcing the puck deep,
making the simple plays.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock worked his strategy to the letter. He rolled four
lines, he switched his matchups slightly, and he tried to keep the
pressure on the Sabres' defenseme&AMP;/ &QR; &AMP;~specialty-teams-filled second
period hurt momentum for
both sides _ the Sabres didn't have the puck and the Stars couldn't
score. But the game stayed on pace.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to criticize Hitchcock for the Stars' inability to
score. He drew up a strong game plan, a plan that kept the puck in
the offensive end of the rink for the first two periods, an
offensive plan that had the Sabres running around so much that they
put the Stars on the power play eight times in regulation.
</P>
<P>
   It was textbook Stars hockey. The Stars even took a 1-0 lead
into the third period and they were previously 5-0 in playoff games
when leading after two periods.
</P>
<P>
   But all that didn't matter because the Stars couldn't extend
their lead. They hurt themselves with the power play and they
didn't close the deal at even strength.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, this was exactly the way the Sabres won Game 1
against the Ottawa Senators. They were outshot, they gave up nine
power-play chances and they simply just wouldn't let the Senators
score.
</P>
<P>
   Ruff does a great job of staying clam. He doesn't overreact when
his players take penalties. He likes them to have the attitude that
they can afford to take penalties. And that calm paid off in the
third period.
</P>
<P>
   What's guaranteed from the coaching strategy is that both men
will continue to play the referees, both will fight the little
battles to get the edge in the face-off circle or in the battle of
obstruction. And both will find ways to change the ``textbook.''
Because there's no textbook written for this kind of finals.

STANLEY CUP NOTEBOOK: STANLEY STEAMER WORRIES ICE MAN
</HEADLINE>
 CUP NOTEBOOK-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Like nurses at the patient's bedside, trailers sat
parked at its flanks. Giant orange and yellow tubes dangled like
IVs from the building's bowels and doorways.
</P>
<P>
   Reunion Arena looked like a gasping victim, not a genial Stanley
Cup host.
</P>
<P>
   As the first game of the NHL final series neared, Luke Kortegast
was checking the baby's temperature. His spoiled child, the Reunion
ice, has the most scrutinized belly in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The weather's got me a little concerned,'' said Kortegast, who
bears the title of Ice Supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   Even with extra air-conditioning units rented for the series,
game time temperature in the arena bottomed out Tuesday night at 64
degrees. But it wasn't the heat; it was the humidity. Without the
rented giant dehumidifiers that have spaghettied through the
arena's hallways for two months, Reunion Arena might look like the
world's largest margarita.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifty percent humidity is a realistic goal,'' Kortegast said.
``But all day today we've been right at 55, 57 percent. The
humidity is what really hurts us.''
</P>
<P>
   As springtime in Texas began to pant its hot breath, the arena
ice was pelted with well-earned criticism. A monster truck rally
hadn't helped things.
</P>
<P>
   But after Game 2 of the Stars' series with St. Louis, Kortegast
and his crew went in and completely replaced the ice. At the behest
of Dan Craig of the NHL's hockey operations office, Kortegast
chunked the water purification system that they had been using and
filled the rink with what amounted to tap water.
</P>
<P>
   Reviews are mixed, but it certainly looks much better.
</P>
<P>
   As supervisor of ice, Kortegast gets the neatest seat in the
house _ for a few minutes, in any case. He drives one of the
arena's two Zambonis.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know,'' Kortegast said, ``I didn't get as big a kick out
of it tonight as I did for Game 7 of the Colorado series. I don't
know _ after that night, this one seems almost anticlimactic.''
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Kortegast does not have one of those bumper
stickers attached to his car's rear window _ the stickers that say,
``My other car is a Zamboni.''
</P>
<P>
   His is. But Kortegast noted, ``I own a motorcycle.''
</P>
<P>
   GIVING 'EM THE EAGLE: Amid the painted faces and the makeshift
Stanley Cup fedoras, Bonnie Sweitzer of Dalworthington Gardens had
created her own nest of hockey voodoo.
</P>
<P>
   Her homemade picnic-sized basket featured a stuffed eagle
wearing an Eddie ``The Eagle'' Belfour goalie mask. A brass chain
extended from the one of the wings to the neck of another stuffed
creature, a tiny buffalo. An old plastic water bottle, covered in
foil, formed the obligatory Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would be our Eagle leading Buffalo by the nose,''
Sweitzer explained.
</P>
<P>
   All season long with her season tickets behind the visiting
penalty box, Sweitzer has been making the personalized ``voodoo
nests'' and hanging them from the railing, where enemy players like
the Sabres can see them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They usually wind up whacking the glass at it,'' she said,
``or occasionally the glove will come off and I'll recognize the
hand symbol they use.''
</P>
<P>
   HORNS APLENTY: They shoot, they score. And at that moment at
Reunion Arena, a familiar blare booms through the air.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars' vice president of marketing, Jeff Cogen, wanted a
foghorn, like the one that Joe Louis Arena, old St. Louis Arena and
the old Chicago Stadium used to have.
</P>
<P>
   So Reunion has a foghorn. Four foghorns, actually. One is
perched in the rafters at each corner of the arena.
</P>
<P>
   Cogen himself activates the horns with a single plunger at his
seat. If the horn seems to linger a little longer than your basic
Civil Defense Warning, as it did after Jere Lehtinen's final-minute
goal last night, blame Cogen.
</P>
<P>
   The only things said to be louder are jet engines and, perhaps,
any rock-and-roll music played at Reunion. Whatever happened to the
dulcet tones of Erma Woodward at the Mighty Wurlitzer.
</P>
<P>
   Music at Reunion is Ty Wubker's department. He is best known by
afternoon talk-radio fans as the man who discovered ``The Darkness
Music,'' a few bars of which are played whenever enemy players
score a goal against the Stars.
</P>
<P>
   It is the only music at Reunion whose volume isn't likely to set
cats wailing or induce inner-ear damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people do say it's too loud,'' Wubker confessed.
</P>
<P>
   CHERRY, HOLD THE LIME: His suit was lime-green, and my first
question for renowned CBC hockey analyst Don Cherry is how did that
thing ever make it through customs?
</P>
<P>
   ``You do look like Austin Powers _ has that occurred to you?''
his Canadian network partner, Ron MacLean, asked on the air.
</P>
<P>
   Cherry, who reached the NHL finals twice during his years as
coach of the Boston Bruins, has picked the Buffalo Sabres to win
this best-of-seven series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they're going to win this game tonight,'' he
said after the Stars-dominated first period. ``I still think
they'll win, but it's no contest right now.''
</P>
<P>
   For those who have never had the viewing pleasure, Cherry is
part Dick Vitale, part John Madden, part Deion Sanders' Spare
Closet. His on-air outfit last night was, in fact, an electric lime
shade, topped off with a puffy dark handkerchief and white
boutonniere.
</P>
<P>
   He has a personality to match.
</P>
<P>
   When the Stars scored first, Cherry pointed out that he had
suggested to viewers that the key to beating Dominik Hasek was to
get traffic in front of the net.
</P>
<P>
   ``Evidently, (Stars coach Ken) Hitchcock was watching,'' Cherry
said, proudly.

SABRES CAPITALIZE ON STARS' POWER OUTAGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The Stars suffered a power outage last night, the kind
that could have melted the ice at steamy Reunion Arena.
</P>
<P>
   What's worse, it could be the first step in melting the Stanley
Cup hopes of the Stars.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars went 1-for-10 on the power play, including two rare
opportunities in overtime, and lost a 3-2 game when Buffalo Sabres
defenseman Jason Woolley whipped in a one-timer from the slot at
14:30 of overtime.
</P>
<P>
   The goal gave the Sabres a one-game lead in the best-of-seven
Stanley Cup Finals and pushes the Stars into a near must-win
situation for Game 2, scheduled for 7 p.m. tomorrow at Reunion
Arena. It also broke a 12-game losing streak for the Eastern
Conference, which had been swept in the three previous Finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't get swept now, anyways,'' Sabres coach Lindy Ruff
said. ``We just won one for the East.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres, who were dominated for the first two periods by the
Stars, now hold home-ice advantage; the Stars must win at least one
game at Marine Midland Arena, where the Sabres are 7-0 in the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Game 2 is a game that has a lot of pressure on the home team
regardless of what happens in Game 1, and the same thing goes for
the home team in Game 3,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said. ``There
will be some pressure on us in Game 2, and there will be some
pressure on them in Game 3.''
</P>
<P>
   Woolley's goal was a result of the hard-working forecheck of the
Sabres as Curtis Brown stole a soft clearing pass from Stars
defenseman Derian Hatcher at the halfboards and fed Woolley, who
was coming off the bench and had sneaked into the slot after a line
change.
</P>
<P>
   Woolley's shot went between the legs of Stars goalie Ed Belfour
and stunned a crowd of 17,001.
</P>
<P>
   It was a shocking ending for a rowdy crowd that had been pumped
up to its highest volume after the Stars sent the game into
overtime on Jere Lehtinen's goal with 49 seconds remaining in
regulation.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars had pulled Belfour for the extra attacker and
benefited from a great play by center Mike Modano. Modano squeezed
past Sabres goalie Dominik Hasek, stole the puck from Sabres center
Michael Peca behind the net and fed Lehtinen for an easy shot past
a stunned Hasek.
</P>
<P>
   ``The far corner was open, and it was a great pass from Mike,''
Lehtinen said of the slam-dunk. ``I was just out there, and it went
in.''
</P>
<P>
   The goal gave Stars fans hope after the Sabres had rallied from
getting only nine shots in the first two periods to scoring two
goals in the third. The Stars took a 1-0 lead on a Brett Hull
power-play goal at the 10:17 mark of the first period. But then
they squandered power-play chance after power-play chance until the
Sabres made them pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``From our standpoint, we'll have to get more desperation and
play for 60 minutes instead of 45,'' Hitchcock said. ``We didn't
score on the quality chances we had.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres took advantage as they finally skated up the ice that
had seemed to be tilted toward their goal all night and scored at
the 8:33 mark of the third period.
</P>
<P>
   Stu Barnes got the goal for the Sabres, whipping a shot through
a crowd to give the Sabres new hope.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Primeau then showed just how important the Sabres'
NHL-leading power play has been in the playoffs. Primeau chipped in
a rebound on the power play after camping out in front of Belfour
to put the Sabres ahead, 2-1 with 6:23 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars would get their own power-play opportunity a minute
later and fail on that. They would also fail on two power-play
chances in the overtime.
</P>
<P>
   It was the kind of game the Sabres had been hoping to steal. And
it was clear that this robbery had a lot to do with turning out the
Stars' power and sneaking in through the dark. But the Stars say
they know what it's like to lose Game 1 at home. After all, they
did the same thing against the Colorado Avalanche in the Western
Conference finals and won that series in seven games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like to do things the hard way,'' Hatcher said. ``We've
dropped Game 1s before. We're confident we can come back again.''

KUEHNE DRIVING TOWARD LPGA STARDOM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The LPGA Tour's gallery favorite of the 21st century wears an
insulin pump, an ankle tattoo, a permanent smile and a Nike cap.
</P>
<P>
   You got any problems with that?
</P>
<P>
   If so, you're in the minority. Kelli Kuehne, over the past three
weeks, has earned her stripes with peers and fans on the LPGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   She jump-started a stagnant career with a top-10 finish in
Austin, followed that with her first career victory in Corning,
N.Y., and topped those accomplishments by becoming the star of the
U.S. Women's Open last week in West Point, Miss.
</P>
<P>
   True, she did not win the event. Juli Inkster did. But Kuehne,
22, dominated air time during telecasts and drew the largest
galleries at Old Waverly Golf Club while finishing third, her top
career effort in a major championship.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Dallas native and former University of Texas
golfer finally started providing endorsers with a return on their
multimillions in investment dollars. Reportedly, Kuehne is in line
to earn more than $6 million over four years from a group of
sponsors that includes Nike, Top-Flite and Hain Foods (a producer
of diabetic foods).
</P>
<P>
   Of that total, $1.3 million came from Nike in November 1996 _ a
record-setting sum at a time when Kuehne had yet to acquire her
LPGA Tour card. Initially, that ruffled a few veteran feathers,
including those of Inkster, who lost a $30,000 shoe deal with Nike
for the 1997 season when the money was redistributed to Kuehne.
</P>
<P>
   But those wounds have healed. Kuehne proved herself to peers by
surviving qualifying school in December 1997. Now, they see her as
a potential heir to Nancy Lopez, someone who can lift the
popularity of an LPGA Tour that suffers from a serious lack of
young, American stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kelli is young, and she is still learning,'' said Inkster, 38.
``Personally, I think she does a great job. She reminds me so much
of me when I was first out here, with her guttiness and her desire
to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's face it, there will never be another Nancy Lopez. She's
the ultimate. But as Kelli gets older, along with the other young
players, I think they will mature and understand that we really
need them to take this tour to the next level. I think they can do
that.''
</P>
<P>
   After wilting under self-imposed pressure in 1998, her rookie
season, Kuehne is showing signs she might be at the head of that
class. The player who became too reserved and too serious last
season spent Open week whistling or singing pop music hits
Sometimes and Love Ya, Love Ya while strolling between the ropes at
Old Waverly.
</P>
<P>
   `I've decided you've got to have a little fun out here. That's
what's helped me out this whole year,'' said Kuehne, who has jumped
from 88th to eighth on the money list ($278,234) by virtue of her
three-week hot streak.
</P>
<P>
   Additional help has come from caddie Tracy Phillips, who doubles
as her short-game teacher. But the biggest boost might have come
from the insulin pump, an addition for the 1999 season that gives
Kuehne _ a diabetic _ better control of her fluctuating blood-sugar
count.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past three weeks, success has followed. Nike and fellow
endorsers look farsighted in signing a player who is charismatic,
well-spoken, talented and young.
</P>
<P>
   Kuehne stands as a heroine for her ability to produce at the
highest level despite battling diabetes. Having a 150-megawatt
smile and being engaged to an NFL player (Minnesota Vikings
offensive tackle Jay Humphrey) simply adds to the appeal for fans.
</P>
<P>
   It's a combination that can sell the LPGA Tour to the next
generation of fans. LPGA peers now join endorsers in banking on it.
SPOTLIGHT ON ...
Kuehne calls on insulin pump to control diabetes
</P>
<P>
   Every week at LPGA Tour events, Kelli Kuehne can count on one
recurring comment from gallery members.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people say, `No pagers on the course,' '' said
Kuehne, whose pager look-alike _ an insulin pump she wears on her
belt _ has helped her control her fluctuating blood-sugar levels
and contributed to improved play in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   A diabetic, Kuehne began wearing the pump in October and said it
helps her maintain a consistent energy level during competition. A
40-inch, intravenous tube is hooked to the pump and Kuehne can
regulate her insulin intake by pushing buttons instead of taking
multiple daily injections.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like an artificial pancreas,'' said Kuehne, a Dallas
resident who finished third at the U.S. Women's Open last week.
``If I'm in a situation where I need some energy and feel like I
need to eat some food, I hit a couple of buttons on my insulin
pump. It gives me insulin and I don't need to eat the food.''
</P>
<P>
   Kuehne said she hopes to send a message by wearing the pump.
</P>
<P>
   ``A common misconception about being diabetic is you can't be
successful \Rat athletics\S because you're diabetic,'' Kuehne said.
``I disagree. You can take your medicine, check your blood sugar
and live a happy, fulfilling life. Or you can not check your blood
sugar, not take your medicine and die. I've chosen to take this
route.''
CHIP SHOTS Colonial renovation starts
</P>
<P>
   Construction crews began moving dirt Monday on a $4.5 million
facelift to Colonial Country Club that will result in new greens,
reshaped bunkers, additional tee boxes and more trees when golfers
return for the 2000 MasterCard Colonial.
</P>
<P>
   The primary thrust is to improve course irrigation and drainage,
rid the bent-grass greens of an infestation of Poa-annua grass and
eliminate the effects of long-term erosion from bunker lips. In
addition, the project is expected to add more than 100 yards in
length to the 7,010-yard, par-70 layout. The course will remain
open with temporary greens throughout the bulk of the construction
work, which is scheduled to be completed by April 1, 2000.
Next goal: Hall of Fame
</P>
<P>
   With three victories this season, U.S. Women's Open champion
Juli Inkster finds herself three points from qualifying for the
LPGA Hall of Fame. Problem is, Inkster is committed to cutting back
her schedule to 10 to 12 events per year beginning in 2001, when
both her daughters will be in school.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves the rest of this season and all of next for Inkster,
38, to meet Hall requirements before golf takes a back seat to
family considerations. She can get in by winning three tournaments
(one point each) or one major (two points) and a regular tour
event.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can keep giving myself opportunities to win, I think I
can get those three points,'' Inkster said. ``In the next two
years, that's what I'm shooting for. That's my next goal.''
INSIDE THE NUMBERS Different strokes
</P>
<P>
   How varied were scoring conditions at the past two U.S. Women's
Opens, where the winners' scores varied by 22 strokes in relation
to par? Here is a breakdown: Category 1999 1998 Winning score 16

FOR BIG FINISH, RANGERS MUST CUT OUT ERRORS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lessons learned and opinions formed one-third of the way through
the season with the Rangers:
</P>
<P>
   The knee-jerk reaction to the Rangers' pitching overlooks their
defensive problems. They went into last night's game with the
third-worst defense in the American League and are on pace to
commit 133 errors for the season.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Zeile's nine errors have stood out at third base, but the
combined 12 errors by their shortstops have been even more glaring.
Royce Clayton's shoulder has been a bigger problem than anything
the pitching staff has presented and the Rangers' defense won't get
better until he's full strength.
</P>
<P>
   Talk is cheap.
</P>
<P>
   New club president Jim Lites came on board saying everything was
fine with general manager Doug Melvin and manager Johnny Oates, and
their jobs weren't on the line. But if that's really true, it's
time to junk the old Tom Schieffer policy of limiting the manager's
contract to no more than two years in length.
</P>
<P>
   Oates is signed through 2000, and there were times when Bobby
Valentine and Doug Rader had better contracts. At the All-Star
break, the Rangers should announce an extension through at least
2001. Oates has won two division titles, and he's about to win a
third. Any traces of doubt about the manager's job security need to
be erased once and for all.
</P>
<P>
   The early line on the Rangers' All-Star representatives: Juan
Gonzalez, Ivan Rodriguez, Rafael Palmeiro and John Wetteland.
</P>
<P>
   Wetteland's earned-run average is a little high for a closer,
but it's coming down. He's still the best reliever in the American
League and an old favorite of Yankees manager Joe Torre, who picks
the American League team.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, definitely no on Jeff Zimmerman. Well ... probably not.
</P>
<P>
   Better make that, maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, we'll get back to you on that one.
</P>
<P>
   Expediency still wins out over patience. Ryan Glynn wasn't ready
for the major leagues any more than Kelly Dransfeldt was, but the
Rangers decided they were what's best for the team.
</P>
<P>
   Pitchers constantly being rushed by almost every major-league
team is one of the biggest causes of the offensive proliferation.
</P>
<P>
   Broadcaster Tom Grieve astutely pointed out during Monday's game
two more examples of hitters getting their way. (1) The huge elbow
pad worn by Gary Sheffield and (2) Devon White's getting
ridiculously annoyed when Aaron Sele hit him on the leg show that
hitters aren't afraid any more of diving out over the plate. But,
they get enraged with the rare pitcher who isn't afraid to pitch
inside.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, hitters have gained the upper hand in such matters.
</P>
<P>
   People speculated that Palmeiro's presence in the lineup would
make a huge difference for Gonzalez. Wrong. It's the other way
around. Palmeiro is the one reaping all the benefits right now. But
that could change if he continues to punish teams for pitching
around Gonzalez, the way Ismael Valdes did Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   An idle thought toward 2001: Do you make Jeff Zimmerman the
closer or do you re-sign John Wetteland and make Zimmerman a
starter?
</P>
<P>
   Nice to have Lord Stanley's tankard in town. But for excitement,
intensity, suspense and great games to watch, I'll take the
Rangers' four games against the New York Yankees in the 1996
playoffs over anything Canada's favorite sport can generate.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, no doubt, are thrilled they have Roger Clemens. The
Rangers and Astros should be, too.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of which, every day Ruben Mateo spends in Oklahoma City
gives him that much better chance of being successful when he
finally arrives in Arlington. Remember, Gonzalez didn't come up
until the end of his Triple-A season.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' most important asset is their offense. No. 2 is
their professionalism, and nobody has exhibited that more than the
way Lee Stevens has conducted himself the past week.
</P>
<P>
   If you have tickets for Saturday night's game, do yourself a
favor and show up early for the pregame ceremonies honoring Hank
Aaron.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers are going to win the American League West, and if
their bullpen is as good as it is now, then, yes, they have a
chance against the Indians and the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   But they've got to play better defense.

NINE WAYS TO FIGHT FOOD POISONING 
</HEADLINE>
   (Repeating for all needing)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE YOUNG

<TEXT>
<P>
   Food safety quiz:
</P>
<P>
   What does a hamburger teeming with sickening amounts of bacteria
taste like? Answer: A hamburger.
</P>
<P>
   That's the problem with most food poisoning _ the bacteria that
cause the misery of stomach cramps, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting
cannot be tasted, seen, or smelled, according to an article in the
July issue of Redbook magazine.
</P>
<P>
   And what may cause you a few days of feeling yucky can be a
serious, even life-threatening, illness for your child, according
to Redbook.
</P>
<P>
   ``Infants and small children are particularly vulnerable to the
toxic effects of food-borne illness,'' says Michael Reed, M.D.,
director of the Poison Control Center at Rainbow Babies and
Children's Hospital in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   The younger the child, the greater the risk of dehydration from
vomiting and diarrhea, which can put the body into shock. Since 50
to 70 percent of outbreaks arise from mishandling of food in the
home, there's plenty you can do to keep your family safe.
</P>
<P>
   Here are the summer troublemakers you're most likely to
overlook:
</P>
<P>
   1. Shopping trip-ups:
</P>
<P>
   The average food item in your local supermarket has traveled
nearly 1,000 miles to get there, notes Robert Hollingworth, Ph.D.,
director of the National Food Safety and Toxicology Center at
Michigan State University. And while the Food and Drug
Administration and other food safety experts estimate that
perishable foods items such as dairy products, meat, poultry, fish,
and vegetables can stay out of the cold for a total of four hours,
``It's probably way too long,'' says Winkler Weinberg, M.D., a
member of the Georgia-Pacific Health Smart Institute Advisory Board
in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Assume any such food's time in the safety zone is nearly expired
and keep it out no longer than an hour, less if it's very hot _ 85
degrees or above.
</P>
<P>
   2. Hot cars
</P>
<P>
   The trunk is your car's hottest spot, and heat incubates
bacteria and other food-borne menaces. Stash groceries in the back
seat and turn on the air- conditioning, says registered dietitian
Molly Gee of the Methodist Health Care System in Houston. And make
grocery shopping the last stop on your list of errands.
</P>
<P>
   3. Cold storage
</P>
<P>
   If your refrigerator and freezer are stuffed full, air can't
circulate properly, which can create warm, germ-friendly spots.
</P>
<P>
   ``If your refrigerator is only 10 degrees above what it should
be, bacteria will grow,'' says Hollingworth. Keep shelves as clear
as possible and check your appliances' temperature: Refrigerators
should register 34 to 40 degrees and freezers should be at or below
0. (If your appliance doesn't have a built-in thermostat, buy one.)
</P>
<P>
   4. Problematic produce
</P>
<P>
   Raw fruits and vegetables are increasingly the culprits in
food-borne illness. Although much of our produce is now imported
from countries with less-than-rigorous food safety policies, you
can't be less vigilant with homegrown produce.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been problems with local organic and small-farm
fruits and vegetables,'' says Hollingworth. Unless it needs to
ripen at room temperature, produce should be refrigerated
immediately. Don't bother to wash before storing _ it could get
contaminated in the fridge, and you'll need to wash it again, notes
Weinberg.
</P>
<P>
   Rinse before eating, then wipe dry with paper towels. Laboratory
tests show that rinsing plus wiping removes 99 percent of
contaminating germs while water alone removes only 75 percent.
</P>
<P>
   It's a good idea to wash and wipe even thick-rind fruits like
melon _ any microorganisms on the outside will be transported
inside as you slice.
</P>
<P>
   5. Germy hands
</P>
<P>
   Running the tips of your fingers under cold water does not count
as hand-washing, says Weinberg. ``Not only are your hands still
contaminated, but so is the dish towel you wiped them on.''
</P>
<P>
   Make sure all family members wash their hands for two minutes
(with warm, soapy water) after using the bathroom and before
eating.
</P>
<P>
   6. Marinating mishaps
</P>
<P>
   Defrosting or marinating meats on the kitchen counter provides
ideal conditions for bacteria to proliferate. E. coli and other
troublemakers can lie dormant in frozen meat and can begin to
multiply again at room temperature.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, defrost or marinate all meat in the fridge. To make
sure the raw juices do not drip onto other foods or fridge
surfaces, defrost or marinate on the lowest shelf. Place paper
towels under the plate or tray to soak up any drips.
</P>
<P>
   7. Botched barbecue
</P>
<P>
   Partially grilling meats, then refrigerating or allowing them to
sit out before finishing them off on the barbecue basically warms
the innermost part to ideal germ-generating temperatures without
heating it to the kill point, says Gee.
</P>
<P>
   Stick to straight grilling or precook in the oven and move
straight to coals. Use a clean platter, not the one that held the
raw meat, to serve, and wash and dry the forks, tongs, and spatulas
used with the raw meat.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, potatoes grilled or baked in aluminum foil and left at
room temperature can harbor botulism (this organism lives in the
soil). It turns out that a foil-wrapped spud holds in moisture,
preventing its skin from reaching a high enough temperature to kill
botulism spores. The safest bet: Bake potatoes but do it without
foil.
</P>
<P>
   8. Contaminated convenience foods
</P>
<P>
   Convenience store refrigerators are opened so often that they
may not stay cold enough to prevent bacterial growth in prepared
salads and sandwiches. Cold air sinks, so pick from the bottom of
the cooler, toward the back.
</P>
<P>
   9. Uncool coolers
</P>
<P>
   Coolers are not portable refrigerators-packing a cooler full of
warm food and tossing in a cold pack is not enough to chill
contents to the requisite 34 to 40 degrees. Thoroughly chill or
freeze foods before placing in the cooler. Put the most perishable
items at the bottom, and put ice packs on the top.

BUGS AND GERMS LOVE SWIMMING POOLS
</HEADLINE>
   (With BC-FOOD POISONING)  
 Repeating for all needing)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE YOUNG  
 c.1999 Redbook Magazine  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last summer, E. coli in a Marietta, Ga., water park infected and
hospitalized six children who were swimming in the kiddie pool. It
was the same strain of the germ-0157:H7-that in 1993 killed four
children who ate contaminated fast-food hamburgers in the
Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   ``E. coli isn't the only bacteria you need to worry about in
pools. Microbes that cause gastroenteritis, salmonellosis,
shigellosis, and rotavirus (all of which result in vomiting,
diarrhea, and stomach distress) can all survive in water,'' says
David F. Knoop, technical service consultant for Arch Chemicals.
Here are his tips on what to look for in a pool that's safe for
your kids to swim in:
</P>
<P>
   _ CLEAN ON THE OUTSIDE: If a public pool's changing rooms, rest
rooms, and diaper-changing areas are messy, chances are the aquatic
housekeeping is not up to snuff either.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can get cross-contamination between the pool and the
bathroom and diaper decks,'' says Knoop.
</P>
<P>
   _ CLEAR WATER, SPARKLING WALLS: Water that's hazy and pool walls
that are slippery with (invisible) algae indicate poor maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   _ A BARELY NOTICEABLE CHLORINE SMELL: The stronger the chlorine
odor, the more you should be concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chlorine smells more the more it reacts with nitrogen
products, such as urine and perspiration,'' says Knoop. A stronger
smell means dirtier water.
</P>
<P>
   _ FEWER SWIMMERS: If your pool is always crowded, the chlorine
is less able to do its job. And the more people there are, the more
germs they're potentially spreading.
</P>
<P>
   If yours is a busy pool, don't hesitate to ask the manager or
senior lifeguard how often the pool is cleaned (the answer you want
to hear: at least once a day) and how often the pool is ``shocked''
or treated with high concentrations of chlorine (anywhere from
every two days to once a week, based on the number of swimmers, is
acceptable).
</P>
<P>
   _ A BUBBLY SPA: The pool may look okay, but check out the spa,
if there is one. Jacuzzi jets churn the water, but you should not
see foam on the surface. Foam comes from accumulated skin oils and
other microscopic debris and it means the spa is not being properly
cleaned.
</P>
<P>
   _ IF YOUR KID GETS FOOD POISONING: ``Infants and small children
are particularly vulnerable to the toxic effects of food-borne
illness,'' says Michael Reed, M.D., director of the Poison Control
Center at Rainbow Babies and Children's Hospital in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   The younger the child, the greater the risk of dehydration from
vomiting and diarrhea, which can put the body into shock.
</P>
<P>
   Since 50 to 70 percent of outbreaks arise from mishandling of
food in the home, there's plenty you can do to keep your family
safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``If your child is puking and pooping, whether it's food
poisoning or something else, it's important to be in contact with
your pediatrician,'' says Cornelia Franz. M.D. ``You and your
doctor can determine whether the child needs medical attention.
</P>
<P>
   Most cases of food poisoning go away by themselves, but you do
have to guard against dehydration, according to Franz.
</P>
<P>
   Tell your doctor how long the vomiting and diarrhea have been
going on, whether you've noticed any decrease in urine production
in the past 12 hours, and whether the urine looks dark or smells
particularly strong. These are all signs of dehydration, which, if
left untreated, can lead to organ failure, shock, and possibly
death.
</P>
<P>
   Your doctor may recommend that you give your child an
electrolyte-based drink, such as Pedialyte or Gatorade, says Franz.
(If your child doesn't like these, try mixing several ounces with a
clear soda.) ``In the long run, it's more important to get fluids
in, no matter what kind.''

 &HT;    Great Floridians a dead deal, but maybe there's hope in Miami
 &HT;    By Frank Cerabino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ They're having trouble finding nominees
for the Great Floridians Program.
</P>
<P>
   Really. It's getting so bad, they might have to settle for a
Pretty Good Floridians Program. I'll explain.
</P>
<P>
   A couple years ago, the state legislature thought it would be
nifty to mark the end of the millennium by honoring 2,000
Floridians. So the Great Floridian Marker Program was started,
coordinated by the Florida League of Cities and the Florida
Department of State.
</P>
<P>
   A call for nominees was issued last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Great Floridians Program seeks to recognize individuals
who have made important contributions to Florida's history and
culture,'' proclaimed a state Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The Great Floridians 2000 Committee would be convened to
separate the honorary wheat from the millennial chaff. The idea was
that the best 2,000 nominees would have plaques made in their
honor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plaques will be mounted on the selected building or
structure with which the individual was identified in the
application,'' the state announced.
</P>
<P>
   The deadline for applications was the end of last year. Then it
was extended to April. And now it has been moved again to the end
of September.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the problem?'' I asked Allison Herrington, who is
handling applications for the state's Division of Historical
Resources. ``Are you having trouble getting nominees?''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many do you have?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, 170,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And you need 2,000?'' I asked. ``It doesn't sound like you're
going to make it.''
</P>
<P>
   I suggested that possibly the problem was the ground rules of
the program, rather than a lack of public awareness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe you should start taking nominations for people who are
still alive,'' I suggested.
</P>
<P>
   You see, one of the main rules of the Great Floridians contest
is that you have to be dead to be nominated.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Herrington said. ``We're not going to take any live
Floridians.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why not?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Because live people have a tendency to say stuff or do
something bad, and usually it's on the day you're hanging the
plaque on the building,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Greatness, it seems, is a perishable commodity that's only
assured upon perishing. And people, no matter how significant their
achievements, still have the option of making messes of their
lives. Or as Herrington so succinctly put it:
</P>
<P>
   ``The only Great Floridian is a dead Floridian.''
</P>
<P>
   And I guess not many Florida cities are willing to fork over the
$175 application fee to nominate somebody who won't be around to
offer a tearful acceptance speech at the plaque-hanging ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   This millennial stunt has the potential of being very
embarrassing for Florida. When a state that's known as a haven for
the dead and dying can't find enough dead people to honor,
something is wrong. We're setting ourselves up for national
ridicule.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly there are people who have made significant
contributions to our history and culture.
</P>
<P>
   (The inventor of the electronic bug zapper. Let's not forget
that guy.)
</P>
<P>
   Or else, maybe we need to lower our sights a bit. Forget about
great. How about just finding 2,000 Pleasant Floridians?
</P>
<P>
   OK, I see your point. Maybe that wouldn't be easier.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the Great Floridians Program just needs a way of finding
1,830 more worthy dead people in a hurry.
</P>
<P>
   I've got an idea. Concentrate on Miami, where many dead
Floridians have recently achieved a rare form of greatness.
</P>
<P>
   Finding them won't be too hard, either.
</P>
<P>
   Start with a list of registered voters.

Northwestern Law School. When my husband and I flew to Chicago, I
left behind in Florida a semi-comatose father in hospice care. His
dream of college ended with his father's sudden death. The prism of
Daddy's frustrated hopes was the lens through which I viewed the
entire weekend. For me, then and now, he provokes the question: How
do we honor the past that paved a better future? (Jefferson, Palm

 &HT;    Sad ending ahead in ferry tale?
 &HT;    By Anne Rochell Konigsmark
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONKEY ISLAND, La. _ Seven days a week, 24 hours a day, a gray
and white tugboat pushes a small barge back and forth across the
Calcascieu River from here to mainland Cameron Parish. The 600-acre
island in southwest Louisiana has no stores or services; the seven
families who live here use the four-car ferry to get to work, do
errands and go to school. A few river pilots have an office on the
end of the island facing the Gulf of Mexico. And fishermen come
here to catch speckled trout in the murky brown waters off the
rocky shore.
</P>
<P>
   Without the ferry service, which began in 1939 with a rowboat,
the island would be, for all practical purposes, uninhabitable. And
uninhabited it may become, thanks to a bill passed last month in
the state House of Representatives. The bill, which still faces a
Senate vote, would kill the state-run ferry service, which costs
$521,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have to move,'' says Robinetta Bourg, 67, who has lived
on the island for 40 years. Her husband, Benny, dubbed the mayor of
Monkey Island by locals, was born here. The Bourgs can't live on
the island without a ferry to carry them and their car back and
forth.
</P>
<P>
   Their son, Chris, was born here, too, and he still lives around
a bend from his parents with his wife, Linda. The younger Bourgs
would like to stay on the island _ perhaps leaving a car on the
mainland and boating across _ but since Linda works an hour away in
Lake Charles, it may be too time-consuming. And if the parish can't
get to the island easily to maintain utilities, living there would
become impossible.
</P>
<P>
   On paper, the ferry seems like an expensive luxury for seven
families. But Cameron Parish says the state has an obligation to
continue the service. Monkey Island was not an island at all until
1939, when the government dredged a ship channel to carry vessels
north to Lake Charles. The land never was connected to the town of
Cameron _ where the ferry now runs _ but it was connected to the
mainland west of Cameron, near Holly Beach. In 1939, the Louisiana
Highway Commission promised a ferry across the ship channel, and a
bridge to Cameron. Neither materialized, but the state did begin
ferry service across the river to Cameron.
</P>
<P>
   ``And now they want to take the ferry away,'' says George Le-
Boeuf, president of the parish police jury, which is like the
county commission. His family settled on Monkey Island before the
Civil War. ``We don't have the funds to operate it or we could take
it over.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the families on Monkey Island have roots here that
stretch deep into history, into the mid-19th century. When two
Union ships tried to land in Cameron for supplies during the Civil
War, the Confederates, perched on what is now Monkey Island,
cannonballed them to the bottom of the river. Soldiers, Union and
Confederate, are buried on Monkey Island, in graves whose markers
have been lost in the weeds.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the descendants of the earliest settlers live here in a
cluster of modest frame homes on Bourg Street, just off the one
state road that cuts the island in half. Their heritage breathes on
this flat, scruffy patch of land so small you can stand in the
middle and trace its perimeter with your eye. Their parents and
their children grew up playing under the sycamore trees, fishing
off the rocks and hunting for critters in the island's marshes.
</P>
<P>
   More families used to live on Monkey Island, and there once was
a seafood processing plant and a Coast Guard base here.
</P>
<P>
   The island got its name because of the Coast Guard uniforms,
which were nicknamed ``monkey suits.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to say, `That's where the monkeys live,' and that's
how it got its name,'' says LeBeouf as he looks around the
abandoned barracks, gray houses on stilts hidden in an overgrown
forest of Chinese tallow trees.
</P>
<P>
   Still, state Rep. Steve Scalise, a Republican from suburban New
Orleans who authored the bill to eliminate the ferry, says spending
more than $500,000 a year on seven families doesn't make sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've spent $30 million on that ferry since 1960,'' he said.
``You could buy everybody on that island a mansion and a yacht and
it would have been cheaper. It's been a craw in my side to
eliminate that ferry.''
</P>
<P>
   Louisiana operates 12 ferries, all of which lose money, and the
Legislature tried to kill five of them in a bill last year. When
that bill died, Scalise decided to target the Monkey Island ferry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the worst,'' he said. ``It just doesn't serve a lot of
people.''
</P>
<P>
   The state has offered Cameron several options. The parish can
have the ferry if it will pay to keep it running. Or the state will
build a bridge. If neither of those options works, the state will
buy residents' land at market price.
</P>
<P>
   None of these is too tanta-lizing. The parish's general fund
totals about $3 million, of which only $200,000 could be made
available for operating the ferry, and that would mean sacrificing
road improvements. Times are lean in Cameron, thanks to the
downturn in the oil and gas industry, the backbone of the parish.
</P>
<P>
   The police jury voted in favor of the bridge, but some jurors
now are reconsidering, due to opposition from some residents. The
state says it will build a flat-level bridge, but that would block
boat traffic in the river. In this community of shrimpers and oil
service workers, who use that part of the river daily, a flat
bridge is not popular.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll probably have to close the island,'' said police juror
Malcolm Savoie.
</P>
<P>
   What the parish really wants, LeBoeuf and Savoie say, is a
bigger ferry. The present barge is too small for heavy equipment,
and that's what has hindered further development of the island,
they say. A developer is interested in building a marina with a
restaurant on the island, but can't without a bridge or a bigger
ferry.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not just about the seven families living there, it's
about economic development,'' Savoie says.
</P>
<P>
   LeBoeuf watches the island get smaller as the ferry pushes
toward Cameron on a gentle, humid afternoon. ``Look at this little
old thing,'' he says, looking down at the red-painted metal floor
of the barge and then up at the tugboat. ``Is it such a burden?''

 &HT;    A weekend centuries in the making
 &HT;    By Stebbins Jefferson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ ``This time a week ago, we were at ``The
Last Lecture'' . . . the theater . . . the Dean's Brunch . . . `` I
play this mind game daily, trying to keep vivid the details of our
trip last month to attend our youngest son's graduation from
Northwestern Law School.
</P>
<P>
   When my husband and I flew to Chicago, I left behind in Florida
a semi-comatose father in hospice care. His dream of college ended
with his father's sudden death. The prism of Daddy's frustrated
hopes was the lens through which I viewed the entire weekend. For
me, then and now, he provokes the question: How do we honor the
past that paved a better future?
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday afternoon, my husband and I went with our son to the
law school for ``The Last Lecture.'' This tradition is laughingly
described as a chance for relatives and friends to share in the fun
the students experienced for three years. The graduating class
chose legal history scholar Stephen Presser to be the speaker.
Seated on the hard, upright wooden benches in the law school's
oldest lecture hall, I felt no discomfort after he referred to our
son as one of his best students.
</P>
<P>
   I thought of Daddy's brother, Uncle Emmette, who in the late
'40s worked at night to pay his tuition at Boston University Law
School. Although his academic standing was good, he had to leave
without earning a diploma because he refused to stop dating a white
woman and was expelled. He had dared to dream of a clerkship with a
judge, a dream that our son will realize when he clerks for a
federal appeals judge.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night, we saw Ragtime. This musical is based on E.L.
Doctorow's book heralding the diversity of America even as the
diverse groups commit violence upon each other. My father's
generation was shaped in a time when brute force silenced such
candor about America's social problems. More profound than the
play's entertainment value was its acknowledgment that we live in
an America struggling to become its better self.
</P>
<P>
   We attended Dean David E. Van Zandt's brunch the next morning.
Among the many student leaders, distinguished guests and professors
we met was Dorothy Roberts, author of Killing the Black Body. Her
presence was inspiring in light of the tensions women and
minorities confront to find acceptance on law-school faculties.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Sunday afternoon, accompanied by our oldest son and
daughter and a family friend, we went to commencement, at which
Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., spoke. Before the address, Leonard
Rubinowitz, recipient of the annual award for teaching excellence,
announced the winner of the Wigmore Key. This award, named for the
law school's first dean, is given to the graduate whom classmates
and faculty consider ``the student who has done the most to help
preserve the traditions of the School of Law.'' Our son received
this honor.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of our trip is a blur: a congratulatory dinner at an
upscale restaurant, presentation of gifts, return to the hotel,
where insertion of our room key in the elevator yielded access to
the hospitality suite at the top. Daddy would understand. This
memorable weekend was centuries in the making.
</P>
<P>
   All the while I was in Chicago, I had visions of relatives gone.
I thought of those who worked as domestics on Palm Beach, admitted
to the island only with a required identification pass. I thought
of those who endured and respected a system that did not respect
them. Equally on my mind were so many I've known who were bright
with potential but who faded under the white heat of
discrimination, allowing the bigotry of others to define them.
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks, Professor Rubinowitz urged the graduates not to
get so caught up in the quest for fame and fortune that they forget
to cherish each other. I also urge African-American youths who are
inclined to move on up and distance themselves from their roots to
always cherish their ancestors, both the successes and failures. To
reject them is to betray oneself.

 &HT;    Starting to feel fried? No sweat
 &HT;    By John Kelso
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ It's summer in Austin. The heat is on us like a
cockroach on a cat food dish. Friends and neighbors, here's your
weather forecast for the next 3 2/3 months:
</P>
<P>
   Highs in the 90s to 100s, lows in the morning (for about five
minutes) from 72 to 77.
</P>
<P>
   So you're new to town, and you've never dealt with Texas heat.
How do you stand it? Here are a few helpful tips on how to survive
summer.
</P>
<P>
   If you are planning to go barefoot on pavement, practice first
by walking on hot coals.
</P>
<P>
   Stick with light colors. Never go to a daytime costume party as
Darth Vader. And never drive a black car unless you're operating a
hearse.
</P>
<P>
   Don't leave perishables in your car for more than five minutes
unless you are trying to attract a buzzard.
</P>
<P>
   Air conditioner doesn't work? Cover yourself in Mentholatum and
sit in front of a fan.
</P>
<P>
   No car air conditioner? Open all the windows and drive 85 mph.
</P>
<P>
   If you're going to wear your leather outfit, Vaseline yourself
first so you can be removed from your pants at the end of the
evening.
</P>
<P>
   Don't eat an ice cream cone outside in the afternoon unless you
want to wear it all over your shirt.
</P>
<P>
   Never leave your car without putting the sunscreen in your
windshield, unless you plan to wear kitchen mitts while driving.
</P>
<P>
   Jump in a pool and refuse to come out until about Sept. 20.
</P>
<P>
   You've been meaning to do it for years. Now's the time to try to
set that Guinness world record for sitting on a block of ice.
</P>
<P>
   Don't allow any dog up on the bed who weighs more than 9 pounds,
especially if he's a heavy breather.
</P>
<P>
   Avoid all events held in fields. Don't volunteer to be a judge
at any chili cookoff that doesn't have a tent.
</P>
<P>
   Get to know the guys who work at Reddy Ice, and spend the summer
hanging around with them.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of turning on the stove, learn to enjoy raw treats.
</P>
<P>
   Watch Dallas in the Stanley Cup finals. Even if you hate hockey,
it'll make you feel cooler.
</P>
<P>
   Empty a tray of ice cubes into your shorts and see how long you
can stand it.
</P>

 &HT;    Why do teachers `rely lav' school's last day? The hugs
 &HT;    By Emily J. Minor
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ If I were to ever teach school, which I
will not because I'd rather be on my feet for eight hours straight
scanning groceries than alone in a room with 25 children, I've
decided I would teach kindergarten. And not because 5-year-olds are
cute and sweet.
</P>
<P>
   They're not.
</P>
<P>
   No, I'd teach kindergarten because I've decided kindergarten
teachers get all the good gifts. Call it The Newcomer Syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   First-time school parents are so helpful, so thankful, so
gushing. At least I was, and I found myself in similar company.
That first year, I bought copies of my favorite book and wrote a
little note in each one. I bound them with grosgrain ribbon and
tied each with a pretty bow. I remembered the classroom teacher and
the classroom aide and the speech pathologist.
</P>
<P>
   But things change.
</P>
<P>
   I know this because my 8-year-old left Tuesday for his last day
of second grade. There he went, practically skipping, rain and all,
carrying a mildew-stained backpack and a bedraggled brown paper bag
with 12 oatmeal cookies stuffed inside. No ribbon. No copy of my
favorite book. No nice letter from me. Just cookies and a note from
the kid: ``Thanks for teaching me this year. I really liked that.''
</P>
<P>
   First-grade teacher Jackie Miner says that's OK. What really
matters is not what we do but what the kids do. See, she has the
right heart for the job.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Miner might get a gardenia, ants and all, snatched
from a tree on the walk to school. And hugs, lots of hugs.
</P>
<P>
   But her favorites are the poems, the letters, the stories. The
ones the kids write with their big, shaky letters. ``I rely lav
you,'' they might write. They say such nice things, like how
beautiful she is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not,'' says Miner. But we all know she is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have friends who get gift certificates, and I might get a
few store-bought gifts. But the biggest gift to me is something the
kids make,'' says Miner, who teaches at Lake Park Elementary
School.
</P>
<P>
   How about Mr. Barker at Hagen Road Elementary School in Boynton
Beach, Fla.? If you ever find your kid in his classroom, remember,
he's a sentimentalist. I bet you could even make him cry. Last
year's class got him a coffee mug with their picture on it. Every
little smiling second-grader. All those kids who failed to listen
and misbehaved in the bathroom. All those kids who struggled with
math and sailed through reading, or perhaps vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the sentimental things,'' says Jeremy Barker. ``They
get to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Carr taught first grade this year at Acreage Pines
Elementary School in Loxahatchee, Fla. and finds the last day of
school bittersweet. She's happy to be done, but she'll also find
herself missing the kids. For about two minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard. I get a little upset because you get attached to
them,'' she told me. I neglect to remind her that a person can also
get used to sea lice, hemorrhoids and cold sores. Why upset her?
</P>
<P>
   Turns out, Carr is just another teacher who loves the last-day
hugs, the last-day notes of love.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the letters they write.'' Carr said.
</P>
<P>
   The ones that tell her she's nice.
</P>
<P>
   The ones that tell her she's beautiful.

 &HT;    Multi-generational teacher puts down her chalk
 &HT;    By Mary Ellen Flannery
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ When Edith Coleman first started
teaching in Palm Beach County, Harry S Truman was president, Truth
and Consequences was everybody's favorite game show, and local kids
could still buy a soda for a nickel and bowl at the Carefree
Theater.
</P>
<P>
   But at 10 a.m. Tuesday, 49 years and 179 days after Coleman
first stepped into a cottage classroom in the Glades, she said 'Who
Needs Help?' for the very last time. Five hours later, as 145,000
Palm Beach County students streamed from 140 schools on the last
day of school this year, Coleman would bring her career to an end.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman spent the last 47 years at U.B. Kinsey/Palmview
Elementary, which she and her three children once attended. In some
cases, she has taught three generations of West Palm Beach families
_ and she says that's enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``When parents bring in their children, they say, 'She taught
me.' But now I'm teaching their grandchildren, so I think it's time
to retire,'' said Coleman, who plans to spend more time in the
family business, Coleman Funeral Home in West Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   At 10:15 a.m., second-grader Kenneth Gilley asked for permission
to stand and read a poem he neatly pencilled in the minutes after a
math review:
</P>
<P>
   ``Sunshine bright in the light, I wish everybody a happy night.
When you go home and lay in your bed, all the memories flow through
your head. I love you all and most of all, my teacher Mrs. Coleman
and my road dog Jermaine.''
</P>
<P>
   Coleman always knew she wanted to be a teacher, a wife and a
mother, she said. And while the world around her changed in the
past half-century _ West Palm Beach has doubled in size since she
took her first teaching job _ her manner of teaching has not. Every
year, she tells her students they have a job to do _ to learn.
Maybe that's old-fashioned. But Coleman believes that while
learning can be fun, the classroom is not the playroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``The same basic things we need to teach our children have
stayed the same _ reading, writing and arithmetic. But it's a
little harder to get the job done. Some students aren't coming to
school focused on school. They think it's play,'' Coleman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm firm, I try to be fair and I demand the best. I want to
know you've tried _ that hasn't changed over all these years.''
</P>
<P>
   During the last hour of school, the good-bye cards kept coming.
Parents stopped by to say thank-you. Second-grader Zakary
Rakszawski handed her a gift and a note that said, ``Thank you for
helping me write and have better handwriting,''
</P>
<P>
   Coleman smiled. She wouldn't have been able to read it nine
months ago.
</P>
<P>
   At 2:45, with just 15 minutes to go, her students conspired to
shout `Happy Retirement and We'll MISS YOU!' Ears up, Coleman was
still smiling while she quashed their plan. There might be
hollering at other Palm Beach County schools, but there will be no
shouting in Mrs. Coleman's classroom _ not even on the last day.
</P>
<P>
   And then, at 3 p.m., after more than 1,500 children have heard
her best advice _ Think First! _ it's over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel relieved,'' she said. ``I feel good about the work I've
been doing all these years.''

   EDITH _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ When Edith Coleman first started
teaching in Palm Beach County, Harry S Truman was president, Truth
and Consequences was everybody's favorite game show, and local kids
could still buy a soda for a nickel and bowl at the Carefree
Theater. But at 10 a.m. Tuesday, 49 years and 179 days after
Coleman first stepped into a cottage classroom in the Glades, she
said 'Who Needs Help?' for the very last time. Five hours later, as
145,000 Palm Beach County students streamed from 140 schools on the
last day of school this year, Coleman would bring her career to an
end. (Flannery, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

   MIDLIFE-JOURNEY _ FAIRBANKS, Alaska _ There's this thing about
Alaskans that I don't know how to break to you delicately, so here
goes: Alaskans are big into moose droppings. The souvenir counters
from one end of the state to the other offer moose nugget jewelry
and swizzle sticks, ``poo-pourri,'' ``s___ kabobs,'' and even moose
dropping chap sticks that won't moisten your lips ``but sure stops
you from licking your lips.'' (EDS: This is Installment 18 of Ron

   MASON-FAN _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ James Mason as the
enchantingly mad Captain Nemo in ``20,000 Leagues Under the Sea''
eyes survivors of a whaling ship captured by his futuristic
submarine, Nautilus, and commands his crew: ``Search the boat!'' As
Nemo seized the moment, the actor seized a 12-year-old girl's
imagination. ``He was so dark, so suave, and he had that voice!''
Barry Imhoff explains. Just how lastingly she was affected is
merely hinted at by the living room wall covered with photos of
Mason. Or the box of old letters, hers and his. To understand the
portal she passed through that night in the movie theater it's
necessary to step through the portal in her hallway, the one that
looks just like a reinforced compartment hatch from the Nautilus.
Only beyond that door does the depth of Imhoff's devotion to a
movie made in 1954 and a man who has been dead for 15 years become
clear. This is a sweet story of a fan who realized her dream of
meeting her idol. (Kalajian, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

<P>
   FAIRBANKS, Alaska _ There's this thing about Alaskans that I
don't know how to break to you delicately, so here goes:
</P>
<P>
   Alaskans are big into moose droppings.
</P>
<P>
   The souvenir counters from one end of the state to the other
offer moose nugget jewelry and swizzle sticks, ``poo-pourri,''
``s___ kabobs,'' and even moose dropping chap sticks that won't
moisten your lips ``but sure stops you from licking your lips.''
</P>
<P>
   One enterprising Alaskan even came up with moose droppings
impregnated with forget-me-nots. Add water and stand back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand this obsession with moose droppings,'' I
said to a souvenir store clerk.
</P>
<P>
   The young lady shrugged. ``The nights are very long here,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   So are the days, and I've had plenty of time to figure out why
Alaskans find moose droppings hilarious.
</P>
<P>
   I think it's because moose are dopey looking, and yet you can't
laugh at them because they kill 10 times as many people as
grizzlies.
</P>
<P>
   Mama mooses commonly wander through neighborhoods with their
calves, and if mama has any doubts about your intentions toward her
baby, she will stomp a puddle into you, and then stomp the puddle
dry just as a precaution.
</P>
<P>
   You don't make moose jokes when the next person might have lost
a loved one to a raging herbivore.
</P>
<P>
   But they're so darned funny looking. So you do the safe thing
and laugh at their droppings.
</P>
<P>
   Let's lighten up with the only moose joke I know.
</P>
<P>
   A movie director needs to shoot a moose scene and writes an
animal trainer as follows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear Sid _ I need two mooses delivered to the set by Monday.''
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't look right, so he dashes off another letter
specifying ``two meese.'' It still looks funny. Finally, he writes:
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear Sid _ Can you get me a moose on the set by Monday?
</P>
<P>
   P.S. While you're at it, send two.''
</P>
<P>

   Q: An article about the satellite Starshine, released by the
space shuttle, said it would be visible from Earth and could be
tracked by the naked eye. How can we find information about
Starshine and about viewing times and locations?
</P>
<P>
   A: Detailed information about the satellite can be found on the
Internet at www.azinet.com (and click on Starshine Project). For
details on viewing locations, check www2.gsoc.dlr.de/starshine (and
click on ``Select From the Database''). A tip: Be sure you have a
good observing site, out in the open, away from a lot of trees or
buildings and, most importantly, away from bright lights. Most
satellites, including Starshine, are pretty faint, so you'll have
to be sure there's no strong skyglow from city lights. The
satellite is expected to be visible during the next six months to a
year at certain morning and evening twilight periods to observers
located between latitudes 60 degrees north and 60 degrees south.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I recently read that Russia is the largest country in the
world, with Canada No. 2. If the United States and Canada were
merged into a single entity, would it then be larger than Russia?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. Canada's area is 3,849,674 square miles (including
inland water). The area of the United States is 3,615,292 square
miles (including inland water, but excluding the Great Lakes and
Lake Saint Clair). Add them and the total is 7,464,966 square
miles. Russia's area is 6,592,850 square miles.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A brief item in the newspaper reported that the Israeli navy
was looking for a submarine that was lost 31 years ago. Do you have
any more details?
</P>
<P>
   A: The wreckage of the Dakar was found May 28. The Dakar, an old
British submarine that had been refitted in Portsmouth, England, as
an Israeli vessel, was on its way to Israel when it disappeared in
the Mediterranean shortly after midnight on Jan. 25, 1968. At the
time, there was speculation that it had been sunk by the Egyptians
or Soviets. But now that investigators have examined video shots of
the wreckage, it's believed that the evidence indicates a
collision.
</P>
<P>
   The sub was discovered by American search-and-salvage experts
about 300 miles from Israel, between the Greek island of Crete and
the island nation of Cyprus, in about 9,600 feet of water. As
reported by The Associated Press, Capt. Doron Amir, a retired
Israeli navy investigator, and other investigators theorize that
the sub probably spotted a big ship coming at it and attempted to
crash-dive to avoid a collision. But its conning tower was struck
and ripped open, flooding and sinking it.
</P>
<P>
   The Dakar's entire crew of 68 presumably died in the accident.
The investigation is continuing.
</P>
<P>
   Q: News reports say the new owner of the Washington Redskins is
34-year-old Daniel Snyder. How did someone so young make enough of
a fortune to pay for such a team?
</P>
<P>
   A: Snyder didn't come up with the entire amount, but he is
investing a lot: $120 million in cash, according to The Washington
Post. Family members are adding another $90 million and minority
partners Fred Drasner and Mort Zuckerman each are putting up $90
million Snyder, a lifelong Washingtonian, made his $500 million
fortune in marketing and advertising. Zuckerman and Drasner have
known Snyder since the mid-1980s and were original investors in
Snyder Communications of Bethesda, Md.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I always thought Memorial Day is intended to honor all U.S.
soldiers who died in battle. But my mother says there's a separate
Memorial Day for Confederate soldiers. Can you clarify?
</P>
<P>
   A: You're both right. While Memorial Day originally honored
military personnel who died in the Civil War, it now honors those
who died in any war while serving the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, most of the southern states also have their own days
for honoring the Confederate dead: Georgia, on April 26, the date
in 1865 of the final surrender of Confederate Gen. Joseph E.
Johnston to the Union army's Gen. William T. Sherman; Mississippi,
the last Monday in April; Alabama, the fourth Monday in April;
North Carolina and South Carolina, on May 10, the anniversary of
the 1865 apprehension of Jefferson Davis by Federal cavalry;
Virginia, on the last Monday in May; and Louisiana, on June 3,
Davis' birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A relative is planning to work in China in the next couple of
months. Is it safe? What agency can give me up-to-date information
about the political climate for foreigners there?
</P>
<P>
   A: The State Department issues travel warnings when it
recommends that Americans avoid a certain country. China isn't on
the current list, but it is the subject of a public announcement,
which the department uses to disseminate information about
terrorist threats and other relatively short-term conditions that
it says pose ``significant risks or disruptions'' to Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The public announcement for China _ issued May 27 with an
expiration date (as of June 2) of June 18 _ advises American
citizens to exercise caution while living or traveling in China, in
view of the 10th anniversary of the June 4 Tiananmen Square
demonstrations and the ``lingering tension'' resulting from Chinese
reaction to the May 7 NATO bombing of the Chinese Embassy in
Belgrade, Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   To hear recorded information, call 202-647-5225 or, on the
Internet, check www.state.gov and click on Services, then on Travel
and then on Travel Warnings.
</P>
<P>
   Q: On the TV program ``JAG,'' the time is often referred to as
``Zulu.'' What does that mean?
</P>
<P>
   A: A code word used internationally for the time at Greenwich,
England, Zulu time is used as a reference standard when in, or
crossing through, other time zones around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent item in Q&AMP;A described the War Powers Act as a law.
It then referred to it as a resolution. So which is it?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's correct to call it a resolution, an act and a law. By
whatever name, it was passed by Congress in 1973. This is how it
evolved that year:
</P>
<P>
   Bills limiting the power of a president to commit U.S. forces to
future hostilities without congressional approval were passed July
18 by the House and July 20 by the Senate. The Senate version,
unlike the House bill, defined emergency situations in which the
president could commit forces without prior congressional approval,
but set a limit of 30 days on such action unless Congress approved.
And there were other variations in wording.
</P>
<P>
   The two bills went to a conference committee for resolution of
differences. The final bill passed the Senate on Oct. 10 and the
House on Oct. 12. But on Oct. 24 President Nixon vetoed it, saying
it placed unconstitutional restrictions on the flexibility of the
president to defend the United States, and that it was not in the
best interests of the nation. Then on Nov. 7 the House, by a vote
of 284-135, and the Senate, by a vote of 75-18, overrode the
president's veto. So the bill, a resolution of the differences
between the original versions passed by the two chambers, became
law.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have some cans of old paint that I want to get rid of in an
environmentally proper way. Any suggestions?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Georgia Environmental Protection Division offers this
advice: Put cat litter or sand, which will absorb the paint, in the
cans. When it dries and hardens, seal the cans and put them in your
regular garbage.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are my senior citizen eyes deceiving me? Is the lawyer who
just filed a suit in the Littleton, Colo., shooting case the same
one involved in the recent Jenny Jones case?
</P>
<P>
   A: One and the same. Lawyer Geoffrey Fieger, best known for
representing Jack Kevorkian, filed a lawsuit May 27 in state court
in Denver on behalf of the parents of a Columbine High School
shooting victim.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, the first stemming from the shooting, was filed on
behalf of Vonda and Michael Shoels, whose 18-year-old son, Isaiah,
was the only African-American among the 12 students and one teacher
gunned down April 20 by Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17. The
lawsuit, against the parents of the gunmen, alleges that they were
negligent in how they supervised their children. It doesn't specify
a dollar amount, although Fieger said he will seek $250 million
from the two sets of parents. Colorado law, however, sets a cap of
$250,000 in a negligent death lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   In the case involving TV talk show host Jenny Jones, Fieger
asked a jury in Pontiac, Mich., to award $71.5 million in damages
against her program and its corporate owner, Warner Bros., for the
death of a gay man who was killed after revealing a crush on
another of the program's guests. After deliberating for seven
hours, the 12-member jury on May 7 delivered a $25 million verdict
against ``The Jenny Jones Show'' show for negligence.

 &HT;    Opening lives by keyboard
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A little more than a year ago, Sharon Mazzotti's
foster son, Danny, walked through the door of her home for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
   Danny is mentally and physically handicapped. When he walked in,
his head hung low, like he had just been caught stealing. He was
17, and he was not able to brush his teeth or bathe himself.
Cerebral palsy kept his hands in an almost permanent fist.
</P>
<P>
   Much of that has since changed. And Mazzotti, 55, attributes it
to a computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do,'' she said. ``Learning how to do basic things on a
computer opened a door. It made him realize he could think, that he
could use his brain. If you could have seen him when he walked
through this door, just his posture and his facial expressions. Now
he stands up straighter. We never have to tell him to hold his head
up anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Danny took computer classes on Saturdays through a group started
by Tony Perrone.
</P>
<P>
   A former computer network administrator, Perrone was injured in
1986 when a pickup truck he was working on fell on him. He has not
had use of his legs since. But he still had his computer expertise.
</P>
<P>
   After a few years of physical therapy and a few unsuccessful
attempts at trying to get paid for what he knew, Perrone, 58,
decided to give it away.
</P>
<P>
   By 1994, word had spread among the North Georgia disabled
community that Perrone had a lot of computer knowledge and a lot of
free time. People started calling, asking if he could help their
disabled children learn how to run a PC. Perrone would come to them
and teach, for free. He asked for gas money in return.
</P>
<P>
   Demand grew, and Perrone started a training center. In September
1997, he opened Project Re-Compute, with two metro Atlanta offices.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could still do it, but when you go for a job in one of
these,'' Perrone said, gesturing toward his wheelchair, ``they
don't see you, they see the wheelchair. I felt if they could do
this to me and I've got a master's degree, what are they going to
do to other people with disabilities?''
</P>
<P>
   The main benefit to education, Perrone said, is self-esteem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more that people can believe in doing, the more they want
to learn,'' he said. ``They gain the confidence they didn't have
before, and they have a new respect for themselves because of the
technology they learn.''
</P>
<P>
   The courses are free. They are open to anyone with a disability
and a yearly income of less than $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Students attend classes for 16 weeks. As a graduation perk, each
student receives a computer, as long as there is one to give. In
return, they are asked to commit to 50 hours of community service
at any non-profit agency.
</P>
<P>
   Perrone relies on donated computers and donated time. His
non-profit organization has an all-disabled, all-volunteer staff of
26. He repairs the computers, upgrading them so they run popular
operating systems like Windows 95 or Office 97. Perrone does
repairs and upgrades, replaces hard drives and adds memory. For
kids in the Saturday classes, he loads Windows 3.1, games and
educational programs.
</P>
<P>
   Until last summer, he ran the center using his Social Security
check. Now it is day-to-day. He receives office space in exchange
for maintaining the building's computer network.
</P>
<P>
   Perrone said his goal is to give people with disabilities an
employable skill. Last year, 269 adults attended classes at
Perrone's centers. Of those, 22 percent found full-time work, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Mazzotti's foster son, Danny, started attending Saturday classes
last June. His goals were more basic: learning how to type his
first and last name and knowing where each letter is on the
keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the computer might open a door for him, and it
did,'' she said. ``It seemed to me that the door to his mind really
opened. He started trying to talk and he still continues to. I
don't think he knew he could do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Danny comprehends everything you say, but now he is able to
let you know that he does,'' Mazzotti said. ``I really believe that
seeing what he could do, seeing that he could find the letters on
the keyboard _ these are simple things to you and I, but he had
never experienced them before.''
</P>

 &HT;    Getting bash for the buck
 &HT;    By Karen Rosen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Jose Canseco knows the value of a good investment. He
bought stock in Yahoo and amazon.com more than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Evaluating his own worth, Canseco said, ``I'm probably the
cheapest guy around right now.''
</P>
<P>
   His bargain with the Devil Rays has paid dividends for Tampa Bay
_ who signed him in December for a guaranteed $2.5 million after
Toronto offered a $1 million deal. Canseco is also activating some
$2 million in incentive clauses this year.
</P>
<P>
   Of the seven other American Leaguers who hit 40 home runs last
season _ Canseco had 46 _ five are getting at least $8 million. As
for his fellow Bash Brother from the 1980s Oakland A's, Mark
McGwire. . . well, his 70 home runs last year sent his income
skyrocketing.
</P>
<P>
   But look who's now leading the majors in home runs: Canseco hit
his 22nd Monday night against the Braves for his 419th career shot.
He also has homered in 10 consecutive series. Only four American
Leaguers this decade have reached 22 homers faster: Ken Griffey Jr.
(twice), Cecil Fielder, Albert Belle and Frank Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good because I'm healthy and because I'm contributing
to the ballclub,'' said Canseco, 34, who could become the first
major-league player to hit 30 or more home runs for four different
teams: Oakland, Texas, Toronto and now Tampa Bay. ``I've got some
luck on my side right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1988 MVP still has the same powerful physique but is free of
the injuries, most recently back problems, that put him on the
disabled list 10 times. And Canseco's making headlines only for
baseball, not for speeding tickets, gun violations, a liaison with
Madonna, domestic disputes, exotic animals or his own personal
1-900 number.
</P>
<P>
   Canseco, who is quietly going through a divorce, believes those
old stories were blown out of proportion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure what the big deal is,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Devil Rays were impressed by his Toronto statistics _ which
also included 107 RBIs and 29 stolen bases _ but were wary of his
past.
</P>
<P>
   ``The risk (in signing him), obviously was the off-the-field
stuff you hear about,'' said manager Larry Rothschild. ``But he had
gone through a year of not having any problems. I didn't know Jose
before, but when I met him he seemed mature.
</P>
<P>
   ``The risk was more the physical. But that was covered through
incentives.''
</P>
<P>
   The designated hitter in AL games, Canseco is playing the
outfield against the Braves, which is the NL rule ``if I want to
keep that bat in the lineup,'' Rothschild said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hits some pretty towering shots,'' said shortstop Kevin
Stocker. ``When he hits them, you usually know it.''
</P>
<P>
   Canseco is the only player to hit a ball that lodged in the
catwalk at Tropicana Field, which cost him a home run May 2 when
the shot was ruled a ground-rule double.
</P>
<P>
   Reaching 500 homers is considered a sure ticket to Cooperstown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope so,'' said Canseco. ``I don't really know if that's the
criteria. Hopefully I can stay healthy and move on, and if I'm
lucky enough, hit 600.''

   MINOR-COLUMN _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ If I were to ever teach
school, which I will not because I'd rather be on my feet for eight
hours straight scanning groceries than alone in a room with 25
children, I've decided I would teach kindergarten. And not because
5-year-olds are cute and sweet. They're not. No, I'd teach

   JEFFERSON-COLUMN _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ ``This time a week
ago, we were at ``The Last Lecture'' . . . the Dean's Brunch . . .
`` I play this mind game daily, trying to keep vivid the details of
our trip last month to attend our youngest son's graduation from
Northwestern Law School. When my husband and I flew to Chicago, I
left behind in Florida a semi-comatose father in hospice care. His
dream of college ended with his father's sudden death. The prism of
Daddy's frustrated hopes was the lens through which I viewed the
entire weekend. For me, then and now, he provokes the question: How
do we honor the past that paved a better future? (Jefferson, Palm
Beach Post) MOVED.

   EDITH _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ When Edith Coleman first started
teaching in Palm Beach County, Harry S Truman was president, Truth
and Consequences was everybody's favorite game show, and local kids
could still buy a soda for a nickel and bowl at the Carefree
Theater. But at 10 a.m. Tuesday, 49 years and 179 days after
Coleman first stepped into a cottage classroom in the Glades, she
said 'Who Needs Help?' for the very last time. Five hours later, as
145,000 Palm Beach County students streamed from 140 schools on the
last day of school this year, Coleman would bring her career to an

Nemo seized the moment, the actor seized a 12-year-old girl's

Barry Imhoff explains. Just how lastingly she was affected is
merely hinted at by the living room wall covered with photos of
Mason. Or the box of old letters, hers and his. To understand the
portal she passed through that night in the movie theater it's
necessary to step through the portal in her hallway, the one that
looks just like a reinforced compartment hatch from the Nautilus.
Only beyond that door does the depth of Imhoff's devotion to a

 &HT;    A star devotion is born - and lives - for James Mason
 &HT;    (EDS: WITH ART.)
 &HT;    By Douglas Kalajian
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The scene that changed Barry Imhoff's
life when she first watched it 28 years ago is cued up on video
tape, ready to play on the 35-inch television that dominates the
cozy living room in her West Palm Beach home.
</P>
<P>
   James Mason as the enchantingly mad Captain Nemo in ``20,000
Leagues Under the Sea'' eyes survivors of a whaling ship captured
by his futuristic submarine, Nautilus, and commands his crew:
``Search the boat!''
</P>
<P>
   As Nemo seized the moment, the actor seized a 12-year-old girl's
imagination. ``He was so dark, so suave, and he had that voice!''
Imhoff explains.
</P>
<P>
   Just how lastingly she was affected is merely hinted at by the
living room wall covered with photos of Mason. Or the box of old
letters, hers and his.
</P>
<P>
   You might well decide you've seen enough when she pulls out his
nightshirt, make-up towel and a well-worn pair of pink, argyle
socks, but that would be a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   To understand the portal she passed through that night in the
movie theater it's necessary to step through the portal in her
hallway, the one that looks just like a reinforced compartment
hatch from the Nautilus. Only beyond that door does the depth of
Imhoff's devotion to a movie made in 1954 and a man who has been
dead for 15 years become clear.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that door lies . . . Nemo's bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, you never see it in the movie,'' she says. ``But you
have a pretty good idea what it looks like. I did, anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Imhoff thought the walls would be green-tinged copper plate, so
she figured out how to make facsimiles from plywood, epoxy and
textured paint. There are bolt heads everywhere in the movie, so
the bathroom is studded with a hundred or more that she cast from
plaster.
</P>
<P>
   Nemo insisted on knowing the sub's position at all times, so a
duplicate of his ocean map is laminated into the back wall of the
shower.
</P>
<P>
   Every surface, from toilet to sink to pipes, is coated or
colored to mimic visible or imagined details. Imhoff even angle-cut
the doorway, curved the shower entrance and bolted in overhead
pipes so that a visitor can't help ducking into a submarine
posture.
</P>
<P>
   She also supplies appropriate reading material: Three copies of
the 1870 Jules Verne novel that inspired the movie. Next step: a
sound system that will pipe in the voice of Nemo.
</P>
<P>
   There's no point asking how much time she's spent, or how much
money. ``It just happens,'' she says. ``It just keeps on going. I
think of something and I do it. You think I should keep going with
this theme down the hallway?''
</P>
<P>
   The effect so far is anything but cheesy. Imhoff, a
self-employed illustrator of product labels and packaging, has the
talent and patience to elevate her tribute well beyond decoration
into the realm of art.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, she outdoes the original.
</P>
<P>
   The film, already 17 years old when Imhoff first saw it in
re-release, was a wide-screen marvel of 1950s technology. The
special effects shots of the stingray-like Nautilus gliding through
a murky world of giant squid were oceans apart from the flying pie
plates of Plan Nine from Outer Space.
</P>
<P>
   But this was before Star Wars spoiled everybody. Watching
``20,000 Leagues'' today, even Imhoff chuckles at some of the sets
and costumes. In one scene, the crew waddles around the ocean floor
in diving suits with what appear to be iron bread loaves strapped
to their backs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd swear those are mailboxes,'' says Imhoff, 40.
</P>
<P>
   She's watched it _ who knows? A thousand times?
</P>
<P>
   ``I wear out the tape every so often and have to replace it,''
she says. ``Sometimes, I just like having it on. There's something
warm and familiar about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Watching closely can be maddening.
</P>
<P>
   ``The colors change from scene to scene,'' she says. ``The walls
look purple in one scene. Then, look _ now they're green! I just
had to decide what I wanted them to be.''
</P>
<P>
   What doesn't change or fade or ever look silly is Mason, in the
prime of life and career: Dark hair parted high; dark, bushy brows;
dark, sculpted beard.
</P>
<P>
   He had already won an Oscar nomination for ``A Star is Born,''
but was still years away from ``Lolita.'' No matter the role or
year, his voice was unmistakable. Deliberate, patrician, biting _ a
bit like Bette Davis, but two registers lower.
</P>
<P>
   Young Imhoff asked her father about him. ``He said, `It's an old
movie. The guy's probably dead.'''
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, Imhoff saw his name in another movie
advertisement. Her curiosity returned with a vengeance. She began
sending fan letters to his agent in England. Then she spotted a
picture of Mason in People magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``The caption said, ` . . . outside his home in Lausanne,
Switzerland,'''' she recalled. ``So I wrote a letter and addressed
it to James Mason, Lausanne, Switzerland.''
</P>
<P>
   It worked.
</P>
<P>
   Mason sent her a letter, a recording he'd narrated and a
hard-bound copy of The Films of James Mason. Imhoff wrote again,
and again Mason replied. Her letters, written during study hall,
became longer and more elaborately illustrated. She drew pictures
on the envelopes of Mason in various film roles.
</P>
<P>
   Mason responded with increasing enthusiasm. He sent her more
books, pictures, a mustache he wore in a movie. He wrote postcards
from movie locations around the world. He sent her Christmas cards.
The salutation was always, ``To TLW.'' The Letter Writer.
</P>
<P>
   Imhoff, then a high school student in Mattoon, Ill., wrote that
if Mason ever found himself changing planes in Chicago, she'd rush
right over to meet him at the airport. She kept up the
correspondence when she went away to college at Southern Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a roommate who was kind of weird; she used to read the
TV Guide at the beginning of the week and circle what she wanted to
watch,'' Imhoff says. ``One day she hands it to me. The Tonight
Show is circled. The guest is James Mason.''
</P>
<P>
   Imhoff illustrates by pulling the TV Guide page from her box of
letters. The listing for Oct. 2, 1978 is circled in red. Imhoff
gave it very little thought before taking her life savings out of
the bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was something like $400, enough for a plane ticket,'' she
says. Her brother was living in San Diego. They planned to drive to
Los Angeles the next morning and stand in line for tickets to the
show.
</P>
<P>
   While Imhoff was on the plane, her parents' phone rang. It was
James Mason. He was in Chicago, changing planes.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother gave him my brother's number,'' she says. ``He
called me there. He said, `I'm here in Chicago and I hear you've
gone dashing off.'''
</P>
<P>
   Mason arranged for Imhoff to get tickets, and the thrill of her
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sammy Davis Jr. was the guest host,'' Imhoff says. ``They came
back from a commercial break and Sammy said, `You were telling me
about a fan of yours. Why don't you tell everyone?'''
</P>
<P>
   Mason told America about the girl in the fifth row who flew to
California without so much as a ticket, hoping to meet him. Then he
waved her up to the stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got to kiss James Mason on national television!'' Imhoff
exclaims.
</P>
<P>
   In a flash, she was back in the fifth row. In another, the show
was over and Mason was gone. At least the show was recorded, so she
got to watch it later that night in a bar. But this was pre-VCR, so
she's never seen it since.
</P>
<P>
   She did get to meet Mason one more time, years later in New York
over lunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked him why he was so nice to me all those years,'' she
says. ``He told me he got lots of letters, but he picked a handful
of fans who seemed the most enthusiastic. One from England, one
from Germany, one from South America.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued to write until shortly before his death from a
heart attack in 1984. Soon after, she took one more
curiosity-driven flight, to Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would never have gone to his home while he was alive unless
he invited me, but he never did,'' Imhoff says. ``But I thought it
was all right after he died. So I called Mrs. Mason.''
</P>
<P>
   Clarissa Mason was more than pleased to have company.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stayed for three days,'' Imhoff says. ``We drank his
favorite wine. We watched his movies. That's when she gave me the
socks.''
</P>
<P>
   The experience helped demystify the man without lessening
Imhoff's devotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``After seeing stacks of his underwear and his old shoes, I
gained a healthy disregard for fame,'' she says. ``He was just a
man. A very nice, nice man.''

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    (EDS: In two takes _ take 2)
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I saw an article saying Cold War veterans now were getting
federal recognition. Are any benefits available to them, and how
does one apply?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Cold War Recognition Certificate, established by Congress
as part of the fiscal 1998 National Defense Authorization Act, is
symbolic, with no financial reward attached.
</P>
<P>
   All members of the armed forces and federal government civilian
personnel ``who faithfully served the United States during the Cold
War era'' are eligible. The specified dates for such service are
Sept. 2, 1945, to Dec. 26, 1991. An application letter, along with
documentation proving service during the period, is required.
Acceptable documentation includes any government form _ copy, not
original, because it can't be returned _ that includes the
applicant's name and Social Security number (or military service or
Foreign Service number) and date of service.
</P>
<P>
   The mailing address for requests for the certificate: Cold War
Recognition, 4035 Ridge Top Road, Suite 400, Fairfax, VA 22030. The
fax number is 703-275-6749. Information also is available on the
Internet at http://coldwar.army.mil/ or by calling 703-275-6279.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A steak dinner rides on the answer to my question, which
arises because of a recent TV travelog about Australia's Great
Barrier Reef. I say it's natural, but my son-in-law says it's
man-made. Who is right?
</P>
<P>
   A: We hope you'll enjoy a thick T-bone at your son-in-law's
expense. Outback, perhaps?
</P>
<P>
   Scientists believe the Great Barrier Reef began forming about
500,000 years ago. The coral reef is a limestone formation made of
the hardened skeletons of dead water animals called polyps.
Billions of living coral polyps are attached to the reef, so it's
continuing to form _ naturally.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When discussing conservatives and liberals, the press often
uses ``left'' and ``right'' with regard to people's views on an
issue. Can you elaborate on the origin of these labels?
</P>
<P>
   A: These are just two terms describing the ideological spectrum,
which (from left to right) includes radical, liberal, centrist (or
moderate), conservative and reactionary. Safire's New Political
Dictionary traces left wing-right wing descriptions to the seating
arrangement used by the presiding officers of the French National
Assembly. They placed the radicals at the cote gauche (left side),
the moderates in the center directly in front, and the conservative
nobles on the droit (right). Like so many political terms, the
``wings'' derived from military use.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Pep Boys has as its logo the caricatures of three men named
Manny, Moe and Jack. Were they real people?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. They were Emanuel ``Manny'' Rosenfeld, Maurice ``Moe''
Strauss and Graham ``Jack'' Jackson. In 1921, they _ along with
another Moe, Moe Radavitz, who left the company after a few years _
founded a business originally known as Pep Auto Supplies in
Philadelphia. The word Pep came from one of the products they were
selling, Pep Valve Grinding Compound, and the change from Auto
Supplies to Boys evolved through common usage.
</P>
<P>
   In 1923, Strauss went to California, where he saw a dress shop
named Minnie, Maude and Mabel's. When he returned he asked a
friend, Harry Moscovitz, to create the caricatures you still see
today. Ironically, the three faces that have become so recognizable
as Manny, Moe and Jack aren't truly theirs. Jack's face appeared
briefly when the caricatures first were penned. However, after
Graham Jackson left Pep Boys, his face was replaced with that of
Strauss' brother, Isaac ``Izzy'' Strauss. After Izzy left the
company, Rosenfeld's brother, Murray, joined the team, but Izzy's
face remained and continues to this day to be part of the company's
icon.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Back during the Clinton impeachment proceedings, actor Alec
Baldwin, appearing on a late-night TV show, made remarks
encouraging people to murder Rep. Henry Hyde and other Republicans
and their families. The Capitol Police, I believe, were
investigating that. Did anything come of that investigation?
</P>
<P>
   A: There was no investigation by Capitol Police. The episode
started when Baldwin, a shrill critic of Congress, made an outburst
Dec. 11 against House Judiciary Committee Chairman Hyde (R-Ill.) in
a skit on NBC-TV's ``Late Night With Conan O'Brien.'' In it,
Baldwin shouted, ``If we were in other countries, we would . . .
all of us together would go down to Washington and we would stone
Henry Hyde to death. We would stone him to death. . . . And we
would go to their homes and we'd kill their wives and children. We
would kill their families.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde, who had received a number of death threats at the time and
was under armed guard, reacted by saying he was ``sickened'' by the
comments. ``To kill my family because you disagree with me? To
laugh about that? There are people out there, sick people, just
waiting for a push.''
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Kasteler, a Baldwin publicist, said people angered by his
remarks were stiffs. ``They ought to lighten up,'' she added.
``It's a comedy show.'' NBC promised never to rerun the program,
with a network spokesman adding that the skit ``was obviously a
joke and meant to be taken as such.'' Baldwin, meanwhile, wrote a
letter of apology to Hyde, apparently putting an end to the
incident.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where can I get information online about the 2000 Super Bowl
in Atlanta? I found several sites for prior games, but not for the
upcoming one.
</P>
<P>
   A: The address: www.superbowlXXXIV.org/ Q: Do you know anything
about a recent recall of Saabs? I need to know which models were
involved and what the problem is.
</P>
<P>
   A: The recall, announced last week by Saab Cars USA, affects
26,000 Saab 9000s from model years 1992 through 1994. The automaker
said the covers on the air bag's electronic control module, located
in the engine compartment, could allow moisture to enter and
corrode its circuit boards, possibly causing the air bag to
malfunction. The manufacturer said owners of affected models would
be notified by mail in July to have the parts replaced by a dealer,
if necessary, and at no cost.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm told that President Clinton has issued 11 executive
orders. What are they?
</P>
<P>
   A: He has issued and signed far more than 11 executive orders,
which are presidential proclamations that carry the force of law.
According to the National Archives and Records Administration
Federal Register, as of May 25, Clinton had issued 13 such orders
this year alone. In 1998, there were 38; 1997, 38; 1996, 46; 1995,
43; 1994, 54; and 1993, 57.
</P>
<P>
   Those signed this year include Identification of Trade Expansion
Priorities and Discriminatory Procurement Practices; Using
Technology to Improve Training Opportunities for Federal Government
Employees; and Designation of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
(Serbia/Montenegro), Albania, the Airspace Above, and Adjacent
Waters as a Combat Zone.
</P>
<P>
   On the Internet, check www.nara.gov/fedreg/eoclint.html to read
details of all the executive orders issued during Clinton's
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The Postal Service has a Cinco de Mayo stamp. What does that
mean, and why is it on a U.S. stamp?
</P>
<P>
   A: Cinco de Mayo is the name of the annual celebration
commemorating the victory of Mexican troops over the French at the
Battle of Puebla on May 5, 1862. In Spanish, cinco is five, and
mayo is May. The U.S. Postal Service first issued the stamp, in a
32-cent version, on April 16, 1998, as part of its Holiday
Celebrations series. The 33-cent version of the same stamp was
issued this past April 27.
</P>
<P>
   When the 32-cent stamp was introduced, the Postal Service
explained that it ``celebrates not just the victory of Mexican
troops on May 5, 1862, but the victories Mexican-Americans have
fought and won to make American history.''
</P>
<P>
   Other stamps in the Postal Service's Holiday Celebrations series
honor Hanukkah and Kwanzaa.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Has there been any progress in the development of vegetable
oils for use in vehicles as a replacement for the petroleum-based
product?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's coming along. The developer of the new product, Agro
Management Group of Colorado Springs, Colo., recently licensed a
Michigan group to be the first to sell AMG 2000. The new oil, which
will cost about $2.25 a quart, is a 100 percent vegetable oil
blend. A big advantage touted by its developers is that, compared
to traditional motor oil, it's almost as environmentally friendly
as salad dressing: biodegradable, nontoxic and producing fewer
harmful emissions.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Allen of Agro Management said the product's blend is
secret, but he added that it includes soy oil and canola oil. It
was developed over six years at a cost of $2 million, with $250,000
in research funds contributed by the United Soybean Board, a group
founded by soybean farmers.
</P>
<P>
   The developers recently concluded an 18-day tour through 18
states using two trucks, one lubricated with conventional motor
oil, the other with the new soybean product. The two materials
performed equally, the researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, they cautioned consumers not to try pouring oil
from their kitchen cupboard into an engine, because high
temperatures would cause it to gel. AMG 2000's formulation prevents
that.

 &HT;    For Lecter fans, Harris serves up a worthy sequel
 &HT;    RESENDING FOR THOSE WHO NEED IT
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Hide the chianti and fava beans. Hannibal Lecter, the
cannibalistic psychiatrist from Thomas Harris' best seller ``The
Silence of the Lambs'' is back. And he's as hungry as ever.
</P>
<P>
   This time, though, it's Dr. Lecter who's on the menu.
</P>
<P>
   Don't ask.
</P>
<P>
   A million copies of Harris' long-awaited sequel, ``Hannibal,''
arrive in stores Tuesday, and the novel is a stunner. (Dino
DeLaurentiis has already paid $9 million for movie rights.) The
novel picks up seven years after Lecter escaped from custody and
Clarice Starling, the feisty young FBI trainee, disposed of
``Buffalo Bill,'' the serial killer who skinned his victims.
</P>
<P>
   Clarice is a full-fledged agent now, but she has made some
powerful enemies in the bureau. When a drug raid goes sour and
Clarice is forced to kill five people, including a woman carrying a
baby, she faces dismissal. But just when it looks as if her career
is over, she receives a letter from Lecter, and the manhunt for one
of the most vicious killers in history resumes.
</P>
<P>
   But Clarice is not the only one who wants to find Hannibal.
Mason Verger, the doctor's sixth victim, has offered $1 million to
anyone who kills Lecter and $3 million to anyone who captures him
alive.
</P>
<P>
   If you thought Hannibal was a monster, just wait until you meet
Verger. Paralyzed from the neck down and kept alive with a
respirator, the one-eyed Verger is faceless and lipless _ a result
of a little drug experiment Lecter employed in which Verger allowed
his face to be eaten by dogs.
</P>
<P>
   A wealthy sadist before he met Lecter, Verger plays mind games
with troubled children in a day care center in his mansion, feeds
crippled ornamental carp to the giant moray eel he keeps in an
aquarium and attempts to track his nemesis' movements via a
worldwide web. Verger plans to exact his revenge in a particularly
gruesome fashion by feeding Lecter slowly to a herd of omnivorous
pigs and filming his demise.
</P>
<P>
   Foiled for years in his efforts to capture the elusive
sociopath, Verger decides that the best way to draw Lecter out is
to set a trap with irresistible bait: Clarice Starling.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting manhunt is a thrill ride through a house of
horrors, from the scene of a nightmarish 15th-century murder in
Florence to the bizarre interior of Verger's Maryland estate.
Harris introduces a fascinating supporting cast that includes
Verger's sexually abused sister, a lesbian bodybuilder on steroids;
Barney, the hospital orderly who once cared for Lecter; and Paul
Krendler, a misogynist bureaucrat intent on destroying Clarice.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Harris takes us into the mind of Lecter to
revisit the traumatic event in World War II that spawned Hannibal
the Cannibal. Like Clarice, who is tortured by the childhood memory
of slaughtered lambs screaming, Lecter has his own demons that he
deals with by retreating into his ``memory palace,'' a mnemonic
system well-known to scholars in the Middle Ages.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the horror, Harris weaves in a wealth of artistic and
scientific details. In Florence, he has Lecter quoting Dante's
``Inferno'' to a group of scholars, listening to harpsichord
compositions by Henry VIII and expounding on the beauty of
Botticelli's art.
</P>
<P>
   Back in America, he has the doctor watching the film ``A Brief
History of Time'' and considering astrophysicist Stephen Hawking's
theory that at some point the universe would stop expanding and
events of the past could be reversed. A teacup that falls off a
table and breaks into pieces may gather itself back together. When
that happens, Lecter believes, dead relatives would be made whole
and nightmares would cease.
</P>
<P>
   Harris uses this image again in an ending as unsettling as any
in contemporary literature. Writing in language as bright and
precise as a surgeon's scalpel, Harris has created a world as
mysterious as Hannibal's memory palace and as disturbing as a Goya
painting. This is one book you don't want to read alone at night.
</P>
<P>
   FIRST LOOK: An excerpt from ``Hannibal''
</P>
<P>
   Starling turned and saw it all in a single image that would last
as long as she lived. Side by side on their stainless-steel tables
lay a deer and a man. From the deer projected a yellow arrow. The
arrow shaft and the antlers had held up the covering sheets like
tent poles.
</P>
<P>
   The man had a shorter, thicker yellow arrow through his head
transversely at the tips of his ears. He still wore one garment, a
reversed baseball cap, pinned to his head by the arrow.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at him, Starling suffered an absurd burp of laughter,
suppressed so fast it might have sounded like dismay. The similar
positions of the two bodies, on their sides instead of in the
anatomical position, revealed that they had been butchered almost
identically, the sirloin and loin removed with neatness and economy
along with the small filets that lie beneath the spine.
</P>
<P>
   Starling touched her lips with her knuckle. ... ``Dr.
Hollingsworth, were the livers missing?''
</P>
<P>
   ``The deer's liver is missing. Mr. Barber's liver apparently
wasn't up to standard. ... The sweetbreads, yes, missing in both
cases. Agent Starling, nobody's said the name yet, have they?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Starling said. ``Not yet.

   Throughout civilization, emeralds have long been symbols of
immortality, cures for dysentery and preservers of chastity. Why
such reverence? Because emeralds are very rare _ rarer than
diamonds. They are rare, says geologist Alain Cheilletz, because
they are a mixture of elements that don't ordinarily get a chance
to mix: ``They are a mineral that shouldn't exist at all.'' Robert

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   As most newlyweds quickly learn, intimate relationships, even
the most blissful, can buzz with tension.
</P>
<P>
   Couples typically find themselves struggling over money,
in-laws, ex-lovers and how much the woman's placenta should grow
when she gets pregnant. The guy wants his woman to have a
fast-growing placenta, while the woman does all she can to keep it
down to a reasonable size.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the fight over the placenta doesn't exactly take
place out in the open. The average man, if asked what he thinks of
his wife's placenta, would probably say he hasn't given it a
thought. Instead the placenta conflict gets played out, unbeknownst
to either person, inside the woman's body.
</P>
<P>
   A strange genetic process called genomic imprinting is
responsible. And its existence is only one small example of how
males and females have conflicting evolutionary goals.
</P>
<P>
   At first it might seem unlikely that men and women do have
conflicting evolutionary goals. Yes, both mom and dad want their
kid to survive. And in monogamous species, when the father can be
pretty sure it really is his kid, he may well cooperate with the
mother.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not quite the way it is in more polygamous animal
species such as orangutans, nor was it that way, say many
evolutionary biologists, among our own ancestors.
</P>
<P>
   Those males want their offspring to survive at any cost _ even
at the cost of the female's health and future fertility with other
males. For example, if the male can figure out a way to make the
female spend most of her food energy making the offspring grow big
and strong, that's OK, even if she starves. That's where the
struggle over the placenta comes in: men and other male mammals
pass on genes to their unborn children that encourage the mother's
placenta to grow big, nourishing the fetus at the mother's expense.
</P>
<P>
   Females want their offspring to survive too, but not at the risk
of their future fertility.
</P>
<P>
   This conflict is played out viciously among fruit flies.
Drosophila mate with multiple partners, and the male semen contains
toxins that kill the sperm of other males.
</P>
<P>
   When a male fly mates with a female who has recently had sex
with someone else, his spermicide goes to work, killing
competitors' sperm. That's a great adaptation, but unfortunately
the stuff is toxic to the female and gradually harms her health.
</P>
<P>
   The same sort of co-evolutionary arms race happens in humans and
other mammals. As a result, we have developed a bizarre set of
genes called imprinted genes, that seem to violate the basic tenets
of genetics.
</P>
<P>
   Think back to Gregor Mendel, high school biology, and dominant
and recessive traits. According to Mendel, it doesn't matter which
parent contributed which genetic message, but imprinted genes
violate his rules. With these genes, only the gene from one parent
has input _ the matching gene from the other parent is silenced,
losing its influence over the trait expressed.
</P>
<P>
   Most experts in this new field believe that there are only a
couple hundred of these genes in humans.
</P>
<P>
   About half the genes in question have something to do with
growth of the placenta, the fetus or the newborn. And the genes
derived from the father favor greater, faster, more expensive
growth, while the maternally derived genes counter that exuberance.
</P>
<P>
   As the evolutionist David Haig of Harvard first suggested in
1989, imprinted genes, including these genes in humans, are a case
of intersexual competition, fruit-fly sperm wars redux.
</P>
<P>
   The first battleground is the placenta with paternally derived
genes pushing it to invade more aggressively while maternally
derived genes try to hold it back.
</P>
<P>
   In rare diseases, maternal or paternal genes related to
placental growth are knocked out of action. Lose the paternal input
and the antigrowth maternal component is left unopposed _ the
placenta never invades the mother's endometrium, so the fetus has
no chance to grow.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, remove the maternal input, leaving those paternal
genes unopposed, and the placenta grows into a stupendously
aggressive cancer called choriocarcinoma.
</P>
<P>
   Once a baby is born, imprinted genes take a particularly
impressive turn. Certain paternally expressed genes help make kids
active nursers. On the surface, this looks like another example of
the usual picture: faster development at the cost of mom's
lactational calories. But now we're talking about imprinted genes
that influence behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery of imprinted genes may pave the way for curing a
number of unpleasant diseases involving tumors, infertility and
fetal overgrowth or underdevelopment. But philosophically, the
findings are disturbing. They appear to have some deflating
implications about human nature. We have more in common with fruit
flies than commonly believed.
</P>
<P>
   But a recent experiment by Rice and evolutionary behaviorist
Brett Holland hints that intersexual competition needn't be
inevitable. With careful manipulation, it can be derailed.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers isolated pairs of mating flies, forcing them to
be monogamous. They then bred the offspring with the offspring of
other such enforced monogamous pairs, continuing to maintain the
monogamy. And after only 40 generations, the monogamous descendants
produced less harmful seminal fluid.
</P>
<P>
   Once competition between males was no longer a selective force,
producing toxic chemicals apparently became a maladaptive waste of
energy. Freed of the cost of intersexual warfare, these monogamous
flies actually outbred the usual competitive flies.
</P>
<P>
   Just imagine carrying out the same experiment in people. Isolate
some humans and force them and their descendants into monogamy for
a millennium, and we would probably begin to disarm our mammalian
weapons of intresexusal warfare, namely imprinted genes.
</P>
<P>
   The story of imprinted genes is a bit more complicated, but once
paternally derived genes began pushing for the-hell-with-the mom
growth, the battle inevitably escalated.
</P>
<P>
   If the tribe next door shows up at the Paleolithic watering hole

<P>
   As most newlyweds quickly learn, intimate relationships, even
the most blissful, can buzz with tension.
</P>
<P>
   Couples typically find themselves struggling over money,
in-laws, ex-lovers and how much the woman's placenta should grow
when she gets pregnant. The guy wants his woman to have a
fast-growing placenta, while the woman does all she can to keep it
down to a reasonable size.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the fight over the placenta doesn't exactly take
place out in the open. The average man, if asked what he thinks of
his wife's placenta, would probably say he hasn't given it a
thought. Instead the placenta conflict gets played out, unbeknownst
to either person, inside the woman's body.
</P>
<P>
   A strange genetic process called genomic imprinting is
responsible. And its existence is only one small example of how
males and females have conflicting evolutionary goals.
</P>
<P>
   At first it might seem unlikely that men and women do have
conflicting evolutionary goals. Yes, both mom and dad want their
kid to survive. And in monogamous species, when the father can be
pretty sure it really is his kid, he may well cooperate with the
mother.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not quite the way it is in more polygamous animal
species such as orangutans, nor was it that way, say many
evolutionary biologists, among our own ancestors.
</P>
<P>
   Those males want their offspring to survive at any cost _ even
at the cost of the female's health and future fertility with other
males. For example, if the male can figure out a way to make the
female spend most of her food energy making the offspring grow big
and strong, that's OK, even if she starves. That's where the
struggle over the placenta comes in: men and other male mammals
pass on genes to their unborn children that encourage the mother's
placenta to grow big, nourishing the fetus at the mother's expense.
</P>
<P>
   Females want their offspring to survive too, but not at the risk
of their future fertility.
</P>
<P>
   This conflict is played out viciously among fruit flies.
Drosophila mate with multiple partners, and the male semen contains
toxins that kill the sperm of other males.
</P>
<P>
   When a male fly mates with a female who has recently had sex
with someone else, his spermicide goes to work, killing
competitors' sperm. That's a great adaptation, but unfortunately
the stuff is toxic to the female and gradually harms her health.
</P>
<P>
   The same sort of co-evolutionary arms race happens in humans and
other mammals. As a result, we have developed a bizarre set of
genes called imprinted genes, that seem to violate the basic tenets
of genetics.
</P>
<P>
   Think back to Gregor Mendel, high school biology, and dominant
and recessive traits. According to Mendel, it doesn't matter which
parent contributed which genetic message, but imprinted genes
violate his rules. With these genes, only the gene from one parent
has input _ the matching gene from the other parent is silenced,
losing its influence over the trait expressed.
</P>
<P>
   Most experts in this new field believe that there are only a
couple hundred of these genes in humans.
</P>
<P>
   About half the genes in question have something to do with
growth of the placenta, the fetus or the newborn. And the genes
derived from the father favor greater, faster, more expensive
growth, while the maternally derived genes counter that exuberance.
</P>
<P>
   As the evolutionist David Haig of Harvard first suggested in
1989, imprinted genes, including these genes in humans, are a case
of intersexual competition, fruit-fly sperm wars redux.
</P>
<P>
   The first battleground is the placenta with paternally derived
genes pushing it to invade more aggressively while maternally
derived genes try to hold it back.
</P>
<P>
   In rare diseases, maternal or paternal genes related to
placental growth are knocked out of action. Lose the paternal input
and the antigrowth maternal component is left unopposed _ the
placenta never invades the mother's endometrium, so the fetus has
no chance to grow.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, remove the maternal input, leaving those paternal
genes unopposed, and the placenta grows into a stupendously
aggressive cancer called choriocarcinoma.
</P>
<P>
   Once a baby is born, imprinted genes take a particularly
impressive turn. Certain paternally expressed genes help make kids
active nursers. On the surface, this looks like another example of
the usual picture: faster development at the cost of mom's
lactational calories. But now we're talking about imprinted genes
that influence behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery of imprinted genes may pave the way for curing a
number of unpleasant diseases involving tumors, infertility and
fetal overgrowth or underdevelopment. But philosophically, the
findings are disturbing. They appear to have some deflating
implications about human nature. We have more in common with fruit
flies than commonly believed.
</P>
<P>
   But a recent experiment by Rice and evolutionary behaviorist
Brett Holland hints that intersexual competition needn't be
inevitable. With careful manipulation, it can be derailed.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers isolated pairs of mating flies, forcing them to
be monogamous. They then bred the offspring with the offspring of
other such enforced monogamous pairs, continuing to maintain the
monogamy. And after only 40 generations, the monogamous descendants
produced less harmful seminal fluid.
</P>
<P>
   Once competition between males was no longer a selective force,
producing toxic chemicals apparently became a maladaptive waste of
energy. Freed of the cost of intersexual warfare, these monogamous
flies actually outbred the usual competitive flies.
</P>
<P>
   Just imagine carrying out the same experiment in people. Isolate
some humans and force them and their descendants into monogamy for
a millennium, and we would probably begin to disarm our mammalian
weapons of intresexusal warfare, namely imprinted genes.
</P>
<P>
   The story of imprinted genes is a bit more complicated, but once
paternally derived genes began pushing for the-hell-with-the mom
growth, the battle inevitably escalated.
</P>
<P>
   If the tribe next door shows up at the Paleolithic watering hole
with clubs that seem just a wee bit on the big side for the purpose
of bonking prey animals over the head, the home team will naturally
respond by getting even bigger clubs, just in case. And soon we
have a world with choriocarcinoma, toxic fruit-fly semen, and
umpteen times the education budget buying $600 toilet seats for the
military.
</P>
<P>
   As in so many other arenas of conflict, it's easier to ratchet
up than down.

<P>
   Before the Spanish conquest of what is now Colombia, people in
the mountains north of Bogota are said to have thrown emeralds into
Lake Guatavita.
</P>
<P>
   Once a year the Indian ruler would cover himself with honey and
gold dust and at daybreak have his men row him out into the lake.
As he plunged into the water, offering the gold to his god, the
crowd on shore would throw in their own offerings. The rich ones
chucked in emeralds.
</P>
<P>
   When the Spaniards finally found the Indian emerald mines after
decades of bloody searching, the Old World went crazy for the New
World's gems.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Egyptians had begun mining emeralds near the Red
Sea as early as 1650 B.C. _ and emeralds had long been symbols of
immortality, cures for dysentery and preservers of chastity _ the
new Colombian gems were the clearest, biggest and greenest anyone
in Europe had ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   Emeralds are valuable because they are rare _ rarer than
diamonds. They are rare, says geologist Alain Cheilletz of the
Center for Petrographic and Geochemical Research in Nancy, France,
because they are a mixture of elements that don't ordinarily get a
chance to mix: ``They are a mineral that shouldn't exist at all.''
</P>
<P>
   An emerald is a type of beryl, a mineral made of beryllium,
aluminum, silicon and oxygen. But whereas ordinary beryls are
colorless, emeralds are green because a few of the aluminum atoms
in their crystal structure have been replaced by atoms of chromium
or vanadium.
</P>
<P>
   Neither of those elements has any reason to meet up with
beryllium; they and it belong to two different chemical families
that drifted apart billions of years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after Earth was born, a lot of silicon and aluminum rose to
the surface, then cooled, forming the first continents. Most of the
iron stayed behind in the mantle or sank into the planet's core.
Other elements chose one of those two fates, too, based on their
weight and size.
</P>
<P>
   Because of this parting of the elements, Earth's surface rocks
are segregated into two realms, like yang and yin: light and dark,
crust and mantle, continent and ocean bottom. Geologists call the
light minerals felsic and the dark ones mafic.
</P>
<P>
   The paradox of the emeralds, as Cheilletz calls it, is that
beryllium belongs to the light, felsic, continental side, whereas
chromium and vanadium are from the dark, mafic, oceanic side.
Emeralds, in other words, are yin and yang in a single crystal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole problem in our research,'' Cheilletz says, ``was to
figure out the geologic conditions that could permit these two
elements to meet at the same time and place.''
</P>
<P>
   The answer, they discovered, has to do with plate tectonics, the
ceaseless shifting of Earth's crust that smashes continents
together to build mountains. To make an emerald, those elements
have to come together in a single hot liquid. The most common place
for it to happen is underneath a young mountain range.
</P>
<P>
   Where the edges of two colliding plates stack up, continental
rocks can get dunked so deep into Earth that they melt again,
liberating a great balloon of magma that rises back through the
crust.
</P>
<P>
   At a depth of around six miles, the magma stops, and begins to
cool and solidify as granite. From the top of this cooling mass,
streams of superhot, mineral-laden water _ granite juice _ migrate
upward into fissures in the surrounding rock and begin to leach out
elements.
</P>
<P>
   ``If by chance the granite happens to hit a zone of mafic rock
incorporated in the continental crust, then the chemistry will be
completely different,'' Cheilletz says. ``It will include iron,
magnesium and calcium _ and traces of chromium and vanadium.''
</P>
<P>
   When the felsic-mafic mixture finally freezes, the fissure will
be filled with biotite, a kind of mica. But scattered through the
mica, like green snowflakes, may be emeralds.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the world's known emerald deposits, from the
3-billion-year-old ones in South Africa to the 9-million-year-old
ones in Pakistan, were formed by granite intrusions.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, Cheilletz and his colleague Gaston Giuliani went
to Colombia to have a look at the most renowned emerald mines _ and
soon saw they didn't fit the standard picture.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of granites intruding from below, in Colombia there are
black shales laid down from above _ sedimentary rocks deposited on
the floor of a shallow inland sea during the Cretaceous Period, 100
million years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The sea must have been shallow, because the shales are
sandwiched among layers of salt, which precipitated out of the
water at times when it had all but evaporated. The Colombian shales
contain, in dispersed form, all the ingredients of emeralds.
</P>
<P>
   According to Giuliani and Cheilletz, those ingredients came
together on two distinct occasions, 65 million and 38 million years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Surges in plate motions _ the Atlantic Ocean was getting wider,
pushing South America against the Pacific and raising the Andes _
caused the thick stack of sediments under the shallow sea to
buckle.
</P>
<P>
   Large sloping faults formed several miles down in the sediments,
and hot water was squeezed out of them. Rising through layers of
salt, the 570-degree water became extremely corrosive. Continuing
through layers of shale, it dissolved out the emerald ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   Finally it pooled under a layer of especially impermeable shale
until the pressure became great enough to shatter that layer
explosively.
</P>
<P>
   Then the hot solution shot up through empty cracks in the rock.
As its temperature and pressure plummeted, emerald crystals snowed
out of it immediately. It all happened so fast, says Giuliani, that
the emeralds had no time to grow around grains in the surrounding
shale. They grew unconstrained and pure, without the minerals that
often cloud emeralds found in other parts of the world. That is why
Europeans were so enraptured with the Colombian stones when they
first laid eyes on them in the 16th century.

at the cost of the female's health and future fertility with other
males. For example, if the male can figure out a way to make the
female spend most of her food energy making the offspring grow big
and strong, that's OK, even if she starves. That's where the
struggle over the placenta comes in: men and other male mammals
pass on genes to their unborn children that encourage the mother's
placenta to grow big, nourishing the fetus at the mother's expense.
</P>
<P>
   Females want their offspring to survive too, but not at the risk
of their future fertility.
</P>
<P>
   This conflict is played out viciously among fruit flies.
Drosophila mate with multiple partners, and the male semen contains
toxins that kill the sperm of other males.
</P>
<P>
   When a male fly mates with a female who has recently had sex
with someone else, his spermicide goes to work, killing
competitors' sperm. That's a great adaptation, but unfortunately
the stuff is toxic to the female and gradually harms her health.
</P>
<P>
   The same sort of co-evolutionary arms race happens in humans and
other mammals. As a result, we have developed a bizarre set of
genes called imprinted genes, that seem to violate the basic tenets
of genetics.
</P>
<P>
   Think back to Gregor Mendel, high school biology, and dominant
and recessive traits. According to Mendel, it doesn't matter which
parent contributed which genetic message, but imprinted genes
violate his rules. With these genes, only the gene from one parent
has input _ the matching gene from the other parent is silenced,
losing its influence over the trait expressed.
</P>
<P>
   Most experts in this new field believe that there are only a
couple hundred of these genes in humans.
</P>
<P>
   About half the genes in question have something to do with
growth of the placenta, the fetus or the newborn. And the genes
derived from the father favor greater, faster, more expensive
growth, while the maternally derived genes counter that exuberance.
</P>
<P>
   As the evolutionist David Haig of Harvard first suggested in
1989, imprinted genes, including these genes in humans, are a case
of intersexual competition, fruit-fly sperm wars redux.
</P>
<P>
   The first battleground is the placenta with paternally derived
genes pushing it to invade more aggressively while maternally
derived genes try to hold it back.
</P>
<P>
   In rare diseases, maternal or paternal genes related to
placental growth are knocked out of action. Lose the paternal input
and the antigrowth maternal component is left unopposed _ the
placenta never invades the mother's endometrium, so the fetus has
no chance to grow.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, remove the maternal input, leaving those paternal
genes unopposed, and the placenta grows into a stupendously
aggressive cancer called choriocarcinoma.
</P>
<P>
   Once a baby is born, imprinted genes take a particularly
impressive turn. Certain paternally expressed genes help make kids
active nursers. On the surface, this looks like another example of
the usual picture: faster development at the cost of mom's
lactational calories. But now we're talking about imprinted genes
that influence behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery of imprinted genes may pave the way for curing a
number of unpleasant diseases involving tumors, infertility and
fetal overgrowth or underdevelopment. But philosophically, the
findings are disturbing. They appear to have some deflating
implications about human nature. We have more in common with fruit
flies than commonly believed.
</P>
<P>
   But a recent experiment by Rice and evolutionary behaviorist
Brett Holland hints that intersexual competition needn't be
inevitable. With careful manipulation, it can be derailed.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers isolated pairs of mating flies, forcing them to
be monogamous. They then bred the offspring with the offspring of
other such enforced monogamous pairs, continuing to maintain the
monogamy. And after only 40 generations, the monogamous descendants
produced less harmful seminal fluid.
</P>
<P>
   Once competition between males was no longer a selective force,
producing toxic chemicals apparently became a maladaptive waste of
energy. Freed of the cost of intersexual warfare, these monogamous
flies actually outbred the usual competitive flies.
</P>
<P>
   Just imagine carrying out the same experiment in people. Isolate
some humans and force them and their descendants into monogamy for
a millennium, and we would probably begin to disarm our mammalian
weapons of intresexusal warfare, namely imprinted genes.
</P>
<P>
   The story of imprinted genes is a bit more complicated, but once
paternally derived genes began pushing for the-hell-with-the mom
growth, the battle inevitably escalated.
</P>
<P>
   If the tribe next door shows up at the Paleolithic watering hole
with clubs that seem just a wee bit on the big side for the purpose
of bonking prey animals over the head, the home team will naturally
respond by getting even bigger clubs, just in case. And soon we
have a world with choriocarcinoma, toxic fruit-fly semen, and
umpteen times the education budget buying $600 toilet seats for the
military.
</P>
<P>
   As in so many other arenas of conflict, it's easier to ratchet
up than down.

<P>
   As most newlyweds quickly learn, intimate relationships, even
the most blissful, can buzz with tension.
</P>
<P>
   Couples typically find themselves struggling over money,
in-laws, ex-lovers and how much the woman's placenta should grow
when she gets pregnant. The guy wants his woman to have a
fast-growing placenta, while the woman does all she can to keep it
down to a reasonable size.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the fight over the placenta doesn't exactly take
place out in the open. The average man, if asked what he thinks of
his wife's placenta, would probably say he hasn't given it a
thought. Instead the placenta conflict gets played out, unbeknownst
to either person, inside the woman's body.
</P>
<P>
   A strange genetic process called genomic imprinting is
responsible. And its existence is only one small example of how
males and females have conflicting evolutionary goals.
</P>
<P>
   At first it might seem unlikely that men and women do have
conflicting evolutionary goals. Yes, both mom and dad want their
kid to survive. And in monogamous species, when the father can be
pretty sure it really is his kid, he may well cooperate with the
mother.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not quite the way it is in more polygamous animal
species such as orangutans, nor was it that way, say many
evolutionary biologists, among our own ancestors.
</P>
<P>
   Those males want their offspring to survive at any cost _ even
at the cost of the female's health and future fertility with other
males. For example, if the male can figure out a way to make the
female spend most of her food energy making the offspring grow big
and strong, that's OK, even if she starves. That's where the

<P>
   Before the Spanish conquest of what is now Colombia, people in
the mountains north of Bogota are said to have thrown emeralds into
Lake Guatavita.
</P>
<P>
   Once a year the Indian ruler would cover himself with honey and
gold dust and at daybreak have his men row him out into the lake.
As he plunged into the water, offering the gold to his god, the
crowd on shore would throw in their own offerings. The rich ones
chucked in emeralds.
</P>
<P>
   When the Spaniards finally found the Indian emerald mines after
decades of bloody searching, the Old World went crazy for the New
World's gems.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Egyptians had begun mining emeralds near the Red
Sea as early as 1650 B.C. _ and emeralds had long been symbols of
immortality, cures for dysentery and preservers of chastity _ the
new Colombian gems were the clearest, biggest and greenest anyone
in Europe had ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   Emeralds are valuable because they are rare _ rarer than
diamonds. They are rare, says geologist Alain Cheilletz of the
Center for Petrographic and Geochemical Research in Nancy, France,
because they are a mixture of elements that don't ordinarily get a
chance to mix: ``They are a mineral that shouldn't exist at all.''
</P>
<P>
   An emerald is a type of beryl, a mineral made of beryllium,
aluminum, silicon and oxygen. But whereas ordinary beryls are
colorless, emeralds are green because a few of the aluminum atoms
in their crystal structure have been replaced by atoms of chromium
or vanadium.
</P>
<P>
   Neither of those elements has any reason to meet up with
beryllium; they and it belong to two different chemical families
that drifted apart billions of years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after Earth was born, a lot of silicon and aluminum rose to
the surface, then cooled, forming the first continents. Most of the
iron stayed behind in the mantle or sank into the planet's core.
Other elements chose one of those two fates, too, based on their
weight and size.
</P>
<P>
   Because of this parting of the elements, Earth's surface rocks
are segregated into two realms, like yang and yin: light and dark,
crust and mantle, continent and ocean bottom. Geologists call the
light minerals felsic and the dark ones mafic.
</P>
<P>
   The paradox of the emeralds, as Cheilletz calls it, is that
beryllium belongs to the light, felsic, continental side, whereas
chromium and vanadium are from the dark, mafic, oceanic side.
Emeralds, in other words, are yin and yang in a single crystal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole problem in our research,'' Cheilletz says, ``was to
figure out the geologic conditions that could permit these two
elements to meet at the same time and place.''
</P>
<P>
   The answer, they discovered, has to do with plate tectonics, the
ceaseless shifting of Earth's crust that smashes continents
together to build mountains. To make an emerald, those elements
have to come together in a single hot liquid. The most common place
for it to happen is underneath a young mountain range.
</P>
<P>
   Where the edges of two colliding plates stack up, continental
rocks can get dunked so deep into Earth that they melt again,
liberating a great balloon of magma that rises back through the
crust.
</P>
<P>
   At a depth of around six miles, the magma stops, and begins to
cool and solidify as granite. From the top of this cooling mass,
streams of superhot, mineral-laden water _ granite juice _ migrate
upward into fissures in the surrounding rock and begin to leach out
elements.
</P>
<P>
   ``If by chance the granite happens to hit a zone of mafic rock
incorporated in the continental crust, then the chemistry will be
completely different,'' Cheilletz says. ``It will include iron,
magnesium and calcium _ and traces of chromium and vanadium.''
</P>
<P>
   When the felsic-mafic mixture finally freezes, the fissure will
be filled with biotite, a kind of mica. But scattered through the
mica, like green snowflakes, may be emeralds.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the world's known emerald deposits, from the
3-billion-year-old ones in South Africa to the 9-million-year-old
ones in Pakistan, were formed by granite intrusions.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, Cheilletz and his colleague Gaston Giuliani went
to Colombia to have a look at the most renowned emerald mines _ and
soon saw they didn't fit the standard picture.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of granites intruding from below, in Colombia there are
black shales laid down from above _ sedimentary rocks deposited on
the floor of a shallow inland sea during the Cretaceous Period, 100
million years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The sea must have been shallow, because the shales are
sandwiched among layers of salt, which precipitated out of the
water at times when it had all but evaporated. The Colombian shales
contain, in dispersed form, all the ingredients of emeralds.
</P>
<P>
   According to Giuliani and Cheilletz, those ingredients came
together on two distinct occasions, 65 million and 38 million years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Surges in plate motions _ the Atlantic Ocean was getting wider,
pushing South America against the Pacific and raising the Andes _
caused the thick stack of sediments under the shallow sea to
buckle.
</P>
<P>
   Large sloping faults formed several miles down in the sediments,
and hot water was squeezed out of them. Rising through layers of
salt, the 570-degree water became extremely corrosive. Continuing
through layers of shale, it dissolved out the emerald ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   Finally it pooled under a layer of especially impermeable shale
until the pressure became great enough to shatter that layer
explosively.
</P>
<P>
   Then the hot solution shot up through empty cracks in the rock.
As its temperature and pressure plummeted, emerald crystals snowed
out of it immediately. It all happened so fast, says Giuliani, that
the emeralds had no time to grow around grains in the surrounding
shale. They grew unconstrained and pure, without the minerals that
often cloud emeralds found in other parts of the world. That is why
Europeans were so enraptured with the Colombian stones when they
first laid eyes on them in the 16th century.

   Surges in plate motions _ the Atlantic Ocean was getting wider,
pushing South America against the Pacific and raising the Andes _
caused the thick stack of sediments under the shallow sea to
buckle.
</P>
<P>
   Large sloping faults formed several miles down in the sediments,
and hot water was squeezed out of them. Rising through layers of
salt, the 570-degree water became extremely corrosive. Continuing
through layers of shale, it dissolved out the emerald ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   Finally it pooled under a layer of especially impermeable shale
until the pressure became great enough to shatter that layer
explosively.
</P>
<P>
   Then the hot solution shot up through empty cracks in the rock.
As its temperature and pressure plummeted, emerald crystals snowed
out of it immediately. It all happened so fast, says Giuliani, that
the emeralds had no time to grow around grains in the surrounding
shale. They grew unconstrained and pure, without the minerals that
often cloud emeralds found in other parts of the world. That is why
Europeans were so enraptured with the Colombian stones when they
first laid eyes on them in the 16th century.

   1. BUBBLE-GUM GODDESS : BRITNEY SPEARS AND THE MAKING
</P>
<P>
   OF AN ADOLESCENT IDOL They may be making her into a teen idol,
but 17-year-old singer Britney Spears isn't letting controversy
stand in her way. Her debut album, ``Baby One More Time'' spent
four of the first six weeks of its release at No. 1 on the
Billboard charts. Overnight, its midriff-baring video turned Spears
into a sex symbol for the pubescent set. She says she isn't
surprised that her music has found a ready market, especially in
the wake of young, male vocal groups. ``I think people feel it
would be nice to hear a change, to hear a girl sound.'' By Gary
Graff. 1,300 words + photo.

BEETHOVEN'S FRIGHTENING POSTERITY Of all the Romantic composers,
Ludwig van Beethoven was the one who most embodied the power urge
that tempts certain creators to try to rival God. That ambition,
combined with his striking, memorable and rousing musical motifs,
has probably made him an ideal subject for political exploitation,
as Esteban Buch shows in his fascinating book, ``Beethoven's Ninth
: A Political History.'' The composer's ``Ode to Joy'' has come to
symbolise an ongoing fraternal Utopia, a universal message much
more than a piece of music. By Philippe-Jean Catinchi. From Le
Monde. 1,500 words. (English translation available.)

ISAAC HAYES ON 'SOUTH PARK,' 'SHAFT,' MUSIC AND MORE Call him an
entertainer. ``That pretty much encapsulates the whole thing,''
Isaac Hayes says. ``I've been at it for 40 years.'' These days, the
56-year-old artist is enjoying an unlikely surge in popularity with
college students and preteens. By Ian Spelling. 1,300 words +
photo.
_____________________________________________________________ 5.
CHER : SHE'S BACK, ON SCREEN AND ON CD In salvaging her career
after the end of Sonny and Cher's brief fame in the 1970s, in
reinventing herself as a solo singer and an Oscar-winning actress,
Cher earned a spot in the Comeback Hall of Fame. On the eve of her
53rd birthday she has a multimillion selling single, ``Believe,''
and great reviews for her role in Franco Zeffirelli's film ``Tea
With Mussolini.'' ``See what happens when I take a big rest?'' she
jokes. ``I'm like John Travolta - I come back big.'' Her fans are
sometimes surprised that the person they meet isn't the feather and
rhinestone glamour queen they've seen on the Oscars. ``I'm very
soft in a certain way ... it's just that you can't be too soft and
survive in my world.'' By Cindy Pearlman. 1,300 words + photo.
_____________________________________________________________ 6.
THE SNUFF FILM : THE MAKING OF AN URBAN LEGEND One of the most
enduring, and little-recognized, urban legends about cinema is the
``snuff film,'' in which actresses are supposedly actually killed
onscreen. Over the course of nearly a quarter of a century, the
snuff film has transformed from grade-Z slasher film to hoax to
antio-pornographers' straw man to urban legend and shows no sign of
slowing down. By Scott Aaron Stine. From Skeptical Inquirer
magazine. 3,000 words.
_____________________________________________________________ 7.
FOR THE RECORD, JENNIFER LOPEZ HAS MUSIC ON HER MIND It isn't
enough that Jennifer Lopez is a gorgeous movie star, famous and
rich beyond most people's wildest dreams - the highest-paid Latina
in Hollywood - she can also sing. The dominant voice on her album
is that of a young woman fired by determination to get everything
life has to offer. ``The music is a little like me. It's street,
but there is also a soft side ...'' By Cindy Pearlman. 1,300 words
+ photo.

GET OFF TO A GOOD START AFTER COLLEGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAVE MURPHY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ If you're a college graduate starting your first
real job, you're entering the working world at a time unlike any
other. Now that Susan Lucci has won an Emmy, everything else that
happens in the American workplace is pretty much anticlimactic.
</P>
<P>
   But since it will be, oh, half a century until your Social
Security kicks in _ if it hasn't already kicked the bucket _ you
might want to get a handle on this ``real world'' thing, and how
school did and did not help you prepare for it.
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few things I wish I had known half a lifetime ago,
when my face was as fresh as yours:
</P>
<P>
   _ Mediocrity rules.
</P>
<P>
   Schools and workplaces focus so much on improving their weakest
people that they often ignore their best. You won't have the kind
of clear path and constant feedback you had in school, and your
company may never tell you exactly what skills you need to advance.
So find a mentor or seek advice from people you respect.
</P>
<P>
   How can you stand out? Even if all you do is perform a task well
(details and all) the first time you're asked, you'll be ahead of a
huge chunk of the work force. Learn how to do things other people
can't.
</P>
<P>
   And don't overlook the most valuable skill any worker can have:
the ability to read the handwriting on the wall.
</P>
<P>
   Not that you would ever use this advice for evil purposes, of
course, but there are two great things about having special skills:
They give you power, and no one really knows when you're goofing
off.
</P>
<P>
   Say you're at a company with only one tech support person. He
says he can't fix your software problem until tomorrow afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Deep down, you don't really know if the delay is because (a)
it's a time-consuming job; (b) it's a 10-minute job, but you're low
on his priority list; (c) it's a 10-minute job for most tech
support people, but not him; or (d) it's a 10-minute job, but he's
devoting his day to finding the best Internet porn sites.
</P>
<P>
   _ Develop habits you can live with.
</P>
<P>
   Work 60 or 70 hours in each of your first two weeks, even if
many of those hours are spent studying at home rather than in the
office. Getting a reputation as a quick learner is well worth the
unpaid overtime.
</P>
<P>
   When you have questions, look for answers in a manual or help
file. If you have to ask people, write down their answers so you
don't have to ask again.
</P>
<P>
   Realize that engineers have invented a device that robs you of
your creativity, your individuality and your soul. They call it a
cubicle. If you're stuck in one, figure out if there are certain
tasks _ such as brainstorming _ that you're better off doing
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Once you get comfortable, take a weekend and evaluate your
personal and career goals, from buying a car to starting a family
to figuring out how many hours you want to work each week, and put
them in priority. Get into the habit of doing this once a year.
</P>
<P>
   Understand that the status quo is a decision in itself. If you
choose to do nothing, that's probably what you'll get.
</P>
<P>
   _ Choose your words carefully.
</P>
<P>
   In college, candid conversation is encouraged. Many workplaces
are like that, but not all.
</P>
<P>
   Knee-jerk rule of thumb: Ask 20 questions for each opinion you
offer. Learn from ``Jeopardy''; the right answer often comes in the
form of a question. Like, ``Is there a reason we don't ...?'' And
realize that helping people is an art form. Do it whenever you can,
but don't make the person you're helping feel like an idiot.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't underestimate the importance of money.
</P>
<P>
   College finances are usually unrealistic. You either have a free
ride through scholarships or parents, or you get loans and scrap
for every penny.
</P>
<P>
   Now you have a real job, making real money. Splurge if you need
to, but then learn how to save and invest. Your first job isn't
just the foundation for your career, but for the rest of your life.
</P>
<P>
   Say you save $10,000 in an IRA by the time you're 30. If you
earn 5 percent a year and make no further deposits, you'll have
about $55,000 at age 65. At 10 percent, it's $280,000; at 15
percent, $1.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy at this stage to say that money doesn't matter. Maybe
it never will. Maybe you'll win the lottery, too.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't be a victim.
</P>
<P>
   Bosses and teachers play favorites. No matter what race, sex or
age you are, you might feel as if you've been discriminated against
_ and you might be right. There is always going to be someone who
has more money, more influence and more Emmy Awards than you do.
</P>
<P>
   Before winning the Emmy, Lucci had been nominated 18 times, but
the award always went to someone else. She never failed; someone
else just did better.
</P>
<P>
   During all those years, America's most famous loser stayed with
the same husband, raised two children, earned millions of dollars
and became a soap opera icon, better known than any of the women
who received the Emmy.
</P>
<P>
   There are a lot of victories in work and in life, and most of
them don't come with gold statuettes.
</P>

TV FALLS FOR MONKEY BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TIM GOODMAN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ There is a weird kind of beauty and a right kind
of justice in the fact that a show called ``The Chimp Channel''
debuts at the end of the television season. In a surreal way,
watching chimpanzees and orangutans in costume, spoofing such show
biz as ``The Larry Sanders Show,'' just makes sense.
</P>
<P>
   Not all the time, mind you. Often you're left to wonder if you
haven't fallen into some hellish ``Planet of the Apes'' nightmare
in which you've not only accepted your situation, you're pretty
excited about a new TV show littered with simians.
</P>
<P>
   For those of you with a keen ability to read between the lines,
you'll notice throughout that this is a plea for help.
</P>
<P>
   Has it really come to this? That television has gone from live
action to animation and now the third wave, chimps, as characters?
``The Chimp Channel'' (7:05 p.m. Thursday, TBS) is a half-hour
sitcom, neatly replacing ``Friends'' if you think about it.
</P>
<P>
   The all-ape experience, as TBS likes to say, is a spin-off of
its popular between-show fillers called ``Monkey-ed Movies,'' which
used apes to spoof popular movies. Viewers loved the idea so much
that TBS decided to make a series out of it.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, we see that cable is the land of the really big
thinkers.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the problem with reviewing ``The Chimp Channel.'' I
couldn't help but stare at the screen and say, ``Are you kidding
me?'' Even worse _ I was liking it. When you find yourself
dissecting the premise as well as plot twists while watching
monkeys, then two things are abundantly clear: 1) It's June and the
TV season should be over; and 2) Because it's not, you have TV
poisoning.
</P>
<P>
   As part of me kept thinking, ``Houston, we have a problem,'' the
other part said that absurdity is a good thing and that this is a
show far superior to much of the creatively blanched network
offerings. And so, you go with it. That'd be my advice. Because
``The Chimp Channel'' has moments when you're laughing out loud.
It's only when you catch yourself, look around the room and think,
``I've been reduced to laughing at monkeys in wigs,'' that there
may be a tiny question about sanity or a bigger issue about taste.
</P>
<P>
   Too late. I watched two episodes and if it is the end of
television creativity as we know it, count me in.
</P>
<P>
   Monkeys in wigs are funny. Maybe not as funny in January as they
are in June, but funny nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's good to have a TV show you don't have to watch every week.
A show like ``The Chimp Channel'' is disposable. It takes the
stress off you. If you catch it, great. If you miss it _ hey, just
a bunch of monkeying around. No big deal.
</P>
<P>
   The premise _ and, yes, there is a premise _ of this show is
that a handful of simians are running TCC, ``The Chimp Channel.''
The fictional network airs movies, TV series, news and commercials.
(All starring chimps.)
</P>
<P>
   The characters include Ford Carter, the owner of TCC, who is
seen only on his jet, often leering at women. He has an Australian
accent, so if you guessed Rupert Murdoch, you're pop savvy enough
to continue watching this show.
</P>
<P>
   There's Harry Waller, TCC president. Straight out of central
casting. Brock Hammond _ ``hunky star'' _ who often is forced to be
in every TCC show because of budget problems (and he often plays
more than one role in each). Then there's superdiva Marina,
``ruthless and power mad'' and meant to be a cross between Pamela
Anderson and Madonna.
</P>
<P>
   There's Murray Price, a not-so-subtle jab at Larry King, a
celebrity interviewer and multiple-marriage bed-hopper. Timmy Briar
is the young intern (played by a cute monkey, by the way), who is
naive beyond belief. There's Candy, the makeup girl, who is sweet
but also sarcastic. And there are the two writers of most of the
shows, Biff, a slacker (he's actually a nice send-up of real-life
young TV writers), and Stan (a thinly veiled Woody Allen type).
TCC's news anchor is George W. Heinlein, and the ``W'' indicates he
takes himself very seriously.
</P>
<P>
   What gets spoofed on ``The Chimp Channel''? Everything. There's
``Treewatch,'' complete with red bathing suits. ``NYPD Zoo,'' an
Ebert-like character for ``Movies on Film,'' Larry King's show, and
a bevy of modern hits such as ``Ally McBeal,'' ``The X- Files,''
``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' and even ``The Teletubbies.''
</P>
<P>
   Often these spoofs are dead on, so if you're a fan you'll be
laughing.
</P>
<P>
   In the pilot, there's a nice skewering of ``Touched by an
Angel,'' which becomes ``Touched by an Anvil,`` and ``America's
Most Uncomfortable Videos,'' a deadly send-up of all those groin
thwacks.
</P>
<P>
   When the spoofing is done, it's the behind-the-scenes moments
with the characters that drive the narrative. That is, if the laws
of criticism even allow the use of ``drive the narrative'' when
referring to monkeys in clothes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chimp Channel'' isn't always funny. It's often just silly.
</P>
<P>
   Other times, it's hilarious. And sometimes it's surprisingly
racy.
</P>
<P>
   But you don't need much more to go on than this: We're talking
about apes, here. Dressed up like dolls. With a ``Mystery Science
Theater 3000'' sensibility.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't PBS. But then again, it's probably not as low as TV
will go.

BUSH PLEDGES HE'LL OPPOSE ANY INCOME TAX INCREASE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JAY ROOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Read his letter: Gov. George W. Bush will
``oppose and veto'' any income tax increases if he's elected
president.
</P>
<P>
   Reminiscent of the famous ``read my lips, no new taxes'' pledge
his father lived to regret, the son of former President Bush made
the promise in a letter to Grover Norquist of the influential
Americans for Tax Reform of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will oppose and veto any increase in individual or corporate
marginal income tax rates or individual or corporate income tax
hikes,'' Bush wrote.
</P>
<P>
   He also promised the group that he would oppose any efforts to
wipe out tax deductions or credits unless they were offset ``dollar
for dollar'' by tax rate cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said such increases would hurt the country's ability to
provide ``high quality, high paying jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, then Vice President George Bush told the nation he
would not stand for any new taxes if elected president. Two years
later, in a decision many say cost him re-election, President Bush
accepted tax increases as part of a deficit reduction package.
</P>
<P>
   Some have accused Gov. George W. Bush of committing a similar
gaffe by promising in a 1994 letter to oppose any increases in the
state sales tax. As governor three years later, Bush proposed a
sales tax increase _ unsuccessfully _ but said he didn't break his
word because it was part of a broader package of tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   The new tax pledge came as Bush begins to firm up his political
positions in advance of his first out-of-state trip to drum up
support for an all-but-certain 2000 presidential run.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Tuesday, just days before he heads for the
first-test states of Iowa and New Hampshire, the man widely
regarded as the Republican presidential front-runner broke a long
silence on one of the most gut-wrenching political decisions in
U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   He said he believes that President Clinton should have been
removed from office because of improprieties stemming from his
involvement with White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who had steadfastly declined to take a position on the
impeachment and subsequent trial of the president when it was
happening, told reporters he would have voted for Clinton's removal
in February if he had been a member of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have voted for it, yes,'' Bush said. Asked why, the
governor said: ``Because I thought the man lied.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was impeached by the House in December on two charges _
perjury and obstruction of justice _ stemming from his trysts with
Lewinsky. He was acquitted two months later by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   On the day of the acquittal, Bush declined to say whether he
thought the Senate made the right decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``A decision was made, and that's the good news,'' he said.
``It's off our TV screens, hopefully.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Bush defended his early, cautious approach: ``I
didn't talk about it during the time because I thought the House
and Senate members could make up their minds. I did say it was
embarrassment, and I did say it was important to blow the whistle
on not telling the truth.''

`THAT NEWSWOMAN' REPORTS ON LIFE IN THE FIRING LINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ZACHARY COILE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Were it not for the televised presidential news
conference, Helen Thomas speculates that she would be as anonymous
as any other wire-service reporter in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, television has made the veteran White House
correspondent for United Press International something of a
celebrity _ or, as she puts it, a ``bit player on the national
stage.''
</P>
<P>
   When the president steps to the podium, the cameras dwell on him
for a moment, then zoom in on the diminutive woman in the front
row, hunched over a note pad, whose seniority has earned her the
right to ask the first question at presidential news conferences.
</P>
<P>
   She says she often is stopped on the street or at airports by
strangers. ``What's the president really like?'' they ask.
</P>
<P>
   Often they urge her to pester the commander-in-chief for more
answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll say, `Keep asking those tough questions' and `You're
talking for us,''' Thomas said in a recent interview. ``Sometimes,
they'll look at you and do a double take, and then they sort of
place you. `Aren't you that newswoman? Aren't you the woman they
love to hate?'''
</P>
<P>
   In 38 years on the White House beat, she has covered every
president from Kennedy to Clinton. She is the longest-serving
correspondent at the White House and the first woman to take over
the tradition of closing a news conference with, ``Thank you, Mr.
President.''
</P>
<P>
   She has become enough of a White House fixture that in
Hollywood's 1993 presidential parody, ``Dave,'' she was asked to
play herself. When the president, played by Kevin Kline, makes a
supposedly bold policy announcement, the camera catches Thomas
rolling her eyes. Asked later if she was coached by the director,
she claimed, ``It was a natural reaction.''
</P>
<P>
   A pioneering journalist, she was one of the first female
reporters at the White House to cover the president rather than the
first lady. An outspoken feminist, she helped browbeat the
previously all-male National Press Club into accepting women
members.
</P>
<P>
   Now Thomas has written a new book, ``Front Row at the White
House'' (Scribner, $26), a memoir of four decades spent covering
eight presidents _ Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, Ford, Carter, Reagan,
Bush and Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   On a tour to promote the book, she said she has no plans to
retire, even as she approaches her 79th birthday in August.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll never leave my job,'' she said. ``I love my work. When
you love your work, it's not work.''
</P>
<P>
   Known for her relentless questioning, she has gotten under the
skin of every president she's covered. Although Clinton has called
her ``the embodiment of fearless integrity,'' Gerald Ford called
her approach a ``fine blend of journalism and acupuncture.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They hate us,'' Thomas said of the relations between the
president and the White House press corps. ``They wish that they
could blow a whistle and we would be there when they need us. But
we really are a pain in the neck to them.''
</P>
<P>
   For Thomas, who is on leave, the book tour has its perks.
</P>
<P>
   After arriving at the Hotel Nikko in San Francisco last week,
she was recognized at the front desk and the hotel staff upgraded
her room to a lavish suite.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in a cream-colored suit and a double strand of pearls,
she talked about her middle-class upbringing in Depression-era
Detroit and her start in journalism.
</P>
<P>
   She was the seventh of nine children born to parents who
immigrated from Syria at the turn of the century. Her Arab lineage
is a little-known fact, even in Washington, mostly because of her
Anglo-Saxon last name. Her father's surname, Antonious, was
Anglicized to Thomas by an immigration officer at Ellis Island in
1892.
</P>
<P>
   Though a member of the only Arab family on a block of Italians
and Germans, Thomas never viewed herself as an Arab-American. As
she writes in the new book, ``We did not think of ourselves as
hyphenates, which seems to be the standard description when one
talks of ethnic background. The term melting pot has fallen into
disrepute these days, but that is how we saw ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither of her parents could read or write English, but Thomas
found her passion writing for her high school newspaper. After
college, she moved to Washington. Her first job was as a copy girl
for The Washington Daily News. As more men were drafted to fight in
World War II, she was promoted to cover local news.
</P>
<P>
   When the war ended, many of the same men returned to reclaim
their jobs, forcing women reporters out. But Thomas, who was then
working the early-morning shift writing radio stories for United
Press, stayed on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was going to work at 5:30 in the morning,'' she recalled.
``No one really wanted my job, so I lucked out.''
</P>
<P>
   When she first started at the White House in 1961 after John F.
Kennedy's election, women reporters there were seen largely as
society columnists. And many of her early reports were about what
the first lady wore or about daughter Caroline and her pets. But
being at the White House also meant covering the daily news
briefings, and Thomas soon found herself writing about the
president.
</P>
<P>
   As she began to cover the same stories as her male counterparts,
she bristled at the rules that barred women from the National Press
Club. She joined a revolt with other female journalists to open the
club to women.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't belong to the National Press Club, because I was a
woman, until 1971. 1971!'' Thomas said, still incredulous.
</P>
<P>
   The book is, at times, too narrowly focused on the minutiae of
her years in Washington. For example, an entire chapter is devoted
to her favorite D.C. restaurant. But sprinkled throughout the book
are bright anecdotes and often trenchant insights into the tense
relations between presidents and the White House correspondents.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In October 1965, when Thomas surprised President Lyndon Johnson
by breaking a story about his 18-year-old daughter, Luci, flying to
Texas with a boyfriend to get her father's blessing for an
engagement, a fuming LBJ had his daughter's plane diverted from the
airport to avoid reporters. The engagement was announced two months
later.
</P>
<P>
   After Ford earned a reputation for stumbling, falling down
stairs and bumping his head, Thomas tells how his press secretary
hid reporters behind bushes when Ford was boarding a helicopter to
try to keep them from witnessing more mishaps.
</P>
<P>
   She also describes the emotion of seeing Air Force One return to
Andrews Air Force Base with the body of a slain JFK and watching
Jackie Kennedy deplane, still wearing her blood-stained pink wool
suit. Thomas says she was holding back tears as she dictated
another reporter's account of the assassination over the phone.
</P>
<P>
   In the book, she discusses her 11-year marriage to her former
competitor at the White House, Doug Cornell of the Associated
Press. Thomas helped care for him during his last years as he
suffered from Alzheimer's disease. He died in 1972 at age 75.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas said her younger UPI colleagues do most of the travel
with the president, but she still clocks in at the White House most
mornings by 5:30 a.m. and hates to be beat by competitors.

<P>
   Attention, fashion firms that are still showing baggy pants:
Hip-hop style has moved on. Oversized clothes from head to toe are
out.
</P>
<P>
   Try a more tailored look. That's the consensus of four New
York-based trend spotters _ Jane Rinzler Buckingham, president of
Youth Intelligence; Liz DiPilli, director of Project X; Haysun
Hahn, director of Bureau de Style; and Andy Hilfiger, vice
president of public relations for Tommy Jeans _ who were asked what
will be hot over the next two years not only in fashion, but in
music, which is playing an increased role in design inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   These connoisseurs of cool talked about emerging cultural trends
and offered some specifics on where the color palette is heading.
</P>
<P>
   They also indicated that the relentless advance of technology
was a motivating factor in a growing interest in clothes that offer
the kind of craftsmanship associated with a simpler age.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of their predictions:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LIZ DIPILLI, Project X, which tracks trends among 14- to
29-year-olds &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DiPilli, whose past and current clients include RJR Reynolds,
Reebok and Conde Nast, said she tracks styles in cities such as New
York, Miami, San Francisco, London and Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are seeing a more structured look,'' she said.``This whole
baggy clothes look is fading fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Cargo pants, for example, are getting slimmer. Another trend
DiPilli believes is getting stronger is an interest in handmade
looks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fabric bags made in velvet, corduroy or denim are becoming
more important,'' she said. ``Overall, there's an interest in
anything embroidered or anything that has beadwork.''
</P>
<P>
   DiPilli pointed out that consumers' interest in the environment,
together with a continued longing for spirituality, is only going
to get stronger.
</P>
<P>
   She sees an increased interest in world music, whether French,
Afro-Caribbean or Eastern European. Hip-hop, she said, continues to
be a powerful force, but it is starting to break out into different
strains.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's salsa hip-hop, Afro-Caribbean hip-hop,'' she said.
``You will start seeing it further fracture.'' .
</P>

</P>
<P>
   &UR; JANE RINZLER BUCKINGHAM, president, Youth Intelligence, which
advises such clients as Coca-Cola, MTV, Polo Jeans, Chanel and
Sprint &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Buckingham scours the streets of New York, as well as college
towns such as Austin, Texas; Boulder, Colo.; Burlington, Vt.; and
Chapel Hill, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   She pointed out that she not only checks out college students
for inspiration, but also recent graduates, who might still be
living in those towns.
</P>
<P>
   Buckingham also cited the Williamsburg area of Brooklyn, an
increasingly attractive area for young people because the rents
there are much more affordable than in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Other areas she visits are Salt Lake City, where she sees a
``weird punk movement going on,'' as well as London and Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   Buckingham believes fashion trends will be coming out of
less-traveled places such as South Africa and China, where there is
increased access.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can see people getting inspired by accessories from China,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   With the growth of all the Internet technology, Buckingham
believes that those very same young people who are plugging in to
cyberspace want to ``counterbalance'' it by wearing fashions that
are or feel custom-made.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is so impersonal,'' she said. ``It is driven by
speed and function. It is not like they are going to walk away from
technology, but there is a real interest in luxury fabrics. There's
an interest in special details, in craftsmanship, in beading.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   &UR; HAYSUN HAHN, director of Bureau de Style, which tracks trends for a
diverse list of companies, from Escada to Samsung &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Much of the '90s has been about developing a democratic
individual style, mixing a Prada handbag with a tank from Kmart,
for example.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Hahn sees the emergence of a class of ``elite snobs,'' who
buy only the top designer brands and won't dream of mixing status
brands with cheaper ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are the absolute design victims. They wear only Prada and
other designs _ even for just comfort,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   This trend, she said, started about a year and a half ago, when
some of the top designers, such as Prada, Gucci and Donna Karan,
went after utilitarian looks, serving up $1,000 hooded zip-front
jackets in luxurious cashmere, or rubber-soled shoes that sell for
$270.
</P>
<P>
   Then, of course, there are the Gucci denim jeans with holes that
retail for more than $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, we had an idea that a pair of khaki pants or a
T-shirt had a specific value,'' Hahn said. ``But not any more.''
</P>
<P>
   The opposite of the ``elite snob'' class is what Hahn calls
``the celebrity, media-conscious'' type who prefers glitzier
makeup, bright colors, and wants to look sexy.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are the big fans of Spice Girls and Jerry Springer's
show,'' she said. ``They are into clothes that make you sexy. They
are not into the design of the clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   Hahn believes retailers and apparel firms in both of these
categories must take note of this.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to make an instant connection with their consumer in
a much more exclusive, segmented, lifestyle way,'' she said. ``It
is not about buying a designer product and then going to the Gap to
buy your T-shirt.''
</P>
<P>
   Retailers catering to the affluent must offer appropriate
services that pamper the customers, she said, while stores that
target those taken in by celebrity need to develop appropriate
partnerships with pop singers and the like.
</P>
<P>
   As for specific trends, Hahn sees a growing importance in
clothes that shape the body, such as the carryalls that wrap around
the body.
</P>
<P>
   She also sees a continued interest in necklines and believes
styles such as cowlnecks will be important over the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be about the midriff,'' she said. ``Now, it has
moved up.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   &UR; ANDY HILFIGER, vice president of public relations at Tommy Jeans,
whose job is to develop alliances with music stars: &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hilfiger's favorite New York hangouts are Sway, a club on
Greenwich Street, and Nell's, on West 14th Street, which features
hip-hop music on Sunday nights. He believes the connection between
music and fashion will grow even stronger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next year, you will see more and more musicians aligning with
clothing companies,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Jeans, which sponsored the Rolling Stones' ``No Security''
tour, has plans to design special stage gear for Britney Spears.
</P>
<P>
   As reported, Tommy Girl, produced under license by Estee
Lauder's Aramis division, is one of the sponsors of the Lilith
Fair.
</P>
<P>
   Hilfiger described the latest music scene, featuring such stars
as Spears, Backstreet Boys and N-Sync who are inspired by R&AMP;B, as
``hip pop.''
</P>
<P>
   As for hip-hop fashions, Hilfiger pointed out that the trend is
not about having a complete baggy look.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is about either having a tight top and a loose bottom, or
vice versa,'' he said. ``The future is mixing a T-shirt with
designer collection pants.''
</P>
<P>
   He also pointed to the trend of mixing athleticwear with
fashion, citing athletic nylon basketball pants with cropped
leather jackets.
</P>
<P>
   Hilfiger believes the fashion industry's interest in the
American rock scene of decades ago is only going to get stronger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Designers are looking at rock 'n' roll groups of the '60s and
'70s, and recreating it for the '90s,'' he said. &QL;

<P>
   Much of the '90s has been about developing a democratic
individual style, mixing a Prada handbag with a tank from Kmart,

</P>
<P>
   Now, Hahn sees the emegence of a class of ``elite snobs,'' who
buy only the top designer brands and won't dream of mixing status
brands with cheaper ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are the absolute design victims. They wear only Prada and
other designs _ even for just comfort,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   This trend, she said, started about a year and a half ago, when
some of the top designers, such as Prada, Gucci and Donna Karan,
went after utilitarian looks, serving up $1,000 hooded zip-front
jackets in luxurious cashmere, or rubber-soled shoes that sell for
$270.
</P>
<P>
   Then, of course, there are the Gucci denim jeans with holes that
retail for more than $1,000.

<P>
   ``In the past, we had an idea that a pair of khaki pants or a
T-shirt had a specific value,'' Hahn said. ``But not any more.''
</P>
<P>
   The opposite of the ``elite snob'' class is what Hahn calls
``the celebrity, media-conscious'' type who prefers glitzier
makeup, bright colors, and wants to look sexy.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are the big fans of Spice Girls and Jerry Springer's
show,'' she said. ``They are into clothes that make you sexy. They
are not into the design of the clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   Hahn believes retailers and apparel firms in both of these
categories must take note of this.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to make an instant connection with their consumer in
a much more exclusive, segmented, lifestyle way,'' she said. ``It
is not about buying a designer product and then going to the Gap to
buy your T-shirt.''
</P>
<P>
   Retailers catering to the affluent must offer appropriate
services that pamper the customers, she said, while stores that
target those taken in by celebrity need to develop appropriate
partnerships with pop singers and the like.
</P>
<P>
   As for specific trends, Hahn sees a growing importance in
clothes that shape the body, such as the carryalls that wrap around
the body.
</P>
<P>
   She also sees a continued interest in necklines and believes
styles such as cowlnecks will be important over the next two years.
</P>

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Attention, fashion firms that are still showing baggy pants:
Hip-hop style has moved on. Oversized clothes from head to toe are
out.
</P>
<P>
   Try a more tailored look. That's the consensus of four New
York-based trend spotters _ Jane Rinzler Buckingham, president of
Youth Intelligence; Liz DiPilli, director of Project X; Haysun
Hahn, director of Bureau de Style; and Andy Hilfiger, vice
president of public relations for Tommy Jeans _ who were asked what
will be hot over the next two years not only in fashion, but in
music, which is playing an increased role in design inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   These connoisseurs of cool talked about emerging cultural trends
and offered some specifics on where the color palette is heading.
</P>
<P>
   They also indicated that the relentless advance of technology
was a motivating factor in a growing interest in clothes that offer
the kind of craftsmanship associated with a simpler age.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of their predictions:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LIZ DIPILLI, Project X, which tracks trends among 14- to
29-year-olds &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DiPilli, whose past and current clients include RJR Reynolds,
Reebok and Conde Nast, said she tracks styles in cities such as New
York, Miami, San Francisco, London and Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are seeing a more structured look,'' she said.``This whole
baggy clothes look is fading fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Cargo pants, for example, are getting slimmer. Another trend
DiPilli believes is getting stronger is an interest in handmade
looks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fabric bags made in velvet, corduroy or denim are becoming
more important,'' she said. ``Overall, there's an interest in
anything embroidered or anything that has beadwork.''
</P>
<P>
   DiPilli pointed out that consumers' interest in the environment,
together with a continued longing for spirituality, is only going
to get stronger.
</P>
<P>
   She sees an increased interest in world music, whether French,
Afro-Caribbean or Eastern European. Hip-hop, she said, continues to
be a powerful force, but it is starting to break out into different
strains.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's salsa hip-hop, Afro-Caribbean hip-hop,'' she said.
``You will start seeing it further fracture.'' .

   &UR; JANE RINZLER BUCKINGHAM, president, Youth Intelligence, which
advises such clients as Coca-Cola, MTV, Polo Jeans, Chanel and
Sprint &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Buckingham scours the streets of New York, as well as college
towns such as Austin, Texas; Boulder, Colo.; Burlington, Vt.; and
Chapel Hill, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   She pointed out that she not only checks out college students
for inspiration, but also recent graduates, who might still be
living in those towns.
</P>
<P>
   Buckingham also cited the Williamsburg area of Brooklyn, an
increasingly attractive area for young people because the rents
there are much more affordable than in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Other areas she visits are Salt Lake City, where she sees a
``weird punk movement going on,'' as well as London and Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   Buckingham believes fashion trends will be coming out of
less-traveled places such as South Africa and China, where there is
increased access.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can see people getting inspired by accessories from China,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   With the growth of all the Internet technology, Buckingham
believes that those very same young people who are plugging in to

are or feel custom-made.

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   So. Is the war over or not?
</P>
<P>
   You'd have thought from listening to the weekend gabfests on
television and reading the ponderings of the pundits in the Sunday
papers that the last bomb had been dropped, the last missile fired,
the last civilian structure inadvertently blown to smithereens.
</P>
<P>
   But then Monday rolled around, and suddenly the peace plan that
was being touted as the ``endgame'' in NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia
was coming unglued and the war was on again.
</P>
<P>
   By Tuesday, nobody seemed to know which end was up: One news
report warned of ``significant roadblocks'' to peace, while another
promised that the deal was about to ``fall back into place.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it all depended on which spinmeisters were talking to
which newshounds.
</P>
<P>
   The head spinmeister, of course, is William Jefferson Clinton,
president of the United States. But Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright is no slouch when it comes to the art of spinning, which
as we know requires the spinner to say nothing and make it sound
like something.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what Albright said, according to The Associated Press:
</P>
<P>
   ``We are putting the pieces into place. It all depends on
compliance, verifiable compliance.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, sure. Everybody knew that. Didn't they?
</P>
<P>
   The problem for Albright, Clinton and other happy warriors who
are trying to paint this Yugoslav military adventure as a great
success is a simple one: It isn't a great success.
</P>
<P>
   If the good guys had really won this war against indicted war
criminal Slobodan Milosevic _ as the commentators have been
suggesting for days on end _ wouldn't they be dictating the terms
of peace instead of negotiating with him? It's one of the few good
things about war: The side that wins gets to tell the side that
loses what's going to happen next.
</P>
<P>
   But then, when the war is a half-baked operation like the one
NATO has been conducting against Yugoslavia, it only stands to
reason that the result will be half-baked as well. By taking the
option of a ground invasion off the table at the outset, NATO _ or
should we say Clinton? _ could achieve victory only by bombing
Milosevic into submission.
</P>
<P>
   That obviously hasn't happened. Milosevic clearly had enough
fight left in him by the time NATO proclaimed peace to be at hand
that he was able to throw up ``significant roadblocks'' to the
cessation of hostilities.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to dictate to a dictator, you have to bring him to
his knees. And the smart money has said all along that you can't do
that with bombing alone.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, let's give Clinton and NATO the benefit of the doubt.
Let's say that the air campaign has achieved the hoped-for result:
an agreement under which Milosevic will remove Serbian troops from
Kosovo and allow an international peacekeeping force to oversee the
return of ethnic Albanians to their homes.
</P>
<P>
   That may constitute victory as Clinton and the spinmeisters
define it, but it's no victory in any meaningful sense of the word.
Such an arrangement merely intensifies American involvement in the
Balkans, merely drags the U.S. deeper into the quagmire of ethnic,
political and religious strife that has plagued the region for
hundreds of years.
</P>
<P>
   The peacekeepers _ a significant number of whom will be
Americans _ will be tantamount to an occupying force in Yugoslavia.
But they will be occupying a country that they haven't conquered, a
horrendous situation that was virtually guaranteed when Clinton
ruled out the use of ground forces.
</P>
<P>
   Which is not to say that a ground war would have been a good
idea. It would have been a mistake, just as the air war was a
mistake.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. involvement in a European civil war that is not, never was
and never will be our business is a no-win situation,
notwithstanding any claims of victory by the idea's instigators.
</P>
<P>
   Even if this poorly conceived and executed war should
miraculously bring peace and stability to a part of the world where
war and instability have been the status quo for centuries, it was
a terrible idea.
</P>
<P>
   And it's only getting worse.

 CPT- DOCTORS-INTERNET-TEX 
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROLYN POIROT c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram  FORT WORTH,
Texas _ Someday soon, you will be able to dial ``star'' DR
(''star'' 37) on your push-button phone, ask your medical
questions, and get within hours personalized answers from a doctor
who specializes in your medical problems.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The telephone, that most basic of communication tools, is being
integrated with computer software, radio and television to get
consumers the medical information they want when they want it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Information exchange is going to be ``the issue'' in medicine
for at least the next 20 years,'' says Dr. Bob Lanier,
physician-broadcaster and president-elect of the Tarrant County
Medical Society, who is already aggressively using the Internet to
provide information for a growing number of people with health-care
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   His Web site, www.askdrbob.com, averages 1,000 hits a day, and
he gets 300 to 400 e-mail questions daily.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to a new software package Lanier has created, he is able
to answer a lot of questions very quickly, but he is enlisting the
help of a dozen other Tarrant County physicians, specializing in
various areas, to help with the service as it grows worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next phase will involve live chats, and we will have the
ability to push people to the Web sites they need,'' Lanier says.
``Every disease you can think of has dozens of Web sites, and there
are pharmacists available 24 hours a day to answer drug questions.
You can get people psychotherapy over the Web.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea for the new medical service to coordinate and expand
the computer services already in effect came up when Lanier
realized that his ``Sixty Second Housecall'' television and radio
broadcasts were generating a lot of questions from people in
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The medical advice program is carried over 17 stations in Canada
and 47 stations in this country, yet more than 60 percent of his
e-mail was coming from Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, why would people in a country where health care is
free use this service so much, and I realized it's because they
have to wait even longer for their medical care than Americans.
People can't get into their doctors' offices,'' Lanier says.
</P>
<P>
   In general, Lanier gets the most questions from young boys and
older women, who seem to use the service in part because they want
to remain anonymous.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers ask questions they don't feel comfortable asking in
person. Women often ask about sexual function, new mothers about
colic, young boys about their genitalia, little girls about
menstrual cycles and child abuse.''
</P>
<P>
   Lanier says he often makes referrals, including international
referrals to allergists he knows in Scotland and France. When he
doesn't know a specialist needed in a particular part of the
country, he tells people how to contact their own local medical
societies and how to ask for the information they need.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's possible now to have this global reach, to help people
all over the world,'' Lanier says. ``We are there to give
information, but not medical therapy. It's not exactly practicing
medicine. We're not writing prescriptions or doing diagnostic
tests. Our action step is education.''

SOFTWARE FIRMS EMPOWER A RESURGENT HIGH-TECH SECTOR

 By KIMBERLY BLANTON   c.1999 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOWELL, Mass. _ The old office is empty on the 14th floor of the
former Wang Laboratories tower, where John Thibault once addressed
his boss, ``Dr. Wang,'' about the day's business.
</P>
<P>
   But one floor below, 10 years later, Thibault has built a
technology empire of his own. Geotel Communications Corp.'s offices
whir with personal computers as 300 employees design the software
used by American Express, Fidelity Investments, and the nation's
major airlines to route customer calls.
</P>
<P>
   Last April, Thibault and Geotel's other founders received the
ultimate endorsement of their success: Cisco Systems Inc., the
nation's largest computer networking company, agreed to buy their
5-year-old firm for $1.9 billion.
</P>
<P>
   After a decade of upheaval, in which the giants of the high-tech
community in Massachusetts have faded away, a new generation of
companies like Geotel has risen to take their place. Unlike their
predecessors, which staked their fortunes on making computers, the
hundreds of start-ups that now dominate the state's high-tech
landscape are selling software rather than hardware and ideas and
services rather than products.
</P>
<P>
   They are, to a large extent, creatures of new technologies,
especially the Internet. Many are small ventures, with only a
handful of employees. Most will never approach the size of Wang or
Digital Equipment Corp., the once-giant companies synonymous with
the Route 128 culture of the 1980s. Instead, like Geotel, many are
being acquired when they are only a few years old by larger
companies hungry for their innovations.
</P>
<P>
   As these new companies have flourished, they have created a
high-tech economy that is far broader than it was a decade ago,
with a dozen or so sectors ranging from telecommunications to
Internet software development.
</P>
<P>
   ``Massachusetts has probably the most diverse set of high-tech
companies in the country,'' said Sara Johnson, an economist and
former member of the state Council on Economic Growth and
Technology. ``Most other tech centers are focused on one or two
industry clusters. We have them all.''
</P>
<P>
   And these high-tech companies have also been a major force in
propelling growth in a variety of industries from financial
services to medicine, driving employment to record levels in
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers help illuminate the transformation of the high-tech
industry in Massachusetts:
</P>
<P>
   --Employment in software and Internet companies jumped 75
percent from 1992 through 1997, to 68,983 jobs from 39,501 jobs,
according to a study by the Massachusetts Technology Collaborative,
a privately funded research group. During the prior five years, the
gain was a modest 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   --Massachusetts is now home to some 2,751 software companies, up
from 800 in 1989, according to the Massachusetts Software Council,
a trade organization.
</P>
<P>
   --About half of the high-tech workers in the state hold
nonmanufacturing jobs, a shift from 1988 when more than two-thirds
of the technology work force was employed by manufacturers,
according to the state's Department of Employment and Training.
</P>
<P>
   The dramatic changes in the high-tech industry are being driven
by a new generation of entrepreneurs and engineers, many of whom
were educated in Boston and stayed after graduation. Some left jobs
at Wang, Digital and other established companies to start anew.
They are taking advantage of a wave of capital generated by a
booming stock market and a so-far unwavering belief that the
Internet is transforming the US economy.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, venture capital firms poured a record $141 million a
month into fledgling Massachusetts companies, according to the
accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers. The total of $1.7 billion
invested last year was more than triple 1995's investment of $470
million.
</P>
<P>
   The ventures started with this money epitomize a new high-tech
culture where employees seem animated by ideas more than loyalty to
any one company. Ken Lang, the chief technology officer for Lycos
Inc., the state's most prominent Internet company, put it simply:
``I don't think there are 1950s company men any more, especially in
the Internet industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Lang's path to Waltham-based Lycos, an Internet search service,
began after he graduated from Duke with a quadruple major in
physics, computer science, math and engineering. He quit work on a
doctorate in artificial intelligence, on the advice of his
professor and Lycos founder Michael Mauldin, and started WiseWire,
which compiles profiles of Internet users. Last year, Lycos bought
WiseWire _ and hired Lang.
</P>
<P>
   Two walls of Lang's office are whiteboards covered with a
magic-marker rainbow of diagrams of ``mind-blowing'' ideas for new
products, including a game site and an interactive Web site. He
sees his job as not just designing products but as shaping the
World Wide Web's future. ``When you're stepping into areas nobody
has stepped into before, it's up to you to decide what the future
is like,'' Lang said.
</P>
<P>
   While other Massachusetts high-tech companies have become
national names _ EMC Corp. in Franklin, for example, has become the
dominant maker of computer-storage systems _ most remain largely
unknown, with mysterious sounding names like Altiga Networks,
Sapient, and Dragon Systems.
</P>
<P>
   Often, they are nearly invisible because they focus on
``under-the-hood'' software or services used by other businesses.
Many are start-ups barely off the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Five months ago, Tom Leighton, a math professor at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and one of his students, Dan
Lewin, started Akamai Technologies Inc. in Cambridge's Kendall
Square, a high-tech mecca. The pair are using mathematics in an
attempt to solve a vexing problem on the Internet: system crashes
like the one that occurred when millions of users tried to visit a
Victoria's Secret fashion show that was advertised during last
year's Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Dolce, chief executive of Redstone Communications Inc. in
Westford, compared the Internet to the Industrial Revolution of a
century ago. His company _ and others clustered along Interstate
495 _ is developing technology to enable telephone, cable, and
computer companies to handle the exponential growth in the amount
of data moving through the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet ``has changed from a toy _ an entertainment device
_ to a real business tool,'' Dolce said. ``No one realizes  &UR; today &LR; 
the kind of impact this will have in the next five years.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the Internet, the breathtaking expansion of the
technology sector in Massachusetts has grown to encompass other
businesses. The state is experiencing a boom, for example, in
computer consulting companies, such as Cambridge Technology
Partners and Sapient, that help clients update computers and
software systems. Boston has become a center for the design and
sale of interactive CD-ROMs for education and business, an industry
that didn't even exist 10 years ago. And increased use of computer
technology over the past decade has driven innovations and growth
by medical device companies in the state.
</P>
<P>
   These changes and more have created a high-tech economy that is
much different from a decade ago when high tech meant one thing:
manufacturing. The computer giants that fueled the high-tech boom
in the 1980s, such as Digital and Wang, failed to keep up with the
PC revolution. As computer manufacturing headed south, these giants
suffered massive layoffs that devastated the state's entire
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1990, said Craig Moore, an economics professor at
University of Massachusetts at Amherst, ``a lot of economists were
saying, `Did we just go over the precipice?' It was devastating. ''
But, the economy  &UR; today &LR;  ``doesn't look anything like it did in
1990,'' he added. ``We now have 10 or 12 major industries (in
high-tech) that have grown and flourished.''
</P>
<P>
   While the industry has successfully remade itself, some of the
high-tech jobs that were lost in the late 1980s and early 1990s
still have not been replaced. According to the Massachusetts
Division of Employment and Training, 303,300 residents work in the
high tech industry _ 31,900 fewer than in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   But Richard deKaser, an economist for BankBoston Corp., stressed
that these numbers are based on old and outmoded ways of measuring
high-tech employment. The impact of the booming industry goes far
beyond companies counted as high-tech concerns by the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``The employment numbers tend to underrepresent the importance
of the industry'' to the state's economy, DeKaser said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the high-tech transformation has brought lasting changes
to Massachusetts' work force and has spilled into businesses as
seemingly unrelated to the industry as financial services.
</P>
<P>
   At State Street Bank &AMP; Trust Co.'s computer operation in Quincy,
Herbert Clark oversees a state-of-the art system that tracks $4.8
trillion in investment dollars as closely as NASA tracks a space
flight. Clark, who grew up in Braintree and attended Blue Hills
Technical College, clearly prefers this challenging job to his
previous job in the checking-processing department of a bank,
because ``the technology's constantly changing.''
</P>
<P>
   The transformation in the high-tech sector has also forced
employees of the old economy to change with it.
</P>
<P>
   Workers such as Bob O'Brien, 46, have been retrained after years
of joblessness. Laid off by Wang in 1990, O'Brien said he is just
as busy now working in EMC's immaculate huge new plant in Franklin,
where data-storage computers are tested in a steamy tropical room,
a ``cool room,'' and a ``vibrating room.''
</P>
<P>
   While O'Brien has benefited from a surge in EMC's employment to
3,800 currently _ and 1,200 more will be hired this year _ his
memories of the 1980s bust still sting: ``The whole world stopped
spinning,'' he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien speaks with some disbelief about the sweeping changes he
has witnessed firsthand. ``I never would have thought,'' he said,
``it would be at this same pace as it was in the mid to late
'80s.''

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   &HT;    Opening lives by keyboard
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A little more than a year ago, Sharon Mazzotti's
foster son, Danny, walked through the door of her home for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
   Danny is mentally and physically handicapped. When he walked in,
his head hung low, like he had just been caught stealing. He was
17, and he was not able to brush his teeth or bathe himself.
Cerebral palsy kept his hands in an almost permanent fist.
</P>
<P>
   Much of that has since changed. And Mazzotti, 55, attributes it
to a computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do,'' she said. ``Learning how to do basic things on a
computer opened a door. It made him realize he could think, that he
could use his brain. If you could have seen him when he walked
through this door, just his posture and his facial expressions. Now
he stands up straighter. We never have to tell him to hold his head
up anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Danny took computer classes on Saturdays through a group started
by Tony Perrone.
</P>
<P>
   A former computer network administrator, Perrone was injured in
1986 when a pickup truck he was working on fell on him. He has not
had use of his legs since. But he still had his computer expertise.
</P>
<P>
   After a few years of physical therapy and a few unsuccessful
attempts at trying to get paid for what he knew, Perrone, 58,
decided to give it away.
</P>
<P>
   By 1994, word had spread among the North Georgia disabled
community that Perrone had a lot of computer knowledge and a lot of
free time. People started calling, asking if he could help their
disabled children learn how to run a PC. Perrone would come to them
and teach, for free. He asked for gas money in return.
</P>
<P>
   Demand grew, and Perrone started a training center. In September
1997, he opened Project Re-Compute, with two metro Atlanta offices.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could still do it, but when you go for a job in one of
these,'' Perrone said, gesturing toward his wheelchair, ``they
don't see you, they see the wheelchair. I felt if they could do
this to me and I've got a master's degree, what are they going to
do to other people with disabilities?''
</P>
<P>
   The main benefit to education, Perrone said, is self-esteem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more that people can believe in doing, the more they want
to learn,'' he said. ``They gain the confidence they didn't have
before, and they have a new respect for themselves because of the
technology they learn.''
</P>
<P>
   The courses are free. They are open to anyone with a disability
and a yearly income of less than $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Students attend classes for 16 weeks. As a graduation perk, each
student receives a computer, as long as there is one to give. In
return, they are asked to commit to 50 hours of community service
at any non-profit agency.
</P>
<P>
   Perrone relies on donated computers and donated time. His
non-profit organization has an all-disabled, all-volunteer staff of
26. He repairs the computers, upgrading them so they run popular
operating systems like Windows 95 or Office 97. Perrone does
repairs and upgrades, replaces hard drives and adds memory. For
kids in the Saturday classes, he loads Windows 3.1, games and
educational programs.
</P>
<P>
   Until last summer, he ran the center using his Social Security
check. Now it is day-to-day. He receives office space in exchange
for maintaining the building's computer network.
</P>
<P>
   Perrone said his goal is to give people with disabilities an
employable skill. Last year, 269 adults attended classes at
Perrone's centers. Of those, 22 percent found full-time work, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Mazzotti's foster son, Danny, started attending Saturday classes
last June. His goals were more basic: learning how to type his
first and last name and knowing where each letter is on the
keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the computer might open a door for him, and it
did,'' she said. ``It seemed to me that the door to his mind really
opened. He started trying to talk and he still continues to. I
don't think he knew he could do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Danny comprehends everything you say, but now he is able to
let you know that he does,'' Mazzotti said. ``I really believe that
seeing what he could do, seeing that he could find the letters on
the keyboard _ these are simple things to you and I, but he had
never experienced them before.''

community, tell us about them. E-mail: altantatech(AT)ajc.com

(Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
UNDATED: as possible.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Yahoo, America Online and many other Web sites have gotten the
message, and have imposed a memory size limit on banner
advertisements. Still, ad-blocking advocates argue, not all Web
sites make an effort to keep ad sizes down, and users should be
given a choice whether they want to endure the performance problems
that huge ads create.
</P>
<P>
   ``Users want more control over their experience,'' Ms. Marshall
said. ``If Web sites kept ad sizes down to a reasonable level, that
would be a different thing.''
</P>
<P>
   It might also be a different thing when Internet access speed is
no longer an issue. For people who surf the Web from work, where a
user is more likely to have high-speed access, banner ads have far
less effect on Web performance. But even though cable modems and
other fast links are becoming available to home users, most
households still connect to the network through relatively pokey
dial-up modems connected to telephone lines.
</P>
<P>
   Even if network speed were not a factor, privacy might be.
Besides blocking advertisements, most of these programs also
prevent the installation of ``cookies'' _ downloaded files that
install themselves on the hard drive of Web users' computers and
invisibly collect data about their Web activities, like which sites
they visit and which pages they look at.
</P>
<P>
   Some people employ ad blockers because they prefer to remove the
clutter of advertisements while they're trying to read text or
perform research.
</P>
<P>
   So why aren't even more people using ad-blocking software? For
starters, according to some analysts and Web site operators, many
consumers like to view advertising _ particularly if it is aimed
specifically at them, as ads increasingly are on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   But Catlett of Junkbusters, and many analysts, say that most
people simply do not want to bother with installing the software.
After all, American consumers are exposed to advertisements all day
long and many have learned to tune them out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most effective ad blocker people have is the one right
between their ears,'' said Jim Nail, an analyst with Forrester
Research in Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Nail points out, advertisers might be better off not
spending money to reach people who do not want to see their ads.
``Most people aren't going to bother installing one of the
programs, but if they do, they're not who you want to advertise to
anyway,'' he said. ``They're a waste of money.''

 Fast Chip Lets Laptops Play 3-D Games By Henry Norr  &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  Forget solitaire. Laptop-toting
<TEXT>
travelers soon may be able to while away the airborne hours with
Quake, Unreal and other hot 3-D action games.
<P>
   At least that's what S3 Inc. says its new graphics chips for
mobile computers will make possible. The Santa Clara company claims
that its Savage/MX and Savage/IX 3-D accelerators will deliver
three times the speed and six times the image quality of the chips
now used in notebook PCs.
</P>
<P>
   Overall performance won't match that of the latest graphics
chips for desktop PCs, but it'll be good enough, S3 said, to make
leading games playable on laptops for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   The new chips will go into mass production by the end of this
month, according to the company. Notebook PCs that include them
should show up on retail shelves by September, in plenty of time
for the holiday shopping season. S3 said ``numerous top-tier PC
manufacturers'' are redesigning their notebooks to incorporate the
Savage chips, but officials declined to name specific customers.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Glaskowsky, senior editor of the Microprocessor Report, an
industry newsletter published in Sebastopol, said he's seen actual
games running on prototypes of the mobile Savage chips. ``They
looked fine to me,'' he said. ``Not as good as on a 500-MHz Pentium
III with a Voodoo card (a 3-D accelerator favored by desktop
gamers), but that doesn't matter _ people don't expect that.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently, Glaskowsky said, few notebook models have graphics
chips tailored to 3-D, but ``eventually, they all will.''
</P>
<P>
   The new chips owe their speed, plus the low power consumption
required of notebook chips, in large part to the new,
state-of-the-art production process S3 will use to build them.
Circuits on the chips will be only .18 micron wide, or about one
five-hundredth the width of a human hair.
</P>
<P>
   The mobile Savage chips also will let users connect their
notebooks to standard desktop monitors and use both screens at the
same time.
</P>
<P>
   The new products could boost S3's effort to pull out of a severe
slump, Glaskowsky said.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1989, the company led the market in graphics chips
for PCs through the mid-1990s. But it fell behind competitors such
as ATI Technologies, and in 1998, it reported losses of $113.2
million on a 46-percent drop in sales compared with the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
   In the first quarter of this year, S3 lost another $13.9 million
and sales were down 48.5 percent compared with the same quarter a
year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   But its Savage4 graphics chip for desktop PCs, introduced in
February, has been well received, and first-quarter sales were up
slightly from the last quarter of 1998.

SOFTWARE AD BLOCKERS CHALLENGE WEB INDUSTRY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
 (ATTN: Mass., Wash.)   By LAURIE J. FLYNN   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   An emerging category of Web software that blocks advertising is
challenging the Web industry and rankling the nerves of some
Internet executives.
</P>
<P>
   Known by such names as At Guard, Internet Junkbuster Proxy,
Intermute and Web Washer, these programs work by blocking ads
before they appear on the user's screen. For Web users, ad-blocking
software can mean faster performance, because files that contain
ads laden with graphics and animation take far longer to load than
files with text.
</P>
<P>
   For Web site operators, though, ad blocking is anything but a
benefit. Many executives of Web-based businesses contend that ad
blocking, were it to catch on significantly, could clog their
revenue stream and challenge the fundamental structure of the
emerging Internet industry. Invariably, industry officials draw a
comparison to television: If users want free Web content they, like
network television viewers, will need to put up with the
advertising that pays for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If ad blocking is freely available how will everyone's needs
be met?'' said Scott Mathias, managing editor at ITVWorld.com, a
producer of online programming who said that widespread adoption of
ad blocking would seriously damage his small but growing business.
``The audience already allows overt advertising in mainstream
media, so they must be tolerant in the context of the online model
as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, in the wake of complaints of that sort, the
multimedia software company Real Networks canceled plans to
continue distributing another company's ad blocker, At Guard. Real
Networks' primary customers, which operate Web sites that employ
its software for transmitting audio and video material, complained
that Real Networks had no business promoting a product like At
Guard that could threaten their advertising revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly a lot of money is at stake. Last year, advertisers
spent nearly $2 billion to reach online audiences. Most of that
spending was for so-called banner advertisements _ ads, often
flashing or otherwise animated, that appear at various spots on Web
pages and beckon users to click for further information. By next
year, barring a mass adoption of ad-blocking software, the Internet
research firm Jupiter Communications expects banner ads to
represent $4.4 billion a year in Web advertising revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Ad-blocking programs have been available for several years. But
only recently have significant numbers of people begun using them
as a way to speed up their Web surfing. While market analysts have
yet to begin tracking sales of ad blockers, individual companies
report sales are on the rise lately. Siemens AG, the German
electronics giant that produces Web Washer, estimates that roughly
a million people have begun using the program since it was released
in December. Internet Mute Inc., the Cambridge, Mass., company that
makes Intermute, has seen rising sales in the same period.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers may still be small, compared with the estimated 67
million Web surfers in the United States, but producers of
ad-blocking software predict that more people will adopt their
products, spurred by the increasing freneticism of the advertisers
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Surveys show that the number of people who click on banner ads
has dropped dramatically in the last year, indicating that people
are becoming desensitized to the ads. Nielsen-NetRatings, which
tracks Internet advertising, says the click rate is now about half
the level of 1.35 percent that surveys measured a year ago, meaning
people on average now click on a particular ad fewer than once in
100 viewings.
</P>
<P>
   But advertisers argue that ad banners help them build brand
awareness, even when consumers do not actually click on them. Web
site operators complain that when an ad is blocked it is not
downloaded from the advertising server computer, which means they
do not get paid for ``serving'' an ad to that visitor to the site.
</P>
<P>
   Clamoring for the attention of these increasingly jaded
consumers, advertisers are adding more graphics and sound to their
Web ads _ which, in turn, means that Web surfers end up waiting
longer and longer for the ad-supported pages to appear on their
screens.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a war going on for surfers' attention; it's spoiling
the Web experience,'' said Jason Catlett, founder and president of
Junkbusters Inc. Although his company's main revenue source comes
from consulting fees for helping companies and individuals find
ways to filter out junk e-mail, the company also offers an
ad-blocking program called Internet Junkbuster Proxy. Like many
other providers of ad-blocking software, Junkbusters offers its
program free for downloading from its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Several other new ad-blocking programs have recently appeared on
the market, including Web Washer from Siemens. Ad-blocking utility
programs are increasingly offered as standard fare in software tool
kits sold to individuals to speed up Web performance or enhance
consumer privacy, such as the $30 At Guard program, which also
includes a personal ``firewall'' for preventing intrusions by
hackers and a feature that prevents Web sites from collecting data
about a visitor's activities.
</P>
<P>
   Siemens, after announcing its Web Washer program in January,
immediately received numerous complaints from publisher groups and
online advertisers, said Horst Joepen, an executive with Siemens'
computer systems business development operation in Munich, Germany.
But he said that Siemens was standing firm. The company, which
hopes to become a leader in Internet technology, wants to curb the
surfeit of information on the network and encourage the industry to
develop forms of advertising that are better tailored to the
medium.
</P>
<P>
   Like many ad blockers, the Siemens program is free, distributed
through the company's own site and others.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that this paradigm shift _ in a significant part
initiated by Web Washer _ is widely recognized and irreversible,''
Joepen said. ``The demand for Web Washer indicates clearly that the
current form of online ads is not attractive for the users and does
not make use of the interaction capabilities of the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   To many Web site publishers, though, blocking ads is akin to
trying to get something for free. After all, they say, you would
never expect to get an ad-free version of an ad-supported magazine.
``It's like a shoplifter coming and taking your money away,'' said
Charles Arruda, a vice president of Channelseek, which offers an
online guide to live events on the Web. In fact, Arruda feels so
strongly that ad blocking is a form of thievery that his company
has written software code that prevents anyone using an ad blocker
from even logging onto the company's site.
</P>
<P>
   But advocates of ad blocking say the comparison to television,
magazines and other media is misguided. ``The Web is the only real
medium that can take over your device,'' said Anne Marshall,
product marketing manager at WRQ Inc. in Seattle, which sells At
Guard. Compared with a Web advertisement, which ties up the
computer for as long as it takes the ad to download, ``a TV ad
won't lock up your set when an ad runs,'' Ms. Marshall said.
</P>
<P>
   If a commercial comes on while you are watching television, she
points out, you are free to change channels. In television, Ms.
Marshall said, there are industry standards governing the length
and loudness of commercials. By comparison, the Web is a
free-for-all, and advertisers are taking full advantage of new
technology to make ads as attention-grabbing as possible.

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   &HT;    Search engine enhanced in OS 8.6
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There's nothing revolutionary about OS 8.6, Apple
Computer's latest update to its operating system.
</P>
<P>
   But this release does mark another in a consistent stream of
updates that have improved the stability and speed of most new
Macs.
</P>
<P>
   OS 8.6 also marks the return of stability to Apple Computer in
general. The company has consistently released these smaller
upgrades to its operating system every six months.
</P>
<P>
   Most of 8.6's improvements are invisible, except in terms of
enhanced performance. For example, the upgrade quickens the time it
takes to start up your Mac and copy files over a network.
</P>
<P>
   Apple Computer also says 8.6 improves the battery life of
PowerBooks by up to 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The most visible improvements are to Apple Computer's new search
engine tool, called Sherlock. It replaces the old Find command and
was introduced with upgrade 8.5.
</P>
<P>
   With Sherlock, you can now search through the content of files
and across the Internet. Both of these features are enhanced with
8.6.
</P>
<P>
   Now Sherlock lets you search the Internet with up to 20 search
engines at the same time. The information gathered is then ranked
in order of relevance.
</P>
<P>
   On your hard disk, Sherlock will now search through PDF and HTML
files.
</P>
<P>
   These are the formats used by Acrobat Reader and the Internet
files, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Other improvements in 8.6 include:
</P>
<P>
   _ The ability to keep and launch Internet addresses on your
desktop screen.
</P>
<P>
   _ Improved online help through a Weblike manual you can access
from the menu bar.
</P>
<P>
   _ Improvements in AppleScript, a programming tool that lets
amateur users automate tasks. AppleScript can now control more
functions and works faster.
</P>
<P>
   Apple Computer's latest operating system upgrade is available
online or via a computer CD. You'll find the online version, which
is free, from Apple Computer's Web site. The address is
www.apple.com.
</P>
<P>
   You can also order the computer CD version of 8.6, which
includes more features, from Apple Computer's Web site. The CD
version costs $19.95.

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   &HT;    `You've got mail!' not so bad after all
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ I'll probably lose my membership in the hip Internet
writers club for saying this, but I kind of like America Online.
</P>
<P>
   Now, please don't send me any e-mail documenting your horrific
encounters with AOL's billing department or the Terms of Service
police. Don't write to tell me how long it takes you to dial in,
how many times the system has crashed or logged you off while you
were in the middle of something very important, or how overpriced
it is.
</P>
<P>
   I know. I've been there. Believe me, I've been there.
</P>
<P>
   But AOL is such an easy target for ridicule. Members love
complaining about the seemingly relentless busy signals, the
increasingly annoying ``You've Got Mail'' announcement at the start
of each session and, of course, the never-ending stream of teen-age
boys sending racy instant messages to any screen name that looks
remotely female.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a certain portion of the online population that
feels it is too mature, too sophisticated and far too Web-savvy for
anything as pedestrian and as cutesy as America Online. MindSpring,
AT&AMP;T, Earthlink and a dozen other Internet service providers are
hoping and praying that your disgust with AOL will send you flying
into their waiting arms.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, AOL members encounter a number of problems. With about 17
million members and 20 million users, there are going to be days
when dialing into the service is close to impossible. The instant
message service so beloved by teen-agers and public relations
professionals who use it to message their clients during meetings
and interviews can drive you crazy. So can the endless stream of
junk mail offering everything from 6-cents-a-minute phone service
to discount modems.
</P>
<P>
   But turn off the junk mail _ go to keyword ``Mail Controls'' and
choose what can be sent to you and by whom. Ignore IMs from people
you don't know. Set the parental controls to keep your kids away
from things you don't want them to see. Then start poking around
some of the channels, and you'll find this service is packed with
more information than you might think.
</P>
<P>
   One day, Web historians will look back on AOL as one of the
original online communities. The basic infrastructure of the
service offers members the best way on the Web to post messages and
exchange opinions about the events of the day, whether it's the war
in Kosovo or reaction to the new ``Star Wars'' movie.
</P>
<P>
   Some of AOL's chat rooms have a deservedly bad reputation as
sleazy online singles bars, but the message boards, many of which
are moderated by AOL staffers to keep the discussion on track,
often receive thousands of coherent messages per hour when big news
breaks. At last check, the ``Star Wars'' message board had nearly
20,000 member reviews. AOL executives like to call the service
``America's watercooler,'' and for better or worse, it probably is.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if chatting or even reading notes from random strangers
isn't quite what you want in an online service, it still would be
wrong to dismiss AOL out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   For Web users who don't want to fuss with Yahoo! searches or a
bookmarked list of Web sites longer than the average Christmas card
list, AOL is an amazingly handy place. The personal finance channel
will bring you to nearly every type of money management
information, from stock quotes to initial stock offerings, market
news and a selection of four online brokerage firms.
</P>
<P>
   AOL also offers a special channel called ``Influence,'' which
features, among other things, an AOL-friendly version of the
popular online magazine Salon. For purists, there is a link to the
actual Salon Web site.
</P>
<P>
   (Depending on the version of AOL, you'll have either the
Netscape or Internet Explorer browser. Both seem to work fairly
well and are seamlessly integrated into the service.)
</P>
<P>
   AOL also has some very quirky features such as the New York
Observer, which may have a Web site somewhere, but I know I'm too
lazy to look for it. Here I can read the latest dish on the rich
and famous, including the fact that CBS-TV President Mel Karmazin
just bought a condo in New York's Trump Tower for $11.4 million.
You can also read Maureen Dowd's New York Times column and find
tips on redecorating your drab den or whipping up a tasty dinner
with just three ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   AOL's infrastructure may be riddled with problems big and small,
but the service itself is very good at organizing its own content
and integrating the Web's most popular sites in one place. You will
find what you are looking for here.
</P>
<P>
   Its unlimited service is more expensive than the average ISP,
but you do get a high level of organization and hand-holding in
addition to built-in child safety controls. If you don't mind a few
busy signals and take the time to set the mail controls, AOL will
hand the novice Web surfer the Internet on a virtual silver
platter.

(Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
WASHINGTON: on the merits.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   Among those leading the charge to put the brakes on Icann's
policy making is Network Solutions, which built the international
registry for top level domains like .com, .net and .org under its
exclusive government contract. It also controls the main server,
the so-called root of the Internet, for the global network and
built a $25 million shared registry system that is currently being
tested with five companies. The first of those companies,
Register.com, will begin competing with Network Solutions today.
</P>
<P>
   But Network Solutions is still negotiating with the Commerce
Department on terms for permanently opening up its registry, the
data base of all registered domains, to competitors. The company
has refused to apply to become an official Icann registrar when
full-scale competition is opened. The company says Icann's
licensing terms give the governance body too much regulatory
authority, including the ability to cancel a company's
accreditation _ and thus its business _ at whim.
</P>
<P>
   Network Solutions argues that the interim board should be doing
nothing more than setting minimum technical standards for the
competing registries.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have turned what is supposed to be a standards-setting
body into a regulatory commission,'' said Donald L. Telage, the
company's senior vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Executives from Network Solutions have taken their case to
Capitol Hill, where they were working feverishly last week to
persuade key members to hold oversight hearings on the actions of
both Icann and the Commerce Department.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dyson and Becky Burr, a senior Commerce Department adviser
who is overseeing the formation of Icann, declined to comment on
Network Solutions' complaints, citing their continued talks with
the company.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Network Solutions has a great incentive to protect
the monopoly it has enjoyed since 1995. But the company is not
alone in questioning the interim board's authority for setting
permanent policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real tricky game,'' said Dave Farber, a professor of
computer science at the University of Pennsylvania and a board
member of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the Internet civil
liberties group. ``You may want an interim agreement, but I don't
think that the interim board should put in place anything that is
not revocable.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I believe that the mandate that they were given was
to form a stable organization representative in some way or another
of a community. I don't think they should be making critical
decisions that they don't have to.''
</P>
<P>
   The elected board is not expected to be in place until next
spring, and Ms. Dyson said she expected that the decision on adding
new domains would be delayed until then. She and her board dismiss
much of the criticism as merely a continuation of the contentious
debate that has been part of this process for three years. But many
critics say the board has brought much of the skepticism on itself.
</P>
<P>
   The paucity of details about how the interim board was created
has fostered an Internet conspiracy theory that the board is
carrying out a hidden agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dyson takes strong exception to such theories.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they asked me, they did not ask me to do anything in
particular,'' she said of her being asked to serve on Icann. ``I do
not represent corporate interests; I represent the little guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the mistrust, however, was the board's refusal to hold
open board meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever you do things in a smoke-filled room,'' Farber said,
``even if you are the most honest people in the world, people will
suspect you are not honest.''

independence in the foreseeable future. And it is absolutely
essential, for an orderly end to the war, that all Serb force in
Kosovo be removed.
 &HT;    Although they don't seem to be specifically mentioned in the
agreement, local Serb police and paramilitaries who are themselves
Kosovars must be included. In effect, they would be expelled rather
than withdrawn. But this is necessary if the international force is
to have a reasonable chance of disarming the KLA and encouraging
conversion of the guerrillas into a political movement.
 &HT;    It is precisely the local police who mistreated the ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo for so long and committed some of the worst
atrocities. They are known to their former neighbors and victims.
 &HT;    The pacifist Kosovar leader Ibrahim Rugova speaks now of
reconciliation and protection of those Serbs who remain in the
province. But it is too much to expect that there will be no
attempts at vengeance and retribution if known killers and
torturers remain.
 &HT;    It is doubtless illusory to suppose the allied peace-keepers can
fully disarm the KLA. In the best of circumstances, arms will be
stashed away and hidden, a Balkan tradition. But to achieve civil
peace, it will have to be clear that the ethnic Albanians are fully
protected, and for that the former police must go.
 &HT;    Many Kosovar Serbs are likely to flee to other parts of Serbia
as a result, since they know what happened and the fierce degree of
hatred which will not soon diminish. The eagerness of Moscow, no
doubt at Belgrade's insistence, to have a special sector under
control of Russian troops without any NATO presence is obviously
aimed at enabling these Serbs to remain.
 &HT;    But NATO is right to refuse flatly, since that would assuredly
lead to partition of the province. It is the other side of ethnic
cleansing. The instigators lose their ability to keep their own
homes by the fury they have provoked among their neighbors.
International forces will have to protect Serb monasteries and
monuments until some distant day when there is real,
self-sustaining peace in the region.
 &HT;    Presumably the Russian demand not to have their forces under
NATO can be accommodated by the kind of sleight-of-hand they
accepted in Bosnia, where their contingent is directly under an
American commander, who is himself under NATO orders. They might
prefer a French or British intermediate level, but whatever
solution is found it must be clear that Russians cannot apply
different rules where they are in the field. Otherwise, returning
refugees would not feel secure.
 &HT;    The importance of getting peace-keeping mechanics right from the
start is that this will determine the way Kosovar politics will
develop and the chances for organizing democratic, nonviolent
contests for power under an international administration.
 &HT;    Confidence in security is needed both for relaunching civil life
and for preventing guerrillas or armed bands from organizing their
own rival systems. The worst nightmare would be an Afghanistan-type
conflict of clans, which is not impossible.
 &HT;    Rugova, who was elected in unofficial, more or less clandestine
elections which the Albanian Kosovars conducted some years ago,
boycotting the Serb administration, evidently intends to assert his
claim to leadership now. He is an honest, profoundly decent man who
can be trusted to seek peace, but it isn't clear whether his
failure to achieve any concessions whatsoever from Serbia over a
decade has left him any influence on his compatriots.
 &HT;    In any case, he is no less dedicated to the goal of independence
than the armed rebels, he just never believed in fighting. It is
allied policy to reject that goal, partly because other countries
worry about the precedent of secession among their own minorities,
partly because of fears it would bring possibly violent efforts for
border changes throughout the region.
 &HT;    But ordinary Serbs are aware that an autonomous, internationally
protected Kosovo is not going to be a real part of their territory,
whatever the legal pretense. It is as well to push the issue off
into a future where hopefully such things can be handled with calm
political negotiation. The dream solution would be a new,
democratic Yugoslav or even Balkan confederation, European
Union-style.
 &HT;    That is a very long way off, but as Jean Monnet understood for
western Europe in the aftermath of World War II, it is the real way
to assure peace.

 &HT;    PARIS _ The Serbs are right that their future sovereignty over
Kosovo will be put in doubt by the force withdrawal NATO has
demanded, even though reference in the Rambouillet text providing
for a referendum after three years has been eliminated.

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   &HT;    Most computer glitches are hiccups, not heart attacks
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Few of the people I hang out with in what passes for
my personal life are technologists. And since I do this stuff for a
living, most of them have the naive belief that I am a walking
library of hidden computer tips _ things that are too secret and
complex to reveal in my column.
</P>
<P>
   Truth is, I do know some computer secrets, and I truly do
hesitate to reveal them in this column. But that's not because they
are complex. It's because the real secrets of fixing a computer are
so simple, they're disappointing.
</P>
<P>
   But since we know each other pretty well by now, I will invite
you into the hidden world of computer mysteries. These are some of
the methods used by real computer techies when all else fails.
</P>
<P>
   The first secret tip is the most important. It's something I
have learned from my brother the doctor, computer repairmen and
mechanics. If there is a problem, start with the easiest and
least-invasive treatment first. When it comes to computers, many
novices cause enormous problems trying to fix a temporary glitch.
At the first sign of trouble, they are tempted to reformat the
disk, reinstall all their programs and jerk cards out of the
machine with great vigor.
</P>
<P>
   Since so many problems are mere computer hiccups, try simply
restarting the computer if something doesn't work right. In about
70 percent of the cases, the problem will disappear.
</P>
<P>
   But let's say that you've tried that and the problem remains.
Now's the time to think instead of act. Try to recall the last
major change you made to the computer _ whether it was adding new
software or a device. If you've recently made a change, try
removing the new device or software and see if that fixes the
problem. Then, reinstall it.
</P>
<P>
   I'll give you a recent ``for instance'' of that. My uncle's
computer refused to correctly identify the modem. Now, my uncle has
a master's degree in electrical engineering. But you don't need an
EE degree to fix a similar problem. He removed the modem and the
modem driver (just open up Windows' Modem folder in the control
panel and follow the directions for removing the driver). Then he
reinstalled the modem, started the computer again and let Windows
recognize the modem and install the driver.
</P>
<P>
   There are times _ and these are the really frustrating glitches
_ when neither of the first two tips will help. That's when you
need to take the next step. It really isn't a very big one.
Reinstall Windows. But don't remove the old copy. Instead, simply
pop the installation CD in the drive and reinstall. (Make sure you
have the Windows Upgrade disc, not one of the discs included with
some computers that restore the computer to its
right-out-of-the-box configuration _ if you do that, you'll lose a
lot of programs and data.) But, if you use the Microsoft Upgrade
disc, everything _ including the icons on your screen _ will stay
just as they were. (A prudent computer user will have a backup copy
of data on a Zip drive or some other backup device, just in case).
</P>
<P>
   What if that doesn't work?
</P>
<P>
   Now we are getting into the really ugly fixes. These involve
working with the System Registry or even reformatting the hard disk
and reinstalling Windows and all your programs. If you know how to
do these things, then you'll know why I warn novice users not to
try this without more knowledge than I can give them in this
column. So if all that sounds mysterious and intimidating to you,
then good _ you're right to feel intimidated.
</P>
<P>
   So if you are a beginner, your final fix is also a simple one.
Take the computer to a repair shop and get help. I promise that,
whatever the cost of the repair, it will be less expensive than
trying to do it yourself.

 CRITICS SEE INTERNET BOARD OVERSTEPPING ITS AUTHORITY  (ART ADV: A
photo and graphic are being sent. Non-subscribers can make
individual purchase by calling 888-603-1036 or 888-346-9867.)  By JERI CLAUSING   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ They were mysteriously appointed, they meet behind
closed doors and they have questionable public accountability. Yet
members of the interim board of the Internet's new oversight body
are beginning to make decisions and shape policy that could
ultimately affect everyone who uses the global network.
</P>
<P>
   To finance the $5.9 million annual budget of the oversight body,
the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, or Icann,
this temporary board has voted to levy a $1 a year tax on the more
than four million Internet addresses, or domain names, that end in
.com, .net and .org. The board is also planning to impose tens of
thousands of dollars in licensing and other fees on companies that
want to get into the business of dispensing Internet addresses.
Recently, the board endorsed controversial recommendations for
establishing a new global framework for resolving disputes over who
can and cannot use certain words in their Internet addresses.
</P>
<P>
   Esther Dyson, the chairwoman of the interim board, which was set
up last year, says the group is carrying out its
government-mandated charge to break up the current monopoly in
Internet name registration and to move Internet governance to the
private sector.
</P>
<P>
   But critics say the board is overstepping its authority and
ignoring another mandate _ to create a transparent, bottoms-up
organization. Instead, they say, the board is working behind the
scenes with powerful international corporate and government
interests to create a top-down hierarchy that flies in the face of
the free-wheeling, consensus-based spirit that built the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Such sentiments are but the latest chapter in yearslong sniping
fueled by international jealousies and myriad conspiracy theories.
What is different now, some observers say, is that the Internet,
which is built on a cooperative technology for routing data around
the globe is in less stable hands _ increasing the risk that angry
factions will in effect secede from the network, damaging its
integrity by splitting it into several smaller, disconnected
networks.
</P>
<P>
   Although such a split is considered unlikely, anxiety over who
is running the show could curb investments in the rapidly growing
electronic commerce industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The risks are that Icann has a little bit of authority but
very little legitimacy,'' said Bill Whyman, an Internet analyst for
the Legg Mason investment company in Washington. ``This is an
awkward consensus-building process. If it pushes too far and causes
itself to lose support among key constituencies, Icann itself can
be undercut. Then you have a very bad situation with no one in
control. Then you have a very bad situation for e-commerce.''
</P>
<P>
   Icann was created last year by one of the Internet's founding
fathers, Jon Postel, as the Clinton administration moved to
complete the privatization of the Internet. The U.S. government,
which financed the creation of the Internet over several decades,
had begun privatizing the network in 1995 by turning over
responsibility for domain name registration _ that is, the
assigning of Internet addresses _ to a Virginia-based company,
Network Solutions Inc.
</P>
<P>
   But as Network Solutions' lucrative government-sanctioned
monopoly became increasingly controversial, the administration made
it a top priority to introduce competition into the registration
business _ while also transferring oversight of the Internet to a
private international body. While a Commerce Department report last
June mapped out the principles and goals for such a body, however,
there were very few specifics spelled out.
</P>
<P>
   Icann was set up as a nonprofit organization by Postel, a
computer scientist at the University of Southern California who for
years administered the address numbering system behind Internet
domain names. But he died unexpectedly shortly after the interim
board was named last fall, turning unanswered questions about how
he selected the members into something of an Internet mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever its origins, the interim board now has nine members _
plus the corporation's temporary president, Michael Rogers. In
addition to Ms. Dyson, a well-known Internet analyst, publisher and
entrepreneur, the board includes telecommunications executives and
academics from the United States, Europe, Asia, Australia and Latin
America.
</P>
<P>
   Though the interim board had been expected to set up the
procedures for building up a broad-based Icann membership that
might elect a full-time board, the interim group has itself become
a policy-making body.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics say Icann pushed too far last month in Berlin, when
it endorsed in principle recommendations of a report from the World
Intellectual Property Organization for cracking down on
cybersquatters, the speculators who register and then try to resell
popular domain names, and for resolving disputes over who has the
right to trademarks registered as Internet addresses.
</P>
<P>
   The board referred the report to Icann's domain name committee,
which is to recommend ways to meet the goals. But to many, the deck
seems stacked in favor of big corporations and trademark holders
since a key part of that committee _ members representing
noncommercial name holders _ has not yet been appointed by the
board. Icann has yet to appoint the at-large members who will elect
half of the permanent board.
</P>
<P>
   Until a board is elected, Icann is largely responsible only to
the Commerce Department, which endorsed its creation and is pushing
for quick establishment of dispute-resolution mechanisms so that
Icann can set up full-scale competition in the registration
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of pressure to introduce competition,'' said A.
Michael Froomkin, a University of Miami law professor who was on
the panel of experts that advised the World Intellectual Property
Organization, an arm of the United Nations, in its drafting of the
report.
</P>
<P>
   In response to that pressure, Froomkin says, voicing a common
criticism, Icann is ``going fast on the decision making instead of
going faster on doing the setting up'' of an elected board.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dyson, however, says Icann is caught between special
interest groups: noisy critics crying for the board to slow down
and quieter interests with a large stake in the process, who are
insisting that the board move faster, particularly to resolve
disputes over domain names and trademarks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating to hear `Let's go slow; let's go fast,''' she
said. ``I just want to hear legitimate criticism of what we may or
may not do. Let's argue it on the merits.''

LAWYERS GIRD FOR A DATE WITH DESTINY _ JAN. 1, 2000 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ALAN WECHSLER   c.1999 Albany Times Union   ALBANY, N.Y. _ It
was the opening day of Produce Palace, a gourmet grocery store in a
Detroit suburb. But business was over not long after it started.
<TEXT>
<P>
   A few hours into the day, a customer produced a credit card with
an expiration date of 00, as in the year 2000. The store's
computerized register couldn't comprehend this oddity and crashed.
Customers lined up 20 deep, and then finally stormed out.
</P>
<P>
   That was in 1995, and store owner Mike Yarsike had just become
one of the first victims of a Y2K problem. Soon after, he also
became one of the first people to file a Y2K lawsuit _ in this case
against the maker of his registers. In 1998, he agreed to a
$260,000 settlement from manufacturer TEC America Inc. of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   It is estimated the cost of getting the nation's computers and
electronic equipment ready to accept the year 2000 will be in the
tens of billions of dollars. That may pale next to the cost of Y2K
lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people are predicting this is going to be as big as the
tobacco industry (lawsuits),'' said Jonathan Summers, a lawyer for
Thuillez, Ford, Gold &AMP; Johnson in Albany.
</P>
<P>
   Summers attended a Y2K seminar in New Orleans last year, and
since then has been keeping an eye on Y2K legal issues. While he
hasn't filed any lawsuits, he has talked to a number of clients
about protecting themselves from possible lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real avalanche of litigation isn't going to occur until
after Jan. 1, assuming there are breakdowns,'' he said. ``We're all
kind of sitting back, waiting to see what's going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   As Dec. 31 approaches, many businesses that could be affected by
the Y2K computer bug are readying themselves on two fronts:
ensuring the machinery will work, and ensuring the business won't
be sued if it doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   Computer experts fear that many computers originally programmed
to recognize only the last two digits of a year will fail or
malfunction on Jan. 1, 2000, when the machines might assume it is
1900.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, if there's losses, there's going to be litigation,''
Summers said. ``If there's a pocket out there somebody can point
to, there's going to be litigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Around the country, lawsuits have already started. In the past
few years, IBM, AT&AMP;T and Lucent Technologies have all been sued for
selling programs or equipment with Y2K problems. A California
lawsuit claims some stores, including Circuit City and CompUSA,
failed to warn consumers about Year 2000 problems in equipment,
like VCRs or computers, purchased at those stores.
</P>
<P>
   Most insurance companies, meanwhile, have announced they will
not cover Y2K lawsuits. Businesses, insurers say, should have seen
it coming and should have done something about it.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance companies are sending letters out to their customers,
said Joe Distell, an agent with Reidman Insurance of West Sand
Lake, N.Y. He specializes in commercial insurance.
</P>
<P>
   And that, he said, could lead to further lawsuits _ clients
suing their insurers, claiming the companies have no right to say
they won't cover Y2K problems.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, legislation is being proposed across the United
States in an effort to protect against an onslaught of Y2K-related
lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   On the federal end, the bills include attempts to limit awards,
a requirement giving companies an opportunity to fix Y2K problems
before being sued and protection for retailers that sell faulty
products made by other companies.
</P>
<P>
   More than 30 states are working on Y2K bills. At least 11 have
enacted some. Most are geared to protecting companies.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers are generally opposed to legislation that protects
companies. Walter Effross, a professor at the Washington College of
Law at American University in Washington, D.C., said such laws are
just a cop-out for companies that knew about Y2K problems for years
but ignored them until too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is clearly not the case of manufacturers all of a sudden
waking up to the fact that there's something wrong,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Effross, who recently testified before a House of
Representatives Y2K subcommittee, said companies can take simple
measures to protect themselves: stock up on inventory if they're
worried about suppliers, contact equipment manufacturers to see if
key machinery is Y2K compliant and, if the company manufactures
software, either make sure the program works or get upgrades to
customers as fast as possible.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   John Polster, a lawyer with DeLorenzo, Pasquariello and Weiskoph
in Schenectady, N.Y., said there were many reasons why a company
could be sued for a Y2K problem.

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   &HT;    Recordable media is a real disc-o inferno
 &HT;    By Alexis Larsen
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Few innovations have had as much impact in the
field of personal technology as the introduction of the compact
disc in the 1980s. From its humble beginnings, the CD has managed
to establish a dedicated following willing to abandon their beloved
vinyl records for dependable digital discs.
</P>
<P>
   CD-ROMs transformed our computers from a dull, word-based medium
to an animated multimedia experience of sounds and pictures, and
now the digital video disc (DVD), which is like a video CD, is on
its way to revolutionizing home theater.
</P>
<P>
   But the CD has not stopped there. In the quest to enrich our
computer experience with audio and video _ coupled with the need
for more storage space, computers have evolved into a kind of
refuge for new compact disc recording technologies because of their
immense storage capacities. Although neither the CD or DVD format
began with computers, their recordable versions, the newest
revolution in CD media, have quickly gained popularity with
computer enthusiasts and are now on the cusp of becoming mainstream
technologies.
</P>
<P>
   These recordable technologies will allow ordinary users to
create permanent or semi-permanent archives of audio files and in
some cases data and video files.
</P>
<P>
   Many believe the only thing that can slow the compact disc's
whirring success is the incredibly rapid growth of the technology
and the ever-expanding number of formats and acronyms each
development brings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technology is advancing at a very rapid rate, but until we
decide what route we're going to use, compatibility problems will
be standard problems,'' cautioned Joe Miller owner of FJM Audio.
</P>
<P>
   As for what recordable technology to invest in, there is an
alphabet soup of possibilities but only four widely accepted
formats that show some promise: minidisc; CD audio recorders; two
flavors of CD-format optical discs _ CD-recordable and
CD-rewritable _ and, in the very distant future, DVD-R.
</P>
<P>
   Each presents different benefits and disadvantages, with the
only real similarity being the laser beam each unit uses to
``burn'' or change the surface structure of the blank disc.
</P>
<P>
   So read on and discover the best way to navigate through the
fragmented market and bring yourself into the digital recording
age.
</P>
<P>
   Minidisc (MD)
</P>
<P>
   Sony and Sharp are hoping recent sales surges in Europe and
Japan can be duplicated in the United States with both companies
spearheading an effort to revive the minidisc format. The MD works
by recording digital music onto tiny discs inside a 2.75-inch
cartridge that resembles a 3.5-inch floppy. The companies have
fashioned sleek players as small as 3 inches wide and a scant 4
ounces in weight.
</P>
<P>
   Although there is relatively little prerecorded music available
in the MD format, it's being touted for its ability to make
recordings from any analog or digital music source, including CD
players, tape decks, even the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   With blank discs selling for a little more than $3 apiece and
units ranging from $300 to $500 in component and portable versions,
minidisc recorders are less costly than CD recorders, but far
pricier than the portable CD players they aim to displace.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest obstacle facing the minidisc is that although it has
become popular abroad, CDs weren't as entrenched there as they are
here and U.S. consumers are not as quick to jump to a new platform.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got people saying, `I'm not replacing my CDs, I just
replaced my albums.' The minidisc is like the Rodney Dangerfield of
the music business: It gets no respect at all,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   _ Verdict: Overall, minidisc is best suited for dubbing
commercial recordings for personal use at home, in portables and
for making casual live recordings. It is least suited to high
quality recording.
</P>
<P>
   CD audio recorders
</P>
<P>
   Manufactured to look and function like any other stereo
component, the CD home-audio recorder could become the most
significant product available to audiophiles since the release of
the first compact disc.
</P>
<P>
   Pioneer and Phillips have released the first wave of CD home
recorders compatible with any stereo system that has digital
outjacks. The recorder, priced about $600, enables the user to copy
audio from CD players, cassette decks, turntables, radio and even
TV (for cable or satellite music channels) quickly and
conveniently. However, the drives are currently only single speed
and the blank discs are expensive at $6 or more each, thanks to a
royalty agreement with the recording industry, which also requires
that a special ``copyright flag'' be embedded on blank discs and
that CD recorders accept only these flagged discs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Verdict: Factors such as the artificially high price of blank
media (virtually identical to the recordable CDs for computers,
which sell for little more than $1 or $2 each because the copyright
agreement doesn't affect them) and other copyright issues, such as
an installed antipiracy system called the Serial Copy Management
System (SCMS) that prevents the user from making a copy of a
digitally recorded copy, may prevent this from being a contender in
home recording.
</P>
<P>
   CD-Recordable (CD-R)
</P>
<P>
   As recently as a few years ago, it would have been inconceivable
for most people to possess the technology necessary to replicate
CDs in-house. These days it seems many professional studios,
software developers and others have the capability to churn out
CDs. Markets that aren't even associated with optical storage such
as hospitals and banks can be found investing in this popular
technology, according to Dave Ulich, president of Information
Systems Inc.
</P>
<P>
   With many computers being ordered in custom configurations with
CD-R/RW drives installed, this format seems poised to become a
mainstream data-storage technology. With low-priced drives and
media, combined with user-friendly software, there has been
increased public demand for these drives.
</P>
<P>
   Nate Seim, production director at Wright State University's
radio station and a student engineer at the Wright State Television
Center, can't remember life without his CD-R. ``Having a CD burner
is the greatest thing in the world. You've got a friend that has a
really good CD ... you just pop it in and get an exact duplicate.
You want a certain PlayStation game ... it's yours. And with the
blank media being as inexpensive as it is, it's a win-win
situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bought my CD-R drive about a year ago so they were still
very expensive and I hoped that I had made a good investment. Today
I can honestly say it is by far the best thing I've ever bought for
my computer.''
</P>
<P>
   CD-R drives cost as little as $300. Just as important, the cost
of blank media has fallen to a dollar or two per disc, depending on
how many you buy at one time.
</P>
<P>
   With a capacity of 650 MB, this makes CD-R easily the cheapest
storage space around, archiving files for a fraction of a penny per
megabyte. And the process of creating your own CD-ROM disc has
become far easier thanks to improved CD recording software.
</P>
<P>
   CD-R and its relative CD-RW are good ways to create permanent or
semi-permanent archives of any type of file _ data, audio or video.
Until recently, removable storage options like Iomega Zip were the
preferred method of storage, but with CD-R and CD-RW technologies
descending from their former stratospheric price levels, they have
become cost-effective for users.
</P>
<P>
   Miller sees CD-R in his future. As owner of FJM Audio, he keeps
himself aware of emerging technologies and understands why CD-R has
gained such immense popularity. ``CD-R media is incredibly
convenient, durable, cost-effective and reliable. I prefer to use
CD media whenever possible.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Verdict: The unique thing about CD-R is its compatibility with
CD media, making it cheap and interchangeable. Fully optical
technology like CDs promise much better longevity than magnetic
media like tape and disks for storing very large memory-intensive
files. The drawbacks are that they are not sold in portable units,
and because the discs are not reusable, they are not
environmentally friendly. Also, the computer involvement makes this
method more complicated than the others.
</P>
<P>
   CD-Rewritable (CD-RW)
</P>
<P>
   CD-RW discs employ a ``phase change'' technology through which
the discs can be used thousands of times for recording. The chief
problem is that most CD players are not sensitive enough to detect
the differences in reflectivity on the disc, with only CD-ROM and
DVD-ROM players able to interface with them.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of CD-RW drives is $200 more than its CD-R cousin, and
blank CD-RW discs cost about $12 apiece. CD-RW drives can be used
to write CD-R discs, but CD-R drives cannot write CD-RW discs. For
CD-RW discs to rerecord, the disc must be reformatted, which can
take as long as 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Verdict: Even CD-RW, an erasable, recordable CD format, is not
likely to supplant CD-R because of the cost of the blank media and
the fact that many CD players will not play back CD-RW media.
</P>
<P>
   Recordable Digital Versatile Disc (DVD-R)
</P>
<P>
   Right on the heels of recordable CDs is the DVD recordable
format, which ups the ante from megabytes to gigabytes, holding up
to eight times as much data as CD-R discs. Although the current
cost of DVD recordable drives is far too expensive for most
consumers, it is expected that the price will fall quickly over the
next couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   Just as much of the attraction of CD-R comes from its inherently
compatible nature, so a primary selling feature of DVD-R will be
its ability to be read by any DVD device. However, given some of
the historical compatibility problems among the first CD-R media,
CD audio recorders and CD-ROM drives manufactured, it is reasonable
to speculate the same issues could also affect early generations of
DVD-R products.
</P>
<P>
   _ Verdict: Given DVD-R's write-once nature, similar uses for
CD-R are expected, including data storage, distribution and
archiving. Unfortunately, developing the critical mass that CD-R
has established lies in the far-off future when hardware prices
fall substantially. For the time being DVD-R will impact a select
group of professionals; our turn will come later.
</P>
<P>
   The future
</P>
<P>
   ``Investing in today's technologies instead of waiting for
future generations of digital recorders makes sense when you
consider that they are available now and at affordable prices,''
said Seim.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear what fate is in store for the CD, DVD, CD-R/RW
or minidisc, but there are some factors to look at when purchasing
to help make a more informed decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Start with the application first: What do you want to do with
your hardware? It's the same way you buy a computer. You buy from
the software back to the hardware by figuring out what you want to
do and what features you need to be able to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Also, try and settle on a technology that's going to be around
for a while. Invest wisely so you'll have viable equipment a couple
years from now,'' said Bill Sellers, owner of Encore Studios.
</P>
<P>
   Before you buy
</P>
<P>
   When choosing digital recording equipment, remember:
</P>
<P>
   _ A hardware manufacturer may claim a device can do something
that requires software or media that is not supplied with the
product.
</P>
<P>
   _ CD technology is evolving rapidly. What was true yesterday may
be false today and what is scheduled for tomorrow may never happen.
</P>
<P>
   _ The more you understand about a new technology such as
recordable media, the more likely you are to avoid problems.
</P>
<P>
   _ Some problems may arise from hardware, software or procedures,
but most arise from the interaction of components.
</P>
<P>
   _ CD media are very sensitive to light and heat. A disc can be
destroyed if exposed to either of these for too long.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mobile CD players are more fussy about recorded discs than
home audio players or CD-ROMs.

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
 UNDATED: government agencies. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Physicists and mathematicians already post many of their
findings, prior to publication in a journal, on a Web site operated
by the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico (xxx.lanl.gov).
But doctors say that biomedical research, especially clinical
research, is different because it can influence the care and
treatment of patients.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Frank, executive director of the American Physiological
Society, which publishes more than 35,000 pages a year in its
journals, said a patient could be injured or killed if a doctor
prescribed a certain course of treatment based on unverified
information posted on the proposed E-biomed site.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Richard M. Glass, interim co-editor of The Journal of the
American Medical Association, said articles ``often get changed
very extensively'' as they go through the review process. Because
authors are enthusiastic about their work, he said, they often draw
conclusions that go beyond the data, and they may see new
treatments as being more effective than they really are.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, supporters of E-biomed say it could make
valuable information swiftly available to doctors, patients,
researchers and the taxpayers who pay for much of the research.
</P>
<P>
   Charles V. Mobbs, an associate professor of neurobiology at the
Mount Sinai School of Medicine, in New York City, said, ``The
taxpayer is willing to pay for our research; we have an obligation
to make the results of that research available as quickly and
efficiently as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Mobbs praised Varmus' proposal, saying it could ``revolutionize
the way in which biomedical scientists carry out their work.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said, in the electronic version of their
reports, scientists could include film sequences, three-dimensional
images and large sets of data for which there is no space in
printed journals. This would presumably make it easier for other
scientists to replicate and build on the results.
</P>
<P>
   Varmus said that all reports filed in E-biomed could be searched
with a single computerized ``search engine,'' and readers could
jump electronically, by ``hyperlinks,'' to other articles, data
bases and Web sites. In addition, he said, E-biomed could become
``a communal site'' for worldwide discussion of scientific issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``E-biomed could be the most important change in scientific
communication since the formal journal,'' Dr. David J. Lipman, a
co-author of the proposal for electronic publishing, said in an
interview. Referring to NIH's new $15.6 billion budget, he added,
``We want to get the greatest public benefit in return for that $15
billion investment. We want the most possible eyes to see the
results.''
</P>
<P>
   Lipman is director of the National Center for Biotechnology
Information, a unit of the National Library of Medicine at the NIH.
</P>
<P>
   In outlining the proposal last month, Varmus said, ``The single
greatest attraction of E-biomed is that all of its scientific
content will be available without barriers to any user with
Internet access.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the proposal profess not to be alarmed at the
potential distribution of ``junk science'' over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   One researcher who sent an e-mail comment to the NIH, Dr. Bruce
Swanson of Adelaide, Australia, drew an analogy to the spread of
literacy and printing technology in medieval Europe. ``Were all
books going to be authoritative and accurate?'' he asked. ``Were
some dangerous to society? We can imagine priests saying, `Mass
printing and wide dissemination of books is OK so long as we insure
that every book is approved by a priest review process.'''
</P>
<P>
   Other commenters worry that E-biomed would expand the role and
power of the government. ``I am adamantly opposed to any federal
clearinghouse for scientific information,'' said David H. Farrell,
an associate professor of oral molecular biology at the Oregon
Health Sciences University, in Portland.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence P. Reynolds, a professor of reproductive physiology at
North Dakota State University, in Fargo, said: ``It's intrusive for
the government to play the role it's proposing. More than that,
it's unnecessary. Journals are already beginning to publish reports
in electronic format.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Reynolds acknowledged, in many cases, the full text of
articles is available only to paid subscribers or to consumers who
pay a special fee.
</P>
<P>
   E-biomed, as described by Varmus, would have a ``governing
board'' composed of scientists, editors, computer specialists and
representatives of agencies that finance biomedical research. The
NIH would ``assemble'' the board, which in turn would develop
``rules of operation'' for the E-biomed site, Varmus said.
</P>
<P>
   Frank, of the American Physiological Society, said he worried
that the choice of board members might be influenced by politics,
and that appointments might have to be cleared through the
department of Health and Human Services.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters and critics of E-biomed agree that something like it
is probably inevitable. ``Scientific communication is going to go
electronic,'' said Anthony J. Mazzaschi of the Association of
American Medical Colleges. ``It's just a question of when and
how.''

WHO SHOULD PUBLISH RESEARCH RESULTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
 (ATTN: Mass., Wis., N.M., N.Y., Ore., N.D.)   (af)  
 By ROBERT PEAR c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The director of the National Institutes of Health
has touched off a passionate debate by proposing that scientists
disclose and disseminate on the Internet the results of biomedical
research, so the full text of their reports would be available at
no cost to anyone with a computer anywhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The director, Dr. Harold E. Varmus, said his proposal for an
electronic publishing operation, called E-biomed, would speed the
progress of science by accelerating the exchange of information
among researchers and by vastly increasing access to it.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he said, the proposed new Web site could be ``a
democratizing force'' because any legitimate researchers, ``however
remotely located or poorly known,'' could enter reports on it.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials say they hope to coordinate their Web site
with the established scientific journals, some of which have begun
electronic publishing in a limited way. But the publishers of
scholarly journals, including many scientific societies, are
predictably cool to the idea.
</P>
<P>
   They say the new system would permit researchers to bypass paper
journals and circumvent the process of peer review, by which
scientists evaluate new work before it is published, and they fear
that the NIH will become a rival that could put them out of the
publishing business or slash the revenues they derive from their
journals.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jerome P. Kassirer, editor in chief of The New England
Journal of Medicine, which has 240,000 paid subscribers, said,
``E-biomed could have a disastrous effect on clinical journals.''
He worries that ``subscribers would have no reason for
subscribing'' if they could get the contents of journals free on
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The New England Journal is owned and published by the
Massachusetts Medical Society. It has for years had a strict policy
against publishing manuscripts whose ``essential substance'' has
been published elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The American Society for Microbiology, which publishes 10
scholarly journals, and the American Physiological Society, which
has 14, express similar concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Today's scientific journals trace their ancestry to The
Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, in England, and
the Journal des Scavants, in France. Both began publishing in 1665,
with a commitment to test scientific ideas by the experimental
method.
</P>
<P>
   In the 300 years since the gold standard of scientific
communication has the publication of a paper that has been reviewed
by expert colleagues, in a scientific journal.
</P>
<P>
   Varmus proposed two compartments or divisions for the new Web
site. Articles published in the first compartment would be subject
to scientific review by members of the editorial boards of various
journals. This is the process of peer review used for decades by
The New England Journal of Medicine, The Journal of the American
Medical Association, Science, Nature, Cell, Lancet and dozens of
other journals.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, or as an alternative, Varmus said, reports could be
posted immediately on the Internet, ``prior to any conventional
peer review.''
</P>
<P>
   For their work to be disseminated in this way, Varmus said,
researchers would need to get approval from ``two individuals with
appropriate credentials.'' Such credentials, he said, ``should be
broad enough to include several thousands of scientists, but
stringent enough to provide protection of the data base from
extraneous or outrageous material.''
</P>
<P>
   Varmus described this compartment of E-biomed as a ``general
repository.'' And he said ``virtually any legitimate work'' could
be posted there ``without traditional editorial review.''
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists say, however, that E-biomed could confuse or
alarm consumers by disseminating unverified information and ``junk
science'' not reviewed by experts in the field. They acknowledge
that Web users already have access to a huge amount of medical and
scientific information of widely varying quality, but they say it
is different when the government tries to organize a system for
publishing and distributing it.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Michael M. Cox, a biochemist at the University of
Wisconsin in Madison, said, ``The publication of an electronic
journal, supported by the NIH, as described in the Varmus proposal,
is among the very worst ideas I have ever heard.''
</P>
<P>
   If it is not subject to careful peer review, ``it will
inevitably become a massive repository of taxpayer-supported
junk,'' Cox said. ``Since it will be supported or sponsored in some
way by the NIH, it will be perceived as being legitimate.''
</P>
<P>
   But the proposal gets strong support from Rep. John Edward
Porter, R-Ill., who is chairman of the House Appropriations
subcommittee responsible for the budget of the health institutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``NIH is providing wonderful leadership to the scientific
community in encouraging use of the Internet to share
information,'' Porter said.
</P>
<P>
   Subscription prices, especially for highly technical journals
sold by large commercial publishers, have risen sharply in recent
years. Libraries pay $10,000 to $15,000 a year for titles on some
subjects like brain research.
</P>
<P>
   E-biomed, as envisioned by Varmus, would offer ``instantaneous,
cost-free access'' to research reports on biology and medicine,
thus saving money for individual scientists, libraries,
laboratories and government agencies.

 &HT;    By Bill Husted

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The weather is a big deal, no matter how you look at
it.
</P>
<P>
   If you travel a lot for business, you need to know if you should
bring a sweater along on your trip to Seattle. On the weekend, you
want to know if you should try for golf on Saturday or wait until
the rain ends and shoot for Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   There's no shortage of weather information. It's still a popular
feature in newspapers, and radio stations seem to give a weather
report every 15 minutes or so. TV is full of the stuff; there's
even an entire cable channel _ the Weather Channel _ devoted to it.
And, if you hang out on the Web, you probably already know there's
no shortage of sites devoted to the weather.
</P>
<P>
   It would be difficult to write about weather reports on the Web
and not start with one of the main sources of weather information _
even for other weather sites _ the National Weather Service. You'll
be able to find a NWS site based in Peachtree City at
www.srh.noaa.gov
</P>
<P>
   /FTPROOT/FFC/HTML/.
</P>
<P>
   If you are looking for flash and fancy graphics, this isn't for
you. This page, however, is filled with information. You can use
various links to read the latest weather watches and warnings; get
a five-day forecast for the Atlanta area or other parts of the
state; get the short-term forecast; find out current conditions; or
take a look at radar images. All those links were working fine a
few days ago, but the link to software for a meteorological
calculator was not working.
</P>
<P>
   For those of you who want a little more flash and splash in a
site, then cable television's Weather Channel at www.weather.com is
definitely the place for you.
</P>
<P>
   You'll be able to get forecasts, weather maps and even watch
video clips. You can also check forecasts for cities around the
globe. The weakness here _ it is a big one and ironic, too,
considering the source _ is the lack of detailed weather
information. For instance, the entire forecast for Atlanta given
one day last week was ``isolated t-storms, hi 83 degrees, lo 66
degrees.''
</P>
<P>
   If you want to see what I mean, then bop over to the next site,
one run by the Weather Underground at
www.wunderground.com/US/GA/Atlanta.html. You'll find more than a
screenful of data such as humidity, dew point, current wind and
almost anything you'd want to know. Then, on top of all that, you
get a much longer and more detailed forecast. Neither the Weather
Channel approach nor this site's way of doing things is ``right,''
but the two approaches are very different and should help you find
a page that suits your taste in weather information.
</P>
<P>
   Cox Interactive Media (which is owned by Cox Enterprises, the
Atlanta-based company that also owns The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) offers weather information at www
</P>
<P>
   .accessatlanta.com/weather/. The amount of information you'll
find here falls somewhere between the sparse text at the Weather
Channel site and the verbose detail at Weather Underground. But one
really good feature of this site, for those of you who do want
detailed weather information, is the ability to click on a link
that will take you to various National Weather Service sites where
you'll get the complete story.

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   &HT;    Supercomm99 to showcase merger of mediums, ADSL standardBy
Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Convergence of the telephone, other telecommunication
devices and the PC is the hot topic at this year's Supercomm99
going on now through Thursday at the Georgia World Congress Center.
</P>
<P>
   Billing itself as the Number One communications industry event,
Supercomm has more than 700 exhibitors and plenty of flash and
glitz to promote the latest products and services for what is now a
very hot part of the technology industry.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 46,000 attendees walked the floors of last year's
conference, and an equal, if not larger number of industry
professionals, analysts and entrepreneurs are expected to attend
this year. High on this year's agenda is the deployment of
high-speed Digital Subscriber Line telephone access to the
Internet, fiber optics and ``last-mile'' access from the
telecommunications provider to the consumer.
</P>
<P>
   The Supercomm exhibitors and panels are focused on products and
technologies that can speed the process of bringing ``always on''
Internet access to home Net users. Most major telecommunications
companies including BellSouth, BellAtlantic, SBC and others are
beginning to deploy high-speed Internet service, but getting that
service to every telephone customer has been rough going for a
variety of technical reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Also topping the agenda is the adoption next month of the
Universal ADSL standard, a type of modem jointly developed by
telecommunications and computer companies that facilitates the
installation and use of high speed Internet access service.
</P>
<P>
   One lesson the conference learned from last year is that a
number of analysts, brokers, venture capitalists and others come
trying to find ``the next big thing'' in telecommunications. To
accommodate this audience segment, Supercomm will offer financial
presentations by communications companies.
</P>
<P>
   Along with traditional telecommunications companies, there is
also an increasing number of start-up companies looking to find a
niche in a rapidly expanding sector. Highlighting the diversity of
this year's Supercomm is this year's keynote address from Microsoft
president Steve Ballmer, who is expected to discuss how the
software giant plans to establish its presence in the broadband
arena.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If you can't make it to that afternoon baseball game
and can't watch on television, the Web may be the next best thing.
</P>
<P>
   Sites like CBS SportsLine let you follow major league games
pitch by pitch, inning by inning, complete with little baserunner
icons that tell you who's actually on first. So if it's OK with
your boss, you can watch at work.
</P>
<P>
   The June issue of Yahoo! Internet Life takes a look at baseball
Web-casts. The article looks at four sites _ www
</P>
<P>
   .sportsline.com, www
</P>
<P>
   .totalbaseball.com, www
</P>
<P>
   .espn.com and sites on America Online that can be accessed by
the keywords ``AL scores'' and ``NL scores.''
</P>
<P>
   Total Baseball Online's site comes with an illustrated strike
zone and play-by-play text description. Big games _ like the
All-Star Game or World Series _ come with photos. A separate chart
notes each grounder, line drive, pop-up and foul ball.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN's site displays its Web broadcast with scores and updates
on note cards. When a hitter comes to the plate, his photo is shown
along with statistics, including batting average and RBI total.
</P>
<P>
   The CBS SportsLine site is ``the most graphically intensive Web
broadcast,'' according to the article. It sets up a virtual stadium
on your screen, complete with organ music and hot dog vendors. The
screen image also has a box that updates scores from other games.
</P>
<P>
   The AOL sites are the simplest. Each features a basic
scoreboard, updated by pitch by pitch. A chat room and forum
combination called the ``grandstand'' gives fans a chance to gripe
or root with like-minded brethren.
</P>
<P>
   The June issue of Yahoo! Internet Life also takes a look at Web
sites devoted to the summer's movies and movie review sites.
</P>
<P>
   A more interesting piece is the one exploring sites focused on
movie rumors, including: www.aint-it-cool-news.com;
www.corona.bc.ca/films; www.darkhorizons.com; www.cinescape.com;
and www.countingdown.com.
</P>
<P>
   Rich's, Macy's join wedding Web site
</P>
<P>
   WeddingChannel.com has added to its wedding-planning resources
on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   The site, at www
</P>
<P>
   .weddingchannel.com, has affiliated with Federated Department
stores and is creating an integrated in-store and online bridal
registry. Federated Department Stores chains include Macy's,
Bloomingdale's, Burdines, Rich's and Stern's.
</P>
<P>
   The site's features include a guest management tool that lets
you create a database of guests and vendors as well as track
invitations, RSVPs, gifts and thank-you notes.
</P>
<P>
   Couples can also create a customizable home page that can be
updated for wedding plans and logistics and that can be accessed by
guests via password.
</P>
<P>
   Another site for online auto buying
</P>
<P>
   Another car-buying Web site has joined the fray. Now, www
</P>
<P>
   .carsdirect.com joins Autobytel.com, carpoint.msn.com and
several others hoping to make the Internet the reference resource
for people buying cars.
</P>
<P>
   Sherman Oaks, Calif.-based Carsdirect.com was launched in May.
The site offers car prices and options on more than 2,500 makes and
models.
</P>
<P>
   It also lets you get a loan and buy the car, all online. You can
arrange for delivery at a dealer, at your office or at home.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between Carsdirect.com and other auto-buying Web
sites is that the others refer a customer to a dealer to buy their
car. Carsdirect.com lets you buy the car online.
</P>
<P>
   Carsdirect.com has arrangements with dealers in 10 markets _
Atlanta, Chicago, Denver, Dallas, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, San
Francisco, Seattle and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Plans call for that to expand to 40 by year's end.

KIDS AND TEENS TAKE TO INTERNET SHOPPING
</HEADLINE>
 
(Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY BEN SULLIVAN  c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News   LOS ANGELES _ As
if parents don't have enough to worry about when it comes to the
Internet, a new study reported Monday that online marketers are
increasingly targeting youths as a back door to mom and dad's
pocketbook.
<TEXT>
<P>
   According to the study by the Internet research firm Jupiter
Communications, teens and children ages 5 to 12 are the
fastest-growing segment of online users. And by 2002, Jupiter
projects, they'll be spending more than $1.3 billion per year in
online transactions, 10 times current levels.
</P>
<P>
   To get their hands on all that extra cash, marketers of
everything from toys to video games to clothing are going after
young people at sites youngsters visit most. And youths, in turn,
are coming to adults for money to buy all the goodies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of grabbing parents' coat sleeves, today's digital
kids ask ... for credit card numbers in place of an allowance and
buy products online,'' said Anya Sacharow, an analyst with
Jupiter's Consumer Content Strategies division.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, parents are uneasy with the phenomenon.
Jupiter's study found 45 percent of parents surveyed said they were
concerned about online advertising aimed at young people, compared
to just 17 percent a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Butterworth, a Los Angeles psychologist who specializes
in teens and culture, said the Jupiter results should come as no
surprise to anyone who has watched the blossoming of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pressure is on,'' Butterworth said. ``E-commerce has
trickled down to kids, and they're being pushed to spend money
online.''
</P>
<P>
   What makes youths especially attractive to marketers is their
comfort with the Internet, Butterworth said. ``To all these kids
it's second nature. The fact that you're putting your credit card
number out there doesn't bother them at all,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Jupiter study found that 67 percent of online teens and 37
percent of online kids have researched or bought goods online,
proving that today's youths ``see the Internet as a preferred tool
for information gathering,'' Sacharow said. ``Commerce is a natural
progression.''
</P>
<P>
   But youths and online shopping do not mix, as witnessed last
month when a New Jersey eighth-grader bid nearly $3 million on
Internet auction site eBay.com for items ranging from a Van Gogh
painting to a 1955 red Ford convertible.
</P>
<P>
   While extreme, the case shows the disconnect that can exist
between young people and money, industry observers say.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way it's like magic money for them,'' said Andrew De
Vries, director of marketing for Wired Digital, and producer of
Webmonkey for Kids, a youth-oriented Internet site. ``Because they
can't see (the money) or feel it, everything seems less expensive
to them.''
</P>
<P>
   In its report, Jupiter recommends online marketers show care in
how they go after youths and their discretionary dollars. Sacharow
said e-commerce sites should create transactional experiences that
teach fiscal responsibility, the value of money and how to evaluate
products.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, she said, ``Online players ... risk alienating
parents, creating a negative brand image and fostering greedy
customers.''

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   &HT;    Make birthday castles with printing software
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If you are one of those folks who take delight in
making things like greeting cards, signs, banners, bookmarks, menus
and the like, let me introduce you to Corel Print House Magic
Premium.
</P>
<P>
   All six discs of it.
</P>
<P>
   This area of computing has obviously become very popular. There
was a time when Broderbund's Print Shop was about the only game in
town for you folks. Now everybody's got one, but I've never seen
the like of Print House Magic Premium.
</P>
<P>
   It is, I would assume, the PageMaker of small-scale design. In
fact, it is just about as complex as PageMaker.
</P>
<P>
   The package consists of Corel Print House 4, Photo House 3 and a
bunch of plug-ins, and a database for keeping track of events like
birthdays, anniversaries and so forth. The discs are stuffed with
80,000 graphic images, both clip art and photos, more than 300
fonts and, in case you can't think of anything to say on Auntie
Pood's birthday card, more than a thousand phrases.
</P>
<P>
   I was hoping for a nice collection of Middle Eastern curses,
like ``May a trolley car grow in your stomach,'' but nearly all of
them are sweet and sober or rather silly.
</P>
<P>
   Print House lets you manipulate text and images in just about
every way possible. Of course, great power has its price _
complexity. For instance, you can position objects on a page just
by dragging them around, and you can expand or shrink them by
dragging their corner markers. But you can also size and position
them precisely by typing in the measurements.
</P>
<P>
   Toolbars abound. They're all over the place. Fortunately, the
icons are fairly intuitive.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the product of Print House is child-oriented. You can
make party sets _ hats, masks, placemats, bags and so forth _ in a
couple of dozen themes. For instance, let's say your kid wants to
have a party and he decides on a castle theme. The program will
help you make a castle banner, a castle door hanger, a bunch of
castle games, four kinds of crowns (with or without diamonds and
dragons), a dragon mask, a horse and trumpet banner, a king mask, a
knight mask, a princess mask, placemats for everyone but the
scullery maid, and several other odd items.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Print House Magic is likely to be rough going for
kids young enough to want this sort of thing. Even with all the
helper wizards, it's complex.
</P>
<P>
   The most frustrating thing is deciding upon, and then finding,
the art you want to use.
</P>
<P>
   The program comes with an inch-thick book, about 400 pages, less
than 100 of which are the manual. The rest is a catalog of all the
stuff on the disks.
</P>
<P>
   It ranges from the dumbest kind of cartoon clip art to a nice
selection of old master paintings. You want animals? It's got silly
animals, cartoon animals, Audubon-style animals and photographic
animals. Tigers? A couple of dozen photographs, plus all the clip
art.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, I can't find any way to tell which disk contains
which images. This means a lot of popping CD-ROMs in and out of the
drive, aggravating enough for us old folks, torture for a kid.
</P>
<P>
   On the upside, however, Corel Print House Magic Premium sells
for $50 or less, which is only about $12 per word in the title, and
less than $10 a disk.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to complain at that price.

   ST. PETER'S, Montserrat _ To hear Nancy Burke tell it, this
island's string of natural disasters began with the flash floods of
1981. Those were followed by the earthquake in 1985, followed by
Hurricane Hugo in 1989, followed by the eruption of the Soufriere
Hills volcano in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly this tiny island has had more than its share of bad
luck, so much so that some Montserratians believe God is trying to
tell them something.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even an erupting volcano hasn't been able to persuade Burke
and her husband, Richard Hermany(CQ), to permanently abandon their
comfortable villa here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing left is fire or locusts,'' reasoned Burke, 57.
``But we love it here. We couldn't afford to live like this back in
the states.''
</P>
<P>
   Burke is a chatty, one-time belly dancer from Manhattan. Her
husband earned a living on Broadway, performing in shows such as
``Hello Dolly!'' with Ginger Rogers.
</P>
<P>
   The pair bought their spacious abode, which includes a 42-foot
swimming pool -- as well as a guest house and another swimming pool
-- in 1992 for less than $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``People here trust one another completely,'' Burke said. ``You
never even have to lock your doors.''
</P>
<P>
   The only thing lacking? ``A good dentist,'' claimed Hermany, 71.
</P>
<P>
   Before the volcano, this island was an upscale tourist
destination that supported 12,000 people. It also was a popular
spot for American retirees. Whereas other islands have had cricket;
Montserrat has had golf.
</P>
<P>
   Then the volcano unexpectedly sprang to life, killing at least
19 people, forcing two-thirds of the population into exile, and
rendering most of Montserrat unfit for human habitation.
</P>
<P>
   Still, what's often been called the Emerald Isle, in part
because of its lushness, has remained a powerful magnet for
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps hundreds of expatriates either spend winters here, or
live here year-round, mostly in a northern ``safe zone'' that
encompasses about a third of this 39-square-mile British territory.
</P>
<P>
   An American couple, Robert and Beverly Kleeb from Howell, Mich.,
are the only people to openly defy a government order to leave the
so-called ``danger zone'' near the volcano.
</P>
<P>
   They say all their money's tied up in their $800,000 villa,
perched high atop a cliff above the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   They refuse to abandon their property, powered by a generator,
even though the volcano is still active, spewing hot gases into the
air.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to see the island's appeal, however.
</P>
<P>
   Too small and friendly to be intimidating, roads snake passed
shingled cottages that bear cutesy names such as ``Chez Mango,''
and are shaded by breadfruit trees and smothered in mostly pink and
yellow bougainvillea.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone seems to know and care about everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Drivers greet passers-by again and again with a wave and a quick
``toot-toot'' of their horns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans have always liked Montserrat because it's like
living in a small town,'' said Pam Arthurton, owner of Carib-World
Travel, who grew up in Montserrat. ``There is no crime, or drugs,
but there are plenty of good fruits and vegetables.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Mitchell was a vice president for Georgia-Pacific Corp.
before buying a house here with his wife, Marcia, in January 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started coming here in 1989 and every time we would stay
longer and longer,'' he said. ``We have coffee in the morning and
look out over the ocean and it's spectacular.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mitchells' home has a long veranda overlooking crystal-clear
sea, which they say is perfect for snorkeling. A waterfall just
outside their bedroom window lulls them to sleep each night.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Some Americans say they were drawn to Montserrat by pure
economics: a population explosion on many of the Caribbean's larger
islands had made it increasingly difficult to find unspoiled,
reasonably priced property in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason Montserrat's so popular: labor is cheap, with
maids costing $3 to $4 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   This island was first colonized in the mid-1600s by Irish
Catholics who came over from the neighboring, but mostly Protestant
island of St. Kitts. Even now, St. Patrick's Day is a national
holiday, and passports here are stamped with a bright, green
shamrock.
</P>
<P>
   Volcanic in origin, this pear-shaped island has hot mineral
springs. Americans insist the water here's so clean and tasty that
it should be bottled and sold in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   One of these Americans is David Lea, from Warren, Ohio, who
moved his family here in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   He and his wife, Clover, and their three sons, live in a
treehouse-like dwelling that looks like something straight out of
``The Swiss Family Robinson.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no shortage of hammocks or fresh flowers, a look David
Lea describes as ``well-done hippie.''
</P>
<P>
   There's even a hot tub on the deck with sweeping views of the
sea, and a hydroponics garden, where vegetables grow in
nutrient-rich solution, rather than soil.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure the kids still play with their Game Boy, but they also
swing on ropes,'' David Lea said. ``Our children use their
imaginations, just like I did when I was growing up.''

   CORK HILL, Montserrat _ Nearly four years after it awakened,
Montserrat's volcano is still an unpredictable one. It spews ash
and clouds of hot gases in violent burps and coughs, even as it's
supposed to be going back to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   In the volcano's shadow is a once-verdant landscape turned gray
and dreary under a thick blanket of fine, gritty ash.
</P>
<P>
   Against this backdrop, the tenacious people of this tiny British
territory are rebuilding their lives with an optimism that belies
the seriousness of living with a natural disaster year after year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are looking up,'' said Valerie Romeo of Romeo's Wayside
Hardware.
</P>
<P>
   She said business has been booming even though she's been forced
to relocate her store twice in recent years, each time farther away
from the erupting volcano.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, this pear-shaped Caribbean island -- part of the
Leeward chain -- was dubbed the Emerald Isle. The reference was, in
part, a nod to the tropical lushness that for years attracted
upscale tourists.
</P>
<P>
   But all that changed in July 1995 when Montserrat's
long-smoldering volcano, Soufriere Hills(CQ), blew its stack after
nearly four centuries of dormancy. It eventually killed 19 people,
obliterated the economy and wiped out Plymouth, the capital, and
other villages.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, there have been periods of repose between eruptions,
prompting many people to return to check on property near the
volcano. A proposition that can have dire consequences as a group
of more than a dozen islanders found out in 1997. They returned to
the so-called ``danger zone'' and were killed when the volcano
erupted without warning, sending ``pyroclastic flows'' -- waves of
900-degree ash, gas and rocks -- down the mountainside at speeds of
100 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the southern two-thirds of the island still aren't fit
for human habitation.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves Montserrat with a Herculean task: re-creating its
society in only the northern third of the island.
</P>
<P>
   Montserratians say they're confident they can jump-start both
their lives and their businesses -- particularly tourism --
shattered by the mountain's threat.
</P>
<P>
   Already, a few restaurants have opened. Various other
long-vacant businesses have been reborn. And banks have started to
make loans again so that people might build new houses and
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are under the impression that there's no one or nothing
left on this island, but we're here and we're going forward,'' said
Ernestine Cassell, Montserrat's director of tourism.
</P>
<P>
   She said that, only two years ago, everyone thought tourism here
was dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I say tourism's not dead because now the island has a
major attraction everyone wants to see, an active volcano,'' she
reasoned.
</P>
<P>
   Although Montserrat's airport has been buried by ash, the island
can be reached via ferry or helicopter from Antigua, 27 miles to
the northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists today believe the volcano is finally settling down
for good. But as it does, eruptions are ongoing, and Soufriere
Hills continues to shoot dark, perilous-looking clouds thousands of
feet into the air.
</P>
<P>
   On May 22, Montserrat experienced at least 150 earthquakes,
albeit minor ones that residents and tourists couldn't detect.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the volcano has spit out a lava that is so thick, it
doesn't flow away easily but accumulates to form a dome -- which is
collapsing, causing ongoing volcanic activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We keep seeing activity as the volcano goes back to sleep, but
the volcano, overall, is definitely quieting down,'' said Jill
Norton, an English volcanologist at the Montserrat Volcano
Observatory.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, only the northern third of the island -- blocked from
the volcano by huge hills -- is said to be safe.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the island's remaining 4,500 or so residents have
been crammed into an arid, 10-square-mile region, marked by steep
land and corkscrew roads.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the volcano, the 12,000 residents of this island,
only 11 miles long and 7 miles wide, had little room to maneuver.
</P>
<P>
   After the volcano erupted, two-thirds of the island's population
were evacuated to Great Britain or to other Caribbean islands.
</P>
<P>
   The volcano was a double-whammy for Montserratians still reeling
from the wrath of Hurricane Hugo, which ripped across the island in
1989 with winds of up to 150 mph, uprooting 400-year-old trees and
damaging or destroying 95 percent of all structures.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, this will be the second near-total reconstruction of
this island in less than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the reconstruction after Hurricane Hugo was nearly
complete when the eruption took place.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   In the capital Plymouth, which had been this island's nerve
center and most-important city, the atmosphere is one of a ghost
town, where up to 10 feet of ash and rock have buried what was to
be the island's new library, hospital, and governmental buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Ash also has buried Air Studios, where a vast array of stars --
including Jimmy Buffett, Eric Clapton, Elton John, Paul McCartney,
Stevie Wonder, and the Rolling Stones -- recorded music throughout
the 1980s away from the glare of the media spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   Montserratian officials operating out of trailers say they hope
to build new government offices in Little Bay, a patch of
mountainside located in the island's northern end. A laundry list
of other hoped-for projects includes a new airport and sporting
complex.
</P>
<P>
   But a lack of funds has, so far, been a stumbling block.
</P>
<P>
   British financial aid has totaled more than $100 million since
1995, but much of the assistance has been spent on ``emergency
needs,'' such as flying in tents and various equipment and setting
up the Montserrat Volcano Observatory.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, it may be months before residents are allowed
to move back into the ``danger zone,'' or the southern part of the
island, mostly because of the health risk posed by the dust.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who ventures into this region is subject to fines, even
arrest since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   To make sure no one does so, the area is dotted with big,
menacing signs that read: ``The following hazards are likely to
occur without warning -- pyroclastic flows, mud flows, and ash
falls.''
</P>
<P>
   There's also a small, central buffer zone, which is open only
during daylight hours.
</P>
<P>
   Montserrat Gov. Tony Abbott, a British official, says the island
can build a bright future, but admits it won't be easy.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a top priority is drawing back Montserratians --
like the 3,500 evacuated to Britain -- many of whom had been the
island's richest and youngest residents. But about 900 people who
remain on the island still need homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This island has not only suffered from physical devastation,
but from social devastation as well,'' Abbott said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each village used to look after their own, but now many of
these villages are damaged or destroyed, so there's a need to
establish places for people like the elderly and the mentally
challenged who have nowhere to go,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   He said the British government already has financed the
construction of 250 homes in the ``safe zone,'' and now plans to
implement a low-interest mortgage program.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Even before the volcano erupted, however, tourism was the
backbone of this island's economy. Businesses such as lime, sugar,
and cotton never stuck around for long.
</P>
<P>
   Today, with Plymouth evacuated, and many areas off-limits, it's
hard to entice tourists to come.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. State Department still recommends that U.S. citizens
defer all travel to Montserrat, due to the active volcano. The
warning was even mentioned by popular talk-show hostess Oprah
Winfrey on her May 18 program, further exasperating Montserratians.
</P>
<P>
   Montserrat has always been something of a Caribbean anomaly,
escaping mass-market tourism thanks to its lack of beaches,
casinos, resorts. Even in its heyday, Montserrat never boasted more
than 150 hotel rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Still, tourism boosters point out that before the volcano,
Montserrat attracted 30,000 visitors a year. Last year, it had
declined to about 7,000.
</P>
<P>
   Cassell, the tourism director, hopes to change all that. She
sees the volcano as the island's ticket out of the economic
doldrums.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nearly 4 million people visit Hawaii each year just to see the
volcano, so our volcano can be an attraction as well,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But there are currently no hotel accommodations here, although
tourists can pay to stay in people's homes. A new 18-room hotel,
called Tropical Mansions, is set to open by November, while the Vue
Pointe, the island's biggest hotel before the eruption with 44
rooms, is scheduled to re-open by December.
</P>
<P>
   In April, the 110-passenger Caledonian Star became the first
cruise ship to visit the island since the volcano erupted. Its
passengers were able to get an up-close look at the volcano, as
well as see firsthand the devastation it left.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to fight for funds from the British government
so we can make improvements to our port so that more cruise ships
can come,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Pam Arthurton, who owns Carib-World Travel in Antigua, with
another office in Baltimore, said she too has started marketing the
volcano.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to develop adventure tours that include visits to
the volcano because it's my belief that one person's disaster can
be another person's attraction,'' she said.

   BAGHDAD, Iraq _ Like most Iraqis, Hamed Khalaf has nothing but
bad choices.
</P>
<P>
   As his country's economy collapses, the 32-year-old unemployed
taxi driver struggles to support his mother and two war-disabled
brothers. First, they sold the house, then the taxi, then the
furniture and the carpets.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, he was in Baghdad's outdoor book market. The dour
Khalaf sold off his brothers' collection of Arabic culture picture
journals for about 40 cents.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the last of what I have,'' he says. ``Next, I'll
sell my clothes. I mean it.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently, diplomats at the United Nations Security Council are
trying to make their own difficult choices about the sanctions on
Khalaf's Iraq. Proposals range from maintaining the severe status
quo to lifting the sanctions entirely.
</P>
<P>
   When they were imposed after Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
invaded Kuwait in 1990, few thought the sanctions would be needed
more than a year. More than eight years later, life for the 22
million Iraqis in the land of Babylon has taken on truly Old
Testament elements, from pestilence to hunger.
</P>
<P>
   Children die daily for lack of common medicines and from the
``epidemic'' spread, according to the UN, of treatable maladies
like diarrhea and malaria. Much of the drinking water is unclean.
Tuberculosis is about five times more prevalent than before 1990
and 70 percent of Iraqi women are anemic.
</P>
<P>
   In increasing numbers, children drop out of school to become
beggars or street sellers. In school, they sit on classroom floors
and recycle last year's workbooks.
</P>
<P>
   This spring, U.N. reports issued dire warnings about conditions
in Iraq. In fittingly cruel irony, the warnings came as the world
is distracted trying to contain Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic -- another dictator seemingly unharmed by the sanctions
on his country. Iraqi suffering will grind on a while longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is on hold at this point,'' says former
undersecretary of state for the Middle East Richard W. Murphy, who
himself is unsure about what can be done. ``It is a deep
stalemate.''
</P>
<P>
   The sanctions are unprecedented. Notes Richard Garfield, a
sanctions expert and epidemiologist at Columbia University, such
sanctions were nearly impossible during the Cold War. A country
like Cuba could be shut out by one side but get help from the
other. Iraq is isolated by all.
</P>
<P>
   ``No country has experienced such comprehensive sanctions in
this century,'' Garfield says. ``It is a new weapon.''
</P>
<P>
   In a study released in March, Garfield concluded that mortality
rates for children under five years of age are double what they
were before the sanctions. It means that an extra 110,000 to
225,000 Iraqi children have died since the sanctions began.
</P>
<P>
   While Iraq is not as poor as many African or Latin American
nations, it has fallen far. Just 10 years ago, the oil-rich land
had a medical system that was the most respected in the Arab world
and living conditions that compared well with the region.
</P>
<P>
   As years go by, the sanctions get harder to justify, especially
in light of their limited results.
</P>
<P>
   The plan after the war was for weapons inspectors to destroy
Hussein's chemical, biological and nuclear weapons programs of mass
destruction. Hussein was to comply with other obligations, such as
paying reparations to Kuwait, and the sanctions would be lifted.
</P>
<P>
   But the program has lurched from crisis to crisis. Hussein has
not cooperated with the weapons inspectors and, amid repeated U.S.
air strikes, now refuses to let them back in the country.
</P>
<P>
   True, the sanctions have kept Hussein from rebuilding what was
once the fourth largest army in the world. He is not a threat to
his neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   However, even some Middle East experts who support the sanctions
concede that they have strengthened Hussein's hold on Iraq by
consolidating the country's little wealth in his regime. A
stalemate, indeed.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, with concern building about the privation facing
Iraqis, the U.N. approved the so-called oil-for-food program. It
began in late 1996, and now allows Iraq to sell up to $10.4 billion
in oil annually. One-third goes to repaying Kuwait, the rest is for
food, medicine, clean water and electricity. The money is held and
tracked by the U.N.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. says that health and nutrition have stopped
deteriorating, but they are not getting better. About a quarter of
Iraqi children are still malnourished.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials point to the oil-for-food program to show they
mean no harm to ordinary Iraqis. But, Iraq's hobbling oil industry
cannot produce anywhere near the $10.4 billion cap and the U.N. has
concluded that even that would not be enough.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Hussein's own cruel negligence hurts his case for
lifting the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Through oil smuggling, some of which is tolerated by the United
States because the precious commodity goes to allies like Jordan
and Turkey, Hussein can raise an estimated $500 million a year that
is not monitored by the U.N.
</P>
<P>
   He spends it on palaces -- building about a dozen since the
sanctions started. Last month, he opened a new vacation village,
with an amusement park, stadiums and a bronze statue of himself. He
is beginning to build what he says will be the largest mosque in
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein's police have brand new Hyundai patrol cars and the
streets signs brandish new, well-lit portraits of the president.
</P>
<P>
   Worse still, though the U.N. monitors the oil money, Iraq
dispenses the goods. It has not done so well.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. recently reported that Iraq has distributed only 48
percent of the $570 million in medical supplies bought over the
last two years. Warehouses, the U.N. noted, are ``literally
overflowing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason is that they don't want their people to stop
dying,'' says Amatzia Baram, an Israeli expert on Iraq at
Georgetown University. He says Hussein contributes to his people's
misery to build world sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   But just because a dictator does not care about his people does
not mean the world should turn its back.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. concluded in April that, even with the government's
failings, ``the Iraqi people would not be undergoing such
depravations in the absence of the prolonged measures imposed by
the security council and the effects of war . . . the country has
experienced a shift from relative affluence to massive poverty.''
</P>
<P>
   True, lifting the sanctions would give Hussein access to the
kind of money he needs to rebuild his army, which some estimate
would take $10 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In March, U.S. Undersecretary of State Thomas Pickering told a
Senate committee that U.S. policy seeks to get Hussein removed from
office, but in the meantime will rely on the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ``U.N. sanctions of Iraq are critical to our efforts to contain
Hussein. The sanctions deprive Hussein of the revenue he would
otherwise use to reconstitute weapons of mass destruction. That is
why Hussein has set the lifting of sanctions among his highest
priorities,'' Pickering said.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Baram says that Hussein was spending 80 percent of his
money on arms before the Kuwait invasion, so lifting the sanctions
may not improve the lives much for regular Iraqis.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the sanctions counter that Iraq took care of its
humanitarian needs before the sanctions. They say that if U.S.
officials want to stop Hussein from re-arming, they could lead an
arms embargo or continue the frequent air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   There is a middle option. British diplomats are pushing a
proposal that would require Hussein into cooperate for several
months with weapons inspections, then remove the cap on oil sales.
The money would still be controlled by the U.N., but foreign
companies would be encouraged to rebuild the Iraqi oil industry.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say the plan is logical, but has two important drawbacks
-- neither the Americans nor the Iraqis have accepted it.
</P>
<P>
   American officials have supported the concept of removing the
cap, but worry that this plan -- highly complex with possible
loopholes -- could give Hussein too much money or reward him for
not complying with weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
   It could take months to sort out, in part because of the world's
pre-occupation with Milosevic and Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy, now a senior fellow at the New York-based Council on
Foreign Relations, a foreign policy think tank, says U.S. officials
seem in no hurry to deal with Iraq, satisfied that Hussein is
crippled.
</P>
<P>
   He says that is not enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a moral dimension,'' he says. ``A society has been
eviscerated.''

island in the mid-1600s after leaving their uneasy base on the
Protestant island of St. Kitts.
</P>
<P>
   Volcano's history: The Soufriere Hills Volcano erupted in July
1995 after nearly four centuries of dormancy. By 1997 it had killed
at least 19 people, forced two-thirds of the population into exile,
and rendered most of the island unsafe for human habitation. The
volcano is still active, though it is becoming dormant.

   ST. PETER'S, Montserrat _ To hear Nancy Burke tell it, this
island's string of natural disasters began with the flash floods of
1981. Those were followed by the earthquake in 1985, followed by
Hurricane Hugo in 1989, followed by the eruption of the Soufriere
Hills volcano in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly this tiny island has had more than its share of bad
luck, so much so that some Montserratians believe God is trying to
tell them something.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even an erupting volcano hasn't been able to persuade Burke
and her husband, Richard Hermany(CQ), to permanently abandon their
comfortable villa here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing left is fire or locusts,'' reasoned Burke, 57.
``But we love it here. We couldn't afford to live like this back in
the states.''
</P>
<P>
   Burke is a chatty, one-time belly dancer from Manhattan. Her
husband earned a living on Broadway, performing in shows such as
``Hello Dolly!'' with Ginger Rogers.
</P>
<P>
   The pair bought their spacious abode, which includes a 42-foot
swimming pool -- as well as a guest house and another swimming pool
-- in 1992 for less than $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``People here trust one another completely,'' Burke said. ``You
never even have to lock your doors.''
</P>
<P>
   The only thing lacking? ``A good dentist,'' claimed Hermany, 71.
</P>
<P>
   Before the volcano, this island was an upscale tourist
destination that supported 12,000 people. It also was a popular
spot for American retirees. Whereas other islands have had cricket;
Montserrat has had golf.
</P>
<P>
   Then the volcano unexpectedly sprang to life, killing at least
19 people, forcing two-thirds of the population into exile, and
rendering most of Montserrat unfit for human habitation.
</P>
<P>
   Still, what's often been called the Emerald Isle, in part
because of its lushness, has remained a powerful magnet for
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps hundreds of expatriates either spend winters here, or
live here year-round, mostly in a northern ``safe zone'' that
encompasses about a third of this 39-square-mile British territory.
</P>
<P>
   An American couple, Robert and Beverly Kleeb from Howell, Mich.,
are the only people to openly defy a government order to leave the
so-called ``danger zone'' near the volcano.
</P>
<P>
   They say all their money's tied up in their $800,000 villa,
perched high atop a cliff above the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   They refuse to abandon their property, powered by a generator,
even though the volcano is still active, spewing hot gases into the
air.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to see the island's appeal, however.
</P>
<P>
   Too small and friendly to be intimidating, roads snake passed
shingled cottages that bear cutesy names such as ``Chez Mango,''
and are shaded by breadfruit trees and smothered in mostly pink and
yellow bougainvillea.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone seems to know and care about everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Drivers greet passers-by again and again with a wave and a quick
``toot-toot'' of their horns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans have always liked Montserrat because it's like
living in a small town,'' said Pam Arthurton, owner of Carib-World
Travel, who grew up in Montserrat. ``There is no crime, or drugs,
but there are plenty of good fruits and vegetables.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Mitchell was a vice president for Georgia-Pacific Corp.
before buying a house here with his wife, Marcia, in January 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started coming here in 1989 and every time we would stay
longer and longer,'' he said. ``We have coffee in the morning and
look out over the ocean and it's spectacular.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mitchells' home has a long veranda overlooking crystal-clear
sea, which they say is perfect for snorkeling. A waterfall just
outside their bedroom window lulls them to sleep each night.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Some Americans say they were drawn to Montserrat by pure
economics: a population explosion on many of the Caribbean's larger
islands had made it increasingly difficult to find unspoiled,
reasonably priced property in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason Montserrat's so popular: labor is cheap, with
maids costing $3 to $4 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   This island was first colonized in the mid-1600s by Irish
Catholics who came over from the neighboring, but mostly Protestant
island of St. Kitts. Even now, St. Patrick's Day is a national
holiday, and passports here are stamped with a bright, green
shamrock.
</P>
<P>
   Volcanic in origin, this pear-shaped island has hot mineral
springs. Americans insist the water here's so clean and tasty that
it should be bottled and sold in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   One of these Americans is David Lea, from Warren, Ohio, who
moved his family here in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   He and his wife, Clover, and their three sons, live in a
treehouse-like dwelling that looks like something straight out of
``The Swiss Family Robinson.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no shortage of hammocks or fresh flowers, a look David
Lea describes as ``well-done hippie.''
</P>
<P>
   There's even a hot tub on the deck with sweeping views of the
sea, and a hydroponics garden, where vegetables grow in
nutrient-rich solution, rather than soil.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure the kids still play with their Game Boy, but they also
swing on ropes,'' David Lea said. ``Our children use their
imaginations, just like I did when I was growing up.''

   CORK HILL, Montserrat _ Nearly four years after it awakened,
Montserrat's volcano is still an unpredictable one. It spews ash
and clouds of hot gases in violent burps and coughs, even as it's
supposed to be going back to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   In the volcano's shadow is a once-verdant landscape turned gray
and dreary under a thick blanket of fine, gritty ash.
</P>
<P>
   Against this backdrop, the tenacious people of this tiny British
territory are rebuilding their lives with an optimism that belies
the seriousness of living with a natural disaster year after year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are looking up,'' said Valerie Romeo of Romeo's Wayside
Hardware.
</P>
<P>
   She said business has been booming even though she's been forced
to relocate her store twice in recent years, each time farther away
from the erupting volcano.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, this pear-shaped Caribbean island -- part of the
Leeward chain -- was dubbed the Emerald Isle. The reference was, in
part, a nod to the tropical lushness that for years attracted
upscale tourists.
</P>
<P>
   But all that changed in July 1995 when Montserrat's
long-smoldering volcano, Soufriere Hills(CQ), blew its stack after
nearly four centuries of dormancy. It eventually killed 19 people,
obliterated the economy and wiped out Plymouth, the capital, and
other villages.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, there have been periods of repose between eruptions,
prompting many people to return to check on property near the
volcano. A proposition that can have dire consequences as a group
of more than a dozen islanders found out in 1997. They returned to
the so-called ``danger zone'' and were killed when the volcano
erupted without warning, sending ``pyroclastic flows'' -- waves of
900-degree ash, gas and rocks -- down the mountainside at speeds of
100 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the southern two-thirds of the island still aren't fit
for human habitation.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves Montserrat with a Herculean task: re-creating its
society in only the northern third of the island.
</P>
<P>
   Montserratians say they're confident they can jump-start both
their lives and their businesses -- particularly tourism --
shattered by the mountain's threat.
</P>
<P>
   Already, a few restaurants have opened. Various other
long-vacant businesses have been reborn. And banks have started to
make loans again so that people might build new houses and
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are under the impression that there's no one or nothing
left on this island, but we're here and we're going forward,'' said
Ernestine Cassell, Montserrat's director of tourism.
</P>
<P>
   She said that, only two years ago, everyone thought tourism here
was dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I say tourism's not dead because now the island has a
major attraction everyone wants to see, an active volcano,'' she
reasoned.
</P>
<P>
   Although Montserrat's airport has been buried by ash, the island
can be reached via ferry or helicopter from Antigua, 27 miles to
the northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists today believe the volcano is finally settling down
for good. But as it does, eruptions are ongoing, and Soufriere
Hills continues to shoot dark, perilous-looking clouds thousands of
feet into the air.
</P>
<P>
   On May 22, Montserrat experienced at least 150 earthquakes,
albeit minor ones that residents and tourists couldn't detect.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the volcano has spit out a lava that is so thick, it
doesn't flow away easily but accumulates to form a dome -- which is
collapsing, causing ongoing volcanic activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We keep seeing activity as the volcano goes back to sleep, but
the volcano, overall, is definitely quieting down,'' said Jill
Norton, an English volcanologist at the Montserrat Volcano
Observatory.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, only the northern third of the island -- blocked from
the volcano by huge hills -- is said to be safe.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the island's remaining 4,500 or so residents have
been crammed into an arid, 10-square-mile region, marked by steep
land and corkscrew roads.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the volcano, the 12,000 residents of this island,
only 11 miles long and 7 miles wide, had little room to maneuver.
</P>
<P>
   After the volcano erupted, two-thirds of the island's population
were evacuated to Great Britain or to other Caribbean islands.
</P>
<P>
   The volcano was a double-whammy for Montserratians still reeling
from the wrath of Hurricane Hugo, which ripped across the island in
1989 with winds of up to 150 mph, uprooting 400-year-old trees and
damaging or destroying 95 percent of all structures.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, this will be the second near-total reconstruction of
this island in less than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the reconstruction after Hurricane Hugo was nearly
complete when the eruption took place.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   In the capital Plymouth, which had been this island's nerve
center and most-important city, the atmosphere is one of a ghost
town, where up to 10 feet of ash and rock have buried what was to
be the island's new library, hospital, and governmental buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Ash also has buried Air Studios, where a vast array of stars --
including Jimmy Buffett, Eric Clapton, Elton John, Paul McCartney,
Stevie Wonder, and the Rolling Stones -- recorded music throughout
the 1980s away from the glare of the media spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   Montserratian officials operating out of trailers say they hope
to build new government offices in Little Bay, a patch of
mountainside located in the island's northern end. A laundry list
of other hoped-for projects includes a new airport and sporting
complex.
</P>
<P>
   But a lack of funds has, so far, been a stumbling block.
</P>
<P>
   British financial aid has totaled more than $100 million since
1995, but much of the assistance has been spent on ``emergency
needs,'' such as flying in tents and various equipment and setting
up the Montserrat Volcano Observatory.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, it may be months before residents are allowed
to move back into the ``danger zone,'' or the southern part of the
island, mostly because of the health risk posed by the dust.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who ventures into this region is subject to fines, even
arrest since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   To make sure no one does so, the area is dotted with big,
menacing signs that read: ``The following hazards are likely to
occur without warning -- pyroclastic flows, mud flows, and ash
falls.''
</P>
<P>
   There's also a small, central buffer zone, which is open only
during daylight hours.
</P>
<P>
   Montserrat Gov. Tony Abbott, a British official, says the island
can build a bright future, but admits it won't be easy.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a top priority is drawing back Montserratians --
like the 3,500 evacuated to Britain -- many of whom had been the
island's richest and youngest residents. But about 900 people who
remain on the island still need homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This island has not only suffered from physical devastation,
but from social devastation as well,'' Abbott said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each village used to look after their own, but now many of
these villages are damaged or destroyed, so there's a need to
establish places for people like the elderly and the mentally
challenged who have nowhere to go,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   He said the British government already has financed the
construction of 250 homes in the ``safe zone,'' and now plans to
implement a low-interest mortgage program.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Even before the volcano erupted, however, tourism was the
backbone of this island's economy. Businesses such as lime, sugar,
and cotton never stuck around for long.
</P>
<P>
   Today, with Plymouth evacuated, and many areas off-limits, it's
hard to entice tourists to come.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. State Department still recommends that U.S. citizens
defer all travel to Montserrat, due to the active volcano. The
warning was even mentioned by popular talk-show hostess Oprah
Winfrey on her May 18 program, further exasperating Montserratians.
</P>
<P>
   Montserrat has always been something of a Caribbean anomaly,
escaping mass-market tourism thanks to its lack of beaches,
casinos, resorts. Even in its heyday, Montserrat never boasted more
than 150 hotel rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Still, tourism boosters point out that before the volcano,
Montserrat attracted 30,000 visitors a year. Last year, it had
declined to about 7,000.
</P>
<P>
   Cassell, the tourism director, hopes to change all that. She
sees the volcano as the island's ticket out of the economic
doldrums.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nearly 4 million people visit Hawaii each year just to see the
volcano, so our volcano can be an attraction as well,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But there are currently no hotel accommodations here, although
tourists can pay to stay in people's homes. A new 18-room hotel,
called Tropical Mansions, is set to open by November, while the Vue
Pointe, the island's biggest hotel before the eruption with 44
rooms, is scheduled to re-open by December.
</P>
<P>
   In April, the 110-passenger Caledonian Star became the first
cruise ship to visit the island since the volcano erupted. Its
passengers were able to get an up-close look at the volcano, as
well as see firsthand the devastation it left.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to fight for funds from the British government
so we can make improvements to our port so that more cruise ships
can come,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Pam Arthurton, who owns Carib-World Travel in Antigua, with
another office in Baltimore, said she too has started marketing the
volcano.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to develop adventure tours that include visits to
the volcano because it's my belief that one person's disaster can
be another person's attraction,'' she said.

   BAGHDAD, Iraq _ With their sneakers, cartoon-clad backpacks and
pony tails, these girls would fit in at any American school.
</P>
<P>
   But, when visitors enter classes at the Hidayeh (Enlightenment)
Elementary School in Baghdad, the students rise together with
smiles and shout, ``Welcome and long live the leader, Saddam
Hussein!''
</P>
<P>
   There's something else different about schools in Iraq. This
one, with about 1,200 girls, has one telephone and no copying
machine. Lights are often out in the school, and many students sit
on the floors for lack of even a broken-down desk.
</P>
<P>
   Each year, the girls start their studies by erasing the
penciled-in work in last year's workbooks so they can be re-used.
</P>
<P>
   Serious Samar Khatab, a 13-year-old fifth-grader, sums up the
problem saying, ``It is because of the sanctions. The enemy
countries want to take everything from us because we were rich.''
</P>
<P>
   Eight years after Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait and the world
slapped economic sanctions on Iraq, aid officials are worried about
the degradation of a generation of students like Samar.
</P>
<P>
   Sanctions supporters will note that there is money squandered in
Iraq. Despite the sanctions, Saddam has opened palaces worth tens
of millions of dollars. Near this school, a couple of bulldozers
scrape at the site of the Saddam Hussein Mosque, planned to be the
biggest in the world.
</P>
<P>
   But aid groups say even the money for those projects would not
reverse the overall degradation of this country of 22 million
people. Especially for its children.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was one of the most progressive countries in the Middle
East. Today it is in a state of disrepair and dilapidation that is
having a formative effect on the youth,'' Hans von(CQ) Sponeck, the
United Nations Humanitarian Coordinator in Iraq, said in a recent
interview with Cox Newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   It is leading, he said, ``to a generation deprived of
knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   In America, children are getting hooked into global learning
through computers and the Internet. When a visitor asked children
at Hidayeh Elementary who among them knew what a computer was, only
a few hands were raised.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, these children are lucky to be in school. Enrollment
from first grade through college has dropped from 56 percent in
1990 to 42 percent today. Many children live and beg in the
streets. Other children work.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers are in short supply because salaries have dropped to
around $4 a month.
</P>
<P>
   At Hidayeh, a school in a lower-middle class area of central
Baghdad, many classes have more than 55 children. They often show
the lethargy expected in a country where almost a quarter of the
children are undernourished.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, it will affect their future,'' says deputy school
director Talia Ali Hussein. ``If they are suffering now, how can
they build a society in the future?''

   BAGHDAD, Iraq _ Like most Iraqis, Hamed Khalaf has nothing but
bad choices.
</P>
<P>
   As his country's economy collapses, the 32-year-old unemployed
taxi driver struggles to support his mother and two war-disabled
brothers. First, they sold the house, then the taxi, then the
furniture and the carpets.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, he was in Baghdad's outdoor book market. The dour
Khalaf sold off his brothers' collection of Arabic culture picture
journals for about 40 cents.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the last of what I have,'' he says. ``Next, I'll
sell my clothes. I mean it.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently, diplomats at the United Nations Security Council are
trying to make their own difficult choices about the sanctions on
Khalaf's Iraq. Proposals range from maintaining the severe status
quo to lifting the sanctions entirely.
</P>
<P>
   When they were imposed after Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
invaded Kuwait in 1990, few thought the sanctions would be needed
more than a year. More than eight years later, life for the 22
million Iraqis in the land of Babylon has taken on truly Old
Testament elements, from pestilence to hunger.
</P>
<P>
   Children die daily for lack of common medicines and from the
``epidemic'' spread, according to the UN, of treatable maladies
like diarrhea and malaria. Much of the drinking water is unclean.
Tuberculosis is about five times more prevalent than before 1990
and 70 percent of Iraqi women are anemic.
</P>
<P>
   In increasing numbers, children drop out of school to become
beggars or street sellers. In school, they sit on classroom floors
and recycle last year's workbooks.
</P>
<P>
   This spring, U.N. reports issued dire warnings about conditions
in Iraq. In fittingly cruel irony, the warnings came as the world
is distracted trying to contain Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic -- another dictator seemingly unharmed by the sanctions
on his country. Iraqi suffering will grind on a while longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is on hold at this point,'' says former
undersecretary of state for the Middle East Richard W. Murphy, who
himself is unsure about what can be done. ``It is a deep
stalemate.''
</P>
<P>
   The sanctions are unprecedented. Notes Richard Garfield, a
sanctions expert and epidemiologist at Columbia University, such
sanctions were nearly impossible during the Cold War. A country
like Cuba could be shut out by one side but get help from the
other. Iraq is isolated by all.
</P>
<P>
   ``No country has experienced such comprehensive sanctions in
this century,'' Garfield says. ``It is a new weapon.''
</P>
<P>
   In a study released in March, Garfield concluded that mortality
rates for children under five years of age are double what they
were before the sanctions. It means that an extra 110,000 to
225,000 Iraqi children have died since the sanctions began.
</P>
<P>
   While Iraq is not as poor as many African or Latin American
nations, it has fallen far. Just 10 years ago, the oil-rich land
had a medical system that was the most respected in the Arab world
and living conditions that compared well with the region.
</P>
<P>
   As years go by, the sanctions get harder to justify, especially
in light of their limited results.
</P>
<P>
   The plan after the war was for weapons inspectors to destroy
Hussein's chemical, biological and nuclear weapons programs of mass
destruction. Hussein was to comply with other obligations, such as
paying reparations to Kuwait, and the sanctions would be lifted.
</P>
<P>
   But the program has lurched from crisis to crisis. Hussein has
not cooperated with the weapons inspectors and, amid repeated U.S.
air strikes, now refuses to let them back in the country.
</P>
<P>
   True, the sanctions have kept Hussein from rebuilding what was
once the fourth largest army in the world. He is not a threat to
his neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   However, even some Middle East experts who support the sanctions
concede that they have strengthened Hussein's hold on Iraq by
consolidating the country's little wealth in his regime. A
stalemate, indeed.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, with concern building about the privation facing
Iraqis, the U.N. approved the so-called oil-for-food program. It
began in late 1996, and now allows Iraq to sell up to $10.4 billion
in oil annually. One-third goes to repaying Kuwait, the rest is for
food, medicine, clean water and electricity. The money is held and
tracked by the U.N.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. says that health and nutrition have stopped
deteriorating, but they are not getting better. About a quarter of
Iraqi children are still malnourished.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials point to the oil-for-food program to show they
mean no harm to ordinary Iraqis. But, Iraq's hobbling oil industry
cannot produce anywhere near the $10.4 billion cap and the U.N. has
concluded that even that would not be enough.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Hussein's own cruel negligence hurts his case for
lifting the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Through oil smuggling, some of which is tolerated by the United
States because the precious commodity goes to allies like Jordan
and Turkey, Hussein can raise an estimated $500 million a year that
is not monitored by the U.N.
</P>
<P>
   He spends it on palaces -- building about a dozen since the
sanctions started. Last month, he opened a new vacation village,
with an amusement park, stadiums and a bronze statue of himself. He
is beginning to build what he says will be the largest mosque in
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein's police have brand new Hyundai patrol cars and the
streets signs brandish new, well-lit portraits of the president.
</P>
<P>
   Worse still, though the U.N. monitors the oil money, Iraq
dispenses the goods. It has not done so well.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. recently reported that Iraq has distributed only 48
percent of the $570 million in medical supplies bought over the
last two years. Warehouses, the U.N. noted, are ``literally
overflowing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason is that they don't want their people to stop
dying,'' says Amatzia Baram, an Israeli expert on Iraq at
Georgetown University. He says Hussein contributes to his people's
misery to build world sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   But just because a dictator does not care about his people does
not mean the world should turn its back.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. concluded in April that, even with the government's
failings, ``the Iraqi people would not be undergoing such
depravations in the absence of the prolonged measures imposed by
the security council and the effects of war . . . the country has
experienced a shift from relative affluence to massive poverty.''
</P>
<P>
   True, lifting the sanctions would give Hussein access to the
kind of money he needs to rebuild his army, which some estimate
would take $10 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In March, U.S. Undersecretary of State Thomas Pickering told a
Senate committee that U.S. policy seeks to get Hussein removed from
office, but in the meantime will rely on the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ``U.N. sanctions of Iraq are critical to our efforts to contain
Hussein. The sanctions deprive Hussein of the revenue he would
otherwise use to reconstitute weapons of mass destruction. That is
why Hussein has set the lifting of sanctions among his highest
priorities,'' Pickering said.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Baram says that Hussein was spending 80 percent of his
money on arms before the Kuwait invasion, so lifting the sanctions
may not improve the lives much for regular Iraqis.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the sanctions counter that Iraq took care of its
humanitarian needs before the sanctions. They say that if U.S.
officials want to stop Hussein from re-arming, they could lead an
arms embargo or continue the frequent air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   There is a middle option. British diplomats are pushing a
proposal that would require Hussein into cooperate for several
months with weapons inspections, then remove the cap on oil sales.
The money would still be controlled by the U.N., but foreign
companies would be encouraged to rebuild the Iraqi oil industry.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say the plan is logical, but has two important drawbacks
-- neither the Americans nor the Iraqis have accepted it.
</P>
<P>
   American officials have supported the concept of removing the
cap, but worry that this plan -- highly complex with possible
loopholes -- could give Hussein too much money or reward him for
not complying with weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
   It could take months to sort out, in part because of the world's
pre-occupation with Milosevic and Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy, now a senior fellow at the New York-based Council on
Foreign Relations, a foreign policy think tank, says U.S. officials
seem in no hurry to deal with Iraq, satisfied that Hussein is
crippled.
</P>
<P>
   He says that is not enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a moral dimension,'' he says. ``A society has been
eviscerated.''

   BAGHDAD, Iraq _ With their sneakers, cartoon-clad backpacks and
pony tails, these girls would fit in at any American school.
</P>
<P>
   But, when visitors enter classes at the Hidayeh (Enlightenment)
Elementary School in Baghdad, the students rise together with
smiles and shout, ``Welcome and long live the leader, Saddam
Hussein!''
</P>
<P>
   There's something else different about schools in Iraq. This
one, with about 1,200 girls, has one telephone and no copying
machine. Lights are often out in the school, and many students sit
on the floors for lack of even a broken-down desk.
</P>
<P>
   Each year, the girls start their studies by erasing the
penciled-in work in last year's workbooks so they can be re-used.
</P>
<P>
   Serious Samar Khatab, a 13-year-old fifth-grader, sums up the
problem saying, ``It is because of the sanctions. The enemy
countries want to take everything from us because we were rich.''
</P>
<P>
   Eight years after Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait and the world
slapped economic sanctions on Iraq, aid officials are worried about
the degradation of a generation of students like Samar.
</P>

   Sanctions supporters will note that there is money squandered in

CLINTON IS A LIVING PHOENIX, RISING REPEATEDLY FROM THE ASHES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, June 13)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT E. THOMPSON  
 c. 1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Let it be recorded that Bill Clinton is a human
Phoenix, rising repeatedly with renewed life from the ashes of doom
and destruction, like the colorful bird of Egyptian religious
legend.
</P>
<P>
   He is one of the most resilient presidents in the 210-year
panorama of the republic. No matter what troubles ensnare him or
how dark the future appears, he manages to emerge victorious.
</P>
<P>
   The latest example of his ability to ride to triumph when
disaster was predicted is the tenuous peace agreement in
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, politicians, columnists, editorial writers and
television commentators labeled NATO's air assault a failure. The
war against Slobodan Milosevic's treachery, they claimed, could not
be won through air power alone; ground troops were a necessity.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, some said, Milosevic already had won the war when he
achieved his goal of forcing roughly a million ethnic Albanians
from their homes in Kosovo. And, they added, echoing pre-World War
II isolationists who viewed the Atlantic and Pacific oceans as
giant protective moats, the United States had no business fighting
in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and his fellow NATO leaders did err badly in declaring
they had no intention of sending combat troops into Kosovo. But
Milosevic knew when he finally entered into a peace accord that
Clinton was considering the use of troops toward the end.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics, filled with hate for Clinton, probably hoped,
either consciously or subconsciously, that the president's policy
would fail. Some complained that Clinton was building up an old
enemy by getting Russia involved in the peace dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   But Russia has a long history of good relations with Yugoslav
Serbs and Russian envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin, working with Finnish
President Marrti Ahtisaari, played a vital role in persuading
Milosevic to yield to NATO's demands.
</P>
<P>
   But that happened only because of the resolve of Clinton and
other NATO leaders in pushing the air war.
</P>
<P>
   So, despite the continued uncertainty of events in Yugoslavia,
we are on the road to peace _ and once again we have witnessed the
emergence of William Jefferson Clinton from the ashes of defeat.
</P>
<P>
   The first such political resurrection at the national level
occurred in 1992 when, after revelations of his extra-marital
affair with Gennifer Flowers, Clinton won a strong second place in
the New Hampshire Democratic primary.
</P>
<P>
   It was after the votes were tallied that night that Clinton
declared himself ``the comeback kid.'' He then went on to defeat
George Bush in the November election.
</P>
<P>
   But early in his presidency, Clinton became involved in an angry
controversy over his campaign promise to permit openly gay
individuals to serve in the military. He was forced to settle for a
compromise that was not wholly acceptable either to gays or to
those who opposed their service in the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   Then, there was the disaster in Somalia where American soldiers
were killed and their bodies dragged through the streets.
</P>
<P>
   He and Mrs. Clinton then put together a cumbersome and costly
health care plan that was to be the centerpiece of their White
House tenure. It was treated to ridicule and rejection on Capitol
Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Without a single Republican vote in Congress, Clinton pushed
through an economic program that included a tax on the wealthy,
which Republicans promptly denounced as the ``biggest tax
increase'' in history.
</P>
<P>
   The upshot of those and other embarrassments was the Democrats'
loss of the House and the Senate in the 1994 congressional
elections. The House last had gone Republican 42 years before.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton rebounded in January 1995 when he told the nation in
his State of the Union address that the era of big government was
over. He promised to work in harmony with the Congress and its GOP
leaders, Speaker Newt Gingrich and Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Special Counsel Ken Starr continued to probe the
Clintons' role in the Whitewater affair and other questionable
ventures. Some of the president's one-time business partners were
indicted and sent to prison.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the Republicans' time to err. They pushed through
policies that were not overwhelmingly popular with the public and
they twice shut down the government. In 1996, despite the many
controversies of his first term, Clinton won a second term.
</P>
<P>
   Then both houses of Congress launched investigations of
Clinton's 1996 campaign fund-raising practices, including the
practice of allowing big contributors to spend a night in the
Lincoln bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   That probe was followed by shocking revelations about his
relationship with Monica Lewinsky, which led the House Judiciary
Committee to vote to impeach him.
</P>
<P>
   For months, the revelations about the sordid affair dragged on,
weakening Clinton's moral authority and his leadership. Finally,
the Senate proved unable to win the two-thirds vote required to
find him guilty and remove him from office.
</P>
<P>
   Last March, he agreed to commit American air power to a war
against Serb cruelty in Kosovo. But as the weeks wore on, with no
sign of Milosevic capitulating, public confidence in his conduct of
international affairs dipped.
</P>
<P>
   Many hurdles remain to be surmounted in the Balkans, where a
massive effort must be undertaken to help rebuild the homes and
businesses of the Kosovars.
</P>
<P>
   But air power did its job, when critics asserted that it would
fail. And Clinton, despite the scars and wounds of an
often-endangered presidency, once again emerged triumphant.
</P>
<P>
   It would be hard to find a parallel in history _ to discover a
president who successfully has weathered a storm as powerful as the
one that had battered Clinton for six-and-a-half-years.

 &HT;    The lowly beet deserves high praise
 &HT;    By Betty Parham
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The beet is the most intense of vegetables. The radish,
admittedly, is more feverish, but the fire of the radish is a cold
fire, the fire of discontent, not of passion. Tomatoes are lusty
enough, yet there runs through tomatoes an undercurrent of
frivolity. Beets are deadly serious.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Tom Robbins
</P>
<P>
   Beets can also be rambunctious, rowdy and downright disorderly.
Unlike with most foods, it is wise to check what you are wearing
before you begin to cook or eat them. If you are not careful, beets
can leach, bleed and stain a garish purplish-pink anything they
touch. That's why, after one or two experiences with the rowdy
root, many people stroll right on by the beet section of the
produce market, partaking instead of the safer canned and pickled
variety.
</P>
<P>
   Beets have a lively social history in America. At the turn of
the century, beets helped nourish masses of Slavic and Jewish
immigrants, who adored them. In the meantime, mainstream society
turned up their noses at the earthy vegetable and their association
with the teeming masses and poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Fannie Farmer (the Martha Stewart of her day) had some success
in putting a polish on the lowbrow reputation of beets by toning
them down with a cornstarch sauce and giving her recipe a
high-class moniker _ ``Harvard'' beets.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing a social trend, and not to be ``beet'' by its
archrival, Yale University came up with a recipe for ``Yale'' beets
using butter instead of cornstarch and orange juice instead of
vinegar.
</P>
<P>
   Beet cuisine has expanded a great deal since the days of those
Ivy League dishes and the borscht of the immigrants. And
considering that beets are packed with good nutrition from leaf to
root, it may be time to quit beating around the bush and give beets
another chance.

tips, loads of creative recipes, a bit of history and some humor.

 &HT;    A casserole to celebrate the season of Vidalias
 &HT;    By Marcia Langhenry
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There may be more varieties of Vidalia Onion Casserole
than there are counties in Georgia authorized to grow and sell the
registered sweet onions. So when S.L. Harrold's e-mail request back
in January came in for one using onions, butter and cheese _ as
most do _ we decided to wait until onion season to test the one
that sounded best.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Bohmer of Acworth (Ga.) sent this one from ``Atlanta's
Cooknotes,'' published by the Junior League of Atlanta. ``Soubise''
is a French word that means a puree of onions and rice served with
meats or eggs, or a cream sauce with onion puree added.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of my most favorite recipes, and I can't wait for
Vidalia onion season so we can enjoy it again,'' Bohmer wrote back
in the winter.
</P>
<P>
   The season continues until mid-July, but Vidalia supplies kept
in controlled-atmosphere storage are sometimes available through
December.

 &HT;    Picking beers of summer
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The neighborhood pool opened over Memorial Day weekend
and a couple of us smuggled in a little cooler filled with
contraband _ two bottles of beer and glasses wrapped in towels. A
glass _ and not a frosted one _ is the only way to drink beer, but
in these circumstances my natural caution might have led me to
settle for plastic picnic cups. The club, reasonably enough,
doesn't allow bottles or glass at poolside, although I did see one
bikini-clad woman flouncing about with a glass of white wine. One
misstep and she and her drink would have been swimming.
</P>
<P>
   We were less conspicuous, encamping sedately to the side of the
splashing.
</P>
<P>
   It was summer again, and the surest sign was kids doing
cannonballs off a springboard. The next surest was the two lugs
hauling cases of cheap, canned beer to the barbecue area. I don't
think they cared one way or another about the beer, just so long as
it fizzed like soda pop and gave an alcoholic buzz.
</P>
<P>
   That's the problem anything calling itself a ``summer beer''
faces: It's thrown itself into a sea of indifference. If a summer
beer is supposed to be light, crisp and all the rest _ standard
descriptions of the genre _ what's to distinguish it from the
mainstream flood that's already light, crisp and generally lousy?
</P>
<P>
   The variety of summer beers on the market would suggest there's
no consensus. On the one hand you have Belgian White Ales, which in
Belgium are enjoyed year-round, and on the other you have lagers
that a German might associate with a region more than a season.
</P>
<P>
   Americans, conditioned more by marketing than by history or
tradition, think differently. First you conjure up the image and
create the label _ those being what most consumers buy _ and then
you make something you hope fits.
</P>
<P>
   This is why I could go an entire summer _ a whole year, for that
matter _ without a ``summer beer.'' Apparently I'm not alone. In a
market crowded already, at least one Atlanta wholesaler decided not
to distribute summer beers this year.
</P>
<P>
   Not that some of these beers aren't enjoyable. Several are fine
examples of one style or another. But it's the style and not the
season they bring to mind. Here, then (and in no particular order),
is a rundown on some of the better beers of summer:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Red Brick Summer Brew. A repeat of last year's, which was
named one of the Journal-Constitution's 10 Best in Atlanta.
Dry-hopping with Ahtanum
</P>
<P>
   hops gives this light-bodied ale its distinctive note, although
I don't detect the subtle, almost pearlike quality of last year's.
Just right for picnics and ballgames, this might be the best beer
Atlanta Brewing Co. produces.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Sierra Nevada Summerfest. A California pioneer in craft
brewing shows the industry giants how well a lager can be done.
This isn't a ``big'' lager, but it has the Sierra Nevada signature
of balance and perfection.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't brew it to any particular German style,'' Sierra
Nevada's Steve Harrison says. ``We just wanted to do a
bottom-fermented beer, and get it to where we wanted it.'' Where
they have it is somewhere close to the Munich Hellas style, soft on
the palate and always drinkable.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Redhook Blonde Ale. Fuller in flavor than most summer beers,
and not quite as crisp. Redhook has done well with this beer _
better, evidently, than it had with the splendid Redhook Rye, which
to my mind fit the definition of ``summer beer'' as well as any.
And it wasn't even marketed as one. Alas, though, it's no longer
available year-round or even this summer. The Blonde Ale does its
best, but the two really aren't comparable.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Dogwood Summer Brew. Another of the Journal-Constitution's 10
Best in Atlanta last year, this is a Belgian White Ale with an
orangey color and a delightful spiciness. Where most summer beers
are suited to hot dogs and mustard, a beer as delicate as this one
travels in better culinary company, from shrimp salads to grilled
salmon.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Samuel Adams Summer Ale. Always well-made, always popular. A
touch of lemon gives it a zestiness that's not too obvious, and the
malt background has a nice complexity. But many will wonder why
this is a summer beer and the same brewery's White Ale _ available
year-round _ is not.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Bert Grant's Summer Ale. One of Grant's four single-varietal
seasonals, this one debuting the Amarillo hop, a proprietary strain
from Hop Union of Washington state. Reddish in color and, at 32
International Bitterness Units, hoppier than most summer beers. The
seasonals are some of Grant's best.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Biere du Soleil. Brewed by D'Achouffe in Belgium, this amber,
bottle-conditioned beer might be the most interesting of the lot, a
true Belgian beer made just for summer. It has a sparkling
character but a surprising hoppiness (32 IBUs). New to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Each of these is likely to suit a different mood and moment. But
there will be times when none of them hits the spot like a lambic,
fruity and slightly tart. Served in a champagne flute, lightly
chilled, this is an elegant aperitif. Many people who think they
don't like beer find, to their great surprise, that they love
lambics. Lindeman's framboise, kriek and peche are all good
choices.
</P>
<P>
   PICK OF THE WEEK
</P>
<P>
   They're those banana beers, although you can sometimes taste
clove as well.
</P>
<P>
   Hefeweizens are another whole class of summer beers, but a class
unto themselves. In recent years, Americans have become better
acquainted with this style whose first obstacle to enjoyment is the
name itself.
</P>
<P>
   First things first: In German, ``Hefe'' means yeast and
``weisse'' means white, the latter implying a high proportion of
wheat in the grist. Combined, ``hefeweizen'' refers to any
unfiltered wheat beer. Because the beer is unfiltered, the yeast is
suspended _ hence the cloudiness. Often served with a slice of
lemon, hefeweizens sometimes resemble (but only superficially)
Belgian Whites in their tartness and their pale yellow color. But
where a Belgian White has notes of coriander and orange peel, the
yeast in a hefeweizen produces esters that hint of apple or plum,
banana or clove.
</P>
<P>
   A number of excellent hefeweizens are widely available, but
there is none like Schneider Weisse, brewed by the Schneider family
in the Bavarian town of Kelheim. Closer to amber in color,
Schneider Weisse is as ``big'' as a hefeweizen gets, fuller
flavored without being heavy. Served in a tall, vaselike glass, it
produces a huge, creamy crown _ and if you don't like the foam on a
beer, well, you have to wait a long while before this one loses its
head.
</P>
<P>
   It's the kind of beer best enjoyed by itself or with mild to
medium-strong cheeses. As big as it is, Schneider Weisse can take
on stronger cheese than most hefeweizens, but this is a beer to
drink at leisure and not to wash down food.
</P>
<P>
   You won't find it in six-packs or in many supermarkets. It's
available only in a pint-plus bottle (about 18 ounces) that goes
for about $2.75. Hefeweizens can be an acquired taste, and not
everyone acquires it. But even those drawn to more robust beers
acknowledge that here is one of the world's classics.

   GRAY: A Philadelphia company linked to political consultant Pat
Gray is in line to manage Kemper Arena and Bartle Hall. The
company, SMG _ one of the largest private operators of arenas in
the nation, including the Superdome and Miami Convention Center _
paid Gray to conduct a poll on whether Kansas City residents
favored the private management of the city's convention facilities.
SMG officials confirm they will meet with Mayor Kay Barnes in a few
weeks to discuss their plans. Barnes has said she favors letting a
private company operate Kemper and Bartle, even though City Manager
Bob Collins' studies are not complete. SMG is the second company to
hire Gray for help in taking over a city facility. Meanwhile,
Councilman Paul Danaher _ Barnes' point man in privatization
efforts _ has approached a Maryland firm to take over operations of

The 600-acre island in southwest Louisiana has no stores or
services; the seven families who live here use the four-car ferry
to get to work, do errands and go to school. Without the ferry
service, which began in 1939 with a rowboat, the island is
uninhabitable. And uninhabited it may become, thanks to a bill
passed last month in the state House of Representatives. The bill,
pending a Senate vote, kills the state-run ferry service, which
costs $521,000 a year. (Konigsmark, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

NET BOOSTERS WARN BUSINESSES TO GET ON LINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EDWARD IWATA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. _ For business fossils still stuck in the
technological Stone Age, Internet boosters at the vanguard of the
on-line revolution slammed home the message Tuesday that electronic
commerce is transforming business faster than you can say ``new
economy.''
</P>
<P>
   When the mostly government-run Internet became commercialized in
1984, skeptics scoffed at its potential in the brutal corporate
realm.
</P>
<P>
   Even today, some traditional investors and business people pooh-
pooh the idea that on-line commerce will rule the day in the near
future. Look at those wild stock market valuations, they say.
</P>
<P>
   Look at those virtual companies with no profits or real
products.
</P>
<P>
   But at a venture capital conference in Palo Alto sponsored by
the Asian-American Manufacturers Association, Internet executives
and investment bankers offered more hard business proof that the
on-line revolution is here to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is fundamentally real despite all the hype and
the volatility,'' said Michael Parekh, head of Internet Research at
Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co. in Palo Alto. ``We feel the Internet is
actually underhyped, and this is only the beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   After years of hedging, mainstream companies beyond Silicon
Valley are finally leaping aboard. Corporate spending on
information technology next year will rise to 6 percent of the
nation's gross domestic product, compared with 1 percent in 1994,
according to Goldman Sachs. Today, millions of businesses are
linked on line.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street still is bullish on the future of e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the recent swoon in Internet stocks, the market
capitalization of Internet companies skyrocketed to $300 billion
over the past four years, the executives said. As the on-line
infrastructure grows and profits come, Wall Street will pour even
more money into virtual companies.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, consumers continue their love affair with the
Internet, spending an average of one hour a day on line. About 250
million personal computers have Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   The next five years will bring billions of non-computer devices
from set-top boxes on televisions, to personal digital assistants
and various telephone-style devices.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is a hurricane creating opportunities in all
sectors of technology: software, hardware, semiconductors,
computing systems _ everything,'' said Geoffrey Yang, general
partner at Institutional Venture Partners in Menlo Park. ``It's all
about the Internet _ nothing else matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all is paradise, though. The Internet boosters warned that
technology companies are having serious trouble finding good
engineers. The larger Internet-related companies are starting to
resemble the old, lumbering IBM of the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Too many eager and ill-equipped players are flooding niche
markets, with many dying and few surviving. Foreign competition is
warming up, too, with European and Japanese companies slowly
awakening to the vast potential of on-line commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call it the Internet tsunami _ it's very big and very
disruptive,'' Parekh said. ``It's creating a lot of wealth, and
it's destroying a lot of wealth.''

<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail

</P>
<P>
   Q: An article about the satellite Starshine, released by the
space shuttle, said it would be visible from Earth and could be
tracked by the naked eye. How can we find information about
Starshine and about viewing times and locations?
</P>
<P>
   A: Detailed information about the satellite can be found on the
Internet at www.azinet.com (and click on Starshine Project). For
details on viewing locations, check www2.gsoc.dlr.de/starshine (and
click on ``Select From the Database''). A tip: Be sure you have a
good observing site, out in the open, away from a lot of trees or
buildings and, most importantly, away from bright lights. Most
satellites, including Starshine, are pretty faint, so you'll have
to be sure there's no strong skyglow from city lights. The
satellite is expected to be visible during the next six months to a
year at certain morning and evening twilight periods to observers
located between latitudes 60 degrees north and 60 degrees south.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I recently read that Russia is the largest country in the
world, with Canada No. 2. If the United States and Canada were
merged into a single entity, would it then be larger than Russia?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. Canada's area is 3,849,674 square miles (including
inland water). The area of the United States is 3,615,292 square
miles (including inland water, but excluding the Great Lakes and
Lake Saint Clair). Add them and the total is 7,464,966 square
miles. Russia's area is 6,592,850 square miles.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A brief item in the newspaper reported that the Israeli navy
was looking for a submarine that was lost 31 years ago. Do you have
any more details?
</P>
<P>
   A: The wreckage of the Dakar was found May 28. The Dakar, an old
British submarine that had been refitted in Portsmouth, England, as
an Israeli vessel, was on its way to Israel when it disappeared in
the Mediterranean shortly after midnight on Jan. 25, 1968. At the
time, there was speculation that it had been sunk by the Egyptians
or Soviets. But now that investigators have examined video shots of
the wreckage, it's believed that the evidence indicates a
collision.
</P>
<P>
   The sub was discovered by American search-and-salvage experts
about 300 miles from Israel, between the Greek island of Crete and
the island nation of Cyprus, in about 9,600 feet of water. As
reported by The Associated Press, Capt. Doron Amir, a retired
Israeli navy investigator, and other investigators theorize that
the sub probably spotted a big ship coming at it and attempted to
crash-dive to avoid a collision. But its conning tower was struck
and ripped open, flooding and sinking it.
</P>
<P>
   The Dakar's entire crew of 68 presumably died in the accident.
The investigation is continuing.
</P>
<P>
   Q: News reports say the new owner of the Washington Redskins is
34-year-old Daniel Snyder. How did someone so young make enough of
a fortune to pay for such a team?
</P>
<P>
   A: Snyder didn't come up with the entire amount, but he is
investing a lot: $120 million in cash, according to The Washington
Post. Family members are adding another $90 million and minority
partners Fred Drasner and Mort Zuckerman each are putting up $90
million Snyder, a lifelong Washingtonian, made his $500 million
fortune in marketing and advertising. Zuckerman and Drasner have
known Snyder since the mid-1980s and were original investors in
Snyder Communications of Bethesda, Md.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I always thought Memorial Day is intended to honor all U.S.
soldiers who died in battle. But my mother says there's a separate
Memorial Day for Confederate soldiers. Can you clarify?
</P>
<P>
   A: You're both right. While Memorial Day originally honored
military personnel who died in the Civil War, it now honors those
who died in any war while serving the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, most of the southern states also have their own days
for honoring the Confederate dead: Georgia, on April 26, the date
in 1865 of the final surrender of Confederate Gen. Joseph E.
Johnston to the Union army's Gen. William T. Sherman; Mississippi,
the last Monday in April; Alabama, the fourth Monday in April;
North Carolina and South Carolina, on May 10, the anniversary of
the 1865 apprehension of Jefferson Davis by Federal cavalry;
Virginia, on the last Monday in May; and Louisiana, on June 3,
Davis' birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A relative is planning to work in China in the next couple of
months. Is it safe? What agency can give me up-to-date information
about the political climate for foreigners there?
</P>
<P>
   A: The State Department issues travel warnings when it
recommends that Americans avoid a certain country. China isn't on
the current list, but it is the subject of a public announcement,
which the department uses to disseminate information about
terrorist threats and other relatively short-term conditions that
it says pose ``significant risks or disruptions'' to Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The public announcement for China _ issued May 27 with an
expiration date (as of June 2) of June 18 _ advises American
citizens to exercise caution while living or traveling in China, in
view of the 10th anniversary of the June 4 Tiananmen Square
demonstrations and the ``lingering tension'' resulting from Chinese
reaction to the May 7 NATO bombing of the Chinese Embassy in
Belgrade, Yugoslavia.

<P>
   Q: On the TV program ``JAG,'' the time is often referred to as
``Zulu.'' What does that mean?
</P>
<P>
   A: A code word used internationally for the time at Greenwich,
England, Zulu time is used as a reference standard when in, or
crossing through, other time zones around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent item in Q&AMP;A described the War Powers Act as a law.
It then referred to it as a resolution. So which is it?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's correct to call it a resolution, an act and a law. By
whatever name, it was passed by Congress in 1973. This is how it
evolved that year:
</P>
<P>
   Bills limiting the power of a president to commit U.S. forces to
future hostilities without congressional approval were passed July
18 by the House and July 20 by the Senate. The Senate version,
unlike the House bill, defined emergency situations in which the
president could commit forces without prior congressional approval,
but set a limit of 30 days on such action unless Congress approved.
And there were other variations in wording.
</P>
<P>
   The two bills went to a conference committee for resolution of
differences. The final bill passed the Senate on Oct. 10 and the
House on Oct. 12. But on Oct. 24 President Nixon vetoed it, saying
it placed unconstitutional restrictions on the flexibility of the
president to defend the United States, and that it was not in the
best interests of the nation. Then on Nov. 7 the House, by a vote
of 284-135, and the Senate, by a vote of 75-18, overrode the
president's veto. So the bill, a resolution of the differences
between the original versions passed by the two chambers, became
law.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have some cans of old paint that I want to get rid of in an
environmentally proper way. Any suggestions?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Georgia Environmental Protection Division offers this
advice: Put cat litter or sand, which will absorb the paint, in the
cans. When it dries and hardens, seal the cans and put them in your
regular garbage.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are my senior citizen eyes deceiving me? Is the lawyer who
just filed a suit in the Littleton, Colo., shooting case the same
one involved in the recent Jenny Jones case?
</P>
<P>
   A: One and the same. Lawyer Geoffrey Fieger, best known for
representing Jack Kevorkian, filed a lawsuit May 27 in state court
in Denver on behalf of the parents of a Columbine High School
shooting victim.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, the first stemming from the shooting, was filed on
behalf of Vonda and Michael Shoels, whose 18-year-old son, Isaiah,
was the only African-American among the 12 students and one teacher
gunned down April 20 by Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17. The
lawsuit, against the parents of the gunmen, alleges that they were
negligent in how they supervised their children. It doesn't specify
a dollar amount, although Fieger said he will seek $250 million
from the two sets of parents. Colorado law, however, sets a cap of
$250,000 in a negligent death lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   In the case involving TV talk show host Jenny Jones, Fieger
asked a jury in Pontiac, Mich., to award $71.5 million in damages
against her program and its corporate owner, Warner Bros., for the
death of a gay man who was killed after revealing a crush on
another of the program's guests. After deliberating for seven
hours, the 12-member jury on May 7 delivered a $25 million verdict
against ``The Jenny Jones Show'' show for negligence.

 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I saw an article saying Cold War veterans now were getting
federal recognition. Are any benefits available to them, and how
does one apply?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Cold War Recognition Certificate, established by Congress
as part of the fiscal 1998 National Defense Authorization Act, is
symbolic, with no financial reward attached.
</P>
<P>
   All members of the armed forces and federal government civilian
personnel ``who faithfully served the United States during the Cold
War era'' are eligible. The specified dates for such service are
Sept. 2, 1945, to Dec. 26, 1991. An application letter, along with
documentation proving service during the period, is required.
Acceptable documentation includes any government form _ copy, not
original, because it can't be returned _ that includes the
applicant's name and Social Security number (or military service or
Foreign Service number) and date of service.
</P>
<P>
   The mailing address for requests for the certificate: Cold War
Recognition, 4035 Ridge Top Road, Suite 400, Fairfax, VA 22030. The
fax number is 703-275-6749. Information also is available on the
Internet at http://coldwar.army.mil/ or by calling 703-275-6279.

<P>
   Q: A steak dinner rides on the answer to my question, which
arises because of a recent TV travelog about Australia's Great
Barrier Reef. I say it's natural, but my son-in-law says it's
man-made. Who is right?
</P>
<P>
   A: We hope you'll enjoy a thick T-bone at your son-in-law's
expense. Outback, perhaps?
</P>
<P>
   Scientists believe the Great Barrier Reef began forming about
500,000 years ago. The coral reef is a limestone formation made of
the hardened skeletons of dead water animals called polyps.
Billions of living coral polyps are attached to the reef, so it's
continuing to form _ naturally.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When discussing conservatives and liberals, the press often
uses ``left'' and ``right'' with regard to people's views on an
issue. Can you elaborate on the origin of these labels?
</P>
<P>
   A: These are just two terms describing the ideological spectrum,
which (from left to right) includes radical, liberal, centrist (or
moderate), conservative and reactionary. Safire's New Political
Dictionary traces left wing-right wing descriptions to the seating
arrangement used by the presiding officers of the French National
Assembly. They placed the radicals at the cote gauche (left side),
the moderates in the center directly in front, and the conservative
nobles on the droit (right). Like so many political terms, the
``wings'' derived from military use.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Pep Boys has as its logo the caricatures of three men named
Manny, Moe and Jack. Were they real people?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. They were Emanuel ``Manny'' Rosenfeld, Maurice ``Moe''
Strauss and Graham ``Jack'' Jackson. In 1921, they _ along with
another Moe, Moe Radavitz, who left the company after a few years _
founded a business originally known as Pep Auto Supplies in
Philadelphia. The word Pep came from one of the products they were
selling, Pep Valve Grinding Compound, and the change from Auto
Supplies to Boys evolved through common usage.
</P>
<P>
   In 1923, Strauss went to California, where he saw a dress shop
named Minnie, Maude and Mabel's. When he returned he asked a
friend, Harry Moscovitz, to create the caricatures you still see
today. Ironically, the three faces that have become so recognizable
as Manny, Moe and Jack aren't truly theirs. Jack's face appeared
briefly when the caricatures first were penned. However, after
Graham Jackson left Pep Boys, his face was replaced with that of
Strauss' brother, Isaac ``Izzy'' Strauss. After Izzy left the
company, Rosenfeld's brother, Murray, joined the team, but Izzy's
face remained and continues to this day to be part of the company's
icon.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Back during the Clinton impeachment proceedings, actor Alec
Baldwin, appearing on a late-night TV show, made remarks
encouraging people to murder Rep. Henry Hyde and other Republicans
and their families. The Capitol Police, I believe, were
investigating that. Did anything come of that investigation?
</P>
<P>
   A: There was no investigation by Capitol Police. The episode
started when Baldwin, a shrill critic of Congress, made an outburst
Dec. 11 against House Judiciary Committee Chairman Hyde (R-Ill.) in
a skit on NBC-TV's ``Late Night With Conan O'Brien.'' In it,
Baldwin shouted, ``If we were in other countries, we would . . .
all of us together would go down to Washington and we would stone
Henry Hyde to death. We would stone him to death. . . . And we
would go to their homes and we'd kill their wives and children. We
would kill their families.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde, who had received a number of death threats at the time and
was under armed guard, reacted by saying he was ``sickened'' by the
comments. ``To kill my family because you disagree with me? To
laugh about that? There are people out there, sick people, just
waiting for a push.''
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Kasteler, a Baldwin publicist, said people angered by his
remarks were stiffs. ``They ought to lighten up,'' she added.
``It's a comedy show.'' NBC promised never to rerun the program,
with a network spokesman adding that the skit ``was obviously a
joke and meant to be taken as such.'' Baldwin, meanwhile, wrote a
letter of apology to Hyde, apparently putting an end to the
incident.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where can I get information online about the 2000 Super Bowl
in Atlanta? I found several sites for prior games, but not for the
upcoming one.
</P>
<P>
   A: The address: www.superbowlXXXIV.org/ Q: Do you know anything
about a recent recall of Saabs? I need to know which models were
involved and what the problem is.
</P>
<P>
   A: The recall, announced last week by Saab Cars USA, affects
26,000 Saab 9000s from model years 1992 through 1994. The automaker
said the covers on the air bag's electronic control module, located
in the engine compartment, could allow moisture to enter and
corrode its circuit boards, possibly causing the air bag to
malfunction. The manufacturer said owners of affected models would
be notified by mail in July to have the parts replaced by a dealer,
if necessary, and at no cost.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm told that President Clinton has issued 11 executive
orders. What are they?
</P>
<P>
   A: He has issued and signed far more than 11 executive orders,
which are presidential proclamations that carry the force of law.
According to the National Archives and Records Administration
Federal Register, as of May 25, Clinton had issued 13 such orders
this year alone. In 1998, there were 38; 1997, 38; 1996, 46; 1995,
43; 1994, 54; and 1993, 57.
</P>
<P>
   Those signed this year include Identification of Trade Expansion
Priorities and Discriminatory Procurement Practices; Using
Technology to Improve Training Opportunities for Federal Government
Employees; and Designation of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
(Serbia/Montenegro), Albania, the Airspace Above, and Adjacent
Waters as a Combat Zone.
</P>
<P>
   On the Internet, check www.nara.gov/fedreg/eoclint.html to read
details of all the executive orders issued during Clinton's
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The Postal Service has a Cinco de Mayo stamp. What does that
mean, and why is it on a U.S. stamp?
</P>
<P>
   A: Cinco de Mayo is the name of the annual celebration
commemorating the victory of Mexican troops over the French at the
Battle of Puebla on May 5, 1862. In Spanish, cinco is five, and
mayo is May. The U.S. Postal Service first issued the stamp, in a
32-cent version, on April 16, 1998, as part of its Holiday
Celebrations series. The 33-cent version of the same stamp was
issued this past April 27.
</P>
<P>
   When the 32-cent stamp was introduced, the Postal Service
explained that it ``celebrates not just the victory of Mexican
troops on May 5, 1862, but the victories Mexican-Americans have
fought and won to make American history.''
</P>
<P>
   Other stamps in the Postal Service's Holiday Celebrations series
honor Hanukkah and Kwanzaa.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Has there been any progress in the development of vegetable
oils for use in vehicles as a replacement for the petroleum-based
product?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's coming along. The developer of the new product, Agro
Management Group of Colorado Springs, Colo., recently licensed a
Michigan group to be the first to sell AMG 2000. The new oil, which
will cost about $2.25 a quart, is a 100 percent vegetable oil
blend. A big advantage touted by its developers is that, compared
to traditional motor oil, it's almost as environmentally friendly
as salad dressing: biodegradable, nontoxic and producing fewer
harmful emissions.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Allen of Agro Management said the product's blend is
secret, but he added that it includes soy oil and canola oil. It
was developed over six years at a cost of $2 million, with $250,000
in research funds contributed by the United Soybean Board, a group
founded by soybean farmers.
</P>
<P>
   The developers recently concluded an 18-day tour through 18
states using two trucks, one lubricated with conventional motor
oil, the other with the new soybean product. The two materials
performed equally, the researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, they cautioned consumers not to try pouring oil
from their kitchen cupboard into an engine, because high
temperatures would cause it to gel. AMG 2000's formulation prevents
that.

IN AIR TRAVEL, BANGOR IS ALL THE RAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ELLEN BARRY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANGOR, MAINE _ By 12:15 a.m on Monday, when Delta flight 064
made a hasty landing at Bangor International Airport, passenger
services knew the drill: remove the belligerent passenger from his
position hogtied in the aisle, calm down the flight attendants who
had been sitting on him, wipe the blood off the cabin ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   When Bangor's two FBI agents showed up to take Christopher Bayes
into custody, the situation seemed almost normal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like anything else,'' said Sergeant James Owens of the
Bangor Police Department. ``You do it enough times, you get used to
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the last 31 days, three separate airliners have made
emergency landings in Bangor to remove British passengers who have
gone into violent and threatening rages during transatlantic
flights. And while other airports might shrink from airborne
discipline problems, Bangor is actively marketing its willingness
to handle them. After the offenders are safely incarcerated in the
Penobscot County Jail _ all three are there right now _ Bangor
airport sends the aircraft off with the message that they are
welcome to come back the next time.
</P>
<P>
   Emergency landings are bread and butter for Bangor, where a full
25 percent of landings are unplanned stops for refueling or
emergencies, which can bring in $10,000 apiece. With a runway long
enough for a space shuttle landing and a strategic position en
route to any northern European destination, Bangor is an obvious
choice for pilots who need to get out of the air fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, other airports aren't that interested in doing
this,'' said Jeff Russell, head of marketing for the airport.
``It's the dregs of the business.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent studies have suggested that air-rage incidents are on the
upturn, although the emotional stresses of flying _ a loss of
control and a sense of containment _ are still the same. Among
air-rage incidents that have been documented, the most common
grievance was attendants' refusing to serve alcohol to passengers.
The second was seat assignment, the third was flight attendants'
attitude, and the fourth was airline food, Russell said.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Bangor International Airport has handled
between 8 and 12 air-rage landings per year, and in March 1988
airport officials tentatively began marketing its air-rage services
at a convention of European carriers. In a business where an
unscheduled stop can wipe out a flight's profit margin, Bangor's
main selling point is a quick turnaround time. But there's also a
geographical asset, according to Russell _ Bangor's airspace seems
to be a hot spot for passenger misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've been flying for five, six hours, you've seen the movie,
you've eaten the food, you've written in your journal and it's time
to act up. Trouble seems to develop within 250 nautical miles of
Bangor in either direction,'' said Russell.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, this spring has brought an alarming amount of
business. On May 3, an Airtours International flight made an
emergency landing en route from Orlando to Manchester, England when
a British mechanic kicked out an interior window in a violent rage
and threatened to kick in the outer window, which could have caused
a dangerous sudden loss of cabin pressure. Bryan Neal, 25, of
Manchester, was enraged when flight attendants refused him alcohol,
and by the choice of an in-flight movie that he had seen already.
</P>
<P>
   Neal is serving a 60-day sentence and owes the airline $25,000
for the damage to the plane.
</P>
<P>
   On May 26, Shabiya Davidson _ also of Manchester _ assaulted a
flight attendant. It was later discovered that Davidson had been
transporting cocaine in a condom in his stomach and the condom had
burst, said Bangor police. Davidson is also serving a 60-day
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   The latest incident, like the first, was directly
alcohol-related. Bayes, 41, who is also from Manchester, sexually
groped two female flight attendants, cursed loudly and tried to get
into the cockpit to demand another drink, Russell said. The cockpit
door was locked and two male flight attendants subdued Bayes and
tied him up, using nylon restraints as well as three cloth napkins.
When a passenger services team boarded the plane, the flight
attendants were sitting on him, Russell said.
</P>
<P>
   Bayes, who was arraigned Tuesday, faces charges of assault and
interference with the flight crew.
</P>
<P>
   The two flight attendants who struggled with Bayes were treated
for minor injuries and released, Russell said.
</P>
<P>
   After ground crews cleaned blood from a cut on Bayes's mouth off
the seats, the floor and the ceiling of the cabin, the flight
departed Bangor again at 2:22 _ less than two hours after its
emergency landing.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the industry, many blame the incidents on an increasing
casualness about air travel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Air travel used to be a special thing to do. People used to
get dressed up to go on a flight,'' said Russell. Now, he said,
``Pilots will tell you it's like driving a bus.''
</P>
<P>
   But others say the relaxing of travel decorum is only part of
the story. Air-rage reports also may be up because flight
attendants are no longer expected to humor boorish and drunken
passengers, and they are taken seriously by the airline when they
complain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many times the crew felt the air-rager was being supported.
They were spirited off and given free tickets and mollycoddled,''
said First Officer Drew Engelke, a communications officer for the
Allied Pilots Association. That all changed on a United Airlines
flight in 1995, when a passenger in a drunken rampage defecated on
a food trolley, Engelke said.
</P>
<P>
   By going public with the event, and by prosecuting the
passenger, United helped shift airlines' approach to unruly
passengers. ``I think that maybe the norms that were always there
are just being enforced,'' Engelke said.
</P>
<P>
   From ground level in Bangor, though, there's nothing new about
rowdy drunkenness.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not all that different from taking a drunk out of a
bar,'' said Owens, of the Bangor police. ``Up here we call it a
`want-out.' Somebody is wanted out.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the coincidence that all three men now in detention are
from Manchester, England, Owens said, ``You can make your own
assumptions.''
</P>
<P>
   Special agent Paul Palumbo, who along with Wayne Hedrick staffs
Bangor's FBI office, is watching Bangor's air-rage population grow
with some amusement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a whole new wing at the Penobscot County Jail for
Englishmen,'' said Palumbo. ``We're serving tea and popovers.''

BOARD VOTES TO LIMIT POLICE ROLE AT SCHOOLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RAY DELGADO  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The San Francisco Unified School District
approved a resolution Tuesday that limits the presence of police
officers on campuses.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution, approved late Tuesday by a 5-1 vote, requires
that staff members first contact school administrators to resolve a
problem with a student unless the student poses an immediate threat
to others or has broken the law. It also includes an amendment
requiring on-campus officers not to carry guns while on school
grounds for non-emergency matters.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. James Dudley of the Police Department's juvenile division
had urged the school board not to vote on the measure until the
police had a chance to review it.
</P>
<P>
   After the vote on the ``Safe Schools'' measure, Dudley
criticized the decision, saying it would keep officers in the dark
about potential acts of violence or troubled youths. He also said
the district didn't have the authority to govern police practices
on school grounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they refuse to have us on campus with guns, I don't know
who that will benefit,'' Dudley said.
</P>
<P>
   The board was divided about whether to postpone a vote on the
resolution because of Police Department objections and questions by
the district's own lawyers over the wording of the measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been multiple meetings,'' said school board member
Jill Wynns. ``Every effort has been made to reach as much consensus
as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The measure says school officials will continue to foster good
relations between students and police officers assigned to the
various schools. But instead of involving the officers in routine
disciplinary matters, as some school officials currently do, the
measure requires the school staff to first notify a school
administrator before calling the police.
</P>
<P>
   The measure also requires school officials to contact an
offending student's parents and give them reasonable time to
respond and be present during police questioning.
</P>
<P>
   Dudley said he feared the measure would leave officers in the
dark about problems among students.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm afraid that some incidents that we should know about will
slip through the cracks,'' Dudley said. ``Our presence helps to
break down the stereotypes of what police officers are.''
</P>
<P>
   While the police may have opposed the measure, the people who
attended the meeting were supportive.
</P>
<P>
   Speaker after speaker urged the school board to help create a
less intimidating environment on campus. Some carried signs reading
``Schools, not jails,'' ``Cops aren't teachers'' and ``Stop making
us criminals.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How would you feel walking into your learning environment and
have police breathing down your neck,'' said Jamie Motley, 16, a
junior at Wallenberg High School. ``I need someone to talk to about
my problems, not arrest me for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Teresa Gallegos, a parent, said she thought school officials
were too quick to involve the police in disciplinary matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to use some common sense in what long-term effects
having all this police presence at the schools has,'' Gallegos
said. ``We need to have more counselors, not police.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Rita Cook e-mails a request for chicken cordon bleu. It seems
like an easy enough request, but it's surprisingly hard to track
down in current cookbooks.
</P>
<P>
   This classic (which was probably one of the first dishes many of
us ate at a ``fancy'' restaurant) is quite simple to cook at home.
It's also a hit with many children.
</P>
<P>
   The first recipe is from ``Better Homes and Gardens America's
Best-Loved Community Recipes: Volume II'' (Meredith, $29.95). The
second recipe, a slight variation, is from ``The Chicken and
Poultry Bible'' by Christian Teubner, Sybil Graefin Schoenfeldt and
Siegfried Scholtyssek (Penguin, $27.95).
</P>
<P>
   CHICKEN CORDON BLEU
</P>
<P>
   Serves 6
</P>
<P>
   3 medium whole chicken breasts, skinned, boned and halved
lengthwise
</P>
<P>
   6 slices (about 6 ounces) fully cooked ham
</P>
<P>
   12 thin slices (about 6 ounces) Swiss cheese
</P>
<P>
   2 eggs, beaten
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons dry white wine
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   1 cup fine dry bread crumbs
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup margarine or butter
</P>
<P>
   8 ounces fresh shiitake and/or button mushrooms, sliced (3 cups)
</P>
<P>
   2 (10 3/4-ounce) cans cream of mushroom soup
</P>
<P>
   1 1/4 cups milk (1 soup can full)
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup dry white wine
</P>
<P>
   Rinse chicken breasts; pat dry. Place each breast half, boned
side up, between 2 pieces of clear, heavy-duty plastic wrap.
</P>
<P>
   Working from center to edges, lightly pound with flat side of a
meat mallet to a 1/8-inch thickness. Remove plastic wrap.
</P>
<P>
   Place 1 slice ham and 2 slices Swiss cheese on each piece of
chicken, folding ham and cheese if necessary to fit on chicken.
</P>
<P>
   Starting from 1 short side, roll up each piece of chicken,
jellyroll fashion, and secure with wooden toothpicks.
</P>
<P>
   In shallow dish, stir together beaten eggs and 2 tablespoons
white wine. Roll each chicken bundle in flour, dip in egg mixture
and coat with bread crumbs. Preheat oven to 325 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   In large skillet, melt margarine or butter. Lightly brown
chicken on all sides. Remove chicken from skillet; reserve
drippings.
</P>
<P>
   Transfer chicken to 3-quart rectangular baking dish and
carefully remove toothpicks.
</P>
<P>
   Cook mushrooms in skillet with reserved drippings for 4-5
minutes or until tender. Add undiluted soup and milk to skillet.
Stir until well mixed.
</P>
<P>
   Remove soup-milk mixture from heat and stir in 1/4 cup white
wine. Pour sauce over chicken in baking dish. Bake in 325-degree
oven about 45 minutes or until chicken is tender and no longer
pink.

N.H. TAKES WARY APPROACH TO GUN CONTROL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHUA _ As Congress struggles to approve gun-control measures
this week, so the state of New Hampshire struggles, too.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential candidates Elizabeth Dole and Al Gore are
advocating tighter gun laws in campaign appearances here. But state
legislators have been stymied this year on a variety of proposals.
</P>
<P>
   If there has been a shift in public opinion about the need for
gun control since the tragedy at Columbine High School in Colorado,
it is not clear that the reverberations are being felt in the
Granite State.
</P>
<P>
   For example, bills to prevent children's access to guns and to
ban large-capacity magazines were defeated in the Senate recently.
</P>
<P>
   A domestic violence bill was greeted by vociferous opposition in
the House because it contained a provision requiring people to
surrender their weapons to police if a temporary restraining order
is pending against them. The bill eventually passed the House and
is pending in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The Gun Owners of New Hampshire, a pro-gun group, has also
opposed a bill to form a commission to examine gun violence and
children. The bill, which calls for a representative from the
organization on the panel, passed the Senate and is pending in the
House.
</P>
<P>
   Dole, the former head of the American Red Cross, said in an
interview that she has been impressed by the positive reception she
has received in New Hampshire and around the country for her
proposals to place child safety locks on guns, to ban assault
weapons, and to outlaw ``cop-killer'' bullets.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a number of people in this state who say `right on,'
'' said Dole, acknowledging New Hampshire's longstanding aversion
to gun restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people in New Hampshire are independent and they
respect the fact that you'll state your views forthrightly and not
shift and change and be inconsistent about what you believe,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Dole is also mindful that many voters here would disagree
with the stand she has taken, and take pains to note that she is
advocating small, not draconian, steps.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have always had a strong belief in the Second Amendment and
the Constitution, but these are things that are reasonable,'' she
said. ``I can't imagine why anybody would need an Uzi or an
AK-47.''
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Gore said he also believes that people here are
more receptive to gun-control measures since the shootings in
Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a sea change,'' Gore said during an interview.
``How many incidents does it take?''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, at the University of New Hampshire's graduation ceremony
last month, the audience of 20,000 cheered when Gore bragged that
he had cast the deciding vote in the Senate to require mandatory
background checks at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   But Paul Young, a Republican political strategist, said it has
not been that long since Democrat Dick Swett lost his House seat
for reneging on a promise to oppose a ban on assault weapons. In
1994, Swett voted for legislation that would bar certain
semiautomatic assault weapons and spent the bulk of his campaign
trying to explain why he broke his promise.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is still a pro-gun state,'' said Young, an adviser to
Republican presidential candidate Steve Forbes. ``There are still a
lot of sportsmen here, there are still quite a few people who live
off the land here.''
</P>
<P>
   State Representative Peter Hoe Burling, the Democratic leader,
said he owns guns and many of his neighbors in Cornish keep guns,
too. But Burling said he has seen a slight modulation in public
opinion over the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This state was totally berserk on the subject of guns,'' he
said. ``People were allowed to have anything up to and including an
atomic cannon to use on their neighbor.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Burling said, he believes New Hampshire voters think that
there are responsibilities that go along with gun ownership, such
as keeping their guns securely locked away from children. But he
said that the public does not want further government regulation.
</P>
<P>
   That is something Representative Steve Vaillancourt, a Democrat
from Manchester, would agree with. Most of the constituents he
hears from are gun owners who oppose regulations. And while people
in other parts of the country are rethinking gun laws in the wake
of Columbine, Vaillancourt said, ``I don't think things will change
as rapidly as in other places.''

CRESCENT CITY BECKONS; WE ANSWER THE CALL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JANET TYSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Brown this, brown that, smothering sauces, nothing
remotely crunchy. And butter, butter everywhere. It doesn't take
too many formulaic creole meals in the Crescent City to remember
why Cajun and nouvelle New Orleans cuisine became and remain so
popular.
</P>
<P>
   Every so often, though, there's something to be said for maxing
out on cholesterol. After all, places such as Commander's Palace
and Galatoire's, Antoine's and Arnaud's have between them centuries
of experience poaching pompano, stirring roux and spiking their
bread pudding.
</P>
<P>
   So it was in a spirit of adventure that my family and I embarked
on three days of traditional creole eating at some venerable
restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   We found ourselves groaning after every meal, too, and
occasionally unimpressed. (Anticipating an overload of expensive
food, we didn't even bother with alcohol.) But we also were excited
by some of the discoveries we made about food that might take all
day to cook. Discoveries about real subtlety and delicacy of
texture, and depth of flavor bordering on unfathomable. About
service at once genial and sober, and dining areas that feel more
like home than anywhere else.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   TUJAGUE'S
</P>
<P>
   You don't hear about Tujague's as often as the others, but it's
New Orleans' second-oldest restaurant. Located near the river, it
was opened in 1856 as a workingman's eatery by a French emigre
butcher named Guillaume Tujague. The lively dining room is
original, and Steven Latter _ only its third familial owner _
offers several vintage dishes.
</P>
<P>
   The set menu opened with shrimp remoulade, in a darkly zesty
sauce on shredded cabbage and lettuce, and ended with a petite
serving of bread pudding, accompanied by coffee served in glasses,
with spoons in to prevent the glass from breaking.
</P>
<P>
   In between, we were treated to creole vegetable soup _ a
Wednesday special _ served in soup plates and replete with chunks
of cabbage, celery, green bell pepper, carrot, onion, potato and
corn. Next came morsels of beef brisket that had been boiled to
make the soup stock.
</P>
<P>
   The standout entree was crawfish Florentine, served in a rich
and musty, slightly yellowish roux (thanks to seasoning with
crawfish fat), chock-full of crustaceans and spinach.

</P>
<P>
   Antoine's you hear about all the time. Founded in 1840, it's the
oldest restaurant in New Orleans and a very classy place. However,
it also can be quite unreliable. My experience there was with a
group from the New Orleans Museum of Art, and we were served from
one of the banquet menus in a cavernous room.
</P>
<P>
   Although I'm sure my host wanted us to have a special
experience, I found it quite ordinary, despite the presence of
several Antoine's specialties, including oysters Rockefeller
(served with pureed green vegetables and not simply spinach) and
oysters Foch (served with a sherry-laced hollandaise sauce).
</P>
<P>
   After the (brownish, perhaps due to overbaking) oysters
Rockefeller and the brown-on-brown-on-brown oysters Foch, I was
ready for something a bit brighter in color, at least, if not in
taste. So, given the choice of seafood gumbo, alligator soup and
crawfish bisque, I took option three.
</P>
<P>
   The creamy plate of soup I envisioned, however, turned out to be
a cup of thick, brown broth dotted with bits of meat. Exasperated,
I sampled my companions' cups of the other two. I discerned no
difference between the crawfish bisque and that seafood gumbo. The
alligator soup varied only in that alligator is tangier than either
of the other two meats.
</P>
<P>
   Another mistake was ordering poached pompano. Instead of a
delicately steamed chunk of fish, lightly sauced, I was served a
parchment pouch filled with oozing sauce, flecked with about seven
bites of fish.

   GALATOIRE'S RESTAURANT
</P>
<P>
   Friday, I was told, is the day New Orleanians with an affinity
for creole food line up in front of Galatoire's, waiting for the
doors to open at 11:30 a.m. We arrived at 11:15 a.m. on that very
day and took our places at the end of the queue. After the doors
opened, we were shown to one of two window tables.
</P>
<P>
   Memories of Brasserie Lipp danced in my head as I looked around
the mirrored room, glowing in a golden light and brimming with
local clientele, who were greeted with warm familiarity. The menu,
too, featured the sort of urbane home cooking that Lipp serves,
although it was creole and not Alsatian.
</P>
<P>
   The obligatory shrimp remoulade, half-portion of oysters
Rockefeller (with spinach), asparagus omelet and broiled snapper
(they were out of pompano) with lump crab meat, and side of
broccoli all were impressive _ cooked perfectly and presented with
understated refinement.
</P>
<P>
   Dessert, however, was an extraordinary experience. Not the
chocolate nut sundae, a satisfying hit with my sons, who had not
been tempted by anything but bread and butter until then. That left
me alone with a modest (but not skimpy) serving of pleasantly
sticky bread pudding, topped with a (rum?) sauce that _ oh my gosh,
oh, oh, oh, yes _ penetrated the depths of my soul.

<P>
   DOOKY CHASE'S
</P>
<P>
   So far, our meals in New Orleans had been of the French creole
variety. For our last dinner there, though, we trekked to Dooky
Chase's _ for legendary African creole cuisine.
</P>
<P>
   The restaurant was established in 1941 by its namesake and his
wife, Leah, who has presided over the kitchen as chef/owner since
her husband's death _ assisted by her son, Dooky Jr. We ate early
on Saturday evening, well before dinner hour and _ perhaps because
the kitchen was quiet _ Leah Chase came out to greet the handful of
diners. She stopped at our table, chatted a bit, teased the boys
and promised that she would make them up some complimentary shrimp
and French fries.
</P>
<P>
   She did, and they didn't eat it. So I did _ along with Dooky's
special seafood platter _ an encyclopedic selection of tidbits,
delicately breaded _ a side of sweet potatoes and steamed rice, my
share of the shrimp remoulade, a cup of pea soup, a glass of
chardonnay, some of my husband's slightly oily seafood gumbo and a
dessert of praline pudding.
</P>
<P>
   It was all so good, apart from my husband's cheesecake _ like
mediocre store-bought _ that I didn't mind spending the rest of the
evening in a state of extreme discomfort.
</P>

   Night owls and cable subscribers know the spiels by heart. A
facile salesman dices, schmoozes, peels and cajoles. He's selling
the answer to your prayers _ one miracle machine that transforms
you from cooking goof to culinary genius with one simple payment on
your credit card. But is he a snake-oil salesman or a messiah?
Here's what we found.

   What I say: A man must have invented this product. It's
superfluous in any home with a twist tie or plastic storage boxes.
Strike No. 1 _ the sealer is powered with batteries, an idea that
chills parents. Strike No. 2 _ an electric adapter is also
included, destined for the junk drawer.
</P>
<P>
   If you press the Eurosealer too tightly or too long, it melts
the bag. And it doesn't do anything that something far easier to
use, like a plastic clip, does quicker. Give it two years and there
will be a Eurosealer at every other American garage sale.
Particularly garage sales at homes outfitted with satellite dishes.

   This hand-operated setup is a combination food
processor-mandolin that handily chops onions and garlic, nicely
shreds carrots and even whips cream.
</P>
<P>
   But wait _ there's more! An egg separator is also included.
</P>
<P>
   Even for households with a food processor, this is a useful
addition. It's great to have on hand when you need to do a little
slicing and dicing but don't want to lug out the heavy electric

the job halfway. The gadget does cut the fruit away from the peel

FENWAY PLANNERS OF TODAY SHOULD REMEMBER OLMSTED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One major witness in the case of Fenway Park influenced its
development more than Babe Ruth, Bucky Dent, or Willie Tasby. When
Frederick Law Olmsted, an American genius, planned the nearby Fens,
he succeeded in his aim to provide ``Turf, trees, water, and other
natural objects, unnaturally arranged but not in the main
unpleasingly.''
</P>
<P>
   Olmsted would admire the proposed right-field facade because it
restores a nearby street as a major boulevard. As for inside the
park, he always liked ``a simple, broad, open space of clean
greensward.''
</P>
<P>
   Excessive reverence for ``The Green Monster,'' a name for the
park's left-field wall since 1975, might puzzle Olmsted, although
he understood how grandiose titles grow. The wall was just the wall
before Carlton Fisk willed a home run over it one October night.
What many now call ``the Emerald Necklace'' was to Olmsted a
logical and utilitarian series of sewers and drainage projects from
the Muddy and Charles Rivers to Stony Brook, Jamaica Pond, and
Franklin Park.
</P>
<P>
   Farsighted about change and growth, Olmsted said in 1870, ``It
is practically certain that the Boston of today is the mere nucleus
of the Boston that is to be. It is practically certain that it is
to extend over many miles of country now thoroughly rural in
character.''
</P>
<P>
   By 1878, Olmsted was at the zenith of landscape architecture,
having designed, with Calvert Vaux, New York's Central Park and
Prospect Park in Brooklyn. Boston's parks commission asked him to
plan 106 acres reclaimed from fetid swamps. ``Back Bay,'' now a
byword for elegance, was then, Olmsted said, ``a gulf of mud and
water.''
</P>
<P>
   On April 2, 1886, Olmsted told the Boston Society of Architects
how the Fens, where the Muddy meets the Charles, was crucial to his
plan. He worked with the superintendent of sewers and the city
engineer, Joseph Phineas Davis, who told him, ``If the state of
Massachusetts had been hunted over, a space combining more
disadvantages for a park could not have been found.''
</P>
<P>
   The conduits, channels, and causeways he designed would stretch
5 miles by 1886, from the Fens to Franklin Park, which Olmsted
considered ``of greater lasting consequence to the city than those
of other of its public works at the present time.'' As one who
spent a childhood equidistant from and happily infesting both, I
agree that Franklin Park will always be Boston's focus of freedom
and variety, far more important than Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   Olmsted thought the short Boylston Street bridge over the Fens
``the most conspicuous object in all the scheme.'' He asked his
friend, Henry Hobson Richardson, the architect of Trinity Church,
to design it. The Massachusetts Historical Society and St.
Clement's Shrine stand as grand sentinels before Richardson's
bridge of Cape Ann granite.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the Fens, Boylston's planned grandeur
yields to unplanned junk. In 1982, Cynthia Zaitzevsky wrote in
``Frederick Law Olmsted and the Boston Park System,'' that ``The
Fens is a rather peculiar collection of spaces that appear to be
connected entirely by accident.''
</P>
<P>
   With a revived Sears building breathing retail life into a
campus of colleges and hospitals, a new ballpark will make Boylston
a grand entrance and stabilize what Olmsted once called ``an
unhealthy and pestilential neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   Olmsted avoided cliches. The new ballpark does not. Preserving
the old wall and the infield is a generous gesture, but reproducing
it is a hackneyed impulse that will hurt the home team. Over the
current wall, a real city looms. The new one will squat underneath
the ultimate cliche, a gee-whiz billboard-scoreboard.
</P>
<P>
   The left-field wall protected Fenway Park from the soot and
noise of the Boston &AMP; Albany Railroad, now long gone. Olmsted would
have seen no organic sense in enshrining an obsolete artifact. The
man who mastered nature for Boston's benefit was always more
practical than romantic.

CITIES TARGET GUN MAKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is an honest desperation about the lawsuits being filed
against gun makers by Boston and 19 other cities. There was no
alternative as Congress plays the hit man for the National Rifle
Association.
</P>
<P>
   As Congress agonizes over the most minor of gun restrictions and
clatters in abject cowardice over sweeping gun control, the mayors
got the message that NRA money still means more in Washington, even
in its somewhat devalued state after the Littleton schoolyard
massacre, than spilled blood, spent medical resources, and
traumatized neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Even with Littleton, the mayors faced an indefinite state of
abandonment. So it should have been no surprise that when the NRA
went ahead with its convention in Denver this spring, despite the
events in Littleton, loudest protest came from Denver Mayor
Wellington Webb. Despite the $18 million the convention was said to
be worth to the city, Webb said, ``We don't want you here.''
</P>
<P>
   Webb's fellow mayors are saying likewise. Over the last nine
months cities that include Chicago, Miami, New Orleans, Atlanta,
Los Angeles, Detroit, San Francisco, and Bridgeport, Conn., have
filed suit. Some of the suits stress the aspect of public nuisance.
Others stress the issue of product liability and unfair business
practices. So far, Chicago has made the biggest monetary claim _
$435 million.
</P>
<P>
   Boston joined the list last week, filing suit against 31 gun
manufacturers. Boston accuses gunmakers of being a public nuisance,
using reckless marketing practices that make guns far too easy to
be purchased by youths and criminals. The city calculates that from
1993 to 1998, the resulting gunfire cost $100 million in deaths,
injuries, and lower tax revenues from neighborhoods where such
violence shot down property values.
</P>
<P>
   Boston, like many cities, filed the suit with a notable defiance
despite going where no higher layer of government has gone before
against the NRA. In Chicago, Mayor Richard M. Daley said, ``This is
just the beginning.'' In Los Angeles, city attorney James Hahn
declared the LA suit to be ``a pretty big stick.'' In Bridgeport,
Mayor Joseph Gamin said, ``We are saying to the gun industry, `From
now on, you are responsible for the costs associated with your
dangerous products.' ''
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, Peter Welsh, the director of policy and planning for
Mayor Thomas M. Menino, said, ``We don't intend to lose, we're
entering this to win.''
</P>
<P>
   What remains for Boston and the other cities to determine is the
definition of victory. Whether it is Boston's $100 million or
Chicago's $435 million, most of the suing mayors are smart enough
to say that this is not about money alone, but about accessibility
to guns and forcing gun makers to make guns more ``safe,'' with
reliable locking mechanisms.
</P>
<P>
   That is a positive step and the cities have a good chance at
forcing change on those fronts. The gun industry, while quite
lethal, does not have the deep pockets to defend itself constantly
in court state by state. Without the deep pockets, the industry has
already shown a willingness to compromise with government officials
on minor gun restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   The industry's compromises have caused a rift with the NRA,
which views every gun restriction as the next coming of communism.
</P>
<P>
   But minor restrictions are not enough to gain victory for the
citizens. It is unclear if the suits, while properly speaking to
the reckless marketing of guns, can do anything to blunt the actual
production of guns, as well as their trafficking from gun-happy
states such as Georgia, Texas, and Virginia to the more congested,
gun-shy states of the North.
</P>
<P>
   It is particularly unclear what a victory in Boston or
Bridgeport will ultimately mean, if a similar measure fails to get
out of the starting gate in, say, Georgia, where the NRA has
already gotten the state Legislature to pass a law banning Atlanta
from pursuing its suit against the gun makers.
</P>
<P>
   If the gun makers are not cutting production, the guns will
still go to the states of least resistance, which surely will
become the states that pay the least attention to out-of-state
sales. Boston may have named Smith and Wesson, only two hours away
in Springfield in its suit, but there is nothing Boston can do to
stop Smith and Wesson to flood another city on the ``I-95
pipeline,'' a pipeline that was a deadly boomerang for Boston
earlier this decade.
</P>
<P>
   The boomerang of bullets will stop only with national gun
control. Eventually, the lawsuits have to become either so
voluminous and unified as to create a wall of legal resistance to
guns, or they have to wreak so much havoc on the conscience of
politicians that the states, Congress, and the White House stop the
cowardly clatter and create national controls.
</P>
<P>
   No one else has yet gotten the nation's politicians to pay
attention to the spilled blood, the spent emergency resources, and
the traumatized neighborhoods. The mayors might as well try. But
victory cannot be theirs city by city. They will win only if their
suits get the governors, House representatives, senators and the
president to say to the NRA, ``We don't want you here.''

GOING OFF THE DEEP END 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For years, I was unable to talk about my pool problems. It was
like suffering from a rare neurological disorder that affected only
rich people. Pool owners are to be mocked, envied perhaps.
Definitely exploited with false bonhomie during heat waves. But not
sympathized with.
</P>
<P>
   Then I became a pool owner. It wasn't my fault. We bought a
house; it had a pool. The previous owner, a dermatologist (or was
it a plastic surgeon?) built it. Naturally, the real estate broker
didn't mention the pool in the listing, because then anyone who had
ever owned a pool wouldn't have answered the ad.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of size _ mine is the proverbial whole 9 yards long,
and about 10 feet wide _ pools are enormous, costly headaches. To
prevent the water from turning a spinachy green requires
Nobel-level chemistry skills. And the chemicals are expensive.
Baking soda costs about a dollar a box at the supermarket. But when
transformed into ``Pool Balance Plus'' and packaged under a bright,
sunshiney label, sodium carbonate costs five times as much.
</P>
<P>
   About three years ago, I finally conquered my pool-related class
anxiety. I was sipping garage coffee with the guys who fix my car
and heard them kvetching about their pools! Their complaints were
the same as mine: ``I can't get the Ph to balance''; ``The spring
on my skimmer weir is jammed''; or: ``Is it a hygiene problem if
you find a drowned squirrel in the outtake line?'' (Yes).
</P>
<P>
   The scales fell from my eyes. If these regular joes could
complain about their pools, so could I! I subsequently learned that
I needn't have been so shy. I am one of about 250,000 Bay State
pool owners. Indeed, we are the third most pool-owning state in the
union, trailing only Florida and Arizona. Aside from my mechanics,
I don't know anyone who owns a pool, but, theoretically, they're
out there.
</P>
<P>
   And they are complaining. Because once you start, you never
stop. The first summer I owned the pool, I resolved to ``do the
chemistry'' myself. How hard could it be? These pool maintenance
guys weren't exactly Mensa fodder. The pool chemistry tests are a
lot like home pregnancy tests, except instead of bodily fluids, you
pour a few drops of pool water into reagent-treated plastic
beakers. Whatever was supposed to happen never happened for me. I
wasted bucketfuls of chemicals, languished in self-loathing, and
eventually begged the service guys to handle the job for me.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the cruel fact: Pools are fine as long as you don't put
anything in them. New England's acid rain throws off the chemistry.
Every species of wildlife seeks out your pool for its gory,
waterlogged Viking suicide ritual. Except frogs, of course; for
them you've created the northern part of heaven: a cool, snake-free
environment. Kids love' em! Wives, not so much.
</P>
<P>
   But the worst thing to put in your pool is people. Perspiration,
those skin oils, foot dirt _ yuck! As soon as my sons and their
hot-weather friends get out, two buckets of chlorine go in.
Otherwise, that wispy algae peach fuzz starts to _ well, you really
don't want to know.
</P>
<P>
   If you think pool owners complain a lot, you should hear my pool
service people. They hate pool work because it's hot and sweaty,
and they miss their real profession _ that of ski bum. They
complain about their boss because he's exploiting them as seasonal
labor. And they hate me because I own a pool.
</P>
<P>
   Their boss has become a friend of mine, and he complains
constantly, about his workers, about his subcontractors, about his
clients. As far as I can tell, all his other clients are rich jerks
who make his life miserable if their pool isn't open by Memorial
Day. I'm not rich; maybe my pool will be ready to use by July
Fourth.
</P>
<P>
   I know. You're like everybody else. You don't want to hear me
complain. You just want to come over and use my pool.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The red carpet, the ermine robe, and the sceptre of the
conquering Caesar are being readied for the triumphal arrival of
His Excellency and Omnipotency, the Great &AMP; Exalted Guv'nah of
Texas, George W. Bush, who rolls into New Hampshire on Monday like
Julius into Gaul.
</P>
<P>
   So lopsided is this front-runner's bandwagon that his handlers
better steer carefully round the bends. ``George W.'' as the
insiders call this son-of to distinguish him from the father-of,
hasn't trod New Hampshire soil for a Biblical span of seven years,
it's said. But he's way out front of the presidential pack.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's early success has cast a pall over all other candidacies,
but none has been eclipsed more than that of Lamar Alexander, the
second-time-around Tennessean. The conventional wisdom has
Alexander croaking as Bush approaches the starting gate. The early
reviews have Lamar expiring. Why?
</P>
<P>
   From lack of a) oxygen (George W.'s frontrunning effort has
sucked the oxygen out of the water, says one theory); b) money
(Bush's endorsement-rich campaign harvests $1,000 checks like a
grain combine); c) ideological edge (Forbes, Buchanan, and Dan
Quayle fight over the bigger chunks of GOP red meat, while Bauer,
Keyes, and New Hampshire Senator Bob Smith wrangle over the
abortion scraps); or d) identity crisis (Bush is the guy for
Republicans who are tired of losing, Senator John McCain is the one
with the gutsy policy positions both foreign and domestic, and
Elizabeth Dole is gambling there's a softer-gentler conservatism
out there).
</P>
<P>
   The conventional wisdom is that Alexander, a former Tennessee
governor and US education secretary, is too bland, too blah, too
plaid, too plodding, too folksy, too earnest. He hasn't ``caught
on'' with the voters, pollsters, pundits, the public in general.
Not one but two Globe colleagues needled me this week about my
periodic prognostications, going back four years now, that
Alexander should be taken seriously.
</P>
<P>
   His money flow is crimped, his campaign staff has suffered
resignations and reshuffles, the Bush ascendancy has blighted his
prospects, and he lacks the ideological zealotry that is attracted
by Forbes's cash, Buchanan's incendiary rhetoric, or the fractions
of right-wing activism sliced by the fringe candidates.
</P>
<P>
   A Manchester Union Leader editorial this week consigned
Alexander's candidacy from the ER to intensive care. I see
Alexander as wounded and laboring, but far from out of business.
Busloads of journalists will trail in his front-runner's wake.
Expectations could not be higher for Bush, or lower for Lamar.
</P>
<P>
   One veteran New Hampshire handicapper, former Globe colleague
John Milne, says, ``Everyone is waiting for Bush. Alexander's money
dried up, as Bush surged. I think Lamar falls between the
Republicans who just want a winner _ they're with Bush _ and the
true believers, who lined up with the more conservative types like
Quayle.''
</P>
<P>
   Milne says Alexander's embrace of the education issue misfired
in New Hampshire. ``New Hampshire believes schooling should be as
local as you can make it, not federal. Lamar seems to be remaking
himself as he came back the second time. If they want a
conservative, they'll go for a real one, like Buchanan.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexander's fate now hinges on Bush faltering. John McCain has
staked out the high-risk positions: for ground troops in Kosovo,
against Big Tobacco, for campaign finance reform in the party whose
congressional majorities depend upon fighting it, and taking on the
telecommunications lobbies. But Alexander is the conventional
Republican's fallback candidate if Bush cracks.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Rath, Alexander's top hand in New Hampshire, says the GOP
delegate-selection process ``is so front-loaded, a front-runner has
no chance to recover'' if he or she stumbles badly. The key ``is to
hunker down, cut spending, stay in this thing. On the ground, in
Iowa and New Hampshire, we're better than anybody else.'' Alexander
raised only $2 million this year, and has cut paid staff from 38 to
34, concentrating everything on Iowa and New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Rath likens his role to a sort of Casey Jones on a slowing-down
locomotive, ``We've run out of coal, and we're having to break up
the furniture to toss the wood in the firebox.'' It's the Bush
advantage over Al Gore in early matchups that dominate the
Republican race today, he avers.
</P>
<P>
   I cannot discount the low-single-digit poll readings registered
by Alexander's effort to date; plaid, sad, and bad, those numbers
don't lie. But Lamar is the best-organized candidate in the first
two states. He got 40 percent of the Republicans who made up their
minds in the last week of the New Hampshire campaign last time. He
ain't dead yet. If he catches a break here or there, if Bush
falters, Lamar is a factor again.
</P>
<P>
   Five of the 11 Republicans running have never been elected to
any public office; that's Elizabeth Dole, Steve Forbes, Pat
Buchanan, Gary Bauer, and Alan Keyes. While nobody thinks Bauer or
Keyes is out for anything but exercise, the Dole, Forbes, and
Buchanan candidacies are treated seriously by the media.
</P>
<P>
   For Forbes, Buchanan, Quayle, Bauer, Smith, and Keyes, my bet is
the only way any of them will be taking the federal oath in January
2001, will be if they're called to jury duty.

PRIEST REBUTS SKEPTICAL ASSESSMENT OF NEW TESTAMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After nearly 2,000 years, Jesus continues to fuel raging debates
among scholars seeking to illuminate the life of the rebel Jew who
has shaped much of our history.
</P>
<P>
   At the cusp of the third millennium, publishing houses have been
churning out a steady stream of books devoted to revealing the
``historical'' Jesus, the facts about his life.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, trying to paint a biographical sketch of the man
Christians regard as the Messiah is a sure way to provoke
controversy.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Jerome Murphy-O'Connor, a Dominican priest, has spent
more than three decades studying the Bible hoping to gain insights
into the life and times of Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   A respected and internationally known scholar, Murphy-O'Connor
welcomes the critical study of Scripture and the effort to provide
as complete a record of Jesus's life as possible.
</P>
<P>
   But during a recent visit to Boston he took issue with the work
of the ``Jesus Seminar,'' a group of scholars that has gained
widespread attention for challenging the veracity of some of the
New Testament accounts of Jesus's ministry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Jesus Seminar folks treat Scripture as defendants in a
trial with a very bad record,'' Murphy-O'Connor said during a
lecture last week at St. Ignatius Church at Boston College. ``The
burden of proof lies with the text. No 2,000-year-old text could
ever stand up to that kind of scrutiny.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jesus Seminar, Murphy-O'Connor said in an interview, has
``duped'' the media, in part, by promoting its findings at
Christmas and Easter, two times when the media are keenly
interested in religion stories.
</P>
<P>
   The popularity of the Jesus Seminar has generated a backlash,
with scholars such as Murphy-O'Connor refuting some of the
seminar's findings.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy-O'Connor is a professor of the New Testament at the
prestigious Ecole Biblique in Jerusalem and the author of numerous
books, including ``The Holy Land,'' a best-selling archeological
guide-book of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy-O'Connor's approach to the Bible is more positive than
that of the scholars of the Jesus Seminar. ``The text should be
treated as a witness who is basically trying to tell the truth,''
he said during his lecture.
</P>
<P>
   One important source of contention regarding Jesus's life is the
crucial role played by the fishermen who followed Jesus. Some
scholars dismiss them as unreliable sources of information because
they were lower-class people who would be expected to exaggerate
accounts of Jesus to elevate their status.
</P>
<P>
   But Murphy-O'Connor disagrees, arguing that the fishermen were
actually astute middle-class businessmen. As evidence he says the
fishermen had employees and they moved their fishing operations to
another town on the banks of the Galilee to avoid taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``These were not, as some people believe, some wandering
religious nuts who would have followed anyone,'' Murphy-O'Connor
said. `They were unlikely to make up stuff and certainly not if it
would have gotten them into trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   A key focus of Murphy-O'Connor's lecture revolved around Jesus's
time in Galilee, a critical turning point in his life. It was
there, Murphy-O'Connor said, that Jesus experienced his second
conversion _ the first occurred when he was baptized by John the
prophet.
</P>
<P>
   When he arrived in Galilee, Jesus came to sympathize with the
plight of shepherds, a class of people Jewish law considered
sinners. But Jesus believed people were forced to become shepherds
because of economic circumstances and they needed to provide for
their families.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time, Murphy-O'Connor said, that Jesus
challenged Jewish law and it began the course that led to his
crucifixion.

PREACHING ABOUT POETRY; TACTILE LINES FROM IRELAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

HOW TO READ A POEM 
And Fall in Love With Poetry 
By Edward Hirsch 
Harcourt Brace, 352 pp., $23 
 
SELECTED POEMS 
By Michael Longley 
Wake Forest University Press, 132 pp., $12.95 (paper) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Almost 60 years ago, the University of Chicago sage Mortimer
Adler published ``How to Read a Book,'' in which he declared, ``The
most direct sign that you have done the work of reading is fatigue.
Reading that is reading involves the most intense mental activity.
To read books passively does not feed a mind. It makes
blotting-paper out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Fatigue, however, is not a sensation associated with MacArthur
fellow Edward Hirsch's ``How to Read a Poem.'' ``Reading poetry,''
he says, ``is an adventure in renewal, a creative act, a perpetual
beginning, a rebirth of wonder.'' In other words, passion is the
key to understanding poetry, along with ``adventure,'' creativity,
``wonder.'' Hirsch, who is certainly well intentioned and armed
with insightful commentary on individual poems, seeks to enlarge
poetry's audience. He seems reluctant to admit that certain poems
have a formal structure as complex as calculus.
</P>
<P>
   His problems begin with his title. Falling in love with poetry
suggests the emotional approach he prefers, the romantic notion
that reading poetry has a redemptive quality. Perhaps; but people
rarely fall in love on an analytical basis. Do we read poetry
because it is good for us? The inseparability of form and matter in
a poem does not lead to virtue but to the pleasure of recognition.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings up the question, for whom is this book intended? It
opens with a trenchant discussion of figurative language and the
transaction that occurs between poet and reader. Hirsch, citing the
Russian poet Osip Mandelstam, sees poetry as ``a message in a
bottle'' washed onshore to be discovered by the reader, ``its
secret addressee.'' He celebrates his own lyrical responses to
poetry, and there's nothing wrong with that _ only his hortatory
tone reminds one of a vibrant teacher attempting to convey the
importance of Whitman, Dickinson, and Auden to the back row of a
class occupied by students sunk in a torpor.
</P>
<P>
   Hirsch is at his best when he reveals by example the layers of
meaning of Sylvia Plath's ``Edge,'' Elizabeth Bishop's ``In the
Waiting Room,'' Christopher Smart's jubilant ``My Cat Jeoffrey.''
Readers of poetry, though, are usually familiar with the hurdles he
guides us over. The question lingers: Has Hirsch really increased
poetry's audience? One suspects, alas, that obvious intelligence
and rhapsodic feeling won't do, and that, notwithstanding an
attractively designed format and a useful glossary of poetic
conventions, his book is another case of preaching to the
converted.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Michael Longley is probably the least publicized of the northern
writers _ Seamus Heaney and Derek Mahon among others _ who
revitalized Irish poetry during the '60s. A rare melodic clarity
characterizes Longley's lines, and ``Selected Poems,'' now
available in paperback, is notable for its classic restraint.
</P>
<P>
   In Belfast, where he makes his home (his wife, Edna, is a
well-known literary critic), Longley has been actively involved in
literary and arts council programs. His poetry exhibits the shadows
of a 20-year period of social upheaval _ ``Wreaths,'' for example,
etches miniature portraits of innocent people murdered in mundane
surroundings _ but he also achieves substance through metaphor and
imagery derived from nature. Landscapes are vividly tactile: He is
a poet of tender, fleeting observations _ the crushed blossom, the
foam-flecked wave, the darting minnow. And sometimes his language
has the timeless character of a Chinese scroll, as in ``Out
There'':

<P>
   BOSTON _ Sitting with 16 relatives and friends in her small East
Boston apartment, her eyes locked on the television set,
34-year-old Sharon Tiso could contain herself no longer. After all,
a 500-pound mountain of a professional wrestler known as The Big
Show had just lifted World Wrestling Federation owner Vince McMahon
off the ground like a lumpy sack of potatoes. And as Tiso and
millions of other viewers knew well, McMahon is the bitter enemy of
Stone Cold Steve Austin, wrestling's nihilist Texas glamour guy,
because he doesn't much care for Austin's attitude.
</P>
<P>
   So what's a mother to do, especially one who's a Stone Cold
Steve Austin adulator?
</P>
<P>
   ``Drop him!'' Tiso shouted at The Big Show as he hoisted McMahon
skyward. ``Drop him!''
</P>
<P>
   Whereupon Tiso's 11-year-old daughter, Darcie Philbrook, looked
across the room and frowned. ``Mom,'' the girl said softly, ``it's
a TV.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's more than a TV to more mothers than you might think. Of
the 8 million to 10 million viewers who tune in the WWF and its
rival, World Championship Wrestling, on cable television each week,
nearly one in four are women 18 and over. True, if you walk into
Boston's FleetCenter or the Worcester Centrum Centre on any night
when one of these resurgent wrestling circuses is in town, you'll
see plenty of teenagers and pre-teens, especially boys.
</P>
<P>
   But you'll also notice that many of these kids are accompanied
by women who are a generation older and who are similarly decked
out in the likes of ``Expect No Mercy'' T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   In a word: Mom.
</P>
<P>
   We're not talking soccer moms cruising the suburbs in
leather-appointed Volvos here. And we're not talking hockey moms
huddled in drafty rinks. We're talking wrestling moms shrieking
wildly at shows that are laced with blaring music, flashy
pyrotechnics, flying chairs, and sexual innuendo. These are women
who adore or abhor wrestlers named like strippers (Sexual
Chocolate, Nitro Girls), rock bands (New Age Outlaws, Warrior), and
comic book characters (Konnan, Viscera). They are women who know a
good body slam when they see one on television and who don't mind
getting up at the crack of dawn for the privilege of watching the
action in person.
</P>
<P>
   That's what 38-year-old Mildred Garcia was doing at 6 a.m. one
recent Saturday morning. Garcia and her 15-year-old son, Jose,
hailed a taxi outside their Boston home and headed for the
FleetCenter, the better to be at the box office almost four hours
before it opened. When tickets for an upcoming WWF extravaganza
went on sale later that morning, mother and son wouldn't have
dreamt of being anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   Mildred Garcia remembers growing up in a home where wrestlers
such as Andre the Giant and Bruno Sammartino made mayhem on TV
while her father watched. She didn't pay much attention. But when
her son began bringing home wrestling magazines and action figures
some 25 years later, she stopped to notice. One of the things that
makes today's ring vaudevillians different from those of the past
is the complexity of the murky soap operas in which they star. Will
The Undertaker, a.k.a. The Lord of Darkness, succeed in his wicked
attempts to wreak havoc in the WWF through his evil Corporate
Ministry? And over at WCW, will crazed Ric Flair be freed from a
mental institution in order to fight flamboyant Diamond Dallas
Page, a.k.a. DDP, for the title?
</P>
<P>
   (One dark turn that wasn't scripted was last month's death of
WWF wrestler Owen Hart, who died in an accidental fall in front of
16,200 spectators in Kansas City, Mo. The show, however, went on.)
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, the plots make it interesting,'' explains Garcia, who
watches televised wrestling at least two nights a week and doesn't
miss a WWF appearance in Boston. ``Like, if Stone Cold is going to
wrestle The Undertaker, by the time they fight there's a whole
story going on. It keeps me involved.'' (But it does not, alas,
interest Garcia's husband, Max. ``He's a boxing fan,'' she shrugs.)
</P>
<P>
   There's another way in which Mildred Garcia's pro wrestling
differs from the video grappling her father watched. The 1990s
world of slickly produced SuperBrawls and Slamborees features a
cast of raunchy characters, many of whom _ especially in WWF _
swill booze, holler obscenities, and operate at a level of
theatrical sexuality that tiptoes the line between the suggestive
and the explicit. Whereas Walter ``Killer'' Kowalksi used his
feared ``claw hold'' to latch onto opponents from the 1950s through
the 1970s, several of  &UR; today &LR; 's wrestlers seem more intent on
grabbing themselves _ often by the crotch.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Tiso admits that some of this stuff bothers her,
especially when she's watching it roll off the TV screen while in
the company of Darcie and her other child, 6-year-old Jerry. ``My
kids are not allowed to yell some of the things these wrestlers
yell and they're not allowed to make some of the gestures these
wrestlers make,'' says Tiso, who works as a cashier. ``Of course,
they can do it behind my back. But it's like I tell them, `If
you're doing it behind my back, you better hope I never find out.'
''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Kennedy, a loan processor who lives in South Boston, takes
the subway to WWF matches with her 12-year-old son, Matthew. Yes,
she concedes, much of what WWF offers isn't particularly fit for
kids. But no, she says, she doesn't want to leave Matthew behind.
``He's bought all these wrestling toys,'' she says, referring to
the plethora of action figures that make up only a small part of a
vast wrestling merchandise mart that includes everything from
temporary tattoos to leather jackets. ``Besides, they're all
talking about wrestling in school. Society rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Although it's often said that most folks would rather admit to
stealing than to liking professional wrestling, wrestling moms tend
to be unapologetic about their fandom. Stacey Frascone of South
Easton, the 26-year-old mother of two young boys, eagerly describes
WCW as ``a soap opera with wrestling in it.'' If friends tease
Frascone _ a former California high school cheerleader and kick
boxer who owns an assortment of wrestling T-shirts _ about her
passion, she doesn't much care. ``I say, `Hey, this is what I'm
interested in,' '' she says. ``And it's something I can do with my
sons that's sports-oriented. They watch football with their father,
but I'm not interested in football.''
</P>
<P>
   These are decidedly good times for pro wrestling, which hasn't
had a network television contract since the early 1990s, when it
suffered a belly-flop following an '80s boom. This time around,
however, it has grown into a superstar of cable TV, including
pay-per-view. Old wrestlers, it seems, never die; they just get
reborn. (Hulk Hogan, a WWF 1980s good guy, is now ``Hollywood''
Hulk Hogan, a WCW bad guy.) Either that or they become the governor
of a state (Jesse ``The Body'' Ventura of Minnesota).
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the endless debate about whether the matches are
``real'' doesn't seem to matter much to wrestling moms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's pretend,'' says Tiso. ``It's entertainment. But .
. . they can still make me mad. Even though I know it's all
preplanned, all part of a show, they can make me mad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like, I really dislike The Rock. Because I saw a match he had
with Mankind, and Mankind was bleeding. Really bleeding. Well, I
don't think you do that kind of thing. So I don't like The Rock at
all.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there is another reason to enjoy the sweating,
overacting behemoths of pro wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want me to be honest with you?'' asks Danielle Thibeault
of Whitman, a 28-year-old mom with five kids and, like her mother
before her, a hard-core wrestling fan. ``I like them because of
their looks.''

JACKSON AND HOLLYWOOD; GIRL POWER; GENDER CHOICES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CYNTHIA DOCKRELL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This was going to be a ``Star Wars''-free column, but Samuel L.
Jackson's Jedi role has earned him cover stories in two current
magazines. Face it, the menace is with us.
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully, Jackson's part in this movie is simply an excuse to
take a look at where the actor has been and where he's going. He's
profiled at length in the June edition of Icon as well as in a new
monthly, Code, which bills itself as ``the style magazine for men
of color.'' (``Style'' is the key word here; imagine a deeper shade
of GQ.)
</P>
<P>
   Both stories emphasize Jackson's ascendancy in Hollywood in
recent years. Whereas he used to get parts rejected by Denzel
Washington or Wesley Snipes, now, thanks largely to his
performances in ``Jungle Fever'' and ``Pulp Fiction,'' he's the guy
directors go to first.
</P>
<P>
   Not that his choices are without controversy. As Icon's Evan
Wiener writes: ``If you want to keep working (and golfing) in
Hollywood, you have to play by some of the town rules. If you're a
black actor and you've established yourself playing a crackhead and
a killer, that means you're going to be playing lots of variations
on crackheads and killers. And you're going to be dealing with all
the antagonism that comes with that territory.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson does not apologize for the gun-toting roles that some
critics say reinforce a white-America stereotype about black men.
While he does take part occasionally in lower-budget fare such as
the new ``Red Violin,'' Jackson makes no bones about wanting the
big-bang roles that pay. Given his solid acting background in
everything from theater to commercials, and a yearslong drug habit
that's finally been vanquished, you can hardly blame him.

   Last September, Outside magazine launched its sister
publication, Women Outside. It was planned as a quarterly, but here
it is June and the second issue has just come out. The editors
promise to have a third installment on the stands by September, and
they claim to have a committed editorial team that will keep this
thing going. We'll see.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the summer issue has every bit as much girl power _ and
I don't mean that figuratively _ as its predecessor. A whole range
of physical courage is displayed here. Women hang glide, they run
100 miles at a clip and still have time for their kids, they skirt
snakes and flesh-eating bacteria in the Amazon just to study a
vine. Looking at photos of wildwater kayakers and rock climbers
hanging like bats above Morocco, I got to wondering if I was really
the same gender as these people.
</P>
<P>
   Not all the stories star Wonder Women (good thing _ readers for
whom such adventures could never be a reality may be lost readers).
Some of the features are general enough to have appeared in any
number of magazines. One, about the demand for echinacea, raises
alarms.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years this plant has been so widely touted as an
herbal cold remedy that the Great Plains, where it grows wild, have
been virtually stripped. Writes Daniel Glick, one witness
``described hillsides so pockmarked with shovel holes that it
seemed like a passel of prairie dogs had held a drunken frat party
on the plains.'' Poachers and others who've smelled the money to be
made in this business have contributed to what environmentalists
see as an eco-disaster: Like dominoes, other species of plants and
animals may fall into extinction. There is a complex social
component to this story, too, as Native American tribes contend
with the conflicting interests of making money and preserving
what's left of their land and culture.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, this article will make you think twice about
reaching for an herbal remedy next time you visit the drugstore.
Echinacea is just one plant in our burgeoning arsenal of
alternative medications. How many others are we killing off?
</P>

   Since the civil rights movement gave every minority the right to
stand up and be counted, few have failed to do so. But one group
has been so profoundly misunderstood that it has stayed hidden
until now.
</P>
<P>
   In the May/June Lingua Franca, Emily Nussbaum offers a
fascinating report on hermaphroditism, a broad term for ambiguous
gender. Intersexuals, as they are known, are born with neither
overtly male nor overtly female genitals; most often they have
characteristics of both sexes. Traditionally doctors have operated
on these babies soon after birth, making them into either boys or
girls (usually girls, since that's easier), and then no one outside
the infants' families is the wiser. But in the last few years, many
intersexuals have come forward to protest what they see as
butchery. Making one's genitals conform to this or that sex, they
say, doesn't necessarily make them any good.
</P>
<P>
   Many intersexuals believe that children like them should be left
alone to grow up ambiguously and entrusted with the decision to
become wholly male or female later on. Not surprisingly, most
doctors disagree with this position, in large part because of the
social complications. As Nussbaum quotes one physician who has
worked with intersexual kids, ``What are you going to say, `Boys
get in this line, girls get in that line, and all the little
hermaphrodites get in this other line'?''
</P>
<P>
   No one pretends to have answers to questions like this, but at
least intersexuals are beginning to shed their shame.

AN INDUSTRY RUSHES TO REGENERATE 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fifteen years after America's telephone monopoly was broken into
eightpieces, the US telecommunications industry is caught up in
such a mad rush to merge back into an ever-smaller number of giants
that it might be fair to wonder: Why did we ever bust up AT&AMP;T?
</P>
<P>
   The original seven Baby Bells will soon be down to four, and
most are launching their own megadeals to become national and
international powerhouses. The old Southwest Bell will soon range
from Connecticut and Ohio to California, Bell Atlantic (which
absorbed Nynex two summers ago) is merging early next year with
local and long-distance provider GTE, and U S West is pursuing a
complex marriage with international cable owner Global Crossing and
local provider Frontier.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T, meanwhile, is buying cable TV companies such as TCI and
MediaOne, spending $130 billion to own a wire into two-thirds of US
homes in hopes of once again becoming your local carrier. All signs
indicate the industry will only further consolidate to a handful of
huge players.
</P>
<P>
   It's enough to make some people who still rue the demise of
``the phone company'' wonder whether all the disruption and
confusion they have faced have really been worth it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I'm kind of rooting for AT&AMP;T to come back and be in
charge of everything,'' said Les Hallenack, a semi-retired software
consultant in Watertown, Mass., who still thinks Ma Bell should
have been better regulated, not separated.
</P>
<P>
   Two of Hallenack's pet peeves are the endless string of numbers
he must dial to make a charge-card call on a pay phone, and the
dozen pieces of junk mail he gets every month from AT&AMP;T competitors
wanting his business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought when they broke it up it was kind of stupid. Rates
could have gone down had we just left AT&AMP;T intact and tried to
better regulate them,'' Hallenack said. ``I figure at the rate
things are going, we'll be back to one company in about seven
years, and if we control it properly, we'll all be in better
shape.''
</P>
<P>
   But while many people like Hallenack lament mind-boggling
telephone bills and dinner-hour long-distance telemarketing calls,
most industry analysts and government authorities find it
unimaginable consumers would be enjoying anything like today's
reduced costs, improved service, and explosion of new products had
AT&AMP;T survived as the omnipresent Ma Bell.
</P>
<P>
   ``The breakup of the Bell System, in terms of what it set out to
do, has to go down as possibly the most successful antitrust policy
in the country's history,'' said Lee L. Selwyn, president of
Economics and Technology Inc., a Boston consulting firm that
advises the Massachusetts attorney general's office on
telecommunications policy.
</P>
<P>
   Phone usage skyrockets &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Selwyn has calculated that in real dollars, the cost of a
three-minute coast-to-coast call has dropped by 91 percent since
1969, almost all of the reduction since the AT&AMP;T divestiture on New
Year's Day, 1984. The typical long-distance call today costs no
more than the typical local call did in the 1950s, Selwyn said.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers are ``voting with their feet,'' Selwyn noted, making
probably quadruple the number of long-distance calls they did in
1984. From 1984 to 1995, the most recent year available in Census
Bureau reports, ``daily conversations'' on the US phone network
grew ninefold from 1.2 billion to 11.6 billion, plus untold
billions more data and fax calls.
</P>
<P>
   And even if the headlines may suggest the industry is in the
process of undoing the AT&AMP;T breakup, at most the spate of
consolidations will lead to a strongly competitive oligopoly, with
multiple national telephone and cable television companies battling
each other to provide telecommunications services.
</P>
<P>
   US Representative Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts, the ranking
Democrat on the House telecommunications subcommittee, said to many
casual observers, the trend of ``recombinant telecommunications
DNA'' may look like ``AT&AMP;T is trying to put Humpty Dumpty back
together again.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Markey notes, there is a huge difference now: ``If AT&AMP;T is
Humpty, Bell Atlantic is Dumpty, and the law says they can't go
back together again.'' Plus there is another factor: cable and
utility companies are stringing competing lines into homes and
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   And even if the land-line companies converge, booming wireless
companies, which count more than 60 million Americans as customers,
will provide competition from another front to keep pressure on
calling costs.
</P>
<P>
   Breakup fueled technology advances &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The 1984 resolution of the federal government's 10-year-old
antitrust suit against AT&AMP;T aimed, among other things, to open up
the telephone industry to competition in residential long-distance
service and in the supply of telecommunications equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Once AT&AMP;T's 22 local operating companies were split into seven
Baby Bells, local companies had no particular incentive to steer
long-distance business to Ma Bell and no requirement to buy most or
all of their equipment from AT&AMP;T's Western Electric unit, now
Lucent Technologies. Nor could they use inflated long-distance
charges to business customers to subsidize local calling.
</P>
<P>
   Besides driving down long-distance bills, the AT&AMP;T breakup is
credited with fostering a vibrant, innovative US telecommunications
manufacturing sector that now totals $120 billion a year in sales,
including a market for home phones that customers once had to rent
at inflated prices from AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have services today that 15 years ago people never dreamed
of when the telephone company was a fat and happy monopoly,'' said
Gary Morgenstern, spokesman for AT&AMP;T's northeastern operations.

   TAKE-BOS  
 UNDATED: ... AT&AMP;T's northeastern operations.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   And when MCI and Sprint began building fiber-optic networks
promising, in the memorable ad, sound so clear you can hear a pin
drop, the threat pushed AT&AMP;T to develop its own fiber-optic network
years sooner than it might have otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   From 82 percent in 1985, AT&AMP;T's share of the long-distance
market has dwindled to 62.2 percent as of September, according to
the Yankee Group in Boston. MCI-WorldCom has more than doubled its
business in that time to 12.3 percent, followed by Sprint with 5.1
percent, Excel with 2.5, and GTE at 2.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Call waiting, caller ID, home voice mail, and all the other
goodies that are now commonly offered by Baby Bells probably would
have taken years or decades longer to become available if AT&AMP;T had
remained a monopoly, industry analysts contend.
</P>
<P>
   But the progress has not been painless.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly people who were very used to doing business with the
old Bell system found it very comfortable and very attractive to
make one phone call and get anything fixed or anything delivered,''
said James Cullen, president and chief operating officer of Bell
Atlantic. As a young executive on loan to AT&AMP;T from New Jersey Bell
in 1982, Cullen helped lead planning for the breakup.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the competitive benefits that have been released have
gone primarily to businesses, and less so to consumers,'' Cullen
said. But, he adds, ``We had something akin to the Pentagon or the
Post Office doing Soviet-style five-year plans. We did unleash a
lot of competition and entrepreneurship and very accountable market
forces.''
</P>
<P>
   Ringing headaches &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Still, what some see as market-responsive forces, others _ such
as business people interviewed last week in the Boston suburb of
Somerville _ find to be a big headache.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I know is we get 10 calls a day asking us to switch
carriers, and it's a little aggravating,'' said Frances Travassos,
who manages the Ultima Hair Design salon.
</P>
<P>
   ``My one comment on'' what long-distance competition has
achieved ``would be: confusion,'' said Mary Baker, who runs a
travel agency across the street. ``People try to explain it to me,
but a lot of people feel the best thing is to take the easiest way
out'' and keep AT&AMP;T, which she has done.
</P>
<P>
   While some of the costs of the AT&AMP;T divestiture are hard to
calculate, one became plainly visible on Bell Atlantic customers'
bills last month: a new 23-cent-a-month ``local number
portability'' charge to cover the cost of allowing people to switch
local service from a Baby Bell to a competitor, even though most
residential users can't make the swap yet. Elsewhere in the country
these fees are as high as 53 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic, for example, estimates it will spend $1 billion
to open up its Maine-to-Virginia network to competition, although
it says most of that cost will be borne by its shareholders, not
phone customers.
</P>
<P>
   Had AT&AMP;T survived in its original form, Americans likely never
would have heard of slang such as ``slamming'' and ``cramming'' _
terms for unscrupulous practices by competitors who switch
unwitting customers to another carrier or hit them with obscure,
unwanted charges on their bills.
</P>
<P>
   Markey, however, calls those problems solvable by regulations
and overall ``a relatively small price to pay for the huge,
economic Information Age transformation our country has undergone
in the last 15 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Another huge, if hard to measure, cost has been the confusing
proliferation of area codes across the United States since AT&AMP;T was
broken up. That trend has been driven largely by the need to supply
new blocks of phone numbers for Baby Bell local service
competitors, although many contend the blame lies in poor planning
and management of number allocation by state and federal
regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1984, the number of US area codes has boomed from 125 to
more than 330. Massachusetts has gone from two to five and may need
nine by 2002. By some estimates, more than 60 percent of all
Americans have been subjected to an area-code change since 1995,
paying all that entails in new stationery and signs, reprogramming
of computers, and general disruption.
</P>
<P>
   On balance, though, most residential users and business owners
seem happy with the outcome of the AT&AMP;T breakup.
</P>
<P>
   John R. Wiseman Jr., who runs a family insurance agency in
Somerville, said, ``We don't miss the old AT&AMP;T as much as I thought
we would.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought at first it was terrible, but I think what has
happened is the competition has kept the prices down for small
businesses like ours, contrary to what I would have expected,''
said Wiseman.
</P>
<P>
   His agency continues to use AT&AMP;T for long distance, and he
marvels at how cheap it has become to, for example, send a fax to
Florida or California.
</P>
<P>
   And national surveys by the Yankee Group, a leading
telecommunications analysis firm, indicate people are substantially
happier with their telephone service than any other wire or
communications device coming into their home.
</P>
<P>
   ``People said, `Why did they break up something that worked so
well? We had the best system in the world _ why did we destroy it?'
'' said analyst Fred Voit of the Yankee Group.
</P>
<P>
   But in his firm's September 1998 survey of 2,040 Americans, the
percentage of people calling their long-distance service excellent
or good was 84 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That compared to 81.3 percent for local phone service, 71.4
percent for Internet access, 70.1 percent for cellular, 67.2
percent for electric, and 61 percent for cable television.
</P>
<P>
   Given what a vastly different world it is now compared to 1984,
with telephone companies facing global competition and alternative
technologies like ``cable broadband'' and cheap cellular calling
that were barely envisioned then, many analysts are comfortable the
current reconsolidation cannot squelch competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The AT&AMP;T cable acquisitions do not bother me at all, and in
fact I think they are good things,'' said Selwyn, the Boston
consultant. ``The fact that this market ends up an oligopoly is not
unexpected or necessarily bad, in that lots of industries end up
that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic hopes to close its merger with GTE sometime early
next year, which will give it a major presence in states such as
California, Florida, Illinois, and Texas as well as potentially
nationwide access to the long-distance market it is now trying to
enter one state at a time in Massachusetts New York, and, soon,
Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   As Bell Atlantic's Cullen puts it, in today's climate, ``You
need to move up on the size-and-scope food chain to be able to
compete with an AT&AMP;T or an MCI.''

WOMEN DOMINATE COLLEGE CAMPUSES; IS WORKPLACE NEXT? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the University of Massachusetts at Boston awarded Jeanette
LaVasta a bachelor's of science degree in chemistry on Saturday,
the 27-year-old honors student joined a growing number of women
relying on college degrees to pave the way to achievement.
</P>
<P>
   LaVasta received a bachelor's degree in sociology from Cornell
University in 1991, then spent four years working as a
$24,000-a-year research lab assistant. She enrolled at UMass after
learning that a secretary with no degree was earning more. ``I
figured a chemistry degree would open up a lot more options in
terms of graduate study and professional work,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal statistics show that women are graduating from four-year
colleges at higher rates than men, raising questions about the
impact on the workplace and whether their sheer numbers may be
enough to close salary gaps and end gender inequities.
</P>
<P>
   Fueling that debate is a 1998 report by education policy analyst
Thomas Mortenson of Oskaloosa, Iowa. He argues that women's higher
college enrollment and graduation rates will likely put them ahead
in the future, better equipped to bid for white collar jobs in the
nation's expanding service economy.
</P>
<P>
   With the current economy booming, more and more young men are
delaying college or not going at all, decisions that could cause
them to eventually fall behind, he says.
</P>
<P>
   The US Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that women will earn
56 percent of the 1.1 million bachelor's degrees awarded in 1999.
The number of women earning college degrees has surged 44 percent
over the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the number of men earning degrees from four-year
colleges has dropped 6 percent over the last five years to 500,000
in 1998 from 532,881 in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   By 2008, say statisticians, women will significantly outnumber
men in both graduate and undergraduate classrooms, representing 9.2
million of the nation's 16 million college students, reports the
Digest of Education Statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Said Boston University spokesman Colin Riley, ``Our freshman
class, which will enter its sophomore year in September, is 60
percent female _ the first class ever to hit that mark, and we've
had 126 commencements.''
</P>
<P>
   Why the surge? Specialists point to a number of factors: More
nontraditional students, such as LaVasta, are enrolling in college
programs geared to their individual needs. Also, elementary and
secondary schools have made efforts to encourage girls and prepare
them for college.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a number of things going on,'' said economist
Anthony Carnavale, vice president of public leadership for the
Educational Testing Service division in Washington, D.C. ``The
biggest is that the labor market has changed so much that the value
of a college education has almost doubled over the last 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the same time, women are beginning to understand that they
cannot earn money until they get a college degree,'' he added. ``A
man can still make a decent living with a high school diploma. On
average, high school educated males make $28,000 per year. For
women with just a high school diploma, it is about $15,000 per
year. For them, the lost opportunities associated with not going to
college are just too high.''
</P>
<P>
   Boys are more apt to drop out of high school or choose
vocational or technical schools that offer training for skilled
jobs that pay $25,000 to $30,000 to start.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a tiny percentage of boys, wooed by hot
Internet-related jobs, are going directly from high school into the
workplace or dropping out of college to pursue lucrative offers.
But, specialists say, such a career path can be a poor substitute
for going to college.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every study you read shows that education is the key to future
earnings potential and better jobs with higher pay and more
flexibility,'' adds John Challenger, president of the Chicago-based
outplacement firm, Challenger, Gray &AMP; Christmas. ``If you look at
some of the growth jobs in marketing, health care, financial
management, and advertising, for example, women are in those jobs
in fairly large numbers. If they continue to earn degrees at the
current rate, we could see an end to the glass ceiling for women.''
</P>
<P>
   That depends on whether a college education continues to be the
best and fastest route to upward mobility and higher pay. Critics
also caution that any optimism concerning the impact of
college-educated women on the workplace is premature and
misleading.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very glib to say the gender-equity battle in the
workplace is about to be won. We need to stop and look at where
women really are,'' said Judith A. Sturnick, director of the Office
of Women and Higher Education at the American Council on Education
in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Women still dominate traditional, low-wage professions such as
teaching. Partially because of that, female professionals continue
to earn only 74 cents to every dollar earned by males, and few
actually move from management into the top executive ranks or onto
corporate boards.
</P>
<P>
   Nicole Deraleau, who will receive a bachelor's of science degree
in civil engineering from Northeastern University this month,
believes she will be an exception.
</P>
<P>
   Deraleau has already landed a job at the Hartford office of Camp
Dresser &AMP; McKee, which has five women engineers. ``I always felt
that my career opportunities would not be the same if I didn't go
to college,'' said Deraleau, 22. ``There never was any other
option.''
</P>
<P>
   Iyeoka Okoawo, 24, of Boston, will earn a bachelor's of science
degree in pharmacy from Northeastern this month. And, like
Deraleau, she considers her degree an investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This degree will make money right away that I can use to pay
off my school loans,'' said Okoawo, a performance poet whose
parents are from Nigeria. ``This was a practical move for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the forecast for minority women, who now earn
one-quarter of all degrees conferred, is mixed. When Catalyst, a
New York research group, surveyed 1,700 women _ of whom more than
half had graduate degrees _ 25 percent of African-American, 17
percent of Hispanic, and 10 percent of Asian American women were
planning to quit their jobs because they were not advancing.
</P>
<P>
   In a previous study, Catalyst reported that although minority
women make up 10 percent of the total 127 million work force, they
hold only 5 percent of the 7.5 million management jobs. While these
women have moved into professional jobs, many complain of being
``stuck'' in certain jobs.
</P>
<P>
   African-American women, however, have made significant gains in
college enrollment. African-American students now represent more
than 10 percent of the nation's undergraduate enrollment, and of
that, 63 percent are women, according to U.S. News &AMP; World Report.
</P>
<P>
   Specialists say a growing number of women, many of them working
mothers, find their advancement blocked by the lack of a degree.
So, they are going back to school _ in droves.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 45 percent of women enrolled full or part time in
undergraduate programs are nontraditional students age 24 and
older, and many are single parents, said Sturnick.
</P>
<P>
   According to Vance Grant, a statistician at the National Center
for Education Statistics in Washington, D.C., 64 percent of the
757,000 undergraduate students age 35 and over are women.
</P>
<P>
   One example: Clintona Wiley, 36, of Dorchester. On June 19, she
will receive a bachelor's of science degree in management from NU.
A mother of three children who joined Stride Rite in 1981 right
after high school, she started taking college courses seven years
ago. Wiley now tracks and manages the transportation of goods in
and out of the United States for TJX Cos.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than anything else, the degree is for my own personal
satisfaction,'' said Wiley. ``It was a goal that I had set. There
were times when I was tempted to give up. There were people who
said, `Why do it?' I felt it was important for me and my
development, and for my children. I wanted to teach them that they
should always continue to learn.''

A WNBA STAR IS BORN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN BICKELHAUPT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The non-paying crowd of about 500 had come to the
MCI Center on a hot Monday afternoon not to see the NBA's Wizards,
but to see the Mystics, the city's WNBA franchise.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd came to the preseason practice to see the team
scrimmage, shoot, and dribble, and to hear the coach explain what
kind of defense the team will execute this season.
</P>
<P>
   Which was all very nice, but when practice ended and the team
members lined up to introduce themselves, it was obvious who the
main attraction was. There was polite applause for Jennifer Whittle
and her Australian accent, and more rousing applause for returning
guard Nikki McCray, who averaged 17.7 points per game last year.
</P>
<P>
   But when Chamique Holdsclaw stepped to the mike, there were
hoots and hollers by fans who hope the No. 1 draft pick will do for
the team what she did for the University of Tennessee and for her
high school in Queens, N.Y. _ make it number one.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, they don't just hope Holdsclaw will bring the magic
touch. They assume it.
</P>
<P>
   Her resume of awards, records, and championships is why she's
being referred to as the next Michael Jordan, why her mug has been
on the cover of TV Guide, and why the ``Today'' show, Rosie
O'Donnell, and David Letterman were all courting her. It's why she
garnered a paycheck way above scale (estimated at $200,000) and a
multiyear contract with Nike.
</P>
<P>
   It's why the Mystics _ who last year had the league's best
attendance but worst record _ hope they can reverse their losing
ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fans were so loyal last year and endured a 3-27 season.
Their reward is to have Chamique here,'' said coach Nancy Darsch.
In other words, they more than deserve the star.
</P>
<P>
   The arrival of Holdsclaw is a much-needed bright spot for
women's basketball as the WNBA opens its third season Thursday
night. The sport suffered a setback when the rival ABL folded last
December, but the upside is that about three dozen players from the
ABL were drafted by WNBA teams.
</P>
<P>
   So despite a labor dispute that threatened to delay the start of
the 32-game season, the league should now be bolstered by all the
best women basketball players in America.
</P>
<P>
   Those players include Olympians Sheryl Swoopes of the two-time
national champion Houston Comets; Dawn Staley, former ABL player
now with the Charlotte Sting; and Teresa Weatherspoon, two-time
WNBA defensive player of the year, with the New York Liberty.
</P>
<P>
   And now, Chamique. Or 'Mique. Or Meek. Or however her fans want
to spell it.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, after practice and before going into the weight room,
Holdsclaw was handed a stack of mail that she looked at and shook
her head, saying, ``They all probably want my money.''
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly. One was from a stockbroker company, but another
addressed in ball-point pen to MEEK HOLDSCLAW was aparently from a
fan, and another _ the envelope she opened right away _ had an 8 x
10 color picture of her with the national team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, it's been a crazy spring, definitely,'' she said. It
started with the WNBA draft on May 4, graduation from the
University of Tennessee on May 14, the wedding of friend and
teammate Kellie Jolly to Jon Harper the next day, and going to WNBA
training camp the day after that. And through it all, she said
``having to go this way and that way for the WNBA.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the national attention is novel, the popularity isn't.
</P>
<P>
   So she sounds more matter-of-fact than immodest when she says
that, ``I've been in the spotlight ever since high school, so it's
not something that's new to me.''
</P>
<P>
   It was on-the-court, on-the-job training, so to speak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone says, `Chamique does a exceptional job at handling
it,' but that's 'cause I'm kind of used to it,'' she said with a
laugh and a shrug.
</P>
<P>
   Holdsclaw led her Christ the King High School team to four
championships. At Tennessee, she became the school's leading scorer
(3,025), leading rebounder (1,295), and was a four-time Kodak and
Associated Press All-American. She is on the US national team, and
won the gold medal in the worlds with them last year. Tennessee won
three straight NCAA championships, falling short last spring when
they lost to Duke in the quarterfinals, when Holdsclaw was last
seen on national TV sobbing on the sidelines with her coach, Pat
Summitt.
</P>
<P>
   But Holdsclaw, who finished the season averaging 20.4 points and
8.8 rebounds, said that's behind her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, I was upset, but I've been blessed and I'm not going to
sit there and go, `oh, I'm so depressed,' '' she said. ``I know
that not too many people are going to accomplish what I had or what
the team did for three years. So I'm content with it now, I'm
happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Between her record, and the No. 23 jersey that Holdsclaw wears,
one can't help but think about the Michael Jordan analogy.
</P>
<P>
   Holdsclaw said that she does like Mike _ ``he's the man'' _ but
the reason she wears the number is because of the 23d Psalm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was always No. 10, but then my grandmother told me about the
psalm, I can't really remember, I must have had a bad game or
something, and I was like, `OK, I'm going to wear this number from
now on.' ''
</P>
<P>
   And both she and Rita Williams _ who wore 23 on the Mystics last
year _ insist there was no wrestling match involved in getting
Williams to give it up.
</P>
<P>
   Holdsclaw rolls her eyes and sighs in mock hardship, recalling
that, ``Yes, I had to buy her some golf clubs, and I have to go
take lessons with her.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who now wears No. 13 (``I was the 13th draft pick last
year''), confirmed that she did get a set of clubs, but that ``it
was a just a mutual thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Holdsclaw knew of Williams, a University of Connecticut
graduate, from being NCAA rivals, and knew of teammate McCray, a
fellow Tennessee grad.
</P>
<P>
   The two never played at the same time _ McCray was class of '95
_ but benefit from having learned under the same coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Summitt is a great coach, so it's great when you have
another player playing alongside of you that knows the same things,
and terminology,'' Holdsclaw said.
</P>
<P>
   And don't expect the rookie star to muscle the veteran out of a
job, said Holdsclaw.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're totally two different players,'' she said. ``Nikki's
more of a transition player, going to create off the dribbles, and
I'm more a rebounder. I'm also a scorer, but you're going to see me
go out every night and try to get 10 to 12 rebounds, whereas Nikki
is going to try and stop the other player.''
</P>
<P>
   Darsch scoffs at any suggestion that the addition of Holdsclaw
will make for a divisive team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, there are players that get antsy about taking shots,
because they're used to being in that position to take shots,'' she
said. ``But I think as we develop as a team, the cohesiveness will
only get better as we share the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that everyone is glad that Chamique's here,'' Darsch
said.
</P>
<P>
   Not the least of whom is the coach herself.

 &HT;    Hootenanny heyday gets fitting tribute
 &HT;    By Eileen M. Drennen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anyone with a hootenanny past will find it tough not to sing
along to this thoughtful tribute to folk-rock's birthplace.
Guitarist Steuart Smith co-produces and pays homage to the mighty
six-string on all cuts, which stretch from Jonatha Brooke's
scene-setting title number (first done by Simon and Garfun-
</P>
<P>
   kel) to an instrumental version of Pete Seeger's ``Turn! Turn!
Turn!'' Loudon Wainwright III and Iris DeMent turn Richard and Mimi
Farina's ``Pack Up Your Sorrows'' into a
harmonica-and-banjo-powered rag; Jules Shear channels John
Sebastian on his weirdly romantic ``Darling Be Home Soon.'' Curious
timepieces (Chrissie Hynde's reverential reading of Tim Buckley's
``Morning Glory''; Buzzy Linhart's ``The Love's Still Growing''
given spooky wings by Suzzy and Maggie Roche) bracket the songs you
know by heart (``Reason to Believe,'' ``Everybody's Talkin''' and
``Let's Get Together'').

 &HT;    Mini reviews of recently released CDs
 &HT;    By Miriam Longino and Shane Harrison
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service

</P>
<P>
   ``Austin Powers:
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Various artists. Maverick. 12 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   As psychedelic swinging detective Austin Powers, comic Mike
Myers has managed to make the '60s more crassly fun now than they
were during the height of flower power, and this CD captures all
the shaggin' spirit of the films. A batch of quirky tunes from the
era has been placed in the hands of contemporary artists, who stir
up more fun than a Twister party. Lenny Kravitz scorches through a
stoned-out version of the Guess Who's ``American Woman.'' Melanie G
(a.k.a. Scary) shows there may be life after the Spice Girls when
she turns Cameo's ``Word Up'' into a techno-inspired dance chant.
R.E.M. revives the silliest lyric in rock history _ ``Huggin' a
tree when you get near it'' _ on a near-perfect cover of Tommy
James' ``Draggin' the Line.'' Even the goofiest tracks are groovy
fun.

   ``Jordan Knight''

<P>
   Jordan Knight. Interscope. 11 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   This former New Kid on the Block's solo debut is a minor
miracle, considering his past affiliation.
</P>
<P>
   The lascivious ``Give It to You'' is an inspired combination of
Timbaland-style hip-hop tricks and light psychedelia. As the first
single and leadoff track, it hints at an inventiveness that the CD
can't sustain, but the rest is solid and engaging fun. ``A
Different Party,'' with a hefty sample from Sugarloaf's
``Green-Eyed Lady'' and an effervescent chorus, is a perfect summer
single.
</P>
<P>
   The producers, including Jimmy Jam, Terry Lewis and former New
Kid Donnie Wahlberg, create a lot of the magic, but Knight
certainly deserves a good chunk of the credit. His voice is a much
more expressive instrument these days. He does a skillful revamp of
a high-caliber Prince nugget, ``I Could Never Take the Place of
Your Man,'' turning the bouncy original into a lovely, insinuating
ballad.

DEFUSING ANGER: COUNSELING HELPS HOMELESS GET PAST ABUSE,
SUFFERING 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Photo available on NYT database) 
(For release Sunday, June 13) 
 
(Attn: Tenn.) 
 
By JANETTE RODRIGUES 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The bruises from the last beating Ann suffered at the
hands of her abuser have faded, but her anger lingers.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in a comfortable chair, her soft, Southern drawl hardens
when she talks about the childhood neglect and violence that sent
her looking for a man who would protect her.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he punished her.
</P>
<P>
   For years, she suppressed her feelings about the beatings over
things as innocuous as going shopping without his permission, the
constant put-downs and being cut off from the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   The Baylor/Star of Hope Family Counseling Center, a program that
provides individual and group psychotherapy for homeless women and
children, is helping Ann understand the anger she's now free to
feel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never had anybody to talk to about the abuse, so I kept a
lot of anger inside,'' said Ann, 28, not her real name. ``But when
you're in the group you're not afraid to let it out, because the
others have been through the same thing and we support each
other.''
</P>
<P>
   Located at Star of Hope Transitional Learning Center in Houston,
the program is one of only a handful in the country that offers
intensive, individual and group counseling, psychological testing
and evaluations to the homeless.
</P>
<P>
   The program helps residents of the shelter understand their
problems and change the behaviors and conditions that may have
contributed to their homelessnes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The types of problems we see over and over again with clients
involve past or present family violence _ physical, sexual, verbal
and emotional abuse,'' said Warren Holleman, program director and a
Baylor College of Medicine professor and marriage and family
therapist.
</P>
<P>
   The program opened last September with the help of a $636,825
grant from Episcopal Health Charities.
</P>
<P>
   The funds allow a team of therapists, clinical psychologists,
family practice physicians, a social worker and interns associated
with Baylor to work with shelter residents five days a week.
Shelter residents can use the program for up to two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been working at another homeless facility for several
years,'' Holleman said. ``And there it became obvious to me that
counseling is helpful, but counseling services are generally not
available to the poor.''
</P>
<P>
   He believes that Houston is blessed with an unusually high
number of shelters that offer such counseling services to the
homeless. Lord of the Streets Episcopal Church and SEARCH have
similar programs.
</P>
<P>
   When the homeless do have access to psychotherapy, it's usually
in a group setting. Individual counseling is not the norm.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult to do that type of individual therapy, because
the money isn't available,'' said Pat Post, spokeswoman for the
National Health Care for the Homeless Council in Nashville, Tenn.
``It's a quandary (therapists) face around the country.''
</P>
<P>
   The council is a membership organization of health care
providers that work with the homeless and advocates for health care
system reform.
</P>
<P>
   Post added that, in some cases, a person isn't ready to open up
in front of a group but will in individual counseling.
</P>
<P>
   Star of Hope approached Baylor about duplicating its
psychotherapy program at the center because ``there is so much
lurking beneath the surface of homelessness,'' said Marilyn
Fountain, shelter community relations coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   More than 80 people currently receive services through the
program, which also has group counseling for children and a special
group for teen-age boys.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Baylor program has been a godsend to clients and staff,''
Fountain said. ``It helps people clean out their wounds, so that
they are no longer infected with their pasts, and they can heal
completely.''
</P>
<P>
   She noted that being reduced to living on the streets, or
depending on family and friends for a place to sleep, doesn't
happen in just one day.
</P>
<P>
   The National Health Care for the Homeless Council reported that
between 22 percent and 50 percent of homeless women surveyed over
the last decade identified domestic violence as the reason they
left their last residence.
</P>
<P>
   During a recent anger management therapy group at the center,
Holleman and a Star of Hope facilitator encouraged the women to
bring up past or present situations that sparked their anger.
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Lewis, 43, told the group she had a run-in with an
authority figure at the shelter and told the other woman off for
treating her like a child.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis has come a long way since she began attending the anger
management therapy group two months ago. She no longer flies off
the handle at real or imagined slights or situations she can't
control. But she feels she slipped up with the staff person.
</P>
<P>
   When the staff person first asked Lewis to adhere to the shelter
rule about no visitors in or outside rooms, she shooed them away
after a few minutes. But the staff person brought it up again.
</P>
<P>
   ``People come by to say hello and ask me how I'm doing,'' said
Lewis, who is on crutches after a knee injury. ``If they are doing
it out of care and love for me, I'm not going to tell them no.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in couches around a coffee table, the group turned the
incident over and around like a building block. Then some of the
women gave their opinions on whether Lewis' anger was justified or
not, and how she should handle it in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Group members told Lewis that her anger was justified because
she was provoked, but she shouldn't let others push her buttons.
They also pointed out that she didn't resort to violence, which she
would have in the past.
</P>
<P>
   After the hourlong session, Holleman noted that the women have
come a long way considering some of them wouldn't even talk about
being angry or the trauma that's often at the root of that emotion.
</P>
<P>
   The psychotherapy program is working at Star of Hope, said
agency and Baylor officials. But there have been a few failures
because some shelter residents aren't ready for counseling. Therapy
has to come at the right time, said mental health professionals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The right time varies from individual to individual; it may
come when you've hit rock bottom and need help,'' Holleman said.
``The wrong time is when people tell you you need it but you don't
want it.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Ann.
</P>
<P>
   Ann believes God led her to Star of Hope. She is putting her
life back together and is eager to re-enter the work force and find
a home of her own.
</P>
<P>
   Ann now says she has self-esteem and confidence. She wants
better for herself and her 2-year-old daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to be dependent on any man, my family or
anybody,'' she said. ``I'm going to get a job in computers and show
my daughter what it's like to grow up in a normal family.''

 &HT;    Peppers not quite so combustible
 &HT;    By Steve Dollar
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lock up your daughters, the Red Hot Chili Peppers are back. But
do they really need to be? The quintessential Southern California
punk-funkers are one of those early '80s arrivals that's showing
unsexy wear and tear, a band that's knocked around so long you
wonder if bassist Flea's toe-to-temple tattoos don't conceal a
fading expiration date. Between the fabled drug addictions,
notorious sexcapades, revolving cast of guitarists and the stupid
tube-sock-as-codpiece gimmick they once flaunted, the Chili Peppers
have so much rock-star credibility it's a wonder they're still
alive _ let alone capable of sequestering themselves in a studio
long enough to make another album. Besides, a generation of
white-guy funk and rap acts has, rather unfortunately, followed
their example, reminding us all why you need to be licensed to ill.
</P>
<P>
   Given that, you can view ``Californication'' _ the sometime
quartet's first disc since 1995 _ as a triumph of the human spirit
or merely a way to generate momentum for a new tour (the only place
where the band, in its full Dionysian glory, ever really defines
itself).
</P>
<P>
   Despite the indefatigable snap of rhythm guerrilla Flea's bass
and the insurgent bite of re-enlisted guitarist John Frusciante,
``Californication'' is one long-winded slog of an album. The
problem is easy enough to diagnose. The patented bad-boy raps of
vocalist Anthony Kiedis are tiresome and recycled, and he's not
enough of a real singer to make the contrite ballad stuff fly. It's
as if he's trying to turn the confessional success of ``Under the
Bridge,'' the band's early '90s mainstream breakthrough, into a
broader statement on the discontents of Hollywood high life. Which
is fine, if you want to be remembered as the '90s answer to the
Eagles, but it's never half as convincing as the firestorm of riffs
and rhythm the band gamely concocts.

 &HT;    Hitchcock still master of suspense
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In one movie, he's the guy who misses the bus. In another, he's
seen walking the dogs. In a third, he's briefly spotted strolling
in front of Janet Leigh's car as she begins her ill-fated drive to
the Bates Motel.
</P>
<P>
   Alfred Hitchcock was a director who knew good gimmicks and stuck
with them rather religiously. Such as doing walk-ons in many of his
movies. Missing that bus at the beginning of ``North by
Northwest.'' Walking that pet as Rod Taylor steps into a store to
buy two feathered friends in ``The Birds.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have wormed my way into my own pictures as a spy,''
Hitchcock once said. ``A director should see how the other half
lives.''
</P>
<P>
   He also wouldn't have minded doing something similar with the
press. ``I have a secret yen to interview them, to pose them for
still pictures,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The reasoning was simple, or ``purely sinister,'' as Hitchcock
put it: ``I find that the easiest way to worry people is to turn
the tables on them.''
</P>
<P>
   For decades, he did just that with his marvelous movies. The
original, sinister ``The Man Who Knew Too Much'' with Peter Lorre.
The psychological mind-bender ``Spellbound'' with Gregory Peck and
Ingrid Bergman. The crafty espionage yarn ``Saboteur'' with Robert
Cummings.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock ``does not lead us to like `sympathetic' characters
who are thrown into situations that ennoble them,'' the talented
French director Francois Truffaut wrote 20 years ago in The New
York Times. ``Rather, he attempts to make us feel and recognize in
ourselves insecurity, fear, compassion and relief.''
</P>
<P>
   This year is the 100th anniversary of Hitchcock's birth. And,
naturally, homages to the master of suspense are the order of the
day.
</P>
<P>
   At 8 p.m. Friday, Atlanta's High Museum of Art will screen
``Vertigo,'' the first of seven Hitchcock movies to be shown at
Rich Auditorium. The others: ``The 39 Steps'' (June 25), ``The
Wrong Man'' (June 26), ``Suspicion'' (July 9), ``Strangers on a
Train'' (July 16), ``Dial M for Murder'' (July 23) and, of course,
``Psycho'' (July 30). Tickets are $4-$5. (Information:
404-733-4570.)
</P>
<P>
   The summer film series at the Fox Theater includes ``Vertigo''
(70 mm) and ``Psycho'' on July 8 (ticket information: Ticketmaster,
404-249-6400). And New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art has a
summer-long Hitchcock exhibit and film festival.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some other Hitchcock movies worthy of your own home
video festival.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Lady Vanishes'' (1938): Sort of the English version of
``Casablanca's'' take on neutrality. In a witty spy script that
bashes British pacifism, a kind old woman disappears on a train,
and a female passenger hunts her out as other Europeans lift their
eyebrows.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Rebecca'' (1940): Hitchcock's American debut won an Oscar
for best picture (but not the best director award). Based on Daphne
du Maurier's Gothic novel, Joan Fontaine plays the nervous bride of
filthy-rich Laurence Olivier and shudders in the long, dark shadows
of his late first wife.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Foreign Correspondent'' (1940): A European spy thriller with
a good number of visual spins. Hitchcock makes more than anybody
could out of umbrellas and Dutch windmills.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Shadow of a Doubt'' (1943): In one of Hitchcock's sometimes
forgotten gems, Joseph Cotten is a serial killer and a family's
kind Uncle Charlie in a small, true-blue American town.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Lifeboat'' (1944): Yes, all the action takes place at sea as
World War II-era passengers from a sunken ship discover that
there's a German among them.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Rope'' (1948): It's all technique. Two young men stage the
``perfect murder'' and invite the victim's father to a party with
his son's corpse stuffed in a living room chest. Hitchcock shot it
as best he could as one continuous take, but the cameras of the
time held only 10 minutes of film. Thus there are several shots of
people's backs, so that cuts could be made. Maybe it doesn't really
work, but it's worth watching to see a directing genius at play.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Rear Window'' (1954): A near-perfect voyeur mystery on a
near-perfect film set as James Stewart spies what might have been a
murder through his apartment window.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``North by Northwest'' (1959): Cary Grant is everyman Roger
Thornhill, mistaken for a spy and saddled with a murder rap in a
cross-country thriller. Best gimmick: Everybody says it's the crop
duster sequence, but there's much to be said for Hitchcock's
wickedly humorous spin as Grant's picture is snapped during a
stabbing at the United Nations and he winds up with his mug (plus
the knife in his hand) on the front page of The Evening Standard.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Birds'' (1963): Less psychologically chilling than
``Psycho,'' but quite a tingler as gulls attack a coastal town.
Among the better gimmicks: An unsuspecting Suzanne Pleshette smokes
a cigarette as menacing crows flock to the playground equipment
behind her.

   ``Gods and Monsters'' (R)
</P>
<P>
   It won one Oscar for director Bill Condon's script. It should've
won a second for Ian McKellen's slyly nuanced performance.
</P>
<P>
   In this bit of fictionalized Hollywood history, McKellen plays
gay film director James Whale (``Frankenstein'') in the final weeks
before his death. Plagued by a stroke, he's troubled by sharp
memories of growing up as a poor young British boy and fighting in
the trenches of World War I.
</P>
<P>
   Brendan Fraser plays a welcome distraction: the new (and
straight) yard boy, whom the retired director befriends, despite
the suspicions of his fretting German housekeeper (Lynn Redgrave,
in fine, Oscar-nominated comic fettle).
</P>
<P>
   Director Condon delivers a melancholy meditation on creativity
and fatigue, friendship gained and love lost. On VHS (priced for
rental) and DVD ($34.98). Grade: A-

   &QR;  ``Psycho'' (R) _ A slavishly faithful remake of the Hitchcock
classic, shot virtually scene by scene by Gus Van Sant. Why?
Excellent question. It's very well made and acted, with Vince
Vaughn as Norman Bates, Anne Heche as his unlucky hotel guest and
Julianne Moore as her sister. But it's an odd cinematic experiment
that never seems to know exactly what it intended to prove. On tape
(rental) or DVD ($34.98). Grade: B-
</P>

</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``From the Earth to the Moon'' (unrated) _ Well-done but too
been-done. Many recurring scenes seem familiar from feature films
such as ``The Right Stuff'' and ``Apollo 13'' and documentaries
such as Turner Broadcasting's ``Moonshot'': the astronauts' easy,
macho banter and pranks; the tense faces back in the control room
in Houston. Granted, these are necessary parts of any epic about
the space program, but Tom Hanks and HBO don't have enough new
tricks to freshen it up. Available in a six-tape box set, $89.92.

PANAMA EXPECTS TO REAP BONANZA FROM CANAL OPERATION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (For release Sunday, June 13) 
(Eds.: Also see: Panama-canal) 
 
By JOHN OTIS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALBOA, Panama _ To Americans, the Panama Canal is an icon of
progress and engineering savvy. But to Panamanians, who are about
to start running it, the canal represents a spillway of wealth.
</P>
<P>
   Since the canal opened in 1914, more than 700,000 ships have
passed through its locks, shelling out billions of dollars in user
fees. The Konkar Star, for example, paid $79,000 for its recent
transit through the 50-mile route.
</P>
<P>
   Panamanian officials, who begin operating the canal Dec. 31,
believe that it will be an even bigger moneymaker. They plan to
streamline operations and push for higher earnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Profit is not a nasty word,'' says Mercedes Morris Garcia, a
spokeswoman for the Panama Canal Commission, the U.S.-Panamanian
agency that has run the canal since 1979. In its first year of
ownership, Panama expects to earn $30 million off the canal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to make it a competitive organization that's much more
in line with basic business principles in a global economy,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts warn, however, that Panama must not treat the waterway
like a money machine. If too many corners are cut, they say, the
canal will lose its hard-earned reputation for safety and service.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people watch this place and think they can make it
into a real cash cow,'' says George Markham, the canal's transit
operations director, who will retire in June.
</P>
<P>
   But, the American adds, ``the Panama Canal is a plant coming up
on 100 years old, and it needs a lot of maintenance. You can't
screw around with it.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States set up the Panama Canal Co. at the turn of the
century as a nonprofit federal utility with an army of employees.
</P>
<P>
   One early canal worker quoted by historian David McCullough in
his book ``The Path Between the Seas'' described the company as ``a
bureaucracy that's got Russia backed off the map.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet hulking as it was, the system worked. Canal company
employees religiously followed a costly schedule of repairs and
maintenance. The number of ship-transits through the canal
multiplied. The locks functioned smoothly. Accidents were rare.
Maritime traffic ran on time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The primary function wasn't efficiency, but to keep it
operating in a safe manner,'' said a Western diplomat.
</P>
<P>
   From 1914 until 1974, tolls were frozen at 90 cents per ton for
laden ships. Such charges were calculated to cover salaries,
maintenance, capital improvements and an annual stipend to the
Panamanian government.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say that the canal's U.S. administrators could have
charged much more in tolls, because for decades the waterway was a
trade-artery monopoly. Ship captains much preferred the canal to
the expensive, monthlong voyage around the tip of South America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirty years ago, there were no alternatives. Under those
conditions, it could have generated huge profits,'' says Juan
Jovane, an economist at the University of Panama.
</P>
<P>
   But Panamanians have long complained that the low tolls
subsidized the canal's main clients, U.S. shippers, and
short-changed their own government. Of the $10 billion in revenue
collected since the canal opened, Panama has received $1.69
billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economy that benefited the most from the canal was the
U.S. economy,'' says Charles Langman, director of Associated
Steamship Agents, a Panama firm that represents canal users.
</P>
<P>
   Adds Fernando Manfredo, a former canal executive: ``Panama was
just getting crumbs.''
</P>
<P>
   Such resentments as well as growing nationalism drove Panama's
leader in the mid-1970s, Gen. Omar Torrijos, to seek a new deal
with Washington. In 1977, Torrijos and President Carter signed the
Panama Canal treaties, which mandated the gradual transfer of the
waterway to Panamanian control by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1979, more than 95 percent of the canal's workforce has
been Panamanian, including the top administrator of the Panama
Canal Commission.
</P>
<P>
   At noon Dec. 31, the newly formed Panama Canal Authority, an
autonomous Panamanian board made up of business executives and
canal veterans, will begin operating the waterway.
</P>
<P>
   Expectations are enormous.
</P>
<P>
   ``The canal has an incredible future,'' says Marco Gandasegui, a
Panamanian political analyst. ``Sea commerce is growing. We're in
the middle of a great bonanza.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, annual revenues have jumped from $329 million in 1989 to
a record $545 million last year. Panama's share of 1998 earnings
was $118 million, and that figure is likely to rise in the future.
</P>
<P>
   With 38 ship transits per day, the canal is running at full
capacity. But a project to widen the Gaillard Cut, the waterway's
narrowest section, will allow for two-way traffic through the cut
and increase transits to 43 ships per day by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Panama has told clients that no new toll hikes are in store in
the immediate future. But Langman says canal officials are
considering a new toll structure under which cargo with a higher
value would pay more.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the canal's operators are trimming expenses.
In the past year, hundreds of the waterway's 9,700 employees have
accepted buyouts and retired early. According to Morris Garcia, the
spokeswoman for the canal commission, the number of workers will
probably stabilize somewhere between 7,500 and 8,500.
</P>
<P>
   Others savings, she says, could come from privatizing what she
calls ``nonessential'' canal operations.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's unclear just how much more money Panama can realize.
</P>
<P>
   The diplomat says he has heard some Panamanian politicians talk
of nearly doubling profits to $200 million annually _ a figure that
many analysts call unrealistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Panama is getting a handsome profit from the canal right
now,'' says Jurgen Dorfmeier, president of the Panamanian Maritime
Chamber. ``I doubt very much that there is anyone who feels that
they can get much more out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Several factors may work against an immediate surge in profits.
For one thing, the canal treaties stipulate that toll rates must
remain reasonable.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the canal is no longer the only transoceanic route.
If the current toll of $2.57 per ton is sharply increased, shippers
may opt for ship-to-rail land bridges across the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to be realistic,'' says Juan Jovane, an economist at
the University of Panama.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, when canal workers switch from being U.S. to
Panamanian government employees, any effort to cut more jobs or to
reduce salaries and benefits is likely to face stiff opposition
from labor unions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel we will have more work, not better service,'' says
Carmen Santamaria, a canal traffic controller, when asked about the
effect of possible staff cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, any increase in earnings could be partially offset by
the closing of 10 U.S. military bases and the withdrawal of 10,000
U.S. troops under the terms of the canal treaties. Panama is
expected to lose up to $300 million in annual economic activity as
well as 4,000 well-paying jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the former U.S. bases and about 500 square miles of prime
real estate along the canal present a potential windfall for
Panama. Already, Albrook Air Base has been turned into a commuter
airport, and vacated U.S. troop barracks and other properties now
house factories and container ports. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; ``With the canal becoming an integrated part of the economy, I
think it will be a pole for development,'' says Langman of
Associated Steamship Agents.
</P>
<P>
   But some critics are concerned that Panamanian officials will
turn to the canal when tax revenues run short or that they will
favor their political allies with lucrative contracts in the canal
area, according to Gandasegui, the political analyst.
</P>
<P>
   The potential for abuse was made clear last year. In an
embarrassing political scandal, two government ministers were
accused of receiving special treatment in the purchase of
canal-area homes left behind by departing U.S. military officers.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, President Ernesto Perez Balladares has been
criticized for naming several relatives to the nine-member board of
the Panama Canal Authority.
</P>
<P>
   But an official with Denmark-based Maersk Line, the canal's
second-largest client, says that the autonomous nature of the
authority should shield it from government pressures. He described
its members as well-respected executives.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys know what they are doing,'' says Hans Moller,
managing director for Maersk Lines in Panama. ``We are watching the
developments very closely, and we have a lot of faith that the new
administration will continue to offer safe and reliable service.''
</P>
<P>
   If not, Dorfmeier says, clients will simply go elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shipping is not going to stop if the canal closes tomorrow,''
he says ``I think that Panama has learned that if they don't handle
this correctly, the only one that will lose out is Panama.''

COLUMN: DOES DAN QUAYLE STILL HAVE THE WRONG STUFF? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Wednesday, June 9)  
(nk) 
 By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some overly sensitive readers surmised from a recent column that
I think Elizabeth Dole is unfit to be the next president of the
United States because she is ``structured'' to the point that she
makes her aides count the number of steps to the podium.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing could be further from the truth. I admire people who are
well-organized and orderly even though those are qualities that I
do not personally possess. The way I look at it, a candidate who is
counting her steps to the podium, the bathroom, the snack machine,
whatever, is a candidate who is not taking credit for inventing the
Internet or claiming he never inhaled.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as a humor columnist, I'm not sure it is in my best
interest to support a candidate whose most amusing quirk is the
ability to walk blindfolded to the lectern. This might be good for
five, 10 columns tops, but after that it's back to funny headlines
and lawyer jokes and whatever odors might be emanating that week
from the newsroom refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   If I were to support a candidate for purely selfish reasons (and
what other reasons are there to support a candidate?) I would, of
course, endorse Dan Quayle.
</P>
<P>
   There is nobody currently entered in either the Democratic or
Republican presidential race who is fit to carry Quayle's golf bag,
humor-wise. From 1988, when he was selected George Bush's running
mate, to that awful January day in 1993, when the office of vice
president was taken over by Al ``The Wood Man'' Gore, Quayle gave
America more entertainment value than a year's worth of ``Murphy
Brown'' reruns.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Dan Quayle has been out of office for a while and
there is some concern that he may have lost his touch. Would the
man who said ``Republicans understand the importance of bondage
between a parent and child'' and ``We are ready for any unforeseen
event that may or may not occur'' still have the Wrong Stuff?
</P>
<P>
   Would he become just another mumbler about villages and bridges
to the 21st century or would he still be able to inspire us, as
Americans, to wet our national pants with such lines as ``A low
voter turnout is an indication of fewer people going to the polls''
and ``It isn't pollution that's harming the environment. It's the
impurities in our air and water that are doing it''?
</P>
<P>
   An encouraging sign was the publication this week of ``What a
Waste It Is to Lose One's Mind: The Unauthorized Autobiography of
Dan Quayle'' by Deborah Werksman and Jeffrey Yoder. The title, of
course, is taken from Quayle's remark at an NAACP luncheon in 1989
where he misquoted the motto of the United Negro College Fund (``A
mind is a terrible thing to waste'') as ``What a waste it is to
lose one's mind, or not to have a mind is being very wasteful. How
true that is.''
</P>
<P>
   In their book, the authors give us a glimpse of Quayle's mind on
a variety of subjects, including:
</P>
<P>
   Geography: ``I love California. I grew up in Phoenix, Arizona. A
lot of people forget that.''
</P>
<P>
   Family values: ``One third of the children today are born into
homes without families.''
</P>
<P>
   Perseverance: ``My friends, we can and we will, never, never
surrender to what is right.''
</P>
<P>
   Public speaking: ``Verbosity leads to unclear, inarticulate
things.''
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, history: ``The Holocaust was an obscene period
in our nation's history ... this century's history ... We all lived
in this century. I didn't live in this century.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Dan Quayle is a tough act for Dan Quayle to follow. But
his remarks following his announcement in January that he would be
seeking the Republican party nomination for president gave me hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question,'' Quayle said, ``is whether we're going forward
to tomorrow or whether we're going past to the - to the back.''
</P>
<P>
   Wherever Quayle winds up taking us, it's bound to be a fun ride.

GARDENING QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

Growing Real Gherkins  &QL; 
Q. I've always made pickled gherkins from pickling cucumbers,
carefully harvesting the baby ones while they were still very small
and firm. Now I've been told that ``real gherkins'' are actually a
different vegetable. Is this true?  &QL; 
A. Real gherkins are really cool cucumbers, not a different
vegetable but a different species. Standard slicers and picklers
are both Cucumis sativus; gherkins are C. anguria. They're often
called West India gherkins, a reference to their route here from
Africa, or burr gherkins, a very good description of the small,
oval fruits, which are covered with soft spines. They have thin,
pale green skin, lots of tiny seeds and an agreeable, distinctive
flavor clearly related to that of cucumbers yet not exactly the
same.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh gherkins almost never show up in stores or at farmers'
markets _if you want them, you have to grow them _ but they are as
easy to cultivate as any other cucumber. Easier, maybe, since the
vigorous vines seem to be somewhat less tasty to cucumber beetles
than those of C. sativus. Gherkins need lots of heat to flourish,
and don't be stingy with the water or you'll get bitter little
pills.
</P>
<P>
   Seeds, which can be planted any time from now to early July, are
available from the Baker Creek Heirloom Seed Co., 2278 Baker Creek
Rd., Mansfield, Mo. 65704; (417) 924-8917, and from Pinetree Garden
Seeds, Box 300, New Gloucester, Maine O4260; (207) 926-3400; both
catalogs are free.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
To Avoid Double-Digging  &QL; 
Q. This fall, after the vegetable harvest, I will relocate two
3-foot-by-6-foot-by-10-inch raised beds (soil and all) to sites
that are currently covered by grass. Is there anything I can do to
the new sites to ease (or eliminate) turf removal, soil
double-digging and other preparation chores?  &QL; 
A. You can eliminate turf-removal by covering the area with
something thoroughly opaque: heavy black plastic or a solid
five-inch layer of paper (old telephone books and thick stacks of
newspaper work well). As long as no light gets through, the grass
will be dead by October. This is the easiest course of action, but
all you'll get out of it is dead grass, which probably won't become
useful compost until it has been under the bed for a while.
</P>
<P>
   If you're willing to work a bit, you can substantially improve
the soil and still avoid the heavy labor of double-digging. Start
by removing the sod, which is not a big chore if your spade is
sharp, then flip it over and replace it grass side down. Cover the
exposed roots and earth with a 3- or 4-inch layer of composted
manure, then a 12-to-14-inch-thick blanket of loose straw. Keep the
pile moist but not wet.
</P>
<P>
   By fall, everything except the top layer of straw should have
decomposed, enriching and loosening the earth underneath. When
moving day comes, just rake away whatever loose straw remains and
put the old bed on the new one. Then, with all that energy you've
conserved, mix the soil you've built with the soil you've moved to
bring it new vigor. Mystery Irritant  &QL; 
Q. Recently, while clearing overgrown honeysuckle and other
invasive vegetation, I pulled up 30 or 40 young thistles. Shortly
afterwards, I developed itchy, localized blebs on my hands and
face. Could the thistle juices on my leather gloves have caused an
allergic reaction? (In the past, I've dug up thistle plants and
handled them by the roots, bare-handed, without any problem.)  &QL; 
A. The highly invasive Canada thistle, Cirsium arvense, has a bad
reputation _ Wyman's Garden Encyclopedia describes it as a vicious
weed _ and you could probably raise a rash by rubbing your skin
with its prickly leaves. But neither this nor any other thistle
shows up on standard lists of common allergens, dermatologically
iniquitous plants or botanical toxins.
</P>
<P>
   It's still possible that you have an unusual allergy; almost
everything disagrees with somebody. But before you go off to the
doctor for the necessary testing, I suggest you consider the
possibility of plain old poison ivy. That evil vine often lurks
unsuspected in overgrown places. It's frequently seen (or, alas,
not seen) in conjunction with honeysuckle. And even the tiniest
seedlings contain enough urushiol _ one of the plant world's most
potent irritants _ to cause the symptoms you describe. Is Mulch
Good for Trees?  &QL; 
Q. My impression is that the heavy mulching of trees started as a
way to put some distance between tree trunks and aggressive lawn
trimmers, but that we've now been persuaded that lots of mulch has
an esthetic or even growth-nurturing purpose. Time and again when I
pull the mulch back I see bark softened by too much moisture and
damaged by beetles. Aren't all the mulch maniacs setting the stage
for widespread tree disease and death?  &QL; 
A. The problem is not with the mulch but with its over-cozy
relationship to the tree, which needs a bit of personal space to be
comfortable. Esthetic questions aside, almost all trees and shrubs
benefit from a moisture-conserving, weed-discouraging blanket over
their root zones, while none (except swamp dwellers) are happy when
moisture is conserved right up against the wood.
</P>
<P>
   Problems with the mulch-against-trunk-syndrome include damaging
fungus diseases, insect infestations and, especially in winter,
bark-eating mice and voles. All of these are easily avoided by the
provision of breathing space, and as long as they leave at least a
few inches of open ground between the mulch and the tree, the
maniacs are doing no harm.
</P>
<P>
   While we're on the subject, don't forget to be equally
respectful of your vegetables and flowers; soft-stemmed plants need
their space, too.
</P>

 By EDWARD R. LIPINSKI    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   After prolonged exposure to the elements, the color of the wood
in outdoor structures, like decks, lawn furniture and gazebos, will
turn from a warm brown to a dingy gray. Fortunately, a number of
products, called deck cleaners or deck revivers, can be used to
restore the natural color of wood.
</P>
<P>
   Besides making the wood look better, they are useful for
cleaning off mildew and mold and for removing stains. Mildew and
mold should be removed because they are unsightly and because they
make the wood surface slick and slippery. Once the deck is properly
cleaned, you can apply a sealer to protect the wood and keep it
looking good.
</P>
<P>
   Deck cleaners remove dirt and grime and also the surface layer
of dead cells in the wood. Their working action depends on the
chemical base in the formulation. Some cleaners contain only
detergents, but the majority are either carbonate- or oxalic
acid-based. Others have bleach (sodium hypochlorite) as a main
ingredient.
</P>
<P>
   Before buying any deck cleaner. read the label. Most cleaners
are formulated to work on wood types -- cedar, redwood and treated
pine -- commonly used for outdoor structures. Repeated use of
cleaners with a bleach base can eventually damage wood; so use a
bleach-based cleaner only if you have a wood surface that is
discolored with mold, mildew or berry stains. Use carbonate-based
cleaners to remove mildew and mold, and oxalic acid cleaners if the
wood is just discolored.
</P>
<P>
   The only tools you need are a cotton mop, paint roller or garden
sprayer; a long-handled scrub brush, and a garden hose. Deck
cleaners often contain caustic ingredients that can irritate the
skin, so be sure to wear rubber gloves, safety goggles, long pants
and a long-sleeved shirt.
</P>
<P>
   Most hardy plants will not be affected if they receive a splash
or two of the cleaner, but fragile plants like flowers could be
damaged. To protect them, first water around their roots, then
cover them with heavy plastic film. Also use the film to cover the
areas around the house where the deck is attached because some deck
cleaners can affect concrete and siding.
</P>
<P>
   Before cleaning the deck, examine the boards for damage. Loose
boards should be secured with galvanized nails or galvanized deck
screws. Look for splits, cracks and rotted sections. Deck cleaners
will not eliminate rot nor will they keep it from spreading. All
boards with large splits, cracks and rotted sections should be
replaced.
</P>
<P>
   Look carefully to see if the boards have been sealed or
varnished. In most cases, the cleaner will work through one or two
coats of wood sealer, but a heavy buildup of any finish could keep
the cleaner from working properly. You can remove thick layers of
finish with a commercial stripper formulated for decks (one brand
is called Powerlift).
</P>
<P>
   Some deck cleaners are available in liquid form and are ready
for spraying on the deck. Others are a powder that must be mixed
with water before they can be applied. Mix the powder with clean
water according to the manufacturer's directions.
</P>
<P>
   Apply the solution with a mop, paint roller or garden sprayer.
The wood surface should be cool. Do not apply deck cleaner to a
wood surface that has been exposed to the sun for any number of
hours. The hot surface could evaporate the liquid before it has had
a chance to work on the wood. Wait a few minutes to allow the
cleaner to work into the wood, then scrub the surface vigorously
with the brush to remove dirt and mildew. Rinse with clear water.
</P>
<P>
   The deck cleaner will restore the color to the boards, but
eventually even this renewed color will fade. Nothing can prevent
this weathering process, but it can be slowed down with
applications of stain and a clear finish. Unless a stain is
formulated with an ultraviolet screening agent, it will not do much
to protect the wood, but it can be used to hide any spots or
blotches and give the wood a uniform color. Whenever possible,
choose a stain and sealer that offers ultraviolet protection.
</P>
<P>
   Before applying any stain or sealer, allow four or five days for
the deck to completely dry out. Brush the stain on according to the
manufacturer's directions, allow time for it to dry, then apply the
sealer. It is best to apply only one coat of sealer, because thick
accumulations will attract and hold dirt.
</P>
<P>
   The deck will keep this renewed appearance for a long while. It
should be cleaned, however, whenever the wood shows signs of mildew
or graying. It is not necessary to apply a new coat of sealer every
time you use the deck cleaner. &QL;

OFFICE 2000: WORLD WIDE HARD DRIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
(jt) 
 By ROB FIXMER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Office 2000 hit the shelves this week and this complete overhaul
of Microsoft's suite of so-called productivity applications offers
many new features _ and, predictably, a few new irritations. But
its most remarkable innovation is the way the entire family of
applications seamlessly interacts with the Internet, in essence
recasting cyberspace as the World Wide Hard Drive.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at the software strictly from a user's standpoint, the
change is definitely for the better. After four months of playing
with Office 2000, it's clear that not only is it an improvement,
but it makes excellent use of Microsoft's integration of its Web
browser into the Windows 98 operating system.
</P>
<P>
   That integration, which is an issue in the long-running
antitrust suit against Microsoft, turns out to be a powerful and
very desirable asset for Office 2000, because it enables programs
running on Windows to effortlessly interact with the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Say you receive an e-mail message with a Web link in it. While
most e-mail programs will allow you to click on that link and fire
up your default browser, Office 2000's Outlook immediately displays
the Web page within the e-mail window and adds a Web navigation
bar. You can remain in the Web environment as long as you like,
then immediately return to reading mail in your In box without ever
switching programs.
</P>
<P>
   More important, all Office 2000 applications _ and that includes
Word, Excel, Powerpoint and Outlook, and in some versions other
programs as well _ now read and write documents in HTML format, the
lingua franca of the Web. Say you want to save a document you just
wrote in Word as a Web page. Just click on ``file/save as'' and
choose HTML as your file format. The operating system saves your
work as a Web document, and if you have set up a Web site, it
publishes the page on that site as easily and quickly as it would
save a traditional document to a disk or send it to a printer.
</P>
<P>
   So whether the task at hand is publishing a corporation's annual
report or posting pictures of the kids for grandma, you can create
instant Web pages. In addition, the Web pages created by Office
2000 can be interactive _ but only if the host of your Web page
installs special ``Office extensions,'' add-ons to the software on
its server. To take advantage of a few of the most advanced
interactive features, the visitor to your Web page must be running
Microsoft's Internet Explorer 5.0, but most of Office's Web pages
will work just fine with Netscape Navigator.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of Office 2000, Explorer 5.0 and the Office
extensions enables groups of workers to collaborate on Office
documents saved as Web pages. And you can enable outside visitors
to query an Access or Microsoft SQL data base that has been linked
to a Web page.
</P>
<P>
   These features are not for typical individual or small business
users. Though they work fine over the Internet, they will be of
most use on company intranets, where the computer systems managers
will install the Office 2000 extensions to enable easy
collaboration by many employees on a variety of documents. Clearly,
Microsoft is betting that the Web will become a ubiquitous reality
in both the office and the home.
</P>
<P>
   And if you don't need to create or maintain Web pages? That's a
tougher call, but it certainly makes upgrading to Office 2000 less
attractive.
</P>
<P>
   That's especially true given suggested retail prices that range
from $209 (after a rebate) for upgrading to the standard edition _
Word, Excel, Powerpoint and the Outlook e-mail and personal
assistant program _ to a wallet-draining $800 for a from-scratch
installation of the deluxe edition, which adds Microsoft Publisher,
Small Biz Tools, the Access data base manager, the Frontpage Web
page editor and the Photodraw graphics program to the standard
applications.
</P>
<P>
   In between are the small business version ($209 upgrade, $409
full), which adds Publisher and Small Biz Tools to the basic four
applications, and the professional edition ($309 upgrade, $599
full), which adds those two applications plus Access.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even without the Web features, Office 2000 offers sundry
new refinements that make life a little easier. For example, the
spell checker now automatically corrects common errors as you type.
This affects only typing for which there is a single possible
alternative in the spelling dictionary, and it ignores proper
names. The upshot is that this feature has evolved into a very
useful tool.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, some parts of Office that needed improvement
don't seem to have been touched. For instance, the grammar check in
Word still typically introduces more errors in its recommendations
than it finds in the document.
</P>
<P>
   And in a few cases, I could do without an ``improvement''
altogether. Among these are menus and toolbars that adjust to
include only features you actually use. This can be annoying, since
it makes it much harder to find some feature that you use twice a
year but just now happen to need urgently. On the other hand, the
annoyance is minor because if you hesitate with the mouse pointer
over any menu for more than a second, it automatically expands to
offer all the features.
</P>
<P>
   But of all the genuine improvements in Office 2000, nothing
compares with the applications' ability to repair themselves. If
Excel, for example, starts acting flaky or spitting out error
messages, you can ask it to diagnose and fix itself. Almost
unbelievably, it works.
</P>
<P>
   This turns out to be a godsend for Outlook, which still seems
shakier than the rest of the suite. In fact, this combination of
e-mail software with a contact manager, scheduler, electronic
stick-'em notes and to-do list remains Office's weak link,
confusing and very nonintuitive. Though all its elements work
together, they often do so in a clunky, inelegant way. For example,
the contact manager is also the e-mail address book, but adding an
address from within the e-mail program is so nonintuitive that I
often end up opening the contact manager to add an address that is
sitting in an open piece of e-mail right in front of me.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the bottom line is that Office 2000 sets a standard for
productivity software that will be hard for competitors to match.

A TRIVIA FORMAT TO RIVAL CHANNEL SURFING 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By J.C. HERZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The opening screen is black, with a white triangle filled with
television snow. Over the hiss and squeak of lousy signal
reception, the voice of Austin Powers' arch nemesis is audible:
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. Evil here. I've taken over your computer. It's quite nice.
The wallpaper is lovely. I hope you don't mind if I make a few
long-distance phone calls.'' He titters. ``I have kidnapped Austin
Powers and am currently holding him prisoner in his own pathetic
hipster hangout, the Electric Psychedelic Pussycat Swinger's Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could easily kill him now, with poisoned gas, a pen or a
ripened avocado, and with Austin Powers out of the way, I could
take over the world. But just to make things more diabolical, we're
going to compete in a game show to decide the fate of the world.
Just for kicks _ like Twister.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome to Win, Lose or (italics)Die.''(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   Thus begins Austin Powers Operation Trivia from Berkeley
Systems, maker of the best-selling You Don't Know Jack titles. The
game follows the popular format of the series _ fast-paced
multiple-choice questions about fads, fashions, movies, television
and gossip culled from the '60s, '70s and '80s, all presented
against a parody of 1960s graphic design (psychedelic colors,
Jefferson Airplane lettering, go-go girl silhouettes, op-art,
etc.).
</P>
<P>
   There is also a good deal of Austin Powers trivia, lest we
forget that this is a movie tie-in, timed to coincide with the
release of ``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me'' (although,
with jumbo billboards of Austin Powers straddling a Virgin Atlantic
jet and ``Virgin Shaglantic'' commercials all over the radio, the
Austin Powers phenomenon is difficult to escape).
</P>
<P>
   Chalk it up to smart marketing, or something in the air or
something in the water, but we are in the middle of an Austin
Powers moment. Something about Mike Myers' foppish caricature of
swinging London has struck a chord, particularly in the new-media
community.
</P>
<P>
   In Silicon Alley, Powers' catch phrase, ``Yeah, baby!''
reverberates in an echo chamber of psychedelic stock valuations.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a senior vice president of Macromedia, which makes
Shockwave and Flash animation software for the Web, presented a
preview of multimedia products dressed as a 1970s hipster, the
company said. He urged software developers to yell ``Groovy,
baby!'' at any features they liked and ``Shagadelic!'' at features
that really got them excited.
</P>
<P>
   Sound bites, baby! Groovy sound bites, yeah!
</P>
<P>
   Like all cult movies, ``Austin Powers'' is more fun to parrot
back than it is to watch. In Operation Trivia, or on the Web, all
you see and hear are the riffs _ visual and verbal.
</P>
<P>
   The digital experiences are extraordinarily shallow. But that's
the point _ the entertainment value of a cult movie is all on the
skin. Anything else is what you have to sit through to catch the
phrases you already know.
</P>
<P>
   On a minute-to-minute basis, Operation Trivia has a higher riff
quotient than the original ``Austin Powers'' movie. It's almost all
riffs. But in this case, superficiality is a plus. It accentuates
the supreme frivolity of the trivia and the blissfully undemanding
format of the questions.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Trivial Pursuit, a game that forces you to dredge obscure
facts from the depths of your memory, Berkeley games, including
Operation Trivia, are based on simple recognition. Out of seven
choices, pick the four outfits that Powers wore in the movie.
</P>
<P>
   Hitting yes-or-no keys at a rapid-fire pace, distinguish
Australian bands from Irish bands. Pick films made by Joel Silver
vs. films made by James Cameron. Characters on ``Melrose Place''
vs. characters on ``90210.'' Students on ``Welcome Back Kotter''
vs. students on ``Head of the Class.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a trivia game that plays like a twitch game. It's quick
recognition _ firing at pop culture references. Got it, bing, got
it, bing, got it, bing. In a way, it's like watching ``Austin
Powers'' on screen (James Bond reference, bing, ``Avengers''
reference, bing, Andy Warhol, bing, Quadrophenia, got it, bing).
</P>
<P>
   Except that Operation Trivia is interactive. So it's actually
more like channel surfing, the channel-up, channel-down kind you do
with one thumb and no particular program in mind.
</P>
<P>
   The conventional wisdom about arrow-button channel surfing is
that it's an aimless, mindless, vegetative activity. And it is
aimless. But it's not mindless. It's actually a form of solitaire.
It's a matching game that uses television channels in place of
cards.
</P>
<P>
   Every television channel has a slightly different visual
identity. It may be something obvious, like an MTV logo in the
corner. It may be the camera angles, or the colors, or the
typefaces, or the volume level. And then there is the programming,
which can also be recognized and categorized.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who watches television has mental templates that
correspond to television channels, based on viewing experience, and
the second you spend on a given channel is the time it takes to
compare what you see on the screen with those templates and find a
match. When you find it, you change channels.
</P>
<P>
   It makes no more sense to linger on a program than it does to
linger on a playing card. Individual playing cards aren't
entertaining, and for the most part, neither are individual
television programs. But the game is mildly entertaining, if you've
got nothing better to do _ much like Operation Trivia.
</P>
<P>
   After 25 years, video games have produced something to rival the
experience of channel surfing. And the formula sells _ for better
or worse. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1981, while doing postdoctoral field work in cultural
anthropology, Bonnie A. Nardi lived with villagers in Western
Samoa, trying to understand the cultural reasons that people there
have an average of eight children.
</P>
<P>
   Today Nardi works at AT&AMP;T Labs West in Menlo Park, Calif., and
has no regrets. She left academia in 1984 and is considered a
pioneer among anthropologists who are employed by high-tech
companies to examine consumers' behavior in their homes and
offices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually people say, `What is an anthropologist doing here?' ''
Nardi said. ``But when I explain that I study how people use
technology in order to get new ideas for products and services, it
instantly makes sense.''
</P>
<P>
   No longer do companies study consumers' psyches only by asking
people what they think about technology and how they use it. Now
they conduct observational research, dispatching anthropologists to
employ their ethnographic skills by interviewing, watching and
videotaping consumers in their natural habitats. In the past
several years companies like Apple, Motorola, Xerox and Intel, as
well as telecommunications and cable companies, have brought
anthropologists into the corporate fold. The goal is to apply what
the anthropologists learn to new product concepts. ``It's the
extreme form of understanding the customer,'' Nardi said.
</P>
<P>
   Half of all anthropologists with doctorates are going to work
outside universities, said Susan Squires, president-elect of the
National Association for the Practice of Anthropology, which
represents anthropologists outside academia.
</P>
<P>
   High competitive pressure and short product cycles mean that
corporate field work is usually much briefer than academic research
and fewer people are studied. While the work might not be
considered reliable enough to be published in a traditional
anthropology journal, companies can use the results to help them
make marketing and product-design decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Observational research is not new for American industry. It can
be traced to the 1930s and '40s, when social scientists began
examining productivity during the Depression and World War II, said
Marietta Baba, chairwoman of the anthropology department at Wayne
State University in Detroit. ``They left industry completely in the
'60s and '70s,'' Baba said. ``They came back in the '80s and there
has been a slow, steady increase since then.'' The rise in
corporate employment for anthropologists has roughly paralleled a
drop in academic opportunities. Hallmark Cards has an
anthropologist. The automotive industry employs at least a dozen,
and so does Andersen Consulting.
</P>
<P>
   But it is in the high-tech arena, with intense pressure and high
rate of product failures, that studying consumers' habits at very
close range is currently most popular, Squires said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We go out into the consumer space, into people's homes _ we go
to where the people are,'' said Tony Salvador, an experimental
psychologist at Intel, where he is called a design ethnographer.
``If we're interested in their homes, we go there. If we're
interested in what they do on vacation, we go on vacation with
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes an ethnographic inquiry will lead to new ways to use
an existing technology or will generate new technologies. It was a
1996 study of pager use in rural China, where there is a scarcity
of phones, that prompted Motorola to start thinking seriously about
two-way paging outside urban markets, said Jean Canavan, an
anthropologist who is the manager of culture and technology
initiatives at Motorola.
</P>
<P>
   ``The context is really critical,'' Canavan said. ``If we want
to develop technologies that really fit into the way people live
their day-to-day lives, then we have to understand how people
really live.''
</P>
<P>
   Many anthropologists work with a concept called embodied
knowledge _ tacit, nonscientific knowledge _ and look for ways to
incorporate such information into product design. Embodied
knowledge is ``basically the intelligence in your muscles,'' Nardi
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You aren't born knowing how to ride a bicycle,'' Baba said.
``You don't learn by reading a book. With experience, your body
comes to `know' how to ride a bike.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Paying attention to embodied knowledge helped Matsushita build a
better bread maker in 1987. The company sent a team of engineers to
be apprenticed for several months to a master bread chef at the
Osaka International Hotel in Japan. The magic ingredient turned out
to be a special maneuver the chef executed with his hand while
kneading the dough, so the engineers figured out how to mimic the
movement with the machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anthropologists are trained in those patient, detailed ways of
watching for hundreds of hours and taking everything down in minute
detail, which is where the knowledge is _ in the tiny details,''
Baba said. An understanding of movement skills has helped in the
design of things like the computer mouse, joystick and touch
screen. The mouse, for instance, lets the hand mimic the way the
eyes scan a computer screen.
</P>
<P>
   The social aspects of technology particularly interest
anthropologists like the ones in Salvador's group at Intel. Three
years ago, the group was set up when the company began considering
other consumer products after releasing its Pentium processor. ``It
was selling really well into homes, and people were saying we have
to build more things for the home,'' he said. ``We thought maybe we
should understand more about the home.''
</P>
<P>
   The group members embarked on a study of 10 families with young
children. They visited each family for an evening, eating dinner
with the family and analyzing the organization of the home and the
family's daily routine.
</P>
<P>
   Salvador's group found that the kitchen and family room were the
most important rooms in the house. ``Very rarely are people alone
in those spaces,'' he said. ``Social relationships are very
important.'' Salvador's findings may not seem like much of an
epiphany, but his work has helped lead Intel to look beyond the
notion of a PC as a device generally used by someone seated at a
desk alone in a room and to understand the importance of whole
families using and sharing computing devices.
</P>
<P>
   Anne McClard and Ken Anderson, anthropologists who are married
to each other, do similar observational research at Media One, a
cable provider that AT&AMP;T recently agreed to purchase. McClard and
Anderson are part of Media One's Broadband Innovation Group. Their
charge is to find new users and new uses for the company's services
and, as McClard put it, ``to make broadband living a reality.''
</P>
<P>
   To study Internet usage patterns, companies also install
tracking systems on subjects' computers. But those kinds of studies
are a poor substitute for the serendipitous twists and turns of
actual interviews, anthropologists say.
</P>
<P>
   Nardi said it was also important to couple interviews with
observations to pick up on the knowledge and behavior people
exhibit but do not think to mention. In her book ``Information
Ecologies: Using Technology With Heart'' (MIT Press, 1999), Nardi
describes a study she did of a broadcast video and audio system in
a hospital. She noticed that the surgical staff told jokes during
routine parts of an operation. ``This became an issue when the
multimedia system began to broadcast audio to remote parts of the
hospital,'' she said in an interview. The jokes and banter, she
said, relieved tension during lengthy operations. ``But no one
would ever have said in an interview, `We tell jokes during
surgery,''' she noted. Nardi and her colleagues recommended that
the hospital add a feature to the system so the surgeons would know
whether the audio component was turned on.
</P>
<P>
   McClard and Anderson of Media One have had similar experiences.
Last summer, they conducted a study called Always On, in which they
observed families with cable modem connections, which allow
computers to have a constant connection to the Internet at very
high speeds, in an effort to understand what it is like to have
such a link to the Internet in one's home.
</P>
<P>
   The two anthropologists found that people with constant
connections were often unaware of changes in their behavior. For
instance, the people would often walk over to the computer to
perform tasks like retrieving e-mail even if they were busy with
tasks somewhere else. But they hardly notice that they are doing
it, Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   Such observations by anthropologists can be important for sales
later on. When Canon first introduced its color printers for the
home market in 1995, said Squires, who works for GVO, a consumer
product consulting company in Palo Alto, Calif., consumers did not
know what to do with them. So a team of researchers from GVO went
into homes to examine refrigerator doors and bedroom walls for the
types of printed material families create and exchange. The result
was Canon Creative, the greeting card, T-shirt and poster software
that comes bundled with the printers. Sales of the printers took
off, Squires said.
</P>
<P>
   But corporate anthropologists operate under constraints that
make their jobs harder. McClard said the year and a half she took
for an academic project seemed like ``a real luxury'' from the
standpoint of the corporate world. A project for, say, Media One
lasts just a few months.
</P>
<P>
   So many of those anthropologists find it hard to present their
findings, often from limited field samples, in a way that interests
the people in the company who plan and design products. ``Part of
the challenge is telling the story in a way that makes it
compelling to people who have the power to develop products,''
McClard said.
</P>
<P>
   McClard and Anderson videotape most of their interviews. ``When
engineers see the people talking, they are more convinced than if
we told them stuff,'' she said. ``We have to bring the experience
alive for people. We don't have the numbers. The only thing we have
is the experience of the people we go out to see.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Prusak, executive director of IBM's Institute for
Knowledge Management, a research organization, in Cambridge, Mass.,
said he believed that the number of anthropologists in industry
would continue to grow.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's going to be a huge flourishing of industrial
anthropologists in the next 20 years,'' he said, adding that this
was especially true in the technology sector because companies were
continuing to study technology's potential for mimicking human
behavior. ``We're in the infancy in this area, and I don't think
anyone would tell you differently.''

 &HT;    RATINGS OF FILMS, OTHER MEDIA NOT RELIABLE, CRITICS CHARGE
 &HT;    1160&AMP;trim. With RATINGS-DATA. Moving in (w) Washington and (e)
entertainment categories.
 &HT;    By BOB DART and SCOTT SHEPARD

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ While theater owners are promising to card
teenagers who want to see R-rated movies, critics charge that
industry ratings of films and other entertainment do not provide a
reliable guide to parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ratings have become more loose. What would have been PG-13
is now PG. What was an R-rated movie is now PG-13,'' said Dick
Rolfe, director of the Dove Foundation in Grand Rapids, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   ``We asked parents what their frustrations were with the
ratings, and they said that 'the standards have been relaxed over
time' _ kind of like grading on a curve,'' agreed David Walsh,
founder of the National Institute on Media and the Family in
Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   ``If parents were doing the ratings, they'd be rating movies
more strictly,'' said Walsh.
</P>
<P>
   Critics find similar problems with the voluntary rating systems
created by the television, video game and music industries _ the
other media frequently blamed with contributing to a ``culture of
violence'' that is is easily accessible to children.
</P>
<P>
   The television rating system introduced in 1997 has backfired,
allowing networks to include ``even edgier content into their
shows,'' said L. Brent Bozell III, chairman of the Parents
Television Council.
</P>
<P>
   A recent study by his organization found that from November
1996, just before the original rating system began, to November
1998, sexual content, foul language and violence in TV programs
increased by more than 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Interactive Digital Software Association (IDSA), which
represents the $5.1 billion video game industry, has developed a
voluntary rating system based on both age-appropriateness and
content. In the five years since the rating system was developed by
the Entertainment Software Rating Board, only about 7 percent of
the more than 5,000 titles have been categorized as for ``mature''
audiences.
</P>
<P>
   In response to calls by President Clinton and others, IDSA is
consulting retailers on how to improve or better enforce the rating
system.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the Recording Industry Association of America, which
represents the recorded music industry, is resistant to any outside
attempts to change its ``parental advisory'' system that began in
1985 to alert parents to objectionable song lyrics.
</P>
<P>
   While many recordings do carry a parental advisory label, it is
possible today to buy recordings containing strong language or
expressions of violence, sex or substance abuse that do not have a
label. And there is no uniform policy in the industry on whether to
sell labeled recordings to minors.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Yoxall, national spokeswoman for the national Parent
Teacher Association, which helped the recording industry develop
its labeling policy, said the PTA would like to see more
content-based ratings, not just in recordings but in all media.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're mostly concerned that parents and other care-givers have
enough information to make informed choices enough about what their
children are viewing or listening to,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Concerns about violent content, which have escalated during the
rash of school shootings over the past several years, have focused
mostly on movies.
</P>
<P>
   The familiar movie rating system of G through NC-17 was
developed three decades ago and is touted by the entertainment
industry as providing a much-used guide for parents in choosing
suitable films for their children.
</P>
<P>
   ``The movie rating plan is a good-faith effort to provide
advance cautionary information even though the ratings are
necessarily subjective,'' said Jack Valenti, president of the
Motion Picture Association of America and architect of the system.
</P>
<P>
   (Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Valenti explained the origins and workings of the voluntary code
in a paper called ``How It Works.''
</P>
<P>
   The code was developed in 1968 after controversies over the
films ``Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?'', which contained the
phrase ``hump the hostess,'' and the movie ``Blow-Up,'' which had
nudity. That year, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutional
power of states and cities to keep children from seeing movies and
reading books that could not be denied to adults, Valenti recalled.
</P>
<P>
   At first, the code had four ratings categories: G for general
audiences, all ages admitted; M for mature audiences, parental
guidance suggested but all ages admitted; R for restricted,
children under 16 not admitted without an accompanying adult, and X
for no one under 17 admitted.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, the code evolved. Because parents were confused by
the M category, believing it was more severe than R, it was changed
to PG for parental guidance suggested. The category later was split
to add PG-13 to warn parents of a higher level of intensity. The
age restriction on R-rated films was raised to 17, and the X
category was changed to NC-17, partly because it had been corrupted
by makers of adult movies who advertised their films as XXX.
</P>
<P>
   (End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The big problem with movie ratings is PG-13,'' said movie
critic Michael Medved. ``It was created from a desire to get more
edgy material into a film while avoiding an R rating.''
</P>
<P>
   Many PG-13 movies would have been rated R under earlier
standards, he said. ``The most meaningful change that could be made
would be from PG-13 to R-13 ... requiring children 13 and under to
be admitted with an adult.''
</P>
<P>
   The movies are rated by a full-time board of eight to 13 members
in Los Angeles. In his paper, Valenti said that ``there are no
special qualifications for board membership, except the members
must have a shared parenthood experience, must be possessed of an
intelligent maturity, and most of all, must have the capacity to
put themselves in the role of most American parents so they can
view a film and apply a rating that most parents would find
suitable.''
</P>
<P>
   But while a parent's view of what children should or should not
see tends to be constant, the raters' view of how much sexual
content and violence is permissible in a particular rating category
has widened over the years, many movie-goers believe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ratings do seem to have gotten more lenient _ particularly
with sexual content. They've always been more so with violence,''
said Louis Giannetti, a professor of film and English at Case
Western Reserve University in Cleveland and author of
``Understanding Movies,'' a widely used movie history textbook.
</P>
<P>
   Producers constantly seek to ``push the envelope'' on what is
permissible within a rating, said Rolfe.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is more disturbing is that movie makers have become so
insensitive to the ratings. They are marketing R-rated films to
teenagers,'' said Rolfe. ``A good example is 'American Pie,' (a
highly publicized July release) which is about high school seniors
racing to lose their virginity by prom night. It's an R-rated film.
Now how many adults are going to be in that audience?''
</P>
<P>
   Over half of all movies are rated R, with the percentage
increasing in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hollywood says exactly what the cigarette companies say, which
is 'we don't market this stuff to kids.' Obviously they do,'' said
Medved.
</P>
<P>
   However, he said some ``ratings creep'' is appropriate as
standards change in society. ``Gone With the Wind'' might have been
rated R when it came out because contains the word ``damn,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Medved has proposed adopting a universal rating system to
``cover all elements of pop culture'' including movies, television
programs, music lyrics and video games. The plan has been adopted
in legislation sponsored by Sens. Joe Lieberman, D-Conn., and John
McCain, R-Ariz., he said.

<P>
   MOUNDSVILLE, W.Va. _ Years of work-related injuries, car
accidents, mental problems, a neurological disorder and a bout with
cancer drove Bradley Miller to seek Social Security Social
disability insurance in February 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Miller arrived at his medical examination hopeful the doctor
would validate his claim that aches, pains and shortness of breath
had disabled him. At his exam, he was asked to blow as hard as he
could into a tube, given an X-ray and then told he could go home.
</P>
<P>
   Although the examination had lasted 10 minutes, it yielded an
exhaustive six-page report describing details of Miller's feet,
ankles, hips, back, chest, abdomen _ his entire body. It described
listening to Miller's chest with a stethoscope, measurements of his
arms and legs, and making him stand on one leg at a time.
</P>
<P>
   Miller says no such examination had taken place. The report by
the examining doctor was signed by Dr. Bruce Guberman. But the
person who examined Miller was a woman. The agency responsible for
evaluating Miller's claim _ the West Virginia Department of
Rehabilitation Services (DRS) _ rejected his claim, citing the
report in ruling Miller was capable of holding a job.
</P>
<P>
   Miller's might be just another case of sour grapes by a rejected
seeker of government benefits. But Miller is just one of numerous
disability claimants in different parts of the nation who say they
were rejected after physicians performed superficial consultative
examinations, or CEs as they are known in Social Security jargon.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst Newspapers have documented 76 similar cases in different
parts of the nation, including Texas and California. Lawyers who
represent some of these claimants say the actual number is a lot
higher.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1954, the Social Security Administration has provided cash
benefits to workers whose disabilities may have prevented them from
finding and keeping jobs. In 1998, Social Security awarded $73
billion in benefits to nearly 11 million people under this program.
</P>
<P>
   Although the states manage the benefit program, the money comes
from the U.S. Social Security Administration, which also pays for
the CEs, which totaled 1.6 million last year. The state agencies
also decide whether to order CEs when medical evidence is in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Social Security officials say these CEs may be brief because
they are designed only to answer particular questions about a
claimant.
</P>
<P>
   But disability activists and others with experience in
disability law are not so sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too often, the exams are so cursory as to be meaningless,
resulting in needless administrative waste,'' said Marty Ford,
co-chair of the Social Security Task Force of the non-profit
Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities, testifying last February
before the House Ways and Means human resources subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   Regina Harland, a 14-year veteran of the Social Security
Administration who now works as a paralegal in a Beaumont, Texas,
law firm that represents claimants appealing Social Security
disability denials, says physicians often ``do reports that are
five, six pages long, and they look like great reports, but they're
nothing more than computer printouts with a lot of canned language
in them.''
</P>
<P>
   Karl Osterhout, a Pittsburgh lawyer who represents Miller and
four others in pursuit of a class-action lawsuit against the West
Virginia DRS, said that if doctors doing these examinations were
simply trying to fill in the blanks in a claimant's medical record,
they would not produce lengthy reports purporting to detail the
functions of all bodily systems.
</P>
<P>
   Miller and other similar claimants cannot be accused of sour
grapes if the medical examinations they received were too cursory
to prove or disprove their claims, Osterhout said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we win, all we get is another chance for our clients to
present their claims without reliance on doctors who don't really
examine their patients,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit filed by Miller and the others argue that the
brevity of these examinations violated the Social Security
regulations governing them.
</P>
<P>
   Social Security regulations say that doctors conducting such
tests must guarantee ``that sufficient time is made available to
obtain the information needed to make an accurate determination.''
A general medical examination should take at least 30 minutes; a
neurological exam 20 minutes; and a psychiatric or psychological
consultation should last between 40 minutes and an hour, the
regulations say.
</P>
<P>
   But critics say these regulations are undercut by the medical
economics of doing disability examinations.
</P>
<P>
   The Social Security Administration reports spending about $180
on each CE. But that figure represents an average that includes
costly psychiatric and neurological exams. Doctors who perform
straight physical exams often receive $75 to $125 for each one.
</P>
<P>
   Many physicians, including the specialists whose skills often
are necessary to make difficult diagnoses, don't consider
consultative examinations worth their time.
</P>
<P>
   Into this vacuum have stepped so-called key providers,
essentially large medical practices that perform more than $100,000
worth of CEs annually. They do a high-volume trade, making money
through fast-turnover examinations of disability claimants.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Mizner, coordinating lawyer of the San Francisco-based Bay
Area Regional Benefits Access Collaborative, which receives federal
grant money to assist homeless people in obtaining federal
benefits, is critical of the mass-production aspects of medical
practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have seen a few of these doctors do a thorough job, but we
seldom see them last very long,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Mizner speculated that ``a doctor who is any good will find
employment elsewhere and earn much more. That leaves only doctors
who can't find other work or don't care about doing a good job.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Daniels, Social Security deputy commissioner for
disability and income security programs, defended the agency's
oversight of doctors who perform consultative examinations, saying:
``We know that not every CE is (of) the quality we would like it to
be. But we believe that we have a fairly solid system of dealing
with cases where we have inadequate information. We're comfortable
that we catch the quality problems, and that they're not
systemic.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller, after being rejected, later filed a new disability
application and was examined by another physician, not a key
provider. The doctor tested his grip and reflexes, made him walk
and bend over, and checked his feet. This time, West Virginia
awarded him disability insurance.
</P>
<P>
   In his lawsuit, Miller and the others are seeking an injunction
requiring the DRS to beef-up its monitoring of CEs, particularly
Dr. Guberman and his medical group, Tri-State Occupational Medicine
Inc. of Huntington, W.Va. Tri-State is not a named defendant.
</P>
<P>
   Osterhout estimated Tri-State performs 10,000 consultative
examinations a year, grossing $1 million or more.
</P>
<P>
   Neither DRS director James Jeffers nor Jane Johnstone, head of
the division's disability determination section, would comment on
Tri-State. Jeffers confirmed that Tri-State is among the key
providers the division uses, but he declined to say how much
business the division gives the group, or whether officials are
satisfied with Tri-State's performance.
</P>
<P>
   Johnstone, the official with day-to-day responsibility for
approving and denying disability claims as well as selecting
doctors to perform consultative examinations, defended her unit's
performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell the staff to develop these cases as if they're your own
family,'' she said. ``We do everything we can to help them prove
their case and (we deny benefits) only when the evidence is clear
they are undeserving.''
</P>
<P>
   Guberman declined an interview request. His lawyer, Philip
Melick, said in a statement: ``Neither Tri-State nor its associated
physicians is a party to the litigation involving the (West
Virginia DRS). It would be inappropriate at this time for Tri-State
or its associated physicians to comment on personal medical
information concerning any claimant.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   There's nothing quite like a good shag.
</P>
<P>
   Its long, soft wool demands to be stroked, petted like the pelt
of some rare mountain sheep. The thing is almost obscenely sexy, a
vaguely naughty artifact from a more swinging age that makes you
want to exclaim, in a bad impersonation of Austin Powers, ``Oh,
behave!''
</P>
<P>
   Hard to believe that, until recently, this furriest of floor
coverings had been written off as the ultimate home-furnishing faux
pas. For most of this decade (and the last), not even the
aggressive sales force of ABC Carpet and Home could move shags. Now
it can hardly keep them in stock: huge white flokatis from Greece,
tulus crafted by Turkish nomads, groovy Scandinavian rya rugs from
the 1960s hanging on the walls like modern art.
</P>
<P>
   At downtown vintage emporiums like Las Venus, on Ludlow Street,
shags are all around vinyl sofas and elliptical floor lamps. A
recent New York magazine cover envisioned a dissolutely glam couple
lounging by a white shag on New Year's Eve 1999. Oh, and let's not
forget a certain sequel opening tomorrow: ``Austin Powers: The Spy
Who Shagged Me.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of this sequel, and the original ``Austin Powers,''
released two years ago, wistfully celebrates an era, the late '60s,
when everything, even carpeting, seemed to be about sex. In a
publicity still for ``Barbarella'' (1968), Jane Fonda strikes a
space-age sex-kitten pose against a backdrop of gold shag. As a
promotion for the new ``Austin Powers,'' Virgin Atlantic Airways
has decorated a jet in shag.
</P>
<P>
   Guests entering the lobby of the new Standard hotel in Los
Angeles will notice that one section is wall-to-wall shag.
Literally. The plush white carpeting smothers the floor, climbs up
the walls and across the ceiling. An employee had to be specially
trained just to rake it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to achieve sort of the relaxed feeling you would
have in an old-fashioned conversation pit,'' said Andre Balazs, an
owner of the hotel and its principal designer. ``There's a tactile
thing going on, but there's a quality of envelopment and quiet, a
complete deadening of sound.'' It's a womb room for baby hipsters
old enough to have crawled on shags as rug rats and still young
enough to want to play on them.
</P>
<P>
   The shag rug has become a necessary accessory. Retro fetishism
has rescued it from the paneled rec room of kitsch and placed it
prominently in the sunken living room of cool, contemporary decor.
The British designer Liza Bruce deployed one in her Los Angeles
home, a former convent. As Harper's Bazaar described Ms. Bruce's
domestic scene in its June issue: ``The downstairs ballroom, which
once served as the nuns' chapel, is now empty, save for the small
white shag rug, leather Eames chair and booming stereo all in one
corner.''
</P>
<P>
   That this symbol of tacky suburban interiors should have become
chic again shocks people who lived through the first time around.
To them, even the word shag is a fingernail on the blackboard. Mark
Saley, a marketing manager at ABC Carpet, prefers not to use the
word.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not calling them shags anymore, of course,'' he said.
They're flokatis, classic shags made in Greece, or tulus, smaller
rugs with simple graphic designs traditionally made by Turkish
nomads. After a stylist for Wallpaper magazine used a shag _ sorry,
flokati _ in a spread last year, ``they blew out of here,'' Saley
said.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on size and quality, measured by the denseness of the
pile, the price of a new flokati at ABC or Einstein Moomjy can run
from $400 for one 4 by 6 feet to $2,500 for a 9-by-12. ABC's tulus,
new and vintage, go for about $1,000. The blindingly colored old
rya rugs in the Danish modern section of ABC's home furnishings
building are not for sale.
</P>
<P>
   But there's no shortage of shag around town, if you don't care
where they've been. Alan Sanchez bought a used rya rug three months
ago at R, a vintage modern-furniture store three blocks from his
apartment in Brooklyn. It's orange and black and white, with what
Sanchez described as a ``snail or seashell pattern.'' He got it for
$100.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't like we were shag hunting,'' said Sanchez, a partner
in a metal fabricating company. Far from it. Sanchez, 39, grew up
in a heavily shagged house. ``Where one ended, another one began,''
he recalled. ``From the heavy shag to that cropped shag.''
</P>
<P>
   Shags had left a bad taste on his esthetic palate. ``But in
retrospect,'' he said, ``I kind of like the idea.'' Now he wants
another one.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez has re-enacted the shag's life cycle since its
introduction in this country a generation ago: exposure, rejection
and new acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the Nordic invasion of mid-century American design, shag
has worked its way down the decor food chain from showroom to
suburban basement _ and back up again. It's a classic example of
how an idea can go from tacky (Graceland's abundant shag is all
lovingly preserved) to art (Rudolf Stingel made a career out of
covering galleries in electric-colored shag carpeting).
</P>
<P>
   But the shag's lineage goes back much further than David
Cassidy's haircut. Some scholars believe William the Conqueror wore
a protoshag when he led the Normans in the Battle of Hastings in
1066, said Jenny Wolfson, a dealer in 20th-century Scandinavian
design. In those days, she said, ``it was considered a mark of
power and prosperity to wear cloth, rather than fur.''
</P>
<P>
   Wealthier peasants used ryas _ note the similarity to the
English word ``rug'' _ rather than animal skins for bedding. This
decorative bedding mutated into floor covering during the 19th
century and, faster than you can say Ikea, into a mass-produced
must-have for anyone with a Dansk fondue set.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of fondue, the shag does have one undeniable downside.
Keeping one clean can be, to put it mildly, a nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard had just opened this year when Balazs agreed to
rent out the lobby for an Oscar party. The Standard's
floor-to-ceiling pile was still virgin white. ``It's a very
expensive carpet,'' he said _ about $45,000, imported from Italy.
</P>
<P>
   As the date of the party drew nearer, he couldn't stop worrying
about stains. Then Karen Finley, the performance artist, suggested
he hire a ``carpet slave'' for the night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had this guy on his hands and knees obsessing and picking
lint up from the carpet with tweezers,'' Balazs said. The young man
was led around the room on a leash held by a tall, striking blond
woman in a long evening gown.
</P>
<P>
   Very shagadelic.  &QL;

MAN BEHIND HANNIBAL'S MASK ALMOST AS BIG A RIDDLE AS HIS KILLER
CHARACTER
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanied by HARRIS-REMINISCENCE) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE COCHRAN 
and JEFF GUINN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In some ways, author Thomas Harris is as much a mystery as his
terrifying creation, Hannibal Lecter, who resurfaced this week in
bookstores across America.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven years after his last appearance, in ``The Silence of the
Lambs,'' the serial killer with the abominable appetite is back as
the title character of Harris' new thriller, ``Hannibal.''
</P>
<P>
   To that extent, Hannibal is even less elusive than Harris.
</P>
<P>
   No one's seen much of the Mississippi-born author, who is 58,
since publication of his first book, ``Black Sunday,'' in 1975.
Even old college pals at Baylor University haven't heard from him
since around the time of his second novel, ``Red Dragon,'' in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   That's when Harris first introduced his flesh-eating,
brilliantly bizarre villain. Now, after the success of ``Lambs,''
he's got one of the hottest novels ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will sell millions,'' predicts Kenneth Kirkland, an
independent book-industry analyst based in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hundreds of thousands of people who never even read `Red
Dragon' or `The Silence of the Lambs' will buy the book because
they loved the `Lambs' movie with Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal
Lecter.''
</P>
<P>
   Kirkland calls it a monstrous slam-dunk.
</P>
<P>
   ``No book will sell more copies in 1999, guaranteed, all because
of the character of Hannibal Lecter, who in a warped way has become
a real hero to Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   For its first printing, Delacorte Publishing has ordered a
million copies of ``Hannibal.'' Sales of 65,000 normally propel a
novel to the bestseller lists.
</P>
<P>
   Fans will be pleased to learn that Harris has an ``official''
Web site. They will be less pleased to know that all the
information it contains could fit on the back of a baseball card.
</P>
<P>
   The ``About the Author'' section reads simply:
</P>
<P>
   ``A native of Mississippi, Thomas Harris began his writing
career covering crime in the United States and Mexico, and was a
reporter and editor for The Associated Press in New York City ...
''
</P>
<P>
   There is no mention of his Baylor days in the early '60s and his
job at the Waco newspaper, where he covered the police beat and
general assignments.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site provides the titles and publishing dates of his
four novels and includes a small photograph of Harris. Apparently,
he's a chubby, bearded chap with an engaging smile.
</P>
<P>
   Delacorte publicists say they cannot schedule interviews with
Harris or offer additional biographical information.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, several complain, he's a publicist's worst nightmare
_ a writer whom every TV network, newspaper and radio station wants
to interview, but who flatly refuses.
</P>
<P>
   Even stranger, he rarely communicates with his old buddies at
the AP in New York or his college and newspaper cronies in Waco.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked with him from time to time until his second novel was
published,'' says David McHam of UTA, who was one of Harris'
journalism professors at Baylor in the early 1960s and who also
worked with him at the paper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember after he sold the film rights for `Black Sunday,'
he told me he wasn't going to talk to anybody anymore. He moved. I
moved. When I started trying to get back in touch, he was
unfindable. I hadn't realized when he said `anybody' that he really
meant `everybody.'''
</P>
<P>
   What's also unusual is that nobody seems to hold this reticence
against him, with the possible exception of his publicist. Long-ago
friends and colleagues still speak of him warmly and with genuine
affection.
</P>
<P>
   Universally, they describe him as a truly nice guy, intelligent,
a voracious reader, a hard worker, a bit of a dreamer, a dedicated
drinker and a softspoken gentleman in every sense of the word.
</P>
<P>
   Also, they say, he was drawn early on, if not to serial killers,
to bizarre murder cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was just fascinated by them,'' says Charlie Reynolds, a
journalism professor at Tarleton State University who taught at
Baylor and who worked with Harris in the mid-1960s at the Waco
News-Tribune and Dallas Times-Herald.
</P>
<P>
   ``He collected everything on them, followed them, wrote about
them and studied all about them,'' Reynolds says. ``And it made him
millions.''
</P>
<P>
   In those carefree days, Harris enjoyed socializing after hours
with his colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of us would meet at a bar after we'd put the paper to
bed,'' Reynolds says. ``He wasn't hard to get along with, but he
was not a talkative member of the writing group. He'd sit around
listening to what other people were talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   Retired Fort Worth Star-Telegram editor Mike Blackman, who
worked with Reynolds and Harris, agrees.

   DISABILITY-EXAMS (Moundsville, W.Va.) _ Bradley Miller lost his
bid for Social Security disability insurance after what he
describes as a 10-minute quickie medical examination that yielded a
detailed six-page doctor's report concluding he was fit to work.
Miller's case and dozens of others like it nationwide illustrate
what lawyers and advocates describe as a tendency of states and
Washington to rely on mass-production medical practices that do an
inadequate job of determining whether claimants are actually
disabled. By DAN FREEDMAN. (Already filed.)

agreement in Yugoslavia. By ROBERT E. THOMPSON. (Already filed.)

   MIRKOVCI, Macedonia _ In another mysterious Balkans twist,
Macedonia was struggling to decide Wednesday what to do with a
high-tech Israeli-made spy plane that Macedonian police seized on a
mountaintop near the Kosovo border from Israeli technicians
claiming to be on a free-lance journalistic mission.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday local authorities detained seven Israeli citizens who
said they had been using the state-of-the-art drone observation
plane to film inside Kosovo for international television networks.
The Interior Ministry said none of them had press credentials.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, after furious cellular phone calls to the capital
Skopje, local police here took two of the Israelis into custody and
allowed the international press to photograph the plane, which
looked like a jumbo toy airplane with a wingspan measuring nearly
14 feet.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, after pressure from the Israeli Foreign Ministry,
authorities here accepted the Israelis' assertion that they were
merely zealous capitalists and released them all without criminal
charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure if they'll get their equipment back,'' said Stevo
Pendarovski of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. ``I don't know
about other charges from customs or eventually from our civil
aviation service.''
</P>
<P>
   Macedonia, a placid country which has been thrust against its
will into the center of a violent world crisis, was clearly
befuddled to find seven Israelis driving down a mountainside late
Monday with two truckloads of aerial surveillance gear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe this was for commercial purposes, or maybe it was for
military purposes, I don't know,'' said Valentin Jovanovinski, a
Macedonian civil aviation flight inspector who was called here to
examine the Israeli gear.
</P>
<P>
   Late Monday, the Macedonians trapped the Israelis at a roadblock
here at the village of Mirkovci, about 10 miles north of the
capital Skopje. The roadblock was erected after Macedonian police
received a tip from Norwegian military officers about the drone
taking off. The Norwegians were stationed in the mountains near the
Kosovo border as part of a NATO observer detachment.
</P>
<P>
   In its maiden flight here Monday afternoon, the Israeli drone
had also caused alarm in a NATO-run aircraft control tower at
Macedonia's main civilian airport when it flew -- without any
flight plan -- into the airspace of an airport partly occupied by
NATO forces. NATO and Macedonian flight controllers are monitoring
the nearby air space for possible Yugoslav air raids or terrorist
attacks from the air.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran Israeli journalist Yigan Goren, a former diplomatic
correspondent for Israeli television, said in an interview it had
been his idea to assemble a team of Israelis to capture exclusive
aerial footage of the situation inside Kosovo and then sell it to
TV networks around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it becomes a big story between NATO, Israel and
Macedonia,'' said Goren. ``Why? As I understand the situation, the
Macedonian Government has a lump in their stomach against NATO.
They fear they are losing control of the country here. And NATO is
running the country. So they trying to apply force on my back.''
</P>
<P>
   Goren claimed that he got unofficial blessing for his
newsgathering plan from unnamed people at NATO headquarters in
Brussels and from a high-ranking Macedonian diplomat in London.
``It was not in writing, but we got an insurance, you know.''
</P>
<P>
   Macedonian Interior Minister Pavle Trajanov told a Tuesday news
conference that police have confiscated the drone plane while the
government figures out what to do with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were using non-piloted aircraft to observe the border
area,'' Trajanov told a news conference. ``They said they were
journalists, but they didn't have any journalistic accreditation.
Their film is being checked by NATO to see if it contained any
information about NATO troop movements.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The plane and its ground equipment is thought to be worth well
over $100,000. The Interior Ministry's Pendarovski said the drone's
seven-member ground crew included a retired major in the Israeli
Army who had specialized in drone surveillance operations.
</P>
<P>
   Following Trajanov's press conference, correspondents asked for
permission to see and photograph the drone plane. After several
hours of hesitation, the Macedonian authorities allowed journalists
to go into the garage of the Mirkovci police station.
</P>
<P>
   There on display was what looked like an oversized white toy
airplane, with a pencil-thin fuselage that was packed with cameras
and control gear. Mounted behind the wings was a gasoline motor
powering a rear-facing propeller.
</P>
<P>
   The drone contained no national insignias. But on the fuselage
and the ground control boxes were inscribed the name B.T.A.
Macedonian officials said the Israelis told them that B.T.A. is the
Israeli company that manufactured the drone.
</P>
<P>
   Goren, the Israeli entrepreneur who organized the filming, was
not among the seven Israelis detained by the Macedonians. He said
he had left the mountain launch area earlier in the day, in the
company of a Norwegian officer of NATO, to assure the dubious
Norwegian that he was not filming inside of Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   Goren said the Norwegian officer initially seized a video-tape
of material filmed by the drone inside Kosovo. Later on Monday,
according to Goren, he got the video back from a more senior NATO
official who had viewed it and found the contents to be
non-sensitive.
</P>
<P>
   Goren flatly denied that the news-gathering company he formed
about two weeks ago, Sky Video International, was a cover for some
government intelligence-gathering operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's purely civilian,'' he said. ``It's my company. I decided
to take with me the people of a company called B.T.A. It is a very
small company, but they are the best in the world in using small
drones.''
</P>
<P>
   Goren said the B.T.A. drones contain ``a very sophisticated
camera in the bottom that you can zoom, pan it left and right, and
everything.'' He said the drones can operate at ranges of up to 36
miles and can remain in the air, transmitting images to a ground
crew, for up to six hours of nonstop flying.
</P>
<P>
   Goren said that his team's drone managed only one flight into
Kosovo before it was confiscated.

   Kit Keith Yam, a food-science professor at Rutgers University,
is not impressed with today's microwave ovens. They do an
acceptable job of warming a cup of coffee, he said, but they fail
miserably at cooking food that requires different heating levels
for different time periods. And it is a rare day when they can pop
popcorn without leaving a layer of stubborn kernels at the bottom
of the bag.
</P>
<P>
   What microwaves need, he believes, is intelligence. They should
be smart enough to detect exactly what foods they are about to zap,
taking into account the foods' freshness, temperature, and
packaging. They should be able to consult information about which
cooking times and heating levels work best for those foods, and
then cook them as instructed.
</P>
<P>
   An intelligent oven should know its users too, Yam said _
recognizing voices and remembering, for example, that certain
members of the household are allergic to peanuts. The oven should
tap into the Internet as well _ providing information about a
meal's nutritional content or warnings about foods that have been
spoiled or even recalled. In fact, while they're at it, he added,
the machines might as well display the day's weather forecast and
the status of rush-hour traffic. And you just wanted warm coffee.
</P>
<P>
   Yam and a team of researchers at Rutgers are now devoting their
time to developing such an appliance. They have succeeded so far in
building a microwave oven that can read the bar code on a bag of
popcorn and glean the popcorn's proper cooking time by referring to
a data base of information collected by food scientists. Other
packaged foods _ lasagna and fish fillets, for example _ have been
tested too.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put together a knowledge base of food science and the tools
of information technology,'' Yam said. The team includes a Rutgers
professor, Paul Lachance, and a staff member, Raymond Saba, as well
as researchers for Samsung, the electronics company, and Symbol
Technologies, a bar-code scanning company.
</P>
<P>
   Yam demonstrated a prototype earlier this year. It was a regular
microwave oven hooked up to a bar-code scanner and a personal
computer. To pop a bag of popcorn, Yam held the bag over the
scanner, which picked up the product's identification number and
relayed that information to the computer. The computer used that
number to search a Rutgers data base for appropriate cooking time
and heating levels _ instructions that were sent to the oven. The
result, he said, was popcorn with a better texture, better taste,
and fewer unpopped kernels. (Unfortunately for popcorn lovers, Yam
promised participating popcorn companies that he would not publicly
reveal specific results of that particular study.)
</P>
<P>
   The Rutgers team is now putting the finishing touches on a
second prototype that will have a computer chip and scanner built
in, so that the appliance looks like a regular microwave oven. The
prototype, which will have to connect to the Internet as well as to
an electrical outlet, will use voice-recognition software and more
advanced bar-code information. To make the intelligent oven work,
however, the Rutgers group will have to get food companies to
increase testing on their products to determine optimal cooking
times in specific models of microwaves. And they will either have
to add more advanced bar codes to their packages to give the
microwave ovens information about nutritional content, or they will
need to submit that data to a large data base that could be
available through the Internet. Celentano, a company that
specializes in frozen foods, has agreed to help with the next
prototype.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Yam will continue to cook his favorite frozen
meal _ stuffed shells _ with a regular microwave, suffering through
the frozen middles and burned edges just like the rest of us.

<P>
   SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. - When his car broke down on Scottsdale Road
in the middle of the day with the temperature over 100 degrees, Lou
Furman didn't panic.
</P>
<P>
   A traveling man learns to take care of himself, and for decades
Lou was on the road selling ladies' clothing between Arizona, New
Mexico, Wyoming, Colorado, Utah and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to high fashion and highways, the key to success
is staying calm.
</P>
<P>
   Now in his mid-80s, Lou doesn't stray far from home. But on this
day, his wife, Adele, was attending a function at a local resort,
so Lou gave her a ride. Not long after he dropped her off, the
electrical system in the car short-circuited and the whole thing
went dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way it goes, sometimes,'' he says. ``I pulled off
the road as far as I could and waited for a tow truck.''
</P>
<P>
   He'd just gotten out of the car when he heard a woman's voice.
She'd pulled up behind him and was hurrying over, saying, ``Are you
having a heart attack?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Lou said. ``My car did.''
</P>
<P>
   Then another car, with another woman behind the wheel, showed
up.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not having a heart attack,'' the first woman said to the
second.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the first time I got such attention from the ladies
simply by standing on the sidewalk,'' Lou says.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
TRUCKLOADS OF HELP &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After the women left, a truck pulled over. A husky construction
worker hopped out and asked Lou if there was anything he could do.
</P>
<P>
   No sooner did Lou thank the man for his trouble, and see him
off, when another truck stopped, this one filled with men employed
by a local lawn service.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted to help me, somehow, though I don't know how
because they all spoke Spanish and I don't,'' Lou says. ``All we
could do was point and nod at each other, but I got them to
understand I was OK, and to say thanks.''
</P>
<P>
   Then a police officer arrived.
</P>
<P>
   He was from Scottsdale, although technically Lou's car had
broken down in the adjoining town of Paradise Valley. Lou told the
officer he was fine. After the Scottsdale officer left, another
arrived from Paradise Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Then, after he left, a sergeant from the Paradise Valley force
arrived.
</P>
<P>
   When he was gone, a young woman pulled over and offered Lou a
cold bottle of water, which he accepted with gratitude. Then,
another young woman stopped by, telling Lou, ``Don't worry, help is
on the way.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wondered, `What help?' '' Lou says. ``I was waiting for a
tow truck. Then, I hear the siren.''
</P>
<P>
   In the distance, cruising up Scottsdale Road toward him, Lou
spotted a firetruck and an ambulance.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
HAPPY MAN, GOOD NEWS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``In one half-hour, I watched the people of this Valley, who act
like strangers to each other, turn into real people,'' Lou says.
``Later, I told Adele the whole experience made me feel like I
could die a happy man.''
</P>
<P>
   His wife is nearby listening, as she has for 57 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``These days, the only news we get on TV and read on the front
page of the newspaper is really bad news,'' she says. ``We're old
enough to know that these are not good times, to remember when
people were kinder to one another.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In my days as a traveling man, I developed into a loner,'' Lou
says. ``But I also learned to say, `Can I help you?' That's my
religion. I don't classify myself by any denomination. I stick out
my hand and say, `Can I help you?' This time, I got it in return.''
</P>
<P>
   He hadn't expected it.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's all the bad news in the papers and on TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' Lou says, ``I'd just like it if, maybe, you
could find an inch of space in the paper where the man with the
gray beard stranded at Scottsdale Road and Vista could thank all
the lovely people who stopped to help him.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not the kind of thing that makes the front page. Lou and
Adele are right about that. There's no way a small good deed is
going to make headlines or get a person's face on TV news.
Everybody knows that. Everybody.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, all those people stopped. &QL;

   SANTA MONICA, Calif. _ Just outside the security door to the
Symantec Antivirus Research Center here is a wall-length mural
depicting engineers like those inside as superhumans and film noir
detectives.
</P>
<P>
   SARC is part of the Symantec Corp., a computer utilities and
antivirus protection company, which recently published a
promotional comic book called ``Sarcman,'' extending the theme of
virus fighters.
</P>
<P>
   After ``the evil virus vixen'' has threatened the world's
computers, Sarcman, in silver visor and sky-blue cape, flies in,
analyzes the vixen's code and then _ Pow! Zap! _ saves the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of them are that easy,'' said Carey Nachenberg, the
center's chief researcher.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the corner laboratory on the second floor of the
offices in Santa Monica could not be further from Metropolis. The
laboratory is a large, bright room in which rows of personal
computers sit on metal racks like cages of puppies in a pet shop.
On a recent Saturday, a few people spoke over the hum of computers
and the low roar of high-capacity air conditioners needed to cool
them.
</P>
<P>
   But this laboratory is also the hub of a global collection of
smaller Symantec laboratories that 24 hours a day, seven days a
week, study the world's thousands of computer viruses and fashion
immunizations against them.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the laboratory in Santa Monica there is hardly ever an
hour when some software engineer is not hunched over a keyboard
peering into a computer monitor for clues to understanding and then
dispatching the latest computer virus that just might, if
unchecked, disable millions of computers around the world with its
malevolent programming.
</P>
<P>
   Nachenberg, 27, is one of those engineers. Chatty and
irreverent, he lives and dreams the challenge of beating back the
mounting threat of computer viruses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really enjoy my work,'' he said. ``It's really creative.''
</P>
<P>
   He has worked at the center since he graduated from the
University of California at Los Angeles in 1995. His master's
thesis on computer virus detection has yielded a number of
antivirus technologies used by the Symantec Corporation, based in
Cupertino.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he and the 42 other members of the center team have had
their share of all-night emergency sessions and crisis calls when
word of some new, highly resistant strain of computer virus reached
the center.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most notable cases arose last December when he was
away on a trip to the San Francisco Bay area. His cellular phone
rang. It was the home office. Computers belonging to a corporate
customer were being wrecked by a nasty virus called Remote
Explorer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to come in Christmas to produce a fix,'' Nachenberg
said. ``We worked around the clock.''
</P>
<P>
   For virus hunters, this year has been particularly troublesome.
There are currently more than 36,500 known computer viruses in the
world, an explosive rise since the first viruses were discovered in
1986. And that number continues to mount, at a rate of 10 to 15 new
viruses every day, said Vincent M. Weafer, director of the center.
</P>
<P>
   And though some computer viruses are the products of mutating
program code and, more rarely, computer viruses mating, the
majority of viruses are the handiwork of people. Studies indicate
that most virus writers are male and between ages 14 and 24. And
they come from almost anywhere in the world. Current hot spots for
virus writing are India, New Zealand, Australia and the United
States, virus experts say.
</P>
<P>
   The viruses are also becoming more dangerous to computer users.
In 1993 only about 10 percent of known viruses were considered
destructive, harming files and hard drives. But now about 35
percent are regarded as harmful, according to Symantec.
</P>
<P>
   The Computer Emergency Response Team at Carnegie Mellon
University in Pittsburgh said most viruses were intended to annoy
computer users, not to cripple systems. There are, however, viruses
that are aimed at deleting files and doing real harm, said Quinn
Peyton, technology coordinator for the response team's incident
handling group. ``We have not seen many of those, but they do
exist,'' Peyton said.
</P>
<P>
   Tracking and destroying computer viruses is a laborious and
exacting business, antivirus engineers say. At the Symantec offices
in Santa Monica, automation is used to weed out the routine
viruses. The identifying characteristics of the thousands of
viruses and their cures, called definitions, are kept on a special
data base that is shipped to Symantec customers every week, said
Weafer, the director.
</P>
<P>
   When computer users find suspected viruses in their computers
they are, if they are using Symantec antivirus products, encouraged
to send the viruses to the center. Tens of thousands of suspect
diskettes have flooded the center over the years. Beginning last
summer, Symantec clients began sending in suspect files by way of
the Internet, Weafer said.
</P>
<P>
   Once they arrive, computers automatically analyze the
submissions. If they are among those Symantec has seen before, a
remedy is sent back to the user to stop the virus, often
accomplished in less than 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   But when a file turns up with a new strain of virus, the
engineers are called into action. They examine the programming code
of the virus, looking at its logic _ its unique sequence of ones
and zeros that control its behavior and how it replicates (and all
viruses, by definition, replicate) _ and whether it does harm,
Nachenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   When the virus' method of operation becomes clear, often after
infecting one or more of the center's racks of test computers and
mock computer networks, engineers establish its characteristics,
known as a fingerprint. A software repair is fashioned to remove it
from files like some kind of digital wonder drug.
</P>
<P>
   Today, people like Nachenberg look at the new strains. In
August, SARC is planning to let new computer systems take over much
of this work so people can spend their time anticipating virus
threats, Nachenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   While the antivirus center appears like a well-scrubbed
laboratory one might find at the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention in Atlanta, the tedium of cracking computer viruses is
often broken with the sound of classic rock or techno music blaring
from a lab boom box, or engineers simply wired by headphones to
their personal stereos.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the stuff is a little redundant,'' said Sherralee
Buzzell, who is a company liaison between Symantec customers and
engineers. ``They have to watch files as they load, then wait to
see their response times. And they spend a lot of time looking
through a file.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Weafer, the director, dressed in the unofficial company uniform
of beige cotton slacks, casual shoes and a green knit, open-collar
shirt emblazoned with the company's name over his heart, said he
held no illusions about what he and his team did every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we see it as glamorous, as the guys running in
with the virus suits,'' he said. ``We do see ourselves as the
protector of the customers. If we have a big customer who's got a
virus issue, it is very serious for them. We saw a couple of cases
this year where they had to shut down their e-mail systems and that
impacts on their business.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Chernobyl virus, which caused hundreds of thousands of
computer meltdowns around the world in April, was hardly able to
get a foothold in the United States, he said, because his team ran
across it last year in Taiwan. A former computer engineering
student in Taiwan was identified as the author of the virus.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of being able to respond really fast has helped,''
Weafer said.

<P>
   The first virus known to hit personal computers was called the
Brain. Distributed via floppy disks in the mid-1980's, the Brain
was relatively innocuous and easy to track. Today, there are an
estimated 40,000 computer viruses, many far more harmful. Here are
some recent viruses; all of them can be blocked by anti-virus
software.
</P>
<P>
   Chernobyl
</P>
<P>
   HOW IT WORKS: Gets in via e-mail, floppies or downloaded
software. The virus attacks Windows 95 and 98 files, overwriting a
computer's hard drive. The date April 26 _ the Chernobyl disaster
anniversary _ triggers it.
</P>
<P>
   IMPACT: As many as one million computers in Southeast Asia were
hit by Chernobyl on April 26. Hundreds of attacks were reported in
the United States. Many more computers may have since picked up the
virus.
</P>
<P>
   STATUS: Authorities in Taiwan identified a computer-engineering
student at the Tatung Institute of Technology as the virus' author.
His college punished him by giving him demerits, but he has not
been charged with any crime.
</P>
<P>
   Melissa
</P>
<P>
   HOW IT WORKS: Makes its way into computers as an e-mail
attachment and then sends itself around the Internet using
addresses found in a recipient's computerized address book. Can
infect Word and Excel documents.
</P>
<P>
   IMPACT: More than 100,000 computers affected worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   STATUS: Prosecutors in New Jersey have accused David L. Smith, a
computer programmer from Aberdeen, N.J., of writing and sending out
the virus. Smith has pleaded not guilty.
</P>
<P>
   Happy99
</P>
<P>
   HOW IT WORKS: Often arrives via e-mail, infecting computers once
it is executed or run. To the user, the program looks like an
animated fireworks graphic. But it can destroy data and make public
confidential files from your computer.
</P>
<P>
   IMPACT: Possibly tens of thousands of computers affected. Steven
Trilling, director of research for Symantec's Antivirus Research
Center, said his center had more than 3,000 messages from people
submitting the virus.
</P>
<P>
   STATUS: Author unknown.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Outside the windows of the Steinway &AMP; Sons piano
factory in Queens, ventilators blow petals of wood shavings into
the air, creating what looks like a light snowfall all year round.
Down a hallway of administrative offices, several doors feature
bumper stickers crowing ``I Love Wood.''
</P>
<P>
   Steinway is a company devoutly committed to the craft of
woodworking. Many of its 600 employees arrived at the factory as
teen-agers, and in the course of their tenures there _ some decades
long _ have become masters at molding, chiseling, shaping and
bending some of a Steinway grand piano's 12,000 parts.
</P>
<P>
   Steinway calls each piano it builds ``a handmade work of art,''
and the number of instruments it produces each year (2,500 grands
and 500 uprights) remains more or less unchanged from 100 years
ago. In fact, much of the sprawling, 440,000-square-foot factory
looks as it might have 100 years ago. During a recent midmorning
break, a worker napped, sprawled across a cast-iron veneer-cutting
machine whose curlicued latticework reveals its industrial-age
origins, though it is still used today. The sun streamed down
through skylights onto hardwood floors that would be wildly out of
place in many a highly trafficked, modern factory.
</P>
<P>
   Yet little by little, technology has been wending its way onto
the factory floor, helping the wood crafters do their jobs _ not
necessarily faster, but certainly more efficiently and with greater
precision. Although most parts are still assembled by hand,
computer-run climate control rooms, chip-driven multipurpose
machines and three-dimensional measuring arms are also entering the
process.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not at the point where we're pulling switches and
watching parts come out the other end,'' said Steinway president
and chief executive Bruce Stevens. ``It still takes us a year to
craft one of these things. But technology is assisting us in making
more precise parts that our people can assemble. It's helping us
create a better instrument.''
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate consumers _ the players and the listeners _ may
notice these innovations in small ways; whether the changes have
made a difference in how Steinway pianos sound and feel to the
touch is debatable. Although many artists and technicians say that
Steinway pianos are built more solidly and reliably now than in
years past, some say that increased reliability has led to a slight
drop in the number of quirks that make each piano unique.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're getting better,'' said pianist Emanuel Ax, who
has been playing almost exclusively on Steinway concert grands for
more than 25 years. ``The best Steinways have always been pretty
fabulous, but for a time there you were finding one good one in a
number of not so good ones. Now there's a lot less variability
between pianos. There are still differences in sound quality _ some
are brighter, some are not as bright _ but they're all a notch
better than they were.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevens, who described his job as ``a love affair with culture,
history and tradition,'' said the company was achieving a balance
between handicraft and technology-driven processes. ``But we're
careful not to sacrifice the quality of our instrument for the
expediency of modern technology,'' added Stevens, who, like many of
the company's executives, has a Steinway grand piano in his living
room, which he tinkers with but does not play.
</P>
<P>
   A Steinway grand piano is 85 percent wood. And like other
companies heavily involved in woodwork, Steinway treats the
different species of wood that go into its pianos with painstaking
care. Each temperamental piece, for instance, requires long periods
of time to dry in warm, dark rooms, or it will become too
``stressed'' to work with.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it is hard rock maple (used to build the inner and outer
rims of a grand piano), Alaskan sitka spruce (used for the
soundboards) or East Indian rosewood (used for exterior veneers),
all of Steinway's raw lumber is dried to a moisture level of 6
percent to make it suitable for building. A 6 percent moisture
level insures that the final product, whether it resides in a
living room in Florida or a concert hall in New York, won't warp,
blister or splinter because of stresses in the wood. Because
Steinway is focused to the point of obsession on the moisture
levels of its wood, for the last several years the company been
developing new ways to tightly control the drying process with
computers.
</P>
<P>
   When a load of 30,000 board feet of hard rock maple arrives from
a Vermont sawmill, for example, it is air-dried under sheets of
clear plastic in a lumberyard next to the employee parking lot for
several months, in a process little changed by technology. The wood
then goes inside a large kiln, where it is spread out, and a
combination of steam, temperature and ventilation systems continues
the slow drying process.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, computer-driven machinery enters the picture. The
drying kiln is controlled by a programmable logic controller, or
PLC, located in a room adjacent to the kiln. The controller makes
automatic adjustments to the temperature and humidity in the room.
</P>
<P>
   Once the maple reaches the magical 6 percent moisture level, it
is cut into laminates measuring 6 inches wide, 3 16 -inch deep and
8 to 10 feet long, depending on the size of the grand piano.
(Steinway makes five sizes of grand piano, with the smallest, the
Model S baby grand, measuring 5 feet 2 inches in length, and the
largest, the Model D concert grand, measuring almost 9 feet.)
</P>
<P>
   The laminates are then taken to the rim processing department on
the second floor. This department creates the grand piano's frame,
or rim, with its characteristic left-hand straight edge giving way
to an elegant curve down the right.
</P>
<P>
   Steinway takes special care with its rims, which encircle the
action, hammers, strings, soundboard, tuning pins and other
interior parts of the piano. The entire circumference of a rim is
made of stacks of two or three long pieces of high-grade maple
laminate, carefully joined at the edges.
</P>
<P>
   Steinway presses about 11 rims each day. During the process,
which takes about 20 minutes, department foreman Raphael D'Alleva
(a 38-year Steinway employee who is known for only three cracked
rims in his career) and six other men stand in a line as the
laminates emerge one on top of another from a glue applicator on a
conveyor belt. When the 18th layer is aligned, the ``book'' of
glued laminates looks like a giant wafer candy bar with caramel
seeping between the layers. The six men then hoist the finished
book over their shoulders and carry it over to the piano-shaped rim
press, where they align it and bang it into the clamps with big red
hammers.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Once the glue sets, the rim is taken to one of the factory's 13
conditioning rooms for a minimum of eight weeks. Programmable logic
controllers in each room contain input and output sensors that
adjust the temperature and humidity levels every five minutes. All
the controllers are connected to a 75-megahertz Pentium PC in a
glass-enclosed office about 50 yards away. By looking at the
computer screen, a supervisor can control even the slightest
variations in temperature and humidity. If the system goes down
(which it occasionally does), the supervisor must go to each room,
check its wet- and dry-bulb thermometers and make adjustments
manually.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of eight weeks, the rim is able to withstand up to
45,000 pounds of tension from the strings that will be put inside
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take drying very seriously,'' said Robert Berger, director
of quality for Steinway. ``Monitoring the conditioning rooms from a
central computer allows us to make micro adjustments constantly. It
helps us avoid going into one of the rooms and saying, `Oh, wow,
this room's been going out of control for a couple of hours now,'
which used to happen on occasion.''
</P>
<P>
   In other areas of the factory, ``machining centers'' _ machines,
driven by programmable logic controllers, that contain
microprocessors and can be ordered to perform several different
repetitive jobs _ are replacing manually operated machines that
perform one function at a time. That is the case particularly in
the action department, the part of the factory that makes wooden
shapes that measure no more than a few inches and look as though
they belong in Santa's toy sack. Of the 85 different machines used
to build the piano's action, about 10 of them are run by
programmable logic controllers, said Chris Arena, a supervisor in
the department.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the older machines, you're relying on an operator with 30
years' experience to reset switches if you want to reprogram it,''
he said. ``Even then, there's a danger that if something's running
incorrectly, he won't be able to stop it in enough time to avoid
damage to the machine. With the PLC machines, we can make
adjustments in a snap by programming changes.'' As a result, Arena
said, the tolerances in the parts have decreased, and fewer parts
are being thrown away.
</P>
<P>
   Computer-operated measuring devices used in the quality
department are making it significantly easier to measure
hard-to-reach locations and unwieldy curves like the treble arc, a
sinuous curve that runs down the right-hand side of a grand piano.
Jimmy Argenziano, an engineer who has worked in Steinway's quality
department for four years, uses a portable coordinate measurement
machine to inspect the cast-iron plates to which the strings are
attached before they are put into the rims and wound with string. A
sort of three-dimensional mouse that hooks up to a portable laptop,
the measurement machine looks like a telescope and is shaped like a
human arm, with joints at the shoulder, elbow and wrist.
</P>
<P>
   By rotating the arm of the machine to different points around
the plate, Argenziano can make sure that the plate's dimensions
stay perfectly consistent with the contours of the piano rim. He
also downloads the coordinates into his laptop, where they are used
to create engineering drawings. Before he got the measurement
machine (which he first read about in a trade journal about six
months ago), Argenziano used two-dimensional measurement tools like
height gauges, calipers and rulers. ``I was crawling around on my
belly, doing things the hard way,'' he said. ``What used to take me
hours, even days, now takes me about 10 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Discussing the effects of the changes, another performer, Barry
Douglas, said that more than 10 years ago, certain Steinways might
have been right for playing only certain kinds of music. ``You
could argue that the older Steinways had a more individualistic
type of tone and voicing within each piano,'' Douglas said. ``One
might have had a certain deep sound that made it perfect for
playing pieces from the Romantic period.''
</P>
<P>
   Because many of these innovations are still relatively new, it
remains to be seen whether they'll enable Steinway to speed
production. In most cases, it takes several months between the time
a Steinway piano is ordered and the time it shows up on the
doorstep. According to a report from the Piano Manufacturers
Association International, Steinway produced and sold fewer than 10
percent of the 28,356 grand pianos sold in the United States in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   But building more pianos is not a high priority for the company.
``We're still very much a handcrafted instrument, and I don't think
we will ever get away from that,'' Berger said. ``The technology
we're developing now gives us some amazing abilities in terms of
machining, but there are still many aspects of piano making that
are better done by human hands.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ You could smell the plywood at the Library of
Congress in Washington, where ``The Work of Charles and Ray Eames:
A Legacy of Invention'' recently opened. At the exhibition of the
two American designers' multifaceted achievement, the cheap board
they made beautiful has a fresh, resourceful smell that makes you
believe anything is possible _ because the world might be as
pliable as new plywood.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd was thick with people in their 20s and 30s,
discovering the Eameses' sculptural midcentury furniture and the
inventive assemblages of domestic artifacts from their 1949
prefabricated house in Pacific Palisades, Calif., which embodied
their inspiring intentions. As the show's banner graphics
explained, the Eameses ``aimed to improve society.''
</P>
<P>
   The notions that innovatively designed and economically
accessible objects like home furnishings could be ambassadors of
cultural change, that elegance can be ordinary and that being
serious can be fun, are still radical. They registered visibly for
a new audience trying the chairs or watching the flowers and toys
spin on the screens that displayed the designers' entertaining
educational films.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoa! That's nana's chair!'' a young man with a surfer's bob
of hair and neck beads said to his girlfriend as they approached
the famous rosewood lounge chair and ottoman ``that everyone in the
family is scoping out!'' Holding hands, they stood before it as if
it were the edge of the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   At the four-day International Contemporary Furniture Fair in New
York at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in May, the nation's
most comprehensive exhibition of contemporary home design, emotions
ran drier.
</P>
<P>
   Design is enjoying a moment in the sun, thanks to lots of
fashionable press. But it was hard to believe that the next team of
Eameses might have been at the 1999 fair.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, there were stylish versions of everything fashionable
during the last few years: versions of minimal, cubistic, wenge
wood boutique-hotel fittings; versions of the bamboo-Bauhaus,
Asian-inflected interiors that designers build for rock stars'
vacation homes in Bali; versions of the Scandinavian 1960s, the
Italian 1970s, the Los Angeles architectural 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Off-site, there was a vigorous circuit of parties as New York's
design community played host to the trade and the fashionably
curious. At Cappellini Modern Age on Wooster Street, there were
twin muscle men in black T-shirts, velvet roping arrivals at the
door. At Troy on Greene Street, linen-shirted guests dipping frites
in mayonnaise sat at Maarten Van Severen's severe tables beneath
his police-station-style lighting, like people being interrogated.
</P>
<P>
   But at the end of the day, the decade, the century, the
millennium, tough thinking about the direction of design and its
power of solution was in short supply, which is too bad. Enthusiasm
for the subject has never been stronger. Does design still have a
mission? Should it? The Eames show and the furniture fair were an
opportunity to consider the market for contemporary design and the
relevance of its promise.
</P>
<P>
   Designers, manufacturers and retailers agree that the audience
is growing, with a new generation of furniture buyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The consumer is demanding more design,'' said Gary Friedman,
president of retail for Williams-Sonoma, the parent company of
Pottery Barn, whose sales in 1998 exceeded $550 million, an
increase of 37 percent over the previous year. ``People have been
subliminally educated about design by advertising, the Internet,
everything they enjoy, from snowboarding to music videos.''
</P>
<P>
   David Shearer, the owner of Totem, a Tribeca gallery
specializing in provocative designs, said: ``There's a trendiness
to design right now. We're getting a more-average customer.''
Totem, which also has a catalog and wholesale business, is close to
$2 million in annual sales, an increase of 40 percent over last
year. ``Twenty-five percent of our orders are going to the middle
of the country,'' Shearer said.
</P>
<P>
   Contemporary home furnishings design has entered the equation of
stylish living, sharing younger consumers' attention with fashion
and travel. With that has come pressure to make it less elite, more
affordable and more accessible. Even flea-marketing, which
introduced a younger audience to modern design, is running thin as
an inexpensive outlet.
</P>
<P>
   Crate and Barrel, with sales approaching $200 million in 1998,
is experimenting with a lower-cost brand for younger consumers,
very much like the Gap's Old Navy chain, which analysts predict may
surpass Gap stores in sales in the next two years. Crate and
Barrel's first Generations X through Y store, tentatively called
Blueprint, will open in Chicago in August. Pottery Barn has similar
plans on the drawing board.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously there's something for everyone to learn from Old
Navy,'' Friedman said. ``If you look at Pottery Barn's
demographics, which is people with incomes of $75,000 and above,
it's not catering to 65 percent of the population. There's a huge
opportunity there.''
</P>
<P>
   The large retailers, frequently accused of generic design that
will sell to the widest group through the lowest common
denominators, are bolstering their credentials by putting new
designers on the payroll. Pottery Barn has tripled its in-house
design department, to more than 30 employees, in the last year and
has introduced signature lines by designers like Jonathan Adler,
whose work reflects the popularity of the 1950s and '60s.
Williams-Sonoma last year hired Peri Wolfman, a New York retailer,
as vice president for product design. In May, Eric Pfeiffer, 30,
the founder of Bravo 20, a design business based in San Francisco,
was made the consulting creative director of Hold Everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've realized the bar had to go up on esthetics,'' Pfeiffer
said, speaking at Bravo 20's booth at the furniture fair. ``Simple,
clean, modern is the in thing.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Within the last 15 years, the system of the few dozen
independent stores that sold contemporary design, often isolated in
their mid-size cities, has been challenged.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've noticed larger companies walking the aisles, approaching
you to see how you can help them _ Target, Crate and Barrel, the
big-box retailers,'' Pfeiffer said. ``It was all about price. Now
design is the hook.''
</P>
<P>
   Kmart has Martha Stewart's Everyday, a brisk, administrative
line of coordinating taste, which is expanding into furniture.
Target, which hired the architect Michael Graves to design
household products, is now talking with Blu Dot, a young furniture
company based in Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Target's furniture buyers are younger than their typical
buyers,'' John Christakos, one of Blu Dot's principals, said.
``They're teen-agers or college kids _ young apartment dwellers.
And when big companies try to do products for young people, it's
like your father using a slang word. It doesn't come out right.''
</P>
<P>
   At the higher end of the market, design galleries are branching
out like more traditional retailers. Totem will open a second store
this fall in New York and one in Los Angeles. Salon Moderne in Soho
will open a new store, Property, in September. Moss on Greene
Street has taken the space next door. Format, showcasing Italian
manufacturers, opened on Wooster Street in May, the latest European
arrival to Soho.
</P>
<P>
   The new design stores are also Internet-based businesses,
erasing the boundaries of the market and making it available to
anyone looking for it, especially young customers in small towns.
(With prophetic fit, the Eameses are on line, too, through their
manufacturer. Web site transactions account for 20 percent of
Herman Miller's Home Collection sales.)
</P>
<P>
   Fashion _ the industry credited with helping make contemporary
furniture fashionable _ might be expected to take it forward. Donna
Karan's new 17,000-square-foot Madison Avenue store will sell
household products by Droog, a Dutch group interested in the
intellectual edge of design, in addition to two new home Donna
Karan lines. The Prada store, opening in SoHo, will also have a
substantial furnishings collection.
</P>
<P>
   But despite availability, popularity and an increasingly
sophisticated set of references, this visitor to the 1999 fair
found design's sense of leadership sadly missing among the largely
fashionable furniture.
</P>
<P>
   Gary McNatton, a senior vice president of Gap and creative
director of home design for Banana Republic, agreed: ``The '90s
were a lost decade. We went retro. Nothing happened. You look at
the masters, like the Eameses. It gives you a true appreciation of
what design has to give.''
</P>
<P>
   With its prospects improving, contemporary furniture might
reasonably be called upon to develop a vision that looks forward,
not backward, and that trades on ideas, not attitudes. During the
fair, many designers said that new materials and new technologies,
not unlike the legacy of the Eameses, were the unseen elements of
this decade's design, not new shapes.
</P>
<P>
   But with its success, the profession could easily lose its
nerve.
</P>
<P>
   What prevailed at the fair were fashion statements, not design
solutions. The historical moment has moved away from the postwar
American recovery that the Eameses helped galvanize with good
design. But practical issues of affordable, multifunctional
furnishings are as relevant to a young professional generation now,
living under the pressures of late-20th-century life, as they were
to a country constructing the future of peace 50 years ago _ and
eager for the best ways to do it. Purpose can be adventurous;
change can accommodate comfort.
</P>
<P>
   Davan Joy of USDA, a California design collective that exhibited
at a temporary gallery space on Grand Street as part of ``G7,'' a
collaborative of seven American designers who chose not to
participate in the fair, put his finger on the problem for both
designers and their public.
</P>
<P>
   As he waited with his colleagues to have his picture taken for
Harper's Bazaar _ Wallpaper was working on its shoot in the
background _ Joy said, ``Everybody needs to take a little bit more
of a risk.'' &QL;

UNDATED: Harris, agrees. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Even then, he was writing for crime magazines and men's
magazines,'' Blackman says. ``It was pretty clear he had loftier
ambitions for his writing.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris married; he and his wife lived in Hubbard, outside of
Waco. They had a daughter but eventually divorced.
</P>
<P>
   After working several years at the Waco newspaper, Harris was
hired by the AP in New York. His drinking companions say young
Tom's editor in Waco was not much impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``In six months,'' the editor predicted, ``you'll be coming back
here with your tail between your legs, asking for your old job
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite everything, the question remains: Why is Tom Harris not
talking?
</P>
<P>
   ``He is just naturally shy,'' says Sam Maull, a friend from his
AP days in New York. ``He doesn't seek the limelight. ... He feels
his work speaks for itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Kelly, another of his former New York colleagues, agrees.
But Kelly says Harris never liked to ``meddle'' in other people's
personal lives and, in turn, probably doesn't want to surrender his
own privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the only explanation I can give,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The second question we'd ask Thomas Harris is who or what
inspired him to create Hannibal Lecter. Sometimes characters in
books are thinly disguised clones of the authors, but that's
clearly not the case with this author and this character.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Tom Kelly had some funny thoughts while reading
``Lambs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As I kept reading, I kept thinking to myself, this isn't the
same guy. Then I thought ... well, if it is the same guy, maybe
that's why he's so quiet.''
</P>
<P>
   Laughing, he says he decided Harris really is an oddball: ``I'm
not going to let him stay in my house overnight.''
</P>
<P>
   What's more, Kelly, now the spokesman for the Metropolitan
Transportation Authority, concluded that the writer and his made-up
monster actually do have some things in common.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw the `Lambs' movie and how (Lecter) was portrayed by
Anthony Hopkins, he reminded me of Tom,'' Kelly says. ``He did in
the sense he was so even-tempered, so almost removed from himself.
In some of those scenes, (Lecter's) dry wit made me turn to my wife
and say, `That's Tom Harris.'''
</P>
<P>
   Friends insist that Harris had but one major wish: to get a book
contract big enough to allow him to lie on the beach in Mexico, sip
cocktails and never answer a phone.
</P>
<P>
   Harris and two of his AP buddies on the night shift, Sam Maull
and Dick Riley, set the dream in motion in the early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by ``Naked Came the Stranger,'' a bestselling novel
written as a joke by staff members of the daily paper Newsday,
Maull, Riley and Harris decided to collaborate on a novel of their
own.
</P>
<P>
   ``We exchanged ideas about it, about what characters we would
have and the plot,'' Maull says. ``We all did the research. After
we got into it, Tom sort of took the lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the final analysis, he was the one who whipped it into
shape.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris left the AP to complete the project that became ``Black
Sunday,'' and was listed on the dust jacket as the sole author. But
royalties were split among the three journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after ``Black Sunday'' was published, Hollywood snapped up
the movie rights.
</P>
<P>
   Harris now had the money to go lie on a beach and drink, but he
appears to have chosen New York's Long Island over Mexico. And
obviously he continued writing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a demonic hard worker,'' Maull says. ``I can't emphasize
that enough. He was good at helping relatively young writers out,
showing them how to put together a story. I, myself, was a
beneficiary of that. ... As far as interacting with other human
beings, he has almost no faults at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly says Harris did have his ``ornery moments.'' The most
notable occurred one evening as the two were working the 4
p.m.-midnight shift in the AP's New York City bureau.
</P>
<P>
   A deadly hostage situation developed in a Brooklyn gun shop, and
much of Manhattan and most of the available AP staff were caught up
in the saga.
</P>
<P>
   At midnight, when their shift ended, Harris and co-worker Walter
Stovall got up to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom, you can't abandon me now, pal,'' protested Kelly, the
supervisor that night. ``There's cops all over the place, and these
people are demanding an airplane.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time for cocktails,'' Harris replied coolly.
</P>
<P>
   While this was not quite as cavalier as it sounds, Kelly sensed
a potential dilemma.
</P>
<P>
   So he called the nearby Pig &AMP; Whistle bar and ordered a bottle
of Jack Daniels whiskey delivered to the office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not drinking out of a paper cup,'' Harris announced
grandly.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly ordered glasses and setups.
</P>
<P>
   Harris and Stovall stayed and helped work the story to a
conclusion. The next morning, Kelly was confronted by ``his'' boss
about the empty whiskey bottle and dirty glasses. Harris listened
in bemused silence until the bureau chief finished raking Kelly
over the coals and stormed off, then commented:
</P>
<P>
   ``No good deed goes unpunished.''
</P>
<P>
   And then, as he himself left that morning, Harris paused at the
door, turned to Kelly and said with a smile: ``I bet you don't have
the guts to put it on your expense account.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, really, doesn't that sound like Hannibal Lecter?

AGENTS PROVOCATEURS: WHY WE BONDED WITH THE SQUAD OF '60S
SUPERSPIES
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanied by SPY FILMS-LIST) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The words sound like the latest piece of punditry decrying the
state of the entertainment industry. But they come from the early
'60s, when James Bond creator Ian Fleming commented on the
popularity of the earliest Bond movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live in a violent era,'' Fleming once said. ``As for sex,
seduction to a marked extent has replaced courtship.''
</P>
<P>
   Fleming, who died in 1964, didn't know the half of it. Spies
were fodder for entertainment long before ``Dr. No,'' the first
Bond movie, debuted in 1962. And spy entertainment continues to be
popular, as evidenced by the anticipated success of Mike Myers'
spoof ``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,'' opening Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The current resurgence in spy-movie popularity, however, has
nothing on the '60s fad, and the craze only got more manic after
Fleming died. Bond clones abounded, from James Coburn's Derek Flint
to Dean Martin's Matt Helm. ``The Man From U.N.C.L.E.'' was just
the beginning of a flood of TV spies. Spies entered the Top 40,
with Shirley Bassey's ``Goldfinger'' and Johnny Rivers' ``Secret
Agent Man.'' They even infiltrated advertising, the most ludicrous
example featuring Los Angeles Dodgers star pitcher Don Drysdale as
a sudsy spy for Lifebuoy soap. Bond-influenced products ranged from
gadgety toys to a line of 007 colognes.
</P>
<P>
   Ask espionage-entertainment aficionados what made spies so hot
in the '60s and you're likely to get a variety of answers, few of
which resemble Fleming's comment. They all come back to three
words, though:
</P>
<P>
   Bond. James Bond.
</P>
<P>
   ``He appealed to the devil in every man,'' said Lee Pfeiffer,
author of ``Essential Bond.'' ``He was selfish when it came to his
own needs. He always got the best women, went to the most exotic
places.''
</P>
<P>
   Pfeiffer, who also publishes a spy-entertainment Webzine called
Secret Intelligence (www.secretintel.com), credits the success of
the Bond books to Fleming's real-life experiences as a British spy
in World War II. The movies, however, succeeded because of how
``little'' they reflected real life. The Cold War was at its peak,
but espionage in the Bond films had more to do with glamour than
global tensions. Although a Bond supervillain might be vaguely
Russian or Chinese, he would always be independently bent on world
domination, usually from some impregnable island fortress. And with
each new movie, it seemed like the series itself was trying harder
to rule the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Producer Cubby Broccoli continued to put more and more into
the Bond movies,'' Pfeiffer said. ``He never fell victim to what I
call the `Planet of the Apes' syndrome, that is, spending less on
each succeeding movie. He always wanted more exotic locations and
more exotic villains.''
</P>
<P>
   Broccoli's strategy worked, and the Bond series took off with
the third and fourth entries, ``Goldfinger'' (1964) and
``Thunderball,'' which came out in 1965, the year that secret-agent
mania peaked. Most of the spy-oriented TV series debuted that year,
as did many of the Bond-knockoff movies. The Beatles even got into
the act, with the spy-influenced plot of the 1965 movie ``Help!''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Giblin, editor and head writer for ``Secret Intelligence,''
says he believes that the 1965 spy-entertainment explosion was a
coincidence, a result of the cyclical nature of fads. But he
acknowledges that other factors might have been at work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hadn't yet become as jaded by things like Vietnam and the
'68 assassinations,'' Giblin said recently. ``Bond's imitators
seemed silly (after those events), when before they could be
tolerated, even enjoyed, as we craved that kind of escapist
entertainment.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that that stopped silliness from permeating the genre _ but
knockoffs and parodies such as ``Our Man Flint'' and Dean Martin's
four Matt Helm movies had short shelf lives.
</P>
<P>
   MORE nn
</P>
<P>
   ``These movies didn't last because they were cheap imitations,''
said Patrick Macnee, a spy aficionado who played John Steed in the
'60s spy series ``The Avengers.'' ``They became campier. It was all
an imitation of much better material.'' Even Bond became campy,
with the overblown 1967 parody ``Casino Royale.''
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, Myers managed to successfully parody this
self-parodying era with 1997's ``Austin Powers: International Man
of Mystery.'' Powers, a bad-haired, bad-toothed, bespectacled,
lascivious superspy, bears little resemblance to the ultra-cool
Bond. Powers is probably closest in spirit to Matt Helm, easily the
randiest spy of the secret-agent era, although his glasses are
almost definitely a nod to Harry Palmer, a more serious, sardonic
movie spy.
</P>
<P>
   What the Powers movies reflect best, however, is the mod culture
of mid- to late-'60s London, which worked its way into many of the
spy movies. For the uninitiated, Powers was a '60s spy who was
cryogenically frozen and then thawed out in the '90s, when his
decidedly unliberated ways clashed with a more politically correct
era. In ``The Spy Who Shagged Me,'' Powers travels back in time to
groovy, fashion-conscious '60s London. The difference between
Powers and his cinematic counterparts, though, is that Powers
himself is mod.
</P>
<P>
   ``These male spies of the '60s probably weren't mod because it
was still a new movement, and perhaps was considered too trendy for
Hollywood to cast (its) leading male spies as mod,'' said Lyn
FitzGerald, creator of the Web site Fab Fashions of the Swinging
Sixties (www.geocities.com/FashionAvenue/5362). ``It is interesting
to note that the female spies in TV and film of the time, however,
`were' mod. Female spies were portrayed as great followers of
fashion as well as cunning spies, and the fashion of the day was
mod.''
</P>
<P>
   The fashion of the day barely made it to the early '70s, though,
and was replaced in part by the hippie movement, which never would
have fit into spy films. Similarly, the spy movies fell out of
fashion, the result of a glut of films both serious (''The Spy Who
Came in From the Cold'') and goofy (far too many to mention here).
</P>
<P>
   Bond, however, somehow never came in from the cold, and many
fans never thought the series was the same after Connery left to
make way for the cheekier Roger Moore and the darker Timothy Dalton
(an underrated Bond who was the closest in spirit to Fleming's
original). Pierce Brosnan, the current Bond, has been a commercial
success, although many Bondphiles find him too blandly pretty for
the role. He'll get his third chance to prove himself when the
latest Bond, ``The World Is Not Enough,'' comes out in November.
</P>
<P>
   Non-Bond spy movies have continued since the '60s, of course,
but they've tended to be more sobersided and reflective of their
eras. Post-Watergate spy films in particular, especially Francis
Coppola's ``The Conversation,'' took a more serious, coldhearted
look at the subject of invading privacy. Last year's ``Enemy of the
State'' was an entertainingly paranoid take on high-tech spying.
</P>
<P>
   Myers touched a nerve with the first ``Austin Powers,'' a wildly
uneven movie that became a hit largely through the box-office
dollars of a generation that was born after the '60s, a generation
that had never heard of Flint, Palmer or Helm, and thanks to
limited video availability, might never hear of the latter two (not
that that's any great loss in Helm's case).
</P>
<P>
   It would be exaggerating things to say that ``Powers'' is as
much in tune with 1999 culture as ``Dr. No'' was with 1962 culture,
and it would really be pressing things to assess the series'
success with a sound bite as doom-laden as Fleming's quote about a
violent culture. Myers, however, may have his finger on the pulse
of why spy movies were so hot in the '60s, and why Powers is so hot
now. When asked by USA Weekend why audiences made ``Powers'' a
phenomenon, Myers had a one-word response that could apply to Bond
as well as Powers:
</P>
<P>
   ``Naughtiness.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   A by-no-means comprehensive '60s spy time line:
</P>
<P>
   1960: ``The Avengers'' debuts on British television, starring
Patrick Macnee as dapper secret agent Jonathan Steed and Honor
Blackman as his female partner. Macnee's most famous partner,
however, would be Diana Rigg as the mod Mrs. Peel; Blackman would
attain her greatest fame as a suggestively named Bond girl in
``Goldfinger.''
</P>
<P>
   Oct. 5, 1962: ``Dr. No'' premieres, starring Sean Connery as
James Bond, Agent 007. Less campy than succeeding entries, it was
bereft of certain Bond ingredients such as a pretitle sequence,
gadgetry or a henchman for the title supervillain.
</P>
<P>
   Aug. 23, 1963: ``From Russia With Love,'' considered by many to
be the best Bond movie, premieres.
</P>
<P>
   Sept. 22, 1964: ``The Man From U.N.C.L.E.,'' TV's most blatant
response to the Bond craze, premieres. The campy series, starring
Robert Vaughan and David McCallum, lasts till January 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Dec. 25, 1964: ``Goldfinger'' premieres, adding more gadgetry (a
versatile briefcase and a loaded Aston-Martin) to the mix. It's the
third-highest-grossing film of 1964; ``From Russia With Love'' is
second.
</P>
<P>
   Early 1965: ``The Ipcress File,'' the first in a trio of movies
starring Michael Caine as reluctant spy Harry Palmer, premieres.
</P>
<P>
   Feb. 27, 1965: ``Goldfinger's'' theme song, sung by Shirley
Bassey, peaks at No. 8 on the ``Billboard'' singles chart.
</P>
<P>
   Sept. 15, 1965: ``I Spy,'' notable for pairing black Bill Cosby
and white Robert Culp, premieres. It lasts till September 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Sept. 17, 1965: ``The Wild Wild West,'' a canny merging of the
spy and western genres, premieres. Robert Conrad stars as James
West, an undercover agent for President Grant; Ross Martin stars as
his sidekick Artemus Gordon, a master of disguise. Will Smith and
Kevin Kline will play their counterparts in an upcoming movie.
</P>
<P>
   Sept. 18, 1965: ``Get Smart,'' a spy sitcom co-created by Mel
Brooks, premieres. Don Adams plays inept CONTROL agent Maxwell
Smart; Barbara Feldon plays his partner, Agent 99, the moddest of
all mod spies. The show lasts till September 1970; in 1995, Andy
Dick will star in a misguided and short-lived reprise on the Fox
network.
</P>
<P>
   December 1965: ``Thunderball,'' the fourth Connery Bond movie,
premieres.
</P>
<P>
   Christmas 1965: Colgate markets a 007 line of colognes and
grooming materials.
</P>
<P>
   Late 1965: ``Our Man Flint,'' starring James Coburn as cocky
superspy Derek Flint, fires the first cinematic salvo at the Bond
series.
</P>
<P>
   Late 1965: ``The Spy Who Came in From the Cold,'' a serious
adaptation of John Le Carre's novel, premieres. It stars Richard
Burton and earns a reputation as the best spy movie of the '60s.
</P>
<P>
   Early 1966: ``The Silencers,'' the first and best of four movies
starring Dean Martin as swinging superspy Matt Helm, premieres.
``Best,'' by the way, is a relative term.
</P>
<P>
   March 26, 1966: ``Secret Agent Man,'' Johnny Rivers' theme song
to the TV series ``Secret Agent,'' peaks at No. 3 on the
``Billboard'' chart. The song will create a far more lasting
impression than the Patrick McGoohan series, which lasted only one
year.
</P>
<P>
   March 28, 1966: Taking advantage of the spy craze, ABC imports
``The Avengers'' to U.S. TV, where it lasts till September 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Sept. 17, 1966: ``Mission: Impossible,'' the best and most
complex of the TV spy series, premieres. It lasts till September
1973 on CBS and earns a sporadic 1988-90 revival on ABC.
</P>
<P>
   Late 1966: ``Murderers' Row,'' the second Matt Helm movie,
premieres. So does ``Funeral in Berlin,'' the second Harry Palmer
movie.
</P>
<P>
   Early 1967: ``In Like Flint,'' the sequel to ``Our Man Flint,''
premieres. So does ``Billion Dollar Brain,'' the third and final
Harry Palmer movie. Both spies will be revived in TV-movies.
</P>
<P>
   August/September 1967: ``You Only Live Twice,'' the fifth and
arguably weakest of the '60s Connery Bonds, premieres. It's notable
for introducing Donald Pleasance's bald, cat-stroking archvillain
Ernst Stavro Blofeld _ the inspiration for Dr. Evil in Mike Myers'
``Austin Powers'' movies. Connery briefly abandoned Bond movies
after its release.
</P>
<P>
   December 1967: ``Casino Royale,'' a renegade and uneven Bond
spoof featuring an all-star cast (David Niven, Peter Sellers, Woody
Allen and original Bond girl Ursula Andress), premieres.
</P>
<P>
   Late 1967: Raquel Welch stars in ``Fathom,'' a surprisingly
entertaining spy spoof. But spy culture shows signs of waning with
``Operation Kid Brother,'' starring Sean Connery's kid brother,
Neil, as James Bond's kid brother ... oh, never mind.
</P>
<P>
   Early 1968: ``The Ambushers,'' considered to be the worst of the
Matt Helm movies (although it's a close call), premieres.
</P>
<P>
   Early 1969: ``The Wrecking Crew,'' the fourth Matt Helm film,
premieres. Helm makes a brief comeback on '70s TV in the form of
Tony Franciosa.
</P>
<P>
   December 1969: ``In Her Majesty's Secret Service,'' starring
George Lazenby in a one-shot performance as the first non-Connery
Bond, premieres. It doesn't do as well as its predecessors, thanks
to the absence of Connery and to a general feeling that the craze
has faded.

THOMAS HARRIS? HE WAS A QUIET GUY. THEN HE CREATED HANNIBAL
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanies HARRIS-MYSTERY MAN) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE COCHRAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Yeah, sure, I know Thomas Harris. So I guess you want me to
reveal the untold story behind spooky serial killer Hannibal Lecter
and ``The Silence of the Lambs.''
</P>
<P>
   I imagine you also wonder about the plot of his soon-to-be new
megahit, ``Hannibal,'' which appeared in bookstores Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   And no doubt you're curious about his views on Hollywood's
handling of his first three novels and what we might expect when
``Hannibal'' and his strange tastes return to the big screen.
</P>
<P>
   Finally (you might reasonably insist), who is Thomas Harris, why
did he drop out of sight after ``Black Sunday'' and how come 11
years have passed since his last epic?
</P>
<P>
   Well, if I knew I'd tell you.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that I do know Thomas Harris. But like Darrell Royal
once said, he met Mickey Mantle before Mickey was Mickey Mantle. I
met Harris when he was young Tom and working for the Waco Herald
and News-Tribune.
</P>
<P>
   Later, we worked together for The Associated Press, but Harris
labored in New York and I in Texas. I'm sure he was no more aware
of me than I was of him.
</P>
<P>
   However, the circumstances of our meeting were unusual.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1960s, the AP assigned me to cover the most bizarre
gold hunt in modern Texas history. It was on Salado Creek, south of
Waco.
</P>
<P>
   The details are lost in time and memory, but the search centered
around a long-lost stash of Spanish gold, jewels and other
treasures hidden in a cave along Salado Creek near Jarrell.
</P>
<P>
   The search party was largely an unsavory group, and the whole
deal probably a scam. In fact, I came to believe it was just con
men caught up in their own weird scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, they were a colorful lot. My favorite was Pig Red, which
was most likely a nickname. Pig confided that a Mexican had
wandered drunkenly into the cave and discovered the treasures while
stumbling through a maze of tunnels. His drinking buddy's most
vivid recollection was a solid-gold bull's head with blood-red
rubies for eyes.
</P>
<P>
   From time to time, they'd liquor up their obliging hero,
purportedly to try to pry from his foggy memory new clues to the
location of their elusive bounty.
</P>
<P>
   I suspected they also did so to impress reporters and potential
investors.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, young Harris and a friend of mine, David McHam, a
journalism professor at Baylor, showed up one morning to report on
this phenomenon for the Waco newspaper. McHam, who worked part time
at the newspaper, also brought along a student named Tommy West,
who would become an outstanding journalist in his own right.
</P>
<P>
   The four of us had breakfast that morning at the Stagecoach Inn
at Salado before heading out to the digging site.
</P>
<P>
   I remembered Harris much later as a bright, quiet, curly-haired
young man who wore glasses and spoke with a charming and richly
Southern Mississippi accent. He didn't have a beard then, and was
relatively tall and slender, two things I've never been.
</P>
<P>
   And that's about it.
</P>
<P>
   For some reason or another, we didn't get into the creekside
drilling site that day. Pretty soon, the gold hunters grew weary of
digging in the snow and rain and began dynamiting the place.
</P>
<P>
   If there was a bull's head, they probably obliterated it in
their haste.
</P>
<P>
   Before returning to Waco, Harris took a photograph of Pig Red,
and West interviewed me about my dealings with Pig and his pals.
Afterward, McHam sent me Harris' photo of Pig along with West's
story.
</P>
<P>
   Many, many years later, at a party somewhere, McHam and I were
discussing books. He now is a journalism professor at the
University of Texas at Arlington. I mentioned that I had read ``The
Silence of the Lambs'' and recently seen the movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought both were excellent,'' I told McHam. ``I'd love to
meet a guy who could create a character like Hannibal the
Cannibal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You did,'' McHam replied. ``He was the kid with Tommy West and
me at the Salado gold hunt.''

VISION GEAR FOR THE DARK AND STORMY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Colo.)   (bl)  
 By DAVID KUSHNER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   After a long day of work as a mechanical engineer, Tom Malphus
likes to hop onto his mountain bike and head into the hills around
San Diego to blow off steam. Mission Park provides a rugged
setting, with off-road trails, wide-open spaces and wildlife. And
even after dark, Malphus sees it all, with the power of his night
vision goggles.
</P>
<P>
   Night vision technology, which amplifies available light through
battery-powered optics, is not just for the military anymore. When
most people think of night vision, they imagine grainy greenish
camera views of bombs falling on Beirut or that chilling scene in
the movie ``Silence of the Lambs.'' But these days, night vision
products are dropping in price, and civilians who are not Hannibal
Lecter wannabes are getting in on the action.
</P>
<P>
   On the Internet, it's easy to pick up night vision goggles that
cost thousands of dollars not too long ago for less than $350. Some
buyers are gearheads, hungry for the latest in optic gadgetry.
Others are adventurers, looking for ways to hike through
Yellowstone at midnight or raft down the Colorado River before
sunrise. It's a novelty that can quickly become an obsession.
</P>
<P>
   Norm Morgovsky, owner of Hi Tek, a company that produces night
vision products for consumers, said that ``once people acquire the
ability to see in the dark, they like to keep it.''
</P>
<P>
   Night vision devices were invented during World War II for
military purposes, with countries like Britain and the Soviet Union
leading the way. In the 1959, a private American company called ITT
Industries Night Vision began creating night vision goods for the
U.S. armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   Night vision products eventually became available on the
commercial market in the 1980s. But they did not become popular
until the winds of change began to sweep across the Soviet Union
and surplus Russian devices were first allowed on the market. Even
though the Soviet products were of considerably lower quality than
the American gear, they helped fan public interest because they
were more affordable.
</P>
<P>
   After the Persian Gulf war, defense spending was reduced,
leaving companies like ITT with a surplus of night vision wares.
For the past six years, ITT has been going after the consumer
market. The company says consumers now account for 15 percent of
its annual sales _ about 10,000 to 15,000 goggles and other
devices, which cost around $2,000 each. A handful of other
manufacturers and distributors, like Hitek International, Moonlight
and Sovietski have entered the consumer business as well.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. armed forces still get the highest-quality night vision
products, generally two to three times as powerful as consumer
versions, said Larry Curfiss, vice president for commercial
products at ITT. The basic technology behind night vision, however,
remains essentially the same.
</P>
<P>
   Even when a night looks impenetrably dark, a tiny amount of
infrared light, outside the range of human vision, is coming from
the moon and stars. A night vision device uses low amounts of
voltage to amplify this light until it can be seen.
</P>
<P>
   The process of amplification seems instantaneous to the viewer,
but it takes several steps. The light, which is made up of photons,
enters the night vision device through a lens and travels through a
tube called an image intensifier. Inside this tube, the photons are
converted into electrical energy. An electrostatic field increases
the intensity of the electrons, which strike a phosphorus screen
and can then be perceived through the eyepiece.
</P>
<P>
   Night vision technology has evolved over four generations of
devices; all but the first generation are still on the market.
</P>
<P>
   In the first devices, an external infrared light source was
required to illuminate whatever the watcher wanted to see, and the
resulting image tended to be distorted. Second-generation systems
can function with just starlight. Third- and fourth-generation
devices can amplify the light even further, by accelerating the
electrons through a wafer-thin glass disk, called a microchannel
plate, that is perforated with millions of tiny holes. That
improves the image quality when the electrons strike the screen. A
light image can be amplified up to 5,000 times.
</P>
<P>
   Because the night-vision device is dealing with infrared light,
the final image is monochromatic and could be rendered in various
colors, but the color that is used for the image is green. Curfiss
said the U.S. government had decided to use green because an Army
survey determined it to be the easiest color for the human eye to
see. ``If they wanted,'' Curfiss said, ``they could have chosen
orange.'' The Soviet Union also chose green.
</P>
<P>
   One common misconception among consumers is that night vision
devices can be used in complete darkness. When there really is no
available light _ deep within a cave, for example _ an infrared
``flashlight'' must be used for illumination. In the military, such
illuminators can prove dangerous because enemies can perceive them
with their own night vision optics. But consumers can readily use
infrared beams as night vision flashlights when there isn't enough
available light.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Consumers might not understand the potential hazards of night
vision devices. Because the optical equipment amplifies light so
much, bright lights or even daylight could damage the eye,
especially in the older models. Many newer models have protection
features that automatically dim the image when the device is
pointed at a source of bright light.
</P>
<P>
   Amateur and commercial night owls are finding more uses for
night vision devices. Hunters use night vision goggles and
binoculars in dark woods; people who suffer from retinal
degeneration, which makes it hard for them to see at night, use
lightweight night vision goggles; boat racers wear waterproof Night
Mariners, from Hitek, to navigate on the water at night.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies are even offering night expeditions for tourists.
In Vale, Colo., the Lakota River Guides company runs night rafting
journeys. Darryl Bangert, the company's owner, said the sight of
the sci-fi headgear was initially unsettling for riverside
residents. He said the tourists generally had a similar reaction:
``Nine out of 10 people say the same exact thing when they put on
the goggles: `Wow, this is so cool.'''

LAWMAKERS, WHITE HOUSE TARGET CRIMES AGAINST SENIORS 
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Vt.)  (Eds: Senior Policy and Politics is a monthly column from the
Washington Bureau of the New York Times Regional Newspapers)  
 (bl)  
 By CARL HULSE   
 N.Y. Times Regional Newspapers   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Preying on the aged is certainly not a new criminal
enterprise. Vulnerable older people nervous about their finances
have always been susceptible to hustlers of shady investment
schemes; elderly homeowners worried about a roof leak can become
victims of fly-by-night contractors.
</P>
<P>
   But fraud against older Americans is entering a new realm with
slick Internet scams, irresistible sweepstakes offerings and a
mind-boggling array of health care swindles. And the problem is
expected to escalate as baby boomers pass into their retirement
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seniors are the most rapidly growing segment of our society,''
said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt. ``As we all grow older, we begin to
depend more on others _ whether it's the ability to shop for
groceries or getting to doctors' appointments.''
</P>
<P>
   To combat fraud against older Americans, Leahy, the top Democrat
on the Judiciary Committee, is leading the effort to enact a
sweeping package of anti-crime provisions intended to reduce
offenses against seniors.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal would establish new safeguards for pension and
retirement programs, grant authorities more power in pursuing
health care fraud and give added protection to nursing home
residents.
</P>
<P>
   It would also take aim at a form of fraud that appears to hit
older people harder than others _ telemarketing scams. The Federal
Trade Commission estimates that Americans lose $40 billion a year
to fast-talking telemarketers and 56 percent of those victims are
older than 50.
</P>
<P>
   ``The greatest threat many older Americans face is not a
criminal armed with a gun, but a telemarketer armed with a
deceptive rap,'' said President Clinton in an April radio address
as he endorsed senior-crime legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Building on a law passed in 1998, Clinton and the Senate authors
of the measure would empower the attorney general to pull the plug
on fraudulent telemarketers by cutting off their phone service, an
option helpful in fighting foreign-based scam artists who can
otherwise avoid U.S. prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   The Leahy measure, known as the Seniors Safety Act of 1999,
would also establish an FTC clearinghouse to allow people to check
the track record of various telemarketing operations.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the increased sophistication of the schemes, another
factor spurring the senior crime legislation is the fact that older
Americans don't appear to be benefiting as much as other groups
from the steady decline in the U.S. crime rate. Leahy notes that
the violent crime rates for people over 50 were the same in 1997 as
in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Stomping out senior crime has long been a political staple as
lawmakers curried favor with the powerful voting bloc. It is hard
to argue against protecting the elderly. In the past, Congress has
entertained stiffer penalties for crimes against older Americans
and sought to stamp out deceptive direct mail campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the American Association of Retired Persons teamed
up with national police organizations to create community programs
intended to reduce crime against seniors and the Federal Trade
Commission has emphasized this area as well.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the initiative by Leahy and the White House different
from the past is the breadth of the proposal. Previous efforts
typically concentrated on one area _ telemarketing for instance _
while Leahy casts a much wider net to include health care fraud,
pension abuse and mistreatment of nursing home residents.
</P>
<P>
   The package, which he hopes to have considered this year, would
establish new criminal and civil penalties for those who show a
willful disregard of the health and safety of nursing center
residents and protect ``whistle-blowers'' who report such problems.
Bilking pension and employee benefit programs could bring new
punishment as well.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the measure would direct the Justice Department to
develop new strategies for reducing crimes against seniors and
include older Americans as a special category in national crime
surveys.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an ugly fact that criminal activity against seniors
inflicting physical and economic harm is a significant and
persistent problem,'' said Leahy, who called his program a ``new
safety net that aims to crack down on crimes that seniors are most
vulnerable to.''

A TENSE NAVAL IMPASSE CONTINUES OFF KOREA FOR SECOND DAY
</HEADLINE>
  (fb) 
 By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ For the second day in a row, North Korean and South
Korean military vessels confronted each other in a tense standoff
on Wednesday, with each side accusing the other of intruding into
its own waters.
</P>
<P>
   No shots were fired, but in the morning a South Korean boat
collided with a North Korean boat that it was trying to keep from
going farther south. There were no injuries and no serious damage,
but the confrontation seems likely to add to the antagonisms
between the Koreas.
</P>
<P>
   American warships were not involved, but American officials said
that they were closely monitoring the situation. Some 37,000
American troops are based in South Korea to help deter any attack
by North Korea, and the border between the Koreas remains one of
the most tense and heavily armed in the world.
</P>
<P>
   According to the South Korean version of events, the episode
began Tuesday when six North Korean military vessels headed in
single file south of the ``northern limit line'' that divides the
waters to the west of the Koreas. They entered a South Korean
``buffer zone'' and escorted some fishing boats that were
apparently catching crabs that are bountiful on the southern side
of the line.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea does not recognize the limit line and sometimes
intrudes south of it. Last year, for example, North Korean vessels
strayed south of the line 30 times, but in the past they have
usually retreated at the first sight of South Korean patrol boats.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the North Korean vessels held their ground, even
though 14 South Korean patrol boats were dispatched and ordered
them to return to the north. The standoff continued again on
Wednesday, and South Korea ordered its own fishing boats to stay
out of the area and put some of its warships on alert.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know North Korea's intentions in detail,'' said Capt.
Shin Han Woo, spokesman for South Korea's Ministry of National
Defense, but he said that the goal may simply have been to get
food.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that North Korean fishermen are catching crabs in the
buffer zone reflects the severity of the economic situation in the
North,'' Shin said.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea's version of events was rather different. It said
that ``the South Korean war hawks'' had intruded deep into North
Korean waters but had fled when approached by North Korean ships.
</P>
<P>
   ''These ceaseless military provocations eloquently show that the
South Korean rulers are running amok to find an excuse for
unleashing a new war, instigated by the U.S. imperialists,'' North
Korea's official news agency declared Wednesday. ``They are well
advised to stop their rash acts, clearly mindful of the fatal
consequences of these provocations.''
</P>
<P>
   North Korea's leading newspaper, Rodong Sinmun, warned in a
commentary on Wednesday that North Korea ``can never remain a
passive onlooker to such provocation.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, both sides seemed to be trying to avoid a military clash,
and the consequences may be more political than military. President
Kim Dae Jung of South Korea has been trying hard to ``engage''
North Korea and offer it inducements to open up to the world, but
each confrontation like this opens him up to criticism for being
soft on the North.
</P>
<P>
   The two Koreas had agreed a few days ago to vice-minister level
talks on such issues as arranging meetings of divided families, and
the naval encounter may make it more difficult to register progress
in those talks.
</P>
<P>
   This is also a crucial moment for North Korea because it is
considering a U.S. plan, devised by former Defense Secretary
William Perry, that could lead to a dramatic improvement in
relations between North Korea and the West. North Korea has also
been groping toward improved relations with Japan.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea periodically seems to test the South's defenses at
land or sea, and although the incidents usually end peacefully they
often end up unnerving people in the South.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any situation like this is significant, and we take it
seriously,'' said Lee Ferguson, a spokeswoman for the U.S. forces
in South Korea. ``But it does occur from time to time.''

AFTER TWO DAYS, INDONESIA STILL AWAITS RESULTS OF HISTORIC ELECTION

</HEADLINE>

<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ Two days after the national election, the
talk of the town on Wednesday was not about who won or lost but
about the fact that nobody had any idea of the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Election returns have been arriving here from around this
sprawling nation with excruciating slowness, and officials of some
parties are expressing alarm over the possibility of vote
manipulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why is it taking so long?'' said Amien Rais, the leader of the
National Mandate Party. ``These delays could raise suspicion.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials of all three of the other leading parties also pointed
fingers at each other, crying thief.
</P>
<P>
   Most local and foreign election monitors _ including former
President Jimmy Carter, who spoke at a news conference on Wednesday
_ said there was no evidence at the moment that the slow count was
deliberate or that it was being used as a cover for cheating.
</P>
<P>
   Carter and other monitors continued to voice optimism that the
election process would turn out to have been for the most part free
and fair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until some allegations have been made that have some
foundation I think we need to believe that the process is
orderly,'' Carter said.
</P>
<P>
   But he added: ``Election monitors will have to be vigilant from
now on. I don't think we'll know until November, when a final
choice for president is made, whether democracy has indeed come to
Indonesia in its fullest form.''
</P>
<P>
   Voters on Monday were selecting 462 representatives who will
make up only part of a 700-member assembly that is scheduled to
choose a new president in November. There will be no shortage of
opportunities in the future to cheat.
</P>
<P>
   The still-minuscule returns continued to show the popular
opposition party of Megawati Sukarnoputri in the lead, with the
incumbent party, Golkar, trailing significantly.
</P>
<P>
   But election analysts said the totals so far were too small to
form the basis of a projection. They also said Golkar's strength
tended to be in more distant and rural areas where reporting is
slower and where manipulation is easier.
</P>
<P>
   Andi Mallarangeng, an official with the General Elections
Commission, said late Wednesday that after initial delays and
mix-ups the tallies had begun to arrive in Jakarta much more
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   He said 50 percent of the results might be available by late
Thursday. Election commission officials had said earlier that they
expected to have 50 percent of the results in hand by late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   A foreign election expert said that had been a wildly
unrealistic hope.
</P>
<P>
   Andi noted that this was Indonesia's first competitive election
since 1955, filled with new technicalities and safeguards that were
complicating the vote count.
</P>
<P>
   He blamed an excess of deliberateness in which totals were being
passed slowly up an administrative ladder _ from polling place to
village to sub-district to Jakarta _ waiting at each step for every
last report and every last signature.
</P>
<P>
   A foreign election observer, speaking on condition of anonymity,
asserted, however, that the complex electoral process was a
jerry-built structure that was itself partly to blame.
</P>
<P>
   Even several days after the election, he said, officials had no
firm figure for the number of registered voters. About 130 million
people are eligible to vote in this nation of more than 200
million.
</P>
<P>
   And there was a discrepancy of as many as 20,000 in the reported
numbers of polling places, the observer said. If each polling place
had 500 voters, this would amount to 10 million votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it is not clear how many people actually voted,'' he said,
``it becomes difficult to tell if there was any manipulation and if
so the extent of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Within this context of uncertainties, Adi suggested that the
painful slowness of the vote processing was also a direct reaction
to the fraudulent elections that re-anointed former President
Suharto every five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are being very, very careful about the results at the
lower levels because of the previous trauma of cheating,'' he said.

 HOME IMPROVEMENT QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I have a small concrete patio outside the sliding glass door
leading to my backyard. The slab is about 4 inches lower than the
door and indoor floor, and I would like to cover the concrete slab
with wood decking that will also raise the level of this patio so
that it is even with the bottom of the door opening. What is the
best way to do this?
</P>
<P>
   A: Buy pressure-treated 2x4s and fasten these to the concrete
patio with the wide (4 inch) side against the masonry as shown
here. You can fasten these sleepers down with a powder-actuated
nail gun that is made for fastening to masonry, or you can screw
the 2x4s to the concrete by first inserting lead anchors in the
monry (after drilling holes first with a carbide masonry bit). The
sleepers should be spaced 16 inches apart. After they are down,
cover them with 2x6 decking, also made of pressure-treated lumber.
Fasten these to the sleepers with rust-resistant nails or screws.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Every time we get a hg roof comes down against the back of
our brick chimney. A new roof was put on a few years ago and metal
flashing was installed in this joint, but the leak persists. We
tried caulking and applying roof cement, but this only helped for a
little while. We called in a new roofer, and he said that the job
was not done right because the original roofer did not build a
``chimney cricket'' behind the chimney. I don't know what a
``cricket'' is, but do you think this could be the problem?
</P>
<P>
   A: A brick chimney that comes up against a sloping or peaked
roof should have a cricket or saddle (both terms are used) built up
on top of the roof and in the space where the back of the chimney
meets the sloping roof. Shaped something like a miniature hip roof
that slopes to match the existing roof, it serves to shed snow and
water quickly and keeps dirt and debris from accumulating and
piling up behind the chimney. There should be flashing installed in
the joints where the cricket meets the roof and the chimney.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Our apartment has old metal cabinets in the kitchen and these
cabinets are greasy and dirty looking. How can I clean the grease
and dirt off without harming the enameled finish?
</P>
<P>
   A: You can wash the dirt and grease offh any strong household
detergent or an all-purpose spray cleaner without fear of damaging
the enameled finish. Scrub with a soft brush or fine kitchen
abrasive pad, then rinse off with plenty of water.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We have a paneled front door made of wood and the panels have
developed several cracks, some of which go all the way through. We
tried filling the cracks with wood filler and paint, but these
repairs don't seem to last long. What can you recommend to repair
this door without replacing it entirely?
</P>
<P>
   A: It is almost impossible to effectively fill in or patch such
cracks in a thin wood panel. Your best bet is to cover the entire
panel with either reinforced fiberglass cloth (fiberglass and
resin), or by gluing a new panel of thin plywood right over the old
panel. In each case it will be necessary to remove all paint or
varnish first in order to get the glue or resin to bond properly.

   AUSTIN, Texas _ Read his letter: Gov. George W. Bush will
``oppose and veto'' any income tax increases if he's elected
president. Reminiscent of the famous ``read my lips, no new taxes''
pledge his father lived to regret, the son of former President Bush
made the promise in a letter to Grover Norquist of the influential
Americans for Tax Reform of Washington. ``I will oppose and veto
any increase in individual or corporate marginal income tax rates

 By JULIE V. IOVINE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Those citronella eyes, set in a velvety gray pelt,
stare out from every corner of the Wegman studio, a sprawling
converted nursery school in Chelsea. It is also the family home of
William Wegman, the conceptual artist and dog-theme merchandiser,
whose fans respond to his outpouring of videos, PBS programs,
books, commercials, posters and kitchen magnets as if answering the
siren call of a high-pitched dog whistle. He is finishing a memoir
(to be published Oct. 1) of life with Fay Ray, one of the
Weimaraners who inspired him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ah, you might not want to sit there,'' one of Wegman's five
assistants said, just as a visitor was about to drop into an
upholstered chair last week. ``It's covered in dog hair.''
</P>
<P>
   While the walls are covered with posters of bewigged Weimaraners
and the floor is scattered with stuffed-toy versions, the sparse
furnishings are covered with a dusting of short, gray hairs. A live
Weimaraner snoozes in the only other chair by the door, oblivious
to all, especially her own celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   Wegman's wife and operations manager, Christine Burgin, calls
this Wegman World, noting that as a child she loathed dogs and
lakes. ``Now I spend half of each year by a lake in Maine with a
bunch of dogs,'' she said, alluding to their summer house.
</P>
<P>
   From the potential tedium of five dog walks a day to the
exhilaration of working with muses drooling to please, their life
has its pros and cons. The Wegmans try, in the midst of
caninecentric careers, to raise their own two children (Atlas, 4,
who doesn't especially like dogs, and Lola, 18 months, who does)
and live normal human lives. Wegman feels guilty leaving them _ the
dogs _ alone just to go to the movies. His wife is restarting her
life as a gallery owner after a seven-year hiatus.
</P>
<P>
   The intimacy of being in residence with two large dogs (Wegman
works primarily with four Weimaraners, but only Battina, 9, and her
son, Chippy, 4, live in New York) permeates the 5,300-square-foot
loft. But for anyone familiar with the Wegman book ``ABC''
(Hyperion, 1994), where each letter of the alphabet is shaped by
pretzel-pliant dogs' bodies, the animals at home seem almost
perversely doglike. They didn't spell anything for a visitor, and
they didn't dress up in flouncy outfits, displaying eerie human
hands. They pretty much lay sprawled on the floor or trotted off in
whatever direction Wegman led.
</P>
<P>
   The loft didn't smell like an animal house. But all the doors
and windows were open onto a breezy roof garden. Deborah Berke, a
New York architect, renovated the loft with dogs in mind. The
built-in cabinets are plywood. The floors are polished concrete
``to protect against those doggy nails,'' said Ms. Berke, a dog
enthusiast, who integrated dog-food bins into the kitchen cabinets.
</P>
<P>
   For the roof garden, Ms. Berke consulted specialists from the
Bronx Zoo to come up with a surface treatment _ a mixture of
concrete and rubber used in the gorillas' habitat _ that could
survive the assault of dogs' relieving themselves. Rebecca Cole
from the Potted Gardens in Greenwich Village landscaped the roof,
using copper-plated planters. Thanks to the dog urine, they will
age to a charming ``antique'' verdigris. Green splatter marks are
already visible.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, dog nests, a kind of beanbag chair flattened to a lumpy
canvas pancake, are everywhere: under a desk, in the hall, in the
bedroom. There are none in the living room. There, the dogs lie on
the couch, which is upholstered in a moss green-gray velvet, like
the coat of a certain familiar dog breed.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't sit on the couch,'' Wegman said. ``The dogs look
so good on it that no one wants to make them get down. Not even my
mother.''
</P>
<P>
   Most guests, he added, prefer to sit at the kitchen table. When
the visitor seemed surprised at how free of hair the white coverlet
on the master bed looked, Wegman said simply, ``Oh, they sleep
under the covers.'' Battina, called Batty, sleeps on Ms. Burgin's
side, Chippy at Wegman's feet. When Crooky, Batty's sister, pays an
overnight visit (she lives with a dentist in Maine), she curls
around Wegman's head. The children stay in their own rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Neither of the Wegmans grew up with dogs between the sheets. The
dog Wegman had as a child in Springfield, Mass., slept in the
basement. (``It wasn't my idea,'' he said.) Ms. Burgin was ``not a
dog person,'' she said. She recalled the early days of Wegman's
courtship. Batty and Fay Ray, the Weimaraner that followed in the
paw prints of Wegman's first dog, Man Ray, went along on their
first date. Wegman remembered the click of his future wife's heels
on the cobblestones of SoHo. She recalled thinking, ``There's no
way I'm going to be able to tell these dogs apart.''
</P>
<P>
   Sleeping arrangements were straightforward. ``I was the
dispensable one,'' she said. ``I knew from the start that sleeping
with the dogs came with the territory. I might end up somewhere
else. They wouldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Three litters later, Ms. Burgin can tell all the dogs apart and
she is used to being crowded out of bed when Wegman is not there to
defend their turf.
</P>
<P>
   Wegman has worked with 25 Weimaraners but still seems in awe of
their personality differences. Man Ray was ``an everything guy,''
who grew up with Wegman as an artist in the 1970s. ``He was so
inside me it was spooky,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Then came Fay: ``I was in my 40s, and I was a man. Fay was like
a woman. I would try to play tug of war with her the way I'd done
with Man Ray, and she'd just look at me like `Why are you shoving
me?' '' Her death from leukemia four years ago is painful for the
couple to talk about.
</P>
<P>
   Now there's Batty: ``She's got these eyes I've looked at for 10
years, and I get to know them more and more each year.''
</P>
<P>
   The simple life of walking, working and sleeping with dogs got
complicated when the children arrived and assumed center stage. In
the couple's private quarters, the larger-than-life Polaroids on
the walls are all Atlas and Lola, not the dogs.
</P>
<P>
   At nursery school, when the children were asked if they had pets
at home, Atlas said he did not. His favorite stuffed toy is a cat.
When his father told a separation-anxiety story about the dogs'
howls being audible all the way across the lake in Maine, Atlas
added with the daggerlike clarity of childhood: ``That's because
you were with me, and they like you.''
</P>
<P>
   OPTIONAL TRIM
</P>
<P>
   Atlas doesn't like the dogs on his bed because they make it hot.
Lola treats them like plush dolls, sitting between their paws to
eat a snack and flinging herself on them with abandon. ``Lola is
more sensuously involved with the dogs,'' Wegman said.
</P>
<P>
   END OPTIONAL TRIM
</P>
<P>
   Wegman clearly relishes the mundane tasks of dog care, brushing
and shampooing his dogs himself. But does he let them lick his
face? He reacted with revulsion. ``They have so many germs!'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The dogs may appear at Barnes &AMP; Noble book signings, on ``Sesame
Street'' and at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, but, Wegman
contends, ``I don't parade them around as special. Even though I
dress them up, I know they're animals.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Their life with dogs is a kind of Zen art of appreciation. Ms.
Burgin spoke of how the dogs' delight at waking up and ``lying in a
piece of sunlight'' was contagious. Wegman said he didn't mind
giving them six walks a day (or having an employee do it) because
``they've given so much to me,'' adding: ``They are heartbreakingly
good.''
</P>
<P>
   And time is relatively short. ``Bill knows the clock is
ticking,'' Ms. Burgin said. ``Both Man Ray and Fay were taken away
before their time. He wants to work as much as possible while he
still has them.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Batty and Chippy had lumps (benign, it turned out)
removed from their legs. The thought of losing his dogs triggered
an existential moment: ``It really upset me when Man Ray died,'' he
said. ``I lived alone then, and it was just so quiet. The whole
idea of the door became meaningless. It didn't matter if I went out
or came in.''
</P>
<P>
   As he got up to take the dogs out for yet another walk, he
added, ``I just love working with them, though it's not as often as
people think, maybe one week out of the month. Most of the time
they're just pets.''
</P>
<P>
   And when Wegman needed to fill a role in a photo shoot, he had
no qualms about stopping a walker out with a dog. In the coming
book ``Surprise Party!'' the punch line arrives dressed as a pizza
man with eerie human hands. It's Jake, a yellow Labrador.

<P>
   NARITA, Japan _ When he feeds his chickens or tends his
eggplants beside the huge jumbo jets at Narita International
Airport, Shoji Shimamura seems a puny, Quixotic figure, with all
the chance of victory of a mosquito challenging an elephant.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the water here must breed extraordinary mosquitoes.
Shimamura and a handful of other farmers have lately scored yet
another triumph over the elephant, delaying expansion of Narita and
adding to its reputation as one of the world's most catastrophic
airports.
</P>
<P>
   The upshot of Shimamura's battle is that greater Tokyo _ the
world's largest metropolitan area, with some 35 million people
living within 40 miles of the Imperial Palace _ still has an
international airport with just a single runway. And it is an
airport, with its barbed wire, riot police and guard towers, that
on the outside has the ambiance of a prison.
</P>
<P>
   The feuding over Narita has been going on for 34 years so far,
and riots at the site in the 1970s left five people dead and 8,000
hurt. Partly because of that grim history, there is far more
airplane exhaust in the air than understanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now they're threatening that planes will fly right over my
house here,'' Shimamura said bitterly, as he sat at his kitchen
table after his evening chores. ``So isn't it natural for me to be
stronger in my resistance than ever, for me to be even more against
the airport than ever?''
</P>
<P>
   There may also be some larger lessons hiding among Shimamura's
eggplants. Shimamura's ability to hold up a vast project like
Narita, at incalculable economic costs for Japan, underscores the
difficulties that the Japanese political process has in creating
losers.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese society has been outstanding in sharing losses, in
cutting benefits equally to get through hard times. But it has not
been as good at picking out a few people to hurl out of the
lifeboat so that the others can survive, and these days there is a
growing conviction in Japan that this is what is needed.
</P>
<P>
   Many argue that to revive its economy, Japan needs a brutal
industrial restructuring that will slash employees at big companies
and end protections that keep inefficient businesses alive. Yet the
story of Narita Airport underscores that just because consensus is
highly valued in Japan does not mean that it is easily achieved,
and that chaos can erupt when change is instituted without
consensus.
</P>
<P>
   The airport feuding erupted when government officials announced
in 1965 that they would build a three-runway airport at Narita, a
bit more than an hour's drive from Tokyo. The announcement would
have been normal enough in America, but in Japan it was seen as
arrogant and high-handed. Officials were expected to consult first
with local farmers, asking them for cooperation and spending months
soliciting their views.
</P>
<P>
   So the angry farmers refused to cooperate, and the government
then compounded their anger by trying to seize the land. Leftist
students backed the farmers, and the resulting riots delayed the
opening of the airport until 1978. Even then, it had just a single
runway, and security costs have helped make landing fees and air
shipping bills some of the most expensive in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, with just one runway, there is a desperate shortage of
landing slots. Airlines that have rights at Narita have been able
to charge relatively high fares because they face limited
competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still trying to get a second runway in place,''
Yoshijiro Hirayama, a vice president of Narita's airport authority,
said with a sigh. ``Japan is co-hosting the World Cup soccer
matches in 2002, and we'll have so many visitors that it's very
important that we have a second runway in place by then.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, however, Hirayama and other officials have
changed tactics, emphasizing conciliation and dialogue. They have
pledged not to use force and, publicly at least, they put on sweet
smiles when speaking of farmers like Shimamura.
</P>
<P>
   Charm seems to have worked better than bulldozers, and airport
officials are winning the public relations war. Some 260,000 people
have signed a petition in favor of building a second runway, and
many of the farmers have agreed to sell out.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that Shimamura's three acres still sit squarely
in the path of the planned 8,200-foot second runway, and he refuses
to budge. In fact, he refuses even to talk to the airport
officials.
</P>
<P>
   So last month, Narita officials gave up their plan of having
that runway in place by March 2001. Instead, they are talking about
building a 7,200-foot second runway by 2002, dodging the property
of Shimamura and one of his equally obstinate neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that even the shorter runway would include a tiny
parcel that is 1/82nd owned by an opponent of the airport, Shohei
Horikoshi. He declined to discuss his plans, but he may be able to
use his fractional share _ the equivalent of a few clods of dirt _
to block the runway.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, a 7,200-foot runway is too short for jumbo jets,
and 90 percent of the flights to Narita now use jumbo jets. Still,
the airport authority says that the jumbo jets can continue to use
the original runway, and additional flights can use smaller planes
on the second runway.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it is possible to make it work,'' said Keita Arakaki,
a manager at the airport authority.
</P>
<P>
   It may seem odd that in a society like Japan that so treasures
harmony a handful of farmers should block what seems to be
overwhelming public approval of the airport expansion. But to
farmers like Shimamura, the breach of propriety came from the
government's side, and everything has flowed from that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the difference between the Japanese people and the
Japanese government,'' Shimamura's wife, Fujiko, fumed. ``Ordinary
people apologize to each other all the time and are very polite and
considerate. We all try to live in harmony. But the government has
all the power and it uses it to try to get its way. And that's the
fundamental problem here.''

   BUELLTON, Calif. _ Entrepreneur Aleene Jackson has always been a
crafty businesswoman, looking for any opportunity to peddle her
work.
</P>
<P>
   From the first few years of television in the early 1950s to the
fast-growing Internet today, Jackson has become a multimedia master
_ educating and entertaining crafters for more than 50 years. The
soon-to-be 75-year-old is far from slowing down. She has a national
cable TV program, a monthly magazine, how-to books and more than
500 products sharing retail shelf space in thousands of stores in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should do whatever your passion is,'' said Jackson,
founder of Aleene's Creative Living in Buellton.
</P>
<P>
   Crafts are Jackson's passion. They also provide her livelihood.
</P>
<P>
   A one-time florist in the 1940s, Jackson created a
multimillion-dollar operation with easy-to-use products, from her
best-known Tacky Glue to the modern and out-of-the-ordinary
Boxmaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something for every age,'' said Jackson, who's been
featured in Life magazine and honored as the craft industry's
leading promoter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just affordable, simple stuff,'' said Tony Hershman,
Jackson's son and chief executive officer of Aleene's Creative
Living. ``We really see ourselves more as delivering a lifestyle to
women.''
</P>
<P>
   The company's far-reaching objective is helping manufacturers
lure shoppers and thrive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crafters are probably the most dedicated consumers you can
imagine, but we have to go after different markets,'' said
Hershman, who introduced the magazine Aleene's Craft Club _ at $12
a month an issue _ and the Internet site (www.aleenes.com) during
the past several years. ``Aleene's Creative Living'' has evolved
into a one-hour television program every weekday. ``That younger
consumer who is not a crafter right now, you have to find them
through other means. We've already missed the Generation Xers.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a battle cry industrywide, experts said.
</P>
<P>
   Though four of every five households have crafters, spending has
stalled. The crafting industry's revenue increased from $7.8
billion in 1994 to $10.9 billion in 1996, before falling to $10.4
billion last year. It's far from a drastic drop, but an issue
nonetheless, industry leaders said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crafting is not something people have to do,'' said Cynthia
Gould, spokeswoman for national retailer Michaels Stores. ``We have
to create projects that are aware of the time constraints on
people. When you see the ebbs and flows, crafting is a leisure-time
activity _ and we compete for time.''
</P>
<P>
   Hershman and Jackson agree, saying their company's crafts have
become easier and faster.
</P>
<P>
   The company's craft show airs at noon weekdays on The Nashville
Network, rivaling talk shows and soap operas during the time slot.
The program's ``very homey, very comfortable'' approach is the key
to its success, said Brian Hughes, vice president of programming
for TNN in Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know they can invite any of us over for dinner,'' said
energetic co-host Katheryn Bieber about viewers, during a break in
the daily eight-hour tapings in a small studio in Buellton.
``There's nothing special about any of us. We're just real people
who love to craft.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just simple how-tos that don't exclude anyone,'' said
Hughes, who has watched the program evolve from one day a week in
1990 into every weekday. ``It incorporates every age group.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Aleene's Creative Living'' attracts about 250,000 viewers
daily, with many buying crafts featured on the program. The
company's call center handles 2,000 to 3,000 customers daily, with
most received during or immediately after the program, said
Hershman, adding the average call generates about $35 in sales.
</P>
<P>
   Call-center employees are ``very suggestive sellers, but not too
aggressive,'' Hershman said. The employees will answer any question
about crafts from people who phone in. The company also offers a
100 percent guarantee _ once refunding money for about 45,000 tubes
of glue that turned slightly yellow and replacing a $10,000 wedding
gown affected by the problem. Orders are shipped from a Chicago
warehouse within 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   But Aleene Jackson's beloved craft company has hit rough
stitches. The company's cost-saving and expansion effort of moving
manufacturing operations to Mexico became a nightmare in the early
1990s. Employees stole endless items, which led to body checks and
security guards to watch workers. A five-year contract forced the
company to remain in Mexico, at a loss of $500,000, and eventually
it filed for bankruptcy protection in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The move to Mexico was a mistake, Jackson said. She had earlier
moved the family-owned company from the Los Angeles area to
Buellton in 1975. But Santa Barbara County's strict growth control
led to the shift to Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't realize it was hemorrhaging money until it was too
late,'' she said about Mexico
</P>
<P>
   The company _ which had attorneys' fees of $1.5 million from the
bankruptcy _ laid off local employees and limited its one-time
1,000 items to a more manageable 100 products in order to survive.
Almost 50 of Aleene's customers approved advancing $500,000 to
continue the operations.
</P>
<P>
   The changes paid off. Now, Aleene's Creative Living _ a
130-employee operation, the third-largest employer in the Santa
Ynez Valley _ is booming, with more than 500 products and a
multimedia marketing outlook. The company completed its
debt-repayment program in March.

AN URBAN OASIS FOR CONFUCIUS TO PONDER

<P>
   NEW YORK _ To understand the profound beauty of the New York
Chinese Scholar's Garden, you must leave your Western mind at the
gate. Do not go looking for masses of flowers and spectacular color
in this garden, which opens Saturday at the Staten Island Botanical
Garden. It is a study of shadows on white walls, stones rising to
the sky and the ripple of sunlight on water.
</P>
<P>
   The plantings are spare, conscious decisions: a pine chosen for
the way a branch echoes the jagged edge of a rock; a flowering
apricot, called Prunus mume, a short, rounded tree that won't
obscure the elegant lines of the simple entrance.
</P>
<P>
   ``A pine would grow straight up and hide the line of the roof,''
said Yangming Chu, the curator of the garden, as Quanxing Fan, a
landscape architect, ruthlessly pruned the branches of the newly
planted apricot trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look at the shape of the plant in relationship to the
building,'' said Fan, who was sent by the Landscape Architecture
Company of China to finish the planting design in the garden. ``If
a tree doesn't fit, we try to prune it in that direction.'' The
canopies of the little apricot trees are rounded, but their
branches, as they age, become pleasingly curving and twisted. They
also bloom in midwinter, opening their delicate, fragrant flowers
on impossibly cold days.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is like the scholar's quality of mind,'' Chu said. ``It
can bloom in the winter cold. It has a delicate smell. Scholars
like subtle things that are not showing off.''
</P>
<P>
   The walled garden, encompassing one acre, is a replica of the
scholar's gardens that thrived in southern China in the 15th
century, when wealthy Confucian scholars, retired from the imperial
court, had the leisure to loll about in pavilions with friends and
concubines, writing poems about the wind whispering through the
pines and the quality of bamboo, which bends without breaking. The
garden, which cost $8 million, was built with city and state money,
a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts, private
donations, and materials and labor from the Landscape Architecture
Company of China. It represents 14 years of collaboration between
the Manhattan design firm of Demetri Sarantitis Architects, which
made four trips to China, and the Landscape Architecture Company of
China.
</P>
<P>
   Construction began last spring, when 40 Chinese artisans arrived
from Suzhou, famous for its scholar's gardens, to build the garden,
which includes eight pavilions, two large courtyards with ponds and
stones placed as carefully as sculptures, curved balustrades and
waterfalls, and many intimate spaces not immediately apparent.
These are discovered only by the kind of meditative wandering that
allows time to wonder what lies hidden behind a Japanese maple, or
to turn a corner to peek through a ``leaky'' window _ a grillwork
in the shape of a flower, say, or a geometric pattern _ to glimpse
a magnolia branch in bloom.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's to arouse your curiosity,'' Chu said, ``to make you want
to see what's behind that wall, and to find a way to get to it.''
You may step through a tall, narrow space shaped like a banana and
discover a banana tree basking against a sunny wall. Or walk across
a bridge so low to the water that it seems to float on its surface.
</P>
<P>
   The entire garden, which in the ancient days of Chinese scholars
would have included the family's residence, is walled, lending a
sense of repose and separation from the outside world. It is a
study of Taoist principles of opposition: light and shade, male and
female, thick and thin, earth and sky. Its physical properties echo
the human body.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stone and wood are the skeleton,'' Chu said. ``The water
is the fluid in your body. The plants are your hair.'' As Frances
Huber, the director of the botanical garden, put it, ``You don't
dominate the garden so much as dissolve into it.''
</P>
<P>
   To get that effect, Chinese craftsmen worked with 350 tons of
eroded stone quarried from Lake Tai, near Suzhou, which is north of
Shanghai. The hand-carved pillars were set in place with mortise
and tenon, not nails, and lacquered a gleaming sang de boeuf (the
color of bull's blood). Handmade clay dishui tiles, which line the
roof, are gently rounded to let the rain drip in beads, not
torrents, to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a poem about sitting quietly by a window, listening
to the dripping water hitting the banana leaf,'' Chu said, as he
pointed out the shapes of bats, which are a symbol of happiness;
gourds, which are good omens, and the Chinese character for
longevity, stamped on each tile.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had always planned an exotic garden,'' said Ms. Huber, a
landscape architect born and raised on Staten Island. ``Most
botanic gardens have a fascination with something foreign and often
build a Japanese garden. But given the history of Snug Harbor, we
started to explore the 19th-century fascination with chinoiserie.''
</P>
<P>
   Sailors' Snug Harbor, a Home for Retired and Decrepit Seamen,
the site of the garden, was built in the 1850s as a self-sufficient
retirement community for sailors. It had everything from a
tuberculosis sanitarium to a working farm, a piggery and creamery,
plantings of wormwood for absinthe and a greenhouse where residents
grew palmetto for making fans and baskets, as well as a music hall
and chapel, which was a miniature version of St. Paul's Cathedral
in London. It was built by Captain Robert Randall, who made his
fortune in the China trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had made a lot of his money, essentially, as a respectable
pirate,'' Ms. Huber said, referring to the shiploads of silk, china
and paintings pouring into America at the time. Maybe he felt a
little guilty, or at least grateful, to the men who did the grunt
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of these guys had jumped on ship at 14,'' Ms. Huber
said. ``By 60, they had problems. They were tubercular or drug
addicts or alcoholics. They had no family, because living with a
sailor isn't easy.''
</P>
<P>
   The community had a real purpose, but as the sailors died off,
it fell into decline. In 1975, the Snug Harbor trustees sold 85
acres to New York City to be developed as a cultural center. About
50 acres became the botanical garden, and as the trustees began to
conjure a master plan, including everything from Victorian gardens
to a miniature farming operation, the life of the seamen kept
coming back to Ms. Huber.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of them would have been in the China sea trade,'' she
said. ``And Suzhou would have been a major port of call.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of a scholar's garden in the old Snug Harbor area,
which has a dearth of scholars at the moment, is yet another polar
opposite so beloved by the Chinese mind. But those who make the
journey _ a Chinese festival celebrates the opening of the garden
this weekend _ will find themselves in another world. Bamboo, pine
and apricot are like brush strokes on a canvas. And the stones
rising out of the water could be those towering mountains
disappearing in the mist of a Chinese landscape painting. &QL;

   LOS ANGELES _ June is the month to celebrate graduations,
anniversaries and showers with stylish parties.
</P>
<P>
   For memorable festivities, keep the menu simple but
great-tasting, advises Ina Garten, author of ``The Barefoot
Contessa Cookbook'' (Clarkson Potter; $32.50), named after her East
Hampton, N.Y., specialty food takeout store.
</P>
<P>
   ``Entertaining is about recess; it's about having fun, not just
for the guests but also for the host. It's about connecting with
friends,'' said Garten, whose book is full of fun party ideas.
``The key to delicious simple food is, of course, to use the best
ingredients.''
</P>
<P>
   To honor new graduates, married couples or the bride-to-be,
Garten suggests a a wonderful outdoor buffet with ham as the
centerpiece and lots of good accompaniments such as grilled and
roasted vegetable platters, assorted salads like Fresh Corn and
Vegetable Coleslaw and fresh fruit platters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ham is fabulous and the easiest thing in the world,'' Garten
says. She uses a spiral-cut smoked ham and tops it with a glaze
that takes just minutes to make in a food processor with mango
chutney, Dijon mustard, brown sugar, orange peel and orange juice.
</P>
<P>
   Her corn salad is best made with fresh corn, she noted, as
frozen doesn't have the texture or flavor desired for a fresh
salad. Her coleslaw is the store's classic, with more flavor than
traditional recipes, she said.
</P>
<P>
   It's not necessary to cook all the food for a party. You can
arrange gorgeous no-cook party platters with store-bought food that
is stylish and delicious. Or you can simply assemble party food by
arranging ingredients for an appetizer that might include farmhouse
cheddar cheese, apple slices and chutney. Garten includes plenty of
ideas in the back of the book. ``The secret is that platters are
very easy to make!''
</P>
<P>
   Vegetable platters are a cinch for home cooks. Garten, who does
lots of vegetable platters for parties, favors combining grilled,
roasted and boiled vegetables _ and allows about a half-pound per
person.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can cook all the vegetables yourself, or add some prepared
vegetables that you buy from a specialty food store.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important to remember that the better the ingredients,
the less you need to do to make the dish taste good. Be inventive _
but mix the colors and textures to make a beautiful arrangement. I
choose vegetables that have hot colors that seem to clash: carrots,
beets, cherry tomatoes, purple onions and yellow peppers.''
</P>
<P>
   For fruit platters, be sure to choose ripe, seasonal fruit.
``Visually, your eye needs to have a focal point and to be able to
see each type of fruit. I like to have one thing that is taller
than the rest, such as a large bunch of grapes or a decoratively
cut papaya, to give the platter height.'' Then she adds berries and
other fruits in casual but organized groups.
</P>
<P>
   Her design concept for her colorful platters is
Japanese-inspired, she said. ``Tall represents the sky, something
solid in the middle represents the earth, and foods that flow
forward represent the water. Once you have those three elements in
any platter, it gives grounding to the design and it looks
better.'' On a fruit platter, for instance, she might arrange a big
bunch of grapes that stand tall, melons in the middle and berries
flowing forward. ``The simpler it is, the better it looks. Avoid
lots of colors with no design element or focal point.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Garten has refined her style, recipes and
entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``My entertaining at home has changed dramatically in the last
20 years. I've learned the simpler the food, the more fun the
party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Food is not about impressing people,'' she said. ``In fact,
it's just the opposite; it's about making them feel comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Fourth of July, for instance, she opted to grill
hamburgers, and for dessert she set out all the fixings for ice
cream sodas so everyone could make their own. ``Guests loved it _
and loosened up. And I didn't have to cook.''
</P>
<P>
   For successful parties, do as much as possible the day before
the party. And get everything done before the guests arrive,
emphasized Garten. Have all the drinks out on a table so guests can
help themselves and each other. A party is about connecting with
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most useful thing I learned by cooking professionally is
that there are a million things that you can do in advance to make
cooking less stressful.''
</P>
<P>
   Use an eclectic mix of platters and baskets for serving. And
when serving buffet style, be sure to position food items at
different levels (use pedestals) for the most attractive
presentation. Platters in the back should be higher than those in
front.
</P>
<P>
   Garten's philosophy of food revolves around taking really good
ingredients and enhancing them _ not masking them _ in cooking. ``I
take a local chicken, for example, and my goal is to bring out the
most wonderful flavor possible.'' It's really about simple food and
using the best fresh local ingredients (i.e. cheeses, sausages,
fruits, etc.) available. ``Recipes that are successful in the store
are often the simplest.''
</P>
<P>
   Garten doesn't feel threatened by giving out her recipes. `It
feels like a generous thing to do for my customers.'' Garten
believes a cookbook is just a starting place for cooks and that
people should give recipes their own style.
</P>
<P>
   Garten's ideas for her creations come from various sources and,
over the years, recipes evolve and change with the times. Sometimes
she creates a dish to be reminiscent of something old-fashioned and
familiar. For instance, the grilled salmon salad she came up with
looks and tastes better and fresher than tuna salad. She grills the
salmon and tosses it with raspberry vinegar and olive oil for
wonderful flavor. Her Pan-Fried Onion Dip brings back memories of
that Lipton favorite, California Dip, but Garten's rendition
contains caramelized onions and is more flavorful.
</P>
<P>
   For a summer party dessert, Garten recommends an easily prepared
Raspberry Tart with a shortbread crust. And if you don't have time
for that, assemble a platter of fresh raspberries with store-bought
creme fraiche and shortbread cookies purchased at a bakery.
</P>
<P>
   Also included are a couple of other dessert options for summer
parties including Tuscan Rosemary and Pine Nut Bars and Raspberry
Lemon Layer Cake, both of which go together in a jiffy. They're
from the new ``Short &AMP; Sweet, Sophisticated Desserts in No Time at
All'' by Melanie Barnard (Houghton Mifflin; $25). It features
numerous shortcuts that result in delicious desserts in under 30
minutes with seven ingredients or less. Many of the simple
creations would make great party fare.
</P>
<P>
   Try the following creations for a stylish party. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
SUN-DRIED TOMATO DIP
</P>
<P>
   Here is the most popular dip at Barefoot Contessa. Reminiscent
of Russian dressing, it is updated with the intense flavors of
sun-dried tomatoes and fresh green onions.  &QL; 
1/4 cup sun-dried tomatoes in oil, drained and chopped (8
tomatoes) &QL; 
1 package (8 ounces) cream cheese, room temperature &QL; 
1/2 cup dairy sour cream &QL; 
1/2 cup mayonnaise &QL; 
10 dashes Tabasco sauce &QL; 
1 teaspoon kosher salt &QL; 
3/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper &QL; 
2 green onions, thinly sliced (white and green parts)
</P>
<P>
   Puree tomatoes, cream cheese, sour cream, mayonnaise, Tabasco
sauce, salt and pepper in a food processor fitted with a metal
blade. Add green onions and pulse twice. Serve at room temperature
with crackers, chips and fresh vegetables. Makes 2 cups.

 &QL; 
BAKED HAM
</P>
<P>
   This is the ultimate party dish. The glaze takes only a minute
to make, and the ham tastes like you worked for hours. Order a
spiral-cut smoked ham from the butcher, so you don't have to slice
it. Serve it for cocktails with mini corn muffins, or for an entree
with extra mustard and chutney. &QL; 
1 (14- to 16-pound) fully cooked, spiral-cut smoked ham &QL; 
6 garlic cloves &QL; 
8 1/2 ounces mango chutney (Major Grey's) &QL; 
1/2 cup Dijon mustard &QL; 
1 cup packed light brown sugar &QL; 
Peel of 1 orange &QL; 
1/4 cup freshly squeezed orange juice
</P>
<P>
   Place ham in a heavy roasting pan.
</P>
<P>
   Mince garlic in a food processor fitted with a metal blade. Add
chutney, mustard, brown sugar, orange peel and orange juice and
process until smooth.
</P>
<P>
   Pour glaze over ham. Bake in preheated 350-degree oven 1 hour,
until ham is fully heated and glaze is well browned.
</P>
<P>
   Serve hot or at room temperature. Makes 35 entree servings; 50
appetizer servings.

 &QL; 
FRESH CORN SALAD
</P>
<P>
   For a particularly beautiful salad, you can mix white and yellow
corn. Don't substitute frozen corn; it doesn't have the texture or
flavor you want in a fresh salad. &QL; 
Water &QL; 
5 ears corn, shucked &QL; 
1/2 cup small-diced red onion (1 small onion) &QL; 
3 tablespoons cider vinegar &QL; 
3 tablespoons olive oil &QL; 
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt &QL; 
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper &QL; 
1/2 cup chiffonade fresh basil leaves
</P>
<P>
   In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook corn 3 minutes,
until starchiness is just gone. Drain and immerse in ice water to
stop cooking and set color. When corn is cool, cut kernels off cob,
cutting close to cob.
</P>
<P>
   Toss kernels into a large bowl with red onion, vinegar, olive
oil, salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Just before serving, toss in fresh basil. Taste for seasonings
and serve cold or at room temperature. Makes 4 to 6 servings.

 &QL; 
 &QL; 
VEGETABLE COLESLAW
</P>
<P>
   This is like traditional coleslaw but has a lot more flavor. The
vegetables can be sliced by hand, but it's faster to use a food
process. Placing the vegetables horizontally in the food processor
ensures long shreds. &QL; 
1 pound white cabbage (1/2 small head) &QL; 
3/4 pound red cabbage (1/2 small head) &QL; 
5 carrots &QL; 
2 cups mayonnaise &QL; 
1/4 cup Dijon mustard &QL; 
1 tablespoon sugar &QL; 
2 tablespoons cider vinegar &QL; 
2 teaspoons celery seeds &QL; 
1 teaspoon celery salt &QL; 
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt &QL; 
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   Fit a food processor with thickest slicing blade. Cut cabbages
into small wedges and place horizontally into feed tube. Process in
batches.
</P>
<P>
   Next, fit food processor with grating blade. Cut carrots in half
and place in feed tube so they are lying on their sides. Process in
batches and mix in a bowl with shredded cabbages.
</P>
<P>
   In a medium bowl, whisk together mayonnaise, mustard, sugar,
vinegar, celery seeds, celery salt, kosher salt and pepper. Pour
enough of dressing over vegetables to moisten.
</P>
<P>
   Serve cold or at room temperature. Makes 8 to 10 servings.
</P>
<P>
   NOTE: Vegetables can be prepared a day ahead and stored,
unwrapped in plastic food container in refrigerator. Keep red
cabbage separate, or it will turn other vegetables pink.

 &QL; 
VEGETABLE PLATTER
</P>
<P>
   Vegetable platters are very easy to do at home: You can cook all
the vegetables yourself, or add some prepared vegetables from a
specialty food store. Combine the flavors of grilled vegetables,
roasted vegetables and even boiled potatoes and beets. Be
inventive, but mix the colors and textures to make a beautiful
arrangement. Allow a half-pound of vegetables per person.
</P>
<P>
   Arrange the vegetables in groups on a large platter. Sprinkle
with salt and pepper. Serve either hot or at room temperature. &QL; 
GRILLED VEGETABLES &QL; 
Bell peppers, seeded and cut into quarters &QL; 
Zucchini, sliced diagonally 1/2-inch thick &QL; 
Eggplant, unpeeled and sliced crosswise 1/2-inch thick &QL; 
Red onions, sliced 1/2-inch thick &QL; 
Asparagus, tough ends removed &QL; 
Beets, unpeeled and sliced 1/2-inch thick &QL; 
Olive oil &QL; 
Kosher salt &QL; 
Freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   Toss each vegetable with olive oil, kosher salt and freshly
ground black pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Grill over hot coals or on a cast-iron stove-top grill until
soft and charred, about 15 to 20 minutes. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
ROASTED VEGETABLES &QL; 
Carrots, sliced in 1/2-inch-thick diagonal slices &QL; 
Brussels sprouts, ends cut off and any yellow outer leaves removed &QL; 
Fennel bulbs, stems removed and bulb cut into 1/2-inch thick
slices &QL; 
Butternut squash, cut into 1 1/4- to 1 1/2-inch cubes &QL; 
New potatoes, unpeeled and cut into quarters &QL; 
Sweet potatoes, unpeeled and sliced 1/2-inch thick &QL; 
Beets, unpeeled and cut onto quarters &QL; 
Olive oil &QL; 
Kosher salt &QL; 
Freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   Toss each vegetables with olive oil, kosher salt and freshly
ground black pepper. Roast in preheated 400-degree oven 20 to 40
minutes, until tender on inside and crisp on outside.

(SECOND TAKE FOLLOW) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The most important thing about making one of these platters is
choosing ripe, seasonal fruit. After that, it's just cutting and
arranging. For 10 to 12 people, here's a suggested list of
ingredients. &QL; 
2 small ripe melons &QL; 
1 golden pineapple &QL; 
2 bunches grapes &QL; 
1 pint fresh figs &QL; 
1 pint raspberries &QL; 
1 pint strawberries &QL; 
1 pint blueberries &QL; 
1 red papaya
</P>
<P>
   Begin platter with a base of ripe, colorful, sliced melons and
pineapple _ for example, cantaloupe, honeydew OR Galia melons, plus
pineapples. Peel outside of a whole melon, cut in half through stem
end and scoop out seeds. Place melon halves, cut side down, on a
board and slice straight across into 1/2-inch-thick slices. Fan
each half-melon out slightly and arrange on platter.
</P>
<P>
   Next, cut off top and bottom of pineapple, peel outside and use
a sharp knife to remove ``eyes.'' Cut pineapple in half lengthwise
and remove core by cutting a ``V'' down center of each half. Again,
place pineapple halves, cut side down, on a board and slice
straight across into 1/2-inch-thick slices. Fan slices out and
arrange next to melon on platter.
</P>
<P>
   Once base is set, you can add any kind of fruit that is
available. I like to have one thing that is taller than the rest,
such as a large bunch of grapes or a decoratively cut papaya, to
give platter height. Then I add raspberries, strawberries,
blueberries and fresh figs in casual but organized groups.
Visually, your eye needs to have a focal point and be able to see
each type of fruit. After all fruit is arranged, add flat green
leaves around outside of fruit to set off colors. Use lemon and
galax leaves from a florist or fig leaves and grape leaves from
your garden. Make sure they are pesticide-free and well rinsed.
</P>
<P>
   Any kind of fruit will work well on this platter. For special
occasions, add persimmons, kiwi, passion fruit, Queen Anne
cherries, fresh apricots and mangoes. Choose whatever is colorful
and seasonal.

<P>
   &LR; RASPBERRY TART
</P>
<P>
   For this shortbread crust, just press the dough into the pan
rather than rolling it out. &QL; 
TART SHELL: &QL; 
3/4 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature &QL; 
1/2 cup sugar &QL; 
1/2 teaspoon vanilla &QL; 
1 3/4 cups all-purpose four &QL; 
Pinch salt &QL; 
FILLING: &QL; 
1 cup raspberry preserves &QL; 
1 1/2 pints fresh raspberries (3 packages)
</P>
<P>
   For Tart Shell, in bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a
paddle attachment, mix butter and sugar together until just
combined. Add vanilla.
</P>
<P>
   In a medium bowl, sift together flour and salt, then add to
butter-and-sugar mixture. Mix on low speed until dough starts to
come together.
</P>
<P>
   Dump onto a surface dusted with flour and shape into a flat
disk. Press dough into a 10-inch-round or 9-inch-square
removable-bottom tart pan, making sure that finished edge is flat.
Chill until firm.
</P>
<P>
   Butter one side of a square of foil to fit inside tart and place
it, buttered side down, on pastry. Fill with dry, uncooked beans or
rice.
</P>
<P>
   Bake in preheated 350-degree oven 20 minutes. Remove foil and
beans, prick tart all over with tines of a fork and bake again 20
to 25 minutes more, or until lightly browned. Allow to cool to room
temperature.
</P>
<P>
   For Filling, spread tart with raspberries preserves and place
fresh raspberries, stem end down, in concentric circles. If making
a square tart, place raspberries in rows. Serve immediately. Makes
10 to 12 servings.
</P>
<P>
   NOTE: Tart shell can be baked a day ahead, and tart can be
assembled a few hours before serving. Never refrigerate a baked
shell or a finished tart.

   &LR; TUSCAN ROSEMARY &UR;  &LR; AND PINE NUT BARS
</P>
<P>
   Don't scoff at putting pungent rosemary into cookies. These bars
are simply terrific. Pair them with a plate of grapes or pears and
wedges of dessert cheeses. &QL; 
1/4 cup pine nuts &QL; 
8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter, cut into 10 pieces &QL; 
1/2 cup powdered sugar &QL; 
1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary OR 2 teaspoons dried &QL; 
1 cup all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   Spread pine nuts on a baking sheet and place in preheated
350-degree oven. Toast, stirring once or twice to prevent burning,
until they are a shade darker and fragrant, about 4 to 5 minutes.
Watch carefully; pine nuts burn easily. Remove from baking sheet
and set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in a medium saucepan over medium heat, melt butter.
Remove pan from heat and stir in powdered sugar, rosemary and pine
nuts. Then stir in flour to make a stiff dough.
</P>
<P>
   Spread and pat dough evenly into an ungreased 8-inch square
baking pan. Bake until bars are golden and firm at edges, about 20
minutes. Cool pan on a rack, about 2 minutes, then use a sharp
knife to cut into 16 squares.
</P>
<P>
   Let bars cool in pan at least 10 minutes before removing with a
small spatula. Bars can be stored, tightly covered, up to 5 days or
frozen for 1 month. Makes 16 cookies.

   &LR; RASPBERRY LEMON LAYER CAKE
</P>
<P>
   Most special events are commemorated with a layer cake. With
high-quality prepared ingredients, such as store-bought pound cake
and lemon curd, creating a delicious and beautiful layer cake takes
just minutes and no skill at all. &QL; 
1 1/2 cups whipping OR heavy cream, chilled &QL; 
3 tablespoons powdered sugar &QL; 
3 tablespoons orange liqueur, such as Grand Marnier OR Cointreau OR
orange syrup &QL; 
1 store-bought pound cake (10- to 12-ounce package) &QL; 
1 cup store-bought lemon curd OR 1/2 cup lemon OR orange marmalade &QL; 
3 baskets (1/2 pint EACH) fresh raspberries, preferably 1 EACH of
red, black and golden berries
</P>
<P>
   Whip cream, powdered sugar and liqueur to firm peaks; set aside.
Use a serrated knife to cut cake horizontally into 3 even layers.
</P>
<P>
   Place a bottom layer of cake on a platter. Spread 1/3 of lemon
curd over cake. Top with a single layer of raspberries, placed in
rows, using alternating berry colors if you have them. Spread 1/3
of whipped cream over berries, taking care not to disturb rows.
Make another layer of cake, lemon curd, berries and cream in same
way. Top with remaining cake layer. Spread remaining lemon curd
over top of cake. Frost top and sides with remaining whipped cream.
Decorate top with remaining berries.

   &LR; TOFFEE BARS
</P>
<P>
   The enduring candy-bar flavor combination of crisp, buttery
toffee and milk chocolate is equally appealing in a shortbread
cookie. Now that toffee chips are readily available, this recipe
has become my favorite for quick bar cookies. &QL; 
8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter, cut into 10 pieces &QL; 
1/2 cup packed light brown sugar &QL; 
1 teaspoon vanilla &QL; 
1 cup all-purpose flour &QL; 
1/2 cup plus 3 tablespoons toffee chips, such as Heath OR Skor &QL; 
1/2 cup milk chocolate chips
</P>
<P>
   In a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, stir butter until it
is melted, light brown and has a nutty aroma, about 3 minutes.
Watch carefully to prevent burning. Remove pan from heat and stir
in brown sugar and vanilla. Stir in flour to make a stiff dough,
then stir in 1/2 cup toffee chips.
</P>
<P>
   Spread and pat dough into an ungreased 8-inch square baking pan.
</P>
<P>
   Bake in preheated 350-degree oven about 20 minutes or until
golden brown. Place pan on a rack. Immediately sprinkle with
chocolate chips. Wait 1 minute to allow chocolate to melt, then
spread over bars to form an icing. (If chocolate does not melt,
return pan to oven for a few seconds, then spread.) Sprinkle with
remaining 3 tablespoons toffee chips.
</P>
<P>
   Let bars cool in pan 2 minutes, then use a sharp knife to cut
into 16 squares. Let cool 5 to 10 minutes more, then refrigerate at
least 5 to 10 minutes to set chocolate before using a small spatula
to remove bars from pan.
</P>
<P>
   Bars can be stored, tightly covered, up to 5 days, or frozen up
to 2 months. Makes 16 cookies.

 &HT;    KASICH OFFERS PLAN TO REFORM SOCIAL SECURITY
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republican presidential candidate John Kasich
became the latest GOP hopeful to unveil a Social Security reform
plan Wednesday, suggesting a cut in benefits for today's baby
boomers but higher returns for future generations.
</P>
<P>
   Unless Social Security is reformed, the program will not have
enough money to fully pay benefits after 2034.
</P>
<P>
   Kasich said his plan offered the promise of no tax increases and
no reduction of benefits to those currently 55 or older. He would
reduce the initial payment for those under 54 by pegging the
formula that is used for computing benefits to prices rather than
wages.
</P>
<P>
   The formula shift would begin to be noticed after 2010. By 2020,
the change would mean the average starting benefit would be $23,532
a year instead of $27,408. By 2070, about when a child born now
would begin receiving benefits, the starting payment would be
$118,368 under Kasich's plan compared to $213,840 under current
law.
</P>
<P>
   To offset the lower starting benefit, Kasich would allow workers
to voluntarily invest a portion of their payroll tax in private
investment accounts. The amount invested would be 3.5 percent for
those making up to $30,000, 2.5 percent for those making up to
$72,600, and 1 percent for those making more.
</P>
<P>
   For every dollar invested in private accounts, Social Security
benefits would be cut by 25 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Kasich predicted that the average 45-year-old would see a
reduction in benefits of about 1.7 percent, but the average
25-year-old would see a boost of about 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   GOP candidates Steve Forbes and Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., have
previously offered Social Security reform plans.
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday, the House Ways and Means Committee began a
two-day hearing on various proposals to change the federal
retirement system. The proposals covered a variety of options, but
had one element in common: almost all of them would use a portion
of general revenue to pay for or augment Social Security benefits.
Since the program began in 1935, benefits have been financed solely
through payroll taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing is expected to conclude Thursday with an examination
of the plan offered by two of the panel's Republican leaders, Reps.
Bill Archer of Texas and E. Clay Shaw Jr. of Florida.

WEB AUCTION NETS SKY-HIGH PRICES

   PHOENIX - Some people say that music is priceless. But when it
comes to '80s country queen Sylvia, there is a price: $280, to be
exact.
</P>
<P>
   That's how much Joe Martin paid last week for a single copy of
Sylvia's 1983 CD ``Snapshot.'' The long-out-of-print disc was up
for grabs on the Internet auction site eBay (www.ebay.com) and
soared to an extremely rare, very lofty perch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's blowing me away,'' said Rick Lasseter, the lucky soul who
was selling the disc. ``I had several Sylvia CDs last fall, and
they all sold for like $35 or $40. I knew ``Snapshot'' was the
rarest one, but I had no idea how rare.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet-auction craze has sparked some interesting CD
bidding wars on eBay. Liza Minnelli's ``Live at the Olympia'' is
going for $45. ``Walking in the Shadow of the Big Man'' by
Guadalcanal Diary (remember them?) is up to $41.67. A Ricky Martin
disc is hovering at the $90 mark, but that one boasts an autograph.
</P>
<P>
   All impressive, but none come close to the disc by one-named
wonder Sylvia _ for which Lasseter originally paid $6.99 at a
used-CD store.
</P>
<P>
   Before you get mad at the Texas entrepreneur, he makes some good
points. First of all, if people are willing to pay that much, he
would be foolish to stop them. Secondly, he's doing customers a
service by locating these deleted discs in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people don't have time to go out and look for this
stuff,'' he said. ``They want something and they don't want to
bother looking through pawn shops and swap markets, so that's what
I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin, a 33-year-old graphic designer from Norfolk, Va., didn't
mind parting with the cash, though this is the first time he ever
put so much down for one disc.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was the first country artist I really liked,'' he said.
``There's a sentimental attachment there. I've got a buddy laughing
at me for buying it, but you drop your money where you drop it.''
</P>
<P>
   He's been looking for the disc ``off and on'' for a couple of
years. He'd never even bought anything from eBay before until the
Sylvia disc popped up. His first bid was $60, then he got locked
into a battle with another eBay-er and things escalated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of crazy, but you get into that auction mentality,''
he admits. ``But it's a whole collector thing. And I've got a
sentimental spot for Sylvia _ kind of a geeky fan thing, I guess.''
</P>
<P>
   I can relate. I was in the ``Snapshot'' bidding war, but got
blown away early on. As with Martin, Sylvia was one of those voices
from high school that I always enjoyed hearing. She wasn't the
greatest singer who ever lived, but she had a quality that was
quite endearing.
</P>
<P>
   It seems like it would be odd to be at the center of this
attention. But Sylvia herself, who lives in Nashville and recently
put out a terrific folk-flavored album, ``The Real Story''
(www.songs.com/Sylvia), takes it in stride.
</P>
<P>
   ``On one level, I'm flattered,'' said the singer from her
Nashville home. ``But if someone is willing to pay that price,
maybe RCA (her old label) should think about putting it back in
print.''
</P>
<P>
   She says she gets letters every week asking where people can
find her '80s hits _ she had 20 of 'em, making the fresh-scrubbed
beauty the Faith Hill of her day.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I think it's really sweet,'' she said. ``I'm trying
to think of who I would spend $280 on a CD for, and I can't think
of anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   The singer, who recently auditioned for a role in the Broadway
musical ``The Civil War,'' thought it was (begin ital) really (end
ital) sweet. She even sent Martin a little thank-you e-mail, so
she's pretty sweet herself.
</P>
<P>
   Since she was on the phone anyway, I figured I'd ask: Any extra
copies of ``Snapshot'' lying around the house she'd be willing to
part with?
</P>
<P>
   ``I only have one or two copies of each CD,'' she said with a
laugh. ``I think my mom has one of each, and my brother might have
one, too. They really are hard to find.''

Kosovars are seeking refuge in and around Sarajevo being housed in

sold nearly half of the guns used in crime last year and many of
those businesses show up year after year as major sources of crime
weapons, according to a new study of federal firearms data. The
study conducted by the office of Sen. Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y.,

`HANNIBAL': LECTER RETURNS, AND ONE OF HIS VICTIMS WANTS REVENGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Publication notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Special Agent Clarice Starling of the FBI is in trouble at the
start of ``Hannibal,'' Thomas Harris' ghoulish sequel to his two
previous crime thrillers, ``Red Dragon'' and the superb ``Silence
of the Lambs,'' featuring the murderous psychoanalyst Hannibal (the
Cannibal) Lecter.
</P>
<P>
   Long resented by some of her superiors for her success, Starling
now has made herself vulnerable by taking part in a botched drug
raid and shooting to death a mother with a baby in her arms,
resulting in negative publicity even though the woman shot at
Starling first with a Mac-10 she was hiding behind her baby. (The
Guinness Book of World Records is preparing to list Starling as
``having killed more criminals than any other female law
enforcement officer in United States history.'')
</P>
<P>
   But then Harris' plot twists for the first of many times. On the
brink of being disciplined, Starling is suddenly reassigned to the
behavioral science section of the FBI Academy at Quantico, Va.,
where as a student volunteer she helped track down Jame Gumb, one
of the serial killers in ``The Silence of the Lambs.'' Her indirect
benefactor turns out to be no less than Lecter, who seems to have
resurfaced in Brazil. Among her first assignments is to interview
one Mason Verger, the heir to a meat-packing fortune who is the
only one of Lecter's victims to have survived.
</P>
<P>
   Not that what follows isn't thoroughly suspenseful. The horribly
mutilated Verger only pretends to cooperate with Starling. He
really intends to capture and punish Lecter himself, and to use
Starling as his bait to that end. The cat-and-cat game that follows
is cleverly worked out with every lethal swipe of a paw.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, so great is the fund of fascination with Lecter built
up in Harris' previous novels _ for his being a superman embodying
absolute yet comprehensible evil, and for his being so brilliantly
brought to life on screen by Anthony Hopkins _ that almost nothing
can dissipate his malign attraction.
</P>
<P>
   Yet ``Hannibal'' simply lacks the compact power of the previous
books. For one thing, Harris seems determined to top himself in
monstrosity at any and all cost. What Lecter has done to Verger is
to get him high on methamphetamines and ``acid'' and then suggest
that Verger cut off his own face and feed it to his dogs (albeit
for being a sex molester and sadistic tormenter of children).
Instead of skin, vessels have been grafted ``over the bones of his
face to feed it blood; their regular dilation was like worms
swallowing.'' The result shades toward the stuff of comic books.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, the character of Lecter is gradually compromised. At
first he grows as a figure of pure and brilliant evil, like Satan
in the Book of Job, ``going to and fro in the earth and walking up
and down in it,'' and, like some ancient orator, exploring the
spacious ``memory palace'' of his mind, a mnemonic system ``built
according to the rules discovered by Simonides of Ceos and
elaborated by Cicero 400 years later.''
</P>
<P>
   But then slowly Lecter acquires a biographical background: likes
and dislikes, sexual preferences, parents, ancestors, a birthplace,
a childhood and even a traumatic psychology that incidentally
explains his complex attitudes toward Starling. This seems to
contradict everything he stood for earlier, which he articulated
succinctly to Starling at one point in ``The Silence of the
Lambs'': ``Nothing happened to me, Officer Starling,'' he tells her
when she challenges him to understand himself. `` &UR; I &LR;  happened. You
can't reduce me to a set of influences. . . . Typhoid and swans _
it all comes from the same place.''
</P>
<P>
   Reduced to a set of influences in ``Hannibal,'' Lecter shrinks
to less than a man. Even his elegant tastes seem trivialized. What
seemed passionate and austere in him when pursued in the starkness
of prison is reduced to effeteness when indulged in freedom.
Despite his preference for Scarlatti and Bach's ``Goldberg''
Variations, one expects to hear in the background Bach's ``Toccata
and Fugue in D minor,'' a staple of horror films, as the doctor
swirls his brandy in a chimney ballon purchased at Christofle.
</P>
<P>
   Even Harris' prose comes a cropper as the overwrought plot
progresses. Scene-setting passages become the shorthand of a
screenplay. (``Morning, and the armored concrete cage of the Hoover
Building brooding under a milky overcast.'') Sentences grow
Teutonically clunky. (``Came sobs of apprehension and pleas, the
scream building, and ahead of Starling, beyond the fence, she heard
movement through brush . . .'') Grammar lapses. (``From the clarity
of his speech, Dr. Lecter may have been awake for some time.'')
Harris even forgets a character's name, changing Fredrica Bimmel,
one of Jame Gumb's victims, to Fredericka.
</P>
<P>
   True, ``Hannibal'' remains full of wonderful touches, typical of
Harris' grasp of arcane detail. ``We were talking about inherited,
hardwired behavior,'' Barney, one of Lecter's attendants at the
Baltimore State Hospital for the Criminally Insane, tells Starling
when she asks what Lecter thought of her. ``He was using genetics
in roller pigeons as an example. They go way up in the air and roll
over and over backwards in a display, falling toward the ground.
There are shallow rollers and deep rollers. You can't breed two
deep rollers or the offspring will roll all the way down, crash and
die. What he said was: `Officer Starling is a deep roller, Barney.
We'll hope one of her parents was not.'''
</P>
<P>
   But as Starling rolls deeper and deeper into this tale of
revenge taken over the top, the reader is overcome by revulsion and
incredulity. Late in the novel, Lecter sits in an armchair doing
mathematical calculations. ``The pages are filled with the symbols
of both astrophysics and particle physics,'' the narrative
explains. ``There are repeated efforts with the symbols of string
theory. The few mathematicians who could follow him might say his
equations begin brilliantly and then decline, doomed by wishful
thinking: Dr. Lecter wants time to reverse _ no longer should
increasing entropy mark the direction of time. He wants increasing
order to point the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Lecter, the dark prince of chaos, giving away to wishful
thinking, and wanting more order? Lecter being so dumb as to think
if the universe contracted, time would reverse? Bring on the noisy
lambs, then. They might as well be roaring.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A plan to protect a Texas Air Force base from
budget cuts and possible closure has cleared a crucial hurdle in
the Senate, where a provision included in a defense spending bill
would allow the city of San Antonio to provide services to reduce
the Pentagon's costs.
</P>
<P>
   The unusual proposal San Antonio is offering the Air Force is
being closely watched by other cities that might seek to protect
military facilities that are vulnerable to future base realignment
and closure commissions, commonly referred to as BRACs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you can BRAC-proof a base, but what you can do
is put a base on another economic footing. This is a very smart
move,'' Paul Taibl, policy analyst with the Washington-based
Business Executives for National Security, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio Mayor Howard Peak said the proposal that would
affect Brooks Air Force Base ``just makes sense.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It presents a whole new way of doing things, cheaper and
better. It's going to work for everybody,'' Peak said.
</P>
<P>
   The idea to transform Brooks into a ``city base'' grew out of a
task force the mayor created shortly after Brooks narrowly escaped
the scrutiny of a 1995 base closure commission that ordered nearby
Kelly Air Force Base shuttered.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, and Rep. Ciro Rodriguez,
D-Texas, were instrumental in taking the city's ideas and crafting
them into legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The language was tucked into the $265 billion defense spending
bill that was approved by the Senate, 93-4, late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our legislation will reduce the costs and increase the
efficiency of operations at Brooks AFB,'' said Hutchison, who
inserted the measure into the defense bill from the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, who represents part San Antonio in the House, said
the Brooks project ``can be the model for operating urban Air Force
bases more efficiently in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I envision Brooks operating as a public-private and
military-civilian research park in a way that makes the base even
more valuable to the Air Force and South Texas,'' said Rodriguez, a
member of the House Armed Services Committee.
</P>
<P>
   If similar language is not approved by the House, Hutchison
would have to protect the measure when a House-Senate conference
committee crafts a final version of the bill. Hutchison, a member
of the Senate Appropriations Committee, will have a seat on the
committee.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation allows the Air Force and Defense Department to
enter into business agreements with San Antonio and local entities
that can provide water, sewer, utilities, fire protectio and road
repair services at lower costs than the military.
</P>
<P>
   Peak said the ``economy of scale'' would allow the city police,
road crews, utilities and network of fire stations to serve Brooks
at a cheaper rate. The Air Force would pay the city for the cost of
services, while saving money by eliminating overhead and purchases
of equipment, the mayor said.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor could not estimate what the Air Force would have to
pay the city or which services it might want.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also would let the Air Force lease space at the base to
private companies and ``tenants who can jointly use and help pay
for the unique facilities,'' Hutchison said.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange, the city is protecting a job base of high-paying,
high-technology research salaries that annually pump roughly $158
million in payroll into the economy, according to figures compiled
by the Greater San Antonio Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks, which employs 1,800 civilians and 2,100 military
personnel, does high-tech research for the Air Force, including
studies of the effects of new aircraft on pilots.
</P>
<P>
   And the Air Force published a study this year that paved the way
for the pilot project, calling for the elimination of legal
barriers that have prevented the military branch from entering into
leases and agreements with other public entities and private-sector
organizations.

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Peak said he has heard of the interest of other cities and towns
worried about protecting military installations in an era of
defense cuts and closures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw what happened at Kelly,'' Peak said of the decision to
close the aircraft repair depot that was once San Antonio's
largest, single-site employer.
</P>
<P>
   A 1995 base closure commission ordered Kelly closed by 2001,
despite arguments from San Antonio that Kelly jobs had created the
city's Hispanic middle class.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is, these bases need to be contributing
something,'' Peak said, citing San Antonio's goal to make Brooks
more ``efficient and effective.''
</P>
<P>
   Taibl, whose organization advocates business practices to make
the military more cost effective, said the concept would not
guarantee against closure of a military installation deemed
obsolete by Pentagon accountants.
</P>
<P>
   But having a city as a partner will bring about a ``smoother
transition,'' if the facility is closed and turned over to local
officials.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  As time nears for U.S. to cede control of the Panama Canal, leaving
it all behind is proving difficult for many Americans whose
livelihoods are linked to the waterway

<P>
   ABOARD THE KONKAR STAR, Panama _ ``Dead slow ahead!'' barks
Robert Holden, a pilot on the Panama Canal, as he guides a Greek
freighter through the world's most famous shortcut.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dead slow ahead!'' echoes Nanidis Spiridon, the fidgety,
chain-smoking Greek captain whose ship, the Konkar Star, is packed
with 57,000 metric tons of yellow corn on a voyage from New Orleans
to Nagoya, Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dead slow ahead!'' confirms the coxswain, as he follows
Holden's order to cut the ship's engines to minimum speed.
</P>
<P>
   Here on the Panama Canal, Holden, a Massachusetts native who has
worked on the waterway since 1969, is part autocrat, part artist.
</P>
<P>
   His curt instructions set off a chain reaction of bustle and
fuss by the Konkar Star's captain and crew that will allow the ship
to fool nature by floating up and over the isthmus separating the
Atlantic and the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   But Holden and the rest of the Zonians, the thousands of
Americans who have lived and worked along the canal for nearly a
century, are a disappearing breed.
</P>
<P>
   Under the 1977 Panama Canal treaties, the United States must
turn over full control of the waterway to Panama at noon Dec. 31
and close the last of its 10 military bases in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The actions will complete the handover of the U.S.-administered
territory once known as the Canal Zone and will mark the end of the
American Era in Panama, an epoch that began in 1904 when President
Theodore Roosevelt vowed to ``make dirt fly'' by digging a great
trench across the Panamanian isthmus.
</P>
<P>
   In his book ``The Path Between the Seas,'' historian David
McCullough writes that Roosevelt viewed the project as ``a mighty
battle in which the national honor was at stake.''
</P>
<P>
   The enthusiasm of the former Rough Rider, who led a charge
during the Battle of San Juan Hill in Cuba during the
Spanish-American war of 1898, caught on.
</P>
<P>
   Although thousands of workers, mostly laborers from Caribbean
islands, were killed during the construction process, the Panama
Canal was an unparalleled engineering feat that became a symbol of
the pell-mell rush for progress.
</P>
<P>
   Jungles were tamed, mountains were moved, malaria and yellow
fever were conquered. Nearly as amazing, the mammoth public works
project came in $23 million under budget. The United States spent
$352 million to build it.
</P>
<P>
   When the Panama Canal opened in 1914, the planet seemed to
become smaller. Sea travel from New York to San Francisco was
shortened by 8,000 miles and several months' time, since ships no
longer were forced to sail around Cape Horn in South America.
</P>
<P>
   The canal also helped make the United States a naval power. The
triumph was celebrated on the official Canal Zone seal: ``The Land
Divided _ The World United.''
</P>
<P>
   Panamanian officials predict that the handover of the canal will
be routine. But Holden calls the Panama Canal treaties ``a big
mistake'' and worries that the waterway's new owners will seek
higher profits by cutting back on maintenance, personnel and
training. Until now, the canal has functioned as a break-even
utility, with most of its earnings plowed back into operations and
upkeep.
</P>
<P>
   Since Holden moved to what was then the U.S.-run Panama Canal
Zone 30 years ago, he has married, reared two children and coaxed
more than 2,400 ships safely through the waterway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fell in love with it,'' says Holden, moments after the
Konkar Star had been lifted 85 feet by the first set of locks on
the Atlantic side and released into the artificial Gatun Lake.
</P>
<P>
   The length of three football fields, the Konkar Star can stow
the equivalent in weight of 250 Boeing 747s. This floating
leviathan must be shoehorned into the canal's snug-fitting locks
and squeezed through its bottleneck channels. At times, Holden's
margin for error is a matter of inches.
</P>
<P>
   The task is so tricky that the Panama Canal is the only body of
water in the world where, by law, the ship's captain must
temporarily turn over command of his vessel to the pilot _ a leap
of faith that skippers are normally loath to take. Canal pilots
earn up to $160,000 a year, more than the top executive on the
Panama Canal Commission, the joint U.S.-Panamanian agency that runs
the waterway.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very demanding pilot's job. In my mind it was the
optimum career for a seagoing person,'' says Holden, a graduate of
the Federal Maritime Academy on Long Island and a Navy veteran.
</P>
<P>
   Because of shifting world trade patterns and competition from
rail lines that haul giant freight containers from seaports to
customers, the canal is no longer the vital strategic link or the
shipping monopoly it once was.
</P>
<P>
   Yet business is booming.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 14,244 ships passed through the waterway, shelling
out a record $545 million in tolls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ninety percent of the world's ships can go through here.
That's amazing for something this old,'' Holden says.
</P>
<P>
   The waterway was so well-designed that it functions almost
exactly the way it did 85 years ago, with many of the original
parts. The canal is built like a Brink's truck but runs like a
Swiss watch, said transit operations director George Markham.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A BIT OF HISTORY &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   During the late 1800s, French engineers who were inspired and
cajoled by Ferdinand de Lesseps, the mastermind of Egypt's Suez
Canal, spent 20 years in Panama trying to excavate a sea-level
waterway.
</P>
<P>
   One member of a pickax crew was Paul Gauguin, the French
painter, who described the job in a letter to his wife: ``I have to
dig from 5:30 in the morning to six in the evening, under tropical
sun and rain. At night, I am devoured by mosquitoes.'' Gauguin
lasted a few months, then sailed for Martinique.
</P>
<P>
   De Lesseps' crusade was eventually undone by disease, landslides
and flooding from the mighty Chagres River, which cuts through the
middle of Panama. Then the U.S. government stepped in, paying the
French $40 million for the canal rights and properties and
fomenting Panama's revolt from Colombia. After the Panamanians
gained independence, the Americans took over the canal's
construction in 1904.
</P>
<P>
   Following much debate, they settled on a lock-and-dam system to
lift vessels, step by step, up and over the isthmus, then lower
them back to sea level. One of their models was the Soo Locks, the
gateway between Lake Superior and Lake Huron that was, at the time,
the world's most heavily traveled lock canal.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, U.S. planners were determined to harness the
power of the Chagres River, which was considered ``the lion in the
path'' of the waterway. By damming the Chagres and flooding the
jungle, they formed a massive reservoir to serve as a kind of water
bridge for nearly half of the canal's route.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thus, the river would become the lifeblood of the system,
rather than its mortal enemy,'' writes historian McCullough.
</P>
<P>
   The result is Gatun Lake, which covers 163 square miles.
</P>
<P>
   To Holden, the lake is the easiest and safest part of the canal
transit, and he keeps the Konkar Star churning through its
whitecaps and toward the Pacific Ocean at a steady 10 knots per
hour.
</P>
<P>
   But the pilot must stick to a tight schedule. It takes about
nine hours to cross the 50-milelong canal, and flotillas of
tankers, container ships and cruise liners wait at both entrances
for the green light to begin their journeys. A 15-minute delay by
Holden could translate into a four-hour wait for a crew three ships
behind him.
</P>
<P>
   With its pilots, traffic controllers, radar, cargo handlers,
fueling stations and 24-hour operations, the Panama Canal can seem
like a sprawling, congested international airport.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(MORE) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The threat of accidents is constant. The morning Holden boards
the Konkar Star, a Panama City newspaper carries a front-page story
about a ship that had collided with a canal dredge.
</P>
<P>
   Some vessels carry nuclear waste in their holds. Others are what
shippers call ``drugstore tankers,'' vessels packed with liquid
propane, ammonia and other chemicals. A fully loaded petroleum
tanker contains more potential energy than the atomic bomb that
detonated over Hiroshima in 1945.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, ships don't have brakes and may require 10 minutes
to stop by reversing the engines, calling in tugboats or, as a last
resort, dragging their anchors. On the high seas, captains like to
stay miles away from other vessels. On the Panama Canal, the leeway
can be a few hundred feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's four or five hours of boredom followed by five minutes of
sheer terror,'' says Holden, who is perched on a red vinyl stool in
the Konkar Star's wheelhouse and wearing sunglasses and a black
baseball cap.
</P>
<P>
   Holden always gives passing ships the widest possible berth. He
learned that lesson a decade ago when an oncoming vessel carrying
automobiles lost power and slammed into Holden's vessel, ripping a
200-foot hole in the hull.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of a passing ship, he says, ``You have to bend to her,
because she's not going to bend to you.''
</P>
<P>
   From day one, Panama Canal pilots are indoctrinated with safety
regulations. They train and work for eight years on smaller vessels
before earning ``senior pilot'' status, which allows them to handle
so-called ``panamax'' ships, such as the Konkar Star. These are the
largest ships that can fit through the canal's locks.
</P>
<P>
   Training includes tests in a multimillion-dollar pilot
simulator, which re-creates the conditions inside a ship's
wheelhouse during a transit. By twisting a few knobs, technicians
can add rainstorms, oncoming tankers and a shifting floor. It's so
realistic that students in the simulator, which is located near the
canal, have become seasick and vomited.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have all the dynamics of real life,'' says David Constable,
a pilot-training coordinator. ``Over here is the place to make a
mistake, not in the canal.''
</P>
<P>
   Delays may be frowned upon, but, in the name of safe passage,
they are unavoidable. At the Panama Canal pilots union hall,
someone has posted a sign reminding members: ``Your schedule is
more flexible than your ship.''
</P>
<P>
   In his training manual, Markham, the transit operations
director, warns rookies against getting self-righteous about their
ship's course with this verse by an anonymous scribe:
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the grave of Mike O'Day,
</P>
<P>
   Who died maintaining his right of way.
</P>
<P>
   His right was clear, his will was strong,
</P>
<P>
   But he's just as dead as if he'd been wrong.``
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
A DANGEROUS JOURNEY &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Leaving Gatun Lake, the Konkar Star enters a narrow ribbon of
water.
</P>
<P>
   This 8-mile passageway is known as the Gaillard Cut, but those
who built it called it Hell's Gorge. Their job amounted to removing
a tropical mountain of rock, shale and mud. It took seven years and
millions of pounds of dynamite to complete the task. Avalanches and
accidental explosions killed hundreds of people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The flesh of men flew in the air like birds many days,''
according to a West Indian laborer quoted by McCullough in ``The
Path Between the Seas.''
</P>
<P>
   This is where the sensation of the equatorial wilderness being
rolled back is the strongest, where the canal resembles an immense,
man-made culvert.
</P>
<P>
   Dirt hills rise sharply out of the water and tower over the
ship. Due to landslides and erosion, bulldozers, dredges and
sappers work continuously to keep the cut more than 50 feet deep,
which allows the passage of the panamax ships. The nearly nonstop
excavations have stained the canal's sparkling blue-green water a
chalky gray.
</P>
<P>
   The trip through the cut is a squeeze for the Konkar Star, but
finessing the vessel into the canal's three sets of locks seems
almost impossible. The ship is 106 feet wide; lock chambers are
just 110 feet wide.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like trying to force an olive into a full wine bottle
without spilling,'' Holden says.
</P>
<P>
   On this transit, the chore of entering the canal's second set of
locks will be left to another pilot, because Holden is ready for a
breather. It's 1 p.m., and he's been up since 3 a.m., sipping
coffee all the while to stay alert. He drinks 12 to 14 cups a day.
</P>
<P>
   Panamax vessels require two pilots on board during a voyage
through the canal, and Holden is relieved by Jose Lin Young, a
30-something Panamanian outfitted in pressed Tommy Hilfiger khaki.
Holden trots down the metal staircase to the officers' mess, which
is decorated with Greek tourism posters, and digs into a plate of
spaghetti.
</P>
<P>
   As Young guides the Konkar Star into the Pedro Miguel locks,
where the ship will begin its descent to sea level, Spiridon, the
Greek captain, inhales deeply on a Dunhill cigarette and studies
the new pilot's every move.
</P>
<P>
   After a ship moves into a lock, the water beneath the vessel is
forced out, creating pressures and currents that can push the ship
off course. Stability is provided by tugboats, which nudge the
stern of the Konkar Star, and by land-based locomotives with cables
that are attached to the port and starboard sides of the ship.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how close the ship is to the lock wall, Holden, who has
returned to the wheelhouse to watch the ship's progress, looks down
and replies: ``Right now? About 9 inches.``
</P>
<P>
   But Young makes it in, and the lock gates close behind the ship.
As water drains from the chamber, the Konkar Star slowly sinks 31
feet. By the time the ship reaches the Pacific, 52 million gallons
of fresh water will have been flushed from the canal out to sea _
the equivalent of a two-day water supply for a large city.
</P>
<P>
   When the front gate opens, the Konkar Star struggles forward. As
the locomotives strain, the port side of the ship touches the lock
wall, making a low-pitched grinding sound. Gray debris scraped off
the lock flies into the air and lands on the ship's deck.
</P>
<P>
   Shouting instructions to his mostly Filipino crew, Spiridon
races down five flights of stairs to inspect the damage. It's
impossible to see the scrape from the deck, so he climbs down a
rope ladder on the side of the ship to a tugboat waiting below.
</P>
<P>
   With both vessels moving through the canal, the portly Spiridon
balances on the deck of the tug and rubs his hands over the
20-foot-long scratch above the ship's waterline. The paint is gone,
but there appears to be no structural damage.
</P>
<P>
   After the inspection, Spiridon demands to be returned to his
ship immediately, even though the tug captain had planned to stop
briefly at a nearby wharf first. ``I don't want to leave this pilot
alone!'' Spiridon shouts.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(MORE) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Later, after the emotion of the moment ebbs, Spiridon explains
that maritime veterans are uneasy about the exodus of the
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all of the canal's remaining U.S. pilots will retire this
year, including Holden, who plans to move to Palm Harbor, Fla., at
year's end. The pilots union says that, to make up for the loss,
the incoming canal officials may cut back on training requirements
for senior pilots and reduce the number of pilots required aboard
panamax ships from two to one.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the captains? They are having a heart attack,''
Spiridon says in heavily accented English. ``They don't prepare the
new pilots very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Young shares some of these concerns. But he points out that more
than 200 of the current 275 canal pilots are Panamanians. That is
the highest number since the canal opened. Yet last year, just 30
serious accidents occurred, the lowest number since 1960.
</P>
<P>
   Mercedes Morris Garcia, a spokeswoman for the Panama Canal
Commission, insists that the transition will be smooth. But she
admits that Panama bears the burden of proof.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can say it until we're blue in the face,'' she said. ``But
people won't believe it until they see it.''
</P>
<P>
   After clearing the final set of locks, the Konkar Star steams
into the Port of Balboa on the Pacific at dusk. Because of Panama's
slender, twisting shape, the area around Balboa is the only spot on
the globe where the sun rises over the Pacific and sets on the
Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   As he bids farewell to the Konkar Star and hops aboard a tugboat
for the wharf, Holden is feeling a bit turned-around himself. He
will try to adapt to retirement in Florida, but his heart is
anchored in the former Canal Zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very comfortable life. People thought of it as a
Utopia,'' says Holden, who plays tennis and bridge with other
Zonians in his spare time.
</P>
<P>
   Now, their way of life is ending. Panamanians are taking over
the jobs once held by the Zonians, and the Panamanian government is
taking over their housing. Just a handful of Americans will be
rehired by the incoming Canal Authority, and their jobs will be
temporary.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of Americans have already left Panama. Others are
making reservations for the journey back to the United States,
though a few have decided to settle in Panama. Families must leave
by mid-August if they want the U.S. government to pay their moving
expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Americans' neat, cinderblock duplexes are already
vacant. Boats with ``for sale'' signs line the streets. Every
weekend, dozens of garage sales are held. Banks, churches and
baseball leagues have all shut down.
</P>
<P>
   Balboa High School, the main school for Zonians, graduated its
final senior class May 15 and will soon become Panama's Foreign
Ministry building.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving it all behind is proving difficult. The other day, a
Zonian who was clearly drunk was so bitter that he refused to speak
with a reporter. Nearby, in the sleepy, palm-lined American
community of Cardenas, tensions are on the rise as families are
uprooted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is all stressed out,'' says Geri Foster, a former
teacher and the wife of a canal pilot who has lived in Panama since
1966. ``You're talking about a whole community being displaced.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty-five years ago, it never seemed like this was going to
happen,'' says Foster, shaking her head. ``But here we are. It went
by awfully fast.''
</P>
<P>
   The end of an era has many Americans waxing nostalgic.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Wainio, a former canal commission official, calls the
former Canal Zone an example of Plato's idea of the benevolent
dictatorship. The zone was a government creation in which U.S.
bureaucrats managed everything from canal traffic to garbage
collection.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Duffus, 47, a dredge operator who retired a few months ago
and is preparing to pull out, says: ``It was a socialist
atmosphere. We had a government hospital. We saw government
doctors. We had a company store.''
</P>
<P>
   Markham, the canal's transit operations director, who is moving
to Florida later this month, agrees. ``When I came down here,'' he
says, ``we had our own schools, fire department, health clinics,
furniture stores and post office.''
</P>
<P>
   In the zone, many Americans maintain, there was no poverty
because everyone had a job.
</P>
<P>
   As he drank a bottle of beer by a boathouse on the edge of the
canal, a former Canal Zone police officer remembers that when he
was on patrol, there was little to investigate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a little larceny, a little burglary. Drugs were not
prevalent. Cocaine was nonexistent,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Opinion polls indicate that most Panamanians wish the Americans
would stay put. They fear that the national economy will suffer
once the U.S. government and the American residents leave. But
others are delighted to see the Canal Zone disappear after more
than nine decades.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
END OF AN ERA &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A 1903 treaty between the United States and Panama established
the Canal Zone as a 10-mile-wide strip of land hugging the proposed
canal route that was to be controlled by the United States ``in
perpetuity.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington was also granted the right to expropriate other lands
required for the construction and operation of the waterway. Such
one-sided treaty terms later became a bone of contention for
nationalist Panamanians.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, some claimed, the zone had become a racist enclave.
Retired West Indian canal workers remember the zone as a kind of
apartheid state in which neighborhoods were labeled ``gold'' and
``silver'' to distinguish between white and black areas.
</P>
<P>
   When civil rights leader Jesse Jackson toured the zone in the
1970s, he was appalled by the racial divisions. Few of the Zonians
learned Spanish and even today, some butcher the names of the towns
where they have lived for decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people would work here and never leave the zone,''
Markham says.
</P>
<P>
   The beginning of the end came in 1964, when anti-American riots
broke out after students from Panama City tried to raise the
Panamanian flag next to the U.S. flag at Balboa High School.
Panama's former military ruler, Gen. Omar Torrijos, called the zone
a ``colonialist tumor'' and vowed that it would be abolished _ even
if that meant going to war.
</P>
<P>
   By negotiating the canal treaties with President Carter,
Torrijos became a national hero. But among Zonians, the two former
leaders are widely scorned for having signed away their
livelihoods.
</P>
<P>
   Besides mandating the turnover of the canal, the treaties
returned jurisdiction of most of the Canal Zone to Panama in 1979
and set a schedule for the gradual drawdown of U.S. troops and the
closing of military bases.
</P>
<P>
   In the kitchen of his rented whitewashed bungalow near the banks
of the canal, Holden unwinds from his 14-hour day on the Konkar
Star with a glass of rum.
</P>
<P>
   He admits that U.S. control of the waterway is an anachronism.
But somehow, pulling out also feels wrong, he says.
</P>
<P>
   For veteran pilots like Holden, life on the Panama Canal was not
a job, but a calling.
</P>
<P>
   Holden and his wife, Judy, a native of New Zealand, have
reluctantly shipped some of their belongings to their house in Palm
Harbor, near St. Petersburg. But Holden refuses to leave until the
canal actually changes hands Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't feel like I'm ready to retire,'' he says. ``It's
like a horse with blinders. When you have a good life, you look
straight ahead, and you don't want to see it come to an end.''

 A BUSINESS _ SF CHRON   Training in Building Trades 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Q: I heard that there is a government program that encourages the
hiring and training of apprentices in the building trades by paying
a portion of their wages while in training. Where can I get the
information on this and possibly other related programs?
<P>
   A: The U.S. Department of Labor finances a vast array of
job-training programs and the funds typically flow through state
and local organizations. The best clearing house for information is
the Private Industry Council, which has offices in many counties.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Private Industry Council of San Francisco has
an annual budget of about $20 million, according to Interim
President Ray Holland, and more than 80 percent of the
beneficiaries are small businesses with fewer than 50 employees.
</P>
<P>
   PIC will pay qualified employers up to 50 percent of the wages
for a training period of up to 490 hours. It also administers
various youth training, welfare-to-work and tax credit programs.
For more information call (415) 431-8700 or visit the Web site at &LR; 
www.picsf.org &LR; . In Santa Clara, contact the Silicon Valley Private
Industry Council (408) 953-1500 or Web site:  &LR; www.svpic.com &LR; . In
Oakland, you can call (510) 891-9393 or visit the Web site
 &LR; www.oaklandpic.org. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Another source of information is the Division of
Apprenticeship Standards within California's Department of
Industrial Relations which you can find at the state government Web
site at &LR;  www.dir.ca.gov &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Prospecting for Patrons
</P>
<P>
   Q: My friend and I are graduating from high school and want to
open a business this summer to teach people basic skills about
using a computer and the Internet. I was wondering how to make
ourselves known to people.
</P>
<P>
   A: I gather you don't want to spend much money on promoting your
services, like taking out an ad in your favorite newspaper. One of
the best ways to promote your services, as illustrated in the
feature story today on kid entrepreneurs, is by word of mouth. No
doubt schoolmates, friends and family are aware of your abilities
and could recommend you to their friends and acquaintances.
</P>
<P>
   Using free community bulletin boards is another way to go,
according to Jay Levinson, consultant and author of ``Guerrilla
Marketing.'' Post notices with detachable tabs with your name and
phone number at markets, laundries, libraries, bookstores, schools,
computer stores, senior centers and other places that provide free
bulletin boards. Since the fastest-growing sector of the Internet
is senior citizens, Levinson especially recommends going after this
market, especially since they are happy to get lessons during the
daytime when many other prospective clients are working.
</P>
<P>
   You might consider offering your services as a free guest
speaker at senior centers or other community organization. At the
end of your discussion, you might let it be known that you also
offer individual instruction and leave some flyers.
</P>
<P>
   Levinson notes that your local chamber of commerce and reference
librarian are good sources of information on community groups and
clubs looking for speakers and instruction.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &LR;   &LR; Sizzle and Steak
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm interested in new ways to attract both customers and
employees. There's a lot of competition for both.
</P>
<P>
   A: Alas, there are no easy answers. Rieva Lesonsky, editorial
director of Entrepreneur Magazine and co-author of ``303 marketing
Tips Guaranteed to Boost Your Business,'' suggests the need to
separate your self from the pack.
</P>
<P>
   For example, instead of sending out solicitations in plain
envelopes that often get tossed before they are even opened, she
notes that some businesses gain attention by putting something
lumpy inside or having a fake coffee spill printed on the outside.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; But you better make sure that once someone opens the envelope
there is something inside to capture his or her attention. Gimmicks
alone don't work. These days, Lesonsky says, ``you have to have
both sizzle and steak.''
</P>
<P>
   To find and keep employees, you also have to be creative. Most
small businesses can't compete with big companies on salaries and
benefits. ``You have to think outside the box,'' Lesonsky suggests.
For instance, hire someone over 70 or a teenager who wants a
part-time job and doesn't care about all the other stuff.

EDITORS NOTE: Each week, The Chronicle offers readers the recipe
for an outstanding dish at a Bay Area restaurant, plus the chef's
secrets for making it a success. Tips and recipe follow in optional

 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN RAFAEL, Calif. _  &LR; Cornish hens are great for a dinner party,
but let's face it _ they can be pretty boring. Not, however, in the
case of this impressive dish from Las Camelias in San Rafael.
<P>
   Gabriel Fregosa has adapted his family recipes for the
restaurant, and the hens are one of my favorites. They get an
explosion of flavor from marinating for 24 hours in a mixture of
water, ginger, onions, garlic and tequila. You can actually taste
the warming effects of the alcohol after roasting.
</P>
<P>
   What makes this dish special is the fact that the hens are
allowed to rest for a half-hour after baking. Then they are sauteed
to add even more complex flavors.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the sauce, made from tomatoes, mushrooms, cilantro,
pickled jalapenos and the strained marinade. It simmers for at
least a a half-hour, producing a thin, intense broth.
</P>
<P>
   Other dishes that have made Las Camelias one of the best Mexican
restaurants in the Bay Area include roasted stuffed poblanos,
tamales, chicken in poblano sauce and a wonderful fish taco.
They're served in a charming restaurant that feels like a hacienda.

LAS CAMELIAS' CORNISH GAME HENS
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   3 cups water
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup tequila
</P>
<P>
   20 cloves garlic, finely minced
</P>
<P>
   2 ounces fresh ginger, grated
</P>
<P>
   1 medium onion, chopped
</P>
<P>
   11/2 teaspoons kosher salt
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon black pepper
</P>
<P>
   4 Cornish hens, about 18 ounces each
</P>
<P>
   Sauce
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon butter
</P>
<P>
   4 ounces mushrooms, thinly sliced
</P>
<P>
   1 pound fresh tomatoes, peeled, seeded and diced
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup coarsely chopped cilantro
</P>
<P>
   2 pickled jalapenos, seeded and thinly sliced
</P>
<P>
   Salt to taste
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Combine the water, tequila, garlic, ginger, onion, salt and
pepper in a bowl large enough to hold all the Cornish hens.
</P>
<P>
   Wash the hens and put them in the marinade. Make sure to get
some of the onions and ginger inside the cavity. Cover the hens,
refrigerate them in the marinade for at least 8 hours or up to 24
hours, if possible.
</P>
<P>
   Remove the hens from the marinade, scraping off the onion
mixture. Strain marinade and reserve it for the sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Place the hens on a rack in a
low-sided baking pan or broiler pan, salt and pepper them
generously and roast them for 45 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Remove the hens from the oven and allow them to rest for 30
minutes. Reserve any juices that collect in the pan for the sauce.
</P>
<P>
   While the hens are resting, make the sauce. Melt the butter in a
saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the mushrooms and cook 3 to 4
minutes until soft but not browned. Add the tomatoes and simmer 6
to 8 minutes. Add the cilantro and the jalapenos and stir for 1
minute. Taste and add salt as needed.
</P>
<P>
   Add the reserved marinade, turn up the heat and bring the
mixture to a vigorous boil. Reduce the heat and let simmer at least
30 minutes until the sauce has reduced and thickened slightly. Add
any pan juices and continue to reduce. The sauce will have a thin,
brothlike consistency but will be intensely flavored. Taste the
sauce and add salt, if needed. Keep warm.
</P>
<P>
   When ready to serve, heat the olive oil in a large saute pan
over high heat. Cut the Cornish hens in half and put them in the
pan, cut side up, to sear. Turn the hens several times to evenly
brown and crisp the skin, about 5 minutes in all.
</P>
<P>
   Serve the hens accompanied by the sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 4.

   HOMEDEPOT-CANADA _ ATLANTA _ Home Depot plans a major expansion

possible because a previous non-compete agreement with a Canadian
firm has been nullified. Depot's Canadian operations have
fluctuated since it first entered the market in 1994. A rebounding
housing market makes it a good time to expand in Canada. (Bond,

EDITORS NOTE: This column profiles Northern California growers,
anglers and artisans who make the region such a culinary
wonderland. Over the next few months, we'll take you from field to
forest to factory to look at the wealth of ingredients stocking our
larders. As a bonus, Georgeanne Brennan will offer tips for using
the bounty in fresh, innovative ways.     By Janet Fletcher  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Even in the demanding Bay Area market, where
great-tasting fruit is commonplace, Goldbud Farms cherries stand
out.
 &HT;    Plump, firm and deeply colored, the farm's flavor-packed Bings
and Rainiers have drawn crowds in years past at the Ferry Plaza
Farmers' Market, despite the fruits' breathtaking price (typically
$3.50 to $4 a pound).
 &HT;    Grower Ron Mansfield credits his mountain location for the
cherries' exceptional taste. Grown near Placerville at elevations
from 2,500 to 3,000 feet, the trees enjoy warm, not hot, days and
cool nights.
 &HT;    The moderate climate allows the fruit to mature slowly, so it
maintains natural acid as the sugar content rises. At harvest, when
the cherries may be 25 percent to 30 percent sugar, they still have
a pleasing acidity.
 &HT;    ``What you end up with is a piece of fruit that's very well
balanced,'' Mansfield says. ``You know it has sugar, but there's a
little tang, too.''
 &HT;    The area's volcanic soil has a high mineral content, which
Mansfield is convinced contributes to flavor. His painstaking
harvest regimen helps, too.
 &HT;    Color and flavor tell him when the Bings are ready to pick.
``When they get to that deep burgundy, we start to taste,'' he
says. ``When they start to take on that deep-purplish hue, they're
ready.'`
 &HT;    Workers pick each tree four to six times during the
approximately four-week course of the harvest, selecting the
darkest fruit each time. Using only their hands, they harvest the
cherries with stems attached, put them into small boxes and take
them to a packing shed. There, the fruit is graded, sized, packed,
chilled and shipped _ typically within 24 hours.
 &HT;    ``Our fruit is priced substantially higher than most,''
Mansfield says, ``but if you were to follow our harvest procedures
through delivery to market, you'd see why.''
 &HT;    The grower's 18 acres of cherries are dominated by Bings and
blush-colored Rainiers but also include Burlats, Vans, Lamberts and
the sought-after Montmorency, a sour cherry prized for pies.
 &HT;    This year _ no surprise _ the cherries are running about two
weeks late. Mansfield expects his Bing harvest to get under way in
mid-June, with the Rainiers a few days later.
 &HT;    At the market, shoppers should look for shiny cherries with
plump stems that are at least partly green, Mansfield says. Bings
should be a deep burgundy; Rainiers should be strongly blushed. The
latter variety has less natural acidity than the Bing but a flavor
Mansfield describes as ``rich and almost butterscotchy.''
 &HT;    ``I just think Ron does a fantastic job,'' says Amy Suyama,
produce buyer for the Real Food Co. ``He knows soils so well, and
he's always learning something new _ about pest control, for
example. His fruit has consistently been fantastic.''
 &HT;    Unfortunately for farmers' market shoppers, Mansfield won't be
doing the Ferry Plaza market this year. Instead, his farmers'
market crew is running a commercial kitchen, packing cherry jam and
cherry sauce from Goldbud Farms fruit. Mansfield expects those
items to be available at retail markets selling his fresh fruit.
 &HT;     Goldbud Farms cherries in season are available in the Bay Area 
 at Real Food Co. (1023 Stanyan St., 3939 24th St. and 2140 Polk 
 St., San Francisco, and 200 Caledonia, Sausalito); Monterey 
 Market (1550 Hopkins St., Berkeley); Woodlands Market (735 
 College Ave., Kentfield); Market Hall Produce (5655 College 
 Ave., Oakland), and Sigona's Farmers Market (2345 Middlefield 
 Road, Redwood City, and 399 Stanford Shopping Center, Palo 
 Alto). 
 &HT;     Visitors to the gold country also can stop by the farm store 
 at 2501 Carson Road, Placerville, (530) 626-6521, for fresh

 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; With cherry season just getting started, here are
some recipes to use when the bins start to overflow.
<P>
   &UR; Brandied Cherries &LR; . Put clean, dry, firm cherries into a
sterilized jar. Add a little sugar, and cover with brandy. Close
the jar and store in a cool, dark place. Turn the jar every day
until sugar dissolves.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Cherry Cobbler &LR; . Preheat an oven to 400 degrees. Make a
favorite cobbler crust. Pit and stem about 4 cups of cherries. Put
in a bowl, and toss with 11/2 cups flour, 1 teaspoon lemon juice
and 1/2 cup sugar. Put the cherries in a baking dish, top with the
crust and bake for about 20 minutes, or until the crust is lightly
golden and the juice is bubbling around the edges. Let stand 10
minutes before serving.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Cherry Sauce. &LR;  Pit and stem about 2 cups of cherries. Put them
in a saucepan with 1/2 cup sugar and 1/4 cup water. Bring to a boil
over medium heat and cook, uncovered, about 15 minutes or until the
juice has thickened. If desired, strain. Serve the cherries warm or
cold over ice cream or cake.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Chocolate Cherry Cake &LR; . Make a favorite two-layer chocolate
cake and chocolate frosting. Spread one layer with frosting; then
spread with very sweet chopped cherries. Add the second layer and
frost. Top with a cluster of whole cherries with stems attached.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Pain Perdu With Poached Cherries &LR; . Pit about 20 cherries. Put
them in a saucepan, and add about 3/4 cup water and 1/4 cup sugar.
Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce to a simmer, and
poach for 10 to 15 minutes or until a syrup forms and the cherries
are soft but still hold their shape.
</P>
<P>
   Dip thick slices of country-style bread in beaten eggs. Melt a
nugget of butter in a skillet. Saute the dipped bread until golden.
Serve with the cherries and their juice.

   COX-MP3 _ ATLAN TA _ Cox Interactive Media Inc. and MP3.com Inc.
on Wednesday announced a joint venture to create and operate a
number of music-related Web sites. Cox Interactive Media, which
operates a network of 30 local Web sites, will invest $45 million
in MP3.com, one of the leaders in online music distribution. The

   HOMEDEPOT-CANADA _ ATLANTA _ Home Depot plans a major expansion
in Canada, where it will double its presence over the next 3-4
years. The expansion, which includes 15-20 stores in Quebec, is
possible because a previous non-compete agreement with a Canadian
firm has been nullified. Depot's Canadian operations have
fluctuated since it first entered the market in 1994. A rebounding
housing market makes it a good time to expand in Canada. (Bond,

services in nine southeastern states, said it's considering buying
Qwest Communications International Inc. or boosting its stake in
the long-distance phone company. BellSouth, which last month paid
$3.5 billion for 10 percent of Qwest, said in a filing with the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that it could take a
controlling position in the Denver-based company. (Haddad, Atlanta

   MINDSPRING-SUED _ Neil Horsely, who runs the Christain Gallery
Web site (the one encouraging users to murder abortion doctors) is
suing MindSpring for $50 million in a suit filed today.MindSpring
was the original host of the Christain Gallery site and pulled the
site citing user compalints, terms of service agreements with users
and after an planned parenthood lawsuit named Horsely's site in an

   SUPERCOMM-SHOW _ ATLANTA _ Experts on communications networks,
gathered in Atlanta for Supercomm99, are busy building network
capacity to keep up with rolling demand. But the biggest challenge
they face is creating access. ``Right now we have a communications
superhighway, with dirt road access,'' said one official. An
official from Atlanta-based Mindspring piped up: ``We work the dirt
roads, and we're having a lot of fun!'' Telecommunications
officials say that Internet and similar communications are
burgeoning, driven by e-mail, electronic commerce and other hot
areas of activity. (Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

in the transition to his successor. The company also announced that

   TECH-HANDICAP _ Tony Perrone lost the use of his legs in 1986
when a jack under a truck he was working on broke. He had been a
network administrator for an international company. When he
recovered, he still had his knowledge of computers, but found
companies unwilling to give him a job because he was in a
wheelchair. So he started N. Ga. Wheelers, a group that trains
disabled people to use computers so they can work at home.

``I feel good because I'm healthy and because I'm contributing to

that his long-time affection for Mookie Blaylock at point guard may
be wearing off. Wilkens said he could see Blaylock as a backup or

complement Steve Smith, who was injured down the stretch. He likes

   WNBA _ The third WBA season begins Thursday as the only

EDITORS NOTE: Bay Area Classics profiles food-related businesses
more than a half century old.    Roosevelt Tamale Parlor Is Still on a Roll 
 &HT;      
 &HT;     By Jennifer Straus  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; One step off the bus at 24th and Bryant
streets and you know you're in the Mission _ and in sort of a time
warp. Here the '70s mixes with hip-hop youth culture. Your feet
begin to move to the Santana riff that repeats itself in your head.
An elderly Latino, complete with a leather cowboy hat, wrinkled &LR; 
 &LR; cowboy boots and bolo tie, nods his head.
</P>
<P>
   Across the street from a mural-adorned park sits the Roosevelt
Tamale Parlor, a business that has remained authentic through
decades of the neighborhood's evolution.
</P>
<P>
   Owned by siblings Juan and Rose Carrasco, the Tamale Parlor
serves colorful and full-flavored food to neighborhood residents
and those visitors who seek it out. ``We get quite a lot of
tourists that have never tried real Mexican food and they really
like it,'' Rose explains.
</P>
<P>
   Roosevelt Tamale Parlor was opened in the early '20s by a
Dutchman with the last name of Roosevelt. He also owned a dry
cleaners and the Roosevelt Theater (today it's called Brava for
Women in the Arts). The restaurant changed ownership several times
before it was purchased in 1950 by Juan and Luz Carrasco, parents
of the current owners, who had come to San Francisco from Jalisco,
Mexico, in the mid-1940s.
</P>
<P>
   Juan and his mother, Beatriz, went to work immediately to revamp
the entire menu. ``The previous owners were serving enchiladas with
spaghetti and French bread instead of tortillas ... They were doing
everything wrong,'' Rose says.
</P>
<P>
   Juan was the head cook until his death in 1961 when Luz took the
role of training new cooks and managing the business. By the time
she died in 1988, Rose was ready to take over as manager. She has
run the place ever since.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't cook,'' Rose says. ``I just eat. The cook tells me,
`Go taste it.' I taste it and say, `Yep, that's it!' ''
</P>
<P>
   The Carrascos intend to maintain their grandmother's Jaliscan
menu. ``I'm concerned with keeping the food at a high quality,''
Rose says. ``If there is something wrong, I expect my regulars to
say something. They keep us on our toes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here we make things not too spicy because a lot of our
clientele is non-Latino. We try to keep it middle-of-the-road _ not
so spicy that you can't eat the stuff. We give them a bottle of hot
sauce on the side.''
</P>
<P>
   Tamales are particularly in demand on holidays. At Christmas,
many non-Latinos order as many as four dozen apiece. Christmas is
also the time to special-order sweet tamales with strawberries or
pineapple.
</P>
<P>
   Rose and her head cook, Maria Perez, have experimented with
using oil rather than the traditional lard to accommodate their
clients' health concerns. But, Rose admits, ``I'm sorry to say, but
the beans taste better with lard in them; you gotta put the lard in
them. It gives them just the right flavor.'' The rice, she says,
tastes fine made with oil.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of vegetarian items, including chimichangas and
burritos, are relatively recent additions. ``When my mother was
alive we didn't have that stuff,'' Rose says. But on another health
front, ``a point of pride for us is that we went non-smoking a year
before the law went into effect,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   From the street outside the Tamale Parlor you can peek into the
window of the apartment upstairs where Rose lives with her cats and
her year-round Christmas tree. She was born and raised in the
neighborhood and has lived there for 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a nice neighborhood. Of course we have our problems with
kids tagging the buildings, but I tell people that I'm going to be
here until I die ... And they're going to bury me in my back
yard.''

FIRST OPENLY GAY AMBASSADOR EXPECTED TO BE SWORN IN NEXT WEEK
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL And JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Ambassador-designate James C. Hormel will be sworn
in to take over the long vacant U.S. diplomatic post in Luxembourg
by a Clinton administration official, possibly while President
Clinton is out of town next week, officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the 66-year-old heir to the Hormel Meat Co.,
fortune may take the oath from Vice President Al Gore or a
lower-ranking official while Clinton is on a week-long trip to
Europe beginning Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Hormel, a San Francisco philanthropist and gay rights advocate,
will become the first openly gay American to serve as a U.S.
ambassador.
</P>
<P>
   White House Deputy Press Secretary Barry Toiv said he expected
Hormel to be sworn in ``in a week or so, give or take a few days.''
</P>
<P>
   A State Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said ``there is a sense of urgency to getting this done,'' adding:
``We want to get the ambassador to Luxembourg as soon as possible
because the embassy has been without an ambassador for sometime.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton resorted to an obscure provision in the U.S.
Constitution last Friday to unilaterally install Hormel in the post
without Senate confirmation. Clinton used the recess appointment to
bypass Senate opponents who had sidetracked Hormel's nomination for
18 months.
</P>
<P>
   The Constitution permits a president to fill vacancies during a
congressional recess without Senate approval. Congress returned
from a 10-day Memorial Day recess three days after Clinton's
action.
</P>
<P>
   Hormel can serve in the diplomatic post until the end of this
session of Congress, which approximately coincides with the end of
the Clinton presidency in January 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``The swearing in is just a matter of logistics and how quickly
we can put the ceremony together and get family members and friends
to Washington,'' the State Department official said.
</P>
<P>
   Preparations for Hormel's swearing in came as Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., and the White House squared off on
Clinton's use of the recess appointment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm offended by this nomination and the way they did it,''
Lott said Wednesday. ``I think it's wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lott said he would not join Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., in
retaliating against the White House by freezing Senate action on
the 125 Clinton nominations awaiting Senate action.
</P>
<P>
   Inhofe announced Tuesday that he will seek to indefinitely block
Senate action on all Clinton nominations to protest the president's
recess appointment of a controversial nominee who has been awaiting
Senate action since approval by the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee in November, 1997.
</P>

   Inhofe vowed to use his senatorial prerogative to put ``holds''
on Clinton's nomination of Lawrence H. Summers to serve as
secretary of the treasury, Richard C. Holbrooke to serve as U.N.
ambassador and dozens of other nominees awaiting Senate action. A
hold allows a single senator to block a floor vote, though the
Senate majority leader can cancel a hold by another senator.
</P>
<P>
   Lott said he ``always...initially'' honors senators' so-called
``holds'' on presidential nominations but indicated he wouldn't
permit Inhfoe to stop the confirmation process.:
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think we have a responsibility to move the president's
nominations if they are qualified, if they don't have legal,
ethical or moral or whatever problems,'' Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   Lott said he would seek pledges from the White House to make
sure that the Clinton administration does not resort to recess
appointments in the future without extended advance notice.
</P>
<P>
   Lott said he would take steps ``so they will not do this
again,'' adding that it was important for the White House to
``understand there will be a price to pay.''

</P>
<P>
   Clinton has made 57 recess appointments over the course of his
presidency _ far less than the 239 made by President Ronald Reagan
and the 78 made by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Toiv, the White House spokesman, said presidential aides have
notified the Senate leadership in advance on every recess
appointment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This White House has done far more notification and
consultation with the Senate on recess appointments than previous
administrations _ and that will continue,'' Toiv said.
</P>
<P>
   Toiv disputed Lott's charge that the White House had not
notified the Senate leadership in advance of the Hormel
appointment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The White House notified the Senate about this recess
appointment _ and it was not on the same day that it was made
either,'' Toiv said. ``The White House is prepared, as we have
always done, to provide appropriate consultation and
notification.''
</P>
<P>
   Conservative Gary Bauer, a declared Republican presidential
candidate, said Inhofe had shown ``rare moral courage'' by standing
up to the Clinton administration's's effort to install an
ambassador ``who has leagued himself with those who mock and
denounce people of faith.''
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Birch, executive director of the Human Rights
Campaign, a pro-gay rights organization, condemned Inhofe for a
``churlish tirade and spectacular display of anti-gay
discrimination.''

INTERNET ANXIETY SEIZES BRITONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MARTIN ARNOLD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a mad world, book publishing, that's bound to go down. At
least it always views itself in tatters. Surely, for instance, the
invention of bookstore chains means the end of independent sellers.
(Just as the idea of selling books in supermarkets meant the end of
bookstores.) Or that huge author advances would kill off
publishers. Or that international publishing conglomerates would
kill off the huge advances.
</P>
<P>
   Now the buzz horror is that the concept of publishers' owning
and controlling the territorial rights to books is about to be shot
dead by the Internet. Which is one reason, although not the only
one, that many British publishers are setting up or planning
outposts in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   What is clear is that if a publisher in the future wants to be a
serious player in the global English-language market, the world's
largest, the publisher cannot stay out of its biggest and most
profitable realm, the United States. And down the road there lurks
the fear, real or exaggerated, that the Internet will snatch away
whatever profitability there is for a publisher to buy the foreign
rights to a book whose original publisher is American. If, for
instance, a customer in London can use the Internet to buy an
American author's work more quickly, and often more cheaply, than
by waiting for its British publication, then why wait? And if
buyers don't wait, what good is owning the territorial rights in
Britain? That's the theory.
</P>
<P>
   Conglomerates that own publishing houses in the United States
don't have to worry, which is why they bought American: Bertelsmann
owns Random House, Pearson owns Penguin Putnam, and Holtzbrinck
owns Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux, for instance. Now is the time for
smaller British publishers to set up houses in the United States or
perhaps buy them, and some plan to do so. That will certainly make
authors and their agents happy, since there will be more buyers at
a time when many agents complain that their market is shrinking.
</P>
<P>
   Bloomsbury, an independent literary publishing house in London
and Australia, has already launched Bloomsbury USA. It is led by
Alan Wherry, an Irishman who works out of London and whose
editorial director is Karen Rinaldi in New York. Wherry said,
``We're not a huge company, but we feel the market is quite wide
open in America for an independent publisher of strength.'' He said
that fear of being a prisoner of the Internet was not their main
reason, that that is a problem that will take care of itself.
``It's like the farmers are always complaining, but they keep on
making record advances,'' he said. ``We have no intention of being
a British publisher operating in America, but an American
publisher.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rinaldi has signed four books in the last few months for
fall publication as she has started to build an American list. The
first was a world rights deal for a debut novel about a young girl
and her sisters fighting against the madness of their parents. The
novel, by a 22-year-old woman, Suneeta Peres da Costa, was sold by
Tiffany Richards, an agent. ``For us it's fantastic; it's an extra
place for us to sell,'' Ms. Richards said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rinaldi also bought a psychological thriller and a satirical
novel. ``I'm finding a lot of really good work,'' she said,
``because the bigger houses aren't taking as many risks.'' Her main
competitors are the small- to medium-size houses (Grove, Atlantic,
Norton, and Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux, for instance), but she doesn't
rule out Random House either.
</P>
<P>
   Such an American presence gives Bloomsbury the prestige and
clout to negotiate for world rights for a book, if it can come up
with the cash, which obviously protects its territorial rights.
</P>
<P>
   For this reason, Victoria Barnsley, the publisher of Fourth
Estate, a successful and lively independent publisher in London,
said she was ``in the process of deciding how best to start some
sort of operation in America, in order to buy books on both sides
of the Atlantic.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Barnsley is less sanguine than Wherry about the Internet.
``Many in Britain feel that the whole territorial copyright will
eventually collapse because of the Internet,'' she said. ``Not
immediately, but there will be quite a breakdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're simply in the exploratory stage. If we don't do
something, Britain is going to be another state of the United
States, at least in book publishing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Orion Group in Britain is also expected to extend eventually
into America. But the grandest British entrance into American
publishing may well be the one being contemplated by Hodder
Headline, which published 1,300 titles last year, some of which
were best sellers in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Britain's biggest bookseller, W.H. Smith, acquired a 51
percent controlling interest in Hodder Headline, suddenly giving
the publisher very big pockets to buy American. Tim
Hely-Hutchinson, group chief of Hodder Headline, who recently was
saying he was in no hurry to get to the United States, said he
didn't know if the publisher would try to buy an already existing
American publishing house or start a new one. ``We'll see what's
available that represents a good value,'' he said. ``If we cannot
find one, we'll make a publisher starting from scratch.''
</P>
<P>
   The question of which books actually translate between the
readers of English and American is a different subject. Generally
American books do better in Britain than British books do in
America (except that English thrillers and mystery stories sell
well here), which is another reason the British publishers would
like to set up shop here and compete to be the original publishers
of American writers.
</P>
<P>
   The British used to own the language but now Americans own the
airwaves and the entertainment industries. The British literary
tradition is no longer Thackeray and Dickens, but the popular
Barbara Cartland, Frederick Forsyth, Jeffrey Archer and John le
Carre, so the battle is over who is to own the profits from books
written in the common language.

season. (Wilkinson, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 22. MOVED. WITH

   BBA-CANSECO _ ATLANTA _ Look who's leading the majors in home

Griffey Jr. (twice), Cecil Fielder, Albert Belle and Frank Thomas.
``I feel good because I'm healthy and because I'm contributing to

a divot from their wallet. A night's stay in a two-bedroom suite at

   BKN-WILKENS _ Coach Lenny Wilkens acknowledged in an interview
that his long-time affection for Mookie Blaylock at point guard may
be wearing off. Wilkens said he could see Blaylock as a backup or
part-timer next season. Another need, he said, is a scorer to
complement Steve Smith, who was injured down the stretch. He likes
the overall mix of the team. And, he says, his passion is equal to
any other coach's; he just doesn't throw chairs. (Denberg, Atlanta

   WNBA _ The third WBA season begins Thursday as the only
(women's) game in town, now that the ABL has folded. A labor spat
resulted in improved benefits and slightly better salaries for

But publicity has been reduced as owners look at the bottom line.
Four new franchises for next season are expected and Atlanta could

THE WEEKEND COOK  
  
</HEADLINE>
 CHRON  
EDITORS NOTE: Here is a recipe to make on the weekend, with enough
leftovers to use throughout the week in two other recipes plus
suggested ideas for other dishes. Recipes follow.    By Maria Cianci  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  June gets us thinking about the lazy days of
summer _ until we remember it's a month of celebrations, with
Father's Day and graduations for starters. And that gets us
thinking of what to make for dinner that is easy, festive and
somewhat unusual.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Crepes _ thin French pancakes _ are a good choice. You can make
them ahead; fill them with fish, fowl, fruit and more; and fit them
into any course from hors d'oeuvre to dessert. Crepes can be
refrigerated up to four days or frozen up to a month, so a batch
made on the weekend can hold you in good stead for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   There is one trick to easy crepe making: Use a nonstick pan.
With a nonstick finish, the thin film of batter practically peels
off when it's cooked. Lacking a nonstick pan, you can use a heavy
saute pan and brush the bottom with a little butter between cooking
each crepe.
</P>
<P>
   In anticipation of Father's Day, today's Weekend Recipe skips
right to dessert with a dish that puts a summery slant on crepes
Suzette. The components of the weeknight recipes may be made on the
weekend, so finishing either dish during the week _ whether for
family or company _ is quick and easy. In fact, the cannelloni is a
good entree for a graduation celebration. You can assemble it
before the ceremony and bake it after.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR; MASTER RECIPE: BASIC CREPES
</P>
<P>
   Note: These crepes are fast and easy to make. If you have 2 pans
the same size, you can make 2 crepes at once.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   6 cups all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   12 eggs
</P>
<P>
   71/2 cups milk
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon salt
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup butter, melted, + additional butter for frying crepes
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Place the flour in a large mixing bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Thoroughly whisk the eggs until well blended. Whisk in the milk
and salt.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly whisk the liquid into the flour. When the mixture is
lump-free, whisk in the melted butter. Cover and refrigerate for 2
hours before using.
</P>
<P>
   To make the crepes, heat an 81/2-inch nonstick saute pan over
medium heat. Brush it lightly with butter.
</P>
<P>
   Whisk the batter to recombine. Pour 2 tablespoons or so of the
batter into the pan. Swirl the pan so the batter covers the bottom
and slides up the sides a little. Cook 1 minute, or until the edges
of the crepe look dry and start to pull away from the pan. Peel off
the crepe with your fingers and turn it over. Cook the second side
until it is lightly speckled, less than a minute.
</P>
<P>
   Place the crepe flat in a wax paper-lined storage container.
Continue making crepes in this manner, stacking them between sheets
of wax paper when finished. You probably won't need to butter the
pan again.
</P>
<P>
   When all the crepes have been made, tightly cover the container
and refrigerate for up to 4 days. The crepes may also be frozen,
stacked between wax paper and enclosed in a freezer container or in
a double layer of freezer storage bags, for up to 1 month. Defrost
them before using.
</P>
<P>
   Yields about 30 crepes.

 &LR; WEEKEND RECIPE: SUMMERY CREPES SUZETTE
</P>
<P>
   Note: You can also make this in 2 saute pans, which will
accommodate the ingredients a little easier.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   12 ounces fresh or frozen raspberries
</P>
<P>
   1 cup fresh-squeezed orange juice
</P>
<P>
   6 tablespoons sugar
</P>
<P>
   5 tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   12 crepes (from Master Recipe)
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup Grand Marnier
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons brandy
</P>
<P>
   8 large strawberries, hulled and cut lengthwise into
1/4-inch-thick slices
</P>
<P>
   Unsweetened whipped cream, as needed
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Puree the raspberries in a food processor. Strain them, pressing
on the pulp and seeds to release as much puree as possible. You
will need 1 cup puree for this recipe.
</P>
<P>
   Stir together the puree, orange juice and sugar in a large saute
pan over medium-high heat until the sugar melts; bring to a boil.
Add the butter, swirling it until it melts. Remove the pan from the
heat.
</P>
<P>
   One by one, dip both sides of each crepe into the liquid. Fold
each crepe in half then in half again to make a triangle. Leave the
crepes in the pan.
</P>
<P>
   When all the crepes are folded, return the pan to medium-high
heat. Bring to a boil. Add the Grand Marnier and brandy; bring to a
boil, spooning the sauce over the crepes to baste them. Add the
strawberries, submerging them in the sauce. Simmer for a minute,
until the fruit is just heated through.
</P>
<P>
   Serve 3 crepes per person, along with a portion of sauce and a
dollop of whipped cream.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 4.

<P>
   FORT DIX, N.J. _ Twice a day for the last week, 52-year-old
Ramize Bajrami has walked up the metal steps into the makeshift
Internet trailer here, hoping to find news about family members she
left behind in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   She sits down at one of the trailer's 12 computers and begins to
scroll through Web sites, her gray hair pulled back in a white
kerchief. Her hazel eyes search the screen for names she has
written on a crumpled paper she clutches in her hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day she comes in here and says to me, `How can I find my
children?' '' said Kujtim Latifi, a 17-year-old Albanian refugee
and computer assistant who speaks enough English to translate for
the U.S. Information Agency staff members in the trailer.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bajrami, a refugee, has four sons who are fighting for the
Kosovo Liberation Army and a son and a daughter who she thinks are
still in Kosovo. She recently heard from her brother that another
son and his family are in Macedonia, but she has not been able to
get in touch with them them.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the Internet is her only hope _ and in that sense, Ms.
Bajrami is lucky. She has access to Web sites, to Internet radio
broadcasts, to e-mail. Refugees in most other camps around Europe
do not yet have Internet trailers like the one here; many are still
relying on dribbles of information that come in letters or week-old
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   To change that, the USIA is coordinating the Kosovar Refugee
Internet Assistance Initiative. The Internet trailer at Fort Dix is
the project's first online center. A similar center in Germany just
opened this week, said David Zweigel, USIA's overseas technologist.
</P>
<P>
   Another in Germany, two in France and two in Poland are also
about to go online, Zweigel said. Getting Internet access to the
camps in Albania and Macedonia is trickier, because fewer Internet
hubs were already in place, but officials hope to connect a pool of
laptops in Macedonia via a satellite link this week and in Albania
by mid-July.
</P>
<P>
   If the experience here is any indication, those centers will be
packed as soon as they open. Since the Fort Dix trailer opened on
May 20, Zweigel said, hundreds of refugees have visited it each
day.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, nearly 50 people had crowded into the 40-foot-long
trailer. The sounds of multiple radio and video broadcasts _ all in
Albanian _ were bouncing off the trailer's walls. In one corner,
six gray-haired men bent to the computer, listening. Next to them,
Latifi helped Ms. Bajrami find a Web site that might enable her to
send an e-mail message that could be delivered to the Macedonian
refugee camp. A little girl stood next to her, holding her hand.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the trailer, a handful of teen-age boys sat
stone-faced, scrolling through photographs of victims of a massacre
that, according to international monitors, took place in Racak in
January. The photos, displayed on an anti-Serb Web site called the
Kosova Crisis Center, show slain men sprawled on the ground and a
dead baby covered with cuts.
</P>
<P>
   When asked why the boys wanted to look at such horrific
pictures, Latifi paused then spoke: ``Because they would like to
see what the Serbs have done.'' On Monday, he said, a man who was
looking at the pictures ``saw his uncle, killed.'' Then, he said,
the man looked away and cried.
</P>
<P>
   Providing open access to information is the USIA's primary
mission, said Jonathan Spalter, associate director and chief
information officer for the USIA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Access to objective and reliable information will be key to
restoring structures of civil society for these terribly dispersed
communities of Kosovars,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Reconnecting family members is also a major part of the project.
On Tuesday, a 20-year-old refugee named Liridon Durigi, whose
parents are still in Kosovo, found that a cousin is now in a
refugee camp in Albania. He found his cousin listed on a Web site
called the Family News Network (www.familylinks.icrc.org/), which
was opened in mid-May by the International Committee for the Red
Cross. Pointing to the name, he asked a nearby computer assistant
to help him send an e-mail message.
</P>
<P>
   If the Kosovo peace settlement is actually carried out, reliable
connections between people could become even more important, added
Zweigel. ``People will be able to correspond and say, `I'm going
home. You can come home too,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, many visitors to the Internet trailer are happy to
be able to read Albanian Web sites and hear Albanian news
broadcasts. ``When these people came in and heard the news in their
own language, it was amazing,'' Zweigel said. They had just arrived
in the United States, with foreign customs and a foreign language
spoken all around them. ``It was like they felt that this made them
real people again,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   More than a dozen companies and foundations are participating in
the USIA project. Nongovernmental organizations and foundations are
managing the donations and helping to distribute equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Other groups are directing projects that could tie into the USIA
effort, such as a project led by professors and students at the
Chicago-Kent College of Law. They have been helping organizations
in Macedonia and Albania create a Web-based database of refugees'
registration information and information about what they saw in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But hurdles abound. The telephone system in northern Albania,
for example, is so limited that stringing high-speed Internet lines
is very difficult. And often the people that refugees have the
least information about _ families hiding in Kosovo, for example _
are the least likely to provide information on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Villarrubia Olga, an official for the Central Tracing Agency at
the International Committee for the Red Cross, said that people
inside Yugoslavia or in Macedonia are unlikely to give information
because they fear being discovered by Serb forces. ``They are more
comfortable'' elsewhere in Europe, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bajrami, meanwhile, sat in front of a computer here, her
eyes welling up as she wondered aloud why she had not heard from
her daughter and son still in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But then her voice strengthens. ``Everyday,'' she said, slapping
her hands against her lap and looking around her, ``I will come
until I find them.''

 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By RAVEN HILL
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congress needs to provide stronger protections for
personal and financial information, legislators told a Senate panel
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Current privacy laws have not kept up with an increasingly
technological society, said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., a member of
a bipartisan panel that testified before the Senate Banking
Committee, which is exploring new privacy legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Leahy said banks can sell customers' personal financial
information to telemarketers in return for a commission. He said
this information includes not only addresses and telephone numbers,
but also credit card purchases, payment dates and account balances.
</P>
<P>
   Leahy also said medical records are not adequately protected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Medical records contain the most intimate, sensitive
information about a person and must be safeguarded,'' Leahy said.
``Yet cross-industry mergers and consolidations have given banks
and other financial institutions unprecedented access to consumers'
medical records.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Bryan, D-Nev., said Congress needs to take action
to prevent such abuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``These abuses are not just theoretical, they are occurring,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the solutions Leahy proposed were requirements for full
disclosure to consumers by financial institutions, authority for
civil suits that would allow consumers to recoup financial damages,
and expanding the power of state attorneys general to enforce
financial privacy rights.
</P>
<P>
   The panel heard a dissenting view from Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas,
who said Congress should make a careful distinction between
``protection of'' and ``violation of'' privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am concerned that we are going one step too far and we are
invading,'' rather than protecting privacy, Paul said.
</P>
<P>
   ``For example, the status of private medical records should be
determined by negotiations between patients and doctors, with any
necessary laws and regulations being passed and enforced by state
governments.'' He added that individuals can protect their privacy
by refusing to work with institutions that do not provide adequate
protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``However, no one can refuse to deal with the ultimate monopoly
_ government,'' Paul said. ``I would say go more cautiously.''
</P>
<P>
   More credit should be given to the good intentions of
government, businesses and banks, said Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett said government is trying to address the public's
privacy protection concerns while still allowing for legitimate
third-party access to information. For example, medical research
depends on access to sensitive information, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't automatic that government regulation wants to use
information to be Big Brother. It just may be that someone wants to
use information to better serve customers,'' Bennett said. ``To
deny that information may end up hurting the customer.''

   PHOENIX - The joke is so old that now Cher even tells it on
herself.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Name the only creatures that will survive a nuclear
holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   A: Cockroaches and Cher.
</P>
<P>
   Funny, but frighteningly accurate. Fashions come and go. Music
trends are born and then they die. But Cher proudly soldiers on,
virtually immune to the tastes and mores of the public at large.
She's a woman with a heap of charisma and the survival skills of
Freddy Krueger.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say she has always been at the forefront. Indeed,
there have been periods in contemporary history when the woman born
Cherilyn Sarkisian has not been particularly vital or important.
</P>
<P>
   Even on those odd occasions, however, Cher never disappears that
deep into obscurity. Maybe an infomercial will perk up her public
profile. Her Vegas spectaculars are legendary in the lounge
capital. Even the mere suggestion of Cher getting involved in a new
romance can spark tabloid headlines.
</P>
<P>
   The perfect example of the sheer power of Cher: She made the
cover of ``People'' when she was suffering from the mysterious
Epstein-Barr Syndrome, a condition that causes chronic fatigue.
Only Cher could make headline news out of a condition that makes
the sufferer want to do nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Cher's multimedia career has branched into so many areas through
the years that her talent as a vocalist sometimes get overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   Even Cher herself constantly knocks her vocal talent in
interviews. But her dark, earthy vibrato is instantly recognizable,
even though the songs she sang in the '60s bear little resemblance
to what she's doing in the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   That is one of the most striking things about Cher's musical
career. No one will ever put her in the same league as a Streisand
or a Sinatra. ``Gypsys, Tramps &AMP; Thieves'' may have sold millions
of copies, but it's hardly timeless. Instead, it's kitschy and
playful and disposable. Cher's huge musical career has been built
on a mountain of disposable pop. You have to admire that.
</P>
<P>
   Cher probably knows that, too. When she last played Phoenix in
1990, she skipped over all her hit singles from the '60s and '70s,
focusing instead on her bombastic pop of the late '80s. It was a
good show, but Cher without ``Half-Breed'' is like Led Zeppelin
without ``Stairway to Heaven.'' OK, not quite, but it's certainly
Huey Lewis without ``Stuck With You.''
</P>
<P>
   No word on whether she'll delve into her mammoth back catalog on
her ``Believe,'' tour, which begins in Pheonix, but the teasing
radio commercials include songs from every phase of her staggering
career. In fact, most of the kids who put ``Believe'' at No. 1
earlier this year probably have no idea that ``Take Me Home'' was
(begin ital ) the (end ital) roller-disco hit of 1979. In fact, to
clear things up a bit, we have neatly divided Cher's musical career
into some easy-to-remember categories:
</P>
<P>
   - I'm Not a Folkie, I Just Act Like One Period (1965-70):
Subtitled The Barney and Betty Years, this is when Cher and
Svengali/genius hubby Sonny Bono dressed in matching fur vests,
looking like refugees from Bedrock. Together, they recorded the
classic ``I Got You Babe'' _ her first No. 1, in 1966 _ and became
a symbol for the peace-and-love generation. This, although both
were strongly anti-drug, which pretty much doomed their hipness
quotient in that foggy time.
</P>
<P>
   On her own, Cher batted such smashes as a cover of Bob Dylan's
``All I Really Want to Do'' (1965). Strangely enough, it is a solo
record, although she does an amazing facsimile of Sonny's off-key
warbling at certain points in the song. Sonny wrote other hits for
her during this time, including 1966's Romanian-sounding ``Bang
Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)'' _ later covered by Sinatra! _ and
1967's ``You Better Sit Down, Kids,'' a divorce epic that eerily
foreshadowed wh at was to come for the Bonos.
</P>
<P>
   - The Bob Mackie Era (1970-74): Also known as the ``I Want to Be
Keely Smith'' Period. Sonny and Cher reinvented themselves for the
Vegas crowd. They adopted an act that liberally borrowed from Louis
Prima and Keely Smith, with Sonny being the goofy paesan (Prima)
and Cher the wisecracking, deadpan wife (Smith). It worked so well,
the duo got their own variety show on CBS and wound up back on the
charts.
</P>
<P>
   Together, they had hits like 1972's ``A Cowboy's Work Is Never
Done'' and 1973's ``Mama Was a Rock and Roll Singer, Papa Used to
Write All Her Songs,'' a nine-minute dirge that obviously had some
autobiographical touches in it. More memorable was ``When You Say
Love'' (1972), which was adapted from a Budweiser commercial. Fizzy
and refreshing, like beer itself.
</P>
<P>
   Solo-wise, Cher had what should ultimately be considered her
holy triumvirate of trashy hits. She topped the charts three times:
1971's ``Gypsys, Tramps &AMP; Thieves,'' 1973's ``Half-Breed'' and
1974's ``Dark Lady.'' All were story songs with sad endings. In
``Gypsys,'' she's unwed and pregnant.`` Half-Breed'' finds her torn
between two cultures _ ``Both sides were against me since the day I
was born!'' she wails, while a tom-tom beats out an infectious
rhythm. What Native American folkie Buffy Sainte-Marie thought of
the whole thing, we'll never know.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dark Lady'' is the most feverish of the three, as a put-upon
Cher winds up murdering the title character after discovering the
woman in bed with her cheating spouse. It was better than anything
on ``Guiding Light'' that year, that's for sure.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly enough, this commercial high period ended with Cher and
Sonny divorcing in 1974. The ensuing period (The Dark Years, Mark
One) is quiet on the commercial front. Cher produces no hits,
though the album ``Allman and Woman'' (1977) proves that her brief
marriage to Gregg Allman won't make anyone forget our man Sonny.
</P>
<P>
   - The Princess Warrior Era (1979-1980): Cher not only cheerfully
hopped on the disco train, she dressed up in a gold outfit with a
pair of shiny moose antlers on her head, like a woman with a
Bullwinkle fetish. The garish costume was the visual highlight of
``Take Me Home'' (1979); musically, the album peaked when the title
song went into the top 10. And with its one-night stand theme, it
also established Cher's reputation as the eternal party girl.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``Prisoner'' followed in 1980. That album cover featured Cher
nude, in chains, though exactly what she's a prisoner of is never
really spelled out. The roller-disco anthem ``Hell on Wheels'' spun
off from that album, even serving as the theme to Linda Blair's
``Roller Boogie,'' a film that will never rival ``Mask'' in the
sentimental sweepstakes.
</P>
<P>
   With disco dying about as fast as it came in, Cher's recording
career slumped once again. ``Black Rose'' (1980) found her fronting
a hard-rock band, looking like Chrissie Hynde in Zsa Zsa Gabor's
clothes. ``I Paralyze'' (1982) featured Cher as a new-wave mama,
wearing a funky pair of mirrored shades on the cover and singing
the title song, a sweet Popsicle written by John Farrar,
better-known as Olivia Newton-John's producer. But essentially, we
have already entered The Dark Years, Mark Two, at least musically
speaking.
</P>
<P>
   - The Bon Jovi Years (1987-1992): Her potent skills as an
actress made the '80s a heady period for our heroine. But she
stayed out of the recording studio until she resurfaced in 1987
with the self-titled ``Cher.'' With ``Moonstruck'' winning hearts
in the movie theaters, Cher broke hearts on the radio with the
Michael Bolton power ballad ``I Found Someone.''
</P>
<P>
   Even better was the guitar-heavy ``We All Sleep Alone'' (1988),
which Jon Bon Jovi wrote for Cher. Coincidentally, she had a fling
with Jon's bandmate Richie Sambora, who later became Mr. Heather
Locklear. It's one of those weird Hollywood triangles.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``If I Could Turn Back Time'' (1989) emerged as Cher's theme
during this time. Not only was the song undeniably catchy, the
memorable music video featured a scantily clad Cher performing in
front of a hyped-up crew of horny sailors. The video was amazingly
phallic (check out Cher sitting on top of an enormous gun barrel!)
and somehow patriotic, making her a modern-day Betty Grable for our
men in uniform.
</P>
<P>
   The hits began to taper off following 1991's outstanding ``Love
Hurts'' album (The Dark Years, Mark Three). But, of course, we're
talking about Cher, so an astonishing rebirth was just around the
corner. Part of it was due to a retro-disco album, the other part
to an ex-husband's untimely death.
</P>
<P>
   - The ``My Life Is So Interesting, `Behind the Music' needs 90
Minutes to Tell It!'' Period (1998-present): Sonny Bono's death
from a skiing accident put Cher back in the headlines in 1998. So
did his funeral, at which she delivered a tearful, heartfelt
eulogy. Then again, it was very Hollywood: How many funerals
feature the ex-wife speaking from a podium while the current wife
sits quietly in the pew?
</P>
<P>
   Then came an autobiography (``The First Time''). In typical Cher
fashion, it was unconventional, with every chapter focusing on a
``first'' in Cher's life. Yes, there is a section on losing her
virginity.
</P>
<P>
   But the thing that truly established the viselike grip that Cher
has on the public was a trendy little disco song called
``Believe.'' The tune went to No. 1 in 23 countries, including the
United States and England. At 52, she became the oldest woman to
ever have a No. 1 hit, probably not something she's bragging about.
</P>
<P>
   The song, like most of Cher's greatest moments, is utterly
disposable. But it also has a great hook: a little trick in the
recording that makes her voice sound temporarily robotic. It's cool
and unsettling at the same time, a bit like the song itself.
</P>
<P>
   Cher's now climbing up the charts with the second single from
the ``Believe'' album, a thumping retro-disco tune called ``Strong
Enough.'' It sounds like something that could have come from Studio
54 circa 1978. It's a great tune, but Cher has so far avoided
recording the disco song that was born to be performed by no one
else but her:

 &HT;    STRENGTHEN PRIVACY LAWS, LEGISLATORS URGE CONGRESS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By RAVEN HILL
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congress needs to provide stronger protections for
personal and financial information, legislators told a Senate panel
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Current privacy laws have not kept up with an increasingly
technological society, said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., a member of
a bipartisan panel that testified before the Senate Banking
Committee, which is exploring new privacy legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Leahy said banks can sell customers' personal financial
information to telemarketers in return for a commission. He said
this information includes not only addresses and telephone numbers,
but also credit card purchases, payment dates and account balances.
</P>
<P>
   Leahy also said medical records are not adequately protected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Medical records contain the most intimate, sensitive
information about a person and must be safeguarded,'' Leahy said.
``Yet cross-industry mergers and consolidations have given banks
and other financial institutions unprecedented access to consumers'
medical records.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Bryan, D-Nev., said Congress needs to take action
to prevent such abuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``These abuses are not just theoretical, they are occurring,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the solutions Leahy proposed were requirements for full
disclosure to consumers by financial institutions, authority for
civil suits that would allow consumers to recoup financial damages,
and expanding the power of state attorneys general to enforce
financial privacy rights.
</P>
<P>
   The panel heard a dissenting view from Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas,
who said Congress should make a careful distinction between
``protection of'' and ``violation of'' privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am concerned that we are going one step too far and we are
invading,'' rather than protecting privacy, Paul said.
</P>
<P>
   ``For example, the status of private medical records should be
determined by negotiations between patients and doctors, with any
necessary laws and regulations being passed and enforced by state
governments.'' He added that individuals can protect their privacy
by refusing to work with institutions that do not provide adequate
protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``However, no one can refuse to deal with the ultimate monopoly
_ government,'' Paul said. ``I would say go more cautiously.''
</P>
<P>
   More credit should be given to the good intentions of
government, businesses and banks, said Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett said government is trying to address the public's
privacy protection concerns while still allowing for legitimate
third-party access to information. For example, medical research
depends on access to sensitive information, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't automatic that government regulation wants to use

<P>
   DURRES, Albania _ Florida restaurant owner Anthony Hoti took his
hypertension pills and hid his feelings, but those in the large
Kosovar Albanian family he came home to reunite could not control
their emotions.
</P>
<P>
   His sisters cried as they saw him and began recounting how they
were threatened away from and burned out of their homes by Serb-led
Yugoslav forces. His beautiful niece Diana, 18, hugged him and
wept, then collapsed to the ground, shaking and hyper-ventilating.
She was carried away and laid under the shade of a nearby tree.
</P>
<P>
   Once a young fighter in the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army,
relatives explained she has had panic attacks since Serb soldiers
held her for a night and tortured her in ways she has yet to fully
describe. Her father, Hoti's brother-in-law, has not been seen
since his capture by the Serbs months ago.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first day of homecoming for Hoti and his wife, Sadie,
who were born in war-torn Kosovo province and immigrated to
America. By telephone, they had spoken to some of their relatives
who had fled Kosovo along with more than 800,000 ethnic Albanians
since NATO began bombing Yugoslavia on March 24. Now, Hoti came to
see them and see about getting some to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   After 24 hours on the ground Wednesday, this is what was known:
One niece's husband was killed; a brother-in-law was missing; a
niece was traumatized beyond control. Some had been beaten and
others had spent a week in the woods.
</P>
<P>
   There was some good news. Hoti found three sisters and a
brother, and Sadie had spoken to her sister. But, they were
scattered around private homes and refugee camps, and they were not
as they used to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't recognize the faces, they look so bad,'' Sadie
(pronounced, ``Sa-DEE-yeh'') Hoti said after climbing back into the
car from their first stop. Her in-laws, prosperous in Kosovo, were
now gaunt and bored.
</P>
<P>
   The Hotis, who are from Lake Worth, Fla., last visited Kosovo
three years ago. There, they had seen their families in large homes
and happy, though concern was evident over the growing animosity
toward the province's majority ethnic Albanian population from the
Serbs who control the rest of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   When Serb leader Slobodan Milosevic, the president of
Yugoslavia, rejected a peace plan in March and NATO warplanes began
nightly bombings, Yugoslav troops and Serb police intensified their
terrorizing efforts to drive Kosovar Albanians from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Hoti, 43-year-old owner of Little Daddy's Pizza Restaurant,
helped run a pro-Kosovar rally in West Palm Beach, Fla., and tried
to get in touch with relatives. He and two brothers have homes and
restaurants in Palm Beach County.
</P>
<P>
   He and Sadie, 31, had brief phone conversations with some
relatives, now refugees from their hometown of Djakovica in
southwest Kosovo. But, they have not tracked them all down.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of an uncle in an Albanian-Austrian aid agency,
they found the families of three of Hoti's sisters in a small
farmhouse near this coastal city, about an hour from the Albanian
capital, Tirana.
</P>
<P>
   The homeowner, an 80-year-old retired miner, had seen the ragged
refugees riding on the road near his home and invited them to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I accepted them as Albanians. They had no place to live,''
said Hussein Kadria, who now has 38 people sharing his
three-bedroom house. In addition to a large suitcase of clothes for
his own family, Hoti left the man $1,000 in gratitude.
</P>
<P>
   Around a table on the porch, Hoti's family reviewed their last
two months.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before leaving Djakovica in early April, Hoti's
brother-in-law Sefadin Arapi, 35, had been arrested and beaten into
unconsciousness by Serb police. He was now recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Police had held a knife to the throat of his wife Nanije, Hoti's
sister. They destroyed and looted their home, eventually burning
it.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the international peace plan being brokered by NATO
leaders, and whether she would feel safe returning, Nanije Arapi
cannot answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``My brain is blocked. I'm confused. The situation is
impossible,'' she said gazing at a field where a few cattle grazed
near an abandoned slaughterhouse. ``All our hopes are with the
United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Family members talked about seeing neighbors shot while unarmed
and how they were given just minutes by masked Serb paramilitary
thugs to gather a few things and begin a day's walk to the Albanian
border.
</P>
<P>
   About an hour's drive away from the farmhouse, Hoti found one of
his brothers living in a refugee camp made set up in an abandoned
military warehouse. About 300 Kosovars live there, fortunate that
they are not under the same scorching summer sun as their
countrymen in tent camps here.
</P>
<P>
   But, Shefki Hoti, 51, said that 70 people share each bathroom.
He and his family of seven have one small room with no furniture,
just mattresses on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   A high school biology teacher, Shefki Hoti fled with his family
for a week in the Kosovo mountains, then tried to return to their
town before being chased away again. His home was looted and
burned, as was his Mercedes-Benz and high school. He tried to put
his family up in a hotel, but is now out of money.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can I say? I want to join my brothers in the United
States. I am the oldest one,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Hoti said he is applying through the Red Cross to bring
his family out of Albania to the United States. Most said they
would someday like to return to Kosovo and rebuild their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have strong emotions that I cannot show them because I know
they are going to cry,'' Hoti said in a moment away from his
brother. It was mid-afternoon and he was about to set off on a
three-hour a drive to a town where they hoped to find Sadie's
sister.

PLAYING TO CAMERA OR LIVE AUDIENCE, ACTORS CALIBRATE THEIR CRAFT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ROBIN POGREBIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Throughout the Broadway revival of ``Death of a
Salesman,'' Brian Dennehy's fingers keep worrying his brow, as if
trying to relieve or erase all the burdens bearing down behind it.
</P>
<P>
   Were he playing the role of Willy Loman on film, Dennehy said,
the camera might simply capture such a gesture with a close-up.
Instead, he said, he must make the movement absent-minded enough to
seem real, yet deliberate enough to reach an audience of 1,000
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The torture that he's going through is very much an emotional
torture,'' Dennehy said of his character. ``It has physical
manifestations but it's through the eyes where you see the agony
that he feels. Your job as an actor is to indicate that close-up to
a large number of people. Obviously, if you have a camera it's
easier to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Dennehy, winner of this year's Tony Award for leading actor in a
play, is one of an army of actors who have appeared onstage this
season and who are as well or better known for their work in film
and television. Others include Kevin Spacey, Natasha Richardson,
Uma Thurman, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Tony Danza, Nicole Kidman,
Swoosie Kurtz, Tom Wopat, Dylan Baker, Richard Chamberlain,
Bernadette Peters, Stockard Channing, Matthew Broderick and
Laurence Fishburne. The list seems endless.
</P>
<P>
   Each has developed the distinct arts of playing to a camera and
playing to an audience. And while they say there is no one right
way to act in each medium, actors have arrived at their own
conceptions of what works.
</P>
<P>
   They also have clear ideas about the differences between the two
mediums in terms of preparation, concentration, priorities, their
relationship to the audience and who is ultimately in control.
``Film is a director's medium; your performance is shaped by him
and the editor,'' Ms. Richardson said. ``Whereas you shape it in
the theater every night and finally the director has gone home and
it's just you doing those words.''
</P>
<P>
   Without the benefit of a camera up close on the eyes, actors say
they have to enlist their entire bodies consciously to convey
thoughts or feelings. ``Something happens to your body when you're
onstage,'' said Ms. Peters, who won a Tony for leading actress in a
musical for her performance in the revival of ``Annie Get Your
Gun.'' ``It has to be real, but it also has to fit the room.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Richardson said her current role in ``Closer'' would in many
ways be easier on film because so much of the play is about the
minute, private moments that draw and divide two people. She
recalled an observation about acting for the theater by Peter
Brooks in Al Pacino's film about the making of his production of
``Richard III,'' something to the effect that, ``Acting truthfully
loudly is much harder than acting truthfully quietly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That is why this play is particularly hard, because it's so
intimate,'' said Ms. Richardson, whose engagement in ``Closer''
ends this weekend. ``A lot of the time the audience is like flies
on the wall in a scene that really might be more suited to film.
But you have to communicate to a 1,200-seat house of some people
sitting miles away. It's very hard to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of this need to project physically and vocally, actors
say they have to be more careful to pace themselves. ``You have to
be in better shape for Broadway,'' said Wopat, who is starring
alongside Ms. Peters and is best known for his work in the
television series ``The Dukes of Hazzard.'' ``In television, you
can go in there sick as a dog and pull it together for a minute on
screen.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, watching actors go through emotionally wrenching
experiences onstage, it is hard not to wonder how they do it night
after night, sometimes twice a day with matinees. How do they go to
the despairing, draining precincts of, say, a Willy Loman without
winding up exhausted or depressed themselves?
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is, it's acting,'' said Dennehy. ``If I really
was going there, I'd be in a rubber room. So you don't really go
there.''
</P>
<P>
   It was because he failed to keep this in mind, Dennehy said,
that he wound up in a hospital with high blood pressure last March,
forcing the show to cancel three performances because he has no
understudy.
</P>
<P>
   His cardiologist, who came to see the show, put him on
blood-pressure medication and advised him to drink less alcohol,
eat more fruit and vegetables and have his meals regularly and
earlier in the day rather than after the evening performance. And
to exercise. ``He said, `Your body doesn't know it's acting,'''
Dennehy said. `` `Your body feels this enormous stress. So your
heart is pounding, your blood pressure is rising.'''
</P>
<P>
   Because film work requires one or two takes, Dennehy said, the
process is less taxing; it's the waiting around and the 14-hour
days that wear him out.
</P>
<P>
   As much as physical presence, words count onstage in a way that
they don't in the movies, many actors say. ``In the theater,
language is sacred,'' said Ms. Kurtz, who won an Obie Award in May
for her performance off-Broadway in ``The Mineola Twins.'' ``On
film, what people say is really the least important thing. It's the
things that happen between the lines that are the most profound.''
</P>
<P>
   The differences require different methods of preparation. In
film, several actors said, the process generally amounts to
practically nothing at all. ``You meet the man who plays your
husband at 7:30 and immediately you start filming the scene where
he tells you he's leaving you,'' Ms. Kurtz said. ``You're expected
to still deliver under these circumstances. You're still expected
to create a fully rounded character.''
</P>
<P>
   Other actors, like Jennifer Jason Leigh, who starred in
``Cabaret'' earlier this season, say they prepare extensively,
doing research on their roles through reading or reporting, for
example.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Whatever their homework for movie roles, the actors said, they
are largely expected to undertake it by themselves, with little or
no rehearsal or acting direction. ``Film is all about working on
your own, coming up with everything that you can about the script,
relationships with other people, how you want the scene to go,''
said Baker, who appeared in the film ``Happiness'' and the
off-Broadway revival of ``That Championship Season.'' ``It's all
work done before you get to the set.''
</P>
<P>
   In theater, on the other hand, ``a director wouldn't consider a
play rehearsed unless he had an hour for every page of a script,''
Baker said. ``With film scripts, if you get a director who likes to
rehearse, you might spend two to three minutes per page and that's
your rehearsal,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   David Marshall Grant, an actor who played one of the first
recurring gay characters on a drama series on ``Thirtysomething''
and who appeared in ``Angels in America'' on Broadway, said it may
be best not even to attempt such preparation when working in
television or film. ``I have carefully planned things out and
thought about the most interesting choice I could make and when I
get on set, all it's doing is getting in the way,'' he said. ``The
decision to tap my foot to indicate nervousness may not even get in
the shot.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Grant, who wrote the off-Broadway play
``Snakebit,'' argued that the best acting technique for film and
television may be no technique at all. ``The more you can relax and
forget that you're being filmed, the better off you're going to
be,'' he said. ``That's why you can take people off the street and
put them in a movie and they can be brilliant. Stage acting
requires a certain amount of technique. I'm not sure what
techniques there are in film acting other than being truthful. The
actors who do it best live their roles 24 hours a day, so there's
no entering and leaving a part. They just behave until the movie's
over.''
</P>
<P>
   In film, actors say, they need to develop greater powers of
concentration, because there are so many distractions on the set.
In theater _ with the exception of a few snoozers or
candy-wrapper-openers _ people are paying attention. ``Everybody's
looking at you and listening to you,'' Dennehy said. ``In film, you
can be doing an emotional and powerful scene while behind you, 25
guys are drinking coffee and nobody cares.''
</P>
<P>
   While working on her television series ``Sisters,'' which ran
until 1996, Ms. Kurtz said she simply grew accustomed to acting
amid activity. ``Someone fastening a body mike, somebody pinning my
costume, someone fixing my hair, someone powdering my nose, all two
seconds before a take,'' she said. ``I just got used to it.''
</P>
<P>
   In theater, actors say audience members are far from passive
observers; they play a decisive role in the quality and energy of a
performance. As a result, actors often get asked ``How was the
house?'' meaning, how was the crowd. At one recent performance of
``Closer,'' for example, Ms. Richardson said she was thrown because
the audience laughed during the difficult final scene of Act I,
when she is breaking up with her husband. Usually, she said, there
is utter silence. ``How they respond makes you respond
differently,'' Ms. Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
   This kind of give and take, of going through something with an
audience, actors say, is entirely lacking in film. Actors say they
never get to experience such immediate reaction to their film roles
as they are performing them. ``You're no longer part of the
dance,'' Grant said. ``You could be in Miami when someone else is
having this extraordinary relationship with you. And I'd rather be
there when it gets hot.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the nicest thing about film, actors say, is being able
to do a scene until it is right and never having to do it again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I'd like to say, `I got off on the wrong foot. Can
we just say cut and start again?''' Ms. Richardson said. ``That's
the great frustration, that you have to live with less than perfect
moments. The great satisfaction of film is at the end of the day
you've done it and for good or for bad you've accomplished the work
and it disappears into the ether.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, many actors say, it is exactly because they
cannot stop and do it over _ because they have to make a scene work
while it's happening _ that theater keeps them coming back for
more. ``I love the terror of it, the fact that I don't know what's
going to happen moment to moment and I have to keep going no matter
what,'' Ms. Kurtz said. ``And that you are out there without a
net.''

CHER ON FILM

   aspect of Cher's career. She's got a whole film career to fall
back on if the hits ever stop. Here's a look at some of her best:
</P>
<P>
   ``Good Times'' (1967) _ Probably not one of her favorites, but
Sonny and Cher are goofy and endearing in this comic fantasy about
the duo making their first film. Plenty of musical numbers,
including an ``unplugged''-style ``I Got You Babe.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Come Back to the Five and Dime Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean'' (1982)
_ Robert Altman directed this twisty little fable about the reunion
of a James Dean fan club. Secrets unfold as the Dean disciples
gather in Texas, near the spot where the actor filmed ``Giant.''
Cher is both funny and poignant as the trash-mouthed Sissy, while
Sandy Dennis, Karen Black and Kathy Bates round out the fine
ensemble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mask'' (1985) _ Cher is the mother of a child suffering from
facial disfigurement in a heartfelt performance that should have
won her an Oscar but didn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suspect'' (1987) _ In the '70s, the thought of Cher as a
sober-minded public defender would have inspired laughs. In the
'80s, it made for a potent thriller that teamed her with Dennis
Quaid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moonstruck'' (1987) _ She deservedly won the golden statuette
for this wistful romantic tale, scripted by John Patrick Shanley
(also an Oscar winner). The scene where she slaps a love-struck
Nicolas Cage and yells ``Snap out of it!'' is worth the price of a
rental alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mermaids'' (1990) _ A nifty coming-of-age story starring Cher
as a free-spirited mom, with Winona Ryder and Christina Ricci
first-rate as her two daughters. Cher's romance with Bob Hoskins is
sweetly underplayed, a nice touch. &QL;

WRITING ABOUT RACE, WALKING ON EGGSHELLS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By MARGO JEFFERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The topic was ``Blasphemy: What You Can't Say Today in
America.'' The setting was a panel sponsored by the writers'
organization PEN, and blasphemy was being quite broadly defined as
irreverent or insulting treatment of anything held sacred. But we
are such a disparate, segmented society that there is no such thing
as one standard. One group's blasphemy is another's piety. Trouble
comes when you offend someone with the legal, financial or cultural
power to censor and ostracize you.
</P>
<P>
   American writers have come up against the power of the law, but
what they usually run into is the power of the dollar or the powers
that make and break reputations. All writers worth reading come up
against the power of their private censors.
</P>
<P>
   The panel took place at New York University last month. The
moderator was a law professor interested in the legal boundaries of
censorship. But the panelists (three writers, a filmmaker and a
theologian) were more suited to talk about what happens when one is
left alone with the constraints the psyche imposes on the
imagination, and with anxieties about how one's audience will
respond.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Peter Gomes, a minister at Harvard University, relished
displaying his admiration for George III and his conviction that
the basic tenets of the Declaration of Independence were, in fact,
untenable. The author Cynthia Ozick was extremely nervous, she
said, given her respect for public civility and the presence of
Gomes, about declaring that the moral progress embodied by the
story of Abraham and Isaac had been eradicated when Christianity
returned human sacrifice to the center of religion with the story
of the Crucifixion. ( Gomes did not respond.)
</P>
<P>
   Francine Prose, the writer, observed that often one can write
and publish what one wants, only to have it ignored or misread by
critics and those who depend on critics. Call it censorship via
benign or malign neglect.
</P>
<P>
   Which brought to mind my favorite example of the malign sort,
found in a newspaper review of ``The Awakening,'' Kate Chopin's
1899 novel of female lust and infidelity. Faced with those
distasteful subjects, the critic simply pulled back and announced,
in a perfect union of arrogance and ignorance: ``A fact which we
have all agreed not to acknowledge is as good as no fact at all.''
</P>
<P>
   This, in turn, got me thinking about what critics don't say or,
more precisely, feel they can't say, what facts and feelings they
do not acknowledge when they _ when we _ write.
</P>
<P>
   For instance: I saw a shelf full of ``Beloved'' videos at my
local Blockbuster the other day, and flashed back to my own review,
which had been enthusiastic, even impassioned, and quite naive
about the cultural detritus that surrounded the whole enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beloved'' was a box-office failure when it opened last October
despite a media extravaganza that included cover stories in Time
and Vogue and virtually free advertising on Oprah Winfrey's
television show. Ms. Winfrey even offered audiences the chance to
dine with her and the other stars if they bought tickets during
opening week and wrote essays about the film.
</P>
<P>
   All of this was offset a scant week after the opening by a blitz
of doomsday reporting. Look how badly it did in that crucial
opening weekend compared with ``Bride of Chucky!'' Hollywood
producers and directors, some of whom didn't want their names used,
issued gloomy assessments about what a tough sell serious black
films would be in the future. It looks pretty grim, they said, as
if they weren't the ones who had the power to make it otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving mogul hypocrisy behind, it's clear that Ms. Winfrey made
a mistake by starring in the film as well as producing it. She tied
it too closely to her own audience appeal. If you were tiring of
her show's incessant focus on self-help and spiritual development,
for example, you were that much more likely to nix her movie. It's
very tricky to filter a movie about the horrors of history through
a triumphantly successful celebrity power broker. It gets even
trickier if that celebrity is black and the film is about slavery.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever I write a column about some cultural wrong or
double-dealing that harms blacks, I get letters insisting that Ms.
Winfrey's success proves me wrong. On top of that, we all know (yes
we do) that women with great power must deploy great tact. Surely
some of those same moguls who so quickly branded the film a loser
(making it instantly less appealing to undecided viewers) had been
longing to tell Miss Producer and Star to stick to her television
show, her cable network for women and occasional appearances in
other people's movies.
</P>
<P>
   Now for the audiences that stayed away, both white and black.
Many whites stayed away, some said, because they are still in a
state of denial about our troubled racial past. Absolutely. There
are also whites who don't live near blacks, who don't generally
visit big cities, and can limit their media access to blacks. They
probably didn't go because they aren't interested in our troubled
racial past unless it gets in the way of their present or future.
Call them the ``suppose we had a national conversation on race and
nobody came?'' crowd. (More white characters might have brought in
more white viewers, but ``Beloved'' just doesn't have many.)
</P>
<P>
   So what about the black audiences who, in the end, would have
made the difference? They didn't turn out either. Was this another
form of denial? Shame instead of guilt?
</P>
<P>
   Plenty resent the fact that movieland blacks are usually
confined to shootouts or slave ships. So they punished ``Beloved''
as they had punished ``Amistad.'' (Why do I say ``they''? Because I
think blacks, a k a ``we,'' should have turned out in droves for
both; they were strong movies.) Slavery just isn't image-enhancing
enough. At the NAACP Image Awards this year, Ms. Winfrey was firmly
rebuked when top honors went to those frolicsome soul sisters who
showed us how Stella got her groove back.
</P>
<P>
   We are always affected by what we happen to be feeling about a
group when it becomes the subject of a movie. These feelings don't
have to be violent or constant, they just have to shoot in and out
of our thoughts and conversation. It is no leap of the imagination
to hear some whites saying: `` `Beloved?' I am so tired of hearing
about black wrongs and white guilt. Slavery was terrible. Let's
worry about crime and affirmative action now. Anyway, I'm sure it's
going to be very P.C. No, I haven't read the book. But do you think
Toni Morrison really deserved the Nobel Prize?''
</P>
<P>
   Now for a little black dialogue. ``Fine, call it the rage of the
black middle class. I do not want to see any more black people in
rags talking ebonics. Whites always go out of their way not to show
people like us in movies. We're the real threat _ they can't
patronize us. As far as I'm concerned, `Beloved' is just another
minstrel show.''
</P>
<P>
   I didn't write any of this while the movie was still in
circulation. I did hear people talking. No, let me be more precise.
I heard plenty of black people talking in the ways reported here.
The kinds of white responses cited were passed on to me by friendly
white informants.
</P>
<P>
   If I had hoped my intellectual approach might counter some of
these reactions I was wrong. More to the point, I disliked the
thought of getting mail or calls from whites telling me I was
defensive and presumptuous about their reactions, and from blacks
telling me that, besides airing private talk in public, I had
mocked and trivialized their criticism.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, writing about race can make you feel you are about to
choke on disdain and despair. Turning those feelings into lucid
prose? Well, it's always tricky, especially if you pride yourself
overmuch on your good manners. In this case, the result was a
courteous and utterly useless silence.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A languid, sultry air mass will continue to stifle the Deep
South on Thursday. In the western Gulf States, scattered showers
and thunderstorms will develop across east Texas and southern
Louisiana in concert with the leading edge of the sea breeze moving
inland. With lethargic steering winds 18,000 feet aloft, storms
will move slowly, setting the stage for moderately heavy rains and
flash flooding in spots. Isolated waterspouts may accompany
thunderstorms over coastal waters.
</P>
<P>
   Farther east, sultry conditions with widely separated
thunderstorms will persist in the eastern Gulf and Southeast
States. Storms will be more active along the east coast of Florida
and the eastern Gulf Coast from Mississippi to the panhandle of
Florida, where the sea breeze acts as a catalyst to lift very humid
air. In the southern Appalachians, a few storms may approach severe
levels.
</P>
<P>
   Farther north, isolated thunderstorms will develop over the
Middle West, with the most active weather erupting just ahead of a
cool front approaching the western Great Lakes and upper
Mississippi Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Any vestiges from this week's hot spell in the Northeast will
fade Thursday as a south-southwestward moving cool front reaches
the Middle Atlantic States. A stripe of low clouds along and behind
the cool front will span from the northern Middle Atlantic Seaboard
to parts of the central Appalachians. Meanwhile, clouds will
crumble in northern and central New England as cool, dry air
filters south from a high pressure system over the Gulf of Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Raleigh Heat
</P>
<P>
   The temperature rose to 100 degrees in Raleigh, N.C., on Tuesday
for the earliest reading of 100 degrees since records began in
1944. It also marked the first time the temperature reached the
century mark since August 14, 1995, nearly four years ago.
Raleigh's average temperature from late June until mid-August is
nearly 90 degrees. It is surprising that for three consecutive
summers, the mercury never rose more than 10 degrees above normal.
The heat wave will persist Thursday, but cooler air from the
northeast should keep temperatures closer to 80 degrees Friday.

A CRITIC AT THE KEYBOARD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LIZ STEVENS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The piano recital took place on an autumn afternoon
in Seymour Bernstein's Upper West Side flat. It was the beginning
of a journey that would affect Michael Kimmelman profoundly.
</P>
<P>
   Kimmelman, chief art critic for The New York Times, had allowed
17 years to pass before reviving a serious interest in piano. He
had last played publicly during the 1981 Leschetizky Competition,
where he placed second, and had only lately returned to studying
with Bernstein, his childhood mentor.
</P>
<P>
   It was Bernstein who had encouraged his student to retest the
arena of performance, and now a dozen Times culture writers were
seated in Bernstein's living room, awaiting Kimmelman's musical
unveiling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sat to his left and turned the pages for him,'' recalls
Bernstein, ``and he went through a half-hour program like a veteran
pianist. He inspired himself and he inspired me, and the audience
was dumbstruck at the level of his playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Kimmelman, 41, performs in the first round of the Cliburn
International Piano Competition for Outstanding Amateurs. Piano is
once again an essential part of his life. It has given Kimmelman a
refuge outside his work and altered his worldview. It has changed
the rhythm of his days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having gone back to music has been one of the most joyous
things that's ever happened in my life,'' Kimmelman says, sitting
at his desk on the fourth floor of the Times building. ``It's not
just the enormous pleasure of making music, it's also a sense of
being able to express myself in a way that can't happen in any
other aspect of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Kimmelman's office is a glorified cubicle that he shares with
film critic Janet Maslin, though neither spends much time writing
here, he says. Stacks of art books cover his desk and shelves, but
otherwise there are no potential distractions _ no half-empty
coffee cups, no photographs of his 6-month-old son, Harry, whom he
wrote about in a recent essay for the Times magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing at the moment gives me more pleasure than sitting him
down in my lap at the piano, which he seems to like,'' says
Kimmelman, betraying a modicum of fatherly pride.
</P>
<P>
   Kimmelman's own lessons began when he was 5, in his family's
Greenwich Village apartment. His older half brother and his father
both had taken lessons from Bernstein, a close friend of the
family. Now it was Michael's turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked to play piano,'' Kimmelman says, ``and then I spent my
entire childhood not practicing.''
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning, he hardly needed to.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael was captivating and always brilliant,'' says
Bernstein, a composer and associate professor in the New York
University graduate piano program. ``From the moment he struck his
first note on the keyboard, he infused it with a deep emotional
intention.''
</P>
<P>
   As an undergraduate history major at Yale, Kimmelman struggled
with whether to pursue a career in music. He applied to the Mannes
College of Music but then turned down his acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be a pianist ... requires an enormous amount of narrow
concentration,'' he says. ``I felt my life as opening up at that
point, and I wasn't ready to narrow it down.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Leschetizky Competition, a national competition held
in New York City, Kimmelman turned away from piano and toward other
interests. He accepted a fellowship from Harvard and received a
master's degree in art history. He was pursuing a doctorate there
when the Atlanta Journal-Constitution offered him the job of music
critic.
</P>
<P>
   Kimmelman had written for publication before _ mainly for the
architecture and design magazine ID. And while he considered
himself a dedicated academic (he assumed he would teach for a
living), he found himself both increasingly frustrated by the
``self-absorbed'' nature of academics and drawn to the idea of
engaging a broader public in intellectual debate.
</P>
<P>
   Enter journalism. Kimmelman took the job in Atlanta in the
mid-'80s, and within a matter of months, the Philadelphia Inquirer
had spirited him back north. Two years later, in 1988, he joined
the Times.
</P>
<P>
   But he would find himself increasingly unsuited for music
criticism. As a critic, he sat through upward of seven concerts a
week and was required to focus on their practical aspects _ looking
at the business of music, comparing one performance with another.
As a musician, he found this distracting. When the Times offered
him the opportunity to switch to art criticism, he did.
</P>
<P>
   It was Bernstein who nudged Kimmelman back to piano, three years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like falling in love all over again,'' Kimmelman says.
It was ``a part of me that wasn't dead, it was just dormant. It was
a shock. I also found I could play better than I used to and with a
much deeper understanding of what I was doing.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago in May, Kimmelman performed a sold-out concert for
the Chopin Foundation in New York, a momentous occasion for him
both personally and musically. He bought the Steinway grand piano
that he played that day, and the foundation invited him to give a
second concert this past spring.
</P>
<P>
   Kimmelman's audience had grown to hundreds in the Polish
Consulate from a handful in Bernstein's apartment. But both
experiences fulfilled a similar desire: to share the music with
people he cares for.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that relates to this competition in a way,'' he says,
``because in the end, what is this about? It's about making music
for other people.''

 &HT;    Beau Rivage full of beauty, but hotel is still ironing out kinks
 &HT;    By Sandra Eckstein
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BILOXI, Miss. _ It really is as beautiful as Elizabeth Taylor
promised in those julep-accented TV ads.
</P>
<P>
   From the mosaic floors and soaring magnolias, thousands of
flowering blooms in the atrium, polished brass, exotic woodwork,
expensive fabrics, Spanish and Grecian marble and original artwork,
Beau Rivage, the newest Gulf Coast gambling resort is a visual
delight.
</P>
<P>
   It's also the grandest of the 13 Mississippi coast casinos. The
hotel boasts 1,780 rooms, 12 restaurants, a 31-slip marina, a
shopping promenade, a spa and salon, convention facilities, a large
concert hall and a permanent home for Cirque du Soleil with a
1,550-seat theater.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel and casino have been flooded with people since the
doors opened March 16. The resort aspires to five-star status, but
intense crowds and newly trained staff have caused some
difficulties, including long lines, dirty guest rooms and slow
service.
</P>
<P>
   Still, you can't deny the place looks great.
</P>
<P>
   The rooms are beautifully appointed with a huge bed covered with
a half-canopy. Tasteful hardwood furniture fills the space,
expensive draperies dress the windows and the large bathroom is
lined with marble. A double vanity sink, soaking tub and a large
separate shower room are luxurious. Little extra touches include
robes and slippers, a lighted magnifying mirror and built-in hair
dryer.
</P>
<P>
   But during our recent visit, the room's floors were not
vacuumed, gum was stuck on a bedroom tabletop and the beds were not
triple-sheeted, as promised in the resort's advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Bourland, the resort's director of public affairs,
acknowledges the hotel has had some initial problems. ``Every
property goes through these kinds of issues during their opening,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Beau Rivage's hasn't exactly been a quiet opening either: The
hotel has been sold out every weekend since the second week it
opened.
</P>
<P>
   Bourland said heavy turnover in the housekeeping and food
service staffs in the first two months has exacerbated the
situation. The promised triple-sheeting, a luxury required to get a
five-star rating and appreciated by guests concerned with health
issues, has been suspended while Beau Rivage works out laundry
problems, he said. But the hotel plans to resume the service soon.
</P>
<P>
   The $650 million resort is affiliated with the Mirage Resorts
chain, which includes Las Vegas' Bellagio and Mirage resorts.
Bourland said housekeeping experts from Mirage resorts are being
brought in to help with training.
</P>
<P>
   Checking in or out of the hotel can present a challenge on
weekends, often taking more than 30 minutes. It can take just as
long to get your car from valet parking. Restaurants, especially
the buffets, can have waits of more than an hour on Fridays and
Saturdays.
</P>
<P>
   Bourland said Beau Rivage has increased staffing at the check-in
counters and valet parking, and is working to stabilize the
resort's work force.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the better restaurants are booked several weeks in
advance, so visitors wanting a fancy meal are advised to make early
reservations. But it's worth the effort _ food at the resort is
exceptional. And with a dozen to pick from, there are restaurants
to fit most any taste or yen. For the gambler who wants to get back
to the tables, small delis, several just off the casino playing
floor, serve quick, large sandwiches. There is an ice cream shop,
coffee shop and a micro brewery featuring a fine selection of beers
and drinks.
</P>
<P>
   Want barbecue? Head to the Memphis Q. Asian cuisine? Try
Noodles. Japanese? Take Maku is for you. La Cucina serves Northern
Italian, Coral specializes in seafood and steaks and has the
coolest setting, with all four walls formed by giant aquariums.
</P>
<P>
   Atlantan Brad Hall, who said he has taken a few years off from
work to travel, was very impressed by Beau Rivage during visits in
March and April.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the nicest one down there,'' he said on a flight to
Biloxi. ``It compares to the casinos in Las Vegas. It's not as big,
but it's as beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   The hotel, of course, is there because of the casino, the reason
most people visit Biloxi. The casino has all the usual table games,
and the latest dizzying assortment of video games and slot
machines.
</P>
<P>
   But some guests have complained about the lack of no-smoking
areas on the gaming floor. Bourland said the casino is designating
no smoking areas, but that was too late for recent guests Pat and
John Hanes of Pensacola, Fla. The couple stayed at the hotel one
night, then switched to the Grand Casino, the area's largest and
most luxurious casino until Beau Rivage opened. Pat Hanes said she
preferred the no-smoking floor at the Grand. Both said they thought
the Beau Rivage casino was ``over-hyped.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty, but somewhat overpriced,'' John Hanes said.
</P>
<P>
   If guests tire of gaming, there are other diversions available
without leaving the site. The resort has an expansive spa facility,
with state-of-the-art exercise equipment and a large assortment of
services, from massages and manicures to hair colorings and herbal
body polishes. The separate men's and women's saunas, steam baths,
hot tubs and plunge pools are clothing optional.
</P>
<P>
   Guests can pay $12 daily and use the tubs, plunge pools,
exercise equipment, sauna and steam room, or the facilities are
free with any other paid spa or salon service.
</P>
<P>
   The resort also hosts Las Vegas-style shows, at Las Vegas-style
prices. Alabama tickets were about $54 each; Vince Gill tickets
$64. And just last month, Cirque du Soleil opened ``Alegria'' in a
permanent theater at the resort, playing eight shows a week.
Tickets are $42.80 for adults and $26.75 for children under 12
(ages 5 and younger aren't permitted).
</P>
<P>
   The hotel has a number of clothing, jewelry, and gift shops, but
unless you've hit the jackpot and have money to burn, the prices
may deter you.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the resort's facilities are geared to adults, so those
seeking a family weekend might want to consider other options.
While some of the area casinos have elaborate, free baby-sitting
services, Beau Rivage has none.
</P>
<P>
   There is no kiddie-pool at the beautifully landscaped swim area.
Parents must either hold young children, or let them play on the
steps leading into the pool. The arcade has few games to entertain
those younger than 10. Only one shop, a Warner Bros. Studio Store,
has items of interest to children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gambling is an adult activity and this is a resort,'' Bourland
said. ``And while we don't discourage people bringing children, we
consider our resort as more of a romantic getaway for couples, a
convention site for businesses, a destination for single travelers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is so much available on the Gulf Coast for families,''
he added. ``That's not necessarily what we do best.''

HEY, MRS. PETERSEN, I DIDN'T TURN OUT TO BE AN IDIOT

<P>
   PHOENIX - I was biting into the best tortilla of my life at my
favorite Mexican restaurant in Los Angeles when I saw her.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting at the next table behind my friend Jeff's head, there
she was. My eighth-grade math teacher. I couldn't mistake her still
jet-black hair, the soft curve of her almond-shaped eyes and her
thin, pursed lips.
</P>
<P>
   It was her, all right.
</P>
<P>
   I nudged my friend Jamie, who went to all the same schools I did
since third grade, and who was now sitting next to me enjoying her
very own heavenly tortilla.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's my eighth-grade math teacher!'' I said to her as she
lifted the buttery golden nearly transparent tortilla up for
another bite. ``Do you remember what her name was?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Was that the teacher that made you stand in front of the class
and add fractions until you cried?'' she asked for the benefit of
Jeff and Kristin, our newly betrothed friends who were sitting on
the other side of the table, since we didn't meet Jeff until high
school.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the one,'' I confirmed. ``She's also the one that gave
me detention for asking why we couldn't just `round up.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``You got in more trouble then than when you stole all of those
``Little House on the Prairie'' books from the library, and the
librarian caught you with ``On the Banks of Plum Creek'' stuffed
down your pants,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   ``They weren't pants, they were Sassoon gauchos,'' I stressed.
``And I (begin ital) had (end ital) to steal them. I didn't have
enough baby-sitting money to pay for the late fines on that Joanie
and Chachi book that I found stuffed in my little sister's EZ Bake
oven two years later.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Her name is on the tip of my tongue,'' Jamie finally
remembered. ``Her husband was my biology teacher in ninth grade . .
. Mrs. Petersen!''
</P>
<P>
   ``MRS. PETERSEN!'' I nearly shouted.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that's him right there!'' Jamie pointed out excitedly.
``Mr. Petersen is sitting right next to her!''
</P>
<P>
   ``You guys should say `Hi,' '' Kristin said. ``I'm sure they
would like to see you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' I said, shaking my head. ``I wasn't the best
student . . . ''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know,'' Jeff ventured. ``Maybe you can impress her and
completely validate her career as a teacher if you show her you can
figure out how to leave a tip!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why didn't you guys both have her for math?'' Kristin
innocently asked.
</P>
<P>
   I looked away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, you see,'' Jamie started to explain, ``in junior high, I
was in a special group for math and science.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you mean, `special group?' '' Jeff practically yelled.
``Do you mean . . . you were in the Dumb Group in math?''
</P>
<P>
   I turned my eyes back to Jeff. ``It's NOT called the Dumb Group,
Jeff!'' I hissed. ``It's called Essential Math Skills and it's
nothing to be ashamed of. Some people have more creative skills
than technical skills. Some people want to smell the flower instead
of counting its petals! Some people are just circles being hammered
relentlessly into a square peg slot! Some people just want to ROUND
UP!!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in advanced placement math,'' Jamie finished.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I . . . '' I said quietly. ``was in Slow Math.''
</P>
<P>
   The silent pause at the table was timeless and dreadful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somehow,'' Jeff finally stammered, ``I now see you
differently. Do you . . . get checks from the government? Are you
even allowed to be married? How did you get a driver's license?''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you fill in `C' for every answer, you're bound to get some
right,'' I snapped.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still think you should say `Hi' to them,'' Kristin repeated.
``Won't Mr. Petersen be thrilled that Jamie is now a microbiologist
with her own cancer research lab! And Laurie, you didn't need math
after all to write those little things in the paper! See? You
should say `Hi!' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``I still don't know,'' I hesitated, shaking my head.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come on,'' Jamie nudged me. ``I will if you will!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, all right,'' I said, giving in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a microscope and an autoclave in the car,'' Jamie said,
jumping up from the booth. ``Should I bring it in?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any of . . . my little things,'' I protested.
``That's hardly fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, we took the two steps necessary to reach the Petersens'
table, where Mrs. Petersen had her lips stretched wide to
accommodate a rather thick taco. Mr. Petersen, on the other hand,
was armed with a fork and knife and was preparing to attack his
chimichanga.
</P>
<P>
   ``Excuse me,'' Jamie said as she leaned over slightly.
</P>
<P>
   The Petersens suddenly froze in time as they looked up at us.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Laurie!'' I said as I waved at Mrs. Petersen. ``Remember
me? ROUND UP!''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Petersen's eyes grew wide, her mouth was still open, though
slightly more circular, as to accommodate an element of complete
horror.
</P>
<P>
   ``LAURIE NOTARO!'' I emphasized, sensing that she could not
place me. ``From Retard Math! I write stuff for the paper now!''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Jamie,'' I heard my advanced placement friend say.
``Remember when we cut open that cow's eye and Mike Purcell ate the
retina on a bet and you made him throw up in the sink?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Want me to figure out how much you need for a tip?'' I said to
Mrs. Petersen. ``Cause I can!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have slides and a microscope in the car but she wouldn't let
me bring it in,'' Jamie said, and adding in a whisper, ``she was in
Retard Math.''
</P>
<P>
   The Petersens remained silent, saying absolutely nothing as they
just sat and stared at us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Um,'' Jamie finally said. ``Are you . . . the Petersens?''
</P>
<P>
   The two of them slowly, and in a synchronized movement, shook
their heads.
</P>
<P>
   The Phony Mrs. Petersen pointed at me. ``You have refried beans
on your cheek'' she said, still holding her taco with her other
hand.
</P>
<P>
   We took the two steps back to our table as the Phony Petersens
continued to gawk at us.
</P>
<P>
   ``You won't believe this,'' Jeff said as we slid back into the
booth, ``but your high school English teacher is sitting right over
there!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mrs. Gaio?'' I said as Jamie and I both turned around to look.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's her all right,'' Jamie said. &QL;

 &HT;    Decisions, decisions: Renovation of own home presents tough
choices for pro
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Don't try this at home.
</P>
<P>
   That seems like odd advice coming from a remodeling pro. But
after renovating his 1930s Decatur (Ga.) home, Craig Kennedy admits
the job is no model for his clients. Although he and his wife,
Lisa, were pleased with the outcome, some decisions made along the
way proved inefficient and costly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did things the hard way,'' said Kennedy, a partner in
HammerSmith, an Atlanta design/build firm. ``Like most homeowners,
we had no idea what we were getting into. Once you move in, it's
hard to renovate.''
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, kitchens and baths, typically the most expensive _ and
disruptive _ remodeling projects, should be done while the house is
vacant. But like many young home buyers, the Kennedys couldn't
afford to do everything they wanted when they bought their Glendale
Estates home six years ago. So they tackled a variety of projects,
including the kitchen, in phases.
</P>
<P>
   That meant the renovation, like their tastes, continued to
evolve. Driving some of the changes were two family members _
Davis, 3, and Henry, 4 months _ who were born since they launched
the project.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other homeowners, the Kennedys didn't fall victim to the
typical remodeling pitfalls _ hiring a contractor without first
checking references, putting down too much money up front, failing
to put all terms in writing. But when the homeowner is in the
business, the process can be frustrating in other ways, Craig said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough remodeling for yourself. I'm exposed to so much
stuff every day in my work. I see it, and I want it,'' he said.
``So we had to make some tough decisions that I usually have to ask
my clients to do.''
</P>
<P>
   They started by making just enough improvements to make their
home attractive and functional.
</P>
<P>
   The 1937 house had some structural problems _ the attic sagged
about 4 inches, some structural sills were rotten _ that required
repairs. While the three bathrooms had never been updated, the
Kennedys chose to only ``jazz them up a little'' for now, he said,
painting the walls in decorative finishes.
</P>
<P>
   In a second phase, they replaced the siding, selecting vinyl the
same size as wood to make the exterior appear old, replaced the
windows and refinished the hardwood floors.
</P>
<P>
   Next, the Kennedys tackled finished attic space, where they
created a den and office. Vinyl floors, jalousie windows and
fluorescent lights were traded for wall-to-wall carpet, new windows
and track lights. They also opened the office space by vaulting the
ceiling and adding skylights.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the back yard, building terraces and retaining walls
to correct drainage.
</P>
<P>
   And finally there was that kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Kitchen of their dreams
</P>
<P>
   Craig wanted the kitchen to contain everything, from a fireplace
and breakfast area to appliances with the latest bells and
whistles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the remodeler's curse,'' said Lisa, an attorney turned
full-time mom.
</P>
<P>
   But finances required the couple to approach the room in phases
_ a process they don't regret because it gave them time to get to
know the space and determine their needs.
</P>
<P>
   They began by replacing its laminate countertops with granite
and installing a new sink. Open, stainless steel restaurant-style
shelves were added as temporary storage, but they wound up liking
them so much they kept them instead of hanging new wall cabinets.
``We really fought the traditional kitchen so we went without
them,'' Craig said.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the floors, ceiling and walls, all inspired by
kitchens in Tuscany where the Kennedys once vacationed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest response we get is to the floor. When we moved in
we had no kids, just dogs, so we've since made it child proof,''
Lisa said of the Italian ceramic tile in three sizes and a combo of
colors, including rust, mauve, tan and gray, that hides dirt.
</P>
<P>
   The Kennedys opened up more of the attic to create a cathedral
ceiling with Tuscan-style cedar trusses, where track lighting was
installed to supplement canned fixtures.
</P>
<P>
   Then the dangers of not having a master plan for the room began
to unravel.
</P>
<P>
   Dream or nightmare?
</P>
<P>
   New windows had been installed on each side of the stove, but
one later had to be removed when the couple decided to purchase a
48-inch wide Sub Zero refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then we decided the walls were the problem,'' Craig said.
</P>
<P>
   So they added old-style ceramic tile in a running-bond pattern
half way up the walls. Above, they applied an old plaster finish,
made of plaster of Paris, latex paint and tinted wax, to the
Sheetrock.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of surfaces here,'' Craig said, ``but when you
spend a lot of time in the kitchen, things like that and proper
lighting really matter.''
</P>
<P>
   And spending time there proved something else: The Kennedys
wanted an eat-in kitchen, but a table and chairs made the new
kitchen crowded. Craig's parents suggested they convert the
adjacent dining room into a breakfast room and open it to the
kitchen by removing a wall. In place of the table, an island with
roll-out shelves gave them much-needed counter space.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, lack of planning, along with special features such
as roll-out windows with no center bar, a custom-designed range
hood and a child-proof dishwasher, made the $100,000 kitchen
project far more expensive than planned.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if you manage a project, you can get good results,'' Craig
said. ``We did it all in phases so that spread it all out.''
</P>
<P>
   The hard-learned lessons haven't cooled the Kennedys' remodeling
fever; they next plan to expand their bedroom to make a master
suite.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're getting close to being done,'' he said. ``We've
created a lifestyle out of renovation, so when we're done, does
that mean we move for a new lifestyle?''
</P>
<P>
   The couple don't think so. ``We like this house,'' Craig said.
``It isn't perfect . . . ''
</P>
<P>
   But what old house is?
</P>
<P>
   B E F O R E Y O U R E M O D E L
</P>
<P>
   Remodeling can be frustrating enough with the barrage of
decisions and constant disruption that accompany a project. But
those challenges pale in comparison with being victimized by
unreliable contractors and shoddy workmanship.
</P>
<P>
   Before launching a renovation project, be sure to:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Check with real estate agents for property values in your
neighborhood before deciding how much you should invest.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Develop a realistic budget. Add at least 10 percent because
most remodels run over either from inaccurate budget forecasting or
from additions to the original plan.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Ask friends for references on contractors they have used and
inspect their work.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Interview several contractors who are licensed and have
Workers' Compensation and general liability insurance. Ask to see
licenses and insurance certificates as proof. All general estimates
for the work should be free.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Ask contractors how long their companies have been in business
(It typically takes at least five years to establish a financially
sound business).
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Check court records to determine whether the contractor has
been sued.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Make sure you can communicate well with the contractor because
misunderstanding can lead to cost overruns and delays.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Insist on a written contract once you hire a contractor that
indicates the estimated start and completion dates and descriptions
of the work, materials and prices.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Check to see if the contract includes a warranty covering
workmanship and materials.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Ask for working drawings to ensure your ideas have been
properly translated.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Make sure no work is done until the contractor purchases the
necessary building permits.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Don't pay cash for work and don't pay more than one-third of
the cost in advance, one-third midway into the project and the
balance upon completion.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Don't sign a completion certificate for the job before it has
been inspected and properly completed.

CHINA SUSPENDS SOME CULTURAL EXCHANGES, CITING NATO ATTACK
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Kan., Mass., Pa.)  (Eds: Also moving in `i' category.) 
(rk) 
 By RALPH BLUMENTHAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   After years of negotiations with Chinese cultural
representatives, the American Ballet Theater was close to a deal
last month to piggyback five performances in Beijing onto a July
tour of Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Then came NATO's errant bombing of the Chinese Embassy in
Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the Beijing visit was off _ ``shelved at this
sensitive stage'' by China's Ministry of Culture, a Chinese arts
representative, Chen Jixin, informed the ballet company, blaming
the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   At least three other major American-Chinese cultural exchanges,
involving the Boston Symphony Orchestra, Lincoln Center Jazz
Orchestra, and the New York Choral Society, were also put off by
the Chinese after the May 7 attack, which killed three Chinese
citizens.
</P>
<P>
   In communications with some of the groups, Chinese officials
linked the broken plans to widespread outrage over the embassy
bombing, which NATO officials called a mistake made because of an
outdated maps.
</P>
<P>
   Arts managers say it could take years to reschedule the
disrupted performances.
</P>
<P>
   Yu Shuning, a spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in Washington,
said, ``After the bombing the whole Chinese population was
extremely sad so it was not appropriate to listen to music.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that China had demanded an investigation into the
bombing and that once the issue was settled ``the atmosphere will
improve and things will go back on track.''
</P>
<P>
   But he and other Chinese officials said cultural exchanges would
be preserved.
</P>
<P>
   ``The events weren't canceled but postponed by mutual consent,''
said Gao Qi of the China Performing Arts Agency's Culture and
Entertainment Co. under the Ministry of Culture in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   With the Boston Symphony scheduled to arrive May 12, days after
the bombing, he said in a telephone interview, ``Beijing citizens
were infuriated and the environment was not friendly.'' The
orchestra was also worried about its security, he said. In the end,
he said, ``we decided to postpone the performance'' although both
sides were talking about rescheduling.
</P>
<P>
   At the National Culture and Art Corp., which is now semiprivate
but retains some government ties, another Chinese official, Zhang
Hang, said the bombing was at least partly to blame for what he
called the ``temporarily postponed'' performances of American
Ballet Theater and the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   But he said that financial concerns had also played a part. He
said no other American groups were scheduled to visit China in
coming months but that a violinist from Germany, which is also a
member of NATO, had just played a successful concert without
incident in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Yu said that officials were not aware of any canceled visits by
Chinese groups and that apart from the ``bad atmosphere'' from the
bombing, ``we did not stop cultural exchanges.''
</P>
<P>
   With the proliferation of private cultural contacts between
China and the United States, Chinese and State Department officials
said, there is no master list of bilateral exchanges and therefore
no way to say how many arrangements have been disrupted.
</P>
<P>
   One major Chinese-American artistic landmark that stirred
controversy last year _ a production of the 16th-century classic
opera ``The Peony Pavilion'' _ is not affected by the political
tensions.
</P>
<P>
   Shanghai officials had blocked the production from coming to the
Lincoln Center Festival last year, but a new 20-hour production
with two Chinese stars who have been in the United States for some
time will proceed as scheduled next month, festival officials said.
</P>
<P>
   While the de-invitations to the Americans were generally phrased
politely and presented as postponements rather than cancellations,
the crowded booking calendars of leading ensembles means that the
trips cannot be reconstituted easily.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like to try it again in 2001,'' said John Lawson,
executive director of the New York Choral Society. The society, an
avocational chorus, had spent more than a year assembling 230
singers from New York, Philadelphia and Kansas City to join 310
Chinese vocalists and instrumentalists for a mammoth performance of
Mahler's 8th Symphony in Shanghai on July 30, to be followed by a
recital of Brahms' ``German Requiem'' in Beijing on Aug. 7.
</P>
<P>
   On June 3, Lawson received a letter from the society's Chinese
host, the Shanghai Acting Co., saying that the joint performance
``cannot be carried on now because we have not received the
approval from the relevant administration till now'' and delicately
suggesting a postponement. The singers were able to turn in their
$2,300 airline tickets but lost about about $100 each in
nonrefundable outlays.
</P>
<P>
   Yu, the Chinese Embassy spokesman, said that while certain
bilateral contacts on military affairs, disarmament, security and
human rights were officially suspended in protest over the bombing,
no break in cultural relations was announced.
</P>
<P>
   A State Department official, who spoke only on the condition of
anonymity, agreed that cultural relations did not appear in
jeopardy and that American Fulbright scholars, for example, were
still being welcomed by China. But he said that many of today's
arts exchanges were on a private basis outside the purview of the
American government.
</P>
<P>
   Claudette Donlon, general manager of the American Ballet
Theater, said the company was wrapping up a contract for a visit
``literally years in the works,'' when the bombing took place. The
company of about 125 was booked for 12 performances in and around
Tokyo in early July and had arranged to go on to China afterward
for at least five performances, some in the Great Hall of the
People.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  That all came to an end on May 11 with a fax from the China
National Culture and Art Corp. whose representative, Chen, told Ms.
Donlon that due to the ``Chinese tragic experience in Yugoslavia,''
American cultural programs were being shelved by the Culture
Ministry. However, he held out hope for another booking, including
possibly a separate tour of China by next February.
</P>
<P>
   Jane Herman, a manager at ICM Artists in Manhattan who often
works with American Ballet Theater, said that after the canceled
date, the Chinese had inquired about booking a smaller ballet
production at no fee, suggesting that financial concerns played
some part in the withdrawn invitation.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Herman said that two other of her projects involving the
Chinese were in some doubt in the wake of the bombing, a
cooperative venture between American Ballet Theater and the
National Ballet of China, and a plan for another Chinese dance
company, which she declined to name, to come to the United States
in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra, with Wynton Marsalis, had
been scheduled to perform from July 13-20 in Shanghai, Guangzhou
and Beijing, but said it had agreed to suspend the tour.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Symphony suffered perhaps the most precipitous
cancellation. Last in China 20 years ago, the orchestra and its
conductor, Seiji Ozawa _ who was born in China but is Japanese _
were in Tokyo and planning to move on to Beijing when the Belgrade
bombing set off street protests and rock throwing at the American
Embassy in the Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Volpe, the orchestra's managing director, said he spent
hours trying to contact American officials and finally concluded
the visit was too risky and had to be canceled.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would have arrived just as the ashes of the victims were
coming home,'' he said. Ozawa did travel to China alone to teach
some master classes and conduct a student orchestra and was well
received.
</P>
<P>
   But Zhang Yu, general director of the China Performing Arts
Agency, faxed a letter to the orchestra on May 9 saying: ``This
barbarous atrocity of NATO has invoked the utmost indignation of
the Chinese government and people. As such, we believe the
favorable atmosphere for this China tour at the moment is no longer
there, and no longer is it appropriate for the tour to be conducted
as originally scheduled.''

 &HT;    Our flowers furnish more than furniture ever could
 &HT;    By Lee May
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   From time to time Lyn and I get into those . . . let's call them
discussions about which is more demanding, house or garden. Which
calls for more work. You can guess which side I'm on.
</P>
<P>
   She Who Does Not Garden But Appreciates (and that's the way I
like it; I've always believed in one gardener to a garden) talks
about what a long, hard job it is, towing a vacuum cleaner from
room to room, floor to floor. I point out that it's no picnic
dragging a big old Japanese maple from site to site, trying to find
a home for it in 90-degree temperatures. Well, mopping floors all
through the house wears you out, she retorts. Yeah, and so does
wetting the ground all around a parched garden.
</P>
<P>
   And so it has gone for years, as we debate the merits of taking
care of our respective domains. (She does not garden, but she's
starting to get opinions: ``You pruned one limb too many off that
dogwood.'')
</P>
<P>
   The other day, however, we broke new ground, focusing not on the
work required to keep a house or garden going but on the emotional
value of what's in the house and garden _ furniture vs. flowers. We
achieved rapprochement.
</P>
<P>
   This is the kind of conversation you have when you're taking
stock of what you have, or when you're thinking of what you'd face
_ physically and psychologically _ if you moved, or when you're
just trying to get rid of stuff, lighten your load.
</P>
<P>
   Our conversation, part practical, part philosophical, was
launched as we dove into a weekend effort to pare down closets,
clear pathways through mountains of office papers.
</P>
<P>
   What about this blue sofa in the parlor, I said. We've had it
since Washington. Would we keep it?
</P>
<P>
   ``It could go,'' answered Lyn. ``I have no emotional attachment
to it.''
</P>
<P>
   The same went for television sets, of course, and all other
electronic pieces. The kitchen table, various chairs. Most of
what's in the house was expendable, leavable, in our hypothetical
conversation. There were, of course, exceptions _ recorded music,
books and pictures, which are in a category of their own; you just
have to keep them. And the big dining room table of solid oak,
along with a 100-year-old wooden chest and a tall painted bookcase.
</P>
<P>
   A common thread that wove through our short list of keepers was
uniqueness. Unlike most of our furnishings, these things cannot be
replaced. And even if they are not the only pieces of their kind,
they feel like it.
</P>
<P>
   In the garden, there is no doubt; each plant is one of a kind in
ways that furniture cannot be.
</P>
<P>
   Each plant has a story, a history. Most important, they, like
people, grow.
</P>
<P>
   Some are passed from one friend or relative to another. As do
all gardeners, I look at my plants and see connections.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the English oak sent through the mail by old friends from
Massachusetts a few years ago. It was bare-root, wrapped in
newspaper, a spindly little thing. Now, it grows stronger each
year, as do the memories of good times with good friends.
</P>
<P>
   There's the black bamboo, shared from a hugely graceful mother
plant one autumn nearly a decade back. One cane and a few rhizomes
is how it began. Now, there are enough canes to form a fine clump;
they multiply like the conversations and meals we've shared with
the bamboo sharers.
</P>
<P>
   Many plants came from nurseries, which my car refused to pass
during jaunts around the region. Some were just babies when I
hauled them to the garden, dug holes for them, pampered them,
watched them grow and change. The little twice-blooming cherry tree
that was just a short stick several years ago now stares into my
second-story office window. The 2-foot-high native azalea I bought
during a visit to Fairhope, Ala., has doubled its height and its
sweet floral output. A sparse patchwork of dwarf mondo planted
about five years ago has, little by little, woven into a quilt of
green in a space out back.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike furniture, plants need to see us often _ though,
admittedly, not as often as we need to see them. There is a
distinct and necessary interaction between plants and people that
can never exist between furniture and people. Even if those people
are artists or master crafters. Gardeners birth, nurture, feed,
shelter.
</P>
<P>
   Lyn agreed. As she put it: ``I didn't grow that couch.''
</P>
<P>
   So furniture vs. flowers is an easy call. Can we settle the
debate centering on house chores vs. garden chores? Not without a
lot of work.

 &HT;    Zoos' news: Exotic animal exhibits blossom
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, June13
 &HT;    By Doug Hamilton
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Want to get really ``wild'' this summer? We're not talking about
beer blasts on the beach or skinny-dipping by the light of the
August moon. We're talking about locking eyes with a 400-pound
gorilla, watching hippopotamuses paddle daintily (yes, daintily)
around a tropical lagoon and trading growls with a ferocious tiger
or two.
</P>
<P>
   These and other exotic beasts can be found in new zoo exhibits
across the country. Several zoological parks and aquariums are
beefing up their facilities in anticipation of the busy summer
season:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The San Diego Zoo recently unveiled its $4.4 million Ituri
Forest exhibit, a two-acre habitat modeled after Africa's Congo
River Basin. Visitors not only get an underwater view of those
surprisingly graceful hippos, but they can commune with forest
buffaloes, spotted-necked otters and great blue turacos.
(Information: 619-234-3153 or www.sandiegozoo.org.)
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The Philadelphia Zoo opens its 2.5-acre, $24 million Primate
Reserve on July 1. Built to resemble an abandoned timber mill, the
reserve will house 11 species of primates, including western
lowland gorillas and Sumatran orangutans. There are also lemur,
marmoset and tamarin exhibits, with no barriers between animal and
man. (215-243-1100 or www.philadelphiazoo.org.)
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Closer to Atlanta, the Jacksonville Zoological Gardens plans
to open a new animal hospital in August. The $1.5 million facility
comes equipped with a viewing window where visitors can watch
medical staff treat the animals. There are also plans to expand the
primate compound by early August. (904-757-4463 or www.jaxzoo.org.)
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Some big cats have new digs in Texas. The Dallas Zoo recently
unveiled its $4.5 million Exxon Endangered Tiger Habitat. The
one-acre rain forest habitat is home to Sasha and Paul, two rare
Sumatran tigers. (214-670-5656 or www.dallas-zoo.org.)
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Many of our finned and flippered friends have found a home
near Cincinnati. The just-opened Newport Aquarium in Newport, Ky.,
boasts more than 11,000 aquatic residents. And its innovative
Surrounded by Sharks tunnel gives visitors a 360-degree view of
tiger, lemon, nurse and other sharks. (606-261-7444 or

YUGOSLAV TROOPS WILL RETURN TO KOSOVO FOR MINE-CLEARING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The land mine threat in Kosovo is so serious that
NATO wants hundreds of Yugoslav troops to return to the province to
help remove minefields, Pentagon officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Under the peace agreement signed by NATO and Yugolsav forces,
Yugoslav military units are required to remove as many mines as
possible as they withdraw from the province and provide NATO with
maps detailing the locations of minefields.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will certainly be responsible for identifying mine fields
and clearing them to the extent possible,'' Walter Slocombe, the
Pentagon's under secretary of defense for policy, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   After the Yugoslav withdrawal, NATO and Yugolsav commanders will
meet to decide ``how a relatively small number _ hundreds not
thousands'' of Yugoslav troops would return to Kosovo to clear more
mines, as required by the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is yet to come,'' Slocombe added.
</P>
<P>
   The 50,000 NATO troops entering Kosovo and the returning
refugees will face an unknown quantity of minefields and explosive
booby-traps planted by Yugoslav troops. There is no accurate tally
of how many land mines are scattered throughout Kosovo but some
estimates run to the tens of thousands. Conducting a ``mine
census'' will be one of the first missions for NATO forces.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon spokesman Ken Bacon said Wednesday that there were
reports that Yugoslav forces were still laying mines this week.
``We'll have to be very careful in the early days about making sure
that the routes are well cleared,'' Bacon added.
</P>
<P>
   Citing reports from ethnic Albanian refugees, the office of the
U.N. High Commission for Refugees said recently that Yugoslav
forces have placed land mines in ``an indeterminate number of
locations'' within Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The organization said land mines were ``certainly'' planted
along Kosovo's borders with Albania and Macedonia, the major routes
for returning refugees and the NATO forces that will protect them.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. office added that in order to safely return some 1.6
million ethnic Albanian Kosovars to their homes, ``land mines must
be cleared.''
</P>
<P>
   The terms of the peace deal require Yugoslavia to provide NATO
with maps detailing the locations of minefields. However, many were
laid in the heat of battle between Yugoslav forces and the Kosovo
Liberation Army, and Pentagon officials fear that there aren't
definitive maps for these.
</P>
<P>
   That's why among the first U.S. forces to enter Kosovo will be
U.S. Marines equipped with mine-clearing equipment, including large
armored land movers to bulldoze a pathway for refugees and troops.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE -- OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A contingent of about 1,900 U.S. Marines and 1,700 Army troops
will be the first wave of U.S. forces sent to Kosovo. President
Clinton has promised a force of 7,000 U.S. Army peackeepers. Of the
NATO allies, the United Kingdom is supplying the largest force _
12,000 troops.
</P>
<P>
   Under the peace plan, Kosovo would be carved up into five
sectors. The United Kingdom will be responsible for the largest
sector, about 50 percent of Kosovo, including the capital of
Pristina, while the United States, France, Italy and Germany will
control equal segments of the remaining half.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. section will be along the Macedonian and Serbian
borders.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo is a province of Serbia, which is the dominant republic
in Yugoslavia. NATO bombing over the last 11 weeks was intended to
halt ethnic killings and removals by Serb troops against the ethnic
Albanian population of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Minefields were a major impediment for returning refugees in
Bosnia where only 50,000 mines out of an estimated 1 million have
been unearthed and deactivated in the last three years. Some
estimates indicate that it will take another 20 years to rid Bosnia
of land mines set during the 1992-95 civil war among Serbs, Croats
and Muslims.

   As if Las Vegas isn't synthetic enough, famed London wax museum
Madame Tussaud's is opening a branch in the Nevada gambling mecca
in mid-July. Sculptures of such disparate celebs as Babe Ruth,
Bruce Springsteen, Oprah Winfrey and Cybill Shepherd (?) will greet
visitors with fixed smiles in themed sections.
</P>
<P>
   Witness a fantasy fight between Muhammad Ali and Evander
Holyfield in the ``Sports Arena'' section, then bop on over to
``The Big Night'' for a Hollywood soiree with Whoopi Goldberg and
Arnold Schwarzenegger. (How can you tell the Schwarzenegger figure
is fake? It's more expressive than the real thing.) The ``Finale''
is a multimedia tribute to Las Vegas legends such as Tony Bennett,
Tom Jones (at left) and, of course, Siegfried and Roy.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Information: The museum, located in the Venetian Resort Hotel

   FOREIGN FESTS
</P>
<P>
   If you think the Edinburgh International Festival is about
haggis and caber tossing, think again. The Scottish capital's
annual highland fling, which this year runs Aug. 15-Sept. 4 , is
classy and then some.
</P>
<P>
   The 167 performances range from classic ballets to contemporary
Chinese opera to experimental theater. Highlights include a concert

including African percussion ensembles, French and Canadian pop
groups, folksingers and jazz combos. There will also be street
performers, circus acts and lots of international cuisine.
</P>
<P>
   A partial list of performers, including folkie cult faves Kate
and Anna McGarrigle, is available on the festival's Web site,
www.infofestival.com. More acts should be added in coming days.
Past festival lineups have included superstars such as Celine Dion

   Even world-renowned British orchestras need a little sun and fun
every once in a while. That's one reason why the London Symphony
Orchestra has made Daytona Beach, Fla., its ``official American
summer home'' since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Every July, the esteemed ensemble ventures to the coastal
Florida playground. This year's series of concerts, held at the
Peabody Auditorium and the Ocean Center in Daytona Beach from July
31 through Aug. 7, range from classic Beethoven and Mozart to light
orchestral pop. For the Aug. 7 series finale, Cincinnati Pops
conductor Erich Kunzel teams up with the LSO for a salute to
Hollywood. The program includes music from ``Star Wars: Episode 1 _
The Phantom Menace'' and ``Titanic.''
</P>
<P>
   The concerts are part of the 1999 Florida International
Festival, which also features performances by cabaret singer and
former ``Designing Women'' star Dixie Carter, saucy Cajun combo
Beausoleil and the Martha Graham Dance Ensemble.

   For the third year, the majestic Biltmore Estate in Asheville,
N.C., is the site of the diverse Summer Evenings concert series. As
the sun drops behind the surrounding mountains, music fans will
gather at the estate's south terrace to hear famous names from the
worlds of jazz, pop and swing.
</P>
<P>
   On July 31, the Washington Symphony Orchestra kicks off the
series with ``Voices of Freedom,'' a concert of patriotic music
capped off by a fireworks display. Fluegelhorn player Chuck
Mangione plays his hit ``Feels So Good'' and other contemporary
jazz tunes on Aug. 7. Carolina country-bluegrass great Doc Watson

   Stamina is the key to enjoying Lincoln Center Festival 99, a
daunting 2 1/2-week extravaganza of theater, dance and musical
performances at New York's premier cultural venue. This year the
festival, which runs July 7-25, hosts two marathon events: a
production of the 20-hour Chinese opera ``Peony Pavilion,'' staged
by Chen Shi-Zheng, and ``House Full o' Praise,'' a nine-concert
overview of African-American gospel music.
</P>
<P>
   Other lengthy presentations include a four-part tribute to
minimalist composer Steve Reich, and the New York Philharmonic
performing the complete Beethoven piano concerti, with pianist
Emanuel Ax. The Philharmonic will also perform the U.S. premiere of
``In Memory of Yitzhak,'' a choral and symphonic work dedicated to
assassinated Israeli leader Yitzhak Rabin.
</P>
<P>
   Should one remain unquenched after this cultural deluge, there's
the airborne ballet of Kayassine, a French trapeze troupe, and the

   When Parisian impressionist painter Edgar Degas visited New
Orleans in 1872, he fell under the spell of the lazy, hazy
Louisiana city. He felt so comfortable that he painted 24 works
during his six-month stay, including ``A Cotton Office in New
Orleans.'' That great work is the centerpiece of the New Orleans
Museum of Art's current exhibition ``Degas and New Orleans: A
French Impressionist in America.''
</P>
<P>
   Coinciding with FrancoFete, Louisiana's statewide celebration of
300 years of French influence, the exhibit features 16 other works
painted by Degas during his stateside sojourn. Photographs, jewelry
and drawings relating to the painter's American family (his mother
was born in New Orleans) also are included.
</P>

CHINA SUSPENDS SOME CULTURAL EXCHANGES, CITING NATO ATTACK
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   After years of negotiations with Chinese cultural
representatives, the American Ballet Theater was close to a deal
last month to piggyback five performances in Beijing onto a July
tour of Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Then came NATO's errant bombing of the Chinese Embassy in
Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the Beijing visit was off _ ``shelved at this
sensitive stage'' by China's Ministry of Culture, a Chinese arts
representative, Chen Jixin, informed the ballet company, blaming
the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   At least three other major American-Chinese cultural exchanges,
involving the Boston Symphony Orchestra, Lincoln Center Jazz
Orchestra, and the New York Choral Society, were also put off by
the Chinese after the May 7 attack, which killed three Chinese
citizens.
</P>
<P>
   In communications with some of the groups, Chinese officials
linked the broken plans to widespread outrage over the embassy
bombing, which NATO officials called a mistake made because of an
outdated maps.
</P>
<P>
   Arts managers say it could take years to reschedule the
disrupted performances.
</P>
<P>
   Yu Shuning, a spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in Washington,
said, ``After the bombing the whole Chinese population was
extremely sad so it was not appropriate to listen to music.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that China had demanded an investigation into the
bombing and that once the issue was settled ``the atmosphere will
improve and things will go back on track.''
</P>
<P>
   But he and other Chinese officials said cultural exchanges would
be preserved.
</P>
<P>
   ``The events weren't canceled but postponed by mutual consent,''
said Gao Qi of the China Performing Arts Agency's Culture and
Entertainment Co. under the Ministry of Culture in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   With the Boston Symphony scheduled to arrive May 12, days after
the bombing, he said in a telephone interview, ``Beijing citizens
were infuriated and the environment was not friendly.'' The
orchestra was also worried about its security, he said. In the end,
he said, ``we decided to postpone the performance'' although both
sides were talking about rescheduling.
</P>
<P>
   At the National Culture and Art Corp., which is now semiprivate
but retains some government ties, another Chinese official, Zhang
Hang, said the bombing was at least partly to blame for what he
called the ``temporarily postponed'' performances of American
Ballet Theater and the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   But he said that financial concerns had also played a part. He
said no other American groups were scheduled to visit China in
coming months but that a violinist from Germany, which is also a
member of NATO, had just played a successful concert without
incident in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Yu said that officials were not aware of any canceled visits by
Chinese groups and that apart from the ``bad atmosphere'' from the
bombing, ``we did not stop cultural exchanges.''
</P>
<P>
   With the proliferation of private cultural contacts between
China and the United States, Chinese and State Department officials
said, there is no master list of bilateral exchanges and therefore
no way to say how many arrangements have been disrupted.
</P>
<P>
   One major Chinese-American artistic landmark that stirred
controversy last year _ a production of the 16th-century classic
opera ``The Peony Pavilion'' _ is not affected by the political
tensions.
</P>
<P>
   Shanghai officials had blocked the production from coming to the
Lincoln Center Festival last year, but a new 20-hour production
with two Chinese stars who have been in the United States for some
time will proceed as scheduled next month, festival officials said.
</P>
<P>
   While the de-invitations to the Americans were generally phrased
politely and presented as postponements rather than cancellations,
the crowded booking calendars of leading ensembles means that the
trips cannot be reconstituted easily.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like to try it again in 2001,'' said John Lawson,
executive director of the New York Choral Society. The society, an
avocational chorus, had spent more than a year assembling 230
singers from New York, Philadelphia and Kansas City to join 310
Chinese vocalists and instrumentalists for a mammoth performance of
Mahler's 8th Symphony in Shanghai on July 30, to be followed by a
recital of Brahms' ``German Requiem'' in Beijing on Aug. 7.
</P>
<P>
   On June 3, Lawson received a letter from the society's Chinese
host, the Shanghai Acting Co., saying that the joint performance
``cannot be carried on now because we have not received the
approval from the relevant administration till now'' and delicately
suggesting a postponement. The singers were able to turn in their
$2,300 airline tickets but lost about about $100 each in
nonrefundable outlays.
</P>
<P>
   Yu, the Chinese Embassy spokesman, said that while certain
bilateral contacts on military affairs, disarmament, security and
human rights were officially suspended in protest over the bombing,
no break in cultural relations was announced.
</P>
<P>
   A State Department official, who spoke only on the condition of
anonymity, agreed that cultural relations did not appear in
jeopardy and that American Fulbright scholars, for example, were
still being welcomed by China. But he said that many of today's
arts exchanges were on a private basis outside the purview of the
American government.
</P>
<P>
   Claudette Donlon, general manager of the American Ballet
Theater, said the company was wrapping up a contract for a visit
``literally years in the works,'' when the bombing took place. The
company of about 125 was booked for 12 performances in and around
Tokyo in early July and had arranged to go on to China afterward
for at least five performances, some in the Great Hall of the
People.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  That all came to an end on May 11 with a fax from the China
National Culture and Art Corp. whose representative, Chen, told Ms.
Donlon that due to the ``Chinese tragic experience in Yugoslavia,''
American cultural programs were being shelved by the Culture
Ministry. However, he held out hope for another booking, including
possibly a separate tour of China by next February.
</P>
<P>
   Jane Herman, a manager at ICM Artists in Manhattan who often
works with American Ballet Theater, said that after the canceled
date, the Chinese had inquired about booking a smaller ballet
production at no fee, suggesting that financial concerns played
some part in the withdrawn invitation.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Herman said that two other of her projects involving the
Chinese were in some doubt in the wake of the bombing, a
cooperative venture between American Ballet Theater and the
National Ballet of China, and a plan for another Chinese dance
company, which she declined to name, to come to the United States
in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra, with Wynton Marsalis, had
been scheduled to perform from July 13-20 in Shanghai, Guangzhou
and Beijing, but said it had agreed to suspend the tour.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Symphony suffered perhaps the most precipitous
cancellation. Last in China 20 years ago, the orchestra and its
conductor, Seiji Ozawa _ who was born in China but is Japanese _
were in Tokyo and planning to move on to Beijing when the Belgrade
bombing set off street protests and rock throwing at the American
Embassy in the Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Volpe, the orchestra's managing director, said he spent
hours trying to contact American officials and finally concluded
the visit was too risky and had to be canceled.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would have arrived just as the ashes of the victims were
coming home,'' he said. Ozawa did travel to China alone to teach
some master classes and conduct a student orchestra and was well
received.
</P>
<P>
   But Zhang Yu, general director of the China Performing Arts
Agency, faxed a letter to the orchestra on May 9 saying: ``This
barbarous atrocity of NATO has invoked the utmost indignation of
the Chinese government and people. As such, we believe the
favorable atmosphere for this China tour at the moment is no longer
there, and no longer is it appropriate for the tour to be conducted
as originally scheduled.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A languid, sultry air mass will continue to stifle the Deep
South on Thursday. In the western Gulf States, scattered showers
and thunderstorms will develop across east Texas and southern
Louisiana in concert with the leading edge of the sea breeze moving
inland. With lethargic steering winds 18,000 feet aloft, storms
will move slowly, setting the stage for moderately heavy rains and
flash flooding in spots. Isolated waterspouts may accompany
thunderstorms over coastal waters.
</P>
<P>
   Farther east, sultry conditions with widely separated
thunderstorms will persist in the eastern Gulf and Southeast
States. Storms will be more active along the east coast of Florida
and the eastern Gulf Coast from Mississippi to the panhandle of
Florida, where the sea breeze acts as a catalyst to lift very humid
air. In the southern Appalachians, a few storms may approach severe
levels.
</P>
<P>
   Farther north, isolated thunderstorms will develop over the
Middle West, with the most active weather erupting just ahead of a
cool front approaching the western Great Lakes and upper
Mississippi Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Any vestiges from this week's hot spell in the Northeast will
fade Thursday as a south-southwestward moving cool front reaches
the Middle Atlantic States. A stripe of low clouds along and behind
the cool front will span from the northern Middle Atlantic Seaboard
to parts of the central Appalachians. Meanwhile, clouds will
crumble in northern and central New England as cool, dry air
filters south from a high pressure system over the Gulf of Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Raleigh Heat
</P>
<P>
   The temperature rose to 100 degrees in Raleigh, N.C., on Tuesday
for the earliest reading of 100 degrees since records began in
1944. It also marked the first time the temperature reached the
century mark since August 14, 1995, nearly four years ago.
Raleigh's average temperature from late June until mid-August is
nearly 90 degrees. It is surprising that for three consecutive
summers, the mercury never rose more than 10 degrees above normal.
The heat wave will persist Thursday, but cooler air from the
northeast should keep temperatures closer to 80 degrees Friday.

   &UR; BULLY PULPIT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Not too long ago a large seminar was held for ministers in
training.
</P>
<P>
   Among the speakers were many well known motivational speakers.
One such boldly approached the pulpit and, gathering the entire
crowd's attention, said, `The best years of my life were spent in
the arms of a woman that wasn't my wife!`
</P>
<P>
   The crowd was shocked! He followed up by saying, `And that woman
was my mother!` - The crowd burst into laughter and he gave his
speech which, went over well.
</P>
<P>
   About a week later one of the ministers who had attended the
seminar decided to use that joke in his sermon. As he shyly
approached the pulpit one sunny Sunday, he tried to rehearse the
joke in his head. It seemed a bit foggy to him this morning.
Getting to the microphone he said loudly, `The greatest years of my
life were spent in the arms of another woman that was not my wife!`
</P>
<P>
   His congregation sat shocked. After standing there for almost 10
seconds trying to recall the second half of the joke, the pastor
finally blurted out `...and I can't remember who she was!`
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PET NAMES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A guy was invited to some old friends' home for dinner. His
buddy preceded every request to his wife by endearing terms,
calling her Honey, My Love, Darling, Sweetheart, Pumpkin, etc. He
was impressed since the couple had been married almost 70 years,
and while the wife was off in the kitchen he said to his buddy, `I
think it's wonderful that after all the years you've been married,
you still call your wife those pet names.`
</P>
<P>
   His buddy hung his head. ` To tell you the truth, I forgot her
name about ten years ago.`
</P>
<P>
   &UR; IS THIS DIRTY? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   There was artist who worked from a studio in his home. He
specialized in nudes, and had been working on what he thought would
be a masterpiece for several months now.
</P>
<P>
   His model showed up and, after exchanging the usual greetings
and small talk, she began to undress for the day's work.
</P>
<P>
   He told her not to bother, since he felt pretty bad with a cold
he had been fighting. He added that he would pay her for the day,
but that she could just go home; he just wanted some hot tea and
then, off to bed.
</P>
<P>
   The model said, `Oh, please, let me fix it for you. It's the
least I can do.`
</P>
<P>
   He agreed and told her to fix herself a cup too. They were
sitting in the living room exchanging small talk and enjoying their
tea, when he heard the front door open and close, then some
familiar footsteps.
</P>
<P>
   `Oh my God!` he whispered loudly, `It's my wife! Quick! Take all
your clothes off.`

   `Gentlemen, I will tell you the secret of my success,` he
cackled. `I have been in the open air day after day for some 75
years now.`
</P>
<P>
   The celebrants were impressed and asked how he managed to keep
up his rigorous fitness regime.
</P>
<P>
   `Well, you see my wife and I were married 75 years ago. On our

   One of my first evenings back from overseas, my girl's

   Naturally, we did not talk all the time. In the midst of a kiss,
I noticed her little sister in her nightgown watching us from the
doorway.
</P>
<P>
   If you will be a good girl and go to bed, I will give you a
quarter,` I said to her.
</P>
<P>
   Without taking the bribe or saying a word, she ran off but soon
was back again.

   On a recent trip to New York from my home in Hancock, N.H., I
was visiting the Museum of Modern Art, admiring a photograph of a
Michaelangelo statue when a couple with a stroller passed by. Their
child, who seemed to be about a year old, pointed at the photo and
said something in baby talk that I couldn't understand. But the
mother did, responding with evident pride, ``That's right, darling,
it's David.'' I was stunned and asked the father how the child
could possibly know that. Dad replied rather sheepishly that they
had a small copy of the famous sculpture on their refrigerator.

   Frederick Winship was among several people waiting to board a

leaving the bus via the front door. The man took the steps slowly
and with great effort, accompanied by grunts, groans and grimaces.
When he finally got both feet firmly planted on the curb, he looked
at the patient and obviously sympathetic audience and said: ``Don't

</P>
<P>
   One recent morning, after the ebb and flow of the rush hour had
subsided, I found myself almost alone on the subway platform at the
74th Street station in Jackson Heights, Queens. There were six or
eight crowd-control attendants in orange vests on the platform and
I couldn't resist asking, ``Surely it won't take all of you to put
me on the train?'' After some congenial banter, the train pulled in
and we entered, still talking. When they departed en masse a few
stations later, one of them looked back and called to me, ``Let's
do lunch next week!'' It's a wonderful town.

   Michael N. Appell sent off a number of certified letters from
the Franklin D. Roosevelt post office on Third Avenue in midtown
and when the clerk asked if he wanted anything else, he asked for a
roll of 100 stamps. Just then, he noticed a friend and ran over to
greet him. When he returned to the clerk, he paid by credit card
and left. Next week, looking for a stamp and unable to find the
roll, he concluded that he had left it at the post office. He went
back and was told the clerk was on vacation. Two weeks later he
again returned but the clerk was on a break.
</P>
<P>
   This time he told his tale to another clerk who said, ``Yes, he
asked me what to do and I told him to hold the stamps for you.''
The original clerk returned and handed him the stamps and his
receipt.

   &UR; Expanding universe needs our help &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By Charles Memminger &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Honolulu Star-Bulletin &LR;
</P>
<P>
   As an indigenous earthling, I'm proud of this sovereign planet
but it's time for humans to stop being so celestialcentricand start
worrying about the entire universe. An important team of scientists
with extremely good eyesight just figured out that the universe is
possibly 12 billion years old. More importantly, the universe is
expanding at a rate of 70 kilometers per second, faster than Marlon
Brando.
</P>
<P>
   How the scientists figured out the universe is expanding is
really complicated. Basically, it involved sending up the Hubble
space telescope whose sole purpose was to peer deep into universe.
Unfortunately, someone screwed up the main lens of the Hubble and
so for several years, scientists explored the universe through what
essentially was a hellishly expensive Coke bottle. Then NASA sent a
team of astro-optometrists or something into space to install a
glorified contact lens on the Hubble. That allowed the telescope to
really get cracking. What Hubble found was that the universe is
big. Really big. Really big and really old. Before Hubble,
scientists thought the universe was only about 10 billion years
old, which was weird because they knew that certain stars actually
were 12 billion years old. When people asked how stars could be
older than the universe, the scientists just got sullen and testy.
But the Hubble proved that the universe is at least 12 billion
years old, so the scientists were lucky there.
</P>
<P>
   NOW, the thing that has always bugged me about outer space, the
universe and everything is that, if the universe is 12 billion
years old, what was there BEFORE the universe formed. Say you go
back 12 billion years to the very day the universe was formed. What
was there THE DAY BEFORE? Was it just a big old empty space, like a
strip mall department store just waiting for some cosmic tenant to
move in?
</P>
<P>
   Not only was the universe formed in some kind of Big Bang deal
in which complete emptiness suddenly exploded into chunks of
matter, antimatter, watsamatter and other kinds of space stuff, but
it has continued to expand ever since. And fast. Like I said, they
think it's expanding 70 kilometers per second, which is frightening
because most people don't even know how big a kilometer is. But
since they measure the expansion in kilometers instead of good old
American `feet,` you know it's serious.
</P>
<P>
   This finding leads to a couple of important questions, like, if
the universe is expanding, what is it expanding INTO? It has to go
somewhere, right? The fact that it is expanding indicates there is
a SOMEWHERE for it to go. Where is that SOMEWHERE? But more
importantly, WHAT is that SOMEWHERE? Where did that SOMEWHERE come
from? Can that SOMEWHERE hold an entire expanding universe? How
many SOMEWHERES are there out THERE?
</P>
<P>
   I frankly don't know the answer to those questions. And just
writing them down caused a furious brain cramp. But I'll tell you
this, if the universe is expanding, it's a bad thing and probably
our fault.
</P>
<P>
   I suspect that aerosol deodorants, Republicans, rich countries,
bovine flatulence and automobile emissions are causing the universe
to expand. Where is Al Gore when you need him? While he wastes time
with his petty, small-minded, global-warming campaign, stars and
planets are moving away from us faster than a presidential grope.
It's time to `Save the Expanding Universe!` Or at least put it on a
diet.

 &HT;    Honey is all the buzz
 &HT;    WITH FOOD-HONEYRECIPES
 &HT;    By Ann Heller
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   EBANON, Ohio _ The honey bees have polished off the appetizers,
the spring dandelions and honey locust, and now they're ready for
the main course _ the clover.
</P>
<P>
   Roaming over pastures a mile or two away from home, they're
gathering the nectar that provides the mild taste of honey produced
and sold in this area.
</P>
<P>
   Like most of what we eat, there is a season _ even for honey. In
early May, the only honey in tended hives was at the bottom,
reserved for the bees. But then flats to collect the fresh nectar
were installed in the top of each hive. The bees went to work as
the Miami Valley broke into bloom.
</P>
<P>
   In a few weeks, Ray Alley, a beekeeper who sells his honey at
the Warren County Farm Market, will be able to start bottling this
year's production of an estimated 700 quarts.
</P>
<P>
   Alley has hives in six locations throughout Warren County,
including nine hives at the back of his lot in a strip housing
development. That may seem like an odd place to raise a
half-million honey bees, given that their home is within a few feet
of neighbors and close to a kid's climbing gym.
</P>
<P>
   A wooden fence separates the hives from view, but bees have no
regard for a fence.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, neighbors working in their yards do sometimes get stung.
</P>
<P>
   It goes with the territory, which is why Alley's good-neighbor
policy is a periodic gift of honey. Once a new neighbor threatened
to sue him, but the man found out what Alley already knew: ``Ohio
is an agricultural state, and I can have bees anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   He's been working with the bees for 19 years and moved from
Phillipsburg to Lebanon 12 years ago because he thought the
abundant pastures of alfalfa for horse farms would be a source of
nectar for his bees. Then he found out farmers cut the alfalfa
before it flowers.
</P>
<P>
   So he settles for a July harvest of mild clover honey and a
September harvest of honey made from the nectar of goldenrod and
asters.
</P>
<P>
   What he sells is raw honey, merely filtered to strain out any
odd bee parts left behind in the comb. The honey is spun out of the
comb with a centrifuge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the cheapest honey,'' he says. ``But it's pure local
honey and it's raw honey.''
</P>
<P>
   The clover honey that is summer's crop is what most people think
of as honey. It is mild and sweet, right for hot biscuits or, Alley
says, dribbled over ice cream. The fall harvest is more fragrant
with a more assertive taste, and he recommends it for baking or
cooking.
</P>
<P>
   Beelieve it or not
</P>
<P>
   _ A bee lives four to six weeks and never sleeps. The single
bee's lifetime foraging yields only a twelfth of a teaspoon of
honey.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bees, like all creatures, are subject to illnesses. Mites are
a problem that require treatment with antibiotics. Responsible
beekeepers shut down honey collection while the bees are being
treated.
</P>
<P>
   _ Raw honey, available from small producers, is minimally heated
and filtered. Commercial honey is sometimes a blend and often is
pasteurized to extend shelf life and filtered for clarification.
Unscrupulous dealers may add corn syrup to the honey.
</P>
<P>
   _ Flower children of the '60s adopted ``raw'' honey as a natural
alternative to processed sugar, but honey has its down side, too.
Because it clings to teeth, it rots teeth faster than sucrose, and
raw honey has also been linked to a form of botulism, which is why
health practitioners advise not giving honey to children younger
than 2.
</P>
<P>
   _ It is difficult to pinpoint the source of the nectar used to
make honey because bees fly one or two miles to gather it. But
knowing the seasons help identify contributors. Honey harvested in
the Miami Valley in July likely is produced from the clover that's
abundant in June. In the fall it is the flowers of local goldenrod
and asters that provide nectar for the bees. That honey has a
stronger flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Beekeeper Ray Alley has a couple words of advice for backyard
gardeners whose flowers attract bees.
</P>
<P>
   Don't swat at the bee. If you do the bee releases a pheromone
smell that alerts other bees that they are under attack and they'll
come to the rescue.
</P>
<P>
   If a bee does sting you, scrape off the stinger rather than
plucking it, which releases the chemical which causes swelling.
</P>
<P>
   And remember they don't like black. Honest. That's why Alley
removes his watch _ which has a black band _ before he goes to the
hives.

 &HT;    Sweet, syrupy honey complements variety of dishes
 &HT;    By Ann Heller
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The mention of honey evokes images of sweet
desserts, from Greek baklava to Jewish honey cake.
</P>
<P>
   But in some cuisines honey shows up in the main course. A
classic is the Moroccan dish of chicken with tomatoes and honey
called Djej Matisha Mesla. The chicken is cooked in an abundance of
tomatoes finished with honey, and the sauce is cooked down to a
veritable tomato jam.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally the dish should be made with fresh ripe tomatoes, but
Elisabeth Rozin's ``Ethnic Cuisine'' (Penguin, $14.95), offers a
version that uses canned Italian-style plum tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
   MOROCCAN HONEY CHICKEN
</P>
<P>
   Makes 6 to 8 servings
</P>
<P>
   4 to 5 pounds chicken parts or quarters
</P>
<P>
   1 28-ounce can Italian-style tomatoes with juice, coarsely
chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 onion, chopped
</P>
<P>
   4 cloves garlic, mashed
</P>
<P>
   1 6-ounce can tomato paste
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon cinnamon
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons ground ginger
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup fragrant dark honey
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon additional cinnamon
</P>
<P>
   2 additional tablespoons honey
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons toasted sesame seeds
</P>
<P>
   In a large heavy pot or Dutch oven, combine all the ingredients
except the last three. Mix well and cook covered over low to
moderate heat for about one hour, until the chicken is very tender.
</P>
<P>
   Remove chicken from pot and set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Cook down the sauce in the pot over moderate heat, stirring
occasionally, until it is as thick as preserves. When it is thick
enough, add the additional cinnamon and honey. Taste for salt and
adjust.
</P>
<P>
   Return chicken parts to the pot and cook until chicken is heated
through. Place on a serving platter and coat well with sauce.
Sprinkle sesame seeds over.
</P>

calories, skin the chicken): 613 calories; 28 g fat; 202 mg

</P>
<P>
   I started with a recipe from Bon Appetit and made substantial
changes to come up with these chicken wings with Asian accents. The
honey plays a submissive role when paired with ginger, garlic,
sesame oil and star anise.
</P>
<P>
   If you are the kind who thinks more is always better, don't be
tempted to marinate these longer than 12 hours or the soy sauce
will overwhelm the other flavors.
</P>
<P>
   SESAME CHICKEN WINGS
</P>
<P>
   1 cup soy sauce
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup white or rice wine vinegar
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons honey
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons Asian sesame oil
</P>
<P>
   1 cup coarsely chopped green onions
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons chopped fresh ginger
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons chopped garlic
</P>
<P>
   1 jalapeno chile, coarsely chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 star anise
</P>
<P>
   20 whole chicken wings
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup sesame seeds
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup minced cilantro
</P>
<P>
   In a large bowl combine the soy sauce, vinegar, honey and sesame
oil. In a food processor or blender combine the green onions,
ginger, garlic and chile to make a paste. Stir into the soy
mixture.
</P>
<P>
   Cut the wings into pieces at the joints, discarding the wing
tips. Add to the marinade and stir to coat the pieces well. Cover
and refrigerate overnight, for a maximum of 12 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Arrange wings on two foil-lined
baking sheets. Pour the marinade into a small saucepan, add the
star anise and bring to a simmer. Let reduce over low heat for
about 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Roast the wings for 30 minutes, turning once. While the wings
cook, place the sesame seeds in a small skillet and toast in the
oven for 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   When the wings are nicely browned, remove to a serving dish.
Sprinkle with sesame seeds and cilantro. Strain the thickened
marinade into a bowl and use as a dipping sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Serve with plenty of napkins because this is messy finger food.
</P>
<P>
   Flick out the seeds but leave the white ribs in place. That's
what provides the heat in peppers.
</P>
<P>
   Approximate nutritional analysis per piece: 69 calories; 4 g
fat; 14.5 mg cholesterol; 361 mg sodium.
</P>
<P>
   This recipe is from the newly revised edition of ``Keo's Thai
Cuisine'' by Keo Sananikone (Ten Speed, $19.95). While the dishes
are from his Hawaii-based restaurants, the techniques are simple
enough for home cooks. A stop at an Asian store may be necessary
for ingredients such as lemongrass and Sriracha sauce.
</P>
<P>
   That sauce is a very hot chile sauce and is an essential
component for the typical Thai balance of hot and salty, sweet and
sour tastes in this dish.
</P>
<P>
   THAI-STYLE HONEY GLAZED SPARERIBS
</P>
<P>
   Makes 4 to 6 servings
</P>
<P>
   4 pounds baby spareribs
</P>
<P>
   4 stalks lemongrass
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup chopped garlic
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons coarsely chopped fresh ginger root
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup coarsely chopped cilantro
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup honey
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup coconut milk (not coconut creme)
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup soy sauce
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   Sriracha sauce
</P>
<P>
   Cut the spareribs into individual ribs. Cut the top off
lemongrass stalks, reserving the bottom 6 inches. Peel off and
discard the outer layers of the lemongrass to reach the more tender
inner core. Chop the lemongrass coarsely.
</P>
<P>
   In a food processor combine the lemongrass, garlic, ginger,
cilantro, honey, coconut milk, soy sauce and salt. Blend until
smooth. Pour sauce over ribs and marinate overnight in the
refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Place the ribs in an open pan and
bake for 1 hour. Alternatively grill the ribs over hot charcoal.
Serve with Sriracha sauce for dipping.
</P>
<P>
   There is no substitute for lemongrass, and it is usually only
available at Asian markets. You also can grow it _ it becomes a
sizable clump with enough stalks to supply all your friends and
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   If you grow your own cilantro in abundance you can use the
chopped roots instead. That's what the original recipe calls for.

SENATE PANEL APPROVES MONEY FOR MORE BORDER AGENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GARY MARTIN  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republicans on a Senate approrpriations panel
criticized Wednesday the Clinton administration's record on hiring
Border Patrol agents and approved $83 million to hire new recruits
or to boost pay for sworn officers.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers have voiced frustration with the Immigration and
Naturalization Service's recruitment record while violent incidents
among smugglers, illegal immigrants and U.S. agents increase along
the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a crisis along the border,'' said Sen. Phil Gramm,
R-Texas. ``Our borders are being overrun by drug dealers.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Appropriations subcommittee for Commerce, Justice and
State Departments approved the funds to hire 1,000 new Border
Patrol agents for the 2000 budget year, which begins Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The subcommittee also included language blocking the Clinton
administration and the INS from using the funds for purposes other
than raises for agents or new hires.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either the Clinton administration is going to hire 1,000 new
agents, or there will be bonuses to attract new agents and reward
experienced ones,'' Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, told a news
conference. ``We're not providing any flexibility for anything
else.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Spencer Abraham, chairman of the Senate Judiciary
subcommittee on immigration, said he was puzzled by the
administration's failure to use money appropriated last year to
hire 1,000 new agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an administration that wants to put 100,000 new police
on the streets but can't put 1,000 new agents on the border,'' said
Abraham, R-Mich.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno, though, told lawmakers earlier this
year that the Border Patrol is growing too quickly. With at least
9,000 agents, the Border Patrol has more than doubled since 1993,
when there were 4,000 agents.
</P>
<P>
   Reno pointed to a recent study that found that 39 percent of
Border Patrol agents had less than two years' experience.
</P>
<P>
   Groups representing immigrants also have questioned the lack of
experience of Border Patrol agents, citing a growing number of
human rights complaints against federal law enforcement personnel
along the U.S.-Mexico border.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, escalating violence along the Southwest border
makes it imperative that INS ``must not take a breather, but
redouble its efforts to hire more Border Patrol agents this year,''
said Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress appears to be realizing the need to address the
federal government's failure to control illegal immigration and
drug smuggling along our Southwest border,'' said Kyl, a member of
the Senate Appropriations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Hutchison has proposed legislation that would boost
the salary for Border Patrol agents with a year's experience to
$41,000 from $34,000. Hutchison said a pay raise for agents would
help recruitment efforts.

VIRTUAL VARIETY STORES: AISLES OF FREE FILES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHELLE SLATALLA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the Midwestern town where I grew up, there was a store called
Soukup's, which sold just about everything: nested mixing bowls,
``No Trespassing'' signs, sidewalk chalk, badminton birdies and _
if you took the creaky elevator to the third floor _ an enviable
variety of colorful fishing lures. My mother still treasures the
egg timer shaped like a chicken (its wings moved when it ticked)
that I bought for her birthday when I was 10.
</P>
<P>
   After Soukup's disappeared (like so many family-owned variety
stores), I despaired of ever wandering in wonder down aisles
crammed with an exotic, chaotic profusion of items.
</P>
<P>
   Then one day I discovered shareware _ and was saved.
</P>
<P>
   Now I spend hours browsing dozens of Internet sites that
maintain downloadable libraries of software files. I always come
home with useful merchandise. The other day, I picked up a nifty
little program called Netstock, which discreetly displays stock
prices on screen. I also got a copy of Phone Ferret, which
streamlines the process of searching through numerous online
databases to find vital phone numbers, of, say, old boyfriends (not
that I have called any of them). ICQ, the instant message program
that changed my life last year by making it possible to conduct the
Internet equivalent of a dozen simultaneous personal calls, made
its debut as shareware before the company was purchased by America
Online.
</P>
<P>
   The shareware concept dates to 1981, when an IBM employee named
Jim Knopf wrote a database program called PC-File for his own use,
as a substitute for an expensive commercial version. It worked so
well that he distributed copies of it to a few friends, who passed
it on to a few more, who passed it on. Soon the term shareware
referred strictly to software distributed on the honor system to
users who were expected to subsequently send payment.
</P>
<P>
   The label has evolved over the last two decades to encompass
such a wide variety of software that shareware is used almost
generically to refer to any program that you download from the
Internet instead of obtaining in a retail store.
</P>
<P>
   You will still have to pay for some shareware after a trial
period, by sending payment directly to the developers. But other
programs are free (called freeware) and still others are
stripped-down versions offered as free demos. Other programs, known
as guiltware, goad you for payment whenever you use them. And some
untrusting developers create so-called crippleware, which stops
working if you fail to pay after a trial period.
</P>
<P>
   Whether you are an expert or a novice, the process of copying
programs from the Internet _ and then actually getting them to work
properly on your own computer _ has become faster and more reliable
over time. I have seen a major improvement in just the last year.
That is because more and more developers are relying on standard
installation programs to make it easy for users to set up their
software. As an increasing number of commercial software makers
move to electronic distribution as a primary means of getting
products into the hands of customers, they are also creating more
stable shareware to lure new customers.
</P>
<P>
   While many software developers put shareware on their own Web
sites, for a wider selection I recommend one of the reliable and
comprehensive Internet sites with large collections. All three of
my favorite sites _ ZDNet's Software Library, CNet's Download.com
and Tucows _ organize their shareware in easily searchable
categories, review programs to make sure they work and check files
for viruses.
</P>
<P>
   While the Tucows library is smaller than the others, offering a
Best of the Best of Internet-related programs, the other two have a
broad variety in just about any category you might want: tools and
utilities, small business applications, games, graphics and
multimedia, browsers and tons of the variety-store novelties I
like. If the overall feeling of sameness you get from their
inventories makes you feel a little more like you wandered into
Wal-Mart than Soukup's, so be it. After all, some days you don't
want an egg timer shaped like a chicken. You just want one like
everybody else has.
</P>
<P>
   (MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   ZDNET SOFTWARE LIBRARY  &QL; 
www.zdnet.com/swlib  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, this site's home page looks like a carnival
midway with brightly lit booths stuffed full with blinking icons.
So where do you start? If you already know what program you're
after, it's easy enough: the search function is prominently
displayed in the middle of the page. But if you're browsing? Do you
click first on Files in the News? The Weekly Top Ten? Killer
Downloads? Free File of the Day?
</P>
<P>
   All of those are tempting, but I like to start with Hot File of
the Day. Because ZDNet's staff reviews all of the site's collection
of more than 30,000 titles, users get an accurate thumbnail
description of the program. Last week I succumbed to temptation and
downloaded the day's hot file _ an arcade-like maze game called Ant
Run Pro _ and spent an hour playing it.
</P>
<P>
   Then suddenly I got bored with being an ant and deleted the game
from my hard drive. This is a typical user pattern. The day's hot
file is like candy: it lures you with its shiny wrapper, keeps your
interest briefly with its sweetness, and then you crash from the
sugar high and realize you don't need the calories on the hard
drive.
</P>
<P>
   If you have not downloaded shareware before, click on the site's
EZ Download Guide. The step-by-step instructions walk Windows users
easily through the process, from creating a download folder on your
computer to installing and running a demonstration program. The
site includes files for Macintosh users and says it plans to add
instructions for downloading Mac files.
</P>
<P>
   To see ZDNet's trove of new programs, click on Launchpad (in the
Shareware Library Directory), which recently offered a program
called Blackbox to encrypt files and a program to control a remote
computer. The Launchpad area is not to be confused with ZDNet
Exclusives, a compendium of programs written for ZDNet, where
earlier this week you could find a Y2K screen saver with an image
of a computer run amok. I also like Preston's Picks, a collection
chosen by the executive editor, Preston Gralla.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
CNET DOWNLOAD.COM  &QL; 
www.download.com  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CNet site's home page has easily searchable categories
(Business, Education, Development Tools) highlighted right under
the prominent search box. The page's design makes it appear drier
and considerably more streamlined than the ZDnet shareware home
page, but scroll down and you'll realize that CNet's site probably
offers as many choices.
</P>
<P>
   Information here is more layered. For example, to dig deeper
into dozens of subcategories, from Genealogy to Interface
Enhancements, click on Expanded Listings.
</P>
<P>
   The site's Beginner's Guide to Downloading is slightly more
comprehensive than ZDNet's, offering instructions for Macintosh and
Windows users. To find new files that are currently exclusive to
CNet, click on Exclusives. But you won't find any programs created
specially for CNet. ``We're a media company, not a developer,''
said Scott Arpajian, the site's founding producer, ``so we stay
focused on finding the best software.''
</P>
<P>
   Download.com does not maintain copies on its own servers of the
more than 20,000 files in its directory. Instead, the site is like
a huge search engine that links users to other sites where files
can be downloaded. The download process is so seamless that most
users won't even notice.
</P>
<P>
   While some people might argue that it is easier to maintain
quality control if you house your own collection, others would
counter that offering numerous download sites improves access and
speed. I think both methods work just fine. And CNet does
temporarily house 50 of its most popular software files on its own
servers to insure that users have reliable access. Among the most
popular this week were a screen saver with images of waterfalls and
a program that enables you to continue downloading a file even
after being disconnected.
TUCOWS  &QL; 
www.tucows.com  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Instead of taking a generalist approach like the other two
sites, Tucows specializes in software for Internet applications.
Among the site's collection of 2,000 titles are e-mail tools,
browser tools, server tools, online stock quote programs,
multiplayer games, parental control packages, FTP and telnet
programs _ basically anything that is related to anything you could
imagine doing on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Another big difference at Tucows is the download process. The
site's library is housed on hundreds of affiliates' computers
worldwide. Known as mirrors, these affiliate sites contain
identical copies of Tucows' software files. So before you can
download a file, you have to choose a geographical location from
which to download. Tucows says that having so many mirrors gives
the site an advantage: there is never a traffic jam when you want
to download a popular file. In my experience, the method works
fine, but I'd be hard pressed to say that it's any better than the
others.
</P>
<P>
   After choosing a mirror site, you connect to a well-organized
home page with a directory, a search box and a left-hand column of
informational topics, including background on how Tucows picks and
rates software. Be sure to click on Head of the Herd to see the
outstanding program of the week. Instead of stars, Tucows awards
cows to rate programs. Last week's five-cow Head of the Herd
program for Windows users was ECBuilder, software to help users set
up online businesses.
</P>
<P>
   With its streamlined design, Tucows offers an easily navigated
directory of programs. But it has less help for beginners than the
other two major sites. The Help area offers Tucows Specific Tips
that aid in downloading, but there is no step-by-step guide to
teach a novice how to download and install software.
</P>

   ASSOCIATION OF SHAREWARE PROFESSIONALS  &QL; 
www.asp-shareware.org  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This site is an invaluable resource for ferreting out less
well-known collections of shareware. Click on Download Sites in the
lefthand column of the home page to see a chart that lists dozens
of smaller, independent shareware sites around the world, including
www.ded.com/nonags (known for its refusal to stock guiltware _
programs that nag you for payment), www.filepile.com and
www.sharewarejunkies.com.
</P>
<P>
   Click on Sites of Interest for a list of links that lead to such
entertainments as a history of shareware. The site's FAQ answers
shareware questions ranging from ``What if I don't like the
evaluation version?'' to ``What about viruses in software?'' If
you're looking for something even more offbeat than you can find
here, subscribe to a free e-mail newsletter called Lockergnome
(www.lockergnome.com). Recent issues had pointers to Prevaricator,
a freeware lie detector, and a character-name generator that spews
out fictional names to aid authors. So far, however, no screen
saver with an image of an egg timer shaped like a chicken.  &QL; 
Here are additional shareware sites, some of which feature more
specialized programs:  &QL; 
 &QL; 
SOFTWAREVAULT.COM: www.softwarevault.com Allows searching of a
database of Windows, Macintosh, OS/2 and Linux programs; has a list
of new titles and some software reviews.  &QL;

QUANTUM CODE: SECRETS IN THE LIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits) 
 (DW) 
 By PETER WAYNER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The world of codes, ciphers and secrets has always been a bit of
a battleground for the mathematicians and the physicists. The
mathematicians, who have dominated the realm recently, have offered
to keep e-mail, credit card numbers and other Internet traffic safe
with a set of elaborate equations that are just too complicated for
anyone to ever break.
</P>
<P>
   The physicists, on the other hand, have looked for physical ways
to hide information, using microdots (very tiny bits of microfilm),
for instance, or fiddling with obscure parts of the radio spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the traffic on the Internet has largely been
protected by the mathematicians because computers do a great job
with arithmetic. Now International Business Machines is getting
ready to attempt to commercialize the work of some IBM physicists
who have found clever ways of using quantum mechanics to hide
information.
</P>
<P>
   This is no simple decoder ring, and it is not likely to be of
much use to the average e-mail user who wants privacy. But for
corporations or government agencies that can link offices with
fiber optic cables, the method could provide a new kind of
security.
</P>
<P>
   In the simplest terms, the method involves sending, photon by
photon, a message that can serve as a mathematical key after it is
decoded. Such a key can then be used to encode and decode e-mail
messages.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the new encryption system is not for the poor or
the technologically faint-hearted.
</P>
<P>
   The technique is called quantum cryptography. It got its start
in 1989 when a team of IBM researchers, led by Charles Bennett,
announced that it had succeeded in building a contraption that
transmitted a secure message a few feet by flashing a laser on and
off.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett said the system was based on exploiting certain aspects
of quantum physics that govern the realm of the very small.
</P>
<P>
   A quantum system, he said, ``has properties that can't be
measured without disturbing other properties.'' What happens is
that the act of observing affects the photons. So if a spy or
eavesdropper interrupted the message, or even decoded it, that
action would destroy the message itself.
</P>
<P>
   When no message arrived, the intended recipient would know that
something was up.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the eavesdropper could generate and send a copy of
the message, using new photons. But the system developed by IBM has
several steps that would make that almost impossible to do that in
a convincing way.
</P>
<P>
   IBM has now expanded the system to a scale that could be of use
to companies or government agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The company says the system can be used to send an encrypted
message over miles of fiber optic cable.
</P>
<P>
   The IBM scientists encode the information that is sent by making
use of the properties of polarized light _ light waves that are
oriented in only one plane, like the vertical or horizontal plane.
</P>
<P>
   The polarity of regular light is easy to measure because the
light is made up of so many photons (light behaves as both
particles, or photons, and as waves).
</P>
<P>
   Polarizing sunglasses, for example, let through only vertically
polarized light. The glare (horizontally polarized light) is
excluded.
</P>
<P>
   The prototype of quantum cryptography developed by IBM uses a
fast pulse laser that is filtered to produce one photon per pulse.
</P>
<P>
   Each proton can be in one of four polarizations: vertical,
horizontal or one of two diagonals. Which polarization a proton
will have is determined randomly.
</P>
<P>
   The meaning of the polarization is set by the sender. A 1 might
be represented by a single photon that is polarized vertically
while a 0 would be rendered by one polarized horizontally.
</P>
<P>
   The principles of quantum physics guarantee that the receiver
has only one chance to measure the polarization.
</P>
<P>
   The recipient can set the receiver in one of two configurations,
so it can distinguish between vertical and horizontal
polarizations, or between one of two diagonal polarizations.
</P>
<P>
   If the receiver is set correctly, the right answer comes out. If
it is set incorrectly, the receiver cannot determine the
polarization of the proton _ and it gets no second chance because
just trying to determine the polarization destroys it.
</P>
<P>
   The way the receiver is set varies randomly from photon to
photon.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides then communicate without any special security _ by
e-mail, for instance _ to screen out the bad answers. As Bennett
described it: ``Alice sends a random sequence of these four to Bob.
He measures them randomly and gets half correct and spoils half.
Now Alice and Bob use their ability to communicate publicly to weed
out the spoiled one. He tells her how he measured.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, Bob says the receiver was set the first and second
times to determine horizontal or vertical polarization, and the
third time was set to distinguish between the two diagonals. Alice
tells Bob which times the receiver was set correctly _ without
telling him the correct answer, which he now knows.
</P>
<P>
   When correctly decoded, the information sent by the series of
photons will generate a a key, known to the sender and receiver,
that can be used for conventional encryption.
</P>
<P>
   Is the system truly secure? Bennett said that quantum mechanics
practically guaranteed it. Measuring a photon's polarization
correctly will destroy the photon. Any eavesdropper who tries to
snag information will end up blurring the message by destroying
photons.
</P>
<P>
   Nabil Amer is one of the IBM scientists who has just built a
version of this system using off-the-shelf parts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prototype sits on a bench.'' he said. ``My immediate goal
is to turn all of this into a typical card you put in your PC. All
of this stuff that sits in a rack will end up being a card.''
</P>
<P>
   Others wonder if all of the electronics are worth the work.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Schneier, the author of ``Applied Cryptography'' (John
Wiley &AMP; Sons, 1996), said, ``It's always nice to have new
crypto-primitives, but there's nothing that quantum crypto does
that math can't do. The nice thing about math is that it works on
all computers. Quantum crypto requires quantum crypto hardware.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett predicted that quantum cryptographic devices might find
a niche in corporate suites.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will likely be a vanity item,'' he said. ``The boss has a
fancy computer _ even if he doesn't know how to operate it. If you
think your conversations are very important and it only costs $500
to put it there, then you might do it. People would come in and
think he must be very important because he needs quantum
cryptography on his desk.''

   The New York Times News Service will move the following
entertainment/arts articles this week for release Sunday, June 13,
1999. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ENTERTAINMENT &AMP; ARTS (Moved in `e' category) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FILM AND VIDEO &LR;
</P>
<P>
   RUN-LOLA-RUN-FILM (Undated) _ Not many films have inspired both
a hair color and a conservative politician's campaign poster. But
the German director Tom Tykwer's ``Run Lola Run'' certainly did.
The film, which has sold more than two million tickets in Germany
and which opens in Manhattan on Friday, is the anarchically charged
story of a flame-haired punk, Lola (Franka Potente), who races
through the streets of Berlin in a desperate attempt to save her
boyfriend's life. By Laura Winters. (Moved). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ANITA-EKBERG-FILMS (Genzano, Italy) _ With Anita Ekberg, 68,
talk usually revolves around the Fountain of Trevi, a monument
forever associated with the scene in ``La Dolce Vita'' in which she
dances in its waters so alluringly. It has been many decades since
she looked like the dewy sex goddess who entranced Marcello
Mastroianni in Fellini's 1960 classic. Or sounded like one. Her
once satiny, babyish whisper (``Marcello, come, join me'') has
become harsher with time and tobacco. But with her deep,
authoritative voice, imperious manner and carefully tended face,
she still looks and acts very much the diva. The Belgian director
Yvan Le Moine has cast her as a mercurial retired opera star in his
feature film debut, a Fellini-esque art film called ``The Red
Dwarf,'' which opens in New York on Friday. By Alessandra Stanley.
(Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THEATER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   COYLE-LISTEN-THEATER (Undated) _ Brendan Coyle has spent almost
400 performances, his elbows propped on a bar, a lager or a whisky
at the ready, listening to his fellow players in ``The Weir'' turn
a litany of ghostly tales into a haunting study of collective
self-revelation. But playing a bartender also named Brendan, Coyle
never gets a story of his own, unless you believe _ as some do _
that Brendan's tale begins once Conor McPherson's play ends. Can
listening be its own reward? As Coyle's acclaimed performance shows
_ in February, he won an Olivier Award in London for best
supporting player _ listening has the capacity to be as potent as
speech. By Matt Wolf. (Moved). Photo. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DANCE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-DANCE-MEMOIRS (Undated) _ Here's a little secret I wonder
if it's wise for a critic to share: I often find that traveling to
someplace new, or at least someplace not routinely familiar, puts
me in a good mood for seeing performances. By Jack Anderson.
(Moved). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CLASSICAL MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ORCHESTRAS-FUTURE (Undated) _ When the Cleveland Orchestra was
at Carnegie Hall last month, giving concerts led by its music
director, Christoph von Dohnanyi, and a former principal guest
conductor, Pierre Boulez, Ara Guzelimian, the hall's artistic
adviser, took the opportunity to convene a public discussion. The
two maestros and Joseph Polisi, the president of the Juilliard
School, were asked to speculate on what orchestras might be like in
the next century, as institutional bodies and as artistic machines.
By Paul Griffiths. (Moved). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BOULEZ-MUSIC (Undated) _ The modernest composer, Pierre Boulez,
development as a major musician of our time has been well
documented on disk. Now 74, he has understandably begun to cut back
his conducting commitments. But he continues his work in the
recording studio. Three important recent releases on
Deutsche-Grammophon, the company with which he has been most
closely associated of late, present Boulez as conductor and
composer. By Anthony Tommasini. (Moved). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ART &LR;
</P>
<P>
   PROVINCETOWN-ART (Provincetown, Mass.) _ Whether they come to
party or to produce, diverse artistic types still succumb to
Provincetown's natural beauty and mystique. This summer,
Provincetown marks its centennial year as an art colony. By Ann
Wilson LLoyd. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   NY-ARCHITECTURE (New York) _ Jean Nouvel's new design for a
hotel and cineplex on the Brooklyn waterfront strikes me as one of
the most imaginatively conceived pieces of architecture New York
has seen in a long time. By Herbert Muschamp. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   HERMITAGE-MUSEUM (St. Petersburg, Russia) _ For a museum that
has miraculously survived the 20th century (two revolutions, two
wars and Russia's messy eight-yearlong lurch toward democracy), the
Hermitage, keeper of one of the world's greatest art collections,
is doing its best to get a jump on the coming millennium. This
week, it will launch what experts describe as one of the best
digital libraries on a museum Internet site, put together by IBM
technicians working with the latest scanning technology, some of it
designed especially for IBM's $2-million Hermitage project. By
Celestine Bohlen. (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TELEVISION &LR;
</P>
<P>
   TV-MINI-SERIES (Undated) _ A look at some of the proposed
television mini-series for the fall. By Ron Wertheimer. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ANTIQUES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DEPERO-ART-ANTIQUES (Miami Beach) _ The stunning variety of
works the Italian painter and designer, Fortunato Depero, produced
are explored in ``Depero Futurista Rome-Paris-New York,
1915-1932,'' an exhibition here at the Wolfsonian museum of design,
through July 26. Most of the 160 items on view were produced before
1932, but some date to the late 1940s. Aside from a chair and
several books from the Wolfsonian collection, the objects on view
were lent by the Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art of Trento
and Rovereto, towns 20 to 30 miles north of Verona in northern
Italy near Fondo, the village where Depero was born. But from
earliest childhood until his death at 68 in 1960, Depero lived
mostly in Roverto, where he worked at the House of Art, the studio,
showcase and shop for his art and furnishings. By Rita Reif.

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ In his 30-year television career, the round-faced
comedian popularly known as Paco Stanley charmed millions of
Mexicans with his jocular but razor-edged way of clowning and
mocking, of putting them down and exhorting them to be good.
</P>
<P>
   So when Stanley fell victim at high noon on Monday to a coolly
professional execution by gunfire, the jolt of disbelief spread
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The two major national television networks seized on the
shooting to blame the head of Mexico City's government, a leader of
the opposition, for failing to protect people. The media assault on
Mayor Cuauhtemoc Cardenas Solorzano, who is expected to run for
president next year, transformed the crime into a traumatic
polarizing event at the opening of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But 24 hours later police announced that Stanley was carrying a
stash of cocaine in his pants when he was killed. The political
tide spun about, and Mexicans got another devastating revelation of
the influence of drugs and organized crime in segments of life they
had hoped were clean.
</P>
<P>
   The operation to kill the comedian, whose full name was
Francisco Stanley Albaiter, was carried out ``with a high degree of
criminal precision,'' in the chilling words of Mexico City's
attorney general, Samuel del Villar. But three days into the
investigation, del Villar has not speculated about a motive and
carefully avoided linking the homicide directly to drug
trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   Just after Stanley, who was 56, climbed into the passenger seat
of his minivan after a hearty brunch at a favorite taco joint, at
least two men dressed in gray strode up to the car and started
firing high-caliber semiautomatic pistols. In all, police found 26
rounds imbedded in Stanley's face and scattered in and around his
vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Stanley's chauffeur nor his two bodyguards, who were
unarmed, nor his son, Francisco Stanley Pedroza, who was in the
back seat, were injured. But a restaurant customer, Juan Manuel de
Jesus Nunez, was killed by flying bullets. Nunez's wife, a
restaurant parking attendant and Jorge Gill, a television reporter
who was with Stanley, suffered gunshot wounds.
</P>
<P>
   The gunmen used a a crosswalk over a highway streaming with cars
to flee and drove away in a stolen 1999 Volkswagen Jetta sedan that
was waiting for them on the other side. Police found the abandoned
getaway car Tuesday morning. Blood stains on a car handle and on
the crosswalk led investigators to believe that one of the gunmen
was shot by a restaurant security guard and was limping during his
flight.
</P>
<P>
   Both national television networks had a reflex reaction to the
murder of one of their most well-loved and valuable colleagues,
which graphically revealed their underlying favor for the federal
government run by President Ernesto Zedillo and his Institutional
Revolutionary Party, known as the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   Both networks all but ignored the details pointing to an
organized crime execution. Instead they concentrated on the grief
about the loss of a light-hearted entertainer and the fury about
the wave of common crime in the capital city, which, in fact, is
little abated.
</P>
<P>
   Televisa, which for decades had a virtual monopoly protected by
the government, brought a battle horse news anchorman, Jacobo
Zabludovksy, back from retirement to lead the hours of live
coverage. Stanley worked together with Zabludovksy at Televisa for
27 years as hosts of variety shows that were watched devotedly by
Mexican housewives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are hostages to crime everywhere,'' Zabludovksy said as
cameras scanned the gory crime scene. ``How can the city
authorities possibly try to tell us that crime has gone down?''
</P>
<P>
   TV Azteca, the competition that lured Stanley away earlier this
year, was even more indignant. The network's president, Ricardo
Salinas Pliego, cleared the airwaves for his own nationally
broadcast attack on the city authorities. One TV Azteca anchorman,
Jorge Garraldo, berated Cardenas personally and said, ``Someone has
to resign and make way for people who really can protect us.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas, whose reticence before the press is legendary, endured
the punishment in silence until late Monday night. Finally he
fought back with a communique calling the killing ``a clear
demonstration of the power of organized crime'' and accusing the
television networks of ``creating anxiety among city residents and
taking political advantage of the events.''
</P>
<P>
   The clash continued Tuesday, as both networks gave lavish live
coverage to Stanley's raucous funeral. Some four thousand fans
surged into the cemetery, trampling nearby graves. The mourners
nearly upended Stanley's coffin and crushed his relatives as they
tried to make their way into the spacious, marble-lined family
crypt.
</P>
<P>
   TV Azteca positioned a camera inside the crypt and provided
close-up views of the weeping bereaved throughout the burial
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ``Justice! Justice!,'' the mourners chanted. Some carried
placards comparing Stanley's killing to the still-unsolved 1994
assassination of the PRI's presidential candidate, Luis Donaldo
Colosio, a crime that continues to haunt Mexican politics.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But the networks were soon forced to lower their volume and the
federal government and the PRI's presidential candidate suddenly
found themselves on the defensive.
</P>
<P>
   At an evening press conference, del Villar, the attorney
general, announced that police found half a gram of cocaine in
Stanley's pocket, a stainless steel powder grinder with residues of
the drug in his car and a small lesion inside his nose that
forensic specialists described as common to those who frequently
snort cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   While Stanley' blood tested negative for cocaine, his urine
tested positive, the head of city forensic services, Dr. Pedro
Estrada Gonzalez, said. He said the findings strongly suggested
that Stanley was a habitual cocaine user. The authorities did not
produce any evidence that showed he was engaged in drug commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Mario Bezares, Stanley's veteran comic sidekick who was with him
at the restaurant, also tested positive for cocaine, the police
said.
</P>
<P>
   The police also discovered that Stanley was carrying a photo
credential issued by the national Interior Ministry. It identified
him as an employee and authorized him to carry ``any firearm
permitted by law for personal civilian use.''
</P>
<P>
   In May, when the credential was issued, the interior minister
was Francisco Labastida Ochoa, now the front-runner to be the PRI's
presidential candidate and probably to face Cardenas in the
elections next year. It is a federal crime for a public security
agency to identify someone as an employee who is not.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday Jorge Tello Peon, the deputy interior minister for
public security, acknowledged that the agency had issued the permit
to Stanley, at his request. Stanley had said that he had been
assaulted several times and needed to defend himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the way permits should be issued,'' Tello said.
``It was an exception.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanley's family members continued to insist that they never
knew him to use drugs. But some of Stanley's fans began to wonder
openly and sadly if they ever knew who he really was.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as Saturday night Stanley had taken time on his show
to launch an appeal in his seductive deep base voice for an
anti-drug campaign aimed at Mexican youth that TV Azteca has
sponsored. It is called ``Live Without Drugs.''

A PHONE FOR THE INTERNET WITH MORE SPEED AND LESS GLARE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Norway, The Netherlands, Calif.)   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last year, Infogear, a start-up company, introduced its iPhone,
a phone for the Web with built-in e-mail and browsing software. The
new generation, the iPhone Series 2000, is a marked improvement.
</P>
<P>
   The black-and-white touch screen is still just a quarter of the
size of a standard PC monitor, but now it tilts to eliminate glare.
The pull-out keyboard is a comfortable size for touch typing. The
new model has a second jack so voice and data connections can take
place simultaneously, and it has a much speedier 56K internal
modem. A speakerphone has been added as well.
</P>
<P>
   Like its predecessor, the new iPhone is relatively easy to use.
Connecting to the Web is a straightforward matter of taking the
machine out of the box, plugging it into the wall, attaching a
phone line and going through five screens of registration. E-mail
is just as easy.
</P>
<P>
   Infogear's idea is to have customers place the iPhone on a
kitchen counter, or in any high-traffic section of a home, and use
it with the casual frequency of a telephone.
</P>
<P>
   One drawback to the iPhone is the steep cost. The retail price
of the iPhone will be $299 to $399. But Infogear, based in Redwood
City, Calif., is negotiating with several large telephone companies
that would subsidize the unit and sell it for as little as $199,
together with monthly phone and Internet service, said the
company's chief executive officer, Ed Cluss.
</P>
<P>
   The iPhone is currently available through Big Planet
(www.bigplanet.com), an Internet service provider in Provo, Utah,
and will go into wider distribution this summer. KATIE HAFNER &QR;

<P>
   TO ENTER THE WORLD OF E-MAIL, INSERT BATTERIES AND PLUG IN  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A simple and inexpensive device will now let the computerless
get e-mail, too.
</P>
<P>
   That, at least, is the thinking behind the Mail Station, a $99
e-mail appliance, the size of a small laptop, from Cidco
(www.cidco.com). Like the network computer desktops of old, the
Mail Station is a stripped-down computer with a simplified
operating system. At 2.2 pounds and 8 inches by 10 inches, it is
the size of a laptop, but its unlit monochrome screen, measuring 6
inches by 2.2 inches, makes it look markedly different. To send and
receive e-mail, you simply pop in some AA batteries (or use the AC
adapter), plug the unit into a wall jack and start typing. A list
of local-access phone numbers is provided.
</P>
<P>
   Cidco engineers threw in a 1,000-item address book that can
capture and add addresses, a spell checker, a calendar and a
33.6-kilobit-per-second modem that can also send faxes. A
12-megahertz processor and 512 kilobytes of memory may not sound
zippy, but e-mail without graphics requires no more.
</P>
<P>
   What the Mail Station can't do, of course, is surf the Web. The
intended market is people without PCs who just want to push one
button to get their mail.
</P>
<P>
   Mail can also be received at a Web site, handy for viewing
messages with pictures attached that are too big for the system.
The unit can also be attached to a printer, which will be handy
because it can't save the same number of messages as desktop
systems. It saves up to 400 e-mail messages.
</P>
<P>
   The device costs $99 when a buyer also pays $99 in advance for a
year of e-mail service. If a buyer opts for an e-mail account at
$9.95 monthly, the device costs $149. The device is currently
available only from Cidco, bundled with an e-mail account. In the
future, others may resell the device with other services. MARTY

   A VIRUS CHARTS A NEW COURSE USING E-MAIL AND CHAT ROOMS
</P>
<P>
   Another virus bent on rummaging through your electronic address
book has turned up in recent weeks. Pretty Park, like the notorious
Melissa, finds its new victims by picking up e-mail addresses that
are stored in an infected computer's address book and sending
itself to dozens of your friends and family members.
</P>
<P>
   But Pretty Park does more than spread spam. The virus _ which is
technically a worm, a file that replicates itself _ tries to open a
channel from its host computer to a chat room. If it succeeds, it
has opened a pipe through which files can be downloaded from and
uploaded to the host computer without the computer owner's
knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very unusual,'' said Steve Trilling, director of research
at the antivirus research center run by the Symantec Corp.. ``We
haven't seen anything like it.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the author of the virus is still unknown, Symantec's
engineers have been able to analyze the worm's code and determine
the chat rooms it is using, Trilling said. As of Tuesday, about 600
computers were connected to the chat rooms, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many software companies that sell antivirus software have now
added Pretty Park to their databases of viruses to block. LISA

   The latest entrant to enter the carpal tunnel battle is a mouse
that looks as if it has a pen stuck into its back. The device,
called Dr. Mouse, looks more like a World War II movie fighter's
joystick than a standard mouse, with a handle sticking up and mouse
buttons instead of a trigger.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The manufacturer, Animax International of Norway, says the
design changes the way a user holds a mouse, consequently reducing
stress on the nerves and muscles in the arm and reducing the
likelihood of several forms of cumulative trauma disorders. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Instead of the one-size-fits-all approach of a regular mouse,
Dr. Mouse comes in a small and large version, designed to fit hands
of different sizes. It is available for Windows, Macintosh and
several Unix-based workstations, and there is a USB version for the
iMac. STEVEN E.BRIER &QL;

   A SEARCH ENGINE WITH AN EYE FOR THE EMERGING COMMUNITIES  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What do inflatable sumo-wrestling suits and machine shops in
Taiwan have in common? They are the subjects of communities of
linked Web sites, communities so obscure or ill-defined that many
Web directories don't list them.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of undiscovered Web communities _ from sites devoted
to Brazilian sports newspapers to Japanese oil spills _ have been
uncovered by a new search engine, Clever, developed by researchers
at the IBM Almaden Research Center in San Jose, Calif. Clever
identifies the most authoritative Web sites on a topic by using the
information implicit in the links people place from their Web page
to others. The Clever team observed that related pages frequently
linked to the same cluster of pages; that pattern of links,
associated with the core of a Web community, is the flag the new
software looks for.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Web rings, the communities found by Clever are unplanned.
Unlike newsgroups, they spring up spontaneously as people create
new Web sites and link to other pages _ they are more like
shantytowns than planned suburbs. Clever can detect communities in
their nascent stages, even before members are aware of their
community's existence.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Clever nor the new software is ready for the market,
but, an I.B.M. spokesman, Mike Ross, said several search engine
companies had expressed an interest. A Clever researcher, Dr.
Sridhar Rajagopalan, said the ability to follow the birth and
growth of online communities might be useful for studying the
structure and evolution of the Web. SARA ROBINSON &QL;

   A theory of progress says that for every technological advance,

discovered some particularly unsavory reverse effects. Bug-zappers,
the devices hung around backyards in barbecue season, do kill flies
and mosquitoes, but they also cause airborne bacteria and
virus-laden particles from the insect's surface area and digestive
canal to rain down. ``We're finding really significant amounts on
the surface of the fly will survive,'' said James Urban, an

</P>
<P>
   Aficionados of Vincent van Gogh may have felt like cutting off
their own ears lately: the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam has been
closed for renovations since September 1998. So for those who could
not get through the spring without ``The Langlois Bridge'' or ``The
Potato Eaters,'' the museum put much of the collection on its
impressive Web site (www.vangoghmuseum.nl).
</P>
<P>
   When the museum reopens in late June, a renovated Web site will
also be unveiled, featuring a virtual room-by-room tour of the
museum, including close-ups and background information for each
painting and, of course, chat rooms for van Gogh fans, who never
seem to lack for intensity.

PATROL PUTS DRONES TO TEST FOR KEEPING EYE ON BORDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DANE SCHILLER  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAREDO, Texas _ The U.S. Border Patrol is encouraged by secret
tests of unmanned planes that could use cameras and remote controls
to sweep isolated portions of the Rio Grande for drug traffickers
and illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Four drones, ranging from a hand-launched spear with wings to a
650-pound model that looks like a shopping cart with an airfoil and
giant fan, were part of a $1.8 million study that quietly wrapped
up here last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``These things are not flawless. In theory, the technology
exists to benefit Border Patrol operations,'' Lee Bargerhuff,
assistant chief for the patrol's Laredo sector, said Wednesday as
the agency disclosed the tests.
</P>
<P>
   They were conducted out of the public eye on a private ranch
about 30 miles northwest of the border city of Laredo.
</P>
<P>
   The small aircraft, known as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, can be
outfitted with cameras that see night or day and can transmit live
images to agents stationed up to 50 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Some drones can be programmed using global positioning systems
and other satellites. Others are remotely controlled by operators
sitting in vehicles or using mobile control panels with joy sticks
and shoulder harnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Findings of the study, which was conducted with the Air Force
Operational Test and Evaluation Center in New Mexico, are to be
forwarded to Congress in July, Bargerhuff said.
</P>
<P>
   Consideration of the drones is still at in the preliminary
stage, and it would be up to Congress to fund more tests, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The drones are seen as a potential way to patrol vast areas for
undocumented immigrants lost in the brush or to chase or monitor
smugglers until agents on the ground can arrive, Bargerhuff said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are clear limitations. They are not intelligent. They
can not look over their shoulder,'' Bargerhuff said of the unmanned
craft.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the craft could potentially conduct mundane watchdog
duties and alert agents to determine in advance if a group of
suspects appear to be harmless illegal immigrants or armed drug
smugglers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The technology boost would be yet another upgrade for the Border
Patrol. Infrared scopes and ground sensors are already part of the
arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the patrol received a fleet of helicopters
costing $1.8 million each.

 &HT;    Business Week sees 24-hour trading
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Plans by the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq
market to extend trading for several more hours after the current 4
p.m. closing time is just the next step toward 24-hour trading.
</P>
<P>
   It's an example, says Business Week (June 14), of the world's
move toward ``Internet time,'' where trading will be anytime,
anywhere, affecting all of the world's financial centers. And if
the Internet is the technology that will make 'round-the-clock
trading possible, competition is the motive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. exchanges _ particularly Nasdaq _ have been feeling
the heat from private trading systems known as Electronic
Communications Networks,'' says Business Week. These computerized
systems that match buy-and-sell orders from investors have stolen
more than a fifth of all trading in Nasdaq stocks.
</P>
<P>
   As a practical matter, many institutions _ such as mutual funds
_ that need a benchmark time against which to measure changes will
continue to treat 4 p.m. as the official market close, although a
later hour could be chosen.
</P>
<P>
   Extended trading will complicate the release of earnings and
other corporate financial reports and almost certainly result in
longer hours for some stockbrokers and financial journalists.
</P>
<P>
   That's one reason brokers are not the ones who are driving this
change. The impetus is coming from the retail investor, who says
that we have 24-hour groceries, pharmacies, diners, casinos and
bowling alleys, why not stock markets?
</P>
<P>
   Guidance from Fortune
</P>
<P>
   Just in time for extended trading, Fortune (special issue) is
out with its 1999 ``Tech Buyers Guide,'' a compendium of articles
and advice on computers, software, the Internet and related
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``As every user knows, picking the right information technology
for work or home is a daunting task,'' the magazine explains,
adding that this guide ``offers readers the critical information
necessary to make technology product and services buying
decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Worth mentioning . . .
</P>
<P>
   _ Georgia Trend (June) profiles Roy Richards Jr., chairman and
chief executive officer of Carrollton-based Southwire, as recipient
of its 1999 ``most respected CEO'' award. Richards revamped and
streamlined the wire manufacturer's organizational structure to
increase its competitiveness, the magazine says.
</P>
<P>
   _ One of the surprises in world currency markets has been the
unexpected weakness of the euro, the new European currency. That's
bad for Europe but American tourists are feasting off the change
since the costs of goods and services are cheaper, Newsweek (June
14) reports. The cost to rent a yacht for a week in Spain has
dropped to $1,246 from $1,400 in January; a pint of Guiness in
Ireland is $3.20, a saving of 40 cents from the January price.

   SEATTLE _ A University of Washington aeronautics professor and

space vehicle they will launch in 2001 as the first self-propelled
small satellite.
</P>
<P>
   Called ``nanosatellites,'' a group of these tiny but
sophisticated devices will be launched to conduct studies in the
ionosphere _ an upper layer in the atmosphere above the
stratosphere where free ions and electrons roam, interfering with
radio and satellite communication signals.
</P>
<P>
   Three Dawgstar satellites, along with a half-dozen
nanosatellites from other institutions, will be released into orbit
by the space shuttle. The tiny satellites' own propulsion system
will then kick in, directing them to fly in a pattern formation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been other small satellites built,'' said Mark
Campbell, UW associate professor of aeronautics and astronautics.
But few have ever been launched, Campbell said, and none have ever
had their own propulsion system.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least not that we know of, in terms of civilian
satellites,'' added Adam Bruckner, UW chairman of aeronautics and
astronautics. We don't always know what the military is doing with
its satellites, Bruckner noted.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is the military _ the U.S. Air Force and the Defense
Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) _ that are primary
sponsors of the UW project. It's a hint nobody's beaten Campbell
and his ``nanosat'' team to the punch.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, some of the 27 UW undergraduates working on Dawgstar
presented their mission plan and design to representatives of
Primex Technologies, a Redmond, Wash.-based space, defense and
electronics company.
</P>
<P>
   Primex, which has been offering technical and professional
assistance to the UW since the Dawgstar project started last year,
is a world leader in propellant systems for use in spacecraft and
launch vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The Dawgstar will be using a tinier version of an electrical
propulsion system made by Primex for use in larger spacecraft and
satellites. Called a pulsed plasma thruster, it's driven by
electrical energy supplied by solar cells on the exterior walls of
the satellite.
</P>
<P>
   The electrical energy harvested by the solar cells is used to
create a high-powered spark between two electrodes located next to
a solid bar of Teflon. This electrical arc vaporizes the Teflon and
creates a plasma burst or pulse, which is violently ejected,
creating thrust.
</P>
<P>
   Primex took an interest in assisting the Dawgstar team because
it provided them an opportunity to test a refined version of their
thruster in a new way _ as a propellant but also for use as a
satellite positioning method.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a way to demonstrate another application of our
technology,'' said Scott Miller, project engineer in space systems
for Primex. ``This would be a test case.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell explained that the Dawgstar satellites, along with
nanosatellites built by teams at the University of Utah and
Virginia Tech, aim to fly in formation. Using GPS (global
positioning system) signals from other satellites, he said, the
nanosatellites will be positioned to orbit in formation.
</P>
<P>
   Testing this ``flying formation'' of all the satellites,
Campbell said, is also one of the research goals in addition to
studying the ionosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers need larger telescopes if they are to see deeper
into space, he said, but getting beyond the size of the Hubble
Space Telescope is cumbersome and expensive. One of NASA's goals is
to develop networks of satellites that can collect data coordinated
together over a larger area of space, Campbell said, and ``in
effect, create a huge telescope.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The distance between the satellites is equivalent to the
diameter of the telescope,'' he said. In addition, deploying such a
system is much more inexpensive and easier than launching ever
larger telescopes.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Campbell said, the U.S. Air Force and DARPA have
contributed $100,000 to the Dawgstar project, which is named after
the UW Husky mascot. NASA has also supported the research, he said,
and Primex's donation of expertise has been invaluable.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said the project is exciting and provides a good bridge
between his company and students at the UW. He and others spent
several hours Tuesday with the nanosat team, pointing up areas that
need more work and questions that still need to be answered.
</P>
<P>
   Once the design is approved, graduate students at the UW will
take over the actual manufacture of the satellite. Miller said
Primex has agreed to donate use of its facilities for this stage of
the project, along with its testing facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell said the plan so far is to have the nanosatellites
taken up by the space shuttle, or perhaps a Pegasus rocket, in
November 2001 where they will be released. Upon release, the
Dawgstar and its nanosat companions will thrust into position and
cruise throughout the ionosphere for several months, or until they
fail and burn up upon re-entry.

AN ORDINARY GOALIE? ANYTHING BUT

 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ He's just a goalie. That's what the Ottawa Senators
kept telling themselves as they were being drummed out of the
playoffs in four straight games in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   He's just a goalie. That's what the Bruins said even though they
had a Vezina Trophy finalist of their own in Byron Dafoe.
</P>
<P>
   He's just a goalie. That familiar refrain continued right
through the Sabres' series against the top scoring team in the
league _ Toronto, even though said goalie missed the first two
games because of injury.
</P>
<P>
   Only the Bruins were able to take the Sabres to six games. The
Senators were swept and the Maple Leafs lasted only five games in
the Eastern Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   Enter the Dallas Stars.
</P>
<P>
   Before Game 1 of the Stanley Cup finals Tuesday night, the
Stars, who had the best regular-season record in the league, kept
saying _ you guessed it _ he's just a goalie.
</P>
<P>
   After the Sabres had taken a 3-2 overtime victory, the Stars
realized what every team before them learned the hard way.
</P>
<P>
   Dominik Hasek is not just a goalie.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas had 10 power plays and poured 37 shots on Hasek, many of
which were outstanding chances. Brett Hull, who had the first Stars
goal, landed eight shots on Hasek, five in the first period alone.
</P>
<P>
   Even more remarkable than Hasek's performance was his reaction
when Buffalo defenseman Jason Woolley scored the winner at 15:30 of
the extra period. Hasek started down the ice, stopped, couldn't
make it far enough to celebrate with his teammates, and headed for
the dressing room instead.
</P>
<P>
   There was fear that Hasek's nagging groin problem had flared up,
but Wednesday he said that was the least of his problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never played before in such a hot building,'' said Hasek,
who was hampered by cramps and dehydration. ``I was very tired. I
tried to drink as much water as I could but I remember in the
overtime, I made the save on (Pat) Verbeek and I got a cramp. I was
glad that a couple seconds later or a minute later that we scored
the winning goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so tired. I tried to get to the other side of the ice
but I made a couple of steps and I said, (`No more') and I left the
ice. I don't remember when I've ever been so tired during a game.
My groin didn't bother me the whole game. I feel good.''
</P>
<P>
   Hasek wasn't exaggerating about his fatigue. The league's public
relations staff had to call and wake him up so he could attend the
Sabres' press conference Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo coach Lindy Ruff said his entire team was affected by
the uncomfortable temperature in Reunion Arena although Hasek
suffered more because of his extra pads and the numerous power
plays he faced.
</P>
<P>
   ``The building was very hot,'' said Ruff. ``In the first two
periods, we spent a lot of time in our zone. There were a lot of
scrambles, a lot of situations where Dominik was up and down and
making saves. A lot of those flurries are the things that really
tire you out. I thought at least in the third period we took the
pressure off and spent some time in the other end and gave him a
little bit of a break. Then again in overtime, we had to kill two
penalties. We were concerned with dehydration in a lot of our
players. Obviously a goaltender, where he has all the equipment on,
probably is a worst-case scenario.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, the result was a best-case scenario for the Sabres,
who took away Dallas's home-ice advantage. Hasek downplayed his
contribution, saying he simply was doing what he's paid for.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did my job,'' he said. ``In the playoffs, there's nothing
about shutouts or goals-against average. It's only about the win.
My goal is to win the game, to give up less goals than the other
goalie, and I've done my job.''
</P>
<P>
   Hasek doing his job as well as he has enables his teammates to
better do theirs. Even though the Sabres committed some ill-advised
infractions, their aggressive penalty killing and Hasek's
reliability neutralized the mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this time of the year, every player knows where they're
supposed to be, they know the system we're playing,'' said Ruff.
``I think you've got to be loose. When you win your first game,
you're playing a bit more loose and we also stress that, with our
goaltender, we can take a few more chances. We can create some
problems for the other team by having the defense jump in and
having the defense pinch. We've gone that way a few times and it's
worked out good.''
</P>
<P>
   As the temperatures in Dallas remain high and the staff at
Reunion Arena try to come up with ways to keep the rink cool, Hasek
said he didn't expect to change his pregame routine for Game 2
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I can do anything else than what I did before
the last game,'' he said. ``I was drinking lots before the game and
during the game. But there's only a certain amount you can drink.
Your stomach starts to get upset after you drink two bottles of
water and you can't drink any more.''
</P>
<P>
   What might be diminished somewhat, though, is Hasek's acute
nervousness. Ruff said he sensed a genuine case of jitters among
his young players and Hasek admitted Wednesday that he was not
immune to the butterflies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very, very nervous before the game and during the
game,'' said the goalie. ``But there's nothing bad about it. It's
good to be nervous, it keeps you more focused and more
concentrated. The pressure helps me play better.''
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't bode well for the Stars. Then again, he's only a
goalie, right?

RAFER JOHNSON A LEADER NOT ONLY IN TRACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first Special Olympics was held in a backyard.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't the Special Olympics as we now know it, with
organizations in all 50 states and 143 countries, with 4,000
athletes and volunteers headed for the 30th anniversary of the
Southern California Special Olympics Summer Games this weekend at
Long Beach State.
</P>
<P>
   Rafer Johnson, a few years removed from world record and Olympic
medal-winning performances as a decathlete, was a guest at those
backyard games held in the mid-'60s by Eunice Kennedy Shriver,
whose older sister, Rosemary, was mentally retarded.
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't a gathering for one person who happened to be a
member of the Kennedy family. This was the first step of a movement
that literally took the mentally retarded out of the shadows.
</P>
<P>
   ``The athletes there had the chance to swim, play touch
football, run and ride horses,'' said Johnson, chairman of Southern
California's Special Olympics Board of Governors. ``They were
enjoying themselves. It was very clear that they wanted this
opportunity and were enjoying it very much.''
</P>
<P>
   And that was not the way the mentally retarded were usually
treated.
</P>
<P>
   Rafer Johnson, a multi-sport star at UCLA who won the 1960
Olympic decathlon gold medal, was already thriving as a political
and community activist when he was invited to the Shriver home. It
didn't take him long to learn about the issue and make it a
priority in his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ms. Shriver thought something should be done,'' said Johnson.
``Not because of her sister, but because she knew what was
happening to the mentally retarded. At that time, most of the
mentally retarded were institutionalized. They were separated from
their families and had little access to any kind of learning or
physical activity.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson visited several of those facilities, where he saw the
mental retarded housed with those suffering from other, more
debilitating mental illnesses. He also met with doctors and
professors at those backyard competitions about what could be done.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I saw in those institutions were people who had been left
to die,'' he said. ``What I saw in the backyard were people who,
instead of being pushed or held back, were able to grow and enjoy
aspects of life that we're all entitled to, handicapped or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question about the impact sports and competition
can have. When they find success on the field, it gives them the
ability, awareness and desire to achieve in a job. It makes their
life whole. It fills a void that hadn't been filled before.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Shriver's backyard camps evolved into the first Special
Olympics, which were held in Chicago in 1968. Johnson helped
organize those games and a year later launched the first western
regional event at the Coliseum. The event moved to Long Beach in
1970, and returns this year after many years at UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has long been one of Southern California's special
people. His family moved from Texas to Kingsburg in central
California when he was 11, and its first year there lived out of a
railroad boxcar.
</P>
<P>
   He became a multi-sport star in high school and college. He set
a world record in the decathlon in 1955, won the Olympic silver
medal in the 10-eventer at Melbourne in 1956, played two years of
basketball for John Wooden (1958-59), and then won the 1960 Olympic
gold medal in Rome in a memorable duel with his UCLA teammate, C.K.
Yang. At the end of the decathlon's last event, the 1,500 meters,
the two literally leaned on each other in exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's sports background gave way to a life as an activist in
politics, charity and community work. He worked for Bobby Kennedy's
1968 presidential campaign, and was at the Ambassador Hotel when
the candidate and former U.S. Attorney General wasassassinated. He
was the finalcarrier of the 1984 Olympic torch,scaling the Coliseum
peristyle stepsto ignite the flame atop the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Few athletes are more qualified as role models. But the reality
is that Johnson has touched many more people as a civic leader than
he ever could have as a full-time athlete.
</P>
<P>
   His parents were his role models, activists in his schooling and
life as well as the Kingsburg community.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mom and dad always helped,'' he said. ``They coached and
helped build fields with other families for all of the kids in the
neighborhood. Growing up in a small town made me realize how
important it is for people to help each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could not have found as much success as I have if I hadn't
had that kind of direction. I grew up with a deep to-the-core
feeling about giving back.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson and his colleagues in the Special Olympics have future
goals for their athletes. The organization wants to start directing
Special Olympics athletes into the athletic mainstream, just as
many have been redirected to regular classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   And Johnson has his own life goal to continue urging everyone,
from major corporations with many resources to the man on the
street who thinks he's strapped for time, to give back to the
community.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are places where anyone can put his talents to use,'' he
said. ``Any time of the day or night. We can find something to fit
your schedule. People shouldn't wait for someone to come up with a
perfect scenario. They should just get involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't anyone out there who got where he is just on
talent. Someone helped. Somebody created a program and pointed you
in the right direction. And it doesn't matter how many people give
time, how many programs exist, how much money is raised. We still
need more. There will never be enough volunteers or money or
programs to fill all of our needs. Look for places to help. They're
easy to find.''
</P>
<P>
   They could even be in your own backyard.

HUNTING FOR KERNELS OF WIT IN MTV'S GOLDEN POPCORN  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By CARYN JAMES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every now and then the camera at the MTV Movie Awards settles on
a strange man in the audience: shoulder-length auburn hair and long
beard, blue-tinted granny glasses, hands full of silver rings,
smoking a cigarette. He looks like he has been hiding out in a
tattoo parlor for 20 years only to emerge, like some biker version
of Rip Van Winkle, at a show dominated by hip-hop and glitz.
</P>
<P>
   But there is something familiar about his face, and it doesn't
take the whole show to figure out he's Jim Carrey, waiting to
collect his award for best male performance for ``The Truman Show''
and to offer a deadpan explanation of his get-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``After this year's so-called Oscar race,'' he begins, swaying
as if he's too stoned to stand and alluding to the fact that he was
not nominated for an Academy Award, ``I realized that answerin' to
the man just ain't where it's at.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a funny performance, reflecting the irreverence that should
be automatic for these awards. The trophy, after all, is a bucket
of gilded popcorn. The show, which was taped on Saturday, is about
entertainment, not suspense. Some acceptance speeches were recorded
in advance by absent stars like Gwyneth Paltrow; by now
``Entertainment Tonight'' and ``Access Hollywood'' have revealed
the winners. But this year's installment is so flat that the Carrey
stunt leaps out as a moment of high energy in a show that
desperately needs to regain its satiric edge.
</P>
<P>
   As in any failed satire, the problem is the writing. The movie
parodies that are the heart of the show are lame, even when the
usually dependable Mike Myers appears as both the villainous Dr.
Evil and the goofily heroic Austin Powers from his new,
overpromoted film, ``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the Carrey moment, you can count the show's
highlights: two. In a satire of ``Armageddon'' called ``Armageddo'n
Sync'' a giant asterisk hurtles toward earth and only the group 'N
Sync can save the world. A fake prize category, ``best dramatic
pause,'' offers clips of actual films in which actors look
concerned just a little too long. In ``Deep Impact'' Morgan Freeman
and a room full of White House advisers stare silently at one
another when they learn a meteor (or is it an asterisk?) is heading
their way.
</P>
<P>
   The host, Lisa Kudrow, offers a smooth variation on her Phoebe
ditziness from ``Friends.'' For his song ``Wild Wild West,'' Will
Smith leads a splashy group of dancers in what can only be called a
production number. There is a stream of big-name presenters, from
Courtney Love to James van der Beek and Ricky Martin, every
teen-age girl's dream boy of the moment. Somehow an almost serious
Hollywood attitude has crept in.
</P>
<P>
   Of course everything is relative. Compared with Sunday's
moribund, self-important Tony Awards show, the MTV Movie Awards
seem positively raucous. However disappointing the script, you have
to love the idea behind an awards show with a category like ``best
villain,'' whose nominees include Chucky, the killer doll from that
masterpiece of cinema ``Bride of Chucky.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE CHIMP CHANNEL
</P>
<P>
   TBS, Thursday at 10
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it seems that a bunch of monkeys couldn't do worse
than what's already on television; apparently they can. This
half-hour sitcom about a television channel run by chimps proves
that it takes more than monkeys with wigs and dubbed human voices
to make a comedy. ``The Chimp Channel'' is so scattershot and
predictable it becomes tiresome in about five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   That the mogul chimp who owns the network has an Australian
(that is, Murdochian) accent is funny once, not repeatedly. The
brief parodies of television shows and movies offer mere glimpses
of wit.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Treewatch'' a diva chimp called Monica wears a blond Pamela
Anderson wig and a red ``Baywatch'' bathing suit. In
``Braveheart,'' the heroic chimp has a blue-painted face; it might
have been funnier if the punch line hadn't been about lightning
bolts flaring out of the chimps' rear ends.

 &HT;    Democrats decry NRA influence on gun control proposals
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton and congressional Democrats
accused House Republicans on Wednesday of buckling in to the
National Rifle Association and gutting proposed gun control
provisions scheduled for a House vote next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a bill, plainly, ghostwritten by the NRA,'' said
Clinton, speaking at a Justice Department conference. ``I think it
is wrong to let the NRA call the shots on this issue. They've been
calling the shots on this issue for decades now, and we have failed
to do what is manifestly in the interest of our children and our
communities.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton angrily invoked the shootings of 12 students and a
teacher at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can still remember Littleton _ it hasn't even been two
months _ then we ought to speak up and be heard,'' Clinton said.
``This is a classic, horrible example of how Washington is out of
touch with the rest of America.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton delivered his remarks as the first details of the gun
control proposals drafted by Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry
Hyde (R-Ill.) and Rep. Bill McCollum (R-Fla.) began circulating
among both gun control advocates and the gun lobby.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed language by Hyde and McCollum, to be offered as an
amendment to a massive juvenile crime bill, would soften some of
the requirements for criminal background checks conducted at gun
shows. Closing the so-called gun show loophole was a major flash
point in the Senate, which three weeks ago adopted strict language
to govern when and on whom the checks must be conducted.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Hyde acknowledged that Judiciary Committee
members had consulted the NRA in drafting the gun control
proposals. But Hyde denied that the changes represented a
capitulation to the powerful gun lobby, which has waged a
grass-roots campaign to kill the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't help draft it; they looked at it,'' Hyde said.
They had some commentary. But it's not an NRA provision.''
</P>
<P>
   Gun control proponents seized on two aspects of the
Hyde-McCollum legislation they said would dramatically weaken
similar provisions narrowly passed by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Senate bill, gun shows would be defined as any
gathering where more than 50 guns were offered for sale. The House
version changes that requirement to any gathering where more than
10 dealers are brought together.
</P>
<P>
   Kristen Rand, an analyst with the Violence Policy Center, said
the change could conceivably mean that nine dealers could sell
thousands of guns but still not be required to conduct background
checks. Guns sold at flea markets, for example, might not be
covered.
</P>
<P>
   But Paul McNulty, chief counsel for the Judiciary Committee,
said the Senate language was so broad that private sales between
gun collectors could be defined as a gun show. The House language
also would reverse a fundamental provision of the 1968 gun control
law passed after the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy,
his brother, Robert, and the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. Under that
law, sellers at gun shows are prohibited from shipping guns to
buyers out of state. The House version would permit dealers to ship
guns out of state after conducting a criminal background check on
the buyer. In a live video feed on the NRA's Web site, an NRA
announcer trumpeted the change in language to allow guns to be
shipped to buyers, noting that the provision ``was not allowed
under current law.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, he added that NRA leaders were still encouraging
members to contact their member of Congress and ``let them know we
don't need more gun laws.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Barr (R-Ga.), the only member of the House who is an
NRA board member, said through his spokesman that he could not
support the Hyde-McCollum amendment on gun shows ``as is.'' The
spokesman declined further comment.

<P>
   No war is to be revelled in, but the one that at last seems to
be drawing to a close in Kosovo leaves an especially bitter taste.
</P>
<P>
   Formally, we have won, since it is our leaders and our generals
who are dictating terms to those of the vanquished Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   But historians will long argue whether this war should ever have
been fought; whether Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic made it
inevitable, or whether more skillful diplomacy might have avoided a
conflict that has compounded the tragedy it was supposed to
prevent.
</P>
<P>
   And, we are entitled to ask, was it a ``war'' at all? In a war,
do not two sides engage each other in battle, and both sides suffer
casualties?
</P>
<P>
   But Kosovo 1999 will feature on no regimental roll of honor.
This was among the very few wars fought not in pursuit of national
interests but for reasons of simple humanity. However, there is no
sense of triumph, or of virtue rewarded.
</P>
<P>
   There might have been, had NATO suffered some casualties or had
Milosevic _ architect of a decade of misery in the Balkans _ been
overthrown. But he has not been, despite a one-sided contest in
which the Allies have not lost a single life in battle.
</P>
<P>
   This has been war by remote control, carried out by deadly
machines _ one without heroes, only victims: the million or more
ethnic Albanian refugees (now to be followed, surely, by tens of
thousands of ethnic Serb refugees) and the dead and maimed
civilians who constitute the ``collateral damage'' of errant NATO
bombs.
</P>
<P>
   For all the wicked things they have done, one can feel even a
shred of sympathy for the Serb commanders in the tent at Kumanovo,
obliged to surrender to an enemy they have barely seen, let alone
laid a glove on.
</P>
<P>
   All of which only reinforces our own obligation to spare no cost
or energy so that the refugees in whose name we fought this ``war''
can return home safely and in peace. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   ``We'll dig up our dead and take them with us,'' a Kosovo Serb
from Pristina said this week, on hearing the terms of the peace
plan. ``There's no chance the Serbs will stay.''
</P>
<P>
   The sight of Serbs in Kosovo exhuming their ancestors may bury
Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   When the Serbian leader overthrew his predecessor, Ivan
Stambolic, in 1987, it was for being ``soft'' on the Kosovo
question, and he became the idol of Serbia with his pledges to
crush the Albanians' hopes of taking Kosovo out of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Now he has to sell his people a peace plan that ``soft'' old
Stambolic would never have dreamed of swallowing.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has performed U-turns before _ after the humiliating
defeat of the Croatians Serbs in 1995 and the subsequent Serb
exodus from Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
   He may pull it off again, using his grip on Radio Televisija
Serbija to hammer home the message that only his stubborn
resistance saved Serbia from occupation by NATO. Out in the
provinces they may even believe it.
</P>
<P>
   But Milosevic will have to reconfigure his regime. The
ultranationalists of Vojislav Seselj's Radical party and the
Serbian Orthodox Church must go. But new partners must come on
board.
</P>
<P>
   Step forward the secular socialists of YUL (United Yugoslav
Left), a party run by Milosevic's wife, Mirjana, and maybe even Vuk
Draskovic, the eccentric leader of the Serbian Renewal Movement,
chucked out of the Serbian government at the start of the war for
his doveish statements.
</P>
<P>
   For all the rumors of military coups and talk of popular
disillusion, there is no obvious replacement for the man whose 12
years as leader have seen Serbia dragged ever deeper into an abyss.
</P>
<P>
   His rivals inside Serbia are a group of envious, quarrelsome
political dwarfs, and while they complain about his disasters, none
ever suggested following a different course in Croatia, Bosnia or
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect a revolt from within the ranks of the security
forces either. The army may be seething but the real power in
Serbia is Milosevic's large, well-armed paramilitary police. This
is the regime's Preatorian guard and it will sink or swim with its
paymaster.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest threat to Milosevic comes from the unlikely
quarter of Montenegro, Serbia's junior partner in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   He ought to have crushed that nut when he had the chance. Now he
must endure Montenegro's youthful president, Milo Djukanovic,
lecturing him about how stupid he was to take on NATO in the first
place.
</P>
<P>
   Djukanovic plays with the idea of taking Montenegro out of
Yugoslavia. But he may decide the stay, now the Serbs are humbled,
and angle for the post of Yugoslav president himself. &QL;

THE PERFECT COACH? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The search for the perfect NBA coach continues.
</P>
<P>
   Should he be an all-time, all-time All-Star? Oh, hi there, Mr.
Bird.
</P>
<P>
   Should he be a pretty-good-but-not-great pro player who has
earned a reputation as a superb teacher, albeit a very neurotic
one? Right this way, Mr. Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Should he be a very good pro player who always believed the game
was more of an art form than a science? Say hello to Mr. Westphal.
</P>
<P>
   Should he be a championship-oriented, role-playing pro whose
former reputation as an innovator has regressed into a new image as
the game's mad scientist/funny uncle? Make way for Mr. Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   Should he be a coaching move-up-the-ladder lifer and workaholic
who patiently sits around until the big names over him implode, one
way or the other? Meet Mr. Van Gundy.
</P>
<P>
   Should he be an end-of-the-bench pro player who lucks into a
team with superb talent and gradually assumes the aura of a Captain
Queeg-style loner of a ``genius''? Bonjour, Monsieur Riley.
</P>
<P>
   Should he be an OK college player who sees the world through the
military and who pays his dues at forgotten levels of college ball
before getting a professional entree from the aforementioned
neurotic professor of hoop? Best of luck in the Finals, Mr.
Popovich.
</P>
<P>
   Should he be _ Ryan, that's enough!
</P>
<P>
   Or _ bear with me one more time _ should he be a fine pro player
turned announcer who has never coached a day in his life?
</P>
<P>
   John Gabriel apparently thinks that's the way to go. He's the
man who has just hired Doc Rivers to coach the Orlando Magic.
</P>
<P>
   That's Glenn ``Doc'' Rivers, as in the 13-year NBA Doc Rivers,
as in the three-year NBA commentator for Turner Broadcasting, as in
the never-run-a-practice-in-his-life Doc Rivers.
</P>
<P>
   The non-experience obviously doesn't faze Mr. Gabriel. I mean,
just listen to the Magic's general manager blow his horn for his
new coach.
</P>
<P>
   After stating that he was ``blown away'' by Doc's interview,
Gabriel shifted into high rhetorical gear. ``He has demonstrated
over the course of his career to be a true leader and has been
preparing for this day for some time. He has a magnetic personality
and a sharp basketball mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Hey, John, why don't you tell me something I didn't know?
</P>
<P>
   Understand that there are a few of us around here who have felt
very proprietary toward Mr. Glenn ``Doc'' Rivers ever since he
showed up on the Chicago team in the Boston Shootout a few years
back and put on one of the great shows in the history of that
cherished event. He had a bum knee and didn't have much of a first
half, as I recall.
</P>
<P>
   I also recall him unwrapping an Ace bandage from his knee with a
theatrical flourish and then pouring in 31 points in the second
half, leading his team to victory. From that point on I maintained
a very healthy interest in Mr. Glenn ``Doc'' Rivers.
</P>
<P>
   A few years after that he showed up in the NBA as a member of
the Atlanta Hawks. They grabbed him with the 31st pick in the draft
back in 1983, and what they got was a very capable NBA guard who
was able to make the transformation from shooting guard to point
guard and who earned a reputation as a very solid professional. Was
he a great player? No, he was not. But he was a good one, and he
did get himself into the 1988 All-Star Game in Chicago, where he
played not merely like someone who was happy just to be there but
also like someone who seemed to believe he really didn't belong
there. His 5-for-11 performance from the line was testimony to his
nervousness.
</P>
<P>
   But in what was then the biggest game of his life _ the famed
Game 7 Bird-Dominique fourth-quarter shootout _ the next best
player on the court was Doc Rivers. You ought to get hold of that
tape. There was far more to that game than just Larry and
Dominique. It was a phenomenal game that puts to shame anything the
league can offer today. And on that occasion Doc Rivers out-DJ'd
DJ.
</P>
<P>
   He remains one of the most likable NBA players I've ever known.
Unfailingly polite and gracious, he also revealed himself to be a
thinker. There was no doubt in anyone's mind that a broadcast job
awaited him the minute he was through playing, and that's exactly
what happened. Nor did he disappoint. He was a good announcer who
was continually getting better.
</P>
<P>
   Turner Broadcasting vice president Kevin O'Malley got to know
Doc during the past three years, and you can put him down as a
paid-up member of the Doc Rivers Fan Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a very smart and capable guy,'' says O'Malley. ``People
talk about the need to motivate today's young player, and in this
regard I think Doc will be aces. He has an extremely positive
intensity about the game. He is intense about the game in an upbeat
and positive way. He is simply very extroverted about the game. I
think he will be a terrific players' coach.''
</P>
<P>
   The modern formula for success when the new coach is a
basketball guy who has never coached is to surround him with guys
who can. This is how Hall of Fame coach Chuck Daly, Doc's immediate
predecessor, entered the NBA. The 76ers hired Billy Cunningham to
be Billy Cunningham. Daly was minding his own business at Penn when
the Kangaroo Kid rang him up and asked him to be his X and O man.
It's the Larry Bird M.O., too. Larry knew all the things he didn't
know, so that's why he hired former head coach Dick Harter and
future head coach Rick Carlisle to be his, well, teachers, thus
freeing him to be Larry Bird, a job he can handle very nicely.
Rivers now needs his own support system.
</P>
<P>
   There is no guaranteed formula for NBA coaching success. Doc
Rivers is, after all, Orlando's fourth coach since the start of the
1996-97 season.
</P>
<P>
   Check that. There is one 100 percent, fully guaranteed path to
NBA coaching success. You get hired to coach Michael Jordan just
when His Airness has all his fitting-in-with-teammates issues
sorted out. No offense, Mr. Jackson, but we all know this to be
true.

   ``We'll dig up our dead and take them with us,'' a Kosovo Serb
from Pristina said this week, on hearing the terms of the peace
plan. ``There's no chance the Serbs will stay.''
</P>
<P>
   The sight of Serbs in Kosovo exhuming their ancestors may bury
Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   When the Serbian leader overthrew his predecessor, Ivan
Stambolic, in 1987, it was for being ``soft'' on the Kosovo
question, and he became the idol of Serbia with his pledges to
crush the Albanians' hopes of taking Kosovo out of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Now he has to sell his people a peace plan that ``soft'' old
Stambolic would never have dreamed of swallowing.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has performed U-turns before _ after the humiliating
defeat of the Croatians Serbs in 1995 and the subsequent Serb
exodus from Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
   He may pull it off again, using his grip on Radio Televisija
Serbija to hammer home the message that only his stubborn
resistance saved Serbia from occupation by NATO. Out in the
provinces they may even believe it.
</P>
<P>
   But Milosevic will have to reconfigure his regime. The
ultranationalists of Vojislav Seselj's Radical party and the
Serbian Orthodox Church must go. But new partners must come on
board.
</P>
<P>
   Step forward the secular socialists of YUL (United Yugoslav
Left), a party run by Milosevic's wife, Mirjana, and maybe even Vuk
Draskovic, the eccentric leader of the Serbian Renewal Movement,
chucked out of the Serbian government at the start of the war for
his doveish statements.
</P>
<P>
   For all the rumors of military coups and talk of popular
disillusion, there is no obvious replacement for the man whose 12
years as leader have seen Serbia dragged ever deeper into an abyss.
</P>
<P>
   His rivals inside Serbia are a group of envious, quarrelsome
political dwarfs, and while they complain about his disasters, none
ever suggested following a different course in Croatia, Bosnia or
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect a revolt from within the ranks of the security
forces either. The army may be seething but the real power in
Serbia is Milosevic's large, well-armed paramilitary police. This
is the regime's Preatorian guard and it will sink or swim with its
paymaster.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest threat to Milosevic comes from the unlikely
quarter of Montenegro, Serbia's junior partner in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   He ought to have crushed that nut when he had the chance. Now he
must endure Montenegro's youthful president, Milo Djukanovic,
lecturing him about how stupid he was to take on NATO in the first
place.
</P>
<P>
   Djukanovic plays with the idea of taking Montenegro out of
Yugoslavia. But he may decide the stay, now the Serbs are humbled,
and angle for the post of Yugoslav president himself. &QL;

 &HT;    Georgia governor draws fire with plan to spend tobacco money
 &HT;    By Alan Judd
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Gov. Roy Barnes defended his plan to spend one-third
of the state's $4.8 billion tobacco settlement on rural economic
development rather than using it all on health care, contending
Wednesday that job growth promotes public health.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to understand that Georgia is a tobacco-producing
state, and a large part of rural Georgia is going to be adversely
affected,'' Barnes said. ``I know of nothing that is more directly
connected with health than the ability to be employed and to be
able to eat. ... I don't consider that to be any kind of a change
from what I've said all along.''
</P>
<P>
   But as Barnes justified his new spending proposal, anti-tobacco
activists and some Republican legislators reacted with dismay,
saying the plan represented an inappropriate use of the tobacco
settlement, as well as a reversal of Barnes' promises to dedicate
the money to health care.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating,'' said Lynn Thogersen, coordinator of an
Atlanta-based anti-smoking coalition, ``because the whole intent of
the settlement was to win this financial compensation for the
state, to help recoup a small portion of the state's money that's
been spent on tobacco-related illnesses. The intent was never to
subsidize farmers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were basically asked by the governor's office to work with
him to ensure that this money went for health care,'' Thogersen
added. ``This is a total shift from what we've been told.''
</P>
<P>
   State Senate Minority Leader Eric Johnson (R-Savannah) said the
governor's proposal to spend money _ about $68 million the first
year _ on rural development would generate ``a big debate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a huge amount of money,'' said Johnson, who supports
using the settlement for smoking prevention and for tax cuts. ``I
want to see a lot more details. But I would be hesitant at this
point to support that.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Georgia tobacco farmers will receive $309 million of
a separate $5.15 billion payment from tobacco companies to growers,
Barnes said a portion of the state's settlement should go to South
Georgia's tobacco-producing counties to ``encourage industry and
business to come there and help offset some of the lost jobs in
tobacco and to provide a better-trained work force for those
jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   But Barnes complained that any discussion of spending the
state's settlement is premature. ``We're straining here,'' he said,
``talking about things that are down the road.''
</P>
<P>
   He had outlined his ideas in a May 26 letter to state
legislative leaders, saying one-third of the settlement should
bolster ``the bottom 25 percent of the counties in Georgia that are
not prospering along with the rest of the state.'' The other
two-thirds, he wrote then, would ``offset some existing health care
responsibilities and expand health care to some uninsured segments
of our state.''
</P>
<P>
   If Georgia spent its entire settlement (to be paid out over 25
years) on health care, it would be one of the few states to resist
the temptation to dip into the tobacco loot.
</P>
<P>
   A study by the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, a
Washington-based advocacy group, found that four states have
devoted most of their settlements to smoking prevention programs,
while 16 have spent nothing on prevention.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had some successes,'' said Peter Fisher, who supervised
the study. ``But more states are not spending it on tobacco
prevention than are.

   PRISTINA _ If cliches were permitted in places like Pristina,
city of fear would not be good enough.
</P>
<P>
   There are rifle shots in the empty streets, loud, close at hand,
from somewhere behind the 15th-century Imperial Mosque. There is
the constant roar of NATO jets and a thump of bombs in the hills
around Kosovo's capital that changes the air pressure on Marshal
Tito street.
</P>
<P>
   There are acres of looted houses, homes to the persecuted
Albanians, two of whom I met _ still I wonder at their courage _
walking down the Corso arm-in-arm, a husband and his pregnant wife
waiting for their day of liberation.
</P>
<P>
   And there are the Serbs, fearful of their future, unable to sell
their homes, tens of thousands of them, still unable to grasp what
Yugoslavia's ``peace'' with NATO really means.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Albanians are coming with NATO,'' a blond girl said.
``This will become an Albanian city.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO, of course, is quite unconcerned by the fate of Kosovo's
remaining 100,000 Serbs _ mostly civilians and innocent of the
crimes of Serb militiamen _ and is already talking blandly of their
``probable'' departure.
</P>
<P>
   First the Kosovo Albanians were ``ethnically cleansed'' by the
Serbs. And in a few days _ two weeks at most _ the Serbs will be
``ethnically cleansed'' by NATO's Albanian allies.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. President Bill Clinton and British Prime Minister Tony
Blair have both promised to protect Serbs as well as Albanians in
this dark land. Both will fail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moving around is not safe _ you have to know that,'' an army
major told us frankly.
</P>
<P>
   I have the impression that Pristina is already lost to the
Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, there are the heroes. Two of them were the Albanian
couple and another was a reservist soldier called Zoren Brankovic
who runs the biggest key-cutting shop in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   A big, bespectacled man with a large tummy that strained at his
army vest, Brankovic pointed to the single-story yellow-painted
house on Ruga Zejtaret with its ornate stucco work above the three
front windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father was born here and I was born here and all the
Brankovic's lived in this small area,'' he said. And he pointed to
the mass of rubble at one end of the street _ NATO's work _ in
which his cousin had died.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I will never leave. This is my home _ my very own home
which belongs to our family. I have a brother here and a wife and
three sons and we want to live here with our Albanian neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Albanian people of Pristina were never a problem _ the
money of the KLA and the mafia is the problem. Everyone came to my
shop _ Albanians, Turks, Serbs, Montenegrans...''
</P>
<P>
   But that was then, and this is now. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (125-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 475) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Walking past the bombed-out post office _ NATO's work again _ we
found Marjana and her boyfriend Nikola, arms draped around each
other, she holding a red-yellow rose on a long stem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should I leave when this is my home and my country?'' she
asked.
</P>
<P>
   Nikola, who was at work in the Jugopetrol plant when NATO
destroyed it in April, talked about the Orthodox monastery at
Gracanina and admitted he wanted to marry Miljana with her long
brown hair and the rose which he had given her.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should never have stopped the war when they did,'' the
girl said suddenly. And there was another of those loud, echoing
rifle shots. Who was shooting at who, I asked?
</P>
<P>
   They shrugged. But I suspect their ignorance. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONCLUDES) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I have a shrewd, unpleasant suspicion that the Kosovo Liberation
Army are not waiting for NATO to enter Pristina to stake their
claim. I think they are already here, amid the houses of the
dispossessed, waiting to move before a single British paratrooper
marches down Marshal Tito Street.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, not far from Urosevac _ scarcely 15 miles from here _
the Israeli journalist Ron Ben-Yishai drove into an ambush Tuesday
morning, receiving a bullet wound in his leg along with his Serb
driver Ivan Cvejic.
</P>
<P>
   The KLA fired 20 bullets at a bus on the Pristina-Prizren road a
few hours later.
</P>
<P>
   So what life is left for the Serbs here? For mile after mile
Tuesday, I drove alone through an abandoned Kosovo on the road from
Raca, the Albanian homes long incinerated by the Serbs _ though one
was burning away in a field, a bright orange fire blooming from its
windows _ and just one Serb family sitting on the porch of their
cottage.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors are already moving through Pristina that the Serbian
government will not allow the 100,000 Serbs to leave Kosovo, that
the cities of central Serbia cannot absorb more refugees (Kraljevo,
they say, has already taken 6,000 to add to the thousands from
Krajina in 1995).
</P>
<P>
   A thunderstorm was darkening the skies as I approached Luzane
and fingers of lightening were touching the still bright, empty
meadows to the west. On the bombed-out bridge still lay the
skeleton of that terrible bus _ the Pristina-Nis bus that NATO
destroyed with a missile last month _ with its steel roof frame and
scorched iron seats and a boy's sodden left-hand boot on the road
beside it.
</P>
<P>
   Below, beside the river into which many of the dead were thrown
_ Serbs and Albanians alike _ I found a tangle of decaying clothes
and a spray of plastic flowers, bright crimson and yellow and
purple amid the real pale blue cornflowers of the riverbank, a
token of remembrance to the death of both Serbs and Albanians _ the
very last memorial to a Kosovo that might have been but never was.
</P>
<P>
   For they are still here, the Albanians; not many perhaps. But
the couple we stopped on the Corso Tuesday afternoon told _ between
frightened glances and the wife's nervous pleas to her husband to
stop talking and leave _ the story of the last two months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spend all our time in a flat,'' he said simply. ``Day and
night. We just stay in, that is all. We move from house to house,
from flat to flat, all the time, in case they come for us. My own
brother has disappeared. I've been to the Milosevic police to ask
where he is.''
</P>
<P>
   At this remark I drew in my breath, loudly. Kosovo is not a
place for the brave. ``No, I couldn't find him,'' the man muttered.
``I have lost my own brother.''
</P>
<P>
   His wife muttered desperately again, a young woman in a long red
dress with jewelry on her hands, newly pregnant, a child conceived
amid her people's nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   They turned away from us, the Albanian couple, and walked
quickly away, arm in arm, waiting for the tomorrow that they and
Zoren Brankovic, deep down in their hearts, fear more than they can
ever admit. &QL;

very last memorial to a Kosovo that might have been but never was.
</P>
<P>
   For they are still here, the Albanians; not many perhaps. But
the couple we stopped on the Corso Tuesday afternoon told _ between
frightened glances and the wife's nervous pleas to her husband to
stop talking and leave _ the story of the last two months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spend all our time in a flat,'' he said simply. ``Day and
night. We just stay in, that is all. We move from house to house,
from flat to flat, all the time, in case they come for us. My own
brother has disappeared. I've been to the Milosevic police to ask
where he is.''
</P>
<P>
   At this remark I drew in my breath, loudly. Kosovo is not a
place for the brave. ``No, I couldn't find him,'' the man muttered.
``I have lost my own brother.''
</P>
<P>
   His wife muttered desperately again, a young woman in a long red
dress with jewelry on her hands, newly pregnant, a child conceived
amid her people's nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   They turned away from us, the Albanian couple, and walked
quickly away, arm in arm, waiting for the tomorrow that they and
Zoren Brankovic, deep down in their hearts, fear more than they can
ever admit. &QL;

 &HT;    Court considers boss' staring: Harmless or sexual harassment?
 &HT;    By Bill Rankin
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If a boss constantly follows an employee around the
workplace, is that sexual harassment? What if he also stares up and
down at her in a suggestive manner?
</P>
<P>
   During a lively argument Wednesday, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals considered a case likely to decide how far suggestive
behavior in the workplace can go.
</P>
<P>
   One federal judge suggested that the behavior alleged in the
lawsuit went beyond a sexual harassment claim _ it was enough to
prompt a self-respecting woman to throw a ``haymaker'' at the man
giving her the eye and following her around.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Red Mendoza began working for Borden Inc. at its Miami
facility. By late 1994, she was being followed constantly by Dan
Page, the highest-ranking executive at the office, her lawsuit
against the company claims.
</P>
<P>
   Page also stared at Mendoza, looking her up and down and then
fixing his gaze on her groin area, Mendoza contends.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge dismissed Mendoza's claims at trial, and she
appealed.
</P>
<P>
   In October, a three-judge panel of the 11th Circuit ruled
unanimously that her sexual harassment claims should be allowed to
go before a jury. But in March, a majority of the 12-member court
voted to vacate that decision and allow the entire court to
reconsider the issue. The court's decisions set federal law in
Georgia, Alabama and Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under what circumstances, if any, does a supervisor's
'following' and 'staring' at an employee constitute a sexual
advance or verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature under
Title VII'' of the Civil Rights Act, the court asked both parties.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Rosemary Barkett, who wrote the initial ruling, reminded
her colleagues Wednesday that her decision stated that
``following'' and ``staring'' are not enough to make a sexual
harassment claim.
</P>
<P>
   Wesley Parsons, a Miami lawyer representing Borden, said the
alleged behavior in the case against Borden was little more than
that. ``It's bad policy'' to allow sexual harassment cases to
proceed on that basis because ``too many disgruntled employees will
sue their bosses, saying, 'He looked at me wrong,''' Parsons said.
</P>
<P>
   But Barkett noted that, during trial, Mendoza testified that on
one occasion, Page told her, ``I'm getting fired up,'' when she
entered the office. Another time, he rubbed his hip against hers as
she stood next to a copying machine, Barkett said, citing Mendoza's
testimony. Barkett repeatedly asked Parsons whether it could be
considered sexual conduct for a man to stare up and down at a woman
and fix his gaze on her groin area, even making sniffing noises on
occasion. ``That could never be considered sexual?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   Parsons, who said Page may have suffered from allergies, told
Barkett that her question called for an answer that is ``utterly
subjective.'' He finally conceded, ``I'd say, your honor, that
you're trying to force me into a corner, and you're doing a good
job of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge Gerald Tjoflat, who joined Barkett in the initial opinion,
appeared incredulous when Parsons said that staring, following and
sniffing did not necessarily connote sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
   If a woman had to endure such behavior, Tjoflat asked,
``wouldn't you to expect her to give you a haymaker or a kick in
another area?''
</P>
<P>
   Unyielding, Parsons replied that sniffing is ``so innocuous.''
</P>
<P>
   But Tjoflat pressed on. ``He's looking at the groin and
sniffing, in this testimony. What kind of response would you expect
from a woman with any kind of dignity and self-respect? Wouldn't
you expect her to slap him?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, your honor,'' Parsons said, suggesting that the
appropriate response would be for the woman to tell the man to
stop.
</P>
<P>
   Tjoflat then shook his head, looked at Parsons and said, ``We
grew up in different times.''

NEW CONCERN ON HEALTH RISKS OF CIGARS 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A California study has found that regular cigar smoking
significantly increases risks of heart and respiratory disease and
some cancers, and raises fears that cigars and alcohol together may
be a particularly hazardous combination.
</P>
<P>
   The findings add weight to research indicating that smoking
cigars is far from safe _ something that may not be recognized by
the many who have been making cigars fashionable in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the increased health risk was found in men who smoked
five or more cigars a day. Only 17 percent of the study subjects
smoked that heavily.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thus our findings should not be generalized to people who
smoke cigars infrequently,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Most worrying of the findings is the apparent synergy between
cigar smoke and alcohol, creating higher risks than with either by
itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``The popularity of cigar bars where both cigar smoking and
alcohol consumption are encouraged arouses special concern with
respect to the public health,'' commented Dr. David Satcher, the US
surgeon general, in an editorial being published Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The study of 1,546 cigar smokers and 16,228 nonsmokers showed
that cigar smoking raised a man's risk of heart disease and certain
cancers by as much as twofold. While significant, the hazard is
much less than from cigarette smoking, which increases risks 1.5 to
3 times for coronary heart disease, 9 to 25 times for emphysema and
related lung diseases, and 8 to 24 times for lung cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Satcher, in the accompanying editorial, called for raising
federal taxes on cigars, which now are much less than for
cigarettes, and said that warning labels similar to those on
cigarette packages should be required for cigars. ``It is critical
that cigars not be construed as a safe or less costly alternative
to cigarettes,'' Satcher wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Cigar sales increased nearly 50 percent between 1993 and 1997 as
part of a trend among young and middle-aged, mainly upscale men. In
California, the percentage of men smoking cigars rose from 4.8
percent in 1990 to 8.8 percent in 1996, according to Satcher.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's report is from a study by Dr. Carlos Iribarren and
colleagues at the Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program in
Oakland, Calif. They drew their subjects from a group of 17,774
men, ages 30 to 85, who were enrolled in the health plan. None of
them had ever smoked cigarettes and did not currently smoke a pipe.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 1,546 men who smoked cigars, 76 percent smoked fewer than
five a day and 17 percent smoked more than five daily. Compared
with the men who did not smoke cigars, those who did were more
likely to be black or white and less likely to be Asian, to have no
college education, and to drink alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   After reviewing health records, the researchers concluded that
the cigar smokers, taken as a whole:
</P>
<P>
   --Had moderately higher risks for coronary heart disease and
obstructive lung diseases such as emphysema.
</P>
<P>
   --Had about twice as much risk of mouth, throat, and lung cancer
as nonsmokers.
</P>
<P>
   --Had about the same risk of cancer as nonsmokers when all
cancer types were lumped together.
</P>
<P>
   --Appeared to have greater risk of mouth and throat cancer if
they both smoked and drank three or more drinks a day than if those
two risk factors were considered alone. This pattern has been seen
in those who smoke cigarettes and drink alcohol, but had not been
reported for cigar smokers.
</P>
<P>
   However, the authors said this apparently link should be treated
cautiously because the number of such cases in the study was small.
</P>
<P>
   Cigars give off toxic smoke similar to that of cigarettes, but
more potent, say health officials. The health risks of cigarettes
are higher because the smoke is more likely to be inhaled, but
cigar smokers may not realize how much they are inhaling, said
Gregory Connolly, head of the state Tobacco Control Program in the
Department of Public Health.

 &HT;    Price-gouging discouraged as tourney nears

<TEXT>
<P>
   PINEHURST, N.C. _ Visitors to next week's U.S. Open golf
championship need to watch their wallets to make sure no hotel,
restaurant or golf course is slicing an extra deep divot out of
them.
</P>
<P>
   A night's stay in a two-bedroom suite at the Marriott Residence
Inn will cost $499, more than double the typical rate. A round of
golf at Plantation Golf Club will go for $200, an $85 premium over
the regular green fee.
</P>
<P>
   The Magnolia Inn is doubling its nightly room charge to $400.
That does include breakfast and dinner in the 1896 inn in the heart
of Pinehurst, where businesses hope to cash in on the village's
first U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   Some in this famous golf resort in North Carolina's Sandhills
fret that people will feel ripped off and won't come back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our job that week is to show the world what a wonderful
product we offer, not to gouge the world and have them go home
saying, `Isn't Pinehurst an expensive place?''' said John
McDougald, golf director of Talamore Golf Club.
</P>
<P>
   As president of the Sandhills Golf Association, which represents
12 courses and 17 hotels, McDougald is among officials urging
businesses to curb the urge to sock it to visitors.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard, though, for businesses not to get excited about the
prospect of 50,000 people _ many with plenty of money to spend _
pouring in every day. In strictly business terms, demand outstrips
supply for many services in Pinehurst and the nearby towns of
Southern Pines and Aberdeen.
</P>
<P>
   Pure Gold, an adult night club, is adding dancers and cocktail
waitresses. Hotels for miles around have been booked for a year or
more. Restaurant reservations are hard to come by.
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating waiting lines of two or three hours, Outback
Steakhouse plans to add tables on the patio and fire up grills in
the parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   Even the village of Pinehurst is getting something extra. It is
collecting $275,000 for renting approximately 150 acres for
tournament parking.
</P>
<P>
   Typically at this time of year, golf courses are charging summer
rates, among the lowest of the year. Many, however, plan to charge
the spring rate during the tournament, resulting in fees of about
30 percent higher, said Bill Tracy, who arranges Sandhills
hotel-and-golf packages.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its sharply higher green fee, the Plantation Golf Club
``has a waiting list for tee times on most days,'' golf director
Jimmy Mikol said. ``I don't think the (higher price) is going to
hurt us.''
</P>
<P>
   Some merchants are holding the line on prices, despite the bucks
that big corporations are throwing around to entertain customers at
one of America's most prestigious sporting events.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most visible signs of extravagance is a temporary
tent city, called the Corporate Hospitality Village. Erected along
the golf course where the tournament will be played, it consists of
49 big canvas tents, each renting for $125,000.
</P>
<P>
   At the Villager, a breakfast and lunch deli, owner Carol Horne
said raising prices would be unfair to locals and other regular
diners. Added her husband, Gene, ``Hopefully, a lot of people will
come back to Pinehurst, revisit Pinehurst and eventually move to
Pinehurst.''
</P>
<P>
   Even some who are charging higher fees said they're not
exploiting customers. At Magnolia Inn, where the dinner charge is
$55 for nonguests, the restaurant has incurred the expense of
buying extra china and silver to accommodate big crowds.
</P>
<P>
   ``An event like this typically costs more than you make,'' chef
Mark Elliott said.
</P>
<P>
   Inn manager Jennifer Ormond said she turned down a request by
Charlotte-based Bank of America to rent the entire 11-room inn. If
she had rented it, she said she would have been unable to
accommodate some of her regular guests who were willing to pay $400
a night.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, the get-rich frenzy swept through this village of
8,059 people. Talk began circulating that hospitality groups were
willing to pay thousands of dollars to rent peoples' homes for
business people to socialize.
</P>
<P>
   One house near Pinehurst Resort and Country Club's famed No. 2
course, the tournament site, did fetch $80,000. But the sports
management company running the tournament stuck by the United
States Golf Association's recommendation that residents charge a
weekly rate of $1,500 to $2,000 per bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Swindon, accommodations manager for Pinehurst
Championship Management, said his office rented about 200 houses
within those guidelines. He said he turned down another 500
homeowners. Swindon estimated that property owners and managers
rented another 100 private residences on their own.
</P>
<P>
   When he began looking for ``affordable housing'' in March,
Atlantan Glen Harris settled on Pine Lake RV Resort. He and his
three friends will each pay $150 for four nights in a trailer.
</P>
<P>
   With plans to play four rounds of golf and watch the tournament,
Harris figures his group will be tired at night. He hopes that will
make the modest sleeping arrangements more acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   ``With our eyes closed and it being dark, what difference does
it make?'' Harris said.

TROUBLING DETAILS EMERGE ABOUT SLAIN COMEDIAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ On Monday, when Mexican comedian Francisco
``Paco'' Stanley was gunned down in broad daylight on the street,
there was all-out rage.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, when his gray casket was lifted from a flower-strewn
hearse, carried passed teary mobs and placed in the family's
mausoleum, there were wails of grief and the mournful strum of
mariachi guitars.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, as shadowy details of Stanley's private life began
to emerge _ including signs of cocaine paraphernalia in his car,
cocaine in his bloodstream, and alleged links to drug kings _ many
Mexicans coped with the news by reverting back to the cynicism that
has hardened their views of life in one of the world's most
dangerous places.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed, but not really surprised,'' said Gabriela
Lozano, a 22-year-old college student, said Wednesday while sitting
in a park with three friends. ``It didn't seem like something by
chance. From the beginning there was something strange about it.''
</P>
<P>
   There are no suspects yet and police say they have few leads,
but plenty of troubling details have emerged about the popular
56-year-old entertainer, who was killed outside a Mexico City
restaurant in an attack that police said appeared planned.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators confirmed that cocaine was found in Stanley's
blood, and that small packets of the drug as well as a small mortar
and grinding pestle were recovered around Stanley's body, which was
found slumped in the front passenger seat of his Lincoln sport
utility vehicle. A bystander was also killed.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, several Mexican newspapers published reports quoting
Mexican and US narcotics intelligence sources linking Stanley to
one of Mexico's most notorious drug figures, Amado Carrillo
Fuentes, saying the comedian received lavish gifts from the leader
of the Juarez cartel before Carrillo Fuentes's death in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The sources also noted that the method of the slaying _ a flurry
of more than two-dozen bullets shot at close range _ was similar to
killings carried out by a rival drug cartel run by Benjamin
Arellano Felix.
</P>
<P>
   The disclosures seemed to dampen the anger that swept across the
country on Monday, when citizens, among them network anchors, cried
out for an end to Mexico's nearly five-year-old crime wave and
demanded that authorities resign their posts for failing to stop
it.
</P>
<P>
   But not even the disappointment in learning the sordid details
of a slain star can douse people's sense of frustration that comes
with feeling that their lives are constantly in danger, said one
psychologist.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that most crime against ordinary people is random, so
we get tired of constantly being on our guard,'' said Sylvia
Aguinilla, a therapist who specializes in family counseling.
``Meanwhile, the sensational crimes against celebrities stay in our
memories and add to our insecurities.''
</P>
<P>
   Government officials defend their work by noting that
statistically crime is down compared to last year in several
categories in this metropolis of 20 million residents. But a poll
published Wednesday by the daily Reforma showed that half of the
respondents still feel powerless and unsafe.
</P>
<P>
   Another item found on Stanley's possession _ an Interior
Ministry ID card identifying him as a government security agent _
underlined many Mexicans' desire to seek as much protection as they
can from lawless elements.
</P>
<P>
   The Stanley drama has also produced an unusual backlash against
the country's two television networks. Politicians on Wednesday
accused Televisa and TV Azteca of unfairly blaming them for
Stanley's death.
</P>
<P>
   Only days before the shooting, TV Azteca celebrated the first
anniversary of its renowned anti-drug campaign on a prime time
program featuring Stanley, who exhorted viewers not to take drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Both Televisa and Azteca, which devoted hours of live coverage
on Monday and Tuesday, have mentioned little about the medical
examiner's results and even less about the newspaper reports
alleging Stanley's connections to organized crime.

 &HT;    Price-gouging discouraged as tourney nears

<P>
   PINEHURST, N.C. _ Visitors to next week's U.S. Open golf
championship need to watch their wallets to make sure no hotel,
restaurant or golf course is slicing an extra deep divot out of
them.
</P>
<P>
   A night's stay in a two-bedroom suite at the Marriott Residence
Inn will cost $499, more than double the typical rate. A round of
golf at Plantation Golf Club will go for $200, an $85 premium over
the regular green fee.
</P>
<P>
   The Magnolia Inn is doubling its nightly room charge to $400.
That does include breakfast and dinner in the 1896 inn in the heart
of Pinehurst, where businesses hope to cash in on the village's
first U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   Some in this famous golf resort in North Carolina's Sandhills
fret that people will feel ripped off and won't come back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our job that week is to show the world what a wonderful
product we offer, not to gouge the world and have them go home
saying, `Isn't Pinehurst an expensive place?''' said John
McDougald, golf director of Talamore Golf Club.
</P>
<P>
   As president of the Sandhills Golf Association, which represents
12 courses and 17 hotels, McDougald is among officials urging
businesses to curb the urge to sock it to visitors.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard, though, for businesses not to get excited about the
prospect of 50,000 people _ many with plenty of money to spend _
pouring in every day. In strictly business terms, demand outstrips
supply for many services in Pinehurst and the nearby towns of
Southern Pines and Aberdeen.
</P>
<P>
   Pure Gold, an adult night club, is adding dancers and cocktail
waitresses. Hotels for miles around have been booked for a year or
more. Restaurant reservations are hard to come by.
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating waiting lines of two or three hours, Outback
Steakhouse plans to add tables on the patio and fire up grills in
the parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   Even the village of Pinehurst is getting something extra. It is
collecting $275,000 for renting approximately 150 acres for
tournament parking.
</P>
<P>
   Typically at this time of year, golf courses are charging summer
rates, among the lowest of the year. Many, however, plan to charge
the spring rate during the tournament, resulting in fees of about
30 percent higher, said Bill Tracy, who arranges Sandhills
hotel-and-golf packages.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its sharply higher green fee, the Plantation Golf Club
``has a waiting list for tee times on most days,'' golf director
Jimmy Mikol said. ``I don't think the (higher price) is going to
hurt us.''
</P>
<P>
   Some merchants are holding the line on prices, despite the bucks
that big corporations are throwing around to entertain customers at
one of America's most prestigious sporting events.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most visible signs of extravagance is a temporary
tent city, called the Corporate Hospitality Village. Erected along
the golf course where the tournament will be played, it consists of
49 big canvas tents, each renting for $125,000.

COMMENTARY: CHILDREN IN CRISIS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By BOB HERBERT    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If you want to see something shaky, take a look at
the health of the homeless kids in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The homeless got a lot of air time in the '80s, but that's over.
The mask of the triumphant suburbanite is the face of the '90s, and
poverty is no longer discussed in polite company.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton and Rudolph Giuliani dumped the slackers off the
welfare rolls and a nation applauded. Forget about the effect on
kids. We learned in Littleton, if we hadn't realized it before,
that our concern with children depends largely on where and what
color they are.
</P>
<P>
   There remain, however, in this dismal and cynical environment,
some remarkable individuals who insist on donning unfashionable
trunks and swimming upstream. Dr. Irwin Redlener, the president of
the Children's Hospital at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx,
is one of them. In addition to his position at the hospital,
Redlener is president of the Children's Health Fund, a nonprofit
group that provides desperately needed pediatric services to
homeless children.
</P>
<P>
   He is releasing a report on Thursday that tells us a lot of
those kids are in trouble medically, and not nearly enough people
are paying attention. The report is called ``Still in Crisis: The
Health Status of New York's Homeless children.''
</P>
<P>
   The most serious problem is the asthma that is rampant among
homeless children. An astonishing 38 percent of the more than 8,000
kids in the city's shelter system have asthma. Redlener said that
was ``the highest prevalence of asthma in any child population
that's ever been reported.''
</P>
<P>
   He said, ``This worries me a great deal, because asthma is,
first of all, life-threatening for children. But besides that, even
in its milder forms, it fits into the category of chronic
conditions that adversely affect the ability of a child to function
in school.''
</P>
<P>
   What is particularly frustrating, said Redlener, is that the
severe distress encountered by homeless children with asthma is
almost entirely unnecessary. ``Asthma is eminently treatable,'' he
said. ``The reality of the new protocols for asthma treatment mean
_ and I am not overstating this _ we should accept no missed school
days because of asthma, no staying up all night and coughing, and
no missed physical activities.''
</P>
<P>
   But connecting homeless children to the proper medical protocols
is extremely difficult. Just keeping track of the kids is
difficult. The report makes clear that the ``real'' problem for
such children is their lack of access ``to vital preventive care
and the management of chronic conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   In the chaos of homelessness, small problems are always in
danger of spiraling out of control. Ear infections are a common
childhood ailment. They are more prevalent among homeless kids than
the general childhood population. The report notes that a simple
ear infection, if not treated properly, ``can lead to hearing loss
and less than optimum speech development resulting from an
inability to hear sounds clearly.''
</P>
<P>
   A homeless kid who goes off to school with an undiagnosed
hearing disorder has been exquisitely prepared to drown
academically.
</P>
<P>
   The report found that more than 60 percent of 2- and 3-year-old
children in the shelter system had not been properly immunized
against measles, mumps, whooping cough or a range of other
preventable diseases. And Redlener mentioned that many of the
children were suffering from the severe stress that so often
accompanies the unrelieved chaos of homelessness.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are frightened,'' he said. ``They live in a very unstable
environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Redlener is upset by the extent to which poor children languish,
neglected and vulnerable, in the shadows of American life. ``I've
been at this for 30 years now, dealing with underserved children,''
he said. ``I find myself very frustrated and distressed. The safety
net that's really supposed to be in place from the public sector _
from government _ is very much failing our children.''
</P>
<P>
   A new and more creative look at this old problem is required, he
said. And if government is unwilling to fulfill its role, then
other, less traditional sources of help will have to be found.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to re-energize this notion of needing to take care of
those who are most vulnerable in our society,'' he said.

   &UR; GOOD GUYS STAY TO BURY THE DOG &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; Just before a recent New Hampshire kaffeeklatsch for
Representative  &UR; John Kasich &LR; , R-Ohio, a would-be presidential
contender, hostess  &UR; Linda Kaiser &LR;  realized that she was short on
ice. When she jumped into her car and backed down the driveway, she
hit and killed her 13-year-old family dog.
</P>
<P>
   When the candidate heard about the accident, he offered to
cancel the coffee, but Kaiser insisted on going ahead.
</P>
<P>
   And when the event was over, he insisted on helping to bury the
dog. ``He said, `If I ever told my wife I left without burying this
dog, we'd be divorced. Get a shovel,''' Kaiser told the Manchester
Union Leader.
</P>
<P>
   The candidate had ``revealed himself as a real person,'' said
Kaiser. ``I can't imagine  &UR; Elizabeth Dole &LR;  or  &UR; George W. Bush &LR; 
burying my dog.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHAT THEY'RE WEARING &LR;
</P>
<P>
   - Major League Baseball Barbie, to go on sale in a week, will
wear the home uniform of the Los Angeles Dodgers, Chicago Cubs or
New York Yankees. Each outfit will include authentic logo, pants,
jersey, cap, jacket and shoes, and each package will include a
miniature glove, ball and wooden bat.
</P>
<P>
   In another Barbie developments &LR; , Mattel has announced that it
has taken ``Butterfly Art Barbie'' _ with its giant midriff tattoo
_ off the market. ``We've just had some consumers who didn't like
it,'' said  &UR; Lisa McKendall &LR;  of Mattel.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; - Tom Ed McHugh &LR; , the mayor of Baton Rouge, La., has declared
June 1 through September 6 Casual Summer. Workers are encouraged to
forgo suits and formal dresses in favor of khakis, golf shirts and
summery frocks (sounds like the men get a better deal).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; - Elizabeth Emanuel &LR; , who designed  &UR; Princess Diana &LR; 's wedding
dress, is bankrupt, and lawyers for her creditors are asking that
scraps from the dress _ found in a trunk _ be auctioned to pay them
off.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a terrible situation,'' Emanuel told the Sunday Times of
London. ``The trustee is telling me how much the auction house is
dribbling at the thought of selling this. Everyone is drooling over
it _ it makes me sick.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FLASH &LR;
</P>
<P>
   -  &UR; Bianca Jagger &LR;  is so angry about a Talk of the Town piece in
last week's New Yorker that described her as ``the  &UR; Rodney &LR; 
 &UR; Dangerfield &LR;  of philanthropists,'' sincere but not always perfectly
informed, that she is threatening to sue. MSNBC quotes a letter to
the magazine in which Jagger called the story defamatory and
accused its writer of taking ``the misogynist view that a woman's
work cannot be judged on its own merit.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; - Adrian Perry &LR; , 18-year-old son of Aerosmith guitarist  &UR; Joe &LR; 
 &UR; Perry &LR; , starts at Stanford in the fall. Papa Perry told the Boston
Herald that Adrian wants to be a lawyer, ``and if there's one thing
I found out, it's that one of the most important things to have in
this business is a good lawyer.''
</P>
<P>
   -  &UR; Deborah Kwan &LR;  was delighted by New York Times restaurant
reviewer  &UR; William Grimes &LR; ' description of a ``hypertrained''
waiter, ``late 20th century model,'' who told him of the scallops
being served: ``They are harvested by divers. Most scallops are
machine-harvested, which traumatizes them.''
</P>
<P>
   - Celebrity biographer  &UR; Kitty Kelley &LR;  was at a state dinner for
the president of Hungary the other night. The Washington Post
suggested that the  &UR; Clinton &LR; s may have wanted to make nice to
Kelley, author of a notoriously nasty biography of  &UR; Nancy Reagan &LR; ,
to head off any notions of writing about would-be New Yorker
 &UR; Hillary &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ELEMENTARY IDEAS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In response to yesterday's call for name suggestions for
Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory's new elements 116 and 118:
</P>
<P>
   Pac Bellium and 3-Comium ( &UR; Jim Schock &LR; ); millennium ( &UR; Roger &LR; 
 &UR; Estrella &LR; ); ellingtonium ( &UR; John Hules &LR; , in honor of the composer's
centenary); linoleum ( &UR; David Mostardi &LR; ); intelligencium and
attentionspanium ( &UR; Paul Sullam &LR; , keeping in mind the elements'
short half-lives); Dumbo ( &UR; Bob Wieder &LR; , who got through chemistry
thinking an element was a four-legged animal with a trunk). More to
come, and the suggestion box is still open.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHO SAID WHAT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``(Madonna) probably hates my guts. But I hope not, because I'm
a big fan.''
</P>
<P>
   -  &UR; Salma Hayek &LR;  telling Glamour magazine about developing a
movie about Frida Kahlo, in which she'll star.  &UR; Madonna &LR; 's plans to
play the celebrated Mexican artist fell through.

   DRUGS-TREATMENT (Phoenix, Ariz.) _ A dozen years after the
national alarm over crack speeded the discarding of drug treatment

   &UR; GOOD GUYS STAY TO BURY THE DOG &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; Just before a recent New Hampshire kaffeeklatsch for
Representative  &UR; John Kasich &LR; , R-Ohio, a would-be presidential
contender, hostess  &UR; Linda Kaiser &LR;  realized that she was short on
ice. When she jumped into her car and backed down the driveway, she
hit and killed her 13-year-old family dog.
</P>
<P>
   When the candidate heard about the accident, he offered to
cancel the coffee, but Kaiser insisted on going ahead.
</P>
<P>
   And when the event was over, he insisted on helping to bury the
dog. ``He said, `If I ever told my wife I left without burying this
dog, we'd be divorced. Get a shovel,''' Kaiser told the Manchester
Union Leader.
</P>
<P>
   The candidate had ``revealed himself as a real person,'' said
Kaiser. ``I can't imagine  &UR; Elizabeth Dole &LR;  or  &UR; George W. Bush &LR; 
burying my dog.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHAT THEY'RE WEARING &LR;
</P>
<P>
   - Major League Baseball Barbie, to go on sale in a week, will
wear the home uniform of the Los Angeles Dodgers, Chicago Cubs or
New York Yankees. Each outfit will include authentic logo, pants,
jersey, cap, jacket and shoes, and each package will include a
miniature glove, ball and wooden bat.
</P>
<P>
   In another Barbie developments &LR; , Mattel has announced that it
has taken ``Butterfly Art Barbie'' _ with its giant midriff tattoo
_ off the market. ``We've just had some consumers who didn't like
it,'' said  &UR; Lisa McKendall &LR;  of Mattel.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; - Tom Ed McHugh &LR; , the mayor of Baton Rouge, La., has declared
June 1 through September 6 Casual Summer. Workers are encouraged to
forgo suits and formal dresses in favor of khakis, golf shirts and
summery frocks (sounds like the men get a better deal).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; - Elizabeth Emanuel &LR; , who designed  &UR; Princess Diana &LR; 's wedding
dress, is bankrupt, and lawyers for her creditors are asking that
scraps from the dress _ found in a trunk _ be auctioned to pay them
off.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a terrible situation,'' Emanuel told the Sunday Times of
London. ``The trustee is telling me how much the auction house is
dribbling at the thought of selling this. Everyone is drooling over
it _ it makes me sick.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FLASH &LR;
</P>
<P>
   -  &UR; Bianca Jagger &LR;  is so angry about a Talk of the Town piece in
last week's New Yorker that described her as ``the  &UR; Rodney &LR; 
 &UR; Dangerfield &LR;  of philanthropists,'' sincere but not always perfectly
informed, that she is threatening to sue. MSNBC quotes a letter to
the magazine in which Jagger called the story defamatory and
accused its writer of taking ``the misogynist view that a woman's
work cannot be judged on its own merit.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; - Adrian Perry &LR; , 18-year-old son of Aerosmith guitarist  &UR; Joe &LR; 
 &UR; Perry &LR; , starts at Stanford in the fall. Papa Perry told the Boston
Herald that Adrian wants to be a lawyer, ``and if there's one thing
I found out, it's that one of the most important things to have in
this business is a good lawyer.''
</P>
<P>
   -  &UR; Deborah Kwan &LR;  was delighted by New York Times restaurant
reviewer  &UR; William Grimes &LR; ' description of a ``hypertrained''
waiter, ``late 20th century model,'' who told him of the scallops
being served: ``They are harvested by divers. Most scallops are
machine-harvested, which traumatizes them.''
</P>
<P>
   - Celebrity biographer  &UR; Kitty Kelley &LR;  was at a state dinner for
the president of Hungary the other night. The Washington Post
suggested that the  &UR; Clinton &LR; s may have wanted to make nice to
Kelley, author of a notoriously nasty biography of  &UR; Nancy Reagan &LR; ,
to head off any notions of writing about would-be New Yorker
 &UR; Hillary &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ELEMENTARY IDEAS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In response to yesterday's call for name suggestions for
Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory's new elements 116 and 118:
</P>
<P>
   Pac Bellium and 3-Comium ( &UR; Jim Schock &LR; ); millennium ( &UR; Roger &LR; 
 &UR; Estrella &LR; ); ellingtonium ( &UR; John Hules &LR; , in honor of the composer's
centenary); linoleum ( &UR; David Mostardi &LR; ); intelligencium and
attentionspanium ( &UR; Paul Sullam &LR; , keeping in mind the elements'
short half-lives); Dumbo ( &UR; Bob Wieder &LR; , who got through chemistry
thinking an element was a four-legged animal with a trunk). More to
come, and the suggestion box is still open.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHO SAID WHAT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``(Madonna) probably hates my guts. But I hope not, because I'm
a big fan.''
</P>
<P>
   -  &UR; Salma Hayek &LR;  telling Glamour magazine about developing a
movie about Frida Kahlo, in which she'll star.  &UR; Madonna &LR; 's plans to
play the celebrated Mexican artist fell through.

COMMENTARY: AN APPEAL FOR REPEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Amendment II: A well-regulated militia being necessary to the
security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear
Arms shall not be infringed.  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Twenty years ago, I asked Richard Nixon what he
thought of gun control. His on-the-record reply: ``Guns are an
abomination.'' Free from fear of gun owners' retaliation at the
polls, he favored making handguns illegal and requiring licenses
for hunting rifles.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, when ABC's Charles Gibson asked Bill Clinton why he
was supporting only niminy-piminy restrictions on guns, our current
president, also with the freedom of a lame duck, replied testily:
``Should people have to register guns like they register their
cars? Do I think that? Of course I do.'' He didn't propose it only
because Congress was opposed.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of the nation may well share the revulsion at
firearms expressed by these two quite different presidents. That is
why Congress, using the loophole of protecting minors, is nibbling
nervously at the fringes of gun control. We'll get trigger locks
and a delay of sales at gun shows; big deal.
</P>
<P>
   Why not bite the bullet? Wouldn't it be better to frame the
argument in plain, stark terms?
</P>
<P>
   Believers in unrestricted purchase and ownership of guns claim a
personal right guaranteed under the Bill of Rights' Amendment II.
They say the people's right ``to keep and bear Arms'' means exactly
what it says.
</P>
<P>
   Believers in gun control insist that the Founders wanted to
insure that the states forming the federal compact had the right to
have militias, which each state would regulate; thus could Virginia
put down a slave rebellion. They argue that the Second Amendment
did not confer any right of an individual to carry a weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Who's right? Or, whose right _ is it the state's or the
individual's? Until recently, advocates of gun control have argued
successfully that the right belongs to the state, not the private
person.
</P>
<P>
   But that has recently been successfully challenged. A federal
court in Texas held that individuals have at least some rights to
weapons. The appeals will probably put the argument before the
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a lay-down hand for the anti-gun lobby. For years,
principled liberals have had qualms about the way the Second has
been treated as a quaint archaism to be ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Laurence H. Tribe, Harvard's guru of constitutional
law who supports gun control and would surely be on the high court
if liberals had their way, told The Times this week: ``It becomes
impossible to deny that some right to bear arms is among the rights
of American citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to elucidate, Tribe tells me: ``The debate has been cast
in a misleading, dichotomous way between those who cast the Second
Amendment as completely irrelevant to any claim of individual right
and those who treat it as . . . essentially stripping the
government of the power to impose reasonable limits to protect
public safety. That's a false statement of choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Comes now the emergence of a constitutional middle ground. The
Murky Second is thus interpreted as a state right sometimes and as
an individual right at other times. One day it's James Madison, the
next day it's Madison James.
</P>
<P>
   That can't be right. Put another way, a right that is sometimes
not a right is no right at all. After doing a great job on the
First Amendment, the amending Founders botched the Second.
</P>
<P>
   The intellectually lazy will say, ``Let the Supremes sort it
out.'' I say, let the people decide a political issue. Either we're
serious about our right to gun ownership or we're serious about our
need for gun control.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how to fix a flawed amendment that is the source of so
much confusion: Repeal its ambiguous preamble. Let some member of
Congress introduce an amendment to strike the words before the
comma in the Second Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Then vote the amendment up or down. If it fails to pass, stop
arguing and compromise on nibbling. If Congress passes repeal, let
ratification be fought out in the states, where representatives
closest to the people can decide on strict licensing.
</P>
<P>
   That's the decisive, constitutional way to come to grips with
the abomination of too many handguns in trigger-happy hands.

BUSH (Phoenix) - Two weeks ago Congressman Matt Salmon made a
pilgrimage to Austin Texas, where he sipped tea with Texas Gov.
George Bush and asked the presidential candidate a simple question:
Would the front-runner make a stand in the state of Arizona? Bush,
in an attempt to put to rest rumors that he was ceding the state to
John McCain, said yes. By KRIS MAYES. Story will move in the ``A''

MOVIES (Phoenix) - There is a lack of good alternatives to R-rated
movies for teens, and many of the alternatives are flops at the box
office. Why? These R-rated movies are marketed to teens. The
movie's success depends on this market. And even if they stayed
home from the movie and watched the WB instead, they'd still see
sex and violence. Even teen magazines are chock full of ads for
sex. We'll also mention that parents take their kids to the r-rated
movies anyway. Call that the moral decline of America. By JAIMEE

NOTARO-COLUMN (Phoenix) - I was biting into the best tortilla of my
life at my favorite Mexican restaurant in Los Angeles when I saw
her. Sitting at the next table behind my friend Jeff's head, there
she was. My eighth-grade math teacher. I couldn't mistake her still
jet-black hair, the soft curve of her almond-shaped eyes and her
thin, pursed lips. It was her, all right. By LAURI NOTARO. Story

 &HT;    Speedup in primaries raises stakes in state straw polls
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The nominating process for the 2000 presidential
election, already speeded up beyond any comparison with previous
election years, has come a-tumbling in the past few days _ perhaps
all the way back to 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The New Hampshire House voted 29-5 Wednesday to eliminate the
requirement that its primary be held in the presidential election
year, giving the New Hampshire secretary of state the power to set
the date as early as December.
</P>
<P>
   That unprecedented move followed the decision by the South
Carolina Republican Party late last week to hold its primary on
Saturday, Feb. 19. That change in turn was a reaction to Michigan's
decision to move its primary up to Feb. 22, and by Virginia's move
to Feb. 29.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire may not opt to move all the way back into '99, but
it's almost certain to schedule its primary no later than Feb. 8.
And since the Iowa Caucuses are currently set for Feb. 9, there
will probably be another round of changes in the election calendar.
</P>
<P>
   The traditional early states are racing to stay ahead of the
pack, but at this rate, they'll have to vote before the current
heat wave breaks to ensure their lead. Pundits take comforting
assurance in the words, ``It's too early to tell,'' which in the
past always had the ring of wisdom about them. This time, however,
``too early to tell'' will be Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   It would seem that these developments can only give a greater
advantage to the usual suspects, Texas Gov. George W. Bush and Vice
President Al Gore. With the accelerated schedule, the ability to
raise a lot of money this year and set up effective organizations
in the key states becomes even more important.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a money and endorsements and team-talent primary that
precedes the firing of the first gun,'' said Ralph Reed, the former
Christian Coalition leader who now is working for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The politically dubious arena of state party straw polls will be
where much of this early contest will be fought out. This year,
they are earlier and more numerous than ever. Iowa, mirroring its
first-in-the-nation (until now) caucuses, will hold the first GOP
straw poll Aug. 14. The Alabama Republicans have just scheduled one
on Aug. 28.
</P>
<P>
   Other than Bush, the only Republican likely to benefit from the
speed-up is Steve Forbes, simply because he doesn't have to raise
money and is already on the air and in newspapers with campaign
ads. But this was scant comfort to Rusty Paul, Forbes' Southern
political director.
</P>
<P>
   ``While it probably helps my guy somewhat, it's still a heck of
a way to pick the leader of the free world,'' Paul said Wednesday.
Paul, the former Georgia GOP chairman, said he would even favor
Congress stepping in at this stage to stop the states from
``running amok.''
</P>
<P>
   Lest anyone think this means the race is over, there was another
piece of political news Wednesday. Bush, in a letter to Grover
Norquist, head of Americans for Tax Reform, pledged he would
``oppose and veto'' any income tax increases as president.
</P>
<P>
   What could have prompted him, leading the pack by a mile or two,
to sign a letter that brings back to mind the ``read my lips''
pledge that was so instrumental in his father's defeat in 1992?
Maybe there's time left for a race, after all.

<P>
   KOSOVO-RDP (Kumanovo, Macedonia) _ The Yugoslav military accedes
to an agreement that will permit a military force commanded by a
NATO general with sweeping powers to occupy Kosovo, clearing the
way to an end of the war. With the agreement, signed at a French
helicopter base not far from the border of the province prized by
the Serbs for centuries as their Jerusalem, NATO's political
leaders gave the alliance's Secretary General, Javier Solana, the
authority to suspend the bombing once the military verifies that
the Serbian-dominated Army, police and paramilitary units begin to
withdraw from Kosovo. By Steven Lee Myers.

   KOSOVO-SCENE (LAPUSNIK, Kosovo) _ Talking with Serbian soldiers:
In this blasted, burned-out village, where Serbian soldiers keep
guard from inside destroyed Albanian houses and shops, Todor, a
volunteer, wondered today whether the outcome was worth the price,
to his own comrades and to the Albanians of this southern Serbian
province. ``I'm angry about how it's ending,'' he said, rubbing his
hand along his dirty blond beard. ``This should have been done
better. A lot of people have died for nothing. And I believe that
in four or five years, no Serb will still be living in Kosovo.'' By
Steven Erlanger.

   KOSOVO-REFUGEES (Kukes, Albania) _ There may be a relative peace
on the horizon in the Balkans, but the 120,000 an refugees who have
staggered across the border into this hot, dusty and rubble-strewn
mountain town are still anxious about how they will ever safely go
home again. By Elizabeth Bumiller.

political settlement fell slowly into place, as if in stop-action
photography, the domestic political impact of the fighting in the

   WASHINGTON _ Six weeks ago, as NATO leaders met in Washington,
commentators and White House officials described the war in Kosovo
as big casino for Bill Clinton _ the pivotal moment of his
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, as the pieces of a political settlement fell
slowly into place, as if in stop-action photography, the domestic
political impact of the fighting in the Balkans seems sure to be
less dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   A defeat or a quagmire might well have damaged Clinton's
reputation severely; his poll ratings had begun to sag, slowly but
surely, when no end to the conflict could be discerned.
</P>
<P>
   But a victory, if that is the right word for the outcome of a
war that nobody really won, appears unlikely to improve the
president's standing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Success, such as it is, will not fundamentally reshape
people's views of Bill Clinton,'' said Andrew Kohut of the Pew
Research Center, a polling organization. ``Americans saw this war
as an important event, and they think the president did the right
thing morally. But they never thought our national interests were
at stake, as they thought they were during the Gulf War.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Hess, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who
has been watching presidents for decades, said in April, ``Kosovo
and the Balkans will consume his presidency.'' He revised that
opinion Wednesday, conceding that ``things undoubtedly changed.''
</P>
<P>
   The president, Hess said, ``did lose that small window of
opportunity with the Republicans in Congress right after the
impeachment trial, when they might have agreed on a small
domestic-policy agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But that was never central,'' he continued, ``and it's clear
now that this will not be a defining event. The sand is running out
of the hourglass, his term is coming to an end, and I doubt that
we'll see any great change in his legacy over the next 18 months.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, that will be up to the historians to decide. They
are still arguing over the accomplishments of James K. Polk. But in
the near term, the president will gain few points with voters or
with Congress, where many members already regard him as a figure
whose powers decline with each day. Relative success in Kosovo,
even substantial success, will not change that.
</P>
<P>
   There appears to be no sense of elation, either in Washington or
elsewhere in the country, that the Kosovo bombing is coming to an
end. It is not yet clear how many refugees will be resettled in
Kosovo, at what cost, for how long, with what degree of safety.
Keeping 7,000 American troops in Kosovo and helping to rebuild the
Balkans could cost the United States $15 billion.
</P>
<P>
   And there is no telling how long the force will have to stay to
keep the Kosovo Albanians and the Serbs from each others' throats.
Clinton promised that the American military would be out of Bosnia
in a year; troops have been there three and a half years, and they
are not about to leave soon.
</P>
<P>
   Even a relatively clear-cut victory, of course, carries no
guarantee of immediate political benefit. President Bush, the
victor of the Gulf War, went down to defeat by Clinton not too long
thereafter, as public attention swung from foreign policy to
domestic economic problems.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Vice President Al Gore appears to be one of the
beneficiaries of the evolving settlement. It would have been
difficult for a man so closely identified with Clinton and his
policies to campaign in the midst of a war that dragged on and on.
The example of Hubert H. Humphrey in the campaign of 1968, during
the Vietnam stalemate, has been much on his mind.
</P>
<P>
   For Clinton, the war provided a welcome distraction from his
impeachment trial, a chance to take the offensive as commander in
chief after having been on the defensive so long as an admitted
philanderer and accused of perjury.
</P>
<P>
   The irony, of course, is that his approval ratings went up while
he was on trial, and fell slightly, from about 61 percent to about
53 percent in some polls, during the war. A Washington Post/ABC
News poll taken last week, while peace talks were going on, found
the country roughly evenly divided on whether it had been wise for
the United States to get involved in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Although Clinton himself never went all out to identify his
presidency with the Balkans, he came close, especially in a speech
in April to the American Society of Newspaper Editors. On that
occasion, he said NATO was engaged in ``a great battle between the
forces of integration and the forces of disintegration, the forces
of globalism versus tribalism, of oppression against empowerment.''
He warned that the road ahead could be long and hard.
</P>
<P>
   He did not hammer away at that theme, however, like his British
counterpart, Prime Minister Tony Blair, who talked constantly about
Kosovo and its importance, both on national television and in
Parliament. Blair also took a firm policy line from the beginning,
arguing publicly and privately that the alliance must at least
consider the use of ground troops to keep the pressure on President
Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder of Germany, a Social Democrat, and
his foreign minister, Joschka Fischer, a member of the Green Party,
also took strong public stands, despite opposition from some
elements within their parties.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was proven right, at least within the domestic political
context. His advisers told him that as long as he did not commit
ground troops and as long as there were no significant casualties
among air crews, he could do as he thought best without fearing a
backlash at home. As one aide put it, ``We thought we had enough
support in the country and on the Hill to keep at it for a long
time, as long as we didn't cross those lines.''
</P>
<P>
   What in fact happened, Hess argued, is that people lost
interest. Hess kept a tally of the number of minutes each week the
three main broadcast networks devoted to Kosovo. At the end of
April and beginning of May, the total was 215 minutes. Then it
fell, to 180, to 63, and finally, when he stopped keep track in
mid-May, it reached a low of 55 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   One of the few things that caused an uptick was the accidental
bombing of the Chinese embassy, which may have suggested to some
people that vital American interests were indeed becoming involved
in the Balkan fighting.

the triple slaying in the Mount Baker neighborhood. There's no

<P>
   PHOENIX _ A thief, a burglar, a gang member, a drug dealer and a
mother stepped into a windowless, brick-walled room here one recent
afternoon, stripped of their pride and any material possession that
made them somebody outside that room.
</P>
<P>
   They were drug addicts in treatment, and each of them might well
have been in prison under federal law and the statutes of most
other states. But in defiance of Arizona's political establishment,
voters took the law into their own hands and voted twice, by large
majorities, to make their state the first to mandate treatment
instead of prison for criminal offenders whose primary legal
problem is drug use.
</P>
<P>
   So five people sat in that ground-floor room, talking about how
tough it was to keep away from the pills, powder and smoke that
formerly dominated their lives. Several had been heavy users of
crack cocaine, once characterized as so addictive that its users
were beyond help. Each of the five has tested clean for drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe me, this is harder than jail,'' said Albert Delatorre,
the former gang member who would have faced up to five years in
prison before the new law mandated treatment. ``It's been a
struggle. But treatment has helped me become a man. I've grown
up.'' He is 22.
</P>
<P>
   A dozen years after the national alarm over crack hastened the
decline of drug treatment in favor of punitive laws that helped
create the world's largest prison system, anti-drug policy is
taking another turn. Treatment is making a comeback, driven largely
by a grass-roots revolt.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona has taken the boldest step, but at least 40 states have
set up drug courts to steer offenders toward treatment instead of
jail. A number of states are considering changing their mandatory
prison laws for drug offenders, most notably New York, which was
the first to require long sentences for possession of small amounts
of drugs 26 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In the crack years of the 1980s, treatment programs were gutted
while the drug-fighting budget quadrupled. News reports said crack
was the most addictive substance known to man, and prisons started
to fill with people who once might have gotten help instead. The
number of Americans locked up on drug offenses grew from 50,000 in
1980 to 400,000 today.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even during the height of the prison boom, when some people
were sentenced to life behind bars for possessing small amounts of
a drug, a number of treatment centers continued to have success.
</P>
<P>
   While not all addicts respond to treatment _ some studies show
that a majority fail, usually in the first month _ these programs
showed that crack was less addictive than some other street drugs,
or even nicotine, and that many of its users responded to
conventional group therapy. Habitual users of crack, according to a
five-year federal survey of treatment published last year, showed
greater success at staying clean than alcoholics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was simply nonsense, this notion that crack addicts were
untreatable,'' said Dr. Mitchell Rosenthal, the president of
Phoenix House of New York, the nation's largest private, nonprofit
drug treatment institution, which has worked with more than 75,000
addicts over the last 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the experts who called crack the worst drug of all have
done an about face.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've changed my view because of the data that has come in over
the last 10 years,'' said Dr. Charles O'Brien, chief of psychiatry
at the Veterans Administration Medical Center in Philadelphia, who
in the late '80s described crack as ``by far, the most addictive
drug we've ever had to deal with.''
</P>
<P>
   What changed his mind were national surveys that showed 84
percent of people who tried cocaine _ either smoking it as crack or
inhaling it in powder form _ did not become addicted. He said he
had also been swayed by a study he co-wrote of habitual users of
crack who were assigned to treatment. A year after treatment, at
least half tested free of drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It turns out that many people can, and do, stop using crack _
even those who were addicted to it,'' O'Brien said.
</P>
<P>
   THE IMPETUS: From the Voters, A New Mandate
</P>
<P>
   Locking up crack users is still the policy in the federal
system. A person caught with 5 grams of crack _ worth about $125 on
the street _ and prosecuted under federal drug laws faces a
mandatory five years in prison if convicted. Crack is the only drug
that carries a mandatory prison term for possession.
</P>
<P>
   But in Arizona, because of a voter initiative, the same crack
user prosecuted under state laws cannot be sent to prison. Instead,
he must undergo drug treatment. The money for treatment comes from
the offenders themselves and from a tax on liquor.
</P>
<P>
   Many states have adopted similar policies by establishing drug
courts, which sentence people to treatment as a way to keep them
out of jail. Started in Miami by judges and prosecutors frustrated
by the conveyer-belt justice of the war on drugs, these courts have
grown from a handful at the start of the decade to nearly 600
nationwide. More than 90,000 people have been sent to treatment
through drug courts.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, even some of the most punitive states have
turned away from imprisoning all drug offenders. The Legislature in
Washington, a state that helped start the policy of life in prison
after three convictions, recently passed, 97-0, a bill that would
give judges discretion to send addicts to treatment instead of
jail.
</P>
<P>
   Louisiana, which trails only Texas in the percentage of its
population in prison, has embarked on an ambitious drug court
program, led by prosecutors and judges who say their jails can take
no more people whose only crime is drug use.

CLINTON BLASTS GOP LEADERSHIP FOR SUCCUMBING TO NRA PRESSURE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton accused House Republican leaders
Wednesday of ignoring important child safety issues by allowing the
National Rifle Association to rewrite gun-control legislation
designed to help keep weapons out of the hands of criminals and
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a classic, horrible example of how Washington is out
of touch with the rest of America, and it is time that the rest of
America corrected it,'' Clinton declared at a gathering of law
enforcement officials at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   He was referring to House Republicans who succumbed to NRA
pressure during the past two weeks to weaken key provisions of a
bill passed by the Senate last month. That bill would require
background checks for buyers at gun shows, force manufacturers to
sell safety locks along with handguns and ban the importation of
large-capacity ammunition clips.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton used his meeting with law enforcement and civil rights
officials to rally public support for passage in the House of the
same gun-control measures that were approved by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Invoking the memory of the Littleton, Colo., school shooting and
bombing incident that killed 15 people and wounded 21, the
president called on Americans to ask their representatives to vote
against the Republican legislation he said was ``plainly
ghostwritten'' by the NRA.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can still remember Littleton _ it hasn't even been two
months _ then we ought to speak up and be heard,'' Clinton said,
adding that ``it is wrong to let the NRA call the shots on (gun
control).''
</P>
<P>
   House Democratic leaders also joined in criticizing the
Republican rewrite of the Senate bill. They said the House bill
appears to be aimed at appeasing the NRA, which has spent more than
$1 million since the Senate bill passed May 20 trying to rally
support among House members to defeat it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a time for partisanship. It is not the time to let
special interests write legislation. This is the time to do the
right thing,'' said House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said before Congress
adjourned for its Memorial Day recess two weeks ago that he would
support efforts to bring gun-control legislation to the floor, with
members being allowed to offer amendments to address their
concerns. Other Republican leaders also said at the time that
gun-control measures would be debated in the House Judiciary
Committee before being introduced on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   But the committee phase of consideration was abruptly eliminated
this week when Republican leaders announced that they would bring
their own bill directly to the floor for a vote next week. The
Democrats hope to offer the Senate-passed bill as their substitute
measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to try to offer our substitute,'' said Julian
Epstein, chief Democratic counsel for the House Judiciary
Committee. ``But we don't know if we're going to get that chance
... The same (Republican) extremist group that led the Congress on
impeachment (of President Clinton) is running the gun-control issue
now. We don't know what's going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The gun-control measure that Republican leaders plan to offer
contains significant changes in the definition of what constitutes
a gun show.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Senate bill, a gun show is defined as any gathering of
collectors, sellers or dealers where guns are being sold, including
flea markets. But in the language rewritten with the help of NRA
lobbyists and Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, who serves on the NRA
board, only events in which 10 or more gun sellers participate
would be regulated.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats charged that the language change would create a
loophole that would allow individuals, especially criminals and
even young people, to buy weapons without undergoing the mandatory
background checks
</P>
<P>
   The House bill also would replace language in the Senate bill
designed to preserve the Brady law by requiring that only 72 hours
at most be allowed for conducting so-called ``instant background
checks'' instead of a full three business days.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no justification for shortening law enforcement's
time to do checks,'' said Gephardt, who also complained that the
Republican rewrite of the Senate bill would allow non-law
enforcement ``special registrants'' to run background checks.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most striking differences in the two gun-control
measures is that the House bill would not require guns to be sold
with locks or other safety devices if they can be rendered unusable
by removing the firing pin, trigger or some other part.
</P>
<P>
   Another key provision included in a draft of the Republican bill
but not in the Senate version would limit the civil liability of
gun owners, distributors, manufacturers and sellers in cases
involving deaths or injuries caused by weapons. The liability
provision was pushed by House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas,
among other Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., called
the Democratic criticism of the Republican bill ``their typical
knee-jerk reaction'' to efforts aimed at winning broad support from
both sides of the aisle for ``sensible'' gun-control measures.
</P>
<P>
   He called Democratic claims that the NRA wrote the GOP bill
``nonsense,'' although he acknowledged that both the NRA and Craig
did ``make known their views'' to House Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt that gun shows ought to be defined more precisely,''
Hyde said, summing up the main thrust of the GOP measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last analysis, the government cannot solve the problem.
But what we can do, we will do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde said it's still unclear what the final bill will look like
when Republicans offer it on the floor next week and suggested that
there may be ``several versions'' that members end up voting on,
including one that raises the age limit for gun purchases from 18
to 21.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate bill does not contain an age limit provision.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are hopeful that raising the age limit for gun
purchases will help attract more support for their measure and help
ease public concerns about the GOP's position on gun-control
matters.
</P>
<P>
   Their own internal polls show that they have reason to be
concerned about a public backlash against them, especially in the
wake of the Littleton incident. A GOP survey conducted last month
found that 80 percent of those polled favored tougher gun-control
measures.

 PHOENIX: drug use.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Drug courts have sprouted throughout New York, New Jersey and
Connecticut, though the basic laws on mandatory sentences for a
host of drug crimes have not changed. In many cases, it is
prosecutors who have discretion to send offenders to treatment,
instead of filing charges that could lead to jail time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drug courts work,'' said Judge John Schwartz, chief of the
city court system in Rochester, N.Y. ``They treat the underlying
disease of addiction. Prison does not break the cycle of
addiction.''
</P>
<P>
   While critics say the drug courts coddle chronic abusers who
belong in jail, the cost savings have won over many others.
Treatment instead of prison saves about $20,000 per person
annually, according to a study last year by the National Center on
Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Barry McCaffrey, the director of national drug policy, has
become a promoter of drug courts, saying they ``constitute one of
the most monumental changes in social justice in this country since
World War II.'' After three years as the drug czar, McCaffrey has
concluded that treatment is the best way to reduce drug use.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has increased financing for treatment
by 17 percent over the last four years. But President Clinton's
drug-fighting budget, at $18 billion, the biggest in history, still
directs nearly two-thirds of the money to enforcement and
interdiction of the drug supply, a proportion unchanged since the
Reagan administration. Treatment will get about $3 billion from the
budget.
</P>
<P>
   According to the General Accounting Office, the research arm of
Congress, 70 percent of the people sent to drug courts successfully
complete treatment. People who are sent to prison instead of
treatment are four times as likely to commit another drug crime
within five years of release, the report found.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drug treatment programs are like Madonna _ they keep
reinventing themselves after everyone has written them off,'' said
Barbara Zugor, executive director of one of Arizona's oldest
treatment centers, the Treatment Assessment Screening Center.
</P>
<P>
   On Ms. Zugor's office wall are pictures of her with the nation's
drug czars through the years, from William Bennett, who advocated
locking up casual users, to McCaffrey, who says he has dropped the
term ``drug war'' as inappropriate.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at the pictures, Ms. Zugor said drug policy had
essentially gone full circle, from the hope of early treatment
years to a harsh period of prison-building and zero tolerance to a
trend toward treatment but with a coercive element.
</P>
<P>
   ``For all the money we've spent as a country, we haven't really
had a good debate on what works,'' she said. ``I do know this,
though: Law enforcement and the courts and prosecutors seem to be
awfully tired of picking people up and sending them off to jail.''
</P>
<P>
   THE CHANGE: Another Direction In A Traditional State
</P>
<P>
   Arizona might seem an odd state to turn the table on American
drug policy. Its voters are generally conservative and definitely
not soft on crime. For years, the state's imprisonment rate has
ranked among the top. And under the state's basic drug laws, it is
a felony to possess even the smallest amount of drugs like
marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   In the last five years, the prison population has ballooned by
50 percent, to 26,000. State officials say drug and alcohol abuse
are at the root of the crimes of about 75 percent of the inmates,
matching national surveys.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona used to proclaim zero tolerance toward drugs, a policy
publicized with scare commercials showing graphic images of prison
life. A tent camp for prisoners _ nicknamed Camp Arpaio, after the
tough-talking Maricopa County Sheriff Joseph Arpaio _ was perhaps
the most visible symbol of crime and punishment in the Grand Canyon
state.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1996, retired millionaire Joseph Sperling started a
political rockslide that is still sending down stones. Sperling,
who is 78 and calls himself a lifetime student of British
empiricism and economic history, made his fortune by building a
university system for profit and then taking public the company
that ran the system, called Apollo. But he was not ready to retire.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a social scientist, I thought the drug war was one of the
most disastrous public policies I'd ever encountered,'' he said in
an interview from Vienna, where he was vacationing. ``Three years
ago, I was talking with some Arizona politicians, and I said, `We
ought to reform the drug laws.'''
</P>
<P>
   Sperling was particularly incensed by how crack had been
depicted in the press and by policy-makers as something that turned
people into robots or animals. A front-page article in The New York
Times in 1988, for example, reported alarm among drug experts:
``Once people become addicted, these experts say, it is nearly
impossible for them to stop using crack and never go back to it
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Sperling said, ``It was the same thing people said about
marijuana-crazed blacks back in 1914,'' when the first major
federal anti-drug laws were enacted.
</P>
<P>
   Joined by philanthropist George Soros, who has spent millions of
dollars on efforts to overturn drug laws in several states,
Sperling became a principal financial backer of a 1996 initiative
to change Arizona's drug laws, Proposition 200.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually the entire Arizona political establishment, the press
and major national anti-drug leaders campaigned against Proposition
200. Its most controversial part could have made drugs like heroin,
LSD or marijuana legal for medical purposes when prescribed by two
doctors.
</P>
<P>
   But a less-discussed provision mandated treatment instead of
prison for certain nonviolent offenders, mainly criminals whose
core problem was drug addiction.
</P>
<P>
   Proposition 200 passed by a 2-1 margin. Then the state
Legislature amended the measure, saying voters had committed a
grave error. But then supporters of the original initiative put it
up for another statewide vote in 1998 and again it passed, with a
57 percent majority.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a dirty little secret that most people understood _ the
drug war had failed,'' Sperling said. ``The people were way ahead
of the politicians on this.''

 PHOENIX: on this.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The part of the law that allowed doctors to prescribe major
drugs has been effectively halted by federal restrictions on the
medical use of such drugs. But the treatment provision was quietly
put to work more than two years ago, and early results show that
three-fourths of the people who complete treatment test clean for
drugs afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Proposition 200's requirement that offenders get treatment
instead of prison infuriated Rick Romley, the prosecutor of
Maricopa County, which encompasses Phoenix, because he believes
that the threat of punishment is essential.
</P>
<P>
   Under a county treatment program called ``Do Drugs, Do Time,''
drug users are threatened with jail if they do not agree to accept
treatment. Using this coercive approach, the program has been very
successful, said officials at the prosecutor's office, with a
recidivism rate of less than 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe strongly in treatment,'' said Barnett Lotstein, a
special assistant to the Maricopa County prosecutor. ``We're not
`lock 'em up and throw away the key' people. But you have to have
something to hold over people, a hammer if you will.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the view of experts in the 1980s that crack
addiction was untreatable, Norman Helber, Maricopa County's chief
adult probation officer, said, ``We seem to have an awful lot of
ex-crack addicts in Arizona who could tell you otherwise.''
</P>
<P>
   THE EARLY FIGHT: Combining `War' And Prevention
</P>
<P>
   Richard Nixon was the first president to declare a ``war on
drugs,'' but he also directed about two-thirds of all federal
anti-drug money at treatment and prevention _ particularly of
heroin addiction _ with great success, as measured by sharp drops
in crimes committed by drug addicts. His policy, led by a young
psychiatrist, Dr. Jerome Jaffe, expanded federally financed
treatment facilities from 6 in 1969 to more than 300 in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   ``What worked for Jerome Jaffe a quarter-century ago could be
just as effective today,'' wrote Michael Massing, in his narrative
history of drug policy, ``The Fix'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, 1998)
</P>
<P>
   Discouraged by news accounts of addicts who had skipped out of
treatment, New York Gov. Nelson Rockefeller became one of the first
major politicians to turn against treatment. ``Let's be frank,'' he
said in a 1973 speech. ``We have found no cure.''
</P>
<P>
   Rockefeller created some of the nation's most punitive drug
laws, which locked people up for 15 years for possessing certain
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   For the next 20 years, the dominant sentiment among politicians
and prosecutors was that ``nothing works,'' and treatment fell out
of favor _ particularly in the crack years.
</P>
<P>
   THE TREATMENT: Trying to Rebuild Wrecked Lives
</P>
<P>
   Ever since his mother handed him a marijuana joint laced with
opium at the age of 10, said Leslie Angle, he has had a
companionship with illegal drugs. He is 39 now, gray haired, with a
bit of a slouch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crack is the one drug that made me see that I needed help,''
he said. ``I hit my bottom with that drug.'' He was homeless,
stealing to stay high, selling stolen property. He has been in and
out of jail a half-dozen times for a variety of petty crimes, all
of them tied to his drug addiction.
</P>
<P>
   Angle entered the Proposition 200 treatment program in Arizona
early last year and pays about $40 a week, using money from Social
Security disability payments for mental illness. Like others in
treatment, he attends about two sessions of group therapy a week,
led by a licensed counselor.
</P>
<P>
   There is no acupuncture. No synthetic substitutes such as
methadone. No shock therapy or drugs designed to mute the brain's
pleasure impulses. The treatment is aimed at getting Angle to
recognize the patterns of abuses in his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``This teaches me things I didn't know before,'' Angle said.
``I'm tired of just stumbling along through life _ sick of
everything I became. This program has taught me that I have a
choice: that I can change.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Phoenix House admits about 1,000 people every year
to a residential treatment program. Many of them might otherwise go
to prison under the state's Rockefeller drug laws. The laws give
judges no choice but to sentence offenders to jail, but prosecutors
often decide not to press charges if an offenders agrees to stay in
a program like Phoenix House.
</P>
<P>
   New York Gov. George Pataki, a Republican, has suggested that
his state's harsh anti-drug laws could be amended to give judges
discretion to send some first-time offenders to treatment instead
of jail. Critics say his proposal is too modest, but Democrats,
concerned they would be labeled soft on drug crime if they agreed
to the changes, have refused to act upon it.
</P>
<P>
   A majority of the people who enter Phoenix House identify crack
as their primary drug. Treatment involves extensive group therapy
for 12 to 18 months, paid for by state and federal grants, or
donations. For people who are used to instant gratification,
Phoenix House is a long, slow process _ a prospect that makes many
addicts balk at entering on their own.
</P>
<P>
   But the program's results defy the predictions that crack
addicts would prove untreatable. About 70 percent of those who
complete at least a year of the program have tested drug-free up to
five years after departing, said Dr. Mitchell Rosenthal, the
president of Phoenix House.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crack and me were like best friends,'' said Danny Servera, a
31-year-old New Yorker who has been in treatment for eight months.
He is a natty dresser who used to manage a men's clothing store.
This is his second time in treatment for crack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never woke up in the morning with the shakes or anything
like that,'' Servera said. ``For me, it was always mental. I'd
start to think about getting high as a way to numb myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Treatment is built around the person, not the drug. It involves
rebuilding a life, in contrast to prison, where the concept of
rehabilitation has been all but abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a growing number of us who never walked away from the
belief that the key to bringing down drug use is trying to change
behavior,'' said Barbara Broderick, who administers the drug
treatment fund for the state of Arizona. ``Prison should be for
violent people and the recalcitrant.''
</P>
<P>
   Prison is where most hard-core drug users who have run afoul of
the law now reside. More than 90 percent of them have had no
treatment for the addictions that got them in prison, where drugs
often remain freely available.
</P>
<P>
   Locking up these people, in the view of some criminologists, is
a main reason why crime is down. But as many of the nation's
400,000 imprisoned drug offenders are released in the coming years,
they are likely to follow a pattern that has already taken hold:
the ones who have not been treated _ the great majority _ will
commit another crime within five years.

 By TIMOTHY EGAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ A dozen years after the national alarm over crack
hastened the decline of drug treatment in favor of punitive laws
that helped create the world's largest prison system, anti-drug
policy is taking another turn. Treatment is making a comeback,
driven largely by a grass-roots revolt.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona has taken the boldest step. In defiance of the state's
political establishment, voters took the law into their own hands
and voted twice, by large majorities, to make Arizona the first
state to mandate treatment instead of prison for criminal offenders
whose primary legal problem is drug use.
</P>
<P>
   At least 40 states have set up drug courts to steer offenders
toward treatment instead of jail. A number of states are
considering changing their mandatory prison laws for drug
offenders, most notably New York, which was the first to require
long sentences for possession of small amounts of drugs 26 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   In the crack years of the 1980s, treatment programs were gutted
while the drug-fighting budget quadrupled. News reports said crack
was the most addictive substance known to man, and prisons started
to fill with people who once might have gotten help instead. The
number of Americans locked up on drug offenses grew from 50,000 in
1980 to 400,000 today.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even during the height of the prison boom, when some people
were sentenced to life behind bars for possessing small amounts of
a drug, a number of treatment centers continued to have success.
</P>
<P>
   While not all addicts respond to treatment, these programs
showed that crack was less addictive than some other street drugs,
or even nicotine, and that many of its users responded to
conventional group therapy. Habitual users of crack, according to a
five-year federal survey of treatment published last year, showed
greater success at staying clean than alcoholics.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the experts who called crack the worst drug of all have
done an about face.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've changed my view because of the data that has come in over
the last 10 years,'' said Dr. Charles O'Brien, chief of psychiatry
at the Veterans Administration Medical Center in Philadelphia, who
in the late '80s described crack as ``by far, the most addictive
drug we've ever had to deal with.''
</P>
<P>
   What changed his mind were national surveys that showed 84
percent of people who tried cocaine _ either smoking it as crack or
inhaling it in powder form _ did not become addicted. He said he
had also been swayed by a study he co-wrote of habitual users of
crack who were assigned to treatment. A year after treatment, at
least half tested free of drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Locking up crack users is still the policy in the federal
system. But in Arizona, the same crack user prosecuted under state
laws cannot be sent to prison. Instead, he must undergo drug
treatment. The money for treatment comes from the offenders
themselves and from a tax on liquor.
</P>
<P>
   Many states have adopted similar policies by establishing drug
courts, which sentence people to treatment as a way to keep them
out of jail. Started in Miami by judges and prosecutors frustrated
by the conveyer-belt justice of the war on drugs, these courts have
grown from a handful at the start of the decade to nearly 600
nationwide. More than 90,000 people have been sent to treatment
through drug courts.
</P>
<P>
   Where basic state laws on mandatory sentences for a host of drug
crimes have not changed, in many cases it is prosecutors who have
discretion to send offenders to treatment, instead of filing
charges that could lead to jail time.
</P>
<P>
   While critics say the drug courts coddle chronic abusers who
belong in jail, the cost savings have won over many others.
Treatment instead of prison saves about $20,000 per person
annually, according to a study last year by the National Center on
Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University.

they are likely to follow a pattern that has already taken hold:
the ones who have not been treated _ the great majority _ will
commit another crime within five years.

 &HT;    Severance clause puts Dobbs out of business
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Inside CNN's Atlanta newsroom Wednesday, the troops
were calling events leading up to ``Moneyline'' anchor Lou Dobbs'
departure ``The Clash of the Titans,'' referring to Dobbs' in-house
battles with CNN President Richard Kaplan.
</P>
<P>
   Dobbs did not return phone calls Wednesday, and CNN executives
weren't adding to their official news release. In that release, Tom
Johnson, chairman of the CNN Newsgroup, said Dobbs' ``contribution
to CNN and the world of financial reporting have been
immeasurable.'' Dobbs said he leaves CNN ``with the utmost respect
for the organization.''
</P>
<P>
   The differences between Dobbs and Kaplan went public last month
on ``Moneyline,'' when Kaplan told Dobbs to switch to President
Clinton's press conference in Littleton, Colo., and Dobbs informed
his viewers that he was being ordered to switch by Kaplan, a breach
of protocol that shocked many inside the network.
</P>
<P>
   In leaving, Dobbs has emphasized that becoming chairman of, as
well as an investor in, Space.com, which will provide news and
entertainment about outer space, is a new opportunity that excites
him.
</P>
<P>
   So don't look for Dobbs, who was also president of the financial
subsidiary CNNfn, to show up on CNN rivals CNBC or Fox News
Channel, despite some reports. Part of Dobbs' severance package
with CNN reportedly is a multiyear ``noncompete'' clause, meaning
he can't go to work for any competitor.
</P>
<P>
   That's a little consolation for CNN, but network executives also
know that his departure will not sit well with ``Moneyline's'' key
audience of business executives and Wall Street analysts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Losing the franchise of Lou Dobbs is a tremendous blow to
CNN,'' said Don Fitzpatrick, a San Francisco-based TV news
consultant and headhunter. ``There is not a person on television
anywhere that has the reputation Lou Dobbs has as a business
journalist. He wrote the book.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no one at CNN waiting to step in who has Dobbs'
stature. Willow Bay, a ``CNN &AMP; Fortune'' and ``CNN &AMP; Entertainment
Weekly'' co-anchor, will be interim anchor.
</P>
<P>
   Dobbs went all the way back to the first day of CNN, on June 1,
1980, and his deep friendship with founder Ted Turner was legendary
within CNN. Dobbs has been a frequent guest of Turner at his
Montana home, fishing and horseback riding, and Turner reportedly
protected Dobbs in past disputes. The two were so close that back
in 1982, when Turner decided he liked the idea of doing personal
``editorials'' on CNN, it was Dobbs who sat down with his boss, one
to one, and explained why it was a bad idea.
</P>
<P>
   But Dobbs also had a reputation for pushing his own agenda hard
and threatening to resign. He expected to be named president of CNN
in 1991 when there was a vacancy, and offered to resign to Turner
when Johnson was named instead. In 1997, Dobbs wanted CNNfn to
expand its hours of coverage, and was so close to resigning that
CNN had prepared his severance package. But Dobbs wound up getting
at least part of the expansion and staying.

YUGOSLAV ARMY SIGNS WITHDRAWAL PACT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE _ In a long-awaited deal that prompted joyous
celebrations among Serbs here and among Kosovar Albanians in border
refugee camps, the Yugoslav Army signed an agreement Wednesday
night with NATO that calls for the withdrawal of 40,000 Serb forces
from Kosovo over the next 11 days and the effective end of the
11-week war.
</P>
<P>
   The Serb withdrawal, extended by four days as part of a NATO
compromise, was expected to begin at dawn Thursday. If NATO pilots
verify the pullout has begun, NATO later Thursday is expected to
suspend its air strikes after 78 days of bombing that has
devastated Yugoslavia's infrastructure. That, in turn, would lead
to passage of a United Nations Security Council resolution
outlining the peace plan.
</P>
<P>
   Once that resolution is passed, NATO troops will begin going
into Kosovo, hot on the heels of retreating Serb forces. Within a
month, the first of the more than 800,000 ethnic Albanian refugees
who were driven from Kosovo could begin returning home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The war has ended,'' said Yugoslav General Svetozar
Marjanovic, who signed the agreement with Lieutenant General Mike
Jackson, the commander of NATO forces in Macedonia that are poised
to enter Kosovo. Serbian General Obrad Stevanovic, who commands the
Interior Ministry police units that have been blamed for expelling
ethnic Albanians from Kosovo, also signed the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Celebratory gunfire erupted around Belgrade Tuesday night. In
the Yugoslav capital, spared by NATO bombs in the hours before the
pact, motorists honked horns, Serb security forces fired off
weapons, and police tried to prevent foreign camera crews from
capturing the celebrations on film.
</P>
<P>
   There were also reports of widespread celebratory gunfire in
Pristina, the Kosovo capital, where some ethnic Albanians said they
were threatened with death by roving gangs of Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   In the Macedonian capital, Skojpe, about 100 young ethnic
Albanians danced to Albanian pop music and waved flags from the
United States, Britain, and France, confident that the pact would
lead to a quick return home.
</P>
<P>
   ``To think that I could be going back soon, it's unbelievable. I
love America,'' shouted Petrit Bytyqi, 19, a refugee from Pristina,
Kosovo's capital. Grabbing the American flag out of his hand, his
friend Muharrem Berisha screamed above the music: ``We're going
home.''
</P>
<P>
   The US government, burned last week by a Yugoslav government
agreement that Belgrade backed out of Sunday, reacted cautiously,
and officials say large-scale resettlement will not begin for
several months, under best conditions.
</P>
<P>
   After five days of on-again, off-again discussions between
generals Jackson and Marjanovic, NATO compromised, giving the Serbs
11 days instead of an initially agreed seven days to get their
forces out. NATO also agreed to reduce a buffer zone by retreating
Serb forces from 15 to 3 miles.
</P>
<P>
   But Jackson, furious with what he saw as Serb footdragging,
warned Yugoslav officials, saying that if Serb forces break the
agreement, the bombing will resume.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials said there will be discussions on how some
Serb forces will be allowed back to assist with the removal of
mines that Yugoslav forces put down in Kosovo. Serb security forces
will also be allowed back to guard religious and heritage sites in
Kosovo. But those forces will be in the hundreds, and Wednesday's
agreement effectively made Kosovo an international protectorate.
</P>
<P>
   Government-controlled television here announced that the
agreement was proof that the politics of Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic had won. The official media did not tell the
public here that its military leaders were in discussions with
NATO. Instead, official media said the agreement was reached with
the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic was nowhere in sight, continuing his refusal to
address the nation. But the ability of him and his government to
convince the Serbian public that this was an agreement with the
United Nations, rather than a capitulation to NATO, is crucial to
retaining power.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the moral victors of the war,'' said Nebojsa Vujovic,
the Yugoslav deputy foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the withdrawal and suspension of the air strikes
were meant to guarantee smooth sailing of the resolution through
the UN Security Council. Russia and China had said they would not
approve the resolution unless there was a stop in the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about verifying the withdrawal as far as I'm
concerned; it's about ending the bombing,'' said Sergei Lavrov,
Russia's UN envoy.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats said China would abstain on the resolution after NATO
nations and Russia earlier Wednesday rejected several amendments to
the resolution proposed by Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   One amendment would have removed a reference to cooperation with
the International Tribunal in The Hague, which two weeks ago
indicted Milosevic for alleged war crimes. A proposal to include a
reference to the principles of the UN Charter was accepted by the
West and Russia, though diplomats said this was a mere formality.
</P>
<P>
   A US diplomat said NATO air strikes could resume, even after the
resolution passed, if the Serbs reversed their withdrawal. With
international peacekeepers entering Kosovo as the Serbs pull out, a
possible scenario could see Western troops on the ground while
hostilities resumed.
</P>
<P>
   The sequencing of events was crucial to winning the agreement of
the Western allies, who hail from NATO members, and Russia, which
is an ally of Yugoslavia and has been trying to broker a
compromise.
</P>
<P>
   The rebel Kosovo Liberation Army has said it would not attack
withdrawing Serb forces. Yugoslav generals had expressed concerns
about leaving their troops open to ambush by rebel forces as they
left Kosovo. US Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright got the
Kosovo Liberation Army leader, Hashim Thaci, to publicly say his
troops would not attack retreating Serb forces.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, Yugoslav generals balked at signing the
agreement that stipulates the routes and timetables of their
pullout from Kosovo. Serb officials delayed the initiation of the
pullout so they could characterize it as the United Nations
assuming control rather than NATO.
</P>
<P>
   While the Western allies and Russia were able to bridge their
differences, mainly by moving any reference to NATO to the annex of
the draft UN resolution, there remains a dispute over who will
control the nearly 50,000 troops that will form the international
peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
   The six-page document signed by the NATO and Yugoslav military
leaders in Macedonia outlines procedures for withdrawal of Serb
soldiers and police officers.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, the NATO general, said the military-technical agreement
``details how the army, the interior police, and all other forces
should conduct a phased, verifiable, and orderly withdrawl from
Kosovo. It also provides a clear, legal basis for the deployment of
the international security force known as the Kosovo force.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson suggested that domestic Serbian politics had delayed the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is tragic that intransigence has made it necessary for the
international community to resort to airstrikes to reach a
settlement,'' said Jackson. ``However, NATO's resolve in conducting
a sustained air campaign has finally achieved this agreement, and
now is the time to look ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Marjanovic, the deputy chief of staff of the Yugoslav Army,
spoke briefly to reporters, insisting the deal was reached not with
NATO but ``the international security forces . . . under the
auspices of the United Nations.''

KOSOVO DEADLOCK BROKEN AFTER SHARP LONG-RANGE EXCHANGES 
</HEADLINE>
  (With KOSOVO-RDP) 
(jt) 
 By JANE PERLEZ    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLOGNE, Germany _ The deadlock between Yugoslav and NATO
military officials negotiating in a tent on the barren Macedonia
border was finally broken after some sharp exchanges nearly a
thousand miles away in an elaborate 15th-century meeting hall.
</P>
<P>
   An irritated Russian foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, broke into a
discussion among his foreign minister colleagues on another matter
here late Wednesday afternoon. He charged that the Americans and
NATO were responsible for the stalemate in the tent, according to
accounts given by Clinton administration officials and other
diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   If the Americans could not solve the situation, Ivanov said, the
Russians would help them, one diplomat recounted afterwards.
</P>
<P>
   Ivanov then pledged that Moscow would vote for the United
Nations Security Council resolution authorizing the international
security force immediately after NATO suspended the bombing of
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   With this move, Ivanov gave the go-ahead for a delicately
arranged set of events that diplomats had dubbed the
``synchronization'' of the end of the Kosovo war.
</P>
<P>
   This ``synchronization'' entailed five steps: the signing of the
military withdrawal agreement in the tent, the withdrawal of Serb
troops from Kosovo, verification of a partial withdrawal, a bombing
suspension, the vote in the Security Council and finally, the
deployment of the international security force under the leadership
of the Lt. Gen. Michael Jackson of Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who is attending the
meeting here of the G-8 foreign ministers from the seven most
industrialized countries and Russia, had been talking on-and-off
since breakfast with Ivanov about unlocking the stalemate.
</P>
<P>
   But until Ivanov's statement to his colleagues at about 5 p.m.
at the Guerzenich Hall, Clinton administration officials said they
had doubted whether Russia would vote quickly for the Security
Council resolution that authorizes the entry of the security force
into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   At U.N. headquarters in New York, the Russians had refused to
agree that the draft resolution _ approved by the eight foreign
ministers meeting here Tuesday _ be placed into final form ready
for voting within 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Without approval of the resolution in New York, the
international security force would not have the authority to enter
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Any delay between the suspension of NATO's bombing pause and the
deployment of the peacekeepers, diplomats argued, would create a
vacuum inside Kosovo that would create two kinds of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, the Kosovo Liberation Army would feel free to
take revenge on the departing Serbian forces. Under those
circumstances, with the guerrillas fighting back at them, the
Serbian forces would be reluctant to leave. This was just the
endgame _ civil war instead of an orderly departure of Serbian
forces _ that NATO wanted to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   The second problem, diplomats said, was that any break in the
sequence of events carefully laid out by the NATO allies could
easily play into the hands of the Yugoslav leader, Slobodan
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians' reluctance to get the Security Council resolution
ready for a vote in New York raised what a senior administration
official termed ``suspicions'' about whether Moscow would vote
quickly enough for the international force to move into Kosovo
immediately after the bombing suspension.
</P>
<P>
   Once Ivanov gave his word _ during what British Foreign
Secretary Robin Cook called a ``tense'' G-8 session _ the Clinton
administration made a move that satisfied the Yugoslav negotiators.
</P>
<P>
   The administration sent word through NATO that a sentence which
had been included in the military document and which the Yugoslavs
objected to could be removed from the text.
</P>
<P>
   State Department officials accompanying Albright refused to tell
reporters the exact wording of the sentence. One official, speaking
on condition of anonymity, said the disputed sentenced described
``the sequence between the withdrawals and the Security Council''
vote, but declined to give more detail.
</P>
<P>
   Once Ivanov gave his word and the offending sentence was removed
from the military agreement, the Yugoslav negotiators who had
broken off the talks for more consultations with Belgrade drove
back to Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the wheels of the Security Council moved the
resolution ahead. At NATO headquarters, officials who had left for
the day were called back to work.
</P>
<P>
   And when Jackson emerged from the tent to announce the accord,
Albright, Ivanov and the other foreign ministers were dining over
an elaborate meal at a chocolate museum here, where the speciality
is the history of confectionery.

MEMO MAY HELP FUEL CONNECTICUT LAWSUIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MEG VAILLANCOURT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Still smarting over the New England Patriots' decision not to
move to Hartford, Connecticut officials have pounced on a memo
written by a Massachusetts consultant as a way the Nutmeg State
might be able to mount a multimillion lawsuit against team owner
Robert Kraft and the National Football League.
</P>
<P>
   The memo, written by the team's environmental and transportation
consultants, Rizzo Associates, detailed the infrastructure
improvements that would be necessary if the Patriots went ahead
with plans to build a new stadium on land the team owns adjacent to
the current stadium. The memo was dated April 28, two days before
the Patriots terminated their agreement with Connecticut to build a
$374 million publicly financed football stadium and convention
center in Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots' deal with Connecticut prohibited the team from
entering into talks with other cities or states while it was
evaluating Connecticut's offer.
</P>
<P>
   But according to Rizzo officials, the memo was written at the
request of Massachusetts lawmakers and business leaders seeking to
keep the team in the Bay State _ and not New England Patriots owner
Robert Kraft.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Patriots had nothing to do with that memo,'' said Sam
Park, a Rizzo principal. ``It was produced because Massachusetts
lawmakers wanted an update on information we had given them over a
year before _ certainly long before the team began negotiating with
Connecticut. The Patriots didn't even know we wrote it.''
</P>
<P>
   Park said that since his firm does a lot of business with
Massachusetts, Rizzo provided lawmakers and local business leaders
with the report ``as a matter of courtesy and respect.'' The Rizzo
memo was referred to in the legislation passed last month that
provides $70 million in state funds for infrastructure improvements
required for a new stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Interviewed earlier this week, Connecticut Attorney General
Richard Blumenthal pointed to the memo as potent ammunition in a
potential lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The memo raises a number of significant questions whether the
Patriots were dealing with Massachusetts officials at a time when
their contract barred them from doing so, and we are exploring that
in the course of our ongoing investigation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When told that Park said his firm had authored the memo without
the Patriots' participation, Blumenthal said he would have no
further comment on the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't ruled anyone out or in as a potential defendant,''
Blumenthal said Wednesday. ``Nor have we ruled out any potential
(grounds for the suit).''
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal said he expects to consult with Connecticut Governor
John G. Rowland and legislative leaders before he reaches a
decision about whether to file suit within the next two or three
months.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft terminated his agreement with Connecticut on April 30,
noting the difficulties the state had encountered in preparing the
polluted Hartford site and his doubts about whether the state could
meet the 2002 stadium opening date specifed in the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Under the contract, Kraft was allowed to pull out of the deal at
his ``sole discretion'' before May 2 without any penalty.
</P>
<P>
   The team unveiled its plans for a new $285 million stadium to be
built alongside the old one in Foxborough at a breakfast with
business leaders and NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue Tuesday.

AURA OF INVINCIBILITY IS DRYING UP COFFERS FO BUSH'S GOP RIVALS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By DON VAN NATTA Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Fund raising is a bountiful feast for Gov. George
W. Bush of Texas while most of the other Republican presidential
contenders are fighting among themselves for table scraps.
</P>
<P>
   This dominance in fund raising is one of several factors that
have helped Bush create an aura as an almost invincible
front-runner, a remarkable position for a candidate making his
first run for national office.
</P>
<P>
   That aura of invincibility has made it nearly impossible for the
rest of the Republican field to attract enough support to keep pace
with Bush, who will formally begin his presidential campaign on
Saturday in Iowa. And reports of Bush's fund-raising juggernaut are
likely to intensify his opponents' problems in raising money.
</P>
<P>
   As most Republicans continue to bet on the favorite, several
senior Republican fund-raisers predicted on Wednesday that all of
Bush's rivals will fall short of their fund-raising goals for the
second quarter, which ends on June 30.
</P>
<P>
   Just this week, Elizabeth Dole hired a finance chairman, after a
frustrating, monthslong national search. The senior staff members
of several Republican hopefuls acknowledged that their chances
would improve only if Bush stumbled after leaving Austin later this
week for Iowa and New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Quayle, the former vice president, and Lamar Alexander, the
former governor of Tennessee, have struggled to meet their
exploratory committees' payrolls, forcing them to reduce their
staffs and lower their financial goals.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's rivals have likened the Texan's war chest, now estimated
by some fund-raisers to be approaching $15 million, to the
valuation of a high-flying Internet stock, which they hope will
eventually come crashing down to earth. ``There's a little bit of
irrational exuberance about George Bush's prospects,'' Alexander
said, borrowing the phrase used by Alan Greenspan, the Federal
Reserve Board chairman, to describe the runaway stock market.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never seen anything like it,'' said Brian Kennedy, the
national political director for Alexander. ``Bush just opens the
doors and the money floods right in. But like an overvalued stock,
there is bound to be a correction. And when that occurs, we have
the infrastructure to take advantage of the changed environment.''
</P>
<P>
   The financial shortfall is especially severe for Mrs. Dole, who
is second to Bush in the national polls but trails him by many
millions in the fund-raising chase. Her campaign was hurt badly by
her failure to find someone to agree to become her finance chairman
until this week.
</P>
<P>
   Mel Sembler, the Republican National Committee's finance
chairman, said he had worked with Mrs. Dole to recruit someone to
lead her campaign's committee of 180 volunteer fund-raisers. ``It
has not been an easy chore,'' Sembler said.
</P>
<P>
   It was almost by accident that Mrs. Dole found someone to accept
the challenge. A little-known business executive named Bonnie
McElveen-Hunter was the host of a Dole luncheon in Greensboro,
N.C., last Thursday, and astonished Mrs. Dole's top aides when the
event raised $110,000. Mrs. Dole quickly offered Mrs.
McElveen-Hunter the finance chairman post, which she accepted on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. McElveen-Hunter decided to volunteer to help Mrs. Dole
after reading in The Wall Street Journal a ranking of all the
Republican candidates' fund-raising totals.
</P>
<P>
   ``And Elizabeth Dole was dead last; I couldn't believe it,''
Mrs. McElveen-Hunter said in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
``She was behind someone named Gary Bauer, who I had never heard
of. And I thought: how could someone who is so qualified and given
her life to noble service fail to raise any money? She deserves to
raise money.''
</P>
<P>
   Although she has no political fund-raising experience, Mrs.
McElveen-Hunter said she raised $1 million at a single event for
Habitat for Humanity in 1997, the organization's record, which
still stands. Last year, she raised more than $1 million for the
United Way. Mrs. McElveen-Hunter is the founder and chief executive
officer of Pace Communications, a privately held publisher of
magazines.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Dole's senior aides said they believed Mrs.
McElveen-Hunter's lack of political connections would be an asset
to a campaign that hopes to attract people who are not the usual
participants in presidential politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's never been around politics before, which is exciting,''
said Ari Fleischer, the spokesman for Mrs. Dole's exploratory
committee. ``The way I look at it, when one of your competitors has
a corner of the market all sewn up, you create a new corner of the
market.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. McElveen-Hunter said she was not intimidated by Bush's
significant leads in the national polls and on the balance sheet.
``I'm reminded of the saying: Today a peacock, tomorrow a
feather-duster,'' she said. ``Who knows? It is so early in the
race.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. McElveen-Hunter said that when she asked for checks for
Mrs. Dole, some of her friends told her they already had sent a
check to Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people have said to me, `Bonnie, we're George Bush
supporters,''' she said. ``And I said, do your pants only have one
pocket in them?''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS HERE)

   Mrs. Dole is gambling that Mrs. McElveen-Hunter will help her
shed the label of a financial lightweight that arose after her
exploratory committee got off to a particularly slow start. Her
committee raised only $700,000 during the first three months of the
year. And then her husband, Bob Dole, said he would consider
sending a check to one of her opponents, Sen. John McCain of
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   It was in that period that Mrs. Dole had asked two Republicans
to become her finance chairman, but both said they had other
commitments.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican network that George W. Bush has put together is
formidable,'' said Phil Smith, Mrs. Dole's finance director, a paid
staff position. ``But I think our campaign has the opportunity to
attract a lot of professional women, a lot of Generation Xers who
have never participated in presidential politics before. We've got
this tremendous potential. We just needed the right person to do
the job. And we now have that person. She is a hard-charging
corporate CEO who will do a great job.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Fleischer refused to say how much money Mrs. Dole raised this
quarter, but he said her bank account would get a big lift by the
dozen events scheduled before June 30, the final day of the second
quarter. Later this week, Mrs. Dole will appear at fund-raising
events in Cincinnati, Milwaukee and Minneapolis. Dole has also
helped his wife raise money, and he plans to attend four
fund-raising events later this month.
</P>
<P>
   Sembler, the national committee's finance chairman, said Bush
had received contributions from the vast majority of active
Republicans who usually contributed to presidential campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's happened is Bush is sucking the wind out of everybody's
sails,'' Sembler said. ``It's making it tough on everyone.
Direct-mail does not seem to be working well for anybody. Everybody
is having serious problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Sembler was in town this week meeting with top aides of the
candidates. He said he had told senior members of the various
campaigns to lower their financial expectations if they hoped to
compete with the Bush fund-raising machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of trying to do $200,000 and $300,000 per event, I am
telling them to try doing $50,000 and $25,000,'' he said. ``Maybe
they'll have to do 250 events instead of 100 events. They'll have
to work harder. It won't be easy, it won't be pretty. But this is
the approach they will have to take if they want to survive.''

   LAPUSNIK, Yugoslavia _ Todor is a soldier, a factory worker from
northern Serbia who volunteered to come here to Kosovo and defend
it for his country.
</P>
<P>
   He knows his war is about to end. But in this blasted,
burned-out village, where Serbian soldiers keep guard from inside
destroyed Albanian houses and shops, he wondered Wednesday whether
the outcome was worth the price, to his own comrades and to the
Albanians of this southern Serbian province.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm angry about how it's ending,'' he said, rubbing his hand
along his dirty blond beard. ``This should have been done better. A
lot of people have died for nothing. And I believe that in four or
five years, no Serb will still be living in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Todor is 30, with a wife and daughter, Tijana, 7, and he asked
that his full name not be printed. He was waiting at a military
checkpoint here, near a large Albanian business, smashed and
looted, that now bears a spray-painted inscription: Hotel Serbia.
Bricks are piled in front of a broken window, creating a sniper
position.
</P>
<P>
   No civilians are left here. A helmeted soldier watches from the
balcony of a nearby house. Like every house here, it is burned out,
its roof gone. He waves an informal salute as trucks of soldiers
move past, turning onto the Malisevo road, which does not run out
of Kosovo, but toward the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo is where the Serbian national consciousness is rooted and
where its cultural treasures mostly lie. For the Yugoslav army its
loss, even against NATO's overwhelming firepower from the air,
feels like a professional catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   Another soldier said the army did not feel defeated. ``People
here feel that Milosevic capitulated because Belgrade did not have
electricity for a few days,'' he said caustically, referring to the
Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   That soldier and two of his colleagues, who did not give their
names, were just returning from a couple days of home leave. Unlike
Todor, they are local men, mobilized for duty with this war.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if it was hard to return to the front, one said: ``It's
not difficult at all. We have to defend Kosovo. Do they think we
should give Kosovo back to them so easily?''
</P>
<P>
   They had heard little of the news and were skeptical that 50,000
NATO troops were about to pour into this little province.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly the only traffic here, as NATO planes still roared
overhead, was military. Lapusnik is only 30 miles west of Pristina,
on the road to Pec. But civilians, less worried now about being
bombed, are now more frightened of renewed sniping by groups of
Kosovo Liberation Army fighters, especially in the interlude
between full-scale war and NATO-led occupation.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the snipers had reinfiltrated Kosovo, these soldiers
said they suspected that the guerrillas, existing in such small
bands, had never left, but simply picked up their arms again as the
war appeared to be ending.
</P>
<P>
   On the road there are endless reminders of the peculiar horrors
of this war. Near the crossroads town of Komorane, an Albanian cafe
called Kosovar is burned out, its red metal Coca-Cola sign the only
spot of color against the smoky charring of fire.
</P>
<P>
   Two red tractors, also burned, their tires melted or missing,
sit at crazy angles to the road, pushed out of the way. A pile of
clothes lies by the roadside, filthy and twisted, near a mattress
that presumably fell off the tractor of a fleeing or expelled
Albanian.
</P>
<P>
   At Komorane military trucks with soldiers turn north toward
Banjica and Srbica, where Todor and two comrades were wounded on
April 7 in a firefight with members of the Kosovo Liberation Army,
``They made an ambush, a horseshoe, and shot us,'' Todor said,
describing how his unit was surrounded on three sides.
</P>
<P>
   He pulled back his sleeve to show where a rifle bullet passed
through his tricep. The wound still looks raw, as red as beefsteak,
but he says it bothers him less and less.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he thinks when he looks at the destruction around
him, at the ruins of the lives and dreams of Albanian civilians, he
went silent for a moment. ``This is about pushing the people
back,'' he said. Back how? ``Historically.'' He shook his head.
``We ought to be able to live together. I don't really understand
why this happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Is he ready to go home? ``If I'm ordered to go,'' he said. Does
he blame Milosevic? ``I'm not a political person,'' he said.
``Serbs should defend their country.''
</P>
<P>
   Closer to Pristina, however, there are more signs that the army
is preparing to move out of Kosovo. A few military trucks are
bearing equipment and men back toward Serbia proper. In Pristina
itself, outside apartment buildings, some military trucks were
being loaded Wednesday with the furniture and household goods of
officers.
</P>
<P>
   Serbs are anxious about the end of this war and the return of
the Albanians and the guerrillas. They are not afraid of
mistreatment by NATO forces, but they have a hard time believing
that NATO will demilitarize and pacify the very fighters for whom
this fearsome bombing campaign was waged. They do not regard NATO
as neutral, and they believe that NATO countries support Kosovo's
independence under the rule of the Albanians for NATO's own,
mysterious ends.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last few days, the sharp panic over the sudden
decision by Milosevic to accept NATO's terms has begun to recede,
and many Serbs now say that they owe it to future generations to
remain in Kosovo. Before the war, perhaps 180,000 Serbs lived in
Kosovo, compared to some 2 million Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Numbers are unobtainable, but some Serbs have already left
Kosovo, and others will certainly go. Already, because of the war
and the bombing, many wives and children of Serb men had left the
province, and they will not soon return.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these families already have one leg out of Kosovo,''
said one respected Serb journalist here, Milivoje Mihajlovic. ``It
may be easier to lift the other foot.'' That will be particularly
true of Serbs who live in predominantly Albanian villages or
cities, like Podujevo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dilemma for people here is to decide either to change the
way they live or where they live,'' Mihajlovic said. ``There has
been too much damage now for things to be the same.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Still, under the sponsorship of the local Serbian orthodox
bishop of Rasca and Prizren, named Artemija, and of the local
Serbian Resistance Movement, a small rally was held Wednesday at
Pristina's sports center to urge Serbs to stay in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,000 people came in the hot sun to the meeting, called
the People's Zbor, a traditional village council, to listen to the
bishop and to a Serbian community leader, Momcilo Drajkovic.
</P>
<P>
   Drajkovic told the quiet crowd that the local authorities had
urged him not to hold the meeting, ``that they will solve all this
for us.'' But it is important, he said, ``that we as a people
continue to organize ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   He cited Artemija, saying: ``If we leave here, we will never
have the right to come here again. We will not leave our holy
Kosovo and Metohija,'' the formal name of the province, ``to
anyone.'' Metohija means ``land of churches'' and refers to the
western part of the province, near the Albanian border, where many
of the church's finest monasteries and holy sites are located.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not be led to be sacrificial lambs on our own
doorsteps,'' Drajkovic said. He called on the U.N. Security Council
to protect the Serbs. But his only mention of the Albanians was no
apology, but an indirect plea. ``For those who want revenge on us,
revenge is not an answer,'' he said. ``Peace cannot be achieved
through mutual revenge.''
</P>
<P>
   A few policemen listened but did not interfere. The crowd
clapped softly a few times, but moved away quietly, still anxious.
</P>
<P>
   Tatjana Surlic, 40, who works at the local army officers club,
said she thought the rally was a positive step. ``Serbs should
organize ourselves to stay,'' she said. ``We have nowhere else to
go. With all the damage in Serbia, too, where would we live or
work?''
</P>
<P>
   She is less nervous than ``a little angry,'' she said. ``The
honest working people here, who kept their honor, must stay and
they want to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   Moma Djokic, 42, has also been mobilized into the army. ``NATO
is fighting for the other side, for the terrorists,'' he said.
``They're not interested in me.'' He, too, intends to stay where
his family has lived for generations. ``I'm not leaving this Kosovo
alive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He did have one request for NATO troops, however, and insisted
that an American journalist take down his words. ``I just ask the
Americans and the others not to shut both eyes about the KLA.''

 &HT;    MP3.com, Cox enter music Web site deal
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ MP3.com, one of the major purveyors of downloadable
music files on the Internet, Wednesday announced that Cox
Interactive Media will invest $45 million in MP3.com in connection
with a joint venture the two companies will form to create music
Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, both companies said they will make approximately
equal financial contributions to the new venture, which will also
include advertising and e-commerce revenue sharing between the new
venture and MP3.com.
</P>
<P>
   In connection with CIM's investment in MP3.com, David Easterly,
president and chief operating officer of Cox Enterprises Inc., will
join MP3.com's board of directors. Cox Enterprises Inc., based in
Atlanta, is the parent company of Cox Interactive Media and The
Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Tentative plans call for the two companies to work together to
create and operate music-related Web sites. Downloading music clips
from the Internet is rapidly becoming one of the most popular
pastimes for Internet users and music lovers. Amazon.com and a
variety of other major Web sites are forging alliances to bring
music downloads to customers. Even though the recording industry
maintains that MP3 technology encourages music piracy, many
recording artists are beginning to embrace the idea of making their
music available on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   MP3.com is one of the most popular Web destinations for music
lovers. The company uses the Internet and data compression
technologies to enable a growing number of musicians to distribute
their music over the Web to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The San Diego-based MP3.com offers a catalog with more than
56,000 songs by 11,000 artists that can be downloaded for free. The
music is stored in a file format called MP3, which offers
near-CD-quality sound.
</P>
<P>
   MP3.com sells albums and compilation CDs, which it mails to
customers, but most of its revenue comes from advertisers. The
company filed for an initial public offering in May.
</P>
<P>
   CIM, which operates AccessAtlanta and 30 local Web sites across
the country, has incorporated Cox TV, radio and newspaper content,
while providing other products and services including search, chat
and shopping services that complement local content.
</P>
<P>
   What is MP3?
</P>
<P>
   MP3 is shorthand for Motion Picture Coding Experts Group-1,
audio layer-3. An MP3 is a computer file format for audio. It can
be downloaded from the Internet, posted on a Web site, sent via
e-mail or stored on your hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   How to download songs
</P>
<P>
   1. Select MP3 player from a Web site, such as www.mp3.com. Click
and download the player you've selected.
</P>
<P>
   2. Go to the MP3.com home page to find music. Click on song and
download. The downloaded song will now appear on your hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   3. Double-click the file to begin playing the song.
</P>
<P>
   Storing the songs
</P>
<P>
   Music can be stored on your hard drive or on portable MP3
players, which can store up to 60 minutes of music transferred from
your computer.

 &HT;    Home Depot targeting Canada
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Home Depot plans a major expansion into eastern Canada
that will add more than 20 stores and create 4,000 jobs over the
next five years.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based retailer, which now has 43 Canadian stores,
primarily in British Columbia and Ontario, will open three stores
next year in Quebec, two in Nova Scotia and one in New Brunswick at
a cost of at least $8 million per store, said Annette Verschuren,
president of Home Depot Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot, which currently has 10 percent of the $12.5 billion
Canadian home improvement market, will operate in eight of the
country's 10 provinces. Most of the expansion plans involve Quebec,
where Verschuren said there's a potential for 15 to 20 new stores
over the next three to four years.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, Quebec, which is home to a quarter of the
Canadian population, was off limits to Home Depot because of a
noncompete agreement. Home Depot entered Canada in 1994 when it
bought a 75 percent stake in the Aikenhead's Home Improvement
Warehouse chain. Home Depot purchased operations in English Canada
and agreed not to compete with the French operations in Quebec.
Since then, the Quebec arm has gone through several acquisitions,
which nullified the noncompete agreement, according to Home Depot's
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to become a national retailer in Canada, and not being
able to get into one of its strongest provinces really held us
back,'' Verschuren said. ``This is going to give us a big base to
grow.''
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot will open 11 stores this year in central and western
Canada. The company plans to grow 20 percent to 25 percent annually
in all of its operations.
</P>
<P>
   The timing is good for growth in Canada, said analyst Wayne Hood
of Prudential Securities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Initially, Home Depot went into Canada at a time when the
economy was peaking and struggling, which led to slower growth for
them,'' Hood said. ``But those issues are resolved, so this is a
natural extension.''
</P>
<P>
   Canada's housing market is rebounding from a recession. Sales of
home improvement products increased 8 percent in 1998, according to
National Home Center News. Home Depot Canada increased sales 27
percent to about $1 billion in 1998, according to the trade
publication.

 &HT;    Abortion foe sues, claims MindSpring erased e-mail
 &HT;    By Frances Katz and Diane Lore
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The owner of an anti-abortion Web site is suing
MindSpring Enterprises for $251 million, claiming the Atlanta-based
Internet provider destroyed hundreds of e-mail messages when it
closed down the site.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, filed Tuesday in the Superior Court of Gwinnett
County, asks for $1 million for breach of contract and $250 million
in punitive damages. It was filed by Neil Horsely, 55, a Carrollton
resident who operates the Christian Gallery Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Horsely says when MindSpring closed the account it destroyed his
e-mail, which he estimates averaged between 700 and 800 messages a
day. A key issue in the suit is MindSpring's alleged destruction of
e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``MindSpring has no knowledge of the suit, and even if we did we
would be unlikely to comment on an active litigation,'' said
MindSpring spokesman Ed Hansen.
</P>
<P>
   ``As MindSpring has publicly stated before, Mr. Horsely's
service with MindSpring was terminated for a violation of our
appropriate use policy with which Mr. Horsely is well versed
with,'' Hansen said.
</P>
<P>
   Horsley's attorney, John Matteson, said: ``The punitive damages
are high to get (MindSpring's) attention. It's actually pretty
simple. It's a breach of contract suit for shutting down his site
and destroying his e-mail without justification.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost the minute I heard what they had done (by destroying
the e-mail and shutting down the site), I knew they had made a
fundamental legal error,'' Horsley said.
</P>
<P>
   Until Feb. 4, Horsely was a MindSpring subscriber and maintained
the site on MindSpring's server. Horsley said he believes he has
the money and the time to go forward with the suit.
</P>
<P>
   Horsely now runs the Christian Gallery site from his own server.
He's also started a new Web site called Restore the Net.

 &HT;    Telecom highway bumpy in spots
 &HT;    By Ernest Holsendolph
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Even as they are building more and more network
capacity to keep up with rolling demand by business and consumers,
telecommunications companies say there is an even bigger struggle
to get dependable high-speed access to the networks for paying
users.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now we have a communications superhighway, with dirt
road access,'' said Jesse Russell, vice president for advanced
communications at AT&AMP;T Laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, with a showman's timing, Lance Wetherby of
Atlanta-based MindSpring Enterprises leaped on the opportunity:
</P>
<P>
   ``We work the dirt roads, and we're having a lot of fun,'' said
Wetherby, executive vice president of the Internet service
provider.
</P>
<P>
   The exchange took place Wednesday morning at Supercomm99 during
a panel discussion titled ``Network Convergence: Where Are We
Headed?''
</P>
<P>
   It was chaired by Russell, with participants from phone
companies like BellSouth, network builders like Qwest, and even
Microsoft, looking for ways the software giant can edge into
telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
   Some 47,000 participants were expected at Supercomm99, up from
40,000 last year, coming from more than 100 countries, to learn the
latest in the changing phone business.
</P>
<P>
   Telecommunications officials say that Internet and similar
communications are burgeoning, driven by e-mail, electronic
commerce and other hot areas of activity.
</P>
<P>
   Growth is so great that this year the previously unthinkable
will occur _ the traffic in data will edge past the traffic in
voice communication by phone. With the pressure on, MCI said it
hopes to double its telecommunications capacity from 1998.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the demand, communications engineers are
hard-pressed to put up enough wires to carry all the bits of
information, forcing them to push harder into new technologies.
</P>
<P>
   These include creating fibers that carry more information
faster, as well as better switches for managing the flow of
information.
</P>
<P>
   Also, to help carry the growing information load with more
flexibility, growing numbers of wireless networks are being created
and deployed for data, not just voice messages.
</P>
<P>
   Hand-held pads already are being used to send and receive
written messages, retrieve stock quotations and other reports, and
send commands, including sales orders.
</P>
<P>
   John C. Charters, vice president of Qwest Communications, said,
``The new developments mean we must get bigger, with greater access
to all the markets.''
</P>
<P>
   Qwest, now said to be the subject of merger interest at
BellSouth, is building a nationwide broadband network that will
carry voice, data and video traffic and may be looking for
acquisitions of its own.
</P>
<P>
   William Smith, vice president for network planning at BellSouth,
said his company is working on one of the imperatives in the
fast-growing, ever-more-complex communications business _ how to
make the huge apparatus more user-friendly, how to make useful
devices for customers who neither understand nor care about the
riddle of building global networks.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, BellSouth is working on a single receptacle for
voice mail, e-mail and other messages so the consumer can have a
handy way to stay in touch.
</P>
<P>
   While some experts predicted that ultimately there will be one
great global network of networks, Thomas Koll, vice president for
Internet customers at Microsoft, differed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be at least two,'' he said, ``possibly including
DSL and a wireless network connection.'' Digital subscriber line is
a form of technology now being exploited by BellSouth, MindSpring
and others for bringing high-speed Internet connection through the
phone lines.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, most of the experts agreed that the competitive
battle will continue, including a struggle among the phone
companies, long-distance providers and the cable industry,
buttressed by AT&AMP;T's new cable strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``AT&AMP;T is in for the fight of its life if it wants to pursue
that cable strategy,'' said Charters of Qwest.
</P>
<P>
   The panel also included Jack Waters, engineering vice president
at Level 3 Communications and vice president for network technology
and planning at MCI WorldCom.

 &HT;    Wolf Camera adds 12 stores in Baltimore
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Wolf Camera's den keeps getting bigger.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf said Wednesday it will acquire the Dark Room, a 12-store
film developer in Baltimore. Wolf Camera already had five stores in
Baltimore from last summer's acquisition of the Fox Photo chain
from Eastman Kodak Co. Those stores, together with the Dark Room
photo labs, are a springboard for more expansion in the Baltimore
market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll add two to three full-size stores like our store on 14th
Street,'' said Wayne Freedman, senior vice president of marketing.
``We typically like to have a combination of smaller stores and
large, very high-profile locations.'' The Dark Room stores will be
revamped to carry equipment and services similar to Wolf Camera's
concept, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion in Baltimore takes Wolf Camera founder Chuck Wolf
back to his roots. He got his start in the camera business in the
late 1960s by working for his uncle, Edward Ritz, at a family chain
in nearby Beltsville, Md. In 1974, Wolf traded his stock in Ritz
Camera Centers to start Wolf Camera with seven stores in Atlanta
and two in Charlotte, N.C. With about 900 stores, Ritz Camera runs
the nation's largest photo retail chain. But fast-growing Wolf
Camera now has 725 stores and is closing the gap with a string of
acquisitions and new stores.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf Camera's stores in Baltimore mark the first time Chuck Wolf
has taken the competition back to his roots. Atlanta will get a
taste of the family rivalry as well. Ritz Camera President David
Ritz, a cousin of Chuck Wolf, said recently he plans to open stores
in metro Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Freedman downplayed the competition, noting that the two chains
already go head-to-head in numerous markets around the country.
``As both of us grow, it's inevitable that we're going to compete
with each other,'' he said. ``Our main competition is
overwhelmingly the mass merchandisers.''
</P>
<P>
   Freedman added that Wolf Camera plans to add several locations
this year in metro Atlanta, where it already has more than 70
stores.

<P>
   KAFANCHAN, Nigeria _ The trouble began when the 95-year-old emir
died in November after ruling this town in northern Nigeria for 40
years.
</P>
<P>
   The indigenous people, who had long resented being subjects of a
Muslim leader, demanded the abolition of the emirate and the
creation of their own chiefdom. The moment seemed right: Nigeria
was on its way toward the end of military rule and a civilian
government might listen to their aspirations.
</P>
<P>
   Tense negotiations ensued between the Muslim supporters of the
emirate and the indigenous people, who belong to several ethnic
groups and are mostly Christian or animist.
</P>
<P>
   Then an unexpected announcement in May that the emir's
28-year-old son would be installed in a succession ceremony
shattered the fragile peace in Kafanchan. Just days before Olusegun
Obasanjo became Nigeria's first civilian president in a generation,
scores of people on both sides were killed and corpses were left
smoldering in the town center. During a weekend of fury, tree
leaves that are traditional signs of protest gave way quickly to
bows and arrows and machetes and semiautomatic rifles.
</P>
<P>
   The clashes here, like the ethnic violence that has erupted
elsewhere across Nigeria in recent months, were rooted in a
struggle over political dominance. As the imminent installation of
a civilian government raised Nigerians' expectations, ethnic
clashes multiplied, and they risk increasing now that power has
been handed over from the military.
</P>
<P>
   In a country with as many as 400 ethnic groups, where decades of
colonial and military rule reinforced the belief that each group is
being oppressed by another, it was perhaps inevitable that
fashioning some sort of social unity in Nigeria would be one of the
biggest challenges facing Obasanjo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The emirate system was used to suppress us,'' said Abednego
Majidadi, 52, a farmer here. ``That is why we resisted. We hope
that the present regime can do something better because we are now
in a democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   As if to underscore that hope and the social instability it
entails, a new wave of violence swept the Niger Delta region a day
after Obasanjo's inauguration on May 29. In the oil city of Warri,
scores are believed to have died since then in fighting among three
ethnic groups. The groups, especially the Ijaw and Itsekiri, have
been fighting intensely since fall over land claims and the
location of a local government.
</P>
<P>
   From the southwest to the southeast, from the central area known
as the middlebelt to the north, people of different ethnic
backgrounds have confronted one another. Sometimes the fighting has
even pitted different subsets of a large ethnic group, like the
Ibo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unity does not exist in Nigeria,'' said Ado Mohammed Gawuna,
35, a Hausa politician. ``We just mouth it. Any Yoruba man I will
not agree with. In no matter will I call a Yoruba man a brother. I
will call him a Nigerian only in geographic terms.''
</P>
<P>
   Two men belonging to Nigeria's two other big ethnic groups _
Francis Ike, 27, an Ibo, and Olutayo Aro, 32, a Yoruba _ stood next
to Gawuna as he spoke to a reporter and they said they were
unwilling to abandon the idea of a united Nigeria. ``If this
government is good, Nigeria can exist,'' Ike said, throwing in
effect a challenge to the country's new civilian politicians.
</P>
<P>
   During the riots here in Kafanchan, neighborhoods were
ransacked, Muslim houses set aflame, non-Muslim ones left
untouched. Protesters stormed the emir's palace and burned down
parts of it, forcing the son, Muhammadu Isa Muhammadu, to flee on
his coronation day.
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers now stand in front of the emir's palace and throughout
the town, preserving stability at gunpoint. The Muslims, who are
Hausa, and the indigenous people blame each other for igniting the
violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I begin to wonder if they are any different from the pigs they
rear,'' Magaji Mande, 45, deputy secretary to the emir's son, said
of the natives, who are mostly farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the indigenous people regard the Hausa as an
occupying force. The Hausa came here two centuries ago and
established the emirate. The emir's reach has extended over a
region called Jema'a, whose center is Kafanchan and where the Hausa
make up only about 10 percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
   Its territorial lines drawn by British colonialists in 1914,
Nigeria stands now as Africa's most populous nation, bringing
together more than 110 million people with many more divisions than
commonalities. Over the decades, British colonialists and Nigerian
military rulers retained control over such a large, diverse and
unruly land by pitting ethnic groups against one another.
</P>
<P>
   They also succeeded in keeping their grip by leaving local
control in the hands of traditional rulers, like the obas, or
kings, in the south, and the emirs in the north. The traditional
rulers, who have no official powers, still hold tremendous
influence over their subjects, a point underlined during February's
presidential elections, when campaigning amounted to visiting local
rulers instead of individual voters.
</P>
<P>
   But as this town makes clear, the role of traditional rulers
will come under increasing scrutiny and challenge in the new
Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hausa settled on our land when they conquered us and
imposed the emirate on us,'' said Nathaniel Biya, 56, a lawyer and
village elder. His village lies a few miles from the town center
and is home to the Kaninkon people. It is known in the region as
Ungwar-Bako, a name given to the villagers by the Hausa; it means
village of the black people, a reminder that Islam was spread in
sub-Saharan Africa by northerners of lighter complexion. Among the
Kaninkon, though, the village is called Gakyop, or village of rich
grass.
</P>
<P>
   No one in the village seemed to know when it was founded, though
the Kaninkon say they have been in the area for centuries, well
before the arrival of the Hausa in the early 1800s. Over the years,
Biya said, the emirate's control had eroded; a quiet resistance
took shape, as the villagers, for instance, began refusing to
donate grain to the emir.
</P>
<P>
   After two centuries, the Hausa are thus still considered
foreigners by the locals. Almost nine decades after the creation of
Nigeria and three decades after independence, there is no sense
here yet, or in other areas where there have been ethnic clashes,
that as citizens of Nigeria, people can resettle anywhere in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a Nigerian,'' Biya said. ``They are Nigerians, but they
have their own land somewhere. They don't belong in this place.''

KAFANCHAN, Nigeria: this place.' ' 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   So after the emir's death in November, the Kaninkon and other
indigenous groups here began pressing the state government to
create a chiefdom for them.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, talks between the Hausa and the indigenous
people had gone well enough that they had agreed to permit the
emirate to remain here, though its reach would be curtailed to the
Muslim areas. In return, the indigenous people would be represented
by a recognized chief. But the negotiations stalled over the rank
that the chief would enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the spirit of self-determination let them have their own
chiefdom,'' said Mande, the emir's deputy secretary. ``But these
tribes were making impossible demands to be on the same level as
the emir.''
</P>
<P>
   For reasons that are unclear, the state's military administrator
at the time, a Hausa, pre-empted the conclusion of talks by
announcing that the coronation of the emir's son would occur on May
22, a week before Nigeria's military government was scheduled to
yield power.
</P>
<P>
   On that morning, the indigenous people carried leaves as a
traditional sign of protest and set up roadblocks on the three
roads leading to Kafanchan, forcing the military administrator's
motorcade to turn around.
</P>
<P>
   The Hausa fear they would be unprotected without the emirate.
``If the emirate is abolished,'' said Suleiman Musa, 27, whose
father died after being set on fire, ``what will we, the Hausa, do?
Where will we be?''
</P>
<P>
   In the rioting that ensued, several mosques were set alight. In
this country with so many fissures, ethnicity and regionalism
represent the main ones, although religion is often used to widen
the divisions for political purposes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it started as a problem over the emirate,'' said
Mohammed Ndleman, 55, a Hausa and civil servant, standing before
the ruins of his house. ``But now I think it is a religious
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Bashir Idris, 31, shook his head as he showed off the remains of
his house and his children played amid the rubble.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government must consider the requests of every community
in Nigeria and treat them accordingly,'' Idris said. ``It is the
only way that everyone will feel part of this country.''
</P>
<P>
   It will not be easy, given the sometimes bewilderingly complex
nature of Nigerian society.
</P>
<P>
   On the morning of the riots, some Kaninkon invaded a block where
Muslims live next to Christians, stopping in front of a pink house.
The house belonged to Abdul Karim Yahaya, 45, a member of the
Kaninkon group, but a Muslim convert.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people said, `Don't burn it. He's our son,' '' Yahaya
recalled the rioters debating. ``Other people said, `He's Muslim.
Burn down the house!'''
</P>
<P>
   In this particular case, on this particular morning, for this
particular man, blood proved stronger than religion. Save a porch
light blown out by a bullet, the house still stood.

VAST WINTERTIME HAZE IS FOUND OVER THE INDIAN OCEAN 
</HEADLINE>

 By WILLIAM K. STEVENS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scientists have discovered to their surprise that a haze of air
pollution about the size of the United States covers the Indian
Ocean in the wintertime, and they say it may have important
implications for global climate and the regional environment of
both Asia and the tropical ocean.
</P>
<P>
   The brownish haze is composed of several kinds of minute
byproducts from the burning of fossil fuels for industry and
transportation. The scientists say these elements, including soot
and sulfur droplets, are blown out over the ocean from the Indian
subcontinent, China and Southeast Asia during the winter monsoon,
when prevailing winds sweep down from the Himalayas and out to sea.
</P>
<P>
   In the late spring and summer, the experts say, the winds
reverse as part of the summer monsoon and blow the haze back across
the land, where it combines with monsoon rains and falls out of the
atmosphere as acid rain. The summer monsoon is now under way,
although the scientists said they had no direct evidence of how the
haze was currently being affected.
</P>
<P>
   They do know that it persisted over the ocean, from the Bay of
Bengal and the Arabian Sea southward past the Equator, throughout
six weeks of intensive scientific surveillance by aircraft, ships,
balloons, satellites and land stations in February and March.
</P>
<P>
   The results were announced on Tuesday by the National Science
Foundation, which sponsored the $25 million project in part, and
the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appeared as if the whole Indian subcontinent was surrounded
by a mountain of pollution,'' said Veerabhadran Ramanathan, the
director of Scripps' Center for Clouds, Chemistry and Climate,
which coordinated the project. Ramanathan and Paul J. Crutzen,
director of the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry, in Germany, are
the co-chiefs of the research project.
</P>
<P>
   The cloud of atmospheric aerosols, as the tiny particles and
droplets of pollution are called, has at least two important
implications for the environment: The acid rain it produces may
harm both terrestrial and marine life, and the aerosols alter the
earth's climate by reflecting solar radiation and thereby cooling
the part of the earth beneath the haze. The new findings are sure
to complicate experts' efforts to pin down whatever influence human
activity is having on global climate.
</P>
<P>
   Industrial aerosols have long been known to affect North America
and Europe, where most of the earth's industry has been
concentrated. Scientists believe that aerosols are diminishing over
those two continents as a result of environmental controls, but
aerosol emissions have been increasing in Asia as industry grows
there, and that growth is expected to continue.
</P>
<P>
   Globally, the cooling aerosols have combined with heat-trapping
greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide to help produce a crazy-quilt
pattern of human-induced climatic change. Like the aerosols,
greenhouse gases are produced by industrial and transportation
combustion, and scientists say they tend to warm the planet as a
whole while aerosols cool some regions. Greenhouse gases generally
persist in the atmosphere for decades or even centuries, while
aerosols can rain out of the atmosphere in only a few days.
</P>
<P>
   The persistence of the Indian Ocean haze, its extent and its
thickness were all surprises, Ramanathan said in an interview. It
covered about 3.8 million square miles, roughly the combined area
of the 50 states. While industrial aerosols in Europe and America
are generally confined to within 2,000 feet of the earth's surface,
he said, those observed above the Indian Ocean rose to about 10,000
feet, far higher although still below, say, the cruising altitude
of commercial airliners.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary results of measurements, Ramanathan said, indicate
that the aerosols reflected enough sunlight to reduce the amount of
solar energy absorbed by the ocean by about 10 percent. This, in
turn, means that less water will evaporate from the sea, producing
less rainfall.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, some of the aerosols are sucked up by huge
thunderstorms that characterize the equatorial region and are then
mixed with water and deposited in the ocean as acid rain, which
could affect marine life. Some of these equatorial aerosols may
also be transported by high-level winds to other parts of the
world, Ramanathan said, but this has not been established.
</P>
<P>
   A complicating factor, he said, is that because of incomplete
combustion, the haze has an unusually high proportion of soot. Soot
is dark, and absorbs solar radiation. This would tend to counteract
the cooling effect of lighter, liquid aerosols that reflect
sunlight.
</P>
<P>
   ``So,'' Ramanathan said, ``it is just too early to say at this
point whether the net effect is one of cooling or warming.''

NEXT CHALLENGE: RECLAIMING KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN YEMMA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Historians won't remember June 9, 1999, as another VE Day _ a
time of global rejoicing after a long, bloody war. Nor will it even
have the same feel-good quality as Feb. 28, 1991, when the lopsided
Gulf War ended and President Bush exulted that America had ``kicked
the Vietnam syndrome once and for all.''
</P>
<P>
   But the signing of the troop withdrawal agreement in Kumanovo,
Macedonia, on Wednesday at least is expected to bring an end to 2
1/2 months of unrelenting NATO bombing and the untold terrorization
of thousands of ethnic Albanians by Serb forces.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes Chapter 2: reclaiming Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as Thursday, NATO will begin moving into the province to
try to prevent a power vacuum as Serb forces withdraw. US and other
allied soldiers will have to disarm thousands of mines and booby
traps and neutralize unexploded NATO bombs that litter the
countryside. Up to 600,000 frightened, wounded, and hungry
civilians will be coming out of the woods and in need of critical
care.
</P>
<P>
   What's ahead in Kosovo will be a complex process of rescue and
rebuilding that doubtless will be complicated by the continued
machinations of President Slobodan Milosevic and his
ultra-nationalist backers in Serbia proper as they seek some way of
demonstrating that they did not lose. How peaceful the NATO
occupation will be is one of many questions that will be raised in
this new chapter in the centuries-old struggle over Kosovo. Among
others:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; When will the refugees return?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Pessimistic that 783,000 Kosovars who have fled to Albania,
Macedonia, Montenegro, and Bosnia will have homes to return to, the
UN High Commissioner for Refugees is preparing to winterize refugee
camps in those countries. In addition, relief workers will have to
set up new camps inside Kosovo to house the internally displaced.
Because homes have been destroyed and crops ruined, most Kosovars _
whether Albanian or Serb _ will be unable to survive without
massive aid. The first large organized return of refugees will not
occur until next spring, although refugee specialists say that some
Kosovar Albanians will trickle back on their own before then.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Will the people of Yugoslavia be punished economically while
Milosevic stays in power?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  They probably will not be denied humanitarian assistance,
which means that food and medicine could soon be arriving in
Yugoslavia via the Red Cross and sympathetic people in Russia,
Greece, and other parts of Europe. But American and European
leaders have vowed that official western aid to rebuild the
bomb-damaged bridges, highways, factories, offices, and homes will
not flow into Yugoslavia if Milosevic remains in power. This might
be an incentive for Yugoslavs to try to oust Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Will Milosevic and his lieutenants be tried for war crimes?
</P>
<P>
   Only if he can be captured, and that depends on whether he
remains in power. While there is much talk about opposition
politicians trying to bring him down, Milosevic has survived
numerous threats in the past, including mass demonstrations in
1996. In fact, his ethnic pot-stirring which led to wars in
Croatia, Bosnia, and Kosovo was largely about kindling a cause _
Serb nationalism _ that would help the onetime communist leader
survive in a post-communist era. Despite his losses in those
campaigns, he may still prove difficult to dislodge. Though there
are arrest warrants out for him in almost every country, as long as
he stays in office, he has the army of Yugoslavia to insulate him
from apprehension for trial.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; How long will American and European troops need to remain in
Kosovo?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  The 48,000-strong Kosovo Force, or KFOR, under NATO command
will have a 7,000-member US component. A force of a similar size
was deployed in Bosnia in 1995 on what was originally billed as a
one-year peacekeeping mission. Without such a force in place,
Serb-Albanian conflict almost certainly will resume, especially if
Albanian nationalists continue to agitate for independence from
Yugoslavia. Expect a stay well into the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Will the ethnic Serbs in Kosovo be safe from retaliation? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Throughout history, the Balkans have been known for vengeance
killings. Many of the murders that occurred during the conflicts of
the 1990s involved settling scores from the fractious era of Nazi
occupation in World War II. Knowing that they are imperiled, ethnic
Serbs have been leaving Kosovo since the first days of conflict.
Belgrade claims 60,000 have fled since March 24, when the air war
began. More will depart along with Serb forces. Many are twice
displaced: Driven out of Croatia in 1995, they were resettled in
Kosovo in an attempt to change the ethnic balance of the province.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Will the Kosovo Liberation Army be a benign police force for
Kosovoor carry on a guerrilla war that vexes NATO?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  If the KLA can transform itself from a guerrilla army into a
peacetime security force much as the Palestine Liberation
Organization has done in the Middle East, it will go a long way
toward creating the kind of civil structures that an independent _
or at least an autonomous _ Kosovo would need.

   FAITH HILL
</P>
<P>
   Home base: Born in Star, Miss.; now lives in Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   Age: 31.
</P>
<P>
   Claim to fame: Babe country singer with red-hot single ``This
Kiss,'' and an upcoming concert.
</P>
<P>
   Interesting factoid: Faith Hill is married to country singer Tim
McGraw. They have two daughters, Gracie Katherine, 2, and Maggie
Elizabeth, 8 months.
</P>
<P>
   The story so far: Faith Hill could be described as the queen of
Nashville right now. Since 1993, when she released her debut disc,
``Take Me As I Am,'' she has won countless industry awards, sold
millions of records and, most recently, appeared in VH1's Divas
Live concert, which also featured pop heavyweights Tina Turner and
Whitney Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Great ``Kiss'': Her recent spate of success, Hill will be the
first to admit, is mostly thanks to her single, ``This Kiss,''
which has crossed over to pop-music territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``This song has changed my career,'' Hill said in a recent news
service interview. ``VH1 never would have invited me to Divas Live
before this.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill says that even though she's scheduled to be all over
country and pop radio, conquering pop music is not her goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not seeking a pop career,'' she says. ``But if it happens,
great. I'm just going to make music that comes from my heart. If it
works someplace else, I'll welcome it.''
</P>

   LODE RUNNER 3-D (Infogrames/Big Bang Software for Nintendo 64,
all ages)
</P>
<P>
   Description: Lode Runner 3-D is a fun and educational mind
puzzle. It challenges body, mind and soul while entertaining you
with terrific 3-D graphics.
</P>
<P>
   High points: A high point with Lode Runner 3-D is that it has
five different worlds, with five different stages and four levels
in each stage. Another high point is that beginners can practice an
easy level before going on to a more challenging and complicated
level.
</P>
<P>
   Low points: A low point about Lode Runner is that after a
certain amount of time it tends to get boring. Also, the music
starts to get on your nerves and you have to turn the volume down.
Another low point is that if you die or restart a level (which you
commonly do) it takes quite a while to load.
</P>
<P>
   At times, it was very mind-bogglin'. But its low points keep you
from coming back for more.
</P>
<P>
   Reviewer's A - F rating: C.
</P>
<P>
   KEN GRIFFEY JR.'S SLUGFEST (Nintendo for Nintendo 64, all ages)
</P>
<P>
   Description: Nintendo's popular baseball series graduates to the
Nintendo 64 _ with great results.
</P>
<P>
   High points: The graphics are excellent _ wonderfully detailed
and pinpoint accurate. Use an Expansion Pak, sold separately, and
they're better. Also, most of the players, teams and stadiums are
here, and the controls are easy to understand and maneuver.
</P>
<P>
   Low points: Slugfest doesn't have all the options as some of the
PlayStation baseball games do, and Nintendo's attempts at creating
realism often fail. Example: While playing a game at the Ballpark
at Arlington, players hear a train roar by. Is there a railroad
near the Ballpark we don't know about?
</P>
<P>
   But Slugfest has great graphics and fluid gameplay. It's easily
one of the better baseball games out there right now.
</P>
<P>
   Reviewer's A - F rating: A minus.

CD REVIEW: BACKSTREET BOYS' MILLENNIUM 
 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 
 FROM THE FORT WORTH STAR-TELEGRAM
</HEADLINE>
  World rights.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Is Backstreet really back? They certainly are with their new CD
``Millennium,'' which features their current hit single, ``I Want
It That Way.''
</P>
<P>
   The CD shows how much these boys have matured over the last
year.
</P>
<P>
   The songs are no longer just sunny pop but hip-hop dance music
and heart-melting love ballads. If you're into songs that make you
want to go hug someone, then you'll like ``The Perfect Fan,'' a
tribute to their mothers.
</P>
<P>
   If you aren't the sentimental type, you might like the
move-your-body track, ``Larger Than Life.'' This song is both sweet
and great to dance to; it thanks the fans but also tells about the
down side of success, all the while keeping you moving.
</P>
<P>
   So unless you really hate the Backstreet Boys, I recommend you
get down to the nearest store and pick up ``Millennium,'' even if
it is just for the cover pictures.

ADVICE ABOUT STEALING FROM MOM, NIGHT TRIPS 
 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 
 FROM THE FORT WORTH STAR-TELEGRAM
</HEADLINE>

 Copyright 1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR TeensTalk: Last month when my mother wasn't looking, I took
her credit card from her purse to buy some clothes at the mall. I
went shopping and bought some clothes. She got the statement and
realized I took the card.
</P>
<P>
   My parents have grounded me and accused me of stealing the card
and money. Occasionally, I have taken a few dollars out of my mom's
purse, but never any large bills. I don't understand the big deal.
They're making me out to be some kind of criminal. Criminal.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR Criminal: You had better learn from this or you will be a
criminal. You are lucky your parents care enough to discipline you
and teach you right from wrong. If you had done this to someone
else, they could have pressed charges.
</P>
<P>
   Don't ever take things that don't belong to you, including stuff
from your parents. They have provided you with a home, food and
clothing. You need to respect their belongings and ask for money if
you need it. Don't just assume it's yours or that it's OK to take
it.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR TeensTalk: I snuck out of the house recently and got
grounded. My best friend talked me into sneaking out with him and a
bunch of other kids. It was fun until I got busted!
</P>
<P>
   When I got back home my parents were waiting up. I got grounded
for two months. What can I do to get my life back? Grounded.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR Grounded: The punishment apparently fits this crime. When
you snuck out of the house you lost the confidence of your parents.
Now you must work hard to gain that trust back again.
</P>
<P>
   Start by utilizing these two months as a communication bridge
between you and your parents. Offer to do special chores around the
house, from cleaning out the garage to watching your siblings if
you have any.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe these good behavior acts will get your parents to reduce
the two months of ground time.

GUN FAIR SEEKS TO EDUCATE BUYERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRETT PAULY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORCO, Calif. _ ``Would you buy a suit without trying it on?''
</P>
<P>
   Of course not, said Los Angeles County Sheriff's reserve deputy
Susan Casabella, answering her own question. Unfortunately, she
said, seldom can one try a firearm for target practice before
buying it. You can test-drive a Buick, but it's probably illegal to
test out a Beretta behind the gun shop.
</P>
<P>
   Things were different Friday during the first day of the
weekend-long Shooting Sports Fair at Mike Raahauge's Shooting
Sports ranges in Western Riverside County. The unique annual event
allows visitors to shoulder, handle and fire new lines of pistols,
rifles and shotguns.
</P>
<P>
   Stressing safety, education, convenience and ``good, clean fun''
to an estimated 15,000 fairgoers, the fair serves to ease a buyer's
concerns over whether a gun is right for them by going straight to
the source _ manufacturers' reps. One can ask about their products
and shoot them at clay targets for a nominal fee, from $1 for 10
rounds of .22-caliber rifle bullets to $5 for three .50-caliber
handgun rounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a recreational point of view, guns are expensive,''
Casabella said. ``You might as well try them first.''
</P>
<P>
   With so many variables in the purchasing process, that's sage
advice, said Scott La Rue, a Redondo Beach sports shooter employed
in the aerospace industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to know how the firearm is going to fit your hand and
body, how it is going to act as far as recoil is concerned, the
overall finish and the way you are going to shoot with that
particular gun,'' he said. ``I've repeatedly bought firearms that
I've went on the sell because they just didn't fit me right and
just couldn't hit (targets) right and I wasn't comfortable with
that gun.''
</P>
<P>
   Being able to try before you buy _ even just five attentive
pulls on a weapon's trigger _ might provide some answers, La Rue
explained: ``This is the best sporting event that is available to
us shooters. Going out and having hands-on use of each gun, it's
really a special event for us.''
</P>
<P>
   You'll still have to go back to the gun shop to make your
purchase, but you might have a better handle on what you want.
Unlike increasingly controversial gun shows, firearms sales are
prohibited at the Shooting Sports Fair.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's important,'' said Bob Adams of Coburns Wholesale in
Fontana, which sells ammunition, shooting accessories and reloading
supplies. ``I think there is a perception that people have that
we're selling guns out of the trunks of our cars to people in
parks, and we don't do that. This is to have fun; I've never seen
anything like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams was manning a women's and youth shooting booth geared to
introduce newcomers to target shooting, which is considered by many
a dying recreation in a world where gun violence is rampant and
hunting isn't viewed with the same reverence as it once was.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the sport has got to be more inclusive,'' Adams said.
``It's got to include everybody, because it's traditionally been
marketed toward males. We need to get other people interested in
the sport if it's going to survive.''
</P>
<P>
   Briyana Negrette walked away from the booth after hitting seven
of 10 rifle targets. Not bad considering she's 7 years old.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was fun,'' said the ``veteran'' Garden Grove shooter who
handled the .22-caliber Ruger with confidence. ``When you shoot,
you hit the yellow things (targets).''
</P>
<P>
   Briyana's siblings, Jason, 9, and Jessica, 11, would take their
turns shortly afterward. ``It's good for anybody who owns firearms
to bring their kids out here,'' said their father, Rick Negrette.
``Good familiarization. Good environment for the kids to come out,
take part and get used to what Dad likes to do, and, maybe,
hopefully, what Mom wouldn't mind coming down and doing.''
</P>
<P>
   The aroma of gunpowder was thick on this breezy day deep in
dairy country; like salt air, the smell sticks with you a long
time. The olfactory sensation brought back memories of my
adolescent days in Oregon, plinking cans in the woods with younger
brothers.
</P>
<P>
   When I picked up and fired Winchester's newest Model .94
lever-action .30-30 rifle, I harkened back to a turn-of-the-century
smokeless black powder version of the same gun with which we would
shoot at bull's eyes. To encourage parity, Dad suggested the paper
targets be staggered at varying distances; the older the brother,
the farther away they were set up.
</P>
<P>
   A family tradition, shooting brought me and my siblings closer
as our confidence, experience, trust and intrigue over such
in-depth technical aspects as velocity and trajectory blossomed.
</P>
<P>
   Gun (begin ital)un(end ital)enthusiasts won't relate, but target
practice is a recreational outlet, much like golfing or bowling or
even fishing, that promotes camaraderie and friendly competition
and often creates bonds that last a lifetime. It certainly appeared
as if those sentiments were being shared on this afternoon. &QL;

OPPOSITION LEADER FULL OF PROMISE, CONTRADICTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE _ The day before Yugoslavia effectively surrendered to
NATO, Vuk Draskovic sat in his office, stroking his beard, already
plotting the future.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, in the hallway of the spacious headquarters of his
Serbian Renewal Movement, boxes of campaign literature were stacked
up, ready to go, even though there is no campaign yet.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic, however, is ready. And he says Serbia and the rest of
Yugoslavia is ready once and for all to end its string of futile
wars, to return to the fold of the international community that has
burdened it with economic sanctions and, for more than two months,
blasted it with bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's grip on power has been
weakened by his capitulation to NATO. But whether Milosevic
resigns, which is unlikely, or is pushed aside depends on the
ability of this country's notoriously divided opposition to put
forward a candidate who can beat him.
</P>
<P>
   As head of the biggest opposition party in Serbia, Draskovic is
frequently mentioned as one politician who could replace Milosevic.
While many praise Draskovic's blunt and often courageous honesty,
they just as often bemoan his unpredictability and volatility.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic, a 52-year-old writer-turned-politician, embodies all
of Serbia's promise and contradictions. At one moment he is
preaching the virtues of democracy with the passion of a true
believer. Then he digresses into nationalist rhetoric and
reinforces the paralyzing perception of victimhood here, calling
Serbs ``the new Jews of Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   A fervent anticommunist, he advocates the establishment of a
constitutional monarchy and return of the Yugoslav royal family
from exile.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic has publicly called for Milosevic's ouster on many
occasions and led street protests demanding his resignation. Yet
last January, Draskovic joined Milosevic's cabinet as a deputy
prime minister. He said he wanted to change the government from
within. His critics say he sold out.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is no denying Draskovic's charisma, his ability to
attract and inspire an audience, or his bravery in a political
culture where there are few examples of people willing to incur the
wrath of Milosevic's shadowy, heavy-handed police.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, he was jailed for four days for leading protests
demanding a free press. In 1993, he spent 46 days in prison after
he organized demonstrations against the forced expulsions by Serb
forces in Bosnia. He was beaten regularly and went on a hunger
strike.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, Draskovic was the first member of Milosevic's
government to publicly suggest that the country should cut its
losses by allowing an armed international peacekeeping force into
Kosovo under the auspices of the United Nations. Milosevic fired
him for such temerity.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Milosevic has accepted what Draskovic was urging more
than a month ago, Draskovic's stock with ordinary people has risen,
even as many remain skeptical that he could or should replace
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   People here still speak with admiration for how Draskovic stood
before tens of thousands of people and dared to say that Bosnian
Serb forces, backed by the Belgrade government, were killing and
expelling Muslims and Croatians. His wife, Danica, also spoke out,
dramatically challenging the government's denials by noting that
her Muslim friend, and maid of honor at her wedding, had been one
of those expelled.
</P>
<P>
   But many here who want a more open society can't quite bring
themselves to say that Draskovic is the best candidate to replace
Milosevic and bring Yugoslavia back into the embrace of the
international community, even if they can't think of one better
positioned to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Zarko Korac, who leads a small opposition party and is also a
psychologist, said Draskovic is a tough read, both politically and
psychologically.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a genuine pro-western nationalist. I think he genuinely
believes that he is the bridge to the west,'' says Korac. ``The
trouble with him is his ups and downs, his inconsistency. It
borders on being emotionally unstable, which is not good for a
politician.''
</P>
<P>
   The ultranationalist Serbian Radical Party, whose leader,
Vojislav Seslj, is positioning himself to challenge Milosevic,
claiming that Milosevic sold out the Serb people by giving in to
NATO, clearly fears Draskovic. The party's magazine routinely
depicts Draskovic as a drug addict, with cartoon caricatures of
Draskovic with needles sticking in his arms in every issue.
</P>
<P>
   Many democracy activists here, meanwhile, privately express
concerns about Draskovic's former close friendship with Seslj.
Draskovic and Seslj were best men at each other's weddings, but
have since had a falling out. But some see them as being cut from
the same demagogue cloth.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Draskovic insisted that his brand of
``democratic nationalism'' is far more constructive than the
``negative nationalism'' of Milosevic and Seslj, which is
authoritarian and antiwestern.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democratic Serbian nationalism is healthy nationalism,
fighting for the interest of the nation but not against other
states,'' he said. ``Democratic Serbian nationalism means the
project for establishing democratic institutions, a non-ideological
army and police, private property as a basis of the economy, a free
media, a non-ideological justice system. It can transform Serbia
into a European state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Destructive Serbian nationalism is fighting for isolation, to
keep Serbia separated from Europe and the USA. It means the
promotion of the US and Europe as traditional enemies. It's a
program based on the sovereignty of the last century.''
</P>
<P>
   He said a democratic Serbia must respect and accommodate the 26
ethnic groups living in the country. He calls ``ethnic cleansing''
_ a term coined by Serbs to refer to the forced removal of a
different ethnic group _ ``a crime against humanity.'' But he says
it must be looked at in a historical context, and that Serbs have
been victimized just as ethnic Albanians were in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, Draskovic advocated that those who refused to formally
declare allegiance to the Serbian government be expelled from
Kosovo. ``The war between Serbs and Albanians will be very short,''
he said at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, Draskovic is more conciliatory. He admits that
some Serb forces ``committed crimes while expelling Albanians,''
but insists that most refugees fled on their own or on the
instructions of the Kosovo Liberation Army, which wanted to create
a humanitarian disaster to galvanize international support for
their cause.
</P>
<P>
   He says that, on his recommendation, Milosevic authorized the
arrest of any Serb forces who overstepped their authority in
Kosovo, and claims that more than 400 were arrested before he was
thrown out of the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``My duty is to demand that any Serb who committed atrocities,
crimes against civilians, must be prosecuted. It is the only way to
protect our national face and tradition,'' he said. ``I would hope
terrorists and killers on all sides would be prosecuted.''
</P>
<P>
   In that list, he includes the NATO generals who killed hundreds
of innocent Serb civilians in more than two months of airstrikes.
He said at least 140 members of his party have been among the
victims. A family friend, 16-year-old Sanja Milenkovic, was killed
when NATO bombed a bridge just days after Draskovic gave her one of
his novels to read as she prepared for a mathematics competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I learned Sanja was killed, I almost cried,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But with the hostilities winding down, Draskovic is the only
politician here openly calling for reconciliation with the west.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic said his grandfather, Peter Draskovic, was a gold
miner in California who left the promise of America to return home
to fight during World War I. His father was a partisan who fought
the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   ``My grandfather's last words to me were `Always love America.'
I'm not so brave that I could go to his grave and tell him, `Look
what America has done to us,' '''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he believes the development of democracy in Serbia, and a
willingness by the West to embrace the longtime pariah of the
international community, is the only hope for his country. He also
hints at more street protests and mounting a challenge to
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that when the war stops, we have a big political
fight,'' he says. ``I will be out there the first day the bombing
stops.''

ROCK-CLIMBING PROGRAM TEACHES GIRLS TO SCALE ALL SORTS OF HURDLES

 By ROBERT L. JAMIESON JR.  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Saleemeh's spirit is willing. But her body won't leave
the table.
</P>
<P>
   Her feet shuffle. Her eyes show fear. Her lips purse.
</P>
<P>
   The seventh-grader stands at the edge of the waist-high table.
She could fall backward, like an Olympic diver pushing off a
platform. Or she could just give in to fear and step down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh my goooooosh!'' she opines, her arms crossed. ``I'm
scared!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Fall, stay straight, like a board,'' a buddy yells. ``You can
do it!''
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, OK,'' Saleemeh huffs. ``One ... two ... three ... I'm
falling!!!''
</P>
<P>
   She lands, face up, in a safety net formed by the outstretched
arms of her friends. Everyone whoops and claps and pats her on the
back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Piece of cake!'' she trumpets, flashing a grin at her
breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of numbers, Saleemeh Razaghzadeh's fall was small _ 4
feet. In words, the distance could be described as larger than
life.
</P>
<P>
   The plunge, known as a ``Trust Fall,'' builds confidence and a
sense of teamwork that she and nine other girls share in Girls
Rock!, _ a Seattle -based program run by the non-profit group
Passages Northwest, which teaches them how to rock climb.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson in trust is vital. On a real rock climb _ away from
the indoor Vertical World in Seattle where they practice _ the
girls may need to help each other, or strangers. And that way of
thinking carries over into life.
</P>
<P>
   For the past nine weeks, the girls have believed in each other,
studied rock wall surfaces with each other, tied complex rope knots
next to each other, fastened safety harnesses for each other and
giggled _ a lot _ among themselves.
</P>
<P>
   They climbed, too.
</P>
<P>
   But they have not laughed or learned just among themselves. The
program matches the girls, some of whom are from underprivileged
backgrounds, with climbing volunteers. Those adult mentors come
from professional and academic backgrounds, including education,
medicine and business. They share their rock-climbing prowess, aura
of confidence and brain power with the girls.
</P>
<P>
   The girls, in turn, set manageable goals to improve their own
scaling skills and get quite a workout. They also say the program
readies them for life's looming mountains: the pre-adolescent
hurdles brought on by dawning sexual anxiety, peer pressure and
self-doubt, which many young women face.
</P>
<P>
   In combination, those hurdles can prove so powerful that some
young people have dubbed their not-so-wonder years ``Triple-A'' _
agony, alienation and acne.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not easy, especially middle school,'' sighs Girl Rocker
Sarah Futhey, an articulate 12-year-old who goes to Eckstein Middle
School in Seattle. ``In my school there are huge popularity
contests. Who can be the best? Who can wear the nicest clothes? I
was never in the `in' group. I'm not into that.
</P>
<P>
   ``But watching the other girls here climb huge walls and go for
the gusto makes me want to do that. When you come to climb, you
don't have to be popular. You just have to believe in yourself, try
and have a good time and meet your goals,'' Sarah adds, before
dashing off for a practice climb.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I ever meet a challenging situation in life, I know I can
approach it like a climb _ step by step.''
</P>
<P>
   Program organizers know well the shoes in which the girls are
walking.
</P>
<P>
   Girls Rock! director Rana Betting recalled her preadolescent
years as being one of the most difficult phases of her life.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Betting, who has been climbing for seven years, gets
pleasure from being part of an organization that helps girls feel
less awkward than she did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I had had something like this when I was young,'' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   Few would dispute the difficulty girls face holding onto
positive self-images. Pundits, feminist scholars and developmental
psychologists point to cultural sources _ the media, films, music,
advertising, the Internet _ that bombard girls with difficult,
sometimes confusing messages.
</P>
<P>
   Thin females are held up as having the paragon body type in pop
culture; sexual promiscuity in music and films tells kids they are
cool if they ``do it''; girls even receive subtle messages about
how _ or if _ to use brain power. Barbie dolls once chirped, ``Math
class is tough!''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, boys also suffer in their preadolescent years. But
long-standing research has shown the pronounced impacts girls face
living in a patriarchal society.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Gilligan, founder of the Harvard Project on Women's
Psychology and Girls' Development, conducted groundbreaking work
during the 1980s and '90s that showed while adolescent girls start
off promisingly, they fail to fulfill their potential.
</P>
<P>
   Girls make good progress in their early preteen years, around
the ages of 8 and 9, when their behaviors are confident and
outspoken. As they near adolescence, however, they become tentative
and conformist. They start to doubt their moral convictions and
lose self-confidence, Gilligan found.
</P>
<P>
   For some girls, the negative feelings can cause grades to slip.
Studies have shown girls typically become less academically driven
in math and science in late elementary school or early junior high
school.
</P>
<P>
   Downcast feelings can lapse into depression or spin the girls
into harmful behaviors, including eating disorders, drug use and
suicidal thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Pipher, the best-selling author of ``Reviving Ophelia,''
which deals with self-esteem issues among young women, believes
girls are coming of age in a sexualized and media-saturated
society. They become disheartened by America's ``girl-poisoning
culture'' and at puberty ``crash into junk culture,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Annie Lareau survived her ``crash,'' but wanted to be sure
others could avoid collisions altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't believe I was smart when I was that age,'' says
Lareau, 31, who dreamed of a theater career when she was young.
``The feeling was, if you are dumb, then you go and act. I felt
that as a girl. ... My grades suffered.''
</P>
<P>
   Lareau went on to college, where mentors nurtured her passion
for the stage, and she thrived academically. After college, she was
in Boston working in an all-female workshop of ``Henry V'' _ ``I
was Henry'' _ when she met Gilligan.
</P>
<P>
   That encounter inspired Lareau to pursue a master's degree in
education at Harvard, where she eventually studied under Gilligan.
</P>
<P>
   Lareau later moved to Seattle. In 1996, she and a friend, who
directed a science program at the University of Washington, got
together to launch Passages Northwest, a non-profit organization
promoting arts and wilderness education for girls and women.
</P>
<P>
   Passages Northwest branched into backpacking tours; next came
mother-daughter rope courses, followed by sea kayaking and
backpacking courses. In the spring of 1998, she collaborated with
Rebecca Bear, a Seattle educator, and they decided it was time for
girls to rock, but they weren't thinking about a band.
</P>
<P>
   Passages runs on an annual budget of $100,000, about $35,000 of
which is for Girls Rock! The program relies on financial donations
to keep going, primarily because most of the girls who participate
get a scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   The current class of Girl Rockers comes from various
backgrounds. Saleemeh, for example, was born in Iran and moved to
the United States with her family. She said she would not have been
allowed to rock climb in her home country. ``I get more confident
every time I go up,'' she said smiling, before scooting up a
25-foot wall. ``I want to try everything in life that I can.''
</P>
<P>
   On another wall, Cody Bloomquist, an eighth-grader, scaled with
her toes pointed like a dancer on a vertical floor, a carryover
from her dance lessons.
</P>
<P>
   Fellow Girl Rocker Maddie Seales explained she has come a long
way from when the classes first started. ``I was scared half to
death. I felt so insecure. But now it feels normal,'' the
11-year-old aspiring lawyer or pediatric surgeon said. ``I love
it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes strength. It takes bravery when you are up there on
the rope,'' said Maddie's mom, Mary Kay Seales, who nonetheless has
caught the bug and has taken two climbing classes. ``I got hooked.
It just looked like too much fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the girls said they have made progress from nine weeks
ago, and feel more inclined to challenge themselves at school, both
in the classroom and in other sports. A school counselor said one
girl became more assertive at Girls Rock! and she carried that
attitude back to the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   The girls are bright, have energy and aspire to great things.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be the first female director of the FBI,'' said
Kezia Hopping, who has studied Japanese in school and held a
conversation in the language.
</P>
<P>
   The other girls were happy to speak in their new common
language: dropknee, highstep and traversing _ words for moves in
the rock-climbing world.
</P>
<P>
   Together they were happy they set goals and met them. Mentor
Krista Lindgren, a graduate student, said she was pleased that her
partner, seventh-grader Rachel Herman, recently moved to a higher
level of climbing difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were both so happy,'' she said. ``And it's just so terrific
to be around their energy.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday afternoon, their energy level could go even higher.
The girls graduate from the program and get certificates. They will
high-five, smile, giggle, climb, giggle some more, climb and, of
course, show off for parents and friends.
</P>
<P>
   Then on Saturday, things really get rockin' _ Girls Rock! will
head to a real rock wall so the climbing divas can show off their
stuff.

<P>
   GRACANICA, KOSOVO _ In the visitor's book of the 14th-century
monastery of Gracanica Wednesday morning, a Serb called Blagujevic
wrote these words:
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear Jesus Christ and Lord of all Kosovo Serbs _ help the
Serbs to endure this justified struggle and to save their state of
Kosovo-Metohija _ and punish all the enemies who want to destroy
your people. Amen.''
</P>
<P>
   A NATO jet flew through the firmament high above us as we read
Blagujevic's prayer. There was a whisper and a low drum-roll of
sound that buried itself amid the high walls and candle-blackened
frescoes of Saint Sava and his father at Gracanica.
</P>
<P>
   At the door, four Yugoslav soldiers had arrived, one of them
with two crosses dangling on his chest along with his steel
military identification tag. They lay their Kalashnikov assault
rifles on top of each other by the ancient stone door and walked
silently into the church to pray for their families.
</P>
<P>
   So many prayers there are now as Kosovo's day of reckoning grows
nearer.
</P>
<P>
   An hour before, beside the Casablanca discotheque and the
monument to the eternal unity of Serbs and Kosovo Albanians _
Tito's little joke from the 1960s _ God was asked by Archbishop
Artemije of Decine to protect Kosovo's Serbs in the coming days of
darkness.
</P>
<P>
   The 600 Serb men, women and children _ unemployed factory
workers, soldiers with their rifles on their backs, girlfriends and
wives and old men who once loved Tito _ crossed themselves beneath
the dreary sun.
</P>
<P>
   The ministry of interior had banned this rally, they were told,
so they were meeting ``in the shrine of God, under the holy sky.''
</P>
<P>
   And what the Archbishop in his long black robe told them was
this: ``We will show our true patriotism for our holy places. Don't
be frightened. Don't leave your holy place empty. A wrong
historical step cannot be corrected... Whatever happens to us, we
must stay in our homes, our villages, in our cities.''
</P>
<P>
   Moma Trajkovic, who founded the Serbian Resistance Movement in
1989 in support of President Slobodan Milosevic _ though not any
more, dear reader, not any more _ delivered a message that was
directed at NATO and the Belgrade government as well as God.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are sending a message to those who want to take revenge _
that revenge is not the answer,'' he shouted. ``Peace cannot be
achieved by revenge but only in a shared life.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not for a war or for conflict but we will not be
slaughtered on our doorsteps like lambs. This is what we ask of
those who make decisions about this area _ to come between those
who would slaughter each other...
</P>
<P>
   ``Brothers and sisters, we intend before the whole world to
stay. Remaining in Kosovo is our only chance. Unfortunately, those
who brought us here will not allow us to fight. We want to organize
ourselves and to stay, no matter what the price, to stay in our
homes... If we leave Kosovo-Metohija, we shall never return,
ever.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 85 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 500) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To decode this message, God will have understood the lambs as a
reference to Muslim sacrifice, and the bit about ``those who make
decisions'' as an appeal to Milosevic and General Sir Michael
Jackson of the still virginal ``KFOR.''
</P>
<P>
   No hint, of course, as to why the returning Albanian refugees
might want to take revenge or do any lamb-like slaughtering. A
``shared life'' was not exactly on offer last month. Or even last
week. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Once they had completed their prayers, we spoke with Ljuba and
his three soldier comrades from Toplica in the little cafe opposite
the gateway at Gracanica.
</P>
<P>
   They could not have known we were coming _ I only decided on the
trip to the monastery a few minutes earlier _ and it was we who
chose to talk to them.
</P>
<P>
   These were front-line soldiers under bombing, the voice of those
whom NATO _ whom we _ are still trying to kill in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   We ordered coffee and the men sat down nervously although not
without some eagerness to talk. Ljuba was the first to launch into
the attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO are not fighting in uniform,'' he said. ``They are at war
against our sacred places, our factories, our bridges, our
kindergartens, our hospitals... The NATO soldiers don't have the
guts to look us in the eyes. They are cowards. We just pray to God
that they come and put their boots on our soil.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 150 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 750) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ljuba was still praying for the ground war that NATO plans to
avoid. A bombing war was not what he wanted. ``It's tough for
everybody,'' Ljuba's colleague Srdjan said. ``No parent can say:
`It's OK _ my son is in the war.' But they know we have to preserve
this.''
</P>
<P>
   He pointed towards the monastery. ``My father told me before I
left for the war: `Don't be a coward.' I said to him: `Don't worry
_ I won't shame my family.''
</P>
<P>
   Ljuba _ the most talkative of the four and the most thoughtful _
wanted to explain their presence. ``We went to pray for our
families' health and to pray that the NATO bombers leave them
alone. The last thing I told my wife was `take care of our son.' He
is eight-and-a-half years old. His name is Stefan. She was crying.
Just a little.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONCLUDES) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was a war against Orthodox Christianity, Srdjan complained.
The Serbs were hated because they believed in forgiveness. So of
course, I mentioned the unmentionble: Albanians. And out it poured.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had everything _ more than any minority anywhere in the
world,'' Ljuba announced. ``But they cannot build their state on
Serbian soil. Would you allow Irish people to build their state in
Britain?''
</P>
<P>
   And the story followed its familiar course. The Albanian
villages had not been ``cleansed'' but were already deserted when
NATO attacked, the fires untended because of NATO bombs.
</P>
<P>
   But were there not _ I used the usual paraphrase _ some
``uncontrolled elements'' among the Serbs?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, against the terrorists, yes,'' Ljuba suddenly replied.
``Against those who were shooting at us, yes. But I love my wife
and children, I couldn't hurt a woman and child. Now the UCK (KLA)
fire at us from their own columns of refugees in order to provoke
us. But normal men cannot shoot at women and children.''
</P>
<P>
   These words of Ljuba must stand against the record of death
squads and executions and dispossession that the women and children
_ whom no ``normal man'' could shoot _ have spoken of after
crossing Kosovo's borders.
</P>
<P>
   It was therefore a double relief when Captain Nebojsa arrived, a
realist from Yugoslavia's Third Army and the only officer in the
little cafe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in the Croatian war,'' he said. ``This is much worse
because of the bombing. In Croatia, it was man-to-man.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our army now is preparing for a withdrawal if the agreement is
signed. The civilians will go with us. They have started leaving
already. Those who decide to stay, I don't know what will happen to
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are confused. They talk to me. They say if all the army
withdraws, they will withdraw too.
</P>
<P>
   ``As for the KLA, there is no chance they will respect the
agreement because they have no chain of command and are fighting
each other for power. All along the roads now there are (KLA)
ambushes _ just in this last period, since the start of
negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers know what this means. They know what has happened
here. And they read a message in the monastery of Gracanica. For
Kosovo's day of reckoning has been visible on the frescoes for
centuries.

<P>
   GRACANICA, KOSOVO _ In the visitor's book of the 14th-century
monastery of Gracanica Wednesday morning, a Serb called Blagujevic
wrote these words:
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear Jesus Christ and Lord of all Kosovo Serbs _ help the
Serbs to endure this justified struggle and to save their state of
Kosovo-Metohija _ and punish all the enemies who want to destroy
your people. Amen.''
</P>
<P>
   A NATO jet flew through the firmament high above us as we read
Blagujevic's prayer. There was a whisper and a low drum-roll of
sound that buried itself amid the high walls and candle-blackened
frescoes of Saint Sava and his father at Gracanica.
</P>
<P>
   At the door, four Yugoslav soldiers had arrived, one of them
with two crosses dangling on his chest along with his steel
military identification tag. They lay their Kalashnikov assault
rifles on top of each other by the ancient stone door and walked
silently into the church to pray for their families.
</P>
<P>
   So many prayers there are now as Kosovo's day of reckoning grows
nearer.
</P>
<P>
   An hour before, beside the Casablanca discotheque and the
monument to the eternal unity of Serbs and Kosovo Albanians _
Tito's little joke from the 1960s _ God was asked by Archbishop
Artemije of Decine to protect Kosovo's Serbs in the coming days of
darkness.
</P>
<P>
   The 600 Serb men, women and children _ unemployed factory
workers, soldiers with their rifles on their backs, girlfriends and
wives and old men who once loved Tito _ crossed themselves beneath
the dreary sun.
</P>
<P>
   The ministry of interior had banned this rally, they were told,
so they were meeting ``in the shrine of God, under the holy sky.''
</P>
<P>
   And what the Archbishop in his long black robe told them was
this: ``We will show our true patriotism for our holy places. Don't
be frightened. Don't leave your holy place empty. A wrong
historical step cannot be corrected... Whatever happens to us, we
must stay in our homes, our villages, in our cities.''
</P>
<P>
   Moma Trajkovic, who founded the Serbian Resistance Movement in
1989 in support of President Slobodan Milosevic _ though not any
more, dear reader, not any more _ delivered a message that was
directed at NATO and the Belgrade government as well as God.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are sending a message to those who want to take revenge _
that revenge is not the answer,'' he shouted. ``Peace cannot be
achieved by revenge but only in a shared life.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not for a war or for conflict but we will not be
slaughtered on our doorsteps like lambs. This is what we ask of
those who make decisions about this area _ to come between those
who would slaughter each other...
</P>
<P>
   ``Brothers and sisters, we intend before the whole world to
stay. Remaining in Kosovo is our only chance. Unfortunately, those
who brought us here will not allow us to fight. We want to organize
ourselves and to stay, no matter what the price, to stay in our
homes... If we leave Kosovo-Metohija, we shall never return,
ever.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 85 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 500) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To decode this message, God will have understood the lambs as a
reference to Muslim sacrifice, and the bit about ``those who make
decisions'' as an appeal to Milosevic and General Sir Michael
Jackson of the still virginal ``KFOR.''
</P>
<P>
   No hint, of course, as to why the returning Albanian refugees
might want to take revenge or do any lamb-like slaughtering. A
``shared life'' was not exactly on offer last month. Or even last
week. &QL;

<P>
   Once they had completed their prayers, we spoke with Ljuba and
his three soldier comrades from Toplica in the little cafe opposite
the gateway at Gracanica.
</P>
<P>
   They could not have known we were coming _ I only decided on the
trip to the monastery a few minutes earlier _ and it was we who
chose to talk to them.
</P>
<P>
   These were front-line soldiers under bombing, the voice of those
whom NATO _ whom we _ are still trying to kill in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   We ordered coffee and the men sat down nervously although not
without some eagerness to talk. Ljuba was the first to launch into
the attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO are not fighting in uniform,'' he said. ``They are at war
against our sacred places, our factories, our bridges, our
kindergartens, our hospitals... The NATO soldiers don't have the
guts to look us in the eyes. They are cowards. We just pray to God
that they come and put their boots on our soil.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 150 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 750) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ljuba was still praying for the ground war that NATO plans to
avoid. A bombing war was not what he wanted. ``It's tough for
everybody,'' Ljuba's colleague Srdjan said. ``No parent can say:
`It's OK _ my son is in the war.' But they know we have to preserve
this.''
</P>
<P>
   He pointed towards the monastery. ``My father told me before I
left for the war: `Don't be a coward.' I said to him: `Don't worry
_ I won't shame my family.''
</P>
<P>
   Ljuba _ the most talkative of the four and the most thoughtful _
wanted to explain their presence. ``We went to pray for our
families' health and to pray that the NATO bombers leave them
alone. The last thing I told my wife was `take care of our son.' He
is eight-and-a-half years old. His name is Stefan. She was crying.
Just a little.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONCLUDES) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was a war against Orthodox Christianity, Srdjan complained.
The Serbs were hated because they believed in forgiveness. So of
course, I mentioned the unmentionble: Albanians. And out it poured.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had everything _ more than any minority anywhere in the
world,'' Ljuba announced. ``But they cannot build their state on
Serbian soil. Would you allow Irish people to build their state in
Britain?''
</P>
<P>
   And the story followed its familiar course. The Albanian
villages had not been ``cleansed'' but were already deserted when
NATO attacked, the fires untended because of NATO bombs.
</P>
<P>
   But were there not _ I used the usual paraphrase _ some
``uncontrolled elements'' among the Serbs?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, against the terrorists, yes,'' Ljuba suddenly replied.
``Against those who were shooting at us, yes. But I love my wife
and children, I couldn't hurt a woman and child. Now the UCK (KLA)
fire at us from their own columns of refugees in order to provoke
us. But normal men cannot shoot at women and children.''
</P>
<P>
   These words of Ljuba must stand against the record of death
squads and executions and dispossession that the women and children
_ whom no ``normal man'' could shoot _ have spoken of after
crossing Kosovo's borders.
</P>
<P>
   It was therefore a double relief when Captain Nebojsa arrived, a
realist from Yugoslavia's Third Army and the only officer in the
little cafe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in the Croatian war,'' he said. ``This is much worse
because of the bombing. In Croatia, it was man-to-man.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our army now is preparing for a withdrawal if the agreement is
signed. The civilians will go with us. They have started leaving
already. Those who decide to stay, I don't know what will happen to
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are confused. They talk to me. They say if all the army
withdraws, they will withdraw too.
</P>
<P>
   ``As for the KLA, there is no chance they will respect the
agreement because they have no chain of command and are fighting
each other for power. All along the roads now there are (KLA)
ambushes _ just in this last period, since the start of
negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers know what this means. They know what has happened
here. And they read a message in the monastery of Gracanica. For
Kosovo's day of reckoning has been visible on the frescoes for
centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Take a look at the faces of Saint Sava and his father Stefan, of
King Milutin and his tragic child bride Simonida. Every Serb is
shown the Arabic script that desecrates the holy vestments. And the
painted eyes of Sava and Stefan and Milutin and Simonida which,

LEARNING TO KAYAK IS NEW EXPERIENCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEREMY   BAGOTT  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VENTURA, Calif. _ There is no dignified way to lower yourself
into the cockpit of a kayak that is four inches above the water.
</P>
<P>
   The sooner this is understood and accepted, the sooner the other
great question of dock-rental kayaking can be addressed: how to
crawl back onto the landing when you're done.
</P>
<P>
   When I got to the Lake Casitas marina to claim a rental
sit-on-top craft, I watched the guy before me scoot down from the
dock, backside first, into a kayak. This sent me back to the car to
deposit my fishing gear.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're gonna get the seat of your pants wet,'' Chuck
Goodenough had warned me at the docks. The Los Angeles commercial
photographer has seen his share of these sit-on-top contraptions.
He was at the lake with his stepdaughter, Nadia Ghani, 13, and
family friend and kayaker Marcia Lindahl.
</P>
<P>
   Goodenough was right. Within seconds of lowering myself into one
of the marina's vessels, I was squirming to remove my wallet from a
quickly waterlogged back pocket, all the while keeping the paddle
balanced on my legs. Dropping either one would definitely have put
me up the creek without a ... oh, never mind. At that moment, I was
glad the fishing rod and tackle weren't part of the mix.
</P>
<P>
   Scuppers _ four holes about the size of silver dollars that keep
the kayak self-bailing _ are what cause the kayaks to seep water
into the cockpit. Of course, water trickling in and out is
immensely better than trapped water sloshing about in a closed one.
</P>
<P>
   This is the closest the boater will ever commune with
swimming-restricted waters here at the Ventura County reservoir.
The Casitas Water District has allowed kayaking for about two years
and its marina has been renting them for nearly a year. In the
early days, the district was reluctant and kayaking started out
very structured, said Casitas Marina manager Randy King.
</P>
<P>
   ``You had to join a club and reach a certain level of skill
before they would certify you and let you go out,'' said King.
``And then you couldn't go farther than 150 feet off the north
shore.''
</P>
<P>
   Over time the restrictions eased; the only rule now is common
sense.
</P>
<P>
   For an agency so notoriously uptight about keeping its water
clean, it seemed a bit odd that the district would permit a vessel
that was now sending a steady stream of coolant through my
skivvies. But was I complaining? No way. It felt great, especially
as the day warmed.
</P>
<P>
   There's a certain predictability about the sit-on-top kayak.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't roll in these,'' said Lindahl. ``It's impossible.
Once they start to tilt, they're even more stable.''
</P>
<P>
   In the worst-case scenario _ if the sit-on-top does go over _
you simply fall into the water and climb back on, she assured me.
</P>
<P>
   The only cautionary statement in her litany of assurances was to
get to the lake well after 6 a.m. _ when the lake opens _ so as to
avoid the steady wake of bass and ski boats being launched.
</P>
<P>
   I paddled along the eastern shore, my shoulders, arms and upper
back getting a workout as the kayak's nose swayed from side to side
with each pull. On placid water, the sensation is one of gliding
across a plain of Jell-O on a toboggan.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, when the water kicked up and a 10-knot wind
began to blow, every wavelet was a mini-tsunami, like riding in one
of those model ships they used for filming sea battles before the
age of computer graphics.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the occasionally rough water, the kayak offers a great
advantage over boats for bird watchers and outdoor photographers.
</P>
<P>
   In a western finger of Casitas called Station Canyon,
spectacular blue heron build huge nests in sycamore trees at
water's edge. The kayak has traditionally been the preferred
transportation for sliding into wildlife-rich shallows unobserved.
</P>
<P>
   Bird-watcher Lois Coleman of Glendora, who has paddled in Alaska
and local ocean waters alike, was at Casitas in a tandem kayak with
her daughter, Lynn Coleman of Ojai.
</P>
<P>
   ``For bird-watching, it really doesn't get any better than
this,'' said the elder Coleman, jazzed over having spotted a
black-capped night heron.
</P>
<P>
   Lois Coleman was up for her birthday and the tandem was a nice
means for her to catch up on things with her daughter without
having to make herself heard from one kayak to the next.
</P>
<P>
   In general, two paddlers with equal ability and power will
travel farther and swifter in a tandem than they would in separate
boats. Another advantage with a tandem is that a parent can drop a
child into the bow cockpit and handle the paddling alone with a
minimal trade-off of speed and reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can fish from these kayaks, not a problem,'' King had
assured me by phone. But for a beginner, it seemed to require too
much coordination.
</P>
<P>
   I hugged the reed beds along the lake's Wadleigh Arm and
continued south between the main island and the east shore, as
close to the water's surface as you can get without being
!ital!in!off! it. It was the best of both worlds: Sliding across
the water in a feather-light boat in the tradition of an Inuit
hunter, but with all the buoyancy and safety of a molded linear
polyethylene design. &QL; 
Staff writer Jeremy Bagott's boating and sailing column appears
monthly in the Daily News.
</P>
<P>
   KAYAK RENTALS
</P>
<P>
   The Lake Casitas marina rents both solo and tandem boats for $10
an hour or $30 for five hours and $15 an hour or $40 for five
hours, respectively. Information: (805) 649-2043.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ In the darkness of an underground cave lined with
prehistoric paintings, French scientists believe they have
discovered the oldest footprints of humans in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Embedded in damp clay, the imprints, slightly more than 8 inches
long, appear to be those of a boy, 8 or 10 years old, who was
walking barefoot between 25,000 and 30,000 years ago, prehistorians
who have studied the cave said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   They said the dates are only hypothetical because there is no
precise way to determine when the markings were made in the moist
soil. But Michel-Andre Garcia, one prehistorian who has studied the
site, said that the carbon datings in the cave and the context make
this ``a very strong hypothesis.'' The four footprints were found
in the Ardeche region of southern France, deep inside the Chauvet
cave. Its chambers, decorated with extraordinary ice-age paintings
were discovered in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Formal study of the prehistoric site had been blocked by
lawsuits over who owned the land and therefore the rights to the
caves underneath. The issue is still not resolved. But
archeologists began formally exploring the underground caves a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
   They see it as a unique treasure chest because it is the first
large cavern from the Paleolithic era to be found undisturbed, its
entrance sealed by an ancient landslide. Some of the panels of
stone etchings and multicolored paintings have been dated at 30,000
to 32,000 years old, making this the oldest cave art known to
science.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Clottes, the prehistorian who heads the team of explorers,
said 11 carbon datings have been made from material in the cave,
from campfires, torch marks and paintings. They are dated between
32,000 and 23,000 years old.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have nothing more recent than that,'' ? Clottes said. ``So
we believe the footprints belong to that time period, probably to
the last passage of humans in the cave some 25,000 years ago.''
That means, he said, that the footprints are the oldest known in
Europe and belong to Cro-Magnon man, the first humans known to
paint.
</P>
<P>
   The earliest fossilized human footprints were discovered in
South Africa in 1997 in sandstone estimated to be 117,000 years
old.
</P>
<P>
   The amateur spelunkers who came upon the French cave in 1994 had
already reported seeing footprints of bears and humans. But it was
not until last month that scientists examined the footprints.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very exciting because when you find footprints it makes
a place very much alive,'' Clottes said.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia, a prehistorian with the National Center for Scientific
Research in Paris, who examined the footprints closely, said that
they are in an undisturbed far end of the main chamber, under a
three-feet-high passage between two caves.
</P>
<P>
   Overhead are several charcoal marks that appear to have been
made by rubbing a torch on the low ceiling to make it burn
brighter. The torch marks above the footprints were recently
estimated to be 26,000 years old through radiocarbon dating.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's impossible to prove that the marks on the ceiling and on
the floor are connected,'' Garcia said. ``But the soil in that part
of the cave was totally undisturbed.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he thought the imprints belonged to a boy because of
their width. ``They are very clear and absolutely like a modern
foot.''
</P>
<P>
   Ancient human footprints have been found before in other caves
in France, but they were held to be more recent.
</P>
<P>
   The two-week exploration in May produced other valuable finds.
Clottes said the group had found an eight-inch-long prehistoric
spear carved from a mammoth tooth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found lots of little hints of people's presence, like a
piece of animal rib stuck in the crack of a wall,'' he said. ``You
look at the mural paintings and you look at that rib and it makes
you think people have been doing the same things for a very very
long time.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In May, the team, which includes a dozen specialists, also found
31 new paintings and engravings in the cave, bringing the gallery
with its wall panels full of lively animals to 447 images of 14
animal species.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say the paintings here are exceptional because of their
age and the skill of their makers and, not least, because they are
mostly images of dangerous animals _ beautifully drawn groups of
lions running, mammoths, cave bears with their mouths open, a pair
of rhinoceroses fighting. Until this find, European cave art
usually depicted animals hunted by man.
</P>
<P>
   Clottes said he believed more discoveries will be made. ``I
think we will probably find more footprints and other valuable
remains,'' he said. ``There are vast areas we have not examined
yet.''  &QL;

   SEATTLE _ Once-abundant salmon runs of Canada's west coast have
suffered drastic declines in recent years due to habitat
destruction, overfishing and changes in ocean conditions, the
Vancouver-based Pacific Fisheries Resource Council found in its
first report.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, our salmon catches over the last five years are among
the lowest of the last 50 years. We seem to have gone from many
diverse fish stocks down to a few strong runs,'' said John Fraser,
the council's chairman and former speaker of Canada's House of
Commons.
</P>
<P>
   The decline is most dramatic among chinook and coho salmon,
species that are also imperiled in the Columbia River system and
throughout the Pacific Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   The return of coho salmon to British Columbia's central coast,
Fraser said in an interview, has declined from more than 500,000
fish to fewer than 25,000.
</P>
<P>
   The report released Tuesday said that coho salmon are in danger
from the Skeena River, in northern British Columbia, south to
Vancouver Island and the Strait of Georgia. Last year, Canada
curtailed both the commercial and sport fishery for coho salmon.
</P>
<P>
   But even sockeye salmon, although still abundant in the Fraser
River, are in peril elsewhere along the Canadian coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``The central coast area once supported the second largest
sockeye fishery in British Columbia, after the Fraser. The Rivers
and Smith Inlet fisheries are now essentially closed,'' said the
Council report.
</P>
<P>
   The Council is a quasi-governmental body of experts appointed
last September to advise Canada's fisheries minister David Anderson
on how to conserve and restore endangered salmon runs.
</P>
<P>
   Its report comes less than a week after the United States and
Canada reached a long-term agreement for conserving and managing
salmon runs from the Alaska border to the Oregon coast.
</P>
<P>
   The Council said Canada's Department of Fisheries and Oceans
doesn't have enough money to meet its current conservation mandate
and has lacked resources even to keep track of salmon runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``For example, there is a shortfall in basic (counting) and
assessment monitoring to the extent that only a few stocks,
primarily large ones, have adequate data for their management and
protection,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The report noted that fisheries officials cannot account for
what happened to 3.5 million sockeye salmon that swam up the Fraser
River last year but never reached their spawning grounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state of many salmon stocks is unknown,'' the panel
reported. ``The Council has found that there are such glaring
information gaps ... that no valid conclusions could be drawn about
the state of many stocks. Nonetheless, there is evidence that
salmon biodiversity is being eroded.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 salmon catch along Canada's west coast was about half
the average catch of the last half-century, the Council reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears that unfavorable marine conditions, past
overfishing and habitat damage have been significant causes of the
reduced catch,'' it found.
</P>
<P>
   The Council pointedly delivered its report to both the Canadian
government and British Columbia provincial government, which have
bitterly feuded over fisheries policy.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson on Wednesday defended his department, saying it spends
$220 million (Canadian) in the Pacific region and has invested
major work on restoring salmon habitat.
</P>
<P>
   But many of the streams and logged-over areas needing
restoration fall under the control of the British Columbia
government, noted Sharon Chow of the Sierra Club of British
Columbia, which endorsed the Council report.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have a huge problem between the province and the
federal government, and between Anderson and (British Columbia
Premier) Glen Clark,'' she added. ``And that is not good for
fish.''
</P>
<P>
   Fraser noted, however, that the United States and Canada have
managed to come together after an often-bitter five year dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have created some stability and set out in the direction of
much closer Canada-U.S. cooperation to save fish,'' he said. ``Now
it is time to get our own house in order.''
</P>
<P>
   In a future report, the Council is expected to discuss
breakdowns in Canada's fisheries enforcement, particularly
overfishing in ocean waters and failure to catch poachers once
salmon have begun their upstream migration.

GENERALS SIGN PLAN TO END NATO BOMBING OF YUGOSLAVIA 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CRAGG HINES 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ An end to the heaviest fighting in Europe
since World War II grew nearer Thursday after Yugoslav generals
Wednesday night signed a NATO-dictated plan to withdraw from
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The signing set in motion a peace plan that is to end NATO
bombing of Yugoslavia, trigger the advance of an international
military force into the war-torn province and allow the return of
many of the 800,000 ethnic Albanian refugees who fled before
President Slobodan Milosevic's Serb nationalist troops.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. Security Council in New York prepared to consider a
resolution mandating the multinational force. Assuming Chinese
objections can be quieted, a vote on the measure was expected as
soon as NATO suspended its 78-day bombardment of the Balkan nation.
</P>
<P>
   NATO was looking for the Yugoslav withdrawal to be in full swing
by daybreak, and the allies planned to check on its progress with
reconnaissance flights and by other intelligence means. As soon as
the beginning of the pullout can be verified, NATO
Secretary-General Javier Solana was to announce suspension of
hostile air operations.
</P>
<P>
   Although key moves in the Yugoslav withdrawal are to be
accomplished in a day or two, NATO agreed to give Belgrade 11 days,
instead of the originally planned seven, to completely take its
40,000-strong force _ military, paramilitary and police _ out of
the war-torn province. The Yugoslav troops are to withdraw 15 miles
within Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   The signing of the withdrawal agreement was announced by Lt.
Gen. Michael Jackson, the Briton who will lead the international
force, at Kumanovo air base in Macedonia near the Kosovo border.
Talks there had proceeded haltingly since Saturday. Jackson, who
signed for NATO, said Yugoslav generals Svetozar Marjanovic and
Obrad Stevanovic signed for the Milosevic government.
</P>
<P>
   Nebojsa Vujovic, the Yugoslav deputy foreign minister who
participated in the talks, said his nation will ``fulfill each and
every obligation'' of the agreement. In any case, Jackson warned:
``I have made it clear that if subsequently the withdrawal
timetable is breached, the agreement requires the air operation to
resume.''
</P>
<P>
   News of the signing evoked relief and cautious optimism in NATO
nations and volleys of celebratory gunfire in Belgrade, the
Yugoslav capital.
</P>
<P>
   Although the signing represented a victory for NATO, Jackson
said it was ``time to look ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that this document has now been agreed represents the
hopes of a better future in which we can rebuild Kosovo and restore
some normality to the lives of its ordinary citizens regardless of
their ethnic background,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   It will be a Herculean task, as Jackson acknowledged, given the
ancient ethnic hatreds that suffuse the Balkans and the devastated
infrastructure left by Serb troops and the NATO bombing. Land mines
planted by Serb forces and unexploded ordnance from the allied
bombardment are only two of the obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the withdrawal agreement, the Yugoslav military
agreed to turn over by Friday its records of land mines, booby
traps and remaining ammunition stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the refugees are expected to return to personal horror
stories _ burned-out houses and barns, wrecked farm equipment and,
most disheartening, missing relatives. Moving into Kosovo quickly
behind the multinational military force will be agents from the
international tribunal established by the United Nations to
investigate war crimes in the former Yugoslavia. They already have
reports of wholesale killing and rape by Serb forces and mass
graves in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The tribunal, based in The Hague, Netherlands, indicted
Milosevic and a handful of his high command during the NATO
bombardment. The U.N. resolution ``demands full cooperation'' by
the international military with the tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Security Council resolution, U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan is to appoint a civilian administrator for Kosovo to
develop an autonomous government. Although the resolution
recognizes Yugoslav sovereignty over Kosovo, the influence of the
Milosevic regime there is expected to be minimal.
</P>
<P>
   In the Yugoslav heartland of Serbia, Milosevic remains in power.
His strongest challenge ahead may come from even more nationalistic
figures, and Milosevic may have to answer for the presence of
foreign troops in Kosovo. Although the province recently has been
inhabited primarily by ethnic Albanians who are Muslims, it is the
site of orthodox Christian shrines and is considered the seat of
the Serb patrimony.
</P>
<P>
   As the pullout approached, concern grew that the estimated
100,000 ethnic Serbs still in Kosovo may feel so threatened that
they may flee north into Serbia, complicating military movements.
</P>
<P>
   The final turn in the withdrawal talks was first signaled in
Cologne, Germany, where Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer said NATO
had agreed to strike from the plan a provision allowing 24 hours
between the verification of the beginning of a Yugoslav pullout and
the entry of the multinational force. Yugoslav leaders feared a
daylong lag would give an advantage to rebels in the Kosovo
Liberation Army to attack departing Serbs and to strengthen
beachheads throughout the province.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, in a statement issued by the White House,
cautioned the KLA ``not to hinder'' the withdrawal, a point already
agreed by rebel leaders.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has said Serb forces have the right to defend themselves if
fired on by rebels during the withdrawal. But Yugoslav military
officials have been warned to prevent additional pillaging of
Kosovo by their departing forces.
</P>
<P>
   Another disagreement in the endgame focused on the number of
Yugoslav forces that would be allowed to return as a token presence
in the province. NATO stuck to its demand that the number be in the
hundreds rather than the thousands proposed by Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the initial withdrawal of armed personnel, by
Thursday night, Yugoslavia is to end military flights over Kosovo
and stop all air defense. Within three days, all Yugoslav air
defense materiel is to be removed from the province.
</P>
<P>
   The withdrawal talks, over two days, were as fitful as any of
the diplomatic maneuvers during the 11-week conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, during a CNN interview
Wednesday afternoon, seemed barely able to contain her irritation
at the continuing delays.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is up to the Serbs to agree to the military-technical
agreement and take the first step, which is to begin the
withdrawal,'' Albright said. ``They are the ones who caused this.
They must take the first step. That is how the catch-22 becomes
uncaught.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright was in Cologne, where she and other foreign ministers
were preparing for the annual summit of the Group of Eight nations
next week. On Tuesday the ministers from the United States, Russia,
Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan, agreed on the
U.N. resolution on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   German government and military officials said the NATO bombing
campaign effectively ended Wednesday morning, although spokesmen at
alliance headquarters in the Belgian capital as well as White House
officials argued that the air strikes were ongoing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our position has not changed one iota,'' said NATO spokesman
Jamie Shea. He said that on Tuesday allied jets flew 523 sorties,
including 130 strike missions, 56 of which were directed at
Yugoslav air defense positions.
</P>
<P>
   All manned NATO craft returned safely to their bases, but a
drone plane was downed, said NATO military spokesman Walter Jertz,
a German army major general.
</P>
<P>
   Tanjug, the Yugoslav government news agency, said Wednesday
afternoon that a unit of ``anti-terrorist'' police had already been
withdrawn from Kosovo. It did not say how many troops were involved
in the departure.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the talks continued, NATO stepped up preparations to
move into the province as KFOR, for ``Kosovo force.''
</P>
<P>
   Massed in Macedonia, just south of Kosovo, were 17,500 troops,
about one-third of the total 50,000 expected to flood into the
province over a few weeks. That does not include whatever force
Russia may decide to put into the operation.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's political arm, the North Atlantic Council, has approved
the operational plan for KFOR, the first step in the deployment. A
second session will be called to approve the activation orders to
send the forces into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Shea said some units were under orders to be prepared to move in
four hours. The first unit across the border is expected to be
engineers who will examine and secure the road to Pristina, the
provincial capital which Jackson will use as his forward
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's headquarters staff was under orders to be prepared to
move within 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Other NATO troops will be working to identify the safest routes
and safest areas that can be used by the first refugees. The force
will also check on how U.N. and private international aid agencies
can help the estimated 500,000 Kosovar Albanians displaced within
the province.

 &HT;    Democrats decry NRA influence on gun control proposals
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton and congressional Democrats
accused House Republicans on Wednesday of buckling in to the
National Rifle Association and gutting proposed gun control
provisions scheduled for a House vote next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a bill, plainly, ghostwritten by the NRA,'' said
Clinton, speaking at a Justice Department conference. ``I think it
is wrong to let the NRA call the shots on this issue. They've been
calling the shots on this issue for decades now, and we have failed
to do what is manifestly in the interest of our children and our
communities.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton angrily invoked the shootings of 12 students and a
teacher at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can still remember Littleton _ it hasn't even been two
months _ then we ought to speak up and be heard,'' Clinton said.
``This is a classic, horrible example of how Washington is out of
touch with the rest of America.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton delivered his remarks as the first details of the gun
control proposals drafted by Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry
Hyde (R-Ill.) and Rep. Bill McCollum (R-Fla.) began circulating
among both gun control advocates and the gun lobby.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed language by Hyde and McCollum, to be offered as an
amendment to a massive juvenile crime bill, would soften some of
the requirements for criminal background checks conducted at gun
shows. Closing the so-called gun show loophole was a major flash
point in the Senate, which three weeks ago adopted strict language
to govern when and on whom the checks must be conducted.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Hyde acknowledged that Judiciary Committee
members had consulted the NRA in drafting the gun control
proposals. But Hyde denied that the changes represented a
capitulation to the powerful gun lobby, which has waged a
grass-roots campaign to kill the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't help draft it; they looked at it,'' Hyde said.
They had some commentary. But it's not an NRA provision.''
</P>
<P>
   Gun control proponents seized on two aspects of the
Hyde-McCollum legislation they said would dramatically weaken
similar provisions narrowly passed by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Senate bill, gun shows would be defined as any
gathering where more than 50 guns were offered for sale. The House
version changes that requirement to any gathering where more than
10 dealers are brought together.
</P>
<P>
   Kristen Rand, an analyst with the Violence Policy Center, said
the change could conceivably mean that nine dealers could sell
thousands of guns but still not be required to conduct background
checks. Guns sold at flea markets, for example, might not be
covered.
</P>
<P>
   But Paul McNulty, chief counsel for the Judiciary Committee,
said the Senate language was so broad that private sales between
gun collectors could be defined as a gun show. The House language
also would reverse a fundamental provision of the 1968 gun control
law passed after the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy,
his brother, Robert, and the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. Under that
law, sellers at gun shows are prohibited from shipping guns to
buyers out of state. The House version would permit dealers to ship
guns out of state after conducting a criminal background check on
the buyer. In a live video feed on the NRA's Web site, an NRA
announcer trumpeted the change in language to allow guns to be
shipped to buyers, noting that the provision ``was not allowed
under current law.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, she added that NRA leaders were still encouraging
members to contact their member of Congress and ``let them know we
don't need more gun laws.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Barr (R-Ga.), the only member of the House who is an
NRA board member, said through his spokesman that he could not
support the Hyde-McCollum amendment on gun shows ``as is.'' The
spokesman declined further comment.

ROCK-CLIMBING PROGRAM TEACHES GIRLS TO SCALE ALL SORTS OF HURDLES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT L. JAMIESON JR.  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Saleemeh's spirit is willing. But her body won't leave
the table.
</P>
<P>
   Her feet shuffle. Her eyes show fear. Her lips purse.
</P>
<P>
   The seventh-grader stands at the edge of the waist-high table.
She could fall backward, like an Olympic diver pushing off a
platform. Or she could just give in to fear and step down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh my goooooosh!'' she opines, her arms crossed. ``I'm
scared!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Fall, stay straight, like a board,'' a buddy yells. ``You can
do it!''
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, OK,'' Saleemeh huffs. ``One ... two ... three ... I'm
falling!!!''
</P>
<P>
   She lands, face up, in a safety net formed by the outstretched
arms of her friends. Everyone whoops and claps and pats her on the
back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Piece of cake!'' she trumpets, flashing a grin at her
breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of numbers, Saleemeh Razaghzadeh's fall was small _ 4
feet. In words, the distance could be described as larger than
life.
</P>
<P>
   The plunge, known as a ``Trust Fall,'' builds confidence and a
sense of teamwork that she and nine other girls share in Girls
Rock!, _ a Seattle -based program run by the non-profit group
Passages Northwest, which teaches them how to rock climb.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson in trust is vital. On a real rock climb _ away from
the indoor Vertical World in Seattle where they practice _ the
girls may need to help each other, or strangers. And that way of
thinking carries over into life.
</P>
<P>
   For the past nine weeks, the girls have believed in each other,
studied rock wall surfaces with each other, tied complex rope knots
next to each other, fastened safety harnesses for each other and
giggled _ a lot _ among themselves.
</P>
<P>
   They climbed, too.
</P>
<P>
   But they have not laughed or learned just among themselves. The
program matches the girls, some of whom are from underprivileged
backgrounds, with climbing volunteers. Those adult mentors come
from professional and academic backgrounds, including education,
medicine and business. They share their rock-climbing prowess, aura
of confidence and brain power with the girls.
</P>
<P>
   The girls, in turn, set manageable goals to improve their own
scaling skills and get quite a workout. They also say the program
readies them for life's looming mountains: the pre-adolescent
hurdles brought on by dawning sexual anxiety, peer pressure and
self-doubt, which many young women face.
</P>
<P>
   In combination, those hurdles can prove so powerful that some
young people have dubbed their not-so-wonder years ``Triple-A'' _
agony, alienation and acne.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not easy, especially middle school,'' sighs Girl Rocker
Sarah Futhey, an articulate 12-year-old who goes to Eckstein Middle
School in Seattle. ``In my school there are huge popularity
contests. Who can be the best? Who can wear the nicest clothes? I
was never in the `in' group. I'm not into that.
</P>
<P>
   ``But watching the other girls here climb huge walls and go for
the gusto makes me want to do that. When you come to climb, you
don't have to be popular. You just have to believe in yourself, try
and have a good time and meet your goals,'' Sarah adds, before
dashing off for a practice climb.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I ever meet a challenging situation in life, I know I can
approach it like a climb _ step by step.''
</P>
<P>
   Program organizers know well the shoes in which the girls are
walking.
</P>
<P>
   Girls Rock! director Rana Betting recalled her preadolescent
years as being one of the most difficult phases of her life.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Betting, who has been climbing for seven years, gets
pleasure from being part of an organization that helps girls feel
less awkward than she did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I had had something like this when I was young,'' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   Few would dispute the difficulty girls face holding onto
positive self-images. Pundits, feminist scholars and developmental
psychologists point to cultural sources _ the media, films, music,
advertising, the Internet _ that bombard girls with difficult,
sometimes confusing messages.
</P>
<P>
   Thin females are held up as having the paragon body type in pop
culture; sexual promiscuity in music and films tells kids they are
cool if they ``do it''; girls even receive subtle messages about
how _ or if _ to use brain power. Barbie dolls once chirped, ``Math
class is tough!''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, boys also suffer in their preadolescent years. But
long-standing research has shown the pronounced impacts girls face
living in a patriarchal society.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Gilligan, founder of the Harvard Project on Women's
Psychology and Girls' Development, conducted groundbreaking work
during the 1980s and '90s that showed while adolescent girls start
off promisingly, they fail to fulfill their potential.
</P>
<P>
   Girls make good progress in their early preteen years, around
the ages of 8 and 9, when their behaviors are confident and
outspoken. As they near adolescence, however, they become tentative
and conformist. They start to doubt their moral convictions and
lose self-confidence, Gilligan found.
</P>
<P>
   For some girls, the negative feelings can cause grades to slip.
Studies have shown girls typically become less academically driven
in math and science in late elementary school or early junior high
school.
</P>
<P>
   Downcast feelings can lapse into depression or spin the girls
into harmful behaviors, including eating disorders, drug use and
suicidal thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Pipher, the best-selling author of ``Reviving Ophelia,''
which deals with self-esteem issues among young women, believes
girls are coming of age in a sexualized and media-saturated
society. They become disheartened by America's ``girl-poisoning
culture'' and at puberty ``crash into junk culture,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Annie Lareau survived her ``crash,'' but wanted to be sure
others could avoid collisions altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't believe I was smart when I was that age,'' says
Lareau, 31, who dreamed of a theater career when she was young.
``The feeling was, if you are dumb, then you go and act. I felt
that as a girl. ... My grades suffered.''
</P>
<P>
   Lareau went on to college, where mentors nurtured her passion
for the stage, and she thrived academically. After college, she was
in Boston working in an all-female workshop of ``Henry V'' _ ``I
was Henry'' _ when she met Gilligan.
</P>
<P>
   That encounter inspired Lareau to pursue a master's degree in
education at Harvard, where she eventually studied under Gilligan.
</P>
<P>
   Lareau later moved to Seattle. In 1996, she and a friend, who
directed a science program at the University of Washington, got
together to launch Passages Northwest, a non-profit organization
promoting arts and wilderness education for girls and women.
</P>
<P>
   Passages Northwest branched into backpacking tours; next came
mother-daughter rope courses, followed by sea kayaking and
backpacking courses. In the spring of 1998, she collaborated with
Rebecca Bear, a Seattle educator, and they decided it was time for
girls to rock, but they weren't thinking about a band.
</P>
<P>
   Passages runs on an annual budget of $100,000, about $35,000 of
which is for Girls Rock! The program relies on financial donations
to keep going, primarily because most of the girls who participate
get a scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   The current class of Girl Rockers comes from various
backgrounds. Saleemeh, for example, was born in Iran and moved to
the United States with her family. She said she would not have been
allowed to rock climb in her home country. ``I get more confident
every time I go up,'' she said smiling, before scooting up a
25-foot wall. ``I want to try everything in life that I can.''
</P>
<P>
   On another wall, Cody Bloomquist, an eighth-grader, scaled with
her toes pointed like a dancer on a vertical floor, a carryover
from her dance lessons.
</P>
<P>
   Fellow Girl Rocker Maddie Seales explained she has come a long
way from when the classes first started. ``I was scared half to
death. I felt so insecure. But now it feels normal,'' the
11-year-old aspiring lawyer or pediatric surgeon said. ``I love
it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes strength. It takes bravery when you are up there on
the rope,'' said Maddie's mom, Mary Kay Seales, who nonetheless has
caught the bug and has taken two climbing classes. ``I got hooked.
It just looked like too much fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the girls said they have made progress from nine weeks
ago, and feel more inclined to challenge themselves at school, both
in the classroom and in other sports. A school counselor said one
girl became more assertive at Girls Rock! and she carried that
attitude back to the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   The girls are bright, have energy and aspire to great things.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be the first female director of the FBI,'' said
Kezia Hopping, who has studied Japanese in school and held a
conversation in the language.
</P>
<P>
   The other girls were happy to speak in their new common
language: dropknee, highstep and traversing _ words for moves in
the rock-climbing world.
</P>
<P>
   Together they were happy they set goals and met them. Mentor
Krista Lindgren, a graduate student, said she was pleased that her
partner, seventh-grader Rachel Herman, recently moved to a higher
level of climbing difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were both so happy,'' she said. ``And it's just so terrific
to be around their energy.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday afternoon, their energy level could go even higher.
The girls graduate from the program and get certificates. They will
high-five, smile, giggle, climb, giggle some more, climb and, of
course, show off for parents and friends.
</P>
<P>
   Then on Saturday, things really get rockin' _ Girls Rock! will
head to a real rock wall so the climbing divas can show off their
stuff.

 &HT;    Delegation in Sarajevo sees `incredible progress'
 &HT;    By Jim Bebbington
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Hercegovina _ A delegation from Dayton today
will sign a Sister City agreement with the mayor of Sarajevo,
surrounded by a Balkan city that has used the 1995 Dayton Peace
Accords to try to leave behind the scars of war.
</P>
<P>
   A 12-member Dayton delegation that includes musicians,
academics, business representatives and city officials arrived
Wednesday at the grim Sarajevo airport on the city's southwest
side, then was driven into town past streets where an earlier
Dayton delegation saw only snow-covered ruins.
</P>
<P>
   While the signs of the three-year siege of Sarajevo are
everywhere _ pockmarks from bullets and shrapnel dot almost every
building _ Sarajevans have spent four years patching the damage and
trying to go on with their lives. New homes, apartments and shops
are everywhere. Many damaged buildings are surrounded by
scaffolding. The streets on this warm June day were busy and loud
with cars and residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is absolutely incredible to see what they have accomplished
in four years,'' Dayton Mayor Mike Turner said after the group
toured crowded bazaars and shops filled with goods.
</P>
<P>
   Turner visited Bosnia twice in 1996, the first time just months
after the fighting ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where before you would have to work to find buildings that
were not significantly damaged, now you have to, looking at the
neighborhoods, find buildings that are the exception, that have not
been restored,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The armed siege began in 1992 when Bosnian Serbs, backed by the
Yugoslav Army, took to the hillsides with snipers and cannons and
rained death upon Sarajevo for three years. Residents learned to
shun the sight of the lush green hillsides that surround the city
on all sides and that had helped give the city its identity for
centuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The saying was, `If you can see them, they can see you,'''
said Miran Norderland, the Dayton group's guide Wednesday and
president of a media production company, FAMA Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Today, residents have returned to the hillsides' orange-tile
roofed homes, although they steer clear of some high areas that
were once the front lines of war and are believed to be mined.
</P>
<P>
   The peace agreement hammered out at Wright-Patterson Air Force
Base in November 1995 ended the fighting and began an otherwise
unlikely relationship between Dayton and Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
   Sarajevo had 500,000 residents before the war, much larger than
Dayton. It is also the capital city of Bosnia-Herzegovina.
</P>
<P>
   But the name Dayton and the connection have stuck. So many small
businesses and shops have made Dayton part of their name that the
word is common locally.
</P>
<P>
   The word, often spelled ``Dejton'' in the Serbo-Croation
language, is shorthand for the good and the bad of rebuilding
Bosnia, a process that includes slowly getting the ethnic Muslim,
Croat and Serb residents to reintegrate their cities and villages.
Most communities in the country, including Sarajevo, house
primarily just one of the three groups.
</P>
<P>
   But physically, at least, rebuilding is under way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me the city is clearly working,'' said R. Bruce
Hitchner, a delegation member and director of the Center for
International Programs at the University of Dayton.
</P>
<P>
   At a shady cafe, however, Norderland told the group the city's
apparent good health can be a little deceiving because the most
successful residents are the ones in the shopping district, which
now includes exclusive clothes boutiques.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you see on the street is like in Zagreb and Belgrade _ it
is 10 percent of the population,'' Norderland said.
</P>
<P>
   While the city's economy is stronger now, there has been little
economic growth lately, he said. The country is struggling to
transform the government-run economy of a former communist state
into a market-based, free enterprise system, but outside investors
have been hard to attract.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the population gets by on a combination of government
pensions and odd jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Dayton City Manager Valerie Lemmie said the delegation will try
to encourage contacts between Dayton-area businesses and some of
the rebuilding projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are tremendous economic opportunities that are beginning
to emerge that will complement the social and cultural ties that
have developed over the years,'' she said.

CLINTON FAULTS HOUSE GOP'S GUN MEASURES
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton on Wednesday assailed House
Republicans' gun-control proposals as flawed measures that were
``plainly ghostwritten'' by the National Rifle Association, which
he said was successfully whittling away at the modest new
restrictions on firearms approved by the Senate last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is wrong to let the NRA call the shots on this issue,'' the
president said Wednesday afternoon. ``This is a classic, horrible
example of how Washington is out of touch with the rest of
America.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's accusation was the latest salvo in a battle over gun
control in the House that was already adhering to the pattern
established in the Senate, where Republicans repeatedly attempted
to project a new receptiveness to gun control and Democrats
reliably portrayed those efforts as hollow, insincere and
influenced by the NRA.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, Clinton and House Democrats were pointing out
significant differences between aspects of the gun-control measures
that the Senate passed and details of the proposals unveiled by
House Republicans on Tuesday. Those proposals indeed addressed some
of the most ardent complaints that the rifle association had issued
about the Senate legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Most tellingly, the House Republicans' proposal for mandatory
background checks on all buyers at gun shows defines those events
much more narrowly than the Senate did, so that vendors at many
small, informal gatherings and flea markets would be exempt from
the requirement. The NRA was bitterly opposed to the broader Senate
definition.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry J. Hyde, R-Ill., who heads the House Judiciary
Committee, acknowledged Wednesday that the committee aides who
drafted the gun-control measures ``spent a lot of time with a lot
of people, including the NRA''
</P>
<P>
   But he defended the NRA as a legitimate advocacy group with
informed opinions and accused Democrats of trying to saddle
Republicans with a new bogeyman, now that Kenneth Starr, the
independent counsel, had receded from view.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde also stressed that no organization _ ``not the NRA or the
IRA or the NCAA'' _ had written the gun-control measures.
</P>
<P>
   James Jay Baker, chief lobbyist for the NRA, said Thursday, ``We
made suggestions.'' But he noted that while some of those concerns
were accommodated, others were not, and he said that the NRA was
still engaged in aggressive lobbying _ the organization has spent
more than $1 million in the last four weeks _ to try to get
legislation it likes even better.
</P>
<P>
   As differences between the House proposals and the Senate
legislation came into sharper focus Wednesday, they provided a
snapshot of where House Republicans might be heading on gun
control: on which suggestions they deemed feasible, which they
found desirable and which they might like to jettison.
</P>
<P>
   But the ultimate fate and precise shape of the gun-control
measures were very much in flux. Senior Republican aides cautioned
that the House Rules Committee could make changes in the measures
before they reached the floor next week, and these aides said that
while Democrats were complaining that the package was too soft,
many Republicans were complaining that it was too strict.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, several of these aides said, many Republicans were more
conservative than NRA officials on gun control and were receiving
calls from constituents, including disgruntled members of the rifle
association, who were urging a fiercer opposition to gun-control
measures than the NRA had mounted.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The broad spectrum of opinion within the Republican Party,
coupled with the hodgepodge of measures being piled onto the
juvenile crime bill that is the vehicle for gun control, left some
Democrats and Republicans fretful about the passage of the
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Hyde has proposed one particularly controversial
amendment that imposes new federal prohibitions on pornographic and
violent material to which children have access.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Thursday about his motivation, Hyde said, that every time
he turned the television on he saw people having sex.
</P>
<P>
   The way Hyde's committee clustered its gun-control proposals
suggested that there might be significant Republican support for a
requirement that child safety devices accompany all handguns sold
by licensed dealers, for new restrictions on juvenile access to
semiautomatic rifles and for a ban on gun ownership for any adult
who committed a violent crime as a child.
</P>
<P>
   But there might be less support for a ban on the import of
high-capacity ammunition clips, which the Senate passed, and a
raise in the legal minimum age for all handgun purchases to 21 from
18, which was absent from the Senate package. Those provisions are
both opposed by the NRA.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats and gun-control advocates Wednesday identified several
ways in which House Republicans' proposals diverged from the Senate
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans defined child-safety devices more broadly.
Perhaps more important, the Republicans' gun-show measure relaxed
record-keeping requirements; made tracing of firearms sold at gun
shows more difficult; exempted vendors without stationary positions
from conducting mandatory background checks, and eased restrictions
on the shipment of guns across state lines.
</P>
<P>
   But in allowing gun-show vendors three calendar days to conduct
a background check, the measure ignored appeals from NRA officials
for a 24-hour limit. Republicans also thwarted the NRA by including
a provision, not part of the Senate bill, that holds parents
criminally culpable if they do not store guns securely and children
get access to the weapons and cause harm.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said Thursday night that they would try to offer
amendments to the juvenile crime bill that would replace the
language in Hyde's gun-show proposal with the stricter language
from the Senate bill.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear how many Democratic proposals will be allowed to
the floor of the House, where the majority party has more control
over the debate than they do in the Senate.

DEMOCRATIC COMMITTEE WANTS TO EXAMINE CORRESPONDENCE TO SEN. SLADE
GORTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Slade Gorton's last campaign slogan was
``Slade Gorton works for you.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Democrats are about to figure out whether that's
true.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee has filed Freedom
of Information Act requests with multiple federal agencies,
demanding copies of all correspondence from Gorton, R-Wash., and
his staff from the senator's entire 18 years in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The committee, whose vice chairwoman is Sen. Patty Murray,
D-Wash., is seeking the same information about every other
Republican senator up for re-election next year.
</P>
<P>
   The sweeping Freedom of Information Act requests are part of
what's called in Washington ``opposition research,'' and is known
more colloquially as digging for dirt. The Democrats are seeking to
see what they might unearth that might be useful in a campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton and Sen. Conrad Burns, R-Mont., erupted with indignation
upon learning of the probe. Gorton compared the incident to the
Bush administration's perusal of candidate Bill Clinton's passport
records and the Clinton administration's review of FBI files on
numerous Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your committee may be within the strict letter of the law to
pursue this Freedom of Information Act request; however, in the
interests of privacy and decency I urge you to modify your request
so as to prevent the possibility that your campaign operatives will
root through the private files of constituents who contacted my
office,'' Gorton wrote to Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J. and
chairman of the Senatorial Campaign Committee. ``My record on the
issues can and will be aired and debated openly on the campaign
playing field without instructing federal employees to intrude into
the private lives of individuals to fulfill a political agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns marched down to the Senate floor to denounce the action,
and dashed off a letter to President Clinton demanding his
intervention.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are witnessing is an unprecedented attempt to corrupt
the non-political casework system of Senate offices for political
gain,'' Burns said. ``I find these efforts repugnant, and if there
are any Americans alive who think politics can't sink any lower,
they need look no further'' than the Democratic Senatorial Campaign
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic officials professed shock at the response, but said
they would clarify their request to emphasize their desire to
protect the privacy of constituents. They said the Freedom of
Information Act requests are ``a common, routine, and wholly
appropriate research function.'' They said the names of
correspondents would be blacked out before being released.
</P>
<P>
   ``This committee is seeking _ and by law can receive _ only that
information which goes directly to a senator's official duties and
interventions with federal agencies,'' said committee spokesman Jim
Jordan. ``In our view, a senator's contacts with and attempts to
lobby federal agencies are a perfectly legitimate subject of
scrutiny by this Committee and by the public alike, bearing
directly on his or her effectiveness and philosophy of
government.''
</P>
<P>
   William Walsh, a D.C. attorney who is an expert on the Freedom
of Information Act, said he considered the Democrats' request novel
but appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's rather broad, to say the least, and it's unique in my
opinion,'' Walsh said. ``But it might serve a good purpose to show
how our officials are serving the public. If this was being done by
newspapers, it would be absolutely appropriate and incredibly
illuminating. All parties should do this.''

SALMON RUNS ON CANADA'S WEST COAST IN DISMAL STATE, REPORT FINDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Once-abundant salmon runs of Canada's west coast have
suffered drastic declines in recent years due to habitat
destruction, overfishing and changes in ocean conditions, the
Vancouver-based Pacific Fisheries Resource Council found in its
first report.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, our salmon catches over the last five years are among
the lowest of the last 50 years. We seem to have gone from many
diverse fish stocks down to a few strong runs,'' said John Fraser,
the council's chairman and former speaker of Canada's House of
Commons.
</P>
<P>
   The decline is most dramatic among chinook and coho salmon,
species that are also imperiled in the Columbia River system and
throughout the Pacific Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   The return of coho salmon to British Columbia's central coast,
Fraser said in an interview, has declined from more than 500,000
fish to fewer than 25,000.
</P>
<P>
   The report released Tuesday said that coho salmon are in danger
from the Skeena River, in northern British Columbia, south to
Vancouver Island and the Strait of Georgia. Last year, Canada
curtailed both the commercial and sport fishery for coho salmon.
</P>
<P>
   But even sockeye salmon, although still abundant in the Fraser
River, are in peril elsewhere along the Canadian coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``The central coast area once supported the second largest
sockeye fishery in British Columbia, after the Fraser. The Rivers
and Smith Inlet fisheries are now essentially closed,'' said the
Council report.
</P>
<P>
   The Council is a quasi-governmental body of experts appointed
last September to advise Canada's fisheries minister David Anderson
on how to conserve and restore endangered salmon runs.
</P>
<P>
   Its report comes less than a week after the United States and
Canada reached a long-term agreement for conserving and managing
salmon runs from the Alaska border to the Oregon coast.
</P>
<P>
   The Council said Canada's Department of Fisheries and Oceans
doesn't have enough money to meet its current conservation mandate
and has lacked resources even to keep track of salmon runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``For example, there is a shortfall in basic (counting) and
assessment monitoring to the extent that only a few stocks,
primarily large ones, have adequate data for their management and
protection,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The report noted that fisheries officials cannot account for
what happened to 3.5 million sockeye salmon that swam up the Fraser
River last year but never reached their spawning grounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state of many salmon stocks is unknown,'' the panel
reported. ``The Council has found that there are such glaring
information gaps ... that no valid conclusions could be drawn about
the state of many stocks. Nonetheless, there is evidence that
salmon biodiversity is being eroded.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 salmon catch along Canada's west coast was about half
the average catch of the last half-century, the Council reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears that unfavorable marine conditions, past
overfishing and habitat damage have been significant causes of the
reduced catch,'' it found.
</P>
<P>
   The Council pointedly delivered its report to both the Canadian
government and British Columbia provincial government, which have
bitterly feuded over fisheries policy.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson on Wednesday defended his department, saying it spends
$220 million (Canadian) in the Pacific region and has invested
major work on restoring salmon habitat.
</P>
<P>
   But many of the streams and logged-over areas needing
restoration fall under the control of the British Columbia
government, noted Sharon Chow of the Sierra Club of British
Columbia, which endorsed the Council report.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have a huge problem between the province and the
federal government, and between Anderson and (British Columbia
Premier) Glen Clark,'' she added. ``And that is not good for
fish.''
</P>
<P>
   Fraser noted, however, that the United States and Canada have
managed to come together after an often-bitter five year dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have created some stability and set out in the direction of
much closer Canada-U.S. cooperation to save fish,'' he said. ``Now
it is time to get our own house in order.''
</P>
<P>
   In a future report, the Council is expected to discuss
breakdowns in Canada's fisheries enforcement, particularly
overfishing in ocean waters and failure to catch poachers once
salmon have begun their upstream migration.

<P>
   KUMANOVO, Macedonia _ NATO was poised to end its air war against
Yugoslavia early Thursday, after Belgrade promised to start pulling
troops out of the embattled province of Kosovo overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of heavily-armed NATO troops stood by to begin pouring
across the Macedonian border into Kosovo within hours of a bombing
halt, under the terms of an agreement reached Wednesday by NATO and
Yugoslav commanders at this border outpost.
</P>
<P>
   ``The war has ended,'' a somber Yugoslav Col. Gen. Svetozar
Marjanovic told reporters gathered here, as civilians hundreds of
miles away in Belgrade celebrated by honking horns and firing guns
into the night air.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's Lt. Gen. Sir Michael Jackson, commander of NATO forces
in Macedonia, said he was prepared to deploy peacekeeping forces --
with British troops in the vanguard -- within hours of a bombing
halt. Jackson, who will also command the peacekeeping forces,
promised to conduct the force so as ``to even-handedly implement
this agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Surrendering after 77 days of bombing by U.S. and allied pilots,
Yugoslavia vowed to withdraw all of the 40,000 Serb troops, police
and paramilitary forces out of war-ravaged Kosovo by June 20. In a
concession, NATO agreed to allow the Serbs 11 days -- instead of a
proposed 7 -- to complete their withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   The pullouts are to take place in several phases, with specific
dates for Serb forces to clear out of three designated zones, as a
NATO-led peacekeeping force of 48,000 -- including 7,000 Americans
-- fills in behind the departing Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, President Clinton expressed guarded optimism that
Serb leader Slobodan Milosevic, the president of Yugoslavia,
appeared to be ready to implement the agreement he accepted in
principal last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the implementation blueprint agreed to on Wednesday
met the conditions essential for enabling an estimated 1.5 million
ethnic Albanian refugees to return in safety to whatever remains of
their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sound agreement that meets all of NATO's demands,''
U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen told reporters at the
Pentagon. ``If the Serbs live up to what they signed, this will end
the killing and begin the peace.''
</P>
<P>
   If Serbs renege, Cohen said, NATO stands ready to resume bombing
at any time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real test will be whether the Serbs live up to this
agreement,'' said Cohen. If not, he said, ``the air campaign would
then continue.''
</P>
<P>
   After 11 weeks of NATO bombing, Serbs were poised be begin
withdrawing from Kosovo early Thursday, under the watchful eyes of
U.S. reconnaissance aircraft, satellites and other intelligence
sources.
</P>
<P>
   If NATO verifies that Serb forces are pulling out of northern
Kosovo along designated routes, U.S. Army Gen. Wesley Clark,
supreme commander of the alliance, would ask the North Atlantic
Council, or NAC, NATO's political arm, to call on Secretary General
Javier Solana to order a suspension in the strikes.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance will suspend the bombing as soon as Yugoslav troops
begin to withdraw, Solana said following quick approval of the deal
by NATO ambassadors at a late-night meeting in Brussels, Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today is a great day for the alliance, but, much more
importantly, it is a great day for the cause of justice for the
people of Kosovo,'' Solana said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have said from the beginning ... we are ready to suspend
air operations once we have verified the beginning of the
withdrawal of the Yugoslav forces,'' Solana said.
</P>
<P>
   A bombing halt would set the stage for immediate action by the
United Nations Security Council on a resolution laying out the
mandate for a NATO-led peacekeeping force in Kosovo. That would
likely be approved within hours of a bombing halt, and would kick
the ball back across the Atlantic to the NAC, which would then
issue orders for the peacekeeping force to begin moving into
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   There are roughly 17,500 NATO troops already pre-positioned in
Macedonia, mostly British and French forces expected to spearhead
the Kosovo peacekeeping force, dubbed KFOR by military planners and
formally called Operation Guardian Force. The lead forces were
alerted earlier this week to be prepared to move on urgent notice
and were reportedly positioned early Thursday to mobilize on
command.
</P>
<P>
   The first U.S. forces to enter Kosovo -- 1,900 Marines -- were
aboard a ship in the Aegean Sea Wednesday night and were expected
to land in Greece either Thursday or Friday to begin moving toward
Macedonia en route to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon estimated that the Marines
could arrive in Kosovo as early as Sunday to begin setting up a
headquarters for U.S. forces in the town of Gnjilane in the
southern part of the province.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the Marines' arrival, Bacon said, a group of 1,700
Army troops, including light infantry from the 82nd Airborne
Division forces from the 1st Armored Division -- now based outside
Tirana, Albania -- would move into Kosovo, along with 200 other
military specialists with expertise needed for establishing the
peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
   Other U.S. forces from bases in Germany began preparing
equipment to be loaded onto trains, Bacon said, to move toward the
Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon said that the full contingent of 7,000 U.S. peacekeeping
troops -- backed by tanks, combat helicopters and artillery --
should be in place inside Kosovo within roughly 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   As they move in, the 82nd Airborne units and the Marines would
move out, Bacon said -- meaning that some 11,000 U.S. troops would
be involved in the operation, but not all at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the elements of peace appeared to fall into place late
Wednesday, NATO continued with air strikes focused on Serb forces
in the field in Kosovo, slamming tanks, artillery, military trucks
and troops wherever they gathered.
</P>
<P>
   NATO said over the past 24 hours its aircraft flew 523 air
missions, including 130 strike sorties and 56 aimed at degrading
the Yugoslav air defense system.
</P>
<P>
   In what appeared likely to be one of the last large attacks of
the war, a pair of U.S. B-52 Stratofortresses caught a large group
of Serbs at a staging area in southern Kosovo, and rained 88 bombs
-- weighing 500 pounds each -- down on the group.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Air Force Maj. Gen. Charles Wald, who briefed reporters on
the attack, said it appeared to have destroyed dozens of military
vehicles, including tanks, armored personnel carriers and trucks,
as well as artillery and other gear. He had no estimate on Serb
casualties.

   KUMANOVO, Macedonia _ NATO was poised to end its air war against
Yugoslavia early Thursday, after Belgrade promised to start pulling
troops out of the embattled province of Kosovo overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of heavily-armed NATO troops stood by to begin pouring
across the Macedonian border into Kosovo within hours of a bombing
halt, under the terms of an agreement reached Wednesday by NATO and
Yugoslav commanders at this border outpost.
</P>
<P>
   ``The war has ended,'' a somber Yugoslav Col. Gen. Svetozar
Marjanovic told reporters gathered here, as civilians hundreds of
miles away in Belgrade celebrated by honking horns and firing guns
into the night air.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's Lt. Gen. Sir Michael Jackson, commander of NATO forces
in Macedonia, said he was prepared to deploy peacekeeping forces --
with British troops in the vanguard -- within hours of a bombing
halt. Jackson, who will also command the peacekeeping forces,
promised to conduct the force so as ``to even-handedly implement
this agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Surrendering after 77 days of bombing by U.S. and allied pilots,
Yugoslavia vowed to withdraw all of the 40,000 Serb troops, police
and paramilitary forces out of war-ravaged Kosovo by June 20. In a
concession, NATO agreed to allow the Serbs 11 days -- instead of a
proposed 7 -- to complete their withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   The pullouts are to take place in several phases, with specific
dates for Serb forces to clear out of three designated zones, as a
NATO-led peacekeeping force of 48,000 -- including 7,000 Americans
-- fills in behind the departing Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, President Clinton expressed guarded optimism that
Serb leader Slobodan Milosevic, the president of Yugoslavia,
appeared to be ready to implement the agreement he accepted in
principal last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the implementation blueprint agreed to on Wednesday
met the conditions essential for enabling an estimated 1.5 million
ethnic Albanian refugees to return in safety to whatever remains of
their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sound agreement that meets all of NATO's demands,''
U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen told reporters at the
Pentagon. ``If the Serbs live up to what they signed, this will end
the killing and begin the peace.''
</P>
<P>
   If Serbs renege, Cohen said, NATO stands ready to resume bombing
at any time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real test will be whether the Serbs live up to this
agreement,'' said Cohen. If not, he said, ``the air campaign would
then continue.''
</P>
<P>
   After 11 weeks of NATO bombing, Serbs were poised be begin
withdrawing from Kosovo early Thursday, under the watchful eyes of
U.S. reconnaissance aircraft, satellites and other intelligence
sources.
</P>
<P>
   If NATO verifies that Serb forces are pulling out of northern
Kosovo along designated routes, U.S. Army Gen. Wesley Clark,
supreme commander of the alliance, would ask the North Atlantic
Council, or NAC, NATO's political arm, to call on Secretary General
Javier Solana to order a suspension in the strikes.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance will suspend the bombing as soon as Yugoslav troops
begin to withdraw, Solana said following quick approval of the deal
by NATO ambassadors at a late-night meeting in Brussels, Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today is a great day for the alliance, but, much more
importantly, it is a great day for the cause of justice for the
people of Kosovo,'' Solana said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have said from the beginning ... we are ready to suspend
air operations once we have verified the beginning of the
withdrawal of the Yugoslav forces,'' Solana said.
</P>
<P>
   A bombing halt would set the stage for immediate action by the
United Nations Security Council on a resolution laying out the
mandate for a NATO-led peacekeeping force in Kosovo. That would
likely be approved within hours of a bombing halt, and would kick
the ball back across the Atlantic to the NAC, which would then

FISHER WILL YIELD KODAK LEADERSHIP TO COMPANY PRESIDENT ON JAN. 1  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a statement whose timing, if not its content, surprised many,
Eastman Kodak Co. announced Wednesday that Daniel A. Carp, 51,
would succeed George M.C. Fisher as chief executive on Jan. 1.
Fisher, who is 58, will remain chairman until his contract expires
on Dec. 31, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Carp, a 29-year Kodak veteran, has been the heir apparent since
he was named president in 1997, and shareholders took the
announcement in stride. Kodak stock barely moved Wednesday, closing
at $69.75, up 25 cents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carp is well respected and experienced, so no one really has
any concerns,'' said Jack L. Kelly, who follows Kodak for Goldman,
Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts do expect that the energy level around Kodak's
headquarters in Rochester will soon be up a notch, though. ``George
thinks of big strategic objectives,'' said Gibboney Huske of Credit
Suisse First Boston. ``Dan is detail-oriented and aggressive, and
you'll see a real acceleration in the pace of change.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, Fisher has given Carp an easy act to follow. Until
this year, Kodak sales were flat, its digital portfolio was
hemorrhaging cash, the rival Fuji Photo Film Co. was eating into
its market share, and its stock price seemed on a roller coaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``George really didn't meet the expectations that were in place
when he joined Kodak,'' Ms. Huske said.
</P>
<P>
   When Fisher was recruited from the top spot at Motorola in 1993,
he was hailed as the wizard who would magically solve Kodak's
problems. Kodak, fearful that digital technology would make its
conventional film business obsolete, had branched into
pharmaceuticals and a polyglot of other businesses. Its growth had
slowed, and it was saddled with huge debt.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher sold those businesses, cleaned up the balance sheet, and
began steering the company toward its current ``digitization
strategy'' of using digital technology to enhance, not replace,
conventional film. He brought more outsiders into the company and
onto its board, and began investing heavily in China and other
emerging markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``He cleaned up a mess of monumental proportions,'' said Ulysses
Yannas, an analyst with Mercer, Bokert, Buckman &AMP; Reid and one of
Kodak's most ardent fans.
</P>
<P>
   But by late 1997, when Fisher's contract was running out, Kodak
was again in a financial mess. The company was reeling from a
strengthening dollar and growing softness in overseas markets; it
was a high-cost manufacturer, and its growing portfolio of digital
products was losing hundreds of millions of dollars annually.
</P>
<P>
   Kodak's board did not blame Fisher; it extended his contract
through 2000, to give him more time to fix the company. He soon
announced a restructuring that would eliminate 19,000 jobs and
shave more than $1 billion from annual costs.
</P>
<P>
   But Fisher did make numerous missteps. He bought a chain of
retail photo stores, only to sell it at a loss. A software business
he bought has never made money.
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts say he should have cut costs much sooner _ and
several say that Carp would have liked to do so. They say that
Fisher pumped money into far too many digital products.
</P>
<P>
   In film, Fisher fought an embarrassing and ultimately
unsuccessful battle to get the World Trade Organization to cite
Japan for unfair market practices. While he was doing that, Fuji
was increasing its share of the U.S. market.
</P>
<P>
   Today, though, Kodak is in fairly solid shape. Its costs are
down, its digital losses are under control, and sales were up 5
percent in the first quarter of this year. ``If our stock weren't
still so undervalued, I'd feel pretty good about everything right
now,'' Fisher said in a joint interview with Carp yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Both men say that Kodak is on track to meet its goal of 8 to 10
percent annual revenue growth by 2004, much of it from the
digitization strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday, I saw someone looking at a picture of his new
grandchild that had been e-mailed to his desktop computer,'' Carp
said. ``That's a modern Kodak moment.''
</P>
<P>
   In hindsight, analysts say they should have expected a changing
of the guard. At an analysts' meeting in April, Fisher spoke
briefly, passed the microphone to Carp, and let him answer
questions. ``He acted like he was passing the baton,'' Yannas said.
</P>
<P>
   Several suggest that the sudden death last month of Harry L.
Kavetas, 61, Kodak's chief financial officer and one of Fisher's
closest advisers, dampened Fisher's enthusiasm. ``The steam seemed
to go out of him after Harry died,'' an analyst said.
</P>
<P>
   Others suggest that the board, which granted Carp 400,000 stock
options last year _ more than twice Fisher's 155,000 options _ was
rushing succession to keep Carp from jumping ship. ``Maybe Dan just
said, `I've got another opportunity, so let's nail this thing
down,''' suggested Michael Ellmann, an analyst with Schroder &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Fisher, Carp has spent his entire 29-year career as a
Kodak man, much of it running Kodak's operations in Europe and
Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher insists that he does not know what he will do next,
although the idea of teaching seems to quicken his pulse. ``Even
when I was still with Motorola,'' he noted, ``I said I'd want to do
something different with my life when I was around 60.''

80 YEARS LATER, MOSCOW DECLARES FOUR ROMANOVS `NOT GUILTY' 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ More than 80 years after they died at the hands of
Bolshevik executioners, the son of Czar Alexander II and three
other members of the Romanov dynasty were cleared of wrongdoing
Wednesday night by the prosecutor general, Russia's chief law
enforcement officer.
</P>
<P>
   Grand Duke Pavel Aleksandrovich Romanov, Czar Alexander's son,
was rehabilitated along with three Romanov princes _ Nikolai
Mikhailovich, Dmitri Konstantinovich and Georgi Mikhailovich _
after a review of their case was demanded by a matriarch of the
family.
</P>
<P>
   The men were cleared by the Administpation for the
Rehabilitation of Victims of Political Repression, which reviews
the cases of people charged with crimes during more than 70 years
of totalitarian Soviet rule.
</P>
<P>
   Galina Vesnovskaya, the director of the office, said the new
judgment was based on what now seem obvious: that the four men were
victims of political reprisals.
</P>
<P>
   No further explanation was immediately offered. The Itar-Tass
news service quoted an employee of the prosecutor general's office
as saying that the review was hampered by scanty evidence of who
ordered the men's execution, but that it was clear in any case that
they had not been fairly charged or tried for any crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Soviet officials suppressed the true nature of the Romanov
executions for decades. But the prevailing view now is that the
Soviet political police, acting on the orders of Lenin and those
close to him, sought to end any remaining threat to the new
Communist regime from the Romanovs and their supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Wednesday that the four men were cleared after an
appeal led by Grand Duchess Leonida Georgiyevna, a matriarch of the
Romanov clan, who contends that her own grandson, Prince Georgi
Hohenzollern-Romanova, is heir to the Russian throne. Now in her
mid-80s, the grand duchess has led several battles this decade to
restore the Romanov name.
</P>
<P>
   In the exhaustively dissected story of the Romanovs, the
executions of Pavel Aleksandrovich and his relatives have received
comparatively little attention. Alexander II, Pavel
Aleksandrovich's father, was czar from 1855 to 1881 and was
succeeded by another son, Alexander III, who was the father of the
final czar, Nicholas II.
</P>
<P>
   The four men's deaths came several months after the bloody and
more infamous executions of Nicholas, his wife Alexandra and most
of their family in July 1918 by a group of Bolsheviks in
Yekaterinburg.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Russia became independent and the Soviet Union
collapsed in 1991, efforts to set the Romanov record straight were
under way, beginning with a successful effort in the 1980s to
unearth the long-hidden remains of Nicholas and his entourage.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995 Nicholas' uncle and former governor of Moscow, Grand
Duke Sergei Aleksandrovich Romanov, was reburied in a Moscow
monastery after his remains were found beneath a Kremlin parking
lot.
</P>
<P>
   The grand duke had been buried in a 14th-century Kremlin church
after he was assassinated in 1905 by a socialist revolutionary. But
Stalin ordered the church torn down and the crypt paved over, and
for decades government limousines parked on top of it.
</P>
<P>
   After years of debate over the proper memorial to Nicholas II _
whose often-insensitive reign helped set off the revolt that
installed communism in the Kremlin _ the czar, his wife, their
children and their servants were reburied last July in a St.
Petersburg chapel that serves as a Romanov family mausoleum.

 &HT;    New world: Refugees dive into cultural gulf
 &HT;    By Christy Oglesby
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Pointing at a map, Fadil Redzic explained to some of
metro Atlanta's newest international residents that MARTA operates
in only two counties _ Fulton and DeKalb, the county in which they
now live.
</P>
<P>
   ``And this DeKalb County, how many villages does it consist
of?'' asked Judah Lul, a Sudan native who moved to Clarkston 12
days ago. ``There is the Mountain of Stone and what else?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Stone Mountain,'' Redzic corrected, adding that DeKalb
includes a half dozen or so small cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is there any place that is forbidden for the refugees?'' Lul
asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``No. This is America. It is a free country,'' Redzic said.
``Wherever you want to go, you can go.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lul, who fled from Sudan first to Ethiopia, remained
uncertain. Some places in Ethiopia, he explained, are off-limits to
refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``In America,'' Redzic said, ``there is no such place.''
</P>
<P>
   That exchange, and others like it during this introductory class
to American culture run by the International Rescue Committee, made
it clear more than just oceans separate the United States and the
native countries of Lul and his classmates. The cultural gulf is
wide, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing that, the U.S. Department of State requires all
organizations that help settle refugees to provide basic
orientation about the American way of life. All refugees arriving
in Georgia _ and elsewhere in the United States _ received some
introduction to the local customs.
</P>
<P>
   But even without that mandate, the resettlement agencies would
probably do it anyway. And they have been orienting refugees _
often. Fleeing war or political persecution, more than 37,000
refugees from around the world have found sanctuary in Georgia
since 1981. More than 15,000 of those arrived in the past five
years.
</P>
<P>
   As more refugees resettle in the metro area, orientation is
``critical for them to be able to move forward with their lives,''
said Deborah Inabinet, the church sponsor coordinator for World
Relief, a local resettlement agency. ``They would have no idea what
to expect if we didn't do this for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Workers with refugee agencies routinely witness why the cultural
introductions are so crucial. Refugees' ``point of reference is so
different,'' said Brian Burt, World Relief's volunteer coordinator.
``When I was in Czechoslovakia, I had friends who didn't comprehend
that I could go from Georgia to Florida without someone stopping me
at the border.''
</P>
<P>
   Within the first few days of arriving at their new American
homes, refugees must learn mundane lessons, such as how to read a
MARTA map and how to use 911. But if they leave their orientation
classes with nothing else, they must understand they are safe from
the conditions that drove them from their homes and that they have
rights and new responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department requires the agencies to cover certain
basics, such as registering for Selective Service, getting required
immunizations and obtaining Social Security numbers.
</P>
<P>
   But each organization conducts the sessions differently.
Catholic Social Services uses two full days to orient refugees they
are helping to resettle. That agency brings in police officers and
people from the Fulton County Health Department and from the state
Division of Family and Children Services to explain how to get food
stamps and other temporary assistance.
</P>
<P>
   World Relief sends caseworkers to the refugees' apartments to
cover the information _ and to explain things such as how to use a
dishwasher and other household appliances.
</P>
<P>
   ``We emphasize personal safety,'' Burt said. ``We tell them
America is a safe country. You don't have to worry about anyone
dropping bombs on you or Mexico invading you, but you have to be
careful here. You have to lock your door. And this is not a rural
area where other people will watch your children. You need to know
where your children are.''
</P>
<P>
   International Rescue Committee takes two hours for its
orientation and conducts the sessions at its offices.
</P>
<P>
   Lul and his three classmates received an introduction to the
mysteries of ATM cards, checking accounts, and laws requiring
drivers to fasten their seat belts and abstain from liquor.
</P>
<P>
   The differences between America and home were numerous _ and
surprising _ to Lul. Few women work in Sudan, and none would
consider striking their husbands in anger.
</P>
<P>
   There's no such thing as ``time out'' for unruly children, and
parents are never concerned about being accused of child abuse
after a severe spanking. And in his homeland, men are not permitted
to give women, even their wives, directions to a rest room, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Skender Shefkiu, a new refugee from Kosovo, and his family
attended the orientation class after Lul. IRC sorts refugees by
language to make translating easier.
</P>
<P>
   Shefkiu arrived in Atlanta last Thursday and doesn't know where
his wife and three younger children are, or even if they are still
alive.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Shefkiu, his sister, niece and son received their
introduction to MARTA. His anxiety over the move and the separation
from his family members seemed temporarily put aside this week as
he listened intently to Zerak Alisairany, an IRC volunteer, who
with the aid of a translator, explained the intricacies of monthly
passes, bus schedules and transfer points.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, Shefkiu and his family exchanged a laugh with the
translator, Bejtush Krasniqi, who fled Kosovo three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Shefkiu's small town of Ferizaj has no public transit, nor
nearly as many cars as there are here. But what struck him most
about America was the social interaction among people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here, there are lots of different people with many
religions,'' he said. ``In Kosovo, there are only three or four
religions and there is no peace. I don't see how there can be no
peace there with just three or four, and you have peace here with
so many nationalities and religions.

TOP 7 REASONS TO KICK THE MINI-SERIES HABIT NOW  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 13) 
</HEADLINE>

   What a spring this has been for the mini-series! From Noah's ark
to Joan of Arc, the subjects have spanned the spectrum. But what's
coming for the fall? While the next round of
plucked-from-the-headlines topics have yet to be plucked from the
headlines, other projects are quickly moving forward.
</P>
<P>
   Although these have not been announced, sources close to
observers (who spoke on the condition of anonymity) have revealed
some of the top-secret plans. You heard it here first. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CORIOLANUS Cashing in on the Shakespeare craze, the producers
have cannily cast the king of the mini-series, Peter Strauss, in
the title role of the haughty patrician warrior, with Jane Seymour
as his wife, Virgilia, and Della Reese as his mother, Volumnia. Don
Johnson and Cheech Marin play the evil Tribunes Brutus and
Sicinius.
</P>
<P>
   THE CANTERBURY TALES If they like Shakespeare, they'll love
Chaucer. Besides, those tales will fit perfectly around the
commercials. The innovative casting includes Michael J. Fox as the
Clerk, George Wendt as the Cook, Tim Allen as the Friar, David
Schwimmer as the Knight, Peter Strauss as the Squire and Calista
Flockhart as the Wife of Bath.
</P>
<P>
   GROVER CLEVELAND John Goodman has nearly agreed to star as the
only man big enough to have been both the 22nd and 24th presidents.
Drew Carey plays his pal Teddy Roosevelt. The highlight of the
second installment, of course, is Cleveland's White House wedding
to his former ward Frances Folsom (Jane Seymour). Cameos include
Peter Strauss as James G. Blaine.
</P>
<P>
   STATE FAIR The recent success of the latest version of Rodgers
and Hammerstein's ``Cinderella'' has sent the producers dipping
back into the work of those plucky tunesmiths. Making his network
singing debut, Peter Strauss plays the happy farmer who takes his
prize pig Blue Boy (Babe) to the fair. Calista Flockhart plays the
farmer's dreamy daughter, who falls for the sharpy reporter (Tim
Allen). Jason Alexander is the farmer's dreamy son who falls for
the sharpy band singer (Shelley Long). Jane Seymour plays Mom.
</P>
<P>
   THE FRENCH REVOLUTION The Czech Republic has inked a deal to
play France during the era of its greatest tribulation, with the
entire population of Switzerland agreeing to take two months off
from whatever it is they do to portray the French. Peter Strauss
will be Louis, Kirstie Alley will be Marie Antoinette, and Kelsey
Grammer will be Robespierre.
</P>
<P>
   THE PHIL RIZZUTO STORY Peter Strauss stars as the plucky kid
from Brooklyn who becomes a beloved Yankee shortstop. Ted Danson
has signed to play Yogi Berra, with Tim Allen as Mickey Mantle,
Kelsey Grammer as Whitey Ford and John Ritter as Casey Stengel.
</P>
<P>
   LEWIS AND CLARK Ted Danson and Mary Steenburgen star as those
fearless explorers, with Jimmy Smits as Thomas Jefferson and
Calista Flockhart as Sacajawea, their intrepid Indian guide. To add
family interest, the animals of the forests and plains will be
played by beloved actors, including John Goodman as the buffalo,
Scott Wolf as the fox, Michael J. Fox as the wolf and Peter Strauss
as the beaver.

SHALIKASHVILI DENOUNCES ARTICLE ON KOSOVO BEING PORTRAYED AS HIS
OWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ It was an extraordinary accusation from a former
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
</P>
<P>
   For the past two weeks, military and political leaders in the
United States and Europe have been poring over a 2,000-word essay
by retired Gen. John Shalikashvili that accuses the Clinton
administration of entering the Kosovo conflict with insufficient
military force to attain victory, and as a result NATO partners _
``appalled by the U.S. mismanagement of the entire conflict'' _ are
moving toward a new collective security policy to minimize American
leadership in the alliance.
</P>
<P>
   There's only one thing wrong with the article, a furious and
baffled Shalikashvili told the Seattle Post-Intelligencer
Wednesday: It's a forgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had absolutely nothing to do with that article,''
Shalikashvili said in a telephone interview from his home in
Steilacoom, Wash. ``Someone has stolen my name.''
</P>
<P>
   Shalikashvili, who retired as the nation's No. 1 military
officer in October 1997, said he first heard about the article when
friends and former co-workers began calling and sending him e-mail
saying they had seen it on the Internet. Shalikashvili said he
immediately called Pentagon spokesman Ken Bacon and asked whether
Bacon should reveal the forgery during one of his daily press
briefings, but after further discussion, they decided to ignore the
spurious document.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon computer experts have attempted without success to
determine the origin of the false essay, Shalikashvili said. A
friend was able to locate an earlier version of the text that did
not contain his name as author.
</P>
<P>
   On May 27, the document, titled ``The World After Kosovo,''
first started circulating in e-mail messages to several West Point
graduates. Word and copies of the article quickly spread.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after it first appeared, Shalikashvili got a call from
U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, who Bacon said had
been handed a copy of the article by the president of Finland,
concerned that the article might complicate negotiations between
NATO and Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Shalikashvili, who was Joint Chiefs chairman during the 1995
NATO intervention in Bosnia, said he was particularly outraged over
the article because ``it doesn't represent my sentiment (on Kosovo)
at all.''
</P>
<P>
   In the fake article, Shalikashvili was purported to have said,
``Kosovo will undoubtedly bring to a close what we might call the
era of casual intervention by the United States. ... There is
nothing like failure to increase sobriety.''
</P>
<P>
   Shalikashvili said he has been careful since his retirement not
to interfere with ongoing military operations out of basic courtesy
toward his successor, Army Gen. Hugh Shelton. ``My feeling is I
would only complicate the issue,'' the general said. ``The people
in charge of trying to deal with it have their hands full and I
would not be helpful by kibitzing from the sidelines.''
</P>
<P>
   The general said he decided to break his silence over the
forgery when he realized it was continuing to generate controversy.
``I was hoping that it would go away, but this thing doesn't seem
to be dying,'' Shalikashvili said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what his comrades and former associates had thought of the
article, Shalikashvili hesitated, then chuckled. ``Some people have
called me and said, `Congratulations, this is terrific,' while
others have said, `How could you write such a thing?'''

DEMOCRATIC COMMITTEE WANTS TO EXAMINE CORRESPONDENCE TO SEN. SLADE
GORTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Slade Gorton's last campaign slogan was
``Slade Gorton works for you.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Democrats are about to figure out whether that's
true.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee has filed Freedom
of Information Act requests with multiple federal agencies,
demanding copies of all correspondence from Gorton, R-Wash., and
his staff from the senator's entire 18 years in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The committee, whose vice chairwoman is Sen. Patty Murray,
D-Wash., is seeking the same information about every other
Republican senator up for re-election next year.
</P>
<P>
   The sweeping Freedom of Information Act requests are part of
what's called in Washington ``opposition research,'' and is known
more colloquially as digging for dirt. The Democrats are seeking to
see what they might unearth that might be useful in a campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton and Sen. Conrad Burns, R-Mont., erupted with indignation
upon learning of the probe. Gorton compared the incident to the
Bush administration's perusal of candidate Bill Clinton's passport
records and the Clinton administration's review of FBI files on
numerous Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your committee may be within the strict letter of the law to
pursue this Freedom of Information Act request; however, in the
interests of privacy and decency I urge you to modify your request
so as to prevent the possibility that your campaign operatives will
root through the private files of constituents who contacted my
office,'' Gorton wrote to Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J. and
chairman of the Senatorial Campaign Committee. ``My record on the
issues can and will be aired and debated openly on the campaign
playing field without instructing federal employees to intrude into
the private lives of individuals to fulfill a political agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns marched down to the Senate floor to denounce the action,
and dashed off a letter to President Clinton demanding his
intervention.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are witnessing is an unprecedented attempt to corrupt
the non-political casework system of Senate offices for political
gain,'' Burns said. ``I find these efforts repugnant, and if there
are any Americans alive who think politics can't sink any lower,
they need look no further'' than the Democratic Senatorial Campaign
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic officials professed shock at the response, but said
they would clarify their request to emphasize their desire to
protect the privacy of constituents. They said the Freedom of
Information Act requests are ``a common, routine, and wholly
appropriate research function.'' They said the names of
correspondents would be blacked out before being released.
</P>
<P>
   ``This committee is seeking _ and by law can receive _ only that
information which goes directly to a senator's official duties and
interventions with federal agencies,'' said committee spokesman Jim
Jordan. ``In our view, a senator's contacts with and attempts to
lobby federal agencies are a perfectly legitimate subject of
scrutiny by this Committee and by the public alike, bearing
directly on his or her effectiveness and philosophy of
government.''
</P>
<P>
   William Walsh, a D.C. attorney who is an expert on the Freedom
of Information Act, said he considered the Democrats' request novel
but appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's rather broad, to say the least, and it's unique in my
opinion,'' Walsh said. ``But it might serve a good purpose to show
how our officials are serving the public. If this was being done by
newspapers, it would be absolutely appropriate and incredibly
illuminating. All parties should do this.''

U.S. PRICE FOR PEACE ESTIMATED TO COST $3.5 BILLION A YEAR 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If you think waging war is expensive, try keeping
the peace.
</P>
<P>
   The military agreement NATO and Yugoslavia signed Wednesday
contemplates an end to the allied bombing and the installment of
50,000 troops, including 7,000 Americans, to keep Yugoslav forces
out of the ravaged province of Kosovo. The U.S. cost of the
peacekeeping force could reach $3.5 billion annually, according to
the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, an independent
accounting organization in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   This prediction does not include the as-yet undetermined U.S.
share of the $473.4 million in aid the United Nations estimates
will have to be provided to the approximately 1.5 million Kosovar
refugees who bolted from their homes to escape Yugoslav leader
Slobodan Milosevic's army. Nor does the estimated amount include
the cost of rebuilding homes, factories and other facilities
damaged or destroyed during the nearly 11 weeks of NATO bombing,
the center says.
</P>
<P>
   Those costs, however, might be quite small if Milosevic remains
in power. The Senate has insisted in a resolution that the United
States not pay toward rebuilding Yugoslavia while he continues to
rule.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has spent about $2.5 billion in waging the
bombing campaign, CSBA analyst Steven Kosiak said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In estimating the expense of peacekeeping, CSBA relied on the
Pentagon's March calculation that it would cost between $1.5
billion and $2 billion annually to deploy 4,000 troops to Kosovo, a
number that has since risen to 7,000. The center also made its
prediction by extrapolating to a Kosovo operation the approximately
$2 billion the United States has spent annually to maintain 9,000
peacekeeping troops in Bosnia during the past three years.
</P>
<P>
   Using the Bosnia experience as a guide, CSBA broke down the
projected costs of a Kosovo operation.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if the Bosnia model holds, about 50 percent of the
U.S. peacekeeping expense would go toward sustaining the troops,
who must be housed, fed, clothed and equipped. In Bosnia, the
United States has used civilian contractors to help with these
functions, including the construction of troop housing, food
service, laundry operations and freight transportation, the center
said.
</P>
<P>
   The next major share of the expenditure _ between 10 percent and
20 percent _ would go toward maintaining and repairing equipment.
These costs would exceed the Pentagon's normal peacetime expenses
because, in a peacekeeping operation, aircraft log more hours in
the air and tanks and other vehicles are used more frequently, CSBA
reported.
</P>
<P>
   The actual deployment would require a relatively small 10
percent of the operation's cost, as troops would be transported to
and from Kosovo on a rotational basis. The additional costs of
paying National Guard or Reserve troops would account for about 10
percent of expenses, the organization said.
</P>
<P>
   Pre-deployment operations, such as special training and
equipment, would eat up about 5 percent of the cost as would the
special compensation for which military personnel serving in Kosovo
might qualify, such as hazardous-duty pay and family-separation
allowances.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon's March estimate for Kosovo peacekeeping was twice
as high, on a per-troop basis, as the amount the United States has
spent to prevent hostilities in Bosnia, CSBA said. But the Defense
Department gave no reason for the disparity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be due to a wide variety of factors,'' CSBA's Kosiak
said. ``For example, (the Pentagon) may have believed that U.S.
forces in Kosovo would have to rely relatively more heavily on
support from forces elsewhere in the region than has been the case
with troops in Bosnia. In any case, given the level of damage to
buildings, bridges, roads and other infrastructure in Kosovo ...
this higher-end estimate may represent a better estimate of likely
peacekeeping costs.''

LAWMAKERS WRANGLE OVER US PEACEKEEPING ROLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Despite an agreement on peace in Kosovo, political
wrangling continued in Congress over how to handle the end of the
conflict. Members of both parties used the developments to defend
positions they staked out months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Several House Republicans objected to the use of US peacekeeping
troops, vowing to vote Thursday to prevent funding for a ground
operation. Many Democrats heralded the peace agreement signed
Wednesday as proof the White House strategy had worked, predicting
that any effort to cut off military funding would be defeated.
</P>
<P>
   And yet for the first time in 78 days of NATO airstrikes, there
was a palpable sense of optimism that peace was at hand. Elected
officials spoke in far gentler terms than the month before, when
the House declined to support the air war and some Democrats
harshly questioned the US military strategy. On Wednesday, almost
no one attacked the Clinton administration for reaching an
agreement with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic _ a criticism
that was being aired as recently as last week.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did elected officials sound as skeptical that the plan would
work. Last Friday, Senator John F. Kerry said he had ``serious
questions'' about the plan accepted by Milosevic. Wednesday night,
after reviewing the details of the agreement, Kerry called it ``a
very positive next step.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a significant advancing of the principles that
were set out previously,'' said Kerry, a member of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee. ``It's real progress. Obviously, the
key now is that they don't stall or stop somewhere...But I think by
and large we're on a good track.''
</P>
<P>
   Senator John Warner, a Virginia Republican who is chairman of
the Senate Armed Services Committee, emerged equally confident from
a phone conversation with Defense Secretary William S. Cohen,
saying: ``I'm just greatly relieved.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, critics turned their attention away from the military
campaign and toward the peacetime strategy intended to take its
place.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans spent the afternoon debating defense
legislation that would cancel US funding of the airstrikes on Sept.
30. When Representative Ike Skelton, a Democrat from Missouri,
announced the Yugoslav peace deal on the floor of the House _
prompting a round of applause from both sides of the aisle _ it
became clear the issue of cutting off funds was moot.
</P>
<P>
   Several Republicans quickly shifted to address the composition
of the peacekeeping force, arguing that European troops should be
responsible for safeguarding their own continent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people can rightfully ask: What are we getting
into? What are we being asked to do here?'' said Representative
Porter J. Goss, a Florida Republican who is chairman of the House
Select Intelligence Committee. ``I think this is a job the
Europeans could handle very well. And there are questions,
certainly, I want answered before one single American goes in
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican presidential candidate Steve Forbes echoed the cry,
calling the deal a ``a pivotal moment in US-European relations.''
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert refrained from the domestic
political debate. ``All Americans should be proud of the work of
our men and women in uniform, who conducted themselves in an
exemplary and professional manner,'' he said in a statement. ``I
hope the people of Yugoslavia see this as an opportunity to replace
their leadership, especially Mr. Milosevic.''
</P>
<P>
   But as the House prepared to take up a measure that would
prevent funding for peacekeeping troops, a spokesman for majority
whip Tom DeLay said there were still many skeptical Republicans who
never wanted the United States to be involved in the first place.
DeLay's spokesman, Mike Scanlon, said ``peace was always good,''
but the provision to cut off funding had ``a good chance of
passing.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said that even if the legislation does pass, funding
would come from another source, possibly in a supplemental spending
bill. But on the other side of the Capitol, Senator Phil Gramm, a
Texas Republican, indicated that the political divide over the
troops would not be so easily bridged.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm for peace,'' Gramm said. ``Unfortunately, it looks like
this so-called peace is going to keep us in Kosovo for another
25-30 years.''

   VENTURA, Calif. _ As the saying about kayaks goes, you don't
ride in 'em, you wear 'em.
</P>
<P>
   With a conventional kayak, the lower half of the kayaker's body
fits through a ``manhole'' and into a cavity that conforms to the
boater's legs, feet, hips and posterior. While the arrangement
might be superior for heat retention, protection from spray and
aerodynamics, it requires knowledge of several recovery paddle
strokes, the wet exit and the Eskimo roll _ a self-righting
technique used in a capsizing.
</P>
<P>
   Enter the sit-on-top kayak, aka the wash-deck kayak, upon which
one sits in a recessed, self-bailing cockpit. The kayaker can move
around, isn't joined at the hip with the boat and doesn't need to
know from rolls.
</P>
<P>
   Sit-on-tops range from short, stubby ``surf skis'' to thin,
20-foot-long open-ocean rockets. Most recreational models fall in
the 12- to 14-foot category with widths of 28 to 32 inches that are
generally big enough to accommodate the kayaker, some camping
equipment, and child or dog in the cockpit. Most are made from
molded polyethylene; pricier models use Kevlar, fiberglass and
proprietary materials.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Sit-on-tops) have helped the sport of kayaking grow
immensely,'' said Doug Schwartz, owner of the South Wind Kayak
Center in Irvine. ``They have really brought kayaking into the
mainstream.''
</P>
<P>
   With a weight of 50 to 60 pounds, they're easy to transport by
car-top. The cost: $400 to $2,300, with most models at around $600.
</P>
<P>
   One beauty of kayaking is that no boat registration is required
in the state of California.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the benefits over traditional kayaks, this doesn't
mean that sit-on-top kayaking is for everyone under all conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big advantage is that if they tip over, you just climb
back on,'' said Schwartz, ``but that doesn't mean they are any
safer than any other kayak. Skill, experience and making sure your
equipment matches your environment all play a part.''
</P>
<P>
   For anyone interested in breaking into the sport, ``The Kayaking
Sourcebook'' by Cecil Kuhne (Globe Pequot Press; $18.95) is a
one-stop resource for pricing equipment, comparing models and
locating such items as how-to videos, folding kayaks, flotation
devices, build-your-own models, paddling mitts and car-top
carriers. It also contains event listings, and addresses and Web
sites of manufacturers and kayaking organizations.

CLINTON ORDERS INVESTIGATION ON POSSIBLE RACIAL PROFILING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich., N.J.)  (rk) 
 By STEVEN A. HOLMES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Declaring racial profiling ``morally
indefensible,'' President Clinton on Wednesday ordered federal
law-enforcement agencies to compile data on the race and ethnicity
of people they question, search or arrest to determine whether
suspects are stopped because of the color of their skin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Racial profiling is in fact the opposite of good police work
where actions are based on hard facts, not stereotypes,'' the
president said. ``It is wrong, it is destructive and it must
stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he was issuing a presidential directive requiring
all federal law-enforcement agencies, like the Federal Bureau of
Investigation, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the National
Park Service, the Customs Service and the Immigration and
Naturalization Service, to gather detailed demographic data on
their activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Justice Department will then analyze this data to assess
whether and where law enforcement engage in racial profiling, and
what concrete steps we need to take at the national level to
eliminate it anywhere it exists,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton acknowledged that because the vast bulk of police work
was carried out by state and local agencies, and not the federal
government, his directive would have limited i-pact on the practice
of racial profiling. But he challenged state and local police
forces to follow his lead in determining the extent of the
practice.
</P>
<P>
   The president Wednesday also threw his support behind a bill
requiring the attorney general to analyze data from a sample of
jurisdictions on stops for traffic violations by state and local
law-enforcement agencies. The study would look at the race,
ethnicity and sex of the driver, what prompted the stop, whether
the vehicle was searched, and if so, what contraband was found and
whether an arrest was made.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, sponsored by Rep. John Conyers Jr., D-Mich., is
identical to one that passed the House last year, but stalled in
the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The president's remarks Wednesday, at a Justice Department
Conference on Strengthening Police-Community Relations, came in
response to months of lobbying by civil rights and civil liberties
groups in the wake of the killing by New York City police officers
of Amadou Diallo, an unarmed West African immigrant.
</P>
<P>
   Those groups have urged Clinton to make a forceful statement
against racial profiling, using race or ethnicity as a criterion
for stopping someone to question or search them.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has also been particularly controversial in New
Jersey, where a recent analysis of stops by state troopers on the
New Jersey Turnpike appeared to support the contention that
vehicles driven by black and Hispanic motorists were being stopped
and searched disproportionately.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was seated on stage Wednesday with a number of civil
rights leaders including Al Sharpton, the black minister and
political activist from Brooklyn who led protests after the Diallo
killing that brought some changes in police practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some say that police misconduct is an inevitable byproduct of
the crackdown on crime,'' Clinton said at Wednesday's gathering.
``I don't believe that's so. As a society we don't have to choose
between keeping safe and treating people right, between enforcing
the law and upholding civil rights. We can do both.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the leaders praised Clinton's actions, some civil
libertarians grumbled that they did not go far enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just a mandate to gather statistics, not a mandate to
solve the problem,'' said Laura Murphy, director of the Washington
office of the American Civil Liberties Union. ``But I don't want to
be too negative. This is an important first step.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It is unclear how much Clinton's directive will affect the
activities of federal law-enforcement agencies. The two federal
agencies whose officers have to make the most decisions on whether
to home in on a particular individual out of a large mass of people
are the Immigration and Naturalization Service and the Customs
Service, both of which have to look over people entering the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Cardona, a spokeswoman for the immigration service, said
the agency did not use racial profiling to determine which of the
millions of people entering the country through legal ports of
entry it would question.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't believe it's a legitimate enforcement tool,'' Ms.
Cardona said. ``What the INS uses is a list of factors, one of
which is the appearance of an individual. But that in no way means
that an INS enforcement official is to look at the race of an
individual alone.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, in response to delays at ports of entry, the Customs
Service switched from closely questioning nearly everyone, to
inspecting a select group of people, and in recent years it has
been accused of racial bias.
</P>
<P>
   In response to lawsuits, Customs began compiling demographic
data on those who had their luggage searched, or were frisked,
X-rayed or strip-searched at selected locations. Last month the
agency began collecting such data at all ports of entry.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Customs conducted 2,500 ``intrusive'' searches on the
more than 70 million people who arrived in the United States at
legal ports of entry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's absolutely necessary for us to do this to have a handle
on these allegations of bias,'' said Raymond W. Kelly, the
commissioner of the Customs Service and a former New York City
Police commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   Concerns over racial profiling have intensified as questions of
police abuse against minorities have risen. This week a federal
jury in New York City convicted a city police officer in connection
with the beating and torture of Abner Louima, a black Haitian
immigrant in a Brooklyn police station. Two weeks ago another
officer, Justin Volpe, pleaded guilty to charges of violating
Louima's civil rights.

IF ELECTED, BUSH SAYS, HE'LL OPPOSE TAX INCREASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also GOP-FUNDRAISING) 
(sw) 
 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Gov. George W. Bush of Texas has broken with his
practice of keeping his views on controversial national issues
under wraps until he officially begins his presidential campaign by
promising that if he is elected president, he will try to block any
proposed tax increase.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the no-tax pledge has been a staple of Republican
politics in New Hampshire, which always holds the first
presidential primary. All of Bush's rivals for the presidential
nomination next year have taken the pledge.
</P>
<P>
   Until this week, Bush had avoided doing so. But on Tuesday, he
sent a letter to Grover G. Norquist, director of Americans for Tax
Reform, who originated the idea of the pledge in 1986, saying:
</P>
<P>
   ``You know from our conversations that if elected President, I
will oppose and veto any increase in individual or corporate
marginal income tax rates or individual or corporate income tax
hikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such increases would reduce productivity, remove money from
the pockets of Americans at a time when taxes already take a record
peacetime share of national income and hurt our country's ability
to provide high quality, high paying jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will also oppose any further reduction or elimination of
income tax deductions and credits, unless offset dollar for dollar
by reducing tax rates.''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Bush will begin his first campaign foray with trips
to Iowa and New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Norquist said Bush had told him that he would sign the pledge
after the Texas Legislature ended its session on May 31.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, the first year the pledge figured in the Republican
presidential primary, Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas refused to sign it.
Vice President George Bush, the governor's father, used this
against Dole and went on to win the primary, the Republican
nomination and the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   At the Republican convention that year, he made his famous
pledge, ``Read my lips: no new taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   But in 1990, to obtain a budget agreement with the Democratic
Congress, President Bush signed a law raising income taxes. When he
sought re-election in 1992, Bush was chided in Democratic
commercials featuring his pledge.

SAMPRAS TO JOIN DAVIS CUP TEAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pete Sampras, the prodigal American, returned to the fold
Wednesday, properly contrite, humble, and speaking words of red,
white, and blue. Wednesday Sampras officially announced he has
agreed to play for the US Davis Cup team in next month's
quarterfinal matches against Australia in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very sensitive about jumping on the bandwagon, so to
speak,'' said Sampras, who said he was ``inspired'' watching Jim
Courier and Todd Martin lead the US over England in a first-round
match in April.
</P>
<P>
   ``They made the commitment to go over there and I didn't,'' said
Sampras, who not only will play at the Longwood Cricket Club but
also has committed to play the rest of year if the US advances. ``I
want them (Courier and Martin) to know I'm sensitive to joining the
team and I don't want to come across that I'm taking away their
glory.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Sampras is so sensitive to his appearance as a latecomer
that he stated categorically, ``I've decided I'm just going to play
doubles.''
</P>
<P>
   Courier and Martin have made the sacrifice and deserve the
singles spotlight, Sampras said time and again. ``For me to play
singles,'' said Sampras, ``I'm not comfortable with that. The only
way I would feel comfortable would be if Jim or Todd got hurt,''
and he would be forced to fill in.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Gullikson, the US Davis Cup captain, was not as definitive
as Sampras in relegating America's best player to doubles.
Gullikson more than left the door to singles play open, saying,
``Todd and Jim played great in England and they certainly deserve
first shot at singles but we are a team and once you get on a team
there is some flexibility'' as to who plays whom. ``A lot can
happen between now and July 16.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin, for his part, displayed no ruffled feathers or bruised
toes from Sampras's refusing to play for the United States earlier.
If Gullikson decides to use Sampras in a singles match, ``I would
have no grudges about being substituted,'' said Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Martin was forced to miss the French Open with a sore shoulder
and played his first match in weeks this week at the Queen's Club
grass court tournament in England. Martin said he expects his
shoulder to be recovered by Wimbledon and the Davis Cup matches
here in July, but if the injury flares up, having Sampras in
reserve is a reassuring prospect.
</P>
<P>
   And, although Gullikson never said it directly, the captain most
likely will go with Courier and Martin in the opening singles
matches with Australia out of deference to their loyalty but might
call on Sampras in the closing singles, particularly if the US is
in dire straits.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras is 16-7 (13-6 in singles) in five previous Davis Cup
appearances. And he explained his change of heart by saying he has
now realized there is more to life in tennis than being No. 1 in
the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being No. 1 takes a lot out of you,'' said Sampras, ``and at
the end of last year I was pretty miserable.'' Ironically, Sampras,
ranked third in the world, moved closer to regaining the No. 1 spot
Wednesday, thanks in part to losses by No. 1 Yevgeny Kafelnikov and
No. 2 Pat Rafter. Sampras struggled to beat Todd Woodbridge, 6-4,
6-7 (8-10), 6-4, in the second round of the Queen's Club tournament
as Kafelnikov lost, 3-6, 6-3, 6-3, to Sargis Sargsian. In Germany,
Rafter lost to Jan Siemerink in the Gerry Weber Open.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras conceded that he rejected overtures to play for the
United States before because of the effect being on the team would
have on his tour schedule and how it might affect his goal of being
the top player in the world. But he had a change of heart after
watching the gallant effort of Courier and Martin in defeating
England.
</P>
<P>
   ``Much as I would love to finish the year at No. 1,'' said
Sampras, ``I realized the Davis Cup was an event. It's not about
ranking as it is on the tour. It's about handling the pressure. The
pressure is greater in Davis Cup than the Wimbledon final.''
</P>
<P>
   Even more, he went on, ``there are certainly some great
moments'' being part of a team instead of the solitary struggle of
the tour. ``You come together and bond as a team, which you rarely
do on the tour,'' he said. ``It's a fun week.''
</P>
<P>
   A week after the US beat England, Sampras called Gullikson to
congratulate the captain. ``Pete also discussed his willingness on
returning to the team and his commitment to the Davis Cup,'' said
Gullikson. ``He felt very strongly that Jim and Todd deserved the
singles spots.''
</P>
<P>
   Several four-way conversations involving Sampras, Gullikson,
Courier, and Martin followed. The conversations were sensitive
because the three had more or less felt Sampras was an ingrate for
refusing to be part of the team. But finally, said Gullikson, ``We
all came to the same conclusion that having Pete on the team would
be great for the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Gullikson said he would choose the fourth and final team member
within a week, and that fourth player ``will be a strong doubles
player.'' Martin most likely will not be asked to play singles and
doubles at Longwood, but Sampras said that while he and Courier
have played well as a doubles team, ``I'd like to have Todd'' as
his doubles partner.

3 COMPANIES CLOSE TO $850 MILLION SETTLEMENT IN VITAMIN
PRICE-FIXING SUIT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID BARBOZA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Three of the world's largest pharmaceutical and chemical
companies are negotiating to pay about $850 million to settle a
class-action lawsuit that charges them with conspiring as an
international cartel to fix the prices of vitamins for more than a
decade, according to people close to the talks.
</P>
<P>
   The three companies, all based in Europe _ Roche Holding AG,
Rhone-Poulenc and BASF AG _ are trying to resolve a case that just
a few weeks ago led to the largest antitrust fine in U.S. history,
when Roche and BASF agreed to pay more than $725 million to settle
price-fixing allegations. Because Rhone-Poulenc cooperated in the
early days of the government's investigation, the company avoided
paying a large sanction.
</P>
<P>
   In securing a settlement last month, government antitrust
officials said the decade-long conspiracy affected virtually every
American household. The vitamin conspirators, who met regularly and
sometimes referred to themselves as ``Vitamins Inc.,'' fraudulently
inflated the prices of bulk vitamins that went into everything from
breakfast milk and cereal to orange juice, meats, pet food and even
one-a-day vitamins. The vitamins affected were vitamin A, B2, B5,
C, E and Beta Carotene.
</P>
<P>
   According to people who have been briefed on the negotiations,
the three companies _ which dominate the world's vitamins market _
are eager to end the case, and a settlement is expected to come in
the next week or two. Roche is expected to pay the bulk of the
proposed settlement, up to $500 million, with BASF paying about
$250 million and Rhone-Poulenc paying about $85 million. The
class-action suit is primarily focused on vitamins A, C and E and
the proposed settlement is largely determined by market share.
</P>
<P>
   Among the dozens of plaintiffs in the suit are animal feed
suppliers, food processors and farmers. One of the earliest
lawsuits was filed by the J&AMP;R Feed Services, in Cullman, Ala., in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   If a settlement is agreed to, and people close to the
negotiations say the talks could still break down, that would mean
that altogether, Roche would have agreed to pay more than $1
billion to settle charges that company executives worked in concert
with executives at the other major vitamin makers to allocate
markets and fix the prices of human and animal vitamins, thereby
overcharging American farmers and food processors as well as
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the three drug companies, which control as much as 90
percent of the market for the most popular vitamins, would be
saddled with fines of more than $1.5 billion; the companies also
expect to face antitrust litigation, scrutiny or sanctions in
Canada and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Roche, which is based in Basel, Switzerland, BASF,
which is based in Germany and Rhone-Poulenc, which is headquartered
in France, were unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers with Boies &AMP; Schiller, the Washington law firm that is
leading the class-action settlement, declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   A person close to the negotiations, however, said that the
settlement talks are moving ahead, and the discussion is
``primarily about the money.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Justice Department settlement, Roche paid $500 million
and BASF paid $225 million to settle the case. A former Roche
official, a Swiss citizen who headed the vitamins division, also
agreed to serve a four-month jail term in the United States, and
government investigators said that there could be more indictments.
</P>
<P>
   A number of smaller vitamin manufacturers have also pled guilty
to fixing prices in the market, and Federal investigators say they
are continuing to investigate what they say was an illegal
international cartel that operated in the vitamins market.
</P>
<P>
   All three companies have said that they have been cooperating
with Justice Department officials and publicly hinted that they had
been seeking to settle the class-action lawsuits. Roche has also
said it has begun talks with the European Commission in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   Roche received the largest Justice Department fine, partly
because company executives misled government investigators around
the time it settled charges that it fixed prices in the citric acid
market along with the Archer Daniels Midland Company.
</P>
<P>
   In the class-action case, lawyers have charged thet Roche, BASF,
Rhone-Poulenc and others met repeatedly to allocate sales volumes,
fix and raise prices, and suppress competition in the market,
sometimes by driving out vitamin mixers in clear violation of the
Sherman Antitrust act. Vitamin prices were said to be inflated by
between 20 percent and 40 percent in many instances.
</P>
<P>
   Although the government has targeted a number of high-level
executives at the companies, the chief executive at Roche, said at
a press conference a few weeks ago, that the companies top
executives were unaware of the conspiracy and that the company
would do everything possible to regain the confidence of the public
and its customers.
</P>
<P>
   `'You will understand that this was not part of our
responsibility,'' said Franz B. Humer, the chief executive at
Roche. ``It is certainly not easy to understand the reasons for
actions of employees who in secrecy organized a conspiracy of this
kind.''

   But regulating the sport is supposedly a way of saving ourselves
from ourselves _ overfishing, poaching, polluting.
</P>
<P>
   Well, you can forget about some of the politics _ and some of
the cost _ Saturday during Free Fishing Day, when no one needs a
sport-fishing license to dunk an anchovy or drown a worm. Now you
have one more reason to say, ``Gone fishin','' and concentrate on
relaxing, socializing and just enjoying nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a time for passing on the tradition,'' said Jackie
Kourassis, coordinator of the Department of Fish and Game's
``Fishing in the City'' program for Los Angeles and Orange
counties. ``An angler can share the experience with family, friends
and peers who have wanted to fish but never had the opportunity,
been intimidated or didn't know where to start.''
</P>
<P>
   The event coincides with National Fishing Week. A second Free
Fishing Day is planned Sept. 25 to celebrate National Hunting and
Fishing Day. The DFG cautions anglers that all other fishing rules
and regulations apply Saturday, including size and bag limits,
fishing closures and bait and tackle restrictions. Three area DFG
events are slated:
</P>
<P>
   Juneteenth Fishing Derby: A free catfishing derby takes place
from 8 a.m. to noon at Magic Johnson Lake (formerly Willowbrook
Lake), 905 E. El Segundo Blvd. in Los Angeles, (323) 586-6543.
</P>
<P>
   Family Fish Day: Catfish will be stocked for the 8 a.m. to 1
p.m. event at Santa Fe Reservoir, 15501 E. Arrow Highway in
Irwindale, (626) 334-1065.
</P>
<P>
   Ocean Discovery Day: Marine fish exhibits, a ``crab lab'' and
catch-and-release angling for the purpose of tagging skates and
rays for research are among the activities planned from 10 a.m. to
3 p.m. at the Upper Newport Bay Ecological Reserve and Regional
Park, 600 Shellmaker Road in Newport Beach, (949) 640-6746 or the
www.newportbay.org Web site.
</P>
<P>
   (See the Fishing Report page for a list of area lakes and
landings.)
</P>
<P>
   uuu
</P>
<P>
   In other fishing news: As a reminder to anglers concerned about
the Channel Islands fishing-ban proposals, the state Fish and Game
Commission next week will consider for the first time public
testimony regarding proposed language to better police
marine-managed areas.
</P>
<P>
   Comments taken at the June 18 commission meeting in Point Reyes
Station, north of San Francisco, will shape the policy. In turn,
the policy with impact two separate proposals to ban recreational
fishing and commercial harvesting along no less than 20 percent of
the shorelines of Anacapa, Santa Cruz, Santa Rosa, San Miguel,
Santa Barbara and San Nicolas islands and out to 1 nautical mile.
The commission also will hear a status report on the same pair of
Channel Islands ``no-take'' ecological reserve proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Can't make the meeting? That shouldn't be a problem. The
commission will next meet Aug. 5-6 in Long Beach. And while it will
consider publishing a notice to adopt the new marine-managed policy
and a suggested time line for its implementation, the commission
also is expected to hear further public comment on the issue.
Information: (916) 653-4899.

THE PLEASURES OF THE FESTIVAL, PASTORAL AND OTHER  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 13) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., N.C., Conn.)   (af)  
 By JACK ANDERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here's a little secret I wonder if it's wise for a critic to
share: I often find that traveling to someplace new, or at least
someplace not routinely familiar, puts me in a good mood for seeing
performances.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder I like to pack my bags in summer and go off to the
Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival in the Berkshire Hills of
Massachusetts and the American Dance Festival, since 1978 at Duke
University in Durham, N.C., but before that at Connecticut College
in New London.
</P>
<P>
   Traveling itself can be fun. The bus to Lee, the town closest to
the Pillow, goes along rivers, some spanned by covered bridges, and
through wooded hills and valleys. It's a soothing ride. Durham
requires an air trip.
</P>
<P>
   One journey there for a Merce Cunningham premiere in 1984 proved
unexpectedly and unduly exciting. A violent storm caused my plane
to sway and lurch and change its course for several bumpy hours. By
the time I reached Durham, the premiere was over. I spent the rest
of that evening in a restaurant. Durham has some nice ones.
</P>
<P>
   I vividly remember my first visit to the ADF, as everyone calls
the American Dance Festival. It was 1964, my first summer in New
York, and the program at Connecticut College featured the Martha
Graham Dance Company in works with scores by Louis Horst, Graham's
longtime musical collaborator who had recently died. It was also my
introduction to Graham's choreography.
</P>
<P>
   I was thrilled by the way Ethel Winter kept kicking her leg with
a pioneer woman's determination in ``Frontier.'' But when lines of
women marched solemnly onto the stage and surrounded Yuriko, who
symbolized the Virgin Mary in the stark ``Primitive Mysteries,'' I
was thunderstruck.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, a man introduced to me only as Bill turned out to be
the choreographer William Bales. Selma Jeanne turned out to be the
dance historian Selma Jeanne Cohen, and that night, instead of
going home by train, I found myself riding to New York in a car
with her and other people. I dozed off briefly, then awoke to the
sound of Ms. Cohen reciting Yeats.
</P>
<P>
   I spent pleasant evenings in the Connecticut College auditorium.
But there were also memorable events outside it. In her ``Medley''
of 1969, Twyla Tharp sent a horde of dancers scattering across a
lawn. Then they paused, some close to the audience, others far in
the distance, and began to move so slowly that they scarcely
appeared to move at all. The effect was spellbinding.
</P>
<P>
   The next year, Meredith Monk made the entire Connecticut campus
her stage for ``Needle-Brain Lloyd and the Systems Kid'' and had
the audience follow her dancers from site to site.
</P>
<P>
   The piece began and ended with people rowing across a lake in a
boat. Lawns were filled with galloping horses, speeding
motorcycles, 18th-century aristocrats, genteel croquet players and
Western pioneers. This was mixed media on a grand scale.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't know what to expect of Durham. But I soon grew fond of
this university town, which is also a tobacco town with the aroma
from the factories hanging above the streets. Durham has its
Greenwich Village, a few short but lively blocks on Ninth Street
filled with cafes and bookshops. Duke itself attracts attention
with its two architecturally distinctive campuses: one in the
Georgian style, the other English Gothic and dominated by an
imposing chapel on the scale of a cathedral. I sometimes go there
for noontime organ concerts.
</P>
<P>
   Among the dances I've admired at Duke are Cunningham's
deliberately nonsensical ``Roadrunners'' (1979), in which quirky
movements were accompanied by recitations of fantastic Chinese
legends; Eiko and Koma's ``Beam'' (1983), which made its dancers
struggle up and down a sand dune as if it were Mount Everest; and
Mark Dendy's ``Ritual'' (1996), a spectacle with crowds of people
dancing on stage, up the aisles, along the theater's side walls and
in the lobby in a joyous tribute to the act of performing.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, the festival staged some events in nearby Raleigh.
There, Johanna Boyce presented ``Waterbodies'' in a swimming pool
and had dancers artfully splash and paddle to harp music.
</P>
<P>
   I can't remember when I first went to the Pillow, as Jacob's
Pillow is known. Nor do I recall what I saw. But I do know I was
charmed by the rustic festival site. Originally a farm, the Pillow
still looks like one and although it was specifically built for
dance, its principal theater resembles a barn.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, too, has its appeal. It's a quiet town and at the head of
its green stands a venerable New England church with a tall white
steeple.
</P>
<P>
   Some summers, Jess Meeker, the Pillow's longtime music director,
would invite visitors for drinks on the little terrace outside his
cabin. A genial man, he would reminisce about Ted Shawn, the
Pillow's founder, and about dance luminaries who had appeared there
in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Once, when asked asked why he kept coming back to the Pillow, he
spread his arms wide and said, ``Just look at the place, just look
at the place.''
</P>
<P>
   I, too, love to look at the place, and at performance there.
Over the years, I've attended several programs by soloists from the
Royal Danish Ballet. The sweet, bouncy Danish style seems
especially buoyant in a woodsy setting.
</P>
<P>
   But unusual forms of dance also flourish there. Take ``Unspoken
Territory,'' the astonishing 20-minute solo that the choreographer
Dana Reitz and the lighting designer Jennifer Tipton created for
Mikhail Baryshnikov in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Baryshnikov appeared to be wandering on a journey out of gloom
and into dimly lighted places. At one point, cascades of light
poured down upon him. Yet darkness once again prevailed and he
continued venturing into unknown realms. Baryshnikov seemed to be
exploring an enchanted forest and the fact that there was a real
dark forest outside the theater made the occasion especially
wondrous.
</P>
<P>
   Light and movement were blended in other ways in ``Moving
Images,'' an ingenious program of 1986 in which three
choreographers combined dancing with films. Thanks to cinematic
technology, Victoria Marks made dancers' shadows take on lives of
their own, Kathy Rose danced with cartoons and Pooh Kaye showed
films of apparently rebellious trash cans racing through the
streets while, on stage, dancers tried to manipulate some
particularly unwieldy cans.
</P>
<P>
   I don't think I've ever been at the Pillow when Ted and Ruth
have flown into the theater. I don't mean the ghosts of Shawn and
his wife, Ruth St. Denis, the modern dance pioneer. I'm referring
to two bats, fondly named after these dancers, who make sporadic
Pillow appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Because those bats are reputed to bring good luck, one might
fantasize that they must visit the ADF as well. Both festivals have
been blessed with luck, and I feel lucky to attend them.

MAKING THE EVOLVING ORCHESTRA FIT TO SURVIVE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 13) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By PAUL GRIFFITHS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the Cleveland Orchestra was at Carnegie Hall last month,
giving concerts led by its music director, Christoph von Dohnanyi,
and a former principal guest conductor, Pierre Boulez, Ara
Guzelimian, the hall's artistic adviser, took the opportunity to
convene a public discussion.
</P>
<P>
   The two maestros and Joseph W. Polisi, the president of the
Juilliard School, were asked to speculate on what orchestras might
be like in the next century, as institutional bodies and as
artistic machines.
</P>
<P>
   Being asked to think about the future often makes people talk
about the past, for the good reason that we can know what direction
we are facing only if we know where we came from. So it was here.
</P>
<P>
   Polisi _ not only an educator but also a bassoonist, and a
bassoonist's son _testified to the increasing technical
accomplishment of orchestral musicians and to the correspondingly
more rigorous audition procedures orchestras have had to introduce.
He and Dohnanyi also pointed out that because musicians are now
chosen by a panel rather than by the music director alone, there is
less room for individual taste in orchestral sound.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps another reason for that homogenization is the triumph of
recorded music, which has created a single, global audience. Thirty
years ago, Russian, French and Czech orchestras still had quite
special sounds, and there was a radical difference between, say,
the Cleveland Orchestra and the Philadelphia, or the Concertgebouw
Orchestra and the Vienna Philharmonic. Gradually, the
characteristics are being ironed out.
</P>
<P>
   For Boulez, this is no great loss. He talked, to Polisi's
unconcealed delight, about the bassoon, and about how French
orchestras have in recent decades abandoned the French bassoon in
favor of the German model. The specifically French quality of their
sound has thus been diminished, but the orchestras now have
instruments that can speak in the low register.
</P>
<P>
   If there has to be a contest between a self-conscious
perpetuation of tradition and efficiency, for Boulez the choice is
clear.
</P>
<P>
   But if orchestras are becoming more uniform in general sound,
they are also becoming more adept at changing that sound in
response to what they are playing. Where Wilhelm Furtwangler's
Berlin Philharmonic performed Bach and Brahms in much the same way,
modern orchestras are having to develop historical techniques
appropriate to Bach, and indeed to Brahms, as we become ever more
aware of how musical practice has changed.
</P>
<P>
   So a variability rooted in geography, with orchestras in Paris
and Prague sounding quite different, is being replaced by one
responsive to time.
</P>
<P>
   Orchestras that are fixed in time rather than place _ like John
Eliot Gardiner's Orchestre Revolutionnaire et Romantique, which
rarely ventures outside the first half of the 19th century _
perform in the universal network of recording technology rather
than in a city concert hall. Also, they have to play a work only
once for it to be available all over the world and, potentially,
forever.
</P>
<P>
   Such orchestras have played the dominant role in the
period-style movement since the 1970s, and it could be that they
represent the future. Specialized groups of players, schooled in
the performance style of a particular epoch or composer, will come
together to make recordings, and their only concerts will be given
in a few large centers on promotional tours.
</P>
<P>
   But that cannot be a satisfactory vision for anyone who believes
in the values of live music, of the public musical occasion, of
diversity to balance specialization, and of the role music can play
in the life of a city. The question then becomes how to maintain
those traditional values of the orchestra while also facing the
challenges of the ways in which music changed in the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   The usual posture so far has been to avoid those challenges,
whether they have come from the early-music movement or from living
composers. Indeed, there can be few institutions of any kind that
have survived the 20th century with so little change.
</P>
<P>
   Administrators (who are around all the time) may have more
weight now than music directors (who are not), but in terms of
concert planning, repertory, hall, season and financing, most
orchestras are doing now pretty much what they did a hundred years
ago. In the 19th century there was substantial change in all those
areas, as there was also in the orchestra's instrumental makeup.
</P>
<P>
   Two conclusions are possible. Either the orchestra, which has
survived so long and so much, will go on surviving, perhaps with an
even more conservative and circumscribed repertory, or else change
must soon come. Probably both stories will be played out at the
same time, with some orchestras continuing much as they are and
others looking for ways to change.
</P>
<P>
   Those in search of such ways might well begin with ideas that
Boulez has been trying to promulgate since he first became
associated with the Cleveland Orchestra, more than 30 years ago:
ideas that he began to institute when he was music director of the
New York Philharmonic and BBC Symphony in the 70s and that more
recently helped shape the Cite de la Musique in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   He passionately elucidated those ideas at the Carnegie Hall
symposium. Music now is far more various than it was in the days of
Brahms, and the life of an orchestra should reflect that variety,
for the sake of its members as much as its audience.
</P>
<P>
   The orchestra should be not one thing but many: besides giving
symphonic concerts, it should at times be an opera orchestra, a
Haydn-Mozart orchestra, a contemporary-music ensemble. There should
be opportunities for players to give chamber concerts, and the
orchestra's home, the concert hall, should be open not just between
8 and 10 in the evening.
</P>
<P>
   It should, rather, be a center of documentation, printed and
electronic, where people could go to read about, study and listen
to music. It might also incorporate a music museum and an
educational institution.
</P>
<P>
   Most orchestras have adopted one or another of such endeavors in
recent years, but none have become the kind of multipurpose,
performing-teaching body Boulez has been advocating. Dohnanyi, for
his part, firmly endorsed his colleague's hopes, but gave, too, the
reason they have not been embraced by orchestras around the globe:
money.
</P>
<P>
   At a time of financial stringency in the arts, it might seem a
pipe dream to imagine an orchestra working from within a
library-school-museum-auditorium complex and providing, besides its
big public events, a multitude of smaller performances and
continuing opportunities for people to deepen and broaden their
musical experience through self-education.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, if the orchestra is not to be a real musical
heart for its city, what is it?

 &HT;    Remove money-taking Gators from record books, coach says
 &HT;    By Andy Staples
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Florida cornerback Tony George could go into the
school record book as the top player on last year's defense, even
though a trio of NFL draftees had better statistics and a bigger
impact.
</P>
<P>
   Florida coach Steve Spurrier hopes to expunge linebackers Jevon
Kearse and Johnny Rutledge and defensive tackle Reggie McGrew from
the record book after the players admitted under oath to taking
money from South Carolina-based agent William ``Tank'' Black while
still playing for Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Officials have banned the three from the university's athletic
facilities, and the former players cannot visit practice or walk
the sidelines at games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to come up with a punishment to fit the crime,''
Spurrier said Tuesday before speaking to the Atlanta Gator Club.
``It's harsh, but they did wrong, and now they have to accept the
punishment.''
</P>
<P>
   McGrew's father, Taylor, said he thinks the coach is trying to
go too far.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little disappointed in the fact UF seems to think
they've done a horrible, horrible thing,'' he said. ``It's wrong. I
don't condone it. I think it's OK to ban the players, but to take
pictures down from the locker room is going too far.''
</P>
<P>
   Kearse, speaking Wednesday from Tennessee Titans training camp
in Bellevue, Tenn., said he was just trying to put the scandal
behind him and get on with his career. He did concede that not
being allowed to visit his former team hurt his feelings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know the whole story about why, but I guess I just
have to deal with it,'' Kearse said. ``It's just a long process,
and I'm going to have to put it behind me.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida athletics director Jeremy Foley said no final decision
has been made to delete the players' names from the record books,
but he said they definitely are not allowed to use school
facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Foley also said that Florida officials had made no decision
about suing the players to recoup the cost of an ongoing university
police investigation into Black's activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pretty simple decision,'' Foley said. ``Why would you
want them around our current players? We don't want them having
contact and giving advice to them. That's how coach Spurrier sees
it, and I don't think anything is too harsh in this situation. I'm
completely behind coach Spurrier.''
</P>
<P>
   Kearse, Rutledge and McGrew admitted in interviews with campus
police to taking money. Black also reportedly bought Kearse a
$133,500 Mercedes two days before the Orange Bowl. Black's
attorney, Leonard Mungo, said the car was a surprise and that
Kearse did not see it before the game.
</P>
<P>
   A fourth player, linebacker Mike Peterson, also was interviewed
but has not been connected to any illegal payments.
</P>
<P>
   All four players fired Black in late April. Kearse, Rutledge and
McGrew hired Leigh Steinberg, while Peterson hired Miami-based
agent David Canter. Black could face felony charges when the
investigation ends.
</P>
<P>
   Spurrier, who has advocated paying athletes a monthly stipend,
said the scandal did not change his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always said we should have a college football playoff.
I've always said we should pay players $100 a month,'' Spurrier
said. ``But that doesn't change the fact that these guys broke the
rules, and now they're paying for it.

 &HT;    Vieri heads to Inter Milan
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ While Jean-Marc Bosman remains destitute and largely
ignored by the nouveau riche of European soccer, Christian Vieri,
the richest among them, continues to roll in a growing pile of
lire. Billions and billions of lire, in fact.
</P>
<P>
   For the fourth time in the past five seasons, Vieri is moving to
a new club, and he has the unheralded Belgian to thank for
escalating transfer fees that came out of Bosman's push for
European free agency earlier this decade.
</P>
<P>
   Vieri went from Lazio to Inter Milan on Tuesday for a
world-record transfer total of roughly $50 million (90 billion
lire), breaking last year's mark set by Brazilian Denilson in a $35
million move to Spain's Real Betis. That topped the $28 million
involved when Atletico Madrid shipped Vieri to Lazio in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Bosman was playing for Belgian club Lierge when he challenged
its decision to command a transfer fee for his desired move to
France, even though he was out of contract. He eventually took his
case to the European Court, which invalidated that practice in 1995
and also eliminated limits on foreign players in European Union
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Of the top 50 European transfer amounts, only eight are
pre-Bosman. Vieri's 1996 move from Juventus to Atletico Madrid for
$19.3 million to begin his personal revolving door is the
13th-highest. Players and their agents pocket roughly 10 percent to
15 percent of a transfer fee, with the remainder going to the
selling club.
</P>
<P>
   At Inter, Vieri will team up with Brazilian star Ronaldo, whose
move there from Barcelona after just one season in 1997 for $27.9
million is in fourth place, and whose price tag to Spain from PSV
Eindhoven was $20 million. As part of the Vieri deal, Inter will
ship Argentina midfielder Diego Simeone to Lazio in a transaction
worth a mere $11.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Like Curt Flood in baseball, Bosman never played professionally
again. According to this month's issue of World Soccer magazine, a
recent letter he mailed to top players in England, Germany, Spain
and Italy seeking donations for his expenses has gone largely
unanswered.
</P>
<P>
   Euro 2000: England on ropes
</P>
<P>
   So Kevin Keegan's managerial honeymoon is over. And how. Two
dismal ties in the past week have England gasping desperately to
make the Euro 2000 playoffs in the fall. Saturday's scoreless draw
with Sweden at Wembley Stadium was followed Wednesday by 1-1 tie
with Bulgaria in Sofia, even though England had a man advantage for
the final 30 minutes. Alan Shearer scored in the 15th minute, but
Bulgaria got the equalizer three minutes later and gave veteran
Hristo Stoichkov a happy farewell to his international career....
France got a penalty-kick goal from Frank Leboeuf with only four
minutes to play to pull out a 1-0 win over lowly Andorra and avoid
further embarrassment after Saturday's home loss to Russia.
Andorra, which is pointless in Group 4, had given up 19 goals in
its previous six qualifiers.... Despite two humiliating results,
Scotland still has a playoff chance. After a 1-1 draw with the
Faroe Islands on Saturday, the Scots couldn't hold a 2-0 lead and
lost 3-2 to the Czech Republic. Jan Koller got the winner in the
87th minute.... Romanian soccer hero Gheorghe Hagi disappointed his
countrymen when he retired after the World Cup last year, but what
was to have been a one-game comeback in a 2-0 win over Hungary on
Saturday has prompted the 34-year-old forward to resume his
international career. Hagi, who has 33 goals in 116 caps, was in
the lineup as Romania beat their Eastern European rivals for the
first time in 63 years.
</P>
<P>
   Germany: Boy describes attack
</P>
<P>
   A 10-year-old French boy who saw four German hooligans viciously
attack a gendarme after a World Cup game last June described the
incident in court Wednesday, but could not identify any of the
suspects. The boy, testifying in an ongoing trial in Essen,
Germany, said officer Daniel Nivel was struck on the head with a
metal object and signboard and kicked repeatedly in a street in
Lens after Germany's draw with Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>

   Mexico: Toluca wins thriller
</P>
<P>
   Toluca finally triumphed over Atlas 5-4 on penalty kicks Sunday
for the Torneo de Verano title after the teams were tied 5-5 in
aggreggate. A draining overtime session could not settle matters,
as Toluca twice hit the post in the final minutes. Atlas coach
Ricardo Lavolpe was sent off just as regulation ended at 2-2, and
he was treated to a shower of debris from home fans at Estadio
Toluca '70-'86 as he walked off the field. Penalty kicks were
interrupted for several moments when a member of Toluca's bench
baited some of the Atlas penalty-takers, causing a major scuffle.
Goalkeeper Hernan Crisante turned away Julio Estrada in the first
extra penalty-kick session, and Toluca won its second summer title
in a row.

   S. America: 5 ousted in friendly
</P>
<P>
   Five players were ejected, including two in an injury-time
hair-pulling incident, as Brazil topped the Netherlands 3-1 in a
friendly Tuesday. After a challenge for the ball with the final
whistle imminent, Brazil's Rivaldo grabbed Dutch midfielder Edgar
Davids by the dreadlocks and hauled him to the ground. A fight
ensued, and they were shown yellow cards.... Brazil has been chosen
to host the World Club Cup, an eight-team FIFA-sponsored tournament
featuring the continental club-championship winners that will take
place in January.

 &HT;    All pressure on Argentina in rematch
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The last time the U.S. faced Argentina, the 15,000 who
gathered in a small stadium during the 1995 Copa America in Uruguay
couldn't believe the final score: U.S. 3, Argentina 0.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time the Americans had beaten a major world
power outside the United States, but like several of their other
dragon-slaying wins, in the end it didn't have much staying power.
</P>
<P>
   And that's one reason why coach Bruce Arena isn't putting too
much emphasis on winning Sunday's friendly with Argentina at
Washington's RFK Stadium (1 p.m., ABC), the first match for the
U.S. team since it fell to Mexico in the U.S. Cup finals in March.
</P>
<P>
   It should be a good test as the Americans prepare for a
Confederations Cup pool this summer that includes Germany and
Brazil. ``It's important that we play well on Sunday, but it's not
life or death for us,'' Arena said. ``There's not a whole lot of
pressure on us to win this game.''
</P>
<P>
   For Argentina, even friendlies against such historical soccer
minnows as the United States are treated in a serious,
results-oriented vein. Argentina will be sending veterans Diego
Simeone and Ariel Ortega, as it gets ready for the Copa America
next month.
</P>
<P>
   Curse of the Cosmos?
</P>
<P>
   They're on their fifth coach in slightly more than three
seasons, a heavy turnover of players continues, and the Giants
Stadium faithful wonder whether the New York/New Jersey MetroStars
aren't being haunted by the ghosts of the Cosmos.
</P>
<P>
   The MetroStars sank to new lows Saturday in a 5-2 loss to Dallas
before only 11,567 at Giants Stadium. It was an all-American
lineup, but the franchise's futility knows no nationality.
</P>
<P>
   MLS officials say they're making progress in landing a
``marquee'' international player allocated in a trade last week
with the Miami Fusion, but for the moment it can't help a 4-7 club
that has dumbfounded even famous soccer miracle worker Bora
Milutinovic.

 &HT;    Title town at UGA
 &HT;    By Norman Arey
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ No other school in the nation will top the University
of Georgia's four national titles this year. The question for
athletics director Vince Dooley and his staff is what comes next.
</P>
<P>
   When the Bulldogs took national titles in gymnastics and women's
swimming and diving ealier this spring, they tied Georgia's
previous high in championships _ two in 1986-87, in gymnastics and
tennis. Then, Manuel Diaz's tennis team upset top-ranked UCLA two
weeks ago, and Chris Haack's golf squad won its NCAA title on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford holds the record with six national titles in one
academic year, with six in 1996-97. The Cardinal also won five last
year and probably will win the Sears Director's Cup again for
overall athletics excellence.
</P>
<P>
   But Georgia, with 20 sports to Stanford's 30, probably will
finish No. 2 in the Sears standings for 1998-99.
</P>
<P>
   So what do you do with four national titles? ``I don't think
that the awareness level of what has been accomplished in 1999 has
been raised enough,'' said Don Leebern, one of Georgia's biggest
boosters and former president of the state University System's
Board of Regents. ``We've shown we have the ability to have a
consistently high standard in both academics and athletics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's establish it as a new level of excellence (and) raise
the bar,'' Leebern said.
</P>
<P>
   For all of the athletics success this year, most Georgia fans
would prefer a championship in another sport _ football. The
football program has made great strides in Jim Donnan's three
seasons in Athens, but it has been 19 years since Georgia won a
national title on the gridiron and 17 years since its last
conference title.
</P>
<P>
   But the recent success of the football team _ 17 regular-season
wins and a pair of bowl victories in the past two years _ has
helped Georgia fans get excited about the school's other teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Provided the two most visible (sports), the two engines,
football and basketball, have people feeling good, we're in good
shape,'' Dooley said. ``I think people really feel good about
football, and people, for the most part, feel good about the future
of basketball. When those two make people feel good, they feel good
about all of our sports.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not unexpected for Suzanne Yoculan's gymnastics team to
capture the national title, as All-Americans Karin Lichey and Jenni
Beathard headed a group of key returnees from the 1998 championship
team. But the other top finishes came as surprises.
</P>
<P>
   Diaz, who coached five previous teams to the tennis finals,
conceded that some of them were far superior in talent to this one,
but this year's squad led by Talito Corrales, Hisham Hemeda and
Joey Pitts were talented enough to win it all. Jack Bauerle had
been coaching his swimmers 20 years without a title, but Kristy
Kowal and Courtney Shealy helped Bauerle and Georgia end a
championship drought.
</P>
<P>
   Champions to be honored
</P>
<P>
   Haack has been the golf coach in Athens only three years, but
Ryuji Imada helped to carry this team over the top. As the school's
former football coach, Dooley said, ``It took me 17 years to do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's marketing director Avery McLain is meeting with a
collegiate licensing company to put together some plans for
capturing the year and taking advantage of it in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had some T-shirts made up with the logos of the four
sports that read, `The Year of the Dog,''' McLain said. ``We're
planning a series of championship posters for the four sports to
give to the fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Dooley says the four coaches and teams will be honored at
football halftimes in the fall. The two winter sports will share
the halftime of one game, and the two spring sports will be honored
at another.
</P>
<P>
   The coaches will receive an extra month's salary for their
achievements, but more could be on the way, Dooley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been contemplating providing some contracts with
incentives for our coaches in those sports that have been very
successful,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The four also should thrive, at least in exposure, from Dooley's
intent to have them at as many Bulldog Club meetings as possible
over the next few months.
</P>
<P>
   Recruiting gets boost
</P>
<P>
   The success should help in recruiting, as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not starting from scratch,'' Bauerle said. ``You have
credibility walking into the living room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully,'' he said, ``four national championships will
impact everybody. I think it already has raised people's
consciousness. Just watching gymnastics and tennis, people are
going to see a high level of athlete. There's a real feeling for
sports outside of football and basketball, but it's great to be
successful in football, too, and I know that as a coach who's been
here for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it helps in recruiting coaches,'' Dooley said. ``We
were able to get (new baseball coach) Ron Polk. (New basketball
coach) Jim Harrick has the appreciation (that) this is an
all-around program.
</P>
<P>
   Dooley repeated a recent comment from Chris Scelfo, the former
football assistant who took the top job at Tulane: ``You know how
good the (Georgia) program is when you're there, but when you
leave, you really appreciate it.''
</P>
<P>
   Expectations raised
</P>
<P>
   Haack said, ``I think it'll help when kids think about where
they want to play, and maybe they'll put Georgia on their list.
</P>
<P>
   ``The downside is people's expectations that we should do this
every year,'' he said. ``It's hard to build a dynasty in a sport
like golf. We may have great teams for the next 15 years and not
win another one.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's tennis title helped the sport of tennis itself, Diaz
said. ``Locally, it has raised awareness for our sport,'' he said.
``Here in Atlanta, people are taking tennis up again. Tennis has
been on a little of a downslide, and this helped. It was also an
incredible accomplishment for our program.
</P>
<P>
   National championships certainly help the school's name
recognition, the tennis coach said. ``I think there's a great
awareness of Georgia. We had wrapped up our recruiting for this
fall before we won it, but to me the thing is our team competed
with a lot of class and composure. Those are the accolades I like
best, and that's what will draw the players.''
</P>
<P>
   Bauerle put the achievements in perspective. ``We're enjoying
what did happen, and we're not sure of what will happen,'' he said.
``For the time being, we have a lot of happy coaches right now, and
a very happy athletic director.

ON THE TRAIL OF THE AZOREAN DIASPORA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FALL RIVER, Mass. _ If you are searching for the soul of soccer
in the United States, inevitably you end up in places like the
Academica Club on South Main Street in this old fishing town. The
origins of the club are Portuguese, but if you are passionate about
the game, ancestry is irrelevant these days.
</P>
<P>
   There was a celebratory mood Wednesday in anticipation of Dia de
Portugal _ Portuguese Independence Day _ and Thursday night's
exhibition between Clube Desportivo Santa Clara and the Revolution
at Foxboro Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   CD Santa Clara is a small club by European, even Portuguese,
standards. But it has accomplished something big _ it became the
first club from the Azores to advance to the Primeira Division in
Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Santa Clara is taking a victory tour, making contact with
the diaspora, which by now far outnumbers the population of the
islands. Azoreans such as Afonso Costa, who set up this tour,
gambling on the team's success _ Santa Clara's promotion was not
assured until the final minutes of the last game of the season _
have found fortune and new lives in Canada and the US. Club
president Paulino Pavao is hoping this event will help reunite
immigrants with their roots.
</P>
<P>
   But the Santa Clara administrators, coaches, and players know
little about the Revolution, and are generally baffled by the
configuration and rules of Major League Soccer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have nobody of the class of Zenga on our team,'' said coach
Manuel Fernandes, who played for Sporting on a US tour in the early
1980s. ``They might be more experienced than we are but my players
are not intimidated by anyone. We will not play defensively, to
keep the score close, but we will play to please the fans. We will
present a boa figura.''
</P>
<P>
   Fernandes, 48, was a mainstay of the Portuguese national team
and captain of Sporting Clube. He played against Revolution
goalie/coach Walter Zenga in a European Championship qualifying
match, losing, 1-0, to Italy in Lisbon in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   He is curious to see the progress of the game in the US.
</P>
<P>
   ``From analyzing the performance of the US national team, they
are more balanced and competitive than they were 10 to 15 years
ago,'' Fernandes said. ``They are investing more money into the
game and I am sure they will get better if they go to a 20-team
first division, like in England and other places, with a good
lower-division supporting it.''
</P>
<P>
   Azorean soccer has only produced one national team player _ left
winger Pauleta, who is now playing in Spain. The Azorean and
Madeiran immigrants brought their club tradition to the US, and
they must have also imported some of the higher levels of the
soccer gene pool. The US team that conquered England in the 1950
World Cup was composed of several players from the Ponta Delgada
Club of North Tiverton, R.I., named for the major city of the
Azores. And Fall River was the home of Adelino (Billy) Gonsalves,
son of Madeiran immigrants, and considered the best player in US
soccer history.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people from the Azores have not been back for 20 or
30 years, some descendents have never been there,'' Pavao said.
``This club represents the passion of all Azoreans, and I hope when
we play against the big clubs, Benfica, Porto, Sporting, this gives
them a reason to return and reacquaint themselves with the
Azores.''

<P>
   KUMANOVO, Macedonia _ The Yugoslav military on Wednesday night
acceded to an agreement that will permit a military force commanded
by a NATO general with sweeping powers to occupy Kosovo, clearing
the way to an end to the Western alliance's first war.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, signed at a French helicopter base not far from
the border of Kosovo, was immediately approved by NATO leaders
meeting in Brussels. The agreement gave NATO Secretary-General
Javier Solana the authority to suspend bombing once the military
verified that the Serbian-dominated army, police and paramilitary
units had begun to withdraw.
</P>
<P>
   NATO and Pentagon officials have already reported detecting
preparations for a withdrawal after nearly 11 weeks of bombing, and
the air campaign could be suspended as soon as late Thursday or
Friday morning, an official here said, as long as the Serbs keep
their pledges and begin to pull out.
</P>
<P>
   The first British and French forces already poised here will
then move into Kosovo, replacing the retreating Serbian forces as
they abandon their positions and head north.
</P>
<P>
   Withdrawing over 11 days under the constant threat of a
resumption of bombing if they fail to pull out fully and on time,
the Serbs will be replaced by a 50,000-strong force. Under the
plan, the province will be ringed by a 5 kilometer buffer zone, and
divided into 5 sectors, each under the charge of a major power.
NATO is to provide for the safe return of hundreds of thousands of
Albanians who have either fled the country or been driven from
their homes and are hiding in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gen. Michael Jackson, the British officer who led the
negotiations here, will command the international peacekeepers,
with the power to use whatever military might he deems necessary to
enforce the peace, insure the Serbian withdrawal and keep Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic's troops from returning to Kosovo in
force.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is tragic that intransigence has made it necessary for the
international community to resort to air strikes in order to reach
a settlement,'' Jackson said after emerging from a camouflage tent
at the base here at 9:45 p.m. ``However, NATO's resolve in
conducting a sustained air campaign has finally achieved this
agreement, and now is the time to look ahead,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement on the military details of Yugoslavia's withdrawal
from its southern province, cherished as a symbol of Serbian
history and culture, came a week after Milosevic's government
agreed in broad terms to all of NATO's demands. Those included the
withdrawal of all Serbian forces, the intervention of a NATO-led
peacekeeping force and the return of the Kosovo Albanians who fled
their homes.
</P>
<P>
   In a compromise resolving one of the last, most nettlesome
disputes in the talks here, NATO agreed on the 11-day period to
complete the withdrawal of nearly 40,000 soldiers and police
officers from the province, even though Milosevic's government
agreed last week to do so in only a week. The Yugoslav delegation
here had asked for 17 days.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen on Wednesday night warned that
if Milosevic ordered his commanders to drag their heels or
otherwise violate the accord, the air campaign would resume in full
ferocity.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the event there's any reversal of their activities, in the
event there's any evidence that they intend to simply try to bog
this down in some other way, then we made it very clear, the
document makes it very clear, the pause will not longer be in
effect,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, President Clinton spoke cautiously, perhaps
mindful of the week-long delay in nailing down the terms of the
Serbian withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The agreement reached today by NATO and Serbian military
officials is another important step toward achieving our objectives
in Kosovo,'' he said. ``It lays out the details to meet the
essential conditions for peace: the rapid, orderly withdrawal of
all Serb forces from Kosovo and the deployment of an international
security force, with NATO at its core, which means a unified NATO
chain of command so the Kosovars can return home safely.''
</P>
<P>
   But how long that will take - along with myriad questions about
the future of the Kosovo Liberation Army and its armed struggle for
independence _ remained unclear in spite of Wednesday night's
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Although the return of refugees has become one of NATO's
fundamental objectives in the wake of the bombing campaign, NATO
hopes to hold off a rush of refugees pouring into Kosovo until its
forces have made it safer. In addition to land mines and booby
traps left behind, a major concern of NATO commanders is the
possibility that at least some Serbian soldiers and police officers
will simply shed their uniforms and remain in Kosovo with weapons,
ready to harass NATO troops or returning refugees, the official
here said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the six-page agreement signed here Wednesday night
explicitly authorizes a resumption of the bombing if the Serbs
violate the timetable for withdrawal, it is not clear how NATO
could respond to low-level menacing of its troops.
</P>
<P>
   Another major concern is the willingness of the Kosovar Albanian
rebels to abide by the agreement, which calls for them to disband
as an organized force and turn over their heavy weapons. Clinton
said the alliance had contacted members of the force, the Kosovo
Liberation Army, and received assurances that they would not attack
retreating Serbian forces or try to seize the territory they
abandon.

 KUMANOVO, Macedonia: they abandon.

<P>
   ``This will not be an easy operation and it will take time,''
Jackson said. ``I fully understand the wishes of the refugees to
return home quickly, and I promise that KFOR will do its utmost to
ensure this is done as soon and as safely as possible.'' The
acronym refers to the peace-keeping force.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night's agreement came after a final 24 hours of talks
that came perilously close to collapse once again. At one point,
they appeared to break down completely, when the Yugoslav
delegation, led by Col. Gen. Svetozar Marjanovic, abruptly left the
helicopter base here late Wednesday afternoon, saying they needed
to consult with authorities in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   But the delegation made it only as far as a border post north of
here, in Serbia itself. After telephone discussions with
authorities in Belgrade, the delegation returned to the base an
hour after they left, and the talks resumed.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 24 hours after this latest round began Tuesday night,
Jackson and Marjanovic signed the agreement in what one official
described as a subdued, unceremonious end to five days of wrangling
over the details of the Serb withdrawal. They did not shake hands.
</P>
<P>
   Eager to avoid the appearance of capitulating to NATO's demands,
the Yugoslav delegation had insisted that a withdrawal not begin
until the United Nations Security Council, with Russia and China
wielding veto power, had given the peacekeeping force its formal
approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``The talks today have been, on the military level, generally
constructive,'' said NATO's spokesman here, Lt. Col. Robin
Clifford, shortly after the delegation drove off in a convoy of
sedans and NATO vehicles Wednesday afternoon. ``But as you will
appreciate, some political issues have begun to impinge.''
</P>
<P>
   But when it became clear to the delegation Wednesday that the
Security Council would not force NATO to halt its bombing before a
withdrawal and would authorize the peacekeeping under the chapter
of the U.N. charter that permits the use of force, they relented,
according to a NATO official who attended the talks.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials, who have described these talks not as
negotiations, but rather the ironing out of the details of last
week's agreement, said the final document reflected refinements the
foreign ministers of the seven major industrial nations, along with
Russia, had agreed to Tuesday in Germany. It also put the NATO-led
peacekeepers under the auspices of the United Nations, giving them
what Jackson called ``a clear, legal basis'' for the peacekeeping
force. Not only the Serbs, but also some NATO allies had insisted
on that.
</P>
<P>
   Significantly for the Serbs, the document does not mention NATO
explicitly. Neither did Marjanovic when he appeared before a group
of television journalists to announce the signing Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means that the war has ended,'' Marjanovic said. ``It also
means that the policy of peace prevailed.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the NATO official who attended the talks said the mood
was far from celebratory, indicating that the alliance remained
wary of Milosevic and his intentions over the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not what he says,'' the official said. ``It's not what he
signs. It's what he does.''

HIGH SPIRITS: FORMER PRESIDENT BUSH BAILS OUT IN BIRTHDAY BASH 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By PATTY REINERT 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ Former President Bush, who turns 75 on
Saturday, celebrated early Wednesday by plunging out of an
airplane, free-falling for one minute, and then parachuting onto
the grounds of his presidential library.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just had one of the biggest thrills of my life,'' Bush said
afterward. ``Old guys can still do stuff, and you might as well go
for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Joining Bush for the daredevil event was Army Gen. Henry H.
Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, whose participation
was not choreographed in advance. A spokesman for Bush said the
president was ``thrilled'' that Shelton, 57, was able to join him
at the last minute as a show of support for his former
commander-in-chief.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who wore a white jumpsuit with his name stitched in blue
on his chest, leaped from a twin-engine &UR;  &LR; Shorts Skyvan at about
13,000 feet Wednesday morning, with two jumpmasters at his side. He
pulled his own white parachute, which bore the name of the
University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, and followed
several other sky divers to the ground. Before a crowd of about
1,500, the former president hit his target and appeared to make a
soft landing on his feet before falling backward.
</P>
<P>
   After the jump, Bush announced that a birthday celebration and
fund-raiser honoring him and his wife, Barbara, who turned 74 on
Tuesday, had raised $8.8 million for the Houston cancer center's
research. One of the Bushes' two daughters, Robin, died of leukemia
in 1953, and the couple serves on the cancer center's board.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's jump was Bush's third. His first was at age 20 when,
as a World War II pilot, he had to bail out of his burning torpedo
bomber in September 1944 after it was hit over the island of Chichi
Jima, 600 miles south of Japan. Bush was rescued by a Navy
submarine, but his two crew members were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Bush made his second sky dive in Yuma, Ariz.,
fulfilling a promise he had made to himself to make a nonemergency
jump just for the fun of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Barbara today would be my last time, but I enjoyed
myself so much that now I don't know,'' Bush said Wednesday. ``It
was darned exciting. It was heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   As Bush and the former first lady watched from the landing field
following Bush's jump, Shelton and skydivers from the Army, Navy,
Air Force and Marines jumped in salute to their former
commander-in-chief. Bush greeted each with a double high-five as
they gathered their parachutes.
</P>
<P>
   Shelton, a former paratrooper and decorated Vietnam combat
veteran, has jumped four or five times since becoming chairman two
years ago, according to a spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Also jumping Wednesday were members of the Alexandria, Va.-based
U.S. Parachute Association, which organized the event. Although
their tribute to Bush was blocked by the clouds, the sky divers
spelled out Bush's initials and the number 75 before deploying
their parachutes.
</P>
<P>
   Another member of the group, who parachuted during a test jump
earlier in the day, is older than Bush. Tom Morrison, a World War
II veteran who turned 75 three months ago and has logged 8,660
jumps, had requested the chance to meet the former president when
he heard he would jump again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just called them up and said, `I'm 75 too, and I'd like to
be on board,' and they said, `Come on,''' Morrison said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said that along with drawing attention to research on
cancer, he hopes his jump will deliver a message to older people:
``You're not out of it,'' he said. ``I feel like a spring colt. I
don't feel 75. I know everybody doesn't want to jump out of an
airplane, but work it out to try something and not just sit in
front of the TV like I used to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also introduced to the crowd his wartime buddy Jack Guy,
who had traveled to College Station from his home in Atlanta to
watch his friend jump. Guy, 76, said Bush did a great job and
looked ``fantastic.'' Would he consider jumping? ``Would you mind
if I said, `Hell?''' he asked, laughing. ``Hell no.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush deflected only one inevitable question Wednesday, involving
Texas Gov. George W. Bush's presidential aspirations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to get into politics on this beautiful,
nonpolitical day,'' he said. ``But of course, Barbara and I are
proud of both of our sons who are in politics, and we're proud of
the two who aren't. We're proud of all of our children.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeb Bush is the governor of Florida. The Bushes other three
children are daughter Dorothy and sons Neil and Marvin.
</P>
<P>
   The former president pulled his wife to the podium to answer
another inevitable question: Will she let him jump again?
</P>
<P>
   ``I've already told him he can do it when he's 80,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, asked if she felt proud, watching him parachute, she
shrugged: ``Not really. I expect the best from George Bush.''

ENERGY SECRETARY DELAYS DISCIPLINING STAFF OVER SPY CASE

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Energy Secretary Bill Richardson has put off for at
least a month disciplining or firing any Energy Department
employees as a result of the mishandling of the espionage
investigation at Los Alamos National Laboratory, department
officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson decided to delay any reprimands after he received an
internal review that he believed did not hold enough senior
officials at Energy Department headquarters accountable for the
blunders in the Los Alamos spy case, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Dissatisfied with the review, prepared by the Energy
Department's counter-intelligence office, Richardson has ordered a
new investigation by the Energy Department's inspector general.
Even an expedited investigation by the inspector general's office
will take 30 days, an Energy Department official said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Richardson told a Senate panel Wednesday that he
would urge President Clinton to veto legislation that would create
a new national security agency within the Energy Department to
handle its nuclear weapons program.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, proposed by three leading Republican senators,
is one of the first of many bills being crafted in Congress to
restructure the Energy Department in the wake of evidence of
Chinese atomic espionage at the national weapons labs, which are
owned by the department.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 10 congressional committees have been investigating
aspects of the spy case, including the Clinton administration's
handling of the matter, and lawmakers in the House and Senate are
already rushing out proposals aimed at reform.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the House Wednesday unanimously passed the first
package of measures incorporating many of the recommendations of a
select House panel that investigated Chinese nuclear spying and
illegal transfers of sensitive U.S. technologies to Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   But the administration plans to fight many of the broader
legislative proposals now under consideration on Capitol Hill,
which include breaking up the Energy Department, transferring the
nuclear weapons program to the Pentagon or creating new lines of
authority over the nuclear weapons programs within the Energy
Department.
</P>
<P>
   Testifying before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence,
Richardson complained that the proposed national security agency to
be created by the Senate bill would ``create a new fiefdom in a
department of fiefdoms,'' and would reduce his authority to hold
people accountable for counterintelligence and security matters at
the national labs.
</P>
<P>
   But the rapid pace of such legislative proposals being thrown at
Richardson and his department reflects the charged atmosphere that
has gripped Congress over the China spy scandal. ``We have a crisis
on our hands,'' said Sen. Frank H. Murkowski, R-Alaska, and one of
the measure's sponsors, who also testified before the intelligence
panel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time is now to fix this problem,'' added another sponsor,
Sen. Pete V. Dominici, R-N.M.. ``If we don't do it now, the
pressure will grow to move all of this out of the Energy
Department.''
</P>
<P>
   The intense congressional pressure on the Energy Department
began to show in Wednesday's hearing, when Ed Curran, the
department's counter-intelligence chief, was sharply criticized by
the committee's chairman, Sen. Richard C. Shelby, R-Ala., and the
vice chairman, Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., for attacking the panel's
role in the spy case in a recent appearance on NBC's ``Meet the
Press.''
</P>
<P>
   After Kerrey told Curran that his televised comments seemed like
they had been written by ``the political shop at the White House''
and were ``inappropriate and inaccurate,'' Curran assured him that
his remarks had not been scripted by the White House, and were the
result of his ``frustration at having to testify about this before
14 different committees for two months.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the White House on Wednesday rejected Republican
calls for the national security adviser, Sandy Berger, to testify
before Congress on the spy case.

JOYOUS CROWDS IN BELGRADE CELEBRATE END OF WAR
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ The street lights came on in downtown
Belgrade on Wednesday night for the first time in 10 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Crowds that had gathered spontaneously in the main square sent
up a raucous cheer, celebrating both an end to the war and to the
blackouts that have plagued residents. Joy and bravado combined to
lead many to proclaim victory.
</P>
<P>
   Several hundred young people danced and drank beer. One man
waved a Serbian flag. Another danced holding a red flare.
Firecrackers burst loudly among the feet of those in the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   By midnight cars swarmed around Republican Square, lights
flashing and horns blaring and music pumping from their sound
systems. Girls and soldiers in uniform hung out of the car windows
or rode on the tops of cars, holding their fingers out in victory
signs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came because the bombing stopped,'' said the driver of a
red open-topped jeep, gunning his engine. ``We came to celebrate
victory.''
</P>
<P>
   Word spread quickly that Yugoslav and NATO military chiefs had
signed an agreement, and people who saw it on television said they
immediately thought to go downtown and see what was happening.
</P>
<P>
   Police officers arrived about an hour after the celebrations
began and moved along some of the cars, but otherwise allowed the
crowd to spill over in the street blocking the way for traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Then the street lights came on, pale at first, and gradually
growing in strength. Next, the floodlights of the National Museum,
an imposing building on the side of the square, began to glow, amid
still more cheers.
</P>
<P>
   A group of soldiers, two conscripts in their early 20s, and a
28-year-old reservist who gave his name only as Zeljko said they
had heard the news of the military agreement and immediately called
some friends to go out on the town.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted the war to stop every night, and tonight was the
night,'' Zeljko said. ``We wanted to come out and have fun. We did
not want war, I think no one wanted it.''
</P>
<P>
   He stood in his uniform, his head closely shaved, talking
quietly, as people came by and slapped him on the back. His friends
passed round a bottle of whiskey, swigging huge gulps from the
bottle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came to celebrate victory,'' said one lanky conscript from
Western Serbia. ``We got through nearly 80 days of bombing. No one
else can survive that except us. That is a victory.''
</P>
<P>
   He told a story about his commander who he said had no friends
and did not talk to anyone. ``So he joined the army and now he
treats his men the same, he never talks to us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked who won the war, NATO or Yugoslavia, he paused to think.
``We never lost the war,'' he said. Asked if people saw them as
heroes, he said: ``In a way, when you resist the whole world.''
</P>
<P>
   Others in the crowd were celebrating the end of the bombing that
has so often kept them awake in the night over the past two months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came here tonight to celebrate our victory, to show how
great Serbia is,'' said one man driving a car full of friends. ``I
have two children and they had to sleep with a pillow over the
window because of the bombing. Can you imagine what it is like for
children and their parents?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He like others had not believed the political agreement signed
by President Slobodan Milosevic last week would really end the war.
``They went on bombing, didn't they?'' he said. But now that the
military chiefs had reached agreement, he was more certain.
</P>
<P>
   `'It was when we saw that NATO general come out and announce the
agreement that we believed it,'' said a 21-year-old woman named
Gordana, who was out celebrating with several soldier friends.
</P>
<P>
   She had seen Lt. Gen. Sir Michael Jackson, commander of NATO
troops in Macedonia, announce the agreement live on CNN, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Behind her several cars were lined up, their doors and trunks
open, thumping with loud music and creating a disco on the street.
People shouted to friends and danced a few steps. It was a striking
contrast to recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Belgrade, usually famous for its nightlife, has been deadly
quiet during the nights of bombing, as few people ventured out on
the pitch black streets and many have not dared cross the bridges
over the Sava River into the city center at night, for fear the
bridges would be bombed.
</P>
<P>
   The celebration was certainly spontaneous and the feelings of
happiness genuine. For many it was just an excuse to have some loud
fun. Some in the crowd had just come to see what the noise was. One
man came by on his bicycle. A few did not want to appear
unpatriotic and spouted nationalist slogans to foreign journalists
and began singing Serbian patriotic songs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to defend what is ours,'' said Djordje, a 22-year-old
cab driver. Kosovo will remain part of Serbia for ever.'' Yet he
said he was due to serve his military service later in the year and
admitted he was delighted that the war was over.
</P>
<P>
   One pair of men in black shirts, who said their were supporters
of the Radical Nationalist Party, said the people gathered were
stupid, since they did not understand that the agreement was bad
for Serbia and bad for their future.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrations were also reported elsewhere in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Gunfire and celebratory antiaircraft fire were being fired in
the town of Novi Sad, north of Belgrade, one resident reported by
telephone.
</P>
<P>
   In Pristina, the capital of Kosovo, Serbian troops also greeted
news of the agreement with loud vollies of gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   A huge crowd also gathered in southern Serbia firing guns in the
air and cheering on the main square in the town of Krusevac, where
thousands of people, reservists and their families, demonstrated
against the war last month.

LOS ANGELES REINVENTS ITSELF, ADOPTING NEW CITY CHARTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (ART ADV: A photo is being sent. Non-subscribers can make

(DW) 
 By TODD S. PURDUM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Voters have approved the most sweeping changes in
Los Angeles government in three-quarters of a century, discarding
the 1925 city charter in favor of a new document that increases the
power of the mayor, creates a system of neighborhood advisory
councils and gives local communities some control of planning and
zoning.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me the 21st century begins today,'' Mayor Richard Riordan,
who sparked the move to revise the charter, said Wednesday morning
in celebration of the measure's passage, with 60 percent of the
vote on Tuesday. ``The voters joined me in sweeping out the old and
sweeping in the new.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the new charter does not go as far in expanding mayoral
powers as he originally wished, the election results were a major
victory for Riordan. Besides winning the charter vote despite the
overwhelming opposition of City Council members and their allies
among the leadership of local unions, he saw his chosen candidate
win a runoff election to the school board, giving the four
candidates he backed for the board this year a majority among its
seven members.
</P>
<P>
   The new charter, which sprang from an effort to head off
secession drives in the city's far-flung neighborhoods, passed
easily in most neighborhoods, failing only in predominantly black
districts where alienation from city government and Riordan is high
and in the harbor district, a center of secession sentiment. Two
companion measures _ to increase the size of the 15-member City
Council, to either 21 or 25 members _ both failed by large margins.
Fewer than 20 percent of registered voters turned out.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, the charter establishes a system in which
neighborhood groups can petition to form advisory councils, which
could be either elected directly or appointed by elected officials
subject to broad guidelines. But it leaves the number and precise
format of such councils up to a newly created Department of
Neighborhood Empowerment and a vote by the City Council.
</P>
<P>
   The new charter, a compromise drafted by two independent
citizens' commissions over the last two years, also creates five
neighborhood planning boards with binding power over most zoning
decisions, subject to City Council review.
</P>
<P>
   By the standards of big Eastern or Midwestern cities, the
mayoralty here remains fairly weak. In months of public hearings
and debate, Angelenos made clear that they had no wish to embrace
the strong-mayoralty model of New York in particular.
</P>
<P>
   But after the new charter takes effect next year, Riordan and
his successors will be able to dismiss city department general
managers, subject to a two-thirds override vote by the council. At
present, under the old charter, the mayor must obtain Council
approval in advance to dismiss general managers.
</P>
<P>
   Riordan, a millionaire lawyer and investor who by law must leave
office when his second term expires in 2001, has had generally
fractious relations with the council during his six-year tenure,
and much of the debate over the new charter turned on personal
clashes between him and the 12 members who opposed the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Riordan and his allies raised about $1 million, much of it from
wealthy executives, including $200,000 from a corporation
controlled by Rupert Murdoch, and outspent their opponents by about
6 to 1.
</P>
<P>
   The opponents were led by Councilman Rudy Svorinich Jr., who
represents the harbor district. He came to Riordan's celebratory
news conference at City Hall this morning to make peace, bearing a
large jar of stuffed olives in lieu of a branch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you going to hit me with it?'' Riordan asked warily.
</P>
<P>
   Riordan said he believed that ``charter reform could go a long
way toward easing the move toward secession,'' in both the suburban
San Fernando Valley, on the city's northern flank, and the harbor
district, on its south side.
</P>
<P>
   But Jeff Brain, president of Valley Vote, a group that has led
the drive for a study of the Valley's secession from the rest of
the city _ but has stopped short of directly advocating that idea
and took no formal position in the vote on Tuesday _ said the
measure's passage confirmed the public's desire for a government
more responsive to neighborhood concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did the charter reform go far enough to satisfy the discontent
in the San Fernando Valley?'' Brain said. ``Not at all. Those in
our group that supported it made it very clear that they supported
it because it's better than what we have, but that it falls far
short of the promises of charter reform,'' like requiring that the
neighborhood councils be elected rather than appointed or creating
boroughs or other smaller jurisdictions within the city.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly Andrew Mardesich, the leader of the Harbor Study
Foundation, a group seeking a study of secession by the harbor
area, said that the new charter did not go far enough. Mardesich
said the neighborhood advisory councils would end up leading to
more calls for change, ``because they will take on the form of
local community government but the participants will be frustrated
because they will only be in an advisory capacity.''
</P>
<P>
   The charter leaves much of the fine print of implementation in
the hands of the 15 members of the City Council, and there was some
question today about how aggressively they would take up that
challenge. But Councilman Joel Wachs, who represents a conservative
district in the San Fernando Valley and was one of only three
members to support the charter proposal, said that ``the mandate of
the public is so clear'' that the council would have little choice
but to follow through.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say that you have only seen the beginning of the
wheels of reform,'' Wachs said at a news conference with charter
supporters outside City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Riordan's endorsed candidate for the school board,
Genethia Hayes, who defeated an incumbent member, Barbara
Boudreaux, other victors on Tuesday included Councilman Nate
Holden, a veteran black incumbent from a district that stretches
across a wide section of the city center, who staved off a
challenge from the Rev. Madison Shockley.

 &HT;    Stars vowing Hasek will see more pressure
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ For the second consecutive season, the Dallas Stars
this year earned a piece of hardware called the Presidents Trophy,
awarded annually to the NHL's regular season champion. But
heightened expectations do not guarantee postseason success.
</P>
<P>
   Bounced from the playoffs in the Western Conference finals last
year, the Stars have made it to the Stanley Cup finals this season
but find themselves down 1-0 in the best-of-seven series to the
East's seventh seed, the Buffalo Sabres. Dallas coach Ken Hitchcock
went as far to say, ``We're in a desperate situation,'' going into
Game 2 tonight at Reunion Arena, and it would be hard to dispute
that.
</P>
<P>
   While the Stars lost Game 1 of the conference finals to Colorado
before coming back to win in seven games, Dallas' 3-2 overtime loss
to the Sabres on Tuesday night was stuffed with bad omens. The
Stars controlled the play, in part because of 10 power plays. But
37 shots on Sabres goalie Dominik Hasek weren't enough and Dallas
lost a home game in which it seemed well in control. What happens
when Buffalo plays well?
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock's words aside, Dallas players aren't showing any
panic. Joe Nieuwendyk even said, ``The great thing about these
series is, over time, the best team prevails.''
</P>
<P>
   If that smacks of arrogance, the Stars are convinced that as
much as they did right Tuesday, they could've done more. Either
that or they just didn't want to show that Hasek's wizardry was
getting to them psychologically.
</P>
<P>
   Right winger Mike Keane: ``I'm not talking about Hasek. We just
have to find a way to beat him.''
</P>
<P>
   Center Mike Modano: ``Hasek's their best player. We have to find
a way to expose their best player _ that's how you win games. When
we played Colorado, we found a way to get to (Peter) Forsberg. When
we played St. Louis, we had to get to (Al) MacInnis. We have to put
traffic in front of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock: ``(Hasek) had an easy night. I don't care how many
shots we had. He didn't have to stop any second or third chances.
We have to make life a lot more difficult for him. I don't mean
take a run at him. I mean we have to get the puck in the right
areas and get him out of position.''
</P>
<P>
   As if to diminish thoughts that Tuesday's game was a colossal
upset, Hitchcock said, ``We've been on the right side of one-goal
games all year. But it's been a very fine line.''
</P>
<P>
   Hasek said he got a cramp in his hip, mostly from exhaustion,
after a save on Pat Verbeek in overtime just before the winning
goal by Jason Woolley. Warm conditions and continual Stars power
plays wore on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never played before in such a hot building,'' Hasek said.
``I was very tired. In the overtime, before the winning goal, I
stopped Verbeek and I got a cramp. When the game was over, I tried
to take a couple of steps (toward his celebrating teammates at the
other end of the ice). But then I fell, and I thought, `That's
enough,' and I left the ice. I don't remember ever being so tired.

<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia _ Ira Konorskaya, a Ukrainian schoolgirl,
was making a tour of the Hermitage musuem with her grandmother
recently when she spotted a bank of computers at the museum's new
educational center. Curious, she took a seat and within minutes was
intently dragging images from a painting by the 16th- century
Venetian master Titian across the screen.
</P>
<P>
   Her grandmother couldn't drag her away; it was the first time
Ira, 12 years old, had ever had hands-on access either to a
computer or to the Italian Renaissance.
</P>
<P>
   For a museum that has miraculously survived the 20th century
(two revolutions, two wars and Russia's messy eight-year-long lurch
toward democracy), the Hermitage, keeper of one of the world's
greatest art collections, is doing its best to get a jump on the
coming millennium.
</P>
<P>
   This week, it will introduce what experts describe as one of the
best digital libraries on a museum Internet site, put together by
IBM technicians working with the latest scanning technology, some
of it designed especially for IBM's $2 million Hermitage project.
</P>
<P>
   For openers, more than 2,000 masterpieces and treasures from the
Hermitage collection of 2.5 million works of art will be available
on the Internet site (www.hermitagemuseum.org) this week, all of
them of the highest available quality.
</P>
<P>
   The educational center _ up and running since last August _ has
already proved a big hit with visitors, schoolchildren in
particular, with some 150 visitors a day logging onto the center's
six computers. And a novel information system, centered on four
electronic kiosks, is also being inaugurated this month, offering
visitors a multimedia guide through the maze of state rooms and
corridors that is the Hermitage.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, a visitor who wants to go from the Rembrandt room
to the Impressionists is given a printout with a map and a
description of all the artworks to be seen en route.
</P>
<P>
   Housed along the banks of the Neva River in a palace built by
the Czars for themselves and their art collection, the Hermitage
has proved suprisingly adept at adapting to modernity. Besides the
two-year-old IBM project, which has given the Hermitage an edge in
the rush to virtual viewing, the museum has already proved itself a
leader among Russian cultural institutions in anticipating a new
role for itself, and its visitors.
</P>
<P>
   To begin with, the museum has installed a well-staffed
information booth, a significant step out of the Soviet past when
visitors had to pry information out of surly gatekeepers. Soon the
museum plans to shift its main entrance altogether, back onto
Palace Square, once the main entryway into the Czar's Winter
Palace.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a traditional museum, located in a palace with many
windows,'' said Mikhail Piotrovsky, 54, the museum's urbane and
dynamic director, who took over in 1992 and occupies the office
that was previously held by his father, Boris Piotrovsky, for
almost a quarter century. ``But we have to be inventive.''
</P>
<P>
   Necessity has already backed the Hermitage into a corner. Since
the collapse of communism and with it the Soviet system of mass
tourism, the number of visitors to the museum has dropped
significantly, from almost 4 million a year at its peak to 1.7
million last year.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are money problems that continue to nag the
Hermitage, just as they do all other state-supported institutions
in an economically hard-pressed Russia. ``Russia is a country of
extremes,'' said Piotroskvy. ``When we have no money, we really
have no money.''
</P>
<P>
   In Soviet times, the government plugged all gaps in the
Hermitage budget. Now the museum itself has to come up with about a
third of its annual $12 million budget, through tickets, licensing,
compensation for exhibitions taken abroad and, increasingly,
donations.
</P>
<P>
   The government's share, when it comes, comes slowly and
irregularly: so far this year, the museum has received only 60
percent of what is owed by Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two ways of dealing with difficult times,''
Piotrovsky said. ``One is complaining, which is very important. The
other is to have a plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Among Piotrovsky's ambitions is a $150 million expansion plan
that would extend the museum across the vast Palace Square to the
handsome General Staff Building, next to the Victory Arch.
</P>
<P>
   With its five stories and courtyard, the 19th-century building
would provide an additional 430,000 square feet, of which 60
percent would be reserved for exhibitions and 40 percent for a
commercially run entertainment complex that would house bars,
restaurants and even a movie theater.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For this and other more mundane projects, the Hermitage has
joined a well trod international circuit looking for private
donations. The Hermitage being the Hermitage _ a museum on a par
with the Louvre in Paris and the Metropolitan in New York _ it has
been relatively successful. Besides the IBM grant, the Hermitage
has received donations from Honeywell, Coca-Cola and supporters in
Japan and the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   It was Dutch money that paid for the recent renovations in the
room housing the Hermitage's stunning Rembrandt collections,
improving the lighting and fixing the ceilings. ``We sometimes joke
that we should move the Rembrandts from room to room,'' Piotrosvky
said with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is good and bad about the donation system is that people
only want to give to specific projects,'' he added. ``Nobody wants
to give money for the sewage system.'' But even there, he said, the
Hermitage has benefited from a Scandanivian consortium that is
using the museum as a pilot project to help St. Petersburg better
control its effluents into the Bay of Finland.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last years, the Hermitage has also carried on its
regular maintenance, paying closer attention to security and
atmosphere control. Here, oddly enough, the biggest concern is not
the humidity that hangs over St. Petersburg's watery landscape but
the dryness that comes from a central heating system installed in
this century.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, fundraising has begun for the grand expansion
plan. The effort has been aided by a handsome, spiral-bound
brochure explaining the proposed restoration clearly and in detail,
a rarity for Russian cultural projects.
</P>
<P>
   Piotrovsky understands that the best approach is to proceed one
step at a time. By the end of the year, he hopes to complete the
restoration of 10 exhibition rooms in the new building in time to
house a show on the Empire style in France and Russia, titled ``In
the Shadow of the Eagle.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Donations or no donations, we will do it,'' he said. In
Russia's close-knit cultural elite, many say that if anyone can do
it, Piotrovsky can. ``He is a great communicator and
intellectual,'' said Mihail Kamensky, deputy director of the
Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hermitage deserves the best,'' Kamensky said. ``Were it in
New York or Washington, all the big millionaires would come
together and invest all that is needed. What is problematic in
Russia is that no matter how great the museum, and how valuable its
cultural heritage, the state is not able to invest an adequate
amount of money.''
</P>
<P>
   And, he added, private benefactors cannot be enticed with tax
deductions, as they are in the United States. ``We are only
starting to come closer to the real techniques of fundraising,''
Kamensky said.
</P>
<P>
   Piotrovksy's enthusiasm for the Hermitage's new Internet site
fits neatly into his view for a more open, more accessible museum.
Today, only five percent of the museum's collection is on display:
he would like to expand that to 20 percent. Eventually, through the
Internet, he hopes to make the whole collection available.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is democracy when everything is available,'' he said. A
recent convert to computer technology, Piotrovsky has kept a close
eye on the project; he was the one who spurred IBM's top image
makers to come up with a newly patented watermark, so deeply
embedded in the computerized image as to be invisible, that would
prevent its being printed out and used for commerical purposes.
</P>
<P>
   So far, there has been little audible grumbling from Russia's
cultural purists. ``Art scholars in Russia are either computer
imbeciles _ which means they don't know anything about this _ or
they are computer-advanced, in which case they are positive,'' said
Kamensky.

DOW RETREATS; NASDAQ POSTS SOLID GAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A late surge of interest in computer-related stocks
lifted the Nasdaq composite index to a solid gain Wednesday while
the Dow Jones industrial average continued to slide.
</P>
<P>
   The mixed performance came as long-term interest rates climbed
further and Wall Street braced for two major economic reports, on
retail sales and producer prices, scheduled to be released Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Strategists said that the market had decided that the Federal
Reserve was more likely than not to raise the overnight lending
rate between banks when its policy committee meets at the end of
the month. The case was largely sealed by hawkish comments on
Tuesday by two central-bank policy makers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The noises coming out of the Fed are that they're going to
raise rates,'' said Charles J. Pradilla, chief investment
strategist at S.G. Cowen Securities.
</P>
<P>
   But he said that for the markets the crucial issue was whether
the Fed acts in the wake of benign readings on sales and inflation
or whether these suggest such a strong economy that multiple
increases could be in the offing.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot is in the balance,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Long-term interest rates continued to climb Wednesday. The price
of the benchmark 30-year bond fell 13/32, to 89 12/32. Its yield,
which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 6.02 percent, from
5.99 percent on Tuesday, the first close above 6 percent in more
than a year. The yield on the Treasury's two-year note climbed to
5.61 percent from 5.55 percent, and the yield on the 10-year bond,
against which home mortgages are typically priced, moved to 5.87
percent from 5.82 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Investors in computer chips, semiconductors and other
high-technology stocks that dominate Nasdaq pushed the index up
44.79 points, or 1.8 percent, to 2,519.35. Analysts attributed much
of this to Intel's announcement that it would begin using larger
silicon wafers in production by 2002 and to a report of improved
prospects for industry sales.
</P>
<P>
   But the Dow, laced with shares of companies more closely tied to
the business cycle, slumped 75.35 points, or seven-tenths of a
percent, to 10,690.29. A two-and-a-half-percentage-point divergence
between the Nasdaq and the Dow is unusual, even in the volatile
markets that have prevailed for much of the last year.
</P>
<P>
   According to Limresearch.com, an analytical firm, the divergence
between the Dow and Nasdaq has reached two percentage points only
five times: Dec. 31, 1998; three times in 1982, and once in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clearly a two-tier market,'' said David G. Dietze,
president of Point View Financial Services in Summit, N.J., adding
that any discernible trend would be suspect because of relatively
light volume. On the New York Stock Exchange, only 662 million
shares changed hands.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index, which includes
many Nasdaq and Dow issues, finished virtually unchanged. It inched
up 1.31 points, or one-tenth of a percent, to 1,318.64.
</P>
<P>
   Airline stocks were among the weakest group after US Airways
warned of lower second-quarter profits, following a similar warning
by UAL on Friday, and analysts lowered estimates for Continental.
The biggest declines were 3[ each for Continental and Delta Air
Lines, to 37 9/16 and 56 13/16, respectively, while UAL lost 1
15/16, to 61~.
</P>
<P>
   Military issues also stumbled, dragged down by a profit warning
from Lockheed Martin, which skidded 5 9/16, to 34~. United
Technologies fell 2 5/16, to 64 15/16.
</P>
<P>
   Procter &AMP; Gamble, which said its reorganization would cost
15,000 jobs, fell 2 9/16, to 92\. Philip Morris rose 1 13/16, to
40~, benefiting from a higher rating by a Morgan Stanley analyst
who cited an improved legal climate.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer was a casualty in a mixed drug group, sliding 6 1/16, to
104 15/16, after the Food and Drug Administration said use of the
company's Trovan antibiotic should be limited.
</P>
<P>
   In the resurgent technology sector, Texas Instruments jumped 6],
to 123]; Broadcom rose 6{, to 108}; Micron Technology increased 3
15/16, to 43[; Intel was up 1 7/16, to 53[; Hewlett-Packard climbed
2[, to 92 11/16; Microsoft rose 2 15/16, to 82 5/16, and Amazon.com
was up 2 7/16, to 114.
</P>
<P>
   ``People still want to own stocks,'' said Timothy M. Ghriskey,
senior portfolio manager at the Dreyfus Corp. ``But it's a very
dangerous market for momentum players _ people who go after the
latest trends _ who tend to get whipsawed'' by daily swings.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outpaced advancing ones by 1,555 to 1,392 on
the Big Board, with 52 stocks making new highs and 65 new lows.

 &HT;    Convention of Texas educators focuses on school safety
 &HT;    By Peyton D. Woodson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ School educators, used to dealing with endless
demands of better grades and higher test scores, say more and more
they're spending their time worrying about safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the Colorado shooting, safety is issue number one in the
minds of the administrators I've talked to,'' said Mike Wallace,
principal of Bastrop Middle School.
</P>
<P>
   That's why it's also among the top topics at this week's
three-day summer workshop of the Texas Association of Secondary
School Principals at the Austin Convention Center, which runs
through Friday. There 1,500 principals and educators are talking
about a variety of issues, from creating better learning
environments to connecting schools with families and communities.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 99 seminars being offered, more than a dozen address
safety issues, including sessions on drug and bomb-sniffing dogs,
lockerless schools, and managing a crisis at a school. Although
many principals say they already had safety plans in place before
the April shooting at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo.,
they say they are reassessing those plans.
</P>
<P>
   Retired FBI agent Max Howard, one of the speakers at the
workshop, said he can attest to schools' increased interest in
safety. Howard owns a crisis management training firm that develops
crisis plans for both businesses and schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``My involvement has been more since Columbine,'' he said. ``We
recognize that there is a level of violence among young people, as
with all people. The process I'm going to use is taking the skills
that law enforcement use when handling a particular situation, and
applying those skills to what a school administrators can use with
irate students.''
</P>
<P>
   Although some Austin schools had crisis management plans in
place before the Columbine shooting in Littleton, Colo.,
administrators like Lanier High School Assistant Principal Wayne
Skrhak said the incident prompted them to take a second look.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're probably a little more cautious,'' Skrhak said. ``We're
more watchful, we listen more carefully. We tell teachers to let us
know when they have that gut level feeling. When we have events
like Columbine, you're more cautious, it puts us on alert.''
</P>
<P>
   Skrhak, who spoke at a seminar on gangs, said Lanier encourages
students to report possible safety violations. Students are
sometimes given monetary awards, and can remain anonymous.
</P>
<P>
   ``People watching and people reporting makes a big difference,''
he said. ``When you have a large majority trained on what to look
for, you can head off situations before they head to something
else.''
</P>
<P>
   Austin High School Assistant Principal Bill Glover said safety
concerns are also foremost in the minds of parents and students.
Two days this spring, he said, a lot of their students refused to
come to class after hearing rumors of possible copycat incidents of
the Columbine shootings.
</P>
<P>
   ``After Columbine, there were heightened concerns,'' he said.
``Through communications and being very honest with the students,
it got away a lot of the fear.''
</P>
<P>
   Glover said security now makes more frequent sweeps of their
buildings, and they take a closer look at suspicious looking
objects. Glover said this year, one set of brass knuckle and a few
knives were collected from students.
</P>
<P>
   Despite rising safety concerns, the Center for Public Policy
Priorities reports that juvenile violent crime in Texas is actually
declining. A recent study states that since 1994, the arrest rates
for all juvenile violent crimes has declined.
</P>
<P>
   Administrators told their peers that monitoring what students
bring into the school building is a big part of the battle.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace, of Bastrop Middle School, moderated a session on using
dogs to detect contraband. Wallace said he regularly uses trained
school dogs to survey his campus of 950 students.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike drug dogs, school dogs are trained to detect a variety of
substances such as illicit drugs, alcohol and gunpowder- based
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Granger Independent School District Superintendent James
Bartosh, who in another session presented the idea of a lockerless
school, said he still marvels at education's growing focus on
increased security. ``We would wear our holsters and toy guns to
school and nobody thought a thing about it,'' he said. ``I had a
fourth grader bring a cap gun to school and we had to get the gun
to the county (law enforcement) because they had been notified that
we had a gun at our school. It's almost ridiculous, but what do you
do, you can't respond any other way? We all just have to be
careful.''

PROCTOR &AMP; GAMBLE TO CUT 15,000 JOBS AND SHUT DOWN 10 PLANTS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By DANA CANEDY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an effort to loosen its stiff corporate culture and free more
cash for product development, Procter &AMP; Gamble said Wednesday that
it would cut 15,000 jobs worldwide _ or 13 percent of its work
force _ close 10 plants and take nearly $2 billion in charges
linked to the reorganization.
</P>
<P>
   P&AMP;G, which makes such products as Tide detergent, Pampers
diapers and Crest toothpaste, also said in a meeting with analysts
and investors in New York Wednesday that its financial results for
the current quarter would be flat and would improve only modestly
the next quarter.
</P>
<P>
   And the company acknowledged that it had been too ambitious in
its 10-year goal to double revenue to $70 billion by 2005, all but
admitting it would fall significantly short.
</P>
<P>
   Durk I. Jager, the chief executive, nonetheless tried to assure
analysts and investors that the reorganization would spur future
growth and save about $900 million a year by 2004. The overview of
what P&AMP;G calls ``Organization 2005'' provided the first detailed
look at Jager's blueprint for growth since he was selected to lead
P&AMP;G in January after 29 years with the company.
</P>
<P>
   Investors typically cheer when a company announces plans to cut
costs and promises huge savings. But P&AMP;G shareholders have heard
all of this before and been disappointed when management did not
deliver the lofty revenue gains and fatter profits it had promised.
</P>
<P>
   This time, investors punished the company's stock, indicating
their skepticism that the reorganization would bring about the 13
to 15 percent annual earnings growth that management now promises
and signaling their disappointment with the less-than-impressive
quarterly forecast. P&AMP;G shares declined $2.5625 Wednesday, or 2.7
percent, to $92.25.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what we are seeing now in the reaction in the stock is
people want to see results right now,'' said Mark Godfrey, a senior
analyst with the Invesco Funds Group, which holds 1.6 million
shares of P&AMP;G.
</P>
<P>
   The mixed bag of news management presented Wednesday, with the
warnings of a mediocre short-term performance but the carrot of a
payoff later, failed to impress investors, analysts said. ``Nobody
was wowed by what they heard,'' said William Steele, a managing
director of Banc of America Securities. ``Quite honestly, the jury
is still out on the company's ability to sustain long term a 13
percent growth rate.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, P&AMP;G's reorganization should make for a more
efficient company. But six years ago, the company cut thousands of
jobs, closed dozens of plants and took $1.5 billion in charges in
what management called a strategy to refocus the business.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, though, P&AMP;G has been hurt by the collapse of
some foreign economies, as well as the company's lethargic
product-development cycle and sometimes slow response to consumer
trends.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the current reorganization, P&AMP;G will eliminate 15,000
jobs over the next six years, with 10,000 coming by the end of
2001. Only about 16 percent of the job cuts will be in North
America, with most in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.
</P>
<P>
   P&AMP;G did not disclose which plants it intends to close, but as
with the job cuts, most or all are expected to be outside the
United States. Of the $1.9 billion in after-tax charges related to
the reorganization, about $400 million will be taken in the current
quarter and about $1 billion over the next two fiscal years. The
remainder will be taken by 2004.

<P>
   ``The cost of Organization 2005 is well justified by both the
ongoing operational benefits of our new structure and the
substantial financial benefits it will generate for our
shareholders,'' Jager said. The plan, he added, ``marks the most
dramatic change to P&AMP;G's structure, work processes and culture in
the company's history.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan calls for developing seven global business units
focused on product segments such as hair care, laundry and feminine
hygiene. It also shifts the company's focus from geographic
expansion to faster, more innovative product development. And it
ties executives' compensation more closely to innovation.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, if Jager succeeds in relaxing P&AMP;G's cumbersome corporate
structure, it would represent a new era in the company's culture
and perhaps again make P&AMP;G the undisputed leader in consumer
products. It has already begun to show new spark, notably by
introducing products that move it into new areas like Dryel, a
dry-cleaning kit for home use and Febreze, which is used to remove
odors from fabric.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the company has made some embarrassing missteps recently,
as in its failure to swiftly respond to consumers' taste for new
toothpaste flavors and formulas. P&AMP;G saw its share of the market
tumble as Colgate-Palmolive and others lured once-loyal Crest
users.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that while throwing more of resources behind
research and development, and bringing products to market quicker,
were certainly welcome changes, P&AMP;G must begin soon to deliver
better financial results. ``Procter's Organization 2005 is more of
an evolution than a revolution,'' said Wendy Nicholson of Salomon
Smith Barney. ``This is a six-year program, and investors need to
be wary of exactly how long Procter might take to get this business
where they want it to be.''

KOSOVAR REFUGEES WORRY ABOUT SERB CONTROL OF RE-ENTRY PROCESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (With KOSOVO-RDP, KOSOVO-BELGRADE) 
(bl) 
 By ELISABETH BUMILLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUKES, Albania _ There may be a relative peace in the Balkans,
but the 120,000 Kosovar Albanian refugees who have staggered across
the border into this hot, dusty and rubble-strewn mountain town are
still anxious about how they will ever safely go home again.
</P>
<P>
   Many refugees were stripped by Serbian officials of all identity
cards, drivers' licenses and passports as they fled Kosovo. And if
Serbs control the re-entry process, as Yugoslav officials are
insisting is essential, then the Kosovar refugees say the Serbs
will simply keep them out by telling the refugees that they have no
proof that they belong in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The refugees say this was part of a long-range Serbian plan.
``They're going to say we have no identity cards, and we're not
Albanians from Kosovo, we're from Albania,'' said Murtez Zeqiri,
30, an unemployed graduate of the University of Pristina, who spoke
Wednesday in his tent at one of the seven refugee camps here.
</P>
<P>
   Zeqiri added that he had heard on the radio that Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright was opposed to a Serbian control of
re-entry, but was nonetheless worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Serbian intellectuals were working a long time on this
project, to have ethnic cleansing in Kosovo,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Zeqiri came across the border on May 26, and told a story
similar to those heard many times in the camps. On May 15, Zeqiri
said, Serbian police took over the streets of his neighborhood in
Mitrovica, a town in northern Kosovo, then came to his door and
ordered him with his parents, sister and sister-in-law to the yard
of the local elementary school.
</P>
<P>
   The police separated the men from the women and children, then
transported the men to Smrekovnica, a prison north of Pristina,
Kosovo's capital. There they were beaten, fed only bread and tea
and ordered to sign papers ``confessing'' to being members of the
Kosovo Liberation Army, the separatist rebel force.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said, `If you don't sign, you can be killed,''' Zeqiri
said. He added that although he sympathized with the KLA, ``I
wasn't an armed member. I never used a gun.''
</P>
<P>
   After 11 days, Zeqiri said the Serbian police drove him and a
busload of other prisoners to a village near the border. ``We heard
the police talking, how they were going to kill us,'' Zeqiri said.
Instead, the men were released and told to walk to the border. ``I
cannot express my feelings at the moment when the police separated
us. You should be there to see how we cried, all the men
together,'' Zeqiri said. ``To separate young boys from their
parents, it was terrible to see and feel.''
</P>
<P>
   Other men in Zeqiri's camp agreed that the Serbs would give them
trouble in re-entering Kosovo. ``They don't want to let us
inside,'' said Nezir Rexhepi, 33, from the southern Kosovo city of
Prizren, who owns a supermarket and a barber shop. ``For 50 years,
they're thinking about this project.''
</P>
<P>
   Cynicism was rampant among the refugees. ``If they control the
re-entry, of course we can't go back,'' said Nashide Kulkeci, a
29-year-old woman from the village of Vraniq, near Prizren. ``It's
better for us to stay here.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the refugees have not been issued any identity cards in
Albania, although plans are under way for registration system to be
run by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the
Albanian government.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard have donated computer hardware and
software, but a UNHCR spokesman here, Rupert Colville, said there
were logistical delays. ``The problem is, however super-duper the
equipment, you've still got to go out and find the refugees,''
Colville said.
</P>
<P>
   There are 450,000 ethnic Albanian refugees in Albania, two
thirds of them in private homes and apartments.

BANKING REFORMS SPUR PRIVACY CONCERNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With Congress on the verge of allowing banks,
brokerages, and insurance companies to merge, consumer advocates
are warning that financial firms will soon have too much access to
the private health and credit records of their customers.
</P>
<P>
   A bank might use health information from its insurance
subsidiary to deny people loans, they say. An insurance company
might deny an auto policy to someone based on a report from its
banking unit that the customer bounced some checks, they say.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, banks sometimes share customer information with one
another or with other companies, consumer advocates say. But the
flow of information will become far heavier, they argue, when
Congress removes the Depression-era barriers that have kept banks,
insurers, and stock brokerages from buying one another.
</P>
<P>
   A bill allowing the three industries to enter one another's
business has passed the Senate, and a key House panel is set to
vote on a similar bill Thursday. If it becomes law, the bill is
expected to create a new breed of financial ``supermarket'' selling
insurance, banking, and investment services.
</P>
<P>
   During Thursday's House Commerce Committee vote, Representative
Edward Markey of Massachusetts and two other lawmakers will offer
an amendment that gives consumers new rights to block companies
from sharing personal information about them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been really pushing this thing, though it doesn't even
go as far as we'd like,'' said Mary Griffin of Consumers Union,
which is lobbying for Markey's amendment in cooperation with
Consumer Federation of America, the US Public Interest Research
Group, and other consumer-advocacy groups.
</P>
<P>
   Banking, insurance, and other industry groups say consumers are
adequately protected by existing laws. For example, current rules
already limit companies in sharing medical data, they say.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, they warn, the Markey amendment would partly undermine
the rationale for banks and insurers to merge in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Insurers want their banking partners to name the people who
recently obtained mortgages, so they could offer homeowners'
insurance to those people, said Dan Zielinski, spokesman for the
American Insurance Association, which represents property and
casualty insurers. Blocking the flow of information would deprive
financial firms of new marketing opportunities, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Under Markey's proposal, consumers would have the right to block
a conglomerate from sharing personal information among its banking,
insurance, and brokerage units. But these firms would not have to
seek prior consent before sharing the information.
</P>
<P>
   Firms that wanted to provide information to other, unaffiliated
companies would have to seek advance approval from customers.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers Union and other consumer groups say customers should
be asked in advance in all cases before information is shared.
</P>
<P>
   John Byrne, senior counsel at the American Bankers Association,
argued that Congress should not pass the Markey amendment because
it has not considered its unintended consequences. For example, he
said, some information sharing is currently allowed to help banks
guard against fraud.

POSTERS AND TOYS: BACK TO A FUTURIST  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 13) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By RITA REIF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI BEACH, Fla. _ The Italian painter and designer Fortunato
Depero came late to Futurism. Indeed, this energetic art style of
vivid palette and dynamic images was four years old when, in 1913,
Depero went to Rome to meet the founder of the movement, the poet
Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, and to see the Futurist art of Umberto
Boccioni and Giacomo Balla. The trip changed Depero's life.
</P>
<P>
   He had begun as a Symbolist but was so moved by how the artists'
images of speed, machines and violence captured the excitement of
the industrial age that he switched to Futurism.
</P>
<P>
   He adopted the themes Marinetti had outlined in a 1909 manifesto
calling for the creation of a new art to transform the world and
for the destruction of museums and libraries. By joining the
movement, Depero expanded the Futurist presence in design and the
decorative arts.
</P>
<P>
   His swift ascent to the inner sanctum of the Futurists, and the
stunning variety of works he produced, are explored in ``Depero
Futurista Rome-Paris-New York, 1915-1932,'' an exhibition here at
the Wolfsonian museum of design, through July 26.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 160 items on view were produced before 1932, but
some date to the late 1940s. Aside from a chair and several books
from the Wolfsonian collection, the objects on view were lent by
the Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art of Trento and Rovereto,
towns 20 to 30 miles north of Verona in northern Italy near Fondo,
the village where Depero was born.
</P>
<P>
   But from earliest childhood until his death at 68 in 1960,
Depero lived mostly in Roverto, where he worked at the House of
Art, the studio, showcase and shop for his art and furnishings.
</P>
<P>
   While Depero's paintings and drawings were richly colored and
aswirl with abstract forms, they were also more imitative than
innovative. But painting with the Futurists led him to other art
forms at which he excelled.
</P>
<P>
   The flat imagery he mastered while working with Balla, his
mentor, adapted well to graphic art, a new idiom spawned by
Futurism. And the rocketlike pencils and robotic figures in his
paintings were images he later translated into posters and puppets.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition makes clear why even as early as 1915 Boccioni
was so amazed at Depero's huge output and the diversity of what he
made that he called him ``the tireless worker.'' In 1917, Depero
took on theater projects, doing sets and costume designs for Sergei
Diaghilev and marionettes for the Gorno dell Acqua Company of Rome.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in the late 1920s, when he came to New York, he did
magazine covers for Vanity Fair and Vogue and advertising for Venus
Pencils. Facile though he was at these skills and at designing
typography, billboards, furniture, toys and tapestries, he could no
longer pay the bills after the Depression began, in 1929. So he
returned to Italy in 1930. Several later drawings with Fascist
imagery are also included in the show.
</P>
<P>
   Depero's contributions even included manifestos and books, works
that were sometimes as poetic as they were political, and far less
militant than the revolutionary tracts of Marinetti.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1915 manifesto by Depero and Balla, ``The Futurist
Reconstruction of the Universe,'' they saw the world becoming more
oppressive and advocated a new, freer expression in the arts to
make it more joyful. ``We will give skeleton and flesh to the
invisible, the impalpable, the imponderable and the
imperceptible,'' they wrote.
</P>
<P>
   They also wrote that toys were meant to accustom a child ``to
completely spontaneous laughter.'' The type of toys that will
inspire such a response, they wrote, would have to eliminate the
sort of ``grotesque imitation'' common in toy trains. They called
for more fantasy and mobility in toys.
</P>
<P>
   Depero practiced what he preached in the toys and marionettes he
produced; they always seem to be moving: bears and rhinoceroses
appear to lumber along, ballerinas to twirl and workmen to be
hammering.
</P>
<P>
   Depero accentuated the simulated movements by painting the parts
of toys in contrasting colors, exaggerating the limbs or other body
parts and using three or more figures all in a row. The figures on
view are reproductions, from the 1980s, of originals produced from
1918 to 1930.
</P>
<P>
   To Marianne Lamonaca, the curator at the Wolfsonian who
coordinated the exhibition, what proved most challenging in the
exhibition were the inconsistencies in his work. ``Depero speaks
about the toys as transformative objects that must move,'' she
said. ``But they never do.''
</P>
<P>
   Even more problematic was Depero's view of his art. It was
supposed to envision the future when, in fact, much of it was
rooted in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Futurism did not change the world, but it did produce brilliant
and vigorous artworks, at least in the first stage, which ended in
1915. It also proved a bust at bringing about the destruction of
museums and libraries.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, Depero's last Futurist creation, and his most
ambitious, was a museum, financed by Rovereto, which he designed in
1957. When it opened two years later, the Fortunato Depero Museum
was hailed as the first Futurist Museum in Italy.

INTEL TO UPGRADE ITS MANUFACTURING PLANTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Intel Corp., the largest maker of computer
chips, said Wednesday that it would upgrade its manufacturing
plants to produce far more powerful processors while significantly
cutting manufacturing costs.
</P>
<P>
   Intel's new generation of plants will use silicon wafers, the
raw material of computer chips that are 12 inches in diameters
compared with 8 inches today. That 50 percent increase in diameter
amounts to a 225 percent increase in the surface area of each
wafer, the company said. That translates into a significant savings
in the cost of each chip.
</P>
<P>
   Intel, which is based in Santa Clara, is not the first major
semiconductor company to commit to using 12-inch wafers. However,
because Intel sets the pace for the industry, its decision is
certain to force other chip makers to move to next-generation chip
fabrication.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what was needed to set the industry moving,'' said
Risto Puhakki, vice president of operations, at VLSI Research, a
San Jose market research firm. ``You get many more chips per wafer,
and the revenue stream is based on the number of chips that can be
made.''
</P>
<P>
   Intel officials said the company would begin building its first
new factory based on the new equipment next year and that it
expected to produce commercial chips based on 12-inch wafers in
2001.
</P>
<P>
   Silicon chips are made in batches of several hundred per wafer
by machines call steppers, which etch circuits into the silicon.
After the wafers have been etched, they are sliced into individual
chips, known as ``dies.''
</P>
<P>
   Intel officials said that more than doubling the surface area
available on each wafer would cut manufacturing costs by 30
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to make our capital costs shrink back to where
they were six or seven years ago,'' said Michael Splinter, senior
vice president and general manager of Intel's Technology and
Manufacturing Group. ``You get a bigger pizza and you get a lot
more slices.''
</P>
<P>
   Cost savings have become increasingly important in this highly
competitive industry, which must continually fight spiraling costs
inherent in the pace of technological change predicted by Moore's
Law. In the late 1960s, Gordon Moore, Intel's cofounder, observed
that the number of transistors that could be put on a single
silicon die was doubling roughly every 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the industry has managed to stay on that performance
curve only by building ever more costly factories.
</P>
<P>
   Intel plans to deploy the new technology first in a research and
development factory in Hillsboro, Ore., that will include a
so-called clean room _ a sterile environment free of dust and other
airborne contaminants _ of approximately 120,000 square feet. The
company said the plant would cost about $1.2 billion over the next
several years.
</P>
<P>
   The new plants will help the company move from today's 0.18
micron chips to 0.13 micron chips. A micron, one-millionth of a
meter, is the unit of measurement for the width of the tiniest wire
that can be etched into the wafer. A human hair is 75 to 100
microns wide.
</P>
<P>
   This 33 percent higher chip density will enable Intel to build
significantly faster microprocessors with as many as 50 million
transistors, compared with today's 10 to 15 million transistors.
</P>
<P>
   Siemens AG and Motorola Corp. are already building a prototype
12-inch wafer factory in Germany, and Puhakki said Samsung, the
Korean electronics company, had also begun aggressively pursuing
the new 12-inch wafer technology.
</P>
<P>
   Intel's announcement is certain to touch off a new battle for
dominance among companies that make equipment for manufacturing
chips. Intel currently buys its stepper machines principally from
the Japanese manufacturer Nikon and secondarily from the Silicon
Valley Group, Puhakki said. &QL;

BIG D IS HOT FOR ICE HOCKEY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JIM HENDERSON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Dallas this week is steeped in an ice fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   Why not?
</P>
<P>
   The summer solstice is still nearly two weeks away and daytime
temperatures already are crowding triple digits. The sidewalks are
searing enough to render chicken fat and humidity hangs like napalm
in the afternoon air.
</P>
<P>
   But, the weather doesn't have anything to do with this fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've become addicted to it,'' said Nancy Hanson, whose white
blouse reflected and amplified the blazing sunlight outside Reunion
Arena, where the building's exhaust fans strained to preserve the
only ice in town that seemed to matter. ``My husband got me
interested in it. He's from Duluth.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanson arrived two hours early Tuesday for the first game of the
National Hockey League's Stanley Cup Finals pitting the Dallas
Stars and Buffalo Sabres. She waited in wilting heat for an event
that seems oddly out of its habitat, like an animal that strayed
from the frozen north and found itself surrounded by a strange,
gawking species in short sleeves and sandals.
</P>
<P>
   For days, the buzz on the radio and in the newspapers has been
Dallas isn't a hockey town and, to most of the locals, the Stanley
Cup is just another big beer mug. The Stars have been in town since
1993 and until this week there were serious sports fans about who
couldn't name three of the players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, this is not a hockey town,'' Jerry Sullivan of the
Buffalo News wrote. ``I was in the city for two hours without
finding one shred of evidence the Stanley Cup Finals would be
opening here the next night. No banners. No souvenir stands. The
newspaper honor box had a photo of Juan Gonzalez, the baseball
slugger. We popped on a sports radio station and the first words we
heard were, `Overall, this city doesn't care about hockey.'''
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly true.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Stars arrived, hockey has been like fescue grass,
taking root in the shade cast by the NFL's Cowboys, baseball's
Rangers and the NBA's Mavericks.
</P>
<P>
   Fans such as Hanson have been addicted to the sport for only a
few years, but they are hooked hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the action,'' she said. ``It's fast-moving and it's a
double-skill sport. They have to play the game and skate at the
same time.''
</P>
<P>
   This year the team sold out 40 of its 41 regular-season games.
In the first two days of this week, nearly 10,000 people stood in
line for as long as an hour to get a look at the Stanley Cup on
display at the Museum of Modern Art, where Stars souvenirs were on
sale in the museum store and the restaurant's hot dogs were renamed
the Stanley Dog.
</P>
<P>
   It might not have been apparent to out-of-town sportswriters,
but here is one measure of Dallas' devotion to hockey: The word
outside the arena Tuesday was that some ticket holders were being
offered $1,000 or more for prime seats and even a roost in the
nosebleed section was worth $300.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you ever been to a game?'' said Tom Guidry, as a way of
explaining his passion. ``Crazy fans. Rabid fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Like most North Texas natives, Guidry didn't discover hockey
until the Stars came to town. He's seldom missed a televised game
since. (A minor-league team, the Blackhawks, never had much of a
following and faded several years ago.)
</P>
<P>
   Billy and Monica Stark are season-ticket holders and have been
ardent fans for two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot of fun,'' Billy Stark said. ``A lot of people
around here still don't understand the game, but if you can follow
soccer, you can follow hockey.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in the shade of a small tree, they explained they
arrived at the arena two hours early to beat the traffic and take
in the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Not far away a barbecue catering service had set up a chow line

LOCKHEED EARNINGS DROP SHARPLY, SENDING SHARE PRICES DOWN  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By LESLIE WAYNE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lockheed Martin Corp., the nation's largest military contractor,
has had a streak of bad luck in the air. Orders for its C-130J
cargo plane _ the one seen delivering arms and supplies to global
hot spots _ are sagging and its satellites have been launched, and
then flopped.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, these problems in the sky fell to the bottom line
when the company announced a sharp drop in expected earnings for
the next two years _ to about half of what most analysts had
predicted.
</P>
<P>
   This sudden, and somewhat unexpected, announcement sent Lockheed
shares plunging $5.5625, or more than 13 percent, to $34.875, a low
not seen in three years. Lockheed also said top executives in
several divisions were being shuffled and it was thinking about
shedding some noncore businesses to improve its performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've substantially reduced our financial outlook for 1999 and
2000,'' said Vance D. Coffman, Lockheed's chief executive. ``As
CEO, I'm acutely aware of the severity of the problem and the
damage it does to both our credibility and our reputation. I am
disappointed to report that the financial review we initiated in
April has uncovered some negative surprises.''
</P>
<P>
   For the second quarter of 1999, the company predicts a loss of
10 to 15 cents a share. For the whole year, Lockheed estimates it
will earn about $1.50 a share. That compares with earnings of $3.10
a share expected by analysts, according to First Call, which tracks
Wall Street forecasts. In 2000, Lockheed expects to earn $2.15 a
share, compared with the $3.39 a share forecast by analysts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't let anyone tell you that the fact Lockheed revised its
earnings downward was a surprise,'' said Pierre A. Chao, an analyst
with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. ``It wasn't. But the magnitude was
a surprise. Regardless of whether you were a bull or a bear on this
stock, no one expected anything this big.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard Rubel, an analyst with Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., added:
``It's not a surprise Lockheed missed its earnings targets again.
The size of the decline is arresting.''
</P>
<P>
   What lies behind Lockheed's dismal announcement is a tale of a
tough confluence of business and technology, politics and the
Pentagon budget. A big contributor to the lowered earnings
projections was cutbacks in orders for the C-130J cargo plane by
the Air Force and foreign nations. This accounted for 70 cents a
share in the 1999 earnings reduction and 26 cents a share in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Pressed by a tight military budget and facing conflicting
priorities for other airplanes, the Air Force has delayed purchases
of C-130J's, and other countries have fallen behind in their
orders, too. This means Lockheed will slow its production line to
16 to 19 planes a year instead of 24. The company has already cut
21 percent of its work force, or 2,000 employees, at its C-130J
plant in Marietta, Ga. On the political side, the resignation from
Congress of former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, whose district
included Marietta, removed a powerful ally in Congress to keep
money flowing to this project.
</P>
<P>
   Then, there were the satellites that failed instead of flew.
Four satellite launchings have failed over the last eight months _
a costly and perplexing setback. With names like Titan, Proton and
Atlas, the satellite program has not been anything close to what
those mighty names suggest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our well-publicized launch failures have led to major changes
at the head of those business sectors,'' Coffman said. ``Our new
team is dedicated toward restoring mission success.''
</P>
<P>
   That could be a difficult task. ``The truth is that no one knows
what the problem with Lockheed's space program is,'' said Loren
Thompson, a military analyst at the Lexington Institute in
Arlington, Va. ``It's traceable to different specific failures
rather than a pattern of failures, and this makes it difficult to
anticipate when the program will get back on track.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Thompson remained somewhat sanguine. ``If there's a
silver lining, Lockheed has gone from being fairly optimistic to
being brutally honest, and it is still probably the best positioned
of the major defense companies,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the last decade, and under previous management, Lockheed
diversified into a complex conglomerate, expanding beyond military
and aerospace into missiles and space, electronics, energy and the
environment and information technology. Yesterday, Coffman signaled
that the company might begin to narrow its focus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Defense and aerospace is our core business,'' Coffman said,
adding that some noncore businesses would be shed through sales,
joint ventures or public offerings.
</P>
<P>
   He also said further management changes would be in the offing
if results did not improve. ``I am instilling a culture of
accountability that is very much different than it has been in the
past in this corporation,'' Coffman said. ``We owe it to our
shareholders and selves to be accountable for our performance and
anything else is simply unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubel of Goldman said, ``It's encouraging management has stepped
up to change the culture of the company, but I think it's important
to watch how the company performs before investors buy the
shares.''

</P>
<P>
   In a Global Reorganization In an effort to loosen its stiff
corporate culture and free up more cash for product development,
Procter &AMP; Gamble said that it would cut 15,000 jobs worldwide _ or
13 percent of its work force _ close 10 plants and take $2 billion
in charges related to the reorganization. P&AMP;G also said that its
financial results for the current quarter would be flat and would
improve only modestly the next quarter. But Durk Jager, the
company's chief executive, nonetheless tried to assure analysts and
investors that the reorganization would spur future growth and save
about $900 million a year by 2004.

DECISION IN COSBY CASE IS OVERTURNED; RULING MEANS FREEDOM FOR
AUTUMN JACKSON 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Pa.) (rk) 
 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A federal appeals court in Manhattan on Wednesday
overturned the conviction of Autumn Jackson, who went to prison for
threatening to tell a supermarket tabloid that she was Bill Cosby's
out-of-wedlock daughter unless he paid her $40 million.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by a three-judge panel of the Court of Appeals
raised the possibility of a new trial for Ms. Jackson, who has
already spent about 14 months in prison, and for two associates
whose convictions were also thrown out.
</P>
<P>
   It could also have broader legal significance, experts said, by
helping to clarify what constitutes an acceptable threat and what
constitutes blackmail or extortion.
</P>
<P>
   The court ruled that the jury should have been allowed to
consider whether Ms. Jackson believed she had a rightful claim to
the money in light of her claim that Cosby was her father. The
trial judge had told the jury that Ms. Jackson's belief was
irrelevant to whether she was guilty of extortion.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White, whose office prosecuted Ms. Jackson
and the two others in 1997, said that prosecutors were still
reviewing the opinion late Wednesday and had not reached a decision
about whether to appeal the new ruling or retry the case.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Ms. Jackson, meanwhile, said that they would seek to
have her released by the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jackson, who was sentenced to 26 months in prison, has been
held at the Federal Correctional Institution at Dublin, Calif.,
near San Francisco. She had not yet learned of the ruling Wednesday
afternoon because she was out of the prison on a work detail, said
one of her lawyers, Edward S. Zas.
</P>
<P>
   Cosby did not issue a statement Wednesday, but his lawyer,
Andrew D. Schau, said the actor would ``respect and support
whatever decision'' is reached by Ms. White.
</P>
<P>
   The original trial, in the summer of 1997, captured national
attention because of Cosby's role as victim. The evidence showed
that Ms. Jackson made her $40 million demand on the same day that
Cosby's son, Ennis, was killed in California, though there was no
connection between the two incidents.
</P>
<P>
   During the trial, Cosby, who had built an enormous reputation
through television and books as a loving father and a symbol of
moral values, denied being Ms. Jackson's father but admitted to
having had a brief affair with her mother and to having paid the
mother more than $100,000 over the years to keep the affair secret.
</P>
<P>
   The defense contended that Ms. Jackson's conduct was not illegal
because she honestly believed she was the actor's daughter and
therefore had a claim against him.
</P>
<P>
   In upsetting the convictions, Judge Amalya L. Kearse, writing
for a three-judge panel of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ,
said that not all threats to reputation amounted to extortion.
</P>
<P>
   She said the jury should have been allowed to consider whether
Ms. Jackson believed she had a rightful claim to the money she was
demanding. At trial, Judge Barbara S. Jones of U.S. District Court
in Manhattan had instructed the jury that it made no difference
whether Ms. Jackson was Cosby's daughter or believed she had a
right to the money.
</P>
<P>
   Kearse noted, however, that even had the jury been given proper
instructions, the evidence was ``plainly sufficient'' to support
guilty verdicts against Ms. Jackson and her co-defendants because
the jury might have concluded her demands were too extreme, even of
a father.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if Jackson were Cosby's child,'' Kearse wrote, ``a
rational jury could find that her demand, given her age (22), and
the amount ($40 million), did not reflect a plausible claim for
support.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling should help clarify the murky law on extortion, said
Leo Katz, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law School
and author of the book ``Ill-Gotten Gains: Evasion, Blackmail,
Fraud, and Kindred Puzzles of the Law.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This decision will be treated as significant guidance as to
what sorts of threats you can make to get obligations met,'' Katz
said.

ZONE BY ZONE: 1 DAYS TO SERBS' WITHDRAWAL AND OCCUPATION BY NATO 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Under the provisions of the Balkans military
agreement reached Wednesday, Yugoslavia is to withdraw its 40,000
troops from Kosovo along four designated routes within 11 days to
permit the rapid entry of a NATO security force into the besieged
province.
</P>
<P>
   The accord calls for an immediate cease-fire and divides Kosovo
into three zones for a four-stage withdrawal that tries to insure
an orderly pull-out and minimize the risk of clashes between
Yugoslav and NATO troops.
</P>
<P>
   In the first stage, NATO is to suspend the 78-day air war if
Belgrade demonstrates within 24 hours of Wednesday's signing that
its forces in northern Kosovo, called Zone 3, are pulling out. The
allied military commander, Gen. Wesley Clark, will decide whether
the Yugoslav forces are complying.
</P>
<P>
   Five days later, all Yugoslav forces must leave Zone 1, a
V-shaped area in southern Kosovo that borders Albania and Macedonia
and runs up to Pristina, the provincial capital and headquarters
for the NATO peacekeeping force, which will be known as KFOR.
</P>
<P>
   By June 18, three days later, all Yugoslav troops in Zone 2, in
central Kosovo, must leave. And by June 20, all remaining Yugoslav
forces must have withdrawn, refraining along the way ``from
committing any hostile or provocative acts of any type against any
person in Kosovo,'' according to the five-page accord.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sound agreement that meets all of NATO's demands,''
said Defense Secretary William Cohen on Wednesday night at the
Pentagon. ``The real test will be whether the Serbs will live up to
this agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   The agreement and its two-page attachment grant sweeping
authority to the British officer heading the allied force, Lt. Gen.
Michael Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``The international security force (KFOR) commander is the final
authority regarding interpretation of this agreement and the
security aspects of the peace settlement it supports,'' the accord
says. ``His determinations are binding on all parties and
persons.''
</P>
<P>
   The accord also gives Jackson the authority ``to do all that he
judges necessary and proper, including the use of military force,''
to carry out the mission.
</P>
<P>
   With a Yugoslav military withdrawal apparently imminent, the
first of 7,000 U.S. troops who are to join the 48,000-soldier
allied force prepare to move toward the Kosovo border.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,900 U.S. marines on ships in the Aegean are to begin
landing at Salonika, Greece, at daybreak Thursday, Pentagon
officials said. The marines will drive north into Macedonia to
staging areas near its capital, Skopje.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, 1,700 U.S. soldiers now in Albania will begin
moving overland into Macedonia at first light on Thursday, Pentagon
officials said. An advanced Army command unit with 200 troops is to
fly overnight to Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   All the U.S. forces should be in place within five days, a
Pentagon official said Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav forces that are to withdraw will assemble at
designated points and then travel along four routes on which NATO
has guaranteed safe passage.
</P>
<P>
   As they withdraw, Yugoslav forces will be responsible for
marking and clearing minefields, booby traps and other obstacles.
The accord requires the Yugoslav military to provide detailed
records, positions and descriptions of all mines, unexploded bombs
and other possible hazards within 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon and allied officials have underscored that one of the
their troops' main jobs at the start will be to clear mines that
could hurt NATO troops and thousands of refugees returning home.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen indicated that refugees would be kept from returning until
the security forces could insure their safety. ``We hope to get
them back as quickly as we can, but as safely as we can,'' Cohen
said. ``Safety will be the primary driving factor here.''
</P>
<P>
   The agreement also calls for a 15-mile buffer zone from the
Kosovo border inward that is to be free from surface-to-air missile
batteries, and a three-mile buffer zone in which there are to be no
Yugoslav ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   Despite an upbeat assessment from Cohen and other allied
officials, the military agreement has enough ambiguity to cause
possible problems or confusion.
</P>
<P>
   For example, one provision requires that for the bombing pause
to take effect, Yugoslav ``forces located in Zone 3 will have
vacated'' within 24 hours of the agreement. Taken literally, that
would mean all the Yugoslav troops in that zone now and those that
would pass through it from the south would have only until Thursday
to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials said however that in this case they are
simply looking for a demonstrable withdrawal that shows Belgrade is
dealing in good faith.
</P>
<P>
   Another provision allows the Yugoslav military six days from
Wednesday to withdraw from Zone 1, in southern Kosovo. But NATO is
keen to move in its forces as soon as possible after approval of a
United Nations Security Council resolution backing the accord,
which could happen Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Allied commanders do not want to bump into Serbian troops on
their way out, but they also do not want what the agreement terms
``a security gap,'' which Yugoslavs fear could be exploited by the
guerrillas of the Kosovo Liberation Army and which foreign
diplomats fear might be used by the Serbs in some unspecified way.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of this will be General Jackson's call on the ground,''
a senior Pentagon official said.
</P>
<P>
   The allies will use a wide range of technology to monitor the
withdrawal, from spy satellites to unmanned drones to a special
plane, Jstars, that tracks the movements of large troop masses on
the ground.
</P>
<P>
   But senior U.S. officials said it may be impossible to detect _
or stop _scattered violence or even atrocities committed by Serbian
forces as they pull out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly it's very difficult to verify 100 percent on any
agreement here,'' Gen. Joseph Ralston, the vice chairman of the
U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters Wednesday night. ``You
have to rely upon, certainly, the intentions of the people involved
and use all the evidence that you've got.''

WITH SIGNS OF YUGOSLAV WITHDRAWAL, NATO RAIDS SLOW TO NEAR HALT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ With the formal agreement by the Yugoslav
military to allow an international peacekeeping force to enter the
embattled Kosovo province, NATO air strikes came to a virtual halt
Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Although Serbian attacks against the Kosovo Liberation Army had
continued into this week, an allied command spokesman, Maj. Gen.
Walter Jertz, said Wednesday that allied military intelligence had
concluded that the reason Serbian forces were shelling Albanian
positions along and across the border was to get into a position to
withdraw without being harried by their enemies as they leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``Artillery fire is often used by ground troops to assist in
breaking contact with closing enemy forces,'' Jertz said, also
citing reports of looting by Serbian soldiers in Pristina, the
provincial capital, and elsewhere in central Kosovo as signs that
they were preparing to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Serbian tanks and artillery that had been seen moving from the
center of the province to reinforce the troops on the Albanian
border, Jertz said, were also apparently going to be used to
protect the Serbian forces as they withdrew.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not attack military forces withdrawing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Gen. Hans-Peter von Kirchbach, chief of staff of
the German army, said: ``Since this morning, the air strikes have
all but stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jertz said later that air operations continued throughout
the day. Still, he and other officials here did not dispute that,
but for the shouting, the fight was over.
</P>
<P>
   Some 17,500 French, British and German troops are already
assembled in Macedonia for the 50,000-strong peacekeeping force,
and more are on the way. The United States is expected to provide
7,000 troops, about as many as France, while Britain will
contribute at least 13,000 and Germany will send 8,500.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Wesley Clark, NATO's supreme allied commander, kept tight
control over the bombing campaign in the last few days, ratcheting
the number of missions up and down to keep pressure on Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic to live up to the pledge he first made
last Thursday in Belgrade to pull his troops out of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Allied planes flew 523 missions between Tuesday morning and
Wednesday morning, 135 fewer than in the previous 24-hour period,
the command said. Most focused on Serbian army forces battling the
Kosovo Liberation Army near the Albanian border. Bombs and missiles
struck eight artillery pieces, two armored personnel carriers,
eight tanks, and fortified positions and military vehicles and
other targets in two places in southern Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   NATO spokesman Jamie Shea said that B-52 bombers and other
attacking planes had inflicted heavy losses on Serbian forces in
Kosovo in the past week alone, hitting 29 tanks, 93 armored
personnel carriers, 209 artillery pieces, 11 antiaircraft radars,
and other equipment in the seven days since Milosevic first agreed
to pull out of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the sort of losses no army can suffer for long and
remain operational,'' Shea said.
</P>
<P>
   Allied commanders believe a B-52 strike Sunday on Serbian troops
concentrated near the Albanian border may have killed and wounded
several hundred of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have obviously also witnessed the loss of many Yugoslav
soldiers, we don't know how many,'' Shea said. ``But they did not
need to either be killed or be injured.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not NATO which is prolonging the air operations beyond
the point at which we would have liked to have suspended them,'' he
said. ``It is Milosevic.''
</P>
<P>
   In all, the allies claim to have killed or wounded thousands of
Yugoslav soldiers, police and paramilitaries, and destroyed or
damaged 150 tanks, 300 armored personnel carriers, and 325
artillery pieces since the bombing began March 24.
</P>
<P>
   The air campaign destroyed scores of highway and rail bridges
and all of the country's oil refining capacity, and more than 100
aircraft, including all but two of Yugoslavia's most advanced
MiG-29 fighters, the allies say, leaving Yugoslavia's airfields in
ruins, its vaunted weapons factories wrecked, and its national
communications system disrupted.
</P>
<P>
   The high-tech campaign cost the allies only two deaths, they
say, both from the crash of a U.S. anti-tank helicopter in a
training accident in Albania in May.
</P>
<P>
   Jertz said that Serbian antiaircraft fire had brought down an
unpiloted allied surveillance aircraft Tuesday. Several low-flying
drones have been downed by Serbian antiaircraft fire, which keeps
allied planes flying higher than 15,000 feet much of the time.

MOELLER HAS FOND OPEN MEMORIES

 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA -- Terry Moeller will be like millions of golf fans who
tune in to watch next week's U.S. Open at Pinehurst, but his
interest will run deeper than most because he's been there.
</P>
<P>
   It was 33 years ago that Moeller, head professional at Santa
Anita Golf Course, played in the U.S. Open at Olympic Golf Club,
where Billy Casper beat a fading Arnold Palmer. And it was six
years later that he competed in the Open at Pebble Beach, where
Jack Nicklaus hit his legendary one-iron off the flagstick on the
17th hole and won his third Open championship.
</P>
<P>
   Moeller said the passage of time has faded some of his memories
of those events, but others remain vivid -- like being inducted
into the Army two weeks after the '66 Open, going to Vietnam, being
shot and surviving through six operations in four countries in 52
days. He still suffers from lower back pain and has shrapnel in his
shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   He also remembers being around the likes of Tony Lema, Tommy
Jacobs and George Knudsen in 1966, then watching Casper rally from
seven strokes behind to catch a fading Palmer in a stunning upset.
Moeller said Casper never has received the credit he deserved,
despite shooting an impressive 32 on the back nine to tie Palmer in
Sunday's final round. He beat him in a playoff the next day.
</P>
<P>
   ``For 33 years, people have been writing and talking about how
Palmer collapsed at Olympic,'' Moeller said. ``Every time I hear
that, I keep saying, `Wait a minute.'''
</P>
<P>
   Moeller also remembers hearing Nicklaus praise the shot-making
abilities of his good friend, Cesar Sanudo, after the third round
of the '72 tournament. Nicklaus told ABC television's Jim McKay
that it was one of the most impressive rounds he had ever seen from
tee to green, but Sanudo could not make a putt and finished with a
78.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm listening to them in back of the 18th green,'' Moeller,
who turns 53 in October, said, ``and Nicklaus is saying, `I just
saw a round of golf where I don't think a human being could strike
any shot any better.' He had hit every green in regulation, except
the par-5 second hole, and he was on that green in two.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thinking, `This is about a guy I grew up with; this is
great. What a charge.'''
</P>
<P>
   Moeller, who failed to make the cut in each Open, is expecting
difficult conditions for next week's tournament at Pinehurst, only
because they have been that way in the Open for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to recognize the difference between any golf
tournament and the U.S. Open,'' Moeller said. ``It's almost like
soldiers going into combat, the difference between fun and fear.
It's played on a different golf course each year, but they all have
severe similarities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The greens are slick and fast, the sand traps are as wide and
as deep as bomb craters, and the fairways are so narrow you can use
them to conduct sobriety tests. The rough alongside each fairway
and around each green is jungle deep. It's just grown thatch.
</P>
<P>
   ``In an Open, you must play defensively for pars just to protect
yourself from disaster on each hole. In the Open, there are 30,000
people out there, and they're all waiting for terrible things to
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Moeller said he has no second thoughts about not giving the pro
tour a try. He tried to qualify for the Open in 1980 at Industry
Hills, but barely broke 80. The disappointing round solidified his
worst fears that he wasn't good enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having grown up in San Diego, where there were so many good
players, I just knew I could play OK, but not at that level,'' he
said. ``Golf has been very good to me. I still continue to enjoy
it, and it's fun to get up and come here every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just didn't have it and I knew it. There's nothing wrong
with being marginal. I've had a lot of fun being marginal in my
life.''

EXPOS COMPLETE SWEEP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ Among his other talents, it may now be said that
Pedro Martinez can also raise the dead. He just couldn't save the
Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   With Olympic Stadium energized by the return of Martinez _ who
judging by the reception he got here Wednesday night was as popular
in this town as Rocket Richard, Jean Beliveau, and Ken Dryden
before he was traded _ the Expos hammered the Red Sox, 13-1,
completing a hat trick of sorts.
</P>
<P>
   The Expos, playing before a crowd of 19,012 that was bigger than
the last two combined, swept the three-game set from the Sox,
outscoring Boston, 26-4.
</P>
<P>
   They sent the Sox, who were outhit 14-5, to their fifth straight
defeat, the longest losing streak in more than a year for the Sons
of Jimy Williams.
</P>
<P>
   They ended a nine-game winning streak for Martinez (11-2), who
hadn't lost since April 15 but was lifted after a yield of four
runs and six hits in six innings.
</P>
<P>
   And the night took an even worse turn before it was over, as the
Expos added an eight-run insult in the eighth inning against three
relievers _ Mark Portugal, Mark Guthrie, and John Wasdin. Guthrie
gave up a home run to an Expos pitcher Guillermo Mota, a converted
minor league shortstop who went deep in his first official at-bat.
Wasdin, who was taken deep in blowing a save in the opener here,
gave up a home run to the first batter he faced, Manny Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   The cheers began for Martinez when he was shown warming up on
the video scoreboard. The first standing ovation came when he took
the mound, which elicited a wave from the Sox pitcher. There was
another ovation when he came to bat for the first time, and even
some polite clapping when he failed to put down a bunt.
</P>
<P>
   In the back of the left-field bleachers, where they were
tracking Martinez's ``K's'' as if they were sitting on Van Ness
Street in Boston, fans unfurled a huge blue-and-white banner
reading, ``Welcome Back, Pedro.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez clearly basked in the attention before the game, when
he deviated from his usual routine on days he starts. He was out on
the field, chatting amiably with fans and field workers, signing
autographs. When he pitched for the Expos, he always took batting
practice the day before he pitched. Wednesday, he took BP, and
behind the cage scolded Montreal's young star Vladimir Guerrero for
his slow home run trot the night before after taking Tim Wakefield
deep.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Martinez would deliver that message even more forcefully,
buzzing his friend with an eye-level fastball with the first pitch
he threw Guerrero in the second inning.
</P>
<P>
   But Expos manager Felipe Alou scoffed at the idea that Martinez
would find it hard to pitch in the midst of the lovefest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It won't be difficult for him,'' Alou said. ``Pedro's got
something good going, and he's also the guy who is expected to stop
a losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pedro's no fool. He's a responsible man and a competitive
pitcher. He understands what's expected of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Alou's words rang true as Martinez breezed through the first
three innings, striking out four and allowing just one base runner,
Shane Andrews, who walked. But the veneer of invincibility cracked
in the fourth, when Jose Vidro lined a double to the
right-center-field gap to open the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Rondell White bounced a ground-ball single up the middle,
scoring Vidro with the game's first run. Orlando Merced was retired
on a tapper in front of the plate, White advancing to second, and
Guerrero pulled an outside pitch through the left side for an RBI
single to make it 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   Since giving up three runs in the eighth inning against Tampa
Bay in his second start April 10, Martinez had not allowed as many
as two runs in an inning in his next 10 starts, a span of 77 2/3
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, he did it twice, as the Expos widened their
lead to 4-0 in the sixth. White bounced a one-out single and went
to third as Merced doubled into the right-field corner. Martinez
elected to give an intentional walk to Guerrero, the first he's
issued this season, but rookie catcher Michael Barrett crossed up
that strategy by lining an 0-and-2 pitch into center for a two-run
single.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, who reached double figures in strikeouts (10) for the
44th time in his career, ninth time this season, and 17th time as a
member of the Red Sox, was lifted for Portugal at the start of the
seventh. It was just the third time in 13 starts that he has not
pitched more than six innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox, meanwhile, were held scoreless for 15 consecutive
innings, from the time they scored a first-inning run Tuesday
against rookie Dan Smith until they broke through in the seventh
against Mike Thurman, a 25-year-old righthander who came into the
game with exactly six big league wins in his career.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox showed a little more patience against Thurman than they
did Smith, but were victimized by some terrific Expos defense and
their own penchant to hit line drives directly at a Montreal
fielder, six times in the first eight innings. Mike Stanley, who
hit a towering drive inches foul in the sixth that could have been
a tying home run, followed with another drive into the gap in
right-center, where White crashed into the fence making a leaping
catch.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Trot Nixon opened the eighth with a smash that was
smothered by first baseman Ryan McGuire, who flipped to Thurman
covering. But Troy O'Leary, who came into the game in the seventh
in a double switch when Portugal entered, singled and scored on a
double by Jose Offerman.
</P>
<P>
   Thurman came out of the game to an ovation grander than any
afforded Martinez, and reliever Mota set down Jeff Frye and Nomar
Garciaparra to end the inning.

COMPUTER EXPORTERS MUST GET APPROVAL BEFORE SELLING TO SIX CHINESE
SITES

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In an effort to prevent sensitive technology from
being used by the Chinese military, the Commerce Department has
told exporters that shipments to six missile and nuclear sites in
China will require federal approval.
</P>
<P>
   The sites _ which include research institutes _ were publicly
identified last month, when their names and addresses were
published in the Federal Register. The move came the same week a
select congressional committee, headed by Rep. Christopher Cox,
R-Calif., criticized the Commerce Department for not being vigilant
enough in policing exports of technology to China.
</P>
<P>
   In late 1995, President Clinton decided to relax export controls
on some high-performance computers and transferred responsibility
for screening buyers of these computers from the government to
exporters. The White House promised to create a program to help
them and began to compile a list of foreign military and nuclear
sites that would still require federal approval.
</P>
<P>
   The list first appeared in 1997, with over a dozen sites,
including some in Russia and India.
</P>
<P>
   R. Roger Majak, the assistant secretary of commerce for Export
Administration, said that of the six new entities on the list, most
were added after American companies inquired about possible sales
months ago.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the delay in adding the six was caused by the
administration's desire to be cautious in labeling foreign sites,
as well as by the process of getting consent from a handful of
other federal agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Milhollin, the director of the Wisconsin Project on Nuclear
Arms Control, a nonprofit watchdog group affiliated with the
University of Wisconsin, said all six sites have long been known to
be involved in nuclear or missile work and should have been on the
list earlier.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the release of the Cox Committee report on
China's acquisition of American technology, and as Congress begins
to weigh its recommendations, the export of powerful computers has
emerged as a particularly nettlesome issue.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 150 advanced computers were sold to commercial buyers in
China under the relaxed rules in 1996 and 1997. Hundreds more have
been sold since then, but under tighter rules imposed by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Given the role of the state in China's economy, it is not easy
to tell whether China's military gained access to technology bought
by commercial customers. Cox told a Senate hearing last month about
China's ``application of U.S. high-performance computers to nuclear
weapons applications.''
</P>
<P>
   But Majak said that the administration's position was: ``There
is no evidence that any American computers have been used by China
for nuclear weapons purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the Senate Banking Committee, which has
jurisdiction over export controls, is to hear from Cox and the
select committee's ranking Democrat, Norm Dicks, of Washington
state. The committee's unanimous report included a recommendation
that Congress renew the Export Administration Act, which expired in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, during Clinton's visit to China, Beijing agreed for
the first time to allow checks on American imports. But the Cox
Committee said the agreement was ``wholly inadequate'' in general
and ``useless'' with regard to computers.
</P>
<P>
   The administration, citing Beijing's concerns about its
sovereignty, did not allow the committee to disclose details of the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   But a copy of the agreement, labeled ``secret,'' shows that
inspections are left to the discretion of Beijing. The agreement
says that Chinese officials will conduct inspections ``on a
case-by-case basis'' and ``if personnel and resources permit.''
Officials from the U.S. Embassy ``will be invited, as necessary, to
participate'' in the checks, it says.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Hoydysh, the director of trade policy for Unisys Corp., a
computer manufacturer, said that some of the Cox Committee's ideas
were commendable, but its advice on what kinds of computers need to
be strictly controlled was ``really outdated.''
</P>
<P>
   And he said the committee's call for tighter inspections of
advanced computers sold to China was ``not feasible'' because
projected computer sales worldwide were ``literally in the hundreds
of thousands.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, he and other computer executives are to meet at the
White House with administration officials to discuss their
concerns. They are likely to find a receptive audience.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after he took office in 1993, Clinton wrote a computer
executive that ``one reason I ran for president was to tailor
export controls to the realization of a post-Cold War world.''
</P>
<P>
   Easing controls, Clinton added, ``can help unleash our companies
to compete successfully in the global market.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cox Committee has raised the question of whether the Clinton
administration's emphasis on global competition has been consistent
with American national security.

U.S. BOND MARKET STILL WARY OF WORLD MARKETS

 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Is the financial crisis that first erupted in the
global economy about two years ago really over? Or is there a
lighted stick of dynamite somewhere out there just waiting to
explode?
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks leading to the meeting of Federal Reserve policy
makers on June 30 _ a meeting that both stock and bond investors
seem increasingly convinced will produce an increase in short-term
interest rates _ the signals coming from the markets on the state
of the world's economies could not be more mixed. While stock
traders around the world exude confidence and find last fall's
market meltdown just a hazy memory, the U.S. bond market remains
fearful.
</P>
<P>
   The worry is not only the traditional one _ that inflation is
coming back to life. There is also a renewed foreboding that some
yet-unidentified crisis looms on the horizon that will put an end
to the belief that the fever that gripped much of the world is
safely under control.
</P>
<P>
   Because the nation's enormous debt markets are not as
transparent as its stock markets, assaying bond investors' overall
mood is tricky. But strategists say the market for non-Treasury
debt still suffers from a fairly severe lack of liquidity, the
result of an unwillingness among large brokerage firms to risk
capital in their trading of corporate bonds, mortgage-backed
obligations, even Treasury issues that are not among the current
benchmarks.
</P>
<P>
   Further, the risk premiums that investors demand from more
speculative debt securities, which take the form of higher yields
compared with those of Treasury securities with similar maturities,
have been increasing in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the rise in rates reflects fears that inflation may be
returning. Wednesday, the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond _ just
about the safest investment in the world _ closed at 6.02 percent,
the highest close in over a year. But it is not just jitters about
inflation that are rattling the bond market.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, yields on high-grade and high-yield corporate
bonds and even those on less-liquid Treasury bonds and notes, known
as ``off-the-run'' issues, have increased significantly compared
with the yields on the most heavily-traded Treasury securities with
comparable maturities.
</P>
<P>
   This widening of spreads, referring to the difference between
what. say, a junk bond with a 10-year maturity yields over a
Treasury with the same due date, usually indicates that investors
see something worrisome on the horizon that makes them more
risk-averse.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, notes Stan Jonas, managing director of FIMAT USA, a
broker-dealer in New York that specializes in futures and
derivatives, ``off-the-run'' Treasuries have risen against
comparable benchmark issues to levels close to those seen last fall
after Russia defaulted on its debts and the hedge fund Long Term
Capital Management teetered on the edge of collapse.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an underbelly here,'' Jonas said. ``Credit spreads
started to widen out in the last four weeks. People are getting
themselves set up for some real problems. The last time we saw
these kinds of spreads was in the midst of the post-Russia market
dislocations that Greenspan, when he bailed out Long Term Capital,
said were so necessary to address.''
</P>
<P>
   Which makes the widely anticipated move by the Fed to raise
rates very intriguing. Traditionally, Alan Greenspan, the Federal
Reserve chairman, has been wary of a market mood exceptionally
averse to risk because it indicates that capital formation could
easily be crimped. At the height of the market meltdown last fall,
when trading in more speculative bonds virtually ground to a halt,
Greenspan pointed to the frozen market as one of the key reasons
the Fed felt impelled to lower rates three times in a two-month
span by a quarter percentage point each time.
</P>
<P>
   So, several analysts ask, if the bond market is not yet fully
thawed and there is still little evidence of inflation on the
scene, why does the Fed appear poised to raise rates? Of course,
Fed policy makers have more than two weeks to change their views
before the meeting at the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, market watchers will be paying attention to see
if Greenspan has anything to say about monetary policy in his
speech Thursday at the Harvard University commencement. They will
be even more intent on the Fed chairman's planned testimony to the
Joint Economic Committee next Thursday, just one day after the
government releases data on consumer prices for May.
</P>
<P>
   Some strategists wonder if Greenspan is capitalizing on a period
of relative calm in international markets to raise rates to curb
the runaway American stock market. If so, he may be disappointed.
For indomitable stock investors have shown a buoyancy that even the
specter of a rate increase has not depressed. The Dow Jones
industrial average closed Wednesday at 10,690.29, just 3.7 percent
below its May 13 peak of 11,107.
</P>
<P>
   A rate increase by the Fed is now viewed by many equity
investors as solid-gold proof that the world economic crisis has
abated and stocks can be bought aggressively. This, even though
higher bond yields are certain to draw some investor funds out of
the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   When the Fed announced on May 18 that it was shifting its stance
from neutral on interest rates to leaning toward raising rates, it
said: ``Domestic financial markets have recovered and foreign
economic prospects have improved since the easing of monetary
policy last fall.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent rebounds in equity markets around the world _
particularly in previously depressed parts of the Pacific Rim and
Latin America _ are taken as evidence that investors have seen the
depths of the decline that began two years ago when the Thai baht
was devalued. But dispatches from the bond market tell a very
different story.
</P>
<P>
   For example, according to Salomon Smith Barney, last fall junk
bonds yielded a staggering 6.64 percentage points more than did
comparable Treasuries, up from a premium of 3.6 percentage points
in January 1998. In early May, yields on junk had fallen back to
4.71 percentage points more than those on Treasuries. But they
crept back up to a premium of 4.84 percentage points at the end of
the month.
</P>
<P>
   Bond investors, of course, are worriers by nature, while stock
players thumb their noses at risk. But movements in spreads are
watched closely because they reflect the willingness of bond
investors to take risk. When times are good, spreads narrow, as
investors exit the safest investments for the higher yields that
riskier issues offer. Conversely, wider spreads are an indication
that investors are increasingly afraid.
</P>
<P>
   Wider spreads are often a precursor to market turmoil. For
instance, weeks before Russia defaulted on its debt last August,
sending American financial markets into a tailspin, spreads on
non-Treasury debt had been inching up.
</P>
<P>
   The situation today is not as bad as last fall, but it has made
many big brokerage houses wary of committing themselves to a
position. ``Dealers still seem to be constrained,'' said Martin S.
Fridson, chief high-yield strategist at Merrill Lynch &AMP; Company.
``Unless by a miracle, a buyer and seller steps into the
marketplace with the same amount of bonds at the same price,
dealers won't step in.''
</P>
<P>
   One piece of evidence that spooked bond investors recently was
the Fed's May 1999 report on bank lending practices in the United
States, made public on June 4. This survey of senior loan officers
at 60 American banks showed that a greater share of banks had
chosen to be more restrictive in their lending policies in the
previous three months than had done so in the three months leading
up to the January 1999 survey, a period that included the credit
market turmoil of the fall. Why, they wondered, were more banks
tightening their lending policies in what is supposed to be a
healthy economy?
</P>
<P>
   A rising default rate among speculative-grade corporate issuers
certainly does not help. Twenty-three issuers defaulted on $3.4
billion in debt in May, bringing the default rate on corporate debt
tracked by Moody's Investors Service to 4.3 percent for the month
on a trailing 12-month basis, up from 4.1 percent in April. A year
earlier, the rate was 2.72 percent; the average over the long term
is 3.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   There has also been a fairly crowded calendar of bond issues
coming to market recently as issuers try to raise money now in case
of further interest rate increases later this year. Wednesday,
Freddie Mac, Bank of America and Marsh &AMP; McLennan led $9 billion of
corporate debt sales. This supply, and that in the pipeline, weighs
heavily on the market.
</P>
<P>
   Notwithstanding the Fed's sanguine outlook for foreign
economies, many bond watchers fret that many wild cards remain
overseas. Despite its rallying stock market, Japan still seems
gripped by a deflationary spiral. Threats of a devaluation in China
also contribute to a sense of unease in the Pacific Rim. Meanwhile,
Latin America, especially Brazil, remains fragile, as does Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's inevitable that you'll get another Brazil,
another Russia, particularly with commodity prices weak,'' Fridson,
the Merrill Lynch strategist, said. ``I'm just sort of resigned to
those situations continuing to come along periodically because I
don't see any fixes that have been done.''

WHITTAKER'S BOARD OKS MERGER WITH BRITISH MEGGITT PLC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY BEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SIMI VALLEY _ Officials of aerospace specialist Whittaker Corp.
said that the company has agreed to be bought by a British defense
contractor for $380 million in cash and debt.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of 450-employee Whittaker said the proposed purchase
by Meggitt PLC, based in Wimborne, England, will help both
companies leverage their aerospace strengths. Simi Valley-based
Whittaker makes valves and fire-detection equipment while the
larger Meggitt specializes in aviation electronics.
</P>
<P>
   Meggitt spokesman Richard Wool said his employers do not plan to
lay off any Whittaker workers once the purchase is complete.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've bought an ongoing business with great growth
potential,'' Wool said, adding that when the sale is closed
Whittaker will operate as a wholly owned subsidiary. It is unclear,
however, whether the Whittaker corporate headquarters will remain
in Southern California, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Whittaker spokesman John Ottosaid that in the coming weeks
Meggitt officials will consider that question and other ways to
``maximize their investment.''
</P>
<P>
   Though approved by both companies' board of directors, the deal
must still be approved by regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts were enthusiastic about the proposed purchase, which
will pay stockholders $28 for each of their shares. ``It's a pretty
decent price,'' said Brett Hendrickson at B. Riley &AMP; Co. in Los
Angeles. ``I think if you told shareholders six months ago they'd
get $28 a share, they'd have been very happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, financier Michael Tennenbaum in December offered to buy
Whittaker for $208 million, or $18.50 per share. Tennenbaum
reportedly increased his offer a few weeks later by an undisclosed
amount, but his offer was rebuffed.
</P>
<P>
   Whittaker shares closed at $27.50 on Wednesday, up 62.5 cents.
More than 2 million shares traded hands, more than 60 times the
typical daily volume.
</P>
<P>
   Whittaker has been on a roll of late, reporting earnings of
$48.5 million for 1998, compared with a loss of $163.6 million in
1997. Wednesday the firm reported second-quarter earnings of $8.9
million on sales of $40.3 million.

<TEXT>
<P>
   KUMANOVO, Macedonia _ The Yugoslav military on Wednesday night
acceded to an agreement that will permit a military force commanded
by a NATO general with sweeping powers to occupy Kosovo, clearing
the way to an end to the Western alliance's first war.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, signed at a French helicopter base not far from
the border of Kosovo, was immediately approved by NATO leaders
meeting in Brussels. The agreement gave NATO Secretary-General
Javier Solana the authority to suspend bombing once the military
verified that the Serbian-dominated army, police and paramilitary
units had begun to withdraw.
</P>
<P>
   NATO and Pentagon officials have already reported detecting
preparations for a withdrawal after nearly 11 weeks of bombing, and
the air campaign could be suspended as soon as late Thursday or
Friday morning, an official here said, as long as the Serbs keep
their pledges and begin to pull out.
</P>
<P>
   The first of nearly 50,000 NATO troops will then move into
Kosovo, replacing the retreating Serbian forces as they abandon
their positions and head north. The Serbs will have 11 days to
fully pull out or face a resumption of bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, the province will be ringed by a five-kilometer
buffer zone (about three miles) and divided into five sectors, each
under the charge of a major power. NATO is to provide for the safe
return of hundreds of thousands of Albanians who have either fled
the country or been driven from their homes and are hiding in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gen. Michael Jackson, the British officer who led the
negotiations here, will command the international peacekeepers,
with the power to use whatever military might he deems necessary to
enforce the peace, insure the Serbian withdrawal and keep Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic's troops from returning to Kosovo in
force.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is tragic that intransigence has made it necessary for the
international community to resort to air strikes in order to reach
a settlement,'' Jackson said after emerging from a camouflage tent
at the base here at 9:45 p.m. ``However, NATO's resolve in
conducting a sustained air campaign has finally achieved this
agreement, and now is the time to look ahead,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement on the military details of Yugoslavia's withdrawal
from its southern province, cherished as a symbol of Serbian
history and culture, came a week after Milosevic's government
agreed in broad terms to all of NATO's demands. Those included the
withdrawal of all Serbian forces, the intervention of a NATO-led
peacekeeping force and the return of the Kosovo Albanians who fled
their homes.
</P>
<P>
   In a compromise resolving one of the last, most nettlesome
disputes in the talks here, NATO agreed on the 11-day period to
complete the withdrawal of nearly 40,000 soldiers and police
officers from the province, even though Milosevic's government
agreed last week to do so in only a week. The Yugoslav delegation
here had asked for 17 days.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen on Wednesday night warned that
if Milosevic ordered his commanders to drag their heels or
otherwise violate the accord, the air campaign would resume in full
ferocity.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the event there's any reversal of their activities, in the
event there's any evidence that they intend to simply try to bog
this down in some other way, then we made it very clear, the
document makes it very clear, the pause will not longer be in
effect,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, President Clinton spoke cautiously, perhaps
mindful of the week-long delay in nailing down the terms of the
Serbian withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The agreement reached today by NATO and Serbian military
officials is another important step toward achieving our objectives
in Kosovo,'' he said. ``It lays out the details to meet the
essential conditions for peace: the rapid, orderly withdrawal of
all Serb forces from Kosovo and the deployment of an international
security force, called KFOR, with NATO at its core, which means a
unified NATO chain of command so the Kosovars can return home
safely.''
</P>
<P>
   But how long that will take - along with myriad questions about
the future of the Kosovo Liberation Army and its armed struggle for
independence _ remained unclear in spite of Wednesday night's
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Although the return of refugees has become one of NATO's
fundamental objectives in the wake of the bombing campaign, NATO
hopes to hold off a rush of refugees pouring into Kosovo until its
forces have made it safer. In addition to land mines and booby
traps left behind, a major concern of NATO commanders is the
possibility that at least some Serbian soldiers and police officers
will simply shed their uniforms and remain in Kosovo with weapons,
ready to harass NATO troops or returning refugees, the official
here said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the six-page agreement signed here Wednesday night
explicitly authorizes a resumption of the bombing if the Serbs
violate the timetable for withdrawal, it is not clear how NATO
could respond to low-level menacing of its troops.
</P>
<P>
   Another major concern is the willingness of the Kosovar Albanian
rebels to abide by the agreement, which calls for them to disband
as an organized force and turn over their heavy weapons. Clinton
said the alliance had contacted members of the force, the Kosovo
Liberation Army, and received assurances that they would not attack
retreating Serbian forces or try to seize the territory they
abandon.

 KUMANOVO, Macedonia: they abandon.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``This will not be an easy operation and it will take time,''
Jackson said. ``I fully understand the wishes of the refugees to
return home quickly, and I promise that KFOR will do its utmost to
ensure this is done as soon and as safely as possible.'' The
acronym refers to the peace-keeping force.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night's agreement came after a final 24 hours of talks
that came perilously close to collapse once again. At one point,
they appeared to break down completely, when the Yugoslav
delegation, led by Col. Gen. Svetozar Marjanovic, abruptly left the
helicopter base here late Wednesday afternoon, saying they needed
to consult with authorities in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   But the delegation made it only as far as a border post north of
here, in Serbia itself. After telephone discussions with
authorities in Belgrade, the delegation returned to the base an
hour after they left, and the talks resumed.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 24 hours after this latest round began Tuesday night,
Jackson and Marjanovic signed the agreement in what one official
described as a subdued, unceremonious end to five days of wrangling
over the details of the Serb withdrawal. They did not shake hands.
</P>
<P>
   Eager to avoid the appearance of capitulating to NATO's demands,
the Yugoslav delegation had insisted that a withdrawal not begin
until the United Nations Security Council, with Russia and China
wielding veto power, had given the peacekeeping force its formal
approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``The talks today have been, on the military level, generally
constructive,'' said NATO's spokesman here, Lt. Col. Robin
Clifford, shortly after the delegation drove off in a convoy of
sedans and NATO vehicles Wednesday afternoon. ``But as you will
appreciate, some political issues have begun to impinge.''
</P>
<P>
   But when it became clear to the delegation Wednesday that the
Security Council would not force NATO to halt its bombing before a
withdrawal and would authorize the peacekeeping under the chapter
of the U.N. charter that permits the use of force, they relented,
according to a NATO official who attended the talks.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials, who have described these talks not as
negotiations, but rather the ironing out of the details of last
week's agreement, said the final document reflected refinements the
foreign ministers of the seven major industrial nations, along with
Russia, had agreed to Tuesday in Germany. It also put the NATO-led
peacekeepers under the auspices of the United Nations, giving them
what Jackson called ``a clear, legal basis'' for the peacekeeping
force. Not only the Serbs, but also some NATO allies had insisted
on that.
</P>
<P>
   Significantly for the Serbs, the document does not mention NATO
explicitly. Neither did Marjanovic when he appeared before a group
of television journalists to announce the signing Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means that the war has ended,'' Marjanovic said. ``It also
means that the policy of peace prevailed.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the NATO official who attended the talks said the mood
was far from celebratory, indicating that the alliance remained
wary of Milosevic and his intentions over the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not what he says,'' the official said. ``It's not what he
signs. It's what he does.''

 _ SF CHRON  
 Pacific Exchange's New System Lagging  &HT;     By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
The Pacific Exchange's highly touted electronic stock trading
system is attracting far less business than expected, a serious
blow to the San Francisco bourse's push to revive its faltering
stock business.
<P>
   The 5-month-old system, called OptiMark, is handling an average
of about 1 million shares a day, not the 2 million to 5 million
projected for it at this stage, said OptiMark Chairman Bill Lupien.
Problems connecting OptiMark with the order processing systems of
large brokerage firms are behind the shortfall, Lupien said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to build volume. There's no two ways about it,'' said
Lupien during an interview at an electronic brokerage conference in
San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Lupien and exchange officials said they remain optimistic
that OptiMark will overcome shakedown problems and establish a
marketplace niche for itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's early in the game,'' said Lupien. ``And, from the
standpoint of what other new systems have done, our progress is
outstanding.''
</P>
<P>
   One positive sign, Lupien said, is that OptiMark has boosted its
number of institutional clients from 114 when it was launched to
167 today.
</P>
<P>
   OptiMark is one of the keys to reviving Pacific's money-losing
stock business, which is now supported with surpluses produced by
its options exchange.
</P>
<P>
   ``OptiMark is still a critical step to building our equity
business,'' said Pacific spokesman Dale Carlson. ``We're still
committed to the system.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Pacific's share of the stock-trading business
has slipped as large rivals like the New York Stock Exchange cut
prices. Meanwhile, it faces a growing threat from a new generation
of electronic trading systems that bypass exchanges altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific is taking several other steps to make its stock business
competitive again, such as laying plans to close its Pine Street
trading floor to cut costs.
</P>
<P>
   OptiMark's connection problems are due to its failure to link
with the in-house order processing systems used by securities
firms. Currently, most customers have to re-enter orders from their
own electronic systems on to OptiMark.
</P>
<P>
   The company's engineers are in the process of fixing the problem
by setting up electronic connections with customers' order
processing systems, Lupien said. So far, they have linked with the
systems of two large institutional investors and a major brokerage
firm, he said.
</P>
<P>
   People familiar with Pacific's operations said there is still
time to fix OptiMark.
</P>
<P>
   ``To give up on OptiMark would be to give up on the whole equity
business,'' said Warren Langley who retired several months ago as
the exchange's No.2 executive. ``But I think they have until
year-end before they have to make a decision.''
</P>
<P>
   OptiMark, one of a number of competing electronic order
processing systems in the market or under development, allows
institutional investors to avoid moving the price of a stock when
they enter a large buy or sell order.
</P>
<P>
   When an order to buy, say, 1 million shares is given to a live
broker, the market price of the stock will often jump because
supply and demand fall temporarily out of balance.
</P>
<P>
   OptiMark allows a buyer to conceal his identity and the size of
his order. It is filled when a seller who is ready to trade at the
buyer's price enters a separate order anonymously.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific introduced OptiMark in January with only one stock on
the system. It has since extended it to some 2,200 stocks listed on
both Pacific and the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The exchange is considering other electronic systems to handle
retail orders of a few hundred or thousand shares.

 &HT;    Weiss to go onto disabled list
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ An MRI on Wednesday revealed what the Braves had
figured: Walt Weiss' quadriceps injury is pretty serious, and the
15-day disabled list necessary, retroactive to Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was as bad as we thought,'' Braves trainer Dave Pursley
said.
</P>
<P>
   So on with the business of life, for now without Weiss. Manager
Bobby Cox plans to use veteran Ozzie Guillen with an occasional
start by rookie Mark DeRosa, who arrived from AAA Richmond on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Another option would be to move Chipper Jones to shortstop, the
position he played as a kid and throughout his minor league career.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always think about that,'' Cox said. ``But Chipper has
really settled in as one of the premier third basemen in baseball.
You really don't want to mess with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Either way is fine with Jones, who played 38 games at shortstop
in 1996 when Jeff Blauser was injured.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm completely open to any move that would help make us a
better club,'' Jones said. ``I'm a shortstop playing third base.
I've always been a shortstop.''
</P>
<P>
   DeRosa is up for the second time after playing five games for
Atlanta last September. He played with the big league club for much
of spring training and got a handful of starts while Weiss was sick
and Guillen had a sprained thumb.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel comfortable in here,'' said DeRosa unpacking his
belongings in his locker next to Greg Maddux's. ``I definitely know
my place, keep my mouth shut... Spring training was a good test. I
don't want to say I'm comfortable with being out there, but
hopefully I'll get over those nerves pretty quick.''
</P>
<P>
   Assist to Glavine
</P>
<P>
   Tom Glavine takes partial credit for Guillen's four hits on
Tuesday night, which was Guillen's first real sign of offensive
life this season. Glavine had loaned Guillen three of his bats
before Tuesday's game. ``I told him `Go ahead, I ain't doing
anything with it,''' Glavine said.
</P>
<P>
   The bats were originally Brett Boone's, but they weren't the
model Boone wanted. Both Glavine and Guillen like them for their
thicker head, smaller handle. Thirty-four inches, 32 ounces. And of
course, they're better luck for Guillen.
</P>
<P>
   Guillen is keeping three of them, Glavine has three and they are
hoping those last until Glavine can get another order in. He had
sent six of the bats to his younger brother Michael Glavine in AA
Greenville.
</P>
<P>
   Guillen got to bask in his four-hit night, right up until he got
a phone call from his best friend Harold Baines, now playing for
the Orioles, who said the usual good-going, then added: ``Now
you've got 17 points to go to get to .200.''
</P>
<P>
   Klesko back in left
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Klesko was back in the lineup Wednesday night after missing
two games because of the flu, as the experiment continues of having
Klesko in left and a Randall Simon/Brian Hunter platoon at first
base.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't had a whole lot of work out there,'' Klesko said.
``So far, so good.

A BRIDGE BETWEEN A CITY AND ITS SELF-IMAGE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 13) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By HERBERT MUSCHAMP   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jean Nouvel's new design for a hotel and cineplex on
the Brooklyn waterfront strikes me as one of the most imaginatively
conceived pieces of architecture New York has seen in a long time.
I've been groping for ideas to explain why. What makes a building
contemporary? An impossible question to answer, but perhaps not a
fruitless one to ask.
</P>
<P>
   These days, architecture is not governed by a fixed set of
guidelines, as it was, for instance, during the years of the modern
movement. Buildings by Frank Gehry, Rem Koolhaas, Peter Eisenman,
Steven Holl, Tod Williams and Billie Tsien, Daniel Libeskind,
Philippe Starck, Rafael Vinoly, Zaha Hadid, Eric Moss and Thom
Mayne are each highly distinctive in appearance and atmosphere, yet
in common they can quicken your awareness of the present and its
untapped possibilities. Where does that power come from?
</P>
<P>
   Four thoughts. Walter Pater said that critics should ask: ``In
whom did the stir, the genius, the sentiment of the period find
itself?'' That's a start. Iris Murdoch, in ``Metaphysics as a Guide
to Morals,'' offered a more rigorous definition. ``Serious art,''
she wrote, ``is a continuous working of meaning in the light of the
discovery of some truth.''
</P>
<P>
   John Summerson, writing in 1947, also emphasized the idea that
contemporary art depends on a process of continuous working and on
the value of discovery: ``The most a critic can do is to sort out
those aging ideas that get encrusted around past creative
achievements and clog the proper working of the imagination in
changing times.''
</P>
<P>
   And if you can accept that architecture is a public art, indeed
the most conspicuously public art of all, then I think that a
statement by Arthur Danto also helps illuminate the meaning and
value of Nouvel's new design: ``Public art is the public
transfigured. It is us, in the medium of artistic transformation.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, I can't improve on Danto's idea as a depiction of
Nouvel's design. It's a bridgelike building for a city poised
between being and becoming. It shows a city in transition from
manufacturing to information as an economic base. It is playful,
disciplined, sociable and pushy. It refracts into crystalline form
New York's exquisite and infuriating narcissism, a town enthralled
by its cinematic panoramas and animated by the yearning of its
citizens to star in them.
</P>
<P>
   And the project has aroused local opposition that is a form of
narcissism in itself. The opponents seem to be fighting their own
reflection in a mirror.
</P>
<P>
   The River Hotel is part of a plan to redevelop a 72-acre, former
industrial area on the East River called Dumbo (Down Under the
Manhattan Bridge Overpass). The plan, which is seriously flawed,
includes masses of retail shops, a redesign of the small,
disheveled Fulton Landing Park, a small marina and parking garages.
</P>
<P>
   It also proposes housing a museum in the upper floors of Empire
Stores, a handsome set of landmark brick warehouses that border the
eastern edge of the park.
</P>
<P>
   The Brooklyn Bridge Park Coalition, which opposes the plan, is
right to demand that it be reconceived. The hotel itself is another
matter. It deserves support.
</P>
<P>
   Designed to resemble a pier, the hotel complex is in two main
sections. A slim, four-story bar building is cantilevered from atop
a square, five-story box. The bar projects 134 feet out over the
East River and rises to a height of 100 feet, stopping just short
of the Manhattan Bridge roadway. A glass bridge connects the hotel
to a health club and spa across the street.
</P>
<P>
   Nouvel has chosen a spare, industrial vocabulary. The facades
are a simple grid pattern of gray metal fitted with
floor-to-ceiling windows of white glass, so called because of its
high degree of transparency. Because the hotel roof and its
underside would be visible to bridge and water traffic, Nouvel has
treated these surfaces as if they, too, were facades.
</P>
<P>
   On the roof, instead of mechanical equipment, there are
rectangular skylights and landscaped patios for the top floor.
Three levels of public rooms, enclosed by seamless glass walls, are
suspended beneath the building in a reverse ziggurat formation. On
the lower of these floors a dance floor-size square of glass allows
views of the river beneath.
</P>
<P>
   The private rooms are minimally furnished and stylish. The east
wall of each room is lined with mirror, doubling the skyline views.
(Pray for soft lighting.) For the roof of the building, Nouvel has
designed a tilted louver of reflective glass mirror that would cast
reflections through skylights into the top floor rooms.
</P>
<P>
   No museum has yet been named to occupy the old brick warehouses,
and perhaps the proposal to put one there is redundant. The fact is
that Nouvel has designed his cineplex as if it were a museum of
contemporary art. And why shouldn't it be, if films are our leading
popular art form?
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The 16-screen cineplex is housed in a low, rectangular structure
from which the projecting pier form is cantilevered. Nouvel has a
thing about technological gimmicks (like the photosensitive irises
installed in the facade of the Arab World Institute in Paris; alas,
they occasionally break down).
</P>
<P>
   For the cineplex, he has installed windows behind the screens.
These would be raised and lowered between performances, allowing
stunning views of that other great collective art form: the
Manhattan skyline. He has also proposed mounting screens on the
exterior of the building, which could be used for artists'
projects.
</P>
<P>
   Dumbo's developer, David Walentas, the client, calls the design
Main Street Pier. The architect himself calls it a bridge between
two bridges. To my eye, the imagery looks nautical, as if the
defunct Brooklyn Navy Yard nearby had gone into the business of
floating hotels.
</P>
<P>
   There are open and enclosed promenades, reminiscent of those on
the great trans-Atlantic liners. In the public corridors,
surfboard-shape light wells are enclosed by shiplike railings.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the project should be seen as a step toward the time
when New York is once again a great water city, with water taxis,
ferries, piers, parks and other public amenities as well as new
industrial uses enlarging the maritime dimension of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Murdoch's idea helps illuminate this design. Nouvel has
rethought the character of the city's waterfront at a time of
change. If you look down on that site now (and it happens that I
see part of Fulton Landing Park from my kitchen window), it is hard
to believe that this is the ideal location for a luxury hotel.
</P>
<P>
   But you don't have to think ahead too far to glimpse a very
different picture, of a time when water traffic will help to
reshape the city's urban contours, just as the Brooklyn Bridge did
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Will this project be built? Snowball's chance in hell, they say.
But the ideas this particular snowball represents are not going to
melt away. Nouvel has considered both the city's psychological and
physical context. With its mirrors, its views, its white glass
reflections, the building is a portrait of New York's narcissism at
architectural scale.
</P>
<P>
   It brings to mind the famous Saul Steinberg drawing of New
York's self-absorbed view of the world. Like that drawing, it
counters self-absorption with self-awareness. It is a reflection on
the city's narcissism, not a mindless indulgence in it. ``The stir,
the genius, the sentiment of the period'' don't come more
persuasively than this.
</P>
<P>
   In this, it differs from the vanity that has trickled into
architectural preservation circles in recent years. That threatens
to turn an otherwise estimable movement into one of those aging
ideas that get encrusted around past creative achievement and clog
the proper workings of the imagination in changing times.
</P>
<P>
   The preservation movement has been a dominant influence on New
York architecture for two decades, and its achievements are
overwhelmingly constructive. But it has also come to include a
sanctimonious Sacred Cow mentality. Perhaps the time has come to
measure its environmental impact on the quality of New York's
architecture.
</P>
<P>
   Who doesn't love the kind of vanity that we experience when we
check out our reflections in fancy shop windows and see images of
ourselves and the city overlaid atop pouty mannequins? This is one
of the great urban pleasures. Nouvel's building will offer many
similar moments throughout.
</P>
<P>
   There's another kind of narcissistic outlook that is not so
benign. According to this view, the public realm exists only to
reflect popular prejudices, not to challenge or expose them. This
strain has played a major role in New York's resistance to change.
It has led to a confusion between architecture and architectural
history, and in recent years this confusion has covered the city's
architectural aspirations like a blanket of dust.
</P>
<P>
   Nouvel's design and the opposition raised against it are both
immensely narcissistic. The difference is that Nouvel knows what he
is about. He has reworked meaning in light of the discovery of an
important truth about the city today. That's what makes him a
serious artist and his design an important work of art.

MAN ENJOYS FIRST VISIT TO CINEMA IN HALF-CENTURY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY JOHN SANDERS  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Fifty years ago, the New York Yankees beat the
Brooklyn Dodgers in five games in the World Series. Harry Truman
was in the White House after beating Thomas Dewey. And a movie,
popcorn and a soda might cost less than 50 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty years ago was also the last time that 91-year-old Waymon
Holloway saw a movie inside a theater, before he saw ``Star Wars:
Episode 1 _ The Phantom Menace'' on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could never wonder how they could do all those things and
show them on film,'' Holloway, who turns 92 later this month, said
outside the Cinemark 22 cineplex, where he saw George Lucas' fourth
space epic in stadium-style seats with stereo surround sound.
``It's wonderful, a wonderful difference. It was amazing how they
could make those robot characters.''
</P>
<P>
   Much different than when Holloway saw his last movie in black
and white in 1949, ``Heaven Can Wait'' starring Don Ameche, who
later _ much later _ won an Academy Award for ``Cocoon.''
</P>
<P>
   Holloway said that when he viewed ``Heaven Can Wait'' in
Sparkman, Ark., the town had one theater, where popcorn and a soda
were a nickel each and admission about 50 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Holloway was surprised to see the prices in tickets _ $4.25 a
seat for the matinee Holloway attended with his daughter, two
granddaughters and two great-grandchildren _ how fast the movie
moved and all the new technology of the movie.
</P>
<P>
   Holloway said he had a Sprite, popcorn, M&AMP;M's and Whoppers.
</P>
<P>
   Why didn't he go to the movies for 50 years?
</P>
<P>
   `I just found other things to do,'' said Holloway, who came to
the Antelope Valley north of Los Angeles from Arkansas to visit
family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was pretty courageous of him,'' said Holloway's
granddaughter, Nancy Arnold. ``My grandfather is very old-school.
He doesn't do a whole lot except farm. He was amazed to see the new
technology; to see everything, it blew him away.''
</P>
<P>
   Holloway said he probably won't go to the movies anymore, but he
enjoyed watching ``The Phantom Menace.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's great,'' said Barbara Monks, another
granddaughter of Holloway. ``At 92 he's still traveling by himself
and he's open to new things. I was amazed he stayed awake. And his
mouth was open and he was just looking the whole time. I had fun
enjoying him.''

 E-Commerce Growing Faster Than Expected  &HT;     By Deborah Solomon 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Companies doing business on the Internet generated $300 billion in
revenue and created more than 1.2 million jobs last year, according
to a study conducted by the University of Texas that's being
released today.
<P>
   The study, a comprehensive look at the Internet's impact on the
economy, found that electronic commerce is growing at a faster rate
than previously expected. Researchers found that sales of goods
online jumped 175 percent from 1995 to 1998.
</P>
<P>
   It also found that employees who work for companies with
Internet-related revenues are 65 percent more productive than those
in other lines of business, such as the automotive industry.
</P>
<P>
   While other studies have focused on the Internet's contribution
to the national economy, this is the first to measure such a broad
base of companies.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers involved in the study, which was funded by San
Jose's Cisco Systems, interviewed 3,000 firms doing business on the
Web. They range from startups to major corporations like Microsoft
and AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of the six-month study was not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   According to the findings, sales of products on the Web both to
businesses and to consumers generated more than $101 billion and
created almost 492,000 jobs last year.
</P>
<P>
   Although the study did not look at the profits of e-commerce
companies, industry watchers said the revenue figure is significant
because it indicates how substantial online sales are becoming.
</P>
<P>
   ``We identified over 11,000 players in the United States selling
products directly over the Internet,'' said Anitesh Baruna, who
co-conducted the study. ``One grocery chain is selling $32 million
of online groceries in one metro area.''
</P>
<P>
   Ethan Harris, an economist with Lehman Bros., said the study
shows that the Internet has become vital to businesses looking for
a cheaper, more effective way to operate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Using the Internet is clearly a more efficient way to do
business,'' Harris said. ``We're substituting traditional
businesses that require heavy capital investment for a distribution
system that doesn't require all these stores.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris said he was surprised by the breadth of products for sale
on the Net. While initial studies pegged CDs and books as the kinds
of items people would want to buy online, Harris said the study
shows that almost every product from cars to air conditioners can
find a home on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that there's so many different things being sold on
the Web makes you think (e-commerce) will become a good chunk of
the economy,'' Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   The popularity of doing business on the Web also is reflected in
the sales of products that make the Internet run. Things such as
routers and switches, which are the plumbing of the Internet,
accounted for almost $115 billion in sales, the study found. This
is the arena where Cisco plays, along with companies like Nortel
Networks and Lucent Technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Although the $300 billion revenue figure is substantial, some
analysts said the study bears out what everybody has been saying _
that the Internet is a huge economic engine.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Page, who follows e-commerce for the Strategis Group in
Washington, D.C., said business-to-business e-commerce and the
sales of Internet products such as routers are at the front of the
train.
</P>
<P>
   ``What drives it is a lot of the cost savings,'' Page said. ``If
companies can automate, they can have fewer employees and do things
more cheaply. Everything can be done online, and it's a huge cost
savings.''
</P>
<P>
   Don Listwin, Cisco's executive vice president, said the company
funded the study so that it could determine the scope and value of
business on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Listwin said Cisco also will use the findings to craft business
models for companies that want to participate in the Internet
economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies that change their business model and use the
Internet can get leverage from a new way of doing business and
drive the productivity up,'' Listwin said.
</P>
<P>
   He pointed to the increased productivity of employees who work
for firms with Internet-related revenues as a catalyst for more
companies getting on the Web. The study found that average revenue
per Internet employee is $250,000 compared with $160,000 per
non-Internet employees.

AN ARTS COLONY TURNS UP THE ESTHETICS FOR ITS 100TH  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 13) 
</HEADLINE>

 Ann Wilson Lloyd's most recent article for Arts &AMP; Leisure was about
Tony Oursler's installations at the new Massachusetts Museum of
Contemporary Art.  
 By ANN WILSON LLOYD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVINCETOWN, Mass. _ There is something about Provincetown that
makes you want to buy a purple smock, rent a studio and give mad
parties on battered wharves,'' wrote Eleanor Early in her 1936
travel guide, ``And This Is Cape Cod!''
</P>
<P>
   Henry Geldzahler, a former curator of the Metropolitan Museum of
Art in New York, saw it differently. ``There's something called
genius loci that New York and Berlin have as places of energy,'' he
said during a visit here in 1991. ``But Provincetown has it in a
different way. Provincetown is where you calm down, and your
feelings and thoughts become conducive to making poetry and
painting.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether they come to party or to produce, diverse artistic types
still succumb to Provincetown's natural beauty and mystique. This
summer, Provincetown marks its centennial year as an art colony.
</P>
<P>
   The American Impressionist Charles W. Hawthorne arrived here in
1899 to set up the town's first summer art school. Soon after,
plein-air classes of students clad in Victorian summer white
mingled with the town's Portuguese fishermen.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly half a century later, Hans Hofmann's overflowing indoor
classes brought modernism to this outpost, where, despite Hofmann's
nearly indecipherable German accent, his formal dictate of ``push
and pull'' found its way into art history's lexicon. While
charismatic teachers no longer attract artists here, something
does.
</P>
<P>
   The town's artistic-magnetic pull is reaching a kind of harmonic
convergence this summer, with special exhibitions and events
ranging from the purple-smock historic to madcap cutting edge.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps falling in with Geldzahler's more contemplative take on
Provincetown, the filmmaker John Waters says he does much of his
scriptwriting while here. For the last 35 summers, Provincetown has
been a kind of antidote to Baltimore, where Waters lives.
</P>
<P>
   His film settings may never leave Baltimore, his hometown, he
said in a recent telephone interview from there, ``but somebody in
them might run away to Provincetown.'' It was, after all,
Provincetown's bohemian streak that helped begin Waters's career.
``In the beginning, I used to show my films in church basements
there,'' he said. ``It's the first place they caught on, outside
New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Waters will be honored for his long involvement in the summer
arts colony next weekend, when the First Provincetown International
Film Festival presents him with its Filmmaker on the Edge Award.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the festival presents the first screening of a
re-released, director's cut of his 1974 film ``Female Trouble,''
starring Divine, his prima femme protege. ``This is my favorite
film,'' Waters said. ``I always thought it was the best vehicle for
Divine's extreme beauty and my mental illness. Real fans like that
one the best, and it's been unavailable for quite some time.''
</P>
<P>
   In conjunction with the film festival, a show of Waters's
photographs at the Albert Merola Gallery will be on view through
July 1. These often lined, blurry works are assemblages of borrowed
cinematic images that Waters photographs right off the screen:
frames of movies or television shows, bits and pieces of his own
work and that of others. He then re-edits them as stills, often
arranged into configurations aiming for fantasy filmic moments.
</P>
<P>
   ``This work isn't really about photography,'' he explained.
``It's about writing and editing.'' In ``Shocked Divine,'' for
instance, three juxtaposed close-up images of Divine's graphically
emotive face display the short range of her expressive repertory. A
row of color images titled ``Sophia Loren Decapitated,'' shows only
the actress's upper torso, with fill-in-the-blank space where Ms.
Loren's iconic head should be.
</P>
<P>
   Like Waters, the artist Jack Pierson often searches for beauty
in the banal, though his two separate forthcoming Provincetown
shows may take a somewhat different approach. In one, Pierson plans
to show head shots, intact ones, of a handsome adolescent boy.
Multiples of these tight close-ups of the boy's face, rendered in
various color tones, will be installed in a grid format at the
Merola gallery from Aug. 27 through Sept. 9.
</P>
<P>
   In the second show, at the Provincetown Art Association and
Museum (also opening on Aug. 27), ierson will present an
installation of overscale figurative wall paintings from projected
drawings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something I just started trying out in Europe,'' he said.
``The paintings will come from recent drawings I made in
life-drawing sessions at the Provincetown Art Association. I go to
them once a week when I'm here.'' He has been coming to
Provincetown regularly since he was a fellow at the Fine Arts Work
Center here in the early 90s.
</P>
<P>
   Pierson's contemporary twist on figure studies will make nice
bookends to the Art Association and Museum's two consecutive
surveys of early-20th-century Impressionist figurative paintings by
Charles W. Hawthorne, the art colony founder. ``Part I:
Masterpieces in Oil and Watercolor'' opens on Aug. 20, ``Part II:
Local Hawthornes'' on Sept. 24.
</P>
<P>
   Hawthorne's large genre scenes of Provincetown's early seafaring
Portuguese families are particularly appealing. As sensitively
rendered as John Singer Sargent's portraits of the era's gentry,
Hawthorne's working-class subjects exude stoicism and intrepid
spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with Hawthorne, the photographer Paula Horn Kotis, 76,
is a new discovery in Provincetown. Like him, she captured the
timeless human condition in her work, striking photographs taken in
the midcentury decades. Working as a freelance photographer from
New York, Ms. Kotis traveled throughout postwar Europe and Israel,
documenting street life and refugees as normalcy slowly returned.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In the winter of 1948, she accompanied thousands of Holocaust
survivors from British internment camps in Cyprus to the port of
Haifa in northern Israel, to their new lives. The series of
poignant silver-gelatin prints from this journey was shown for the
first time last season in Provincetown at the Schoolhouse Center
Gallery and has since been purchased by a foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kotis's style is reminiscent of that of Henri Cartier
Bresson, who, she says, was a major influence. ``I was making
studio portraits in the 1940s and saw his show at the Met,'' she
said from her winter home in New York. ``I left it saying, `That's
what I want to do.'''
</P>
<P>
   From July 16 through 29, Ms. Kotis will show other vintage
prints from the '40s, '50s and '60s at same gallery. These include
portraits of artist friends like Charlie Parker and James Baldwin;
images of Lower East Side cold-water flats and studios of painters
and sculptors whom she hung around with at the time; street scenes
of Greenwich Village, East Harlem and Spanish Harlem, and similar
shots in Rome, London, Spain and the Canary Islands.
</P>
<P>
   Though she was published early in her career in Mademoiselle,
Vogue and photography journals, Ms. Kotis laid down her camera in
the mid-1960s to raise a family. Her photographs have been stored
in her basement ever since.
</P>
<P>
   While there's plenty of good, serious, historically related art
to see in Provincetown this summer, Susan Baker offers the flip
side in her new book, ``The History of Provincetown.'' This
colorful cartoon book is an irreverent compilation of notably
absurd happenings, past and present.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Baker, a former Fine Arts Work Center fellow cum year-round
artist, dedicates the book to ``those who came, couldn't park, and
left'' and illustrates legendary moments like: ``Jackson Pollock
hurls an easel at Hans Hofmann and screams `I am nature!''' and
``Edmund Wilson sunbathes in a suit.'' She also captures the town's
street theater, in which suburban tourists meet up with
alternative-life-style types in high carnival mode.
</P>
<P>
   In the same vein is Septic Space, the town's only true
underground art scene, run by Provincetown performance artist Jay
Critchley. Critchley programs his former backyard septic tank with
exhibitions in collaboration with DNA Gallery; this year, the site
adds ``Theater in the Ground,'' five evenings of multimedia
performances that will be documented by video on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Critchley's work will also appear in the 14th edition of the
annual journal Provincetown Arts. As a special centennial gift, the
journal has inserted pullout centerfold art designed by Critchley,
a placemat-map spoofing those found in Cape Cod's ubiquitous
lobster shacks.
</P>
<P>
   As for the more literary content of Provincetown Arts, its
editor, Jennifer Liese, says the focus this year is on the art
colony at midcentury, with articles on Weldon Kees, Mary McCarthy
and Forum 49, a legendary series of panels and exhibitions that was
organized by Kees and held at the Provincetown Art Association and
Museum in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   One portentous show in the series presented the works of 50
abstract painters who were little known at the time, among them
Hofmann, Pollock, Mark Rothko and Adolph Gottlieb. Ms. Liese is
organizing a repeat of the exhibition (opening July 2 at the Art
Association and Museum) featuring 25 works selected from the same
roster of artists, with a few paintings from the original 1949
show.
</P>
<P>
   On July 9, a panel will reconsider the weighty topic originally
discussed by Hofmann, Gottlieb, George Biddle and Serge Chermayeff
in 1949: ``What Is an Artist?'' In Provincetown today, it's
anyone's call.

   &UR; Windows 95 Has a Few `Minor' Y2K Issues &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;  &LR; 
Q: A very good friend, extremely knowledgeable about PCs, tells me
that Windows 95 is not Y2K compatible. Any truth to this, or is it
another hoax? If it is true, has Microsoft come up with a fix?
</P>
<P>
   A: Your friend is right. Microsoft insists that Windows 95 is
Y2K compliant except for some ``minor issues.'' I don't like the
sound of that.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, certain system files in English-language versions
of Windows 95 are going to have problems recognizing the year 2000.
But Microsoft, to its credit, has taken responsibility for the
situation and has made free upgrade software available. You can
download it and also can learn all about the Y2K problem by going
to &LR;  www.microsoft.com/year2000. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: Regarding your column's ongoing discussion of connection
speeds, I thought I'd pass this on. I use a Motorola ModemSurfer
56K to connect to my Internet service provider, Pac Bell. When they
went to V-90, I took advantage of Motorola's free software upgrade.
Where I had been connecting regularly at 46,000 bps, I now normally
hook up at 115,200. What a difference!
</P>
<P>
   A: Sorry to spoil your day, but you're still getting around 46K,
which is a typical speed on a 56K line. V-90 is just a standard
that unites what had been two different ways of delivering 56K. The
115,200 you think you're getting is actually the throughput between
the modem and the computer. To get an accurate speed reading, you
may have to reset the dip switches on the modem so that they
recognize the new V-90 software. You also might try installing an
updated modem driver, which you can probably download from
Motorola's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: Has anyone ever investigated the relative costs of various
types of printers? My inkjet was cheap to buy and the cartridges
aren't too expensive, but they constantly need changing. Would a
laser printer cost less per page to use?
</P>
<P>
   A: Comparing costs of laser printers and inkjets is difficult
for a couple of reasons. All inkjets now are capable of printing in
color, while consumer-level laser printers still print only in
black and white. To get a color-capable laser printer you must
spend at least $2,000, while inkjets start at less than $200. Laser
printers that only print in black can be had for under $400.
</P>
<P>
   Just for the sake of filling up this column, let's do some
comparisons, with numbers supplied by Hewlett-Packard, which makes
both inkjets and lasers. For printing only in black, cost-per-page
for a typical laser printer is about 2 cents. For an inkjet, it's
2.5 to 3 cents. When you go to full color, both the inkjet and
laser printer cost 6 to 8 cents per page, depending on the model.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is that for everyday printing, which
increasingly involves color, an inkjet is probably your best bet.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
TRANSLATION UPDATE: &QL; 
My last column featured a discussion of software designed to
translate English to foreign languages. A reader needed it in order
to send e-mail to a cousin in Italy. It turns out that you don't
need to buy software to get the job done. AltaVista, the Internet
search engine, has a free online translation feature at
 &LR; babelfish.altavista.com &LR;   &LR; /cgi-bin/translate?  &LR; (Be sure to include
the question mark at the end.) It lets you instantly translate
English into French, Italian, German, Spanish or Portuguese, as
well as changing those languages into English. You just enter your
text and hit the Translate key. When the translation pops up, you
can copy and paste it into an e-mail message. Not too shabby.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
TIP OF THE WEEK
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR;  Working at a computer can ruin your eyes, your back and your
arms. But by following a few ergonomic principles, you and your PC
can have a healthy relationship. Try not to have direct light
either in front of or behind your monitor _ light from the side is
better. Place the monitor so that your eyes are level with the top
of the screen. And make sure your keyboard is at a height that lets
you type with your lower arms parallel to the floor. Typing uphill
is bad.

THE WARMING OF A LUCID INTELLECT: BOULEZ AT 74  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 13) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   By the 1950s, Pierre Boulez's reputation as a cutting-edge
modernist composer and imposing musical intellect was already
secure. During the next decade he also emerged as an orchestra
conductor of probing insight and technical finesse, particularly in
the French Impressionist repertory.
</P>
<P>
   Yet back then, the restraint in his interpretations could
sometimes seem cool. Over the years, as he continued to explore the
standard repertory, his performances took on a greater pliancy and
warmth, qualities that were especially evident in two remarkable
programs of Ravel and Debussy that he presented with the superb
Cleveland Orchestra last month at Carnegie Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Boulez's development as a major musician of our
time has been well documented on disk. Now 74, he has
understandably begun to cut back his conducting commitments. But he
continues his work in the recording studio. Three important
releases on Deutsche Grammophon, the label with which he has been
most closely associated of late, present Boulez as conductor and
composer.
</P>
<P>
   The first includes the two Ravel works for piano and orchestra
with Krystian Zimerman as soloist and the London Symphony
Orchestra, as well as the orchestral version of the piano piece
``Valse Nobles et Sentimentales'' (289 449 213-2; CD); the second
offers Mahler's Symphony No. 1 with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra
(289 459 610-2; CD). &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Finally, as part of Deutsche Grammophon's series 20/21: The
Music of Our Time, Boulez conducts the Ensemble Intercontemporain
in his ``Repons,'' a major composition here captured in an
exhilarating performance (289 457 605-2).
</P>
<P>
   Ravel's Concerto in G has too easily been taken for a
Gershwinesque work with brilliant piano writing and impishly clever
orchestration, right from the crack-of-the-whip effect that gets
the piece going. Boulez and Zimerman will make you forget such
notions. From the opening measures, it's not Ravel's excitement
over 1920s jazz but his bracing deployment of bitonal harmony
(shades of Stravinsky's ``Petrouchka'') that comes through. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Zimerman's clean, spindly articulation of the whirling piano
figurations emphasizes the clashing tonalities and makes the
passage seem far more than decorative, even as the solo flute and,
later, brassy trumpet dance blithely above it.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the performance lacks a jazzy touch. Zimerman's way
with the sultry solo theme that creeps in and Boulez's shaping of
that tune when the orchestra takes it over transport us momentarily
to a mellow blues club. But both musicians are more concerned with
making the shifting rhythms incisive and bringing out the pungency
of the harmony.
</P>
<P>
   The tranquil second movement, which begins with a long piano
solo, a wistful spinning melody over a slow waltz accompaniment,
has an affecting reserve as played by Zimerman and echoed by Boulez
when the orchestra enters. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; In the finale Zimerman plays the toccatalike piano part with
both driving intensity and a sense of fun. Still, there is
something eerie, and rightly so, in the way Boulez encourages the
weird lines of orchestral soloists to intrude. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Though the performance has warmth and adventure, the concerto
has never sounded less like a piece for pops orchestras, where you
too often hear it.
</P>
<P>
   Ravel wrote the Concerto for the Left Hand during 1930 and 1931
on commission from the Austrian pianist Paul Wittgenstein, who had
lost his right arm in action during World War I. That Wittgenstein
had staunchly conservative tastes was unfortunate, since the only
way he could continue his career was to commission works for left
hand alone. &UR;  &LR;  Prokofiev, Britten and others answered his call. But
Wittgenstein disliked most of what he paid for, including the
Ravel. He declined to play the premiere.
</P>
<P>
   Later he grew to respect the work. But this performance suggests
why he may initially have found it forbiddingly modern. Boulez
makes the grim opening episode for orchestra, with its primordial
grumblings in low strings and accumulating melodic fragments for
contrabassoon and quiet brasses, seem more sinister than the
beginning of Wagner's ``Siegfried.'' &UR;  &LR;  He builds the music to a
harrowing climax until Zimerman pushes the orchestra aside with his
arresting account of the keyboard-spanning piano outburst. The
performance continues to capture the strangeness and ferocity of
the music, while delivering the dreamy bits with elegant restraint.
</P>
<P>
   ``Restraint'' is the operative word for Boulez's performance of
the ``Valses Nobles.'' Yet without being didactic, he also calls
attention to the biting quality in Ravel's harmony. In the
ruminative second waltz, he trusts in the tenderness of the melody
without milking it for sentiment, as so many conductors do. The
third waltz sounds here like music for a children's game. But the
game is deceptively innocent.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   During Boulez's early career he had little sympathy for the
bittersweet late Romanticism of Mahler. He grew to see Mahler as an
authentic master and a role model for dealing with two difficult
problems in composition: how to organize music over long spans of
time and how to fashion disparate musical materials into a coherent
language. &UR;  &LR;  Since then, Boulez's clearheaded performances of the
Mahler symphonies have been highly respected, and the new recording
of the First Symphony is especially fine.
</P>
<P>
   This symphony is often called the ``Titan,'' a title many
conductors take as permission to turn it into an overbearing,
emotive mess. But under Boulez the work's titanic nature is heard
in the boldness of Mahler's musical thinking and the haunting way
the composer pits texturally complex passages against guileless
evocations of folk song and dance.
</P>
<P>
   The famous opening of the first movement, with its eerie
sustained notes for high strings in harmonics, sounds transformed
here. The sustained tones seem not just some background color to
create a sense of nature's awakening but an upfront musical element
to set the listener on alert. &UR;  &LR;  Boulez captures the folkloric
quality of the symphony's melodic materials, while never letting it
take over.
</P>
<P>
   The third movement, properly, sounds like some heavy-footed
country dance, or a farmer's ambling ox-cart. Yet the soft-spoken
insistence and rhythmic integrity in the playing focus the ear on
musical matters. After all, no real ox-cart moves with such
steadiness. The tumultuous finale, which can sound bombastic, is
riveting because Boulez and the Chicago Symphony bring uncanny
clarity to the intertwining contrapuntal lines.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Boulez is a composer who also conducts, not a
conductor who also composes. So for him, and for posterity, the
most important of these new recordings is that of his own
``Repons.''
</P>
<P>
   The work's title refers to the responsorial aspect of Gregorian
chant, in which a solo voice is answered by a responding choir.
This simple call-and-response technique is found in lots of music,
including gospel singing and big-band jazz. &UR;  &LR;  Boulez adds a spatial
dimension here. ``Repons'' was written for a specific place (the
performance hall at Ircam, the music research institute founded by
Boulez at the Pompidou Center in Paris) and specific performers
(the Ensemble Intercontemporain, which Boulez directs).
</P>
<P>
   He worked for three years on ``Repons,'' revising and expanding
it until 1984, when the version heard here was first performed.
Three separate entities were involved in the performance: six
soloists, who played cimbalom, piano, xylophone and other
percussion instruments; an instrumental ensemble of 24 musicians,
and an electroacoustic system with a computer that transformed and
spatialized the sound, played through six loudspeakers. &UR;  &LR;  The
ensemble and conductor were placed in the center of the hall,
surrounded by the audience. The soloists and speakers were placed
equidistantly along the walls.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, a recording cannot recreate the effect of sitting
among these conversing musical forces. But the new disk gives a
good sense of what it was like: you hear xylophone riffs, for
example, bounce from one speaker to another.
</P>
<P>
   Like all of Boulez's music, this 42-minute score is intensely
complex. But if you rid yourself of concern for the methods used to
pick the pitches and listen for color, shape, character and
darting, skittish rhythmic writing, the music is hard to resist. &UR;  &LR; 
There are delicate and stunning instrumental effects, wondrous
masses of sound that get manipulated like children's blocks, and
the constant edge-of-the-seat drama that comes from the interplay
between the live performers and the computerized transformations of
what they play.
</P>
<P>
   The recording also includes a somewhat similarly conceived work,
the brilliant ``Dialogue de l'Ombre Double,'' in which a solo
clarinetist, the virtuosic Alain Damiens, plays a series of six
``strophes,'' interspersed with short movements prerecorded by
Damiens, in which the music is again spatialized.
</P>
<P>
   Listeners who are naturally curious about the Debussy and Mahler
but reticent about ``Repons'' should check out this disk. They may
find the music more engrossing than they might have imagined. And
the same encompassing musical mind is at work.

TIPS HELP POLICE SEARCH FOR `THE MOST WANTED MAN IN TEXAS' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Attn: Ky.) 
 
By ERIC HANSON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Law enforcement officials have received dozens of tips
regarding the search for an elusive drifter suspected of six
slayings in Texas and Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have gotten a lot of information from the public, which is
what we really wanted,'' said Don K. Clark, special agent in charge
of the Houston FBI.
</P>
<P>
   A command center at Houston FBI headquarters has been set up to
coordinate the efforts of numerous state, local and federal
officers searching for Rafael Resendez-Ramirez, who is wanted in a
string of brutal slayings dating to the summer of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``As of early this morning, we had received approximately 30
calls and it has probably doubled since that time,'' Clark said
Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   To help generate more leads, authorities have increased reward
money from $50,000 to $60,000 for information leading to his
arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Clark said the calls vary widely with some offering only a few
vague hints, while others provide detailed leads. He said all
information is important.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes a one- or two-word call may just very well be the
bit of information it takes to get us to the location (of the
killer),'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement agencies from across Texas have launched an
effort to find Resendez-Ramirez, who is a suspect in five killings
in Texas and one in Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now he's the most wanted man in Texas,'' said DPS
Director Col. Dudley L. Thomas. ``We need to hear from anyone who
might have information that could lead us to him.''
</P>
<P>
   The DPS has contributed eight Texas Rangers and three Special
Crime Service investigators to the search.
</P>
<P>
   Resendez-Ramirez is described as 38 years old, 5 feet 7 inches
tall and weighing about 150 pounds. He is said to have black hair
and brown eyes and his left forearm has the tattoo of a snake. He
has altered his appearance in the past with wigs and glasses.
</P>
<P>
   Clark said Resendez-Ramirez has been linked by evidence to all
five Texas crimes, but he declined to discuss details about that
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Police have said fingerprints belonging to Resendez-Ramirez have
been found in connection with slayings in West University Place, an
enclave of Houston, and Schulenburg, which is about 90 miles west
of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Resendez-Ramirez also is considered a suspect in a killing in
southwest Houston, where the body of Noemi Dominguez, 26, was found
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   She died from a blow to the head, and her white 1993 Honda Civic
with license number JJH 57N was stolen. The car is missing.
</P>
<P>
   Clark said FBI specialists in Washington, D.C., and Houston are
developing a psychological profile of the killer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can use this for lead information as to where we think this
person may go or what we think this person might do,'' Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   Clark said investigators believe Resendez-Ramirez is probably a
transient without any roots to any particular location.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we don't know a lot else about him personally at this
point. We're hoping that as information comes in we can develop a
truer picture,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   All of the slayings, including the one in Kentucky, happened
near railroad tracks and all the victims were beaten to death.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators believe the killer is moving about the state by
hopping freight trains. In three of the cases, he has stolen
vehicles belonging to the victims. Two of those vehicles have been
recovered in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   The first case occurred Dec. 17, when the body of Dr. Claudia
Benton, 39, was found in her West University Place home just a few
blocks from railroad tracks.
</P>
<P>
   She had been beaten and stabbed to death and sexually assaulted.
Her stolen Jeep Cherokee was found abandoned in San Antonio with
Resendez-Ramirez's fingerprint in the vehicle, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   In March, he was indicted on a charge of burglary in the case.
This charge led to the federal count against Resendez-Ramirez,
allowing the FBI to search for him anywhere in the country, Clark
said.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities have linked Resendez-Ramirez to the deaths of the
Rev. Norman ``Skip'' Sirnic, 46, and his wife, Karen, 47. They were
found beaten to death with a sledgehammer in the parsonage behind
the Weimar United Church of Christ in Colorado County after they
did not show up for services May 2.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; About three weeks later, investigators said evidence found in
the Sirnics' home linked Resendez-Ramirez to the Benton case.
Authorities have declined to release specific details.
</P>
<P>
   The Sirnics' stolen pickup was found May 28 by police in San
Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   One week later, a relative found the body of Josephine Konvicka,
73, in her house near Schulenburg in Fayette County, just 3 1/2
miles from the Sirnics' home.
</P>
<P>
   Konvicka had been beaten to death, and the killer tried to steal
her car but could not locate the keys. Resendez-Ramirez's
fingerprints were found in her home and also near railroad tracks.
</P>
<P>
   The Lexington victim was University of Kentucky student
Christopher Maier, 21. He was beaten to death and his girlfriend
assaulted as they walked along railroad tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Following that slaying, the woman was able to provide
investigators a description of her attacker that matches the
description of Resendez-Ramirez.
</P>
<P>
   Police from Kentucky have been in Houston consulting with local
authorities. No charges have yet been filed in connection with the
Kentucky case, which occurred Aug. 29, 1997.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Those seeking to provide information on Resendez-Ramirez's
whereabouts can call the FBI Command Center at 713-479-6325 or
713-693-5000.
</P>

MICROSOFT TRIAL WITNESS UNDERGOES TOUGH CROSS-EXAMINATION  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVE LOHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Under sharp questioning by a Microsoft lawyer, an
IBM executive conceded Wednesday that none of the Microsoft
contract proposals he read had stated that IBM must stop shipping
its OS/2 operating system to get a favorable price for Windows,
Microsoft's competing operating system.
</P>
<P>
   But Garry Norris of the International Business Machines Corp.
testified that despite the absence of a clear-cut requirement that
IBM drop its operating system, the many sales and promotion steps
called for in the Microsoft proposal would have had the ``effect of
killing OS/2 in the marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   The grudging concession and counterattack came during a day of
clipped, combative exchanges at the Microsoft antitrust trial
between Norris and Richard Pepperman, a lawyer representing the
Microsoft Corp..
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is trying to battle back after two days of compelling
testimony by Norris, who handled relations between Microsoft and
IBM's personal computer division from 1995 to 1997. Norris, the
first representative of a PC maker to appear as a government
witness, has contended that Microsoft repeatedly tried to put
pressure on IBM to favor Microsoft software and exclude rival
offerings _ a central theme in the sweeping antitrust suit against
Microsoft brought by the Justice Department and 19 states.
</P>
<P>
   The cross-examination by Microsoft was a point-by-point assault
on the testimony of Norris, seeking to refute or at least cast
doubt on his allegations. Microsoft's lawyers introduced evidence,
including internal IBM E-mail, that sought to portray the company's
relations with IBM as the capitalist arm-wrestling of two powerful
companies _ not as Microsoft playing a bullying monopolist. One IBM
memo, for example, said that Microsoft feared that IBM was ``out to
`annihilate' Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   Again and again, Microsoft sought to focus the court's attention
on the fact that it did not exclude IBM from shipping competing
operating systems, office productivity software or Internet
browsers _ all subjects of testimony by Norris.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were no exclusive contracts, just a lot of hard
bargaining by both companies,'' said William H. Neukom, general
counsel of Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   There were no exclusive contracts, according to the government,
because IBM refused to accept Microsoft's proposals _ proposals not
made in its written contract offers but verbally in meetings, which
Norris attended and recorded in handwritten notes.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's cross-examination, the government insists, did
little to undermine the key point Norris vividly detailed _ that
Microsoft used its industry-standard Windows operating system to
try to prod IBM to favor Microsoft software over products of
rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft did link how IBM was treated to whether IBM shipped
competing products, and that is the antitrust issue,'' said David
Boies, lead trial lawyer for the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   In this nonjury trial, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson will be the
arbiter of how successful Microsoft has been in raising doubts
about Norris' testimony. The judge has shown some impatience with
Pepperman, cutting off some of his questions. In a private meeting
with lawyers Tuesday afternoon, Jackson, according to a transcript,
told Pepperman, ``I'm not sure how much progress you have made so
far, but we will leave that aside.''
</P>
<P>
   Norris, who finished his three days on the stand Wednesday
afternoon, has proved to be a firm and unflappable witness. He
often conceded on specific questions, but still went on to make his
point.
</P>
<P>
   In one typical exchange, Pepperman said Microsoft had never
refused to grant IBM a license for Windows if IBM shipped
Netscape's Navigator browser _ a rival to Microsoft's Internet
Explorer _ on its PC's. True, Norris replied, but Microsoft
executives did tell him that shipping Netscape's product would have
``MDA repercussions'' _ a reference to a marketing development
agreement, which links the price of Windows to marketing
commitments by a PC maker.
</P>
<P>
   Repeatedly, Pepperman tried to undercut the allegation by Norris
that Microsoft had offered IBM a lower price for Windows if it
stopped shipping competing software. For example, he asked Norris
to find anywhere in the written contract proposals the requirement
that to receive a lower Windows price IBM was required to ``drop or
eliminate OS/2'' _ a phrase Norris had used to describe the
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Norris said that it was not in those precise words. Chiding the
Microsoft lawyer, Norris said that the phrase he used in his court
testimony, though not always in a pretrial deposition last month,
was ``reduce, drop or eliminate OS/2.''
</P>
<P>
   Pepperman countered, ``So is it your testimony that the `drop or
eliminate' are inaccurate?''
</P>
<P>
   Norris replied in a tone tinged with anger, ``I am not changing
my testimony.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft also tried to cast doubt about the accuracy of the
handwritten notes of Norris _ crucial evidence in the case. One
piece of IBM E-mail described a meeting at which Norris said
Microsoft offered IBM price discounts and other benefits if it
stopped shipping Netscape's browser and other competing products.
But e-mail on March 31, 1997, from Dean Dubinsky, another IBM
executive who attended the meeting, to Norris and his boss, William
(Ozzie) Osborne, did not mention the Microsoft inducement to
exclude rival products.
</P>
<P>
   After receiving the e-mail, Norris explained that he called
Dubinsky, who said he intentionally left the sensitive proposals
out of the e-mail. ``I'll let you and Ozzie handle that,'' Norris
recalled Dubinksy telling him. IBM, Norris testified, refused to
agree to the exclusive deal with Microsoft. &QL;

 _ SF CHRON   This Software Doesn't Live Up to Its Name 
 &HT;     By Henry Norr 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
As sophisticated as today's software may be, it can also be
extraordinarily stupid. Consider my first experience with Corel's
new WordPerfect Office 2000.
<P>
   When I restarted my PC after installing the new suite, I found
seven new inscrutable mini-icons in my ``system tray,'' the area on
the right side of the ``taskbar'' at the bottom of the Windows
desktop. The first one, I discovered, activated DAD, or Desktop
Application Director, a launching utility that's Corel's answer to
MOM, the Microsoft Office Manager. DAD presented me with a long
list of templates for various tasks. On a whim, I chose to try one
called ``Grade Schedule,'' a high-tech equivalent to the
time-honored teacher's grade book.
</P>
<P>
   I entered two names and a handful of grades into the file. Then
I clicked on a button labeled ``Sort the Student Names.'' Instead
of doing so, WordPerfect put up a dialog instructing me to select
the names to be sorted. I highlighted the two names and clicked the
button again. This time the program told me I'd exceeded its
32-kilobyte ``sort limit'' and should select a subset.
</P>
<P>
   Undaunted, I added a third name, selected all three, and again
clicked the Sort button. This time the program told me it was
``examining records'' _ a good sign, I thought. But it didn't stop
at three. In fact, in the blink of an eye the running total
presented in the dialog box had passed 20,000. At that point I
clicked Cancel.
</P>
<P>
   My three names still weren't sorted.

 _ SF CHRON   Upgrade to WordPerfect Is Polished, Powerful 
 &HT;     By Henry Norr 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Unless your computer career dates back to DOS days, you may not
realize that WordPerfect once dominated the word processing market
as surely as Microsoft does today.
<P>
   The program fell behind when the world moved to Windows, and in
just a few years it went from market leader to distant also-ran.
The company that originally created it is long gone, and the
product itself has been sold twice.
</P>
<P>
   But WordPerfect retains a loyal following, and its current
owner, Corel Corp. of Ottawa, has worked hard to keep it alive and
well even as Microsoft's market share has mounted. To compete with
Microsoft's multiprogram Office, Corel too has assembled a suite of
applications under the WordPerfect Office name. It includes the
Quattro Pro spreadsheet; a presentation program called, simply,
Corel Presentations; a personal information manager called
CorelCentral; and, in the high-end ``Professional Edition'' of the
suite, a corporate-grade database program called Paradox.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Corel delivered a major upgrade to the package under
a not-so-original name, WordPerfect Office 2000. The core
applications have all been improved, CorelCentral has had a
complete redesign (badly needed, but largely successful), and Corel
has added Trellix 2, a capable Web-page creation program. Both the
Professional Edition and a less-expensive Voice-Powered Edition
also come with Dragon Naturally Speaking 3.0, a top-notch
speech-recognition program from Dragon Software, and a good-quality
microphone to use with it.
</P>
<P>
   Full retail pricing ranges from $399 to $499, but upgrades are
only $109 to $209. Corel is even more liberal than Microsoft in
determining who's eligible for the discount. Basically, if you own
any other productivity software, you can get WordPerfect Office for
considerably less than any version of the Microsoft suite.
</P>
<P>
   System requirements are also a little less stringent than
Microsoft's, at least if you don't plan to use the
speech-recognition software. All versions require Windows 95, 98 or
NT 4.0, at least 16 megabytes of RAM (32 megabytes recommended),
and lots of disk space _ a bare minimum of 100 megabytes, but 280
megabytes for a typical installation. What you don't need,
according to Corel, is a Pentium: The suite is supposed to work on
any system with a 486 chip running at 66 megahertz or more. (I
didn't test it on a 486.)
</P>
<P>
   If you do want to use the bundled Dragon software, you'll need
more of everything _ RAM, disk space and processing power.
</P>
<P>
   I gave WordPerfect Office 2000 a brief tryout on my PC, and
mostly I liked what I saw. The core applications are all polished
and powerful, and I liked both Trellix 2 and the redesigned
CorelCentral a lot.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the various programs aren't nearly as well
integrated and consistent as Microsoft's, and I ran into a number
of glitches in this suite, too. Some of them, like finding only one
font available in WordPerfect, probably reflect my unfamiliarity
with the program more than any intrinsic deficiencies. But I also
encountered some screen redraw glitches (a problem I remember
plaguing WordPerfect more than a decade ago), and when I was
writing this story in the program, it mysteriously stopped being
able to save, posting a dialog that said only ``A required resource
was'' _ I had to switch back to Microsoft Word to finish the
article.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, I didn't see anything in the new Corel suite
compelling enough to get many users of Microsoft Office to change
horses. But if you already use an earlier version of WordPerfect,
you can't afford Microsoft's prices, or you just prefer to work in
a Microsoft-free environment, WordPerfect Office 2000 is a very
viable alternative.

 _ SF CHRON  
 Versatile Microsoft Office 2000  &HT;     By Henry Norr 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
With Microsoft Office now controlling roughly 90 percent of the
market for business ``productivity'' software, most of today's
office workers also are Office workers.
<P>
   So when Office changes, it matters. It's almost as if carpenters
the world over were about to see their hammers, saws and
screwdrivers replaced by ``new and improved'' tools.
</P>
<P>
   That's especially true of the latest version, Office 2000, which
is slated to hit retail shelves today. It deliberately was designed
to promote new ways of working, ways Bill Gates and his colleagues
consider appropriate for the Internet age.
</P>
<P>
   For those who work in companies ready to fully embrace
Microsoft's vision, Office 2000 is an impressive advance. For the
rest of us _ including, I'd guess, most home and small-office users
_ many of the biggest changes in Office 2000 are simply irrelevant.
But the package still offers a variety of welcome improvements,
along with some annoying problems.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
_The Basics. Four versions of Office 2000 are available, with
different sets of additional applications accompanying the common
core: Microsoft Word, the word processor; Excel, the
number-crunching tool; Outlook, which serves as e-mail client,
calendar and contact database; and the Internet Explorer Web
browser.
</P>
<P>
   Retail prices for new users range from $499 to $799. You
probably won't have to pay that much, though, no matter what
version you want, because almost everyone who owns a PC capable of
running Office 2000 qualifies for upgrade pricing. That starts at
$249, and if you're upgrading from an earlier version of Microsoft
Office as opposed to competing products, you're probably eligible
for a $40 or $50 rebate.
</P>
<P>
   To run the new software, you need Windows 95 or 98 or NT 4.0
with Service Pack 3 or later. (There won't be a Mac version of
Office 2000, according to Microsoft, but Mac owners can look
forward to their own new Office release in another year or so.)
Hardware requirements include at least a 75-MHz Pentium or
equivalent (166 MHz required for PhotoDraw, the new graphics
program included in the Premium version).
</P>
<P>
   RAM requirements are complicated, depending on which version you
install and how many programs you want to keep open simultaneously,
but in general, I wouldn't bother with Office 2000 unless you have
at least 32 megabytes of memory. Disk-space requirements range from
nearly 200 megabytes for a minimal installation to more than 500
megabytes for the full Premium package. (Details are at
 &LR; www.microsoft.com/office/features &LR;   &LR; /ofc2000tour/Sysreqs.htm.) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_Take it to the Net. The single-most-important advance in Office
2000 is that each of its applications lets you save any document as
a Web page, without losing the ability to re-edit it later in
Office with all features intact. Previous versions let you save
some files in the Web's HTML format, but fewer Office formatting
options were preserved, and such documents ceased to be editable in
Office without a lot of extra work.
</P>
<P>
   The translation process is still far from perfect, mainly
because HTML can't handle all the formatting options the Office
applications offer. Cosmetic glitches appeared in many of the
documents I created to test this feature. If you're aiming to
create cool Web pages, you'll still want a tool designed expressly
for that purpose _ either Microsoft FrontPage, which is included in
the Premium version of Office, or one of the many alternatives from
other companies.
</P>
<P>
   But the new translation feature does preserve the content and
most formatting of Office documents. That solves a couple of
important problems: Anyone using any Web browser can read such
documents, even if they've never owned a previous version of Office
or anything like it. And if you later want to make changes to the
document, you don't have to start all over formatting it in Office.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the new approach creates some new issues,
over and above the cosmetic problems. The biggest is that documents
saved as Web pages are broken up into numerous separate files and
folders that you _ and anyone to whom you want to send the document
_ have to keep together.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid that hassle, you can instead save your documents in the
proprietary Office formats (Word, Excel, etc.). Because those
formats haven't changed (except in the case of Access), the files
will be readable, minus a few new formatting options, by anyone
with Office 97 for Windows, Office 98 for Mac, or any other
software that can read Office 97 formats.
</P>
<P>
   Or you can adopt the approach Microsoft is pushing: Save your
files as Web pages and share them via the Internet or your
organization's internal intranet. You can do that with any Web
server and browser, but Office 2000 provides lots of extra features
and conveniences for those who use Microsoft's own Web server
software (part of Windows NT Server) together with the company's
Internet Explorer browser.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if your organization has an NT server and adds some
extra software that comes with Office 2000 (``Office Server
Extensions''), you can save a document directly to the server from
the Office applications just as if it were on your own hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   Colleagues given the appropriate level of access to the server
then can attach comments to the file and respond to others'
observations directly from their browser. If they're using Internet
Explorer and still more extra Microsoft software is running on the
server, they can edit the contents of the file without leaving
their browser. You can even arrange to be notified automatically
via e-mail when comments are posted or changes made to files you're
interested in.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_Other enhancements. Even if you or your boss isn't quite ready to
adopt this kind of ``digital nervous system,'' as Bill Gates calls
it, Office users still will find lots to appreciate in the new
version.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, Office 2000 applications are now, like Office 98
programs on the Mac, ``self-repairing'': If a critical file is
missing or damaged, it's supposed to be replaced automatically,
without making the user deal with cryptic error messages. If you
suspect additional problems, a new ``Detect and Repair'' command is
supposed to deal with them.
</P>
<P>
   These are nice ideas, and they should eliminate a lot of
time-wasting support calls and reinstallations. I should note,
however, that in my testing, I regularly encountered a message
about a ``compile error in hidden module: modMain,'' and even the
Detect and Repair feature didn't fix it.
</P>
<P>
   The user interfaces in the Office applications haven't changed
drastically, so you shouldn't have any trouble learning them. But
Microsoft did try to make them easier to use by simplifying dialog
boxes and shortening menus. There's also a new feature called
``adaptive menus,'' which takes options you never use off the
menus. (The downside: You can go crazy looking for a command you
 &LR; know  &LR; used to be there. Fortunately, you can shut off this
feature.)
</P>
<P>
   You'll also find some nice new conveniences in all of the
applications. Open and Save dialogs have been redesigned to show
more information and make it easier to jump to the files and
folders you use most often. The clipboard, which used to hold only
one item at a time, now stores up to 12, any of which you can paste
by clicking on the corresponding icon. A new Send To command on the
File menu enables you to e-mail the document you're working on
without leaving your application.
</P>
<P>
   In the individual programs, you'll find countless more
refinements. In Word, for example, you now can click anywhere on
the page and start typing without having to fuss with margin
settings or enter returns and spaces to get where you want, and you
can find and select synonyms from Word's thesaurus directly from
the right-click pop-up menu. Excel's PivoTables, a powerful but
confusing data-analysis feature, now are much easier to use.
PowerPoint text automatically shrinks to fit on your slides, and
numbered bullet points automatically are renumbered when you change
their order.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_Bottom line. Altogether, Office 2000, whichever version you
choose, is an amazingly rich software tool kit _ there's not a lot
you can't do with it, and the new features generally make doing so
 &LR; it easier to use than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, though, I'm not convinced that the package is
really ready for release. In just a couple of weeks of testing,
I've already had more crashes, freezes, anomalies (such as blank
menus) and error messages than I saw in years of work with Office
97 and Office 95. Reviewers in the trade magazines report few such
problems, so maybe there's just something wrong with the two PCs
(notebook and desktop) I tested on, but I'm suspicious.
</P>
<P>
   One other note: If you don't have any use for the advanced
Web-related features and you mainly use Word, you might want to
wait for a new release of Microsoft Works scheduled for later this
year. It will include Word 2000, plus basic spreadsheet, database
and graphics features, and it undoubtedly will cost less than any
version of Office.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, by then Microsoft might have the bugs fixed.

CHINA PUSHES ITS BID TO MODIFY KOSOVO PEACE PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JUDITH MILLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ China tried Wednesday into the late evening to
secure the Security Council's agreement on changes in the Kosovo
peace plan.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese representative, Shen Guofang, told reporters that
China would ``find it difficult to support'' the resolution without
the amendments.
</P>
<P>
   But several diplomats predicted that China, which could veto the
resolution, would not do so.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. representative, A. Peter Burleigh, said the changes
were being considered.
</P>
<P>
   Council members stood by into the night to give their blessing
to the plan negotiated in Cologne.
</P>
<P>
   Council members are eager to act on a resolution as soon as NATO
affirms that Serb troops are beginning to withdraw and the allies
announce that they are suspending its bombing.
</P>
<P>
   With such assurances, the council could then rush to debate and
decide on the resolution, which stipulates that the NATO forces
would go into Kosovo and specified procedures to restore Kosovo.
Russia and China have repeatedly said they would will permit a vote
on the plan only after the bombing had stopped.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time is of the essence,'' Burleigh said.
</P>
<P>
   A Western diplomat said, ``We don't want a military void on the
ground in Kosovo, and we want this plan approved by the council and
wrapped up as fast as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats said NATO wanted to move troops into Kosovo promptly
to be sure that in their withdrawal the Serbian forces did not have
the opportunity to take revenge on ethnic Albanians and that the
Kosovo Liberation Army did not pick fights with the Serbs.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Two special envoys appointed by Secretary-General Kofi Annan to
help in the crisis, Karl Bildt and Eduard Kukan, briefed the
Security Council late Wednesday on preparations for the refugees'
return and rebuilding Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting, Bildt stressed the vast scale and complexity
of the proposed role of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats huddled throughout the day in rooms and corridors,
debating how to satisfy China's demands without substantially
weakening the peace plan. The amendments that China has submitted
would effectively fix a firm 12-month limit on the life of the
Kosovo force, would soften criticism of Yugoslavia and would limit
the circumstances under which NATO-led troops could use military
force to carry out the resolution.
</P>
<P>
   China has consistently maintained that the crisis is an internal
Yugoslav affair. China fears the trend in the United Nations to
intervene in what have long been regarded as the internal affairs
of sovereign states.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, China remains unhappy that the plan calls for
intervention under Chapter 7 of the U.N. Charter, which permits the
use of armed force against an aggressor.
</P>
<P>
   The Dutch representative, Peter van Walsum, who conducted much
of the negotiating with the Chinese on Wednesday, declined to
discuss Beijing's proposals. The text of the plan had been altered
somewhat to accommodate China, van Walsum said, but he added that
the changes did not weaken the tortuously negotiated draft.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday evening, the Gambian representative, Baboucarr-Blaise
Ismaila Jagne, the current Council president, emerged briefly from
the Council chambers to say that members were still debating
China's proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, the Council would authorize the deployment of a
NATO-led force of up to 50,000 troops, as well as an unspecified
number of aid workers and reconstruction experts.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Annan would appoint a civilian administration to take over
the day-to-day operation of the province, establish a high degree
of autonomy from the rest of Yugoslavia and prepare for eventual
elections.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Kosovo looks set to become a virtual U.N.
protectorate for a while, just as Namibia was when the United
Nations was preparing it for independence from South Africa.

 Governor Finally Fills 2 PUC Vacancies  &HT;     By Rebecca Smith 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Governor Gray Davis named a union executive and a
lawyer-turned-entrepreneur yesterday to the state Public Utilities
Commission, one week after he temporarily appointed two members of
his staff to the regulatory agency.
<P>
   The latest appointees, who presumably will serve full six-year
terms with annual salaries of $98,000, are Carl W. Wood, national
representative for the Utility Workers Union of America, and Joel
Z. Hyatt, co-founder of Hyatt Legal Services.
</P>
<P>
   The appointments fill out the five-member PUC panel for the
first time in six months. During this period, the commission has
had to postpone votes on a wide range of important issues.
</P>
<P>
   The pair will attend their first PUC meeting tomorrow although
Wood isn't expected to be sworn in until June 21. To eliminate any
conflict of interest, Wood first must resign his union position and
end his ``union leave'' status with Southern California Edison,
which he joined as an electrician in the utility's nuclear power
division in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Wood is the first appointee with a labor background in more than
two decades. He said yesterday that it would be a ``mistake,
however, to assume that I've been appointed to represent labor's
narrow interests. My constituency is the consumers of the state and
I want to see the commission act in a way that's more responsive to
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Wood, Hyatt is expected to bring a strong consumer focus to
the PUC. Hyatt, who's been a personal friend of Davis for years,
attracted national attention when he became one of the first
attorneys to take advantage of a U.S. Supreme Court decision that
permitted attorneys to advertise their services, beginning in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   Promoted heavily through television ads, the Yale-educated Hyatt
built a network of more than 200 storefronts offering inexpensive
legal services, often at flat fees, to middle-income clients who
make too much money for legal aid services but are too poor for
$150-to-$300-an-hour attorneys. Most of those franchiselike offices
since have been sold to the attorneys managing them.
</P>
<P>
   His successor company, Hyatt Legal Plans, pioneered the concept
of offering legal services to consumers through their employers as
part of benefits plans. For flat monthly fees, more than 1 million
members got full legal services.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I've tried to do is make the legal system work better on
behalf of the people it hasn't served very well,'' Hyatt said
yesterday. ``I'll be bringing a passionate interest in good public
policy to the PUC.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Hyatt ran for the U.S. Senate in Ohio, hoping to occupy
the seat being vacated by his father-in-law, Democratic icon Howard
Metzenbaum. In his only attempt at elective office, he won the
Democratic primary but lost in the general election.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Hyatt and his partners sold Hyatt Legal Plans to
MetLife for an undisclosed sum. Hyatt moved to Atherton to assume a
position as visiting scholar at the Hoover Institution. For the
past year, he has lectured in entrepreneurship at the Stanford
University business school.
</P>
<P>
   Wood and Hyatt have their work cut out for them.
</P>
<P>
   Many important issues are before the PUC, established by
Progressive Republican governor Hiram Johnson in 1911, and
currently under attack as an anachronism in an increasingly
deregulated world that trusts markets to deliver the benefits that
formerly were the purview of regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Wood said he has the strongest grounding in energy issues,
particularly in electric deregulation _ which his union opposed as
contrary to the interest of consumers and utility workers.
</P>
<P>
   Hyatt said he's devoted considerable energy to understanding
telecommunications issues. He feels California should be a leader
in having progressive telecommunications policies ``since we have
Silicon Valley and no one else does.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the PUC was set to vote on one such matter when Davis
temporarily put two staffers on the commission. They delayed a vote
that could affect how much consumers pay for Internet services.
That issue will come back today for reconsideration.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, both  &LR; Wood and Hyatt will face important votes in
coming months about implementation of the state's electric
deregulation plan and changes in the telecommunications industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to make sure that competition actually leads to
well-functioning and effective markets,'' said Hyatt. ``What's best
for consumers, today, may be different than 20 years ago. The
challenge is to figure out the right solutions.''
</P>
<P>
   Wood, 51, lives in San Diego with his wife. A daughter graduated
from the University of California at Santa Cruz last year and a son
graduates this week.
</P>
<P>
   Hyatt, 49, lives in Atherton with his wife and sons, ages 12 and
16.
</P>
<P>
   Both appointments require confirmation by the Senate, which has
a year to take up the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Still up the air is an appointment by Davis to fill the
directorship of the PUC's Office of Ratepayer Advocates.

U.S. PHOTOS SHOW ALTERATIONS AT SUSPECTED SITE OF MASS GRAVE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Photographs taken by U.S. spy satellites seem to
show that Serbian forces dug up the bodies of their victims to hide
evidence of a massacre in Kosovo, the chief Pentagon spokesman said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The official, Kenneth H. Bacon, said the pictures provided cold
scientific evidence to back up the vivid and terrified accounts of
Kosovar refugees that something terrible had occurred at the
village of Izbica.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon had already acknowledged that the Pentagon had heard
reports from refugees that Serbs were trying to conceal the
evidence of massacres.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have any evidence,'' Bacon said. ``Now we do have
some firm evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Recalling that the Pentagon had received reports of killing in
central-western Kosovo as early as April, Bacon displayed a
satellite picture from May 15 of what analysts concluded was a site
that held 143 graves.
</P>
<P>
   Then he displayed a picture taken last Thursday. ``This second
picture shows what appears to have been a bulldozing over this
area,'' he said, pointing to a black splotchy section.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon said the Thursday photo seemed to dovetail with refugees'
accounts and Albanian television reports that Serbian troops had
entered Izbica on the same day and destroyed graves.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were reports that many bodies were exhumed and that
earth-moving equipment or bulldozers could have been used to cover
up the mass grave site,'' Bacon said. ``So this is one example that
we have run across recently that leads us to believe that there is
some evidence supporting the refugee accounts of tampering with
mass grave sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks as if a bulldozer or other earth-moving equipment has
been run over where the individual graves used to be. But we don't
have pictures of bulldozers' running over this site.''
</P>
<P>
   He said refugees had told of having seen exhumed bodies being
carried toward Klina, eight or nine miles away.

CRASH SURVIVOR ARRIVES HOME _ BY LAND

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Four days after surviving the crash of Flight 1420, Richard
Sowers was out of a hospital and ready to return home to Tucson,
Ariz., choosing to travel by train rather than go through another
plane landing.
</P>
<P>
   But just outside Little Rock, Ark., he began suffering
flashbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had completely forgotten about the shaking and the noise,''
he said, noting that he hadn't taken a train in years. ``It was
just like skidding on the ground, the same jerking me back and
forth.''
</P>
<P>
   In Dallas, American Airlines rented a 1999 Lincoln Executive
Town Car and a driver to resolve Sowers' problem. Sowers and his
daughter Gail Bell, who had flown to Little Rock to accompany him
home, were chauffeured to Tucson, American spokesman John Hotard
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Sowers' wife, Audrey Sowers, 65, who flew to Little Rock after
the American Airlines crash, said it was clear that her husband
wouldn't arrive in Tucson via rail.
</P>
<P>
   ``He barely made it to Dallas,'' she said. ``He was champing at
the bit.''
</P>
<P>
   She continued on the train to Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Sowers and Bell spent Monday night in Midland and
arrived home Tuesday afternoon, the day before his 69th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Sowers praised American for catering to his need to find another
way home.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would have offered me a golf cart if I had asked for
it,'' he said.

REPUBLICANS REVIVE BID TO BAR PEACEKEEPER FUNDS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By TIM WEINER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Republicans, backed by Speaker Dennis
Hastert, Wednesday revived attempts to bar funds for American
peacekeeping troops in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said the move would make Congress ``a laughingstock''
and subvert the search for peace at the moment the Yugoslav army
agreed to withdraw from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert and the Republican leadership shelved the effort 13 days
ago, at the White House's request. Key conservatives immediately
rebelled and blocked the bill to which the ban was attached, a $289
billion military spending authorization.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday the conservatives won Hastert's support for ``a
discussion and vote on this issue,'' said his spokesman, John
Feehery. In exchange, the conservatives unlocked the military bill,
which now becomes the vehicle for the House to argue over the
ending of NATO's war in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker supports an amendment barring funds for peacekeepers
without congressional authorization, Feehery said. He said ``the
House should work its will'' on another amendment outlawing any
money for peacekeeping in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Those measures, scheduled to be debated on Thursday, will be
hotly contested. The House in April refused to give its political
backing to NATO's air campaign in Yugoslavia. Republicans called
the bombing ``Clinton's war.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will veto any military spending bill restricting
Pentagon funds for operations in Kosovo, said a White House
spokesman, P.J. Crowley. ``It would be very unwise for Congress to
take any action that undercuts U.S. policy precisely at the point
when success is in reach,'' he said. ``We need to see the
peacekeeping operations through.''
</P>
<P>
   The House minority leader, Rep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri,
criticized ``the spectacle of Republicans bringing up amendments to
cut off funding at the very moment that we should be trying to
consolidate the peace.'' And Rep. Martin Frost, D-Texas, said the
Republicans, by bringing the amendments to the floor, made the
House ``appear both a laughingstock and irrelevant.''
</P>
<P>
   In its first vote on the defense bill Wednesday, the House
unanimously backed an amendment enacting recommendations by the Cox
committee, the House panel that reported last month on assertions
of Chinese espionage at the nation's nuclear weapons laboratories.
The labs are run by the Department of Energy, whose military
activities are covered by the bill.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment is aimed at strengthen intelligence-gathering and
stepping up spy-catching operations at the Energy Department. It
temporarily bars foreign visitors from the weapons labs and
tightens access to classified information by Energy Department
employees.
</P>
<P>
   It orders the White House to monitor the use of high-performance
American computers sold to China and it requires the president to
report to Congress on Chinese military technology and espionage.
</P>
<P>
   The Cox committee's ranking Democrat, Rep. Norm Dicks of
Washington, said the measure ``would go a long way'' toward curing
longstanding security problems at the labs.

MOTOROLA AND SUN TO BUILD JOINT SYSTEM FOR FAST NET ACCESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID BARBOZA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Motorola Inc., one of the world's largest makers of
wireless communications equipment, and Sun Microsystems Inc., which
is best known for its Solaris operating systems and the Java
programming language, said Wednesday that they were teaming up to
create a new wireless network to provide high-speed Internet
access.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies said that the new system would allow consumers
within the next few years to tap into the Internet through cellular
telephones, pagers, hand-held computing devices and other wireless
devices for tasks as varied as buying books, trading stocks online,
viewing multimedia programs and sending and retrieving digital
photographs. The group said it expected to have a new platform
ready by 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to create an infrastructure for a global network that
offers high-speed Internet access, Motorola, earlier this year
formed a joint venture with Cisco Systems, the networking giant.
Under it the two companies are to spend $1 billion over the next
four or five years and open four joint-research and development
centers.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Sun Microsystems has joined them in hope of creating a
wireless and Internet triumvirate to sell Internet servers and
routers to Internet service providers, like telecommunications and
cable companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Essentially what we're creating is the next generation
telecommunications architecture,'' said Christopher Galvin, chief
executive of Motorola, which is based in Schaumburg, Ill. ``We're
building a wireless infrastructure for computer applications, so
that a day trader can make trades wherever they are, and so that
you can have wireless electronic commerce and ATMs.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all the futuristic promise, analysts caution that
building wireless systems is fraught with difficulty and that
contractual arrangements could make selling such a system to
Internet service providers challenging.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general, wireless infrastructure has been a very difficult
thing to deploy,'' said Michael Slater, an analyst at Cahners
Microdesign Research in Sebastopol, Calif. ``There's a huge amount
of infrastructure that is needed to make this stuff happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Those obstacles have not, however, dulled excitement in the
wireless arena. Microsoft, Qualcomm and a number of European
telecommunications giants are preparing for wireless access to the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But Cisco Systems, Motorola and now Sun Microsystems said their
plan was among the most ambitious. The three companies, for
instance, have agreed on an open Internet Protocol-based system
that would be more flexible, scalable and open to customization,
even from competitors; the system would incorporate Sun's Solaris
operating system and its Java programming language.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement announced Wednesday, Motorola will invest
about $1 billion over the next decade in the venture. Motorola
servers would be used, along with hardware and software from Sun
Microsystems and Cisco routers and packet-switching technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``The open system allows us faster time to the market,'' said
Jerry Campbell, a vice president in the network products and
emerging technologies division at Motorola, and ``much higher speed
data transport.''
</P>
<P>
   Some cellular telephones, he noted, were already being equipped
with browsers, and other wireless devices were blurring the lines
between pagers, cellular telephones and electronic storage devices.

AFTER BELGIUM'S DIOXIN SCARE, SINGAPORE PURGES FOOD STOCKS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Switzerland, South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong,
Malaysia, Belgian, Australia and New Zealand. ) By WAYNE ARNOLD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SINGAPORE _ The free-range chicken is gone, the Camembert is
dwindling and there's only enough foie gras to last the week.
Beyond that, the future looks bleak to Justin Quek, chef of
Singapore's most exclusive French restaurant, Au Jardin.
</P>
<P>
   This town has been declared a foie-gras-free zone. The same goes
for bratwurst, weisswurst, feta and Morbier. Scratch, too, the
prosciutto, Stilton, and saucisse a l'ail. Anything containing meat
or dairy products from Europe has been yanked from grocery store
shelves following a snap government order last weekend in response
to news that animal feed contaminated with the cancer-causing
chemical dioxin may have poisoned a variety of products from
Belgium and elsewhere in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Swedish meatballs are off the menu at the local Ikea. At the
Cold Storage grocery on Orchard Road, Singapore's busiest shopping
boulevard, hurried staff simply taped white butcher's paper over an
entire case of imported cheese, pates and cold cuts.
</P>
<P>
   It caught everybody off-guard, says the general manager, Huw
Jenkins, who spent the weekend with a hastily assembled task force
of employees pulling suspect items off the shelves.
</P>
<P>
   The ban put Singapore on a growing list of nations, from
Switzerland to South Korea, that are blocking some imports of
European food in response to the concerns. Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong
and Malaysia have all announced similar restrictions on Belgian and
other European imports.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps no country has been so quick or so thorough as
Singapore in eradicating all trace of Continental delicacies from
its shopping list. Singapore's ban extends to any food made with
European meat, eggs or dairy products. Hence, European cookies,
chocolates and even some pastas have been whisked away.
</P>
<P>
   Gone are the European shortbreads, mayonnaise and even the
Toblerone chocolate bars. Citizens have been advised to throw out
or return anything from Belgium and put other European foodstuffs
at arm's length until the authorities deem them edible. The
Ministry of Environment says it has hundreds of inspectors scouring
the city for remaining items.
</P>
<P>
   The sentence for any Belgian leftovers is unequivocal:
incineration.
</P>
<P>
   It should come as no surprise that so many European foods can be
found on tables here in the land of fish-head curry and pepper
crab. A growing expatriate community, more than a century of
European influence and, more recently, per capita incomes that
rival Europe's support a smorgasbord of foreign cuisines in this
prosperous tropical city.
</P>
<P>
   More remarkable is that even local manufacturers have been
affected because so many ingredients they use are shipped from
Europe. Some local bakeries, for example, have been deprived of
European egg powder for cakes and pastries. That a chicken eating
poisoned feed in Belgium could foul wedding cakes in Singapore is
yet another reminder of how borderless the global economy has
become.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, according to government figures, Singapore has
imported 14 tons of frozen Belgian pork, 60 tons of canned Belgian
pork and 17.6 tons of Belgian egg powder.
</P>
<P>
   Shops are posting signs vouching for non-European ingredients.
The ban has been a boon for products from Australia and New
Zealand, which offer alternatives to European products. ``We never
bothered to look at labels before,'' said one local shopper as he
scrutinized the fine print on a pint of Haagen-Dazs ice cream (made
in the United States) at the Cold Storage market.
</P>
<P>
   The dioxin debacle is actually the second food scare Singapore
has faced so far this year: A viral epidemic on Malaysian pig farms
diminished Singapore's taste for pork so severely that a local
television station broadcast scenes from a new, modern abattoir on
its prime-time news.
</P>
<P>
   Quek already buys Au Jardin's beef and veal from the United
States and Australia, a vestige of the mad-cow scare. But he prides
himself on using only French pigeons, ducks and free-range
chickens. Local chickens are raised in cages, he says, and are
comparatively flabby and tasteless. ``It will require the best
sauces,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The government ban exempts European products produced before
January, which means a reprieve for most slow-maturing hard
cheeses, Jenkins of the Cold Storage grocery said.
</P>
<P>
   But at Au Jardin, the cheese tray will take on a decidedly
different accent. ``We'll have to use Tasmanian,'' Quek says.  &QL;

<P>
   Four days after surviving the crash of Flight 1420, Richard
Sowers was out of a hospital and ready to return home to Tucson,
Ariz., choosing to travel by train rather than go through another
plane landing.
</P>
<P>
   But just outside Little Rock, Ark., he began suffering
flashbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had completely forgotten about the shaking and the noise,''
he said, noting that he hadn't taken a train in years. ``It was
just like skidding on the ground, the same jerking me back and
forth.''
</P>
<P>
   In Dallas, American Airlines rented a 1999 Lincoln Executive
Town Car and a driver to resolve Sowers' problem. Sowers and his
daughter Gail Bell, who had flown to Little Rock to accompany him
home, were chauffeured to Tucson, American spokesman John Hotard
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Sowers' wife, Audrey Sowers, 65, who flew to Little Rock after
the American Airlines crash, said it was clear that her husband
wouldn't arrive in Tucson via rail.
</P>
<P>
   ``He barely made it to Dallas,'' she said. ``He was champing at
the bit.''
</P>
<P>
   She continued on the train to Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Sowers and Bell spent Monday night in Midland and
arrived home Tuesday afternoon, the day before his 69th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Sowers praised American for catering to his need to find another
way home.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would have offered me a golf cart if I had asked for
it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the June 1 crash, American gave each passenger on
the plane a check for $25,000 to help defray expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Sowers said he was in Seat 24F when the McDonnell Douglas MD-82
crashed at Little Rock National Airport. Nine people died and more
than 80 were injured when the jet crashed after landing in a
violent thunderstorm.
</P>
<P>
   Sowers suffered a fractured rib and several cuts, including a
gash on his left foot. He was released June 2 from Southwest
Regional Medical Center in Little Rock.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen people injured in the crash were in five Little Rock
hospitals Wednesday. Two were listed in critical condition, one in
serious condition and the remainder in good or fair condition.
</P>
<P>
   One was expected to be released late Wednesday.

Arkadelphia, Ark., Samantha Salmans, 8, of Cabot, Ark., and Kristin
Maddox, 22, of Ponca City, Okla., were receiving treatment for
burns they suffered when the jet burst into flames at the end of

HOUSE GOP PUSHES BILLS TO INCREASE PATIENT'S RIGHTS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With Democrats stepping up the pressure for
Congress to overhaul the managed-care system, several influential
House Republicans introduced a package of legislation Wednesday
that would increase the rights of patients but would not remove the
high hurdles to suing managed-care providers.
</P>
<P>
   The bills put forward by Reps. Bill Goodling of Pennsylvania and
John A. Boehner of Ohio won quick praise from Speaker Dennis
Hastert of Illinois, who called them common-sense proposals. His
remarks suggested that the package was the approach the Republican
leadership now favored, after months of searching for a party
position on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   House Democrats plan to start signing a petition next week
intended to force their own competing legislation on health
maintenance organizations to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   A crucial question is whether Republican moderates will be
content with the signs that their party is now ready to engage the
issue or whether some will join forces with the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic measure, called the patient's bill of rights, won
its first Republican co-sponsor Wednesday, Rep. Michael P. Forbes
of New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nation urgently needs HMO reform, and the best bill out
there currently happens to be this patient's bill of rights,''
Forbes said. ``I believe in it to my core.''
</P>
<P>
   The question of giving patients more rights in a health-care
environment increasingly dominated by managed-care plans stirs more
interest than many issues before Congress. Both parties see it as a
potent issue in the election next year, when control of the House
will be up for grabs. That has made the maneuvering over health
care more intense than ever in both the House and the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Legislation similar to the new Republican package squeaked by in
the House last year, on a 216-to-210 vote, but was never considered
by the Senate. Since then the Democrats have won five more House
seats, and it was not clear how that would change the dynamics of
the issue in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said the measures they introduced Wednesday would
give patients more access to emergency rooms and allow patients to
go directly to obstetricians, pediatricians and gynecologists for
routine care without prior approval from their insurance companies.
They would also prohibit health plans from restricting what doctors
tell patients about treatment options.
</P>
<P>
   The package would allow consumers to appeal health-care
decisions to an outside board. Unlike last year's Republican
measure, the new package would consider the results of such an
appeal legally binding and enforceable through both prosecution and
fines, the Republicans said. But the legislation does not make it
easier for patients to sue HMOs under state law for punitive
damages the way the Democrats' bill and some competing Republican
versions do.
</P>
<P>
   The package would also allow employers to pool together to buy
health care for their workers, so they could try to negotiate lower
prices. The sponsors said this could help provide some coverage for
the 43 million Americans without health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats and some Republicans argued Wednesday that the package
of legislation included many loopholes and still did too little to
help patients.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charlie Norwood, Republican of Georgia, who has been
drafting legislation closer to that put forward by the Democrats,
said he did not want to subject insurance companies to frivolous
lawsuits. But Norwood added that expanded rights to sue were
important to ``discourage insurance companies from dragging their
feet and taking forever'' to approve a costly treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John D. Dingell of Michigan, chief sponsor of the
Democratic bill, expressed suspicion that the Republicans were
presenting a package of individual bills instead of one
comprehensive measure to clear the way for only the least
controversial bills to pass.
</P>
<P>
   Dingell asked why the Republicans had introduced multiple bills,
and he noted that there were various comprehensive measures already
drafted in the House.
</P>
<P>
   In both the House and the Senate, Democrats have been pushing in
concert for action on the health-care issue, which they have called
one of their highest priorities for the 106th Congress. With House
Democrats beginning their petition drive to push their legislation
to the floor, Senate Democrats have threatened to start trying to
tack their plan onto other Senate bills as an amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans in the Senate passed their own managed-care
legislation _ similar to the House proposal _ out of one committee
earlier this year. But the bill has been bogged down in the
tax-writing committee because of disputes over tax incentive
provisions and review processes to settle disputes between patients
and health plans. Senate leaders are trying to reach an agreement
that would allow the legislation to come to the floor this month.

LONG REACH TO DEATH ROW FOR A GRADUATION SPEAKER
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., Texas)  (rk) 
 By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The graduation speaker is on Death Row in
Pennsylvania, so he will not actually be there when the Evergreen
State College holds its commencement exercises on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But plans by the college to play a 13-minute tape-recorded
speech by Mumia Abu-Jamal, who was convicted of killing a
Philadelphia police officer 18 years ago, have provoked a range of
protests, including Gov. Gary Locke's cancellation of his own
scheduled address to the graduating students and plans by the slain
officer's wife to show up at the event to register her dismay.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas, the House majority whip,
whose security guard was shot and killed in the U.S. Capitol last
summer, said he planned to take the floor of the House of
Representatives on Friday to ask for a moment of silence in protest
of the graduation speech.
</P>
<P>
   But the state-run college in Olympia, the state capital, has
staunchly defended a decision by its students to solicit
Abu-Jamal's participation with his address, which he recently
telephoned to the school. Abu-Jamal's supporters, including nearly
10,000 people who attended a demonstration in Philadelphia in April
demanding a new trial for him, say he is the victim of an unfair
trial, poor legal representation and witness coercion by
prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   From prison, both as a book writer and a commentator on the
Pacifica Radio Network, Abu-Jamal has emerged as a spokesman
against the death penalty. College officials explained Wednesday,
without taking a stance on his guilt or innocence, that they
welcomed the decision to include him as a speaker with two students
and two faculty members.
</P>
<P>
   The college president, Jane L. Jervis, in a statement released
to reporters, said Abu-Jamal deserved inclusion because he had used
his free-speech rights ``to galvanize an international conversation
about the death penalty, the disproportionate number of blacks on
death row, the relationship between poverty and the criminal
justice system.'' Abu-Jamal is black, and the officer he was
convicted of killing was white.
</P>
<P>
   The planned speech has become both an emotional and political
football, illustrated by the announcement by Maureen Faulkner, the
wife of the slain police officer, Daniel Faulkner, who was 25 when
he was killed, that she was likely to attend the graduation in
silent protest. She has said she would bring a photograph of her
husband and hold it aloft as Abu-Jamal's speech is played over
loudspeakers.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay, in a statement released in Washington this week, said it
was ``socially irresponsible'' to allow Abu-Jamal to take part in
the ceremony. ``I am shocked that Evergreen State College would
invite convicted cop-killer Mumia Abu-Jamal to speak,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Evergreen, a four-year, liberal arts college has long prided
itself on both its independent and quirky streaks, the latter
reflected in the students' selection several years ago of the
geoduck, a freakish-looking clam that can grow as big as 5 feet
long, as its athletic mascot.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Locke received the highest number of votes
when students at the school were asked whom they wanted to speak at
graduation. But after Abu-Jamal was included and many police groups
complained, Locke, a Democrat who is up for re-election next year,
withdrew.
</P>
<P>
   Locke did so with a statement that he wished to ``applaud and
respect the students' efforts to develop a graduation program that
includes a diversity of views.'' But the governor, a former
prosecutor who supports the death penalty, said he would bow out to
show respect for law-enforcement officers.
</P>
<P>
   Abu-Jamal, a former reporter at a public-radio station who was
known as Wesley Cook, was convicted in 1982 of killing Faulkner,
shot while arresting Abu-Jamal's brother. Abu-Jamal was shot at the
scene by Faulkner, and neither he nor his brother testified at
trial. He has repeatedly proclaimed his innocence and has asked for
a new trial, but his conviction has been twice upheld by the
Pennsylvania Supreme Court.

ECONOMIC SCENE: POLITICAL REMEDY FOR MEDICARE COULD BECOME ECONOMIC
POISON 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   President Clinton's plan to revamp Medicare is shaping up as a
clever device for election-year politicking. But whether it
succeeds as health care policy is unclear.
</P>
<P>
   According to administration officials and internal documents,
the Medicare proposal, which is expected to be announced later this
month, will expand Medicare benefits by adding coverage for
outpatient prescription drugs, heavily subsidizing the cost to the
elderly so that they pay perhaps only half the costs. To pay for
the new drug benefit, the proposal would gobble up nearly a
trillion dollars of future budget surpluses, stripping Republicans
of money to pay for their tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Though details are unsettled, the proposal will also seek to
inject more vigorous competition into the Medicare market from
private managed care plans but in a way that will not raise
premiums the elderly must pay to stay in traditional
fee-for-service coverage. This provision is catnip to powerful
Democratic constituencies that cling to traditional Medicare and
whose support Vice President Al Gore desperately needs in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   All this makes for deft politics, but, depending on final
details, dubious economics. Even those like Robert D. Reischauer of
the Brookings Institution, who think the administration's ideas are
a ``step in the right direction,'' lament the lost opportunity to
fix glaring flaws in Medicare. Indeed, how well the plan fixes
Medicare will largely depend on which officials win out: those
whose primary focus is on Medicare or those who are concentrating
primarily on the elections in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare needs a fix. Costs are rising fast. Benefits are skimpy
compared with those of employer-based plans. The program lacks many
innovative techniques that the best private managed care plans use
to raise the quality of care.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's plan seriously tackles only one of these
flaws: expanding Medicare to include prescription drugs. Some
officials say the cost need not be prohibitive, because
prescription drugs substitute for expensive hospital and nursing
home care. But most independent estimates put the cost of drug
coverage at about $40 a month for every Medicare participant. If
the charge were passed onto the elderly, their monthly premium, now
$45.50, would nearly double. Private companies that provide
supplemental drug coverage charge about $90 a month. The
administration plan would cover a substantial part of the cost by
tapping future budget surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   The administration also plans to restructure the way that
Medicare plans compete. Most of the elderly enroll in the
government-run fee-for-service plan. About 15 percent of the
elderly enroll in private managed care plans. But the competition
is stunted because federal regulators decide, largely independent
of market forces, how much the plans charge their enrollees and
collect from the government. The system of government-set prices
causes problem. Managed care plans have been dropping out of the
program, contending that the government fees are set too low.
</P>
<P>
   Here the administration is caught in a political bind. Most
economists recommend moving to a systems of competitive bidding.
Plans, including the government-run fee-for-service option, would
submit bids for enrolling Medicare beneficiaries, and the
government would base its contribution to the plans on the basis of
those market bids. The idea is let market competition drive the
government's cost to the proper level.
</P>
<P>
   But the system that makes good economic sense makes little
political sense. The problem is that under competitive bidding, the
price of fee-for-service coverage is expected to rise faster than
the price of managed care because managed-care does a better job
controlling costs. If so, the elderly will find themselves
financially compelled to switch to managed care, and that is not a
threat the administration is likely to pose in an election year.
Some economists ask, however, why the elderly should be better
insulated from the rising cost of fee-for-service coverage than are
taxpayers who pay the bill for Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   One option the administration has considered is moving to
partial competitive bidding. Managed care plans _ but not the
traditional fee-for-service plan _ would submit bids. The purpose
is to unleash competition to drive down the government's costs.
</P>
<P>
   This proposal is not new. A version will be tested in Phoenix
and the Kansas City area early next year. But economists are not
sure it will work. Gail Wilensky, chairwoman of the Medicare
Payment Advisory Commission, fears that competition limited to
managed care plans will drive down their revenue even as the cost
of the protected fee-for-service plan spirals upward. That could
drive managed care from the market. The administration is working
on variations that would put competitive pressure on the
fee-for-service plan but in a way that keeps the premium in check.
</P>
<P>
   Despite potential defects, Reischauer argues that the
administration's tentative proposal would do more good than harm.
It takes at least a half-step toward competition and adds a
desperately needed drug benefit. Of course, that drug benefit would
place a heavy toll on general revenues, guaranteeing a run-in with
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign 2000 may shape up as a test whether the Democrats can
sell a expensive drug benefit for the elderly better than the
Republicans can sell an expensive tax cut for everyone else. &QL;

HILLARY CLINTON, VISITING BINGHAMTON, PRAISES TECHNOLOGY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JONATHAN P. HICKS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BINGHAMTON, N.Y. _ Hillary Rodham Clinton stepped gingerly into
her apparent political campaign Wednesday, taking questions from
workers at an electronics plant and mixing with contributors at a
fund-raising reception for a Democratic congressman. It was Mrs.
Clinton's first trip to New York state since she announced plans to
form an exploratory committee to consider running for the U.S.
Senate seat being vacated by Daniel Patrick Moynihan.
</P>
<P>
   While she never specifically discussed the topic of her
anticipated campaign, it was clear that Mrs. Clinton was being
taken increasingly seriously by politicians and the public as the
likely Democratic contender in next year's Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   At the reception Wednesday evening, a fund-raiser for Rep.
Maurice D. Hinchey, Mrs. Clinton received an enthusiastic response.
While she spoke broadly on themes varying from the need for
refurbished school buildings to manufacturing products under
environmentally friendly techniques, the crowd of more than 300
seemed receptive to Hinchey's description of the first lady as ``an
important resource for this state.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters following the reception, Mrs. Clinton was
asked about an issue that is expected to play a dominant role in
the campaign: criticism of her as a carpetbagger who has never
lived in the state of New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't made any decision yet,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ``And
when and if I do there will be plenty of time to talk about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, sounding as if she had already entered the race in
earnest, she said, ``I have found in my many visits to New York
that the kinds of issues that people in New York talk to me about
are the kinds of issues that I have worked on for more than 30
years and have worked on very intensely in the last six and a half
years.''
</P>
<P>
   She added that what New York voters ``really care about is a
partnership between the public and private sectors, about how we're
going to keep good jobs; how we're going to keep the best education
system.'' Those issues, she said, ``are the kinds of issues that I
have a long interest and experience in.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, Mrs. Clinton has been trying use her frequent
travels to New York as a way of establishing some connection to the
state, where she has never lived. It was her 11th visit to New York
this year. After the fund-raising event for Hinchey, a four-term
Democrat who represents the Southern Tier near the Pennsylvania
border, Mrs. Clinton departed for New York City, where she will
appear on the NBC television program ``Today,'' on Thursday
morning, and visit a school in Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's first stop here was at a Lockheed Martin
electronics plant in Union, a town on the outskirts of Binghamton.
At the plant, where electronic controls are made, Mrs. Clinton met
with about 40 employees. She took questions on subjects including
health care and Federal spending on research and development. But,
as has been her custom in her last 10 visits, Mrs. Clinton's visit
was carefully calibrated, keeping her far from the public and at
arms length from the press.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps as a harbinger of the passions her candidacy is likely
to unleash, about 100 demonstrators stood outside of the Holiday
Inn hotel, where the fund-raising reception was held. Many of them
jeered Mrs. Clinton, holding signs reading ``Hillary Go Home'' and
``Hillary: Go Back to Arkansas, You Carpetbagger.'' There were also
cheering supporters outside the hotel, holding signs saying
``Hillary, Our Next Senator.''
</P>
<P>
   Her visit to the Binghamton area appears to focus on the kind of
terrain that pollsters have suggested the First Lady will need in
her apparent effort to win election next year: areas where
Republicans have won but where Democratic candidates can still gain
a receptive ear.
</P>
<P>
   This area, which has voted often for Republicans statewide and
overwhelmingly supported Gov. George E. Pataki, has been
represented in Congress by Democrats since 1975. While Republicans
hold the mayor's office and a majority of the City Council in
Binghamton, there is a Democratic Town Supervisor in Union, its
more populous neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving for New York City, Mrs. Clinton pledged that she
would return. ``There's something I'm particularly looking forward
to,'' she said. ``And that's listening to the people of New York.
So, I'll be back.''

ADVERTISING: BURNETT STRESSES `DIGITAL DNA' IN MOTOROLA CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID BARBOZA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Motorola INC. has decided that some of its products
are simply too clandestine. While pagers and cellular telephones
are well known and branded with the Motorola ``wings'' logo, few
know that the company deals in something called ``embedded
solutions.''
</P>
<P>
   So beginning Thursday, Motorola is introducing a new print
advertising campaign to tell the world that its ``embedded
solutions'' _ the microchips hidden inside a growing number of
everyday consumer products _ will now go by the name of ``Digital
DNA,'' a new sub-brand to the Motorola name.
</P>
<P>
   Microchips, of course, are used in everything from computers and
compact disk players to air bags and refrigerators. They are
enabling technologies, say those in the know, a kind of blueprint
or road map to the digital age, a future that Motorola executives
say the company is helping to shape through its increasingly
diverse semiconductor business.
</P>
<P>
   The new print campaign, which gets under way with a full-page
advertisement in The Wall Street Journal, seeks to bring attention
to that while also paving the way for scores of products that are
powered by Motorola chips to be affixed with a new logo that reads
``Digital DNA from Motorola'' with an accompanying red asterisk
that serves as the signature tag. The Leo Burnett agency in Chicago
is handling the account, which has billings estimated at more than
$10 million.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola's effort to brand the silicon chips is not unlike
Intel's campaign to co-brand with computer manufacturers by
advertising that a Compaq computer, say, has an Intel pentium
processor inside.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Motorola would like consumers to know that its chips are
the brains behind a growing number of ``smart'' computer products
that the company says ``think and link'' in an increasingly wired
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go out and ask 10 people what Motorola makes, first it
would be phones and pagers; not a lot know that it's also
semiconductors, and that's what makes things smart,'' said William
Edwards, an executive in the semiconductor division at Motorola.
``We want to be recognized for that.''
</P>
<P>
   In order to do that, Motorola is getting the word out that its
chips are everywhere. They are in networking equipment that routes
Internet traffic under names like Cisco and 3Com; they are under
the hood of Volvos and BMW's, sending digital signals that move
mirrors and deploy air bags; they are even embedded in washing
machines, microwaves and television set-top boxes.
</P>
<P>
   The print ads, which will appear in publications like Business
Week and Forbes, use pithy headlines and text to explain Digital
DNA, ``the heart of smart.'' One ad reads: ``What do the world's
smartest products have in common? Answer: the red asterisk, the
signature mark that says digital DNA.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, Motorola faces a daunting task that scores of
other companies have to deal with every day: How do you brand an
ingredient, a component that is built into a more familiar brand
name item? And how do you make the ingredient, well, sexy?
</P>
<P>
   ``Intel has put a lot of media weight behind their effort,''
said Gwen Morrison, a retail marketing and design consultant at
Frankel, a brand marketing agency in Chicago. ``There's a real
advantage for a Motorola or Intel to do this because as technology
products become more complex, it brings a kind of seal of approval;
it says that the product has a special ingredient inside.''
</P>
<P>
   Intel Corp. is not the only company that has had success selling
a little-understood technology or ingredient. Nutrasweet has tagged
cans of Pepsi. And BASF AG, the German chemical and pharmaceutical
giant, has for at least a decade been running television spots
created by Geer DuBois in New York that deliver a simple and
compelling message: ``We don't make a lot of the products you buy.
We make a lot of the products you buy better.'' Geer DuBois is now
defunct, and Hampel/Stefanides in New York, the BASF agency,
continues to create new spots.
</P>
<P>
   The BASF campaign, however, does not concern co-branding, which
is eventually what Motorola would like to do. By sometime next
year, Motorola executives say they would like the campaign to be so
effective that customers would be compelled to put the Digital DNA
logo on their products.
</P>
<P>
   Intel, which has a jazzy logo and even a jingle in its
television spots, has so-called co-op branding contracts where it
pays or otherwise compensates computer makers. Motorola, however,
has no plans to pay for the co-branding opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   The company cannot simply affix Motorola's wings logo to
products to indicate that its chips are inside because the chips
are often in products that compete against the Motorola brand name,
executives say, and that could create co-branding tensions,
conflicts and consumer confusion. For example, a Nokia cellular
phone with a Motorola logo might not go over well.
</P>
<P>
   For Motorola, the Digital DNA effort grew, in part, out of a
reorganization two years ago after the company's fortunes turned
down with Asia. Its semiconductor division, based in Austin, Texas,
went from a research-oriented effort to a more market-driven or
customer-focused approach, executives say.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative simply involves selling more microchips and
getting credit for powering a greater and greater variety of smart
products.
</P>
<P>
   It is also an attempt to offer shareholders, analysts and
customers a new way of valuing the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thinking, of course, is letting people know all the great
stuff we're in,'' said Karen Hanley, a director of brand marketing
at Motorola. ``We did a lot of research with focus groups, and
people said, `It's about time you took credit for some of this.'''

EDITORIAL: CONSTRUCTING PEACE IN KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, June 10:
</P>
<P>
   Now that NATO and Serbian military commanders have agreed on a
plan to cease hostilities in Kosovo, the war is rapidly coming to
an end. The latest round of diplomacy and military talks was
difficult, but leaves NATO's core goals intact. Though Kosovo has
been devastated by the brutal Serbian assault, the peace plan
effectively strips administration of the province from Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic and opens the way for the safe
resettlement of the ethnic Albanian refugees.
</P>
<P>
   If there are no further hitches, Serbian troops should begin to
leave Kosovo early Thursday, and, once this is verified, NATO will
suspend bombing. After that, the United Nations Security Council
can approve a resolution that sets a framework for peace in
Yugoslavia and NATO peacekeeping forces can start to move into
areas of Kosovo as they are vacated by Serbian soldiers and
paramilitary units over the next week and a half. Though China is
still smarting from the mistaken bombing of its embassy in Belgrade
in May, it should not use its Security Council veto power to block
the pivotal U.N. resolution on Kosovo that was drafted this week by
the United States, its allies and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Some pieces of this complex diplomatic and military puzzle are
imperfect. The U.N. resolution is vague about the NATO peacekeeping
role and command of foreign forces in Kosovo. Russia has yet to
agree to dispatch its own troops to help preserve the peace. If it
does, coordination with NATO operations will be a delicate issue,
requiring further talks between Moscow and Washington. The
repatriation of hundreds of thousands of displaced ethnic
Albanians, the centerpiece of the peace plan, is likely to take
months and a monumental rebuilding program in Kosovo. The disarming
of ethnic Albanian guerrillas, no less essential to peace, will not
be easy. At any time, Milosevic can disrupt the exercise by
breaking the agreements.
</P>
<P>
   But none of these potential problems should disable the
restoration of peace in Kosovo. Nearly 50,000 NATO peacekeepers,
including 7,000 Americans, will shortly take up position in the
province under NATO command. Though the composition and leadership
of the force is not specified in the U.N. resolution, all parties
to the conflict, including Milosevic, well understand that this
will be primarily a NATO show under a U.N. mandate. Arrangements
for adding Russian troops can be similar to those devised for
Bosnia, where Russians do not take orders directly from NATO. To
avoid the informal partition of Kosovo into Serbian and ethnic
Albanian zones, Russian peacekeepers should not be given exclusive
control of the northern area with the largest concentration of
Serbian citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Making the villages of Kosovo habitable again, and convincing
the refugees that it is safe to return, may be the greatest
challenges facing the West. Many villages were looted and burned by
Serbian forces. Communication and transportation systems were
damaged by NATO bombing. Thousands of land mines planted by Serbian
troops must be removed. Food and medical care have to be provided.
The bill for all this is likely to be at least several billion
dollars, nearly all of it paid by the United States, Europe and
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The peace plan gives Belgrade the right to send a small security
force back into Kosovo after it has first withdrawn all its troops,
paramilitary groups and police. This should not turn into an
opportunity for Milosevic to intimidate returning refugees.
Kosovo's border checkpoints with Albania and Macedonia must be
controlled by foreigners, not Serbian soldiers, working under U.N.
authority.
</P>
<P>
   After a decade of Serbian repression and months of ethnic
cleansing, Kosovo is gravely wounded. It will take months, if not
years, to rebuild and repopulate the province and restore some
sense of harmony between ethnic Albanians and Serbs. The high level
of autonomy Kosovo will enjoy while temporarily under U.N.
administration will need to be preserved after the international
presence fades. With the war ending, that difficult work can now
begin. &QL;

WILLIAM RYAN, 78, U.S. PROSECUTOR WHO HELPED CONVICT HOFFA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wis., Fla., Md.)   (bl)  
 By WILLIAM H. HONAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   William Everest Ryan, a federal prosecutor who in the 1960s
helped obtain the criminal conviction of Teamsters president James
R. Hoffa, died May 28 at a health care center in Baltimore. He was
78 and lived in Silver Spring, Md.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a neurological disorder, said his son Patrick
Edward Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   After joining the Justice Department in 1957, Ryan was assigned
by Attorney General William Rogers to explore potentially
incriminating activities by Hoffa. Ryan traveled extensively,
concentrating his investigation on land-development deals in
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation was given an enormous boost in the early 1960s
when Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy organized a group of
prosecutors headed by Walter Sheridan and John Cassidy to move
against Hoffa. Ryan played an important role in that investigation,
Cassidy said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1964, the Justice Department successfully prosecuted Hoffa
for jury tampering and mail and wire fraud in connection with the
illegal use of the Teamsters pension fund. Hoffa was sentenced to
eight years in prison. He disappeared in 1975, four years after
being released.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, Attorney General Ramsey Clark named Ryan to head a new
section of the Justice Department that had been created to deal
with the nation's growing drug problem. Until retiring in 1975,
Ryan was engaged in revising laws on narcotics and other dangerous
drugs. From 1975 to 1977, he was assistant inspector general for
the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan, a native of Milwaukee, graduated from Marquette University
and received a law degree from Georgetown University. He served in
the Marine Corps in the Pacific in World War II and was recalled to
active duty in the Korean War.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan's wife, the former Rosemary Ann Kelly, died in 1996. In
addition to his son Patrick, he is survived by four daughters,
Kathleen A. Ryan of Catonsville, Md., Mary Frances Timm of Palm
Harbor, Fla., Sheila Ryan Arrildt of Severn, N.C., and Rebecca S.
Doss of Salisbury, Md.; another son, William Kelly Ryan of Silver
Spring; a sister, Catherine Provost of Prospect Heights, Ill., and
13 grandchildren.

ALLSTATE BUYING PART OF CNA'S BUSINESS FOR $1.2 BILLION
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill.)  (rk) 
 By SHOLNN FREEMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Allstate Corp. said Wednesday that it would buy the personal
insurance business of CNA Financial Corp. for $1.2 billion,
expanding its business with independent insurance agents who sell
auto and homeowners policies.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the deal, Allstate will pay CNA $140 million
in cash and commit as much as $950 million in new capital to the
business. Allstate will also pay CNA Insurance a marketing royalty
for use of the CNA name over the next six years, a payment that is
projected to total about $110 million.
</P>
<P>
   Allstate plans to set up a new unit called CNA Personal
Insurance, which will hire all 2,000 employees of the CNA Financial
unit. It will be headed by Bruce W. Marlow, a former chief
operating officer of the Progressive Corp., a large insurer, and
based in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Allstate rose 68.75 cents Wednesday, to $38.6875,
while CNA fell 37.5 cents, to $42.437.
</P>
<P>
   CNA will maintain ties to the new unit, with the appointment of
a special adviser to its board. The CNA management team for
personal lines of insurance will largely remain the same, CNA said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition will bolster Allstate's personal insurance
business segment that is serviced by independent agents, who help
clients choose the best policies among several insurers.
Historically, Allstate has generated most of its business through
its own 15,000 agents who sell only Allstate policies. Before
Wednesday, it ranked ninth in the market of personal insurance sold
through independent agents.
</P>
<P>
   With the addition of the CNA unit, which has about 3,800
independent agents to sell its personal insurance products,
Allstate will become the nation's third-largest insurer selling
personal policies through brokers representing multiple companies.
Allstate's total annual insurance premium revenue from that market
will more than double to $3 billion. Independent agents account for
a total of $45 billion in revenue in the personal insurance
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's announcement is very consistent with Allstate's
strategy to expand independent agent channels with acquisitions,''
said Kenneth S. Zuckerberg, a senior analyst at Keefe, Bruyette &AMP;
Woods. ``It seems to be a very good strategic fit.''
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call Wednesday, Bernard L. Hengesbaugh, chief
executive of CNA Insurance, said CNA was selling the personal
insurance line so that it could get back to its core business of
commercial and casualty insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Debreceny, a spokesman for Allstate, said the deal would
face no significant regulatory hurdles. CNA policyholders will not
see any big changes, he added.

WNBA STARTS SEASON WITH UPBEAT ATTITUDE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAMELA LEWIS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The WNBA is set to begin its third season today in the best of
both worlds.
</P>
<P>
   With the inclusion of 35 players from the defunct American
Basketball League, a celebrated college star, two new franchises to
bring the number of teams to 12, a 32-game schedule, an extended
playoff schedule, and the inaugural All-Star Game, the league is
poised to better than ever.
</P>
<P>
   The mere fact that the country's top talent has finally unified
into one league makes it that more appealing. Add to the mix
top-draft pick Chamique Holdsclaw, a four-time All-American from
Tennessee, and the competition in the WNBA this season will be a
notch above the previous years.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt in my mind that every team in the league has
gotten better and I believe there is going to be some compelling
stories this year,'' league president Val Ackerman said. ``How
Houston will do for example, whether Brian Agler can bring his
magic in Columbus to Minnesota, how quickly some of the college
seniors will emerge top players, and in particular Chamique
(Holdsclaw), and obviously the impact of top-quality players like
Dawn Staley, Jen Azzi, Yolanda Griffith, Natalie Williams, and
Katie Smith, when she's finally able to play after her knee is
officially recovered?''
</P>
<P>
   The two-time defending champion Houston Comets will be
hard-pressed to stay on top, particularly with the Western
Conference improving drastically with the drafting of high profile
players like Griffith to the Sacramento Monarchs, Williams to the
Utah Jazz and DeLisha Milton to the Los Angeles Sparks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that there is any doubt that everybody else has
closed the gap on us talent-wise,'' Houston coach Van Chancellor
said. ``And everybody in this league is so much better. The games
are going to be so much closer.''
</P>
<P>
   But the undisputed heavyweight Comets still did a lot to improve
upon a team stacked with talent in two-time MVP Cynthia Cooper,
Sheryl Swoopes, and Tina Thompson. However, instead of using their
first pick to draft a point guard to replace Kim Perrot, who
underwent surgery to remove brain tumors, Chancellor went for size,
taking 6-foot-3 Natalia Zassoulskaia from Russia in the first
round. But they added capable Sonya Henning from the ABL to fill
the void at the point.
</P>
<P>
   Is a third championship in store for the Comets?
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like we have a shot at it,'' Chancellor said. ``We've
lost Kim (Perrot). That's an adjustment. We've had a lot of
adjusting to do. But a lot of teams have. It boils down to does the
ball go in at the end or does it come out at the end. You never
know.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 runner-up Phoenix Mercury are going to be knocking on
the door, but Cheryl Miller's challenge is to integrate her foreign
players, many whom were playing in the European Championship, into
her game plan quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Agler, winner of two ABL championship with the Columbus Quest,
surrounded himself with some of his former players with Smith,
Andrea Lloyd, Tonya Edwards and Trisha Fallon to the Minnesota
Lynx.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like there is some pressure,'' Agler said. ``Everybody
looks at that Columbus team and some of those players, but I don't
consider us being Columbus, I consider us being the Minnesota
Lynx.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Eastern Conference, Charlotte is looking more like a
championship contender after adding leadership to a veteran squad
when they brought in Dawn Staley, who left the ABL before it
folded. She joins an experienced squad that finished second in
conference last year with Andrea Stinson and Tracy Reid.
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte head coach Marynell Meaders was just happy and
surprised to see Staley still available by the ninth pick in the
draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question about it, what she has brought to our
team has been leadership,'' Meadors said. ``She has brought
consistent shooting from the perimeter, which is something we
needed to address in the draft. I think the number one thing she's
brought to our team is that she's a well-respected veteran point
guard and people are listening to her and going on her cues.''
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Mystics, which had the best attendance in the
league last year, shouldn't have a problem duplicating their
success at the gate and the standings (they won only three games
last year) between Holdsclaw and Nikki McCray.
</P>
<P>
   New York has a new coach and new hopes; Orlando, under the
tuteledge of Carolyn Peck, the former Purdue coach who led the
Boilermakers to their first NCAA championship, is expecting to find
success in the pros; while Detroit and Cleveland are working
through injuries to prepare for their opener.
</P>
<P>
   But overall, the WNBA's third season looks more like the
beginning of something new and better.

MEXICAN WORLD CUP TEAM REAPS BENEFIT OF AMERICA'S SPECIAL EXPORT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It has required no slight adjustment for the Mexican-American
players who make up half the roster on Mexico's team for the
Women's World Cup. In contrast to the well-oiled machinery of U.S.
women's soccer on and off the field, the simple act of catching the
Mexican team bus can turn into an action movie.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, before an exhibition match in Mexico City, the
bus failed to show up. The Mexican team found itself stranded at
its training center, miles from the stadium. Soccer being a game of
spontaneous, unexpected moves, the players improvised.
</P>
<P>
   ``We flagged down a public bus; luckily it was empty,'' said
Laurie Hill, a midfielder from Los Angeles, who added that 17
players, two coaches, the team doctor and the equipment manager,
along with ice coolers and ball bags were crammed into a bus,
capacity 15. ``And we bribed the guy to take us to the stadium.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hill and her colleagues, given the chance to play in women's
soccer's premier event, are not complaining. Eligibility rules have
always been an elastic _ and sometimes abused _ aspect of
international soccer. FIFA, the sport's world governing body,
limits every player's career to one national team. Beyond that, it
abides by the citizenship rules of individual countries.
</P>
<P>
   David Regis, a Frenchman, played for the U.S. men in the 1998
World Cup because he married an American woman and had his American
citizenship expedited under a law usually reserved for the families
of servicemen. The captain of that American team, Thomas Dooley,
grew up in Germany, the son of a German mother and an American
soldier, and he could not speak enough English to buy a postcard
when he obtained his citizenship in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Under a recent law, people with a parent born in Mexico can
claim Mexican nationality. Hill was a three-time all-American at
the University of California-Santa Barbara whose mother is a native
of Mexico City. Monica Gerardo, the career leading scorer at Notre
Dame, qualified because her father was born in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw it as an opportunity to play soccer at the highest level
and to check back into my heritage,'' said Hill, 29, who twice
attended American training camps but never made the women's
national team. ``I knew my chance to play for the U.S. was past.
When I got this chance, I jumped on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill said she had made only several trips to Mexico before
joining the national team. A story in the Mexican news media
accused her of being a soccer carpetbagger, she said, and
questioned whether her mother, Ida, was actually born in Mexico.
She was, Hill said, adding that an uncle still lived in Mexico
City.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like I'm playing for China,'' Hill said. ``I think
most players feel a connection with the people and the culture.
Mexican people feel soccer in their blood. I've always had that
sense.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea to use Mexican-Americans came from Karlo Pedrin, a
restaurateur in Tijuana who lives in San Diego, and whose
16-year-old daughter, Tawnie, is an accomplished club team player
in Southern California. Women in Mexico are still fighting the
perception that they are unwomanly if they play soccer. The
national team trained for all of two weeks before trying, and
failing, to qualify for the 1995 Women's World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   North of the border, however, the sport thrives. Pedrin figured
that Mexico could qualify for the Women's World Cup, and the
Olympics, with Mexican-American players, affording his daughter a
possible chance to play in the 2000 Summer Games in Sydney,
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Pedrin persuaded the Mexican soccer federation to use his plan,
but he has since cut his ties to the team. He has filed a lawsuit
against the federation claiming that it owes him $50,000 for his
role in recruitment. One soccer official said he left in a power
struggle. Pedrin, a native of Mexico, said he became concerned that
players too removed from their Hispanic roots _ Americans whose
grandparents, not parents, were born in Mexico _ were being placed
on the team.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was concerned that fake birth certificates had been
used and that an American player named Monica Gonzalez had played
in an exhibition against the United States in March before she
received her Mexican nationality. Pedrin feared Mexico could suffer
penalties, just as the men's team was prevented from participating
in the 1990 World Cup in Italy because it had used overage players
in a youth tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Armando Aceves Campos, an official in the Mexican soccer
federation, said that six players were born in the United States,
and that those with Mexican grandparents were also eligible for
dual nationality. Campos said proper procedures were followed and
accused Pedrin of being on a ``personal campaign to discredit the
team.''
</P>
<P>
   Leonardo Cuellar, coach of the Mexican women's team, said the
citizenship issue had been a distraction, complete with anonymous
letters sent to the Mexican federation, but that he had been
assured ``that everything is in order.'' Keith Cooper, a spokesman
for FIFA, said he was unaware of any formal complaints against the
Mexican team.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they have gone through a legally binding procedure, and
documents have been issued by a sovereign state, who are we to cast
aspersions on that process?'' Cooper said. ``It is a remarkable
tribute to American soccer that Mexico is able to use American
women to bolster its team.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuellar, a former star of the Mexican men's team who also
coaches men's soccer at the University of California-Los Angeles,
took over the women's team last November and guided it into the
World Cup with two playoff victories over Argentina. He said he
called 29 soccer associations in Mexico, seeking the best female
players, but only six associations responded. ``We have some
amateur leagues, and it is growing on the college level, but is
more recreational soccer than anything organized,'' Cuellar said.
``It's a cultural thing, that ladies shouldn't do athletic and
aggressive sports. Mexican women have always been around soccer,
but mostly to support men. It's not like in America, where girls
start playing at 5 years old. But we have created a curiosity.''
</P>
<P>
   At a mountain training camp, Hill said the players had no heat
and little hot water, and had to build their own fire and sleep in
several layers of clothing to stay warm. In Mexico City, she said,
guards patrol the training center and players are not allowed to
leave without permission, for fear of their safety. Because the
men's under-20 team is also in camp, Hill said, the 20 members of
the women's team have been squeezed into four rooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've never had a women's team,'' Hill said. ``It's kind of
like they don't know what to do with us, what to allow us. It's
quite a different experience, but I love Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   Both the native and naturalized Mexicans have required
adjustments, Cuellar said. The result is not the most talented team
in the World Cup, but one of the most intriguing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have several players who had never gotten on a plane, some
who had never been out of the country, some who have college
degrees, some who finished only elementary school,'' Cuellar said.
``A couple of the Mexican girls are very wealthy. Some live in
places where there is no running water. Everyone feels welcome.
It's nice to see how they have melded together through preparation.
Our common goal is to play strong.'' &QL;

NHL COMMISSIONER ISSUES A WARNING TO THE ISLANDERS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa.)  (rk) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ If the New York Islanders trade Zigmund Palffy while
trying to reduce their payroll, they had better get some hockey
value for him and not just a large sum of money.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Bettman, the commissioner of the NHL, has enough financial
embarrassments to deal with, particularly the bankrupt Pittsburgh
Penguins.
</P>
<P>
   In his annual news conference Wednesday at the Stanley Cup
finals, Bettman discussed the Islanders in language which, for him,
was unusually blunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will monitor all of the trades and make sure that we are
comfortable from a hockey standpoint that the team simply isn't
being stripped down,'' Bettman said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he expected the Islanders' management to present a team
``that hasn't just simply been created to slash payroll without
regard to the hockey consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   Regarding a transaction for any combination of players, draft
choices or money, Bettman did not discuss a specific threshold or
formula that might trigger a nullification. But he implied that he
had the power to stop such a deal and would be willing to use it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have got to go through a balancing act of making sure that
the losses aren't so severe that the ownership doesn't give up,''
Bettman said.
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders have discussed a trade for Palffy, their
highest-paid and most-talented player, with several teams. Among
those teams are the New York Rangers, Chicago Black Hawks and Los
Angeles Kings, three of the league's high-profile teams who play in
major markets, have significant cash flow and missed the playoffs
last season.
</P>
<P>
   Palffy, 27 years old, is a six-year veteran who will earn $5
million next season on a long-term contract. In 331 NHL games,
Palffy has scored 331 points, 168 of them goals.
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders have been a significant league concern for several
seasons. Recently, their current owners have battled Nassau County
and their Nassau Coliseum management firm over the condition of
their arena and the terms of their lease, which does not expire
until 2015.
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders have said that they lost more than $20 million in
1998-99, a season that began when they threatened to vacate the
Coliseum, alleging safety concerns. The majority owners are Howard
Milstein, Edward Milstein and Steven Gluckstern, who bought 90
percent of the team for a reported $195 million in 1998 with the
expectation of a new arena on Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``While ownership clearly has made mistakes, the fact is the
prospects of being in the Nassau Coliseum for the next 15 or 20
years for the duration of that lease is not something that anybody
in their right mind would continue to fund on an ongoing basis,''
Bettman said. ``Last year the club lost a lot of money. Some of it
was self-inflicted.''
</P>
<P>
   It is believed that the Islanders, through general manager Mike
Milbury, are trying to cut the payroll for next season. They
recently traded Trevor Linden, another of their best players, to
Montreal for a first-round draft choice. Linden earned $2.5 million
last season.
</P>
<P>
   Bettman has urged the current ownership group to sell the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't had a specific warning call from the
commissioner,'' John Sanders, the Islanders' new president, said
Wednesday in a telephone interview when asked about the parameters
for trades.
</P>
<P>
   But Sanders acknowledged that Bettman's concerns are known to
the Islanders' ownership and management.
</P>
<P>
   ``We might look at anyone on the roster, and Ziggy's on the
payroll and the roster,'' Sanders said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about a possible sale of the team, Sanders said the
current owners are not trying to sell now and that it was unlikely
that someone would want to buy the franchise under its current
lease.
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, negotiations with the county could resume soon
and the team's owners hope for a better outcome. Only then, Sanders
and Bettman acknowledged, could a new buyer be interested.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is particularly interested in finding themselves in the
same situation we are in now,'' Sanders said.
</P>
<P>
   In Pittsburgh, the Penguins are in U.S. Bankruptcy Court under
Chapter 11 conditions. A decision on their future is expected June
24, Bettman said.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders was asked if the Islanders, in view of their financial
condition, would consider similar tactics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not considering a bankruptcy,'' Sanders said. ``Our
focus is a new arena.''

 &HT;    DuPont Photomasks loses CEO Hardinger
 &HT;    BJerry Mahoney
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROUND ROCK, Texas _ J. Michael Hardinger, who guided DuPont
Photomasks Inc.'s spinoff as a publicly traded company in 1996 and
oversaw its global expansion while the chip industry suffered
through a three-year slump, resigned as the company's chief
executive and chairman Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The 52-year-old Hardinger said he will help oversee operations
of the company while it searches for a new CEO. In the meantime,
board member Marshall Turner will serve as interim CEO and
chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Photomask makers such as DuPont etch chip makers' patented
designs on quartz plates. The plates are used to produce integrated
circuits on silicon wafers.
</P>
<P>
   A 25-year employee of E.I. DuPont de Nemours and Co., Hardinger
was tapped by the Wilmington, Del., research and technology giant
to help take its wholly owned photomask subsidiary public on June
13, 1996, when the chip industry was in a cyclical slump.
</P>
<P>
   The stock opened at $17 a share and reached a high of $72.62 1/2
on Sept. 30, 1997. Wednesday, the stock closed at $42.25, up 50
cents, in Nasdaq trading.
</P>
<P>
   Under Hardinger, DuPont Photomasks added manufacturing
facilities in Round Rock, Oregon, and Asia, bringing to 10 the
number of manufacturing sites.
</P>
<P>
   Since going public, the company has grown from about 1,200
employees to 1,500, including 300 at its headquarters in Round
Rock.
</P>
<P>
   While its size has grown, its profits haven't.
</P>
<P>
   In fiscal 1998, DuPont Photomasks' revenue grew 4 percent to
$271.6 million, but profit declined 9 percent to $33.5 million, in
part because of the slump.
</P>
<P>
   Hardinger, whose base salary was $315,000, and other senior
executives did not get bonuses that year, according to reports
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts give Hardinger credit for guiding the company
through its transition to a public company and leaving it
positioned for recent recovery in the chip industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The outlook has improved,'' said Susan Billat of BancBoston
Robertson Stephens in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hardinger is leaving at a time when they've come through a
difficult period. They were aggressive on both the capacity and
technology side.''
</P>
<P>
   David Wu of ABN Amro in San Francisco said Hardinger's departure
is a logical transition for the company and an opportunity to hire
a CEO with a more technical background.
</P>
<P>
   ``They probably need someone who comes in with a higher profile
. . . in the semiconductor world,'' Wu said.
</P>
<P>
   Hardinger said he and his wife, Cara, hope to stay in Austin. He
said he has no immediate plans to look for another job, but said he
looks forward to spending more time at home and ending a grueling
schedule _ about 75 percent of his time _ meeting with customers
around the world.

WILLIAM HESS, 82, MICROBIOLOGIST AND EXPERT ON AFRICAN SWINE
FEVER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.H., Minn., N.Y.)   (bl)  
 By ERIC NAGOURNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. William R. Hess, a microbiologist and a leading expert in
African swine fever, died May 29 at the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical
Center in Lebanon, N.H. He was 82, and lived in Tuftonboro, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   Hess spent his life researching how to prevent and control the
kinds of diseases that, if unleashed, can quickly ravage
populations of domesticated animals.
</P>
<P>
   He was often abroad; but when he was not, he worked at the
Animal Disease Center, a top-security facility run by the U.S.
Department of Agriculture on Plum Island, off the North Fork of New
York's Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   For years, recalled his son Brian, Dr. Hess would drive from his
home in East Marion, on the North Fork, to Orient Point, for the
nearly two-mile commute by boat to the island.
</P>
<P>
   Plum Island is home to a collection of some of the most
infectious animal diseases in the world, and the government goes to
great lengths to insure they are not inadvertently carried to the
mainland. So employees there work in ``negative pressure''
laboratories designed to stop pathogens from escaping and are
required to disinfect themselves at the start and end of their work
day.
</P>
<P>
   Hess' speciality, African swine fever, is a rapidly spreading,
usually deadly disease found in pigs. Its presence has never been
confirmed in North America.
</P>
<P>
   Hess worked on Plum Island from 1953 to 1988. In the mid-1980s
he was part of a team of scientists called upon to investigate a
theory that the disease might have a connection with AIDS. Some
scientists said they had seen a correlation between swine fever

DiSARCINA OPENS REHAB AT SINGLE A 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Shortstop Gary DiSarcina had X-rays on his left
forearm Wednesday, which showed his broken bone has healed
properly. He'll begin a rehab assignment today at Single-A Lake
Elsinore.
</P>
<P>
   DiSarcina, who was examined by hand and wrist specialist Dr.
Norman Zemel, will stay in Lake Elsinore through the weekend before
traveling Monday to Erie, Pa., to play with the club's Double-A
affiliate.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels play an exhibition game against Erie on June 21, an
off day during their next trip. DiSarcina is expected to join the
club then and travel with his teammates to Seattle, where he'd join
the lineup on June 22.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very happy to be released from parole,'' DiSarcina said.
``There's no reason to be cautious. I knew physically before the
X-rays I could do it. To hear the doctor say you're all right takes
a lot of pressure off your mind.''
</P>
<P>
   DiSarcina broke a bone in his left forearm Feb. 21 in his first
workout of spring training when coach George Hendrick inadvertently
hit him with a fungo bat. DiSarcina had surgery to insert a metal
plate in the forearm April 1.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't expected back until the All-Star break but said
there's no reason to take it slowly now.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, I'm going to bail out of Erie as soon as I feel
I'm capable of playing in the big leagues,'' he said. ``There's a
little nervousness. It's like spring training, a little of
everything. I'm eager to get going.''
</P>
<P>
   Much has been made of the Angels' injuries and how desperate
they are to get those players back. But DiSarcina said he won't
carry the weight of the team's troubles on his shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel pressure, but I believe one person can make a
difference,'' he said. ``It's a matter of what type of difference.
I've seen games when I know I could have made a difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``(But) I'm not going to produce like last year immediately. I'm
not going to blink my eyes and get back to that level. Every swing
is going to be a battle. Every swing is going to be ugly. Guys are
going to laugh at me, but I'm going to get the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   Olivares update: Pitcher Omar Olivares, who missed Wednesday's
start because of a strained left hamstring, will return to the
rotation Sunday against the Arizona Diamondbacks at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Omar threw off the mound (Tuesday) and it didn't bother him,''
Angels manager Terry Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   Olivares hurt his hamstring last Friday trying to beat out an
infield grounder against the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Also: Giants left fielder Barry Bonds returned to the lineup
Wednesday for the first time since having surgery on his left arm
April 20. Bonds was expected to miss 10 weeks but returned in seven
weeks. He went 0 for 4.... The Angels are off today. They begin a
three-game series at Edison Field against the Diamondbacks
beginning Friday.

GOP SEES PRIVACY THREAT IN DEMOCRATS' BID FOR DOCUMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mont.)   (bl)  
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a move that has touched off a furor on Capitol
Hill, Democratic strategists are seeking reams of official
documents in a search for grist to use against Republican senators
up for re-election next year.
</P>
<P>
   The document hunt was undertaken under the Freedom of
Information Act, a tactic that the Democrats called perfectly
appropriate but that the Republicans characterized as a threat to
personal freedom.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute became public Wednesday when Sen. Conrad Burns of
Montana, one of the 10 Republicans up for re-election in 2000,
complained on the Senate floor about a letter the Democratic
Senatorial Campaign Committee sent to the Department of Health and
Human Services on May 18 seeking copies of all correspondence
between the department and the senators from their first days in
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there are any Americans alive who think politics can't sink
any lower, they need look no further than the DSCC,'' Burns said.
</P>
<P>
   The senator said the Democrats' efforts, if successful, could
invade the privacy of countless ordinary, nonpolitical Americans
who get help from their senators in dealing with the vast federal
bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This effort is as constitutionally breathtaking as it is
politically suspect,'' Burns said.
</P>
<P>
   But Jim Jordan, a spokesman for the Democratic senatorial
committee, said the Republicans' complaints reflected ``a
fundamental misunderstanding'' of the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not impinging _ we do not want to, and we cannot _ on
the privacy rights of anyone,'' Jordan said.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that the Freedom of Information Act, passed by Congress
in 1966 and used by journalists and private citizens to obtain
official records, requires that personal information be crossed out
before the documents are turned over. A Senator's contacts with and
efforts to lobby agencies ``are a perfectly legitimate subject of
scrutiny,'' Jordan said.
</P>
<P>
   But Burns' chief of staff, Matt Raymond, said the Democrats'
document search could have ``a chilling effect'' on Americans who
need help from lawmakers. The senator himself said he was so
outraged that he wrote to President Clinton to complain.
</P>
<P>
   And a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, said Lott
was ``extremely troubled'' and would meet with Minority Leader Tom
Daschle to express his unease.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Roy, Jordan's counterpart at the Republican senatorial
campaign office, said his organization had not used the Freedom of
Information Act, at least in the two years he has been with the
organization.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan said that Democrats had used the Freedom of Information
Act before and that requests like the one sent May 18 to the
Department of Health and Human Services and signed by Alexis
Schuler, the Democratic senatorial committee's research director,
had been sent to several other agencies. Jordan said those agencies
would be notified that ``only that information which bears directly
on a senator's discharge of his or her official duties'' was
sought.

OUTLOOK DIM AS CATHAY PACIFIC AIR NEGOTIATES WITH PILOTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By WAYNE ARNOLD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SINGAPORE _ Managers from Cathay Pacific Airways and
representatives of the Hong Kong airline's pilot union spent more
than eight hours Wednesday in pay negotiations that industry
analysts said were unlikely to avoid a wave of pilot resignations
and dismissals Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Determined to cut labor costs and return to profitability, the
airline has given its senior pilots until noon Friday to accept
stock options in return for pay cuts or quit with a severance
package. Pilots who fail to pick either option by the deadline will
be dismissed with three months' pay, Cathay said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they want to leave the company, the best thing to do is
accept the voluntary separation scheme and leave with dignity and a
lot more money,'' said Tony Tyler, the director of corporate
development at Cathay Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Union officials were not available for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Many pilots have responded to the ultimatum by saying they are
under too much stress to fly. Large numbers of pilots have called
in sick over the last two weeks, and Cathay has been force to
ground up to 60 percent of its scheduled flights and charter planes
from 13 airlines to help take up the slack.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts estimate the airline is losing roughly $30 million
(Hong Kong), or $3.9 million (U.S.), a day in revenue, not
including what it has to pay other airlines to carry its
increasingly disgruntled passengers. The union has threatened to
call a strike vote if pilots are dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   According to analysts, the latest round of negotiations is
unlikely to produce any new compromise because Cathay is cash-rich
and can afford to allow many of its pilots to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Tyler said that most Cathay captains earn $220,000 (U.S.) a
year, making them among the most highly paid in commercial
aviation. The union disputes that figure, but independent industry
surveys of pilot pay are kept confidential.

NEW LOOK TO START WNBA SEASON  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JUDY BATTISTA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chamique Holdsclaw had just been made the first pick in the
Women's National Basketball Association draft last spring, and
already the technicians were scurrying around her. Within five
minutes, she was looking into a camera as her carefully styled
hair, makeup and wardrobe were beamed out for a league that will
use her to launch it on a new trajectory when its regular season
opens on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Holdsclaw's arrival is propitious for the WNBA as it commences
its third season, perhaps its most pivotal. Gone, by the admission
of the league's president, Valerie B. Ackerman, is the novelty of a
women's professional league, a newness that was exploited with
perfect pitch by the vast marketing machine of the National
Basketball Association, which created the WNBA.
</P>
<P>
   With the demise of the American Basketball League, the other
women's league, the WNBA is poised to present a level of play that
will back up the ubiquitous promotion. That is partly a result of
an extraordinary draft in which the WNBA absorbed a crop of
collegians and foreigners along with 40 players from the ABL, a
league that had a wealth of player talent but a dearth of business
savvy.
</P>
<P>
   The WNBA has expanded to 12 teams and the schedule to 32 games
this year, including, for the first time, an All-Star Game, to be
played July 14 at Madison Square Garden. Six teams will make the
playoffs, an increase of two over the first two seasons. At last,
everyone agrees, it is time for the women's game to be judged on
the talent of its players and the competitiveness of its games, not
on the business acumen of its founders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever curiosity that may have existed about the league is
long past us,'' Ackerman said. ``Now, more than ever before, people
are going to be looking to the quality of the play to determine
whether or not we really have a future. Our league is going to
stand or fail on that basis: how good a game we have and how much
fans want to support that.''
</P>
<P>
   Holdsclaw will be one of the critical players in that judgment
as she plays her rookie season for the Washington Mystics. She
comes from Astoria, N.Y., by way of the University of Tennessee,
where she was twice selected the collegiate player of the year.
Already she is being compared to Michael Jordan _ she will wear his
number _ and is considered, perhaps prematurely, the greatest woman
to play the game.
</P>
<P>
   The stars who helped build women's professional basketball might
have something to say about that. Cheryl Miller, coach of the
Phoenix Mercury, and Nancy Lieberman-Cline, coach of the Detroit
Shock, first made people pay attention to the women's game. Rebecca
Lobo, playing center for the New York Liberty, helped bring it to a
mainstream audience.
</P>
<P>
   But with the WNBA now having enough talent to complement the
star power of Holdsclaw, she is expected to propel it to the next
level, presumably a very successful and lucrative one.
</P>
<P>
   ``With myself and the ABL players, definitely in a couple of
years the players and league will grow,'' Holdsclaw said. ``I think
the sky is the limit. You have the best talent all in one league.
Of course you expect it to be two times better.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if her rookie game lags a bit, Holdsclaw's more immediate
impact will be at the cash register. Despite winning only three
games last season, the Mystics led the league in attendance with a
crowd average of almost 16,000 a game, and they hope to sell 1,000
to 2,000 more season tickets than last season. Thursday night, the
Mystics expect a sellout crowd of 20,000 as they open the season
against Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   Holdsclaw should also be a huge draw on the road, which will
help some teams that are struggling. Franchises in Los Angeles and
Sacramento have failed to average even 8,000 fans.
</P>
<P>
   Ackerman said the WNBA was optimistic about its overall
finances. All sponsorship deals will be up for renewal, because
they were negotiated for three years when the league began. She
expects the league to average 10,000 fans a game this season.
</P>
<P>
   Some teams have been doing well, like the Liberty, which has
been second in attendance in both seasons. The Liberty has exceeded
last year's season-ticket sales of 6,300 and drew a staggering
crowd of 13,690 for an exhibition game on May 22 in the Garden
against the Houston Comets.
</P>
<P>
   So confident is the league of success that it has added two
teams this season, in Orlando and Minnesota, and will expand with
four more next season. Because of the wealth of talent from the
ABL, this is not typical expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Orlando nor Minnesota _ which could select five ABL
players each while the established teams could choose three _
should be a league doormat. Every team got much better with this
draft, and the days when one team would dominate, as the Comets did
last season, are probably over.
</P>
<P>
   Close, well-played games should make the league more interesting
to casual fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think if there isn't a breakout, there's trouble,''
Lobo said. ``But this year, there's potential for that kind of
explosion. The focus isn't going to be on which is the better
league, is this hollow promotion, should women play in summer,
because all those questions have been answered. Instead, they will
focus on the play on the court.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Chancellor, coach of the Comets, the two-time defending
champions, sounded a note of caution, however. He has been a
women's basketball coach since 1978 and has watched the sport's
slow, laborious ascent. While he expected observers to be shocked
by the improved level of competition this season, he also predicted
it would take a bit longer before the league wins over doubters
about the quality of play.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to understand this: It's only our third year of
existence,'' he said. ``So many people want a miracle. Let's be
realistic. It's important to us to have a good year, but let's have
expectations that aren't so high we can't possibly meet them.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can expect an improvement. Is that going to catch on
overnight? I don't know. Any product you put out there, it takes
time for word of mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor's concerns are well-founded. When the major
professional sports leagues are listed, the WNBA is not among those
for football, baseball, basketball and hockey. It is lumped with
Major League Soccer, somewhere in the nether world of sports.
Perhaps that will be Holdsclaw's greatest responsibility as she
begins her first season: to hoist the WNBA on her narrow shoulders
and carry it to a higher level of legitimacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a year for us to take a step,'' Chancellor said. ``The
fans will be amazed at the talent of these players. You're going to
notice a difference. When the product gets out there, I think the
fans will love it.''

RANGERS MULL ROSTER CHOICES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
LOS ANGELES _ The Rangers are unsure whether outfielder Mike Simms
will be reinstated from the 15-day disabled list Friday.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Simms (torn left Achilles' tendon) completed his second
medical-rehabilitation assignment Monday, and the Rangers will have
to make room on the 25-man roster if the outfielder is to be
reinstated.
</P>
<P>
   Could that be the reason for right-hander Danny Patterson's
marked improvement of late?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it's a coincidence,'' said Patterson, who went
into Wednesday's game with a streak of 72/3 scoreless innings
spanning four appearances. ``When your back is up against the wall,
that's when you find out what you're made of.''
</P>
<P>
   Patterson, who once appeared to be the leading candidate to be
optioned to Triple-A Oklahoma to make room on the roster for Simms,
pitched 31/3 scoreless innings with three strikeouts in the
Rangers' 7-6, 13-inning victory Tuesday against Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hope it's not too little, too late,'' Patterson said.
``We'll see.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers could leave Simms on the 15-day disabled list and do
nothing. ``There's a difference between being OK and 100 percent,''
Oates said. Gonzalez ejection Plate umpire Wally Bell ejected right
fielder Juan Gonzalez after Gonzalez's ninth-inning at-bat Tuesday
resulted in his third strikeout.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, who drove in the 999th run of his career with a
first-inning homer off right-hander Darren Dreifort, dropped his
bat at the plate in disgust after the called third strike and
walked directly to the Rangers' dugout.
</P>
<P>
   Bell instructed Gonzalez to ``pick up the bat,'' said the
outfielder, who added that he said nothing to the umpire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said absolutely nothing, but that's all right,'' said
Gonzalez, who suffered his first ejection in the major leagues.
``I'm fine today.'' Unclothed appearance The Rangers' two-game
winning streak includes a streaker.
</P>
<P>
   An unidentified spectator rushed the playing surface wearing
only an unbuttoned Dodgers uniform in the top of the eighth inning
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers took a 6-4 lead into the bottom of the eighth inning
before right-hander Tim Crabtree and closer John Wetteland
surrendered eighth- and ninth-inning solo home runs to Los Angeles'
Raul Mondesi and Eric Young.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was their rally streaker,'' Crabtree said. Morgan records
first balk Right-hander Mike Morgan committed the Rangers' first
balk this season in the third inning Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan's right foot slipped out of the hole in front of the
rubber, and he delivered an awkward pitch after losing contact with
the rubber. The balk allowed center fielder Trenidad Hubbard to
score from third base.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to go grab him and keep him from crossing the
plate,'' Morgan said.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan, who allowed four runs on six hits and two walks in 32/3
innings, said fatigue played a role in his undoing. The Rangers
reinstated Morgan from the disabled list before the game, but
inactivity obviously hindered his stamina.
</P>
<P>
   ``After that 39-pitch third inning, it was a problem,'' Morgan
said. ``That slammed me. We won as a team, but I beat myself.''
Briefly On Wednesday, the Rangers agreed to contract terms with
outfielder Orlando Cruz of Jose Collazo Colon High School in Puerto
Rico, their 17th-round selection last week in the 1999 draft. Cruz
will be assigned to the Rangers' rookie-league affiliate in the
Gulf Coast League.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers stole a season-high six bases Tuesday with Dodgers
catcher Todd Hundley behind the plate. Hundley underwent major
reconstructive surgery on his right elbow in September 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' 35-22 record matches their best record through 57
games. The 1996 and '98 Rangers also won 35 of their first 57 games
en route to the organization's two American League West titles. nn

LAWYER SAYS VOLPE WOULD TAKE POLYGRAPH 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JOSEPH P. FRIED   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The lawyer for Justin A. Volpe, who pleaded guilty to
torturing Abner Louima in a station house restroom, said Wednesday
that Volpe was willing to take a polygraph test to establish that
another police officer was wrongly convicted on Tuesday of helping
carry out the attack.
</P>
<P>
   The contention by the lawyer, Marvyn M. Kornberg, who said his
client maintained that the officer convicted Tuesday, Charles
Schwarz, had not even been at the scene of the torture, added a
bitter twist to the explosive case. It stirred new rancor as both
the prosecution and Schwarz's lawyer denounced Kornberg's assertion
and offer.
</P>
<P>
   A prosecutor said Kornberg was not to be believed and suggested
he was promoting a hoax. Schwarz's lawyer, Stephen C. Worth, said
that Kornberg's claim and offer were of no legal value to Schwarz
and suggested that Kornberg was seeking a return to the limelight
in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Schwarz was convicted by a jury in U.S. District Court on
Tuesday of having violated Louima's civil rights by holding him
down while Volpe _ who had interrupted the trial to plead guilty _
rammed a stick into Louima's rectum, inflicting severe injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Two other officers, Thomas Wiese and Thomas Bruder, were
acquitted of beating Louima in a police car before the stick
attack, which occurred in a restroom at the 70th Precinct station
house in Brooklyn. A sergeant, Michael Bellomo, was acquitted of
charges that included trying to cover up the reported beating.
</P>
<P>
   After the verdict was read on Tuesday, Kornberg told reporters
that the jury had wrongly convicted Schwarz. Kornberg said that, on
Volpe's behalf, he had told the prosecutors _ several days before
his client's guilty plea on May 25 _ that the second officer who
had been in the bathroom with Volpe and Louima had not been Schwarz
but someone else. Kornberg said he had given the prosecutors that
officer's name.
</P>
<P>
   One of the prosecutors in the case, Alan Vinegrad, had responded
Tuesday that Kornberg and Volpe had no credibility on that or any
other issue. Wednesday, Kornberg answered that dismissal by telling
reporters that Volpe ``would be willing to take a polygraph with
respect to this issue of who was in the bathroom with him.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Vinegrad, chief of the criminal division of the
U.S. attorney's office in Brooklyn, made it clear that his view had
not changed. Referring to the offer of a polygraph test, Vinegrad
said, ``Comments or suggestions from the Volpe defense team _ which
tried to perpetrate an enormous hoax during the trial of this case
_ have no credibility and are not worthy of response.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``hoax'' remark was Vinegrad's critical assessment of
Kornberg's suggestion, in his opening statement in the trial, that
Louima's torn rectum and bladder had come not from Volpe's shoving
a stick into his rectum but from a consensual sex act with another
man.
</P>
<P>
   Schwarz's lawyer, Worth, also dismissed Kornberg's statements,
saying, ``The time for Volpe to have come forward with this
information was when he pled guilty in open court and on the
record.'' He said that now, with the trial over, and with only
``news stories from his lawyer about what Justin Volpe would say,''
Kornberg's statements were of ``no legal significance.
</P>
<P>
   When Volpe pleaded guilty, he did not identify the other officer
in the bathroom, and described his role as someone who only ``saw
what was going on'' and ``did nothing to stop it.'' Volpe and
Kornberg have not identified that officer publicly, but it appears
from court documents that Volpe was referring in his plea to Wiese,
who told investigators in the days after Louima was attacked that
he had walked into the bathroom just after the assault.
</P>
<P>
   Schwarz and Volpe, both now dismissed from the police force,
could be sentenced to as much as life in prison.

LOU DOBBS LEAVING CNN TO START WEB SITE THAT WILL FOCUS ON OUTER
SPACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By LAWRIE MIFFLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The day after resigning from CNN, Lou Dobbs, the best-known
business-news journalist in television, said he had no intention of
joining another television network.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely not,'' he said Wednesday, responding to speculation
that he might jump to a rival, either Fox News or CNBC.
</P>
<P>
   Dobbs, who was the anchor of one of CNN's most profitable
programs, ``Moneyline News Hour,'' and the founding executive of
the financial-news network CNNfn and its Web site, CNNfn.com, said
he would give his full commitment to his new responsibilities
involved in the start of Space.com on July 20.
</P>
<P>
   He will become chairman and chief executive of the start-up Web
site, devoted to information and entertainment related to outer
space. He also has a substantial investment in the project. Dobbs,
who has been a space enthusiast for many years, said Wednesday that
he was so eager to secure the site that he had purchased the
Internet address 18 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe space is the most exciting and biggest news story of
this year and of the next millennium,'' he said Wednesday. ``I'm
fundamentally a journalist, and can't resist the biggest story.
We'll be the category definer, the first mover, the authoritative
site.''
</P>
<P>
   As word of Dobbs' departure spread through CNN and CNNfn
Wednesday, Gerald Levin, chairman of Time Warner, &UR;  &LR; CNN's parent
company, moved to calm the troops.
</P>
<P>
   He telephoned a meeting of CNNfn's senior executive team in the
morning, saying CNNfn and CNN's financial news programming together
were a ``centerpiece of the Time Warner media growth plan for the
future,'' and the executives made sure that that statement was
distributed throughout the networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``As markets expand and trading hours expand, financial news
will become even more central,'' Jeff Gralnick, executive vice
president of CNN financial news, said Wednesday. He and David
Bohrman, executive vice president of CNNfn, will continue reporting
to CNN's chairman and chief executive officer, Tom Johnson, as did
Dobbs.
</P>
<P>
   CNNfn has about 12 million subscribers now, well behind the top
business-news network, CNBC, with 69 million. CNN reaches about 75
million homes.
</P>
<P>
   Dobbs' resignation came at a key moment for both CNN and CNNfn,
as all cable networks are in the midst of their advertising sales
season. Larry Goodman, president of sales and marketing for CNN,
said his staff had phoned key advertisers Tuesday night to tell
them about Dobbs' move, and none had canceled their orders.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people were surprised,'' Goodman said. ``But we're in
the middle of a pretty robust market now. We had three major
financial services advertisers pending, and all three closed their
deals with us today.''
</P>
<P>
   While not disputing that he has had personality clashes with
Rick Kaplan, the president of CNN/USA, Dobbs said Wednesday that
was not a major factor in his decision. He had even hoped,
originally, that he might be able to invest in Space.com while
continuing with his various duties at CNN, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the level of investment I want to maintain in this was
incompatible with keeping the job I had,'' he said. ``Frankly, a
passive investment at the end of day wasn't what I wanted. I want
active participation.''
</P>
<P>
   Going with Dobbs is Rich Zahradnik, a key executive in helping
to start CNN Interactive and CNNfn.com. He has been working for
Dobbs to develop special Internet projects for the last 17 months.
</P>
<P>
   Alluding to the fact that many people associate Web site
start-ups with young entrepreneurs, Zahradnik, who will be
president of Space.com, said that ``because of age prejudice or
executive prejudice,'' many people do not realize that Dobbs, who
is 53, is an Internet aficionado.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows it, he likes it, he uses it, he is fascinated by the
medium,'' Zahradnik said. &QL;

MACHINISTS DON'T WANT BOEING TO CONSIDER FLEXIBLE WORK WEEK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAUL NYHAN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Boeing Co. won't sit down with its Machinists to
craft a new contract for two months, but workers are already making
one demand clear: Don't stretch out their work week.
</P>
<P>
   In August, Boeing and union officials will try to negotiate a
new contract for 40,000 Machinists. The company has already
suggested altering its work schedules by adding 40-hour work weeks
that start at mid-week. The idea calls for some employees to
receive regular pay, not overtime, for working on Saturday and
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Many Machinists have rejected the idea, arguing it would disrupt
their family obligations, cut into potential overtime and
complicate their child care arragements.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a situation we are even willing to address,'' said
Bill Johnson, president of the International Association of
Machinist's District Lodge 751, referring to members' opposition to
the idea. Johnson, however, under U.S. labor law must at least
discuss the idea if Boeing brings it to the table.
</P>
<P>
   Revising schedules is only one of myriad disputes the two sides
must resolve when they begin negotiations on Aug. 15. Other
potentially explosive items include Boeing's ability to hire
outside contractors and whether union employees should pay more for
health-care benefits. The current contract expires Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing executives say they want to extend the work week to use
employees more efficiently, up to 24 hours a day, seven days a
week, when the company faces heavy workloads. The idea is part of a
broader plan to slow the growth of its labor costs.
</P>
<P>
   Officials also claim workers could reap benefits from the
change, because it could create new jobs at the aerospace giant.
More than two years ago, Boeing attempted to alter schedules at the
painting division to cope with an increasing number of planes
arriving from the assembly line. The proposal was never implemented
and the company eventually farmed out work to vendors, according to
Boeing executives.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we moved to some form of this it could result in the hiring
of more people,'' said Peter Conte, a spokesman for Boeing, the
largest airplane manufacturer in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Conte, however, is quick to point out that Boeing won't bring
any preconceived ideas to the table. And the company's chief
negotiator, Jerry Calhoun, has said the company would consider a
targeted approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to look at one area like the flight line or further
back in the factory like wing and body join,'' Calhoun said in an
interview earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Still, changes seem unlikely if the union has its way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see an argument the company can put up that will be in
the best interest of the membership,'' said Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the company should consider making better use of the
existing schedule, the union said. Johnson points out that 60
percent of Boeing's employees work the first shift, 30 percent
arrive for the second shift, and only 10 percent are employed in
the third shift.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Boeing can't fully utilize their facilities and personnel
during the normal work week, why would they be better off with a
non-traditional work week?'' the union asked in the latest issue of
its newsletter, the Aero Mechanic.
</P>
<P>
   While Boeing and its workers are bound to disagree over such
things as schedules and benefits, both sides say they are hopeful
this year's negotiations will be smoother than the last round in
1995. Four years ago talks broke down and Boeing's Machinists went
on strike for 69 days, disrupting production and angering airline
customers who were forced to wait for new airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mood is optimistic,'' said Thomas Buffenbarger, president
of the International Association of Machinists.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing would welcome a smooth negotiation, with the company
scheduled to deliver a record 620 planes this year. The company is
also striving to polish its image on Wall Street, and boost its
stock price, by becoming more efficient, which means resolving its
labor problems quickly and without disruption.
</P>
<P>
   The union, facing another two years of layoffs, is seeking
security on a variety of fronts, from preserving generous medical
benefits to preventing additional layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides also learned valuable lessons from the last round,
such as the importance of discussing flexible work weeks and other
matters in the months leading up to negotiations, according to
observers.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are more sensitive to the fine art of contract
negotiations ... on both sides,'' said David Olson, a political
science professor at the University of Washington. ``If you want to
write a scenario about (how) the negotiating process breaks down,
that one was a classic example.''
</P>
<P>
   Some employees, however, are less upbeat. David Clay, a member
of the union who challenged Johnson in a past election, said the
extended work week could be divisive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a definite strike issue,'' Clay said.

SHIPPERS CITE PROBLEMS SINCE CONRAIL TAKEOVER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By AGIS SALPUKAS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some rail shippers have begun reporting major disruptions in
service, including delayed trains and lost rail cars, since CSX and
Norfolk Southern railroads took over Conrail on June 1.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Rastatter, the director of policy at the National
Industrial Transportation League, a trade group that represents
many of the nation's largest shippers, said that he had received
complaints about service on the Norfolk Southern part of Conrail
from about six companies.
</P>
<P>
   He added that one major company, which he did not want to
identify, had warned that it might face some plant closings because
of delays in delivering materials.
</P>
<P>
   While most of the complaints have focused on Norfolk Southern,
Norman Black, the manager of media relations for United Parcel
Service, one of the largest shippers on the old Conrail system,
said that many trains are not meeting their schedules on both the
CSX and Norfolk Southern lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have big time problems with both railroads,'' he said. ``We
are very unhappy and it's not getting better. It's gotten worse
each day.''
</P>
<P>
   The company has been forced to keep employees longer at sorting
centers, which has caused substantial payments of overtime, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the company was considering moving some of the
trailers that are now carried on intermodal trains by truck
instead.
</P>
<P>
   The company had to make such a switch back in 1997 at the height
of the problems caused by Union Pacific's takeover of the Southern
Pacific railroad.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Ward, an executive vice president at CSX Transportation
Inc., the railroad subsidiary of CSX, which is based in Richmond,
acknowledged the UPS complaints.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the railroad hoped to be meeting its schedules in a
couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Both railroads took extensive measures to make sure the
transition went smoothly. They worked closely with large shippers,
bought extra locomotives, hired and trained extra crews and took
more time before they took over operations of Conrail, which they
bought jointly in April 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Don O'Brian, an assistant vice president at Norfolk Southern,
acknowledged in an interview Wednesday that some customers are not
satisfied with service.
</P>
<P>
   He said, however, that special teams set up to deal with
unexpected glitches have been working on problems as they surface.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not ready to declare victory yet,'' he added.``We're
seeing more progress every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Paulette Lauber, the rail operations manager for Sauder
Woodworking Co. in Archbold, Ohio, said that for three days last
week the company, which makes ready-to-assemble furniture, did not
receive its normal eight or nine carloads of raw material.
</P>
<P>
   She also said that as Norfolk Southern merged its computer
systems with Conrail, some cars were temporarily lost in transit.
She said that her company had not had any disruptions in production
because it had been able to also ship by truck.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think its clearing up'' she added. ``But it's going to be
longer than they thought it would be.''

COMMENTARY: HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO MAKE A NEW YORKER? 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By GAIL COLLINS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   New York's infant U.S. Senate race has no official candidates,
but it does have an issue. Hillary Rodham Clinton has fewer local
roots than a giant cactus, and her potential opponents are already
playing the carpetbagger card. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani keeps
demanding to know how Arkansas voters would feel if he ran for
their Senate seat _ a question that probably depends on how many
Arkansans have seen pictures of the New York mayor's performance in
drag as ``Rudy/Rudia.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen, she doesn't live here,'' said Rep. Rick Lazio of Long
Island, another Republican Senate hopeful. ``Everybody in New York
realizes that this is not about serving the people of New York.''
If Lazio is on the right track, voters will never get past the idea
that Mrs. Clinton's motives for moving here were not confined to
our inherent lovability.
</P>
<P>
   The non-residents Robert Kennedy and James Buckley managed to
get elected senator from New York. But both had at least tenuous
ties to the state. Mrs. Clinton would be like the victim of a
sudden corporate relocation, rushing in with a couple of suitcases
and a list of real estate brokers, leaving furniture and spouse
behind in the old house. She must understand that her lack of
connections looks a little weird, since she recently got caught
trying to transform a childhood car ride through New York into a
``visit'' to Elmira.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not really unusual for a politician to go shopping for
a winnable district in which to roost. Sen. John McCain admits that
he was so new to Arizona during his first campaign that he kept
getting lost on his way to rallies. President George Bush claimed
three different states as his home before finally settling on
Texas, where his legal residence was a hotel suite.
</P>
<P>
   Our forefathers always believed that home is where the
opportunities are. In the 19th century James Shields, an Irish
immigrant, was elected to the Senate from Illinois, Minnesota and
Missouri in succession, moving on whenever he lost an election.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of starting over is part of the American dream,''
says Donald Ritchie, a historian for the Senate. ``You make a
mistake in one place, you move and try again.'' Arkansas is the
mistake Mrs. Clinton is trying to put behind her _ it's hard to
return to the bosom of old friends when so many have been indicted.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady's status as an outsider might actually work to
her advantage in New York. This is the capital of sectional
antagonism, where people might prefer a stranger to a lifelong
resident from the other side of the state. As a Republican TV ad
vividly suggested, the residents north of Albany think of downstate
politicians as sharks swimming up the Hudson to get their money.
City residents dismiss the rest of New York as irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Downstate people don't realize upstate people exist,'' sniped
a Democratic politician from Niagara Falls recently, after
Giuliani's office released a schedule that referred to the mayor's
visit to ``Niagra.'' (This is likely to be a campaign in which
candidates are challenged continually to spell the names of towns
and identify local highways. Eventually they may follow the lead of
a current Washington D.C. official, who told reporters he was
running for mayor, not taxi driver.)
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that almost nobody in New York knows the whole
state well, and almost all politicians learn about it by running
for office. Hold a statewide election, and candidates who could not
tell a cow from a water buffalo suddenly start wringing their hands
about the plight of the dairy farmer. The Rev. Al Sharpton says he
never realized that there were white people in more dire straits
than his supporters in Bedford-Stuyvesant until he campaigned for
Senate in rural Sullivan County.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Maurice Hinchey, who hosted Mrs. Clinton's visit to
Binghamton on Wednesday, has led more than one urban Democratic
hopeful through his huge upstate district. He says most are fast
learners _ except former Mayor Ed Koch, who spent his gubernatorial
campaign trying to live down his description of rural residents
having ``to drive 20 miles to buy a gingham dress or a Sears,
Roebuck suit.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's carpetbagging problems may fade with time. The
election, after all, is more than a year and a half away. Kennedy
jumped into his race so late that he was still a registered voter
in Massachusetts when he was elected senator from New York.
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Clinton would have time to get a house, plant a garden
and watch the tulips come up before she even becomes the Democratic
nominee. By then she would have spent more time in upstate New York
than the Deputy Commissioner for Tourism, and be able to rattle off
the name of every exit off the Taconic Parkway. If she loses
anyway, there will still be plenty of time to follow the example of
Shields, and seek political fortune in Nebraska or Kansas.

ENCRYPTION PRODUCTS FOUND TO GROW IN FOREIGN MARKETS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Commercial data-scrambling technology that is made outside the
United States has become significantly more available in the last
18 months, according to researchers at George Washington
University.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers' report, which is to be presented Thursday in
testimony before the Senate Commerce Committee, is part of a
growing body of evidence suggesting that the government's efforts
to restrict the spread of ``strong encryption'' technology for
secret electronic communications have largely failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government must acknowledge that there are foreign
products, and it must concede that they are of comparable quality
to U.S. technology,'' said Bruce Heiman, legislative counsel for
Americans for Computer Privacy, the Washington-based computer
industry lobbying group that financed the study.
</P>
<P>
   The government has long imposed export restrictions on
encryption technologies, invoking national security and crime
prevention concerns. Federal officials have argued that scrambled
messages would improve the ability of terrorists and other
criminals to organize and plan illegal operations.
</P>
<P>
   The new data, though, indicate that 805 encryption products are
now available in 35 countries outside the United States _ a 22
percent increase since December 1997. Moreover, 167 products are
based on encryption algorithms considered too strong to be cracked
by even the most powerful computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In addition to the absolute increase in the number of
products, we've also found that six new countries have companies
that are now selling encryption technology,'' said Lance Hoffman,
director of the Cyberspace Policy Institute at George Washington
University.
</P>
<P>
   He pointed to companies like Cybernetica in Estonia that use the
U.S. export restrictions as a marketing tool.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cybernetica advertises: `Strong crypto. Long keys. No export
restrictions,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The report also asserts that the United States has lost its
monopoly on the basic mathematical technologies underlying data
encryption.
</P>
<P>
   For example, of the 15 algorithms now being considered by the
National Institute of Standards for a new American encryption
standard, 10 have been developed outside the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The report does not offer evidence of actual use of encryption
systems abroad. But Hoffman said researchers had compiled material
suggesting that the most powerful encryption software was now
readily accessible internationally.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm holding in my hands a computer magazine we found on a
French newsstand,'' he said in a phone interview Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The publication, Magazine Dot Net, included a CD-ROM with
encryption programs including Pretty Good Privacy and a program
called Scramdisk that includes advanced encryption algorithms like
DES, Triple DES, Blowfish and Idea _ any of which would present
formidable challenges to code breakers in the federal government.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Nordstrom Inc. moves up to the New York Stock Exchange
Thursday with flair.
</P>
<P>
   The upscale retailer will drape the exchange's building with
three pairs of 55-foot giant legs fitted with the company's
specialty item, shoes, when trading on its stock begins on the
NYSE.
</P>
<P>
   The four-story-high legs will dangle down the front of the
exchange, greeting traders and visitors to Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   The company's chairman and chief executive officer, John
Whitacre, announced May 18 at the company's annual meeting in its
new Seattle flagship store that it will trade on the Big Board
under the symbol JWN, the initials of the company's founder, John
W. Nordstrom.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of the opening bell being rung by the company's
chairman, a tradition at the exchange, Nordstrom salespeople from
across the nation will do the honors from the exchange's bell
platform. They will be flanked by mannequins sporting custom-made
clothes fashioned especially to celebrate the move to the NYSE from
Nasdaq, where its stock traded under the symbol NOBE.

A PHONE FOR THE INTERNET WITH MORE SPEED AND LESS GLARE  
(DW)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Last year, Infogear, a start-up company, introduced its iPhone,
a phone for the Web with built-in e-mail and browsing software. The
new generation, the iPhone Series 2000, is a marked improvement.
</P>
<P>
   The black-and-white touch screen is still just a quarter of the
size of a standard PC monitor, but now it tilts to eliminate glare.
The pull-out keyboard is a comfortable size for touch typing. The
new model has a second jack so voice and data connections can take
place simultaneously, and it has a much speedier 56K internal
modem. A speakerphone has been added as well.
</P>
<P>
   Like its predecessor, the new iPhone is relatively easy to use.
Connecting to the Web is a straightforward matter of taking the
machine out of the box, plugging it into the wall, attaching a
phone line and going through five screens of registration. E-mail
is just as easy.
</P>
<P>
   Infogear's idea is to have customers place the iPhone on a
kitchen counter, or in any high-traffic section of a home, and use
it with the casual frequency of a telephone.
</P>
<P>
   One drawback to the iPhone is the steep cost. The retail price
of the iPhone will be $299 to $399. But Infogear, based in Redwood
City, Calif., is negotiating with several large telephone companies
that would subsidize the unit and sell it for as little as $199,
together with monthly phone and Internet service, said the
company's chief executive officer, Ed Cluss.
</P>
<P>
   The iPhone is currently available through Big Planet
(www.bigplanet.com), an Internet service provider in Provo, Utah,
and will go into wider distribution this summer.

   TO ENTER THE WORLD OF E-MAIL, INSERT BATTERIES AND PLUG IN
</P>
<P>
   A simple and inexpensive device will now let the computerless
get e-mail, too.
</P>
<P>
   That, at least, is the thinking behind the Mail Station, a $99
e-mail appliance, the size of a small laptop, from Cidco
(www.cidco.com). Like the network computer desktops of old, the
Mail Station is a stripped-down computer with a simplified
operating system. At 2.2 pounds and 8 inches by 10 inches, it is
the size of a laptop, but its unlit monochrome screen, measuring 6
inches by 2.2 inches, makes it look markedly different. To send and
receive e-mail, you simply pop in some AA batteries (or use the AC
adapter), plug the unit into a wall jack and start typing. A list
of local-access phone numbers is provided.
</P>
<P>
   Cidco engineers threw in a 1,000-item address book that can
capture and add addresses, a spell checker, a calendar and a
33.6-kilobit-per-second modem that can also send faxes. A
12-megahertz processor and 512 kilobytes of memory may not sound
zippy, but e-mail without graphics requires no more.
</P>
<P>
   What the Mail Station can't do, of course, is surf the Web. The
intended market is people without PCs who just want to push one
button to get their mail.
</P>
<P>
   Mail can also be received at a Web site, handy for viewing
messages with pictures attached that are too big for the system.
The unit can also be attached to a printer, which will be handy
because it can't save the same number of messages as desktop
systems. It saves up to 400 e-mail messages.
</P>
<P>
   The device costs $99 when a buyer also pays $99 in advance for a
year of e-mail service. If a buyer opts for an e-mail account at
$9.95 monthly, the device costs $149. The device is currently
available only from Cidco, bundled with an e-mail account. In the
future, others may resell the device with other services.

   A VIRUS CHARTS A NEW COURSE USING E-MAIL AND CHAT ROOMS
</P>
<P>
   Another virus bent on rummaging through your electronic address
book has turned up in recent weeks. Pretty Park, like the notorious
Melissa, finds its new victims by picking up e-mail addresses that
are stored in an infected computer's address book and sending
itself to dozens of your friends and family members.
</P>
<P>
   But Pretty Park does more than spread spam. The virus _ which is
technically a worm, a file that replicates itself _ tries to open a
channel from its host computer to a chat room. If it succeeds, it
has opened a pipe through which files can be downloaded from and
uploaded to the host computer without the computer owner's
knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very unusual,'' said Steve Trilling, director of research
at the antivirus research center run by the Symantec Corp.. ``We
haven't seen anything like it.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the author of the virus is still unknown, Symantec's
engineers have been able to analyze the worm's code and determine
the chat rooms it is using, Trilling said. As of Tuesday, about 600
computers were connected to the chat rooms, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many software companies that sell antivirus software have now
added Pretty Park to their databases of viruses to block.

   DR. MOUSE TO THE ERGONOMICAL RESCUE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The latest entrant to enter the carpal tunnel battle is a mouse
that looks as if it has a pen stuck into its back. The device,
called Dr. Mouse, looks more like a World War II movie fighter's
joystick than a standard mouse, with a handle sticking up and mouse
buttons instead of a trigger.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The manufacturer, Animax International of Norway, says the
design changes the way a user holds a mouse, consequently reducing
stress on the nerves and muscles in the arm and reducing the
likelihood of several forms of cumulative trauma disorders. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Instead of the one-size-fits-all approach of a regular mouse,
Dr. Mouse comes in a small and large version, designed to fit hands
of different sizes. It is available for Windows, Macintosh and
several Unix-based workstations, and there is a USB version for the
iMac.

   A SEARCH ENGINE WITH AN EYE FOR THE EMERGING COMMUNITIES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What do inflatable sumo-wrestling suits and machine shops in
Taiwan have in common? They are the subjects of communities of
linked Web sites, communities so obscure or ill-defined that many
Web directories don't list them.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of undiscovered Web communities _ from sites devoted
to Brazilian sports newspapers to Japanese oil spills _ have been
uncovered by a new search engine, Clever, developed by researchers
at the IBM Almaden Research Center in San Jose, Calif. Clever
identifies the most authoritative Web sites on a topic by using the
information implicit in the links people place from their Web page
to others. The Clever team observed that related pages frequently
linked to the same cluster of pages; that pattern of links,
associated with the core of a Web community, is the flag the new
software looks for.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Web rings, the communities found by Clever are unplanned.
Unlike newsgroups, they spring up spontaneously as people create
new Web sites and link to other pages _ they are more like
shantytowns than planned suburbs. Clever can detect communities in
their nascent stages, even before members are aware of their
community's existence.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Clever nor the new software is ready for the market,
but, an I.B.M. spokesman, Mike Ross, said several search engine
companies had expressed an interest. A Clever researcher, Dr.
Sridhar Rajagopalan, said the ability to follow the birth and
growth of online communities might be useful for studying the
structure and evolution of the Web. SARA ROBINSON &QL;

   A $25 PIECE OF MOLDED PLASTIC TURNS A MONITOR INTO A CANVAS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the iMac looks great out of the box, but once it's covered
by Post-It notes and coffee cups, it starts to resemble other
desktops. A new product can give a desktop, iMac or not, the
curved, cluttered look of more expensive computers.
</P>
<P>
   The EEGO Desktop Environment is, despite its grand name, a $25
piece of plastic that attaches to a standard 15-inch monitor with
Velcro strips.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was tired of looking at the beige square box in front of
me,'' said EEGO's creator, C.William Smith. ``I thought there must
be a more creative way.'' The colorful oval-shaped mount has two
large corkboards for pinning up pictures and notes and an erasable
board on top. EEGO will be available at the end of June from the
www.eegomania.com site.

   A Financial Stop on the Way to Elective Cosmetic Surgery
</P>
<P>
   In the category of things-you-hadn't-expected-to-do-online, a
new entrant: a Web site where you can apply for a tummy tuck loan.
</P>
<P>
   In April, a Chicago company, Unicorn Financial Services, which
finances elective cosmetic surgery, opened a Web site
(www.howtopayforit.com) that enables prospective patients to fill
out a brief credit application. Within minutes, said Unicorn's
co-founder, Anne M. Tynion, the application is processed. ``We
believe that this system will put the patient more at ease, knowing
they're approved before they walk into the doctor's office,'' Ms.
Tynion said.

   BACTERIAL FALLOUT &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A theory of progress says that for every technological advance,
there is an unintended consequence. Some researchers recently
discovered some particularly unsavory reverse effects. Bug-zappers,
the devices hung around backyards in barbecue season, do kill flies
and mosquitoes, but they also cause airborne bacteria and
virus-laden particles from the insect's surface area and digestive
canal to rain down. ``We're finding really significant amounts on
the surface of the fly will survive,'' said James Urban, an
associate professor of biology at Kansas State, in a press release.

   A PLACE TO BROWSE WHILE WAITING FOR VAN GOGH &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Aficionados of Vincent van Gogh may have felt like cutting off
their own ears lately: the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam has been
closed for renovations since September 1998. So for those who could
not get through the spring without ``The Langlois Bridge'' or ``The
Potato Eaters,'' the museum put much of the collection on its
impressive Web site (www.vangoghmuseum.nl).
</P>
<P>
   When the museum reopens in late June, a renovated Web site will
also be unveiled, featuring a virtual room-by-room tour of the
museum, including close-ups and background information for each
painting and, of course, chat rooms for van Gogh fans, who never
seem to lack for intensity.
