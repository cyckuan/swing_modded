<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The Tokyo market's main index fell 2.05 percent on  
profit-taking today, shedding more than half of its nearly 
600-point gain the previous day. The dollar edged lower against the 
yen ahead of the release of key U.S. economic data. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 354.09 points,  
or 2.05 percent, closing the week at 16,946.52 points. On Thursday, 
the index climbed 599.08 points, or 3.59 percent, on expectations 
that the government may intensify efforts to stimulate the 
faltering economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 120.54 yen at late afternoon, up 0.06 yen from  
late Thursday in Tokyo and also above its late New York level of 
120.50 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, investors locked in profits after  
Thursday's sharp gains, in which the Nikkei index closed at its 
highest level since Oct. 24, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said high technology shares, including Sony and TDK,  
were among big losers in line with declines in similar U.S. 
high-tech stocks Thursday on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tokyo trading, Sony fell $2.30 to $91.70 per share, TDK lost  
$2.10 to $74.30. 
</P>
<P>
	Yoshihiko Kuroichi, a general manager at Meiko Securities, said  
the Tokyo market ``went too high Thursday'' and that the market 
needed some correction. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the exchange's first section was estimated at 1.02  
billion shares, up Thursday's turnover of 788 million shares. 
Declining issues outnumbered advancers 705 to 508, with 115 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was down 12.70 points, or 0.92 percent, to 1,368.42 
points. The TOPIX rose 44.00 points, or 3.29 percent, Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 8.59 to  
10,946.82 points at Thursday's close. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar remained in a narrow range in  
Asian trading, with selling interest from Japanese exporters 
offsetting bids from Japanese institutional investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Players were awaiting U.S. non-farm payrolls data for April to  
be released later today in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan warned of  
inflationary risks late Thursday, saying the declining U.S. jobless 
rate ``constitutes a critical upside risk to the inflation 
outlook.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan's remarks initially sparked a selloff in the U.S. bond  
market as investors demanded higher rates of return as protection 
against inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar ranged between 120.27 yen and 120.66 yen in today's  
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 130.22 yen, up from  
130.00 yen late Thursday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 212 10-year Japanese government  
bond fell to 1.315 percent from 1.330 percent late Thursday, 
driving its price up to 104.32 yen from 104.18 yen.

<HEADLINE> Salt Lake Games Get Safety Grant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Utah will receive $925,000 in federal  
funds to help with security and public safety for the 2002 Winter 
Olympics, Sen. Orrin Hatch announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch, R-Utah, requested the funds, which were awarded to the  
Utah Department of Public Safety and come from the Department of 
Justice Byrne Discretionary Grant Program. 
</P>
<P>
	``The federal funding will help state, local and federal  
security and safety planners to make significant strides in 
achieving a unified, coordinated plan to provide security when Salt 
Lake City hosts the Winter Olympics,'' Hatch said in a written 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Public safety will probably be the largest cost to the state and  
its cities during the 2002 Games. More than 65 percent of Salt Lake 
City's costs related to the Olympics will be devoted to public 
safety, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	Policing the games alone will cost the city $10.5 million,  
according to a preliminary report released in March. Bracing for 
potential electrical fires at the media center at the Salt Palace 
will cost $3 million, and additional, multilingual airport security 
could run $1.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The grant announced Friday will go toward three more public  
safety planning positions to focus on law enforcement, fire and 
emergency medical services related to Olympic planning, Hatch said. 
</P>
<P>
	A full-time clerk and computer consultant will also be hired to  
maintain a secure intranet Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	And Utah officials will be able to travel to the 2000 Summer  
Olympics in Sydney, Australia, in order to view the latest 
technology related to security and anti-terrorist attack 
preparations, Hatch said.

<HEADLINE> Celtics' Owners Release Earnings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The partnership that holds a 48.3 percent interest  
in the Boston Celtics announced Friday that it lost more than $9 
million in a nine-month period, although it earned $1.4 million in 
the last three months of that period. 
</P>
<P>
	For the nine-month period ending March 31, 1999, the partnership  
and its subsidiaries reported a net loss of $9.3 million, or $3.38 
per unit. 
</P>
<P>
	But net income for the three months ended March 31 amounted to  
50 cents per unit. 
</P>
<P>
	The partnership attributed the loss in part to the NBA lockout,  
which delayed the start of the basketball season from fall to early 
February. 
</P>
<P>
	In the nine-month period, the partnership also recorded an  
extraordinary charge of $2.3 million related to the early 
retirement of debt.

<HEADLINE>  Kosovo Refugee Has Baby in New Jersey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOUNT HOLLY, N.J. (AP) -- She was malnourished, dehydrated and  
exhausted after weeks in a crowded Macedonian refugee camp and a 
13-hour flight to America. But her brand new little boy is the 
picture of health. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to becoming an instant U.S. citizen, the first child  
of the first Kosovo refugees to arrive in the United States is a 
celebrity. He was born Thursday, less than a day after his parents 
got here. 
</P>
<P>
	And those parents -- Lebibe Karaliju, 21, and husband Naim, 28 --  
well, they couldn't be happier. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very happy that my son was not born in the mountains  
somewhere,'' Naim Karaliju, a farmer, said through an interpreter 
during a news conference at Virtua-Memorial Hospital, where the 
child was born. ``We were very happy because conditions (in the 
Macedonian refugee camp) were very bad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The infant, who has not been named, sucked contentedly on his  
tiny, pink fist and gazed at a succession of reporters and 
photographers seeking a peek. Karaliju said he wants to name the 
boy ``America,'' but has to ask his wife and parents first. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple were airlifted to safety from the Balkans, arriving  
Wednesday with 451 other ethnic Albanians brought to nearby Fort 
Dix. The group was met by first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and 
U.S. officials who are coordinating the $100 million resettlement 
effort of some 20,000 refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO launched air strikes against Yugoslavia on March 24 after  
President Slobodan Milosevic rejected a Western peace plan to end 
the fighting with the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army. Hundreds of 
thousands of ethnic Albanians have since fled the Kosovo province 
to neighboring countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Another 400 refugees were expected to arrive here today.  
</P>
<P>
	The first group of refugees, including 204 children, spent their  
first full day in the country settling into their temporary homes 
at the base, resting, enjoying their first hot meals and getting 
used to the surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
	Albert Kasumaj, 19, was one of the few refugees handpicked to  
speak to reporters. He said he and his family were given a choice 
by Serb soldiers: Pack their bags and get out of their home in five 
minutes, or be shot. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was terrible. You cannot imagine. You cannot feel that  
fear,'' Kasumaj said. ``I could talk to you 24 hours a day without 
stopping (about) how it was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mirsade Bejiqui, 20, said she spent four days in a refugee camp,  
but 100 people around her died during that short time. She said she 
feels ``born again'' coming to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was terrible; it was a nightmare,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Tornado Victims Look To Regroup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- Carolyn Donaldson has spent the last few  
days sifting through rubble, one of the thousands of people 
scrabbling for scraps of the past after this week's deadly 
tornadoes. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-bedroom Oklahoma City house she and her husband Lonnie  
owned for 12 years was swept away Monday evening. Instead of being 
overwhelmed by grief as she stood in its ruins Thursday, she was 
finding little miracles. 
</P>
<P>
	Like her late mother's diamond and ruby ring. Or her pet  
Dachshund, who survived a two-block flight during the storm. 
</P>
<P>
	``Come back in a couple of years,'' she told a well-wisher  
Thursday. ``I'll fix you a meal and you'll have a place to rest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Donaldson, like many others, the discovery of the smallest  
items have helped ease the trauma of losing almost everything. The 
storms killed 41 people in Oklahoma and five more in Kansas, and 
also left hundreds of others injured. Fourteen people were still 
listed as missing in Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
	The deadly weather didn't stop -- on Tuesday and Wednesday,  
storms killed four people in Tennessee and another person in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of standing in her Del City, Okla., home Thursday, Linda  
Masteller was standing on it. The house was reduced to a pile of 
wreckage that reached up to her knees. 
</P>
<P>
	Her credit cards, checkbook, even her wedding ring are gone. She  
wore borrowed pants that were two sizes too big and shoes where her 
toes stopped in the middle. 
</P>
<P>
	``After the tornado, I didn't even have my glasses. I couldn't  
see a thing,'' Ms. Masteller said, wearing a pair of old, flowered 
frames that her son found in the debris. 
</P>
<P>
	While she lost many personal effects, she did have one thing  
crucial to her identity. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have my driver's license,'' she said. ``For some reason, it  
was in my hip pocket.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Preliminary damage estimates from Oklahoma officials indicate  
more than 9,000 homes in the metropolitan area -- Oklahoma City, Del 
City, Midwest City, Moore and Choctaw -- were destroyed or damaged. 
Moore accounts for more than half that damage. 
</P>
<P>
	In 10 other counties, more than 1,500 homes and mobile homes  
were destroyed or damaged. About 8,500 buildings were either 
destroyed or damaged in Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton, who will visit Oklahoma on Saturday, has  
authorized federal funding to cover the costs for short-term 
emergency work in the state. Storm survivors in Kansas were visited 
Thursday by Vice President Al Gore, who toured the devastation and 
promised aid to rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said he was sorry for our loss. It meant a lot,'' Randy  
Murrow said after Gore departed his tornado-ravaged home in 
Haysville. ``He has to care a little if he's human.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Incredible stories of survival came from hospital beds Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
	Angie Todd, her face swollen and bruised, had a broken shoulder,  
a shattered hand and a finger that will probably have to be 
amputated. The 29-year-old woman, her boyfriend and young son 
survived after being pulled from their bathroom and tossed four or 
five houses down the street. 
</P>
<P>
	``I actually remember being in the funnel of the tornado,'' she  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some tornado survivors have learned that escaping one twister is  
lucky -- missing two is a miracle that is hard to come by. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Brown said his house wasn't damaged when a twister hit his  
Moore neighborhood in October. Now, all that is left is the bottom 
half of his bedroom closet, where he hid. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't get hit then, but it sure got me this time,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, churches and schools turned hallways into  
mini-shopping malls for residents to pick up donated goods. 
</P>
<P>
	Kimberly Taylor collected clothes for her six children, ages one  
to 14. ``Stuff may not fit, but it's something,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The school system in Moore, which lost an elementary school and  
a high school, said classes will resume Monday. The 2,200 displaced 
students will finish the last two weeks of school at a nearby 
college, another elementary school and an old administration 
building. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel strongly that in a time of crisis, one thing the  
school can offer is routine, stability and structure,'' district 
spokeswoman Susan Pierce said. ``It's important for those students 
who have suffered a great loss.''

<HEADLINE> Unemployment Edges Up to 4.3 Pct. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's unemployment rate edged up  
slightly to 4.3 percent in April as the loss in U.S. manufacturing 
jobs since the start of the global financial crisis climbed above 
400,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department said the April 4.3 unemployment rate was  
only slightly higher than the 29-year-low of 4.2 percent reached in 
March. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's unemployment rate has been at or below 4.5 percent  
for the past 12 months, the best showing in three decades, despite 
the troubles being suffering by manufacturers and farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	Job creation actually accelerated sharply in April as the losses  
in manufacturing were more than offset by big gains in a number of 
service industries from office workers to restaurant employees. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, payroll jobs shot up 234,000 in April after inching up  
only by 7,000 jobs in March, which had been the weakest monthly 
increase in more than three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said on Wednesday that  
the U.S. economy is enjoying a ``phenomenal'' performance of rapid 
growth and low unemployment existing along with low inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	But Greenspan's remarks shock up Wall Street because he warned  
that imbalances reflected by tight labor markets were likely to 
trigger wage pressures and higher inflation down the road. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors in the inflation-sensitive bond market demanded a  
higher rate of return, pushing the yield on Treasury's benchmark 
30-year bond to its highest level in almost a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, many private economists do not believe that the Fed will  
move at its next meeting May 18 to increase interest rates. They 
saw Greenspan's remarks as a warning that down the road, the Fed 
will start raising rates. Many believe that will not occur, 
however, until the last three months of this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The April unemployment report showed that jobs in manufacturing  
fell by another 29,000, bringing total job losses at American 
factories since March of last year to 402,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The severe currency crises that have pushed one-third of the  
global economy into recession have cut sharply into American export 
markets and caused the U.S. trade deficit to soar to a record $169 
billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The weakness in manufacturing included a drop of 7,000 jobs  
because of a strike in ship building. Other manufacturing 
industries shedding jobs last month were in aircraft, industrial 
machinery, textiles and fabricated metals such as steel. 
</P>
<P>
	Jobs in mining fell by another 6,000 last month, reflecting  
primarily cutbacks in oil and gas drilling. 
</P>
<P>
	This weakness was offset, however, by a huge surge of 131,000  
new service sector jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Employment for business services climbed by 51,000 while  
temporary help firms added 18,000 jobs. Jobs in the health care 
industry rose by 23,000 while restaurants and bars added 64,000 
jobs.

<HEADLINE> Macedonia: Border Open To Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- Macedonia has assured the U.N. refugee agency that  
refugees can still cross the border from Kosovo, but no one is 
arriving, an agency spokesman said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Kris Janowski, spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for  
Refugees, said the agency sought clarification from Macedonian 
authorities about the status of the border after UNHCR staff saw 
about 1,000 Kosovo refugees being barred from crossing. 
</P>
<P>
	The Macedonian Interior Ministry told UNHCR in Skopje that the  
border would remain open, but no refugees have arrived since then, 
Janowski said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, he said, refugees arriving in Albania told  
UNHCR representatives that Serbian authorities had directed them 
away from Macedonia, telling them the border was closed.

<HEADLINE> NBA Owners Approve Kings Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The NBA Board of Governors on Friday approved  
Joe and Gavin Maloof's purchase of a majority interest in the 
Sacramento Kings and Arco Arena from Jim Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
	The ownership change will be effective July 1. The Maloof  
brothers have already been exerting control over the franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	The Maloof family, which owned the Houston Rockets from 1979-82,  
purchased a one-quarter interest in the Kings one year ago for 
$37.5 million, with an option to purchase the rest of Thomas' 53 
percent interest within five years. 
</P>
<P>
	The Board of Governors also broke several draft order ties. Utah  
won a tiebreaker over San Antonio and will pick 28th instead of 
29th, an Orlando-Miami-Indiana tiebreaker left Utah, which owns the 
Magic's pick, selecting 24th, the Heat 25th and the Pacers 26th. 
</P>
<P>
	A New York-Phoenix-Sacramento tiebreaker put the Knicks 15th,  
the Suns 16th and the Hawks, who own the Kings' pick, 17th, and an 
Atlanta-Houston-Lakers tie was broken with the Hawks choosing 21st, 
the Rockets 22nd and the Lakers 23rd. 
</P>
<P>
	In the only draft lottery tiebreaker, Boston defeated Dallas.  
Boston will have 37 chances out of 1,000 to get the first overall 
pick, while the Suns -- who own Dallas' pick -- will have 38 chances. 
If neither team wins one of the top three picks, Phoenix will have 
the next pick after Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas is a Los Angeles-based developer who purchased the team  
in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	The Maloof family owns the Fiesta Casino Hotel in North Las  
Vegas, Nev., and holdings including a beer distributorship in 
Albuquerque and several banks, a transportation company and other 
businesses operating in New Mexico, Colorado and Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kings, who begin their playoff series Saturday against Utah,  
had their first winning season this year since Thomas bought the 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas restructured the team's finances two years ago by  
obtaining a $70 million loan from the city, secured by the 
franchise and the arena.

	HIALEAH, Fla. (AP) -- It took Cuban baseball coach Rigoberto  
Betancourt Herrera just a few hours to decide to skip the flight 
home to Havana and leave behind his wife and four kids.

	So once the Cuban baseball team defeated the Baltimore Orioles  
12-6, Betancourt Herrera packed his bag and walked out the door of 
the Sheraton hotel with no plans of ever turning back.

<P>
	``In Cuba the situation is precarious,'' Betancourt Herrera, the  
Cuban national team's pitching coach, said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Life is difficult -- getting transportation, housing and even  
medication. Here I have family. I decided to start a whole new 
life,'' he said

<P>
	Seven Cubans who traveled to Baltimore with the 300-member Cuban  
delegation for the Monday game missed the return flight home the 
following day. Six said they had overslept and have since returned 
to the island. 
</P>
<P>
	Betancourt Herrera, 54, was the only one to stay. He had planned  
to walk out of Camden Yards after the game along with the thousands 
of baseball fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was going to leave just like a normal person. But I realized  
I couldn't do it after the game,'' he said. ``I left my passport 
and other papers at the hotel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His escape plans were nearly foiled again. When the team arrived  
at the hotel that night, they were told they had just a half hour 
to get their things together for the return flight. 
</P>
<P>
	Betancourt Herrera grabbed his bag and walked outside for a  
quick smoke, and then kept on walking. Fearing the police might 
think he was homeless and arrest him, Betancourt Herrera hid in the 
bushes at a nearby park for about seven hours. 
</P>
<P>
	At about 10 a.m., he walked into the downtown Baltimore police  
headquarters and requested asylum. 
</P>
<P>
	Three days after his defection, Betancourt Herrera is living  
with two aunts in Hialeah, a predominantly Hispanic community west 
of Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Betancourt Herrera is surprised by the help he's received so  
far. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since the time I arrived I've been received with love and  
appreciation,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball agent Joe Cubas, who represents Cuban pitcher Orlando  
``El Duque'' Hernandez, vowed to help find a baseball job for the 
man called ``el Pequeno Gigante del Box,'' -- Little Big Man in the 
Box. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to make some phone calls for him and see that he  
obtains a job,'' Cubas said. 
</P>
<P>
	Betancourt Herrera, once a famous left-handed pitcher on the  
island, played Cuban baseball between 1965 and 1975 and was known 
for an excellent curve ball. 
</P>
<P>
	He was part of the national team three times -- during the  
Central American-Caribbean games in Puerto Rico in 1966, in the Pan 
American games in Winnipeg in 1967 and during a tour of Mexico. He 
most recently worked as a pitching trainer in a Havana province 
earning $250 a month. 
</P>
<P>
	Betancourt Herrera said he doesn't regret leaving his family and  
life behind. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've wanted to leave for a while but just didn't have the  
opportunity,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	His next step is to assure his stay in the United States and  
arrange for his wife, Marta Mesa Rodriguez, and their children, 
ages 29, 28, 13 and 7, to move to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll be lonely here,'' he said. ``Life alone here makes one  
nostalgic.''

<HEADLINE>  Colombian Rebels Free More Hostages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTERREY, Colombia (AP) -- Leftist rebels who abducted everyone  
aboard a hijacked Colombian airplane a month ago released seven 
hostages Friday, delivering with them an indictment of what they 
called the country's corrupt political system. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-five hostages, including an American, remain in rebel  
hands in the remote northern region where they've been held since 
the April 12 hijacking. 
</P>
<P>
	Colombia's No. 2 rebel group, the National Liberation Army, or  
ELN, handed over the captives to a commission that included the 
attorney general, foreign diplomats and the Red Cross. Among the 
released were an Ecuadorian nun and a Venezuelan. 
</P>
<P>
	The remaining hostages are in good health, said Attorney General  
Jaime Bernal Cuellar. The ELN gave no indication, however, if or 
when they might be released. 
</P>
<P>
	At a brief news conference on the overgrown soccer field where  
they touched down in Red Cross helicopters Friday afternoon, 
released hostages said they had been treated well. They also urged 
those still in captivity to not lose hope. 
</P>
<P>
	``I cried with happiness,'' when the helicopters arrived, the  
Venezuelan, Otto Duarte, told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	In a lengthy statement read by a freed hostage, the ELN issued a  
scathing critique of successive governments for failing to address 
Colombia's vast gap between the rich and the poor, rampant 
corruption and political exclusion the rebels say justifies its 
decades-old insurgency. 
</P>
<P>
	``Colombia's armed conflict is rooted in a structural crisis  
caused by bad governments,'' said the communique read by Miguel 
Fajardo Rojas, a university administrator. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not clear what it would take for a resumption of peace  
talks with the government. President Andres Pastrana has said he 
will only resume contact with the group once it releases all the 
hostages. 
</P>
<P>
	Most analysts believe the mass abduction was designed to  
persuade the government to give greater weight to ELN in its peace 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	Pastrana has put most of his emphasis on getting negotiations  
going with Colombia's other major rebel army, the larger and more 
powerful Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC. 
</P>
<P>
	The hostage drama began when five ELN guerrillas dressed as  
businessmen commandeered a flight en route to Bogota from 
Bucaramanga. The Avianca Fokker 50 was forced to land on a remote 
airstrip, where dozens of rebels ushered all 41 passengers and crew 
to secret jungle camps. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine hostages were released almost immediately, the majority of  
them elderly and infirm.

<HEADLINE> Jones Lawyers Seek Nearly $500,000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Paula Jones' lawyers asked a judge  
Friday to order President Clinton to pay nearly $500,000 in legal 
reimbursements for being found in contempt of court in her sexual 
harassment case. Clinton's lawyer called the request 
``unreasonable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president ``must be sanctioned not only to redress his  
contemptuous misconduct but also to deter other litigants who might 
... harbor the impression that a party to a federal lawsuit may 
willfully disregard'' court orders, Mrs. Jones' lawyers wrote in 
making their request. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal came a month after U.S. District Judge Susan Webber  
Wright found Clinton in contempt for giving intentional, false 
testimony about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky during his 
January 1998 deposition in the sexual harassment case. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright ordered Clinton to pay Mrs. Jones' lawyers any  
``reasonable'' expenses they incurred as a result of his false 
testimony and gave the Jones legal team until Friday to come up 
with the figure. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to Wright, presidential lawyer Robert S. Bennett  
said Clinton will ``object to the amount of the claim by Ms. Jones' 
attorneys, which is unreasonable and inconsistent with the court's 
order and governing law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The letter said, however, that Clinton will not request a  
hearing or file a notice of appeal and wants to bring the Jones 
matter ``to speedy closure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Jones' lawyers submitted itemized bills for $437,825  
incurred by the Dallas law firm that represented him and an 
additional $53,333 incurred by the Rutherford Institute, a 
conservative legal group that paid for some of her legal expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	The figure is significantly higher than the $300,000 amount that  
Mrs. Jones' lawyers recently proposed to Clinton's legal team 
during settlement discussions. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett dismissed the $300,000 figure earlier this week as  
``outrageous and greedy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In their filing, Mrs. Jones' lawyers insisted that the $500,000  
was reasonable. They warned that if the president objected, they 
would present ``voluminous evidence'' of ``other contemptuous 
conduct perpetrated by Clinton'' to sustain further sanctions 
against him. 
</P>
<P>
	The expenses submitted for reimbursement include:  
</P>
<P>
	--$26,500 for preparation and travel to Washington for Clinton's  
Jan. 17, 1998, deposition. 
</P>
<P>
	--At least $3,719 for Internet research on Monica Lewinsky,  
status of independent counsel Kenneth Starr's investigation into 
her relationship with Clinton and downloading and reviewing Starr's 
report to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	--At least $13,545 for legal research, conferences and drafting  
of motions for contempt of court citation and sanctions against 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	--$9,855 for preparation of statement of fees and expenses to  
submit to court. 
</P>
<P>
	The money would be in addition to the $850,000 Clinton has  
already paid Mrs. Jones to settle the sexual harassments case 
without admitting any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	John Whitehead, one of Mrs. Jones' lawyers, said attorneys who  
assisted her were not adequately paid for their work when they 
received portions of a settlement Clinton paid to Mrs. Jones 
earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as being greedy, everyone took far less than what they  
put in,'' Whitehead said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright, in a historic contempt ruling against a president on  
April 12, ordered Clinton to repay her lawyers any ``reasonable 
expenses'' they incurred as a result of Clinton's testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge now must decide whether Mrs. Jones' reimbursement  
request is reasonable and amounts to an adequate penalty for the 
first president ever to be found in contempt of court. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton denies any wrongdoing and has said he settled the sexual  
harassment case simply to bring an end to a public crisis.

<HEADLINE> 'Do Re Mi' Is a Real Musical Comedy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *An AP Entertainment Review    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Let's cherish Hubie Cram, the dreamer-schemer  
who stands at the center of ``Do Re Mi,'' which at least through 
this weekend puts brash and boisterous back into Broadway musical 
comedy. 
</P>
<P>
	They are two qualities sorely missing in these days of more  
serious, sober-sided shows. Judging from the audience reaction 
Thursday to the ``Encores! Great American Musicals in Concert'' 
version, they are to be treasured with cheers -- especially since 
Hubie is played by the brilliant clown Nathan Lane, a worthy 
successor to the show's original star. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do Re Mi'' was conceived in 1960 as a vehicle for Phil  
Silvers, who then was just coming off the success of his Sgt. Bilko 
television series. 
</P>
<P>
	Garson Kanin based the show on a novella he had written a few  
years earlier. Jule Styne, in his first show after ``Gypsy,'' 
provided the music, while Betty Comden and Adolph Green supplied 
the lyrics. 
</P>
<P>
	Styne's music, showcased in the best possible manner by Luther  
Henderson's original orchestrations, is rhythmically tough in the 
comedy and production numbers, smooth and easy in the ballads, 
including the show's one pop hit, ``Make Someone Happy.'' The 
lyrics by Comden and Green are savvy but not smart-alecky. 
</P>
<P>
	Kanin's tale is more than serviceable, particularly for a star  
who can take specialty material and run with it. Silvers did and so 
does Lane. As Bilko, Silvers played a U.S. Army con man, a role not 
unlike Hubie. Kanin's loser is one of those guys who yearns for 
respect and success, preferably both at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
	Hubie sees a chance to make money in jukeboxes, bringing in a  
trio of aging smalltime mobsters to help him take over the 
industry. Of course, he doesn't quite make it and almost loses his 
wife in the process. 
</P>
<P>
	In the original, Hubie's long-suffering spouse was played by  
Nancy Walker. Now, it's Randy Graff, who may not be as funny as the 
immortal Walker but still manages to get laughs. Certainly, Graff 
sings the role better, making the most of ``Adventure,'' her hymn 
to life-on-the-edge with her errant hubby. 
</P>
<P>
	Hubie also turns a young waitress (the vocally potent Heather  
Headley) into a star. With Headley and Brian Stokes Mitchell, as a 
legitimate music big shot, the love songs take on a fresh life of 
their own, including the appropriately titled ``Fireworks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Watch for comic cameos by such troupers as Marilyn Cooper, Tovah  
Feldshuh and Gerry Vichi. Pure musical comedy bliss. But then the 
whole show is. Nearly 40 years old, ``Do Re Mi'' has more sass and 
spirit than any new musical on Broadway this season. Too bad the 
engagement ends Sunday.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Home, Turns to U.S. Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Back from visiting the troops in Europe,  
President Clinton tended to domestic affairs Friday: a $700,000 
fund-raising day in Texas and plans for a conference on school 
violence after the Littleton, Colo., tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to understand there are forces at work in our society  
that call on us to make an extra effort to protect our children 
from violence,'' he said at a $450,000 fund-raising luncheon for 
about four dozen people in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	While Clinton said parents, students, firearms makers and movie  
moguls all should be reflecting on implications of Littleton, he 
urged people to resist assigning blame. ``Instead of saying, `Whose 
fault is this?,''' he said, ``we should all say, `What can I do to 
take responsibility?''' 
</P>
<P>
	The president also planned to survey tornado damage in Oklahoma  
during his two-day trip West. Clinton declared major disasters in 
Oklahoma, Kansas and one county in Texas after powerful twisters 
razed communities and left dozens dead. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our thoughts and prayers are with the people of Oklahoma,  
Kansas and Texas, with the people of Tennessee who also endured 
terrible storms and destruction,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Later Friday, Clinton was the featured guest at a $250,000  
dinner in Austin at the home of prominent Democrat and Clinton ally 
Roy Spence. He had canceled a fund-raising trip to Texas scheduled 
the week of the Littleton shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said curbing school violence will require the same kind  
of sustained national efforts that reduced teen pregnancy and 
helped trim welfare rolls. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is the kind of national commitment we need to protect our  
children from violence,'' he said. ``I believe more than anything 
else we need a grass-roots effort which involves every single 
American from the White House down to the smallest community; a 
national campaign that draws out everyone's commitment, all our 
resources and depends upon everyone taking responsibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When, in the wake of Littleton, Clinton set up a White House  
conference on school violence, he also urged students across the 
country to reach beyond their own cliques to understand their 
classmates better. 
</P>
<P>
	A list of participants for Monday's conference, which featured  
leaders in education, law enforcement and entertainment, didn't 
include advocates from the other side of the gun-control debate. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Rifle Association, the nation's largest gun lobby,  
said it was not invited. It scheduled its own news conference to 
announce proposals that the NRA said can have an ``immediate and 
significant impact on violent crime in America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said that in addition to encouraging parents to  
communicate more with their children and entertainment moguls to 
consider the effects of their films, the problem of youth violence 
also requires new gun-control measures. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope we will be able to avoid another fight in Washington  
between the NRA and others,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The president also voiced support for a hate-crime bill  
submitted to the Texas legislature after the murder of James Lee 
Byrd, a black man dragged behind a pickup truck by a group of white 
men. 
</P>
<P>
	``For me, as a white Southerner, the thought that a man could be  
murdered because of his race in 1999 is heartbreaking,'' Clinton 
said. ``I hope that law will pass.''

<HEADLINE> Knicks-Heat III on Main Card  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Like Ali vs. Frazier, like Leonard vs. Duran, it's  
only natural that the war between the NBA's prime pugilists evolve 
into a trilogy. 
</P>
<P>
	Knicks-Heat III, coming up.  
</P>
<P>
	For the third straight year, the New York Knicks and Miami Heat  
step to the center of the ring and touch gloves for a playoff 
tussle Saturday, Game 1 of a first-round series that promises hard 
feelings and hard fouls. 
</P>
<P>
	And, if the past two battles are any indication, perhaps some  
hard time under NBA suspension. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first two series, I guess it was a boxing match -- a rumble  
in the jungle, or whatever it was,'' Knicks guard Chris Childs 
said. ``It's hard to play a basketball game when you've got bodies 
on bodies without getting into a skirmish, but I think cooler heads 
will prevail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At least that's what both sides are hoping. Elsewhere,  
prevailing sentiment can be whittled down to one question: Who's 
going to rumble? 
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago, it was Heat forward P.J. Brown and New York guard  
Charlie Ward, a mismatch on the court that led to an even bigger 
mismatch away from it when four Knicks were suspended for leaving 
the bench. Miami won that series in seven games. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year it was Miami's Alonzo Mourning and New York's Larry  
Johnson, a blood feud that goes back to the days when they were 
teammates in Charlotte. Without Mourning patrolling the middle, New 
York prevailed in five. 
</P>
<P>
	``Guys should have learned their lessons and how suspensions  
hurt their seasons,'' Brown said. ``I'd be very surprised if there 
was any of that stupid stuff going on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's a fine line, however. When the teams last met at Miami  
Arena, a tussle for position between New York's Kurt Thomas and the 
Heat's Jamal Mashburn wound up with their forearms near each 
other's throats. They were separated before things deteriorated. 
</P>
<P>
	``Intensity is something we both play with, so we're going to  
have skirmishes,'' Ward said. ``It's just a matter of understanding 
not to go over that line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Heat coach Pat Riley doesn't expect another fight to break out.  
``I wouldn't be surprised if there was a physical confrontation -- 
pushing and shoving,'' he said. ``But I'd be surprised if it went 
beyond that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The teams are almost mirror images, even though Riley left New  
York four years ago. Riley protege Jeff Van Gundy kept the system 
when he became Knicks coach, and the similarities only lend 
intensity to the rivalry. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they call out a play, we know it and vice versa,'' New  
York's Johnson said. ``This is going to be one of the best series 
in the playoffs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York's Patrick Ewing appears ready to go for Saturday's  
opener, although his sore left Achilles' tendon will be a question 
throughout the series. The 7-footer took part in Friday's one-hour 
practice before the Knicks left for South Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	``For what he did, he looked all right,'' Van Gundy said.  
</P>
<P>
	Oddly, the Knicks have beaten Miami four straight times when  
Ewing has been out of the lineup and five of the past seven. That 
includes all of last year's series, when Ewing sat out with a 
dislocated wrist, and the final two meetings of the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks ago, the Heat took advantage of Ewing's absence to  
build a 20-point lead midway through the third quarter. But New 
York scrapped back to win 82-80, sparking a final burst in which 
the Knicks won six of their last eight. 
</P>
<P>
	For Miami, Mourning and reserve Mark Strickland will play with  
facial protection. Mourning has been wearing wraparound glasses to 
protect a cracked right eye orbit. Strickland, who has a broken 
nose, is wearing a face mask similar to the one Mourning wore a 
year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	In last year's series, Mourning wore the mask for the first  
three games to protect a healing left cheekbone. He discarded it 
for Game 4, complaining it hampered his vision. But the move may 
have contributed to last year's fight, with Mourning saying the 
Knicks took shots at his unprotected cheek. 
</P>
<P>
	Riley expects the Knicks to try similar tactics this year, and  
Mourning knows he must keep his cool. 
</P>
<P>
	``Stay on the floor, that's all I've got to do,'' he said. ``If  
I stay on the floor, we've got a better chance to win.''

</P>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Robert P. Bergman, director of the Cleveland  
Museum of Art since 1993, died Thursday of a rare blood disorder. 
He was 53. 
</P>
<P>
	During his tenure in Cleveland, the museum hosted three of its  
five highest-attended exhibitions, Egyptian art from the Louvre, 
Renaissance and Baroque art from the Vatican and Faberge items. 
</P>
<P>
	Annual attendance grew from about 450,000 to 650,000 during his  
tenure. He oversaw the renovation or reinstallation of 30 of 70 
galleries. 
</P>
<P>
	Before coming to Cleveland, Bergman served as director of the  
Walters Art Gallery in Baltimore from 1981-93. 
</P>
<P>
	Bergman taught at Princeton, Harvard University and Lincoln  
University in Oxford, Pa. 

</P>
<P>
                          *Maj. John Howard    	
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Maj. John Howard, a D-Day commander whose troops  
flew silently into occupied France in gliders to seize a vital 
bridge at the start of the Allied invasion, died Wednesday. He was 
86. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard's 180 infantrymen, the first Allied forces into Normandy,  
took the Germans by surprise in the early hours of June 6, 1944, 
and seized Pegasus Bridge. They held on until they were relieved 
later that day by troops making their way inland from the invasion 
beachheads. 
</P>
<P>
	The story of Pegasus Bridge and Howard's Oxford and  
Buckinghamshire Light Infantry was part of the 1962 D-Day movie 
``The Longest Day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Howard was awarded the Distinguished Service Order for  
gallantry, Britain's second-highest military honor, and France's 
Croix de Guerre with Palm. 
</P>
<P>
	He retired from the army in 1945 and went into agricultural  
sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The major's achievements are commemorated in Normandy by a  
bronze bust, which marks the spot where the gliders landed near 
Ouistreham. 

</P>
<P>
                           *Louis R. Ross    	
</P>
<P>
	NAPLES, Fla. (AP) -- Louis R. Ross, a former vice chairman of  
Ford Motor Co. who oversaw the introduction in 1985 of the Ford 
Taurus, which became one of the company's most successful cars, 
died May 2. He was 67. 
</P>
<P>
	The Taurus, which was conceived in 1979 and developed for about  
$3 billion, was a huge gamble for Ford because it was to be the 
basis for many of Ford's cars into the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	Ross worked through numerous delays in the introduction the  
Taurus but eventually had the satisfaction of seeing Ford recover 
from low profits and surpass General Motors in the late 1980s as 
the car became a big hit. 
</P>
<P>
	The Taurus helped Ford make gains in the large-car segment that  
had long been dominated by General Motors as car buyers embraced 
its sleeker European styling and front-wheel drive. 
</P>
<P>
	In February 1985, Ross was named head of North American  
operators and worked on improving quality. He held the view that 
Detroit automakers could no longer turn out poorly assembled cars 
because overseas car makers, particularly in Japan, put the 
emphasis on getting it right in the factory. 
</P>
<P>
	He was named executive vice president and chief technical  
officer in 1991 and was promoted to vice chairman in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	He retired in 1996. He served as a trustee of Oakland  
University.

<P>
                            *Mark Tuinei    	
</P>
<P>
	PLANO, Texas (AP) -- Football star Mark Tuinei, who helped lead  
the Dallas Cowboys to three Super Bowl championships during his 
15-year career, died Thursday after a friend found him unconscious 
in his car outside his home. He was 39. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of death was not immediately known. Foul play, alcohol  
or drugs were not believed to be involved, and Tuinei was not known 
to have had a life-threatening medical condition, Police Chief 
Bruce Glasscock said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-5, 320-pound Tuinei came to the Cowboys in 1983 as a  
free agent from Hawaii and made the team as a defensive lineman. He 
switched to offense in 1985, settling in at the crucial position of 
left tackle. 
</P>
<P>
	His protection of quarterback Troy Aikman and his run-blocking  
for running back Emmitt Smith were big reasons the Cowboys went 
from 1-15 in 1989 to Super Bowl champions in 1993, 1994 and 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuinei played in the Pro Bowl after the 1994 and 1995 seasons.  
Knee problems ended his career after the 1997 season.

<HEADLINE> Consortium Buys Control of Haiti Co. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) -- A Swiss-Colombian-Haitian  
consortium bought a controlling interest in Haiti's state-owned 
cement company on Friday, the government's first privatization 
since 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	UMAR, a partnership formed by Swiss Holder Bank, Colombia's  
Colclinker Corp. and Haitian National Cement Co., bought 65 percent 
of the cement maker's shares for $15.6 million. The remaining 35 
percent will remain in government hands. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract was negotiated in December 1997, but was never  
finalized because Haiti's Parliament hadn't approved a replacement 
for Prime Minister Rosny Smarth, who had resigned in June of that 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, President Rene Preval dismissed Parliament and  
appointed a new premier, Jacques-Edouard Alexis, by decree. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's deal is ``an important signal that this new government  
is going ahead with the privatization process,'' said Michel 
Presume, an official with a government agency charged with 
privatizing nine state-owned firms. 
</P>
<P>
	The cement factory will have a production capacity of 350,000  
metric tons a year and employ several hundred people. The 
consortium has one year to begin production. 
</P>
<P>
	In October 1997, Continental Grain and Seaboard Corp. of the  
United States joined with the Haitian bank Unifinance to buy 70 
percent of the state-owned flour mill for $9 million. The mill 
began production in December and employs about 300. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on the privatization list are the government's ports and  
airport agencies, several banks, and electric, water and telephone 
utilities. 
</P>
<P>
	The cement factory and flour mill were shut down in 1993, during  
a three-year period of military rule that ended with a U.S.-led 
military intervention in September 1994.

<HEADLINE> NATO Missiles Hit Chinese Embassy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO jets early Saturday struck the  
Chinese embassy in Belgrade, setting the two story building on 
fire. Yugoslav officials said 26 embassy staff were living there 
but none was seriously injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Fire trucks converged on the scene, which was engulfed in smoke.  
Dazed embassy staff were running about the area. 
</P>
<P>
	Police told reporters at the site that there were injured but  
there were no further details. 
</P>
<P>
	The bombing is likely to complicate efforts to reach a peace  
agreement in Yugoslavia. China is a permanent member of the 
Security Council, which the United States is trying to get to 
approve its peace plan. China had been strongly opposed to the 
bombing campaign and sided with the Serbs in the Kosovo issue. 
</P>
<P>
	China has represented Yugoslav interests in the United States  
since Belgrade broke diplomatic relations with Washington after the 
start of the NATO air attacks March 24. 
</P>
<P>
	In Brussels, Belgium, NATO spokeswoman Vicki Nielsen said she  
was not ``in a position to confirm or deny'' that the embassy had 
been hit. 
</P>
<P>
	Goran Matic, a Yugoslav minister without portfolio, said there  
were 26 people inside the building which took two hits. All were 
evacuated. Some were injured. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now I would like to see how NATO will justify this,'' Matic  
said. ``It was a deliberate targeting of the Chinese embassy. It's 
high time to end this madness. Everybody has to sit and talk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president of the Yugoslav Left party, allied with the  
Socialists in the ruling Yugoslav coalition, called the attack ``an 
aggression against the Peoples Republic of China.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``After this, the end of this century will be marked by the end  
of the United Nations,'' party President Ljubisa Ristic said. 
``This might be the beginning of the Third World War.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a commentary on Studio B radio, the station's military  
commentator, Miroslav Lazansky, called the attack 
``unprecedented.'' He claimed the embassy was intentionally 
targeted because of China's support of Belgrade's position in the 
U.N. Security Council.

<HEADLINE> Teen Pleads No Contest in Deaths </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MUSKEGON, Mich. (AP) -- An 18-year-old boy has pleaded no contest  
to shooting five people to death before his family's Thanksgiving 
dinner, guaranteeing himself a lifetime prison term with no chance 
at parole. 
</P>
<P>
	Seth Privacky will be sentenced May 27 for the Nov. 29 shootings  
of his father, mother, grandfather, brother and his brother's 
girlfriend. He entered his plea Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said Privacky confessed to systematically shooting each  
victim point-blank in the head, then calling best friend Steven 
Wallace, also 18, to help him move bodies around the house to make 
it look like a robbery. 
</P>
<P>
	The family was preparing for a delayed Thanksgiving dinner that  
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Privacky has said he was angry because his father had threatened  
to kick him out of the house. He had been prescribed 
anti-depressant medication at the time, but it was not known if he 
was taking it. 
</P>
<P>
	The father, Stephen Privacky, 50, taught fifth grade. His wife,  
Linda Privacky, 49, was a receptionist at a medical office. Her 
father-in-law, John Privacky, was 78 and lived nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	Seth's brother, Jedidiah Privacky and April Boss, both 19, were  
studying at Muskegon Community College to be teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	The brother was shot while watching television, the mother when  
she got out of the shower, the father and grandfather were killed 
when they arrived home, and the girlfriend died when she arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	Wallace remains charged with being an accessory and disposing of  
the firearm Privacky used in the killings. He faces up to five 
years in prison if convicted.

<HEADLINE> Fired CNN Producer Sues Network </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- CNN is being sued by a producer it fired over  
a story alleging that U.S. forces used nerve gas in the hunt for 
American defectors during the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
	In a lawsuit filed Friday in the District of Columbia Superior  
Court, April Oliver claimed CNN wrongfully dismissed her last year 
and said the network based its decision ``primarily on business and 
public relations concerns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A CNN spokeswoman said the network does not comment on ``matters  
pertaining to litigation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit is based on a report that aired June 7, 1998. The  
piece accused the military of using sarin gas in Laos during 
Operation Tailwind. Two U.S. defectors were supposedly killed in 
the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	CNN retracted the story about a month after the broadcast. It  
also fired Oliver and another producer. A third producer resigned. 
Peter Arnett, the story's lead reporter, was reprimanded and 
ultimately left the network because of the piece. 
</P>
<P>
	Oliver's lawsuit claims that senior management at CNN and Time,  
which published an article based on the piece, knew the Tailwind 
report was ``inherently volatile and would be particularly 
controversial and sensitive in the military community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Consequently, senior management for CNN and Time thoroughly  
reviewed and approved the sourcing and substance of the Tailwind 
report prior to broadcast and publication,'' the lawsuit says. 
</P>
<P>
	It asserts numerous senior managers also made significant  
changes to the script. Washington bureau chief Frank Sesno even 
requested ``the insertion of a chemical weapons expert to explain 
the differences between nerve gas and tear gas and an increased 
emphasis on the length, depth and breadth of the investigation,'' 
it says. 
</P>
<P>
	Oliver is seeking unspecified damages in her lawsuit but said  
money was not her motive. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a useful opportunity for me to put facts on the table  
that have been buried -- which CNN intentionally tried to bury,'' 
Oliver said in an interview. ``There are issues of honor at play 
here, and there are issues of fact seeking and truth finding. I 
want the public record restored on this so I'm not buried under a 
sea of character assassination and a sea of disinformation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Oliver also filed a countersuit Friday against retired Army Gen.  
John Singlaub, naming him as her source for the Tailwind report. 
Singlaub was among a group of veterans who sued CNN and Time 
Magazine, claiming their reports defamed them. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an act of defense,'' Oliver said. ``He sued me for a  
story he confirmed. He was offered the script to read although he 
declined. ... I think that people should understand that he 
confirmed the central ideas of the Tailwind broadcast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Oliver's suit against Singlaub details her notes, recordings and  
e-mail exchanges with Singlaub over the course of a year. Attorneys 
for Singlaub could not be reached immediately for comment.

<HEADLINE> Jazz, Kings in Point-Counter-Point  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- John Stockton and Jason Williams are  
products of different generations, different basketball 
upbringings, even different sides of the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Their games couldn't be more different and neither could their  
off-the-court reputations. Yet when the Jazz and the Kings begin a 
first-round playoff series Saturday, all eyes will be focused on 
the matchup between the past and future of NBA point guards. 
</P>
<P>
	``That should be fun to watch,'' Utah forward Bryon Russell  
said. ``You know which way I think it'll go, but that's a good 
battle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stockton and Williams downplay the matchup's importance, but  
both teams need their floor leaders at the top of their well-known 
games. Stockton is the key to Utah's businesslike approach, while 
Sacramento's high-flying offensive show revolves around Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's an excellent player, but he and I aren't going to play a  
game of 1-on-1,'' Stockton said. ``It's a team game, and both of us 
are relying on the rest of our guys to help us out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stockton is a 37-year-old veteran who has remained a star at  
point guard longer than any player in league history. Williams is 
23, almost old by NBA rookie standards but a generation younger 
than his counterpart. 
</P>
<P>
	``You play the game a different way if you came up when John and  
I did,'' Karl Malone said. ``We grew up with strong coaches and 
different players to look up to than the guys do now. It's a very 
different time, and you can see that when John plays some of the 
younger kids.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams is the prototypical street ball player gone mainstream,  
while Stockton has based his career on organized, methodical 
consistency. Stockton never throws a behind-the-back, no-look 
crowd-pleaser when a simple chest pass will do, while Williams 
embraces showmanship and daredevil play, much to the delight of 
Kings fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the way I grew up playing, and it works for me,''  
Williams said. ``I can't change my game because of the opponent. I 
have to play hard and play it my way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both pursued their basketball dreams fanatically. Williams'  
father had keys to a high school gym in West Virginia where Jason 
played for hours every day. Stockton spent so much time in the 
Gonzaga University gym in Spokane that the school made him his own 
key. 
</P>
<P>
	But Stockton is a former altar boy with a wife and five children  
in the NBA's most straitlaced city. Williams has twice been busted 
for testing positive for marijuana, and he bounced through two 
college programs before being kicked out of Florida and essentially 
having no choice but to head for the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think you see a lot of John in him (Williams), and  
vice versa,'' Utah coach Jerry Sloan said. ``But they're both very 
effective at what they do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams started all 50 games for the Kings this year, and he  
was a main reason the Kings evolved from perennial also-rans into 
the league's highest-scoring team -- and one of its most exciting. 
He averaged 12.8 points and 6.0 assists per game while shooting 
just 37 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Stockton had a quietly solid season, playing just 28 minutes per  
game during the manic schedule. He averaged 11.1 points and 7.5 
assists while shooting 49 percent, the only guard in the league's 
top 25 in the category. 
</P>
<P>
	``I treat it as just another game against another team,''  
Williams said. ``He's a great player, but in this league you have 
to face a great player every night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Malone's matchup with Chris Webber could be even more important  
to the outcome of the series. Sloan said Friday that Malone will 
likely guard the taller, thinner Sacramento star, who won his first 
league rebounding title this season and led the Kings to their 
second playoff berth in 13 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a mindset that these are the Kings of old, but they're  
not,'' Malone said. ``Webber makes them a good team, Williams makes 
them a good team. ... They've got as much talent as anybody out 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Webber, the first player in five years to average better than 20  
points and 13 rebounds in a season, appears recovered from the back 
injury that caused him to miss five of the Kings' final six 
regular-season games. 
</P>
<P>
	He practiced at full strength on Thursday and worked out Friday  
before Sacramento's late flight to Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Chris will be all right,'' Kings coach Rick Adelman  
said Thursday. ``We need him in the lineup to be successful, and he 
obviously wants to participate in the playoffs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Hornacek's perpetually swollen knee is Utah's only health  
concern. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not going to get any better until the season's over, but  
it's not getting any worse,'' Hornacek said. ``You just deal with 
it.''

<HEADLINE> Stock Investors Get On With Buying </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Low interest rates and no-show inflation can't  
last forever, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan warned this 
past week. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the bluntest suggestion in months that those two forces,  
which have done more than anything else to propel the stock market 
to unprecedented heights, might soon disappear. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks stumbled in response to Greenspan's comments Thursday to  
a bankers group in Chicago -- but they quickly recovered. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market has great respect for Mr. Greenspan,'' said James  
Weiss, deputy chief investment officer for equities at State Street 
Research and Management Co. in Boston. ``But investors also 
understand that sometimes the chairman's language is meant to cover 
his bets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rather than sounding ``a clarion call that inflation is out of  
the bottle,'' Weiss said Greenspan may have been trying to give Fed 
policymakers room to raise rates at their upcoming policy meeting 
on May 18, in a bid to cool the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors don't seem to think such an increase is likely. After  
cracking the 11,000 barrier on Monday, the Dow Jones industrials 
added 84.77 points Friday to rise to a new high of 11,031.59. The 
Dow gained 242.55 for the week and is up 20 percent so far this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors drove the Dow up by hewing to the course they set last  
month. They continued to sell technology shares, whose prices have 
soared for years on the premise that rates will remain low. And 
they replaced high-tech stocks with those of basic-materials, 
manufacturing and smaller companies, all of which have a chance of 
performing well, even if rates go higher. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said one reason for Friday's recovery was that, while  
inflation may loom in the future, especially as oil prices continue 
to rise, it isn't a problem now. They noted that labor costs, which 
comprise two-thirds of inflation, are still low. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department reported Friday that the nation's  
unemployment rate edged up a tiny 0.1 percentage point to 4.3 
percent in March, although it is still at a nearly 29-year low. 
More important, average hourly earnings grew only 3.2 percent over 
the past 12 months, suggesting that the scarcity of labor is not 
pushing wages higher. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Ned Riley, chief investment officer at BankBoston,  
believes the bond market may do the Fed's bidding. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe Greenspan can influence rates without a direct  
intervention, he said. ``He's going to let the bond vigilantes come 
back and enforce some control.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond, which late  
Friday traded at 5.81 percent, is already up more 0.6 percentage 
point from April 20, and more than a full percentage point since 
last October. 
</P>
<P>
	With the consumer price index rising at an annual rate of 1.5  
percent, the best inflation news may be behind us, Riley conceded. 
Still, he sees lots of investment opportunities in the stock 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	Struggling economies in Asia and Latin America are showing signs  
of recovery. While that could sweep away the advantage of low-cost 
imports into this country, it will also bolster U.S. exports and, 
eventually, the earnings of U.S.-based global companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Weiss cautioned against the conclusion that growth overseas  
could replace growth at home. World manufacturing facilities are 
chock-full of unused equipment and machinery,'' Weiss said, ``and 
you've got to have a lot of growth to chew through that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Weiss believes the upside potential of growth stocks, while  
maybe not infinite, is at least far from over. His picks include 
some names from technology, telecommunications, healthcare and 
entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 composite rose 12.95 to  
1,345.00, up 9.82 for the week. The Nasdaq composite rose 31.34 to 
2,503.62 Friday, but was down 39.23 for the week. 
</P>
<P>
	NYSE composite index rose 5.02 to 641.24, and rose 6.94 for the  
week. The American Stock Exchange composite index declined 0.52 to 
787.29, but rose 10.32 for the week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 2.73 to 436.11,  
and was up 3.30 for the week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wilshire 5000 index, which represents the combined market  
value of all NYSE, American and Nasdaq issues, closed Friday at 
$12.2 trillion, down $190 billion for the week.

<HEADLINE> House Probes Atlanta's Olympic Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The chairman of the congressional investigation  
into Atlanta's Olympic bid said Friday that he hopes the process 
was clean, but that his subcommittee must see all the records to 
make sure. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., chairman of the subcommittee on  
oversight and investigations, and Tom Bliley, R-Va., chairman of 
the House Commerce Committee, sent a letter to former Olympics 
chief Billy Payne on Thursday requesting all 1,400 documents 
pertaining to the bid. The documents are at the center of a court 
fight in Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to think that we're not going to find anything,''  
Upton said. ``That's my hope. But we'll see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The committee wants to determine if the boxes of records contain  
evidence of bribery akin to the scandal that has tainted Salt Lake 
City's bid for the 2002 Winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to begin to ascertain whether the regrettable events  
surrounding the IOC's selection of Salt Lake City were an 
aberration, or part of a broader pattern or practice associated 
with other Olympic site selection bids,'' Bliley and Upton said in 
the letter. 
</P>
<P>
	The Atlanta Journal-Constitution has been fighting to open the  
records. On Wednesday, the Georgia Amateur Athletics Foundation, a 
private group holding the records, filed suit seeking a ruling that 
the documents do not fall under Georgia's Open Records Act. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit was prompted by Georgia Attorney General Thurbert  
Baker, who said the refusal to make the documents available to the 
public lends credence to the belief that the GAAF has something to 
hide. 
</P>
<P>
	The athletics foundation, created by Payne in 1987 to bid for  
the Olympics, says the documents are the property of a group of 
private citizens. 
</P>
<P>
	But Baker says the records must be opened because Atlanta's  
Olympic efforts involved a partnership between government and 
private interests. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee Echols, a spokesman for Olympic organizers, said they will  
cooperate fully with the subcommittee's request. 
</P>
<P>
	``We welcome this inquiry because we have always said we would  
work closely with any government inquiry about the Atlanta games,'' 
he said. ``Frankly we think this may be a more thorough and 
objective forum through which to set the record straight about the 
Atlanta Games and perhaps keep some of the lawyers and news media 
at bay.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the organizers do not comply with the request, the committee  
could subpoena the records, Upton said. Some of the documents could 
be made public if the committee decides it is necessary to hold a 
hearing on the Olympic bid process, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Upton said the subcommittee wants to identify whether there were  
illegal bribes to or excessive spending on International Olympic 
Committee members. If so, he said, he wants legislation to prevent 
a similar occurrence. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're looking to see if the current law works and to see if it  
needs modifications or amendments,'' he said. ``That's the purpose 
of our subcommittee.''

<HEADLINE> Meadowlands Racetrack Wins Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- The Meadowlands Racetrack can bar a  
driver or trainer who is licensed by the state racing commission, a 
state appeals court has ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision by Judges Stephen Skillman and Paul Levy in a case  
involving driver George Brennan marks the first time the appeals 
court has said that a public racetrack has the same common law 
rights as a private racetrack to eject an individual. 
</P>
<P>
	In making the ruling, which was announced Thursday, the judges  
also noted that barring an individual for integrity concerns is 
different than licensing by the state racing commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney Bill Wilson, who represents Brennan, called the ruling  
unconscionable and said it would be catastrophic if it were allowed 
to stand, noting that Brennan was not afforded due process in being 
denied the right to work. The ruling will be appealed to the state 
Supreme Court next week on an emergent basis, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Brennan, the nation's leading driver this year, and two other  
drivers were suspended for six months by the state racing 
commission for unsatisfactory drives in a race at Freehold Raceway 
on March 10. 
</P>
<P>
	A state appellate court granted a stay of his suspension.  
Officials at the Meadowlands Racetrack met briefly with Brennan to 
discuss the race and decided on April 26 to suspend his driving 
privileges and bar him because of integrity concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	Brennan appealed that ruling and the case eventually went to  
Levy and Skillman. 
</P>
<P>
	``We perceive no reason why a racetrack which is operated by a  
public entity should have a more circumscribed right than a private 
racetrack to determine who may participate in racing at its 
track,'' the judges wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	``In view of the breadth of a racetrack's common law right of  
exclusion of a racing participant, we are unable to conclude that 
appellant has a reasonable probability of ultimate success on the 
merits of an appeal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson insisted that the Meadowlands does not have the authority  
to deny Brennan his driving privileges. 
</P>
<P>
	``What this judge is saying is that a state racing association  
does not have to follow a ruling of an appellate division or of the 
racing commission,'' Wilson said. ``I would think it does.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brennan also is contesting a six-month license suspension and  
$500 fine handed down on April 10 by the New Jersey Racing 
Commission based on his drive of My Dream Come True in the third 
race at Freehold Raceway. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commission ruled that ``the drive was unsatisfactory due to  
a lack of effort'' and cited its rules against ``fraudulent or 
unsatisfactory driving'' and ``conduct detrimental to the sport.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brennan received a stay from the Appellate Court of the Racing  
Commission's license suspension. 
</P>
<P>
	Drivers Jim Morrill Jr. and Howard Parker, whose licenses were  
also suspended by the New Jersey Racing Commission for the same 
Freehold race, withdrew their appeals and are serving their 
suspensions.

<HEADLINE> Picking Up in Tenn. After Storms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LINDEN, Tenn. (AP) -- Debbie Chandler remembers the deadly storm  
arriving, a ``wall of water and a big, loud racket'' -- and then it 
was gone, just like that. 
</P>
<P>
	Swift though it was, it left destruction from Memphis to  
Nashville. Four people were killed, more than 50 were injured and 
tens of thousands were left in the dark. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm mad but I don't know who to be mad at,'' Chandler said  
Thursday, surveying the remnants of a home near her office where 
two people died. ``These were good people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The storm system moved into west Tennessee on Wednesday night  
and raced east toward Nashville, leveling houses, splintering trees 
and downing power lines before it blew out of the state early 
Thursday. Thirty counties reported damage and hundreds of people 
were left homeless. 
</P>
<P>
	The tiny town of Linden, 70 miles southwest of Nashville, was  
among the hardest hit. Three people were killed, six were injured 
and the community of 1,300 lost power. 
</P>
<P>
	``A town like Linden is so small that when someone dies everyone  
grieves,'' said Gail Moore, the town recorder. 
</P>
<P>
	Hollis Hinson, a Perry County trustee for at least 20 years, and  
his girlfriend Patti Haston, a teacher at nearby Lobelville 
Elementary School, died when strong winds literally rolled his home 
down a hill. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all liked him and we'll truly miss him,'' said a tearful  
Joyce Marshall, who worked in the county courthouse with Hinson. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Haston was the mother of Indiana University basketball  
forward Kirk Haston, a former Perry County High School standout. 
She drove six hours to Bloomington, Ind., to see each of his home 
games, said Linden Elementary School Principal Janie Burkett, Ms. 
Haston's sister-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
	Two miles away, 14-year-old Brandi Mathis was killed when her  
three-story home was reduced to rubble. 
</P>
<P>
	Her father was sucked out and landed in the yard, but he and  
Brandi's mother were unhurt. When they could not find Brandi, about 
35 people began a frantic search for the girl. They found her body 
five hours later. 
</P>
<P>
	Capt. Gary Rogers of the Perry County Rescue Squad, said it was  
painful to see Brandi's father searching for his daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's one of those things where a parent doesn't need to be  
there when they find her,'' he said. ``But under the circumstances, 
as a parent myself, no one could have dragged me away from there 
either.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Madison County, where tornadoes killed six people in January,  
Patrick Luke, 38, of Medon died when his pickup truck hit a tree 
that had fallen across a road. 
</P>
<P>
	In Nashville, 50,000 Nashville Electric Service customers lost  
power and public schools were closed on Thursday. The morning 
commute was slowed by scores of darkened traffic lights and 
numerous downed trees. Most customers had their power back by 
midday. 
</P>
<P>
	About 70 people were left homeless in Gallatin, just northeast  
of Nashville, when the storm destroyed three buildings and damaged 
three at an apartment complex. 
</P>
<P>
	Memphis suffered little damage from the storm, but 14,000  
customers were without power Thursday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Cecil Whaley, director of natural hazards for the Tennessee  
Emergency Management Agency, estimated it will take about five days 
for all power to be restored and much longer for the cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're looking at millions of dollars in property damage,'' he  
said.

<HEADLINE> Delta Upholds Pilot Sleep Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Delta Air Lines pilots may soon be resting easier  
on long flights. 
</P>
<P>
	The carrier said Friday it has upheld one pilot's decision to  
cut short a 14-hour flight to Japan because his relief pilots had 
trouble sleeping in cramped quarters they dubbed ``the coffin.'' 
The airline also is working on a design for a larger bunk area. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue became public after Capt. Roscoe McMillan landed his  
MD-11 in Portland, Ore., on April 7 rather than continue on from 
Atlanta to Tokyo. The 110 passengers were transferred to another 
flight. 
</P>
<P>
	Delta spokesman Bill Berry said the carrier interviewed McMillan  
and other crew members as part of a standard investigation into any 
disrupted flight. 
</P>
<P>
	``The end result is that we support the captain. He said he took  
the action because he didn't think his relief pilots would be as 
sharp as they should be,'' Berry said. ``He said it was based on 
safety concerns, and safety comes first.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 59-year-old McMillan, who has more than 30 years experience  
with Delta, faced a reprimand or even dismissal if the carrier's 
management had decided he diverted the plane as a protest. He said 
he landed the plane because the two relief crew members said they 
didn't get sufficient sleep. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilot, due to retire in less than a year, didn't immediately  
return a phone call Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Berry said McMillan has continued his normal flying schedule  
since the landing, and there have been no other problems on the 
Tokyo flight, Delta's longest nonstop service. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Delta managers have met with pilots about the  
sleeping compartment and engineers have submitted drawings to 
manufacturers for a larger chamber, Berry said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Line Pilots Association, representing Delta's 9,000  
pilots, filed a grievance about the sleep module. A taped phone 
message to its members Friday said the grievance is still pending, 
but ``management has agreed to consider alternative facilities,'' 
which the union will review. 
</P>
<P>
	The union says the snug bunk-bed units have too little room,  
lack privacy and allow too much outside noise to filter in. They 
are located between the cockpit and the business-class section and 
are blocked off by a 2-inch-thick curtain. 
</P>
<P>
	Delta had shrunk the MD-11 sleeping space five months ago to  
make more room for higher-paying business-classpassengers. The new 
modules replaced one the pilots called ``the condo'' because it was 
spacious, quiet and private. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal regulations require airlines to provide on-board  
sleeping quarters for pilots on flights of 12 hours or more. A crew 
of four alternates at the controls. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Hall, chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board,  
called a unionsafety official recently to ask about the situation 
and dispatched an NTSB member to Atlanta on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	NTSB spokesman Ted Lopatkiewicz said the board hasn't taken a  
position on the module but wanted to gather information on whether 
it contributed to pilot fatigue. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have an interest in fatigue in all modes of  
transportation,'' he said Friday.

<HEADLINE> GOP Tries for Tax Relief in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With little cash available for significant tax  
cuts in 2000, Republicans in Congress are focusing on a phased-in 
approach that promises huge tax relief in the future -- and they 
hope it won't escape voters' attention. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think our commitment to reduce the tax burden on all  
taxpayers is a worthy goal,'' said Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., who 
ranks No. 3 in Senate leadership. ``I don't think there's a penalty 
to be paid because we don't do enough the first year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike last year's ``April surprise,'' the Congressional Budget  
Office will not raise projections for this year's budget surplus 
until July 1 at the earliest, a spokesman said. That dashes GOP 
hopes for an immediate infusion of cash for election-year tax cuts, 
particularly important as Yugoslavia war costs rise. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's zip for 2000,'' said Rep. Jennifer Dunn, R-Wash., a  
member of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, Senate Republicans met behind closed doors  
Thursday to discuss proposals ranging from cuts in capital gains 
taxes to relief from the so-called marriage penalty in which many 
two-earner couples pay more income taxes than if single. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., chairman of the Senate Budget  
Committee, said he told the group that tax relief totaling about 
$15 billion was possible for 2000. But others said it would be a 
mistake to concentrate on small-bore cuts, preferring to push hard 
for a huge 10-year cut of nearly $800 billion even if its full 
impact is delayed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to focus on the total amount, not a token tax cut,''  
said Sen. Rod Grams, R-Minn. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans began the year touting broad tax relief such as a 10  
percent across-the-board income tax cut, but there are now 
obstacles even to modest relief. First, the budget surplus for the 
next few years is driven by Social Security funds, money both 
parties have promised not to touch. 
</P>
<P>
	There is also a reluctance to cut government programs already  
strapped by caps on spending and the unknown future costs of the 
conflict over Kosovo. But the GOP is determined not to give up on 
its signature political issue, even if a major tax cut must be 
phased in slowly over the next decade as the non-Social Security 
budget surplus grows. 
</P>
<P>
	They are scouring the budget for ways to offset the costs of tax  
relief in the early years, including serious consideration of 
President Clinton's proposals to close several corporate tax 
shelters. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're looking to see where there are opportunities to raise  
revenues so we can give the working people a tax cut,'' said Sen. 
William Roth, R-Del., chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. 
``We want to give as large a tax cut as we can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the House, Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer,  
R-Texas, has asked the committee's members to each submit three tax 
relief ideas to lay groundwork for a tax bill likely to move 
through the panel in July. 
</P>
<P>
	Most lawmakers believe it will include several items that appeal  
to specific groups as well as extend popular expiring business 
provisions. Clinton took a similar approach in his tax plan with 
proposals such as credits for stay-at-home parents, breaks for the 
steel industry and credits for buyers of fuel-efficient cars. 
</P>
<P>
	Mack unveiled a bill Thursday that embraces several GOP  
priorities: phasing out estate taxes, cutting capital gains tax 
rates, increasing the standard income tax deduction for married 
couples and singles and making the soon-to-expire business research 
and development tax credit permanent. 
</P>
<P>
	Total cost over five years is roughly $140 billion -- partly  
because capital gains tax cuts actually raise money as investors 
sell more securities -- but it balloons to about $750 billion over 
10 years once all the provisions kick in. 
</P>
<P>
	It doesn't appear there will be much Democratic help in passing  
a GOP-crafted bill. ``I frankly doubt that we are likely to support 
what they're going to produce,'' said House Minority Leader Dick 
Gephardt, D-Mo.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Cautious on Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SINGAPORE (AP) -- Recent rallies on Asia's financial markets have  
gone beyond real economic improvements in crisis-hit countries, 
Singapore Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The change in mood on financial markets exaggerates the change  
in the underlying real economies,'' Lee said during a luncheon 
speech to European business representatives in Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
	Markets around the region have rocketed up by as much as 20  
percent to 30 percent in the past month, leading some to speculate 
that the Asian economic crisis that hit in 1997 is bottoming out 
and perhaps nearing an end. 
</P>
<P>
	Commenting specifically on the Singapore stock market's 40  
percent surge over the past six months, he said, ``I don't think 
the fundamentals of the economy have changed that drastically ... 
Either it was undervalued then, or it is overvalued now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Lee said, the region's economies still have their  
underlying strengths. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we strip away the froth, the fundamentals which supported  
two decades of high growth in Asia have not disappeared -- a sturdy 
work ethic, skilled and disciplined work forces, and an 
entrepreneurial culture,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``In time, these strengths will grow and enable the countries to  
grow and progress again,'' Lee said.

<HEADLINE> Sailor Gets Kick to Finish Line </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) -- Giovanni Soldini, whose yacht Fila  
slowed to a crawl in light winds for several days nearing the 
finish of the 27,000-mile Around Alone yachting race, got a kick to 
the line late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Italian sailor was cruising along at 16 knots and expected  
to cross the finish line off the Charleston Harbor jetties about 
midnight Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	He had been had been expected in port earlier in the week, but  
was slowed by high pressure and light winds as he crawled along for 
several days at 6-8 knots. 
</P>
<P>
	Soldini would become the first non-Frenchman to win the event in  
the five times it has been run. Despite the delay of the last few 
days, the finish also was expected to be a record for the 
single-handed sailing event. 
</P>
<P>
	His projected time was about 118 days, about three days faster  
than the record set by Christophe Auguin in 1991 when the race was 
known as the BOC Challenge. 
</P>
<P>
	Frenchman Marc Thiercelin, with the only other 60-foot boat  
still in the race, was about 250 miles behind Soldini but more than 
11 days back in the overall standings. He was expected to finish 
late Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the smaller, 50-foot boat division, Mike Garside led  
Frenchman J.P. Mouligne by about 285 miles and was about 690 miles 
from the finish late Friday. Mouligne won the three previous legs 
and is the apparent winner of the division. 
</P>
<P>
	The skippers were among 16 boats that left Charleston last  
September for the race that included stopovers in Cape Town, South 
Africa; Auckland, New Zealand; and Punta del Este, Uruguay. 
</P>
<P>
	The highlight of Soldini's race was a daring rescue of French  
sailor Isabelle Autissier in the frigid, rolling waters of the 
Southern Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
	Autissier's yacht PRB was sailing in 20-knot winds when the  
automatic pilot malfunctioned. The boat turned on its side and then 
flipped completely. 
</P>
<P>
	The vessel was supposed to right itself, but it never did and  
Autissier had only seconds to close the water-tight hatch of the 
cabin. 
</P>
<P>
	She settled down to wait for rescue as Soldini battled for 200  
miles through 40 mph winds and waves as high as 30 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	He found the overturned yacht but saw no sign of Autissier. But  
then he tossed a hammer at the hull and she quickly emerged from an 
escape hatch.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Visiting Suspect N. Korea Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A U.S. team of technical experts will visit an  
underground construction site in North Korea on May 18 in hopes of 
determining whether nuclear weapons are being produced there, the 
State Department said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The purpose of the visit is to remove fully U.S. concerns  
about the nature of the site and about the activities there,'' 
spokesman James P. Rubin said. 
</P>
<P>
	After lengthy negotiations, North Korea agreed in March to allow  
American inspectors to visit the site. The Clinton administration 
maintains that a 1994 U.S.-North Korean agreement bars North Korea 
from developing nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Pyongyang has denied that the activities at the site are  
nuclear-related. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin also announced that South Korean Foreign Minister Hong  
Soon-young will visit Washington May 13-17 to meet with senior U.S. 
officials at the invitation of Secretary of State Madeleine 
Albright.

<HEADLINE> Players Confident Bird Will Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Should he stay or should he go?  
</P>
<P>
	According to Indiana Pacers coach Larry Bird, the answer to that  
question lies in the hands of his players. 
</P>
<P>
	As the team embarks on another playoff run, rumors about Bird's  
future with the team have begun to swirl. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, when Bird led the Pacers to a franchise-record 58  
victories and was named NBA coach of the year, there was 
speculation he might step aside from his new $4.5 million job and 
take a front-office position with his home-state team. 
</P>
<P>
	Those rumors proved false, but it was almost inevitable they  
would resurface this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pacers say there's nothing to it.  
</P>
<P>
	``Larry told me he would be here three years. My assumption is  
that he will,'' Pacers president Donnie Walsh said. 
</P>
<P>
	All Bird will say is he'll let the players determine his future.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to get into this, because it's the players' team  
and they have a great opportunity to do something nice (in the 
playoffs), probably the best they'll ever have,'' Bird told The 
Indianapolis Star. ``I want all the focus to be on the team. It has 
nothing to do with me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bird's contract to coach expires after the 1999-2000 season.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's never been an item of discussion between Larry and I,''  
Walsh said. ``After the third year, I don't know. I would hope he 
would stay here forever, but he's a man with options.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If it's up to the players, the matter already is settled.  
</P>
<P>
	``That explains our lack of concern, because we know how we feel  
about him,'' Mark Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly we want him back. We want to be in a situation where  
we're defending a title with him. That would be ideal. But he's 
done a great job and he's a joy to play for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Pacers, eliminated by Chicago in the Eastern Conference  
finals last year, won the Central Division regular-season 
championship and open the playoffs at home on Sunday in a best-of-5 
first-round series against Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	Bird said he enjoys his job, even though his quiet courtside  
demeanor might suggest otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
	``People look at me and say, `He doesn't show any emotion.' Hey,  
that's bull,'' Bird said. ``They don't know me. If the fans want a 
guy running up and down the sideline screaming ... I'm not going to 
do that.''

<HEADLINE> 'Jenny Jones Show' Found Negligent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- A jury decided today that ``The Jenny  
Jones Show'' was negligent in the slaying of a gay guest who 
admitted a crush on another man, ordering the producers to pay more 
than $25 million in damages. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury of five women and four men debated for just under seven  
hours before returning the verdict in its second day of 
deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Amedure's family had argued that a mentally ill Jonathan  
Schmitz was lured onto the talk show in 1995 believing he would 
meet a woman, and was humiliated into murder when his secret 
admirer turned out to be Amedure. Schmitz has said he is 
heterosexual. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for Warner Bros., the show's owner, argued Schmitz was  
told his secret admirer could be a man or woman, and the show 
played no role in Amedure's death. They also contend Schmitz might 
have killed Amedure because the two had a sexual encounter, a 
charge plaintiffs attorney Geoffrey Fieger denied. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides funeral expenses, jurors awarded $5 million in damages  
for Amedure's suffering before he was killed, $10 million to the 
family for the loss of their loved one's companionship, and $10 
million for the loss of money Amedure would have earned. 
</P>
<P>
	Feiger had urged jurors to award $71.5 million in damages.  
</P>
<P>
	Before reaching the verdict, jurors watched the taped show, with  
Amedure, 32, talking about a sexual fantasy involving Schmitz and 
Schmitz's reaction when the fantasy is shown to him -- he buries his 
face in his hands. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said Schmitz bought a shotgun, drove to Amedure's  
trailer in Oakland County's Orion Township and shot him twice in 
the chest three days after the taping. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmitz was found guilty of murder in 1996, but his conviction  
was thrown out on appeal. His retrial is set for Aug. 19. His 
lawyers admitted he killed Amedure but contended the show 
humiliated Schmitz and he was fighting alcoholism, depression and a 
thyroid condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Jones attended Wednesday's closing arguments, her first  
visit to the courtroom since she sparred with Fieger on the witness 
stand in April. 
</P>
<P>
	``They solicited a victim. They picked a murderer and provided a  
motive,'' Fieger said of the show's staffers. ``They did everything 
in this case except pull the trigger.''

<HEADLINE> NL Umpire `Heartened' by Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Just 11 weeks after quintuple bypass surgery, NL umpire Wally  
Bell returned to work Friday night when the Atlanta Braves played 
at San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	Stationed at second base, he had a play right away, calling out  
Atlanta's Andruw Jones on a steal attempt in the first inning. 
</P>
<P>
	``Excited? Yes,'' Bell said by telephone before the game. ``But  
what I'm really excited about is being able to work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bell, 34, was only 2 1/2 weeks away from leaving for spring  
training when his heart problem was detected. 
</P>
<P>
	``The doctors said that if I had gone to spring training and  
worked in the heat, I might've checked out,'' Bell said last week. 
``Dead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bell had surgery on Feb. 18 near his home in Boardman, Ohio.  
Doctors told him genetics were a major cause of his trouble, 
although an umpire's lifestyle of constant travel, late meals and 
stressful conditions also contributed. 
</P>
<P>
	Bypass patients often take about 3 1/2 months to get back to work.  
Bell changed his diet, stuck to his rehabilitation plan and was 
able to return ahead of schedule -- cleared by his doctors, of 
course. 
</P>
<P>
	``I worked hard at this,'' said Bell, who sports an 8-inch scar  
down the middle of his chest. 
</P>
<P>
	Plus, he added, there was the support of ``my two families.'' It  
came from his wife, Vickie -- expecting their first child in August 
-- and his relatives, along with encouragement from all the umpires. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell was to work with crew chief Bruce Froemming, Mark  
Hirschbeck and Hunter Wendelstedt in the game between the Braves 
and Padres. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the day, Bell played golf with his partners. Later,  
he went with Froemming and Hirschbeck to talk baseball with kids. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be great to see him out there,'' Hirschbeck said.  
``Sure, you'll watch him the first couple of times he runs, that's 
natural. But the anxiety, the nervousness, that will all go away 
after the first couple of days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said Froemming: ``You certainly don't think of something like  
that happening to a person as young as Wally is. It's always nice 
to see someone come back from that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bell is in his seventh year on the NL staff. He was originally  
supposed to work his first game this season on April 5, the Randy 
Johnson vs. Kevin Brown matchup at Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	He watched part of that game from his living room, knowing he  
was not yet ready. Now, he's prepared to return, both physically 
and mentally. 
</P>
<P>
	As in, he's set for the booing from fans, the complaining by  
players and managers -- and the razzing by his fellow umps. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad he's back because I need someone I can beat in  
backgammon and golf,'' Hirschbeck said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hey, it's like opening day for him,'' Froemming said. ``We've  
all been out here working.''

	Milosevic Opens Door to Peace Talks  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Yugoslav President Slobodan  
Milosevic has signaled he's ready to discuss a peace deal for 
Kosovo after Russia and Western powers agreed to broad outlines of 
a settlement, but he insists NATO must first stop the bombing. 
Yugoslavia's state-controlled Tanjug news agency today reiterated 
that NATO must first stop bombing Yugoslav targets before the plan 
is negotiated and passed by the U.N. Tanjug said the agreement was 
``only the start of a very lengthy and complex process which will 
probably end successfully.'' Meanwhile, NATO jets struck again 
overnight, hitting the airport in Nis, Serbia's second-largest 
city, and the city's industrial zone.

	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Three U.S. soldiers freed by  
Yugoslavia after a month in captivity headed home with their 
families on separate flights this morning after completing 
debriefing and medical tests at a military hospital in Germany. The 
servicemen departed Frankfurt International Airport said a 
spokeswoman at the U.S. military's Landstuhl Regional Medical 
Center. Spc. Steven M. Gonzales is headed back to Houston, Staff 
Sgt. Andrew A. Ramirez to Los Angeles, and Staff Sgt. Christopher

	Unemployment Edges Up to 4.3 Pct.  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's unemployment rate edged up  
slightly to 4.3 percent in April as the loss in U.S. manufacturing 
jobs since the start of the global financial crisis climbed above 
400,000. The Labor Department said the April 4.3 percent 
unemployment rate was only slightly higher than the 29-year-low of 
4.2 percent reached in March. The nation's unemployment rate has 
been at or below 4.5 percent for the past 12 months, the best 
showing in three decades, despite the troubles being suffering by 
manufacturers and farmers.

Labor had won 56 seats and some 40 percent of the vote, compared to 
28 seats and 30 percent for the independence-seeking Scottish

guerrilla leaders, the defense ministry said today. Hun Sen issued 
the order yesterday at a Cabinet meeting, said Prince Sisowath 
Sirirath, one of the country's co-defense ministers. Hun Sen said 
Kaing Khek Iev -- the notorious Khmer Rouge prison chief known as

a broken hip early last month and had been discharged. However, 
complications developed and he reentered Lenox Hill Hospital about 
four weeks ago. The cause of death was attributed to complications 
from a blood disease, the Jets said. Hess, who made his fortune as 
an oil tycoon, was in a group that bought the Jets of the American 
Football League in 1963, when they were the New York Titans.

<HEADLINE> White Woman Wins Race Bias Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST BLOOMFIELD TOWNSHIP, Mich. (AP) -- A federal jury awarded  
$2.6 million to a white woman who said PepsiCo Inc. passed her over 
for a management promotion in favor of a less-qualified black man. 
</P>
<P>
	``The jury saw that Pepsi had broken the law. It wasn't about  
black and white, it was about race discrimination in the 
workplace,'' said Patricia Steffes, 46, who won the damages 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	PepsiCo spokesman Larry Jabbonsky said the company will appeal.  
``We continue to believe Mrs. Steffes' allegations have no merit,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jabbonsky said Mrs. Steffes was not qualified for the higher job  
because she lacked sales and ``front-line management'' experience. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Steffes had worked her way up from payroll clerk to a  
$73,000-a-year management position when she applied for the higher 
post. 
</P>
<P>
	She said that after she complained about being denied the  
promotion, her superiors retaliated. 
</P>
<P>
	``They became very critical of her performance,'' said her  
lawyer, David Szymanski. ``They tried to transfer her to another 
part of the state.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She later quit.

<HEADLINE> Dow Closes at Record 11,031.59 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks surged higher in late trading today,  
taking the Dow Jones industrial average to a new closing high, 
after a government jobs report tempered investors' concerns about 
higher interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	At the close on Wall Street, the Dow was up 84.77 to 11,031.59,  
surpassing the closing high of 11,014.69 reached Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mostly higher after seesawing  
earlier in the session. Some strength on technology shares, which 
had been battered for most of this week, lifted the Nasdaq 
composite index. It was up 30.99 to 2503.27. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 
500 index was up 12.95 at 1,345.00. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a narrow margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 813.27 million 
shares, down from Thursday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was up 5.02 at 641.24, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index was down 0.52 at 787.29. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies was up 2.73 to  
436.11 
</P>
<P>
	IBM, up 7 3/4 to 217, led the Dow after analysts at SoundView  
Technology released a bullish outlook on the computer giant's 
second-quarter performance. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department reported today that the nation's  
unemployment rate in April was 4.3 percent, only slightly higher 
than the 29-year-low of 4.2 percent reached in March. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the report showed that the U.S. economy created  
234,000 jobs in April after inching up only by 7,000 jobs from the 
March level, which had been the weakest monthly increase in more 
than three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the continuing low unemployment and the steady increase  
in job creation, average hourly wages rose just 0.2 percent in 
April and are up only 3.2 percent over the past 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
	The report helped ease concerns that the Federal Reserve might  
raise interest rates to cool down the robust economy and head off a 
spurt in inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	``This economy is still in the sweet spot,'' said Robert  
Freedman, executive vice president for the John Hancock Funds in 
Boston. He said the jobs report indicated that inflation is nowhere 
in sight. 
</P>
<P>
	``Manufacturing is improving, consumer spending is healthy and  
auto sales are strong and the economy is growing at a moderate 
strength,'' Freedman said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Pushes Accident Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration proposed  
legislation Friday to disclose regional ``worst case'' casualty 
estimates from chemical accidents -- but prevent dissemination of a 
national database. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan aims to keep terrorists from obtaining information to  
plan an attack, while telling Americans living near dangerous 
chemicals how they might be affected by a catastrophic event. 
</P>
<P>
	In Congress, majority Republicans have expressed concerns about  
public data that could help terrorists pick a chemical target. 
</P>
<P>
	The Environmental Protection Agency originally considered  
posting plant-by-plant ``worst case'' estimates on the Internet, 
but dropped the idea last fall after the FBI, the CIA, the National 
Fire Chiefs Association and lawmakers raised concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	Timothy Fields, acting EPA assistant administrator for solid  
waste and emergency response, said emergency officials and the 
public would be provided information in their own geographical 
areas under the plan. In some cases, the public information would 
include a multi-state region. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 36,000 facilities must provide ``worst-case scenario''  
information to the EPA by June 21 under a federal law. The data 
consists of the geographical area that would be endangered by a 
catastrophic event and the number of people in the area that might 
be affected. 
</P>
<P>
	The law applies to all types of facilities that use 140  
chemicals, not just to chemical manufacturing plants. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., chairman of a Senate Environment and  
Public Works subcommittee, plans to write his own bill. Inhofe has 
opposed release of a national database, especially on the Internet, 
and expressed concern that without legislation, the data could be 
released through the Freedom of Information Act. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Thomas Bliley, R-Va., chairman of the House Commerce  
Committee, said, ``It has taken over a half a year, but I am 
pleased that the administration has now admitted that this problem 
must be addressed through corrective legislation. I will be 
reviewing the proposal very closely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fields said the legislation would only permit those requesting  
the information ``to get paper copies of limited portions for 
particular facilities in a geographic area. EPA will develop 
guidance within 60 days of a new law of how paper copies would be 
distributed upon request.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll make sure no one will be able to have the entire  
database,'' Fields said. ``The FBI believes this is a reasonable 
approach to protect against terrorist threats.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Environmental organizations already have said they would oppose  
only limited release of the information. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think the availability of a national data base is critical,  
because it allows the public to see how a particular facility or 
industry compares to others, and how a community compares,'' said 
Lois Epstein of the Environmental Defense Fund. ``If facilities are 
doing good things to reduce their hazards in another place, the 
public might want to find out if that can be the case where they 
work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Playing down the terrorist threat, Ms. Epstein said, ``If this  
information is considered problematic, so is information on where 
the largest shopping centers are and the most used subway 
stations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Van, spokesman for the Chemical Manufacturers' Association,  
said his industry organization supports only limited release of the 
material. 
</P>
<P>
	``We should listen to the experts,'' he said. ``What does an  
environmental organization know about fighting terrorism. I would 
suggest they know little to nothing. We don't either.''

<HEADLINE> Court OKs Yellowstone Bison Slaying </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The state of Montana is free to keep  
killing bison outside Yellowstone National Park to protect cattle 
from being infected with a livestock disease, a federal appeals 
court has decided. 
</P>
<P>
	In a one-sentence ruling Thursday, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of  
Appeals upheld a decision allowing the state and the National Park 
Service to continue killing bison as they have for the last three 
winters. 
</P>
<P>
	Bison leave Yellowstone in search of winter forage. About half  
test positive for brucellosis, a disease that can cause cows to 
abort and, in rare cases, can spread to humans and cause a 
recurring fever. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 1,200 bison that left Yellowstone have been shot or  
shipped to slaughter in the last three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Environmental groups that challenged the plan contend there was  
no evidence the disease could spread from Yellowstone bison to 
cattle grazing on neighboring land. They also contended the 
slaughter conflicts with the designated role of the park as a 
wildlife sanctuary. 
</P>
<P>
	John Bloomquist, the state's lawyer, told the court in a hearing  
last month that the state's stringent measures for controlling 
brucellosis have protected the cattle industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department lawyer Andrew Mergen said at the same hearing  
that brucellosis, target of a $1 billion government eradication 
program, has been eliminated virtually everywhere but among 
Yellowstone bison.

<HEADLINE> Bush Using Texas To Build Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- While his political team scours the country  
for cash and plots far-reaching campaign strategies, Texas Gov. 
George W. Bush is riding herd on a legislative session that he 
hopes will seal his status as the GOP presidential front-runner. 
</P>
<P>
	Grinding through a Republican Senate and a Democratic House are  
Bush-backed initiatives to slash taxes, improve schools and curb 
abortions. Just as important, the second-term governor is stepping 
gingerly around legislative land mines that could explode after he 
leaves Austin for the campaign trail in June. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 45-minute interview at his Capitol offices this week, Bush  
discussed a range of state issues that are complicating his 
political life. The talk reinforced expectations that Bush, as a 
presidential candidate, would offer Americans the same soft-edged, 
caveated conservatism that got him re-elected in 1998 with 70 
percent of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``I intend to talk about what I've done to show people what I  
intend to do,'' he said. ``I've got a record. It's a conservative 
record. It's a compassionate record.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also is looking beyond Austin.  
</P>
<P>
	A team of volunteers is studying the Electoral College map,  
laying the early groundwork for a general election strategy. His 
finance team hopes to raise $7.5 million in the second quarter of 
1999 -- for a total of $15 million. 
</P>
<P>
	They are collecting more than $10 for every $1 spent on  
fund-raising, a remarkable ratio that no other GOP campaign has 
matched. He plans to keep most of the money in the bank, giving 
rivals 10 million or so reasons to consider dropping out. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign will soon pocket its 100th congressional  
endorsement, and advisers are meeting regularly with Capitol Hill 
leaders. The strategy is to swap legislative ideas so Bush gets a 
chorus of support when he unveils campaign initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Before he can start campaigning for president, Bush must finish  
being governor. The issues confronting him: 
</P>
<P>
	TAXES -- He wants a $2 billion property tax cut but will settle  
for less. ``I don't draw lines'' in the sand, he said. The goal: 
``Significant tax cuts.'' What is significant? 
</P>
<P>
	``You'll know it when you see it,'' Bush said, with a smile and  
a wink. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, the governor's tax-cutting package was rejected and  
replaced with a bill one-third smaller than his. He signed it and 
took credit for what he called the largest tax cut in Texas 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	EDUCATION -- He likely will leave Austin with a landmark bill  
reducing the practice of promoting failing students simply to keep 
them in their age group. 
</P>
<P>
	Another initiative popular with GOP voters -- public school  
vouchers -- is likely to fail. The Texas bill would create pilot 
project in just two school districts. 
</P>
<P>
	Defeat would open him to criticism from conservatives who doubt  
Bush's commitment. His younger brother, Jeb Bush, just secured a 
sweeping voucher bill as governor of Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	ABORTION -- Bush opposes abortion, but says Americans are not  
prepared to outlaw the procedure. Hoping to appease the right 
without upsetting moderates, Bush is taking an incremental 
approach. 
</P>
<P>
	His bill would require parents to be notified when a young women  
seeks an abortion, unless a judge waives the requirement. Democrats 
may succeed in giving social workers the same power, sending Bush a 
bill that would be tough to sign and hard to ignore. 
</P>
<P>
	HATE CRIMES -- Bush will face a dilemma if a bill expanding  
Texas' hate crimes law is sent to his desk. The measure, which 
President Clinton backed during a visit to Texas on Friday, would 
define the categories of hate that draw extra punishment, including 
crimes based on sexual preference. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, who has said he opposes same-sex marriages, would anger  
party conservatives by signing the bill. If he vetoed it, Democrats 
would accuse him of playing to the right. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush refuses to say how he would handle the bill, but he  
believes stiff sentences are warranted for all crimes -- no matter 
the motivation. ``Punish the deed,'' he said. ``Most deeds are 
based upon hate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Referring to the shootings at Columbine High School, Bush said,  
``What's the difference between the white man who got killed or the 
black man who got killed during that rampage?'' 
</P>
<P>
	GUN CONTROL -- Bush created a stir when he seemed to endorse  
background checks for purchasers at gun shows -- but only after the 
bill died and the Colorado shootings occurred. His aides now say 
the bill was always flawed; the governor said federal law must 
change to permit full-scale gun show checks. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush supports federal bans on assault weapons and armor-piercing  
bullets, taking the middle road to gun control as polls show a 
growing hunger for restrictions. He approved a concealed weapons 
law in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Prickly issues like these traditionally pose problems for  
governors who try to leap from the statehouse to the White House. 
In 1992, Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton faced questions about his 
record, as did 1988 Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis, governor of 
Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
	In Texas, Bush gets good marks from Democratic and Republican  
lawmakers, though some privately grumble that he shifts with the 
political winds. They call him charming, a deal-cutter, an astute 
communicator who makes the most out of an inherently weak 
governor's office. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been a good governor,'' said House Speaker Pete Laney, a  
Democrat. ``I think he would be a good president.''

<HEADLINE> Real Estate Funds at Turning Point </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Mutual funds that invest in real estate appear  
to have reached one of those point-of-no-return moments that truly 
separate the bulls from the bears. 
</P>
<P>
	Before staging a rally in April, real estate funds took a  
serious pounding all through 1998 and the first quarter of 1999. 
The losses erased many of the gains the funds had built up in the 
previous three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, it seems, it's time for investors, and fund managers, to  
decide whether they think a sustained comeback is in the offing -- 
or whether vehicles such as real estate investment trusts, or 
REITs, just aren't destined to play as big a role in fund 
portfolios as their partisans once believed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although 1998 has been a tough year for REITs, we believe they  
are now offering some of the best fundamentals of any publicly 
traded companies and are selling at recession-like multiples,'' 
says Andrew Davis, manager of the Davis Real Estate Fund in Santa 
Fe, N.M. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that the long winter for REIT shareholders has  
finally ended,'' declares Cohen &AMP; Steers Capital Management Inc., a 
New York firm that runs the biggest of all real estate mutual 
funds, the $1.75 billion Cohen &AMP; Steers Realty Shares. 
</P>
<P>
	But managers are singing a different tune at another New York  
fund that has been a high-profile proponent of REIT investing, the 
Baron Growth &AMP; Income Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	Through its four-year history, this fund, part of a three-fund  
family specializing in smaller growth stocks, has relied mainly on 
REITs for the income side of its portfolio. But now it has decided 
to downplay them, and is seeking shareholder approval to change its 
name to Baron Growth Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	``REITs ... no longer offer unique opportunities for growth,''  
manager Ronald Baron writes in the fund's latest quarterly report. 
``REITs have completed their cyclical recovery from the real estate 
depression of the early 1990s and the industry is, in our opinion, 
more fairly priced. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are fewer and fewer small-cap real estate businesses  
with great prospects and dynamic management teams,'' Baron asserts. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the research firm of Lipper Inc., the approximately  
125 funds that invest in REITs and other real-estate businesses had 
a negative return in the first quarter this year of 4.62 percent, 
bringing their loss for the 12 months ended March 31 to 20.42 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	That put them in the lowly company of emerging markets mutual  
funds, which fell 25.45 percent over the same span as they 
contended with currency and debt crises in Asia, Russia and Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen &AMP; Steers, in a report just published for investment  
advisers, observes, ``The latest bear market (for REITs) was longer 
than and nearly as deep as the 1989-90 episode, which was 
accompanied by the worst real estate crisis of our generation. 
</P>
<P>
	``In contrast, real estate fundamentals today are as strong as  
ever, and this has resulted in strong profit growth for the REIT 
industry. Therefore, it is quite possible that this bear market was 
primarily valuation- and sentiment-based rather than fundamentally 
justified.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the numbers were so good, why did sentiment get so bad? Cohen  
&AMP; Steers says fears focused on slowing economic growth worldwide, 
which evoked visions of increased vacancies and falling rents in 
commercial property, as well as concern that real estate prices 
might weaken in a disinflationary, or deflationary, environment. 
</P>
<P>
	Furthermore, the Internet mania in the stock market appears to  
have cast a shadow over some real estate investments. With the rise 
of electronic retailing and other World Wide Web businesses, the 
reasoning goes, bricks-and-mortar properties may be consigned to a 
diminished role in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	But the optimists insist that these worries generally are  
unjustified or overblown. Because REITs are in disfavor, says 
Davis, ``Real estate is trading cheaper on Wall Street than Main 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since the late 1980s, the real estate industry has undergone  
substantial structural changes, including increased disclosure 
requirements, improved methods of valuations and a growing number 
of seasoned managers with inside ownership,'' Davis argues. ``We 
believe these changes make a compelling case for real estate as a 
long-term investment.''

<HEADLINE> Pa. Man Sentenced in Hot Tub Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- A man serving a life term for suffocating his  
first wife in a bathtub has been sentenced to death for strangling 
his second wife in a hot tub. 
</P>
<P>
	The sentence was issued Thursday by the jury that convicted  
Timothy Boczkowski of murder in the 1994 death of Maryann 
Boczkowski, 35, at the couple's Pittsburgh home. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said he killed her because he did not want children  
and she was about to leave him. The cause of death was ruled to be 
strangulation. A pathologist, however, testified that water in her 
sinuses could have been evidence of drowning, and the defense used 
that to back up its claim of accidental death. 
</P>
<P>
	Her death prompted authorities to reopen an investigation into  
the death of Boczkowski's first wife, Elaine, 34, four years 
earlier in Greensboro, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Boczkowski, 43, said his first wife had drowned after drinking,  
but an autopsy concluded the cause of death was chest compression. 
He was convicted of her death in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Three U.S. Women Qualify in Diving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Erica Sorgi, who at 16 already has  
five national titles, advanced to the 3-meter finals of the USA 
Diving Grand Prix after finishing sixth overall in Friday's 
semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Fu Mingxia of China topped the field of 12 finalists at the  
International Swimming Hall of Fame Aquatic Complex, followed by 
Russians Irina Lashko and Vera Ilyina and Canadian Eryn Bulmer. 
</P>
<P>
	Sorgi, a high school junior from Mission Viejo, Calif., finished  
just behind University of South Carolina freshman Michelle Davison. 
</P>
<P>
	Jaime Jaax of Myersville, Md., also qualified for the United  
States, which has been weak in women's diving over the last few 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was really happy by how the whole U.S. team did,'' Davison  
said. ``We did pretty strong. I'm glad we have three girls in the 
finals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sorgi was the 3-meter and platform champion in the recent U.S.  
Spring Nationals last year. She finished second in the platform 
competition in the Grand Prix. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she doesn't care about reports of the demise of women's  
diving in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't read about stuff like that. I dive and try to do the  
best I can do,'' Sorgi said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know that the field of women divers is really good right  
now, especially in Russia and China,'' she said. ``We don't train 
almost half as much as they do. If we're up there with them it's 
great, but if we're not it's to be expected almost.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite being dominated by Russia and China on the international  
stage, Davison and Sorgi agree that diving against the best in the 
world is the only way to improve. 
</P>
<P>
	``I look at them as a challenge,'' Davison said. ``It helps my  
diving. It makes me step it up to another level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They're amazing to watch,'' Sorgi said. ``It's a good step for  
the USA to have three of us in the finals and two of us in the top 
six.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The men's 3-meter finals and women's platform finals will be  
Saturday, with the reverse on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Northwestern Receiver Going to Jail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Christopher Gamble, a former Northwestern wide  
receiver who lied to a federal grand jury about his role in the 
school's sports gambling scandal, was sentenced Friday to two 
months in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Gamble, 27, already on probation for a felony theft offense in  
his home state of Georgia, also was placed on three years of 
probation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to apologize to the university and to my family,''  
Gamble said before being sentenced by U.S. District Judge George 
Marovich. 
</P>
<P>
	Gamble, of Marietta, Ga., was among 11 former Northwestern  
players who have been charged in the federal government's 
investigation of gambling by student athletes at the school. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine have pleaded guilty, and seven have been sentenced.  
</P>
<P>
	Assistant U.S. Attorney Patrick Collins told the judge that  
while Gamble lied repeatedly about his own betting on football 
games, he also tipped off federal investigators that the scandal 
had spread beyond football to Northwestern's basketball program. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Northwestern star running back Dennis Lundy was sentenced  
this week to one month in prison for lying to a federal grand jury 
about the gambling scandal. Lundy admitted that he deliberately 
fumbled the ball on the 1-yard line in a 1994 game against Iowa in 
order to win a bet. 
</P>
<P>
	The government asked for twice as much time behind bars for  
Gamble, with Collins noting that Lundy had lied to the jury on one 
occasion but that Gamble had done so repeatedly. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a plea agreement with prosecutors, once Gamble serves his  
sentence he will travel to various universities under an 
NCAA-sponsored program and speak to student athletes about the 
dangers of gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	Gamble left the courthouse without talking to reporters. His  
attorney, Donald V. Young, said that at the time of the lies Gamble 
had been in the Minnesota Vikings training camp and had feared that 
he would be cut if the team found out about his role in campus 
gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	``So he fudged a bit,'' Young said.

<HEADLINE> Feds Sue Firm for Misleading Public </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A company that allegedly mailed millions of  
American households a $15 offer for services that the government 
provides for free, such as changing a new bride's name on her 
Social Security records, is facing federal fraud charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Barbara S. Jones of the U.S. District Court for the  
Southern District of New York issued a temporary restraining order 
against Federal Record Service Corp. immediately after the 
government filed a lawsuit on Thursday accusing the company of 
fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	``The lawsuit seeks to ensure that consumers will not be  
victimized,'' said Mary Jo White, the U.S. Attorney for the 
district. 
</P>
<P>
	Company officials did not immediately respond to requests for  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the suit, Federal Record Service sent letters to  
newlywed couples or families with new babies. In the letters, the 
company offered, for a $15 fee, to help obtain a new Social 
Security number and card for a new baby or an updated card for a 
bride who had changed her name. 
</P>
<P>
	Most new parents, whether they know it or not, order a Social  
Security number for their newborn as part of the birth registration 
process at the hospital. If not, forms to do so can be obtained for 
free at any local Social Security office or by calling a toll-free 
government number. Similarly, Social Security will make name 
changes for free. 
</P>
<P>
	When someone accepted the Federal Record Service offer, the  
company would often simply mail them the appropriate free form and 
pocket the $15, Social Security officials said. Other times victims 
would never hear back from the company at all. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Record Service is incorporated in New York and Florida,  
and operates out of offices in both those states, as well as 
Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has allegedly operated for years. But it took new  
laws against misleading advertising, passed by Congress in 1994, 
and a long investigation to build the case the government brought 
on Thursday, according to officials. 
</P>
<P>
	``For far too long, Federal Record Service has been picking the  
pocket of the American public through deceptive practices in an 
effort to sell an unnecessary service,'' Social Security 
Commissioner Kenneth S. Apfel said in a statement. ``Today's action 
proves ... it can't hide from the law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A hearing in the case has been scheduled for May 13.

<HEADLINE> Steel Industry Seeks Quota Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. steel industry will take its fight  
against low-priced imports to the airwaves with ads urging support 
for quotas under consideration in Congress, officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The television and radio spots will begin running Sunday during  
morning news shows, talk radio and other public affairs programs in 
Washington and other selected markets. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, despite the threat of a presidential veto, the House  
voted 289-141 for legislation that would impose global quotas on 
steel shipments into the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal is pending in the Senate, where it faces a more  
difficult time. The new broadcast spots represent the launch of a 
campaign to build support in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	``The goal of our advertising campaign is to convey our urgent  
message that illegally dumped foreign steel must be stopped in 
order to save our domestic steel industry,'' said George Becker, 
president of the United Steelworkers of America. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. industry is lobbying for passage of the quota measure  
to combat a flood of imports it blames for the loss of thousands of 
American jobs in the past year. The Clinton administration opposes 
the bill, fearing it could start a trade war and hurt U.S. 
industries that rely on foreign markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Imports rose again in March after four consecutive months of  
reductions. They reached record levels last year in the wake of the 
Asian economic crisis, which drove down demand for steel abroad and 
forced foreign producers to seek U.S. clients. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the Clinton administration ruled that Japan  
illegally dumped a core steel product, hot-rolled carbon steel, in 
U.S. markets at prices below production costs or home-market 
prices. Japan faces punitive tariffs as a result. Similar cases are 
pending against Brazil and Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	Steelworkers, meanwhile, have been pushing for quotas to block  
shipments from other countries and of other products as well. 
</P>
<P>
	The 60-second ad that begins airing Sunday features Leticia  
Klisiak, a single mom who works as a crane operator at Bethlehem 
Steel's Burns Harbor plant in Portage, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
	She complains of the foreign pricing practices and blames the  
imports for layoffs and bankruptcies at U.S. steel mills. Viewers 
and listeners are then urged to call their senators. 
</P>
<P>
	Marco Trbovich, a union spokesman, said other spots will air in  
the future. The ads will run primarily in Washington at first and 
will eventually spread to the states of ``targeted senators,'' whom 
he would not name. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials would not disclose how much the initial ads will cost  
or how long they will run, saying those details are still being 
finalized. The ads complement the steelworkers' letter-writing and 
phone-calling campaigns.

<HEADLINE> Jets Owner Leon Hess Dies at 85 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Leon Hess, the oil tycoon and paternalistic  
owner of the New York Jets who longed to see his team return to the 
Super Bowl one last time, died today. He was 85. 
</P>
<P>
	Hess died at Lenox Hill Hospital of a blood disease, the team  
said. He had been hospitalized with a broken hip in early April and 
discharged. But a day later he re-entered the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Hess, one of the wealthiest and most reticent owners in  
professional sports, made his fortune in oil, with a company that 
bears his name. 
</P>
<P>
	He was part of a group that bought the Jets of the American  
Football League in 1963, when they were the New York Titans. He 
eventually bought out his partners, notably Sonny Werblin and Phil 
Iselin, in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jets began play in Shea Stadium in 1964 after four seasons  
in the Polo Grounds. But 20 years later, Hess, unhappy with the 
facilities at the home of the Mets, moved the Jets' home to Giants 
Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	Hess died without seeing the Jets back in the Super Bowl. Their  
only appearance came in 1969 when Joe Namath led them to a landmark 
victory over the Baltimore Colts. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jets came close last season to fulfilling his wish for  
another championship. With Bill Parcells the coach, they got into 
the AFC title game but lost to the Super Bowl champion Denver 
Broncos 23-10. 
</P>
<P>
	``Leon Hess was a great American success story,'' NFL  
commissioner Paul Tagliabue said. ``He was a prince of a man at a 
time when such individuals are rare. We will deeply miss him and 
his always-wise counsel. ... There will be a terrible void as the 
Jets pursue their dream of another Super Bowl victory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Known as a generous owner who promoted a family atmosphere for  
his team, Hess rarely went outside the organization to hire coaches 
in his early years in charge. But in 1989, at the end of a 4-12 
season, he hired Dick Steinberg as general manager. 
</P>
<P>
	Steinberg, who died in 1995, hired Bruce Coslet as coach. He  
lasted four years, replaced by Pete Carroll. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Jets lost their final five games of 1994 under  
Carroll, Hess fired the coach and hired a former Jets player and 
assistant, Rich Kotite. He even tracked down Kotite while on 
vacation to offer him the job. 
</P>
<P>
	Kotite went 4-28 in his two seasons, but Hess allowed him to  
resign rather than fire him. 
</P>
<P>
	He then hired Parcells from New England in 1997, paying a  
compensation of four draft picks. Parcells quickly rewarded Hess by 
turning around one of the most hapless franchises in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	Hess often was cited for his kindness toward Jets players. When  
Dennis Byrd was temporarily paralyzed in an on-field collision with 
a teammate during a 1992 game, Hess offered financial and medical 
support throughout Byrd's recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	``To him I owe everything,'' Byrd said. ``The success of what's  
happened and what he's done for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hess was the son of a Russian immigrant who was a kosher  
butcher. He started building his oil company from his father's 
one-truck oil delivery business in Asbury Park, N.J., during the 
Depression in the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody was broke in those days,'' Hess recalled. ``I had to  
pay for the truck before I could deliver the oil.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hess supplied oil to Gen. George Patton's troops during World  
War II. He acquired Amerada in 1969 after an ownership battle with 
Phillips Petroleum. He stepped down as chairman and chief executive 
officer in 1995. Forbes magazine last year listed his net worth at 
$720 million. 
</P>
<P>
	He is survived by his wife of 51 years, Norma; two daughters,  
Marlene and Connie; and a son, John, who succeeded him as chief 
executive officer of Amerada Hess Corp; and seven grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
	The funeral is Monday in Manhattan.

<HEADLINE> New IMAX Movie Stars Elephants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The angry elephant towers six stories above  
you, ears flared as she charges, her bellowing so loud you can feel 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	That heart-stopping moment awaits visitors to the new  
giant-screen IMAX theater, opening next week at the Smithsonian 
Institution's National Museum of Natural History after a national 
tour. 
</P>
<P>
	Opening the new theater is ``Africa's Elephant Kingdom,'' a  
Discovery Channel film documenting a year in the life of a family 
of elephants in Kenya. 
</P>
<P>
	A matriarch leads the group. They depend on her memory to find  
food and water in different seasons, and she guides life in the 
family. 
</P>
<P>
	And it's she who defends them, risking her life to threaten  
intruders as she charges to drive them off. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a charge to end all charges,'' said film consultant  
Iain Douglas-Hamilton, driving a truck with the film crew in the 
back as the elephant charged. 
</P>
<P>
	She was quicker than Douglas-Hamilton expected and caught the  
truck with her tusks on either side of the camera before he was 
able to speed up and escape. 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually, however, the crew was accepted by an elephant  
family. 
</P>
<P>
	``The greatest compliment they would pay was to ignore us,''  
said Douglas-Hamilton. ``We seldom walked with elephants because 
that's dangerous, but we did a lot of very close-up work from cars 
and they seemed to recognize our smell.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That family lived in Amboseli Park, while the elephants who  
charged the filmmakers were Tsavo Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Ivory hunters have killed many elephants in Tsavo in recent  
years, and Douglas-Hamilton concluded that the survivors seem to 
fear and hate humans. 
</P>
<P>
	For the elephant family featured in the film, the annual rains  
came late, and drought means famine. 
</P>
<P>
	Adults use their own huge bodies to shade the babies as the  
family trudges along in search of sustenance. 
</P>
<P>
	When an elephant collapses from starvation, the others try and  
pull it to its feet, struggling to help, knowing that to stop means 
to die. 
</P>
<P>
	The mother of a dead baby elephant tries to lift her tiny  
offspring, as though to massage life back to its small body. When 
that fails, her companions come by, rubbing the mother with their 
trunks as if in consolation. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally the rains return, the elephants wallow in cool mud, and  
plants grow quickly, providing food. Once again life is good.

<HEADLINE>  Cuban Coach Talks About Defection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HIALEAH, Fla. (AP) -- It took Cuban baseball coach Rigoberto  
Betancourt Herrera just a few hours to decide to skip the flight 
home to Havana and leave behind his wife and four kids. 
</P>
<P>
	So once the Cuban baseball team defeated the Baltimore Orioles  
12-6, Betancourt Herrera packed his bag and walked out the door of 
the Sheraton hotel with no plans of ever turning back. 
</P>
<P>
	``In Cuba the situation is precarious,'' Betancourt Herrera, the  
Cuban national team's pitching coach, said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Life is difficult -- getting transportation, housing and even  
medication. Here I have family. I decided to start a whole new 
life,'' he said 
</P>
<P>
	Seven Cubans who traveled to Baltimore with the 300-member Cuban  
delegation for the Monday game missed the return flight home the 
following day. Six said they had overslept and have since returned 
to the island. 
</P>
<P>
	Betancourt Herrera, 54, was the only one to stay. He had planned  
to walk out of Camden Yards after the game along with the thousands 
of baseball fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was going to leave just like a normal person. But I realized  
I couldn't do it after the game,'' he said. ``I left my passport 
and other papers at the hotel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His escape plans were nearly foiled again. When the team arrived  
at the hotel that night, they were told they had just a half hour 
to get their things together for the return flight. 
</P>
<P>
	Betancourt Herrera grabbed his bag and walked outside for a  
quick smoke, and then kept on walking. Fearing the police might 
think he was homeless and arrest him, Betancourt Herrera hid in the 
bushes at a nearby park for about seven hours. 
</P>
<P>
	At about 10 a.m., he walked into the downtown Baltimore police  
headquarters and requested asylum. 
</P>
<P>
	Three days after his defection, Betancourt Herrera is living  
with two aunts in Hialeah, a predominantly Hispanic community west 
of Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Betancourt Herrera is surprised by the help he's received so  
far. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since the time I arrived I've been received with love and  
appreciation,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball agent Joe Cubas, who represents Cuban pitcher Orlando  
``El Duque'' Hernandez, vowed to help find a baseball job for the 
man called ``el Pequeno Gigante del Box,'' -- Little Big Man in the 
Box. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to make some phone calls for him and see that he  
obtains a job,'' Cubas said. 
</P>
<P>
	Betancourt Herrera, once a famous left-handed pitcher on the  
island, played Cuban baseball between 1965 and 1975 and was known 
for an excellent curve ball. 
</P>
<P>
	He was part of the national team three times -- during the  
Central American-Caribbean games in Puerto Rico in 1966, in the Pan 
American games in Winnipeg in 1967 and during a tour of Mexico. He 
most recently worked as a pitching trainer in a Havana province 
earning $250 a month. 
</P>
<P>
	Betancourt Herrera said he doesn't regret leaving his family and  
life behind. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've wanted to leave for a while but just didn't have the  
opportunity,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	His next step is to assure his stay in the United States and  
arrange for his wife, Marta Mesa Rodriguez, and their children, 
ages 29, 28, 13 and 7, to move to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll be lonely here,'' he said. ``Life alone here makes one  
nostalgic.''

<HEADLINE> No Charges for Police Shooters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIVERSIDE, Calif. (AP) -- Four police officers acted in haste and  
in error, but were justified in shooting an unresponsive, armed 
young black woman found sitting in a car, the district attorney 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The death of Tyisha Miller, 19, in December led to allegations  
that the officers -- three whites and a Hispanic -- were racists. 
Religious leaders, civil rights activists and residents of 
Riverside, 60 miles east of Los Angeles, protested the shooting at 
town hall meetings, vigils and marches. 
</P>
<P>
	District Attorney Grover Trask said Thursday the officers may  
have acted hastily and made mistakes in judgment, but they did not 
act criminally. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller's relatives were angry with the decision.  
</P>
<P>
	``It is sickening and it is sad,'' said the Rev. Bernell Butler,  
a cousin. ``Police officers are able to murder and get away with 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Miller had pulled into a gas station parking lot with a flat  
tire. Relatives who arrived to help her said they called police 
after Ms. Miller appeared to be having a seizure and was foaming at 
the mouth. 
</P>
<P>
	The officers found the car still running, with the radio and  
lights on. Inside, Ms. Miller was unresponsive, lying on the fully 
reclined driver's seat with a gun in her lap. The officers were 
unable to awaken her by banging on the windows, shining lights or 
shaking the car, Trask said. 
</P>
<P>
	When an officer tried to break the driver's side window with a  
baton and reach for the gun, Ms. Miller sat up, lifted a pager and 
stared at the cop, who backed away, Trask said. 
</P>
<P>
	One officer yelled at the others to hold their fire, and the  
woman lay down again, Trask said. When she rose up again and 
appeared to reach for the gun, the officers all fired, the 
prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
	Family members contend she remained unconscious throughout and  
never reached for the gun. 
</P>
<P>
	A coroner's report indicated all the bullets entered her body  
from the back, proving that she was not lying down when she was 
shot, Trask said. Her loaded gun was never fired. Ms. Miller was 
hit by 12 of the 23 bullets. Four struck her in the head. 
</P>
<P>
	Toxicology tests showed Ms. Miller had a blood-alcohol level of  
.13 percent. A driver in California is legally intoxicated at .08 
percent. Tests also detected marijuana residue. 
</P>
<P>
	The officers' plan to break in the window of her locked car to  
get the gun out of her lap may have been a mistake, but did not 
reach the level of criminal conduct, Trask said. ``It was a 
judgment call and it was probably a mistake in their judgment,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Sacramento, Attorney General Bill Lockyer endorsed Trask's  
decision, but said he would investigate reports of ``racial 
insensitivity and even racial hostility'' within the Riverside 
Police Department.

<HEADLINE> Bombing Survivor Weathers Tornado </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOORE, Okla. (AP) -- Randy Fittler is feeling jinxed. He lost his  
car in the Oklahoma City bombing, and his house to the Oklahoma 
tornadoes. 
</P>
<P>
	``People don't want to stand too close to me,'' he said Friday  
as he removed belongings from what once had been his three-bedroom 
house. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he has managed to find a bright side to the tragedies.  
</P>
<P>
	``I must be the luckiest guy on the planet because I got out of  
the bombing without a scratch, too. I keep walking away from 
disasters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forty-six people died from the tornadoes in Oklahoma and Kansas  
and about 900 people were injured. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 9,000 homes are estimated to have been destroyed or  
damaged in the Oklahoma City area alone. In Kansas, 1,500 buildings 
were destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
	While people searched for their belongings and cleared away  
debris, rescuers searched for three people still listed as missing, 
including a couple from Great Britain who disappeared while 
traveling in a motor home on Interstate 35 north of Oklahoma City. 
</P>
<P>
	Fittler and his girlfriend headed to a nearby highway overpass  
with their dog and parrot when it became clear their house was in 
the path of Monday's 260-mph tornado. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time they returned two hours later, Fittler's roof and  
attached garage had been heavily damaged, a kitchen wall was 
missing and he had a good view of the devastated neighborhood from 
his living room. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just stuff. I'm still breathing and that's what counts,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fittler was working in the Journal Record Building four years  
ago when a truck bomb went off across the street at the Murrah 
federal building, killing 168 people and injuring 500. 
</P>
<P>
	He still has the 1968 Olds Cutlass that was heavily damaged in  
the explosion at the federal building. The rebuilt car, towed to 
his house after the bombing, sits unscathed in the rubble of his 
garage. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's survived two disasters, so I am going to tow it out and  
get it ready to go,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fittler said being in the tornado was a similar experience as  
being in the April 19, 1995, bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Neither seems real,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	``I was in the wrong place at the wrong time in each instance,  
but I am not a victim,'' he said. ``I got up and got back on my 
feet. You can't do a damn thing but pick yourself up and get 
going.''

<HEADLINE> Duval, Woods To Stage Exhibition  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	David Duval and Tiger Woods won't have to meet in the final  
round of a major championship to provide the duel everyone wants to 
see. 
</P>
<P>
	International Management Group and ABC Sports plan to announce  
Monday an 18-hole exhibition match between Duval and Woods, which 
will be televised live in prime time Aug. 2 with a $1.5 million 
purse. 
</P>
<P>
	The match will take place at Sherwood Country Club in Thousand  
Oaks, Calif., site of the Shark Shootout. The winner will get $1.1 
million, although portions of the earnings will go toward the 
players' charity and The First Tee program. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a good opportunity to show golf to a non-golf audience,''  
said Charley Moore, Duval's agent at IMG. ``This is a good rivalry 
that new golf fans can appreciate. Both are young and represent a 
good chunk of the future -- not that it couldn't be done with anyone 
else, but these guys happen to be the most dominant over the past 
two or three years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woods, who is also represented by IMG, made the biggest impact  
on the PGA Tour since Jack Nicklaus when he won six times in his 
first eight months, including a record-setting victory in the 1997 
Masters. 
</P>
<P>
	He was No. 1 in the world for 41 consecutive weeks until Duval  
unseated him with the best stretch of golf in nearly 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval won the winners-only Mercedes Championship by nine strokes  
to start the year and followed that with the first final-round 59 
in PGA Tour history to win the Bob Hope Classic. After a three-week 
break in March, he won The Players Championship and followed with 
another victory in Atlanta, becoming the first player since Johnny 
Miller in 1974 to win four times before the Masters. 
</P>
<P>
	The only thing that has been lacking is a head-to-head showdown.  
</P>
<P>
	They've never been paired in the final round of any event or  
challenged each other down the stretch. And neither is willing to 
admit a rivalry is brewing because of a crowded field of stars on 
tour, such as Ernie Els, Justin Leonard and Phil Mickelson. 
</P>
<P>
	Other rivalries over the years, such as Nicklaus and Arnold  
Palmer and Nicklaus and Tom Watson, have developed on golf's 
biggest stage -- the major championships. Moore said the exhibition 
match was not an effort to manufacture one. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you're overestimating what the effects of a single,  
18-hole match would be,'' he said. ``This is a one-shot deal, it 
won't be part of a series. It's a chance to show golf off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the PGA Tour cannot endorse the exhibition, it has agreed  
to give the players the television release they need. A spokesman 
for ABC Sports said the network wouldn't comment until Monday.

<HEADLINE>  Ex-QB Montana on Arthritis Crusade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Joe Montana needed time before he could  
confess to having an ``older person's disease.'' Now, in 
retirement, he is pained by arthritis, limping through rounds of 
golf. 
</P>
<P>
	``To be here and talk about it was a tough step for me,'' the  
quarterback great said Friday. ``It's hard to get an athlete to 
talk about when he's been hurt and how long. Getting over that 
mental part was hard, but unfortunately it's true.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Montana was on Capitol Hill for the start of a series of public  
service announcements for The Arthritis Foundation. He is lending 
his name to the group in the search for a cure. 
</P>
<P>
	This was unfamiliar territory for a player who used to lead  
riveting comebacks during a 15-year career that included four Super 
Bowl victories with the San Francisco 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believed for most of my life that arthritis is an older  
person's disease,'' Montana said. ``I've got to find a way to make 
myself better because I've got four kids.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 42-year-old star was diagnosed with osteoarthritis, the most  
common form of the disease, more than 10 years ago when he was 
still at the height of his career. Several knee operations had worn 
away nearly all the cartilage in his left knee, leaving bone 
scraping against bone. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would walk into practice in the morning and it would be  
swollen, or walk in with a sharp pain, and it would almost give 
out,'' Montana said. 
</P>
<P>
	The pain, combined with the mental stress of the game, led  
Montana to retire in 1994 after playing two seasons in Kansas City. 
Retirement, however, did not stop the pain, and one day he may have 
to have replacement surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never know when it's going to flare up, that's the bad  
part,'' Montana said. ``I can't play basketball. I can't jog. 
Jogging, I hated it anyway. But I love basketball, it's my all-time 
favorite sport. You're half-limping, trying to play golf. Usually I 
can't make it through 18 holes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Montana's situation is by no means exceptional. Forty million  
Americans have arthritis, and it often begins with athletic 
injuries. Montana said he was startled when he attended a 49ers 
celebration and watched long-retired players struggling to climb 
just three steps to accept their awards. 
</P>
<P>
	Montana regrets he didn't aggressively seek treatment earlier.  
</P>
<P>
	``The idea would have been to take him 10 years ago and halt  
that loss of cartilage,'' said Dr. Lee Simon, a Harvard professor 
who displayed X-rays of Montana's knee. ``There have been attempts 
to regrow cartilage, which have not worked.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So Montana is waiting for a medical miracle, even as he raises  
his children and his 30 or so show and jumping horses at his home 
near San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he has no desire to be a coach or general manager in the  
NFL, and chooses instead to manage his four-legged performers. 
</P>
<P>
	``You find out that they're like athletes, too,'' he said.  
``They get similar ailments.''

<HEADLINE> Reporter Sues Jerry Glanville </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- A Star Tribune reporter is suing former Fox  
Sports broadcaster Jerry Glanville and Fox Sports Inc. claiming 
Glanville hit him while riding a motorcycle inside the Metrodome 
before a Vikings game last Nov. 8. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Levy, 48, suffered arm and shoulder injuries and has been  
in physical therapy since the incident. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit, filed Thursday in Hennepin County District Court,  
says Glanville failed to exercise care in driving the motorcycle or 
to maintain proper control. 
</P>
<P>
	About 40 minutes before the game, Glanville borrowed the  
motorcycle from Ragnar, the Vikings mascot, and drove around the 
stadium. He hit Levy, who was standing on the sideline, in the arm 
with the handlebar, according to Levy's attorney, John Eisberg. 
</P>
<P>
	Glanville didn't stop to help Levy or ask if he was hurt,  
Eisberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	The incident was replayed in television. Glanville said during  
the replay, ``What I did was ran into a sportswriter. I've been 
trying to kill one of those guys for years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Glanville is now a broadcaster for CBS Sports and efforts to  
reach him through that organization were unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
	Efforts to get comment from Fox Sports, both in New York and Los  
Angeles, were not successful. An attorney for Fox declined comment 
to the Star Tribune.

<HEADLINE> German Jobless Rate Falls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BONN, Germany (AP) -- Germany's unemployment rate fell to 10.7  
percent in April from 11.1 percent in the previous month, declining 
in both western Germany and the formerly communist east. 
</P>
<P>
	But the seasonally adjusted total of unemployed people -- an  
index showing longterm jobless trends -- rose by 10,000, much more 
than analysts expected. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Labor Office said the rise was due to a reduction in  
government make-work programs in April. 
</P>
<P>
	In western Germany, the nation's economic powerhouse, the  
jobless rate fell to 9 percent last month from 9.3 percent in 
March. In struggling former communist East Germany, it dropped to 
17.8 percent from 18.4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Without seasonal adjustment, the government said 4,145,310  
people were out of work at the end of April, some 144,000 fewer 
than a month earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The government's top labor official, Bernhard Jagoda, said  
Friday he expects the number of jobless could decline in May to 
below 4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe we will have a good May and that we can come in  
slightly below the 4 million jobless mark,'' he said at a press 
conference in Nuremberg. ``We are grappling with the 4 million.''

<HEADLINE> Jockey Patin Faces Hearing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- The state Racing Commission scheduled a  
hearing for Wednesday on a decision to fine and suspend jockey 
Billy Patin for carrying an illegal electrical device when he rode 
Arkansas Derby winner Valhol. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewards fined Patin $2,500, suspended him for the rest of the  
year and suggested to the Racing Commission that it extend the 
suspension through May 5, 2004. Any suspension applies to races in 
all jurisdictions. 
</P>
<P>
	The stewards also ordered redistribution of the winner's purse  
of $300,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Patin's attorney appealed. Owner James D. Jackson and trainer  
Dallas Keen are also involved in the appeal and Sam Laser, 
Jackson's attorney, might ask for a continuance. 
</P>
<P>
	Typically, when a notice of appeal is filed, the commission  
automatically stays any ruling by the stewards. 
</P>
<P>
	The stewards ruled after Oaklawn Park's attorney presented  
evidence, including a videotape that showed a black item falling 
from Patin's hand seconds after Valhol crossed the finish line in 
the April 10 race. Under oath, Patin suggested the black object may 
have been one of the rubber bands he used to hold down the sleeves 
of his shirt to prevent wind from blowing up them. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides will have an opportunity to present evidence at the  
Racing Commission hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Five days after the Arkansas Derby, Oaklawn President Charles J.  
Cella told the Racing Commission that the track has ``evidence that 
the jockey aboard the winner may have been in possession of an 
electrical device during the race.'' At Cella's request, the 
commission ordered the track to suspend distribution of the purse 
pending an investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually, Jackson went to court and a judge released the  
purse, assuring Valhol a spot in last week's Kentucky Derby. Ridden 
by Willie Martinez, Valhol finished 15th in the 19-horse field. 
</P>
<P>
	After the race at Churchill Downs, Jackson said the gelding  
would be shipped to Texas. But Valhol arrived in Baltimore 
Wednesday to prepare for the May 15 Preakness.

<HEADLINE> Will Monica Lewinsky Be on SNL? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Like any comedy show, NBC's ``Saturday Night  
Live'' has eagerly milked the Monica Lewinsky story. Now Ms. 
Lewinsky may be in on the joke. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC was keeping mum about it, but there were reports that the  
former presidential intern will appear as a guest on this week's 
episode. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a live show. The only thing I know for sure is that  
Cuba Gooding Jr. is the host and Ricky Martin is the musical 
guest,'' an NBC spokesman, Marc Liepis, said today. 
</P>
<P>
	If she appears, Ms. Lewinsky would push aside actress Molly  
Shannon, who has frequently portrayed her in skits. There was no 
word whether actor John Goodman would reprise his role as Linda 
Tripp. 
</P>
<P>
	During a skit rehearsal this week, Ms. Lewinsky was said to make  
jokes about dating and phone sex with President William Howard 
Taft, according to the New York Daily News. Taft was president from 
1909-1913.

<HEADLINE> Bucks Hope Extra Time Heals Wounds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Nothing like a few days off to cure what ails  
you -- especially when you've been ailing like the Milwaukee Bucks. 
</P>
<P>
	Heading into their first NBA playoff appearance since 1991, even  
3-point specialist Dell Curry said he expects to be ready when the 
Bucks open a best-of-5 series against the Indiana Pacers in 
Indianapolis on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Never mind that Curry has hardly played at all since suffering  
back spasms April 16 in a home loss to Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got a break in us playing Sunday instead of Saturday because  
it gave me an extra day of rest,'' Curry said. ``So I'll definitely 
be ready to play. By resting and rehabbing the last three games, 
it's almost pain-free. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will take a lot more than this to keep me out of the  
playoffs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, he continued treatments, as did Glenn Robinson, who  
has what's described as a deep bruise to the right knee. Robinson 
has been sidelined since suffering the injury in a game with 
Detroit a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The availability of Robinson and Curry could be crucial to the  
Bucks' fortunes against the Pacers. Robinson leads the Bucks in 
scoring. Curry leads the NBA in 3-point shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	Judging on the Pacers-Bucks games during the regular season, the  
first-round series could be an overtime affair. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the three regular-season games went into overtime, but  
the Pacers won them all by margins of two, five and eight points. 
</P>
<P>
	Bucks guard Ray Allen said he hasn't played well against the  
Pacers, and that's why he's so positive about his team's prospects. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've made a lot of mistakes and a lot of bad shots,'' he said.  
``But I'm very optimistic because I know I have a chance to reflect 
on what I've done in the past and correct it.''

<HEADLINE> Cardinals Disable Pitcher Osborne </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Donovan Osborne certainly is consistent.  
</P>
<P>
	The St. Louis Cardinals pitcher was put on the disabled list  
Friday for the seventh time in seven major league seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Osborne, 29, left Thursday night's game against Pittsburgh after  
allowing four runs in four innings. The diagnosis was shoulder 
inflammation following an MRI and bone scan Friday, and he was 
placed on the 15-day DL. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can pitch through a lot of pain because I've had surgery  
before and I know what I can and can't do,'' Osborne said. ``I 
can't do it right now. The pain is intolerable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Osborne, 1-3 with a 5.52 ERA in six starts, is in the final  
season of a $12.75 million, three-year contract. He's missed much 
of the first two seasons because of a hernia, two groin injuries 
and a shoulder injury, totaling 14 starts in 1998 and 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	He missed the entire 1994 season after reconstructive shoulder  
surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals recalled right-handed reliever Rick Croushore, 1-0  
with four saves and a 6.75 ERA at Triple-A Memphis. Osborne will be 
replaced in the rotation with right-hander Manny Aybar, who has 
thrown 11 consecutive scoreless innings in relief and has a 2.00 
ERA in 18 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Aybar, 24, made the team mostly because he's out of minor league  
options. The Cardinals turned down several trade offers after Aybar 
went 10-0 for Memphis last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``This guy's a legitimate talent, and he's got everything going  
for him,'' manager Tony La Russa said. ``It's going to get better 
and better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aybar drops into the slot that was supposed to be filled by  
left-hander Kent Mercker. But Mercker threw 3 2-3 innings of relief 
Thursday night, so he's been moved back to Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mercker had been in danger of losing his spot because of a 7.48  
ERA, but hasn't lost any of his confidence. He was a slow starter 
last year, with a 6.09 ERA before the All-Star break and a 3.91 ERA 
after. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're going to do what they've got to do and I'm not worried  
about it,'' Mercker said. ``I'm not in a mental state where I'm 
going home and saying, `What am I doing wrong?' and pulling out 
videotapes and calling my old high school coach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Croushore, a screwball specialist, was 0-3 with a 4.97 ERA and  
eight saves for St. Louis last year.

<HEADLINE>  Asian Stock Markets Close Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Most Asian stock markets ended the week sharply  
lower Friday as investors took profits on fears of a rise in 
interest rates following a warning about the risk of inflation in 
the United States by U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan. 
</P>
<P>
	In Hong Kong, the blue-chip Hang Seng Index slumped 572.81  
points, or 4.2 percent, closing at 12,997.43. It was the largest 
single-day point-loss since Jan. 7, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Brokers said overseas investors took profits following overnight  
comments by Greenspan, who hinted that the United States might 
raise interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	In remarks to bankers in Chicago, Greenspan praised the  
performance of the U.S. economy in recent years, but warned that 
gains in productivity cannot keep inflation at bay forever. 
</P>
<P>
	Because the Hong Kong dollar is pegged to the U.S. currency, any  
interest rate move in the United States is usually matched by a 
similar move in Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
	Thai share prices also slumped, with the main index falling 4.7  
percent on profit-taking. The Stock Exchange of Thailand, or SET, 
index fell 24.34 points to 488.35. 
</P>
<P>
	In Singapore, share prices closed sharply lower in reaction to  
Greenspan's comments. The Straits Times Index fell 3.8 percent, or 
75.19 points, to 1,899.45. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese market's main index fell 2.05 percent on  
profit-taking, shedding more than half of its nearly 600-point gain 
of the previous day. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 354.09  
points, or 2.05 percent, closing the week at 16,946.52 points. On 
Thursday, the index climbed 599.08 points, or 3.59 percent, on 
expectations that the government may intensify efforts to stimulate 
the faltering economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors locked in profits after Thursday's sharp gains, in  
which the Nikkei index closed at its highest level since Oct. 24, 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 120.54 yen at late  
afternoon, up 0.06 yen from late Thursday in Tokyo and also above 
its late New York level of 120.50 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Bucking the trend was the Philippine Stock Exchange, where the  
main index reached a new 21-month record high on expectations of 
another cut in the central bank's key overnight rates and 
better-than-expected first quarter corporate earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	The 30-company Philippine Stock Exchange Index gained 9.93  
points, or 0.3 percent, to close at 2,526.76. It was the index's 
highest level since posting 2,527.08 points on Aug. 13, 1997.

Stock Price Index fell 90.72 points, or 1.19 percent, to 7,469.33.

<HEADLINE> Jones Laywers To Seek Payment Order </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Paula Jones' lawyers are preparing to ask a  
judge to order President Clinton to pay nearly $400,000 in legal 
reimbursements as a penalty for being found in contempt of court in 
her case, legal sources familiar with the proposal said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed penalty was prepared for submission today to U.S.  
District Judge Susan Webber Wright in Little Rock, Ark., who found 
Clinton in contempt for giving intentional, untruthful testimony in 
his January 1998 deposition in the sexual harassment case, the 
sources said, speaking only on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed penalty is about $100,000 more than the amount Mrs.  
Jones' lawyers recently proposed to Clinton's legal team in 
settlement discussions. 
</P>
<P>
	Presidential attorney Robert Bennett dismissed that $300,000  
figure earlier this week as''outrageous and greedy and, I think, a 
gross misunderstanding of the court's order.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The penalty would cover expenses for Mrs. Jones' lawyers and the  
judge's own expenses in attending the Washington deposition -- and 
is not intended as an additional settlement payment to the one-time 
Arkansas state worker. Clinton already has paid her $850,000 to 
settle the case, but admitted no wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	John Whitehead, one of Mrs. Jones' lawyers, said attorneys who  
assisted her were not adequately paid for their work when they 
received portions of a settlement Clinton paid to Mrs. Jones 
earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as being greedy, everyone took far less than what they  
put in,'' Whitehead said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright, in a historic contempt ruling against a president on  
April 12, ordered Clinton to repay her lawyers any ``reasonable 
expenses'' they incurred as a result of Clinton's testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge now must decide whether Mrs. Jones' reimbursement  
request is reasonable and amounts to an adequate penalty for the 
first president ever to be found in contempt of court. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett had signaled that the president would contest any amount  
that approached $300,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Any money Clinton is ordered to reimburse Mrs. Jones for legal  
bills is above and beyond the $850,000 he paid her earlier this 
year to settle her charges that he made an unwanted sexual advance 
at a Little Rock hotel in 1991. At the time, Clinton was Arkansas 
governor. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton denies any wrongdoing and said he settled the sexual  
harassment case, which prompted the disclosure of his affair with 
former White House intern Monica Lewinsky and the subsequent 
impeachment proceedings, simply to bring an end to a public crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright ordered Clinton to pay ``any reasonable expenses,''  
including legal fees incurred by Mrs. Jones as a result of the 
false testimony. The judge also directed Clinton to reimburse the 
court $1,202 for her travel to Washington to preside over the 
taking of the deposition. 
</P>
<P>
	And she referred the matter to the Arkansas Supreme Court's  
Professional Conduct Committee, which has the power to revoke 
Clinton's law license or to impose other sanctions.

<HEADLINE> Internet Crucial in Tornado News </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- Within minutes of the deadly storms, the  
Internet was in action. 
</P>
<P>
	The world went online to track friends and relatives who might  
have been in the path of this week's deadly tornadoes in Oklahoma 
and Kansas, while victims logged on to find aid, shelter and 
relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet users posted messages, checked media Web sites for the  
latest news and sent e-mails looking for possible victims. 
</P>
<P>
	A message forum on the Web site of The Daily Oklahoman was busy  
nearly as soon as it went online Tuesday, manager Kelly Dyer said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``People would write, `I know there are instances of people  
concerned about this area of town. Was it hit? Somebody else would 
come back and say yes or no,'' Ms. Dyer said. ``There was a lot of 
communication going on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Initially, one forum was established just for missing persons  
and a second for people looking for lost pets and personal items. 
``Those two sort of merged together,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the day after the storms, the Oklahoman site had  
more than a half-million hits. Each day since then there have been 
more than 1.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The Oklahoman also has compiled a list of 1,500 names of tornado  
victims, providing their previous address and where they are now, 
if known. 
</P>
<P>
	In the hard-hit city of Moore, victims went to the undamaged  
library to use the computers. Web sites enabled victims to 
communicate with relatives and get information on aid and shelter. 
</P>
<P>
	Many around the world simply posted prayers and messages of  
hope. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am saddened by what has happened,'' said one message. ``I  
have been only on the Web for a week now and can't believe of what 
has happened. We the city of Brandon, Manitoba, send our prayers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Be assured that here in New Zealand we are very aware of your  
plight,'' said another.

<HEADLINE> Oil Futures Contracts Retreat Oil Prices  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Crude oil futures extended a retreat on the New  
York Mercantile Exchange on Friday amid fears that sharply higher 
prices will prompt world oil producers to exceed their stated 
output. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors continued to react to comments Thursday by executives  
of the Royal Dutch-Shell Group. They expressed pessimism about 
producers' ability to hold oil off the market, a concern that threw 
cold water on what had been a hot rally to the highest futures 
price for crude in 17 months. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries  
and other key producers, including Mexico and Norway, have agreed 
to cut output 2.1 million barrels, on top of 3 million barrels they 
agreed to take off the market last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices have jumped amid indications the cuts are being made, but  
analysts and others have warned that OPEC does not have a history 
of lasting cohesiveness. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude oil for June delivery fell 10 cents to $18.22 a barrel;  
June heating oil fell 0.99 cent to 43.23 cents a gallon; June 
unleaded gasoline fell 1.23 cents to 53.21 cents a gallon; June 
natural gas fell 2.2 cents to $2.273 for each 1,000 cubic feet. 
</P>
<P>
	In London, North Sea Brent Blend crude oil for delivery in June  
fell 15 cents to $16.41 a barrel.

<HEADLINE> Mistrial in Julie Hiatt Steele Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) -- A jury deadlocked Friday in the trial of  
a Virginia woman accused of lying to undercut the testimony of 
presidential accuser Kathleen Willey, the second setback in a month 
for prosecutor Kenneth Starr. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge declared a mistrial in the case of Julie Hiatt  
Steele, who was charged with obstruction of justice and lying to 
investigators, after jurors declared they could not reach a verdict 
in eight hours of deliberations. Ms. Steele's story undercut her 
onetime friend's allegation that President Clinton made an unwanted 
sexual advance toward her. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele, an outspoken critic of Starr's probe, said she felt  
wonderful. Starr's prosecutors said they were weighing whether to 
seek a retrial in the only criminal case to emerge from last year's 
Monica Lewinsky inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second time in a month that Starr's prosecutors were  
stymied in efforts to punish witnesses they alleged hindered his 
investigation. In April, a jury acquitted Whitewater figure Susan 
McDougal on one charge and deadlocked on three others. Starr is 
weighing whether to seek a retrial against Mrs. McDougal for 
refusing to give grand jury testimony in the investigation of her 
former Whitewater business partners, the president and Hillary 
Rodham Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr deputy Jay Apperson expressed frustration with the outcome  
of the case against Ms. Steele. She was charged with three counts 
of obstruction and one of lying to the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be nice to get a decision'' so that prosecutors can  
``move on to other areas'' of the investigation, Apperson said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a three-day trial, Starr's chief witness was Mrs. Willey with  
her story of alleged misconduct by President Clinton. Ms. Steele's 
attorneys assailed Mrs. Willey's credibility, depicting her as a 
publicity-seeking woman who has repeatedly lied. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele planned to testify in her defense until Wednesday  
night, when her lawyers told her they felt the cross-examination of 
Mrs. Willey's credibility had been so effective that the wisest 
strategy would be to call no witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	According to people familiar with Ms. Steele's situation, she  
resisted the idea of not testifying. They said the Steele team 
finally made the decision Thursday morning not to put on defense 
witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other reasons Ms. Steele wanted to testify was to counter  
Mrs. Willey's suggestions that Ms. Steele was eager to go to the 
tabloid press with the story of the Clinton-Willey incident. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's time to celebrate,'' Ms. Steele said outside the  
courthouse. ``It's time to start my life again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Claude Hilton announced that he had gotten a  
note from the jury saying it was ``hopelessly deadlocked'' and that 
``any further deliberation will not ... change the outcome.'' The 
word ``not'' was underlined, noted the judge. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted of all charges, Ms. Steele could have faced up to  
35 years in prison and $1 million in fines. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Willey testified that she rebuffed a ``very forceful''  
sexual advance by Clinton and told Ms. Steele about the incident 
hours after it occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele said the first time she ever heard of a  
Clinton-Willey encounter was in March 1997, when Mrs. Willey called 
her and asked her to lie about it to a Newsweek reporter. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors produced three witnesses who said Ms. Steele  
informed them she had known of the alleged Clinton advance before 
1997. Each of the three witnesses testified Ms. Steele insisted to 
them later that she hadn't told them. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys questioned why Mrs. Willey now remembers the  
alleged encounter with Clinton and conversations with Ms. Steele in 
much more detail than she did the first time she told the story 
under oath, during a January 1998 deposition for the Paula Jones 
sexual harassment lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Trying to explain her state of mind during the Jones deposition,  
Mrs. Willey testified that she had been frightened by a threatening 
encounter two days earlier with a stranger who knew that her cat 
was missing and her car tires had been slashed. 
</P>
<P>
	She also said Clinton lawyer Robert Bennett suggested in a  
conversation that she invoke her Fifth Amendment right against 
self-incrimination rather than answer the questions, which she said 
she regarded as a ``threat coming from the president.'' Outside of 
court, Bennett denied ever making such a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Trying to depict Mrs. Willey as emotionally unbalanced, Ms.  
Steele's lawyers made Mrs. Willey recount a grocery store 
confrontation in which she called Ms. Steele a four-letter word. 
Mrs. Willey said she regretted the confrontation but Ms. Steele had 
been attacking her in TV interviews and public appearances over the 
past year. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele's lawyers also delved into her taking of various  
antidepressants, including Prozac. Mrs. Willey said she had been 
depressed for some time after her husband's suicide, which occurred 
the day of the alleged Clinton advance. 
</P>
<P>
	And Mrs. Willey admitted she lied to Starr's investigators when  
they asked about a past relationship in which she had pretended to 
be pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
	Rather than abandoning their witness, Starr's office gave her a  
second grant of immunity from prosecution as a result of that lie.

	Dow Closes at Record 11,031.59  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks surged higher in late trading today,  
taking the Dow Jones industrial average to a new closing high, 
after a government jobs report tempered investors' concerns about 
higher interest rates. The Dow was up 84.77 to close at 11,031.59, 
surpassing the closing high of 11,014.69 reached Monday. Broader 
stock indicators were mostly higher after seesawing earlier in the

	Unemployment Edges Up to 4.3 Pct.  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The economy generated almost a quarter-million  
new jobs last month, even as factory work continued to melt away. 
The surge outside manufacturing helped push the unemployment rate 
among blacks down to its lowest level on record, although the 
overall national rate edged up to 4.3 percent. ``The economy is so 
strong that it is reaching down and touching everyone. Across all 
income groups, ethnic groups and educational levels, everyone is 
doing well,'' said economist Mark Zandi of Regional Financial 
Associates in West Chester, Pa. April's overall jobless rate of 4.3 
percent was only slightly above the 29-year-low of 4.2 percent 
reached in March, the Labor Department said today.

	World Gold Prices Plunge  
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP)-- Gold prices tumbled on world markets today after  
the British Treasury announced plans to sell more than half of its 
gold reserves in the years ahead. The treasury will auction off 125 
tons, or 17 percent, of its total gold reserves by the end of next 
March. An additional 290 tons would be sold off over the ``medium 
term,'' in 2001 and the following years. The gold is being sold as 
part of a plan to hold larger reserves of foreign currencies. In 
London, gold futures prices fell to $282.25 an ounce, down about 
$6. Later, on the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold fell $6.80 to 
$282.90 an ounce. The metal, which peaked at $875 a troy ounce in 
January 1980, has not broken above $300 this year. Barrick Gold was 
down 2 3/4 at 20 1/2; Newmont Mining down 3 3/8 at 22 11/16 and Getchell 
Gold, down 6 3/16 at 31 3/4.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department today cleared the  
merger of Bell Atlantic and GTE after the companies agreed to sell 
one of their two interests in overlapping wireless mobile telephone 
systems in nine states. The merger would create the nation's 
largest local phone company -- even bigger than the proposed merger 
between regional Bell companies SBC Communications Inc., and 
Ameritech Corp. The Bell Atlantic-GTE combination still must clear 
other regulatory hurdles. Bell Atlantic stock was up 2 5/8 today at 
58 3/8; GTE was up 2 3/4 at 67.

	ATLANTA (AP) -- Delta Air Lines said today it has upheld a  
pilot's decision to cut short a 14-hour flight to Japan because his 
relief pilots had trouble sleeping in cramped quarters they dubbed 
``the coffin.'' The airline also is working on a design for a 
larger bunk area. The issue became public after Capt. Roscoe 
McMillan landed his MD-11 in Portland, Ore., on April 7 rather than 
continue on from Atlanta to Tokyo. The 110 passengers were

standards body, changing its strategy to get the computer language 
approved as an international standard. Sun originally said it would 
submit an application to the International Organization for 
Standardization, known as the ISO, but abandoned that plan because 
of alleged opposition from Microsoft and others, The Wall Street 
Journal reported today. Instead, Sun hopes to gain approval from 
the ECMA, formerly known as the European Computer Manufacturers 
Association, and then submit it to ISO for fast-track approval. Sun 
submitted Java to the ECMA yesterday.

	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- The world turned to the Internet to track  
friends and relatives who might have been in the path of this 
week's deadly tornadoes. And victims logged on to find aid, shelter 
and relatives. Within minutes of Monday's storms, Internet users 
were posting messages and checking media Web sites for the latest 
news. A message forum on the Web site of The Daily Oklahoman was 
busy nearly as soon as it went online Tuesday, manager Kelly Dyer 
said today. Initially, one forum was established just for missing 
persons and a second for people looking for lost pets and personal 
items. ``Those two sort of merged together,'' she said.

Singapore Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said. ``The change

underlying real economies,'' Lee said in a speech to European 
business representatives in Singapore. Markets around the region 
have rocketed up by as much as 20 percent to 30 percent in the past

<HEADLINE> Ex-QB Montana on Arthritis Crusade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Joe Montana needed time before he could  
confess to having an ``older person's disease.'' Now, in 
retirement, he is pained by arthritis, limping through rounds of 
golf. 
</P>
<P>
	``To be here and talk about it was a tough step for me,'' the  
quarterback great said Friday. ``It's hard to get an athlete to 
talk about when he's been hurt and how long. Getting over that 
mental part was hard, but unfortunately it's true.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Montana was on Capitol Hill for the start of a series of public  
service announcements for The Arthritis Foundation. He is lending 
his name to the group in the search for a cure. 
</P>
<P>
	This was unfamiliar territory for a player who used to lead  
riveting comebacks during a 15-year career that included four Super 
Bowl victories with the San Francisco 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believed for most of my life that arthritis is an older  
person's disease,'' Montana said. ``I've got to find a way to make 
myself better because I've got four kids.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 42-year-old star was diagnosed with osteoarthritis, the most  
common form of the disease, more than 10 years ago when he was 
still at the height of his career. Several knee operations had worn 
away nearly all the cartilage in his left knee, leaving bone 
scraping against bone. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would walk into practice in the morning and it would be  
swollen, or walk in with a sharp pain, and it would almost give 
out,'' Montana said. 
</P>
<P>
	The pain, combined with the mental stress of the game, led  
Montana to retire in 1994 after playing two seasons in Kansas City. 
Retirement, however, did not stop the pain, and one day he may have 
to have replacement surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never know when it's going to flare up, that's the bad  
part,'' Montana said. ``I can't play basketball. I can't jog. 
Jogging, I hated it anyway. But I love basketball, it's my all-time 
favorite sport. You're half-limping, trying to play golf. Usually I 
can't make it through 18 holes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Montana's situation is by no means exceptional. Forty million  
Americans have arthritis, and it often begins with athletic 
injuries. Montana said he was startled when he attended a 49ers 
celebration and watched long-retired players struggling to climb 
just three steps to accept their awards. 
</P>
<P>
	Montana regrets he didn't aggressively seek treatment earlier.  
</P>
<P>
	``The idea would have been to take him 10 years ago and halt  
that loss of cartilage,'' said Dr. Lee Simon, a Harvard professor 
who displayed X-rays of Montana's knee. ``There have been attempts 
to regrow cartilage, which have not worked.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So Montana is waiting for a medical miracle, even as he raises  
his children and his 30 or so show and jumping horses at his home 
near San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he has no desire to be a coach or general manager in the  
NFL, and chooses instead to manage his four-legged performers. 
</P>
<P>
	``You find out that they're like athletes, too,'' he said.  
``They get similar ailments.''

	NATO Missiles Hit Chinese Embassy  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO airstrikes early Saturday hit  
the Chinese embassy in the city's New Belgrade district, setting 
the two story building on fire. Fire trucks converged on the site, 
which was engulfed in smoke. Dazed embassy staff were running about

	NATO Strikes Yugoslav Neighborhood  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO cluster bombs ripped through a  
market and a hospital complex in Yugoslavia's third-largest city 
Friday, reportedly killing at least 15 people. The alliance 
acknowledged it was ``highly probable'' one bomb went astray and 
hit a residential neighborhood during an attack on a military 
airport in Nis. The new NATO strikes came a day after Russia and 
major Western powers agreed to a proposal that would bring peace to 
Kosovo policed by an international force. President Slobodan 
Milosevic's government signaled it would eventually accept the deal 
-- if the alliance stops the bombing.

	U.S. Estimates Kosovo Atrocities

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- More than 4,600 people have died in more than  
70 mass executions in Kosovo since early March, and ethnic terror 
in the Serbian province has driven 1.5 million people from their 
homes, U.S. officials estimate. The Pentagon released a summary of 
suspected or confirmed ethnic terror in Kosovo, using data compiled 
by the State Department. The Pentagon says 100,000 military-age men 
are missing and houses are damaged or destroyed in more than 500 
cities.

	Black Jobless Rate at Record Low

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The economy generated almost a quarter-million

among blacks down to its lowest level on record. Overall, the 
national rate edged up to 4.3 percent. The unemployment rate for 
blacks fell to 7.7 percent, the lowest since the government began 
tracking it separately in 1972. Blacks remain jobless at more than 
double the 3.8 percent unemployment rate for whites.

death after revealing a crush on a fellow TV guest. Scott Amedure's 
family had argued that a mentally ill Jonathan Schmitz was lured

	ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) -- A jury deadlocked today in the trial of a

presidential accuser Kathleen Willey. A federal judge declared a 
mistrial in the case of Julie Hiatt Steele, who was charged with 
obstruction of justice and lying to investigators. Steele's story

	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Paula Jones' lawyers asked a judge  
today to order President Clinton to pay nearly $500,000 in legal 
reimbursements for being found in contempt of court in her sexual 
harassment case. Clinton's lawyer called the request 
``unreasonable.'' The proposal came a month after a judge found 
Clinton in contempt for giving intentional, false testimony about 
his relationship with Monica Lewinsky during his January 1998 
deposition in the sexual harassment case. Wright ordered Clinton to 
pay Jones' lawyers any ``reasonable'' expenses they incurred as a

	TOKYO (AP) -- The Tokyo market's main index fell 2.05 percent on  
profit-taking today, shedding more than half of its nearly 
600-point gain the previous day. The dollar edged lower against the 
yen ahead of the release of key U.S. economic data. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 354.09 points,  
or 2.05 percent, closing the week at 16,946.52 points. On Thursday, 
the index climbed 599.08 points, or 3.59 percent, on expectations 
that the government may intensify efforts to stimulate the 
faltering economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 120.54 yen at late afternoon, up 0.06 yen from  
late Thursday in Tokyo and also above its late New York level of 
120.50 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, investors locked in profits after  
Thursday's sharp gains, in which the Nikkei index closed at its 
highest level since Oct. 24, 1997.

	Traders said high technology shares, including Sony and TDK,  
were among big losers in line with declines in similar U.S. 
high-tech stocks Thursday on Wall Street.

	In Tokyo trading, Sony fell $2.30 to $91.70 per share, TDK lost  
$2.10 to $74.30.

<HEADLINE> Underdog Wolves Take on No. 1 Spurs  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- San Antonio is the No. 1 seed in the Western  
Conference, but isn't taking No. 8 Minnesota lightly in the NBA 
playoffs. That's because Minnesota has Kevin Garnett. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a great player. He's a handful every time he steps on the  
court,'' San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich said. ``He's got a great 
work ethic. He's loaded with talent. And he's one of the best 
players in the league.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garnett and his Minnesota teammates face the Spurs in a  
best-of-5 first-round playoff series starting Sunday in the 
Alamodome. 
</P>
<P>
	San Antonio (37-13) enters the series having won 12 of its last  
13 games, including the last four decisive games that captured the 
Midwest Division title. 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota (25-25) won only five of its last 17 games and has  
lost its last 10 on the road. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite his team's underdog status, Garnett said he is  
confident. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not here to try to create some kind of controversy,''  
Garnett said before practice Friday. ``I just have a lot of 
confidence in my team, which I should have. It should be a fun 
series.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, Garnett became the first player in more than 20 years  
to be drafted directly out of high school. This season he ranks 
11th in the league in scoring (20.8) and ninth in rebounding 
(10.4). 
</P>
<P>
	``Kevin does whatever it takes. Usually the bigger the game, the  
better he's going to play,'' Timberwolves coach Flip Saunders said. 
``Kevin, he's anxious about this series.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The teams split four games this season, each team winning at  
home. In the Timberwolves' victories, both in February, Minnesota 
succeeded in limiting the shots of 7-footers Tim Duncan and David 
Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
	Garnett, at 6-foot-11, often is assigned to guard Duncan, but  
not always, Saunders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson averages 15.8 points and 10 rebounds a game. Duncan,  
who's gained some support lately for MVP, averages 21.7 points and 
11.4 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	After playing some of his best basketball of the season down the  
stretch, Robinson sat out of practice Friday and got treatment for 
soreness in his left knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Popovich said he wanted to give Robinson, a 10-year veteran, a  
day to rest and that there are no major problems with the leg. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson described this Spurs team, which began the season with  
a 6-8 record in February, as the most ``mentally tough'' squad he 
has played on. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's almost like we built in a short period of time, in a  
couple of months, what it takes a couple of years to build,'' he 
said. ``Basically we just kind of went out there and took what we 
wanted to get.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs won't take anything for granted against Minnesota, he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like our record is 0-0 again,'' Robinson said. ``We're  
going to be ultra-focused going into Sunday.''

<HEADLINE> Vanilla Ice Breaks Up MTV's Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It somehow seemed fitting when Vanilla Ice  
trashed MTV's lame party. 
</P>
<P>
	The network recently gathered four comedians for a smirking  
review of the 25 lamest music videos, as determined by viewers 
voting online. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``winning'' videos, to be revealed on the cable network  
starting Saturday at 1 p.m. EDT, will be exiled from MTV forever, 
their unique form of artistry never to be seen again. 
</P>
<P>
	``25 Lame'' is an appropriate exercise, perhaps even overdue.  
The network, a teen-ager itself at age 18, has seen video style go 
through enough changes to have a real history of its own. With MTV 
now refreshed and focused again after a few years of drifting, it's 
a good time to look back. 
</P>
<P>
	Unfortunately, ``25 Lame'' is something of a missed opportunity,  
and it's hard to know who's to blame: The viewers or MTV itself. 
</P>
<P>
	The three ``lamest'' videos -- skip the rest of this paragraph if  
you want to remain in suspense -- are by actors who were 
moonlighting in music: Eddie Murphy, Arsenio Hall and Don Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	Now that's just too lazy. Such vanity projects are by definition  
lame; there are good reasons why actors act rather than sing. And 
nobody even remembers seeing these videos. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson Phillips, Gerardo, Hammer, Debbie Gibson, Nelson ... they  
all make the list. Well, sure. It's easy to call them lame. A bold 
move would be to go after some cringe-worthy moments of people who 
count. Everyone loves Bruce Springsteen and Courteney Cox, for 
example, but have their careers ever seen a lamer moment than 
``Dancing in the Dark''? 
</P>
<P>
	Here are some suggested spoof targets: rap stars with messiah  
complexes, or those who think a video is worth beating someone up 
over (Puffy? Are you there, Puffy?). Or lumpy stars who cast 
gorgeous models as their girlfriends. Or lo-fi rock bands who think 
out-of-focus camera shots and black-and-white photography make an 
artistic statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, comics Jon Stewart, Denis Leary, Janeane Garofalo and  
Chris Kattan sit around making fun of musicians we already love to 
laugh at. Some videos were so dull, and unfamiliar, that they 
couldn't think of much to say. 
</P>
<P>
	Into the buzz saw strode Vanilla Ice, now a punk rocker using  
his given name Rob Van Winkle. He was delivering a copy of ``Ice 
Ice Baby,'' the glossy hit even he admits he can't stand anymore. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do you want to be called Vanilla Ice? Mr. Ice? Rob?'' a  
producer whispered to him backstage, before he went on the set. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rob,'' Van Winkle answered.  
</P>
<P>
	He watched ``Ice Ice Baby'' with the four comedians, who  
resisted mocking it with Van Winkle sitting next to them. At its 
end, he was handed a baseball bat for a symbolic crushing, and 
cryptically said he would give a taste of his new stage act. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Winkle shattered the video but didn't stop there. Another  
swing laid waste to a table, sending a shower of popcorn to the 
floor. He stalked over to a Debbie Gibson mannequin, which went 
sprawling after a direct hit between the eyes. He raised the bat 
over his head and prepared to hammer a VCR, but held back. Garofalo 
cowered in a fetal position, her arms protecting her head. 
</P>
<P>
	When he was done, the studio set looked like a living room  
trashed by a tornado. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mom said not to have a party while she was away,'' said a  
shaken Garofalo, who chain-smoked her way through the rest of the 
taping, ``and now look -- the house is trashed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was a wonderful moment, precisely because it was the only  
real mystery of the afternoon. Was Van Winkle just playing around? 
Was he really mad, taking vengeance on MTV for making him a star 
and then making him a joke? Was he nuts? No one was really sure. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm so ready to get rid of that video,'' he said later  
offstage. ``Every time I go somewhere, it's ding ding ding 
ding-ding-ding-ding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He used to be bitter toward MTV, and even descended into a  
drug-fueled suicide attempt five years ago. Since then, he has come 
to realize that whether you're being praised or ridiculed, it's 
only showbiz. 
</P>
<P>
	Nobody bothered cleaning up after Van Winkle, and the countdown  
ended with only one more incident. This happened backstage, when 
cameraman Peter Abraham had a sickening revelation while watching 
Don Johnson's ``Heartbeat'' video. 
</P>
<P>
	Abraham remembered working on the video's set a decade earlier  
as a production assistant, lugging equipment around and getting a 
hernia for his trouble. Fortunately for him, unlike Dweezil Zappa, 
Paul Shaffer and Johnson, the evidence of his participation wasn't 
preserved on tape. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kind of brings you full circle, eh?'' one of his colleagues  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Abraham responded with an expletive.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in television ...

<HEADLINE> Jagr Leading Penguins Into Round Two </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Is he the new Gretzky -- or simply a new  
Jaromir Jagr? 
</P>
<P>
	Many words are used to describe Jagr, hockey's most creative  
scorer and recognizable face now that Wayne Gretzky and Mario 
Lemieux are retired. Among them: fun-loving, charismatic, immature 
and gifted. 
</P>
<P>
	Here's one word never included until now: courageous.  
</P>
<P>
	Remember Willis Reed limping onto the court to help win Game 7  
of the 1970 NBA Finals for the New York Knicks? Many hockey fans 
will recall Jagr's performance in pain during the Pittsburgh 
Penguins' first-round upset of New Jersey with the same wonderment 
and respect. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was unbelievable what he did,'' said Pittsburgh teammate  
Martin Straka, invoking another adjective as synonymous with Jagr 
as his first name. 
</P>
<P>
	Barely able to skate because of a groin injury that sidelined  
him for four games, Jagr scored the tying goal late in the third 
period and the game-winner in overtime against top-seeded New 
Jersey in Game 6. 
</P>
<P>
	By doing so, he saved the Penguins not only from elimination,  
but possible extinction as the franchise's future is played out to 
an uncertain fate in bankruptcy court. 
</P>
<P>
	Jagr was almost as good in Game 7, drawing so much attention  
from the snare drum-tight Devils that it changed the tempo of the 
game. He set up the final two goals as the last-seeded Penguins 
upset the top-seeded Devils, finishing off the greatest upset in 
franchise history. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, with a second-round series against Toronto set to begin  
tonight, what possibly could be left for Jagr to do? 
</P>
<P>
	As it turns out, quite a lot.  
</P>
<P>
	``I went into it to win the Stanley Cup. I'm not going for  
anything else,'' said Jagr, who is not close to 100 percent but 
still expects to play. ``I know that sounds very confident, but 
that is the way I am. I think we have the chance to beat anybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Preposterous? So was beating the Devils.  
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky passed the torch, and the title of ``hockey's greatest  
player,'' to Jagr during teary-eyed ceremonies last month, spoiled 
only a little when Jagr sent Gretzky out a loser by scoring the 
game-winning goal in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, Jagr -- once derided as being too self-centered,  
ingenuous and childlike to be the leader of men, much less of an 
entire sport -- has been a fitting replacement for hockey's one 
irreplaceable player. 
</P>
<P>
	``The greatest player leaves the game and the next greatest  
player scores in overtime, just to announce who the next guy is,'' 
Penguins coach Kevin Constantine said. 
</P>
<P>
	Constantine got his share of grief for overseeing Jagr's  
appointment last fall as the Penguins' captain. Jagr always was 
more of a follower of former captains Lemieux and Ron Francis than 
a leader, and his penchant for speaking his mind -- especially in 
disagreement with his coach -- is not a quality sought in a captain. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jaromir not only is the best player on this team, he is the  
best player in the world,'' Constantine said. ``He needs to be the 
captain of this team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Constantine's faith in Jagr as a leader was justified by the  
Jersey series. Jagr's valorous effort likely would be the talk of 
the sports world if the NHL had the high national profile of the 
NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could not watch,'' Jagr said. ``I had to play.''  
</P>
<P>
	Clearly, Jagr no longer is the impressionable 18-year-old who  
was fascinated by fast cars and fast skating when he came into the 
league in 1990. He is 27, more worldly and adult. He doesn't 
frequent night clubs or casinos as before. He talks privately of a 
personal spiritual reawakening in his native Czech Republic last 
summer, though he will not expound on it. 
</P>
<P>
	Even more remarkably, Jagr's play has come against the backdrop  
of the Penguins' uncertain fate as the NHL presses for a resolution 
of bankruptcy proceedings. It is possible the Penguins will know 
definitely they are headed for another city even before the 
playoffs are over. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux saved hockey in Pittsburgh. Jagr is trying to do it  
again, by taking the Penguins so deep into the playoffs that he 
rallies civic and business leaders to help preserve them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think my goal is going to save the team in Pittsburgh.  
It has nothing to do with that, but I think the city and everybody 
should support Mario,'' Jagr said. ``We're just trying to win the 
Cup.''

<HEADLINE> Venezuela To Sell Electric Cos. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- The government of President Hugo  
Chavez, who campaigned for office deriding what he called savage 
capitalism and neoliberal free-market policies, plans to privatize 
three electric utilities by year end. 
</P>
<P>
	Talks have been held with potential investors for the three  
companies, Enelco, Enerven and Enelbar, said Antonio Giner, the 
newly appointed head of the Venezuelan Investment Fund. He remained 
tightlipped on prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Giner also reiterated the government's plan to sell all the  
assets of Venalum, an aluminum operation that makes 430,000 tons a 
year. Giner said Venezuela is also seeking a partner Alcasa, a 
smaller aluminum producer. 
</P>
<P>
	The comments were the government's first formal announcement  
concerning the sale of state assets. Chavez criticized such 
policies during last year's electoral campaign, but has softened 
his position. 
</P>
<P>
	The government is selling the companies as part of its plan to  
close a record budget deficit of $8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Chavez, the leader of a failed 1992 coup attempt, took office  
three months ago.

<HEADLINE> Scientist Denies Leaking Secrets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After weeks of silence, a Taiwanese-born  
scientist suspected of espionage at a federal nuclear lab is 
vigorously denying he gave secrets to China, or any unauthorized 
persons. 
</P>
<P>
	A six-page statement released by his lawyer said that the  
scientist, Wen Ho Lee, ``will not be a scapegoat for alleged 
security problems at our country's nuclear laboratories.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lee, 59, was fired from the Los Alamos National Laboratory in  
New Mexico on March 8 for alleged security violations. He has been 
under investigation by the FBI since 1996 as a prime suspect in the 
theft of nuclear weapons secrets in the 1980s. Lee has not been 
charged with a crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Government officials have said that when investigators searched  
Lee's computer at Los Alamos they found evidence that more than 
1,000 files containing so-called legacy codes -- the codes that 
provide design and performance data on nuclear warheads -- had been 
transferred from the secure to the unsecure computer system. Lee 
was accused of transferring the top-secret codes to his personal 
computer, which could be accessed from the outside. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lee statement said that ``contrary to press reports, Dr.  
Lee's computer files contained dozens of nonclassified codes, which 
included several hundred thousand lines of code.'' It said that Lee 
had changed file names ``to reflect improvements he had made in 
(the) nonclassified codes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No mention was made in the statement of any classified codes  
being found. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee's lawyer, Mark Holscher, who issued the statement, did not  
return a telephone call to his Los Angeles office. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dr. Lee ... has not and will not ever provide classified  
information to anyone,'' the statement said. ``Dr. Lee has never 
given classified computer files to any unauthorized person. In 
fact, Dr. Lee took substantial steps to protect his computer 
files.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While acknowledging that Lee had made two trips to China in the  
1980s, the statement said both trips were cleared in advance. The 
trips were to attend scientific conferences and were ``with the 
full knowledge and approval of the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation,'' the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, said the statement, Lee's wife attended one of the  
conferences at the request of the FBI so she could obtain 
background information on Chinese scientists. 
</P>
<P>
	``At no time during or after the pre-approved 1986 or 1988 trips  
did Dr. Lee ever provide any classified information whatsoever to 
any representative of mainland China, nor has he ever given any 
classified information to any unauthorized person,'' said the 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	In a related matter, government officials acknowledged Friday  
that another scientist at Los Alamos was disciplined and briefly 
suspended from his job last year after classified material was 
found in his desktop computer, which was part of the unsecure 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	The scientist, who was not identified, was cleared of any  
criminal intent and investigators concluded the transfer of files 
had been ``inadvertent,'' according to a government official who 
spoke on condition of not being identified further.

<HEADLINE>  Pope Arrives in Romania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) -- Pope John Paul II arrived in Romania  
today for the first visit by a pontiff to a mainly Eastern Orthodox 
Christian country in almost 1,000 years. 
</P>
<P>
	John Paul embraced the leader of the country's Orthodox Church,  
Patriarch Teoctist, after stepping off his plane at Bucharest's 
Baneasa airport. He then walked along a red carpet holding 
President Emil Constantinescu's hand and was greeted by a group of 
children, who gave him bread and salt, a traditional Romanian 
welcome. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is the first time that Divine Providence offered me the  
possibility to make an apostolic trip to a mainly Orthodox 
country,'' John Paul said, in thanking the patriarch. 
</P>
<P>
	In particular, he said he hoped the trip would help ``heal the  
wounds'' in the relations between the two churches, referring to 
the persecution of Catholics under the communist regime that was 
overthrown in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	The pope's visit, part of his drive for reconciliation among the  
various Christian denominations as the new millennium approaches, 
has spurred hopes for greater unity between the Roman Catholic and 
Orthodox churches in Romania. 
</P>
<P>
	A pope has not set foot in a predominantly Orthodox Christian  
country since the Great Schism of 1054, when the Eastern church 
definitively split from Rome. 
</P>
<P>
	``This visit will promote ... more understanding not only in our  
own lives but also in the lives of the churches,'' Patriarch 
Teoctist said. 
</P>
<P>
	The patriarch and the pope, both in white robes, rode together  
in the popemobile along a seven-mile route from the airport to 
Bucharest's Orthodox Cathedral. Several thousand people lined the 
roadway. 
</P>
<P>
	The two men then stood side by side during a prayer service that  
was broadcast on television across the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Orthodox Romanians question the timing of the pontiff's  
visit while NATO strikes Orthodox Serbs in neighboring Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is risky because it could anger other Orthodox churches,''  
said Dan Ciachir, a commentator on Orthodox affairs. ``The West is 
throwing bombs on an Orthodox country and the pope is going to an 
Orthodox country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Orthodox Bishop Nifon Mihaita said Thursday he did not expect  
any criticism from the Russian Orthodox Church, which has strong 
links with the Serbs. Both countries are Slav Orthodox. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't need to ask Russia's permission (to invite the  
pope),'' said Mihaita at a news conference. ``Even under communism 
we didn't do this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Orthodox church is made up of 15 autonomous denominations  
with 300 million members, most of whom are in Eastern Europe. 
Almost 90 percent of Romania's 23 million are Orthodox faithful. 
</P>
<P>
	For months, Romania has been inching toward issuing the  
invitation, which became possible only when the Orthodox and 
Romania's Catholics agreed to set aside a dispute over ownership of 
some 2,500 Catholic churches that were seized by the communists in 
1948 and transferred to Orthodox parishes. 
</P>
<P>
	Clergy agreed to stop insulting each other and refrain from  
fighting. In one bitter dispute in a Transylvanian cathedral last 
year, the faithful brawled in a contested cathedral, overturning 
the altar and hurling holy objects at each other. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the Orthodox are not ready to allow the pope to visit  
Transylvania, home to most of Romania's Catholics, fearing he may 
undercut their authority. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of thousands of Romanians are just curious to see the  
pope are expected to attend services held in the capital this 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	In the capital, roads have been repaired, white traffic lines  
drawn and shrubbery pruned. Some 7,000 security officials will 
ensure the safety of the pope. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents on Bucharest's main boulevards have been asked to keep  
their windows closed and the sale of alcohol is banned. But the 
safety measures are not as stringent as those for President Clinton 
and pop star Michael Jackson when they visited.

<HEADLINE> Feds Sue Firm for Misleading Public </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A company that allegedly mailed millions of  
American households a $15 offer for services that the government 
provides for free, such as changing a new bride's name on her 
Social Security records, is facing federal fraud charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Barbara S. Jones of the U.S. District Court for the  
Southern District of New York issued a temporary restraining order 
against Federal Record Service Corp. immediately after the 
government filed a lawsuit on Thursday accusing the company of 
fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	``The lawsuit seeks to ensure that consumers will not be  
victimized,'' said Mary Jo White, the U.S. Attorney for the 
district. 
</P>
<P>
	Company officials did not immediately respond to requests for  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the suit, Federal Record Service sent letters to  
newlywed couples or families with new babies. In the letters, the 
company offered, for a $15 fee, to help obtain a new Social 
Security number and card for a new baby or an updated card for a 
bride who had changed her name. 
</P>
<P>
	Most new parents, whether they know it or not, order a Social  
Security number for their newborn as part of the birth registration 
process at the hospital. If not, forms to do so can be obtained for 
free at any local Social Security office or by calling a toll-free 
government number. Similarly, Social Security will make name 
changes for free. 
</P>
<P>
	When someone accepted the Federal Record Service offer, the  
company would often simply mail them the appropriate free form and 
pocket the $15, Social Security officials said. Other times victims 
would never hear back from the company at all. 
</P>

	Federal Record Service is incorporated in New York and Florida,

<HEADLINE> Gold Down on British Selling  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Gold futures tumbled 2.4 percent Friday on the New York  
Mercantile Exchange after British officials announced plans to sell 
more than half that kingdom's reserves, reigniting long-held fears 
of substantial sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Palladium futures moved sharply higher. On other markets, energy  
futures continued their retreat. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold fell after United Kingdom Treasury officials said they  
would sell 415 metric tons of gold out of its 715 metric ton, $6 
billion reserve stock to buy better-yielding bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	The news shook what had been newfound investor confidence in the  
metal after months in which prices were depressed on fears of heavy 
central bank selling. Many nations have considered reducing their 
gold holdings recently because of the expense of storage and the 
relatively poor financial returns, and the latest news is causing 
concern that they will revisit the issue and try to beat others to 
sell for better prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts have noted that the recent silence on the possibility  
of large-scale sales has prompted heavy buying of metals from 
speculators, who are seeking underpriced alternatives to 
high-flying stock values. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold for June delivery fell $7 to $283.70 an ounce. The  
announcement also caused sharp declines in stocks of gold mining 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Palladium futures continued their sharp recovery from losses  
made last week after investors bet that recent heavy sales from 
Russia were an aberration and that a normal delivery schedule will 
not be set for weeks at the earliest. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia is the world's largest producer of the metal and its  
virtual control over the market has caused prices to soar for three 
consecutive years after it halted shipments in December. 
</P>
<P>
	While some Western automobile manufacturers have begun to seek  
alternatives to the erratic delivery schedule, many still rely on 
palladium for use in making emission-control devices. 
</P>
<P>
	June palladium rose $22.65 to $336.10 an ounce.  
</P>
<P>
	Crude continued its retreat on the New York Mercantile Exchange  
amid fears sharply higher prices will prompt world oil producers to 
exceed their stated output. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors continued to react to comments made a day earlier by  
executives from Royal Dutch-Shell Group. They expressed pessimism 
about producers' ability to hold oil off the market, a concern that 
threw cold water on what had been a hot rally to the highest 
futures price for crude in 17 months. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries  
and other key producers, including Mexico and Norway, have agreed 
to cut output 2.1 million barrels, on top of 3 million barrels they 
agreed to take off the market last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices have jumped amid indications the cuts are being made, but  
analysts and others have warned that OPEC does not have a history 
of lasting cohesiveness. 
</P>
<P>
	June crude fell 10 cents to $18.22 a barrel; June heating oil  
fell 0.99 cent to 43.23 cents a gallon; June unleaded gasoline fell 
1.23 cents to 5.321 cents a gallon; June natural gas fell 2.2 cents 
to $2.273 for each 1,000 cubic feet.

<HEADLINE> Sun Changes Strategy on Java Specs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Sun Microsystems Inc. has submitted  
specifications for its Java software technology to a European 
standards body, changing its strategy to get the computer language 
approved as an international standard. 
</P>
<P>
	Sun originally said it would submit an application to the  
International Organization for Standardization, known as the ISO, 
but abandoned that plan because of alleged opposition from 
Microsoft and others, The Wall Street Journal reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Sun hopes to gain approval from the ECMA, formerly  
known as the European Computer Manufacturers Association, and then 
submit it to ISO for fast-track approval. Sun submitted Java to the 
ECMA Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Alan Baratz, the head of Sun's Java software group, cited  
lobbying efforts by the company's rivals as the reason behind the 
change in tactics, according to the Journal. 
</P>
<P>
	Sun and Microsoft have repeatedly clashed over Sun's claims that  
Microsoft has altered the Java language to be compatible only with 
Windows-based programs, a violation of their contract agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Sun, based in Palo Alto, Calif., is eager to maintain control of  
Java, a computer language which allows software to run on a variety 
of computer operating systems. 
</P>
<P>
	ECMA appears to favor Sun's approach of seeking industry input  
for changes to Java while maintaining control over future versions 
of the technology, the Journal said.

<HEADLINE> Julie Hiatt Steele Jury Deadlocked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) -- Jurors said today they were ``hopelessly  
deadlocked'' in the case of Julie Hiatt Steele, who is charged with 
obstructing Kenneth Starr's investigation of President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Claude Hilton ordered the jurors to ``make  
one more attempt'' to reach a verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel of five men and seven women had already deliberated  
for 7 1/2 hours over two days in the trial of Ms. Steele, who is 
charged with making false statements that undercut her former 
friend Kathleen Willey's allegation of an unwanted sexual advance 
by Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has denied the allegation.  
</P>
<P>
	Jurors sent a note this afternoon reading, ``The jury is  
hopelessly deadlocked,'' prompting Ms. Steele's attorneys to 
suggest to the judge a mistrial might be in order. 
</P>
<P>
	Noting that ``it was only a three-day trial'' lawyer Eric  
Dubelier said ```hopelessly' is a pretty strong word.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Prosecutor David Barger urged that the deliberations  
continue. ``I don't believe we have been at it that long,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	At that point the judge called the jurors into the courtroom to  
ask whether they were deadlocked on all four felony counts. The 
foreman confirmed they were, and the jurors were sent back to the 
jury room. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele is charged with three counts of obstructing justice  
and one count of making false statements in an FBI interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier today, the jury sent the judge a note requesting  
additional information about an exhibit. He didn't provide it. 
</P>
<P>
	The case centered on discrepancies between the stories told to  
investigators by Ms. Steele and Mrs. Willey. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Willey testified that she rebuffed a ``very forceful''  
sexual advance by the president while meeting with him in the White 
House in November 1993, and told Ms. Steele about the incident 
hours after it occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele said the first time she ever heard of a  
Clinton-Willey encounter was in March 1997, when Mrs. Willey called 
her and asked her to lie about it to a Newsweek reporter. 
</P>
<P>
	In closing arguments, Starr's prosecutors used Ms. Steele's own  
words to make a point they had been unable to elicit from the 
testimony of one of President Clinton's lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton lawyer Mitch Ettinger this week gave what could prove  
helpful testimony to Ms. Steele, refusing to concede the importance 
of an affidavit she signed for the president's lawyers in the Paula 
Jones sexual harassment case against the president. 
</P>
<P>
	Undermining Mrs. Willey's story of an unwanted sexual advance by  
Clinton, Ms. Steele's affidavit said Mrs. Willey got Ms. Steele to 
lie for her to a Newsweek reporter about the Clinton-Willey 
encounter. Starr's office said the affidavit was false and charged 
Ms. Steele with obstructing the Jones case, as well as Starr's 
investigation. Mrs. Willey said she confided the Clinton advance to 
Ms. Steele hours after it allegedly happened in 1993. Ms. Steele's 
affidavit denies that, saying she first learned of the incident in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Is it ``fair to say'' Ms. Steele's affidavit was ``pretty useful  
stuff in the civil case?'' Starr prosecutor David Barger pressed 
Ettinger. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ultimately it was not used'' and ``I can't sit here today and  
say that her affidavit was useful,'' said Ettinger, who turned 
aside repeated efforts by Barger to acknowledge the affidavit was a 
significant document. 
</P>
<P>
	Steele lawyer Andrew Hurst highlighted Ettinger's testimony  
Thursday, telling U.S. District Judge Claude Hilton that Starr must 
make a showing that Ms. Steele obstructed the Jones proceeding, but 
``Ettinger didn't say that.'' In seeking unsuccessfully to dismiss 
the case against Ms. Steele, Hurst characterized Ettinger's 
testimony as saying ``thanks a lot'' for the affidavit ``and tossed 
it in the trash can on his way out the door.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Circumventing Ettinger's unhelpful testimony, Starr prosecutor  
Stephen Binhak in closing arguments pulled out Ms. Steele's own 
grand jury testimony as the jury in her criminal trial prepared to 
begin deliberating Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Last June to Starr's grand jury, Ms. Steele stressed she  
understood the implications of signing the affidavit, testifying 
the document was to be used in the Jones case ``to refute Kathleen 
Willey's testimony'' and ``in an arena where it counted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt I had a moral responsibility to tell the truth where it  
counted and that's why I provided it and that was its intended 
use,'' Ms. Steele testified. 
</P>
<P>
	To prove their case, prosecutors must not only demonstrate that  
Ms. Steele's affidavit was false, but that it was important to the 
Jones case.

<HEADLINE> West Point Looks To Raise Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST POINT, N.Y. (AP) -- The Long Gray Line is looking for some  
green. 
</P>
<P>
	Alumni of the U.S. Military Academy announced Friday a campaign  
to raise $150 million to endow professorships, expand student 
recruitment and improve athletic buildings and equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not the first time that money has been raised for the  
school. More than $40 million in donations has been received since 
1973. But the new effort marks the first time money has been 
solicited on a grand scale since West Point's founding in 1802. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Defense Department funds almost all of the school's  
$175 million annual operating costs, school officials say more 
money is needed to stay competitive with other institutions in 
attracting the most desirable faculty and students. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to make sure that West Point maintains itself as a  
tier-one quality institution,'' said Lieut. Gen. Daniel W. 
Christman, the school's superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
	West Point already has raised nearly two-thirds of the money  
during a quiet, two-year effort to tap the school's best donors. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign is being run by an alumni group because federal  
employees can't legally ask for money from private donors. 
Contributions will be reviewed by Army lawyers to avoid conflicts 
of interests from corporate sources and defense contractors. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at the Naval and Air Force academies say they expect  
to undertake similar efforts.

<HEADLINE> Tuinei To Get Private Services </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PLANO, Texas (AP) -- Former Dallas Cowboys lineman Mark Tuinei  
was not breathing when he was found in his car, according to the 
911 tape released Friday by Plano police. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is not breathing?'' the emergency-services dispatcher is  
heard asking the man who placed the call. 
</P>
<P>
	``No, ah, he stopped breathing, I guess last night,'' the man  
answered. ``I can't feel a pulse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesman Carl Duke said police know the caller's identity but  
declined to name him. The man gave the name ``Nicky'' to the 
dispatcher. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dallas Morning News reported that Tuinei was accompanied by  
Cowboys reserve fullback Nicky Sualua when he picked up a black 
1933 Ford roadster from a repair shop in nearby Carrollton on 
Wednesday. Tuinei was found unconscious in the roadster Thursday 
morning while the car was parked in a driveway alongside his Plano 
house. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper said two police detectives left Cowboys  
headquarters in Irving on Thursday afternoon with Sualua crouched 
in the back seat. 
</P>
<P>
	Sualua was unavailable for comment and did not respond to a  
message left at his home. 
</P>
<P>
	A private memorial service is scheduled for 1 p.m. Saturday at  
the Trinity Christian Academy in the Dallas suburb of Addison. 
Cowboys spokesman Rich Dalrymple said the Tuinei family, including 
his wife, Ponolani, requested that only family and close friends 
attend. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators on Friday were awaiting toxicology reports that  
they hope will pinpoint the cause of the 39-year-old player's 
death.

<HEADLINE> Project Restoring Utah Salt Flats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- It's springtime, and the Bonneville Salt  
Flats -- where race car drivers have been breaking speed records for 
generations -- are under water, a shallow pool mirroring the 
mountains beyond. 
</P>
<P>
	But in a few weeks, winter's rainwater will evaporate, leaving a  
blazing white stretch of salt that curves off into the distance 
like a shoreline with no ocean. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, the salt will probably be a little bit thicker than  
last. 
</P>
<P>
	About half an inch thicker, in fact -- a total of 1.9 million  
tons of salt spread across 28,000 acres, according to the federal 
Bureau of Land Management, which reported the preliminary results 
of a 2-year-old salt restoration project. 
</P>
<P>
	The results are good news for racing enthusiasts worried that  
the Bonneville Salt Flats are deteriorating, the salt stripped away 
by mining and erosion. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's real exciting,'' said Rick Vesco, a race driver who  
helped found Save the Salt, the group that pushed for the salt 
restoration. ``It was getting so that there wasn't going to be any 
more salt flats.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Save the Salt began in 1989, when the drivers who gather on the  
flats each summer noticed the salt was so thin that the sticky mud 
underneath was slowing down their cars. The seven-mile loop used to 
be nearly twice as long, and parts of the track had some 18 inches 
of salt in the 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
	Vesco said it's now down below a half-inch in spots.  
</P>
<P>
	Actually, that's just the upper salt crust, created from sodium  
chloride that percolates from the soil into the winter rainwater. 
The salt is left behind when the water evaporates, then is polished 
smooth by the desert winds. 
</P>
<P>
	Below that is a layer of gypsum up to an inch thick, then 3 to 5  
inches of hard, porous salt, then another stratum of gypsum and 
another of salt. At the base is the mudbed of ancient Lake 
Bonneville, which covered a third of what is now Utah about 15,000 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The flats -- so wide you can see the curvature of the Earth -- are  
famous for their perfect racetrack, which has been used since the 
1910s. 
</P>
<P>
	But for almost as long, the gleaming moonscape on the  
Utah-Nevada state line has also been mined for potash fertilizer. 
</P>
<P>
	Reilly Industries, which bought the Bonneville potash plant from  
Kaiser Chemical in 1988, forces water through canals crisscrossing 
the flats into evaporation ponds, from which the potash is removed. 
But the process also strips an estimated 850,000 tons of salt from 
the flats each year, leaving it in the ponds in heaps up to 4 feet 
high. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Reilly is reversing the process and pumping brine back out  
onto the flats -- as much as 7,000 gallons per minute. The company, 
which is spending $1 million in initial expenses and $80,000 a year 
to maintain the pumps, estimates that when the water evaporates, it 
should leave half an inch of new salt per year. 
</P>
<P>
	Save the Salt negotiated a deal under which Reilly puts up the  
money and BLM monitors the results. Most of the land is government 
property. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a good scenario where the goverment and industry is  
working with recreational interests and it's a win-win situation 
for everyone,'' Vesco said. ``Working together is better than 
fighting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The laydown project began in November 1997, with the plan of  
pumping 1.5 million tons of salt onto the flats each year for at 
least five years. That first winter, breakdowns and other glitches 
meant only 825,000 tons went out. 
</P>
<P>
	But this winter, the project exceeded expectations. An estimated  
1.9 million tons were pumped back out. 
</P>
<P>
	The first driver to run on the salt was Teddy Tezlaff, who set a  
record of 141.73 mph in 1914 in a Blitzen Benz. Others followed, 
including Craig Breedlove, who set a land speed record of 600.6 mph 
in the 1960s, and Gary Gabelich, who set a record of 622.4 mph in 
1970. 
</P>
<P>
	Amateur hot rodders still flock to Bonneville. But lately, top  
racers like Breedlove have migrated to Nevada's Black Rock Desert, 
where they say the dry riverbed has more speed. 
</P>
<P>
	Save the Salt hopes the salt restoration will re-establish  
Bonneville's claim as the nation's fastest test track. The group 
also wants to make sure the flats stay white and gleaming. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're a nearly unique geological phenomenon,'' said BLM  
spokesman Don Banks. ``And we're trying to figure out how to 
maintain not just this geologic oddity and landmark, but also its 
historical use.''

<HEADLINE>  Labor Party Runs First in Scotland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Scots choosing their first Parliament in three  
centuries gave the lion's share of votes to Prime Minister Tony 
Blair's Labor Party but not enough for outright control, early 
returns indicated today. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe and I hope that, out of these elections, the union  
of the United Kingdom will have strengthened rather than 
weakened,'' said Blair, who proposed the parliament as part of a 
radical constitutional shakeup. 
</P>
<P>
	With 115 races decided in the 129-member chamber, Labor had won  
56 seats and some 40 percent of the vote, compared to 28 seats and 
about 30 percent for the independence-seeking Scottish National 
Party. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the minority parties, the Conservatives had 13 seats and the  
Liberal Democrats 16. Independents, both leftists, won two seats in 
Thursday's balloting. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is our first democratic parliament for Scotland for  
nearly 300 years. Our people have voted for it, our people deserve 
it,'' said Donald Dewar, the Scottish secretary in Blair's Cabinet 
and the likely leader of the new Scottish government. 
</P>
<P>
	The British Broadcasting Corp. predicted early today a final  
tally of Labor 56, SNP 36, Conservatives 18, Liberal Democrats 17 
and others 2. 
</P>
<P>
	The results affirmed that a large majority of Scots are content,  
for now, with a degree of self-government within the United 
Kingdom. And Labor, as the dominant partner in the new government, 
will have an opportunity to prove that a settlement short of 
independence can satisfy the aspirations of most Scottish people. 
</P>
<P>
	Wales also elected members to a new but less powerful assembly.  
But the vote for the 60-seat body was marked by apathy among the 3 
million people of the principality, where there is no strong push 
for independence. More than half the voters stayed away. 
</P>
<P>
	With 20 seats decided, Labor had won 17; Plaid Cymru, two; and  
the Conservatives, one. However, Plaid Cymru captured Islwyn, a 
former mining district in south Wales, reaching into Labor's 
heartland from its traditional bastions in the Welsh-speaking 
north. 
</P>
<P>
	In elections for local authorities across most of Britain, the  
Conservatives, the main opposition group in the House of Commons in 
London, staged a modest recovery from the depths of a national 
defeat in 1997 by recapturing scores of seats on local governing 
councils. 
</P>
<P>
	The representatives elected in Scotland and Wales will be  
pioneers in implementing Blair's program to decentralize power 
within the United Kingdom. Northern Ireland earlier elected members 
to its new Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
	That result would force Labor to seek a coalition partner, most  
likely the centrist Liberal Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Conservative gains in local elections may provide some breathing  
space for William Hague, the hard-pressed party leader who 
succeeded former Prime Minister John Major after the Tories were 
humiliated in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The Scottish National Party had pulled even with Labor after  
Scots voted overwhelmingly in 1997 in favor of setting up their own 
Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
	But the nationalists faded during a campaign in which they  
promised to raise taxes and party leader Alex Salmond denounced 
NATO airstrikes against Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Blair and his party campaigned hard on the theme that Scotland  
was better off as part of the United Kingdom. Scotland and England 
have been subject to the same monarch since 1603, and were formally 
united in 1707. Scotland has retained a distinctive system of laws 
and education, and its established church is Presbyterian, not 
Anglican. 
</P>
<P>
	Labor's most embarrassing result came in Falkirk West, where its  
candidate was beaten by a lawmaker who has effectively been kicked 
out of the Labor Party. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis Canavan, who had run as an independent after his party  
refused to nominate him for the Scottish assembly, rolled up a 3-1 
margin over the official Labor nominee. 
</P>
<P>
	``The brilliance of my victory is tinged a wee bit with sorrow --  
sorrow in that I am not standing before you as a member of a party 
in which I was virtually born and brought up,'' said Canavan, a 
left-winger who accused the party of ``Stalinist'' tactics in 
denying him a nomination in Scotland. 
</P>
<P>
	Scotland voted 2-1 in favor of its own Parliament in 1997, while  
Welsh voters barely mustered a majority in favor of their less 
powerful, 60-seat Assembly. Unlike the Welsh, Scots will have the 
power to legislate on domestic affairs and to set taxes within 
limits set by the central government.

Liberal Democrats 16. Independents, both leftists, won two seats in 
Thursday's balloting. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is our first democratic parliament for Scotland for  
nearly 300 years. Our people have voted for it, our people deserve 
it,'' said Donald Dewar, the Scottish secretary in Blair's Cabinet 
and the likely leader of the new Scottish government. 
</P>
<P>
	The British Broadcasting Corp. predicted early today a final  
tally of Labor 56, SNP 36, Conservatives 18, Liberal Democrats 17 
and others 2. 
</P>
<P>
	The results affirmed that a large majority of Scots are content,  
for now, with a degree of self-government within the United 
Kingdom. And Labor, as the dominant partner in the new government, 
will have an opportunity to prove that a settlement short of 
independence can satisfy the aspirations of most Scottish people. 
</P>
<P>
	Wales also elected members to a new but less powerful assembly.  
But the vote for the 60-seat body was marked by apathy among the 3 
million people of the principality, where there is no strong push 
for independence. More than half the voters stayed away. 
</P>
<P>
	With 20 seats decided, Labor had won 17; Plaid Cymru, two; and  
the Conservatives, one. However, Plaid Cymru captured Islwyn, a 
former mining district in south Wales, reaching into Labor's 
heartland from its traditional bastions in the Welsh-speaking 
north. 
</P>
<P>
	In elections for local authorities across most of Britain, the  
Conservatives, the main opposition group in the House of Commons in 
London, staged a modest recovery from the depths of a national 
defeat in 1997 by recapturing scores of seats on local governing 
councils. 
</P>
<P>
	The representatives elected in Scotland and Wales will be  
pioneers in implementing Blair's program to decentralize power 
within the United Kingdom. Northern Ireland earlier elected members 
to its new Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
	That result would force Labor to seek a coalition partner, most  
likely the centrist Liberal Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Conservative gains in local elections may provide some breathing  
space for William Hague, the hard-pressed party leader who 
succeeded former Prime Minister John Major after the Tories were 
humiliated in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The Scottish National Party had pulled even with Labor after  
Scots voted overwhelmingly in 1997 in favor of setting up their own 
Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
	But the nationalists faded during a campaign in which they  
promised to raise taxes and party leader Alex Salmond denounced 
NATO airstrikes against Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Blair and his party campaigned hard on the theme that Scotland  
was better off as part of the United Kingdom. Scotland and England 
have been subject to the same monarch since 1603, and were formally 
united in 1707. Scotland has retained a distinctive system of laws 
and education, and its established church is Presbyterian, not 
Anglican. 
</P>
<P>
	Labor's most embarrassing result came in Falkirk West, where its  
candidate was beaten by a lawmaker who has effectively been kicked 
out of the Labor Party. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis Canavan, who had run as an independent after his party  
refused to nominate him for the Scottish assembly, rolled up a 3-1 
margin over the official Labor nominee. 
</P>
<P>
	``The brilliance of my victory is tinged a wee bit with sorrow --  
sorrow in that I am not standing before you as a member of a party 
in which I was virtually born and brought up,'' said Canavan, a 
left-winger who accused the party of ``Stalinist'' tactics in 
denying him a nomination in Scotland. 
</P>
<P>
	Scotland voted 2-1 in favor of its own Parliament in 1997, while  
Welsh voters barely mustered a majority in favor of their less 
powerful, 60-seat Assembly. Unlike the Welsh, Scots will have the 
power to legislate on domestic affairs and to set taxes within 
limits set by the central government.

<HEADLINE> De Niro Presses Case Against Judge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Robert De Niro appeared in court Friday to press  
his case against a judge who hauled him in last year for 
questioning in a probe of an international prostitution ring. 
</P>
<P>
	De Niro, accompanied by his French lawyer, informed Judge Herve  
Stephan of his reasons for filing a complaint against Judge 
Frederic N'Guyen, whom the actor accused of leading a ``witch 
hunt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The actor denied any involvement in the ring and denied ever  
paying women for sex. His complaint against N'Guyen, filed in 
March, is said to accuse N'Guyen of revealing ``judicial secrets'' 
and invasion of privacy. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, former Culture Minister Jack Lang and  
Bernard-Henri Levy, a respected French philosopher, were fined for 
slandering N'Guyen, whom they criticized for questioning De Niro.

<HEADLINE> Prom Dresses Healing Tornado Wounds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDMOND, Okla. (AP) -- The girls of Del City had seen twisters  
turn their neighborhoods to splinters. But on this night, it was 
their own reflections in the mirror that took their breath away. 
</P>
<P>
	Three days after Monday's tornadoes, students from rival Edmond  
North High School collected more than 600 gowns along with shoes, 
makeup and beaded purses and offered them to the Del City High 
School girls for Saturday night's junior-senior prom. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday night, the Del City girls went to Edmond North to  
pick out their dresses. 
</P>
<P>
	They glittered in sequins. Shimmered in floor-length satin.  
Crossed and uncrossed their arms shyly. Tugged at the thin straps. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do you like it?'' 15-year-old Sarah McCormick asked, turning  
hesitantly before the restroom mirror in a two-piece number that 
revealed her belly-button ring. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh, it's so cool!'' a cluster of girls from Edmond North  
gasped over her shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	Last fall, these same students yelled from opposite sides of a  
stadium as their football teams battled on the field. 
</P>
<P>
	After the tornadoes, Edmond North officials heard that some Del  
City girls had lost everything and had nothing to wear for their 
prom, which will be held in Oklahoma City. (The theme, selected 
before the twisters hit, will be ``A Night to Remember.'') 
</P>
<P>
	The Edmond North student council jumped into action.  
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people might say there's other important things to  
worry about, but for us, the prom is so important,'' said student 
council president Marilyn Klopp, 18, adding that it took her three 
hours to get ready for her own prom in April. 
</P>
<P>
	The calls went out. Gowns poured in. A local tuxedo shop  
promised to take care of the boys. Dorothy Kelly brought 125 prom 
dresses from her formal wear shop in Oklahoma City. ``It's just one 
less disappointment, don't you think?'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, an Edmond school bus rolled up to Del City High,  
which has been turned into a relief shelter, to take the girls to a 
try-on session. With downed phone lines hampering communication, 
only a few got on board for the 20-minute drive to Edmond. 
</P>
<P>
	Rain leaking through the holes in the roof of Miss McCormick's  
home ruined the royal blue gown she bought two weeks ago. She was 
unprepared for what she saw inside Edmond North. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold gowns, red gowns, black gowns, short gowns, puffy gowns --  
gowns of all sizes hung in neat rows. Hundreds of shoes, even 
size-11 pink pumps, spilled across the floor. Tubes of lipstick, 
bottles of nail polish and eye shadow compacts -- donated new by 
cosmetic saleswomen -- covered a table. 
</P>
<P>
	Nelisha Hamilton, a Del City sophomore, grinned shyly as an  
Edmond North student rubbed makeup into her cheek, looking for the 
right match. Then, a group of girls led her to the gowns. 
</P>
<P>
	``How about this green one? Or this red one?'' they said  
excitedly. 
</P>
<P>
	A few hours and many gowns later, she dropped a sequined,  
steel-colored fabric over her head. 
</P>
<P>
	Mouths fell open. ``That's it!'' they cried.  
</P>
<P>
	Miss McCormick, weary after days of helping clean up her  
family's wrecked home, beamed as she was led down the hall to a 
seamstress for quick alterations. The girls also helped her pick 
out shoes and jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is fun -- and no cleaning,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Darnett Edwards, who has been living with her grandmother since  
the storm destroyed her apartment, settled on a slim black gown 
with a velvet top. ``This takes your mind off things,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The girls left with their gowns in plastic bags, got on a yellow  
school bus and headed toward what was left of home.

<HEADLINE> Fired CNN Producter Sues Network </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A former CNN producer sued the network Friday,  
claiming she was wrongfully terminated over a story alleging that 
U.S. forces used nerve gas to hunt down American defectors during 
the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
	April Oliver charges in her lawsuit filed in District of  
Columbia Superior Court that CNN decided to fire her last year 
``primarily on business and public relations concerns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A CNN spokeswoman said the network does not comment on ``matters  
pertaining to litigation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit is based on a report that aired June 7, 1998. The  
piece accused the military of using sarin gas in Laos during 
Operation Tailwind. Two U.S. defectors were supposedly killed in 
the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	CNN retracted the story about a month after the broadcast. It  
also fired two producers, including Oliver. A third producer 
resigned. Peter Arnett, the story's lead reporter, was reprimanded 
and ultimately left the network because of the piece. 
</P>
<P>
	Oliver's lawsuit claims that senior management at CNN and Time,  
which published an article based on the piece, knew the Tailwind 
report was ``inherently volatile and would be particularly 
controversial and sensitive in the military community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Consequently, senior management for CNN and Time thoroughly  
reviewed and approved the sourcing and substance of the Tailwind 
report prior to broadcast and publication,'' the lawsuit says. 
</P>
<P>
	Numerous senior managers also made significant changes to the  
script. Washington bureau chief Frank Sesno even requested ``the 
insertion of a chemical weapons expert to explain the differences 
between nerve gas and tear gas, and an increased emphasis on the 
length, depth and breadth of the investigation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Oliver is seeking unspecified damages in her lawsuit but said  
money was not her motive. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a useful opportunity for me to put facts on the table  
that have been buried -- which CNN intentionally tried to bury,'' 
Oliver said in an interview. ``There are issues of honor at play 
here and there are issues of fact seeking and truth finding. I want 
the public record restored on this so I'm not buried under a sea of 
character assassination and a sea of disinformation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Oliver also filed a counter-lawsuit Friday against retired Army  
Gen. John Singlaub, naming him as her source for the Tailwind 
report. Singlaub was among a group of veterans who sued CNN and 
Time Magazine, claiming their reports defamed them. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an act of defense,'' Oliver said. ``He sued me for a  
story he confirmed. He was offered the script to read although he 
declined. ...I think that people should understand that he 
confirmed the central ideas of the Tailwind broadcast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Oliver's suit against Singlaub details her notes, recordings and  
e-mail exchanges with Singlaub over the course of a year. Attorneys 
for Singlaub could not be reached immediately for comment.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Unveils Saddam City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- Iraq has added a new city to its map -- a  
lakeside vacation resort where nearly every brick is engraved with 
President Saddam Hussein's initials and a 30-foot bronze statue of 
him greets visitors at the gateway. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprawled along the al-Tharthar lake, the Saddamiat al-Tharthar  
city was built over the last 11 months with little publicity. It 
officially opened Thursday when Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan 
handed Saddam the city's key, in the shape of a 1 1/2-foot-long sword 
made of solid gold. 
</P>
<P>
	Most Iraqis came to know about the existence of the city, 85  
miles west of Baghdad, only when the ceremony for the key's 
handover was broadcast on state television Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The city contains stadiums, an amusement park, hospitals, parks,  
a restaurant with a view of the lake and 625 homes including 
bungalows on a lakeside promenade. Most of the bricks in the 
buildings are stamped with Saddam's initials in Arabic, and statues 
of the president are strategically placed at intersections. 
</P>
<P>
	The apparent secrecy around the construction was probably to  
avoid attracting international criticism over extravagant 
government spending at a time when the country's economy is in 
shambles, largely due to the U.N. economic sanctions since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Before handing the key over to Saddam, the vice president said:  
``The achievement of such a project in such critical time reflects 
the Iraqi people's determination to face the unwarranted 
aggression.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials refused to say how much it cost to be build the city.  
</P>
<P>
	It was also not clear if the resort city would be a commercial  
venture or if visits would be subsidized to provide perks for 
government employees. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, dozens of curious Iraqis drove along a desert highway  
to see the city. 
</P>
<P>
	The first impression was striking.  
</P>
<P>
	From a mile away one could see the towering statue of Saddam  
atop a three-story high white stone arch, the gateway to the city. 
Saddam, in military uniform, is posed with a raised right arm, as 
if welcoming visitors. 
</P>
<P>
	The inescapable shadow of Saddam is nothing new to Iraqis --  
thousands of Saddam statues and larger-than-life posters dominate 
streets and public buildings of every Iraqi city, town and village. 
Most hospitals and stadiums are named for him. The ruins of 
Babylon, dating back to 500 B.C., have been reconstructed with 
modern bricks bearing his name. 
</P>
<P>
	People visiting the city Friday refused to comment on whether it  
should have been built, apparently out of fear of retribution. 
</P>
<P>
	The lake along which the city is built is artificial, dug out  
during the days of Iraqi prosperity before sanctions were imposed 
to punish Iraq for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
	The lake contains water drawn from the mountains of northern  
Iraq to irrigate land that could not be fed by the Euphrates River. 
</P>
<P>
	One landmark in the city is the al-Majeed Grand mosque, large  
enough to accommodate 800 people. It is named for Saddam's family.

<HEADLINE> Neighborhood Hit Twice by Tornadoes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOORE, Okla. (AP) -- Doug and Dee Powers had barely finished  
repairing their home from the tornado that struck last October when 
this week arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	After another twister roared through the neighborhood, the  
Powerses fear their house may be a total loss this time. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like lightning never strikes twice. You never think it  
will happen, but it did,'' said Mrs. Powers, who grew up in the 
house. 
</P>
<P>
	Harold Brooks, a researcher at the National Severe Storms  
Laboratory in Norman, said the chances of a tornado hitting a given 
location even just once are small. 
</P>
<P>
	``The kind of wind speeds we're looking at from Monday will  
probably occur at that location maybe once in a million years,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The tornado in October did about $3,000 in damage to the Powers  
home. This time, the couple were just two houses away from a direct 
hit. One wall was stripped away and there was other structural 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the couple were on the front lawn, along with the  
belongings they have salvaged, waiting for an insurance adjuster. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now we're back past square one. We're further back than we  
were last time,'' Mrs. Powers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Kelleher, a National Weather Service meteorologist, said:  
``Is this an area that's conducive to tornado paths? I don't think 
so. It's just bad luck.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rod and Sherry McLaren own five rental houses in Moore, two of  
which had a combined $5,000 damage in October. They put a new roof 
and new siding on one, and spruced up another with a new fence. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, those two houses were leveled and the others suffered  
damage so heavy they may be total losses, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes you want to cry,'' Mrs. McLaren said.

<HEADLINE> Panel Says Weigh Soldiers' Health </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With the threat of global nuclear war replaced  
by local peacekeeping operations, military commanders are being 
urged to consider their troops long-term health, not just the 
immediate danger, when making battle decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the bullets and bombs that pose the traditional  
battlefield threat, radiation, chemical and biological weapons can 
affect soldiers far into the future. 
</P>
<P>
	Weighing such long-range hazards should become part of  
commanders' standard operating procedure, says a report from the 
Institute of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to do, it's very hard to do,'' admitted Dr. Fred A.  
Mettler Jr. of the University of New Mexico, chairman of the panel 
that wrote the report which was issued Thursday. ``Just because 
it's difficult doesn't mean they shouldn't try to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``As one goes toward peacekeeping type missions where you're not  
expecting a lot of fatalities, and things are not as urgent to get 
done, you really should be thinking about long-term effects,'' said 
Mettler, chairman of the Department of Radiology at the 
university's School of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	Lt. Col. Carl Curling of the Army Surgeon General's office said  
commanders began looking at long-term health considerations in the 
wake of the Persian Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
	``We really began to be concerned about this as far back as  
1992,'' Curling said, when troops were sent into Bosnia on 
peacekeeping duty. 
</P>
<P>
	Curling said Army officials were still reviewing the report, but  
the initial reaction was positive: ``I haven't seen a tremendous 
problem in any of the recommendations they provided.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The institute was asked to study the threat of radiation  
exposure on soldiers, but didn't limit the recommendation to that 
threat. 
</P>
<P>
	``The long-term effects to be considered in operational  
decisions should include not only those from radiation but also 
those from conventional injuries, chemical and biological agents, 
and psychological stress,'' said the committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Traditional risk evaluation in planning military action focuses  
on acute injuries that could affect the ability to accomplish a 
mission, while long-term consequences have been left to the 
Department of Veterans Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Institute of Medicine is an arm of the National Academy of  
Sciences, an independent organization which provides scientific 
advice to the government. 
</P>
<P>
	In this case, the Army requested a study of the effects on  
soldiers of radiation doses of 700 milliSieverts. That amount would 
not have any immediate impact on an individual but poses an 
increased risk of leukemia and other cancers in future. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, the committee urged the Army to develop a philosophy of  
radiation protection including making sure that in peacetime or 
non-emergency situations soldiers receive the same level of 
protection as civilian radiation workers.

<HEADLINE> Show Held Liable in Guest's Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- A jury ordered ``The Jenny Jones Show'' to  
pay $25 million Friday to the family of a gay man who was shot to 
death after revealing a crush on a fellow guest. 
</P>
<P>
	In a case that put daytime TV's taste for lurid confessions and  
confrontations on trial, the jury agreed with claims that the show 
``did everything but pull the trigger'' in the slaying of Scott 
Amedure. 
</P>
<P>
	Amedure was killed by Jonathan Schmitz in 1995 three days after  
the two took part in a ``Jenny Jones'' taping at which Amedure 
regaled the studio audience with his sexual fantasies about 
Schmitz, who said he is heterosexual. The segment never aired. 
</P>
<P>
	Amedure's family accused the show's producers and owners of  
negligence in putting a mentally troubled Schmitz on the show and 
humiliating him. 
</P>
<P>
	``That type of human exploitation needs to be corralled,'' said  
Amedure family attorney Geoffrey Fieger, who had asked for $71.5 
million in damages. ```The Jenny Jones Show' and what it does to 
people is unsafe at any speed. This is a renegade business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for Warner Bros., which owns the show, compared its  
tactics to surprise birthday parties and journalists who ambush 
people with unexpected questions. They warned that the verdict will 
have a chilling effect on all media and said they will appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``The plaintiffs' theory is that you have do a psychological  
profile before you allow them to come onto a program,'' said 
attorney Zazi Pope. ``And then you cannot engage in any discussion 
of any topic that has any element of surprise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 12-member jury deliberated for seven hours over two days,  
awarding the family $5 million for Amedure's suffering, $10 million 
for the loss of his companionship, and $10 million for the loss of 
his future earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	The show's owners claimed that Schmitz knew his secret admirer  
could be a man and that he was not upset by the surprise. They also 
suggested Schmitz killed Amedure for other reasons -- including a 
secret sexual encounter after the taping. 
</P>
<P>
	Fieger denied that Schmitz and Amedure had sex and told the jury  
that the show ``did everything but pull the trigger'' in setting up 
the surprise. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Jones, who was not sued but testified at the trial, denied  
on the stand that her show ambushes guests to boost ratings. She 
had no immediate comment on the verdict. Schmitz also took the 
stand at the trial but invoked his Fifth Amendment right against 
self-incrimination. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Paratore, the president of Telepictures Productions -- the  
show's producers -- said he was ``stunned'' by the verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Jones said in a statement that she was ``shocked and  
saddened by this verdict. However, the only real tragedy is that 
Scott Amedure lost his life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Amedure's father, Frank, said he hopes the verdict sends a  
message to other talk shows. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just proud that we can show people that shows are not  
going to do this no more,'' he said. ``Please, don't let the kids 
watch all these shows, because there'll be more killings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Amedure, 32, went on the ``Jenny Jones'' segment titled  
``Same-Sex Secret Crushes'' to talk about his feelings for Schmitz, 
an acquaintance. As the audience whooped with delight, Ms. Jones 
elicited Amedure's whipped cream-and-strawberries fantasy involving 
Schmitz. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmitz reacted with an embarassed smile but no apparent anger.  
He turned away when Amedure put an arm around him and tried to kiss 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm definitely a heterosexual, I guess you could say,''  
Schmitz said. 
</P>
<P>
	Three days later, Schmitz bought a shotgun, drove to Amedure's  
trailer home in the Detroit suburbs and shot him twice in the 
chest. Schmitz then called police and confessed. 
</P>
<P>
	At Schmitz's criminal trial in 1996, his lawyers blamed the  
killing on the ``Jenny Jones'' humiliation and his history of 
depression and a thyroid ailment, but he was found guilty of 
murder. The conviction was thrown out on appeal, and a retrial is 
scheduled for this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Thompson, director of the Center for the Study of Popular  
Television at Syracuse University, said Friday's verdict is 
troubling because it means traditional news organizations might be 
held liable if critical reviews or stories have tragic results. 
</P>
<P>
	``Verdicts like this potentially could set all kinds of  
precedents that could impact what we consider good journalism,'' 
Thompson said. ``If you take that to its logical conclusion, we 
could be reduced to silence. In this sort of steady circling of the 
sharks around the First Amendment, this has been a big bite.''

<HEADLINE> Ways To Avoid Baby Snatching Taught </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An oversight commission that investigates  
hospitals when things go wrong wants to help them avoid baby 
snatchings. 
</P>
<P>
	The Joint Commission on Accreditation of Health Care  
Organizations, which gives its seal of approval to hospitals, is 
best known for coming in after a disaster or tragedy. The baby 
snatching guidelines are the group's latest attempt to prevent 
problems from happening in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
	In a special alert being sent to nearly 5,100 hospitals this  
week, the commission recommends an end to birth announcements in 
newspapers, better ID badges and color photos of newborns. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any time we're able to spot a trend or a pattern, we want to  
alert the health care community so we can prevent tragedies,'' said 
Janet McIntyre, a commission spokeswoman. ``Something like an 
infant abduction is always a high-profile case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The commission began issuing these special alerts in February  
1998, and has sent only a few. It bases its recommendations on 
investigations hospitals are required to conduct. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Hospital Association welcomed the recommendations.  
</P>
<P>
	``When these things happen, you try to figure out what happened  
and try to prevent this from happening again. You have to find a 
way to learn,'' said spokesman Rick Wade. ``That's the way it's 
supposed to work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In reviewing eight recent abductions, the commission found that  
all of them involved female abductors in hospitals with unmonitored 
access to elevators or stairwells near the postpartum or nursery 
areas. They all occurred in midsize or large hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission recommended:  
</P>
<P>
	--Educating the staff on how to spot potential abductors and what  
to do if there is a snatching. 
</P>
<P>
	--Increasing parent education about abduction risks.  
</P>
<P>
	--Attaching bands to baby, mother and father or significant other  
immediately after birth. 
</P>
<P>
	--Footprinting babies, taking color photos and recording babies'  
physical exams within two hours of birth. 
</P>
<P>
	--Requiring staff to wear up-to-date and conspicuous ID badges  
with color photos. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of abductions has dropped in recent years. There were  
104 from 1983 through early this year -- an average of 15 per year -- 
with 98 babies found and six still missing, according to the 
National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. But in 1996, 
1997 and 1998, there were only 13 total abductions. 
</P>
<P>
	More than half were taken from the mother's room. Of the rest,  
about 15 percent each were taken from the nursery, the pediatrics 
department and from unspecified places on the premises.

<HEADLINE> Fiat May Grow in Non-Auto Sectors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME (AP) -- Italy's giant automaker Fiat might turn to more  
activities outside the car sector to expand faster, the company's 
chairman said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Paolo Fresco made his remarks during the presentation in Rome of  
a book marking the 100th anniversary of the Turin-based company, 
which falls on July 11. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we are effective in meeting all the opportunities, we will  
probably end up having faster growth in non-auto areas,'' Fresco 
said, without elaborating. 
</P>
<P>
	He also dismissed market rumors that Fiat, owned by the Agnelli  
family, was in talks to link up with the Ford Motor Co. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, Fiat saw its core auto business plunging both in Italy  
and other markets, including the huge Brazilian market. It sold a 
total of 2.4 million between cars and small trucks, down 9.2 
percent from 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Fresco said earlier this year he didn't expect 1999 to be any  
more favorable.

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Are Mixed / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures prices were mixed early  
today in lackluster trading on the Chicago Board of Trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans moved mostly lower, pressured by forecasts for drier  
Midwestern weather over the next few days that is likely to aid 
planting. Corn futures moved fractionally higher amid a lack of 
news that would provide direction. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat was pressured by expectations of a bumper winter wheat  
harvest. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for July delivery fell 1 cent to $2.61 1/4 a bushel; July  
corn fell 1/2 cent to $2.19 1/4 a bushel; July oats rose 1/2 cent to $1.20 
a bushel; July soybeans fell 3 cents to $4.80 1/2 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Meat and livestock futures were mostly higher on the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	June live cattle rose .30 cent to 61.70 cents a pound; August  
feeder cattle rose .15 cent to 72.30 cents a pound; June lean hogs 
rose .93 cent to 59.85 cents a pound; July pork bellies rose .55

<HEADLINE> Jury Awards Woman $2.6M Vs. PepsiCo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST BLOOMFIELD TOWNSHIP, Mich. (AP) -- A federal court jury has  
awarded $2.6 million to a white woman who said PepsiCo Inc. passed 
her over for a management promotion for a less-qualified black man. 
</P>
<P>
	Patricia Steffes, 46, later quit the company after failing to  
land the promotion in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	After a four-week trial before U.S. District Judge Nancy Edmunds  
in Detroit, jurors yesterday found in Mrs. Steffes' favor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel vindicated,'' she told The Detroit News for a story  
Friday. ``The jury saw that Pepsi had broken the law. It wasn't 
about black and white, it was about race discrimination in the 
workplace. I'm glad I stood up for what was right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Jabbonsky, a spokesman for Purchase, N.Y.-based PepsiCo,  
said it would appeal. ``We continue to believe Mrs. Steffes' 
allegations have no merit,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The resident of this Detroit suburb, about 25 miles northwest of  
Detroit in Oakland County, worked her way up from payroll clerk to 
a $73,000-a-year management position, when she applied for the 
higher post in Lansing. The job went to a less-qualified black man, 
she claimed. 
</P>
<P>
	She wrote to the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission  
and a Pepsi executive, complaining of discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
	She said her superiors began retaliating.  
</P>
<P>
	``They became very critical of her performance,'' said her  
lawyer, David Szymanski. ``They tried to transfer her to another 
part of the state.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jabbonsky said Mrs. Steffes was a good worker, but not qualified  
for the Lansing job because she lacked sales and ``front-line 
management'' experience.

<HEADLINE> Don't Blink, It's NBA Playoff Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	For the third straight year, the New York Knicks and Miami Heat  
are facing each other in a first-round series. Neither side wants a 
repeat of the first two meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first two series, I guess it was a boxing match -- a rumble  
in the jungle, or whatever it was,'' Knicks guard Chris Childs 
said. ``It's hard to play a basketball game when you've got bodies 
on bodies without getting into a skirmish, but I think cooler heads 
will prevail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago, four Knicks were suspended for leaving the bench  
to join in a scuffle. Miami won that series in seven games. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Miami's Alonzo Mourning and New York's Larry Johnson  
were suspended for fighting. New York prevailed in five. 
</P>
<P>
	``Guys should have learned their lessons and how suspensions  
hurt their seasons,'' Miami forward P.J. Brown said. ``I'd be very 
surprised if there was any of that stupid stuff going on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also beginning today are Detroit-Atlanta, Sacramento-Utah and  
Phoenix-Portland. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's games are Philadelphia-Orlando, Minnesota-San Antonio,  
Houston-Los Angeles Lakers and Milwaukee-Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't be surprised if there was a physical confrontation  
-- pushing and shoving,'' Miami coach Pat Riley said. ``But I'd be 
surprised if it went beyond that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The teams are almost mirror images, even though Riley left New  
York four years ago. Riley protege Jeff Van Gundy kept the system 
when he became Knicks coach, and the similarities only lend 
intensity to the rivalry. 
</P>
<P>
	New York's Patrick Ewing appeared ready to go, although his sore  
left Achilles' tendon will be a question throughout the series. The 
7-footer took part in Friday's one-hour practice before the Knicks 
left for South Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	``For what he did, he looked all right,'' Van Gundy said.  
</P>
<P>
	Detroit has barely had time to catch its breath before the  
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	After playing an overtime game Wednesday night at Philadelphia  
and returning to Detroit in the wee hours Thursday, the Pistons 
turned right around and practiced Friday morning before traveling 
to Atlanta for Game 1 of a best-of-5 series against the Hawks. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's where the homecourt (advantage) really helps out these  
teams early is that it's a travel day that they don't have to throw 
in,'' NBC analyst Doug Collins said. ``And I think that's vital. 
When you don't have the preparation time, it really limits how much 
you can get involved with your team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Don't expect a high-scoring Pistons-Hawks series. The Hawks  
allowed only 83.4 points per game -- lowest in the league -- while 
the Pistons also ranked among the defensive leaders at 86.9. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're a good defensive team,'' coach Lenny Wilkens said.  
``Offensively, we've got to move the ball. We don't have a 
superstar like Shaq (Shaquille O'Neal) that we can throw it to. Our 
shot selection has to be good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the Kings-Jazz series, the most intriguing matchup is at  
point guard with flashy rookie Jason Williams going against Utah 
stalwart John Stockton. 
</P>
<P>
	Stockton is the key to Utah's businesslike approach, while  
Sacramento's high-flying offensive show revolves around Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	``You play the game a different way if you came up when John and  
I did,'' Karl Malone said. ``We grew up with strong coaches and 
different players to look up to than the guys do now. It's a very 
different time, and you can see that when John plays some of the 
younger kids.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for Phoenix-Portland, the teams have been fixtures in the  
playoffs throughout this decade, the Blazers making the postseason 
17 straight times and Phoenix 11. The last time they met, the Suns 
won 3-0 in a 1995 first-round series. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blazers have lost in the first round of the playoffs the  
last six years, but they didn't have homecourt advantage in any of 
those series. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now it's a sense of urgency,'' Portland guard Isaiah Rider  
said. ``It's a sense of, we want to win, rather than we're happy to 
be here. Now we realize that we're favored to win. We're supposed 
to win. So it's time to take care of business.''

<HEADLINE> House Approves $13.1 Billion for Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican congressional leaders hope to ship  
legislation to President Clinton next week financing the clash with 
Yugoslavia and shoring up the U.S. military around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	The House moved in that direction Thursday, approving a $13.1  
billion package by a resounding 311-105 vote. Republicans supported 
the bill by more than 4-to-1 and Democrats backed it by more than 
2-to-1, as both parties signaled support for U.S. troops in week 
six of the air campaign against Serb forces. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was the strongest expression of support we can give them  
with this bill today,'' said House Appropriations Committee 
Chairman Bill Young, R-Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate has not produced its own measure, but GOP leaders  
there want to keep the package close to the $6 billion Clinton 
proposed last month. Most of the funds would come from this year's 
projected Social Security surplus, and Senate Republicans are 
squeamish because they have repeatedly pledged not to touch that 
money. 
</P>
<P>
	Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon expressed thanks for the House  
vote. But he added, ``Our biggest fear was that this would get held 
up somehow, and frankly that's still a concern'' because the Senate 
has not acted. 
</P>
<P>
	Underlining the difficulty of opposing defense spending while  
U.S. troops are in combat, the White House budget office did not 
threaten a presidential veto of the House bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead it urged lawmakers ``to avoid confrontation'' by cutting  
the bill and adding aid for U.S. farmers and Central America. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans hope to work out a compromise and attach the  
military spending measure to another bill sought by Clinton but 
slowed in Congress. It bears aid for Central American nations 
battered by last fall's Hurricane Mitch and for U.S. farmers hurt 
by plummeting commodities prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents of the House measure included liberals unhappy that  
Clinton's request for the Pentagon had been doubled, and 
conservatives who oppose a conflict they say the president forced 
without congressional consultation. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Donald Manzullo, R-Ill., said supporting the troops means  
more than just supplying them with weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	``It means giving them the constitutional protection not to be  
put into the war'' without Congress' consent, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	An effort led by Rep. Ernest Istook, R-Okla., to bar a ground  
war without lawmakers' approval was defeated 301-117. 
</P>
<P>
	The House voted 249-180 last week for nearly identical language  
requiring congressional approval for a ground campaign, a symbolic 
measure lawmakers knew Clinton would veto. With Democrats warning 
of a veto of the entire spending bill if Istook's language was 
attached, Istook's proposal was defeated. 
</P>
<P>
	A Democratic attempt to shrink the spending measure lost  
260-164. It would have left the bill at $11.6 billion -- including 
$1.3 billion for Central America and U.S. farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	In another vote eight days ago, the House refused to support the  
U.S.-led NATO air campaign, with Republicans supplying most of the 
opposition. Democrats contrasted that with Thursday's passage of 
twice the $6 billion Clinton wanted to wage the air war through 
September and care for hundreds of thousands of refugees who have 
fled Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have frankly got whiplash from watching the majority party  
reverse its position,'' said Rep. David Obey of Wisconsin, top 
Democrat on the Appropriations panel. 
</P>
<P>
	The House's additions include $1.1 billion to buy missiles and  
bombs, $1.3 billion for spare parts, $1.8 billion to improve 
troops' pay and pensions, and $1.1 billion to modernize military 
bases, mostly in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Republicans used Thursday's debate to try pinning the need  
for the extra money on Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``The White House has bombed its way around the globe while  
dropping troops far and wide for ill-defined peacemaking duties,'' 
said House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas. ``This policy has 
gutted the American military -- which now must be rebuilt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By voice vote, lawmakers approved language by Rep. Tom Latham,  
R-Iowa, adding nearly $110 million in assistance to American 
farmers. A provision by Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., adding $67 
million in refugee aid was also added by voice vote.

<HEADLINE> Sean Connery Roles Up His Sleeves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ``Entrapment'' star Sean Connery doubled as a  
tightfisted producer to bring the action movie in under budget. 
</P>
<P>
	About $68 million was budgeted for the movie, which involved  
complicated stunts, exotic locations (Malaysia, Scotland, London 
and New York) and a disruptive change of directors (Antoine Fuqua 
left, Jon Amiel came on board). 
</P>
<P>
	It came in $2 million under budget, which is almost unheard of  
in Hollywood. And much of the credit goes to Connery, who set the 
tone by shunning such usual star perks as private aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the old-fashioned stuff that works -- like preparation,''  
Connery said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Getting the script as right as we can, never wasting money and  
rehearsing on Saturdays'' are necessary, he said. ``There's nothing 
worse than getting on a set and there's nothing happening.''

<HEADLINE> Doctor Testifies in Lewis Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Boston Celtics captain Reggie Lewis went into  
cardiac arrest twice during stress tests given by Dr. Gilbert 
Mudge, a cardiologist testified Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Roman DeSanctis, of Massachusetts General Hospital, spoke  
during the medical malpractice trial stemming from Lewis' sudden 
death at 27 after shooting baskets. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis underwent tests after collapsing during a 1993 playoff  
game. As part of a second team of doctors who examined Lewis, Mudge 
administered a stress test that DeSanctis reviewed. 
</P>
<P>
	During the most strenuous part of the test, Lewis' heart had to  
be shocked twice to restart it, DeSanctis testified. 
</P>
<P>
	Mudge would later diagnose Lewis as having a benign fainting  
disorder. DeSanctis said he strongly disagreed, and believed Lewis 
risked sudden death. 
</P>
<P>
	The player's wife, Donna Harris-Lewis, is suing Mudge and two  
doctors who consulted on the case, Mark Creager and Peter Friedman, 
claiming they misdiagnosed and mistreated Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris-Lewis and her husband had turned to Mudge for a second  
opinion after a team of physicians said his career and possibly his 
life were in jeopardy because of a potentially fatal cardiac 
arrhythmia. 
</P>
<P>
	The so-called ``Dream Team'' of New England Baptist Hospital  
doctors were assembled after Lewis collapsed on court during a 
playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
	Mudge's lawyer has said the cardiologist couldn't treat Lewis  
properly because the player didn't tell him he used cocaine until 
two weeks before he died. Lewis collapsed while shooting baskets at 
Brandeis University on July 27, 1993 and died that same day. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris-Lewis also took the stand Friday, for the second straight  
day. She broke down several times while recounting how her husband 
died. 
</P>
<P>
	She drove to the hospital thinking he had just fainted, and when  
she saw him in his hospital room she thought he was just 
unconscious. 
</P>
<P>
	``Then a woman doctor came in and said, 'I don't think Reggie's  
going to make it'.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I went into the room to say goodbye,'' she said. ``And I had  
this feeling that came over me. I said, `I know it is just a 
feeling of serenity. And I said I know you're in heaven, Reggie, 
because you're too good to go to hell.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Sobbing, she said she then kissed him goodbye.

<HEADLINE> Dying Doctor Finds Own Replacement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLQUITT, Ga. (AP) -- Dr. Peggy Rummel learned in January that  
liver cancer would likely kill her in eight weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Wracked with pain, dopey from morphine, she spent the winter  
making things for her family to remember her by. For her extended 
family -- this one-stoplight town in southwestern Georgia peanut 
country -- she searched by phone and Internet to make sure another 
doctor would be in place when she was gone. 
</P>
<P>
	As if by sheer willpower, the 43-year-old redhead with the  
mischievous smile outlived her prognosis long enough to see her 
wish fulfilled. Rummel died at 6:45 a.m. today with her husband, 
Larry, at her side. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the intimate time we spent together, just the two of us, I  
really started crying,'' Larry Rummel said today. ``And she almost 
got scoldful, to tell me `You hang in there' and `We're going to 
make it' and `Things are going to be fine.''' 
</P>
<P>
	A weary Peggy Rummel spent parts of Monday and Tuesday with an  
Associated Press reporter, talking about her efforts to make sure 
Colquitt would get another doctor. 
</P>
<P>
	``What scared me was the short deadline, pardon the pun. We  
needed the coverage then; we didn't need to wait for me to get over 
feeling sorry for myself,'' she said, her tired blue eyes filling 
with tears. ``The idea that, 'Oops, sorry. Nobody's here,' is just 
not acceptable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just as unacceptable as allowing a boy to miss a visit to a  
specialist because his mother has no car or travel money, as 
unacceptable as letting local children go without an Easter egg 
hunt. Or sending her 18-year-old son, Richard, into adulthood 
without her videotaped letter of advice -- ``In case you get 
married; in case you have children; in case you decide you DON'T 
want to go into medicine ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rummel grew up a state away, in North Augusta, S.C., and knew  
while still at the Medical University of South Carolina that she 
wanted to practice rural medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	When she met the representatives from Miller County (pop. 6,400)  
at a job fair, she knew Colquitt -- with a grain elevator for a 
skyline and an honest-to-goodness hardware store on the courthouse 
square -- was the place for her. 
</P>
<P>
	``She said Miller County was the only group that asked about her  
family,'' said Head Start director Susan Long, whose son, Ashley, 
was the first baby Rummel delivered in Colquitt. 
</P>
<P>
	Over 16 years, she earned the right to call herself a native.  
</P>
<P>
	``She's just meant such a lot,'' said Rita Glass, director of  
lab and X-ray services at Miller County Hospital, who had known 
Rummel since 1983. ``She's done a lot of things for the community 
that they never knew about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When lack of business threatened to close the 38-bed hospital,  
Rummel referred more of her patients, eventually accounting for 
more than half the total business. She worked the emergency room 
two days a week and two or three weekends a month. Along the way, 
she helped raise eight foster children. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Rummel said he knew early on he would have to share his  
wife with others. He was full of admiration. ``I don't mind saying 
she's been the brains and the strongest one in this outfit,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	She maintained her pace even through a series of serious  
illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Ulcerative colitis forced her to have a colectomy and ileostomy  
14 years ago. Later, her gallbladder was removed. She suffered from 
brittle diabetes and autoimmune dysfunction and had a bout with 
Grave's disease. She had to give up tending the 500 rose bushes 
that flanked her office after a garden fungus produced an abscess 
in her head. 
</P>
<P>
	She bore it all with the same sense of humor that got her  
through residency -- shortsheeting dorm beds and wrapping a 
colleague's car in 21 rolls of aluminum foil. 
</P>
<P>
	A plaque on her kitchen wall said, ``Thou shalt not whine,'' and  
her ability to withstand pain and ``minor-league bleeding'' let her 
minimize a diagnosis of liver lesions 10 years ago. But the cancer 
was something she couldn't work off or joke away. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wasn't able to find a magic key to get around this one,''  
Rummel said in the interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Just one day home from the hospital, she began making calls,  
trying to find a new doctor for Colquitt. After a friend helped put 
a letter on the Internet, calls came from all over. But a stroke of 
fate allowed her to live to see her wish fulfilled. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Ifekan-Shango Simon was looking to stay in Georgia after his  
residency in Columbus. A native of St. Thomas in the U.S. Virgin 
Islands, he had approached Colquitt last October, but the town 
didn't need him then. 
</P>
<P>
	By February, Simon and his wife had decided to accept an offer  
in Alabama when he found Miller County's message on his answering 
machine. Colquitt not only needed him but was offering everything 
he wanted -- a family practice with a chance to deliver babies and 
do minor surgeries. He signed commitment papers last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Everyone acknowledged Simon has big shoes to fill.  
</P>
<P>
	Long, the Head Start director, said Rummel often used her lunch  
break to screen the center's 40 children. Her eyes teared as she 
recalled how Rummel lay beside her in her hospital bed through 
eight hours of labor with her second child, Courtney, now 13. 
</P>
<P>
	``You won't find many doctors who'll do that,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	A pink flush rose in Rummel's jaundiced cheeks when she heard  
such talk. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just not that big a deal,'' she said. ``I think the town  
.... just needs to be groomed and protected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, someone else will have to do the protecting. She had always  
planned to grow old in Colquitt -- and to keep contributing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I dread disability more than death,'' she said, wiping a tear  
from her nose. ``I can't think of anything worse than to be 
useless.''

<HEADLINE> Senate Passes Banking Overhaul Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sweeping legislation that would let banks,  
securities firms and insurance companies meld to create big 
financial ``supermarkets'' has pushed through the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	The mostly party-line vote Thursday evening was 54-44, though  
the bill faces a likely presidential veto if Congress sends it to 
President Clinton without changes. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would lift Depression-era legal barriers separating the  
three industries, allowing the new companies to sell consumers 
everything from checking accounts to car insurance to mutual funds. 
</P>
<P>
	It includes a provision that would make it a federal crime for  
anyone to misrepresent himself to obtain someone's private 
financial data. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration supports the legislation in  
principle. But in a showdown with Senate Banking Committee Chairman 
Phil Gramm, R-Texas, it has threatened a presidential veto of the 
bill unless there are major changes, including the removal of 
provisions that Democrats view as an attack on the 1977 Community 
Reinvestment Act. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think in the end, the president's going to have to decide,  
is he for a financial modernization bill,'' Gramm told reporters 
during the evening vote, which followed 2 1/2 days of debate. 
</P>
<P>
	Gramm said he believed it was possible to work out a compromise  
on the issues in contention. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., called it ``exactly the wrong bill at  
exactly the wrong time. ... This is moving this country in the 
wrong direction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Removing the barriers separating banks, brokerage firms and  
insurers would increase the likelihood of future taxpayer bailouts 
of big institutions that fail, Dorgan warned. 
</P>
<P>
	``This orgy of big bank mergers in our country moves now at an  
accelerated pace, unabated,'' he said. He cited recent 
consolidations including those in which banking giant Citicorp 
merged with brokerage-insurer Travelers Group in a deal valued at 
$36.9 billion, NationsBank Corp. and BankAmerica Corp. combined in 
a $41.5 billion marriage and Banc One Corp. and First Chicago NBD 
Corp. united in an $18.7 billion deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Proponents of the financial overhaul legislation, led by Wall  
Street and the insurance industry, maintain it is needed to keep 
the U.S. financial industry competitive in global markets and that 
it would save consumers millions by providing one-stop financial 
shopping. The financial industries have spent millions lobbying for 
the legislation in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	A financial overhaul bill more acceptable to the administration  
recently cleared the House Banking Committee and is being reviewed 
by the House Commerce Committee, which has given it a lukewarm 
reception. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Marge Roukema, R-N.J., a senior Banking Committee member,  
predicted today that the Commerce panel likely will reshape the 
House bill to make it closer to the newly passed Senate version. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is so important for the Congress to do this year,''  
Roukema said in a telephone interview. ``It is somewhat distressful 
to me that the administration keeps threatening vetoes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The chances of a presidential veto also were increased Thursday  
when the Senate rebuffed an effort by Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., 
and Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., to steer the 
legislation toward the view of the administration. 
</P>
<P>
	They sponsored an amendment that brought to the Senate floor a  
long-simmering debate between the administration and Fed Chairman 
Alan Greenspan, whose view is supported by most Republicans, over 
the best bank corporate structure to allow in revamping the 
financial services laws. It was killed on a 53-46 vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and the administration want to  
let banks get into new kinds of financial activities through 
subsidiaries of the banks themselves, not just through affiliated 
companies within the same parent holding company. That arrangement 
would increase the power of the Treasury's Office of the 
Comptroller of the Currency, regulator of nationally chartered 
banks. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan and most GOP lawmakers, on the other hand, want to let  
banks diversify through a holding company structure. That would 
expand the independent Federal Reserve's role as a regulator. 
</P>
<P>
	The privacy amendment takes aim at the practice of pretext  
calling, in which people call employees at banks and other 
businesses and use easily available data, such as Social Security 
numbers, to get information about bank accounts and other financial 
data. 
</P>
<P>
	It doesn't go as far as many privacy advocates would like,  
however. 
</P>
<P>
	Edmund Mierzwinski, consumer program director for the U.S.  
Public Interest Research Group, called it ``a scam and a sham'' and 
a ``substitute for true privacy reform.'' Among other things, he 
said, the lawmakers should have addressed the issue of affiliated 
financial companies sharing their customers' data with each other. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, Clinton urged Congress to bolster consumers'  
rights when banks and other financial companies seek to share or 
sell information about them. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's proposals include requiring banks and other financial  
institutions to tell consumers when they plan to share or sell 
personal financial information, and giving consumers the power to 
stop such transfers. He also wants to restrict any sharing of 
customers' medical information by affiliated companies within a 
financial conglomerate.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Rises Against Yen, Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar rose against the yen and the euro  
Friday amid waning expectations for a quick peace settlement in 
Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at $1.0748, down  
from $1.0802 late Thursday. The dollar also was quoted at 120.85 
Japanese yen, up from 120.50 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro fell back against the dollar as traders grew less  
hopeful for a rapid end to the fighting in Kosovo, which as a 
threat to the European economy has weighed heavily on the euro. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro, which has struggled since its debut at the beginning  
of the year, had rallied against the dollar on Thursday as Russia 
agreed to a Western proposal for seeking an end to the fighting. 
</P>
<P>
	In other trading Friday, the dollar was quoted at 1.4965 Swiss  
francs, up from 1.4870; and 1.4575 Canadian dollars, up from 
1.4552. 
</P>
<P>
	The British pound fell to $1.6308 from $1.6415.  
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on Friday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8198 German  
marks, up from 1.8106; 6.1013 French francs, up from 6.0716; and 
1801.80 Italian lire, up from 1,792.11.

<HEADLINE> Steel Industry Seeks Quota Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. steel industry will begin airing  
television and radio advertisements Sunday to increase pressure on 
the Senate to support quotas to block low-priced steel imports. 
</P>
<P>
	The House passed a quota bill, 289-141, in March despite the  
threat of a presidential veto, but the proposal faces a greater 
challenge in the Senate because the industry does not have the 
strength it does in the House. 
</P>
<P>
	The new broadcast spots mark the start of a campaign to build  
momentum in the Senate. The ads will run during morning news shows, 
talk radio and other public affairs programs in Washington and 
other selected markets. 
</P>
<P>
	``The goal of our advertising campaign is to convey our urgent  
message that illegally dumped foreign steel must be stopped in 
order to save our domestic steel industry,'' George Becker, 
president of the United Steelworkers of America, said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. industry is lobbying for passage of the quota measure  
to combat a flood of imports it blames for the loss of thousands of 
American jobs in the past year. The Clinton administration opposes 
the bill, fearing it could start a trade war and hurt U.S. 
industries that rely on foreign markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Steel imports rose again in March after four consecutive months  
of reductions. They reached record levels last year in the wake of 
the Asian economic crisis, which drove down demand for steel abroad 
and forced foreign producers to seek U.S. clients. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the Clinton administration ruled that Japan  
illegally dumped a core steel product, hot-rolled carbon steel, in 
U.S. markets at prices below production costs or home-market 
prices. Japan faces punitive tariffs as a result. Similar cases are 
pending against Brazil and Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	Steelworkers, meanwhile, have been pushing for quotas to block  
shipments from other countries and of other products as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., the chief sponsor of the quota  
bill, has said Senate action could come within weeks, but he would 
not say how many senators he has on board. 
</P>
<P>
	The 60-second ad that begins airing Sunday features Leticia  
Klisiak, a single mother who works as a crane operator at Bethlehem 
Steel's Burns Harbor plant in Portage, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
	She complains of the foreign pricing practices and blames the  
imports for layoffs and bankruptcies at U.S. steel mills. Viewers 
and listeners are then urged to call their senators. 
</P>
<P>
	Marco Trbovich, a union spokesman, said other spots will air in  
the future. The ads will run primarily in Washington at first and 
will eventually spread to the states of ``targeted senators,'' whom 
he would not name. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials would not disclose how much the initial ads will cost  
or how long they will run, saying those details are still being 
finalized. The ads complement the steelworkers' letter-writing and 
phone-calling campaigns.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Home, Turns to U.S. Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Back from visiting the troops in Europe,  
President Clinton tended to domestic affairs Friday: a $700,000 
fund-raising day in Texas and plans for a conference on school 
violence after the Littleton, Colo., tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to understand there are forces at work in our society  
that call on us to make an extra effort to protect our children 
from violence,'' he said at a $450,000 fund-raising luncheon for 
about four dozen people in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	While Clinton said parents, students, firearms makers and movie  
moguls all should be reflecting on implications of Littleton, he 
urged people to resist assigning blame. ``Instead of saying, `Whose 
fault is this?,''' he said, ``we should all say, `What can I do to 
take responsibility?''' 
</P>
<P>
	The president also planned to survey tornado damage in Oklahoma  
during his two-day trip West. Clinton declared major disasters in 
Oklahoma, Kansas and one county in Texas after powerful twisters 
razed communities and left dozens dead. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our thoughts and prayers are with the people of Oklahoma,  
Kansas and Texas, with the people of Tennessee who also endured 
terrible storms and destruction,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Later Friday, Clinton was the featured guest at a $250,000  
dinner in Austin at the home of prominent Democrat and Clinton ally 
Roy Spence. He had canceled a fund-raising trip to Texas scheduled 
the week of the Littleton shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said curbing school violence will require the same kind  
of sustained national efforts that reduced teen pregnancy and 
helped trim welfare rolls. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is the kind of national commitment we need to protect our  
children from violence,'' he said. ``I believe more than anything 
else we need a grass-roots effort which involves every single 
American from the White House down to the smallest community; a 
national campaign that draws out everyone's commitment, all our 
resources and depends upon everyone taking responsibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When, in the wake of Littleton, Clinton set up a White House  
conference on school violence, he also urged students across the 
country to reach beyond their own cliques to understand their 
classmates better. 
</P>
<P>
	A list of participants for Monday's conference, which featured  
leaders in education, law enforcement and entertainment, didn't 
include advocates from the other side of the gun-control debate. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Rifle Association, the nation's largest gun lobby,  
said it was not invited. It scheduled its own news conference to 
announce proposals that the NRA said can have an ``immediate and 
significant impact on violent crime in America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said that in addition to encouraging parents to  
communicate more with their children and entertainment moguls to 
consider the effects of their films, the problem of youth violence 
also requires new gun-control measures. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope we will be able to avoid another fight in Washington  
between the NRA and others,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The president also voiced support for a hate-crime bill  
submitted to the Texas legislature after the murder of James Lee 
Byrd, a black man dragged behind a pickup truck by a group of white 
men. 
</P>
<P>
	``For me, as a white Southerner, the thought that a man could be  
murdered because of his race in 1999 is heartbreaking,'' Clinton 
said. ``I hope that law will pass.''

<HEADLINE> Real Estate Funds at Turning Point </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Mutual funds that invest in real estate appear  
to have reached one of those point-of-no-return moments that truly 
separate the bulls from the bears. 
</P>
<P>
	Before staging a rally in April, real estate funds took a  
serious pounding all through 1998 and the first quarter of 1999. 
The losses erased many of the gains the funds had built up in the 
previous three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, it seems, it's time for investors, and fund managers, to  
decide whether they think a sustained comeback is in the offing -- 
or whether vehicles such as real estate investment trusts, or 
REITs, just aren't destined to play as big a role in fund 
portfolios as their partisans once believed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although 1998 has been a tough year for REITs, we believe they  
are now offering some of the best fundamentals of any publicly 
traded companies and are selling at recession-like multiples,'' 
says Andrew Davis, manager of the Davis Real Estate Fund in Santa 
Fe, N.M. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that the long winter for REIT shareholders has  
finally ended,'' declares Cohen &AMP; Steers Capital Management Inc., a 
New York firm that runs the biggest of all real estate mutual 
funds, the $1.75 billion Cohen &AMP; Steers Realty Shares. 
</P>
<P>
	But managers are singing a different tune at another New York  
fund that has been a high-profile proponent of REIT investing, the 
Baron Growth &AMP; Income Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	Through its four-year history, this fund, part of a three-fund  
family specializing in smaller growth stocks, has relied mainly on 
REITs for the income side of its portfolio. But now it has decided 
to downplay them, and is seeking shareholder approval to change its 
name to Baron Growth Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	``REITs ... no longer offer unique opportunities for growth,''  
manager Ronald Baron writes in the fund's latest quarterly report. 
``REITs have completed their cyclical recovery from the real estate 
depression of the early 1990s and the industry is, in our opinion, 
more fairly priced. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are fewer and fewer small-cap real estate businesses  
with great prospects and dynamic management teams,'' Baron asserts. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the research firm of Lipper Inc., the approximately  
125 funds that invest in REITs and other real-estate businesses had 
a negative return in the first quarter this year of 4.62 percent, 
bringing their loss for the 12 months ended March 31 to 20.42 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	That put them in the lowly company of emerging markets mutual  
funds, which fell 25.45 percent over the same span as they 
contended with currency and debt crises in Asia, Russia and Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen &AMP; Steers, in a report just published for investment  
advisers, observes, ``The latest bear market (for REITs) was longer 
than and nearly as deep as the 1989-90 episode, which was 
accompanied by the worst real estate crisis of our generation. 
</P>
<P>
	``In contrast, real estate fundamentals today are as strong as  
ever, and this has resulted in strong profit growth for the REIT 
industry. Therefore, it is quite possible that this bear market was 
primarily valuation- and sentiment-based rather than fundamentally 
justified.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the numbers were so good, why did sentiment get so bad? Cohen  
&AMP; Steers says fears focused on slowing economic growth worldwide, 
which evoked visions of increased vacancies and falling rents in 
commercial property, as well as concern that real estate prices 
might weaken in a disinflationary, or deflationary, environment. 
</P>
<P>
	Furthermore, the Internet mania in the stock market appears to  
have cast a shadow over some real estate investments. With the rise 
of electronic retailing and other World Wide Web businesses, the 
reasoning goes, bricks-and-mortar properties may be consigned to a 
diminished role in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	But the optimists insist that these worries generally are  
unjustified or overblown. Because REITs are in disfavor, says 
Davis, ``Real estate is trading cheaper on Wall Street than Main 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since the late 1980s, the real estate industry has undergone  
substantial structural changes, including increased disclosure 
requirements, improved methods of valuations and a growing number 
of seasoned managers with inside ownership,'' Davis argues. ``We 
believe these changes make a compelling case for real estate as a 
long-term investment.''

<HEADLINE>  Mourning, Heat Seek Breakthrough  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Alonzo Mourning walked off the practice court  
sweating and scowling, which is how he always looks when the New 
York Knicks are coming to town. 
</P>
<P>
	Another showdown looms Saturday, when the Knicks face the Miami  
Heat in Game 1 of their first-round playoff series. The matchup 
marks the start of a postseason that could define Mourning's 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	He is coming off his best season -- 20 points and 11 rebounds per  
game, 180 blocked shots to lead the NBA, and endorsements from 
teammates and opponents as the league's most valuable player. 
</P>
<P>
	But elimination of the Heat by the hated Knicks would reinforce  
Mourning's reputation for folding under pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Zo will be ready for whatever they throw at him,''  
teammate P.J. Brown said. ``It's definitely a chance to add icing 
on the cake to the great year he's had.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mourning has become rattled in each of the three playoff series  
the Heat have lost under coach Pat Riley. First it was the Chicago 
Bulls' Dennis Rodman that got under Mourning's skin. Last season 
the Knicks' Larry Johnson lured Mourning into a Game 4 slugfest and 
suspension from the deciding Game 5, which Miami lost. 
</P>
<P>
	That's the baggage Mourning takes into Saturday's game.  
</P>
<P>
	``All players go through a period where there's a wall, and  
you've got to break through it and get over the top,'' Riley said. 
``It's a rite of passage. The playoffs always tell.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The last time the Knicks played in Miami, two weeks ago,  
Mourning had 27 points through three quarters, then had two points 
and no rebounds in the fourth quarter. The Knicks rallied from a 
20-point deficit to win, and their locker room later filled with 
laughter when Johnson staggered across the shower floor in an 
impersonation of Mourning wilting under the pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Mourning snapped at a reporter who mentioned  
Johnson's name. Mourning then said he doesn't know whether the 
Knicks will try to get physical with him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really don't care,'' he said. ``It's not going to be a  
factor at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be a physical series, but not dirty,'' Johnson  
said. ``Both teams are ready for war.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mourning said the only thing that matters to Miami is the goal  
of reaching the NBA Finals for the first time. With Michael Jordan 
retired and no dominant team in the league, there's a void at the 
top. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've learned, just like the Bulls had to learn,'' Mourning  
said. ``They lost against good teams. They took a lot of falls. I 
watched it when I was in junior high school. I saw Michael on the 
bench crying. I remember those moments against Detroit, getting 
their butts kicked. We took the same hits he took.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The most painful hit came last year against the Knicks, but  
bitter feelings between the two teams date to 1995, when Riley left 
New York amid considerable acrimony. A brawl started by Brown and 
Charlie Ward proved pivotal in the 1997 playoff series, won by 
Miami. After the Knicks eliminated the Heat last year, Riley and 
Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy were summoned to the NBA commissioner's 
office and scolded for their verbal feuding. 
</P>
<P>
	Riley said he expect this year's series to be physical but not  
so personal as in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would think that behavior would be over,'' he said. ``There  
can't be any false bravado or antics or anything on a personal 
agenda. We've been through that scene. We're all tired of it. I 
think that's a thing of the past.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doubts remain as to whether Mourning can become a championship  
center, but his value to the Heat is unquestioned. When he was 
sidelined last week with an eye injury, Miami lost consecutive 
games to a pair of lottery teams, Boston and Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thing they have this year is they've got the MVP of the  
league,'' Van Gundy said. ``He's been by far the most dominant 
player in the league, and we're going to have to combat that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mourning, who has three seasons left on a seven-year, $105  
million contract, is the best-paid athlete in South Florida. 
Although he has never enjoyed the popularity of Dan Marino, or even 
Craig Counsell, fans chanted ``M-V-P, M-V-P'' during the final home 
game of the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	But Mourning knows how cheers can quickly change to jeers. It  
can happen in the space of a five-game playoff series.

<HEADLINE> Rockies Tie Scoring Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Philadelphia ace Curt Schilling finally put an end  
to Colorado's scoring frenzy -- but not before the Rockies entered 
the record books. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Walker hit a two-out solo homer in the first inning Friday  
night as the Rockies tied the National League record by scoring at 
least one run in 14 consecutive innings. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockies, who began their streak in the sixth inning Tuesday  
against the Chicago Cubs, joined the 1894 Pittsburgh Pirates and 
the 1949 New York Giants as the third NL team to score in 14 
straight. 
</P>
<P>
	The major league record is 17 innings by the Boston Red Sox in  
1903. 
</P>
<P>
	Schilling struck out leadoff hitter Darryl Hamilton and retired  
Mike Lansing on a long fly ball before Walker lined the first pitch 
he saw over the wall in right-center field for his seventh homer of 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado nearly extended the streak in the second, putting  
runners on first and second with two outs, but Schilling struck out 
opposing pitcher John Thomson on three pitches.

<HEADLINE>  Mourning, Heat Seek Breakthrough  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Alonzo Mourning walked off the practice court  
sweating and scowling, which is how he always looks when the New 
York Knicks are coming to town. 
</P>
<P>
	Another showdown looms Saturday, when the Knicks face the Miami  
Heat in Game 1 of their first-round playoff series. The matchup 
marks the start of a postseason that could define Mourning's 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	He is coming off his best season -- 20 points and 11 rebounds per  
game, 180 blocked shots to lead the NBA, and endorsements from 
teammates and opponents as the league's most valuable player. 
</P>
<P>
	But elimination of the Heat by the hated Knicks would reinforce  
Mourning's reputation for folding under pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Zo will be ready for whatever they throw at him,''  
teammate P.J. Brown said. ``It's definitely a chance to add icing 
on the cake to the great year he's had.'' 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends at Record of 11,031.59 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks climbed higher Friday, pushing the Dow  
Jones industrial average to a new closing high, after the 
government's employment report eased worries about higher interest 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The blue-chip index rose 84.77 to 11,031.59, surpassing the  
prior record of 11,014.69 reached Monday. The Dow rose 242.55 for 
the week, and is up 20 percent so far this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mostly higher. The Standard &AMP;  
Poor's 500 index was up 12.95 at 1,345.00, and rose 9.82 for the 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology shares enjoyed moderate gains, lifting the Nasdaq  
composite index 31.34 to 2,503.62. The Nasdaq lost 39.23 for the 
week, and is up 14 percent for the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's big winner on the Dow was IBM, up 8 to 217 1/4. Analysts  
at SoundView Technology released a bullish outlook on the computer 
giant's second-quarter performance. 
</P>
<P>
	The market had anxiously awaited the Labor Department's monthly  
jobs report, fearing it might point toward an increase in interest 
rates. But the news was better than expected. 
</P>
<P>
	The government said the nation's unemployment rate in April was  
4.3 percent, only slightly higher than the 29-year-low of 4.2 
percent reached in March. The report also showed that the U.S. 
economy created 234,000 jobs in April, just 7,000 more than the 
March level, which had been the weakest monthly increase in more 
than three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the continuing low unemployment and the steady increase  
in job creation, average hourly wages rose just 0.2 percent in 
April and are up only 3.2 percent over the past 12 months. The 
report helped ease concerns that the Federal Reserve might raise 
interest rates to cool down the robust economy and head off a spurt 
in inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	``This economy is still in the sweet spot,'' said Robert  
Freedman, executive vice president of the John Hancock Funds in 
Boston. He said the jobs report indicated that inflation is nowhere 
in sight. 
</P>
<P>
	``Manufacturing is improving, consumer spending is healthy, auto  
sales are strong and the economy is growing at a moderate 
strength,'' Freedman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The jobs report came a day after Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan  
warned that labor shortages and rising wages could lead to rising 
inflation and higher interest rates. Higher rates are the market's 
nemesis because they can quickly eat into corporate earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold stocks fell amid a steep drop in gold prices after the  
British Treasury announced plans to sell 125 tons of gold this 
financial year. Getchell Gold, lost 6 3/16 at 31 3/4 on the American 
Stock Exchange 
</P>
<P>
	Among technology issues, America Online fell 1 9/16 to 118 3/16,  
Dell Computer rose 3/4 to 40 3/8, Amazon.com fell 1 to 136 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a narrow margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where consolidated volume came to 983.5 
million shares, down from 1.05 billion on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was up 5.02 at 641.24, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index was down 0.52 at 787.29. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies was up 2.73 to  
436.11 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 2.05 percent,  
Germany's DAX index was up 0.24 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 
0.07 percent, and France's CAC-40 fell 1 percent.

<HEADLINE> Christian Coalition Plans Radio Ads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Christian Coalition says in an upcoming  
radio ad campaign that the Colorado school shootings show that that 
America must put ``God back in our schools and parents back in our 
homes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ads are scheduled to air on 65 Iowa-area stations and 22 New  
Hampshire-area stations, timed to coincide with President Clinton 
summit on school violence Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's time for Congress to lift the ban on the expression of  
faith in our classrooms,'' Christian Coalition director Randy Tate 
says in the spots. ``Give our kids the opportunity to pray, and our 
teachers the freedom to discuss morality and decency.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He says tax cuts for families, a cornerstone of the coalition's  
legislative agenda, would give parents more time to be home. 
</P>
<P>
	``As America struggles to understand the terrible tragedy of  
Littleton, we urge all candidates for office, regardless of party, 
to pledge their support for putting God back in our schools, and 
parents back in our homes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ad will run through at least Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Verdict Worries Other Talk Shows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Now talk show hosts have something else to worry  
about besides their dwindling ratings. 
</P>
<P>
	A jury's $25 million verdict Friday against ``The Jenny Jones  
Show'' for negligence in the shooting death of a homosexual guest 
who admitted a crush on another man is a serious blow to a 
beleaguered industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it was an accident waiting to happen,'' said Geraldo  
Rivera, who stopped his own free-wheeling syndicated talk show last 
year and now is host of a nightly legal talk show on CNBC. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury held the show responsible for luring a man onto the  
show believing he would be meeting a woman, then humiliating him 
when his secret admirer turned out to be a man. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe we'll do something about these shows ... and there'll be  
no more killing,'' said Frank Amedure, father of victim Scott 
Amedure. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for Amedure's family argued that the case will force  
talk shows to regulate themselves so harm isn't done to their 
guests. The show's lawyers warned that the verdict, if left to 
stand on appeal, could open talk and news shows to liability simply 
if guests are embarrassed about what happens to them. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Thompson, director of the Center for the Study of Popular  
Television at Syracuse University, said he worried about the 
precedents. 
</P>
<P>
	``If every talk show feels they need to do psychological testing  
before a guest can go on, some people will be denied access,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Representatives of several talk shows declined to speak about  
the case Friday, including the combative ``Jerry Springer Show.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Except for Springer, most talk shows have seen their ratings go  
down recently. Experts say they are hurt by the popularity of legal 
shows like ``Judge Judy'' and market saturation -- too many shows 
competing for a limited audience. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones' show, for instance, has seen its ratings slip 20 percent  
this year. Sally Jesse Raphael, Montel Williams, Oprah Winfrey, 
Rosie O'Donnell, Regis Philbin and Kathie Lee Gifford and Maury 
Povich have also seen dwindling numbers. Howie Mandel's talk show 
was recently canceled. 
</P>
<P>
	Rivera said he decided to step back from the sleaze when he  
taped a show, ``Terrible Family Secrets,'' where a woman came on 
the air to surprise her husband with the news that she was leaving 
him and that he wasn't the father of one of their children. 
</P>
<P>
	The man stalked off the set, and the show never aired, Rivera  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just got to the point where everyone was trying to reach  
the lowest common denominator and it became so clear, so apparent, 
that it was a course of action headed for tragedy,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Amy Fisher To Work in Fashion Biz </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Amy Fisher, the ``Long Island Lolita'' who  
shot the wife of her lover, will head to work in the fashion 
industry after her pending release from prison, her lawyer says. 
</P>
<P>
	The state Parole Board voted 2-1 on Thursday to free Ms. Fisher,  
24, who will be released within a week and live in the New York 
City area. 
</P>
<P>
	Her lawyer, Bruce Barket, said a fashion job awaits Ms. Fisher  
after she leaves Albion Correctional Facility in western New York. 
He said she ``really would like to have some privacy'' after being 
released. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Fisher pleaded guilty in 1992 to assault and was sentenced  
to five to 15 years in prison for shooting Mary Jo Buttafuoco in 
the head. Mrs. Buttafuoco, then 37, survived. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Fisher, then 17, had been having an affair with Joey  
Buttafuoco, the 38-year-old owner of an auto body shop. He pleaded 
guilty to statutory rape and served six months in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	The trio's saga became much-trodden tabloid fare, and ABC, NBC  
and CBS all aired movies about Ms. Fisher in the same week -- two on 
the same night. 
</P>
<P>
	The Buttafuocos now live in Los Angeles, where Buttafuoco has  
been a cable television talk show host and is pursuing an acting 
career. A publicist for the couple had no comment on the parole 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Ms. Fisher apologized to Mrs. Buttafuoco, who  
forgave her. The two had corresponded for several months. With the 
support of prosecutors and Mrs. Buttafuoco, a judge reduced Ms. 
Fisher's sentence to 3 1/2 to 10 1/2 years, making her immediately 
eligible for parole. 
</P>
<P>
	She will be on parole until 2003.  
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Fisher's mother, Rose Fisher, said in a statement that she  
had ``prayed and waited for this moment to arrive. Knowing my 
daughter is coming home is the best Mother's Day gift I could wish 
for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even without parole, Ms. Fisher would have been eligible for  
release at the end of August.

<HEADLINE> Yosemite-Area Deaths May Be Linked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRESNO, Calif. (AP) -- The FBI is looking into a possible link  
between a man found dead in a river and three tourists slain near 
Yosemite National Park. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know if his death was a result of a deliberate act or  
accidental,'' FBI agent Joseph Sheehan said Thursday. If 
deliberate, ``the next step would be establishing a motive, and 
does it tie to this case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Terry Ray's decomposed body was pulled from the Tuolumne River  
on April 6, almost a month after he was last seen alive. The 
Stanislaus County coroner's office says it is still awaiting 
toxicology and tissue reports that could help determine a cause of 
death. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis Ray, Terry Ray's brother, said Thursday his nephew told  
him that Terry Ray had seen 15-year-old Juli Sund being sexually 
abused at a house in Modesto. 
</P>
<P>
	``Terry walked into a bedroom and saw this girl getting raped  
and left,'' Dennis Ray told The Associated Press. ``He had no 
respect for sex offenders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis Ray said his brother was a car thief who made mailbox  
keys for several people who have since been questioned extensively 
by FBI agents pursuing the sightseers case. He said he didn't know 
whether Terry Ray revealed before he died who he saw attacking the 
girl, or why he was at the house at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	The Modesto Bee first reported the Ray family's allegations  
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Juli Sund, her mother, Carole, and family friend Silvina Pelosso  
of Argentina vanished after being seen Feb. 15 at a restaurant near 
Yosemite. 
</P>
<P>
	The bodies of Mrs. Sund, 42, and Ms. Pelosso, 16, were found  
March 19, burnt beyond recognition in the trunk of their charred 
rental car. Juli Sund's body was found March 26, more than 30 miles 
away on a hill overlooking a reservoir. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bee, citing unidentified investigative sources, reported  
last week that Juli Sund may have been kept alive for up to three 
weeks, enduring torture and sexual abuse, after her mother and Ms. 
Pelosso were slain. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI has refused to comment on any evidence in the case.  
Sheehan also refused to comment on whether any of Ray's relatives 
have been interviewed by the Yosemite task force. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray's body was pulled from the river in Modesto, 50 miles west  
of where Juli Sund's body was found. Dennis Ray said his brother 
was a good swimmer and would not have drowned accidentally. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal grand jury witnesses have confirmed that they were asked  
about a loosely knit band of parolees with a history of drug abuse 
and sex offenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Terry Ray apparently had several connections to people who have  
been questioned in the case, but Dennis Ray and his sister, 
Virginia, told the Bee he would never have been involved in a 
murder. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a thief,'' Dennis Ray said. ``He was doing some funky  
stuff, but nothing like this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The siblings say Terry Ray made counterfeit mailbox keys and  
phony identification cards, and sold them to at least four men who 
have been questioned in connection with the Yosemite case and are 
in custody on parole violations and unrelated charges.

<HEADLINE> Sparkling Field for Pimlico Special </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- The emphasis is on quality, not quantity, in  
the Pimlico Special. 
</P>
<P>
	Only five horses are to run in Saturday's $500,000 Grade I race.  
That doesn't mean picking the winner will be easy, because the 
three favorites all carry impressive credentials and have valuable 
experience in going 1 3-16 miles on the dirt at Pimlico Race Track. 
</P>
<P>
	Free House, the 6-5 favorite, took second in the 1997 Preakness  
at Pimlico, losing by a head to Silver Charm. The 5-year-old gray 
has earnings of more than $3 million and has won both his races 
this year -- including a payback victory over Silver Charm in the 
prestigious Santa Anita Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
	It isn't often Real Quiet is an underdog, but that's the case  
this time. Real Quiet followed his 1998 Kentucky Derby triumph with 
a victory in the Preakness. He's since finished second in three 
straight races. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, it's hard to argue with his record -- 14 finishes in the  
money over 17 races and $2.3 million in career earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Trainer Bob Baffert said Friday a five-horse race is fine. But  
he would have preferred a six-horse field that included 
Littlebitlively, who defeated Real Quiet last month in the Texas 
Mile but was an early scratch in the Special. 
</P>
<P>
	``With Littlebitlively running, Free House would have had more  
speed to deal with early,'' Baffert said. 
</P>
<P>
	Precocity, a 2-1 choice, took second in last year's Special and  
has won two of his last three races -- including a 1 1/2-length victory 
over Real Quiet in the New Orleans Handicap in March. 
</P>
<P>
	The other two horses in the field, Fred Bear Claw and Brushing  
Up, will open at 20-1. Fred Bear Claw, a 5-year-old, has the 
home-turf advantage in that he is Maryland-owned and will be ridden 
by jockey Edgar Prado, who knows the nuances of Pimlico as well as 
anyone. 
</P>
<P>
	Brushing Up has the edge in experience -- he's run a whopping 73  
races and has finished in the money 23 times. He took first place 
in the Stymie Handicap at Aqueduct in February and is coming off a 
fourth-place finish in the Excelsior Breeder's Cup Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
	Free House trainer J. Paco Gonzalez has the utmost respect for  
the field, but fully expects to be in the winner's circle Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Precocity is a really nice horse and so is Real Quiet,''  
Gonzalez said. ``But I have a feeling we have the best horse here. 
We've won two in a row and Real Quiet has been beaten the last 
couple of times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzalez figures Free House will bolt from the No. 4 post and  
force the field to chase him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Real Quiet is going to be behind us. He doesn't have the speed  
we have but he's going to be close,'' Gonzalez said. ``The one that 
will be far back is Precocity because he cannot match the speed we 
have. He comes from off the pace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Free House, to be ridden by Chris McCarron, will be assigned 124  
pounds, four more than Real Quiet. Precocity will carry 118 pounds, 
Fred Bear Claw 112 and Brushing Up 111. 
</P>
<P>
	The winner will join an impressive group of Pimlico Special  
champions that includes War Admiral, Whirlaway, Strike The Gold and 
Cigar. 
</P>
<P>
	``The prestige of this race is what brought us here,'' Gonzalez  
said.

<HEADLINE> Profits Sink at Lloyd's of London </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Greater competition in the British auto insurance  
market contributed to a 48 percent decline in earnings at Lloyd's 
of London and said the downward trend is likely to continue. 
</P>
<P>
	Lloyd's, an insurance market with investors from more than 70  
countries, posted a profit Friday of 606 million pounds, or $993 
million, for 1996, down from a record profit of 1.16 billion pounds 
in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	It releases financial results three years after the fact because  
of the time it takes to process many complex claims. 
</P>
<P>
	``Results inevitably reflect world trends in international  
insurance,'' chairman Max Taylor said in a statement. ``There is no 
evidence of an upturn in conditions yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lloyd's forecasts it will report earnings of 70 million pounds  
for 1997 and expects to show a loss of some 60 million pounds for 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``The trends affecting the industry as a whole, however, suggest  
that the eventual result is likely to be worse than the 
estimates,'' Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
	Increased competition has eroded Lloyd's share in many insurance  
markets. Its lack of innovation in designing new products has also 
played a part, said Jeffrey Dunsavage, an analyst with A.M. Best, 
an insurance rating firm based in Oldwick, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	On the plus side, Lloyd's leads competitors in some important  
markets, and its prestigious reputation continues to carry weight. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1996 profit comprises 359 million pounds in income earned  
during the year plus an allotment of 247 million pounds taken from 
a reserve of funds earned in previous years. The combined figure 
represents a 16 percent return on net insurance premiums. 
</P>
<P>
	Lloyd's fared worst in the auto insurance business, losing 104  
million pounds in 1996. It earned a 22 percent return on net 
premiums in marine insurance and a 20 percent return in non-marine 
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	Lloyd's performed best in the aviation business, posting a 31  
percent return on net premiums. However, overcapacity in that 
market has squeezed profit margins in subsequent years, it said.

<HEADLINE> Rangers Look to Stars for President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- The Texas Rangers and Dallas Stars  
already advertise at each other's games, have links to the each 
other on their Web sites and share a weekly television program. 
They have the same owner. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, they also have the same president.  
</P>
<P>
	Stars president Jim Lites was given the same job with the  
Rangers on Friday as owner Tom Hicks attempts to merge the clubs' 
front offices. Lites joins a small fraternity of people in charge 
of multiple pro sports franchises. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jim is very energetic, he's very competitive and he's very  
focused,'' Hicks said. ``This will mean more access to sports 
entertainment for baseball fans and hockey fans. It also means Jim 
Lites will be a very busy person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rangers and Stars have been working together since Hicks  
bought the baseball team last summer. He bought the Stars in 
December 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Hicks envisions one business team running both clubs while  
keeping separate the hockey and baseball specialists. He had the 
perfect opportunity to try it when Rangers president Tom Schieffer 
resigned last week to help develop the area around The Ballpark in 
Arlington. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can run both businesses with better talent and fewer people  
than if we had to run both separately,'' he said. ``It gave us 
savings on the administration of the teams that will free up 
resources to invest in players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lites, 46, has been president since the Stars moved to Dallas  
before the 1993-94 season. He was an executive with the Detroit Red 
Wings the previous 11 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Lites, the Stars have gone from also-rans who played in  
front of thousands of empty seats to the NHL's best regular-season 
team, playing before sellout crowds. Their improvement took a big 
leap when Hicks bought the team in December 1995 and expanded the 
payroll to bring in goaltender Ed Belfour two seasons ago and Brett 
Hull this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Lites' biggest accomplishment, though, may be helping hockey  
become popular among North Texas youth. Since the team arrived, 
recreational leagues have mushroomed and several high school teams 
have started hockey programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Schieffer's legacy was getting The Ballpark built, but he also  
oversaw the team's rise to division champions. The Rangers won 
their first AL West title in 1996 and did it again last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will not come in here and change significantly the way the  
Texas Rangers do business,'' Lites said. ``Tom Schieffer has built 
this building and this franchise into one of the most successful in 
major league baseball and the traditions that have been created 
here will be honored -- believe me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hicks said Lites will be ``a sounding board'' for ideas and  
suggestions from Rangers general manager Doug Melvin, just as he's 
been with Stars GM Bob Gainey. Hicks will be the decision-maker for 
both teams, as he's been all along. 
</P>
<P>
	``The recommendations will come from the bottom up, not the top  
down,'' Hicks said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hicks also announced Friday a restructuring of duties at  
Southwest Sports Group, the holding company that technically owns 
the Rangers and Stars plus the Mesquite Rodeo, local television 
station KXTX and a production company. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Cramer, who has been chief operating officer since SSG  
was formed last summer, will continue in that role but will have 
more duties. He's now in charge of all business matters, broadcast 
entitities and new sports and media ventures. 
</P>
<P>
	SSG's chief financial officer will be John McMichael, who had  
been the Rangers' executive vice president for business operations. 
McMichael also will oversee stadium operations and he'll assist 
Hicks on baseball ownership matters. 
</P>
<P>
	``While the sports people will be in charge of sports, the  
business people will be in charge of things like finance, media, 
long-term planning and budgeting ... all the important things that 
are not really a factor to fans, but are extremely important to the 
economics of professional sports,'' Hicks said.

<HEADLINE>  Jury Deliberates Cable Car Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- A military jury today weighed whether  
a Marine pilot obstructed justice when he helped destroy a 
videotape shot before his jet clipped an Italian gondola cable, 
killing 20 people. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-man military jury began deliberations this morning in  
the trial of Capt. Richard Ashby, who is charged with obstruction 
of justice and conspiracy. He could receive up to 10 years in 
prison if convicted, or be dismissed from the Marines. 
</P>
<P>
	In closing arguments Thursday, a prosecutor said Ashby intended  
to impede an investigation into the tragedy when he took the 
videotape from his damaged jet. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who in this situation had the most to gain to make sure there  
wasn't any information about this flight?'' Maj. Daniel Daugherty 
said. ``He handed over that tape knowing it was going to be 
destroyed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 32-year-old Marine pilot doesn't deny removing the tape  
filmed by his navigator. His lawyer, Frank Spinner, said Ashby had 
no criminal intent but had ``exercised poor judgment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby, of Mission Viejo, Calif., was the pilot of a EA-6B  
Prowler that severed a ski gondola cable near Cavalese, Italy, on 
Feb. 3, 1998, causing the 20 people aboard to plunge more than 350 
feet to their deaths. His acquittal on manslaughter charges in 
March outraged Italians and renewed calls to ban Americans from 
NATO air bases in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	After the jet landed, Ashby put the tape in his flight suit  
pocket. He retrieved it a few days later, wanting to see what was 
on it, he testified, but couldn't find a video player and handed it 
over to the navigator, Capt. Joseph Schweitzer, 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Schweitzer, who pleaded guilty to the charges Ashby faces and  
was sentenced to dismissal from the Marines, said he later threw 
the tape into a bonfire. Schweitzer said he feared that the tape, 
which included shots of the flight before the accident and images 
of his face, would be played in the Italian media with scenes of 
the carnage. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Ashby and Schweitzer's actions showed  
calculating, criminal intent to mislead investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	``They knew when they brought a $50 million aircraft back badly  
damaged there was going to be an investigation,'' Daugherty said. 
``Without that tape, there's a lot of speculation. Without that 
tape, we'll never know for sure what went on in that cockpit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two back seat crewmen in the radar-jamming aircraft were charged  
after the accident. The charges were dismissed last year.

<HEADLINE> House Probes Atlanta's Olympic Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The chairman of the congressional investigation  
into Atlanta's Olympic bid said Friday that he hopes the process 
was clean, but that his subcommittee must see all the records to 
make sure. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., chairman of the subcommittee on  
oversight and investigations, and Tom Bliley, R-Va., chairman of 
the House Commerce Committee, sent a letter to former Olympics 
chief Billy Payne on Thursday requesting all 1,400 documents 
pertaining to the bid. The documents are at the center of a court 
fight in Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to think that we're not going to find anything,''  
Upton said. ``That's my hope. But we'll see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The committee wants to determine if the boxes of records contain  
evidence of bribery akin to the scandal that has tainted Salt Lake 
City's bid for the 2002 Winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to begin to ascertain whether the regrettable events  
surrounding the IOC's selection of Salt Lake City were an 
aberration, or part of a broader pattern or practice associated 
with other Olympic site selection bids,'' Bliley and Upton said in 
the letter. 
</P>
<P>
	The Atlanta Journal-Constitution has been fighting to open the  
records. On Wednesday, the Georgia Amateur Athletics Foundation, a 
private group holding the records, filed suit seeking a ruling that 
the documents do not fall under Georgia's Open Records Act. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit was prompted by Georgia Attorney General Thurbert  
Baker, who said the refusal to make the documents available to the 
public lends credence to the belief that the GAAF has something to 
hide. 
</P>
<P>
	The athletics foundation, created by Payne in 1987 to bid for  
the Olympics, says the documents are the property of a group of 
private citizens. 
</P>
<P>
	But Baker says the records must be opened because Atlanta's  
Olympic efforts involved a partnership between government and 
private interests. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee Echols, a spokesman for Olympic organizers, said they will  
cooperate fully with the subcommittee's request. 
</P>
<P>
	``We welcome this inquiry because we have always said we would  
work closely with any government inquiry about the Atlanta games,'' 
he said. ``Frankly we think this may be a more thorough and 
objective forum through which to set the record straight about the 
Atlanta Games and perhaps keep some of the lawyers and news media 
at bay.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the organizers do not comply with the request, the committee  
could subpoena the records, Upton said. Some of the documents could 
be made public if the committee decides it is necessary to hold a 
hearing on the Olympic bid process, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Upton said the subcommittee wants to identify whether there were  
illegal bribes to or excessive spending on International Olympic 
Committee members. If so, he said, he wants legislation to prevent 
a similar occurrence. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're looking to see if the current law works and to see if it  
needs modifications or amendments,'' he said. ``That's the purpose 
of our subcommittee.''

<HEADLINE> Mother's Day Cards Change With Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- The woman with the reddish-brown hair  
and the soft smile knows precisely where she's going. She strides 
down the aisle of silver metal shelves and gray cartons, halts 
midway and reaches up. She opens a box, and out come America's 
feelings. 
</P>
<P>
	This is Sharman Robertson's world, where the temperature is  
perpetually 65 degrees, the humidity 45 percent and the lighting 
fluorescent. 
</P>
<P>
	But the sterile setting can mislead. As corporate archivist at  
Hallmark Cards, Robertson oversees the kingdom of heartfelt 
sentiments -- the messiest realm of all. 
</P>
<P>
	The particular box she's chosen -- section B3F.1, according to  
the Sharman Decimal System -- contains a seasonal collection of 
cards. Yet these cardboard kindnesses reveal an America where 
depictions of love, gender and maternal roles were very different: 
Mother's Day 1931. 
</P>
<P>
	One apron-shaped card is dedicated ``to mother's apron  
strings.'' Another depicts a kitchen replete with steaming pots and 
freshly baked bread: ``It could grace the finest palace with the 
magic spell it wove/while preparin' dishes fit for any king -- My 
Mother's Stove.'' (Compare that with this, one of Hallmark's 1,032 
Mother's Day cards for 1999: ``Hope no one has already taken 
www.1coolmom.com.'') 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of color-drenched treasures abound in the Hallmark  
archives, where the men and women who write and illustrate today's 
most popular cards delve into the past for inspiration. It fits 
with the philosophy of Hallmark founder J.C. Hall, a onetime 
horseradish and tooth-powder salesman who found a life of success 
by bringing fine art to the masses -- one slab of cardboard at a 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	``Objects locked away, that doesn't do any good for anyone. If  
you can't see it and work with it, there's not much point,'' says 
Robertson, 44, who came to Hallmark's Kansas City headquarters 10 
years ago after working as a National Parks Service archivist. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are tiny things that tell you about how they lived -- and  
what was important to them,'' she says. ``It's amazing to me that 
we can make something in this building and people are holding onto 
it 50 years later.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since the first Hall Bros. postcards appeared in 1910, Hallmark  
has helped a nation express itself. And as cultural markers for 
most of the 20th century, greeting cards have grown into something 
more than simple paper wishes. People keep them for years in 
personal archives and can't stand to throw them out. 
</P>
<P>
	And no wonder; they're tiny mirrors.  
</P>
<P>
	``Any popular languages, visual or verbal, were played out in  
greeting cards. They still are,'' says Jon Henderson, senior 
manager of Hallmark's Creative Resource Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Hallmark's archive demonstrates that sweep of attitudes over  
time, no small affair for a company whose livelihood -- $3.9 billion 
in consolidated net sales last year -- relies so heavily upon 
tradition. You could launch 500 dissertations from the material 
here, from gender studies or marketing to design or art history to 
psychology or anthropology. 
</P>
<P>
	Writers and artists from around Hallmark's ``campus'' stop in to  
troll for particular designs or general inspiration. ``They like 
the mustiness, the smell. And they want to touch the paper,'' 
Robertson says. 
</P>
<P>
	The result, with the help of computers, is often a collage -- a  
modern greeting executed on a card that may blend 19th-century 
borders with deco clip art and a techno font. 
</P>
<P>
	Like any good library, the archive offers not only organized  
access but the prospect of sweet serendipity. Archives, after all, 
are tangible catalogs of yesterday -- in this case, of the way 
yesterday's Americans wished each other well in word and image. 
</P>
<P>
	Pick a card from today's line and examine it. Odds are it  
contains pieces of previous card lines -- etching, embossing, gold 
stamping, perhaps laser-cutting that simulates the hand-cut lace of 
yore. 
</P>
<P>
	Look deeper, now, into other boxes. One, from the late J.C.  
Hall's personal archive, contains missives to the card king from 
the likes of Helen Hayes, J. Edgar Hoover and Winston Churchill. 
Some boldly sent him non-Hallmark cards, a bit like inviting Ronald 
McDonald out for a Whopper. 
</P>
<P>
	Others spill out cards that immediately take you to other eras.  
``To a swell guy on his birthday,'' says one, using a popular 
adjective from the 1920s and 1930s. Another features Pac-Man, that 
hungry mouth of early-1980s video arcades. 
</P>
<P>
	The guy holding up the boar's head as a Christmas feast wouldn't  
go over well with the vegetarian set today. And cards making fun of 
fat people have become far less popular. 
</P>
<P>
	Filed under ``smoking'' are various cards that depict tobacco  
use and iconography. A 1959 joke card issues a ``warning to the 
filter-tip smoker -- stop lighting the wrong end.'' On another, a 
mouth clenches an actual tiny cigarette that you can light. 
</P>
<P>
	Food, too, is an enduring theme. Ketchup bottles, egg cartons  
and salt shakers all make appearances. A get-well card sold from 
1949-51 shows a 12-pack of colored sodas, each with its own pun: 
``Just give what ails you the raspberry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Once you start looking, you can really get lost,'' Robertson  
says. 
</P>
<P>
	She received her first Hallmark, from a cousin, when she was a  
little girl in Florida. It depicted a woman in a skirt, and it was 
a ``mechanical''; the recipient could move around designs on the 
skirt. ``I've still got it,'' the archivist says, ``in a trunk full 
of all that kind of stuff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The archive has become her professional expression of the trunk  
full of stuff. She knows the sentiments, appreciates the designs, 
from the 19th-century collection of Louis Prang art (some of the 
world's first greeting cards) to the ledger-like ``Ornamental Arts 
of Japan'' to 1930s Hallmark sales samples. 
</P>
<P>
	More recent cards include ``Shoebox Greetings,'' an edgier line  
with jokes fit for television sitcoms. And many of today's 
greetings are aimed at recipients yesterday's card makers never 
thought of -- like office friends and a variety of in-laws. One 
``for a special mother'' is written in text and braille. Another 
makes a Y2K joke. 
</P>
<P>
	Computer influence is becoming ever more visible.  
Writer-designer Caroline Schaefer devised a multimedia card that 
took a bee from one source, a butterfly from another, flowers from 
yet another. For her, the archive was invaluable. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm quirky. A lot of my stuff has a quirky edge to it. And the  
archival materials are perfect for that,'' says Ms. Schaefer, 24. 
``It's so much nicer to go down there and touch it, to know that it 
exists in a digital world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robertson is launching a 50-year project -- digitizing and  
scanning everything so card designers like Ms. Schaefer can pull it 
up on their workstations. But will it be the same? Will the 
pixellated renditions of a century of texture replace the archival 
digging that Robertson advocates so vehemently? 
</P>
<P>
	She hopes not. But, she sighs, everything evolves -- everything  
except emotions, which are what they have always been: human. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think that ever changes,'' she says. ``People want to  
express the same feelings they did 200 years ago. The language may 
change, but the feelings stay the same.''

pocket. He retrieved it a few days later, wanting to see what was 
on it, he testified, but couldn't find a video player and handed it 
over to the navigator, Capt. Joseph Schweitzer, 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Schweitzer, who pleaded guilty to the charges Ashby faces and  
was sentenced to dismissal from the Marines, said he later threw 
the tape into a bonfire. Schweitzer said he feared that the tape, 
which included shots of the flight before the accident and images 
of his face, would be played in the Italian media with scenes of 
the carnage. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Ashby and Schweitzer's actions showed  
calculating, criminal intent to mislead investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	``They knew when they brought a $50 million aircraft back badly  
damaged there was going to be an investigation,'' Daugherty said. 
``Without that tape, there's a lot of speculation. Without that 
tape, we'll never know for sure what went on in that cockpit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two back seat crewmen in the radar-jamming aircraft were charged  
after the accident. The charges were dismissed last year.

<HEADLINE> Mud-Caked Baby Found After Tornado </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICKASHA, Okla. (AP) -- Something caught Deputy Robert Jolley's  
eye as he walked past a pile of rubble shortly after the Oklahoma 
tornadoes swept through. 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe it was just a shirt, he thought. But then it moved. He  
walked closer and saw brown curly hair sticking out of the red 
Oklahoma mud. It was a baby, a silent baby. 
</P>
<P>
	He did not feel the sting of chicken wire and wooden boards  
poking him as he dug through the mud. He just wanted to get to the 
little baby in blue overalls. Finally, he reached her. 
</P>
<P>
	She was warm. But she was not crying. Why wasn't she crying?  
</P>
<P>
	Her looked at the dirt encrusted baby. Her eyes and ears were  
packed tight with mud. Thoughts of his own 18-month-old daughter, 
Tia, made his heart race faster. Then 10-month-old Aleah Crago came 
to life. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just started removing and removing dirt from her eyes, then  
she cried,'' Jolley said Friday, recalling his find on Monday 
night. ``I never thought I would be so happy to hear a baby 
screaming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 27-year-old deputy carried Aleah to his patrol car. A video  
camera in the dashboard taped her screams and outreached arms 
begging for comfort. It showed Jolley's officer response -- a frisk 
to look for injuries, and a father's instinct to just hug the 
child. 
</P>
<P>
	Aleah was found about 100 feet from the closet where she was  
hiding with her parents and grandparents near Bridge Creek when 
Monday's tornado ripped through. 
</P>
<P>
	Her grandmother died. Her father was badly hurt and in critical  
condition Friday. Her mother and grandfather escaped with bruises 
and cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Aleah suffered a tiny fracture and a cut on her head.  
</P>
<P>
	Jolley, a first-year deputy, was following the twister's path  
when he spotted people wandering on a country road. Robert 
Williams, the baby's grandfather, told Jolley and other searchers 
that he lost his kids. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said they blew right out of the roof,'' Jolley said.  
</P>
<P>
	After Jolley found Aleah, he jumped in his car with her in his  
lap and her head on his chest and went looking for help. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just kept telling her to keep crying,'' he said. About 45  
minutes later, he found help at a makeshift hospital at a school. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a good thing we ran into EMS because I would've kept her,  
we would've gone right home,'' Jolley joked.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Move Higher; Dow Up 65.87 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks moved higher today after a new jobs  
report tempered investors' concerns that the Federal Reserve might 
raise interest rates to cool down the U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
	At 3 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up 65.87 at 11,012.69, just shy of the closing high of 11,014.69 
reached Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mostly higher after seesawing  
earlier in the session. Some strength on technology shares, which 
had been battered for most of this week, lifted the Nasdaq 
composite index. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM, up 6 1/4 to 215 1/2, led the Dow amid new optimism about the  
computer maker. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department reported today that the nation's  
unemployment rate in April was 4.3 percent, only slightly higher 
than the 29-year-low of 4.2 percent reached in March. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the report showed that the U.S. economy created  
234,000 jobs in April after inching up only by 7,000 jobs from the 
March level, which had been the weakest monthly increase in more 
than three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the continuing low unemployment and the steady increase  
in job creation, average hourly wages rose just 0.2 percent in 
April and are up only 3.2 percent over the past 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
	The report came a day after Federal Reserve Chairman Alan  
Greenspan warned that labor shortages and rising wages could lead 
to rising inflation and higher interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan's comments made investors uneasy. They are  
increasingly nervous that the robust economy will prompt the Fed to 
push rates higher when its policy writers meet in two weeks. Higher 
rates are the market's nemesis because they can quickly eat into 
corporate earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold stocks fell today amid a steep drop in gold prices after  
the British Treasury announced plans to sell 125 tons of gold this 
financial year. Barrick Gold was off 2 11/16 at 20 9/16 on the New 
York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a narrow margin on the  
NYSE, where volume came to 652.06 million shares, down from 696.32 
million shares at the same time Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 11.29 at 1,343.34, and  
the Nasdaq composite index was up 27.31 at 2,499.59. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was up 4.35 at 640.57, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index was down 1.88 at 785.93.

<HEADLINE> Jury Weighs Julie Hiatt Steele Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) -- Jurors today deliberated the fate of a  
Virginia woman charged with obstructing Kenneth Starr's 
investigation of President Clinton after prosecutors closed their 
case by using Julie Hiatt Steele's own words against her. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele is accused of lying in statements that undercut the  
credibility of former White House employee Kathleen Willey's 
allegation of an unwanted sexual advance by President Clinton. Ms. 
Steele is charged with three counts of obstructing justice and one 
count of making false statements in an FBI interview. 
</P>
<P>
	After deliberating 3 1/2 hours Thursday, the jury of five men and  
seven women sent the judge a note this morning requesting 
additional information about an exhibit. He didn't provide it. 
</P>
<P>
	In closing arguments, Starr's prosecutors used Ms. Steele's own  
words to make a point they had been unable to elicit from the 
testimony of one of President Clinton's lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton lawyer Mitch Ettinger this week gave what could prove  
helpful testimony to Ms. Steele, refusing to concede the importance 
of an affidavit she signed for the president's lawyers in the Paula 
Jones sexual harassment case against the president. 
</P>
<P>
	Undermining Mrs. Willey's story of an unwanted sexual advance by  
Clinton, Ms. Steele's affidavit said Mrs. Willey got Ms. Steele to 
lie for her to a Newsweek reporter about the Clinton-Willey 
encounter. Starr's office said the affidavit was false and charged 
Ms. Steele with obstructing the Jones case, as well as Starr's 
investigation. Mrs. Willey said she confided the Clinton advance to 
Ms. Steele hours after it allegedly happened in 1993. Ms. Steele's 
affidavit denies that, saying she first learned of the incident in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Is it ``fair to say'' Ms. Steele's affidavit was ``pretty useful  
stuff in the civil case?'' Starr prosecutor David Barger pressed 
Ettinger. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ultimately it was not used'' and ``I can't sit here today and  
say that her affidavit was useful,'' said Ettinger, who turned 
aside repeated efforts by Barger to acknowledge the affidavit was a 
significant document. 
</P>
<P>
	Steele lawyer Andrew Hurst highlighted Ettinger's testimony  
Thursday, telling U.S. District Judge Claude Hilton that Starr must 
make a showing that Ms. Steele obstructed the Jones proceeding, but 
``Ettinger didn't say that.'' In seeking unsuccessfully to dismiss 
the case against Ms. Steele, Hurst characterized Ettinger's 
testimony as saying ``thanks a lot'' for the affidavit ``and tossed 
it in the trash can on his way out the door.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Circumventing Ettinger's unhelpful testimony, Starr prosecutor  
Stephen Binhak in closing arguments pulled out Ms. Steele's own 
grand jury testimony as the jury in her criminal trial prepared to 
begin deliberating Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Last June to Starr's grand jury, Ms. Steele stressed she  
understood the implications of signing the affidavit, testifying 
the document was to be used in the Jones case ``to refute Kathleen 
Willey's testimony'' and ``in an arena where it counted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt I had a moral responsibility to tell the truth where it  
counted and that's why I provided it and that was its intended 
use,'' Ms. Steele testified. 
</P>
<P>
	To prove their case, prosecutors must not only demonstrate that  
Ms. Steele's affidavit was false, but that it was important to the 
Jones case. Mrs. Jones's lawyers were trying to use Mrs. Willey to 
prove a pattern of sexual harassment by Clinton with employees. 
Mrs. Willey was a White House volunteer. 
</P>
<P>
	Hilton said he found the prosecutors' evidence sufficient to  
proceed with the Steele case, which concluded a few minutes later 
with Ms. Steele's lawyers deciding not to put on any witnesses.

<HEADLINE> NBA Ref Pleads Guilty in Tax Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Blaine Reichelt, an NBA referee, pleaded  
guilty Friday to tax evasion charges and faces jail time along with 
paying off back taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Reichelt, 48, pleaded guilty before U.S. District Judge David  
Dowd to failing to report travel income for 1992. According to the 
indictment, Reichelt, of Melbourne, Fla., filed false tax forms 
from 1989 to 1994 and failed to show thousands of dollars worth of 
income from trading in airline tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	The 18-year veteran of the NBA was one of the referees charged  
with exchanging first-class tickets issued by the NBA for coach 
tickets and keeping the difference without reporting the extra 
income. 
</P>
<P>
	Reichelt faces up to nine months in prison, and will have to pay  
back taxes and court costs. Two other charges against him were 
dropped. 
</P>
<P>
	Dowd set Reichelt's sentencing for June 10 in Fort Myers, Fla.  
</P>
<P>
	Court records show Reichelt reported nearly $142,000 income in  
1992, the same year he failed to pay about $9,000 in taxes for the 
undeclared income. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wants to get on with his life,'' said Harrison Slaughter,  
Reichelt's lawyer. ``He wants to work with the government and not 
be an enemy of the government.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Howard Pearl, general counsel for the National Basketball  
Referees Union, said Reichelt was expected to resign Monday. He 
would be eligible to reapply for his job in six months, Pearl said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten NBA referees pleaded guilty to tax fraud charges following  
an investigation by the Internal Revenue Service. Eight others have 
been sentenced to probation or short periods of house arrest and 
ordered to pay back taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Javie was acquitted in January by a Philadelphia jury.

<HEADLINE> Verdict Reached in Jenny Jones Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- A jury mulling the evidence in a lawsuit  
against ``The Jenny Jones Show'' over the death of a gay guest has 
reached a verdict, which was expected to be read late this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury began its deliberations Thursday by asking for the  
testimony of Jenny Jones herself. 
</P>
<P>
	And it watched the taped episode showing Scott Amedure talking  
about a sexual fantasy involving Jonathan Schmitz and Schmitz's 
reaction when the fantasy is shown to him -- he buries his face in 
his hands. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury began deliberating about 9:45 a.m. Thursday after  
Oakland County Circuit Judge Gene Schnelz read the instructions 
meant to guide them. The jury met until 4:30 p.m., then left for 
the day. The jury met for less than two hours this morning before 
telling the judge it had reached a verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney Geoffrey Fieger, who represents Amedure's family, asked  
the jury to find the show and its corporate owner, Warner Bros., 
liable for Amedure's death and award his family $71.5 million. 
Warner Bros. contends only Schmitz was responsible for Amedure's 
death. 
</P>
<P>
	Amedure, who was 32, died in March 1995, three days after  
revealing a secret crush on Schmitz during a taping of the show. 
Amedure's family contends a mentally ill Schmitz was lured onto the 
show believing he would meet a woman, and was humiliated into 
murder when his secret admirer turned out to be Amedure. 
</P>
<P>
	After the taping, Schmitz -- who has said he is heterosexual --  
bought a shotgun, drove to Amedure's trailer in Oakland County's 
Orion Township and shot him twice in the chest. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for Warner Bros. say Schmitz was told his secret admirer  
could be a man or woman, and the show played no role in Amedure's 
death. They also contend Schmitz might have killed Amedure because 
the two had a sexual encounter, a charge Fieger denied. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmitz was found guilty of murder in 1996, but his conviction  
was thrown out on appeal. His retrial is set for Aug. 19; because 
of that trial, he was allowed to plead the Fifth Amendment to 
questions in the civil trial. 
</P>
<P>
	After a couple of hours of deliberations Thursday, the jury  
asked to see the testimony of four witnesses: Ms. Jones, two of the 
show's producers and Donna Riley, a mutual friend of the gay man 
and his killer who appeared on the show with them. Oakland County 
Circuit Judge Gene Schnelz asked them to rely on their memories, 
and then repeat their request if they disagreed about a point. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight of nine jurors have to agree to reach a verdict. In their  
instructions, the jurors were told to find for the Amedures if they 
believed the show was negligent and its negligent behavior was one 
of the causes of Amedure's death. They also were to consider a list 
of duties the show owed Amedure, including protecting him from 
foreseeable harm. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike a criminal trial, the Amedure family does not have to  
prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt; instead it has to show 
that the majority of the evidence supports their points.

<HEADLINE> Baby Alive After Ride With Tornado </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICKASHA, Okla. (AP) -- The baby's eyes and ears were caked with  
mud, but she made a wonderful sound for her rescuer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never thought I'd be so happy to hear a baby screaming,''  
Grady County Deputy Robert Jolley, 27, said today. He found 
10-month-old Aleah Crago in the debris at the base of a tree after 
Monday night's tornado. 
</P>
<P>
	The child's grandmother died and her father was critically  
injured in the storm, which killed 41 people in Oklahoma. Her 
mother was hospitalized briefly and Aleah had a small cut on her 
head and some bruises. 
</P>
<P>
	Mother and daughter are together at a hotel.  
</P>
<P>
	Portions of the baby's rescue were captured on Jolley's video  
camera in his patrol unit. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Williams, the baby's grandfather, told CNN that the  
tornado sucked his daughter, Amy Crago, her husband, Ben Molton, 
and the baby from the closet where they had sought shelter. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams' wife died when a trailer slid into the closet.  
</P>
<P>
	Jolley found Williams searching for the others and then began to  
look for them, and came upon the baby about 100 feet from the 
family home. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was cradled at the base of a tree, her little face in the  
mud,'' Jolley said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw a slight movement and it caught the corner of my eye,''  
Jolley said. The baby, with curly brown hair and dressed in 
overalls and a little T-shirt, was covered in mud and not making 
any noise. 
</P>
<P>
	She began to scream when he picked her up.  
</P>
<P>
	``I was just excited that she was alive,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Jolley had the baby for 45 minutes as he drove around looking  
for a rescue worker to treat her. He drove with the baby in his 
lap, her head on his chest. He talked to her, telling her ``keep 
crying, keep crying'' as he thought about his own 18-month-old 
child, Tia.

<HEADLINE> Lewinsky Might Show Up on `SNL' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Monica Lewinsky may finally be in on the joke  
over at ``Saturday Night Live.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NBC was keeping mum about it, but there were reports that the  
former White House intern will appear as a guest on this week's 
show. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a live show. The only thing I know for sure is that  
Cuba Gooding Jr. is the host and Ricky Martin is the musical 
guest,'' NBC spokesman Marc Liepis said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	If she appears, Ms. Lewinsky would push aside actress Molly  
Shannon, who has frequently portrayed her in skits. There was no 
word on whether John Goodman would reprise his role as Linda Tripp. 
</P>
<P>
	During a skit rehearsal this week, Ms. Lewinsky made jokes about  
dating and phone sex with President William H. Taft, according to 
the Daily News. Taft was president from 1909 to 1913.

<HEADLINE> Hot Response for Budweiser Gay Ads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Anheuser Busch Inc.'s advertisement for Bud  
Light showing two men holding hands has prompted a flood of phone 
calls, forcing the beer maker to set up two hotlines. 
</P>
<P>
	The ad appeared in the April 22 issue of EXP magazine, a free,  
bimonthly St. Louis publication that is geared toward gays and 
lesbians but is distributed in mainstream outlets. The ad tells 
people to ``Be Yourself and Make It a Bud Light.'' It also carries 
a tagline saying ``Proud Sponsor of the St. Louis PrideFest '99.'' 
PrideFest is a gay and lesbian festival held in June. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after the ad ran, leaders in the gay community began  
distributing e-mail, urging people to call Anheuser-Busch in 
support of the ad. The St. Louis brewer was so overwhelmed with 
calls that it set up a hotline for supporters to use. 
</P>
<P>
	Conservative Christian leader Jerry Falwell also found out about  
the ad and sent his followers e-mail, advising them to call 
Anheuser-Busch to ask that a hotline be set up so that they could 
oppose the ad. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's keep the heat on Anheuser-Busch so that they understand  
that pro-family Americans are terribly concerned about homosexual 
images coming into our homes through reckless advertising 
campaigns,'' Falwell wrote in his Falwell Confidential. 
</P>
<P>
	Anheuser-Busch officials declined to comment about the results  
of the calls or whether they will have any effect on further plans 
for the advertisement. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's surprising to us that one print ad placed in select  
gay-oriented magazines has attracted attention,'' the beer maker 
said in a brief statement. ``Today's consumer is not one of a 
specific gender, race, geography or orientation. We appreciate and 
respect the views of all our customers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ad will later appear in other publications that cater to  
gays, lesbians and others with alternative lifestyles.

<HEADLINE> Clippers Will Call Staples Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The NBA Board of Governors have unanimously  
ratified the Los Angeles Clippers' request to play all of their 
home games at the new Staples Center starting next season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clippers have played most of their home games at the Los  
Angeles Sports Arena since moving to Los Angeles from San Diego in 
1984. They have also played 35 home games at the Anaheim Arena 
during the last five seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``While we have truly appreciated all the support Orange County  
fans have shown us (in Anaheim), Staples Center is now our new home 
and will provide all the amenities we have sought to provide our 
fans,'' Clippers executive vice president Andy Roeser said Friday 
in a press release. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Differences on Kosovo Plan Narrowed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With the United States and Russia closing  
ranks on a peacekeeping force for Kosovo, President Clinton said 
today that Western allies should not change their formula for a 
settlement and must neither ``add nor subtract from the basic 
conditions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He suggested that the peacekeeping plan adopted in Bosnia might  
be a model for Kosovo. ``What we did in Bosnia was functional,'' 
the president said. In Bosnia, the command was divided three ways, 
with the United States and Russia in charge of one geographic area, 
Britain in another and France in a third. ``There may be some other 
way to do it in Kosovo,'' Clinton said. ``I don't want to prejudge 
all the details.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president spoke with reporters on the South Lawn as he  
headed out for a day of political fund raising in Texas, followed 
by a visit Saturday to tornado-ravaged Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
	There was a quickening of developments on the diplomatic front.  
</P>
<P>
	U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan arranged to meet here today  
with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on the newly energized 
diplomacy and Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott is flying to 
Moscow for further talks with senior Russian officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said any peace deal must follow the conditions set by  
NATO for the withdrawal of Serb forces, the return of refugees, 
political autonomy for ethnic Albanians and the deployment of an 
international security force led by NATO. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's important for the United States and our allies  
neither to add nor subtract from the basic conditions that we have 
said all along are essential to make this work,'' the president 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Just how far the new diplomatic initiative goes is largely up to  
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, whose preliminary reaction 
was cautious. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that a just solution on all open issues can be  
reached through the political process of direct talks,'' state-run 
Serbian media quoted Milosevic as saying Thursday, without 
elaboration. 
</P>
<P>
	Milosevic also demanded ``an end of the aggression and return of  
peace and return of Yugoslav citizens to their homes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Initially dead set against any international force on Serbian  
territory, Milosevic had already offered to admit some lightly or 
unarmed observers under the United Nations. Eight foreign ministers 
who met Thursday in Bonn, Germany, countered with ``deployment in 
Kosovo of effective international civil and security presences,'' 
which NATO says means a well-armed military force with NATO at its 
core. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no mention of NATO troops in the communique issued by  
the United States, Russia, Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy 
and Japan. But U.S. officials said they would be part of the 
contingent that would shield returning ethnic Albanian refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	Drafting of a U.N. resolution on Kosovo is to begin in the next  
few days for discussion among the eight foreign ministers. That 
process could take weeks, and the resolution would not be submitted 
to the Security Council until there is final agreement between 
Russia and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	On Capitol Hill, Rep. Benjamin A. Gilman, R-N.Y., scheduled a  
hearing of the House International Relations Committee, which he 
chairs, for Thursday. ``We need to be mindful that it is diplomacy 
that will ultimately shape the future of Kosovo and Yugoslavia,'' 
he said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	While awaiting a move from Milosevic, the Pentagon announced  
that Defense Secretary William Cohen ordered as many as 176 more 
Air Force and Marine Corps planes to join the Yugoslav effort. 
</P>
<P>
	The deployment includes 18 more A-10 attack planes, 18  
additional F-16CJ jets, 36 more F-15E planes, 24 more F/A-18 jets 
and up to 80 additional tanker planes. The Hungarian government 
said earlier this week the 24 F/A-18s will be based on its 
territory; the Pentagon has not confirmed that but said eight U.S. 
Air Force refueling planes are scheduled to arrive in Hungary this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you'll find when it's together and announced that we  
will have basically a 360-degree attack capability against 
Yugoslavia,'' Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said Thursday, 
referring to the widening circle of bases from which NATO attack 
planes will launch their missions against Yugoslavia. 

</P>
<P>
	The new peacekeeping plan is designed to win over Milosevic  
while ensuring the tormented ethnic Albanian refugees can return to 
their homes in safety. 
</P>
<P>
	It also could give Russia, China or other U.N. Security Council  
members a say in the troops' mission and possibly limit the weapons 
and force they can employ to protect returned refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, said Thursday  
after a briefing by State Department and Pentagon officials the 
force ``could well not include Americans,'' there seems to be 
little doubt there will be a sizable U.S. contingent, as there is 
helping to keep the peace next door in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
	The 28,000-member force initially planned for Kosovo is now  
considered too small to monitor the postwar resentment that could 
boil over into violence even after most of the Serb troops and 
paramilitary units depart the province. 
</P>
<P>
	The force could expand to 60,000, with a proportionally larger  
U.S. share than the 4,000 considered at the outset. 
</P>
<P>
	That guarantees the Clinton administration will not budge from  
its insistence that the American troops be under the control of 
American commanders. 
</P>
<P>
	Sandy Berger, the president's national security adviser,  
described the security force approved Thursday by the Group of 
Eight foreign ministers as a ``robust presence that would not only 
be able to defend itself but maintain civil order.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Troops from Russia, Ukraine and other countries friendly to  
Yugoslavia are likely to be included, and possibly from such NATO 
nations as Greece and Portugal, which have not actively engaged in 
the 6-week-old NATO attacks on the Serbs.

<HEADLINE> NL Umpire `Heartened' by Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Just 11 weeks after quintuple bypass surgery, NL umpire Wally  
Bell returned to work Friday night when the Atlanta Braves played 
at San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	Stationed at second base, he had a play right away, calling out  
Atlanta's Andruw Jones on a steal attempt in the first inning. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just to be able to be here is more exciting, just working with  
the guys,'' Bell said after the Padres' 4-3 victory. ``It's fun to 
get back. It felt good out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Plate umpire Mark Hirschbeck took the first ball out of play,  
and planned to have all the umps sign it before presenting the 
souvenir to Bell. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell, 34, was only 2 1/2 weeks away from leaving for spring  
training when his heart problem was detected. 
</P>
<P>
	``The doctors said that if I had gone to spring training and  
worked in the heat, I might've checked out,'' Bell said last week. 
``Dead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bell had surgery on Feb. 18 near his home in Boardman, Ohio.  
Doctors told him genetics were a major cause of his trouble, 
although an umpire's lifestyle of constant travel, late meals and 
stressful conditions also contributed. 
</P>
<P>
	Bypass patients often take about 3 1/2 months to get back to work.  
Bell changed his diet, stuck to his rehabilitation plan and was 
able to return ahead of schedule -- cleared by his doctors, of 
course. 
</P>
<P>
	``I worked hard at this,'' Bell, who sports an 8-inch scar down  
the middle of his chest, said before the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Plus, he added, there was the support of ``my two families.'' It  
came from his wife, Vickie -- expecting their first child in August 
-- and his relatives, along with encouragement from all the umpires. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell worked with crew chief Bruce Froemming, Hunter Wendelstedt  
and Hirschbeck in his first game back. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the day, Bell played golf with his partners. Later,  
he went with Froemming and Hirschbeck to talk baseball with kids. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be great to see him out there,'' Hirschbeck said  
before the game. ``Sure, you'll watch him the first couple of times 
he runs, that's natural. But the anxiety, the nervousness, that 
will all go away after the first couple of days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said Froemming: ``You certainly don't think of something like  
that happening to a person as young as Wally is. It's always nice 
to see someone come back from that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bell is in his seventh year on the NL staff. He was originally  
supposed to work his first game this season on April 5, the Randy 
Johnson vs. Kevin Brown matchup at Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	He watched part of that game from his living room, knowing he  
was not yet ready. Now, he's prepared to return, both physically 
and mentally. 
</P>
<P>
	As in, he's set for the booing from fans, the complaining by  
players and managers -- and the razzing by his fellow umps. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad he's back because I need someone I can beat in  
backgammon and golf,'' Hirschbeck said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hey, it's like opening day for him,'' Froemming said. ``We've  
all been out here working.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Calls for 'Safe Childhoods' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton turned his attention today  
from the air war against Yugoslavia to politics and problems at 
home, calling for a national campaign to reduce teen violence and 
``give our children the safe childhoods they deserve.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Back from a two-day trip to Europe, he said that reducing  
violence among young people will require the same kind of sustained 
national efforts that have lowered teen pregnancy and helped 
400,000 people from the welfare rolls into jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	The president spoke with reporters on the South Lawn as he set  
out for Houston and Austin to raise $700,000 from Democrats in 
Texas, a state whose Republican governor hopes to follow him to the 
White House. On Saturday, he will visit tornado-ravaged Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Clinton will preside over a White House conference  
called after the school shootings in Littleton, Colo. The president 
said it would be a strategy session seeking the best ideas ``from 
people who can really make a difference: parents and young people, 
teachers and religious leaders, law enforcement, gun manufacturers, 
representatives of the entertainment industry and those of us here 
in government. 
</P>
<P>
	``Together we will talk about how we can shield children from  
gratuitous violence, keep parents involved in their children's 
lives, reach out to troubled young people early enough and do more 
to keep guns out of their reach,'' the president said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will not ask who takes the blame but how we can all take  
responsibility,'' he said. ``And I will challenge everyone there 
and everyone in America to do their part.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president was to speak at a lunch in a fashionable Houston  
restaurant where the minimum donation was $20,000 a couple. 
Expected tally: $450,000. 
</P>
<P>
	At an evening outdoor fiesta at a private home in Austin, the  
Democrats expected $250,000 in contributions from some 125 guests 
paying a minimum of $1,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president is a popular fund-raiser and is looking forward  
to being with our friends and supporters in Texas,'' said Peter 
Kaufman, a party spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, Clinton plans to shift gears again, moving on to  
Oklahoma to view the devastation left in the state by furious 
tornadoes. 
</P>
<P>
	In Europe, Clinton got reports on the NATO bombing of  
Yugoslavia, offered thanks to U.S. pilots flying missions over the 
Balkan nation and met in Germany with ethnic Albanians who have 
fled Serbian ethnic cleansing in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there is a real peace process under way,'' Clinton  
said during a stop in Bonn for a meeting with German Chancellor 
Gerhard Schroeder. ``But it has no chance of reaching a 
satisfactory conclusion unless we maintain allied unity and 
firmness.''

<HEADLINE> Water Balloon Cuts Short 'N Sync PA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BLOOMINGTON, Minn. (AP) -- A water balloon didn't mix well with  
about 20,000 screaming teen-agers and the pop group 'N Sync. 
</P>
<P>
	The nearly all-girl mob wept, Beatlemania style, before and  
after the band walked out of a Mall of America autograph-signing 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	A water balloon thrown from a balcony spooked the band's  
security staff, so they cut the visit short by a half-hour. No one 
was hurt and the water-bomber wasn't caught. 
</P>
<P>
	It happened only hours before a sold-out show by the group,  
whose debut album has sold more than 2 million copies.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon: Captured Troops Had Guns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The three U.S. soldiers released from prison  
in Yugoslavia last weekend were armed with a .50-caliber machine 
gun at the time of their capture March 31 but did not fire, the 
Pentagon says. 
</P>
<P>
	The soldiers also were armed with one M-16 rifle and two  
unspecified side arms but were outnumbered by the Yugoslav soldiers 
who surrounded and captured them, Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon 
said Thursday in releasing the first substantive details of the 
circumstances of their capture. 
</P>
<P>
	The three were on a training mission near the  
Macedonia-Yugoslavia border in a Humvee scout vehicle and, for 
reasons that Bacon left for the Army to explain later, had not 
linked up with the two other vehicles in their platoon when they 
were ``abducted'' by Serb forces. 
</P>
<P>
	``When they were surrounded and captured, they were pulled from  
their Humvee and they were kicked, punched and hit with rifle butts 
and treated extremely roughly,'' Bacon said. ``This was the time 
when they incurred the majority of their injuries. There were also 
periods of harsh treatment during interrogation in the several days 
following after their capture, but we believe the bulk of their 
injuries were sustained in the early moments of the captivity.'' He 
gave no details of the harsh prison treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Bacon also said the Army has concluded ``beyond a shadow of a  
doubt'' that the three soldiers were on the Macedonian side of the 
border when they were captured, not on the Yugoslav side as the 
Yugoslav authorities claimed. He said their captors were armed and 
wore the uniforms of the Yugoslav army. 
</P>
<P>
	The Army's investigation found that one of the three Americans  
was manning the .50-caliber machine gun on their Humvee when they 
encountered the Serbs. The machine gun apparently had ammunition 
but was not in position to fire, Bacon said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was not ready to go because typically when you drive around  
you don't have the thing ready to fire,'' he said. The soldier 
manning the machine gun ``followed the normal rule of getting out 
of the line of fire so he wouldn't be shot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They were taken by a substantially larger force,'' Bacon said.  
``I don't know how much larger, but they felt that they didn't have 
any alternative but to stop. And in fact, as they tried to get out, 
they ran into an obstacle which I believe was a ditch, which also 
made it difficult for them to get away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. government has maintained that the soldiers were  
illegally taken since they were not involved in the NATO air 
campaign against Yugoslavia. They were part of a U.N. peacekeeping 
force based in Skopje, Macedonia. 
</P>
<P>
	Bacon said the Army would soon release additional details on the  
circumstances of the men's capture. Reporters at the Pentagon asked 
him why the soldiers had been alone so close to the Yugoslav 
border. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were supposed to reconstitute into their three-vehicle  
platoon or convoy before leaving, and this one did not come back to 
the place where they were supposed to reconstitute,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were actually training to avoid the type of situation in  
which they were caught,'' Bacon added. 
</P>
<P>
	The three, are Staff Sgt. Christopher J. Stone, 25, of Smiths  
Creek, Mich.; Staff Sgt. Andrew A. Ramirez, 24, of Los Angeles, and 
Spc. Steven M. Gonzales, 21, of Huntsville, Texas. They met with 
President Clinton on Wednesday and attended an honors ceremony 
Thursday at their 1st Infantry Division headquarters in Wuerzburg, 
Germany. They were awarded the Purple Heart for injuries received 
in captivity, the Army Commendation Medal, the Prisoner of War 
Medal, the Armed Forces Medal, the United Nations Medal, and the 
NATO Medal. 
</P>
<P>
	The three headed for their homes in the United States today,  
accompanied by their families on separate flights from Frankfurt, 
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	When examined by doctors after their release on Sunday, Ramirez  
was found to have a stitched-up wound on the top of his head and 
two fractured ribs, as well as swelling of his lower right leg. His 
injuries have begun to heal and no surgery is planned. 
</P>
<P>
	Stone was found to have a broken nose, plus bruises, a chipped  
tooth and abrasions on his face. Military doctors said Gonzales 
sustained a chipped tooth and abrasions on his wrists, presumably 
from handcuffs.

<HEADLINE> NHL Playoffs Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The Boston Bruins heard the question over and over  
again: How could they ever score against Buffalo's Dominik Hasek, 
the best goalie in the NHL? 
</P>
<P>
	After all, he won the league's last two MVP awards, led the  
Czech Republic to the Olympic gold medal last year and was tops in 
the NHL in save percentage this season. 
</P>
<P>
	But after Boston's 4-2 win in Thursday night's opener of its  
second-round Eastern Conference playoff series, the Sabres face a 
similar question: How can they score enough against Bruins goalie 
Byron Dafoe to win Game 2 on Sunday? 
</P>
<P>
	``We have one of the best goalies in the league, too,'' said  
Jason Allison, whose shot off Hasek's left shoulder gave Boston a 
1-0 lead in the first period. ``I think they pretty much equal each 
other out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in the NHL playoffs, Dallas beat St. Louis 3-0 in a  
Western Conference semifinal opener. 
</P>
<P>
	The playoffs continue tonight with Pittsburgh opening at Toronto  
in the East and Detroit at Colorado in the West. 
</P>
<P>
	Dafoe led the league with 10 shutouts. Hasek was second with  
nine. Hasek also was second with a 1.87 goals-against average. 
Dafoe was third at 1.99. 
</P>
<P>
	And both were on a roll.  
</P>
<P>
	Hasek won four straight games in Buffalo's 4-0 sweep of Ottawa,  
while Dafoe won his previous three in Boston's 4-2 first-round 
victory over Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	``I came in the league with Dafoe. He continues to get better  
and better,'' Buffalo's Jason Woolley said. ``He has a little bit 
of Dom in him the way he is so acrobatic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he doesn't have the same pressure to live up to expectations  
since his reputation isn't as impressive as Hasek's. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's human. He's going to let goals in,'' Bruins coach Pat  
Burns said of Hasek. ``Everybody seems to be surprised when we 
score. I'm not surprised.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Allison's first playoff goal, on a power play at 13:59 of the  
first period, was the only one Hasek could reasonably be expected 
to stop since he had a good view of the shot. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't think they had too many goal-scoring chances,'' Hasek  
said. ``We were always one or two goals behind and it's tough to 
come back from a deficit like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The second Boston goal came when no one boxed out Dmitri  
Khristich, who scored at 15:21 of the second period after taking a 
pass across the crease. Alexei Zhitnik made the score 2-1 at 18:19, 
but Joe Thornton restored the Bruins' two-goal lead when he got in 
front of Hasek and deflected Ray Bourque's 50-foot shot. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thornton jumps in the air, it hits his stick and goes in the  
net. That can go in any direction,'' Buffalo coach Lindy Ruff said. 
</P>
<P>
	Woolley made the score 3-2 at 9:37 of the third period with a  
50-foot shot, and Buffalo kept the pressure on the rest of the way. 
But with Hasek out for an extra skater, Khristich scored into an 
empty net with 12 seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a very important game psychologically for us, to know  
we can get three goals on him,'' Dafoe said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the Bruins learned a lesson that could come in handy in  
Game 2 of the best-of-7 series on Sunday: Don't sit on a lead. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't afford to blow a game when you're up two goals like  
that and we were flirting with that,'' Allison said. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston scored on two of its five power plays and on two of its  
four shots in the second period. And it faced a team that hadn't 
played a game the previous eight days and was missing top goal 
scorer Miroslav Satan with an ankle injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``It takes a while for the engines to get going,'' Buffalo  
captain Mike Peca said. 
</P>
<P>
	Scoring first was significant against a stingy goalie like  
Hasek. Boston's third goal was critical, since it came just 1:27 
after Buffalo broke Dafoe's shutout streak at 134 minutes, 49 
seconds and sent Boston into the second intermission leading 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was huge,'' Bourque said.  
</P>
<P>
	But despite beating Hasek three times, the Bruins expect him to  
be very tough on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's the best goaltender in the world,'' Thornton said. ``If  
you're not thinking about him, I think you're a little bit 
crazy.'' 
</P>
<P>
                          *Stars 3, Blues 0    	
</P>
<P>
	Brett Hull and Pat Verbeek scored their first goals of the  
playoffs and Ed Belfour stopped 23 shots as Dallas beat visiting 
St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	Belfour earned his fifth shutout and 50th career playoff victory  
by shutting down the Blues, just off an exhausting seven-game 
series with Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	Verbeek, who missed the first-round Edmonton series because of a  
knee injury, scored a first-period goal in his return. Hull scored 
49 seconds into the second period and Mike Modano scored in the 
third for the Stars, who had the best record in the NHL this 
season.

<HEADLINE> Fewer Criminal Paying Restitution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal offender's chances of being ordered  
to pay restitution varies widely depending on where the case is 
heard, congressional investigators say. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, the portion of offenders ordered to pay restitution  
ranged from 3 percent to 49 percent depending on which judicial 
district handled the case, according to a study by the General 
Accounting Office. The percentage of convicts ordered to pay fines 
varied from 1 percent to 84 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``For example, offenders convicted of fraud in the Eastern  
District of Pennsylvania, which includes Philadelphia, were 13 more 
times likely to be ordered to pay a fine and three times more 
likely to be ordered to pay restitution than fraud offenders in the 
Eastern District of New York, which includes Brooklyn,'' Richard 
Stana, GAO's associate director for administration of justice 
issues, told a House subcommittee Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	People convicted of drug trafficking crimes in the Western  
District of Texas were 99 times more likely to fined than people 
convicted of the same offense in the Central District of 
California, which includes Los Angeles, the GAO report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Furthermore, the percentage of convicts ordered to pay  
restitution has dropped since Congress enacted a 1996 law imposing 
mandatory restitution in certain federal cases, and officials don't 
know why. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's counterintuitive. It's puzzling,'' Stana said.  
</P>
<P>
	For the first seven months of the 1997 fiscal year -- before the  
law took effect at the end of April -- 26 percent of federal 
offenders were ordered to pay restitution, the GAO found. For the 
rest of that fiscal year, ending Sept. 30, only 12 percent of the 
offenders got such orders. 
</P>
<P>
	The likelihood of an offender's being ordered to pay restitution  
for a robbery increased by almost half, Stana said. But the 
likelihood for a larceny offense decreased by almost half. For a 
fraud conviction, the likelihood decreased slightly, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The report finds that victims in certain federal districts are  
far more likely to be compensated for their losses than victims of 
the same crime in other districts,'' said Rep. Bill McCollum, 
R-Fla., subcommittee chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	Other factors affecting the numbers were the sex, race and  
citizenship of the offender as well as educational levels, length 
of sentence and whether the sentence involved a prison term, 
probation or an alternative. 
</P>
<P>
	The GAO study did not examine whether fines or restitution  
ordered actually were paid. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors and court administrators told the GAO that some of  
the differences can be attributed to the type and nature of the 
offenses and differing court management cultures. They also told 
the GAO that it likely still was too early to gauge the effect of 
the law, since officials and prosecutors probably still need time 
to become familiar with it. 
</P>
<P>
	People convicted of a federal crime can be ordered to pay a fine  
or restitution at sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mandatory Victims Restitution Act changed restitution law by  
requiring judges to order full restitution to each victim in 
certain cases -- those involving crimes of violence, some property 
offenses, tampering with consumers products, and offenses involving 
fraud or deceit, for example.

<HEADLINE> Henderson Placed on Disabled List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- The New York Mets placed Rickey Henderson,  
bothered by a sprained right knee, on the disabled list after 
Friday night's 14-7 loss to the Arizona Diamondbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	The 40-year-old outfielder hasn't played since the injury last  
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's not progressing as much as we would like,'' Mets general  
manager Steve Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson must sit out 15 days retroactive to his last  
appearance. That means he would be eligible to return to play on 
May 17, when the Mets play Milwaukee to start a seven-game 
homestand. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets recalled left-handed pitcher Rigo Beltran from Triple-A  
Norfolk to fill Henderson's roster spot. 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson, baseball's career steals leader, has reached base in  
19 of his first 20 games for the Mets. But he was just 2-for-17 in 
New York's just-completed home stand. 
</P>
<P>
	Going into Friday night's game, Henderson was eighth in the NL  
with a .437 on-base percentage.

<HEADLINE> Sierra Leone Rebels Nix Cease-Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) -- Sierra Leone's guerrilla leader  
rejected government conditions for a cease-fire Friday but pledged 
to continue the peace process, even amid intense fighting. 
</P>
<P>
	Foday Sankoh, who is in Togo meeting with other senior leaders  
of his Revolutionary United Front, told The Associated Press he 
will draft a peace proposal over the weekend and present it to 
Sierra Leone's government. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the will of God Almighty, we will be talking peace  
soon,'' Sankoh said in a telephone interview from his hotel room in 
the Togolese capital, Lome. 
</P>
<P>
	A senior government official in Sierra Leone's capital,  
Freetown, said Friday that a government delegation could arrive in 
Togo for peace talks as early as the middle of next week. The 
official, who requested anonymity, said peace talks will take place 
with six representatives from each side -- even without a 
cease-fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Sankoh laughed when asked about the demands of Sierra Leone  
President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah that the rebels vacate the highways 
and diamond mines they control before talks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We won't discuss retreating from anywhere before we even get  
to the negotiating table,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	His forces would allow civilian and humanitarian agency vehicles  
to travel freely on roads they control, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sankoh has called for a cease-fire to smooth the beginning of  
talks meant to end the war. 
</P>
<P>
	Sierra Leone's government, witnesses and human rights groups say  
the rebels have killed thousands of civilians and maimed many more 
-- often chopping off arms, legs, or ears with machetes -- in their 
war to oust Kabbah. 
</P>
<P>
	The rebels deny committing atrocities and accuse Kabbah's  
government of corruption and human rights abuses. 
</P>
<P>
	In a goodwill gesture last month, Kabbah allowed Sankoh, who was  
imprisoned two years ago and sentenced to death for treason last 
October, to attend meetings with his rebel group in Togo before 
peace talks. 
</P>
<P>
	Sankoh acknowledged that an offensive by ECOMOG, the West  
African intervention force backing the government, has pushed 
rebels out of some positions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh, let them gain ground,'' he said. ``We want to talk more  
about peace right now. But don't worry, we are strong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sankoh said he accepted the government's call for U.N. monitors  
to enforce or observe any cease-fire or peace agreement between the 
two sides. 
</P>
<P>
	He refused to list the main points of the rebels' peace  
proposal. But rebel spokesman Omraie Golley indicated earlier that 
the rebels would require a withdrawal of Nigerian troops from 
ECOMOG, possibly to be replaced by troops from a neutral nation. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said the rebels would want a power-sharing agreement  
with the government and a say in the constitution of a new Sierra 
Leonean army.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Defector Hides in Bushes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HIALEAH, Fla. (AP) -- Cuban baseball coach Rigoberto Betancourt  
Herrera says he slipped out of his Baltimore hotel in the middle of 
the night and hid in the bushes for seven hours before walking into 
a police station and defecting to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``In Cuba the situation is precarious,'' Betancourt Herrera, the  
Cuban national team's 54-year-old pitching coach, said in an 
interview Friday, three days after his defection. ``Life is 
difficult -- getting transportation, housing and even medication. 
Here I have family. I decided to start a whole new life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The former Cuban pitching star said that it was only after he  
had arrived in America for a game against the Baltimore Orioles 
that he decided for certain to skip the flight home to Havana and 
defect, leaving behind his wife and four children. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've wanted to leave for a while but just didn't have the  
opportunity,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cubans defeated the Orioles 12-6 Monday night. Betancourt  
Herrera said he had planned to walk out of Camden Yards after the 
game along with the thousands of fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was going to leave just like a normal person. But I realized  
I couldn't do it after the game,'' he said. ``I left my passport 
and other papers at the hotel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His escape plans were nearly foiled again. When the team arrived  
at the Sheraton hotel that night, they were told they had just a 
half-hour to get their things together for the flight home, 
Betancourt Herrera said. 
</P>
<P>
	Around 2 a.m., he said, he grabbed his bag and walked outside --  
pretending he was just going out for a smoke -- and kept on walking. 
Fearing the police might think he was homeless and arrest him, 
Betancourt Herrera hid in the bushes at a park nearby for about 
seven hours, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	At about 10 a.m., he walked into the downtown Baltimore police  
headquarters and asked for asylum. 
</P>
<P>
	He is now staying with two aunts in Hialeah, a mostly Hispanic  
community near Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Betancourt Herrera said he doesn't regret leaving his family and  
life behind. He said his next step is to assure his stay in the 
United States and try to bring wife and their children, ages 7 to 
29, to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll be lonely here,'' he said. ``Life alone here makes one  
nostalgic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball agent Joe Cubas, who represents Cuban pitcher Orlando  
``El Duque'' Hernandez of the New York Yankees, vowed to help get 
the man called ``el Pequeno Gigante del Box'' -- Little Big Man in 
the Box -- a job in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	Betancourt Herrera played Cuban baseball from 1965 to 1975 and  
was known for an excellent curveball. He was part of the national 
team three times. He most recently worked as a pitching trainer in 
a Cuban province, earning $250 a month. 
</P>
<P>
	Six other Cubans who had traveled to Baltimore with the  
300-member Cuban delegation for the game missed the flight home but 
were said to have overslept and have since returned to Cuba.

<HEADLINE>  Bombs Hit Yugoslav Hospital Complex </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NIS, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Slavica Dinic was taking a nap with her  
daughter. Dozens were shopping in a local vegetable market. Others 
were at a hospital at noon Friday when bombs started hitting 
residential areas of Nis. 
</P>
<P>
	Cluster bombs, presumably from NATO, struck next to a hospital  
complex and near a market, bringing death and destruction, 
peppering the streets with shrapnel and littering the courtyards 
with their yellow casings. 
</P>
<P>
	In a street leading from the market, dismembered bodies were  
strewn among carrots and other vegetables in pools of blood. A dead 
woman, her body covered with a sheet, was still clutching a 
shopping bag with intact carrots. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 15 people died and 60 others were wounded, said Dr.  
Petar Bosnjakovic, deputy director of the clinical center at the 
Nis hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Journalists escorted by Serbian authorities were taken to Nis,  
an industrial city about 120 miles southeast of the capital 
Belgrade, to view the devastation. 
</P>
<P>
	The city has been targeted by NATO before -- mostly attacks that  
struck the industrial zone at night. Nothing prepared people for 
the bombs that fell just before noon on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Houses and cars were destroyed on Aneta Andrejevic street, near  
the vegetable market. The buildings were pockmarked from the 
cluster bombs, which release explosives that then explode again. 
More bombs lay unexploded on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
	Just across the street from the dead woman's body, a stream of  
blood trickled away from the body of a young man who had been blown 
to pieces. 
</P>
<P>
	``When it began we rushed to the cellar,'' said 70-year-old  
Smilja Juric. ``People were screaming afterwards. One wounded man 
was in my backyard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One house on Sumatovacka street, near Nis University, was  
completely burned. Dozens had their windows blown out. Several cars 
were destroyed. Glass and debris littered the area. 
</P>
<P>
	Around the corner Dinic, 30, and her daughter were asleep after  
a restless night of air strikes when bombs also hit Nis. 
</P>
<P>
	``We ducked for cover under the bed. One bomb fell through the  
roof of the upper floor of our house, but my family is unharmed,'' 
she said. Her husband was away at work. 
</P>
<P>
	Bombs exploded at a parking lot next to a local hospital,  
incinerating a dozen cars and smashing the windows of the entrance 
to the pathology building. 
</P>
<P>
	Three people were killed near the hospital, three others died  
later of their injuries. The other nine were close to the market. 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslav officials were enraged.  
</P>
<P>
	``NATO is carrying out daytime attacks. That is Western  
democracy for you. This is a residential area,'' said Jovan Zlatic, 
the head of Nis county. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO said it struck the Nis airport in two rounds of attacks  
before dawn Friday. The alliance also reported ``substantial 
strikes'' in Nis, but would not confirm hitting the center of the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
	Standing in front of the hospital, Serbian Deputy Premier  
Milovan Bojic questioned whether NATO really wanted peace, 
attacking in the wake of Thursday's agreement between Russia and 
the West on the broad outline for a settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Are steps to peace made by causing so many victims? This is  
not an accidental mistake of the NATO air force. This is an 
intentional act to destroy a nation, an act of genocide,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Medosevac, a village a little more than a mile from Nis, a  
pre-dawn raid left a large crater in the road. Resident Zagorka 
Krstic said 30 houses were destroyed. Thirteen were reduced to 
piles of debris. 
</P>
<P>
	Power lines were destroyed. Twisted electrical cables were  
scattered about. Pieces of furniture were trapped under the rubble. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was in Nis baby-sitting my granddaughter,'' said Radmila  
Mitrovic, 59, sitting in the rubble of her demolished home. ``If I 
was here, I would be dead. I lost everything.''

<HEADLINE> Owners Say Royals Bid Group Too Big </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- First, Miles Prentice was told he had to  
raise $75 million to purchase the Kansas City Royals. 
</P>
<P>
	He did.  
</P>
<P>
	Then the Royals' board of directors told him more than half the  
money had to be raised among Kansas Citians. 
</P>
<P>
	It was.  
</P>
<P>
	Now the New York lawyer who has dreamed all his life of owning a  
major league baseball team faces a new obstacle. Owners are not 
going to approve his $75 million bid to purchase the Royals in its 
present form, a high-ranking baseball official has told The 
Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Prentice, who has pursued the team for almost two years, will be  
asked to reform his group with fewer investors, the official said, 
speaking on the condition he not be identified. 
</P>
<P>
	The Prentice group numbers between 40 and 50 and includes some  
of Kansas City's most prominent families as well as some of its 
most famous citizens, including golfer Tom Watson and Negro Leagues 
baseball star Buck O'Neil. 
</P>
<P>
	The official said it is highly unlikely the issue will be put to  
a vote when owners meet in Pittsburgh on June 9-10. Baseball has 
expressed a preference for smaller ownership groups, claiming 
larger partnerships are unwieldy and difficult to deal with. 
</P>
<P>
	Another baseball official, also speaking on the condition of  
anonymity, said baseball is concerned the group may not have enough 
capital to operate the team successfully and may need to raise more 
money. Baseball's lawyers and accountants are still doing their 
investigation of the proposed group and its finances. 
</P>
<P>
	It is possible baseball might ask the primary investors to  
contribute more, both officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, at a news conference Thursday night, Prentice continued  
to display the optimism he has shown throughout the sale process. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there's one thing I hope you've come to expect of me, it's  
persistence,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	And Gene Budig, president of the American League, said the  
report that Prentice's bid would be turned down is erroneous. 
</P>
<P>
	``The staff of the commissioner's office is still at work on the  
Kansas City matter,'' Budig said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prentice was given approval by the Royals board of directors  
last November after meeting the board's minimum price of $75 
million and fulfilling its late demand that more than 50 percent of 
the money be raised in Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
	Prentice seemed surprised to hear the group would not be  
approved in its current form. 
</P>
<P>
	``From day one, we've believed in the integrity of the  
process,'' Prentice said. ``The Royals' board made a decision. They 
wanted 50 percent of the equity to be from Kansas City, and we had 
to do certain things to satisfy the board requirements. The board 
made a decision and carefully considered that our group had not 
only the best fitness but was the best for Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe the owners will use the same considered judgment and  
come to a decision that supports what the Royals board has 
recommended.'' Prentice also said he had not heard any previous 
indications that his group would not be approved in its current 
form. 
</P>
<P>
	Prentice defended the size of his group as a strength.  
</P>
<P>
	``I am thankful and proud to be part of this group,'' he said.  
``This group includes two women ... we will be the first ownership 
group with two African-American members, and we have a 
Japanese-American. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the long run, the size of our group and the composition of  
our group, will be the strength of our group.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioner Bud Selig did not return telephone calls seeking  
comment on Thursday. Royals president Mike Herman said he'd had no 
indications the bid was in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	The Royals have been in ownership limbo since the death in 1993  
of founder Ewing Kauffman, who willed the franchise to a charitable 
trust that eventually will receive all proceeds of the sale. 
</P>
<P>
	The board, worried that the money-losing Royals might eventually  
leave Kansas City, approved Prentice's bid only after failing to 
interest any local buyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Only two other groups took part in the bidding process, and  
several sources, also speaking on the condition of anonymity, said 
neither came close to the $75 million figure. One was headed by 
former Royals star George Brett -- a team vice president -- and the 
other was a partnership between Lamar Hunt, owner of the Kansas 
City Chiefs, and Western Resources Inc., a local utility giant. 
</P>
<P>
	Prentice declined to say exactly how many investors his group  
contains, or what the minimum investment was. 
</P>
<P>
	``We required seven figures,'' he said. ``I'm not permitted even  
to discuss some of this stuff with my owners until major league 
baseball approves.''

later of their injuries. The other nine were close to the market.

<P>
	Yugoslav officials were enraged.

<P>
	``NATO is carrying out daytime attacks. That is Western  
democracy for you. This is a residential area,'' said Jovan Zlatic, 
the head of Nis county. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO said it struck the Nis airport in two rounds of attacks  
before dawn Friday. The alliance also reported ``substantial 
strikes'' in Nis, but would not confirm hitting the center of the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
	Standing in front of the hospital, Serbian Deputy Premier  
Milovan Bojic questioned whether NATO really wanted peace, 
attacking in the wake of Thursday's agreement between Russia and 
the West on the broad outline for a settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Are steps to peace made by causing so many victims? This is  
not an accidental mistake of the NATO air force. This is an 
intentional act to destroy a nation, an act of genocide,'' he said.

<P>
	In Medosevac, a village a little more than a mile from Nis, a  
pre-dawn raid left a large crater in the road. Resident Zagorka 
Krstic said 30 houses were destroyed. Thirteen were reduced to 
piles of debris. 
</P>
<P>
	Power lines were destroyed. Twisted electrical cables were  
scattered about. Pieces of furniture were trapped under the rubble.

<P>
	``I was in Nis baby-sitting my granddaughter,'' said Radmila  
Mitrovic, 59, sitting in the rubble of her demolished home. ``If I 
was here, I would be dead. I lost everything.''

</P>
<P>
	CLARKSVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- James E. Charlet, the former publisher  
and general manager of The Leaf-Chronicle, died Thursday at 90. 
</P>
<P>
	Charlet purchased a share in The Leaf-Chronicle in 1946 and went  
on to build a chain of 14 newspapers. By 1960, the firm owned the 
largest group of weeklies published in a single plant in the South. 
</P>
<P>
	Publications included the Stewart County Times, Donelson News  
Diary, Suburban News, Madison Community News, Goodlettsville 
Gazette, Hendersonville Star-News, Dickson County Herald, 
Springfield Herald, the Gallatin Examiner, Ashland City Times and 
Waverly News Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
	Charlet, his wife and three other stockholders sold The  
Leaf-Chronicle in 1973 to Multimedia but Charlet continued as 
president and publisher until 1978, turning the newspaper over to 
his son, James E. Charlet Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include a son, daughter, five grandchildren and seven  
great-grandchildren.

</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Leon Hess, an oil tycoon and the owner of the  
New York Jets, who last year came close to seeing his team return 
to the Super Bowl one last time, died Friday from complications of 
a blood disease. He was 85. 
</P>
<P>
	Hess, one of the wealthiest owners in professional sports, was  
in a group that bought the Jets of the American Football League in 
1963, when they were the New York Titans. He bought out his 
partners in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
	Hess died without seeing the Jets back in the Super Bowl. Their  
only appearance came in 1969 when Joe Namath led them to a landmark 
victory over the Baltimore Colts. 
</P>
<P>
	Hess was known as a generous owner who promoted a family  
atmosphere for his team. When Dennis Byrd was temporarily paralyzed 
in a collision with a teammate during a 1992 game, Hess offered 
financial and medical support throughout Byrd's recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	Hess acquired Amerada in 1969 after an ownership battle with  
Phillips Petroleum. Forbes magazine last year listed his net worth 
at $720 million. He stepped down as chairman and CEO of Amerada 
Hess Corp. in 1995.

</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Tibor Kalman, an innovative graphic designer who  
used visual images to try to effect social change, died Sunday of 
non-Hodgkins lymphoma. He was 49. 
</P>
<P>
	He died in a hotel near San Juan, Puerto Rico.  
</P>
<P>
	Kalman, who founded and ran the Manhattan design firm M&AMP;Co, had  
his staff do work that evoked the look of handmade signs, menus and 
flyers instead of a more polished corporate style. 
</P>
<P>
	He designed Barnes &AMP; Noble's distinctive shopping bag early in  
his career, and later did an album cover for the Talking Heads. 
Kalman produced a photographic series about New Yorkers' 
interactions with Times Square, which hung on a building there. 
</P>
<P>
	Kalman also worked as an editor and creative director at the  
magazines Art Forum and Interview. He was editor-in-chief of 
Colors, a magazine published by the clothing company Benetton.

                            *Paul Liacos    	
</P>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Retired Supreme Judicial Court Chief Justice Paul  
Liacos, whose tenure was marked by decisions on large issues such 
as abortion, racial bias and the right to an education, died 
Thursday at age 69. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of death was not released.  
</P>
<P>
	Liacos, who gained a reputation as an unabashed liberal, was  
appointed chief justice in 1989 by Gov. Michael S. Dukakis after 
serving 13 years as an associate justice. He stepped down in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	During his tenure, the SJC held that the state constitution  
prohibited the death penalty, the court provided broader protection 
for a woman's access to abortion, and it gave defendants greater 
protection in search and seizure cases. 
</P>
<P>
	In a major opinion written by Liacos, the court found that the  
state constitution requires children be provided an adequate 
education, a decision that spurred enactment of the state's 
ambitious education reform law. Liacos also opposed minimum 
mandatory prison sentences, contending that sentencing should be 
left to the discretion of judges. 
</P>
<P>
	Liacos founded the SJC's Committee to Study Racial and Ethnic  
Bias in the Courts and served as chairman of the national 
Conference of Chief Justices' Committee on Discrimination in the 
Courts.

</P>
<P>
	HAVANA (AP) -- Jesus Montane, one of an old band of  
revolutionaries who fought alongside Fidel Castro to seize power in 
Cuba in the 1950s, died Friday of a heart attack. His age was not 
disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	Dictator Fulgencio Batista jailed Montane with Castro and other  
guerrillas in Cuba's Isle of Pines for several years after they 
mounted a failed attack in 1953 on the Moncada army barracks in 
Santiago, launching the revolution. 
</P>
<P>
	The revolutionaries were later released under an amnesty decree  
and fled to Mexico, where they planned a second attack on Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	They returned in 1956, vanished into the countryside and  
continued fighting Batista, finally overthrowing him Jan. 1, 1959.

<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- William Owens, a grade school dropout who  
played for a dozen teams in the Negro leagues in the 1920s and 
'30s, died Wednesday of complications from diabetes. He was 98. 
</P>
<P>
	Owens, who had only a sixth-grade education, broke in with the  
Washington Potomacs in 1923. He played briefly with the 
Indianapolis ABCs and spent the next decade barnstorming with many 
teams before ending his career with the Detroit Stars in 1933.

                           *Louis R. Ross    	
</P>
<P>
	NAPLES, Fla. (AP) -- Louis R. Ross, a former vice chairman of  
Ford Motor Co. who oversaw the introduction in 1985 of the Ford 
Taurus, which became one of the company's most successful cars, 
died Sunday. He was 67. 
</P>
<P>
	The Taurus, which was conceived in 1979 and developed for about  
$3 billion, was a huge gamble for Ford because it was to be the 
basis for many of Ford's cars into the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	Ross worked through numerous delays in the introduction the  
Taurus but eventually saw Ford recover from low profits and surpass 
General Motors in the late 1980s as the car became a big hit. 
</P>
<P>
	The Taurus helped Ford make gains in the large-car segment that  
had long been dominated by General Motors as car buyers embraced 
its sleeker European styling and front-wheel drive. 
</P>
<P>
	In February 1985, Ross was named head of North American  
operators and worked on improving quality. He was named executive 
vice president and chief technical officer in 1991 and was promoted 
to vice chairman in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	He retired in 1996.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Eugene Schroeder, a reporter with The Associated  
Press for more than 40 years, died Wednesday from complications 
following a stroke. He was 77. 
</P>
<P>
	Prior to joining the AP in Detroit in 1958, Schroeder was a  
correspondent with International News Service, a forerunner of UPI, 
on roving assignments that included the fight for civil rights in 
the South. 
</P>
<P>
	Schroeder was AP's Lansing, Mich., correspondent in the early  
1960s. He chronicled Michigan's successful effort to adopt the 
nation's first new state constitution since 1909. 
</P>
<P>
	Schroeder later was a member of an AP task force on racial  
issues, joined the AP newsfeatures staff in New York in 1978, and 
was a special features editor when he suffered an incapacitating 
stroke last year.

<P>
	Survivors include a cousin.

</P>
<P>
	RIVERSIDE, Calif. (AP) -- Darwyn Swalve, a 6-foot-9 actor who  
used his bulk to advantage in a succession of television and movie 
bad-guy roles, died Wednesday of a heart attack, The 
Press-Enterprise reported. He was 53. 
</P>
<P>
	He had recently completed a role in Nickelodeon's ``The Journey  
of Allen Strange'' series, scheduled to air this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Swalve weighed 300-plus pounds and was a onetime  
semi-professional football player, but was known as a gentle man 
who disliked violence. 
</P>
<P>
	He began acting after he was discharged from the Marine Corps in  
1968. He appeared with Southern California theater companies and 
worked as a stuntman before making his film debut in 1983 in ``The 
Zoo Gang,'' which starred Ben Vereen. 
</P>
<P>
	Swalve's other films included ``City Heat,'' ``Heartbreak  
Ridge,'' ``Barton Fink,'' ``Hands of Steel,'' ``Police Academy 6,'' 
``Open House'' and ``Underground.'' Television credits included 
``The A-Team,'' ``Jake and the Fatman'' and ``Moonlighting.''

<HEADLINE> NCAA Committee Changes Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OVERLAND PARK, Kan. (AP) -- The so-called ``held-ball'' rule for  
men's college basketball has been rescinded, the NCAA announced 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The rule, used for the first time last season, gave possession  
to the defensive team when it created a held-ball situation. It was 
rescinded after the Men's Basketball Rules Committee met this week 
in Kansas City, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
	``We felt that it (the rule) didn't serve the purpose for which  
it was intended,'' said Air Force coach Reggie Minton, chairman of 
the rules committee. ``This was the feeling of the committee, as 
well as that of the majority of the feedback that we got from 
coaches, the media and the public.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The game will go back to use of the alternating possession arrow  
in all held-ball situations. The arrow replaced the jump ball for 
all but opening tipoffs in regulation and overtime beginning in the 
1981-82 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Other changes in the men's rules include allowing the NCAA  
Basketball logo to be placed anywhere on the team jersey that does 
not interfere with number recognition, and a change in the status 
of an airborne shooter who is fouled after the ball is released. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the old rule, a player was considered in the act of  
shooting until both feet touched the floor. The new rule changes 
that to one foot. 
</P>
<P>
	The men's and women's rules committees both adopted a timeout  
rule change used experimentally last season in an attempt to speed 
the end of games. 
</P>
<P>
	The rule calls for so-called ``television timeouts'' every four  
minutes. Teams will have five shortened timeouts of 30 seconds 
each, replacing the previous 20-second timeouts. Four of the 
mini-timeouts may be carried over to the second half. Teams will 
have no full timeouts, but the first mini-timeout called by either 
team will become a full, 75-second timeout. 
</P>
<P>
	``This should reduce breakaways from the game in the last few  
minutes,'' Minton said. ``This will be good for both the fans in 
the arena and those watching on television.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also, both committees adopted rules adding such items as laser  
pointers to the list of administrative technical fouls. 
</P>
<P>
	Use of an artificial noisemaker while the ball is in play will  
also be a technical foul, as will a home team's failure to have a 
continuous 2-inch wide halfcourt line and a 2-inch-wide continuous 
center-circle line on its court. 
</P>
<P>
	Both committees adopted another experimental rule from last  
season as well, moving the players in the two inside free-throw 
spaces an additional 2 inches from the end line. 
</P>
<P>
	The women's rule limits the number of players on the free-throw  
lane to five. 
</P>
<P>
	``Congestion in the lane can be a major problem,'' said Barbara  
Jacobs, coordinator of women's basketball officiating and sports 
administrator for the Big East Conference. ``Allowing only five 
players in the lane will help clean this up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Uniform numbers 1 and 2 will also be legal for both men's and  
women's games, and both rules committees clarified the rule on 
administration of a correctable error. 
</P>
<P>
	In most cases, play is resumed from the point at which a game is  
interrupted to correct the error. The exception added this week 
covers situations in which a free throw is awarded and there has 
been no change in possession since the error was made. In that 
case, play will resume after the free-throw attempt.

<HEADLINE> Feud Halts Business at Agency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- An unprecedented public feud between the  
governors of New York and New Jersey is threatening thousands of 
jobs and stalling $1.7 billion worth of construction projects at 
two major airports. 
</P>
<P>
	The spat between moderate Republicans George Pataki and Christie  
Whitman is a struggle for control of an agency called the Port 
Authority of New York and New Jersey. It has reached such a scale 
that it's being called one of the worst border wars ever in a 
history that includes battles for rights to Ellis Island, the New 
York Yankees and the stock exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts are puzzled, saying the governors are sticking to a  
fight that will benefit neither state. 
</P>
<P>
	``All sides lose,'' says Steve Salmore, a Republican consultant.  
``The question is, who's going to blink?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The governors jointly control the agency, which owns and manages  
the World Trade Center as well as the region's three airports and 
interstate bridges and tunnels. 
</P>
<P>
	The feud began last year when shipping carriers Sea-Land Service  
and Maersk threatened to leave the New York-New Jersey harbor, 
taking 1,000 jobs in both states and the harbor's status as an East 
Coast superport with them. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Pataki said he would veto a new lease proposal  
unless Whitman agreed to restructure the Port Authority so that the 
states no longer share revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I want very simply is fairness for New York,'' Pataki  
said recently. The governor and other New Yorkers, most vocally New 
York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, have long said that the agency 
favors New Jersey projects, while New York-owned properties make 
the most money. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitman says she won't agree to restructure the agency until the  
Sea-Land-Maersk contract goes through. ``You can't hold this 
negotiation hostage,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the governors stopped speaking last month, the Port  
Authority has stopped doing business. The authority's 12 
commissioners have not approved the budget and canceled its annual 
meeting two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the CEOs of Continental and American Airlines told  
the governors that nearly 9,000 people in both states won't have 
jobs because the agency has not approved a $1 billion American 
expansion at Kennedy Airport and a $700 million Continental project 
at Newark. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's probably the most destructive in terms of the  
battles that we've had over the 75 years'' of the Port Authority, 
said Jameson Doig, a Princeton University political scientist. 
</P>
<P>
	Most dangerous, he said, is the fact that the governors went  
public with disputes that in previous years were settled in 
private. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once the governors do that, then it's very hard for the  
governors to retreat,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said the governors may be more interested in their  
images. 
</P>
<P>
	Pataki, whose interest in a presidential candidacy next year has  
attracted little attention, has been trying to boost his national 
profile. Salmore said Pataki may be trying to imitate Giuliani, who 
may be the state's most famous Republican. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitman, meanwhile, badly needs a public victory to boost her  
U.S. Senate candidacy in 2000 and to take attention away from 
charges that New Jersey State Police troopers have racially 
profiled motorists. She has also had to defend Attorney General 
Peter Verniero, who she nominated to become a state Supreme Court 
justice and who has been called unqualified. 
</P>
<P>
	Party leaders are reluctant to criticize the two well-known  
governors. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a concern if it spirals to the point where it's just  
about egos,'' said Mike Gill, executive director of the Ripon 
Society, a moderate Republican group. ``Both these people are in 
the end pragmatists who are going to get the trains running 
again.''

<HEADLINE> Abortion Foe Charged in Slaying </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Dr. Barnett Slepian, just back from  
synagogue, was heating soup in his kitchen last fall when he was 
gunned down with a single shot through a window. 
</P>
<P>
	Slepian's killer is still at large. But for the first time,  
authorities have named a suspect in the slaying -- anti-abortion 
activist James Kopp. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today, I'm here to tell you we have our suspect,'' said  
Bernard Tolbert, special agent-in-charge of the FBI's Buffalo 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	Kopp, 44, of St. Albans, Vt., became the subject of an  
international manhunt in November when he was called a witness in 
the case. He was charged Thursday in state and federal complaints 
with second-degree murder and with violating the Freedom of Access 
to Clinic Entrances Act by using deadly force against an abortion 
doctor. 
</P>
<P>
	Both charges carry a penalty of up to life in prison. The  
federal charge also carries a fine of up to $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Kopp's whereabouts remain unknown. He was last seen Nov. 3, the  
day before authorities issued a material witness warrant in the 
Slepian shooting in the hope of questioning him. Until Thursday, 
they had not called Kopp a suspect. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators would not divulge the evidence against Kopp but  
said last month's discovery of a scope-equipped rifle buried near 
the Slepian home represented a major breakthrough. Slepian, 52, was 
shot with a rifle. 
</P>
<P>
	Kopp also has been linked, through DNA testing, to a strand of  
hair found near where the sniper fired, law enforcement sources 
have said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicknamed the ``Atomic Dog'' in anti-abortion circles, Kopp had  
been arrested in several states since 1990 for protesting abortion. 
His car was spotted in Slepian's neighborhood in the weeks before 
the shooting, and was found abandoned at the Newark, N.J., airport 
in December. 
</P>
<P>
	The filing of the charges has intensified interest in Kopp as a  
suspect in three non-fatal sniper attacks on Canadian abortion 
providers, and one near Rochester, N.Y., between 1994 and 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Kopp is now the second anti-abortion activist being sought by  
the FBI as a suspect in a fatal attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Rudolph has been on the run since the January 1998 bombing  
of a Birmingham, Ala., abortion clinic that killed an off-duty 
police officer and maimed a nurse. He also is charged in three 
Atlanta attacks, including the 1996 Olympic bombing that killed one 
person.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Pushes Accident Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration proposed  
legislation Friday to disclose regional ``worst case'' casualty 
estimates from chemical accidents -- but prevent dissemination of a 
national database. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan aims to keep terrorists from obtaining information to  
plan an attack, while telling Americans living near dangerous 
chemicals how they might be affected by a catastrophic event. 
</P>
<P>
	In Congress, majority Republicans have expressed concerns about  
public data that could help terrorists pick a chemical target. 
</P>
<P>
	The Environmental Protection Agency originally considered  
posting plant-by-plant ``worst case'' estimates on the Internet, 
but dropped the idea last fall after the FBI, the CIA, the National 
Fire Chiefs Association and lawmakers raised concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	Timothy Fields, acting EPA assistant administrator for solid  
waste and emergency response, said emergency officials and the 
public would be provided information in their own geographical 
areas under the plan. In some cases, the public information would 
include a multi-state region. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 36,000 facilities must provide ``worst-case scenario''  
information to the EPA by June 21 under a federal law. The data 
consists of the geographical area that would be endangered by a 
catastrophic event and the number of people in the area that might 
be affected. 
</P>
<P>
	The law applies to all types of facilities that use 140  
chemicals, not just to chemical manufacturing plants. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., chairman of a Senate Environment and  
Public Works subcommittee, plans to write his own bill. Inhofe has 
opposed release of a national database, especially on the Internet, 
and expressed concern that without legislation, the data could be 
released through the Freedom of Information Act. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Thomas Bliley, R-Va., chairman of the House Commerce  
Committee, said, ``It has taken over a half a year, but I am 
pleased that the administration has now admitted that this problem 
must be addressed through corrective legislation. I will be 
reviewing the proposal very closely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fields said the legislation would only permit those requesting  
the information ``to get paper copies of limited portions for 
particular facilities in a geographic area. EPA will develop 
guidance within 60 days of a new law of how paper copies would be 
distributed upon request.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll make sure no one will be able to have the entire  
database,'' Fields said. ``The FBI believes this is a reasonable 
approach to protect against terrorist threats.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Environmental organizations already have said they would oppose  
only limited release of the information. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Clinton Pushes Accident Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Trying to balance anti-terrorism concerns and  
the public's need for information, the Clinton administration is 
proposing legislation to provide limited disclosure of casualty 
estimates from potential chemical accidents. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal drafted Friday would provide local areas with  
regional data on ``worst case'' scenarios but prevent dissemination 
of a national database. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan aims to keep terrorists from obtaining information to  
plan an attack, while telling Americans living near dangerous 
chemicals how their area might be affected by a catastrophic event. 
</P>
<P>
	In Congress, majority Republicans have expressed concerns about  
public data that could help terrorists pick a chemical target. 
</P>
<P>
	The Environmental Protection Agency originally considered  
posting plant-by-plant ``worst case'' estimates on the Internet, 
but dropped the idea last fall after the FBI, the CIA, the National 
Fire Chiefs Association and lawmakers raised concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	Timothy Fields, acting EPA assistant administrator for solid  
waste and emergency response, said emergency officials and the 
public would be provided information in their own geographical 
areas under the plan. In some cases, the public information would 
include a multi-state region. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 36,000 facilities must provide ``worst-case scenario''  
information to the EPA by June 21 under a federal law. The data 
consists of the geographical area that would be endangered by a 
catastrophic event and the number of people in the area that might 
be affected. 
</P>
<P>
	The law applies to all types of facilities that use 140  
chemicals, not just to chemical manufacturing plants. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., chairman of a Senate Environment and  
Public Works subcommittee, plans to write his own bill in a panel 
session on Tuesday. Inhofe has opposed release of a national 
database, especially on the Internet, and expressed concern that 
without legislation, the data could be released through the Freedom 
of Information Act. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Thomas Bliley, R-Va., chairman of the House Commerce  
Committee, said, ``It has taken over a half a year, but I am 
pleased that the administration has now admitted that this problem 
must be addressed through corrective legislation. I will be 
reviewing the proposal very closely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fields said the legislation would only permit those requesting  
the information ``to get paper copies of limited portions for 
particular facilities in a geographic area. EPA will develop 
guidance within 60 days of a new law of how paper copies would be 
distributed upon request.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll make sure no one will be able to have the entire  
database,'' Fields said. ``The FBI believes this is a reasonable 
approach to protect against terrorist threats.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Environmental organizations already have said they would oppose  
only limited release of the information. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think the availability of a national data base is critical,  
because it allows the public to see how a particular facility or 
industry compares to others, and how a community compares,'' said 
Lois Epstein of the Environmental Defense Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	Playing down the terrorist threat, Ms. Epstein said, ``If this  
information is considered problematic, so is information on where 
the largest shopping centers are and the most used subway 
stations.'' 
</P>

said his industry organization supports only limited release of the 
material. 
</P>
<P>

environmental organization know about fighting terrorism. I would 
suggest they know little to nothing. We don't either.''

<HEADLINE> NASCAR Sponsor Changes Name of Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOMESTEAD, Fla. (AP) -- South Florida's inaugural Winston Cup  
race will have a different sponsor than first advertised, but the 
change is merely cosmetic. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nov. 14 race originally was announced as the Jiffy Lube 400,  
but parent company Pennzoil-Quaker State has decided to make 
Pennzoil the title sponsor instead. 
</P>
<P>
	The company already has a Jiffy Lube title sponsorship on the  
34-race Winston Cup circuit. The Jiffy Lube 300 will be run July 12 
at Loudon, N.H. 
</P>
<P>
	The Homestead race, meanwhile, will be the only one on Winston  
Cup with the Pennzoil name. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Pennzoil-Quaker State has decided to terminate its  
sponsorship of the Busch Grand National season finale scheduled for 
the same weekend. The move was made to concentrate promotional 
dollars on the Winston Cup race. 
</P>
<P>
	International Speedway Corp., which owns 45 percent of the  
Homestead-Miami Speedway, is pursuing a new sponsor for the Busch 
race. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a number of proposals out, and we're just waiting to  
see who steps up,'' speedway president Brian Skuza said.

<HEADLINE> Steel Industry Seeks Quota Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. steel industry will take its fight  
against low-priced imports to the airwaves with ads urging support 
for quotas under consideration in Congress, officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The television and radio spots will begin running Sunday during  
morning news shows, talk radio and other public affairs programs in 
Washington and other selected markets. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, despite the threat of a presidential veto, the House  
voted 289-141 for legislation that would impose global quotas on 
steel shipments into the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal is pending in the Senate, where it faces a more  
difficult time. The new broadcast spots represent the launch of a 
campaign to build support in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	``The goal of our advertising campaign is to convey our urgent  
message that illegally dumped foreign steel must be stopped in 
order to save our domestic steel industry,'' said George Becker, 
president of the United Steelworkers of America. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. industry is lobbying for passage of the quota measure  
to combat a flood of imports it blames for the loss of thousands of 
American jobs in the past year. The Clinton administration opposes 
the bill, fearing it could start a trade war and hurt U.S. 
industries that rely on foreign markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Imports rose again in March after four consecutive months of  
reductions. They reached record levels last year in the wake of the 
Asian economic crisis, which drove down demand for steel abroad and 
forced foreign producers to seek U.S. clients. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the Clinton administration ruled that Japan  
illegally dumped a core steel product, hot-rolled carbon steel, in 
U.S. markets at prices below production costs or home-market 
prices. Japan faces punitive tariffs as a result. Similar cases are 
pending against Brazil and Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	Steelworkers, meanwhile, have been pushing for quotas to block  
shipments from other countries and of other products as well. 
</P>
<P>
	The 60-second ad that begins airing Sunday features Leticia  
Klisiak, a single mom who works as a crane operator at Bethlehem 
Steel's Burns Harbor plant in Portage, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
	She complains of the foreign pricing practices and blames the  
imports for layoffs and bankruptcies at U.S. steel mills. Viewers 
and listeners are then urged to call their senators. 
</P>
<P>
	Marco Trbovich, a union spokesman, said other spots will air in  
the future. The ads will run primarily in Washington at first and 
will eventually spread to the states of ``targeted senators,'' whom 
he would not name. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials would not disclose how much the initial ads will cost  
or how long they will run, saying those details are still being 
finalized. The ads complement the steelworkers' letter-writing and 
phone-calling campaigns.

<HEADLINE> Jones Lawyers Seek Nearly $500,000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Lawyers for Paula Jones say they want  
President Clinton to pay nearly $500,000 to cover their costs 
following a judge's finding that Clinton had committed civil 
contempt in the sexual harassment case. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's lawyer called the request unreasonable. The president  
already paid $850,000 to settle the case while its dismissal was on 
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	The compensation proposal Friday came a month after U.S.  
District Judge Susan Webber Wright found Clinton in contempt for 
giving intentional, false testimony about his relationship with 
Monica Lewinsky during his January 1998 deposition in the Jones 
case. 
</P>
<P>
	The president ``must be sanctioned not only to redress his  
contemptuous misconduct but also to deter other litigants who might 
... harbor the impression that a party to a federal lawsuit may 
willfully disregard'' court orders, Mrs. Jones' lawyers wrote in 
making their request. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright had ordered Clinton to pay Mrs. Jones' lawyers any  
``reasonable'' expenses they incurred as a result of his false 
testimony. The Jones legal team met a Friday deadline in 
determining the amount. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton lawyer Robert S. Bennett said in a letter to Wright that  
the president will ``object to the amount of the claim by Ms. 
Jones' attorneys, which is unreasonable and inconsistent with the 
court's order and governing law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The letter said, however, that Clinton will not request a  
hearing or file a notice of appeal and wants to bring the Jones 
matter ``to speedy closure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Jones' lawyers submitted itemized bills for $437,825  
incurred by the Dallas law firm that represented her and an 
additional $53,333 incurred by the Rutherford Institute, a 
conservative group that paid some of her legal expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	The figure is significantly higher than the $300,000 that Mrs.  
Jones' lawyers recently proposed to Clinton's legal team during 
settlement discussions. Bennett dismissed the $300,000 figure 
earlier this week as ``outrageous and greedy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In their filing, Mrs. Jones' lawyers insisted that the $500,000  
was reasonable. They warned that if the president objected, they 
would present ``voluminous evidence'' of ``other contemptuous 
conduct perpetrated by Clinton'' to sustain further sanctions 
against him. 
</P>
<P>
	The expenses submitted for reimbursement include:  
</P>
<P>
	--$26,500 for preparation and travel to Washington for Clinton's  
Jan. 17, 1998, deposition. 
</P>
<P>
	--At least $3,719 for Internet research on Ms. Lewinsky, status  
of independent counsel Kenneth Starr's investigation into her 
relationship with Clinton and downloading and reviewing Starr's 
report to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	--At least $13,545 for legal research, conferences and drafting  
of motions for the contempt of court citation and sanctions against 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	--$9,855 for preparation of statement of fees and expenses to  
submit to the court. 
</P>
<P>
	John Whitehead, one of Mrs. Jones' lawyers, said attorneys who  
assisted her were not adequately paid for their work when they 
received portions of a settlement Clinton paid to Mrs. Jones 
earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as being greedy, everyone took far less than what they  
put in,'' Whitehead said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright, in her contempt ruling against Clinton on April 12,  
ordered him to repay Mrs. Jones' lawyers any ``reasonable 
expenses'' they incurred as a result of Clinton's testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge now must decide whether Mrs. Jones' reimbursement  
request is reasonable and amounts to an adequate penalty for the 
first president ever to be found in contempt of court. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has denied any wrongdoing and has said he settled the  
sexual harassment case simply to bring an end to a public crisis.

<HEADLINE>  Jets Owner Leon Hess Dies at 85 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Leon Hess, the oil tycoon and New York Jets  
owner whose 30-year wait to see his team return to the Super Bowl 
nearly ended last season, died Friday at 85. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jets said Hess died at Lenox Hill Hospital from  
complications of a blood disease. He was hospitalized last month 
with a broken hip. 
</P>
<P>
	``Leon Hess was a great American success story,'' NFL  
commissioner Paul Tagliabue said. ``There will be a terrible void 
as the Jets pursue their dream of another Super Bowl.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hess, quiet and low key and one of the wealthiest owners in  
sports, had been waiting since 1969 for that chance. The Jets, then 
part of the American Football League, jolted the NFL's Baltimore 
Colts in a landmark victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall of Fame quarterback Joe Namath had guaranteed a Jets'  
victory over the Colts in Super Bowl III. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never seen him in any other light than caring,'' Namath  
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, Hess felt greater urgency for another  
championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm 80 years old. I want results now,'' he said when he hired  
coach Rich Kotite in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	After a 4-28 record in two seasons, Kotite was succeeded by Bill  
Parcells. In his second season, Parcells got the Jets within a 
victory of the Super Bowl. They lost to the Denver Broncos in the 
AFC championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	Jets star Keyshawn Johnson recalled seeing Hess after that loss.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure nobody will forget him standing there when we came  
off the plane and thanking us,'' Johnson said. ``That meant a 
lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hess was the fourth major New York sports figure to die in the  
last six months. Weeb Ewbank, who coached the 1969 team, died in 
November, as did former Knicks coach Red Holzman. Baseball great 
Joe DiMaggio died in March. 
</P>
<P>
	Jets president Steve Gutman called Hess a decisive man who  
wouldn't interfere with those he hired. 
</P>
<P>
	``When Bill Parcells was hired, you recall Leon saying, `You're  
the man, one voice, one spokesman. It's yours to run as if you own 
it,''' Gutman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Parcells regrets Hess won't be able to watch the team he said.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm saddened by the loss of this great man who had such a  
quiet dignity,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jets were Hess' greatest passion after he stepped down four  
years ago as chief executive officer of Amerada Hess Corp. Hess 
started in the oil business in 1933, taking over the one-truck 
delivery service his Russian-immigrant father operated in Asbury 
Park, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody was broke in those days,'' Hess said. ``I had to pay  
for the truck before I delivered the oil.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hess won a battle with Phillips Petroleum, and bought Amerada in  
1969. Last year, Forbes magazine listed his the net worth at $720 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite his demeanor, Hess was a driven man, whether he was  
digging up and selling clams along the New Jersey shore during the 
Depression or negotiating an oil deal. 
</P>
<P>
	He rarely spoke about himself, but on the day he hired Parcells  
from New England, Hess was asked about negotiating with demanding 
Patriots owner Robert Kraft. 
</P>
<P>
	Hess recalled an encounter over oil prices with Moammar Gadhafi.  
The Libyan strongman watched as an associate in fatigues pounded on 
a table, removed a pistol from a holster and placed it the table. 
</P>
<P>
	``That doesn't scare me,'' Hess said.  
</P>
<P>
	Neither did the prospect of buying into the moribund New York  
Titans in 1963. The next season, they became the Jets, and in 1977 
he bought out his partners, notably Sonny Werblin and Phil Iselin. 
</P>
<P>
	Hess was known as a generous owner who promoted a family  
atmosphere for his team. When Dennis Byrd was temporarily paralyzed 
in 1992, Hess offered financial and medical support. 
</P>
<P>
	``To him, I owe everything,'' Byrd said.  
</P>
<P>
	On league matters, Hess most often sided with other seniors  
owners such as Wellington Mara of the Giants, Ralph Wilson of the 
Buffalo Bills and Art Modell of the Baltimore Ravens. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a sad, sad day for the National Football League and my  
family,'' said Modell, who angered Hess when he moved the Cleveland 
Browns to Baltimore in 1996. ``The NFL is not as decent ... as it 
was yesterday because of the passing of Leon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mara, who shared Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J., with  
Hess, called him a devoted family man. 
</P>
<P>
	``The NFL has lost one of its most beloved and respected  
leaders,'' Mara said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will miss him very much as a colleague, but even more so as  
a close longtime friend,'' Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerry Jones of the Dallas Cowboys, who represented the new breed  
of owners, called Hess a ``peer of mine and someone who I admired 
as one of the great American businessmen of our time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hess is survived by his wife of 51 years, Norma; son John, who  
succeeded him as CEO of Amerada Hess Corp; two daughters, Connie 
Williams, a state representative in Pennsylvania, and Marlene Hess; 
and seven grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
	The funeral is Monday at Park Avenue Synagogue in Manhattan.

	Hess was known as a generous owner who promoted a family  
atmosphere for his team. When Dennis Byrd was temporarily paralyzed 
in 1992, Hess offered financial and medical support. 
</P>
<P>
	``To him, I owe everything,'' Byrd said.  
</P>
<P>
	On league matters, Hess most often sided with other seniors  
owners such as Wellington Mara of the Giants, Ralph Wilson of the 
Buffalo Bills and Art Modell of the Baltimore Ravens. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a sad, sad day for the National Football League and my  
family,'' said Modell, who angered Hess when he moved the Cleveland 
Browns to Baltimore in 1996. ``The NFL is not as decent ... as it 
was yesterday because of the passing of Leon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mara, who shared Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J., with  
Hess, called him a devoted family man. 
</P>
<P>
	``The NFL has lost one of its most beloved and respected  
leaders,'' Mara said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will miss him very much as a colleague, but even more so as  
a close longtime friend,'' Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerry Jones of the Dallas Cowboys, who represented the new breed  
of owners, called Hess a ``peer of mine and someone who I admired 
as one of the great American businessmen of our time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hess is survived by his wife of 51 years, Norma; son John, who  
succeeded him as CEO of Amerada Hess Corp; two daughters, Connie 
Williams, a state representative in Pennsylvania, and Marlene Hess; 
and seven grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
	The funeral is Monday at Park Avenue Synagogue in Manhattan.

<HEADLINE> Pacers Have Big-Game Experience  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- If experience counts, the first-round  
playoff series between Indiana and Milwaukee looms as a major 
mismatch. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indiana Pacers have been to the Eastern Conference finals  
three times in the past five years, while Bucks are in the playoffs 
for the first time since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	Indiana's starters have been in 324 playoff games, while the  
combined total of Milwaukee's 12-man playoff roster totals only 
253. Milwaukee's likely starting unit includes only two players who 
have been in the playoffs, Dell Curry (29 games) and either Sam 
Cassell (55 games) or Haywoode Workman (38) at point guard. 
</P>
<P>
	``It helps, but you have to make it work,'' Indiana forward  
Chris Mullin said Friday. ``When you win, they say you're 
experienced, you play well. If you don't they say you're old and 
you're a bum.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mullin goes into Sunday's opening game in the best-of-5 series  
having played 49 playoff games, including 16 last year when the 
Pacers took eventual champion Chicago to seven games before losing 
88-83 in the Eastern Conference finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Reserve Sam Perkins has the most playoff experience on the  
Pacers with 128 games in 12 years -- more than twice the combined 
experience of the Bucks -- although all of it came with the Sonics, 
Lakers and Mavericks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's big. There are a lot of teams that haven't faced the  
playoffs,'' Perkins said. ``Basically, when you come to that level 
everyone raises their level of play. Whatever happens, there's 
scrutiny on the littlest mistakes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Having George Karl, who Perkins played for the past five  
seasons, could help make up for any lack of playoff exposure by the 
Bucks. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are some teams that haven't been there, that don't quite  
know what playoff experience is, but they do have coaches that have 
the ability to bring that to them,'' he said of Karl, who 
consistently took Seattle to the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It helps a little bit, especially in tight games, or if you  
get to Game 5 or Game 7,'' said coach Pacers Larry Bird, no 
stranger to the playoffs during his 13-year playing career with the 
Boston Celtics. 
</P>
<P>
	``You still have to go out and do the things that you've been  
taught to do all year long.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bird has put the team through two consecutive days of practice  
for over two hours and planned another practice session for 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``These guys are really listening and trying to do what we're  
asking,'' he said, adding that his team will need more than 
experience against Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've got a lot of speed,'' Bird said. ``We've had trouble  
with speed all year. They're definitely one of the best field goal 
shooting teams in the league.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Pacers won all three games with Milwaukee this season by  
margins of two-to-eight points, and Indiana has a streak of seven 
consecutive triumphs over the Bucks. The teams have never met in 
the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	In their three games this year, Glenn Robinson was particularly  
effective for the Bucks with 88 points and an average of 11 
rebounds. But, Robinson has been bothered by a deep knee bruise 
that kept him out of his team's final games. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of Robinson's success against Indiana has come when he was  
defended by Mullin, and Bird is likely to go to Derrick McKey to 
stop the former Indiana high school and Purdue star. 
</P>
<P>
	McKey did just that on April 21, when Robinson scored 15  
first-quarter points against Mullin. He finished with 27, but only 
four of those came when he was being defended by McKey. 
</P>
<P>
	``McKey is a taller guy,'' Robinson said. ``He gets a hand on  
the ball better than Mullin does. Mullin tries to catch you on the 
way up. They're two different defensive guys and I'm sure I'll have 
to deal with both of them.''

<HEADLINE>  Marine Guilty in Cable Car Tragedy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- The Marine pilot who escaped  
conviction on manslaughter charges in the Italian cable car tragedy 
was found guilty Friday of obstruction of justice and conspiracy 
for helping destroy a videotape of the flight. 
</P>
<P>
	Capt. Richard Ashby, 32, of Mission Viejo, Calif., could get up  
to 10 years in prison or be dismissed from the Marines. A 
sentencing hearing began immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby showed no emotion when the verdict in the court-martial  
was announced, but his mother, Carol Anderson, cried, ``Oh, no! Oh, 
no!'' and wept. The military jury took four hours to reach its 
verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby was the pilot of an EA-6B Prowler that sliced through a  
ski gondola cable in the Italian Alps on Feb. 3, 1998, sending the 
20 people aboard plunging more than 350 feet to their deaths. The 
video was shot from the cockpit during part of the flight. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Ashby was flying recklessly, but a military  
jury acquitted him of manslaughter in March, outraging the Italians 
and leading to demands that Americans be banned from NATO air bases 
in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	Upon learning of Friday's verdict in the obstruction case,  
Giuseppe Pontrelli, a lawyer for Italians who live near the 
accident site, said he doubted Ashby would get the punishment he 
deserves. 
</P>
<P>
	``We predict that Ashby will be kicked out of the Marines but  
won't get any jail time,'' Pontrelli said. ``Yet again there will 
be a sentence that has all to do with the internal hierarchy of the 
American military but nothing to do with the death of 20 innocent 
people, who remain definitively without justice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sindy Rekewitz of Burgstadt, Germany, whose father and sister  
died in the tragedy, was scornful of the guilty verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's convicted for destroying a videotape but not convicted  
for killing 20 people,'' she said. ``We still don't know who is 
responsible for what happened. Nobody could give us an answer to 
this question, so for us this is no end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby's navigator, Capt. Joseph Schweitzer, 31, of Westbury,  
N.Y., pleaded guilty earlier to identical charges in the 
destruction of the videotape and was ordered dismissed from the 
military. Manslaughter charges against him were dropped after 
Ashby's acquittal. 
</P>
<P>
	Schweitzer shot the video with Ashby's camera just before their  
jet entered the valley where it clipped the gondola cable. 
Investigators never saw what was on the tape. 
</P>
<P>
	After Ashby landed the crippled jet at the NATO air base at  
Aviano, Italy, he took the video out. He testified that he later 
gave it to Schweitzer at the navigator's request. Schweitzer said 
he threw it into a bonfire. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby and Schweitzer maintained that the tape contained no  
incriminating information. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby's lawyer, Frank Spinner, said his client had no criminal  
intent but had ``exercised poor judgment.'' And Schweitzer, who 
testified for the prosecution, said that he feared the tape would 
yield embarrassing images of his smiling face that would be played 
in the Italian media. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors, however, argued that Ashby and Schweitzer got rid  
of the tape to block the investigation of the tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
	``They knew when they brought a $50 million aircraft back badly  
damaged there was going to be an investigation,'' Maj. Daniel 
Daugherty said. ``Without that tape, there's a lot of speculation. 
Without that tape, we'll never know for sure what went on in that 
cockpit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two back seat crewmen in the radar-jamming aircraft were charged  
after the accident. Those charges were dismissed last year.

	Capt. Richard Ashby, 32, of Mission Viejo, Calif., could get up

sentencing hearing that began immediately after the verdict, jurors 
heard testimony from about a dozen witnesses and a statement by 
Ashby. Closing arguments were scheduled for Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't believe myself or the crew had a criminal mind,''  
Ashby told the jury. ``I take responsibility for what I did or did 
not do. I wish we would have done things differently.''

<HEADLINE> Delta Upholds Pilot Sleep Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Rest easy -- Delta Air Lines pilots may soon have  
more room to sleep on those long flights. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline Friday backed one of its pilots who cut short a  
flight to Japan because his relief pilots had trouble sleeping in 
the cramped bunk they dubbed ``the coffin.'' The airline also is 
working on a design for roomier sleeping quarters. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue became public after Capt. Roscoe McMillan landed his  
MD-11 in Portland, Ore., on April 7 rather than continue on from 
Atlanta to Japan. The 110 passengers were transferred to another 
flight to Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	McMillan said he landed the plane for safety because the two  
relief crew members didn't get sufficient sleep. 
</P>
<P>
	Delta investigated, interviewing McMillan and the other crew  
members. 
</P>
<P>
	``The end result is that we support the captain. He said he took  
the action because he didn't think his relief pilots would be as 
sharp as they should be,'' Delta spokesman Bill Berry said. ``He 
said it was based on safety concerns, and safety comes first.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 59-year-old McMillan, who has more than 30 years' experience  
with Delta, could have been reprimanded of even dismissed if the 
airline had concluded he diverted the plane as a protest. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilot, due to retire in less than a year, didn't return a  
call Friday. Berry said McMillan has continued his normal flying 
schedule since the landing, and there have been no other problems 
on the 14-hour Tokyo flight, Delta's longest nonstop route. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Delta managers have met with pilots about the  
sleeping compartment and engineers have submitted drawings to 
manufacturers for a larger chamber, Berry said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Line Pilots Association, representing Delta's 9,000  
pilots, has filed a grievance about the sleep module. 
</P>
<P>
	The union has said the bunk-bed units have too little room, lack  
privacy and allow too much outside noise to filter in. They are 
located between the cockpit and the business-class section and are 
blocked off by a 2-inch-thick curtain. 
</P>
<P>
	Delta had shrunk the MD-11 sleeping space five months ago to  
make more room for higher-paying business-class passengers. The new 
modules replaced one the pilots called ``the condo'' because it was 
spacious, quiet and private. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal regulations require airlines to provide on-board  
sleeping quarters for pilots on flights of 12 hours or more. Four 
crew members take turns at the controls. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Transportation Safety Board is gathering  
information on whether the smaller module contributes to pilot 
fatigue.

was found guilty Friday of obstruction of justice and conspiracy 
for helping destroy a videotape of the flight. 
</P>
<P>
	Capt. Richard Ashby, 32, of Mission Viejo, Calif., could get up  
to 10 years in prison or be dismissed from the Marines. At the 
sentencing hearing that began immediately after the verdict, jurors 
heard testimony from about a dozen witnesses and a statement by 
Ashby. Closing arguments were scheduled for Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't believe myself or the crew had a criminal mind,''  
Ashby told the jury. ``I take responsibility for what I did or did 
not do. I wish we would have done things differently.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby showed no emotion when the verdict in the court-martial  
was announced, but his mother, Carol Anderson, cried, ``Oh, no! Oh, 
no!'' and wept. The military jury took four hours to reach its 
verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby was the pilot of an EA-6B Prowler that sliced through a  
ski gondola cable in the Italian Alps on Feb. 3, 1998, sending the 
20 people aboard plunging more than 350 feet to their deaths. The 
video was shot from the cockpit during part of the flight. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Ashby was flying recklessly, but a military  
jury acquitted him of manslaughter in March, outraging the Italians 
and leading to demands that Americans be banned from NATO air bases 
in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	Upon learning of Friday's verdict in the obstruction case,  
Giuseppe Pontrelli, a lawyer for Italians who live near the 
accident site, said he doubted Ashby would get the punishment he 
deserves. 
</P>
<P>
	``We predict that Ashby will be kicked out of the Marines but  
won't get any jail time,'' Pontrelli said. ``Yet again there will 
be a sentence that has all to do with the internal hierarchy of the 
American military but nothing to do with the death of 20 innocent 
people, who remain definitively without justice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sindy Renkewitz of Burgstadt, Germany, whose father and sister  
died in the tragedy, was scornful of the guilty verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's convicted for destroying a videotape but not convicted  
for killing 20 people,'' she said. ``We still don't know who is 
responsible for what happened. Nobody could give us an answer to 
this question, so for us this is no end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby's navigator, Capt. Joseph Schweitzer, 31, of Westbury,  
N.Y., pleaded guilty earlier to identical charges in the 
destruction of the videotape and was ordered dismissed from the 
military. Manslaughter charges against him were dropped after 
Ashby's acquittal. 
</P>
<P>
	At Friday's sentencing hearing, Schweitzer again took  
responsibility for the tape's disappearance. He also testified 
during the court-martial. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe I was the overriding factor. It was my idea to take  
it out of the plane,'' he said. ``I was overcome by my own personal 
interests.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schweitzer shot the video with Ashby's camera just before their  
jet entered the valley where it clipped the gondola cable. 
Investigators never saw what was on the tape. 
</P>
<P>
	After Ashby landed the crippled jet at the NATO air base at  
Aviano, Italy, he took the video out. He testified that he later 
gave it to Schweitzer at the navigator's request. Schweitzer said 
he threw it into a bonfire. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby and Schweitzer maintained that the tape contained no  
incriminating information. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby's lawyer, Frank Spinner, said his client had no criminal  
intent but had ``exercised poor judgment.'' And Schweitzer, who 
testified for the prosecution, said that he feared the tape would 
yield embarrassing images of his smiling face that would be played 
in the Italian media. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors, however, argued that Ashby and Schweitzer got rid  
of the tape to block the investigation of the tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
	``They knew when they brought a $50 million aircraft back badly  
damaged there was going to be an investigation,'' Maj. Daniel 
Daugherty said. ``Without that tape, there's a lot of speculation. 
Without that tape, we'll never know for sure what went on in that 
cockpit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two back seat crewmen in the radar-jamming aircraft were charged  
after the accident. Those charges were dismissed last year.

<HEADLINE> Honda Plans Upgrade at Japan Plants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Honda Motor Co. plans to spend about $300 million  
on new equipment to streamline production and conserve energy at 
its Japanese plants. 
</P>
<P>
	Honda President Hiroyuki Yoshino also said Friday the company's  
exports to the United States would stay at the same level three 
years from now as last year's 250,000 vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	Honda was aiming for light-truck sales of 280,000 annually in  
the United States in three years from around 200,000 now, Yoshino 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The investment at its Japanese plants will allow Honda to make  
new models more quickly and reduce the number of assembly lines and 
shifts. 
</P>
<P>
	Honda will also aim for a 15 percent cut in energy consumption  
over 1990 levels in 2001 at its plants in Suzuka and Sayama, Japan, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the changes will not affect Honda's overall production for  
Japan of 1.25 million vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Honda announced it would spend more than $400  
million to build a new plant in Alabama, in the United States to 
manufacture minivans or sports utility vehicles as well as engines, 
and also to expand existing facilities.

<HEADLINE> Explosion Sparks Fire at Refinery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Texas (AP) -- An explosion sparked a fire Friday at a  
Lyondell-Citgo refinery near Houston, injuring one employee and 
sending a thick cloud of smoke drifting for miles. 
</P>
<P>
	The 48-year-old plant worker was transported to Hermann Hospital  
in Houston, where he was treated for burns and listed in critical 
condition, said Gretchen Casey, a hospital spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
	No other injuries were reported following the 3:30 p.m.  
incident, said David Harpole, a Lyondell spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire was confined to a delayed coking unit, which upgrades  
hydrocarbons into gasoline, Harpole said. Company firefighters were 
battling the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's in an isolated portion of the plant,'' he said. ``I don't  
believe there's going to be any need for some outside 
evacuations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The refinery, located just east of Houston in Pasadena, Texas,  
employs 1,200 people.

<HEADLINE> Bush Criticizes Clinton on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Republican presidential prospect George W.  
Bush blasted President Clinton's decision to rule out ground troops 
in Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it said, `We're coming to fight you with one hand',''  
the early GOP front-runner said in an interview with The Associated 
Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Sitting in his office at the pink granite capitol building  
Thursday, the Texas governor offered what may be his most detailed 
and critical assessment of the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	He spoke as the United States, its Western allies and Russia  
agreed on the outlines of a peace formula for Kosovo. Moscow 
endorsed deployment of an international security force to oversee 
the peaceful return of refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	The standoff with Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic has become  
an early touchstone of the 2000 presidential race, with a large 
field of GOP candidates trying to stake out positions on the 
headline-grabbing conflict. Arizona Sen. John McCain drew attention 
to his campaign by being the first to criticize Clinton for ruling 
out ground troops. Rep. John Kasich of Ohio urged mediation. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush first moved cautiously to react to the crisis, but  
eventually said he supported the mission and questioned Clinton's 
decision to rule out ground troops. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, son of the president who formed the Persian Gulf War  
coalition, said Clinton failed to clearly define the mission early 
on and questioned whether he has followed the exit-strategy 
doctrine established by President Bush and Gen. Colin Powell, then 
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any commander-in-chief has got to understand the true  
principles of the Powell Doctrine, which are: What are the 
objectives? How do you achieve the objective? And how do you 
end?,'' Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers are ``frustrated and concerned'' about the mission and  
those issues, he said, and that explains why a divided House failed 
to support the U.S.-led NATO mission in votes last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Congress is sending some mixed signals and I think there  
appears to be concerns by congressional leaders as to mission, 
objectives and the exit strategy,'' Bush said. ``I happen to think 
it's important for Milosevic to hear one voice, and that we're 
serious.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush said he would have voted to support the mission if he had  
been in Congress, if only to send a signal that the United States 
stands united behind its troops. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to have one objective in mind and that is to achieve  
the goals and to do so ferociously,'' Bush said. Like Clinton, he 
says the goals are to remove the Serbs from Kosovo, return the 
ethnic Albanians to their homes and insert a peacekeeping force. 
``It's important that NATO be involved'' with the peacekeeping 
effort, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an awesome responsibility to be commander-in-chief ...  
but the commander-in-chief has a responsibility, once the troops 
are committed, to win. To win,'' he said, putting added emphasis on 
the final two words. ``Once people's lives are at risk, once a 
decision has been made, then the plans have to be such as to 
minimize the loss by force.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Has Clinton done that?  
</P>
<P>
	``Time will tell,'' Bush said. ``I thought saying right off the  
bat that we won't use land troops was a mistake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he was pleased that Jesse Jackson gained the release of  
three American POWs, including two with ties to Texas. But he 
suggested that Milosevic used the mission to undermine U.S. 
resolve. ``Mr. Milosevic (is) a public relations master,'' Bush 
said. ``The fact that he's on CNN smiling with these POWs should 
not lessen the resolve of the United States.''

<HEADLINE> Champion Bull Rider Back in Saddle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARCHDALE, N.C. (AP) -- Jerome Davis still can't walk and he  
struggles to feed himself, the results of a bull ride in which the 
animal threw him on his head, shattering his spine and paralyzing 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, with the help of a special saddle, the 26-year-old  
champion bull rider is back on a stallion. His doctors haven't been 
told. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't tell them everything,'' he says, cutting a sly grin.  
``I'm going to do what I want to do. Besides, what are they going 
to do, tell me they want to stop taking my money? I don't think 
so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The saddle is the most familiar place on earth to Davis, who sat  
on his first horse when he was 2 months old, broke his first bronco 
when he turned 11 and won his first national bull-riding event at 
16. 
</P>
<P>
	Six years later, he became the world's best bull rider, riding  
nine out of the sport's 10 most menacing bulls at the 1995 national 
finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Then on March 14, 1998, at an arena in Fort Worth, Texas, Davis  
was paralyzed when a bull threw him. He swore he'd ride again -- if 
not bulls, then horses. 
</P>
<P>
	``A stallion,'' says his wife, Tiffany. ``It had to be a  
stallion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And so, a little more than a year after his crippling fall, just  
as he vowed, Davis rides a stallion named Chief. With the help of a 
special saddle equipped with a back brace, the cowboy and Chief 
wander his farm's arena, survey nearby hayfields and watch for 
mares. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis and his wife were married in October. They live in a  
100-year-old farmhouse on his grandfather's old ranch. Together, 
the two of them run a 100-acre farm, manage 200 head of bucking 
bulls, and put on rodeo events around the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Most days, wearing his world championship belt buckle, Davis  
cruises the farm on a specially equipped four-wheeler or a 
heavy-duty wheelchair. He herds bulls and cuts deals by phone that 
send his herd to rodeos around the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tell him he's the busiest crippled man I've ever seen in my  
life,'' Mrs. Davis jokes. ``I figured life would slow down a bit 
when this happened, but no, not Jerome.''

<HEADLINE> Mo Vaughn Comes Back to Fenway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The standing ovation for Mo Vaughn began as he  
strode to the plate for his first at-bat as a Red Sox opponent. 
</P>
<P>
	And when he walked back to the dugout after striking out in the  
first inning Friday night, there was another ovation, this one for 
Boston pitcher Pedro Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fenway Park fans were rooting for the Red Sox, but still  
admired the slugger and team leader who left as a free agent 
following his strained relationship with management. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I made the decision to move on, it was behind me,''  
Vaughn said before his first game in Boston as a member of the 
Anaheim Angels. ``It's nice to be back. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had a lot of great years here and the fans were behind me  
100 percent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not all of them were Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	``He used to be good for the Red Sox but now he's a traitor,''  
said one fan, 8-year-old Matthew Kehlman of Newton. 
</P>
<P>
	Donna Phillips, 44, of Pawtucket, R.I., wore a Red Sox shirt  
with Vaughn's name on it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't wait to give him a standing ovation the first time he  
comes to bat,'' she said. ``I think the whole park should. Mo 
didn't hate the fans and the fans didn't hate Mo. It was just 
business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vaughn said he had no animosity toward the club and was pleased  
that Red Sox chief executive officer John Harrington, who wouldn't 
shell out the money to keep a player who had hit 230 homers in 
eight seasons with Boston, met with him before the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``He just said, `congratulations,' and he hoped that I was  
happy,'' Vaughn said. ``It was definitely a nice gesture. He didn't 
have to do that. It was good to just talk man to man and forget 
about all the things in the past.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Management wasn't happy with Vaughn's outspoken nature. And when  
he was charged in a drunk driving case after his vehicle was 
involved in a Jan. 9, 1998, accident, the club wasn't pleased even 
though he was found innocent. 
</P>
<P>
	When the team had an exclusive 15-day period to sign him after  
last season, it chose not to. So on Thanksgiving Eve, Vaughn 
accepted a six-year, $80 million contract from Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
	But Vaughn was in no mood to rehash all that Friday night.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've got nothing to prove to the Boston Red Sox or anybody out  
there. I just want to get on the field. I've only been out there 
about 2 1/2 weeks and (I'm) really not strong like I want to be,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I'm not out here to embarrass anybody, to make anybody  
look bad,'' he added. ``I'm not going to point in the stands. I'm 
not going to do anything like that. I'm just going to play my game 
like I always have. 
</P>
<P>
	``You try to channel your emotions and just really do what  
you've got to do, try not to put too much weight on it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vaughn sprained his ankle in Anaheim's opening game and went on  
the disabled list. On the first pitch he saw in his first game back 
on April 22, he hit a homer at Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	He entered Friday's game batting .278 with four homers and 13  
RBIs in 15 games. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Red Sox were taking batting practice, Vaughn chatted  
with Boston manager Jimy Williams, embraced former teammate Mike 
Stanley and shared a laugh with John Valentin, his ex-teammate at 
Seton Hall and with the Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
	``Being friends is something off the field,'' Stanley said.  
``I'll try to beat his pitcher and he'll try to beat our pitcher.''

<HEADLINE> Investigators Detain Cyclists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Paris police have detained 15 people, including  
several top sportsmen, in a new anti-drugs swoop, police sources 
told The Associated Press on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those called in for questioning were Frank Vandenbroucke,  
a Belgian cyclist; Lionel Virenque, the brother and manager of 
former Festina cyclist Richard Virenque; and a Lyon soccer player 
who was not identified by name. 
</P>
<P>
	The daily Le Monde identified the soccer player as 23-year-old  
defender Jean-Christophe Devaux. The information couldn't be 
independently confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
	All were called in for questioning on Thursday or Friday,  
according to the police sources, who spoke on condition they not be 
further identified. 
</P>
<P>
	Only six of those questioned were still being held Friday  
evening, according to judicial sources. 
</P>
<P>
	Vandenbroucke and another rider for the Confidis team, Philippe  
Gaumont, and Devaux had been released, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	Several others, including Virenque, were to be released shortly.  
</P>
<P>
	The sources said that the action was taken ``in the context of  
the EPO scandal'' that overshadowed the 1998 Tour de France. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year's race was thrown into turmoil after customs officials  
found a stash of anabolic steroids and erythropoietin (EPO) in a 
Festina team car. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniel Baal, president of the French Cycling Federation, said on  
French radio that the investigation showed ``people have not 
understood'' the anti-doping message delivered by sports 
authorities since last year's Tour de France. 
</P>
<P>
	The Confidis company said in a statement issued Friday that its  
team members should be presumed innocent. The company added that it 
would ``act, as it has always done, following ethics and the 
cycling charter, if it is proven that any of its riders had broken 
the law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In recent weeks, Paris police have worked to track down  
information on a horse owner who may allegedly be a supplier of 
banned substances to sportsmen, the sources added. 
</P>
<P>
	Patrick Keil, the Lille judge investigating Festina, has placed  
16 other people under formal investigation, one step short of being 
charged. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those under investigation are Baal; Roger Legeay, the  
FFC's vice president, and the president of the French Cycling 
League; Jean-Marie Leblanc, director of the Tour de France; Richard 
Virenque; and Bruno Roussel, the former sporting director at 
Festina. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Keil called in several of those under investigation  
to hear further evidence.

<HEADLINE> Pacers Have Big-Game Experience  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- If experience counts, the first-round  
playoff series between Indiana and Milwaukee looms as a major 
mismatch. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indiana Pacers have been to the Eastern Conference finals  
three times in the past five years, while Bucks are in the playoffs 
for the first time since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	Indiana's starters have been in 324 playoff games, while the  
combined total of Milwaukee's 12-man playoff roster totals only 
253. Milwaukee's likely starting unit includes only two players who 
have been in the playoffs, Dell Curry (29 games) and either Sam 
Cassell (55 games) or Haywoode Workman (38) at point guard. 
</P>
<P>
	``It helps, but you have to make it work,'' Indiana forward  
Chris Mullin said Friday. ``When you win, they say you're 
experienced, you play well. If you don't they say you're old and 
you're a bum.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mullin goes into Sunday's opening game in the best-of-5 series  
having played 49 playoff games, including 16 last year when the 
Pacers took eventual champion Chicago to seven games before losing 
88-83 in the Eastern Conference finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Reserve Sam Perkins has the most playoff experience on the  
Pacers with 128 games in 12 years -- more than twice the combined 
experience of the Bucks -- although all of it came with the Sonics, 
Lakers and Mavericks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's big. There are a lot of teams that haven't faced the  
playoffs,'' Perkins said. ``Basically, when you come to that level 
everyone raises their level of play. Whatever happens, there's 
scrutiny on the littlest mistakes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Having George Karl, who Perkins played for the past five  
seasons, could help make up for any lack of playoff exposure by the 
Bucks. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are some teams that haven't been there, that don't quite  
know what playoff experience is, but they do have coaches that have 
the ability to bring that to them,'' he said of Karl, who 
consistently took Seattle to the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It helps a little bit, especially in tight games, or if you  
get to Game 5 or Game 7,'' said coach Pacers Larry Bird, no 
stranger to the playoffs during his 13-year playing career with the 
Boston Celtics. 
</P>
<P>
	``You still have to go out and do the things that you've been  
taught to do all year long.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bird has put the team through two consecutive days of practice  
for over two hours and planned another practice session for 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``These guys are really listening and trying to do what we're  
asking,'' he said, adding that his team will need more than 
experience against Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've got a lot of speed,'' Bird said. ``We've had trouble  
with speed all year. They're definitely one of the best field goal 
shooting teams in the league.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Pacers won all three games with Milwaukee this season by  
margins of two-to-eight points, and Indiana has a streak of seven 
consecutive triumphs over the Bucks. The teams have never met in 
the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	In their three games this year, Glenn Robinson was particularly  
effective for the Bucks with 88 points and an average of 11 
rebounds. But, Robinson has been bothered by a deep knee bruise 
that kept him out of his team's final games. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of Robinson's success against Indiana has come when he was  
defended by Mullin, and Bird is likely to go to Derrick McKey to 
stop the former Indiana high school and Purdue star. 
</P>
<P>
	McKey did just that on April 21, when Robinson scored 15  
first-quarter points against Mullin. He finished with 27, but only 
four of those came when he was being defended by McKey. 
</P>
<P>
	``McKey is a taller guy,'' Robinson said. ``He gets a hand on  
the ball better than Mullin does. Mullin tries to catch you on the 
way up. They're two different defensive guys and I'm sure I'll have 
to deal with both of them.''

<HEADLINE> Columbine 'Boy in the Window' OK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Bleeding from three gunshots and unable  
to move his right arm or leg, Patrick Ireland still saw a way out 
of the Columbine High School rampage -- the window. 
</P>
<P>
	He pulled himself across broken glass, and as the nation watched  
on TV, police pulled him from the second-story window until he 
dropped to safety. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was the shortest way down, out,'' Ireland said Friday. ``My  
whole right side was paralyzed. I felt confident that there'd be 
someone there to catch me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ireland spoke publicly for the first time since April 20, when  
Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold shot 12 students and a teacher before 
killing themselves. Ireland was one of 22 students who were 
wounded, and his dramatic rescue from the window during the 
slaughter gripped the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know that everyone has been wondering what happened to the  
boy in the window, and he's doing really really well,'' said 
Ireland's mother, Kathy. 
</P>
<P>
	Ireland was shot once in the right foot and twice on the left  
side of his head, suffering neurological damage that mimics a 
stroke. Doctors have not determined the extent of his permanent 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very remarkable, brave young man,'' said Dr. Alan  
Weintraub. ``It's only been two, 2 1/2 weeks and these are very short 
neurological time frames. However, Patrick is showing very 
impressive, steady recovery in many areas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ireland occasionally has muscle spasms in his leg. The most  
difficult aspect of his therapy is speech and reading because ``the 
words get mixed up in my head sometimes and I'm not sure of all of 
the meanings,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	During a hospital news conference, Ireland, sitting in a  
wheelchair and wearing a baseball cap decorated with a memorial 
Columbine ribbon, stopped occasionally to confer with his parents 
before he answered questions in a strong, clear voice. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he knew of Harris and Klebold, but was not acquainted  
with them. When they opened fire, ``I closed my eyes,'' he said. 
But he was reluctant to discuss the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't really remember all of it,'' he said. ``I'm still  
trying to piece together the events that happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He admitted he feels a ``little bit'' of anger, but has not  
given it much thought. And he is eager to return to school, yet 
unsure how he will react. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Ireland said she and her husband, John, didn't realize the  
boy in the window was Patrick until they saw a video of the rescue 
three days after the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt, and I think John did too, that there wasn't any reason  
to consider that might be Patrick because we knew he was paralyzed 
and we couldn't imagine that,'' she said. ``I didn't picture it 
happening that way. When we did see it, we knew immediately it was 
him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Four other students remained hospitalized Friday, two in serious  
condition and one in fair condition. The fourth was undergoing 
rehabilitation.

<HEADLINE> Brokerage Fires 19 Over E-mail Flap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- The brokerage Edward Jones &AMP; Co. demanded that  
workers admit it if they sent pornography or off-color jokes over 
the company e-mail system, then it fired 19 of them for failing to 
fess up. 
</P>
<P>
	Another 41 who came forward were disciplined, the company said  
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The action illustrates the heightened scrutiny that many  
companies are giving to what they perceive is an abuse of their 
electronic communications networks. 
</P>
<P>
	``When people get Internet access at Edward Jones, they know the  
policy of the firm,'' said Mary Beth Heying, a spokeswoman for the 
brokerage. ``It is not acceptable to use the Internet for 
nonbusiness-related purposes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The company, which tracks employees' telephone calls and  
Internet use, issued a memo on April 27 instructing employees who 
had sent e-mails containing the blue material to report to the 
personnel office by April 29, Heying said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 19 workers who were fired did not come forward on their own,  
Heying said. The 41 offenders who voluntarily admitted wrongdoing 
received written warnings. 
</P>
<P>
	The e-mail crackdown was confined to the 2,316 employees working  
among the three campuses that make up the company's international 
headquarters in St. Louis, Heying said. 
</P>
<P>
	Edward Jones, the world's ninth-largest brokerage, has a vast  
network of 4,570 offices in the United States, Canada and England. 
It has roughly 17,000 workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Greenberg, director of management studies for American  
Management Association, said more companies are snooping on their 
employees' e-mail and computer files. 
</P>
<P>
	A recent survey of 1,054 companies by the New York-based  
business trade group showed 27 percent check employee e-mail, up 
from 20 percent in 1998. Of the businesses that monitor e-mail, 84 
percent said employees were informed of the practice. 
</P>
<P>
	The group has not tracked disciplinary actions taken against  
workers, but Greenberg believes it is on the rise. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people think that their desk is their desk and their  
chair is their chair, but it isn't,'' Greenberg said. ``If you are 
using company equipment and spending company dollars to do so, you 
have an obligation to be doing the company's business. 
</P>
<P>
	The group recently sent an advisory to its 10,000 member  
companies, urging them to post policies on electronic monitoring 
and surveillance so that employees know they are being watched.

<HEADLINE> Mistrial in Julie Hiatt Steele Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) -- With jurors hopelessly deadlocked, a  
judge declared a mistrial today in the case of a woman charged with 
obstructing Kenneth Starr's investigation of President Clinton by 
giving false testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	After more than eight hours of deliberation, the foreman said  
jurors were deadlocked on all four charges against Julie Hiatt 
Steele. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will then declare a mistrial in this case,'' said U.S.  
District Judge Claude Hilton. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, Hilton announced that he had gotten a note from the  
jury saying, ``Any further deliberation will not -- and the word 
'not' has been underlined -- change the outcome.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele was charged with lying in statements and grand jury  
testimony that undercut her one-time friend Kathleen Willey's 
allegation of an unwanted sexual advance by Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has denied the allegation.  
</P>
<P>
	If convicted of all charges, Ms. Steele could have faced up to  
35 years in prison and $1 million in fines. Starr's prosecutors 
didn't immediately indicate whether they might seek a retrial. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele looked elated after her lawyers came back from a  
short bench conference with the judge and whispered to her that a 
mistrial would be declared. 
</P>
<P>
	The case focused on the testimony of Mrs. Willey, whose  
credibility was assailed by Ms. Steele's lawyers. They depicted her 
as an admitted liar whose story was nonetheless embraced by Starr's 
prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Willey testified that she rebuffed a ``very forceful''  
sexual advance by Clinton, telling Ms. Steele about the incident 
hours after it occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele said the first time she ever heard of a  
Clinton-Willey encounter was in March 1997 when Mrs. Willey called 
her and asked her to lie about it to a Newsweek reporter. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele's trial was the only criminal case to grow out of the  
independent counsel investigation of the president's relationship 
with Monica Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial was the second setback in less than a month for Starr,  
who was unable to convict Whitewater figure Susan McDougal in a 
case in Little Rock, Ark. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele's lawyers didn't call any defense witnesses.  
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Nancy Luque had said in opening statements that  
Ms. Steele would testify, but her legal team decided not to put her 
on the witness stand where she would be exposed to 
cross-examination by Starr's prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors produced three witnesses who said Ms. Steele  
informed them she had known of the alleged Clinton advance before 
1997. Each of the three witnesses testified Ms. Steele insisted to 
them later that she hadn't told them. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys questioned why Mrs. Willey now remembers the  
alleged encounter with Clinton and her conversations with Ms. 
Steele in much more detail than she did the first time she told the 
story under oath -- during her January 1998 deposition for the Paula 
Jones sexual harassment lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Trying to explain her state of mind during the Jones deposition,  
Mrs. Willey testified that she had been frightened by a threatening 
encounter two days earlier with a stranger who knew that Ms. 
Steele's cat was missing and her car tires had been slashed. 
</P>
<P>
	She also said Clinton lawyer Robert Bennett in a conversation  
suggested she invoke her Fifth Amendment right against 
self-incrimination rather than answer the questions -- a statement 
she said she regarded as a ``threat coming from the president.'' 
Outside of court, Bennett denied ever making such a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Trying to show Mrs. Willey as emotionally unbalanced, Ms.  
Steele's lawyers made Mrs. Willey recount a grocery store 
confrontation in which she called Ms. Steele a four-letter word. 
Mrs. Willey said she regretted the confrontation, but said Ms. 
Steele had been attacking her in TV interviews and public 
appearances over the past year. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele's lawyers also delved into her taking of various  
antidepressants, including Prozac. Mrs. Willey said she had been 
depressed for some time after her husband's suicide which occurred 
the same day as the alleged Clinton advance. 
</P>
<P>
	And Mrs. Willey admitted she lied to Starr's investigators when  
they asked about a past relationship in which she had pretended to 
be pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
	Rather than abandoning their witness, Starr's office granted a  
second grant of immunity from prosecution from Starr's office as a 
result of that lie.

<HEADLINE> Jets Owner Leon Hess Dies at 85 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Leon Hess, owner of the New York Jets, died  
today in a New York hospital. He was 85. 
</P>
<P>
	Hess was hospitalized with a broken hip early last month and had  
been discharged. However, complications developed and he reentered 
Lenox Hill Hospital about four weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Cause of death was attributed to a complications from a blood  
disease, the Jets said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hess, who made his fortune as a forceful oil tycoonm, was in a  
group that bought the Jets of the American Football League in 1963, 
when they were the New York Titans. 
</P>
<P>
	He eventually bought out his partners, Sonny Werblin and Phil  
Iselin. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jets began play in Shea Stadium in 1964 after four seasons  
in the Polo Grounds, but 20 years later, Hess moved the team's home 
games to Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	Hess died without realizing his dream of seeing the Jets back in  
the Super Bowl for the first time since 1969 when Joe Namath led 
them to a memorable victory over the Baltimore Colts. 
</P>
<P>
	They came closest to fulfilling his wish last season when, with  
Bill Parcells as their new coach, they got into the AFC title game. 
</P>
<P>
	Hess had been president and chief executive officer of Amerada  
Hess, the oil company, and was one of the richest owners in pro 
sports. His wealth was estimated at more than $700 million dollars.

	'Jenny Jones Show' Found Negligent  
</P>
<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- A jury decided today that ``The Jenny  
Jones Show'' was negligent in the slaying of a gay guest who 
admitted a crush on another man, ordering the producers to pay more 
than $25 million in damages. The jury of five women and four men 
debated for just under seven hours before returning the verdict. 
Scott Amedure's family argued that a mentally ill Jonathan Schmitz 
was lured onto the talk show in 1995 believing he would meet a 
woman, and was humiliated when his secret admirer turned out to be 
Amedure. Schmitz, who admitted shooting Amedure, has said he is 
heterosexual. Lawyers for Warner Bros. said Schmitz was told his 
admirer could be a man or woman.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton turned his attention today

home, calling for a national campaign to reduce teen violence and 
``give our children the safe childhoods they deserve.'' Back from a 
two-day trip to Europe, he said that reducing violence among young 
people will require the same kind of sustained national efforts 
that have lowered teen pregnancy and helped 400,000 people from the 
welfare rolls into jobs. On Monday, Clinton will preside over a 
White House conference called after the school shootings in 
Littleton, Colo.

<HEADLINE> Court Says Clown Was Obscene </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) -- A man who dressed up as ``Crotchy the  
Clown'' and masturbated on his public access cable TV show violated 
obscenity laws, the Nebraska Supreme Court ruled Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling overturned a decision by the state Court of Appeals,  
which had said the show was ``bizarre and disgusting'' but not 
obscene. The high court restored the distributing-pornography 
conviction and $1,000 fine against Scott Harrold. 
</P>
<P>
	Cablevision aired the show in question two nights in a row in  
1995. 
</P>
<P>
	About 14 minutes into the 16-minute show, Harrold, wearing only  
sunglasses and clown makeup, is shown masturbating. Harrold said he 
produced the tape after a female viewer complained there was not

<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- All-Americans Ossie Antonetti and Ryan Millar  
overcame intestinal illness to lead Brigham Young to a 10-15, 15-4, 
15-11, 15-4 victory over Penn State in the opening semifinal of the 
NCAA men's volleyball championship Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	In the oxther semifinal at UCLA's Pauley Pavilion, Long Beach  
State played Indiana-Purdue of Fort Wayne. The winners meet 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Top-seeded BYU (29-1) was led by Antonetti's 24 kills and  
Millar's 20. 
</P>
<P>
	Brigham Young coach Carl McGown said both players had been  
suffering Wednesday from ``intense intestinal distress'' and it was 
questionable whether they would play. 
</P>
<P>
	Brad Miller led Penn State (22-13) with 20 kills.  
</P>
<P>
	BYU's loss in the opening game of the match was only its third  
in its past 33 games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cougars broke out to an 8-1 lead in the second game and an  
8-4 advantage in the third. The Nittany Lions responded with five 
consecutive points. After Millar's kill gave the serve back to 
Brigham Young, the Cougars regained the lead on Rich Lambourne's 
kill, eventually increasing their advantage to 12-9. Penn State won 
the next two points, but the Cougars closed the game with the final 
three points.

<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- All-Americans Ossie Antonetti and Ryan Millar  
overcame intestinal illness to lead Brigham Young to a 10-15, 15-4, 
15-11, 15-4 victory over Penn State in the opening semifinal of the 
NCAA men's volleyball championship Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	In the oxther semifinal at UCLA's Pauley Pavilion, Long Beach  
State played Indiana-Purdue of Fort Wayne. The winners meet 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Top-seeded BYU (29-1) was led by Antonetti's 24 kills and  
Millar's 20. 
</P>
<P>
	Brigham Young coach Carl McGown said both players had been  
suffering Wednesday from ``intense intestinal distress'' and it was 
questionable whether they would play. 
</P>
<P>
	Brad Miller led Penn State (22-13) with 20 kills.  
</P>
<P>
	BYU's loss in the opening game of the match was only its third  
in its past 33 games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cougars broke out to an 8-1 lead in the second game and an  
8-4 advantage in the third. The Nittany Lions responded with five 
consecutive points. After Millar's kill gave the serve back to 
Brigham Young, the Cougars regained the lead on Rich Lambourne's 
kill, eventually increasing their advantage to 12-9. Penn State won 
the next two points, but the Cougars closed the game with the final 
three points.

<HEADLINE> Show Held Liable in Guest's Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Talk show hosts have something else to worry  
about besides dwindling ratings. 
</P>
<P>
	A jury's $25 million verdict Friday against ``The Jenny Jones  
Show'' for negligence in the shooting death of a homosexual guest 
who admitted a crush on another man is a serious blow to a 
beleaguered industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it was an accident waiting to happen,'' said Geraldo  
Rivera, who stopped his own free-wheeling syndicated talk show last 
year and now is host of a nightly legal talk show on CNBC. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury held the show responsible for luring a man onto the  
show believing he would be meeting a woman, then humiliating him 
when his secret admirer turned out to be a man. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe we'll do something about these shows ... and there'll be  
no more killing,'' said Frank Amedure, father of victim Scott 
Amedure. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for Amedure's family argued that the case will force  
talk shows to regulate themselves so harm isn't done to their 
guests. The show's lawyers warned that the verdict, if left to 
stand on appeal, could open talk and news shows to liability simply 
if guests are embarrassed about what happens to them. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Thompson, director of the Center for the Study of Popular  
Television at Syracuse University, said he worried about the 
precedents. 
</P>
<P>
	``If every talk show feels they need to do psychological testing  
before a guest can go on, some people will be denied access,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Representatives of several talk shows declined to speak about  
the case Friday, including the combative ``Jerry Springer Show.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Except for Springer, most talk shows have seen their ratings go  
down recently. Experts say they are hurt by the popularity of legal 
shows like ``Judge Judy'' and market saturation -- too many shows 
competing for a limited audience. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones' show, for instance, has seen its ratings slip 20 percent  
this year. Sally Jesse Raphael, Montel Williams, Oprah Winfrey, 
Rosie O'Donnell, Regis Philbin and Kathie Lee Gifford and Maury 
Povich have also seen dwindling numbers. Howie Mandel's talk show 
was recently canceled. 
</P>
<P>
	Rivera said he decided to step back from the sleaze when he  
taped a show, ``Terrible Family Secrets,'' where a woman came on 
the air to surprise her husband with the news that she was leaving 
him and that he wasn't the father of one of their children. 
</P>
<P>
	The man stalked off the set, and the show never aired, Rivera  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just got to the point where everyone was trying to reach  
the lowest common denominator and it became so clear, so apparent, 
that it was a course of action headed for tragedy,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Kentucky's Magloire To Test NBA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- Kentucky center Jamaal Magloire will enter  
the NBA draft but will retain the option of returning to Lexington 
for his senior year if he doesn't like his probable draft position, 
coach Tubby Smith said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	By not signing with an agent and enrolling for summer school at  
Kentucky, Magloire will have until June 23 -- one week before the 
draft -- to change his mind and remain eligible for NCAA play. 
</P>
<P>
	Magloire was in his hometown of Toronto when Smith made the  
announcement during a news conference. The coach said he met with 
Magloire and his parents in Toronto on Thursday to discuss the 
6-foot-10 center's plans. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said he supports Magloire's decision to assess his NBA  
options by attending pre-draft workouts and the league's pre-draft 
camp in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he did not know what draft position might meet  
Magloire's requirements for turning pro, but said he thinks it 
``highly likely'' Magloire will be back at Kentucky next season. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's not definite (about turning pro),'' he said. ``If he was  
definite, he wouldn't be doing this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Magloire averaged seven points and 4.4 rebounds in 34 games last  
season, coming off the bench in all but two of those games. He led 
Kentucky with 66 blocked shots and has 211 career blocks, fourth on 
the school's career list. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's always been my dream to play in the NBA and I've worked  
hard all my life to reach this goal,'' Magloire said in a statement 
issued by Kentucky. ``I have sat down with my family and decided to 
test the waters, but I'm leaving the door open to return to UK.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most analysts have projected Magloire as a late first-round pick  
at best and have said he would benefit from a final year in 
college. 
</P>
<P>
	Magloire had an up-and-down junior season that began when two  
companions were arrested for drug possession and Magloire was 
searched by police before being freed. Smith suspended him for the 
first two regular-season games for that, then suspended him again 
midway through the season when he missed a curfew. 
</P>
<P>
	Magloire came on strong in the latter part of the season,  
however, helping lead Kentucky to the regional finals of the NCAA 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Magloire could become the sixth member of last season's team to  
leave. Seniors Scott Padgett, Heshimu Evans and Wayne Turner are 
graduating, and sophomores Michael Bradley and Ryan Hogan announced 
last week that they would transfer. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking publicly for the first time since the departure of  
Bradley and Hogan, Smith said he was shocked and saddened, 
particularly by Bradley's decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Little used as a freshman, Bradley started all 37 games in  
1998-99, nearly all of them at center, and set a school record for 
shooting percentage. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said I thought he was the most improved player I've ever  
coached,'' Smith said. ``Somebody else is getting a very good 
player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Should Magloire also leave, Kentucky would return only six  
scholarship players: guard Saul Smith, the coach's son; 
forward-center Jules Camara; forward-guards Desmond Allison and 
Tayshaun Prince; and reserve guards Todd Tackett and J.P. Blevins. 
Smith will be a junior, the rest sophomores. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to be young. We were going to be young anyway,''  
even with Magloire, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kentucky's signees include forward-center Nate Knight, a 6-8  
junior college transfer; guard Keith Bogans; and 6-10 
forward-center Marvin Stone. Forward Marquis Estill is a question 
mark after surgery on both knees. A fourth signee, center John 
Stewart of Indianapolis, collapsed and died in March during an 
Indiana state high school playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
	In spite of all the comings and goings, Smith said he isn't  
worried. 
</P>
<P>
	``This program is going to survive and prosper,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Qualcomm Sued Over Stock Options </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Wireless communications company Qualcomm Inc.  
was sued by disgruntled employees demanding potentially millions of 
dollars in stock options. 
</P>
<P>
	The class-action suit was filed yesterday. It demands that  
unvested stock options for workers in Qualcomm's infrastructure 
division be immediately vested. It also seeks unspecified damages. 
The total figure could top $50 million, said Richard Williams, an 
attorney for one of the law firms representing the employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Qualcomm stock hit an all-time high last month after the company  
reported strong earnings and the settlement of a long-running 
patent dispute with rival Ericsson of Sweden. Qualcomm announced 
the settlement in March and said it had agreed to sell its 
money-losing infrastructure division to Ericsson. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit involves division employees who will have to give up  
unvested portions of their stock options because of the sale. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas M. Sprague, a Qualcomm vice president and lead plaintiff  
in the suit, said he could lose more than $1 million worth of 
unvested options. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit contends that Qualcomm used lucrative stock options to  
lure recruits even as it negotiated to sell the division. 
</P>
<P>
	Ericsson said Thursday that it will retain 1,280 division  
workers under the deal, which is expected to close May 24. 
</P>
<P>
	Dan Sullivan, Qualcomm's senior vice president of human  
resources, accused some suing employees of wanting to ``double 
dip.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The company and Ericsson have a bonus plan, already signed by  
several hundred workers, that will make several payments to workers 
over two years based on their unvested options. Qualcomm said the 
value is about 20 percent to 50 percent of what the stock is worth 
at current prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Sullivan noted that the company also is keeping transferred  
workers on its payroll through June so that they can continue 
taking part in an employee stock-buying program that offers shares 
for about $43 each -- about five times below Thursday's market 
price. Qualcom fell $8.56 1/4 a share to $216.06 1/4 Thursday in Nasdaq 
Stock Market trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Tony Chartrand, Ericsson's vice president of human resources,  
said that company also will provide a stock-option plan for former 
Qualcomm employees effective Jan. 1, but details are still being 
worked out.

<HEADLINE> McGriff Sets Record at the Jake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Fred McGriff can check Jacobs Field off the  
list. 
</P>
<P>
	McGriff set a major league record by homering in his 34th  
ballpark during the regular season, a two-run shot in the third 
inning at Jacobs Field in the Devil Rays' game against the 
Cleveland Indians on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	McGriff's shot into the right-field stands off Dwight Gooden  
gave him the AL lead with 11 homers, and snapped a tie with Gary 
Gaetti of the Chicago Cubs and Ellis Burks of San Francisco, who 
have both homered in 33 different ballparks during their careers. 
</P>
<P>
	McGriff, who has homered in four straight games, has eight  
homers in his last 10 games. He had been homerless in his first 
five regular-season games at Jacobs Field before connecting off 
Gooden. He did homer here for Atlanta in the 1995 World Series for 
Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	He entered the year needing a home run in Jacobs Field, the new  
Comiskey Park, Camden Yards and The Ballpark at Arlington to have 
at least one home run in every current ballpark. McGriff homered 
earlier this year in Chicago and now only needs a home run in 
Baltimore and Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Noteworthy on McGriff's home run tour are: five home runs in  
Baltimore's old Memorial Stadium; four in Cleveland's Municipal 
Stadium; four each in Denver's Mile High Stadium and Coors Field 
and six in the old Comiskey Park. 
</P>
<P>
	McGriff, who has played five full seasons in the AL and seven in  
the NL, hit his most home runs in Atlanta's Fulton-County Stadium, 
connecting for 58 homers there. He hit 29 homers in Toronto's 
Exhibition Stadium and has 28 in the SkyDome.

<HEADLINE> Bomb Squad Done at Columbine High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- The bomb squad has completed work inside  
Columbine High School and only federal agents are still working at 
the site of a massacre that left 15 people dead. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators discovered nearly 60 bombs at the school,  
Jefferson County sheriff's spokesman Troy Gardalen said Thursday. 
The school, which is closed, will remain a crime scene until the 
end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17, shot and killed 12  
classmates and a teacher on April 20 before killing themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	School district spokesman Rick Kaufman said both gunmen authored  
violent writings in classroom assignments. A creative writing 
teacher was so alarmed by a story submitted by Klebold this 
semester that she spoke to his mother at a parent-teacher 
conference in March. 
</P>
<P>
	``The assignment was violent in nature and included a killing,''  
Kaufman said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Klebold told a guidance counselor it was just a story, Kaufman  
said, and the counselor didn't ``feel he was a threat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kaufman said writings by Harris caught the attention of a  
teacher in an assignment in which students were asked to pretend 
they were an object. 
</P>
<P>
	``(Harris) wrote that he was a shotgun and he fell in love with  
a shotgun shell,'' classmate Rebecca Heins said. 
</P>
<P>
	The teacher told Harris' parents about the bullet story and  
other assignments at a parent-teacher conference this spring. When 
the teacher learned that Harris' father had served in the Air Force 
-- and the younger Harris wanted to go into the service himself -- 
the matter was dropped. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris tried to enlist in the Marines was but was rejected five  
days before the attack because he was reportedly taking a 
medication called Luvox, which is commonly prescribed for 
depression. 
</P>
<P>
	By Thursday, sheriff's investigators had tallied 1,800 leads and  
assigned about 1,400 of them. Nearly 1,000 interviews had been 
conducted. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton has announced that he plans to meet with  
Columbine students and their parents on May 20 in Littleton to 
discuss the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a package containing a ``healing bear'' was delivered  
to Littleton to help comfort the community. The beige bear 
previously comforted mourners in Oklahoma City following the 1995 
bombing of the federal building and in Montoursville, Pa., home to 
victims of the TWA Flight 800 crash.

<HEADLINE> Jones Lawyers Seek Reimbursements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Paula Jones' lawyers are preparing to ask a  
judge to order President Clinton to pay nearly $500,000 in legal 
reimbursements as a penalty for being found in contempt of court in 
her case, legal sources familiar with the proposal said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed penalty was prepared for submission today to U.S.  
District Judge Susan Webber Wright in Little Rock, Ark., who found 
Clinton in contempt for giving intentional, untruthful testimony in 
his January 1998 deposition in the sexual harassment case, the 
sources said, speaking only on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed penalty is about $200,000 more than the amount Mrs.  
Jones' lawyers recently proposed to Clinton's legal team. 
</P>
<P>
	Presidential attorney Robert Bennett dismissed that $300,000  
figure earlier this week as ``outrageous and greedy and, I think, a 
gross misunderstanding of the court's order.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Jones' recommendation was in two filings. The Rutherford  
Institute, a conservative group that paid some of her legal bills, 
this afternoon submitted to the court a reimbursement figure of 
$58,500 for its expenses. The Dallas law firm that represented Mrs. 
Jones for much of the case was submitting a figure of $437,000, the 
sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	The penalty would cover expenses for Mrs. Jones' lawyers and the  
judge's own expenses in attending the Washington deposition -- and 
is not intended as an additional settlement payment to the one-time 
Arkansas state worker. Clinton already has paid her $850,000 to 
settle the case, but admitted no wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	John Whitehead, one of Mrs. Jones' lawyers, said attorneys who  
assisted her were not adequately paid for their work when they 
received portions of a settlement Clinton paid to Mrs. Jones 
earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as being greedy, everyone took far less than what they  
put in,'' Whitehead said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright, in a historic contempt ruling against a president on  
April 12, ordered Clinton to repay her lawyers any ``reasonable 
expenses'' they incurred as a result of Clinton's testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge now must decide whether Mrs. Jones' reimbursement  
request is reasonable and amounts to an adequate penalty for the 
first president ever to be found in contempt of court. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett had signaled that the president would contest any amount  
that approached $300,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Any money Clinton is ordered to reimburse Mrs. Jones for legal  
bills is above and beyond the $850,000 he paid her earlier this 
year to settle her charges that he made an unwanted sexual advance 
at a Little Rock hotel in 1991. At the time, Clinton was Arkansas 
governor. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton denies any wrongdoing and said he settled the sexual  
harassment case, which prompted the disclosure of his affair with 
former White House intern Monica Lewinsky and the subsequent 
impeachment proceedings, simply to bring an end to a public crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright ordered Clinton to pay ``any reasonable expenses,''  
including legal fees incurred by Mrs. Jones as a result of the 
false testimony. The judge also directed Clinton to reimburse the 
court $1,202 for her travel to Washington to preside over the 
taking of the deposition. 
</P>
<P>
	And she referred the matter to the Arkansas Supreme Court's  
Professional Conduct Committee, which has the power to revoke 
Clinton's law license or to impose other sanctions.

<HEADLINE> `Tornado Alley' Rides Out Storms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAYSVILLE, Kan. (AP) -- In the heartland, tornadoes have become  
as deeply ingrained in lore as the region's vast wheat fields. 
</P>
<P>
	People take classes around here to be trained tornado spotters.  
</P>
<P>
	The twisters have forced communities to install warning sirens,  
and many have passed strict laws requiring mobile home parks to 
have storm cellars. No Kansas builder serious about selling a new 
house would leave out a basement. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifty-one people were killed and hundreds more injured when  
tornadoes struck the Plains and South this week. As bad as it was, 
rescue workers were amazed that it wasn't worse. 
</P>
<P>
	As warning sirens wailed across Kansas communities, residents  
huddled in basements under their houses or in tornado shelters at 
their workplaces. Many others were just lucky. 
</P>
<P>
	In Haysville, about 100 workers on the night shift at Norland  
Plastics Co. headed for the company's tornado shelter just minutes 
before Monday's deadly tornado tore through the plant. 
</P>
<P>
	As the death toll mounted in Oklahoma and elsewhere, those  
differences in Kansas may have saved countless lives. 
</P>
<P>
	Basements are much rarer in hard-hit Oklahoma City because the  
region's red clay makes it expensive to put them in. And in 
northern Texas, where the soil is a black ``gumbo,'' many homes are 
built above ground on pier-and-beam foundations or concrete slabs. 
</P>
<P>
	``In Oklahoma and other places, they don't build basements like  
we do,'' said Wess Galyon, president of the Wichita Area Builders 
Association. ``In Kansas, if you don't build a basement, 
particularly in a newer home, that home is not very marketable 
because people want that as a safety net.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the dank, musty cellars of older Kansas homes, today's  
homes have basements built with daylight windows and under more 
rigid standards. 
</P>
<P>
	``Very little of what is built is built without a basement,''  
Galyon said. ``It is almost considered a staple by most home 
purchasers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the deadly 1991 tornado that killed 13 people in a mobile  
home park in Andover near here, many people without basements put 
in storm shelters. 
</P>
<P>
	Five years ago, Wichita amended its mobile home park ordinance  
to require trailer parks with 20 or more homes that did not have a 
shelter to build one by April 15 of this year. The twisters struck 
May 3. 
</P>
<P>
	But storm warnings come often around here and across the rest of  
``Tornado Alley.'' The two people who died at Lakeshore Mobile Home 
Resort this week didn't go to the shelter and were killed in their 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Sherrie Holmes was among those who chose to stay in her mobile  
home at the park. The 56-year-old grandmother ignored telephoned 
pleas from her three children to head for the shelter just minutes 
before the tornado arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have never truly been afraid of storms,'' she said, sitting  
unhurt Friday among the remains of her demolished home. ``Although 
living in a cracker box, it makes me more nervous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said she had plenty of warning to head for shelter when the  
sirens went off. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've ridden storms out before and I chose to ride this one  
out,'' she said. ``I don't think by the grace of God I'm here. It's 
a matter of chance and luck.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rescuers had to pull Stacy Kiefer and her two children, Mariah,  
8, and Shae, 4, from the shattered remains of their mobile home at 
Lakeshore. When the frightened family reached the shelter, only 20 
people were in it. Most chose to seek shelter elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will be much more aware the next time the slightest storm is  
coming,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> OU Sacks Anita Hill Professorship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- The University of Oklahoma is abandoning a  
professorship named for Anita Hill, even though it has never been 
filled. 
</P>
<P>
	Conservatives have been upset that the position, created with a  
$500,000 endowment, was named for the former Oklahoma law professor 
who accused Clarence Thomas of sexual impropriety, almost derailing 
his Supreme Court nomination in 1991.

	On Friday, after the Board of Regents voted to abandon the Hill

	The professorship was intended for someone who has a national

state, Coats said.

<HEADLINE> Woman Sues To Use ' 7 Dirty Words' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- A woman has sued the company that assigns  
U.S. Internet addresses for the right to use George Carlin's 
``seven dirty words.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The federal lawsuit filed by Lynn Haberstroh of Raymond seeks to  
force Network Solutions Inc., a private company that registers the 
most popular Web names under contract from the government, to allow 
her to register those words in addresses. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a well-defined First Amendment right that is being  
violated,'' said Jonathan Springer, Haberstroh's lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	A California company called Seven Words filed a similar lawsuit  
in that state after Haberstroh filed hers in January, Springer said 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
	NSI says it merely is following long-established policy on  
public communication. Carlin's seven words -- from an old comedy 
routine -- describe body parts, functions and sexual acts and are 
banned from the airwaves by the Federal Communications Commission 
as part of court-upheld restrictions on obscenity. 
</P>
<P>
	The words effectively are kept off the air by laws forbidding  
vulgar speech that date at least to the Radio Act of 1927 and which 
were upheld in a $1.7 million FCC fine against radio personality 
Howard Stern in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	NSI, which did not respond to phone messages seeking comment  
Friday, has asked to move Halberstroh's suit to Virginia, where the 
company is based.

<HEADLINE> Albright Defends Holbrooke </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright,  
criticizing a Washington newspaper's account, rejected as ``utter 
nonsense'' Thursday any suggestion that private speech commitments 
by Richard Holbrooke compromised U.S. policy interests. 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke was picked by President Clinton 11 months ago to be  
U.N. ambassador. But the veteran diplomatic troubleshooter's 
nomination wasn't sent to the Senate until three months ago because 
of investigations by the Justice and State Departments into his 
private sector dealings. Hearings on the nomination have not yet 
been scheduled by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	In its editions Thursday, the Washington Times reported that  
Holbrooke was paid $24,000 by the Siemens AG electronics for a 
speech last Oct. 13. That same day negotiations in Belgrade, 
Yugoslavia, between Holbrooke and Yugoslav President Slobodon 
Milosevic produced an agreement, later broken, on Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	The front-page article quoted James P. Foley, the deputy  
spokesman for the State Department, as saying Wednesday that 
Holbrooke had canceled the New York speech. 
</P>
<P>
	The Times, however, produced a copy of a financial disclosure  
form Holbrooke signed last Jan. 26 saying he received $24,000 in 
``speaking fees'' from Siemens for the Oct. 13 speech. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright, in a statement issued Thursday night, said the  
newspaper had run articles about Holbrooke ``that are both unfair 
and grossly misleading in their implications.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Any suggestion that U.S. policy interests might somehow have  
been compromised by personal commitments on his part is utter 
nonsense and reflects both misunderstanding of the specific facts 
and a gross misunderstanding of how diplomacy works,'' Albright 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said in a letter  
Thursday to Times Editor Wesley Pruden that Holbrooke had canceled 
the Siemens speech on Oct. 9, and that it was ``inadvertently 
reflected'' in his January financial disclosure statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin said the disclosure statement was amended two weeks ago  
``to reflect the fact that the speech was neither given nor paid 
for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pruden said Thursday night that his newspaper's articles about  
Holbrooke ``clearly and accurately reflected the facts, in all 
their particulars, available to us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said Holbrooke's amended disclosure statement ``was not  
available to us before Thursday night'' and that the newspaper 
repeatedly had tried to reach Holbrooke and Rubin's deputies on 
Wednesday and Thursday to explain the discrepancies.

<HEADLINE> Airline Passenger Pleads Guilty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BANGOR, Maine (AP) -- A British man accused of shattering a  
window on a jetliner and threatening other passengers during a 
drunken rage has pleaded guilty to a felony charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Bryan J. Neal, whose inflight antics earlier this week forced  
the jet to land in Maine, pleaded guilty in federal court Thursday 
to interference with a flight crew. 
</P>
<P>
	Neal became belligerent while on board an Airtours International  
Airways charter flight from Orlando, Fla., to Manchester, England, 
on Monday evening, police and airline officials said. The pilot 
diverted the Boeing 767, which carried 205 passengers, to Bangor 
International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	According to an FBI affidavit, a drunken Neal, 25, broke an  
interior window of the plane and threatened to break the exterior 
window, telling screaming passengers that they would ``get sucked 
out and die.'' Neal also shattered a video screen in front of his 
seat and assaulted a passenger who attempted to intervene, the 
affidavit said. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilot was forced to lock the cockpit door to keep Neal out.  
</P>
<P>
	Neal will likely be sentenced to up to six months behind bars  
and be ordered to pay restitution to the airline, Assistant U.S. 
Attorney Gail Malone said. The offense is punishable by up to 20 
years in prison and a $250,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
	Before entering his plea, a somber Neal told the judge Thursday  
he was intoxicated and couldn't recall his actions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't remember any of it, to be honest,'' Neal said.  
</P>
<P>
	Neal also faces state misdemeanor charges of disorderly conduct  
and failure to submit to arrest. Those charges were based on Neal's 
actions after the plane landed, authorities said.

<HEADLINE> Abortion Foe Charged in Slaying </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Dr. Barnett Slepian, just back from  
synagogue, was heating soup in his kitchen last fall when he was 
gunned down with a single shot through a window. 
</P>
<P>
	Slepian's killer is still at large. But for the first time,  
authorities have named a suspect in the slaying -- anti-abortion 
activist James Kopp. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today, I'm here to tell you we have our suspect,'' said  
Bernard Tolbert, special agent-in-charge of the FBI's Buffalo 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	Kopp, 44, of St. Albans, Vt., became the subject of an  
international manhunt in November when he was called a witness in 
the case. He was charged Thursday in state and federal complaints 
with second-degree murder and with violating the Freedom of Access 
to Clinic Entrances Act by using deadly force against an abortion 
doctor. 
</P>
<P>
	Both charges carry a penalty of up to life in prison. The  
federal charge also carries a fine of up to $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Kopp's whereabouts remain unknown. He was last seen Nov. 3, the  
day before authorities issued a material witness warrant in the 
Slepian shooting in the hope of questioning him. Until Thursday, 
they had not called Kopp a suspect. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators would not divulge the evidence against Kopp but  
said last month's discovery of a scope-equipped rifle buried near 
the Slepian home represented a major breakthrough. Slepian, 52, was 
shot with a rifle. 
</P>
<P>
	Kopp also has been linked, through DNA testing, to a strand of  
hair found near where the sniper fired, law enforcement sources 
have said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicknamed the ``Atomic Dog'' in anti-abortion circles, Kopp had  
been arrested in several states since 1990 for protesting abortion. 
His car was spotted in Slepian's neighborhood in the weeks before 
the shooting, and was found abandoned at the Newark, N.J., airport 
in December. 
</P>
<P>
	The filing of the charges has intensified interest in Kopp as a  
suspect in three non-fatal sniper attacks on Canadian abortion 
providers, and one near Rochester, N.Y., between 1994 and 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Kopp is now the second anti-abortion activist being sought by  
the FBI as a suspect in a fatal attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Rudolph has been on the run since the January 1998 bombing  
of a Birmingham, Ala., abortion clinic that killed an off-duty 
police officer and maimed a nurse. He also is charged in three 
Atlanta attacks, including the 1996 Olympic bombing that killed one 
person.

<HEADLINE> Don't Blink, It's NBA Playoff Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The hectic regular season is over. Well, at least the regular  
season is over. The hectic part remains. 
</P>
<P>
	Less than 72 hours after the post-lockout, 50-game sprint  
reached the finish line, the postseason will begin. Four games are 
scheduled Saturday, including one involving a team -- the Detroit 
Pistons -- who have barely had a moment to catch their breath. 
</P>
<P>
	After playing an overtime game Wednesday night at Philadelphia  
and returning to Detroit in the wee hours Thursday, the Pistons 
turned right around and practiced Friday morning before traveling 
to Atlanta for Saturday's Game 1 of a best-of-5 series against the 
Hawks. 
</P>
<P>
	Also beginning Saturday are New York-Miami, Sacramento-Utah and  
Phoenix-Portland. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's games are Philadelphia-Orlando, Minnesota-San Antonio,  
Houston-L.A. Lakers and Milwaukee-Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
	No team's schedule over the past couple days has been as hectic  
as Detroit's. The Indiana Pacers, for instance, did not play 
Wednesday night, practiced Thursday and Friday and plan to practice 
again Saturday before opening their series against the Bucks at 
Market Square Arena on Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's where the homecourt (advantage) really, I think, helps  
out these teams early, is that it's a travel day that they don't 
have to throw in,'' NBC analyst Doug Collins said. ``And I think 
that's vital. When you don't have the preparation time, it really 
limits how much you can get involved with your team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Don't expect a high-scoring Pistons-Hawks series. The Hawks  
allowed only 83.4 points per game -- lowest in the league -- while 
the Pistons also ranked among the defensive leaders at 86.9. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're a good defensive team,'' coach Lenny Wilkens said.  
``Offensively, we've got to move the ball. We don't have a 
superstar like Shaq (Shaquille O'Neal) that we can throw it to. Our 
shot selection has to be good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the series goes beyond Game 3, both teams will be scrambling  
to find a home court. 
</P>
<P>
	The Palace of Auburn Hills is booked for a sold-out rock concert  
on May 14, the same day the Pistons are scheduled to play host to 
Game 4. Other possible sites are the Pontiac Silverdome and Joe 
Louis Arena in downtown Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	If the series returns to Atlanta for Game 5 on May 16, it  
probably will be played at Georgia Tech's 9,300-seat coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
	An oldies concert will be held at the Georgia Dome on May 15,  
and officials say it would be too difficult to convert the building 
back to basketball for a game the following day. 
</P>
<P>
	The first game of them all will be Knicks-Heat on Saturday  
afternoon, and the question on everyone's mind is whether the teams 
will rumble again. In 1997 and 1998, fights changed the outcome of 
two New York-Miami series. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't be surprised if there was a physical confrontation  
-- pushing and shoving,'' Miami coach Pat Riley said. ``But I'd be 
surprised if it went beyond that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York's Patrick Ewing appears ready to go for Saturday's  
opener, although his sore left Achilles' tendon will be a question 
throughout the series. The 7-footer took part in Friday's one-hour 
practice before the Knicks left for South Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	``For what he did, he looked all right,'' Knicks coach Jeff Van  
Gundy said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Kings-Jazz series, the most intriguing matchup is at  
point guard with flashy rookie Jason Williams going against Utah 
stalwart John Stockton. 
</P>
<P>
	Stockton is the key to Utah's businesslike approach, while  
Sacramento's high-flying offensive show revolves around Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	``You play the game a different way if you came up when John and  
I did,'' Karl Malone said. ``We grew up with strong coaches and 
different players to look up to than the guys do now. It's a very 
different time, and you can see that when John plays some of the 
younger kids.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for Phoenix-Portland, the teams have been fixtures in the  
playoffs throughout this decade, the Blazers making the postseason 
17 straight times and Phoenix 11. The last time they met, the Suns 
won 3-0 in a 1995 first-round series. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blazers have lost in the first round of the playoffs the  
last six years, but they didn't have homecourt advantage in any of 
those series. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now it's a sense of urgency,'' Rider said. It's a sense of, we  
want to win, rather than we're happy to be here. Now we realize 
that we're favored to win. We're supposed to win. So it's time to 
take care of business.''

<HEADLINE> No Charges for Police Shooters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIVERSIDE, Calif. (AP) -- Four police officers acted in haste and  
in error, but were justified in shooting an unresponsive, armed 
young black woman found sitting in a car, the district attorney 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The death of Tyisha Miller, 19, in December led to allegations  
that the officers -- three whites and a Hispanic -- were racists. 
Religious leaders, civil rights activists and residents of 
Riverside, 60 miles east of Los Angeles, protested the shooting at 
town hall meetings, vigils and marches. 
</P>
<P>
	District Attorney Grover Trask said Thursday the officers may  
have acted hastily and made mistakes in judgment, but they did not 
act criminally. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller's relatives were angry with the decision.  
</P>
<P>
	``It is sickening and it is sad,'' said the Rev. Bernell Butler,  
a cousin. ``Police officers are able to murder and get away with 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Miller had pulled into a gas station parking lot with a flat  
tire. Relatives who arrived to help her said they called police 
after Ms. Miller appeared to be having a seizure and was foaming at 
the mouth. 
</P>
<P>
	The officers found the car still running, with the radio and  
lights on. Inside, Ms. Miller was unresponsive, lying on the fully 
reclined driver's seat with a gun in her lap. The officers were 
unable to awaken her by banging on the windows, shining lights or 
shaking the car, Trask said. 
</P>
<P>
	When an officer tried to break the driver's side window with a  
baton and reach for the gun, Ms. Miller sat up, lifted a pager and 
stared at the cop, who backed away, Trask said. 
</P>
<P>
	One officer yelled at the others to hold their fire, and the  
woman lay down again, Trask said. When she rose up again and 
appeared to reach for the gun, the officers all fired, the 
prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
	Family members contend she remained unconscious throughout and  
never reached for the gun. 
</P>
<P>
	A coroner's report indicated all the bullets entered her body  
from the back, proving that she was not lying down when she was 
shot, Trask said. Her loaded gun was never fired. Ms. Miller was 
hit by 12 of the 23 bullets. Four struck her in the head. 
</P>
<P>
	Toxicology tests showed Ms. Miller had a blood-alcohol level of  
.13 percent. A driver in California is legally intoxicated at .08 
percent. Tests also detected marijuana residue. 
</P>
<P>
	The officers' plan to break in the window of her locked car to  
get the gun out of her lap may have been a mistake, but did not 
reach the level of criminal conduct, Trask said. ``It was a 
judgment call and it was probably a mistake in their judgment,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Sacramento, Attorney General Bill Lockyer endorsed Trask's  
decision, but said he would investigate reports of ``racial 
insensitivity and even racial hostility'' within the Riverside 
Police Department.

<HEADLINE> Viacom Files To Float Chain Shares </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Viacom Inc. has taken the first step toward  
spinning off the Blockbuster video rental chain in its latest 
effort to sell off assets and focus on its core entertainment 
properties like MTV and VH1. 
</P>
<P>
	In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission  
Thursday, Viacom applied for permission to sell shares of 
Blockbuster, which with 6,500 stores is the nation's leading video 
rental company. 
</P>
<P>
	Viacom paid $8.5 billion in stock for Blockbuster five years ago  
as part of a heated takeover battle for the Paramount movie studio. 
Viacom needed the cash generated by Blockbuster in order to pay 
down the debt it incurred in the Paramount purchase. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, Viacom chairman Sumner Redstone has sold off a  
number of other assets in order to tighten the company's focus on 
its successful entertainment businesses and pay down debt. 
</P>
<P>
	While many details of the Blockbuster deal have yet to be worked  
out, the video chain has long been expected to be the next Viacom 
asset to go on the block. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year Viacom sold most of the Simon &AMP; Schuster publishing  
house to British media group Pearson, and it has also shed 
interests in the USA network, Madison Square Garden in New York and 
several radio properties. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street analysts have welcomed Viacom's efforts to focus on  
its strengths. In addition to its strong TV networks and the 
successful Paramount studio, Viacom also owns about 80 percent of 
Spelling Entertainment Group, a successful TV production company 
whose hits include ``Melrose Place'' and ``Beverly Hills 90210.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The last step is now to separate Blockbuster and let Viacom  
focus on being a media conglomerate,'' said Rob Donahue, portfolio 
manager and media analyst at Salomon Brothers Asset Management. 
``Viacom will be a steady, high-growing media business.''

<HEADLINE> Champion Bull Rider Back in Saddle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARCHDALE, N.C. (AP) -- Doctors said Jerome Davis would never ride  
again after a bull slung him on his head, shattering his spine and 
paralyzing him. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, with the help of a special saddle, the champion bull  
rider is back on a stallion -- even though he still can't walk and 
struggles to feed himself. 
</P>
<P>
	His doctors haven't been told.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't tell them everything,'' he says, cutting a sly grin.  
``I'm going to do what I want to do. Besides, what are they going 
to do, tell me they want to stop taking my money? I don't think 
so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The saddle is the most familiar place on earth to Davis, who sat  
on his first horse when he was 2 months old, broke his first bronco 
when he turned 11 and won his first national bull-riding event at 
16. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis yearned to become the world's best bull rider and at 22,  
he did just that, riding nine out of the sport's 10 most menacing 
bulls at the 1995 national finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Then on March 14, 1998, at an arena in Fort Worth, Texas, Davis  
was paralyzed when a bull threw him. 
</P>
<P>
	He swore he'd ride again -- if not bulls, then horses.  
</P>
<P>
	``A stallion,'' says his wife, Tiffany. ``It had to be a  
stallion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And so, a little more than a year after his crippling fall, just  
as he vowed, Davis rides a stallion named Chief. With the help of a 
special saddle equipped with a back brace, the 26-year-old cowboy 
and Chief wander his farm's arena, survey nearby hayfields and 
watch for mares. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis and his wife were married in October. They live in a  
100-year-old farmhouse on his grandfather's old ranch. Together, 
the two of them run a 100-acre farm, manage 200 head of bucking 
bulls, and put on rodeo events around the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Most days, wearing his world championship belt buckle, Davis  
cruises the farm on a specially equipped four-wheeler or a 
heavy-duty wheelchair. He herds bulls and cuts deals by phone that 
send his herd to rodeos around the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tell him he's the busiest crippled man I've ever seen in my  
life,'' Mrs. Davis jokes. ``I figured life would slow down a bit 
when this happened, but no, not Jerome.''

	'Jenny Jones Show' Found Negligent  
</P>
<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- A jury decided today that ``The Jenny  
Jones Show'' was negligent in the slaying of a gay guest and the 
producers should pay more than $25 million in damages. Scott 
Amedure died in 1995, three days after revealing a secret crush on 
Jonathan Schmitz during a taping of the show. Amedure's family 
contends a mentally ill Schmitz was lured onto the show believing 
he would meet a woman, and was humiliated into murder when his 
secret admirer turned out to be Amedure. Attorney Geoffrey Fieger, 
who represents Amedure's family, asked the jury to find the show 
and its corporate owner, Warner Bros., liable for Amedure's death.

judge to order President Clinton to pay nearly $400,000 in legal 
reimbursements as a penalty for being found in contempt of court in 
her case, legal sources familiar with the proposal said today. The 
proposed penalty was prepared for submission today to U.S. District 
Judge Susan Webber Wright in Little Rock, Ark., who found Clinton 
in contempt for giving intentional, untruthful testimony in his 
January 1998 deposition in the sexual harassment case, the sources 
said, speaking only on condition of anonymity.

	Italy: Yugoslavia Ready for Talks  
</P>
<P>
	ROME (AP) -- Belgrade's decision to allow Kosovo's best-known  
ethnic Albanian leader into Italy indicates the Yugoslav leadership 
is ready to begin negotiations to end NATO's bombing campaign, 
Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini said today. Ibrahim Rugova, 
who had been kept under virtual house arrest in Yugoslavia since 
March 24, unexpectedly arrived Wednesday in Rome. At a news 
conference yesterday, Rugova called for NATO forces to be part of 
any international peacekeeping force deployed in the province. NATO 
jets struck overnight in Yugoslavia, hitting the airport in Nis, 
Serbia's second-largest city, and the city's industrial zone.

	Macedonian Border Remains Closed

<P>
	BLACE, Macedonia (AP) -- With Macedonia's main border posts  
closed to Kosovo refugees, hundreds of ethnic Albanians have turned 
to mountain routes across a harsh frontier dotted with land mines, 
officials said today. ``It's a dangerous place... if we have a lot 
of people going over this way, it could pose some serious 
problems,'' said Red Redmond, a spokesman for the U.N. High 
Commissioner for Refugees. Macedonian authorities blame Western 
nations for allowing more than a quarter-million people to 
overwhelm the nation, slightly larger than Vermont.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Reports this morning say Monica Lewinsky will  
appear on tomorrow's ``Saturday Night Live.'' Both the New York 
Daily News and the New York Post say Lewinsky was spotted at NBC 
rehearsing for the show. In the rehearsal, Ms. Lewinsky was 
reportedly making jokes about dating and phone sex with William 
Howard Taft, president from 1909-1913. The network refused to 
comment. ``The only thing I know for sure is that Cuba Gooding Jr. 
is the host and Ricky Martin is the musical guest,'' an NBC 
spokesman said today.

	Unemployment Edges Up to 4.3 Pct.  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's unemployment rate edged up  
slightly to 4.3 percent in April as the loss in U.S. manufacturing 
jobs since the start of the global financial crisis climbed above 
400,000. The Labor Department said the April 4.3 percent 
unemployment rate was only slightly higher than the 29-year-low of 
4.2 percent reached in March. The nation's unemployment rate has 
been at or below 4.5 percent for the past 12 months, the best 
showing in three decades.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Leon Hess, the oil tycoon and paternalistic  
owner of the New York Jets who longed to see his team return to the 
Super Bowl one last time, died today at age 85. Hess died at Lenox 
Hill Hospital of a blood disease, the team said. He had been 
hospitalized with a broken hip last month and discharged, but he 
re-entered the hospital about four weeks ago. Hess, one of the 
wealthiest and most reticent owners in professional sports, made 
his fortune in oil.

	Mistrial in Julie Hiatt Steele Case  
</P>
<P>
	ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) -- With jurors hopelessly deadlocked, a  
judge declared a mistrial today in the case of a woman charged with 
obstructing Kenneth Starr's investigation of President Clinton by 
giving false testimony. After more than eight hours of 
deliberation, the foreman said jurors were deadlocked on all four 
charges against Julie Hiatt Steele. ``I will then declare a 
mistrial in this case,'' said U.S. District Judge Claude Hilton. 
Ms. Steele was charged with lying in grand jury testimony that 
undercut her one-time friend Kathleen Willey's allegation of an 
unwanted sexual advance by Clinton. Clinton has denied the 
allegation.

	Milosevic Opens Door to Peace Deal

	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Yugoslavia signaled today its  
eventual acceptance of a new peace plan agreed to by Russian and 
Western powers, but the state-controlled media predicted the 
negotiating process could be very lengthy and insisted NATO first 
stop its airstrikes. U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott 
is to travel to Moscow soon for more talks with top Russian 
officials. Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic has not accepted 
the presence of armed forces on Yugoslav territory, while Russia

differently.

The surge outside manufacturing helped push the unemployment rate 
among blacks down to its lowest level on record, although the 
overall national rate edged up to 4.3 percent. For a year now, 
unemployment has held below 4.5 percent, as the country's longest

<HEADLINE> Unemployment Edges Up to 4.3 Pct. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's unemployment rate edged up  
slightly to 4.3 percent in April as manufacturing continued to be 
battered by the global economic crisis. But a flood of new jobs in 
service industries helped to push the unemployment rate among 
blacks to the lowest level on record. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department said April's overall jobless rate was only  
slightly above the 29-year-low of 4.2 percent reached in March as 
the U.S. economy continues to confound the experts, forging ahead 
with powerful growth in the midst of all the overseas turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
	The record expansion, now the longest in peacetime history, has  
meant more job opportunities for minority groups. The unemployment 
rate for blacks fell to 7.7 percent in April, down from 8.1 percent 
in March. That was the lowest percentage for blacks since the 
government began tracking this data in 1972, although the rate was 
still double the 3.8 percent unemployment rate for whites. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton, who hopes the good economy will persuade  
voters next year to keep a Democrat in the White House, called the 
overall report ``good news for our working families.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's unemployment rate has been at or below 4.5 percent  
for the past 12 months, the best showing in three decades, despite 
the troubles being suffering by manufacturers and farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	Job creation actually accelerated sharply in April as the losses  
in manufacturing were more than offset by big gains in a number of 
service industries from office workers to restaurant employees. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, payroll jobs shot up 234,000 in April after inching up  
only by 7,000 jobs in March, which had been the weakest monthly 
increase in more than three years. 
</P>
<P>
	The unemployment rate, which is based on a separate survey of  
households, rose in April because while jobs were up, the number of 
people entering the work force looking for employment grew more 
rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said on Wednesday that  
the U.S. economy is enjoying a ``phenomenal'' performance of rapid 
growth and low unemployment existing along with low inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	But Greenspan's remarks shook up Wall Street because he warned  
that imbalances reflected by tight labor markets were likely to 
trigger wage pressures and higher inflation down the road. 
</P>
<P>
	However, markets rallied today immediately after the job report  
was released because it showed average hourly earnings were up only 
3.2 percent over the past 12 months, an even better showing than 
the previous month. 
</P>
<P>
	The inflation-sensitive bond markets initally rallied on the  
figures, pushing down long-term Treasury bond yields after hitting 
levels last seen in June 1998 on Greenspan's worries about tight 
labor markets the day before. But rates crept back up by early 
afternoon. The Dow Jones industrial average was up about 10 points 
in early afternoon trading. 
</P>
<P>
	``Greenspan touched on the potential for higher wage and price  
inflation coming from tight labor markets but there is no evidence 
of that happening in this report,'' said Paul Kasriel, economist at 
Northern Trust Co. in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Most economists don't believe the Fed will move at its next  
meeting May 18 to increase interest rates and many believe the 
central bank could remain on hold until perhaps the last three 
months of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	The April unemployment report showed that jobs in manufacturing  
fell by another 29,000, bringing total job losses at American 
factories since March of last year to 402,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The severe currency crises that have pushed one-third of the  
global economy into recession have cut sharply into American export 
markets and caused the U.S. trade deficit to soar to a record $169 
billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The weakness in manufacturing included a drop of 7,000 jobs  
because of a strike in ship building. Other manufacturing 
industries shedding jobs last month were in aircraft, industrial 
machinery, textiles and fabricated metals such as steel. 
</P>
<P>
	Jobs in mining fell by another 6,000 last month, reflecting  
primarily cutbacks in oil and gas drilling. 
</P>
<P>
	This weakness was offset, however, by a huge surge of 131,000  
new service sector jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Employment for business services climbed by 51,000 while  
temporary help firms added 18,000 jobs. Jobs in the health care 
industry rose by 23,000 while restaurants and bars added 64,000 
jobs.

<HEADLINE> Europe: Dollar Mixed; Gold Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The U.S. dollar was mixed today against most major  
currencies in European trading. Gold prices fell. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar fell to 120.58 Japanese yen from 120.82 yen late  
Thursday, and was lower against the euro, the currency of 11 
European nations which rose to $1.0810 from $1.0806. 
</P>
<P>
	But the dollar rose against the British pound, which fell to  
$1.6340 from $1.6408. It also rose to 1.4869 Swiss francs from 
1.4853, and to 1.4580 Canadian dollars from 1.4494. 
</P>
<P>
	At midday in New York, the dollar was quoted at 120.65 yen and  
1.4895 Swiss francs. The euro was quoted at $1.0790 and the British 
pound at $1.6365 in midday dealings in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately, though they remain in use. Based on euro 
rates in Europe, the dollar was worth 1.8093 German marks, down 
from 1.8099; 6.0681 French francs, down from 6.0703; 2.0386 Dutch 
guilders, down from 2.0393, and 1,791.18 Italian lire, down from 
1,791.85. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold closed in London at $282.40 per troy ounce, down from  
$288.45 on Thursday. In Zurich the bid was $280.35, down from 
$288.35. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold fell $3.40 in Hong Kong to close at $284.95.

<HEADLINE> Shaq Pays Hakeem a Tall Compliment  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- Shaquille O'Neal thinks the NBA's  
finest center will be playing at the Forum on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	No, he isn't thumping his chest. The player in question is  
Hakeem Olajuwon. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a great player, he's still the best center in the  
league,'' O'Neal said as the Los Angeles Lakers prepared for the 
Houston Rockets in the opening playoff round. ``He's always been 
the best center. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hakeem has a lot of moves on each block. Not too many big men  
can do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So, at 36 and in his 15th NBA season, Olajuwon is better than  
the 27-year-old O'Neal? 
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah,'' O'Neal replied. ``Way better. I'm not in my prime yet.  
The system holds me back. I'm before my time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Olajuwon led the Rockets to championships in 1994 and 1995,  
winning the NBA Finals MVP award both times. 
</P>
<P>
	He's the 11th-leading scorer and 13th-leading rebounder in NBA  
history and ranks sixth in steals. 
</P>
<P>
	Olajuwon knows he's going to have his hands full with O'Neal,  
too. 
</P>
<P>
	``What you see is the constant development each year,'' Olajuwon  
said. ``He is more confident now, he's getting stronger and he's 
really coming into his own. I'll work (against O'Neal) from a team 
frame. I am more effective that way. I won't try to force 
anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said rookie Houston guard Cuttino Mobley: ``I love Shaq, he's a  
horse. It's unfair that he gets to play and have all those other 
players, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockets and Lakers have many similarities entering their  
best-of-5 series, which starts with games at the Forum on Sunday 
and Tuesday night before moving to Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	For one thing, both completed the abbreviated regular season  
with 31-19 records. The Lakers, seeded fourth in the Western 
Conference, got home-court advantage by virtue of a 2-1 record 
against the Rockets, who are seeded fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	For another, both finished with winning streaks after losing six  
of eight games -- the Rockets won their last three games while the 
Lakers won their final four. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't play hard,'' O'Neal said. ``Only a couple teams beat  
us. The rest of the games, we beat ourselves, not playing hard, not 
doing the little things. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now's a good time for us to be playing our best ball.''  
</P>
<P>
	The last two Los Angeles losses were ugly -- 108-81 at San  
Antonio on April 24 and 102-80 at Houston two days later. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston, meanwhile, lost home games to lowly Dallas on April 21  
and 29 during their slump. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we can put any problems we had in the past,'' said  
Scottie Pippen, who helped the Chicago Bulls win six championships 
in the last eight seasons. ``Once the playoffs start, it's another 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Being a veteran team as we are, we know how to play in the  
playoffs. We are going in on a high note. We know they will be a 
totally different atmosphere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Each team has three high-profile players -- Olajuwon, Pippen and  
Charles Barkley on one side, and O'Neal, Kobe Bryant and Glen Rice 
on the other. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a big challenge, to go up against three of the best of  
all time,'' said the 20-year-old Bryant, who averaged 19.9 points a 
game this season. ``You've got to pay attention to all of them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockets have the same task, and Rice served notice he's  
primed for the playoffs with a season-high 40-point performance in 
a 119-91 victory over Portland in the regular-season finale. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neal was the NBA's second-leading scorer with a 26.3-point  
average and Rice averaged 17.5 points. For the Rockets, Olajuwon 
averaged 18.9 points, Barkley averaged 16.1, and Pippen averaged 
14.5. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's 5-on-5, not 3-on-3,'' O'Neal said. ``We certainly can't  
let all those (three) guys get off. We just have to play good team 
defense. We've got to scramble, we've scrambled pretty good these 
last few games.''

<HEADLINE> Alcoa Board Elects New Leadership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Alcoa's board of directors elected Alain J.P.  
Belda to replace Paul O'Neill as president and chief executive, 
completing a transition first announced at the aluminum maker's 
shareholders meeting last year. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neill, 63, will continue as chairman of Alcoa's board, but  
Belda will take that position as well in December 2000, when 
O'Neill is scheduled to retire. 
</P>
<P>
	Belda, 55, a board member at Citigroup, is a native of Brazil  
who joined Alcoa thirty years ago at Alcoa Alumino, the company's 
Brazilian affiliate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Alain Belda will be an exceptional chief executive officer  
taking Alcoa into the 21st century. He has extraordinary energy, 
strong values, is globally astute, and is committed to continuing 
the strong operating performance of Alcoa,'' O'Neill said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Belda was named president of Alcoa Alumino in 1979 and later  
assumed responsibility for Alcoa's entire Latin American 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	He moved to Pittsburgh in 1984 as executive vice president, and  
was elected vice chairman in 1995 and president and chief operating 
officer in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Jets Owner Leon Hess Dies at 85 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Leon Hess, the oil tycoon and New York Jets  
owner whose 30-year wait to see his team return to the Super Bowl 
nearly ended last season, died Friday at 85. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jets said Hess died at Lenox Hill Hospital from  
complications of a blood disease. He was hospitalized last month 
with a broken hip. 
</P>
<P>
	``Leon Hess was a great American success story,'' NFL  
commissioner Paul Tagliabue said. ``There will be a terrible void 
as the Jets pursue their dream of another Super Bowl.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hess, quiet and low key and one of the wealthiest owners in  
sports, had been waiting since 1969 for that chance. The Jets, then 
part of the American Football League, jolted the NFL's Baltimore 
Colts in a landmark victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall of Fame quarterback Joe Namath had guaranteed a Jets'  
victory over the Colts in Super Bowl III. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never seen him in any other light than caring,'' Namath  
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, Hess felt greater urgency for another  
championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm 80 years old. I want results now,'' he said when he hired  
coach Rich Kotite in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	After a 4-28 record in two seasons, Kotite was succeeded by Bill  
Parcells. In his second season, Parcells got the Jets within a 
victory of the Super Bowl. They lost to the Denver Broncos in the 
AFC championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	Jets star Keyshawn Johnson recalled seeing Hess after that loss.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure nobody will forget him standing there when we came  
off the plane and thanking us,'' Johnson said. ``That meant a 
lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hess was the fourth major New York sports figure to die in the  
last six months. Weeb Ewbank, who coached the 1969 team, died in 
November, as did former Knicks coach Red Holzman. Baseball great 
Joe DiMaggio died in March. 
</P>
<P>
	Jets president Steve Gutman called Hess a decisive man who  
wouldn't interfere with those he hired. 
</P>
<P>
	``When Bill Parcells was hired, you recall Leon saying, `You're  
the man, one voice, one spokesman. It's yours to run as if you own 
it,''' Gutman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Parcells regrets Hess won't be able to watch the team he said.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm saddened by the loss of this great man who had such a  
quiet dignity,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jets were Hess' greatest passion after he stepped down four  
years ago as chief executive officer of Amerada Hess Corp. Hess 
started in the oil business in 1933, taking over the one-truck 
delivery service his Russian-immigrant father operated in Asbury 
Park, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody was broke in those days,'' Hess said. ``I had to pay  
for the truck before I delivered the oil.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hess won a battle with Phillips Petroleum, and bought Amerada in  
1969. Last year, Forbes magazine listed his the net worth at $720 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite his demeanor, Hess was a driven man, whether he was  
digging up and selling clams along the New Jersey shore during the 
Depression or negotiating an oil deal. 
</P>
<P>
	He rarely spoke about himself, but on the day he hired Parcells  
from New England, Hess was asked about negotiating with demanding 
Patriots owner Robert Kraft. 
</P>
<P>
	Hess recalled an encounter over oil prices with Moammar Gadhafi.  
The Libyan strongman watched as an associate in fatigues pounded on 
a table, removed a pistol from a holster and placed it the table. 
</P>
<P>
	``That doesn't scare me,'' Hess said.  
</P>
<P>
	Neither did the prospect of buying into the moribund New York  
Titans in 1963. The next season, they became the Jets, and in 1977 
he bought out his partners, notably Sonny Werblin and Phil Iselin. 
</P>
<P>
	Hess was known as a generous owner who promoted a family  
atmosphere for his team. When Dennis Byrd was temporarily paralyzed 
in 1992, Hess offered financial and medical support. 
</P>
<P>
	``To him, I owe everything,'' Byrd said.  
</P>
<P>
	On league matters, Hess most often sided with other seniors  
owners such as Wellington Mara of the Giants, Ralph Wilson of the 
Buffalo Bills and Art Modell of the Baltimore Ravens. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a sad, sad day for the National Football League and my  
family,'' said Modell, who angered Hess when he moved the Cleveland 
Browns to Baltimore in 1996. ``The NFL is not as decent ... as it 
was yesterday because of the passing of Leon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mara, who shared Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J., with  
Hess, called him a devoted family man. 
</P>
<P>
	``The NFL has lost one of its most beloved and respected  
leaders,'' Mara said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will miss him very much as a colleague, but even more so as  
a close longtime friend,'' Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerry Jones of the Dallas Cowboys, who represented the new breed  
of owners, called Hess a ``peer of mine and someone who I admired 
as one of the great American businessmen of our time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hess is survived by his wife of 51 years, Norma; son John, who  
succeeded him as CEO of Amerada Hess Corp; two daughters, Connie 
Williams, a state representative in Pennsylvania, and Marlene Hess; 
and seven grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
	The funeral is Monday at Park Avenue Synagogue in Manhattan.

<HEADLINE> Post-Jordan Playoffs Set To Begin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Nine out of 10 people probably think that Michael Jordan made  
the last shot of last year's NBA playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's probably right, yeah,'' said John Stockton, who  
remembers better than most what everyone else has forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Stockton, not Jordan, who took the last shot last June.  
And unlike Jordan's famous final attempt, Stockton's didn't go in. 
</P>
<P>
	``That wouldn't have won the series, but it would have given us  
another chance to win the championship -- which is a lot better than 
the way it turned out,'' Stockton said. ``I liked our chances in 
the next game, but that's easy to say now. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's over with, and it won't do much good to dwell on it. I  
had an opportunity to make the shot and it didn't quite go. But I'd 
take it again if it happened again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stockton and his running mate, Karl Malone, are a long way from  
having it happen again. It'll take 11 wins before they can reach 
the finals again to have another chance to capture the title that 
has eluded them throughout their otherwise stellar careers. 
</P>
<P>
	Another year older, with Stockton, Malone and Jeff Hornacek on  
the last years of their contracts and no longer the No. 1 seeded 
team in the West, the Jazz will have to work their way through a 
postseason that looks an awful lot different than it did last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The absence of Jordan, of course, is the biggest change of all.  
</P>
<P>
	But scattered throughout both conferences are a number of  
younger, quicker teams who believe their chances are as good as 
anyone's in this first year of the post-Jordan era. One of those 
teams is Utah's first-round opponent, the Sacramento Kings -- the 
highest scoring team in the NBA this season and one of the most fun 
to watch. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got a lot of respect for that team and what they're  
doing out there,'' coach Jerry Sloan said. ``They're trying to 
build a winner, and that's something we can understand in our 
organization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Kings and Jazz open their best-of-5 first-round series on  
Saturday -- one of four series that begin that day. The Heat and 
Knicks renew their rivalry in the day's first game, and the other 
matchups are Phoenix-Portland and Detroit-Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	The other four series -- Philadelphia-Orlando, Minnesota-San  
Antonio, Houston-L.A. Lakers and Milwaukee-Indiana -- begin Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	All around the league, players and coaches are eagerly awaiting  
a chance to head into the postseason knowing that Jordan and the 
Bulls no longer stand in the way. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll miss it,'' said Scottie Pippen, who moved on to the  
Rockets in the breakup of the Bulls that commenced when the lockout 
ended in January. ``It certainly feels different this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ``it'' team right now is the San Antonio Spurs, whose  
reputation for softness melted away this season as the team brought 
in playoff-tested veterans Kerr, Jerome Kersey and Mario Elie. 
</P>
<P>
	``This team is farther along than any team I've ever been on,''  
said David Robinson, a 10-year veteran. ``So I'm excited.'' 
</P>
<P>
	San Antonio ended the season with victories in 31 of its final  
36 games to win the No. 1 seed in the West and homecourt advantage 
throughout the postseason. With Tim Duncan a year older and now the 
No. 1 option on offense, there are few teams that can stop San 
Antonio's front line. 
</P>
<P>
	The Miami Heat are the team sitting atop the East, and their  
first order of business will be to keep their tempers in check and 
maintain their overachieving ways as they play their fiercest 
rivals, the Knicks, in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	This will be the third straight year that the Heat and Knicks  
have played in the postseason, and the last two series were 
dramatically altered by late-game fights. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both teams have been burned enough in the postseason -- two  
years ago New York, and last year us -- so maybe this might be the 
real deal,'' Heat coach Pat Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Only six victories separated the No. 1 team in the East from the  
eighth team, so there is little difference between the top and 
bottom. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen Iverson's Philadelphia 76ers, for example, manhandled the  
third-seeded Orlando Magic in two of their three games during the 
regular season and literally threw away a victory in the third 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	Iverson enters the postseason as the league's leading scorer  
looking to prove that he can be a playoff performer to be reckoned 
with. 
</P>
<P>
	The East features other various sideshows, the weirdest of which  
is where to play Games 4 and 5 of the Atlanta-Detroit series. The 
Palace of Auburn Hills is booked for a concert next Friday when the 
Pistons are scheduled to host Game 4, and the Georgia Dome is 
booked for a concert the following Monday -- the night of Game 5. 
</P>
<P>
	The games might be moved to the Silverdome and Georgia Tech's  
Alexander Memorial Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers, of course, have been a sideshow all year -- signing  
and releasing Dennis Rodman, firing Del Harris, trading Elden 
Campbell and Eddie Jones for Glen Rice, watching Kobe Bryant 
freelance to the detriment of O'Neal. 
</P>
<P>
	``It depends which Lakers team shows up. If they have their  
heads on straight, we'll have the toughest series of anybody,'' 
Houston's Charles Barkley said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Portland Trail Blazers, after contending for the best  
leaguewide record until the final few days, must cope with their 
first bout of on-the-court adversity this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Making matters worse, Isaiah Rider has regularly been showing up  
tardy lately -- just the latest of Rider's many behavioral episodes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our biggest opponent right now is ourselves,'' backup point  
guard Greg Anthony said. ``The commitment is not there. We've got 
too many agendas right now. If we don't address them before the 
playoffs, we're going to have a very short run.''

<HEADLINE> Man Gets Death in NJ Pizza Slayings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWTON, N.J. (AP) -- A man who murdered two pizza deliverymen  
after luring them to a remote cabin in a ``thrill killing'' was 
sentenced to death Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas Koskovich didn't react to the jury sentence for gunning  
down Giorgio Gallara and Jeremy Giordano in Franklin. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys had argued that Koskovich grew up in a family  
that glorified crime, abused drugs and didn't love him. 
Psychologists also testified during the trial's penalty phase that 
Koskovich was a schizophrenic. Koskovich, who turned 21 on 
Thursday, attempted suicide last summer in jail. 
</P>
<P>
	But prosecutors called the slayings ``thrill killings,'' saying  
Koskovich and friend Jayson Vreeland placed the pizza order so they 
could kill the people who delivered it. 
</P>
<P>
	Gallara and Giordano were shot several times as they pulled up  
in their car to the vacant cabin. Koskovich was convicted last 
month for the 1997 killings. 
</P>
<P>
	The randomness of the murders stunned residents in this rural  
county in the northwestern corner of New Jersey, which has the 
lowest crime rate in the state. 
</P>
<P>
	Vreeland has not been tried yet. He does not face the death  
penalty because he was a juvenile at the time of the killings.

<HEADLINE> Fiat May Grow in Non-Auto Sectors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME (AP) -- Italy's giant automaker Fiat might turn to more  
activities outside the car sector to expand faster, the company's 
chairman said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Paolo Fresco made his remarks during the presentation in Rome of  
a book marking the 100th anniversary of the Turin-based company, 
which falls on July 11. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we are effective in meeting all the opportunities, we will  
probably end up having faster growth in non-auto areas,'' Fresco 
said, without elaborating. 
</P>
<P>
	He also dismissed market rumors that Fiat, owned by the Agnelli  
family, was in talks to link up with the Ford Motor Co. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, Fiat saw its core auto business plunging both in Italy  
and other markets, including the huge Brazilian market. It sold a 
total of 2.4 million between cars and small trucks, down 9.2 
percent from 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Fresco said earlier this year he didn't expect 1999 to be any  
more favorable.

<HEADLINE> Louima Testifies in NYC Cops' Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Pointing a shaking finger, Haitian immigrant  
Abner Louima stood up in court and identified the police officer he 
says sexually tortured him in a police station bathroom two years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Louima, testifying for the first time at the high-profile trial  
of five officers, singled out an expressionless Officer Justin 
Volpe as the one who rammed a stick into his rectum. 
</P>
<P>
	``He told me if I ever talk to anyone about what happened to me,  
he'll kill me and everybody in my family ... and he's not joking,'' 
said Louima, speaking in halting English. 
</P>
<P>
	The five white officers are charged with violating the black  
immigrant's civil rights in a case that sparked harsh criticism of 
New York City's police department. Louima testified that the 
officers who arrested him after a disturbance outside the Club 
Rendezvous nightclub took turns beating him before Volpe sodomized 
him with the stick. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say Volpe wanted revenge because someone hit him  
during the melee and the officers believed Louima had landed the 
punch. The prosecution said this week it was a cousin of Louima who 
struck Volpe. 
</P>
<P>
	Louima, 32, was mostly calm during his 3 1/2 hours of testimony  
Thursday. But his voice started to quiver when he described how the 
officer put the stick in his rectum and then into Louima's mouth. 
</P>
<P>
	After the attack, Louima said he was brought out of his cell to  
be cared for by paramedics. When he told them what happened, he 
said, they looked at him ``like I was crazy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the paramedics left, Volpe returned and pushed Louima back  
into the cell, took a photo of him and issued his threat, the 
witness said. 
</P>
<P>
	Volpe's attorney, Marvyn Kornberg attempted to discredit Louima  
by having him detail his financial stake in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Louima told jurors he had filed a $155 million claim against the  
city. Now unemployed, he said that federal authorities have paid 
him $2,000 a month since taking over the case. 
</P>
<P>
	He also admitted that he lied to reporters when he said that an  
officer had said ``it's Giuliani time,'' a reference to the 
law-and-order policies of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. He said two men 
who visited him at the hospital had told him to make the statement 
to attract attention. 
</P>
<P>
	Volpe is among four officers charged with beating Louima after  
police tried to disperse a rowdy crowd outside the Brooklyn 
nightclub on Aug. 9, 1997; a fifth officer is charged with covering 
up the assault. 
</P>
<P>
	Volpe and another officer, Charles Schwarz, also are charged  
with the bathroom attack. Louima was hospitalized with severe 
internal injuries after the incident, which prompted demonstrations 
against police brutality. Charges against Louima were dropped 
within days of his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	Louima told jurors that he left his security guard job early and  
joined his brother, cousin and friends for an outing at the club. 
</P>
<P>
	As the club closed and a large crowd spilled onto the street at  
about 4 a.m., Louima said, he noticed someone with blood on his 
face complaining he had been hit by police. Bystanders grew angry, 
he continued, and ``I was very angry, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Louima said when he protested, he heard someone behind him say,  
``Shut up,'' then felt himself being knocked to the ground and 
handcuffed. He described being taken away in a patrol car to a 
nearby intersection where four white police officers -- identified 
by prosecutors as Volpe, Schwarz, Thomas Bruder and Thomas Wiese -- 
began pummeling him. 
</P>
<P>
	Louima said he was then taken to the 70th Precinct stationhouse  
and brutalized.

<HEADLINE> Court Strikes U.S. Encryption Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- In a blow to the Clinton administration, a  
federal appeals court has ruled that government limits on the 
export of computer encryption codes are a violation of freedom of 
expression. 
</P>
<P>
	The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, upholding a lower court  
ruling, said the codes -- which scramble data to prevent 
eavesdropping -- contain expressions of ideas and cannot be 
suppressed indefinitely by government officials. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cryptographers use source code to express their scientific  
ideas in much the same way that mathematicians use equations or 
economists use graphs,'' Judge Betty Fletcher wrote in Thursday's 
2-1 ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal government limits exports of the most powerful  
encryption technology because it fears law enforcement agencies 
won't be able to read the messages of criminals or terrorists. 
</P>
<P>
	The high-tech industry wants relaxed restrictions so it can take  
full advantage of the booming market for encryption programs as 
Internet commerce increases. 
</P>
<P>
	An advocacy group for computer privacy applauded the ruling.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's a giant step forward in bringing down export controls,''  
said Tara Lemmey, president of the Electronic Frontier Foundation 
in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision upheld the 1996 ruling in the case of Daniel  
Bernstein, an Illinois mathematics professor who wanted to post his 
encryption formula on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Fletcher wrote that Bernstein and other scientists ``have been  
effectively chilled from engaging in valuable scientific 
expression.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A court order preventing Bernstein from posting his code remains  
in effect pending the government's decision on whether to appeal 
further. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling declares the regulations invalid in the nation's  
largest federal appellate circuit, which covers nine Western 
states. The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati is 
preparing to review another judge's ruling upholding the same 
regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	The departments of Justice and Commerce, which reviews  
encryption licenses, had no comment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do not expect that this battle is over,'' said Bernstein's  
lawyer, Cindy Cohn. But she said the ruling was ``a huge, giant 
step along the road so that the government can't prevent people 
from developing this tool, this science.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bernstein, now at the University of Illinois at Chicago,  
developed an encryption program called Snuffle as an undergraduate 
at the University of California at Berkeley in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years later, the State Department, which then ran the  
regulatory program, told him he could not post his code on the 
Internet without an export license, which he has been unable to 
get. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration recently liberalized its rules to  
allow encryption of some electronically posted credit card 
information. But in most cases, the regulations still treat 
encryption codes like military weapons and forbid their export 
without a license.

<HEADLINE> Payton Promoting Organ Donations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Football legend Walter Payton, who is suffering  
from a rare liver disease and needs a transplant, has taped a 
public service announcement promoting organ donation. 
</P>
<P>
	The ad will run during CBS's ``Touched By an Angel'' on May 16,  
said Pam Gorode, a spokeswoman for CBS. The theme of the episode 
will be organ donation. 
</P>
<P>
	Ginny Quirk, vice president of Walter Payton Inc., said a CBS  
crew taped the spot at Payton's suburban Chicago offices Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The former Chicago Bears star announced in February that he  
needed a liver transplant because he has primary sclerosing 
cholangitis. 
</P>
<P>
	Payton, 44, said he will undergo tests in the next few weeks  
that he hopes will move him up on the donor list. In terms of his 
physical condition, he said he was taking it one day at a time. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some days are better than others,'' he said. ``You wake up  
every morning and it's sort of like life -- you don't know how you 
are going to feel.''

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Turns to U.S. Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Back from visiting the troops in Europe,  
President Clinton tended to domestic affairs Friday: a $700,000 
fund-raising day in Texas and plans for a conference on school 
violence after the Littleton, Colo., tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to understand there are forces at work in our society  
that call on us to make an extra effort to protect our children 
from violence,'' he said at a $450,000 fund-raising luncheon for 
about four dozen people in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	While Clinton said parents, students, firearms makers and movie  
moguls all should be reflecting on implications of Littleton, he 
urged people to resist assigning blame. ``Instead of saying, 'Whose 
fault is this?,''' he said, ``we should all say, 'What can I do to 
take responsibility?''' 
</P>
<P>
	The president also planned to survey tornado damage in Oklahoma  
during his two-day trip West. Clinton declared major disasters in 
Oklahoma, Kansas and one county in Texas after powerful twisters 
razed communities and left dozens dead. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our thoughts and prayers are with the people of Oklahoma,  
Kansas and Texas, with the people of Tennessee who also endured 
terrible storms and destruction,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Later Friday, Clinton was the featured guest at a $250,000  
dinner in Austin at the home of prominent Democrat and Clinton ally 
Roy Spence. He had canceled a fund-raising trip to Texas scheduled 
the week of the Littleton shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	He acknowleged protesters against the U.S. involvement in Kosovo  
whom he saw saw along the motorcade route, and said he was often 
reticent to resort to force. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw the people with their signs on the way in saying we  
ought to end the fighting. Nobody wants to do it more than me,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But on the same night that reports from Belgrade indicated NATO  
bombs had struck the Chinese Embassy, he offered a staunch defense 
of the campaign to end ethnic cleansing in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``People may have legitimate grievances,'' he said. ``But ethnic  
cleansing and killing people wholesale because of their race or 
religion is wrong and the United States is in a position to stand 
against it and we ought to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said curbing school violence will require the same kind  
of sustained national efforts that reduced teen pregnancy and 
helped trim welfare rolls. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is the kind of national commitment we need to protect our  
children from violence,'' he said. ``I believe more than anything 
else we need a grass-roots effort which involves every single 
American from the White House down to the smallest community; a 
national campaign that draws out everyone's commitment, all our 
resources and depends upon everyone taking responsibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When, in the wake of Littleton, Clinton set up a White House  
conference on school violence, he also urged students across the 
country to reach beyond their own cliques to understand their 
classmates better. 
</P>
<P>
	He said gun manufacturers would be involved. However, a list of  
participants for Monday's conference featuring leaders in 
education, law enforcement and entertainment didn't include 
advocates from the other side of the gun-control debate. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Rifle Association, the nation's largest gun lobby,  
said it was not invited. It scheduled its own news conference to 
announce proposals that the NRA said can have an ``immediate and 
significant impact on violent crime in America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But two other gun groups, the American Shooting Sports Council  
and the National Shooting Sports Council, have agreed to support 
some of the administration's new gun control proposals, The 
Washington Post reported in its editions Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Among them are measures raising the age eligibility for buying a  
handgun from 18 to 21, holding parents criminally responsible for 
allowing children access to guns and forbidding juveniles convicted 
of violent felonies from ever buying a gun. 
</P>
<P>
	They also agreed on measures requiring people who sell guns at  
gun shows to make background checks on the buyers, the newspaper 
said. But the gun groups refused to endorse White House proposals 
to require three-day waiting periods for buying guns and allowing 
people to buy only one gun a month. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Wizards' Strickland Pleads Innocent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rod Strickland of the Washington Wizards  
pleaded innocent Friday to charges of driving under the influence 
of alcohol and reckless driving. 
</P>
<P>
	He also requested a jury trial, which was set for Aug. 13. The  
charges stem from his April 24 arrest after police said they saw 
Strickland, 32, run three red lights and change lanes without 
signaling. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe we have a mandate to protect the public from this  
behavior,'' said Robert Rigsby, a city attorney prosecuting the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted, Strickland could be sentenced up to a year in  
jail. Thirteen months ago, Strickland was convicted of driving 
while impaired in the district. He was ordered to participate in an 
alcohol-awareness program, and perform 30 hours of community 
service as a result of the Sept. 3, 1997, arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	When Strickland could not be found for an earlier scheduled  
court appearance Friday, a traffic court commissioner issued a 
bench warrant for his arrest. He could have been jailed and forced 
to post a $5,000 bond. 
</P>
<P>
	His lawyer said Strickland was still in Atlanta, where the  
Wizards closed out the season Wednesday night with a 100-92 loss to 
the Hawks. The lawyer, Michael V. Statham, said Strickland missed 
an earlier flight. 
</P>
<P>
	The warrant was revoked when Strickland appeared for the  
arraignment Friday afternoon.

<HEADLINE> Teen Pleads No Contest in Deaths </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MUSKEGON, Mich. (AP) -- An 18-year-old boy pleaded no contest  
Friday to shooting his family to death just before Thanksgiving 
dinner. 
</P>
<P>
	Seth Privacky will be sentenced to an automatic life term  
without parole for the Nov. 29 shootings of his father, mother, 
grandfather, brother and his brother's girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
	Sentencing was scheduled for May 27.  
</P>
<P>
	Police said Privacky confessed to systematically shooting each  
victim point-blank in the head, then calling best friend Steven 
Wallace, also 18, to help him move bodies around the house, even 
lugging one out to the driveway, to make it look like a robbery. 
</P>
<P>
	The family was preparing for a delayed Thanksgiving dinner that  
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Privacky had been prescribed anti-depressant medication at the  
time, but it was not known if he was taking it. 
</P>
<P>
	The father, Stephen Privacky, 50, taught fifth grade. His wife,  
Linda Privacky, 49, was a receptionist at a medical office. Her 
father-in-law, John Privacky, was 78 and lived on his own nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	Seth's brother, Jedidiah Privacky and April Boss, both 19, were  
studying at Muskegon Community College to be teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	The brother was shot while watching television, the mother when  
she got out of the shower, the father and grandfather were killed 
when they arrived home, and the girlfriend died when she arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	Privacky has said he was angry because his father had threatened  
to kick him out of the house. 
</P>
<P>
	Wallace remains charged with being an accessory and disposing of  
the firearm Privacky used in the killings. He faces between two and 
five years in prison if convicted.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Turns to U.S. Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Back from visiting the troops in Europe,  
President Clinton tended to domestic affairs Friday: a $700,000 
fund-raising day in Texas and plans for a conference on school 
violence after the Littleton, Colo., tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to understand there are forces at work in our society  
that call on us to make an extra effort to protect our children 
from violence,'' he said at a $450,000 fund-raising luncheon for 
about four dozen people in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	While Clinton said parents, students, firearms makers and movie  
moguls all should be reflecting on implications of Littleton, he 
urged people to resist assigning blame. ``Instead of saying, 'Whose 
fault is this?,''' he said, ``we should all say, 'What can I do to 
take responsibility?''' 
</P>
<P>
	The president also planned to survey tornado damage in Oklahoma  
during his two-day trip West. Clinton declared major disasters in 
Oklahoma, Kansas and one county in Texas after powerful twisters 
razed communities and left dozens dead. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our thoughts and prayers are with the people of Oklahoma,  
Kansas and Texas, with the people of Tennessee who also endured 
terrible storms and destruction,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Later Friday, Clinton was the featured guest at a $250,000  
dinner in Austin at the home of prominent Democrat and Clinton ally 
Roy Spence. He had canceled a fund-raising trip to Texas scheduled 
the week of the Littleton shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	He acknowleged protesters against the U.S. involvement in Kosovo  
whom he saw saw along the motorcade route, and said he was often 
reticent to resort to force. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw the people with their signs on the way in saying we  
ought to end the fighting. Nobody wants to do it more than me,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But on the same night that reports from Belgrade indicated NATO  
bombs had struck the Chinese Embassy, he offered a staunch defense 
of the campaign to end ethnic cleansing in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``People may have legitimate grievances,'' he said. ``But ethnic  
cleansing and killing people wholesale because of their race or 
religion is wrong and the United States is in a position to stand 
against it and we ought to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said curbing school violence will require the same kind  
of sustained national efforts that reduced teen pregnancy and 
helped trim welfare rolls. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is the kind of national commitment we need to protect our  
children from violence,'' he said. ``I believe more than anything 
else we need a grass-roots effort which involves every single 
American from the White House down to the smallest community; a 
national campaign that draws out everyone's commitment, all our 
resources and depends upon everyone taking responsibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When, in the wake of Littleton, Clinton set up a White House  
conference on school violence, he also urged students across the 
country to reach beyond their own cliques to understand their 
classmates better. 
</P>
<P>
	He said gun manufacturers would be involved. However, a list of  
participants for Monday's conference featuring leaders in 
education, law enforcement and entertainment didn't include 
advocates from the other side of the gun-control debate. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Rifle Association, the nation's largest gun lobby,  
said it was not invited. It scheduled its own news conference to 
announce proposals that the NRA said can have an ``immediate and 
significant impact on violent crime in America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But two other gun groups, the American Shooting Sports Council  
and the National Shooting Sports Council, have agreed to support 
some of the administration's new gun control proposals, The 
Washington Post reported in its editions Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Among them are measures raising the age eligibility for buying a  
handgun from 18 to 21, holding parents criminally responsible for 
allowing children access to guns and forbidding juveniles convicted 
of violent felonies from ever buying a gun. 
</P>
<P>
	They also agreed on measures requiring people who sell guns at  
gun shows to make background checks on the buyers, the newspaper 
said. But the gun groups refused to endorse White House proposals 
to require three-day waiting periods for buying guns and allowing 
people to buy only one gun a month. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement came about in a meeting Tuesday at the White House  
between Bruce Reed, Clinton's domestic policy adviser, and leaders 
of the two gun industry groups, the Post said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said that in addition to encouraging parents to  
communicate more with their children and entertainment moguls to 
consider the effects of their films, the problem of youth violence 
also requires new gun-control measures. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope we will be able to avoid another big fight in  
Washington between the NRA and others,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the gun lobby, he also singled out Hollywood.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think that there are challenges for those who influence our  
culture, including the entertainment community,'' he said, adding 
that it was a mistake to ``trivialize relationships, or trivialize 
violence.''

<HEADLINE> Bush Using Texas To Build Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- While his political team scours the country  
for cash and plots far-reaching campaign strategies, Texas Gov. 
George W. Bush is riding herd on a legislative session that he 
hopes will seal his status as the GOP presidential front-runner. 
</P>
<P>
	Grinding through a Republican Senate and a Democratic House are  
Bush-backed initiatives to slash taxes, improve schools and curb 
abortions. Just as important, the second-term governor is stepping 
gingerly around legislative land mines that could explode after he 
leaves Austin for the campaign trail in June. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 45-minute interview at his Capitol offices this week, Bush  
discussed a range of state issues that are complicating his 
political life. The talk reinforced expectations that Bush, as a 
presidential candidate, would offer Americans the same soft-edged, 
caveated conservatism that got him re-elected in 1998 with 70 
percent of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``I intend to talk about what I've done to show people what I  
intend to do,'' he said. ``I've got a record. It's a conservative 
record. It's a compassionate record.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also is looking beyond Austin.  
</P>
<P>
	A team of volunteers is studying the Electoral College map,  
laying the early groundwork for a general election strategy. His 
finance team hopes to raise $7.5 million in the second quarter of 
1999 -- for a total of $15 million. 
</P>
<P>
	They are collecting more than $10 for every $1 spent on  
fund-raising, a remarkable ratio that no other GOP campaign has 
matched. He plans to keep most of the money in the bank, giving 
rivals 10 million or so reasons to consider dropping out. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign will soon pocket its 100th congressional  
endorsement, and advisers are meeting regularly with Capitol Hill 
leaders. The strategy is to swap legislative ideas so Bush gets a 
chorus of support when he unveils campaign initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Before he can start campaigning for president, Bush must finish  
being governor. The issues confronting him: 
</P>
<P>
	TAXES -- He wants a $2 billion property tax cut but will settle  
for less. ``I don't draw lines'' in the sand, he said. The goal: 
``Significant tax cuts.'' What is significant? 
</P>
<P>
	``You'll know it when you see it,'' Bush said, with a smile and  
a wink. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, the governor's tax-cutting package was rejected and  
replaced with a bill one-third smaller than his. He signed it and 
took credit for what he called the largest tax cut in Texas 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	EDUCATION -- He likely will leave Austin with a landmark bill  
reducing the practice of promoting failing students simply to keep 
them in their age group. 
</P>
<P>
	Another initiative popular with GOP voters -- public school  
vouchers -- is likely to fail. The Texas bill would create pilot 
project in just two school districts. 
</P>
<P>
	Defeat would open him to criticism from conservatives who doubt  
Bush's commitment. His younger brother, Jeb Bush, just secured a 
sweeping voucher bill as governor of Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	ABORTION -- Bush opposes abortion, but says Americans are not  
prepared to outlaw the procedure. Hoping to appease the right 
without upsetting moderates, Bush is taking an incremental 
approach. 
</P>
<P>
	His bill would require parents to be notified when a young women  
seeks an abortion, unless a judge waives the requirement. Democrats 
may succeed in giving social workers the same power, sending Bush a 
bill that would be tough to sign and hard to ignore. 
</P>
<P>
	HATE CRIMES -- Bush will face a dilemma if a bill expanding  
Texas' hate crimes law is sent to his desk. The measure, which 
President Clinton backed during a visit to Texas on Friday, would 
define the categories of hate that draw extra punishment, including 
crimes based on sexual preference. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, who has said he opposes same-sex marriages, would anger  
party conservatives by signing the bill. If he vetoed it, Democrats 
would accuse him of playing to the right. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush refuses to say how he would handle the bill, but he  
believes stiff sentences are warranted for all crimes -- no matter 
the motivation. ``Punish the deed,'' he said. ``Most deeds are 
based upon hate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Referring to the shootings at Columbine High School, Bush said,  
``What's the difference between the white man who got killed or the 
black man who got killed during that rampage?'' 
</P>
<P>
	GUN CONTROL -- Bush created a stir when he seemed to endorse  
background checks for purchasers at gun shows -- but only after the 
bill died and the Colorado shootings occurred. His aides now say 
the bill was always flawed; the governor said federal law must 
change to permit full-scale gun show checks. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush supports federal bans on assault weapons and armor-piercing  
bullets, taking the middle road to gun control as polls show a 
growing hunger for restrictions. He approved a concealed weapons 
law in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Prickly issues like these traditionally pose problems for  
governors who try to leap from the statehouse to the White House. 
In 1992, Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton faced questions about his 
record, as did 1988 Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis, governor of 
Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
	In Texas, Bush gets good marks from Democratic and Republican  
lawmakers, though some privately grumble that he shifts with the 
political winds. They call him charming, a deal-cutter, an astute 
communicator who makes the most out of an inherently weak 
governor's office. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been a good governor,'' said House Speaker Pete Laney, a  
Democrat. ``I think he would be a good president.''

<HEADLINE> Free House Eyes Pimlico Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- J. Paco Gonzalez looked skyward and shook his  
head. Rain clouds were moving in, and he wasn't frowning simply 
because he didn't have an umbrella. 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzalez, the trainer of Free House, has no idea how his horse  
will fare Saturday if the track is soggy at Pimlico Race Course for 
34th running of the Pimlico Special. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's never raced on an off track, although he's handled it  
just fine in the mornings,'' Gonzalez said Thursday, well aware 
that the forecast called for more rain today. 
</P>
<P>
	Free House is the 6-5 favorite in the $500,000 Grade I event,  
followed by Real Quiet at 8-5 and Precocity at 2-1. Fred Bear Claw 
and Brushing Up will open at 20-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Real Quiet won the 1998 Preakness at Pimlico, and this 1  
3-16-mile race is the same distance. But Real Quiet hasn't walked 
into the winner's circle since edging Victory Gallop in the 
Preakness, finishing second at the Belmont and in both his races 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Precocity took second in the Special last May and  
finished in the money in all four of his races in 1999, Free House 
is 2-0 this year and clearly the hottest horse in the field. 
</P>
<P>
	Free House also has experience at Pimlico, finishing second in  
the 1997 Preakness behind Silver Charm. 
</P>
<P>
	Free House got a small measure of revenge for that race in  
March, recording a wire-to-wire victory in the Santa Anita Handicap 
as Silver Charm took third. One month earlier, Free House, a 
5-year-old gray, captured the San Antonio Handicap after bolting 
from the gate and never losing the lead. 
</P>
<P>
	``Precocity is a really nice horse and so is Real Quiet,''  
Gonzalez said. ``But I have a feeling we have the best horse here. 
We've won two in a row and Real Quiet has been beaten the last 
couple of times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzalez figures that, weather permitting, jockey Chris McCarron  
will force the field to chase him from the outset. 
</P>
<P>
	``Real Quiet is going to be behind us. He doesn't have the speed  
we have but he's going to be close,'' Gonzalez said. ``The one that 
will be far back is Precocity because he cannot match the speed we 
have. He comes from off the pace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzalez was a bit tired Thursday, for good reason. He  
accompanied Free House on a five-hour flight from California to New 
Jersey on Wednesday, then hopped aboard a van for a four-hour drive 
to Baltimore. Somewhere along the way, his luggage was lost. 
</P>
<P>
	He took it easy Thursday and so did Free House, who spent the  
entire day in Stall 6. Real Quiet jogged a mile under exercise 
rider Larry Damore, who declared his horse ready to break out of 
his mini-slump. 
</P>
<P>
	``This horse is ready to win,'' Damore said.

<HEADLINE> Plan To Help Small Co. Employees / On the Money  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- When Kenneth Kraut's auto insurance comes due  
four times a year, he writes a check and mails it. 
</P>
<P>
	He may soon be free of the bother, thanks to his employer.  
</P>
<P>
	Kraut, a flavor chemist in Somerset, N.J., now can have the  
insurance payments deducted a bit at a time from his biweekly 
paychecks. In addition to removing a worry, he saves 5 percent off 
the top of his premium. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great convenience. It's kind of like a forced  
savings,'' Kraut said. ``It's small amounts per paycheck. This way 
you're not hit all at once with a big bill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kraut's company, Flavor Dynamics Inc., is among a growing number  
of small businesses around the country now able to offer discounts 
on optional employee benefits through automatic payroll deductions. 
The offerings aren't new, but in the past they've generally been 
available only to large companies able to negotiate volume 
discounts. 
</P>
<P>
	The program was introduced in January by Ceridian Corp., a  
Minnesota-based payroll services company that joined with 
RewardsPlus of America Corp. in Baltimore to develop the plan for 
small business clients. 
</P>
<P>
	Flavor Dynamics, a family-owned business with 20 employees that  
makes flavorings for the food industry, jumped at the chance to 
sign up, said Marilyn De Rovira, a company vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	The program gives employees convenience and price breaks on  
services they might be buying elsewhere, De Rovira said. Companies 
like Flavor Dynamics are able to offer benefits that attract 
employees, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The program from Ceridian's Small Business Solutions unit  
includes auto, homeowners, pet, life and long-term care insurance, 
home security, mortgages and home equity loans at prices 5 percent 
to 15 percent below what individuals would pay on their own. There 
are no startup fees or administrative expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	RewardsPlus had no economical way of offering discounted  
benefits to small companies until it worked out the program with 
Ceridian. The program lumps together the buying power of thousands 
of employees from different businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the alliance with Ceridian, RewardsPlus was able to build  
a single interface to offer the benefits to Ceridian clients, said 
Ken Barksdale, president of RewardsPlus. 
</P>
<P>
	``What makes it possible is the electronic linkage behind the  
scenes. If we didn't have that, we couldn't run the system,'' 
explained Brian Regan, vice president of Ceridian Small Business 
Solutions. 
</P>
<P>
	An employee signs up for the program by calling RewardsPlus,  
which is linked electronically with Ceridian's computer system. 
</P>
<P>
	``When that employee makes their choices, that deduction amount  
pops up on our screen just hours later. It's all done 
electronically,'' Regan said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The program enables us to assist small business owners in  
retaining their most valuable asset -- their employees -- by 
providing them with optional benefits at a low cost,'' said Robert 
Digby, senior vice president of marketing for Bloomington, 
Minn.-based Ceridian. 
</P>
<P>
	``The small employers have been begging for some type of  
economic way to compete with the large employers in the benefits 
industry to attract and retain employees,'' Barksdale said. ``We've 
finally found the formula to be able to do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By late February, about 100 companies had signed up for the  
program, Regan said. Employee enrollments were just beginning to 
come in. 
</P>
<P>
	There is no charge to the employer. Barksdale says RewardsPlus  
charges benefit providers less than they would pay a regular sales 
agent and makes its money through volume sales of multiple 
products. 
</P>
<P>
	RewardsPlus tests all of its benefit offerings to make sure they  
are acceptable before putting them into a package, Barksdale added. 
</P>
<P>
	For Flavor Dynamics, the program helps De Rovira and her  
husband, Dolf, who own the business, compete for employees. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's such stiff competition with employees and trying to  
make them happy,'' Mrs. De Rovira said. ``I thought this would be 
something that would be very interesting for them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kraut, 36, has worked at Flavor Dynamics for 10 years. While the  
program alone wouldn't keep him working for the small-town company, 
he said, it makes him feel appreciated as he is approached by 
headhunters trying to lure him to bigger companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Overall, the company is trying to make things easier for us.  
It shows that the company really cares,'' he said. ``They don't 
benefit from it. We do.''

<HEADLINE> Panel Debates Convicts' Use of DNA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) -- A panel appointed by Attorney General  
Janet Reno debated on Friday whether convicts should be allowed to 
use DNA evidence to win their freedom after the time for appeals 
has run out. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Commission on the Future of DNA Evidence met to  
examine DNA issues and make recommendations on changes in law or 
policy to Reno. The commission debated proposed legislation drafted 
by a subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
	``DNA is the truth,'' said commission member Ron Reinstein, a  
Superior Court judge from Phoenix who noted that DNA evidence has 
disproved eyewitness accounts on occasion. 
</P>
<P>
	DNA evidence has cleared at least 62 people convicted of crimes  
in the United States. Most of those cases, some championed by DNA 
expert Barry Scheck, are murder or rape crimes, said Brooklyn Law 
School professor Margaret Berger. 
</P>
<P>
	However, when DNA evidence clears someone of a crime after their  
time to appeal has expired, there is no legal mechanism to free the 
person. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has to be done by a legislature or by an executive clemency  
order by a governor,'' Reinstein said. 
</P>
<P>
	Reinstein and Berger are on a commission subgroup that drafted  
legislation that would allow inmates to ask to reopen their cases 
based on DNA evidence even if their time for an appeal had run out. 
The law would apply to state and federal cases. 
</P>
<P>
	DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is the molecular building block  
of life -- different for every individual. 
</P>
<P>
	Hair, blood, clothing, bed sheets or rape kits that were  
gathered as evidence before the advent of DNA could be looked at 
again with DNA technology to determine whether the right person was 
convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	During a review of a first draft of the legislation Friday, some  
commission members expressed concern that the law would open the 
floodgates for inmate appeals. 
</P>
<P>
	``This could open up every sexual assault case I've ever  
prosecuted,'' said commission member Norman Gahn, an assistant 
district attorney from Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	Reinstein proposed ``DNA SWAT teams'' in each state to help sift  
through the petitions and determine which are legitimate. 
</P>
<P>
	A formal process for making the requests to reopen a case would  
help protect victims' rights, said Kathryn Turman, a victim-rights 
advocate on the panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Christopher Asplen, commission executive director, suggested  
creating the teams through federally funded pilot projects for 
states lacking financial resources. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission has an Aug. 1 deadline to present its  
recommendations to Reno.

<HEADLINE> Long, Laettner Have Mixed Emotions  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Atlanta's Grant Long must keep his emotions in  
check, which won't be easy facing his former team in the first 
round of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Ditto for Detroit's Christian Laettner.  
</P>
<P>
	Long and Laettner, who switched places after last season, come  
together again when the Hawks meet the Pistons in the best-of-5 
first round. The first two games are at the Georgia Dome, beginning 
Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Long spent two miserable seasons in Detroit, averaging less than  
five points per game with limited playing time. He signed with the 
Hawks after the lockout and became one of the team's most valuable 
players, filling in frequently for the injury-plagued Alan 
Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad we had Grant Long,'' Hawks coach Lenny Wilkens said.  
``Without him, we would have been in deep trouble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 33-year-old Long was grateful for another chance to play in  
Atlanta, where he spent two seasons before a trade to the Pistons 
nearly scuttled his career. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never doubted myself, but it's just great to run and shoot  
and do all the things I like to do on the court,'' he said. ``I'm 
in a situation where I'm appreciated. I never got a chance to do 
those things in Detroit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Long doesn't want to take his personal feelings onto the court  
in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was kind of frustrating playing for them. There were a lot  
of emotional times,'' he said. ``I've got to harness that 
emotion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Long could play a major role with Henderson still suffering  
double vision from an abrasion on his left eye, making him doubtful 
for the opener. Henderson did not practice Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Laettner was an All-Star for the Hawks in 1997 but lost his  
starting job to Henderson the following year. He was never close 
with his Atlanta teammates, who seemed relieved when he was traded 
to the Pistons after the lockout ended. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was tight with the team trainer,'' Laettner said dryly when  
asked whether he had any friends on the Hawks. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Long, Laettner insists that he won't turn the playoffs into  
a personal vendetta. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not at all,'' he said. ``The goal is to go down there and win  
both games. I've heard talk about us trying to steal one down 
there. I want to win both games down there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the history of these two players is impossible to ignore.  
</P>
<P>
	``Both guys have left their respective former teams and will  
probably have something to prove,'' Detroit's Joe Dumars said. 
``That could be a key matchup for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If not, the key matchup certainly will be Atlanta's Steve Smith  
vs. Detroit's Grant Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite gimpy knees that sent him to the injured list twice,  
Smith led the Hawks with 18.7 points per game. Hill does it all for 
the Pistons, pacing his team in scoring (21.1), rebounding (7.1) 
and assists (6.0). 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to pay attention to Grant Hill,'' Long said. ``But  
you can't let your concentration slip on guys like Joe Dumars and 
Lindsay Hunter. They've had great years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter averaged 11.9 points and hit nearly 39 percent from  
beyond the 3-point stripe. Dumars, who is retiring at the end of 
the season, averaged 11.3 points and connected on more than 40 
percent of his 3-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't leave Dumars and Hunter,'' Wilkens said. ``Their  
3-point shots are like a layup.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Don't expect a high-scoring series. The Hawks allowed only 83.4  
points per game -- lowest in the league -- while the Pistons also 
ranked among the defensive leaders at 86.9. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're a good defensive team,'' Wilkens said. ``Offensively,  
we've got to move the ball. We don't have a superstar like Shaq 
(Shaquille O'Neal) that we can throw it to. Our shot selection has 
to be good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the series goes beyond Game 3, scheduled for Detroit on  
Wednesday night, both teams will be scrambling to find a home 
court. 
</P>
<P>
	The Palace of Auburn Hills is booked for a sold-out rock concert  
on May 14, the same day the Pistons are scheduled to play host to 
Game 4. Other possible sites are the Pontiac Silverdome, the 
Pistons' former home, and Joe Louis Arena in downtown Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	If the series returns to Atlanta for Game 5 on May 16, it  
probably will be played at Georgia Tech's 9,300-seat coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
	An oldies concert will be held at the Georgia Dome on May 15,  
and officials say it would be too difficult to convert the building 
back to basketball for a game the following day.

<HEADLINE> Earthquake in S. Iran Kills 20 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- A strong earthquake flattened  
20 villages in southern Iran this morning, killing at least 20 
people and injuring 80, Tehran radio reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The quake struck near Shiraz and Kazerun, cities in Fars  
province, said the radio, monitored in Dubai. The tremor had a 
magnitude of 6.5, the radio reported, but the U.S. Geological 
Survey said it measured 6.3. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the dead were children killed when their homes  
collapsed, the head of the Natural Disasters Headquarters, Hasan 
Momtahen, told the official Islamic Republic News Agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty villages around Shiraz were completely flattened by the  
quake, the radio said. Homes, clinics and public buildings in other 
villages sustained considerable damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Aid organizations, soldiers and other rescuers had evacuated all  
of the injured by midmorning, the radio said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 3:30 a.m. local time earthquake was followed by 40  
aftershocks, the agency said. Eight of the aftershocks had a 
magnitude of 4 to 4.5, Momtahen told the agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents in Shiraz, reached by telephone from Dubai, said they  
were awakened by a severe jolt before dawn. 
</P>
<P>
	``The earthquake made the windows rattle and the ground shake,''  
said an operator at the Homa Hotel in downtown Shiraz. 
</P>
<P>
	``The city itself seems normal and I haven't seen much damage.  
Most of the damage appears to have been caused outside Shiraz 
itself,'' said the operator, who would not give his name. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of Iran's most impressive antiquities lie near Shiraz. It  
was not immediately known whether they were damaged. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruins of Persepolis, one of the capitals of the Persian  
empire, are about 35 miles northwest of Shiraz. Alexander the Great 
plundered Persepolis in 330 B.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Shiraz, is about 400 miles south of the Iranian capital, Tehran.

<HEADLINE> Atlantans Deny Aussie Olympic Link </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Despite critics' claims, an Australian Olympic  
official gave Atlanta no special help in winning the 1996 Games, a 
spokesman for Atlanta organizers says. 
</P>
<P>
	Phil Coles, a member of the International Olympic Committee and  
the Sydney Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games (SOCOG), has 
been accused to helping Atlanta beat out Melbourne's rival bid for 
the games in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles met with Atlanta organizers in Seoul in 1988. But he  
wasn't the only IOC member to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's safe to say all the IOC members provided good  
advice and counsel to all the candidate cities who were bidding for 
the 1996 Games,'' Lee Echols, a spokesman for Atlanta Olympics 
officials, said Thursday. ``Did (Coles) give extraordinary help? 
Absolutely not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also Thursday, a U.S. House of Representatives subcommittee  
looking into the Salt Lake bribery scandal opened an inquiry into 
Atlanta's bid for the 1996 Games, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution 
reported in today's editions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing would make me feel better than to know Atlanta has a  
clean bill of health,'' said Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich. Upton is 
chairman of the House Committee on Commerce's subcommittee on 
oversight and investigations. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to use all means necessary to get to the bottom of  
this one way or another,'' Upton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The subcommittee plans to send investigators to Atlanta to seek  
information about gifts and payments to members of the IOC during 
the bid process and look through the foundation's records. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel this represents an opportunity to have an objective  
and legitimate review of how Atlanta won the games without the 
pressure of lawyers and the press,'' Echols said. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics in Australia want Coles to resign because of links to  
scandals that organizers say are damaging sponsorship and 
threatening ticket sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta bid documents released last week included a letter from  
Atlanta board member Horace Sibley to Coles thanking him for ``your 
time and your advice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When reports of the letter hit Australia, criticism of Coles  
increased. 
</P>
<P>
	Ron Walker, a member of Melbourne's bid, said that the heat  
Coles is feeling is justice for his ``dalliance with Atlanta.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Records show several IOC members received similar thanks after  
meeting with the Atlanta bid team in 1988, two years before Atlanta 
won its bid. 
</P>
<P>
	In nine boxes of Atlanta Olympic documents released last week,  
The Associated Press found five similar letters Sibley wrote on the 
same day to other IOC members. 
</P>
<P>
	All the letters contained similar thanks, and one other --  
written to Venezuelan IOC member Flor Isava-Fonseca -- mentions 
advice. 
</P>
<P>
	``You gave us some good advice and we will follow it,'' the  
letter to Isava-Fonseca said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sibley and former Atlanta Olympics chief Billy Payne did not  
return calls seeking comment Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles says there's a conspiracy against him, possibly by members  
of Melbourne's failed bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a legal fight over opening 4,000 of boxes of Olympic  
records to the public has intensified. 
</P>
<P>
	The Georgia Amateur Athletics Foundation, a private group  
holding the records, has filed suit seeking a ruling that the 
documents do not fall under Georgia's Open Records Act. 
</P>
<P>
	The Journal-Constitution has been fighting to open the records,  
saying the public has a right to know if they contain evidence of 
bribery akin to the scandal that has tainted Salt Lake City's 
Olympic bid. 
</P>
<P>
	The foundation sued after Georgia Attorney General Thurbert  
Baker demanded Wednesday the bid documents be made public. 
</P>
<P>
	``GAAF's steadfast refusal to make the documents available to  
the public ... lends credence to the believe that GAAF has 
something to hide,'' Baker wrote to Joseph Bankoff, the 
foundation's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	Responding to Baker, Bankoff wrote, ``There is no shadow over  
the Games other than one manufactured'' by the 
Journal-Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	The athletics foundation, created by Payne in 1987 to bid for  
the Olympics, says the documents are the property of a group of 
private citizens. 
</P>
<P>
	But Baker says the records must be opened because Atlanta's  
Olympic efforts involved a partnership between government and 
private interests.

<HEADLINE> Cubs Record for Allowing Runs Stops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Kevin Tapani held the Cincinnati Reds  
scoreless in the first inning Friday night, halting the Chicago 
Cubs' record for allowing runs at 13 consecutive innings. 
</P>
<P>
	By giving up at least one run in 13 consecutive innings, the  
Cubs established an NL record for the 1900s, topping the 12 innings 
by Philadelphia in 1923. The major league record is held by 
Cleveland, which gave up runs in 14 consecutive innings in 1903 at 
Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Cameron singled to open the Reds' first, but was thrown out  
by Benito Santiago as he tried to steal second. Tapani then retired 
Michael Tucker on a fly ball and struck out Greg Vaughn. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday at Wrigley Field, Colorado became the first team in  
35 years -- and only the third this century -- to score in all nine 
innings, rolling to a 13-6 win.

<HEADLINE> Panel Reviews China Satellite Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- China pressured American satellite companies  
seeking business in Asia to push for changes in U.S. export laws 
that eventually helped Beijing secure information useful in 
improving ballistic missiles, according to a Senate report. 
</P>
<P>
	The bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee report, approved in  
a 16-1 vote and released today, is sharply critical of both the 
Bush and Clinton administrations, alleging lax enforcement of 
export security provisions designed to prevent foreign countries 
from getting sensitive U.S. technology. A copy of the report was 
obtained Thursday by The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no doubt that U.S. missile technology was indeed  
transferred to China,'' said Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., the 
committee chairman. ``Officials within the administration and 
certain U.S. aerospace companies joined in a conspiracy of 
carelessness and recklessness that allowed unlicensed, unauthorized 
transfers of technology.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shelby said protection of national security ``took a back seat  
to making a buck'' and he said U.S. intelligence ``may never know 
the full extent'' of the technology China obtained. 
</P>
<P>
	While the report focuses on U.S. missteps, it also depicts China  
as shrewdly using its considerable economic leverage to bring about 
policy changes in Washington that opened the flow of technology 
exports. As far back as the Reagan administration, Washington was 
prepared to allow U.S. companies to put commercial satellites into 
space aboard Chinese rockets. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, in 1989, the Tiananmen Square crackdown in Beijing led to  
restrictions on U.S. technology exports. 
</P>
<P>
	In response, ``China actively lobbied U.S. companies that they  
were losing valuable business opportunities because of sanctions 
and government restrictions,'' the committee reported. China made 
it clear that access to a potentially vast market in 
telecommunications services and equipment ``would be available to 
companies willing to cooperate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Companies such as Loral Space &AMP; Communications and Hughes  
Electronics paid China for satellite launch services in part 
because of lower Chinese prices for rocket launches. But the report 
says another factor was Beijing's insistence that communications 
companies seeking access to Chinese markets must use Chinese launch 
services. 
</P>
<P>
	The report found that decisions easing export rules by both  
Clinton and Bush ``emphasized commercial interests over national 
security.'' Both administrations failed to adequately fund 
satellite export security teams that would monitor interaction 
between U.S. contractors and Chinese officials, the panel 
concluded. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel said it found no evidence that China has incorporated  
technology gained from U.S. contractors into its current ICBM 
force, which predates the policies allowing export of U.S. 
satellites to China. 
</P>
<P>
	But the report said revenue from U.S. companies buying Chinese  
launch services funded improvements in Chinese rockets which were 
virtually interchangeable for military or commercial purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman David Leavy said President Clinton has  
already approved steps recommended by the committee to strengthen 
security oversight of satellite exports. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have strong controls to monitor the commercial satellite  
launches but we are concerned, as is the committee, that 
unauthorized transfers could assist China,'' Leavy said. 
</P>
<P>
	During the Clinton administration, the report said, U.S.  
contractors conducted detailed technical reviews of Beijing rocket 
technology with little or no U.S. national security supervision. 
</P>
<P>
	``Such (technology) transfer enables the PRC to improve its  
present and future technical know-how,'' the report concluded. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee said U.S. officials had access to intelligence  
reports dating to the 1980s that said China ``has had a strategic, 
coordinated effort to collect technological products and 
information from the U.S. government and private companies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report cites two cases now under federal investigation in  
which U.S. companies helped China improve its rockets after 
commercial rockets carrying U.S.-built satellites crashed. Hughes 
provided China with valuable technical information following the 
1995 crash of a Chinese rocket. Loral did the same thing the 
following year after another crash. 
</P>
<P>
	In both cases, no U.S. government security specialists monitored  
those contacts to prevent leakage of sensitive technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Rules for satellite deals allowed China to launch U.S.-made  
equipment but barred the Chinese from access to the inner workings 
of the satellites. The space vehicles arrived in China for launch 
under tight U.S. guard. Similar restrictions and monitors were 
placed over technical contacts between the Chinese and U.S. 
contractors. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Loral case, however, ``certain key facilities were not  
guarded,'' the report said. ``Classified materials were left 
unattended (and) security officials did not adequately determine 
the nationality of foreign technicians working in sensitive site 
areas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at Loral did not return calls seeking comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Hughes spokesman Richard Dore said, ``Hughes does not believe it  
was ever in the position of passing on any type of security 
information or anything that would compromise a national security 
situation'' to China.

<HEADLINE> Bruins Waiting for `Real' Sabres / Hockey Game Story  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILMINGTON, Mass. (AP) -- Gone are the sleepy Buffalo Sabres who  
took two periods to work the rust out of their legs in Game 1 
against Boston on Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the Bruins expect to play the ``real'' Buffalo team  
they saw during the third period for the rest of the second-round 
best-of-7 playoff series. 
</P>
<P>
	``They had a lot of feeling out time out there in the beginning  
of the game,'' Bruins defenseman Hal Gill said. ``If we want to be 
successful, we have to be prepared to play against them the way we 
did in the third.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boston got its third home playoff victory in four games with the  
4-2 defeat of the Sabres on Thursday night, after entering the 
postseason with a 1-10 mark in its previous 11 home playoff games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres had gone eight days between games after a 4-0 sweep  
of Ottawa. After going so long without a match, they had a 
difficult time connecting passes, making big hits and, in general, 
being in sync with each other Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sabres coach Lindy Ruff said that his ``A'' team was not playing  
in the first half of the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a few guys who were not on top of their game, but after  
skating for 30 to 40 minutes, they really started to pick up,'' 
Ruff said. ``I think late in the game we saw more of how we play. 
We played OK in the beginning, but it was not desperate hockey.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But all that changed as the time ticked away Thursday night and  
the Sabres gained momentum. 
</P>
<P>
	Jason Woolley made it 3-2 when he collected a loose puck just in  
front of the left point, whirled and fired it past Bruins goalie 
Byron Dafoe at 9:37 of the third period. 
</P>
<P>
	Bruins players said they noticed a discernible difference in the  
Sabres' play. 
</P>
<P>
	``As the game went on, they got faster,'' Bruins wing Anson  
Carter said. ``Their passes were crisper. Their hits were better. 
We could see them coming into their game form.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No one knew for sure why the Sabres got off to such a slow  
start, but a few offered suggestions. 
</P>
<P>
	Dafoe thought the Sabres suffered from too much rest last week,  
and Boston coach Pat Burns thinks the Sabres had too much success. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe too many people patted them on the back and they got  
overconfident,'' Burns said. 
</P>
<P>
	Regardless, Burns said the Sabres will be ready for Game 2 on  
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were on their game in the third period and I expect that  
in the first period of the next game,'' Burns said. 
</P>
<P>
	After practice on Friday, several Buffalo players acknowledged  
they were rusty early in the first period, but they felt they did 
better than expected. 
</P>
<P>
	``We played really good in the first period, considering we had  
nine games off,'' Buffalo wing Dixon Ward said. ``We started to 
skate better as the game moved on. 
</P>
<P>
	``They know what to expect from us, they're a well-prepared  
team,'' Ward said. ``And we know what to expect from them.''

<HEADLINE> Mistrial in Julie Hiatt Steele Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) -- First Susan McDougal. Now Julie Hiatt  
Steele. Prosecutor Kenneth Starr's investigation of the president 
and first lady is stuck in a new gear: jury deadlock. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Claude Hilton's decision to declare a  
mistrial Friday in Ms. Steele's trial casts new doubt on the 
testimony of presidential accuser Kathleen Willey, Starr's main 
witness against her one-time friend Ms. Steele. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of convictions that might put a successful end to his  
investigation, Starr faces critical decisions about whether to 
attack or retreat. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be nice to get a decision'' from a jury so that  
prosecutors can ``move on to other areas'' of the investigation, 
said Starr deputy Jay Apperson. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's time to celebrate,'' Ms. Steele said outside the  
federal courthouse. ``It's time to start my life again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her comments may be premature.  
</P>
<P>
	Starr could seek to retry her. He has a similar decision to make  
regarding Mrs. McDougal, whose trial ended in deadlock less than a 
month ago in Little Rock, Ark. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele undercut Mrs. Willey's story of an unwanted sexual  
advance by Clinton. Mrs. McDougal refused to give grand jury 
testimony about her former Whitewater partners, the Clintons. 
</P>
<P>
	Both were charged with obstruction of Starr's probe.  
</P>
<P>
	In a three-day trial, Ms. Steele's attorneys assailed Mrs.  
Willey's credibility, depicting her as a publicity-seeking woman 
who has repeatedly lied. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele planned to testify in her defense until Wednesday  
night, when her lawyers told her they felt the cross-examination of 
Mrs. Willey's credibility had been so effective that the wisest 
strategy would be to call no witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	According to people familiar with Ms. Steele's situation, she  
resisted the idea of not testifying. They said the Steele team 
finally made the decision Thursday morning not to put on defense 
witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other reasons that Ms. Steele wanted to testify was to  
counter Mrs. Willey's suggestions that Ms. Steele was eager to go 
to the tabloid press with the story of the Clinton-Willey incident. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted of all charges, Ms. Steele could have faced up to  
35 years in prison and $1 million in fines. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Willey testified that she rebuffed a ``very forceful''  
sexual advance by Clinton and told Ms. Steele about the incident 
hours after it occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele said the first time she ever heard of a  
Clinton-Willey encounter was in March 1997, when Mrs. Willey called 
her and asked her to lie about it to a Newsweek reporter. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors produced three witnesses who said Ms. Steele  
informed them she had known of the alleged Clinton advance before 
1997. Each of the three witnesses testified Ms. Steele insisted to 
them later that she hadn't told them. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys questioned why Mrs. Willey now remembers the  
alleged encounter with Clinton and conversations with Ms. Steele in 
much more detail than she did the first time she told the story 
under oath, during a January 1998 deposition for the Paula Jones 
sexual harassment lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Trying to depict Mrs. Willey as emotionally unbalanced, Ms.  
Steele's lawyers made Mrs. Willey recount a grocery store 
confrontation in which she called Ms. Steele a four-letter word. 
Mrs. Willey said she regretted the confrontation but accused Ms. 
Steele of attacking her in TV interviews and public appearances 
over the past year. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele's lawyers also delved into Ms. Willey's taking of  
various antidepressants, including Prozac. Mrs. Willey said she had 
been depressed for some time after her husband's suicide, which 
occurred the day of the alleged Clinton advance. 
</P>
<P>
	And Mrs. Willey admitted she lied to Starr's investigators when  
they asked about a past relationship in which she had pretended to 
be pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
	Rather than abandoning their witness, Starr's office gave her a  
second grant of immunity from prosecution as a result of that lie.

<HEADLINE> Alleged Cuban Spies Charged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- New charges were filed Friday against  
defendants accused in what authorities say was the largest Cuban 
spy ring uncovered in the United States in decades. 
</P>
<P>
	The new charges included conspiracy to perpetrate murder in  
connection with the February 1996 shootdown of two planes flown by 
a Cuban exile group, the Justice Department said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	A grand jury indictment filed in federal court in Miami on  
Friday accuses Gerardo Hernandez and several others of conspiring 
to have a violent confrontation with airplanes flown by Brothers to 
the Rescue, a Cuban exile group. Four members of the exile group 
died three years ago when Cuban fighter jets shot down two small 
planes searching for rafters in international waters. 
</P>
<P>
	``The object of the conspiracy was for co-conspirators to  
function as covert spies serving the interests of the government of 
the Republic of Cuba within the United States by gathering and 
transmitting information to the Cuban government concerning United 
States military installations, government functions and private 
political activity,'' the indictment said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the indictment Friday, Hernandez was charged with conspiracy  
to commit murder, an offense that could put him in prison for life. 
After the 1996 shooting, the indictment said, Cuba's spy agency 
recognized Hernandez for his role and promoted him to captain. 
</P>
<P>
	The 14 defendants also were accused of infiltrating, informing  
on and manipulating anti-Castro Cuban political groups in Miami and 
Dade County, spreading disinformation within the groups and 
carrying out orders from the Cuban government. 
</P>
<P>
	One of them, Juan Pablo Roque, also known by the nickname  
``German,'' was assigned to penetrate and inform on Brothers to the 
Rescue. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten defendants were arrested in September 1998 and remain in  
pretrial detention, prosecutors said. Five of them have already 
pleaded guilty to spy-related charges. Arrest warrants have been 
issued for four others, including Roque. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial on all charges is scheduled for September.

<HEADLINE> FAA Official Books Dec. 31 Flight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Her bags are packed, she's ready to go.  
</P>
<P>
	FAA Administrator Jane Garvey has booked a cross-country airline  
flight for New Year's Eve to make a public display of her 
confidence in the agency's readiness for potential Year 2000 
computer problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Garvey will be joined on her journey by Ray Long, head of the  
FAA's Y2K program, as well as a contingent of reporters. They will 
leave Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport about 6 p.m. on 
Dec. 31, flying on a regularly scheduled American Airlines flight 
to Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	During the trip, Garvey will cross the first potential Year 2000  
time problem, at 7p.m. EST. That will be midnight Greenwich Mean 
Time, the time standard used by air traffic control systems and 
internally by many airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of an old programming technique, some computer software  
views dates in a two-digit format, such as ``99'' for 1999. There 
is widespread concern that without repairs, computers will 
malfunction on New Year's Eve as the clock strikes midnight and the 
year changes to ``00,'' which some computers might perceive as 1900 
instead of 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA expects to have repaired, tested and fielded all its new  
software by June 30. Last month, the agency staged a live test in 
Denver to show that radars, radios, landing lights and other 
aviation equipment could handle the transition without problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Airlines and aircraft makers such as Boeing and Airbus Industrie  
have also been certifying that they will not have problems with the 
changeover, but there is concern that smaller airports and some 
foreign carriers may not be ready. 
</P>
<P>
	Following her arrival in Dallas, Garvey is scheduled to fly to  
San Francisco on another American flight, arriving at 12:07 a.m. 
local time -- seven minutes into the new century. 
</P>
<P>
	FAA officials picked Garvey's routing not with an eye toward the  
clock or the calendar, but the weather map. They chose a southern 
routing out of concern that the trip might get scrubbed because of 
an early winter snow or ice storm in a more northerly climate.

<HEADLINE> Bonds Fall; Yields at 11-Month High / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Government bond prices fell for a second  
straight session Friday, even after a government unemployment 
report reined in fears of inflation. Yields reached their highest 
levels since last June 4. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond dropped 11/32  
point, or $3.44 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in 
the opposite direction, rose to 5.81 percent from 5.78 percent late 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond prices got a temporary lift from the release Friday morning  
of the Labor Department's monthly unemployment report, which showed 
that while the labor market remained strong, wages were not rising 
sharply. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices had tumbled Thursday after Federal Reserve Chairman Alan  
Greenspan expressed concern that the economy's continued growth is 
too imbalanced to sustain. Greenspan's remarks fueled concern that 
the Fed will raise interest rates in order to cool off the economy 
and prevent a rekindling of higher inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	The jobless report initially boosted the inflation-sensitive  
bond markets. But after a temporary bounce, prices headed south 
again as traders seemed to cling to Greenspan's warning. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the market is awaiting Monday's quarterly auction of  
government securities, which will bring another $27 billion in 
bonds and notes into the market. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond prices were mostly lower in the broader market as well.  
Prices of short-term Treasury securities ranged from 1/32 point 
higher to 1/16 point lower. Intermediate maturities fell between 
1/16 and 9/32 point, reported Bridge Telerate, a financial 
information service. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 4.60 percent as the  
discount remained unchanged from Thursday at 4.48 percent. 
Six-month yields were 4.67 percent, as the discount held steady at 
4.50 percent. One-year yields were 4.77 percent as the discount 
fell by 0.01 percentage point from late Thursday to 4.54 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, fell to 4.69 percent from 4.87 percent late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds rose to 122 22/32 from 122 20/32 Thursday. 
The average yield to maturity slipped to 5.33 percent from 5.34 
percent.

	Commander Describes POW Mistreatment  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As the three U.S. soldiers released by  
Yugoslavia traveled home today, their commander said they were 
treated most harshly during their first week of captivity but were 
also subjected to less severe mistreatment, including punches to 
the stomach and slaps in the face, throughout their incarceration. 
Maj. Gen. David Grange, spoke to Pentagon reporters from his office 
in Germany. He said the soldiers were forced to read anti-NATO 
propaganda under the threat of injury or death, and to wear hoods 
over their heads.

	Julie Hiatt Steele Jury Deadlocked

<P>
	ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) -- Jurors said today they were ``hopelessly  
deadlocked'' in the case of Julie Hiatt Steele, who is charged with 
obstructing Kenneth Starr's investigation of President Clinton. 
U.S. District Judge Claude Hilton ordered the jurors to ``make one 
more attempt'' to reach a verdict. The panel had already 
deliberated for 7 1/2 hours in the trial of Ms. Steele, who is charged 
with making false statements that undercut her former friend 
Kathleen Willey's allegation of an unwanted sexual advance by 
Clinton.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's unemployment rate edged up  
slightly to 4.3 percent in April as manufacturing continued to be 
battered by the global economic crisis, but a flood of new jobs in 
service industries helped to push the unemployment rate among 
blacks to the lowest level on record. The unemployment rate for 
blacks fell to 7.7 percent in April, the lowest percentage since 
tracking began in 1972. The rate is double the 3.8 percent 
unemployment rate for whites.

<HEADLINE> Rabbi Pleas Guilty in Bingo Scam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- A rabbi and five other people pleaded guilty  
Friday to stealing about $1.5 million from bingo games intended to 
benefit his congregation. 
</P>
<P>
	Rabbi Jacob Lustig, 72, and his five co-defendants face jail  
terms of six months to a year when they are sentenced next month. 
Police will also take $1 million in assets from Lustig to pay for 
the costs of their investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Lustig, the rabbi of Knesseth Israel in Cincinnati for more than  
20 years, said he was in charge of a bingo operation in three Ohio 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
	The games, which cost 25 cents to $10 each, promise cash prizes.  
Unlike regular sit-down bingo games, the instant scratch-off games 
do not have to be licensed or report their proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
	The proceeds were supposed to benefit Lustig's congregation, but  
investigators found that of the more than $2 million the operation 
took in during 1996 and 1997, just $500,000 went to charity. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said some of the money was used to pay people who  
sold the instant games. Under Ohio gambling laws, only volunteers 
may do that.

<HEADLINE> Yankees' Knoblauch Day-to-Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- After narrowly avoiding a debilitating injury on  
a vicious take-out at second base, Chuck Knoblauch said he was 
scared to even look at a replay. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps emboldened by a positive medical report, Knoblauch  
finally did catch a replay Friday of Corey Koskie's rolling slide 
into second base a day earlier in Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	``To see it really made me appreciate more how fortunate and  
lucky I am that nothing serious happened,'' said Knoblauch, who 
missed New York's 10-1 win over Seattle on Friday night because of 
a severely bruised lower left leg. ``I got blindsided. I've never 
been hit that hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Knoblauch, limping around the Yankees clubhouse, received two  
hours of treatment on the leg and ankle Friday. He hopes to play 
sometime this weekend, but manager Don Zimmer said Tuesday might be 
a more realistic goal. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if it is longer than that, the Yankees know they escaped  
what could have a serious injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``As soon as it happened, I didn't even wait for a medical  
report. I paged (vice president of scouting) Mark Newman right away 
to see what we had a Triple-A,'' Yankees general manager Brian 
Cashman said. ``I was expecting the worst. I thought it could be a 
Joe Theismann-like situation and his career could be in jeopardy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The play that almost cost the Yankees their second baseman  
happened to save them the game. With the bases loaded and one out 
in the eighth inning, Ron Coomer hit a chopper to Derek Jeter at 
shortstop. Jeter threw to Knoblauch for the force, and it appeared 
he had no chance at the double play. 
</P>
<P>
	But Koskie came barreling into the base and rolled up  
Knoblauch's leg before the relay throw. Second base umpire Jim 
Joyce called Coomer out at first on Koskie's interference, getting 
New York out of the jam and setting up its 10th-inning win. 
</P>
<P>
	Koskie tried to apologize to Knoblauch after the game, but the  
Yankees second baseman hadn't yet returned from the hospital. 
Knoblauch doesn't feel that Koskie, who played with Knoblauch at 
the Twins' spring training camp in 1997, made a dirty play. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think he was trying to injure me,'' Knoblauch said.  
``He's a good kid and he plays hard. He got a little reckless 
though.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Twins manager Tom Kelly called Zimmer less than 10 minutes after  
the game and apologized for Koskie's play. Zimmer, who wasn't even 
looking at the play, said after viewing a replay that he was amazed 
Knoblauch didn't break a leg or tear knee ligaments. 
</P>
<P>
	Zimmer started utilityman Luis Sojo in Knoblauch's place at  
second and had Chad Curtis bat leadoff against the Mariners. 
</P>
<P>
	Curtis has been one of the Yankees' struggling left fielders,  
hitting just .167 with a .276 on-base percentage coming in -- not 
exactly numbers a manager wants from his leadoff hitter. 
</P>
<P>
	``As soon as Knoblauch got hurt, the first thing I thought of  
was who is going to lead off,'' Zimmer said. ``The first name that 
came to me was Curtis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Curtis reached base three times, going 0-for-2 with two walks  
and was hit by a pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	Sojo went 1-for-4 with one run, one RBI and an error in the  
field.

<HEADLINE> Duke's Maggette Still Undecided </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DURHAM, N.C. (AP) -- Corey Maggette finished his last final exam  
Friday afternoon and then left the Duke campus, possibly for the 
last time. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-6 freshman forward stood up about a dozen reporters  
and three television crews who were at Cameron Indoor Stadium to 
interview him about his decision to return to the Blue Devils or 
turn pro early. 
</P>
<P>
	The move adds to the speculation that Maggette would likely  
return to his hometown of Chicago and decide, like fellow Duke 
underclassmen Elton Brand and William Avery, to declare himself 
eligible for the NBA draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Sports information director Mike Cragg said Maggette hasn't made  
up his mind yet and refused the interview session because he was 
not comfortable responding to a CNN-SI story Thursday night that 
said he was turning pro. 
</P>
<P>
	Maggette, who averaged 10.6 points in 17.7 minutes as Duke's  
sixth man this season, met with Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski late 
Thursday and left the meeting without a decision on his future, 
Cragg said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's going home to discuss this with his parents and be with  
his buddies,'' Cragg said. ``If he has made his mind up, he sure 
hasn't told anybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No college team has ever lost three underclassmen to the NBA  
draft in one season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't be surprised,'' teammate Chris Carrawell said when  
asked if he thought Maggette would enter the NBA draft. ``The 
article after we played DePaul, all that stuff in the paper about 
him being potentially the No. 1 player in the draft, I think kind 
of played in his mind a little bit. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any time you see that you start thinking, `Maybe I don't need  
to stay.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Carrawell and Nate James said they talked to Maggette on Friday  
before he left school, but the freshman didn't show his hand and 
neither one asked him about his future. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really didn't want to touch on that subject because  
everybody is asking him,'' Carrawell said. ``A lot of people are 
asking me so it's got to be double the time for him. I wanted to 
tell him, `Hey look, you need to stay here with me.' I'm selfish.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carrawell said he agreed with Brand's decision to leave early,  
but believes Avery should have stayed and that Maggette should, 
too. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of sad but that's how the times are changing now,''  
Carrawell said. ``With guys now, the motto is to leave in a year or 
two. You are almost cool if you leave school early. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Corey should definitely come back. I think deep, down  
inside he knows he's not ready.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duke, which lost to Connecticut in the national title game,  
would return only three of the team's top nine players if Maggette 
went pro. In addition to the departure of Brand and Avery, Trajan 
Langdon and Taymon Domzalski have graduated and Chris Burgess 
decided to transfer. 
</P>
<P>
	Underclassmen have until May 16 to declare for the NBA draft.

<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- The 17-year-old boy who was dragged to  
safety out of a second-floor window during the Columbine High 
School rampage spoke publicly for the first time Friday, thanking 
his rescuers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't really remember all of it,'' said Patrick Ireland, who  
was shot twice in the head and once in the foot. ``I'm still trying

</P>
<P>
	Ireland was partially paralyzed but was improving. He continues

suffering spasms and other effects of his wounds, but hopes to be 
able to get back to Nintendo and basketball, shooting pool and 
water-skiing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to go back to school as quickly as possible,'' he said.  
``I'm feeling great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ireland said he doesn't know whether a third gunman participated  
in the April 20 attack. Most of the dead were in the library with 
Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
	`''I closed my eyes,'' he said. ``I didn't see anybody.''  
</P>
<P>
	The teen said he went through the window from the second-story  
library because ``it was the shortest way down, out. My whole right 
side was paralyzed. I felt confident there would be someone there 
to catch me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A SWAT team caught him as he fell onto an armored car.  
</P>
<P>
	His mother, Kathy, thanked those who have helped her son and  
respected his privacy during his recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know that everyone has been wondering what happened to the  
boy in the window, and he's doing really really well, and so are 
we,'' she said at a news conference at the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Ireland was one of 23 injured by Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold.  
The two teens killed 12 students and one teacher before killing 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	After the shootings were reported, television broadcast live  
images of the scene outside the building. SWAT teams and rescue 
crews gathered nearby, warily watching for signs of any movement 
inside. The cameras caught Ireland staggering up to the broken 
windows of the library, then sweeping aside broken glass as his 
right arm hung limp out the window. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakewood SWAT team borrowed an armored car and drove up to  
the school building, just beneath the window. Officers were there 
to catch him as he dragged himself out of the library.

<HEADLINE> Bomb Squad Done at Columbine High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- The bomb squad has completed work inside  
Columbine High School and only federal agents are still working at 
the site of a massacre that left 15 people dead. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators discovered nearly 60 bombs at the school,  
Jefferson County sheriff's spokesman Troy Gardalen said Thursday. 
The school, which is closed, will remain a crime scene until the 
end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17, shot and killed 12  
classmates and a teacher on April 20 before killing themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	School district spokesman Rick Kaufman said both gunmen authored  
violent writings in classroom assignments. A creative writing 
teacher was so alarmed by a story submitted by Klebold this 
semester that she spoke to his mother at a parent-teacher 
conference in March. 
</P>
<P>
	``The assignment was violent in nature and included a killing,''  
Kaufman said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Klebold told a guidance counselor it was just a story, Kaufman  
said, and the counselor didn't ``feel he was a threat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kaufman said writings by Harris caught the attention of a  
teacher in an assignment in which students were asked to pretend 
they were an object. 
</P>
<P>
	``(Harris) wrote that he was a shotgun and he fell in love with  
a shotgun shell,'' classmate Rebecca Heins said. 
</P>
<P>
	The teacher told Harris' parents about the bullet story and  
other assignments at a parent-teacher conference this spring. When 
the teacher learned that Harris' father had served in the Air Force 
-- and the younger Harris wanted to go into the service himself -- 
the matter was dropped. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris tried to enlist in the Marines was but was rejected five  
days before the attack because he was reportedly taking a 
medication called Luvox, which is commonly prescribed for 
depression. 
</P>
<P>
	By Thursday, sheriff's investigators had tallied 1,800 leads and  
assigned about 1,400 of them. Nearly 1,000 interviews had been 
conducted. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton has announced that he plans to meet with  
Columbine students and their parents on May 20 in Littleton to 
discuss the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a package containing a ``healing bear'' was delivered  
to Littleton to help comfort the community. The beige bear 
previously comforted mourners in Oklahoma City following the 1995 
bombing of the federal building and in Montoursville, Pa., home to 
victims of the TWA Flight 800 crash.

<HEADLINE>  Jury Gets Marine Pilot Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- A Marine pilot charged with  
obstructing justice knew a videotape he took from his damaged jet 
was going to be destroyed to block an investigation into an air 
accident that killed 20 people in Italy, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	A seven-man military jury was to begin deliberating today on the  
case against Capt. Richard Ashby, who is also charged with 
conspiracy. He could receive up to 10 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who in this situation had the most to gain to make sure there  
wasn't any information about this flight?'' prosecutor Maj. Daniel 
Daugherty said in his closing argument Thursday. ``He handed over 
that tape knowing it was going to be destroyed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 32-year-old Marine pilot doesn't deny removing the tape  
filmed by his navigator. His lawyer, Frank Spinner, said Ashby had 
no criminal intent but had ``exercised poor judgment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby, of Mission Viejo, Calif., was the pilot of a EA-6B  
Prowler that severed a ski gondola cable near Cavalese, Italy, on 
Feb. 3, 1998, plunging the 20 people aboard more than 350 feet to 
their deaths. His acquittal on manslaughter charges in March 
outraged Italians and renewed calls to ban Americans from NATO air 
bases in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	After the jet landed, Ashby put the tape in his flight suit  
pocket. He retrieved it a few days later, wanting to see what was 
on it, he testified, but couldn't find a video player and handed it 
over to the navigator, Capt. Joseph Schweitzer, 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Schweitzer, who was convicted of the charges Ashby faces and  
kicked out of the Marines, said he later threw the tape into a 
bonfire. Schweitzer said he feared that the tape, which included 
shots of the flight before the accident and images of his face, 
would be played in the Italian media with scenes of the carnage. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Ashby and Schweitzer's actions showed  
calculating, criminal intent to mislead investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	``They knew when they brought a $50 million aircraft back badly  
damaged there was going to be an investigation,'' Daugherty said. 
``Without that tape, there's a lot of speculation. Without that 
tape, we'll never know for sure what went on in that cockpit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two back seat crewmen in the radar-jamming aircraft were charged  
after the accident. The charges were dismissed last year.

<HEADLINE> Blazers Focus on Shutting Down Kidd </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Portland Trail Blazers point guard Damon  
Stoudamire seems to know what he's up against playing the Suns' 
Jason Kidd. 
</P>
<P>
	That's why Stoudamire will be getting plenty of help from his  
friends Saturday when the teams begin a first-round playoff series. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's playing like he's the best point guard in the NBA,''  
Stoudamire said of Kidd, one of a handful of serious contenders for 
MVP. ``But I thrive on these kind of challenges.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-4 Kidd has six inches on Stoudamire, the shortest  
player to ever wear a Blazers uniform. Kidd also has gotten more 
attention after having his best NBA season, with career highs in 
scoring (16.9), assists (10.8) and rebounds (6.8). Stoudamire has 
picked up his game recently, but he still finished with career lows 
of 12.6 points, 39.6 shooting and 6.2 assists. 
</P>
<P>
	As if sticking up for their kid brother, Portland guards Isaiah  
Rider and Jim Jackson said they'll be guarding Kidd in Game 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I know Damon, he's coming to play,'' Rider said. ``But it's  
not going to be The Damon and Jason Show.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson, who played with Kidd in Dallas for two seasons  
(1994-96), said the Blazers can't let him get into a rhythm. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got to make Jason work,'' Jackson said. ``You can't  
give him anything easy, because he's the kind of guard that's going 
to look to pass and set up his teammates first. And you can't let 
Jason get hot from the outside, because once he gets his outside 
game going, he's tough to stop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Rider and Jackson, Portland's tag-team shooting guards, are  
on Kidd, that leaves Stoudamire or a combination of players to 
handle 6-4 Rex Chapman. 
</P>
<P>
	Of Portland's three victories over Phoenix this season, Chapman  
missed two because of injury and was tossed from the other game. 
But he's back now, and in recent games against Utah and Houston 
scored 23 and 22 points, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a great shotmaker, one of the best in the league,''  
Portland coach Mike Dunleavy said. ``Even when you're defending him 
well, he has the ability to make the shot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Portland has to worry more about Phoenix's outside shooting than  
its inside game. The Blazers outrebounded the Suns 147-98 in the 
three games. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to take advantage of our size,'' Jackson said. ``They  
have guys that are smaller but quicker, that can shoot the 
perimeter shot, so I think we have to pound the ball inside. We get 
a lot of offensive rebounds and easy baskets. That takes a lot of 
pressure off of us, and that takes them out of their fast break.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The teams have been fixtures in the playoffs throughout this  
decade, with the Blazers making the postseason 17 straight times 
and Phoenix 11 straight. The last time they met, the Suns won 3-0 
in a 1995 first-round series. Against each other, they have 11 wins 
each in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blazers have lost in the first round of the playoffs the  
last six years, but didn't have homecourt advantage in any of those 
series. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now it's a sense of urgency,'' Rider said. ``It's a sense of,  
we want to win, rather than we're happy to be here. Now we realize 
that we're favored to win. We're supposed to win. So it's time to 
take care of business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the No. 2 seed, the Blazers have history on their side. The  
No. 7 seed has knocked off the No. 2 only four times since the 
playoff format went to 16 teams in 1984.

<HEADLINE> Pet, Owners Reunited After Storms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- Mr. Kitty hates garbage men. Tyson responds  
to German commands. Now they're gone, two of the hundreds of pets 
still missing after tornadoes swept through Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike and Connie Cook were at the Oklahoma City Animal Shelter  
when it opened Thursday in hopes they would find Tyson, their 
7-year-old boxer. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got four whites socks and a real big chest,'' Cook said.  
``He follows German commands. He'll sit if you say `platz.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cooks slowly looked through the rows of kennels. Nothing.  
</P>
<P>
	Officials at the shelter said 60 dogs, five cats, two horses, a  
goat, four sheep, a cow, a duck, a parakeet and a snake were 
brought in after Monday's storms. Some of the battered animals 
could hardly open their eyes. 
</P>
<P>
	Dogs huddled in corners, their tails still as visitors  
approached. 
</P>
<P>
	Many animals have been reunited with their owners.  
</P>
<P>
	The last thing Mary Huff of Moore saw when she and her family  
retreated into a bathroom Monday was her Siamese-mix, Tilley, 
flying across the kitchen. Her other cat, Squeaky, ran upstairs as 
the storm approached. 
</P>
<P>
	When the family emerged, the two-story house was flattened and  
there was no sign of the cats. As family members picked through the 
rubble Thursday, a cardboard box crushed under a gun cabinet 
yielded a welcomed surprise. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got one more part of our family,'' Mrs. Huff said,  
cradling Tilley against her chest. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let me take a photo,'' her daughter, Sheri Harris, said as she  
leveled her camera. ``It's a Kodak moment ... If we find the other 
one, our family will be complete.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Midwest City resident Adolfo Garcia wept when his dog, Missy,  
was found amidst the rubble where Garcia's home once stood. 
</P>
<P>
	``God's gift. It's a gift,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Bret Ashby brought the shelter two black dogs that wandered into  
their yard Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know if they're part of the same litter, but they  
won't leave each other's side,'' Ashby said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals sent three  
officers from Texas to Oklahoma City to assist with displaced 
animals. A Web site also was created to list lost and found pets. 
</P>
<P>
	Margit Cummings choked back sobs as she described her tabby cat,  
Mr. Kitty. She put him in the bathroom before the tornado hit. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just want him back,'' she said. ``He's my baby.''

<HEADLINE> Profits Sink at Lloyd's of London </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Greater competition in the British auto insurance  
market contributed to a 48 percent decline in earnings at Lloyd's 
of London and said the downward trend is likely to continue. 
</P>
<P>
	Lloyd's, an insurance market with investors from more than 70  
countries, posted a profit Friday of 606 million pounds, or $993 
million, for 1996, down from a record profit of 1.16 billion pounds 
in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	It releases financial results three years after the fact because  
of the time it takes to process many complex claims. 
</P>
<P>
	``Results inevitably reflect world trends in international  
insurance,'' chairman Max Taylor said in a statement. ``There is no 
evidence of an upturn in conditions yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lloyd's forecasts it will report earnings of 70 million pounds  
for 1997 and expects to show a loss of some 60 million pounds for 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``The trends affecting the industry as a whole, however, suggest  
that the eventual result is likely to be worse than the 
estimates,'' Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
	Increased competition has eroded Lloyd's share in many insurance  
markets. Its lack of innovation in designing new products has also 
played a part, said Jeffrey Dunsavage, an analyst with A.M. Best, 
an insurance rating firm based in Oldwick, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	On the plus side, Lloyd's leads competitors in some important  
markets, and its prestigious reputation continues to carry weight. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1996 profit comprises 359 million pounds in income earned  
during the year plus an allotment of 247 million pounds taken from 
a reserve of funds earned in previous years. The combined figure 
represents a 16 percent return on net insurance premiums. 
</P>
<P>
	Lloyd's fared worst in the auto insurance business, losing 104  
million pounds in 1996. It earned a 22 percent return on net 
premiums in marine insurance and a 20 percent return in non-marine 
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	Lloyd's performed best in the aviation business, posting a 31  
percent return on net premiums. However, overcapacity in that 
market has squeezed profit margins in subsequent years, it said.

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Gore Recounts Depression </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) -- Tipper Gore says she underwent treatment  
for depression, including counseling and medication, after a 1989 
car accident in which her son was injured. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with USA Today, published Friday, the wife of  
Vice President Al Gore talked about her experience with depression 
and said she hoped her story would help others who need treatment 
seek it out. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was definitely a clinical depression and one that I was  
going to have to have help to overcome,'' Mrs. Gore said of the 
period after her son, Albert III, was hurt. He later recovered. 
</P>
<P>
	The family attended counseling together, but Mrs. Gore said that  
afterward she found herself meeting some of the symptoms of 
depression. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you get to this point of being seriously depressed ...  
you just can't will your way out of that or pray your way out of 
that or pull yourself up by the bootstraps out of that. You really 
have to go and get help and I did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gore received counseling from a social worker and  
medication. But she declined to say how long the counseling lasted 
or describe the medication. She cited the recent stir when the 
public learned that one of the teen-agers accused in the Colorado 
high school shootings had been taking the antidepressant Luvox. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a one-size-fits-all kind of answer,'' she said. ``I  
just urge people if they feel like they need to go to a mental 
health professional, to do that and to seek the kind of treatment 
that they and their professional design for them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gore said she was prompted to talk publicly about the issue  
because of her conversations with children in which depression and 
suicide had come up as serious concerns.

	``I think it has made me feel that now is the right time to talk  
about this in personal terms instead of just in policy terms,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In an editorial in the newspaper, Mrs. Gore also spoke out  
against the stigma often attached to mental illness. She called for 
increased attention to a link between mental and physical 
well-being, and she advocated more counseling and support groups as 
well as school programs to help adolescents deal with their 
emotional development. 
</P>
<P>
	While she called it ``extremely frightening'' to come to terms  
with the fact that she needed professional help, Mrs. Gore said she 
now considers herself recovered and is no longer under treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it helps one person than I think it would have been  
worthwhile,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Royals Sale Can Be Salvaged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A $75 million bid to buy the Kansas City Royals  
can win approval if it is reworked with more money and fewer 
investors, baseball officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Miles Prentice, a New York lawyer who has pursued the team for  
almost two years, put together the deal with 40 to 50 investors, 
including some of Kansas City's most prominent families. 
</P>
<P>
	A high-ranking baseball official, speaking on condition he not  
be identified, told The Associated Press the proposal would not be 
approved in its current form. 
</P>
<P>
	That doesn't mean Prentice's group has been rejected. It just  
means the deal -- still being worked on by lawyers, accountants and 
baseball investigators -- must be reshaped. 
</P>
<P>
	The source, plus two other high-ranking baseball officials who  
also spoke on condition of anonymity, said Friday they were 
concerned the group might not be investing enough money to run the 
team for what one said was ``a reasonable amount of time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some officials in baseball's upper echelons have expressed a  
preference for smaller ownership groups, claiming larger 
partnerships are unwieldy and difficult to deal with. But 
commissioner Bud Selig says he isn't worried about that point. 
</P>
<P>
	``The size has never been a factor in any sale,'' Selig said.  
``The size of the group has got to be determined by local 
interests. Sometimes in putting a group together, maybe increasing 
the size helps.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The commissioner spoke with Prentice on Friday but would not  
elaborate on their conversation. 
</P>
<P>
	Selig, who also wouldn't address concerns about the group's  
financing, said a decision on whether owners would vote on the deal 
when they meet in Pittsburgh on June 9-10 would depend on how fast 
his staff processes it. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the three sources said a vote was highly unlikely and  
that baseball intends to seek ``fewer people, more money'' for the 
bid. He also suggested the controversy in Kansas City over the deal 
might speed up the approval process. 
</P>
<P>
	``That I don't know,'' Selig said.  
</P>
<P>
	American League president Gene Budig said ``it would be  
inappropriate'' to comment until the major league baseball staff 
has reviewed the deal further. 
</P>
<P>
	Team sales are touchy subjects for cities, who often fear  
rejection of a bid might cause the franchise to move. 
</P>
<P>
	However, baseball has rejected just one proposed sale in the  
1990s -- Bob Lurie's deal with Vincent Naimoli, who would have moved 
the San Francisco Giants to Tampa Bay. After the rejection, the 
Giants were sold to Peter Magowan, who kept the team in San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	When owners don't like a proposed deal, they simply don't vote  
on it, allowing lawyers for the commissioner's office, the league, 
and the selling and purchasing groups to rework it. 
</P>
<P>
	Prentice's group reached its deal with the Royals' board on Nov.  
13, but it wasn't voted on at baseball's January meeting. Baseball 
postponed its March quarterly meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the proposed sale of majority control of the  
Cincinnati Reds from Marge Schott to Carl Lindner and two other 
limited partners of the team appears to be on a fast track and 
could be voted on next month, two baseball officials said. The deal 
was signed just 2 1/2 weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball is familiar with Lindner, George Strike and William  
Reik and is dealing mainly with arrangements on who will gain 
control after the 80-year-old Lindner dies. In contrast, baseball 
has had to conduct extensive background checks on Prentice's group.

<HEADLINE> Woman Sues To Use ' 7 Dirty Words' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- A woman is suing a company that assigns  
U.S. Internet addresses for the right to use George Carlin's 
``seven dirty words.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The federal lawsuit filed by Lynn Haberstroh of Raymond seeks to  
force Network Solutions Inc., a private company that registers the 
most popular Web names under contract from the government, to allow 
her to register those words in addresses. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a well-defined First Amendment right that is being  
violated,'' said Jonathan Springer, Haberstroh's lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	A California company called Seven Words filed a similar lawsuit  
in that state, after Haberstroh filed hers in January, Springer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	NSI says it merely is following long-established policy on  
public communication. Carlin's seven words -- from an old comedy 
routine -- describe body parts, functions and sexual acts and are 
banned from the airwaves by the Federal Communications Commission 
as part of court-upheld restrictions on obscenity. The words 
effectively are kept off the air by laws forbidding vulgar speech 
that date at least to the Radio Act of 1927 and which were upheld 
in a $1.7 million FCC fine against radio personality Howard Stern 
in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	NSI, which did not respond to phone messages seeking comment on  
Friday, has asked to move Halberstroh's suit to Virginia, where the 
company is based.

<HEADLINE> Barnesandnoble.com IPO Plans Go On </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- There may be signs that Wall Street's frenzy for  
Internet-related stocks may be waning, but Barnesandnoble.com still 
is going ahead with plans for an initial public offering. 
</P>
<P>
	The online bookseller said Thursday that it hopes to raise about  
$300 million in the IPO, selling 25 million shares, or about 18 
percent of the company, for about $12 each. A date for the offering 
hasn't been set. 
</P>
<P>
	The money will help the New York-based company -- jointly owned  
by bookseller Barnes &AMP; Noble Inc. and German media conglomerate 
Bertelsmann AG -- in the fierce battle for market share against 
Amazon.com Inc. and the swarms of smaller outfits vying for a piece 
of the burgeoning online retailing business. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet stocks, especially IPOs, have been the darling of Wall  
Street for the past year, with investors embracing just about any 
company with online operations or even online plans. Many IPOs have 
doubled in the first days of trading and kept on going. 
</P>
<P>
	But this may not be the right time to take an Internet company  
public. For example, the online real estate firm Comps.com sold 
shares earlier this week for $15 each, but fell to $14.25 in its 
first day of trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Internet ``stalwarts'' such as Amazon.com and eBay  
have slumped recently as investors shifted away from high-flying 
technology issues in favor of long-neglected industrial companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, the euphoria for Internet stocks is a little  
overdone,'' said Brian G. Belski, chief investment strategist at 
George K. Baum &AMP; Co., in Kansas City, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, it is safe to say that barnesandnoble.com has a better  
name than an unknown xyz.com company,'' he said. ``But this market 
is still oversaturated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, some analysts say that barnesandnoble.com's IPO may do  
well merely because it is a well-known name and investors have long 
liked the online-bookselling concept. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the last week, we've seen some lower quality IPOs,'' said  
Linda R. Killian, who evaluates IPOs for Renaissance Capital Corp. 
``These companies aren't unique in any way. Barnesandnoble.com is 
not like those.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like many online companies, barnesandnoble.com is a  
fast-growing, but money-losing business. 
</P>
<P>
	In reporting its IPO plans to the Securities and Exchange  
Commission, the company said it lost $20.2 million in the first 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales, however, rose to $32.3 million, an increase of 25 percent  
from the fourth quarter of 1998 and up 259 percent from year-ago 
levels. 
</P>
<P>
	The online bookseller also said it now has 1.7 million  
customers, with more than 450,000 shopping for the first time 
during the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	But barnesandnoble.com still lags behind Amazon.com, which is  
quickly building itself into an online shopping hub with a broad 
array of books, music, video, gifts and auctions. Amazon's customer 
tally was 8 million customer at the end of the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnesandnoble.com stock will trade under the symbol ``BNBN'' on  
the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the second time in a year that plans have been announced  
to sell shares of barnesandnoble.com. 
</P>
<P>
	Last August, Barnes &AMP; Noble announced its intention to take its  
online operation public, but decided to postpone the offering after 
Bertelsmann purchased a 50 percent stake in the company.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Negro Leaguer Owens Dies at 98 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- William Owens, a grade school dropout who  
played for a dozen teams in the Negro leagues in the 1920s and '30s 
and finally received a high school diploma three years ago, has 
died of complications from diabetes. He was 98. 
</P>
<P>
	Owens, who died Wednesday, grew up in Indianapolis and had only  
a sixth-grade education when he set out in 1923 to find a career in 
baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	He broke in with the Washington Potomacs that year, played  
briefly with the Indianapolis ABCs and spent the next decade 
barnstorming with many teams before ending his career with the 
Detroit Stars in 1933. 
</P>
<P>
	Owens, known for a good glove and a strong arm, was the starting  
shortstop for the Memphis Red Sox in 1927, when he batted a 
career-high .293. He also played third base and pitched, and a 
photocopied newspaper clipping from the 1920s hanging on the wall 
of his room described him as the ``versatile Mr. Owens, who seems 
to be able to play all the positions on the diamond very credibly 
and then some.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said in a 1996 interview that his finest moment in baseball  
was in a game with Memphis, when he started a triple play. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were playing Birmingham and had 'em 6-5 in the ninth  
inning,'' he recalled. ``Our pitcher went wild and he walked three 
men, starting with the leadoff man. ... The cleanup man came up to 
bat and he lined a ball right at me. I jumped about 2 feet up in 
the air and caught the ball and ran to second base, stepped on it 
and threw the ball to first base. That made three outs. That was a 
good day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Owens bristled when he was asked if he would have liked a chance  
to play in the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	``Well, we played in the major leagues,'' he said. ``We were  
just as good as anybody. That was the major leagues when I made the 
triple play. I played with (Hall of Famer) Oscar Charleston. He was 
as good as any ballplayer that ever played the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After baseball, Owens returned to Indianapolis and later owned  
and operated a pool hall and tavern, traveled the Midwest as a 
professional pool player and became a Little League baseball 
volunteer. 
</P>
<P>
	After construction of Interstate 70 forced him to close his pool  
hall in 1965, Owens spent much of his time working with children, 
teaching them baseball, painting and pool -- and preaching the 
importance of education. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always tell them, `Whatever you do, go to school, go to  
school,''' he said, shaking his head. ``I only went through sixth 
grade. I was so wrapped up in my success, I didn't realize how 
important school was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Owens' family, with the help of people in the community,  
petitioned the state for an honorary general equivalency diploma, 
which he received in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Wynette's Widower Dropped From Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Tammy Wynette's daughters have dropped  
her widower from a $50 million wrongful death lawsuit that blames 
the country singer's doctor for her death. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today, my nightmare has ended,'' George Richey said Thursday.  
He noted that Wednesday would have been Wynette's 57th birthday, 
and called it ``appropriate that we honored the occasion this 
way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit was filed April 5 by three of Wynette's daughters --  
Tina Jones, Jackie Daly and Georgette Smith. Her fourth daughter, 
Gwen Nicholas, later joined the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Richey is Wynette's fifth husband and is not the father of any  
of the women. 
</P>
<P>
	The daughters claim their mother's health wasn't monitored  
closely enough, and that she was given too many painkillers prior 
to her death on April 6, 1998. Dr. Wallis Marsh, Wynette's personal 
physician, was named along with Richey in the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	The daughters plan to continue seeking a judgment against Marsh.  
</P>
<P>
	``George believed -- and still believes -- that Dr. Marsh provided  
excellent medical care to Tammy during the last years of her life, 
enabling her to have some quality of life she would not have 
otherwise had,'' said his attorney, Robert Ritchie. 
</P>
<P>
	Wynette had 20 No. 1 hits and was perhaps best known for ``Stand  
By Your Man.''

<HEADLINE> Unemployment Edges Up 4.3 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The economy generated almost a quarter-million  
new jobs last month, even as factory work continued to melt away. 
The surge outside manufacturing helped push the unemployment rate 
among blacks down to its lowest level on record, although the 
overall national rate edged up to 4.3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``The economy is so strong that it is reaching down and touching  
everyone. Across all income groups, ethnic groups and educational 
levels, everyone is doing well,'' said economist Mark Zandi of 
Regional Financial Associates in West Chester, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	For a year now, unemployment has held below 4.5 percent, as the  
country's longest economic expansion in peacetime history continues 
to surprise analysts with its vigor in the midst of hard times 
overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	April's overall jobless rate of 4.3 percent was only slightly  
above the 29-year-low of 4.2 percent reached in March, the Labor 
Department said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The unemployment rate for blacks fell to 7.7 percent, the lowest  
since the government began tracking it separately in 1972. Blacks 
remain jobless at more than double the 3.8 percent unemployment 
rate for whites, however. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton, who hopes the healthy economy will persuade  
voters to keep a Democrat in the White House next year, called the 
report ``good news for our working families.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Confident American consumers have been borrowing briskly to help  
finance a spending spree. In March, their credit outstanding, 
excluding mortgage debt, advanced at a 1.4 percent annual rate to a 
seasonally adjusted $1.32 trillion, the Federal Reserve said in a 
separate report Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	A 9.9 percent increase in auto loans offset a 1.6 percent drop  
in revolving credit -- primarily credit cards -- and a 6.1 percent 
decline in a catchall category that includes loans for education, 
vacations, mobile homes and boats. 
</P>
<P>
	The overall March increase in borrowing was the smallest gain in  
a streak of more than two years of monthly increases. However, it 
came on the heels of large jumps of 8 percent in February and 14.1 
percent in January. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite strong demand from shoppers at home, U.S. manufacturers  
have been hurt by a global economic crisis that started in Asia 
almost two years ago. Falling demand for American products abroad 
and an influx of discount-priced imports have brought the U.S. 
trade deficit to a record high. 
</P>
<P>
	The April unemployment report showed that jobs in manufacturing  
fell by another 29,000, bringing total job losses at American 
factories since March of last year to 402,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The weakness in manufacturing included a drop of 7,000 jobs  
because of a strike in shipbuilding. Other manufacturing industries 
that shed jobs last month were in aircraft, industrial machinery, 
textiles, mining and fabricated metals such as steel. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss of factory jobs, however, was more than compensated for  
by a huge gain of 131,000 new positions in the service industries. 
</P>
<P>
	Employment for business services climbed by 51,000 while  
temporary help firms added 18,000 jobs. Jobs in health care rose by 
23,000, while restaurants and bars added 64,000 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, payroll jobs shot up 234,000 in April, accelerating  
sharply from a 7,000-job gain in March, which had been the weakest 
showing in more than three years. 
</P>
<P>
	The unemployment rate, based on a separate survey of households,  
rose in April because while jobs were up, the number of people 
entering the work force looking for employment grew even more 
rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said Wednesday that the  
U.S. economy is enjoying a ``phenomenal'' performance but warned 
that imbalances reflected by tight labor markets were likely to 
trigger pressures on employers to increase wages. That could lead 
to higher inflation down the road. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's job report, however, showed average hourly earnings  
were up only 3.2 percent over the past 12 months, an even better 
showing than the previous month. 
</P>
<P>
	``This report shows ... nothing to suggest that life is changing  
in any fearful way,'' said Robert G. Dederick, economic consultant 
to the Northern Trust Co. in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, most economists don't believe the Fed will move at  
its next meeting May 18 to increase interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Labor Secretary Alexis Herman said reports this week showing  
March increases in orders to American factories give reason for 
optimism even about that weak sector of the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We obviously continue to be concerned about the declines in  
manufacturing (employment), but this report ... indicates that we 
are beginning to see a stemming of that tide,'' Herman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the current economic expansion, the previous record low  
unemployment rate for black Americans was 9 percent, set in 
December 1973. In January 1983, it reached a record high of 21.2 
percent.

<HEADLINE> Stars' Hatcher Back From Suspension / Hockey Game Story  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- This is just what the road-weary St. Louis Blues  
don't need -- a revved-up Derian Hatcher returning to the Dallas 
Stars after a seven-game suspension. 
</P>
<P>
	But that's exactly what they'll get Saturday night when Dallas  
tries to sweep its first two home games in the best-of-7 series. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatcher was suspended for seven games after breaking the jaw of  
Phoenix's Jeremy Roenick. He missed two in the regular season, and 
the Stars have gone 5-0 in the playoffs without their big 
defenseman. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas coach Ken Hitchcock said Hatcher has been waiting for the  
moment he can get back on ice. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to have to tone him down a little bit,'' Hitchcock  
said of the team's captain. ``He is a real excited guy right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brett Hull, who finally scored a playoff goal for Dallas in  
Thursday night's 3-0 win over the Blues, said Hatcher has been 
missed despite the team's winning ways. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's our leader and our captain, and he gives us a big,  
physical presence,'' Hull said. ``To have him back fills a big 
hole. He'll add some toughness to our lineup.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hatcher said he's been counting the hours.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm ready to go,'' he said. ``It's been hard watching these  
guys play without me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As Hatcher is returning, Stars forward Pat Verbeek is sitting  
out a game. He and Jamal Mayers of the Blues were suspended Friday 
for one game apiece after slashing incidents on Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Verbeek, who was just returning from an injury, slashed St.  
Louis center Pierre Turgeon on the knee with 2:18 left in the 3-0 
Stars victory in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	Two minutes later, Mayers took a baseball-type swing to the arm  
of Dallas defenseman Darryl Sydor. 
</P>
<P>
	Both players will miss Game 2, on Saturday in Dallas. They will  
be eligible to return for Game 3, on Monday in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	Hull found his scoring touch again Thursday night.  
</P>
<P>
	Hull was signed as a free agent -- after 10 years with St. Louis  
-- to provide a playoff scoring punch. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had a lot of emotion going into the game against his old  
team,'' Dallas goalie Ed Belfour said. ``We were all happy to see 
him get that goal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hull's role with Dallas has changed since he came from St.  
Louis, where he was allowed to play a more freewheeling game. With 
the Stars, he is expected to also check and play defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always heard that I was just a one-dimensional player  
who's just out there to score,'' he said. ``But I fit into this 
system nice. It's been nice to throw that label back into people's 
faces.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hull clearly was revived after he scored.  
</P>
<P>
	``When Brett scored that goal you could see it lifted a burden  
off his shoulders,'' Hitchcock said. ``He had been down about the 
chances he missed. You could see that goal gave him life and made 
him a different kind of player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hull said he needed to score.  
</P>
<P>
	``You're a goal scorer, and you haven't scored, and you can say  
it doesn't matter, but it does,'' Hull said. 
</P>
<P>
	Blues coach Joel Quenneville was mad at Verbeek, who slashed  
Pierre Turgeon late in the game causing a knee injury that is not 
expected to keep the St. Louis center off the ice. 
</P>
<P>
	``That Verbeek slash was pretty vicious,'' Quenneville said.  
``Verbeek looked like he knew what he was doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Turgeon said, ``I lost feeling in my leg, and we'll see how it  
feels later.'' 
</P>
<P>
	St. Louis goalie Grant Fuhr said the Blues might be able to  
rally around the hit. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe we lacked emotion,'' Fuhr said. ``It was clearly our  
worst game of the playoffs. That was a cheap shot on Pierre. I hope 
the league deals with it.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Maria Hsia is ``a rainmaker ... a people  
person'' who could attract clients for immigration lawyers but 
cannot handle her own finances, her lawyer said at the start of her 
tax evasion trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Hsia, an ally of Vice President Al Gore accused of funneling  
illegal donations to the 1996 Clinton-Gore campaign, is being tried 
on separate charges of failing to report $175,000 in income over 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
	In opening statements Thursday, defense attorney Kenneth Barish  
accused the government of trying to intimidate Ms. Hsia, an 
immigration consultant. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is more than a tax case,'' Barish said, pointing to the  
prosecutors. ``The evidence will show these gentlemen are part of 
the campaign finance task force.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Richard Paez cut Barish off and told him to  
stop trying to argue the case during opening statements. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Hsia is accused in a case filed in Washington, D.C., of  
conspiracy involving donations funneled through Buddhist nuns at a 
1996 fund-raiser. Gore attended the event at the Hsi Lai Buddhist 
Temple. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax evasion case, she was indicted on six counts in 1998  
but five counts were dismissed. A government appeal of the 
dismissals is pending while the case goes ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecution attorney Greg Tortella said Ms. Hsia failed to file  
an income tax return in 1994 and underestimated her income in 1995 
and 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The key government witness will be a bookkeeper, Richard Tsai,  
who is expected to say that Ms. Hsia instructed him to show less 
income than she actually made. 
</P>
<P>
	Barish said that Tsai led Ms. Hsia to believe he was filing all  
of the proper forms. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ms. Hsia is a people person. She is not good with numbers,''  
said Barish. ``She is able to generate clients. In law we would say 
she is a rainmaker.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted, Ms. Hsia, an immigrant from Taiwan, could face  
imprisonment and thousands of dollars in fines. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Hsia is one of several foreign-born fund-raisers whose role  
in the 1996 campaign has become the focus of a Justice Department 
prosecution task force. 
</P>
<P>
	The fate of her campaign finance case will affect at least two  
others in which government prosecutors have alleged that successful 
Democratic fund-raisers made false statements to campaign 
regulators.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Negro Leaguer Owens Dies at 98 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- William Owens, a grade school dropout who  
played for a dozen teams in the Negro leagues in the 1920s and '30s 
and finally received a high school diploma three years ago, has 
died of complications from diabetes. He was 98. 
</P>
<P>
	Owens, who died Wednesday, grew up in Indianapolis and had only  
a sixth-grade education when he set out in 1923 to find a career in 
baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	He broke in with the Washington Potomacs that year, played  
briefly with the Indianapolis ABCs and spent the next decade 
barnstorming with many teams before ending his career with the 
Detroit Stars in 1933. 
</P>
<P>
	Owens, known for a good glove and a strong arm, was the starting  
shortstop for the Memphis Red Sox in 1927, when he batted a 
career-high .293. He also played third base and pitched, and a 
photocopied newspaper clipping from the 1920s hanging on the wall 
of his room described him as the ``versatile Mr. Owens, who seems 
to be able to play all the positions on the diamond very credibly 
and then some.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said in a 1996 interview that his finest moment in baseball  
was in a game with Memphis, when he started a triple play. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were playing Birmingham and had 'em 6-5 in the ninth  
inning,'' he recalled. ``Our pitcher went wild and he walked three 
men, starting with the leadoff man. ... The cleanup man came up to 
bat and he lined a ball right at me. I jumped about 2 feet up in 
the air and caught the ball and ran to second base, stepped on it 
and threw the ball to first base. That made three outs. That was a 
good day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Owens bristled when he was asked if he would have liked a chance  
to play in the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	``Well, we played in the major leagues,'' he said. ``We were  
just as good as anybody. That was the major leagues when I made the 
triple play. I played with (Hall of Famer) Oscar Charleston. He was 
as good as any ballplayer that ever played the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After baseball, Owens returned to Indianapolis and later owned  
and operated a pool hall and tavern, traveled the Midwest as a 
professional pool player and became a Little League baseball 
volunteer. 
</P>
<P>
	After construction of Interstate 70 forced him to close his pool  
hall in 1965, Owens spent much of his time working with children, 
teaching them baseball, painting and pool -- and preaching the 
importance of education. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always tell them, `Whatever you do, go to school, go to  
school,''' he said, shaking his head. ``I only went through sixth 
grade. I was so wrapped up in my success, I didn't realize how 
important school was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Owens' family, with the help of people in the community,  
petitioned the state for an honorary general equivalency diploma, 
which he received in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Iverson's Accomplishments Mount </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Allen Iverson has a saying he uses only  
around close friends and family. It comes up whenever questions 
arise about his past, future or place in basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	``Watch my work,'' Iverson likes to say. ``Just watch my work.''  
</P>
<P>
	That body of work is becoming ever more impressive. The 76ers  
star is still struggling to come of age and master a game he's been 
accused of taking lightly or disparaging with his perceived 
arrogance and freewheeling style. 
</P>
<P>
	But his list of accomplishments now includes more than a  
crossover dribble that no one can stop. It includes a playoff berth 
and one of the prizes he's cherished since the first time he 
dribbled a basketball: an NBA scoring title. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know how hard he worked and how much he wants to be  
considered the best,'' said Que Gaskins, a close friend who was 
with Iverson on Wednesday night when he learned he'd beaten 
Shaquille O'Neal in one of the closest scoring races in NBA 
history. ``This is one of those steps in that right direction of 
being considered one of the greatest players in the league.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After scoring 33 points in the Sixers' 105-100 overtime victory  
over the Detroit Pistons Wednesday night, Iverson left the arena 
not knowing whether it was enough to lead the league. All he knew 
was that O'Neal needed 40 points to surpass him. 
</P>
<P>
	Iverson told reporters that he didn't want to watch the Lakers'  
game against Portland to see how the race turned out. His friends 
had to drag him to a local nightspot to check it out. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody stay humble,'' Iverson told Gaskins, as they settled  
in at a restaurant just outside the city. 
</P>
<P>
	When Shaq scored only 18 points and fell short, there were  
cheers, champagne and even a few tears from Iverson, who became the 
76ers' first scoring champion since Wilt Chamberlain in 1965-66. 
</P>
<P>
	``He got pretty teary-eyed, hugging everybody,'' Gaskins said.  
``He was just thanking all the people that were close to him and 
stuck by him and really believed in him. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had to embrace for at least five minutes. It was just one  
of those unforgettable moments, one of those moments I'll never 
forget. I'm just glad I was there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Iverson edged O'Neal 26.75 to 26.31 in a tight battle that was  
reminiscent of the 1977-78 race in which George Gervin defeated 
David Thompson by .07 points on the final day of the season. 
O'Neal, who led the league in scoring in 1994-95, also lost by .44 
points to David Robinson in 1993-94. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would have been very selfish for me to try and get 40  
tonight,'' O'Neal said. 
</P>
<P>
	The first scoring title of the post-Michael Jordan era went to  
Iverson, a 6-foot speed demon who has been criticized for 
everything from his criminal record and fashion statements to his 
brief history of alleged selfishness on the court. 
</P>
<P>
	Just as he does when he drives fearlessly to the basket, Iverson  
stood up to all the giants who have led the NBA in scoring -- names 
like Chamberlain, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Jerry West and Elvin Hayes. 
He is the shortest scoring champion in NBA history, eclipsing the 
6-foot-1 Nate ``Tiny'' Archibald, who did it in 1972-73. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it would be a great for the league, a little kid  
winning the scoring championship,'' Sixers coach Larry Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
	Iverson and Gaskins, who is in charge of Iverson's brand name at  
Reebok, quickly ducked out of practice when reporters arrived 
Thursday. Maybe he wanted to let the scoring title fade away and 
focus on a more important matter -- his first trip to the playoffs 
and the Sixers' first since 1990-91. 
</P>
<P>
	Philadelphia clinched the sixth seed in the East with the  
victory and plays Orlando in the first rounding beginning Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He knows my agenda,'' team president Pat Croce said of  
Iverson. ``Get me a ring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the closing seconds of the game, Iverson passed up one final,  
stat-padding shot, choosing instead to dribble out the clock. He 
did it in style, laughing and high-stepping around like a kid on a 
playground. 
</P>
<P>
	As a rookie, or even last year, Iverson almost certainly would  
have heaved the ball toward the rim. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's only my third year,'' Iverson said. ``I think the problem  
with me coming in was that people looked at my talents and they 
didn't want to let me grow as a basketball player and as a person. 
I think over time, maybe people will start to understand me and 
some of the critics will back off.''

<HEADLINE> Colombian Rebels Free More Hostages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTERREY, Colombia (AP) -- Leftist rebels who abducted everyone  
aboard a hijacked Colombian airplane a month ago released seven 
hostages Friday, delivering with them an indictment of what they 
called the country's corrupt political system. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-five hostages, including an American, remain in rebel  
hands in the remote northern region where they've been held since 
the April 12 hijacking. 
</P>
<P>
	Colombia's No. 2 rebel group, the National Liberation Army, or  
ELN, handed over the captives to a commission that included the 
attorney general, foreign diplomats and the Red Cross. Among the 
released were an Ecuadorian nun and a Venezuelan. 
</P>
<P>
	The remaining hostages are in good health, said Attorney General  
Jaime Bernal Cuellar. The ELN gave no indication, however, if or 
when they might be released. 
</P>
<P>
	At a brief news conference on the overgrown soccer field where  
they touched down in Red Cross helicopters Friday afternoon, 
released hostages said they had been treated well. They also urged 
those still in captivity to not lose hope. 
</P>
<P>
	``I cried with happiness,'' when the helicopters arrived, the  
Venezuelan, Otto Duarte, told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	In a lengthy statement read by a freed hostage, the ELN issued a  
scathing critique of successive governments for failing to address 
Colombia's vast gap between the rich and the poor, rampant 
corruption and political exclusion the rebels say justifies its 
decades-old insurgency. 
</P>
<P>
	``Colombia's armed conflict is rooted in a structural crisis  
caused by bad governments,'' said the communique read by Miguel 
Fajardo Rojas, a university administrator. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not clear what it would take for a resumption of peace  
talks with the government. President Andres Pastrana has said he 
will only resume contact with the group once it releases all the 
hostages. 
</P>
<P>
	Most analysts believe the mass abduction was designed to  
persuade the government to give greater weight to ELN in its peace 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	Pastrana has put most of his emphasis on getting negotiations  
going with Colombia's other major rebel army, the larger and more 
powerful Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC. 
</P>
<P>
	The hostage drama began when five ELN guerrillas dressed as  
businessmen commandeered a flight en route to Bogota from 
Bucaramanga. The Avianca Fokker 50 was forced to land on a remote 
airstrip, where dozens of rebels ushered all 41 passengers and crew 
to secret jungle camps. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine hostages were released almost immediately, the majority of  
them elderly and infirm.

<HEADLINE> La Nina-Tornado Link Eyed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	La Nina, the weather phenomenon behind record snow in the  
Northwest this winter and dry conditions in Florida, is being 
blamed for influencing the deadly tornadoes that swept across the 
Plains this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``The signal is there,'' said Steve Byrd, science officer for  
the National Weather Service in Omaha, Neb. ``The incidence of 
tornadoes on the central Plains is slightly higher during La 
Nina.'' 
</P>
<P>
	La Nina refers to a large, unusually cold pool of water in the  
equatorial Pacific Ocean that develops every several years, and 
influences weather patterns around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	It works in reverse of the more common and better-understood El  
Nino, which is a warming of Pacific waters. 
</P>
<P>
	La Nina has generated a stronger, colder jet stream in the upper  
atmosphere, while warm, wet air at lower levels has been pulled 
from the Gulf of Mexico into the Plains states. 
</P>
<P>
	This combination generated the ferocious thunderstorms that  
spawned dozens of twisters, including a historic F-5 tornado in 
Oklahoma City. An F-5 is the most powerful tornado there is. At 
least 41 people have died in Oklahoma alone as the result of the 
severe weather. 
</P>
<P>
	The current La Nina has persisted for nearly a year, fueling  
weather that resulted in 91 feet of snow on Mount Baker in 
Washington this winter and severe drought in Florida. Most La Ninas 
last only several months, and there are signs that this one is 
beginning to wane. 
</P>
<P>
	The weather pattern comes on the heels of an El Nino that  
dissipated in 1998. Studies suggest tornadoes were reduced by as 
much as 24 percent in some regions during the most recent El Nino. 
</P>
<P>
	El Ninos increase storm activity in California and South America  
while calming things down in the Atlantic and Caribbean. La Ninas, 
by contrast, reduce storms in California but stir up trouble in 
other parts of the country as well as in India and southeast Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	This spring, meteorologists in Nebraska and Iowa already have  
tallied 17 tornadoes -- five more than normal by early May. ``We're 
already living up to predictions,'' Byrd said.

<HEADLINE>  Jets Owner Leon Hess Dies at 85 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Leon Hess, who saw his New York Jets win the  
Super Bowl in 1969, then waited a generation to see them get close 
again, will not realize his dream of making it back to the NFL's 
showcase game. 
</P>
<P>
	The oil tycoon and Jets owner died Friday at 85.  
</P>
<P>
	The Jets said Hess died at Lenox Hill Hospital from  
complications of a blood disease. He was hospitalized last month 
with a broken hip. 
</P>
<P>
	Hess, quiet and low key and one of the wealthiest owners in  
sports, had been waiting since 1969 for a chance to win the Super 
Bowl again. The Jets, then part of the American Football League, 
jolted the NFL's Baltimore Colts in a landmark victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall of Fame quarterback Joe Namath had guaranteed a Jets'  
victory over the Colts in Super Bowl III. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never seen him in any other light than caring,'' Namath  
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, Hess felt greater urgency for another  
championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm 80 years old. I want results now,'' he said when he hired  
coach Rich Kotite in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	After a 4-28 record in two seasons, Kotite was succeeded by Bill  
Parcells. In his second season, Parcells got the Jets within a 
victory of the Super Bowl in January. They lost to the Denver 
Broncos in the AFC championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	Jets star Keyshawn Johnson recalled seeing Hess after that loss.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure nobody will forget him standing there when we came  
off the plane and thanking us,'' Johnson said. ``That meant a 
lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jets president Steve Gutman called Hess a decisive man who  
wouldn't interfere with those he hired. 
</P>
<P>
	``When Bill Parcells was hired, you recall Leon saying, `You're  
the man, one voice, one spokesman. It's yours to run as if you own 
it,''' Gutman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Parcells regrets Hess won't be able to watch the team he said.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm saddened by the loss of this great man who had such a  
quiet dignity,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hess was the fourth major New York sports figure to die in the  
last six months. Weeb Ewbank, who coached the 1969 team, died in 
November, as did former Knicks coach Red Holzman. Baseball great 
Joe DiMaggio died in March. 
</P>
<P>
	``Leon Hess was a great American success story,'' NFL  
commissioner Paul Tagliabue said. ``There will be a terrible void 
as the Jets pursue their dream of another Super Bowl.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Jets were Hess' greatest passion after he stepped down four  
years ago as chief executive officer of Amerada Hess Corp. Hess 
started in the oil business in 1933, taking over the one-truck 
delivery service his Russian-immigrant father operated in Asbury 
Park, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody was broke in those days,'' Hess said. ``I had to pay  
for the truck before I delivered the oil.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hess won a battle with Phillips Petroleum, and bought Amerada in  
1969. Last year, Forbes magazine listed his the net worth at $720 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite his demeanor, Hess was a driven man, whether he was  
digging up and selling clams along the New Jersey shore during the 
Depression or negotiating an oil deal. 
</P>
<P>
	He rarely spoke about himself, but on the day he hired Parcells  
from New England, Hess was asked about negotiating with demanding 
Patriots owner Robert Kraft. 
</P>
<P>
	Hess recalled an encounter over oil prices with Moammar Gadhafi.  
The Libyan strongman watched as an associate in fatigues pounded on 
a table, removed a pistol from a holster and placed it the table. 
</P>
<P>
	``That doesn't scare me,'' Hess said.  
</P>
<P>
	Neither did the prospect of buying into the moribund New York  
Titans in 1963. The next season, they became the Jets, and in 1977 
he bought out his partners, notably Sonny Werblin and Phil Iselin. 
</P>
<P>
	Hess was known as a generous owner who promoted a family  
atmosphere for his team. When Dennis Byrd was temporarily paralyzed 
in 1992, Hess offered financial and medical support. 
</P>
<P>
	``To him, I owe everything,'' Byrd said.  
</P>
<P>
	On league matters, Hess most often sided with other seniors  
owners such as Wellington Mara of the Giants, Ralph Wilson of the 
Buffalo Bills and Art Modell of the Baltimore Ravens. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a sad, sad day for the National Football League and my  
family,'' said Modell, who angered Hess when he moved the Cleveland 
Browns to Baltimore in 1996. ``The NFL is not as decent ... as it 
was yesterday because of the passing of Leon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mara, who shared Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J., with  
Hess, called him a devoted family man. 
</P>
<P>
	``The NFL has lost one of its most beloved and respected  
leaders,'' Mara said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will miss him very much as a colleague, but even more so as  
a close longtime friend,'' Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerry Jones of the Dallas Cowboys, who represented the new breed  
of owners, called Hess a ``peer of mine and someone who I admired 
as one of the great American businessmen of our time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hess is survived by his wife of 51 years, Norma; son John, who  
succeeded him as CEO of Amerada Hess Corp; two daughters, Connie 
Williams, a state representative in Pennsylvania, and Marlene Hess; 
and seven grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
	The funeral is Monday at Park Avenue Synagogue in Manhattan.

<HEADLINE> Mistrial in Julie Hiatt Steele Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) -- With jurors deadlocked, a judge declared  
a mistrial today in the case of a woman charged with obstructing 
Kenneth Starr's investigation of President Clinton by giving false 
testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	Julie Hiatt Steele's trial was the only criminal case to grow  
out of the independent counsel investigation of the president's 
relationship with Monica Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	After more than eight hours of deliberation, the foreman told  
the court that jurors were hopelessly deadlocked on all four 
charges against Ms. Steele. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's time to celebrate,'' Ms. Steele said outside the  
courtroom. ``It's time to start my life again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Starr deputy Jay Apperson said prosecutors would consider  
seeking a new trial. ``It would be nice to get a decision,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, U.S. District Judge Claude Hilton announced that he had  
gotten a note from the jury saying, ``Any further deliberation will 
not -- and the word 'not' has been underlined -- change the 
outcome.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele, of Richmond was charged with lying in statements and  
grand jury testimony that undercut her one-time friend Kathleen 
Willey's allegation of an unwanted sexual advance by Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has denied the allegation.  
</P>
<P>
	If convicted of all charges, Ms. Steele could have faced up to  
35 years in prison and $1 million in fines. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele looked elated after her lawyers came back from a  
short bench conference with the judge and whispered to her that a 
mistrial would be declared. 
</P>
<P>
	The case focused on the testimony of Mrs. Willey, whose  
credibility was assailed by Ms. Steele's lawyers. They depicted her 
as an admitted liar whose story was nonetheless embraced by Starr's 
prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Willey testified that she rebuffed a ``very forceful''  
sexual advance by Clinton, telling Ms. Steele about the incident 
hours after it occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele said the first time she ever heard of a  
Clinton-Willey encounter was in March 1997 when Mrs. Willey called 
her and asked her to lie about it to a Newsweek reporter. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial was the second setback in less than a month for Starr,  
who was unable to convict Whitewater figure Susan McDougal in a 
case in Little Rock, Ark. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele's lawyers didn't call any defense witnesses.  
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Nancy Luque had said in opening statements that  
Ms. Steele would testify, but her legal team decided not to put her 
on the witness stand where she would be exposed to 
cross-examination by Starr's prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors produced three witnesses who said Ms. Steele  
informed them she had known of the alleged Clinton advance before 
1997. Each of the three witnesses testified Ms. Steele insisted to 
them later that she hadn't told them. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys questioned why Mrs. Willey now remembers the  
alleged encounter with Clinton and her conversations with Ms. 
Steele in much more detail than she did the first time she told the 
story under oath -- during her January 1998 deposition for the Paula 
Jones sexual harassment lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Trying to explain her state of mind during the Jones deposition,  
Mrs. Willey testified that she had been frightened by a threatening 
encounter two days earlier with a stranger who knew that her cat 
was missing and her car tires had been slashed. 
</P>
<P>
	She also said Clinton lawyer Robert Bennett in a conversation  
suggested she invoke her Fifth Amendment right against 
self-incrimination rather than answer the questions -- a statement 
she said she regarded as a ``threat coming from the president.'' 
Outside of court, Bennett denied ever making such a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Trying to show Mrs. Willey as emotionally unbalanced, Ms.  
Steele's lawyers made Mrs. Willey recount a grocery store 
confrontation in which she called Ms. Steele a four-letter word. 
Mrs. Willey said she regretted the confrontation, but said Ms. 
Steele had been attacking her in TV interviews and public 
appearances over the past year. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele's lawyers also delved into her taking of various  
antidepressants, including Prozac. Mrs. Willey said she had been 
depressed for some time after her husband's suicide which occurred 
the same day as the alleged Clinton advance. 
</P>
<P>
	And Mrs. Willey admitted she lied to Starr's investigators when  
they asked about a past relationship in which she had pretended to 
be pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
	Rather than abandoning their witness, Starr's office granted a  
second grant of immunity from prosecution from Starr's office as a 
result of that lie.

<HEADLINE> Web Helps Locate Tornado Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- The world turned to the Internet to track  
friends and relatives who might have been in the path of this 
week's deadly tornadoes. And victims logged on to find aid, shelter 
and relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Within minutes of Monday's storms, Internet users were posting  
messages, checking media Web sites for the latest news and casting 
e-mails for possible victims. 
</P>
<P>
	A message forum on the Web site of The Daily Oklahoman was busy  
nearly as soon as it went online Tuesday, manager Kelly Dyer said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``People would write, `I know there are instances of people  
concerned about this area of town. Was it hit? Somebody else would 
come back and say yes or no,'' Ms. Dyer said. ``There was a lot of 
communication going on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Initially, one forum was established just for missing persons  
and a second for people looking for lost pets and personal items. 
``Those two sort of merged together,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the day after the storms that killed at least 41  
people in Oklahoma and five in Kansas, the Oklahoman site had more 
than a half-million hits. Each day since then there have been more 
than 1.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The Oklahoman also has compiled a list of 1,500 names of tornado  
victims, providing their previous address and where they are now, 
if known. 
</P>
<P>
	In the hard-hit city of Moore, victims went to the undamaged  
library to use the computers. Web sites enabled victims to 
communicate with relatives and get information on aid and shelter. 
</P>
<P>
	Many around the world simply posted prayers and messages of  
hope. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am saddened by what has happened,'' said one message. ``I  
have been only on the Web for a week now and can't believe of what 
has happened. We the city of Brandon, Manitoba, send our prayers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Be assured that here in New Zealand we are very aware of your  
plight,'' said another.

<HEADLINE>  Marine Guilty in Cable Car Tragedy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- Relatives of the 20 people killed when  
a Marine pilot's jet severed a ski gondola cable in Italy found 
little consolation in his conviction on obstruction of justice 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Capt. Richard Ashby was found guilty Friday of obstruction and  
conspiracy for helping destroy a personal videotape of the Feb. 3, 
1998 flight. His earlier acquittal on involuntary manslaughter 
charges outraged Italians and led to demands that Americans be 
banned from NATO air bases in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's convicted for destroying a videotape but not convicted  
for killing 20 people,'' said Sindy Renkewitz of Burgstadt, 
Germany, whose father and sister died in the tragedy. ``We still 
don't know who is responsible for what happened. Nobody could give 
us an answer to this question, so for us this is no end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby, 32, of Mission Viejo, Calif., returns Monday for the  
completion of a sentencing hearing. He could get up to 10 years in 
prison or be dismissed from the Marines. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuseppe Pontrelli, a lawyer for Italians who live near the  
accident site, said he doubted Ashby would get the punishment he 
deserves. 
</P>
<P>
	``We predict that Ashby will be kicked out of the Marines but  
won't get any jail time,'' Pontrelli said. ``Yet again there will 
be a sentence that has all to do with the internal hierarchy of the 
American military but nothing to do with the death of 20 innocent 
people, who remain definitively without justice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the sentencing hearing that began immediately after the  
verdict, Ashby offered a conciliatory statement to the jury. 
</P>
<P>
	``Personally, I want to do what's right,'' he said. ``I take  
responsibility for what I did or did not do. I wish we would have 
done things differently.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before the conviction, Ashby held out hope that if he was  
acquitted he would be sent to F-18 flight school in his native 
Southern California. He had been selected for the advanced training 
before his squadron of EA-6B Prowler jets finished their tour of 
duty flying over Bosnia in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	His mother, Carol Anderson, tearfully testified that her son had  
always dreamed of flying, loved the Marines and was dependable. His 
family wore grim expressions as they left the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
	The video was shot from the cockpit of the Prowler during part  
of the flight by Ashby's navigator, Capt. Joseph Schweitzer, 31, of 
Westbury, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	Once Ashby landed the crippled jet at the NATO air base at  
Aviano, Italy, he took the video out. He testified that he later 
gave it to Schweitzer at the navigator's request. Schweitzer said 
he later threw it into a bonfire. 
</P>
<P>
	Schweitzer earlier pleaded guilty to identical charges in the  
destruction of the tape and was ordered dismissed from the 
military. Manslaughter charges against him were dropped after 
Ashby's acquittal in March. 
</P>
<P>
	Two back seat crewmen in the radar-jamming aircraft were charged  
after the accident. The charges were dismissed last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Schweitzer testified that he burned the tape because it  
contained footage of his smiling face taken before the accident, 
pictures that he feared would be embarrassing if broadcast 
alongside images of the bloody gondola scene. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators never saw what was on the tape, but Ashby and  
Schweitzer maintained that it contained no incriminating 
information. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors, however, argued the two got rid of the tape to  
block the investigation. During Ashby's manslaughter trial, he was 
accused of flying too low and too fast when he struck the cable. 
</P>
<P>
	``They knew when they brought a $50 million aircraft back badly  
damaged there was going to be an investigation,'' Maj. Daniel 
Daugherty said. ``Without that tape, we'll never know for sure what 
went on in that cockpit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rita Wunderlich of Germany, whose husband died with a group of  
friends when the yellow gondola fell 350 feet to the ground, said 
the Marines were protecting their own when Ashby was acquitted of 
manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now it was a question of the honor of the Marine Corps,'' she  
said.

<HEADLINE>  Macedonian Border Remains Closed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BLACE, Macedonia (AP) -- With Macedonia's main border posts  
closed to Kosovo refugees, hundreds of ethnic Albanians have turned 
to mountain routes across a harsh frontier dotted with land mines, 
officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a dangerous place ... if we have a lot of people going  
over this way, it could pose some serious problems,'' said Red 
Redmond, a spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	Macedonian authorities choked off the refugee flow Wednesday,  
blaming Western nations for allowing more than a quarter-million 
people to overwhelm the nation, slightly larger than Vermont. 
</P>
<P>
	The government said more than 350 people have trekked across the  
wilderness from Kosovo. At least three refugees were killed last 
week in the area after triggering land mines. 
</P>
<P>
	After weeks of increasing refugee flow, the regular border  
points were nearly deserted. Only people with Macedonian passports 
or travel papers were allowed across at Blace, about 12 miles 
northwest of the capital, Skopje. 
</P>
<P>
	Those few people who did manage to cross said there were 300 to  
400 people on the other side of the border in the town of Djeneral 
Jankovic. The refugees were huddled outside on a raw day with a 
persistent drizzle. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were lots of children crying,'' said Mithad Sahiti, an  
ethnic Albanian allowed to cross to stay with his daughter in the 
Macedonian town of Tetovo. ``They looked very cold.'' 
</P>
<P>
	International monitors saw about 1,000 refugees being forced  
back into Kosovo shortly after the Blace border was closed. Some 
refugees estimated 10,000 people or more were clogged in the border 
village on Thursday after convoys and at least one train arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	A new train pulled into Djeneral Jankovic today, but it had only  
four coaches and very few people on it, Sahiti said. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking in Geneva, Kris Janowski, a spokesman for the U.N.  
refugee agency, said that Macedonia had assured the agency that 
refugees can still cross the border from Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	But there were conflicting statements.  
</P>
<P>
	Macedonian officials first said they will enforce a new  
one-for-one policy -- the number of refugees allowed in will 
correspond with the number taken out of the country. But later 
officials said the border was open to everyone, but Serb forces 
were holding back the refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	The UNCHR said today there were now 230,900 refugees in  
Macedonia, about one-tenth of the country's normal population. 
</P>
<P>
	Macedonia's leaders fear the refugee influx could alter the  
balance between the majority Slavs and ethnic Albanians, who made 
up about a third of the population before the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	Serious controversy could threaten the power-sharing government  
and lead to a potential political crisis in a nation hosting more 
than 15,000 NATO soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile in neighboring Albania, Ray Wilkinson, the UNHCR  
spokesman Kukes, said today that the organization was running short 
of cash for its Kosovo-related operations. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the agency asked for $143 million from donor nations for  
the Kosovo crisis and had received $77 million so far. All but $1 
million of that has been spent, at a rate of more than $1.5 million 
a day. 
</P>
<P>
	He said a total of 405,360 refugees had crossed so far into  
Albania from neighboring Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> Japan Jobless Claims Said a Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The number of Japanese who joined the unemployment  
rolls jumped 16 percent to a record 2.18 million people in the just 
ended fiscal year, Kyodo News agency reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese Labor Ministry figures for fiscal 1998 broke the  
record high of 1.95 million set in fiscal 1976, Kyodo said. 
</P>
<P>
	Labor Ministry officials were unavailable for comment late  
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's jobless rate shot up to a record 4.8 percent in March, a  
sign of the continuing severity of the country's deepest recession 
since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	In the fiscal year that ended March 31, the number of  
job-holders fell to 53.53 million, down by 390,000 from the 
previous year, the Kyodo report said. Japan's population is 126 
million.

<HEADLINE> Early Star Wars Review: Cool Effects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Summer blockbuster? Without a doubt. A sci-fi  
masterpiece that will please all its fans? Probably not, but it's 
got some cool effects. 
</P>
<P>
	That's the buzz on the new ``Star Wars'' movie, now that it has  
been finally seen by a select few. 
</P>
<P>
	``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace'' was screened  
Tuesday night in eight North American cities for movie theater 
executives, their families and -- apparently -- a bundle of ``Star 
Wars'' fans who somehow finagled some tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost immediately, early reviews hit cyberspace, followed by  
the reactions to the reviews, then the reactions to the reactions, 
along with all manner of counterclaims and insults over the movie, 
which opens nationwide May 19. 
</P>
<P>
	``Guys, it's a movie!'' responded Tom Sherak, distribution head  
of 20th Century Fox, which is releasing the film for George Lucas. 
``It isn't the Bible! It's fun, it's enjoyable, it's escapism. But 
it's a movie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Uh huh.  
</P>
<P>
	In what was titled ``What I believe to be the FIRST review  
anywhere on the Internet,'' Ronald Epstein wrote on his Home 
Theater Forum Web site (www.hometheaterforum.com) that while he was 
impressed, the movie may not satisfy hard-core ``Star Wars'' fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks like `Star Wars,' it smells like `Star Wars' and it  
feels like `Star Wars.' However, is it a `Star Wars' that we are 
going to walk away satisfied with? Well ... perhaps, but not for 
everyone,'' Epstein wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	While the amateur critics loved the action sequences and most of  
the effects, including what they found to be an incredible 
underwater sequence, some reviewers thought the two-hour-plus movie 
dragged a bit in places, that it was a little too kid-oriented and 
that one of the computer-generated characters, Jar Jar Binks, was 
annoying. 
</P>
<P>
	Such views were quickly countered by those who, like Jerry  
Rhoades on Home Theater Forum, pronounced movie ``PHENOMENAL!!!!'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't watch it to analyze and match other people's reviews and  
thoughts to the film, just sit back, relax and enjoy the ride,'' he 
said. ``I did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On a leading ``Star Wars'' Web site, www.theforce.net, a writer  
using the nickname BetterJedi wrote: ``Wow! What a film. I'm going 
to have to see it about 10 or 15 times to take it all in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But another writer, going by Job21, wasn't as impressed. ``It  
was a dream come true at first but quickly turned into a 
nightmare,'' Job21 said. 
</P>
<P>
	That was countered by a fusillade of reaction from fans, many of  
whom questioned whether Job had even seen the movie, pointing out 
his review lacked the details that would suggest he was there. 
</P>
<P>
	Financially, the early buzz -- or for that matter the reactions  
from the professional critics who see ``Phantom'' Friday night -- 
won't mean a thing initially, said Paul Dergarabedian of box office 
tracker Exhibitor Relations Co. 
</P>
<P>
	``This movie is critic-proof,'' he said. ``I think it doesn't  
matter what anybody says, good, bad or indifferent. The film is 
going to play big in those first two weeks without question.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After that ... only the Force knows.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Leon Hess, who saw his New York Jets win the  
Super Bowl in 1969, then waited a generation to see them get close 
again, will not realize his dream of making it back to the NFL's 
showcase game. 
</P>
<P>
	The oil tycoon and Jets owner died Friday at 85.  
</P>
<P>
	The Jets said Hess died at Lenox Hill Hospital from  
complications of a blood disease. He was hospitalized last month 
with a broken hip. 
</P>
<P>
	Hess, quiet and low key and one of the wealthiest owners in  
sports, had been waiting since 1969 for a chance to win the Super 
Bowl again. The Jets, then part of the American Football League, 
jolted the NFL's Baltimore Colts in a landmark victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall of Fame quarterback Joe Namath had guaranteed a Jets'  
victory over the Colts in Super Bowl III. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never seen him in any other light than caring,'' Namath  
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, Hess felt greater urgency for another  
championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm 80 years old. I want results now,'' he said when he hired  
coach Rich Kotite in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	After a 4-28 record in two seasons, Kotite was succeeded by Bill  
Parcells. In his second season, Parcells got the Jets within a 
victory of the Super Bowl in January. They lost to the Denver 
Broncos in the AFC championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	Jets star Keyshawn Johnson recalled seeing Hess after that loss.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure nobody will forget him standing there when we came  
off the plane and thanking us,'' Johnson said. ``That meant a 
lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jets president Steve Gutman called Hess a decisive man who  
wouldn't interfere with those he hired. 
</P>
<P>
	``When Bill Parcells was hired, you recall Leon saying, `You're  
the man, one voice, one spokesman. It's yours to run as if you own 
it,''' Gutman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Parcells regrets Hess won't be able to watch the team he said.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm saddened by the loss of this great man who had such a  
quiet dignity,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hess was the fourth major New York sports figure to die in the  
last six months. Weeb Ewbank, who coached the 1969 team, died in 
November, as did former Knicks coach Red Holzman. Baseball great 
Joe DiMaggio died in March. 
</P>
<P>
	``Leon Hess was a great American success story,'' NFL  
commissioner Paul Tagliabue said. ``There will be a terrible void 
as the Jets pursue their dream of another Super Bowl.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Jets were Hess' greatest passion after he stepped down four  
years ago as chief executive officer of Amerada Hess Corp. Hess 
started in the oil business in 1933, taking over the one-truck 
delivery service his Russian-immigrant father operated in Asbury 
Park, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody was broke in those days,'' Hess said. ``I had to pay  
for the truck before I delivered the oil.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hess won a battle with Phillips Petroleum, and bought Amerada in  
1969. Last year, Forbes magazine listed his the net worth at $720 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite his demeanor, Hess was a driven man, whether he was  
digging up and selling clams along the New Jersey shore during the 
Depression or negotiating an oil deal. 
</P>
<P>
	He rarely spoke about himself, but on the day he hired Parcells  
from New England, Hess was asked about negotiating with demanding 
Patriots owner Robert Kraft. 
</P>
<P>
	Hess recalled an encounter over oil prices with Moammar Gadhafi.  
The Libyan strongman watched as an associate in fatigues pounded on 
a table, removed a pistol from a holster and placed it the table. 
</P>
<P>
	``That doesn't scare me,'' Hess said.  
</P>
<P>
	Neither did the prospect of buying into the moribund New York  
Titans in 1963. The next season, they became the Jets, and in 1977 
he bought out his partners, notably Sonny Werblin and Phil Iselin. 
</P>
<P>
	Hess was known as a generous owner who promoted a family  
atmosphere for his team. When Dennis Byrd was temporarily paralyzed 
in 1992, Hess offered financial and medical support. 
</P>
<P>
	``To him, I owe everything,'' Byrd said.  
</P>
<P>
	On league matters, Hess most often sided with other seniors  
owners such as Wellington Mara of the Giants, Ralph Wilson of the 
Buffalo Bills and Art Modell of the Baltimore Ravens. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a sad, sad day for the National Football League and my  
family,'' said Modell, who angered Hess when he moved the Cleveland 
Browns to Baltimore in 1996. ``The NFL is not as decent ... as it 
was yesterday because of the passing of Leon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mara, who shared Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J., with  
Hess, called him a devoted family man. 
</P>
<P>
	``The NFL has lost one of its most beloved and respected  
leaders,'' Mara said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will miss him very much as a colleague, but even more so as  
a close longtime friend,'' Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerry Jones of the Dallas Cowboys, who represented the new breed  
of owners, called Hess a ``peer of mine and someone who I admired 
as one of the great American businessmen of our time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hess is survived by his wife of 51 years, Norma; son John, who  
succeeded him as CEO of Amerada Hess Corp; two daughters, Connie 
Williams, a state representative in Pennsylvania, and Marlene Hess; 
and seven grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
	The funeral is Monday at Park Avenue Synagogue in Manhattan.

<HEADLINE> Dying Doctor Finds Own Replacement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLQUITT, Ga. (AP) -- Diagnosed with liver cancer in January and  
given only eight weeks to live, Dr. Peggy Rummel launched a 
national campaign to find someone to take over her practice in this 
one-stoplight town. 
</P>
<P>
	She died Friday, a little more than a week after seeing her wish  
come true. She was 43. 
</P>
<P>
	The South Carolina native came to tiny Miller County, population  
6,400, in 1983 because she wanted to practice rural medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the years, she became like a native -- raising eight foster  
children, providing refreshments for the high school proms, 
organizing the Easter egg hunts and almost single-handedly keeping 
the county's 38-bed hospital in business. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to be proud of little places,'' she said this week,  
``and not assume that because it's small, it's inadequate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After getting her grim prognosis this winter, she began making  
calls and put a letter on the Internet to try to find a new doctor 
for Colquitt. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Dr. Ifekan-Shango Simon, who had approached the town  
about being its doctor in October, when it didn't yet need him, 
said he would take over the practice. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Rummel started bleeding internally. She decided to  
have a blood transfusion because she didn't want to die while her 
son, Richard, a pre-med major at Georgia Southwestern University, 
was taking finals. He rushed home to be with her before returning 
to finish his exams Friday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``Apart from the goal of trying to keep things going for the  
hospital, her second most important thing to her was Richard's 
education,'' said her husband, Larry. ``Because he is so bound and 
determined to follow in his mama's footsteps.'' 
</P>
<P>
	True to form, Rummel made her own funeral arrangements. She  
wanted to be cremated and have some of her ashes scattered in 
Colquitt. 
</P>
<P>
	A patient room at Miller County Hospital will be renovated and  
dedicated to her.
