<HEADLINE> Canada's New Housing Price Up Slightly in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Canada's new housing price index was
up 0.2 percent in March compared with the same period a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time since June 1994 that the annual change
has been positive, Statistics Canada said today.
</P>
<P>
The composite index increased 0.1 percent from February to
March 1997. This is the fifth consecutive month that the index has
registered a gain.
</P>
<P>
Statistics Canada attributed the improvement in housing markets
in recent months to "higher consumer confidence coupled with
favorable interest rates."
</P>
<P>
"However, the competitive nature of housing markets continued
to moderate prices increases in a number of surveyed cities," the
federal agency noted.
</P>
<P>
Annual housing construction intentions were up 23.2 percent in
the first quarter of 1997 compared with 1996.
</P>
<P>
And according to Canada Mortgage and Housing, the annual pace
of housing starts was also up 37.6 percent for the first quarter
compared with the same period a year earlier.

<HEADLINE> UK's Grand Metropolitan to Merge with Guinness Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Britain's two drinks giants Grand
Metropolitan (GrandMet) and Guinness Monday announced a surprise
20 billion pounds (32.5 billion US dollars) merger to create the
world's seventh largest food and drinks company, GMG Brands.
</P>
<P>
The merger will also form the world's leading branded spirits
and wine group with combined spirits sales of over 100 million
cases a year.
</P>
<P>
The companies said that the merger would generate cost savings
of about 175 million pounds (283.5 million US dollars) a year in
the third year of trading.
</P>
<P>
Guinness chairman Tony Greeener said that it was possible there
would be around 2,000 job losses out of a combined global
workforce of 85,000.
</P>
<P>
But they would be distributed around the world and would take
place gradually over three years and a minority would be in the
UK, he added.
</P>
<P>
Under the deal, Guinness shareholders will retain their shares
in the renamed company, some 47.3 percent of GMG Brands, while
GrandMet shareholders will get one new GMG share for each GrandMet
share they hold, around 52.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Shareholders stand to gain from share buy-backs worth 2.4
billion pounds (3.9 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The two companies do not expect the deal, which needs approval
from regulatory authorities as well as shareholders, to be opposed
by any official.
</P>
<P>
Joint chairman George Bull said that the product were
complementary, and the group would still have less than 10 percent
of the world's accessible spirits market.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The European Union should set up a
network in which member states can learn from each other's
experience in crime provention policies, Dutch Justice Minister
Winnie Sorgdrager said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Sorgdrager told an EU seminar, held in the Dutch seaside town
of Noordwijk, "If we European wish to prevent an explosive growth
in our prison systems...we need effective policies to prevent
rather than just combat crime."
</P>
<P>
She argued that crime prevention should tackle offences outside
"traditional" areas such as burglary or street crime, and look into
prevention environmental crimes and corruption.
</P>
<P>
The Minister said the effectiveness of crime prevention had been
proven in the Netherlands with crime figures having been stabilized
over the past ten years and a reduction in crime since 1996.
</P>

A police agency called Europol coordinates the exchange of
information between the 15-nation bloc's national police forces.

<HEADLINE> World Health Assembly Pays Special Attention to POPs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The 50th World Health Assembly today
adopted a resolution on the promotion of chemical safety, with
special attention to persistent organic pollutants (POPs).
</P>
<P>
12 POPs including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dioxins,
furans, aldrin, dieldrin, DDT, endrin, chlordane,
hexachlorobenzene (HCB), mirex, toxaphene and heptachlor have been
assessed by the International Program on Chemical Safety (IPCS),
which concluded that there was sufficient evidence to demonstrate
the need for international action on these substances.
</P>
<P>
"None of the organochlorine pesticides contained in the list of
12 POPs is currently recommended for use in agriculture, even
though their use in this context is still sometimes reported,"
IPCS Director Dr Michel Mercier said. "The POPs enter the food
chain as a result of contamination of water, air or soil. Some
populations that eat large amounts of fish or wild animals rich in
fats may thereby be exposed to higher POP levels than the average
population."
</P>
<P>
According to a press release by the World Health Organization
(WHO), of the 12 POPs under consideration, DDT is the only
insecticide still in use for public health purposes, in particular
for malaria and leishmaniasis control, but it continues to be
misused in agriculture.
</P>
<P>
On adopting the resolution, the World Health Assembly called on
members "to take steps to reduce reliance on insecticides for
control of vector-borne diseases through promotion of integrated
pest-management approaches in accordance with WHO guidelines, and
through support for the development and adaptation of viable
alternative methods of disease vector control". It also called on
them "to ensure that the use of DDT, for public health purposes,
is limited to government-authorized programs that take an
integrated approach and that strong steps are taken to ensure that
there is no diversion of DDT to entities in the private sector".

ADDIS ABABA, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Six local Afari girls have
recently committed suicide in Ethiopia's northern Afar Region
defying "abusuma", a traditional marriage imposed on them against
their will.
</P>
<P>
Local people in the neighborhood said the girls shot, hanged
and threw themselves into rivers in a desperate act against
marriage with their cousins.
</P>
<P>
They said the number of young women fighting against
traditional marriage, most of them around 15 years of age, is on
the rise as they prefer death to being the spouses of old men of
80 years of age or even above.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian government said "abusuma" violates women's
rights, urging pertinent bodies to bring about behavioral changes
in local communities.

<HEADLINE> Cook Unveils British Foreign Policy Strategy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Britain's new Foreign Secretary
Robin Cook unveiled here today the new Labor government's foreign
policy strategy, promising to make Britain a leading player in the
European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference launching the document, Cook set
out a series of priorities in a "Mission Statement", saying "New
Labor is determined to bring businesslike approach to the
Government and make Britain a leading player in a Europe of
independent nation states."
</P>
<P>
Cook, who has promised to make a new start with Britain's EU
partners, said that the British government will work for agreement
on the Inter Governmental Conference (IGC) conclusions, while
"resolutely defending British interests."
</P>
<P>
On Britain's six-month EU presidency next year, Cook said: "Our
two main objectives for the British presidency will be to remove
the remaining barriers to trade within the single market and to
get talks on (EU) enlargement off to a flying start."
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Secretary pointed out that the country's security
"will remain based on the North Atlantic Alliance."
</P>
<P>
"We must manage the enlargement of NATO to ensure that a wider
alliance is also a stronger alliance and that the process reduces
rather increases tensions between East and West," he said.
</P>
<P>
Pledging to enhance British prosperity, Cook said that the
Labor government will "make it a top priority for our network of
overseas posts to promote British exports and boost British jobs."
</P>
<P>
On the Europe-Asia summit to be held in London next April, Cook
expressed his conviction that the British government "will work
for enhanced dialogue and specific measures of cooperation,
including trade, investment and technology transfer."
</P>
<P>
Other priorities outlined in Cook's statement include
strengthening the Commonwealth, securing reform of a more
effective United Nations and protection of global environment.

<HEADLINE> S.African Deputy President on Mobutu-Kabila </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The proposed second round
talks between Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko and rebel leader
Laurent Kabila is the last chance for a negotiated peace
settlement for the Zairean crisis, South African Deputy President
Thabo Mbeki said today.
</P>
<P>
If agreement is not reached between the rival parties, "then
in reality it opens the way to a military solution being the only
option," Mbeki told journalists in Cape Town, the legislative
capital of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks are reportedly due to be held on Wednesday
aboard South African naval vessel the Outeniqua in the Congolese
port Pointe Noire.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the meeting is the last chance to resolve the
conflict peacefully, Mbeki said, "I think as things stand we are
in that kind of danger that the meeting on wednesday may very
well be the last chance to find a negotiated solution to this
crisis."
</P>
<P>
Mbeki, who has headed international mediation efforts in the
Zairean conflict, said he would make last-ditch effort to secure
agreement on the principle issues that needed to be resolved.
</P>
<P>
The principle points related to the timetable in which Mobutu
should hand over power to a transitional authority and the
composition of the transitional body.
</P>
<P>
Mobutu's role during the period of transition and how early he
will retire from power also need to be agreed, Mbeki said.
</P>
<P>
Both the South African mediators and United Nations special
envoy to Zaire Mahomed Sahnoun were consulting both sides to "try
and move towards a position where these principle issues can be
resolved on Wednesday".
</P>
<P>
" We are hopeful that it will be possible to reach this
agreement... If this agreement is not reached it opens the way to
a military solution being the only option," Mbeki warned.
</P>
<P>
Mobutu and Kabila held their first face-to-face talks aboard
the South African naval vessel on May 4, with the two sides
agreeing to hold second round talks within eight to 10 days.

<HEADLINE> Death Toll Rises to 4,000 in Iran's Earthquake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The death toll from a killer quake
in east Iran rose to 4,000 today while the number of injuries
exceeds 6,000, the state-run television said here today.
</P>
<P>
The report said that 195 aftershocks have jolted Gaen and
Birjand regions which were rocked by a powerful 7.1-degree
earthquake at Saturday noon.
</P>
<P>
The Geophysics Institute of Tehran University said that the
magnitudes of the aftershocks ranged from 3 to 5.5 degree on the
Richter scale.
</P>
<P>
Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani today visited the
quake-stricken area of Hadji-Abad, about 800 kilometers east of
Tehran. He said that "it is very bitter for me to see such
heartrending scenes here."
</P>
<P>
"Such a calamity has befallen us due to the negligence of the
former monarchial regime toward rural areas," he said.
</P>
<P>
The president noted that tens of thousands of residential
units resistant to quake should have been built in the
quake-prone areas under the former regime. Now, it would take
years to construct such buildings, he added.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani promised that the government would help those who
have suffered losses in the quake by giving them long-term
interest free loans and grants.
</P>
<P>
He said reconstruction activity would start in the area in
coordination with the Interior Ministry and Ministry of Energy
within the next month.
</P>
<P>
He appreciated the rescue operations and relief activities of
Iranian Red Crescent Society and the Ministry of Health in
setting up makeshift clinics and temporary accommodation for
people.
</P>
<P>
Hamid Mohallati, head of the Emergency Headquarters of the
Red Crescent Society, said that 4,000 tents have been erected at
the quake-hit villages and 3,200 other tents forwarded to the
stricken areas.
</P>
<P>
He said rescue operation is underway in 180 villages by 100
teams consisting of 700 relief workers.
</P>
<P>
More than 2,000 relief workers have been carrying out rescue
operations along with four C-130 aircraft and six helicopters.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the victims are in urgent need of such
relief goods as tents, blanket, medicine, ambulance, blood,
clothing and foodstuff.
</P>
<P>
It is the strongest earthquake occurred in Iran in the past
eight years. A 7.3-degree quake claimed 40,000 lives in northern
Iran on June 21, 1990.

<P>
LONDON, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Britain's new Labor government has
promised urgent action to investigate into the causes and effects
of the so-called Gulf War syndrome.
</P>
<P>
The investigation will examine the possible side-effects of the
drugs taken by British soldiers who fought in the Gulf War in 1991
as protection against chemical and biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
In his first policy statement, Britain's new Armed Forces
Minister John Reid today promised to give "urgent attention" to
the complaints of the hundreds of veterans demanding action from
the Government."
</P>
<P>
"We have an obligation to investigate sympathetically and
thoroughly any illness suffered by those who have served their
country and to provide all the resources necessary to treat them,"
Reid said.
</P>
<P>
Under the government plan, significant new resources will be
pumped into extra research and the medical assessment program to
cut the backlog of veterans waiting to be seen by doctors.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that many of the 1,100 veterans suffering from
illnesses have claimed they were ordered to have the vaccines and
tablets without any warning about possible side-effects.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Borrows to Finance Budget Deficit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe government today
admitted it would have no choice but to borrow money to finance
the budget deficit which economists said could again result in
the rise of interest and inflation rates.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Herbert Murerwa told a budget seminar in the
capital Harare that recourse to borrowing was the only choice as
the International Monetary Fund had withheld crucial aid
following its disagreement with the government's inability to
curb spending and cut fiscal deficit.
</P>
<P>
Western donor countries asked the Zimbabwean government to
reduce the deficit to sustainable levels of at least five percent
of gross domestic product (GDP), a demand Harare refused to
accept.
</P>
<P>
The minister said despite a six percent rise in revenue
generated in the nine months to March 1997 -- which went up to
1.62 billion U.S. Dollars against a budget estimate of 1.52
billion U.S. Dollars, the budget deficit will soar to 11.4
percent of GDP against the target of 8.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
This was mainly due to unbudgeted civil service wage
increments and bonuses awarded late last year which would require
an additional 364 million U.S. Dollars, he said.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Welcomes Suspension of Turkish Aircraft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus today expressed welcome to
the Turkish move to suspend its military aircraft overflying the
island country.
</P>
<P>
Manolis Christofides, government spokesman of Cyprus, told
reporters at his daily press briefing that the Cypriot government
welcomed the fact that Turkish military aircraft have not
violated Cyprus' air space in the past few weeks.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's move followed a Cypriot government unilateral
decision, announced last month, not to invite Greek military
aircraft to overfly Cyprus during the recent military maneuvers
for the sake of the on-going U.N.-led proximity talks between
the Greek and Turkish Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
The Greek Cypriot decision was welcomed by many foreign
governments, including Britain, the United States, China as well
as the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has also welcomed the information from Ankara that
Turkey has no plans to overfly Cyprus as long as Greek aircraft
do not overfly the island.
</P>
<P>
"If the Turkish government decides to follow the same tactic
as well, in a bid to display and create an atmosphere of
good-will, this is a matter that concerns that government," the
spokesman said, adding "we welcome this development."
</P>
<P>
He noted that "the Cyprus government considered it right to
establish this kind of climate during the talks and to make this
good-will gesture."
</P>
<P>
This is "a specific halt for a specific period," he said,
adding that "we are not talking about a halt of overflights in
general or a permanent halt."
</P>
<P>
Christofides said it was up to the government to decide
whether to extend this period.
</P>
<P>
Observers here consider these as good-will gestures from the
Greek and Turkish sides amid the recent improvement of the
relations between the two members of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey have been at odds over this east
Mediterranean strategic island, which has been divided since
Turkish invasion in 1974.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey, together with Britain, were guarantors of
Cyprus' independence under the 1960 Treaty on the establishment
of the Republic of Cyprus.

increasing signs of a thaw in the relations between the two arch
rivals in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
During their talks, Indian Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral
and his Pakistani counterpart, Nawaz Sharif, agreed to establish a
hotline between themselves and set up working groups on various
subjects.
</P>
<P>
They decided to continue the bilateral talks between their two
countries at the foreign secretary-level in Islamabad either by
the end of this month or in the middle of June.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed to release all the civilian prisoners detained
in each other's country and relax the restrictions on travel
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The prime ministers' talks covered the whole range of issues
between Pakistan and India, including the Kashmir issue, Pakistani
Foreign Secretary Shamshad Ahmed said.
</P>
<P>
Both sides said the talks were held in a "very constructive and
friendly atmosphere."
</P>
<P>
"The talks are very useful and constructive," Prime Minister
Sharif told reporters after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"We are personal friends. I like this man very much," said a
smiling Sharif, patting the shoulder of Gujral in front of the
reporters.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, held after the opening of the Ninth SAARC (South
Asian Association for Regional Cooperation) Summit in the Maldive
capital Male, was the first between the prime ministers of the two
countries since April 1993, when Sharif and the then Indian Prime
Minister Narasimha Rao met, also on the sidelines of a SAARC
summit, in Dhaka.
</P>
<P>
India and Pakistan have fought three wars since independence in
1947 and two of them were triggered by the Kashmir dispute, the
main obstacle to ending the long-time hostility between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Today's meeting followed two rounds of high-level talks between
the two South Asian neighbors, both of them SAARC members.
</P>
<P>
Their foreign secretaries held the first round of bilateral
talks in New Delhi, capital of India, in late March after a gap of
three years. The last round of talks bogged down in January 1994
due to their differences over the Kashmir issue.
</P>
<P>
Before being named prime minister, Gujral, who was then foreign
minister in Deve Gowda's government, held talks with his Pakistani
counterpart, Gohar Ayub Khan, in New Delhi on April 9.
</P>
<P>
"It's positive that they are meeting. They know each other,"
Ayub Khan said on Sunday. But he cautioned that "there is no quick
fix" as Kashmir remains the core issue between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
As a goodwill gesture, the two prime ministers have been
exchanging letters and had a five-minute telephone conversation
recently.
</P>
<P>
Sharif sent a congratulatory message to Gujral last month after
the latter won a vote of confidence in the parliament and said the
selection of Gujral as India's prime minister had boosted hopes
for peace between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Responding to his message, Gujral said he was confident the two
neighbors could reach agreement in many areas during bilateral
talks despite differences on some issues.
</P>
<P>
"With each of us showing a constructive and forward-looking
approach we are confident that our exchanges will be useful and
lead to mutually beneficial results," Gujral said. "I am
determined not to spare any effort in this endeavor."
</P>
<P>
Sharif said he "shared the commitment of his Indian
counterpart, Inder Kumar Gujral, to improving relations between
the two countries."

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Hopes for Settlement With Tribal Insurgents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dhaka, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The peace talks between the
Bangladeshi government and tribal insurgents from the southern
Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) proceeded satisfactorily on the
second day today.
</P>
<P>
Both sides were expecting to reach a settlement on the CHT
issue soon, President of the National Committee on CHT and Chief
Whip Abul Hasanat Abdulla told reporters here tonight.
</P>
<P>
However, he declined to give any details of the ongoing peace
talks, the fourth of such meeting since the present government
took power last June.
</P>
<P>
Shantu Larma, head of the Parbatya Chattagram Jana Sahhati
Samiti, the political wing of the armed tribal rebels, was also
present during the short briefing by the chief whip.
</P>
<P>
The talks have entered a crucial phase in the wake of the last
two rounds in the capital Dhaka, at which the negotiators failed
to agree on some vital issues like the expulsion of settlers,
withdrawal of the military from the CHT and land rights for the
tribal people, meeting sources said.
</P>
<P>
The independence-seeking tribal insurgents have been waging a
bloody bush war since the 1970s in the 14,200-square-kilometer
region rich in hydrocarbon deposits and teak and thousands of
people have been killed.
</P>
<P>
The two sides will continue their talks tomorrow morning, the
sources added.

<HEADLINE> Rape Cases Rise in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 12 (Xinhua) -- There has been a steady rise in the
number of reported rape cases in Zimbabwe with a total 3,012
cases being reported last year, Zimbabwean Deputy Police
Commissioner Godwin Matanga said here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing some 45 police officers from nine provinces
attending a Zimbabwean republic police training seminar, Matanga
said the most disturbing aspect is that about 52 percent of the
cases involved assaults on children below the age of 16 years.
</P>
<P>
He said, ''Viewed in the light of the raging AIDS pandemic, it
is shattering to imagine what devastation this is having on our
adults of tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
Accordling to Matanga, 2,315 rape cases were reported in
Zimbabwe in 1993, 2,610 in 1994 and 3,148 in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Forces, Lebanese Guerrillas Exchange Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Israeli warplanes launched three
consecutive raids at suspected guerrilla targets in south
Lebanon this afternoon, following an attack by Lebanese
guerrillas on an Israeli position inside an Israeli-occupied
border strip.
</P>
<P>
Security sources in the Israeli self-proclaimed "security
zone" said that one Israeli soldier and four members of the
Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army militia were injured in the
morning attack.
</P>
<P>
The state-run Lebanese National News Agency (LNNA) said that
Israeli warplanes carried out today's first air raid at Iglim
Al-Toffah at 2:20 p.m. (1120 GMT).
</P>
<P>
Iglim Al-Toffah, which means province of apple, some 60
kilometers southeast of Beirut, is a ridge often used by
guerrillas as a springboard to attack the buffer zone set up
by Israel in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The warplanes fired two air-to-surface missiles at a target
located between the villages of Jebal Sejoud and Mazra Aqmata,
the LNNA said, adding that black smoke was witnessed rising high
over the area.
</P>
<P>
Before the air raid, Israeli warplanes had flied
reconnaissance missions over Iglim Al-Toffah, and Israeli
artillery bombarded the vicinities of Sejoud, Rihan and Mazra
Aqmata.
</P>
<P>
Around 2:50 p.m., several Israeli helicopters launched a
second air raid, firing one missile at Sejoud and sweeping the
same target with machinegun fire.
</P>
<P>
Ten minutes later, the helicopters flied back to Iglim
Al-Toffah and fired another missile and opened machineguns at
Mazra Aqmata.
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate report of casualties in the air raids,
the LNNA said.
</P>
<P>
Guerrillas of the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God,
announced that they attacked this morning an outpost of the
Israeli occupation forces opposite Sejoud this morning, "killing
and wounding a number of Israeli soldiers."
</P>
<P>
Security sources in the border strip confirmed that one
Israeli soldier and four SLA militiamen were injured in the
guerrilla offensive.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Resistance, the military wing of Hezbollah, also
said that its militants bombarded the Israeli positions of Bir
Kalab and Kassara Aroush with mortar shells.
</P>
<P>
Hit-and-run attacks by guerrillas and retaliatory air raids
and bombardments by Israeli forces and their client militia
constitute a daily scene in south Lebanon, the last active
battlefront of the Arab-Israeli conflict.
</P>
<P>
Six Israeli soldiers have been killed and more than 35 others
wounded in fightings with Hezbollah guerrillas since this year.
</P>
<P>
The Jewish state established the 1,100-square-kilometer
"security zone" in 1985 ostensibly to protect northern Israel
from cross-border attacks.

<HEADLINE> Envoy: PNA Agrees to Hold Meeting With Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) has agreed to have an informal meeting with Israel soon,
U.S. Middle East Peace Envoy Dennis Ross said here today.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made after Ross met with PNA President Yasser
Arafat Sunday night, a local radio report said quoting the peace
coordinator.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is expected to lead to the resumption of the peace
talks, said Ross after meeting Jordanian Prime Minister
Abdul-Salam Majali and King Hussein here today.
</P>
<P>
The troubled peace process is still alive, said the special
envoy who is on his third shuttle diplomacy in the region within
two months.
</P>
<P>
The Mideast peace march has been in a new crisis since March
when Israel started the construction of a new Jewish neighborhood
at Har Homa on the outskirts of Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Ross briefed the Jordanian king and Majali on his efforts to
bring the stalled Israeli-Palestinian peace talks back on track,
and praised Jordan for its support for his mediation efforts, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
There is no question that Jordan is strongly committed to the
peace process and will support any effort to get the peace march
resumed, noted Ross.

<HEADLINE> PTA Bank Launches Marketing Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The Eastern and Southern African
Trade and Development Bank (PTA Bank) has embarked on an
aggressive marketing campaign to enhance the competitiveness of
exports among PTA member states.
</P>
<P>
The bank, which is the financial arm of the Common Market for
East and Southern Africa (COMESA ), said in its latest bulleting
that the strategy of the exercise hinged on raising cheaper funds
for exporters.
</P>
<P>
The bank had since structured and arraged a 50 million U.S.
Dollars facility from the U.S. to support exports in a member
country under this program.
</P>
<P>
The bulletin said trade finance is an area where the bank's
role is becoming more pronounced in the sub-region, and that this
had been a result of the small number of financial institutions
providing this service.
</P>
<P>
The PTA bank, which was established in 1985, provides various
types of trade financing to trading entities in member states
with priority being given to finance self-liquidating export
oriented transactions.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, President of the bank Martin Ogang is in Zimbabwe
to attend the institution's 13th annual general meeting which
began in Harare today.

<HEADLINE> UK Food Exports Grow 1 pct in 1996 despite Beef Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Britain's exports of food and drink
totaled 10.1 billion pounds (16.4 billion US dollars) in 1996,
one percent up on the previous year, despite the European Union's
worldwide ban on British beef since March 1996.
</P>
<P>
Figures released monday by Food from Britain, the export
marketing consultancy, showed that increases in sales of other
products more than offset the loss of an estimated 453 million
pounds (733.9 million US dollars) of beef sales.
</P>
<P>
Exports of breakfast cereals rose 31 percent to 253 million
pounds (409.9 million US dollars) last year, and 61 percent by
volume. Total cereal sales increased 20 percent to 1.6 billion
pounds (2.6 billion US dollars), making it the second largest
sector after drinks.
</P>
<P>
Of the 10.1 billion pounds of total export value, drinks
accounted for 3.17 billion pounds (5.1 billion US dollars), within
which, beer sales rose 38 percent to 242 million pounds (392
million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
France remained Britain's largest export market, buying 1.6
billion pounds (2.6 billion US dollars) UK food and drink.
Excluding meet, sales to France grew 15 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
Exports to Germany rose 11 percent to 748 million pounds (1.2
billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
It was reported that aside from last year, Britain's food and
drink exports have been growing at an annual rate of 8-9 percent,
and the country is now the world's sixth largest food and drink
exporter.

<HEADLINE> Envoy: Canada Wishes to Contribute Toward Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Canada is willing to contribute
all it can toward a solution to the protracted Cyprus problem, a
Canadian envoy said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after an hour-long meeting with Cypriot
Foreign Minister Ioannis Kasoulides, Michael Bell, Canadian
Foreign Minister's special representative on Cyprus, said he is
"cautiously encouraged" that a solution to the Cyprus problem can
be found.
</P>
<P>
Bell, who arrived here today on a fact-finding mission, was
appointed by Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy as a special
representative on Cyprus last month.
</P>
<P>
He said that the United Nations initiative on Cyprus is
the most important one and that Canada continues to back it
fully.
</P>
<P>
Bell said he will talk with U.N. Under-Secretary for
Political Affairs, Sir Kieran Prendergast, after the latter's
visit to Cyprus, which starts on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said Canada, as part of heightened international interest
shown over Cyprus in recent months, "wishes to see the Cyprus
problem resolved."
</P>
<P>
The Canadian envoy added it is too early to determine how much
his country can do to help solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
According to the Canadian envoy, he will be visiting
Athens, Ankara, Brussels, London, Bonn and The Hague after his
four-day visit to the island.
</P>
<P>
Bell's visit is part of intensified international peace
efforts aimed at seeking an early solution to the Cyprus
problem.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops
occupied the northern third of the island in the wake of a
short-lived coup seeking union with Greece.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Considers Current Peace Effort Most </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Finding a solution to the
protracted Cyprus problem is a top priority for the Cypriot
government, a government spokesman said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at his daily press briefing, Government Spokesman
Manolis Christofides said all Cypriot political leaders have
agreed that it would be "extremely difficult" to turn down an
invitation by the U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan for direct
negotiations to solve the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
"We would pay a hefty price if we reject the invitation by the
U.N. Chief," the Spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
It would be "frivolous" to say that differences between the
Greek and Turkish communities in the country cannot be overcome,
Christofides stressed, adding that the Greek Cypriot side will
continue with the U.N.-led proximity talks, aiming at achieving
progress.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman noted that none of the party leaders advising the
president on the Cyprus issue has rejected participation in the
proximity talks or in direct negotiations, if Annan extends an
invitation to President Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader
Rauf Denktash.
</P>
<P>
"The overall assessment among party leaders is that it may
be the most important recent U.N. initiative for a solution to
the Cyprus question," Christofides said, adding that every stage
of negotiations must be well prepared.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman made the statements two days before
U.N. Under-Secretary for Political Affairs Sir Kieran Prendergast
arrives in Cyprus for talks with Clerides and Denktash on Cyprus
issue.
</P>
<P>
Kieran is expected to prepare a report to the U.N. Chief
after his return to New York, later this month, from his
tour in the region, which will take him to Nicosia, Ankara
and Athens.
</P>
<P>
According to U.N. Resident Representative in Cyprus Gustave
Feissel, Annan will make a decision to call direct talks between
the Greek and Turkish communities in Cyprus soon after Kieran's
visit to the region.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus problem has remained unsolved since 1974 when
the island was divided after the Turkish troops took control
of its northern third in the wake of an Athens-backed coup.

<HEADLINE> Commonwealth Forestry Conference Opens in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The 15th Commonwealth Forestry
Conference opened today in Zimbabwe's northern resort town of
Victoria Falls.
</P>
<P>
The six-day conference, with its theme "forestry in a changing
political environment: challenges of the 21st century", will
discuss three sub-topics -- the interface between communities,
the state and the private sector, and the technological means of
ensuring sustainability for forestry.
</P>
<P>
Opening the conference, Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
said the demand for agricultural land, fuel wood, timber and
other non-timber products were resulting in the annual depletion
of 11 million hectares of tropical forests and woodlands in the
developing world.
</P>
<P>
"While population increase in developed countries has been
matched with economic growth, in developing countries it has been
matched with declining economic growth and worsening
environmental degradation," Mugabe told over 360 delegates from
37 Commonwealth countries.
</P>
<P>
"Consequently, deforestation has several negative environmental
impacts such as soil erosion, global warming, desertification and the
loss of biodiversity," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean president noted there is a need to put monetary
value to the destruction of forests, particularly in rural areas,
to make people appreciate the value of forests.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Confronts Iraq at APU Meetings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 12 (Xinhua) -- While Arab parliamentarians discussed
the issue of Arab solidarity here today, Kuwait and Iraq argued
over steps towards Arab reconciliation and Kuwaiti prisoners of
war (POWs).
</P>
<P>
At a political committee meeting of the Arab Parliamentary
Union today, Chairman of the Iraqi National Council Foreign
Relations Committee Saad Kassem Hamdawi called for the lifting of
the six-year-old U.N. economic embargo on his country.
</P>
<P>
"The sanctions have to be lifted so that Iraq may be able to
reassume its regional role and serve Arab interests," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Arab nation has long voiced support for Iraq's demand to
lift the embargo imposed for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait, but
little has been delivered yet on the ground.
</P>
<P>
But Kuwaiti representative Mubarak al Khertig urged for the
eradication of the causes of the collapse of Arab solidarity,
notably the 1990 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
"Reconciliation is to be preceded by openness and frank
discussions over who caused this collapse of Arab solidarity,"
said the Kuwaiti representative.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti POWs remain in Iraq and the Kuwaiti people can never
forget the pain the Iraqi invasion has left behind, he added.
</P>
<P>
There are 604 Kuwaiti and third country prisoners in Iraq,
according to files prepared by Kuwait. But Iraq denied it had
detained so many Kuwaiti prisoners in its jails.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi representative proposed, in response to the issue of
Kuwaiti POWs, that the APU General Secretariat and representatives
from the Kuwaiti parliament form an investigation panel to look
into this matter.
</P>
<P>
Several other Arab representatives, including the Egyptian
delegation, intervened to calm the situation.
</P>
<P>
The APU session, originally devoted to enhancing Arab
solidarity which were disrupted during the 1990 Gulf War, thus
turned into a war of words between the two bitter foes.

The convergence programs, which were deemed "well balanced
and realistic" by the finance ministers at the meeting, was aimed
to clear the way for the two countries' participation in the first
wave of countries joining EU's Economic and Monetary Union(EMU).
</P>
<P>
The plans anticipate annual GDP(Gross Domestic Product) growth
above three percent between 1998 and the year 2000, allowing for a
progressive reduction in the two countries' budget deficits to 2.5
percent in 1998 and two percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
For the year 2000, the Spanish convergence program
anticipates a deficit equivalent to 1.6 percent of GDP, while the
Portuguese deficit is put as low as 1.5 percent of GDP.
</P>
<P>
Government wishing to qualify for the euro must bring their
1997 budget deficits down to three percent of GDP. They must also
demonstrate that outstanding public debt is approaching 60 of GDP
at a satisfactory pace.
</P>
<P>
In a review of the fiscal situation across the 15-nation bloc,
the ministers have also given Finland and the Netherlands high
marks for their budget-slashing efforts.
</P>
<P>
Both countries have been taken off the list of governments with
so-called excessive deficits, joining Luxembourg, Ireland and
Denmark, the only countries currently in line with the Maastricht
Treaty's requirements for deficits and debt.
</P>
<P>
The finance ministers also got an update on proposals of the
European Commission, the EU's executive body, to harmonize EU
energy taxes with a view to extending taxation to all energy
products by 2002.
</P>
<P>
Monday's meeting has also provided the first opportunity for
British finance minister Gordon Brown to meet his EU counterparts
and make clear the new Labour government's position on a wide
range of issues.
</P>
<P>
Meeting EU monetary affairs commissioner Yves Thibault de
Silguy ahead of the ministerial gathering, Mr Brown said that he
would work constructively on EU's planned single currency.
</P>
<P>
In the margin of the minister's meeting, Mr Brown also met with
EU single market commissioner Mario Monti, informing the later his
government's intention to reduce VAT on domestic fuel and power
from eight percent to five percent.

<P>
The fence is 220 kilometers long and runs from the
northern Iraqi border town of Umm Qasr to Salmi in the

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The time was "ripe" for Athens and
Skopje to address the name of the Former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia (FYROM), Greek government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said
here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters today, Reppas said that some agreement
might be reached in the U.N.-sponsored talks in New york.
</P>
<P>
However, he warned that "any delaying tactics only harm the
other side."
</P>
<P>
He said that Greece was examining "everything" within the
framework of negotiation under the U.N. auspices on the name of
the FYROM, including the possibility of a composite name.
</P>
<P>
By composite name, Reppas was referring to the possibility of a
name containing the word 'Macedonia' or some derivative.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman reaffirmed that there was on way that a state
could exist in the region with just the name of "Macedonia".
</P>
<P>
Relations between Greece and FYROM have been strained since the
latter declared its independence in 1991, with Athens objecting to
its neighbor's use of the term of "Macedonia" in any form, saying
that this implied claims to the northern Greek province of the
same name.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the two countries are meeting in New York in order
to solve the name issue, and negotiations are reportedly in
progress.

<HEADLINE> Liberian Parties Suggest Postponement of Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Eleven of Liberia's 16 political
parties have called for the postponement of the general elections
set for coming May 30 under the revised Abuja Peace Accord.
</P>
<P>
A report reaching here today from Liberia's capital Monrovia
said the parities issued a statement saying the postponement will
provide an opportunity to address certain issues critical to the
success of the elections.
</P>
<P>
The issues include insecurity, harassment, intimidation and
misinformation, which are prevailing mostly in the rural areas,
and the inability of west Africa's peacekeeping force to deploy
troops to some parts of the country, which raises questions about
security in such areas.
</P>
<P>
The statement also expressed concern about the presence of
"huge cashes of arms and ammunition still hidden that are
periodically being discovered."
</P>
<P>
The parties argued that the postponement will provide more
time for the return of about one million Liberians who fled the
country during seven years of civil war.
</P>
<P>
They also noted the absence of rules and guidelines for the
political parties and the public, the need for voter education
and the alleged domination of the government by factional
appointees.
</P>
<P>
"This condition works negatively against parties with no
representatives in the government, especially when some of the
former factional leaders are contestants in the elections," said
the statement.
</P>
<P>
For example, the media are dominated by former factional
leaders who are "illegally using the country's resources to
advance their personal well-being and electoral prospects," they
said.
</P>
<P>
The parties, therefore, advocated fixing a new date, not
before October 13, for the elections.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Nigerian Foreign Minister Tom Ikimi said the May 30
date is "feasible", based on the assurances by the peacekeeping
force about the security situation in Liberia.
</P>
<P>
Ikimi has been engaged in consulations within the 16 member
countries of the Economic Community of West African States
(ECOWAS), which is behind the peacekeeping force in Liberia known
as ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria has been playing a major role in the peacekeeping
mission in Liberia.

<P>
CAIRO, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Leading Arab lawmakers today shared
views on enhancing Arab solidarity through establishing a common
Arab market at the ongoing sessions of the Arab Parliamentary
Union (APU) Council.
</P>
<P>
The committee discussed eight working papers presented by
Egypt, Tunisia, Morocco, Iraq, Sudan, Palestine and Lebanon in
addition to the Arab Economic Unity Council.
</P>
<P>
The working papers agreed on four key targets for the common
market, namely free personal and capital flow, freedom of
residence, work and economic activity, freedom of commodity
exchange and of transit trade.
</P>
<P>
A number of delegations talk the Arab market in the context of
the Arab solidarity, which has been much eroded since the 1990
Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
To stand up to the mounting challenges for the developing
countries, the Egyptian delegation said, requires a more solid and
stronger Arab solidarity and the establishment of an Arab common
market and a pan-Arab Parliament.
</P>
<P>
Warning that the Arab world is facing a ferocious Israeli
assault, Lebanese lawmakers said the establishment of an Arab
common market provides a basic means of Arab solidarity and a
challenge to the Mideast market they seek.
</P>
<P>
This opinion was echoed by Jordan, which stressed that
solidarity should begin with economic solidarity and a common Arab
market.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 12 (Xinhua) -- A senior Pentagon official said
here today that he saw no new risk of accidental or unauthorized
launch of Russian nuclear missiles against the United States.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters on condition of anonymity, the official
said that there is no reason "to believe that there is a
heightened risk of unauthorized or accidental launch of Russian
nuclear missiles."
</P>
<P>
The official made the remarks in response to a report on Monday
in advance of Tuesday's start of two days of Washington talks
between Russian Defense Minister Igor Rodionov and top U.S.
officials on bilateral military ties and security in Europe and
the western Pacific.
</P>
<P>
"I can tell you that I have seen nothing that indicates that
any sort of an incident occurred," the official said.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, The Washington Times said that a classified CIA
report indicated recent malfunctions of equipment controlling
Moscow's vast nuclear arsenal had spontaneously switched missiles
to "combat mode" on several occasions, increasing the risk of
unauthorized launch.
</P>
<P>
Rodionov will hold separate talks on Tuesday with Defense
Secretary William Cohen and White House National Security Adviser
Samuel (Sandy) Berger, and meets on Wednesday with Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright before departing for Hawaii and Japan.
</P>
<P>
The talks will focus on increased U.S.-Russian military
cooperation, but also include NATO enlargement, European security
and the situation in the Pacific rim, the Pentagon official said.
</P>
<P>
The trip will be Rodionov's first to the U.S. as defense minister
and he would meet Cohen for the first time.

<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, May 12 (Xinhua) -- China and Nigeria issued here today
a joint press communique on Chinese Premier Li Peng's successful
visit to Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The press communique said that during the visit, Li Peng and
Nigerian Head of State Sani Abacha exchanged views on bialteral
ties and other issues of mutual concern.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders held talks in a friendly atmosphere of mutual
respect, which mirrored the good relations between the
governments and peoples of the two countries, said the
communique, adding that four documents of economic and trade
cooperation were signed between the two countries before the end
of Li's visit.
</P>
<P>
The communique said the two sides agreed that their two
countries have common interests in international affairs and they
are complementary to each other economically.
</P>
<P>
The two sides stressed that further strengthening
cooperation between China and Nigeria in various
areas conforms to the interests of the two countries, and they
shared the view that it is necessary to hold regular meetings of
the China-Nigeria Mixed Economic Committee, said the communique.
</P>
<P>
The press communique said the leaders of the two countries
expressed their concern for the lack of security and instability
caused by civil wars and conflicts in the world and in Africa in
particular.

<HEADLINE> Turkey: No Withdrawal of Troops From Northern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 12 (Xinhua) -- A Turkish general has ruled out the
possibility of replacing the Turkish troops in northern Cyprus
with an international peacekeeping force, the semi-official
Anatolia News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
During a visit to northern Cyprus last weekend, Cevik Bir,
deputy Chief of Staff of the Turkish Armed Force, said that
Turkish troops were stationed there to safeguard peace and
stability.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that Turkey always supported a peaceful solution in
Cyprus, he said, "Greek and Turkish Cypriots should come together
and find a lasting solution, this should be the main goal."
</P>
<P>
The Turkish deputy chief was in northern Cyprus to meet Turkish
Cypriot leaders and to inspect the 30,000-strong Turkish troops
stationed on the divided island.
</P>
<P>
Bir said Turkey would continue its support to northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Turkey supported the U.N. Secretary General's efforts carried
out in this respect, but the Turkish government's guarantee for
northern Cyprus should be respected, he said.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus was split into two parts since 1974 when the Turkish
troops landed on the island to protect Turkish Cypriots following
an abortive coup by Greek Cypriots seeking union with Greece. A
self-claimed Turkish Cypriot republic was then founded in northern
Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
At present, the Greek Cypriots-dominated government is the
sole legal government of Cyprus while the Turkey-backed republic
is not recognized by the international community.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish military leader also criticized the defense
cooperation between Greece and Cyprus, saying they were join hands
in "spoiling existing tranquility and stability on the island."
</P>
<P>
Speaking of Cyprus' anti-aircraft missile deal with Russian
early this year, Bir emphasized that this was not only a problem
of northern Cyprus and Turkey, but also a problem of the
international community.
</P>
<P>
Turkey had vowed to launch a military strike against Cypriot
targets following the announcement of the S-300 Russian missile
deal.

WASHINGTON, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Officials in the U.S. embassy in
Tel Aviv were under Israeli intelligence agents' surveillance last
year, according to the latest edition of Time magazine published
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The weekly magazine quoted U.S. senior intelligence officials
as saying that U.S. Ambassador to Israel Martin Indyk complained
privately that Israeli agents took "heavy-handed" measures for the
surveillance over U.S. officials in that country, including
following U.S. embassy employees in Tel Aviv and searching the
hotel rooms of visiting U.S. officials.
</P>
<P>
The reports came amid an FBI investigation into whether a
senior U.S. government official had been providing sensitive
information to Israel.
</P>
<P>
Last week, The Washington Post reported that the probe was
launched in January after the National Security Agency intercepted
a secure communication between two members of the Mossad, Israel's
intelligence serve. In the communication, a Mossad officer in
Washington and a superior in Tel Aviv discussed to use a source
code-named "Mega" to obtain sensitive information from the U.S.
government.
</P>
<P>
The FBI believed that Mega they mentioned in their conversation
could be a U.S. government officials that has provided Israel
information in the past.
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno confirmed that
the United States was investigating a possible leak of information
through the so-called "mega" to the Israeli intelligence service
Mossad.
</P>
<P>
Israel has denied to have been using a highly-placed U.S.
government source for confidential information.

<HEADLINE> French Chemical Group Seeks to Conquer Asia-Pacific Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The French chemical group
Rhone-Poulenc is seeking to conquer the Asian market with its
chemical, pharmaceutical, life science and fiber and polymer
products, said Jean-Marc Bruel, vice-chairman of the group, today.
</P>
<P>
He said that over the past 10 years, the Asia-Pacific region
has become the fourth largest market after Europe, North America,
and France itself, for the group's products, two thirds of which
are life science products, such as animal and plant health
promoters.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Asia-Pacific region took up 10 percent of the
global sale volume of Rhone-Poulenc group, which is the world's
seventh largest pharmaceutical and life science products group,
and its sale volume in the region increased by 20 percent from
1995 to 1996 to attain 1.6 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Rhone-Poulenc is now employing 8,700 people in the 43
production centers it is running in 19 Asia-Pacific countries and
territories, while its investment now amounts to 800 million U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Pierre Laguere, group senior vice president for international
affairs, said that since sustainable growth is an increasing
challenge to development today, Rhone-Poulenc is ready to help
Asia-Pacific countries protect their environment by providing
highly efficient insecticides, new catalysts for vehicles and
treatment of industrial wastes.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that by the year 2,000, around 1 billion
inhabitants in Asia-Pacific will be potential customers for
Rhone-Poulenc's products, as 90 percent of the group's products
have met the need of the region by now.
</P>
<P>
Rhone-Poulenc sold 220 million U.S. dollars of products in 1996
to China, a 75 percent increase over 1994, and it is running 12
industrial plants and having 15 business partners now in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The group estimates that China will develop into a regional
industrial base for Rhone-Poulenc and that half of its Chinese
sales will come from local production by 1999.
</P>
<P>
The group is opening a new multi-sector production center in
Pudong, Shanghai, which will focus on the production of specialty
chemicals and silicone products, and will be in charge of
distribution of the products across China.

<HEADLINE> US to Provide Aid to Iranian Victims of Earthquake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The United States will provide
about 100,000 dollars in aid for the relief of victims of the
devastating earthquake that struck Iran during the weekend, the
State Department said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, State Department spokesman Nicholas
Burns said that Secretary of State Madeleine Albright "has decided
that the United States will extend roughly 100,000 dollars in
emergency humanitarian assistance."
</P>
<P>
He noted that Iran and the United States have had disputes
with each other for many years, "but we don't have any arguments
with the people of Iran. The people of Iran obviously are in
need of support."
</P>
<P>
The United States is trying hard to organize an international
economic boycott of Iran aimed at strangling its development which
it hopes would lead to collapse of the Islamic government.
</P>
<P>
But critics of the U.S. policy would prefer a more flexible
approach. They would permit some business deals and try to
influence Iran to moderate its views. However, Republican Senator
Sam Brownback, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Near East
Subcommittee, is calling for a tougher policy toward Tehran.

<HEADLINE> Thames Offers Free Leak Repair for Customers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, MAY 12 (Xinhua) -- Britain's biggest water company is
offering a free leak repair service for its 7 million customers,
according to BBC TV's Panorama tonight.
</P>
<P>
Thames Water has pledged to repair damaged underground pipes
between the garden fence and front door at no charge.
</P>
<P>
The company, which has the worst seepage rate in the country,
agreed to provide the free service after being confronted with an
internal memo in which its engineers claimed such a move "was not
an option."
</P>
<P>
The document revealed that fixing every household leak would
save 7 million gallons a day and cost the multimillion-pound
company only 4.5 million pounds (7.2 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Thames, which is expected to make 368 million pounds (588.8
million US dollars) in pre-tax profits this year, loses nearly 40
percent of its supply in leaks, according to official figures.
</P>
<P>
Between 4 and 10 percent of the wastage occurs on the
customer's side of the stopcock.
</P>
<P>
The Thames offer will last until at least the autumn. Ian
Byatt, director general of the industry watchdog Ofwat, said some
companies were in danger of "cutting corners" in an attempt to
save costs.
</P>
<P>
Ofwat officials and many industry experts believe water
companies concentrate too much on building new reservoirs instead
of carrying out repairs on the existing infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
New Environment Minister Michael Meacher is expected to call
for free household leak repairs across the country and speedier
repairs to mains pipes.

<HEADLINE> Jordan to Help UNRWA Procure Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Jordan today promised to campaign for
funds for Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with visiting United Nations Relief and Works
Agency (UNRWA) Commissioner-General Peter Hansen here, Prime
Minister Abdul Salkam Majali said his country will ask donor
countries to increase their financial assistance to the
organization.
</P>
<P>
Details of Jordan's support have not been disclosed yet.
</P>
<P>
In January, Hansen paid an official visit to Jordan, where
two-thirds of its population are Palestinians and some other
Palestinians are refugees.
</P>
<P>
The commissioner-general's January trip was also centered on
asking for financial aid for UNRWA, which was established in 1949
to deal specifically with the Palestinian refugee issues in
Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, the West Bank and Gaza.
</P>
<P>
"The international community is faithful to UNRWA, but we are
not seeing enough increase of income because the Palestinian
refugee population is increasing and the cost of maintaining the
programs are increasing too. So we need a faster growth in our
income to finance programs," said Hansen during his last trip to
Amman.
</P>
<P>
Some 1 million Palestinians were made homeless during the First
Middles East War in 1948 when Israel annered part of the
Palestinian land. They are now in refugee camps in Jordan, Syria,
Lebanon and the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. then set up the UNRWA, a sister agency to the United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), to deal with the
Palestinian refugee issue.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 13 (Xinhua) -- China and the United States will
step up contacts and dialogue between their armed forces as part
of the efforts to improve bilateral relations, senior Chinese and
US military officers said here today.
</P>
<P>
During the highest level military talks between the two
countries in over a decade this morning, the Chinese side
expressed the will to carry out contacts and dialogue between the
armed forces of the two countries in a well-planned and scheduled
way.
</P>
<P>
The contacts and dialogue should be conducted on the basis of
mutual benefit and mutual respect, Chief of General Staff of the
Chinese People's Liberation Army Fu Quanyou told John
Shalikashvili, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the United
States, during the talks in the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse.
</P>
<P>
Shalikashvili is the highest ranking US military officer who
has ever visited China since 1985. He arrived in Beijing on May 12
for an official good-will visit as Fu's guest.
</P>
<P>
During the friendly and frank talks, the two sides exchanged
views on the issues of the security situation of the Asia-Pacific
region, the defense, and foreign policies of their own countries
and bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Fu said that links between the two armed forces compose a
crucial component of the relationship between the two
countries. He also reviewed the improvement of the relations
between the two armed forces since Chi Haotian, vice-chairman of
China's Central Military Commission and minister of national
defense, visited the US last year.
</P>
<P>
The two sides discussed the arrangement of contacts between the
armed forces in the short term. They agreed to keep contact and
dialogue on the issues of US military vessels' berthing at Hong
Kong after July 1, 1997 and the avoidance of maritime accidents.
</P>
<P>
On the regional security situation, Fu pointed out that the
Asia-Pacific region enjoys relatively stable political situation
and sustained economic development. However, there are still some
factors of instability, he said.
</P>
<P>

<P>
Fu pointed out that China and the US are two important big
powers in the world. The Sino-US relations are one of the most
crucial bilateral relations in the world, he said.
</P>
<P>
Fu said that China places great importance on its relations
with the US and has made unremitting efforts to promote the links.
</P>
<P>
Fu stressed that the Taiwan issue is the kernel question of the
bilateral relations. The Chinese side expects that the US side
will handle this issue in a proper way and strictly abide by the
three joint communiques signed by the two governments.
</P>
<P>
Fu said that the two countries are facing a good opportunity to
further improve and promote bilateral relations at present. He
said that the two sides should seize this opportunity.
</P>
<P>
In line with the principle of "enhancing trust, reducing
troubles, promoting cooperation, and avoiding confrontation" that
Chinese President Jiang Zemin put forward, Fu said, the two sides
should always take into consideration the common interest of the
two countries, stand at a greater height, be more far-sighted,
strictly abide by the principles of the three joint communiques,
and properly deal with some sensitive issues between them, so as
to further improve and develop the Sino-US relations.

China since he last visit the country over a decade ago. He said
that the US has significant political and economic interest in the
Asia-Pacific region, so that it wishes that the region will
maintain stability and development. He said that the US does not
want to contain anyone, especially not China. The US places great
importance on the development of relations with China, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the US upholds the "one China" policy, abides by
the three joint communiques signed by the two governments and will
not have any official links with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Shalikashvili expressed gladness over the recent contacts
between the armed forces of the two countries. He wishes that the
two armed forces will maintain contacts and further develop their
links.

consumes an estimated 80 percent of Egypt's 100 million
U.S. dollars a year software market.
</P>
<P>
"Our institution is getting worse, and nobody is taking any
action," Sherin el-Rayes, chairman of BSA Egypt, was quoted by the
English magazine as saying.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Minister of Supply and Trade Ahmed el-Goweili, who is
responsible for IPR protection in the country, had agreed to
resume the raids on software pirates, which he canceled under
pressure from businesses last summer.
</P>
<P>
But the raids have yet to resume, said el-Rayes, adding that
the BSA will wait until June before calling the latest government
initiative a failure.
</P>
<P>
Software industry executives say Egypt's industry will remain
underdeveloped until copyrights are protected, said the magazine.

<HEADLINE> Draft Russia-Belarus Charter Almost Ready </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The draft charter on integration due
to be signed by Russia and Belarus next week has been basically
agreed by both sides, although differences still remain, Russian
President Boris Yeltsin's press secretary said today.
</P>
<P>
Sergei Yastrzhembsky said two problems remained, although none
was of "any fundamental importance," and President Yeltsin had
sent a message to Belarussian President Alexander Lukashenko that
he was satisfied with the work done to finalize the charter.
</P>
<P>
If negotiators failed to iron out these differences over the
next few days, the two presidents would try to find a common
approach to the problems during their meeting on May 23, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Russia-Belarus Charter is part of the Union Treaty signed
between the two countries on April 2 this year aimed at closer
integration.
</P>
<P>
The treaty provided for the setting up of supra-national bodies
and a timetable for the creation of a common market and monetary
union and joint transport and energy systems.
</P>
<P>
Details of proposals for the union were contained in the
separate charter which was put out for public debate. The deadline
for accepting proposals for consideration in the charter was May
10 and the final version is expected to be presented to the
presidents of both countries by May 15. They are due to meet to
sign the charter on May 23.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Defense Minister Meets Shalikashvili </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 13 (Xinhua) -- A healthy, stable Sino-US
relationship is not only in the interests of the peoples of both
countries, but also beneficial for peace and stability in the
Asia-Pacific region and the world as a whole, Chinese Defence
Minister Chi Haotian told John Shalikashvili, chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff of the United States, here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Chi, who is also a vice-chairman of China's Central Military
Commission and a state councilor, met today with Shalikashvili,
the highest-ranking US military officer to visit China in more
than a decade.
</P>
<P>
During their meeting in the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse, Chi
reviewed the progress of contacts between the armed forces of the
two countries in recent years.
</P>
<P>
He said that China is the largest developing country, while the
US is the largest developed country in the world. Taking a healthy
and stable Sino-US relationship into the 21st century is not only
in the interests of the peoples of the two countries, but also
beneficial to maintaining peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific
region and the world as a whole.
</P>
<P>
He said he believed that Shalikashvili's current visit to China
would further promote understanding and trust between the two
armed forces.
</P>
<P>
He also briefed Shalikashvili and his entourage on China's
reform and opening up and its defence-oriented military policy.
</P>
<P>
He said that since the passing away of Comrade Deng Xiaoping, a
great Chinese leader, the Chinese people have been united solidly
around the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China with
Jiang Zemin at the core. China will staunchly march along the road
of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, which Deng
Xiaoping initiated.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that China places great importance on the
development of relations with the US. He said that the two sides
should stick to the principles of "enhancing trust, reducing
troubles, promoting cooperation and avoiding confrontation" that
Chinese President Jiang Zemin has put forward.
</P>
<P>
They should strictly abide by the principles set out in the
three joint communiques signed by the two governments, proceed
from the common interests of the two countries and face the 21st
century so as to put Sino-US relations on a track of healthy and
stable development, Chi added.
</P>
<P>
Shalikashvili conveyed the greetings of US Secretary of Defence
William Cohen and former Secretary of Defence William Perry to
Chi. He also recalled the pleasant experience of Chi's visit to
the US last year.
</P>
<P>
He said that for a person who has not visited China for the
past decade, the changes in the country are "remarkable."
</P>
<P>
He said that the US is ready to push forward the contacts and
dialogue between the armed forces of the two countries, so as to
further improve and promote bilateral relations.

<HEADLINE> Sweden Still Uneligible for Emu Membership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, May 13 (Xinhua)-- Finance ministers of the European
Union have urged Sweden to cut its budget deficit to qualify for
membership of the single European currency in 1999.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting in Brussels yesterday, the ministers called on Sweden
and nine other EU countries to improve their finances to qualify
for EMU.
</P>
<P>
Only Luxembourg, Ireland, Denmark, Finland and the Netherlands
meet the requirements laid down in the EU's Maastricht Treaty on
monetary union.
</P>
<P>
Sweden is still on the list of countries whose present budget
deficits exceed 3 percent of GDP and is thus not eligible for
membership of the single European currency.
</P>
<P>
The government has signalled its intention to bring its budget
deficit down to 2.2 percent of GDP this year. But the EU has urged
Sweden to cut public spending further and eliminate its deficit by
1998. It has also called on the government to lower taxes for
households and companies to stimulate the economy and create
jobs.

<HEADLINE> China Commends Outstanding Disabled Persons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government held a
meeting at the Great Hall of the People here today to commend
outstanding disabled persons and people who have helped the
disabled.
</P>
<P>
A preface written by president Jiang Zemin to a book titled
"Song of Self-Supporting" was read at the meeting. In it, Jiang
says that China has 60 million disabled people and they have
relations with one-fifth of all Chinese families. The country must
handle this social issue properly and must on no account dodge the
problem, he stresses.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Central
Committee, adds that the issue is also related to the full
realization of human rights and the liberation of productivity.
</P>
<P>
According to the leader, humanitarianism is the yardstick for
dealing with the relations between people. The Communist Party
should respect human rights and the personal dignity of the
disabled even more, because the Party's goal is to liberate
humanity and in a socialist country everybody should be prosperous
and happy.
</P>
<P>
Deng Pufang, chairman of the China Disabled Persons'
Federation, delivered a report on a nationwide campaign to help
the disabled.
</P>
<P>
He said that since the country held the first meeting to
commend outstanding disabled people six years ago, a lot of model
workers have appeared in various walks of lifes.
</P>
<P>
He said that Jiang Zemin's preface elaborates the significance
of the work to help the disabled in an all-round and profound way
with a Maxist perspective. It has also laid a theoretical
foundation for the improvement of this work with Chinese
characteristics.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting 120 outstanding disabled persons, 85 units
and 81 persons engaged in helping the disabled, 79 "disabled
families" and 32 workers in the field were cited.
</P>
<P>
Ding Guan'gen and several other senior Chinese officials also
attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Liu Yunshan, deputy head of the Propaganda Department of the
CPC Central Committee, asked the public to continue to help the
disabled and learn from the disabled people's spirit of
self-reliance, and set a correct world view and life value
system.
</P>
<P>
Some outstanding disabled persons reported on their experiences in
overcoming difficulties.
</P>
<P>
State Councillor Peng Peiyun extended greetings to 60 million
disabled people and their families. She urged governments at
all levels to follow Jiang Zemin's call to further lend a hand
to the disabled.

BEIJING, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The Microsoft Corporation of the
United States will have its products licensed to more Chinese
personal computer manufacturers, distributors, and system
builders, who package the products to be sold with personal

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization (WHO)
warned today that untried, ineffective or fake medicine could be sold
through the Internet because of a lack of control of advertising and
sales in electronic communications.
</P>
<P>
A resolution expressing concern over the issue and calling for
the careful evaluation of the effectiveness, safety and quality of
medical products, was adopted at the 50th World Health Assembly
being held here from May 5-14.
</P>
<P>
It said advertising, promotion and sales through the Internet
might result in uncontrolled across-the-border trade of medical
products or fraudulent imitations that may be unevaluated,
unapproved, unsafe or ineffective, or inappropriately used.
</P>
<P>
In most of the WHO's 191 members, medical products
require authorization prior to marketing, and are available only
on medical prescription.
</P>
<P>
The resolution called on the WHO's director-general to
collaborate with drug regulatory authorities and the medical
industry worldwide to see that medical products are adequately
evaluated before being marketed.
</P>
<P>
An ad hoc group under the WHO Drug Management and Policy
division will hold its first meeting next September to discuss the
sale of medical products on the Internet.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Asks Nation to Learn from Disabled (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin has
called on the nation to learn from the disabled persons' spirit of
self-supporting and working hard.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, also general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party
Central Committee, was speaking at a national meeting at the Great
Hall of the People here today to commend outstanding disabled
people.
</P>
<P>
The handicapped people constantly strive to become stronger as
well as to unite and help each other, the Chinese leader pointed
out.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Deng Pufang, chairman of the China Disabled
Persons' Federation, delivered a report on how the disabled
learn to become self-reliant and work to help each other.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Zemin and other Chinese leaders, including Qiao Shi, Li
Ruihuan, Zhu Rongji, Liu Huaqing and Hu Jintao, met and talked
with representatives of the outstanding disabled persons and
of those who have done much to help the disabled.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that the disabled display the spirit of
self-respect, self-confidence and self-supporting that the
Chinese nation has developed for thousands of years.
</P>
<P>
This kind of spirit has enabled the nation to make indelible
contributions to the human civilization, he said.
</P>
<P>
"To meet the challenge of the 21st century, to build the
motherland into a prosperous, democratic, civilized and modern
socialist country, the national spirit of striving to become
stronger must be constantly carried forward with great efforts," he
emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that the unusual contributions made by the disabled
are closely related to the nationwide campaign of helping them.
</P>
<P>
The campaign has embodied the Chinese nation's traditional
ethics of taking it as a pleasure to help others, and it should
be promoted by the society as a whole, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Ours is a socialist country. So, we must encourage the people
to understand, respect and care for each other by promoting
collectivism, thus creating an equal and fraternal social
environment marked by mutual help," he said.

<P>
Jiang asked the general public to respect and help the
disabled.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Chinese Communist Party's ultimate purpose is
to liberate humanity. Since the founding of New China in
1949 the fundamental political and economic conditions for the
protection of human rights have been attained.
</P>
<P>
The people's rights to subsistence and development have been
protected more and more effectively, he said, and remarkable
achievements have been made in helping and protecting the disabled.
</P>
<P>
The fact that millions of disabled persons have been
participating in social activities and national construction
proves the guarantee of universal, fair and real protection
of human rights in China, he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that China has 60 million disabled people, and they
are related to one fifth of all Chinese families. Therefore, the
protection of the disabled is related to the people's immediate
interests, to the emancipation and development of productive forces,
and to social stability and unity.
</P>
<P>
So it is the duty of the Party and the government to do a good
job in this regard, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Party and the government have done a great
deal of work to protect the disabled. However, because the
country's overall economic and social development is at a low
stage, "we have encountered a lot of difficulties. It is a
long-term and arduous task to help the disabled," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He cited Beethoven as an example of a man who encouraged people
to challenge fate. Even after he became deaf, Beethoven composed
some of his best works.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that in Beethoven's time people could only combat
the fate in isolation. But in today's China the disabled can count
on receiving care from the Party, the government and the whole of
society.
</P>
<P>
So, they can compose even greater masterpieces, he
concluded.

OTTAWA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- New motor vehicle sales in Canada rose
8.5 percent between February and March to reach 121,715,
Statistics Canada said today.
</P>
<P>
The increase was driven by a 12.3 percent passenger car sales
gain, which is the largest since March 1993.
</P>
<P>
Truck sales continued to rise, up 4.1 percent in March over
February, setting a record number of saled vehicles in a one-month
period at 54,795.
</P>
<P>
"Industry sources have suggested that the high sales pace of new
motor vehicles will continue in April 1997," the Federal Agency noted.
</P>
<P>
Between March 1996 and March 1997, new motor vehicle sales
increased 17.0 percent.
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter, Canadians bought a total of 339,894 vehicles,
which is almost five percent higher than the previous quarter, and the
highest first quarter sales since 1990.
</P>
<P>
"The largest contributors to the first quarter advance were the Big
Three automakers with sales gains of just under nine percent," the
agency said.

<HEADLINE> Wine Imports Skyrocket in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai Customs Office
reported a steep rise in the imports of wine in the first four
months of this year, with the amount topping 1.06 million liters,
valued at 1.22 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The amount of imported wine in the first four months of
Last year was merely 21,400 liters.
</P>
<P>
Local market investigators attributed the phenomenon to the
change in consumers' attitude toward the mild alcoholic drink and
the failure of local suppliers to meet the soaring demand,
especially for red wine.
</P>
<P>
Currently, China has over 110 wineries, including eight
Sino-foreign joint ventures. In 1994 the country turned out
184,000 tons and in 1996 the output stood at some 300,000 tons,
according to official figures.
</P>
<P>
However, the experts said, there is a big gap yet to be
filled between the demand and the supply in China, as the
country's per-capita wine consumption is only 0.3 liter, compared
with than the world's average of six liters and far less than the
figure of 110 liters in developed countries.

<HEADLINE> Establishment of Rural Co-op Banks Urged in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government has been
urged to consider the establishment of rural cooperative banks
that will be owned by the local people.
</P>
<P>
The suggestion has been made in Chipata, capital of East
province by Norman Chipakupaku, Executive Secretary of the
Chipata Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Zambia News Agency
(ZANA) reported today.
</P>
<P>
ZANA quoted Chipakupaku as saying that the government should
restructure the Cooperative Bank so that small and medium-sized
entreprenuers who had not access to its loan schemes could benefit
from the establishment of rural cooperative banks.
</P>
<P>
Chipakupaku said the rural banks would determine their interest

<HEADLINE> Li Ruihuan Meets Hong Kong Delegation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Li Ruihuan, a standing committee
member of the Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party
Central Committee, said here today: "All work we do should be
viewed from the angle of Hong Kong's smooth transition and
long-term stability and prosperity."
</P>
<P>
Li, also chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), made the
remark at a meeting with a delegation from the Hong Kong-based
Guangdong Societies' Committee to greet Hong Kong's return to the
motherland.
</P>
<P>
The delegation is led by Henry Fok Ying-tung, chairman of the
committee and vice-chairman of the CPPCC National Committee.
</P>
<P>
Li said Hong Kong's return to the motherland is a major
historical event, occupying an important place in the hearts of
the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
It is well known to all that, starting from the launching of
the Opium War in 1840 by Britain, which forced the government of
the Qing Dynasty to sign the Treaty of Nanjing and allow the
British to occupy Hong Kong, China was gradually turned into a
semi-feudal and semi-colonial society.
</P>
<P>
From that time on, Li said, countless noble-minded patriots
waged heroic anti-imperialist struggles for national
liberation. Hong Kong's return to the motherland is a historic
event, which indicates the wiping out of shame for the Chinese
nation and indicates the country's growing strength.
</P>
<P>
All sons and daughters of the Chinese nation are encouraged by
this event, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that there are only 49 days left before Hong Kong
returns to the motherland. The key to maintaining Hong Kong's
smooth transfer of power and its long-term stability and
prosperity is the ability of Hong Kong compatriots to unite,
organize together and earnestly carry out the Basic Law and
consciously proceed from Hong Kong's stability and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Li expressed the belief that the Hong Kong compatriots who have
mastered their destiny are certain to govern Hong Kong well and
create new miracles on their own land.
</P>
<P>
He said all the visitors present have done much for the
mainland's reform and opening to the outside world. They have
invested in running schools, offering assistance to those who met
with difficulties, erecting bridges and repairing highways and
importing advanced technology to the mainland.
</P>
<P>
As a result, they have won trust from the people, enjoying high
reputations both in Hong Kong and the mainland.
</P>
<P>
Li said it is his hope that they will value their achievements
which were made not easily and will, as always, make contributions
to the country's construction and their hometowns' prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Fok said that for many years the Hong Kong-based Guangdong
societies have tried their best to provide assistance to their
hometowns and the country as a whole whenever they had
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
As Chinese people, he said, they have the responsibility to
build the country well. The Hong Kong-based Guangdong Societies'
Committee, which is a newly established organization, also has the
obligation to hold celebrations well for Hong Kong's return and
help the government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
safeguard its stability and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zhaoguo, vice-chairman of the CPPCC National Committee and
head of the United Front Work Department of the Chinese Communist
Party Central Committee, attended the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Zambia for Effective Public Assistance Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, MAY 13 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government is concerned
about the effectiveness of the public welfare assistance program and
has taken measures to reform it.
</P>
<P>
This was said by Community Development and Social Service Minister
Newstead Zimba while opening a public welfare assistance scheme
dissemination workshop here today.
</P>
<P>
Zimba admitted that the scheme, which was meant to cushion the
poor from the effects of the Structural Adjustment Program, has
not done as expected despite an injection of four billion Kwacha
(1,300 Kwacha equal one US dollar) since 1992.
</P>
<P>
He said that it was for that reason his ministry last year
undertook a detailed evaluation of the program and used the
results as the basis for initiating a nation-wide consultative
process at community, district and national levels to solicit
views on how the scheme could be reformed.
</P>
<P>
After a careful study, the ministry has found that the scheme
needed to be community-based for it to be effective and avoid being
highjacked by the "smart poor" as has already been evidenced.
</P>
<P>
The program also needed to be re-oriented so that it
reinforces existing support systems operating at the community
level meant to help the destitute.

order. It is of great importance to maintain exchanges of visits
of senior leaders between the two countries, he added.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
left here today for Rabat to meet with Moroccan King Hassan II on
his second visit in two months to promote the Mideast peace
process and bilateral cooperation on all levels.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders will discuss the Arab efforts to push

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Condemns Attack on Staff by Zairean Armed Military </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Children's Fund
(UNICEF) today condemned Monday's attack on its staff by five
armed men in military uniforms in the eastern Zairean town of Goma.
</P>
<P>
Carol Bellamy, the agency's executive director described the
attack as "barbaric behavior" and called on leaders of the
Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire to
find and capture those responsible.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF said the armed men, dressed in uniforms of the ADFL led
by Laurent Kabila, threatened and beat two foreign and three
local agency staff in their house. The armed men initially said
they were searching for weapons, but later demanded money.
</P>
<P>
"Whatever the circumstances were, it is absolutely unacceptable
for UNICEF staff should be subjected to such acts of terror,"
Bellamy said in a statement. "It is a total affront to the
fundamental principles of humanitarian assistance," she said.
</P>
<P>
The agency said the ADFL had been informed of the attack. But
ADFL authorities in Goma said it was possible the assailants were
trying to discredit the ADFL by wearing ADFL-style uniforms.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier, Tanzanian President Hold Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng and
Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa today highly valued the
Sino-Tanzanian friendship and promised to join efforts to
accelerate mutually beneficial cooperation between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Having traveled six African countries, Li said, he was deeply
impressed by the rich resources of the African continent and by
the diligence of the African people.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted, Africa is still at poverty and
underdevelopment, which are the result of the long-time
colonialism and the unjust and unequitable international order.
</P>
<P>
In such a situation "it is all the more necessary to establish
a new peaceful, stable, just and equitable international
political and economic order, so as to bring about peace and
development," Li Peng stated. As for differences and
disputes among the developing countries, they should be settled
through negotiation and consultation.
</P>
<P>
Li praised the Sino-Tanzanian cooperation as one of the
models of the South-South cooperation, citing frequent exchanges of
visits by leaders of the two countries, growing economic and
technological exchanges and increasing mutual understanding and
support in international affairs.
</P>
<P>
Li expressed the hope that his trip to Tanzania, the last leg
of his 7-nation African tour, would help enance mutual
understanding and deepen the traditional friendship and that
specific ways of cooperation in broader areas in the new
international situation could be explored. During the current
trip, he has visited Seychelles, Zambian, Mozambique, Gabon,
Cameroun and Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa said Premier Li Peng's trip to Tanzania and other
African countries fully demonstrated the friendly sentiments of
the Chinese people towards the Tanzanian people. Mkapa shared Li
Peng's view on the establishment of a new international political
and economic order, saying Tanzania is ready to cooperate with
China on the international arena. Tanzania would unswervingly
uphold the "One China" policy, he noted. Mkapa also extended
congratulations to China on the resuming of exercising
sovereignty over Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Expounding necessity of the changes of economic cooperation in
both ways and content, Li said, the readjustment or reforms in
this regard is aimed at meeting the needs of the new situation and
at continuing expanding the cooperation. Such a cooperation should
be based on equality and mutual benefit, give free rein to each
side's advantages, and better supplement each other, thus producing
efficiency for both sides, Li stressed.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng stated that the Chinese government would support and
encourage the bilateral cooperation in diverse forms in such areas
as automobile assembling, textile, agriculture and mining.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa said he welcomes Chinese enterprises to Tanzania, either
investing, running joint ventures and cooperative enterprises or
setting up wholly-owned firms. The joint ventures could
manufacture commodities oriented to eastern and southern
Africa as Tanzania wishes to become a bridge and gate of China's
economic exchanges with the regions, Mkapa said, adding that the
Tanzanian government would provide necessary gurantee by means of
legislation and the formulation of policies for enterprises of
both sides.
</P>
<P>
The famous Tanzania-Zambia railway has been playing an active
role in the economic development of the two countries, Li said.
And Li and Mkapa are of the identical view that China, Tanzania
and Zambia should strengthen cooperation in funding, renewing
equipment and improving management so as to make the artery
better serve the economic development.
</P>
<P>
After the talks, Li Peng and Mkapa oversaw the signing of 3
agreements between the two countries, namely, the Agreement on
Sino-Tanzanian Economic and Technological Cooperation, the
Agreement on China Providing Exclusive Loans to the Tanzanian and
Zambian Governments for Tanzania-Zambia Railway, and the
Documents on China Providing Aid to the Zanzibar Government.

<HEADLINE> Australia Plans for Stronger Economic Growth, Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Australia's economy is projected
to grow 3.75 percent in 1997-1998 with the underlying inflation
rate remaining unchanged at 2.0 percent and unemployment rate
growing slightly to 8.75 percent, the federal government announced
tonight.
</P>
<P>
According to the federal budget submitted today by Federal
Treasurer Peter Costello to the parliament, the nation's economic
growth rate for the fiscal year 1997-1998 is forecast at 3.75
percent, from this year's 3.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
The mid-year forecast for an underlying deficit in 1996-1997 of
8.5 billion Australian dollars narrowed to 6.9 billion (one
Australian dollar is equal to 0.78 U.S. dollars), while next
year's forecast widened by about 400 million Australian dollars to
3.9 billion.
</P>
<P>
Costello pointed to a turnaround in the budget position from a
10.3 billion Australian dollars deficit in 1995-1996 to a 1.6
billion Australian dollars surplus within the coalition
government's first parliamentary term.
</P>
<P>
The treasurer attributed the deficit reduction to spending
cuts, with public housing, pharmaceutical benefits and child care
the main target, and revenue increase, including large scale
privatization program, such as the sale of one-third of Telstra,
the nation's leading telecommunications company, or long-term
leases on major airports in Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth.
</P>
<P>
The government slashed foreign aid budget by about 26 million
Australian dollars to 1,430 million, down one percent on estimated
1996-1997 outlays, Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
Among others, it cut 561 million Australian dollars from
Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and 200 million Australian dollars
over four years from public housing funding to states.
</P>
<P>
The treasurer also announced measures to encourage private
saving, boost small business, create jobs and help families by
providing assistance and savings rebate.
</P>
<P>
"With more saving we can finance more of our investment to grow
the economy faster and produce jobs," he said in a speech to the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
The budget was criticized by the opposition party as doing
nothing for job creation.
</P>
<P>
Opposition treasury spokesman Careth Evans said, "There were
high expectations for job creation, industry and regional
initiatives, but they have been all dashed."

<HEADLINE> Inspection Group to Enforce Product Quality Law (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 13 (Xinhua) -- China's top legislature will
inspect the enforcement of Law on Product Quality by sending
inspection groups next month to four of the provinces in east and
central China.
</P>
<P>
The move is intended to continue the efforts to tighten
supervision over and management of quality of products to
safeguard the rights and interests of users and consumers and to
improve the country's economic order.
</P>
<P>
"We must attach greater importance to the issue of product
quality," Wang Guangying, vice-chairman of the Standing Committee
of the National People's Congress (NPC), told a meeting here today
for the deployment of law enforcement inspection of product
quality by the NPC Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
The law enforcement of product quality has a great bearing on
China's economic development and improvement of the people's living
standards, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Law on Product Quality was adopted by the NPC Standing
Committee in February 1993, and relevant laws have been put into
force since then.
</P>
<P>
These laws have played an important role in maintaining the
order of China's socialist market economy and protecting the
rights and interests of users and consumers in the past four
years or so, the vice-chairman said.

He added that a strong sense of quality of products has been
built up among residents of the whole nation, product quality has
been steadily improved, and large numbers of enterprises have
begun to pay closer attention to their product quality, marketing
and efficiency.

<P>
According to the meeting, based on the Law on Product Quality,
the inspection will focus on enforcement of the law by local
governmental institutions and technical supervision departments at
various levels.

<HEADLINE> Carelessly Disposed Garbage Kills Wild Animals in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Indiscriminately disposed garbage
wounds at least one wild animal every week and has killed many of
them in Queen Elizabeth National Park in western Uganda, the New
Vision reported today.
</P>
<P>
Ludwig Siefert, an expert from the Faculty of Veterinary
Medicine of Makerere University in Kampala, said that the most
dangerous rubbish is the hard objects such as cans and bottles that
cut feet of the animals looking for food or even kill them.
</P>
<P>
The most affected animal is warthog, an African pig with two tusks
and warts on its face.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan veterinary experts diagnosed a lung disease among the
warthogs and believed the disease could be tuberculosis infected
through food remians in dumped garbage, Siefert said.
</P>
<P>
He discribed the garbage abandoned by tourists as ''a disaster
to wild animals''.
</P>
<P>
Another wild animal susceptible to the dangerous remains is
mangoose, an African animal of Kangaroo family roaming in the area,
he added. enditem

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin's Interview with French Journalist (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the major issues concerning relations across the Taiwan
Straits, President Jiang said that the most important thing is
adherence to the "one China" principle internationally.
</P>
<P>
"That is, there is only one China in the world. The government
of the People's Republic of China is the sole legal government
representing the whole of China, and Taiwan is an inalienable part
of China," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
This is a fact that has been widely recognized by the United
Nations and the international community, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan question is an important question of principle that
has a bearing on China's sovereignty, territorial integrity and
the great cause of national reunification, the president said.
</P>
<P>
"To put an end to the separation between the two sides of the
Straits and realize the reunification of Taiwan and the mainland
is the common aspiration of all Chinese both in China and
overseas," he said. "It is also where the fundamental interests of
the Chinese nation lie. On such a question involving state
sovereignty the Chinese government has no room for any
compromise."
</P>
<P>
"Our basic policy on resolving the Taiwan question is
'peaceful reunification and `one country, two systems'," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"We always stand for a settlement of political differences
between the two sides and the realization of the reunification of
Taiwan and the mainland through political negotiations under
the 'one China' principle," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government and people have made unremitting efforts
to this end, he said, adding that on January 30, 1995, he
personally made an eight-point proposal for the peaceful
reunification of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
"I proposed, among other things, that as the first step the two
sides can conduct negotiations on 'officially ending the state of
hostility between the two sides of the Straits under the principle
that there is only one China'," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"These proposals of ours are both reasonable and workable,
demonstrating our determination and sincerity about resolving the
Taiwan question on the 'one China' basis," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We will, as always, resolutely uphold this principle and move
the cross-Straits relations further forward," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that whether or not cross-Straits relations can
improve and move forward steadily hinges on whether or not the
Taiwan authorities stick to the "one China" principle, truly
return to the "one China" position and stop their splittist
activities to create "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan" on
the international scene.

<TEXT>
<P>
As for the Tibet issue, President Jiang said that Tibet has
been part of China's territory since ancient times.
</P>
<P>
"Though there have been changes of central authorities, the
Tibet region has always been under the effective jurisdiction of
China's successive central governments," Jiang pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The Tibetans are members of the big family of the Chinese
nation, which is composed of 56 ethnic groups, he said.
</P>
<P>
In 1959 the Dalai Lama and some elements of the then Tibetan
local government staged an armed rebellion in an attempt to
preserve the theocratic feudal serfdom that had existed in old
Tibet and to separate Tibet from the rest of China, Jiang said,
adding that the Dalai Lama fled the country after the rebellion
failed.
</P>
<P>
The president said that the Dalai Lama, with the support and
connivance of certain foreign forces, has clung to his position of
splitting the motherland and has never ceased his separatist
activities.
</P>
<P>
"He has sent agents into China's Tibetan-inhabited areas to
plot and instigate riots," Jiang said." At the same time, he has
tried to internationalize the question of Tibet by traveling
around the world begging for support."
</P>
<P>
Certain foreign forces have bestowed on him various laurels
while indulging in fabricating sensational lies about Tibet, the
president said.
</P>
<P>
"For us, we welcome visits to Tibet by foreigners, as then they
can see for themselves the real situation there," he went on to
say. "All those who go there will find a Tibet that is nothing
like the stories they have been told."
</P>
<P>
Thanks to support and assistance from the central government
and people all over the country, Tibet has, over the past few
decades, achieved economic growth, social progress and ethnic
harmony, Jiang said, noting that the people there live in peace
and contentment, enjoying steadily rising living standards and
guaranteed freedom of religion.
</P>
<P>
When asked to comment on the current status of Sino-French
relations, President Jiang said that the bilateral relations
between the two countries indeed experienced certain setbacks in
the early 1990s, and this was "something we did not want to see".
</P>
<P>
He said that he himself visited France in September 1994, and
Premier Li Peng also paid an official visit last April.
</P>
<P>
"Both visits produced significant results in the political,
economic and trade areas, and enhanced our friendly cooperation in
all fields," Jiang said. "We view with joy and satisfaction the
sound growth of bilateral ties."
</P>
<P>
The forthcoming visit to China by President Chirac will be yet
another major event in Sino-French relations, he said, noting
that the maintenance of regular contacts between leaders of the
two countries is of great importance in that it helps deepen
mutual understanding, develop friendship, increase trust and
expand cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"I am confident that the forthcoming visit by President Chirac
will further facilitate the all-round growth of Sino-French
relations," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
With today's world continuing to move toward multipolarity,
China and France -- both permanent members of the UN Security
Council -- are in the position to exert a major influence in
international affairs, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, to step up bilateral consultations and cooperation
and forge a long-term and stable relationship of friendship and
cooperation oriented to the 21st century will serve not only
the interests of our two countries but also the efforts to
establish a new Asia-Europe partnership as well as peace,
stability and development the world over," President Jiang said.

<HEADLINE> French Ambassador to China Hails Chirac's Coming Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 13 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac's
forthcoming visit to China will be "one of extreme importance",
said French Ambassador to China Pierre Morel during a recent
exclusive interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The president hopes that his visit, the first by a French state
leader in 14 years, will touch upon all sectors since France
expects to be a co-operative partner of China on an overall scale,
Morel said.
</P>
<P>
France is ready for long-term cooperation with China in
different fields, such as politics, economy, technology, culture,
education, environmental protection, city construction, etc., he
said.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador reiterated that Chirac's visit will "strongly
promote" bilateral relations. "We hope the visit will push
bilateral ties to a new stage and make the co-operative
partnership between France and China more orderly and
systematically planned," he said.
</P>
<P>
The development of bilateral relations has proved that the
joint communique issued by the two governments on January 12,
1994, was well-prepared and well-drafted, he noted, adding that
the document has enabled both sides to carry out fruitful
co-operation and reach common understandings.
</P>
<P>
The two governments have exerted great efforts in making and
observing these decisions, he said.
</P>
<P>
"That doesn't mean that we hold the same views on all issues.
But when our opinions are different we hold constructive
dialogues candidly and calmly, and always respect each other, with a
view to deepening our mutual understanding," Morel said.
</P>
<P>
Both France and China are always trying to seek common ground
and opportunities for the development of both countries in both
the political and economic spheres, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The rapid growth of bilateral ties over the past three years
shows that the two countries have successfully opened up a new
road in this regard, he added.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador revealed that President Chirac will also raise
the issue of Sino-European relations during his coming visit. "We
should make closer the relationship between France and the rest of
Europe and Asia, especially China," he said.
</P>
<P>
Morel pointed out that, as permanent members of the United
Nations Security Council, both France and China bear special
responsibilities, and should contribute more to the peace and
security of the world.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, France and China have increased their
consultations on important global issues, and have achieved
notable results and have deepened their mutual understanding, he
said.

<HEADLINE> Soeharto Accuses Parties of Violating Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto urged
today that leaders of the country's three political parties be
admonished for what he called "brutal acts" committed by their
supporters during election campaigns.
</P>
<P>
The president gave the instruction to Chairman of the Election
supervisory Committee Singgih when the latter reported to him the
campaign activities.
</P>
<P>
"We should uphold the campaign regulations," Singgih said,
adding that brutalities have increased since election campaign
started on April 27.
</P>
<P>
Singgih, who is also the attorney general, said 49 people have
died in the past 17 days.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the three parties -- the United Development Party
(PPP), the ruling Golkar party and the Indonesian Democratic Party
(PDI) -- "have already broken the campaign rules."
</P>
<P>
Their violations range from light to heavy, he added.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the three parties, he said, should be reprimanded
because they are responsible for their supporters' actions.
</P>
<P>
The three parties, which are preparing to contest the May 29
poll, will end their campaigns on May 23.
</P>
<P>
They will vie for 425 seats in the 500-seat House of
Representatives during the forthcoming election. The other 75
seats are reserved for the military, whose members do not vote.
</P>
<P>
In this year's campaign, the country is divided into three
groups of campaign areas where the three parties could conduct
their campaign activities in turn.
</P>
<P>
According to new election rules, motor parades and marches are
not allowed during the campaign. However, all the three parties
have violated the rules by showing their strength in the streets.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 124 million voters are expected to take part in the
general election, the sixth in the country since 1971.

<P>
PUSAN, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese gymnasts demonstrated their
world-class skills to finish one-two in both the men's and women's
individual all-around events at the second East Asian Games here on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Jinjing, all-around fourth-placer at the Atlanta Olympic
Games, overcame the injury to his stomach to collect 56.400 points for
the top honour, while teammate budding star Huang Xu finished second
on 55.450 with the bronze medal going to Lee Joo-hyung of South Korea
on 55.200.
</P>
<P>
"Zhang displayed his top forms in four out of the six events, he
deserves the gold medal as he finished successfully in the rings, the
pommel horse, the parallel bars and the horizontal bar with new
routines," said Qian Kui, team manager of the Chinese Gymnastic
delegation.
</P>
<P>
Zhang scored the most of 9.650 points in the rings and the best of
9.600 in the horizontal bar.
</P>
<P>
"Even before the last event of floor exercise, I was sure of
winning the gold medal as my chief rivals were in the distant places,"
said Zhang prior to the medal-awarding ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Lu Yufu, who finished atop the standing after the team event,
failed in both pommel horse and horizontal bar, finished in a distant
six place on 54.750 points with the day-high score of 9.700 in the
parallel bar.
</P>
<P>
"It did not surprise us when Lu suffered the blunts because he
tried the most difficult routines in the competition," said manager
Qian.
</P>
<P>
"Lu remains as our promising star since he is an all-around gymnast
with no weak event in the six apparatuses," the manager said.
</P>
<P>
The women's gold and silver medals were all taken by the Chinese
entries as veteran Liu Xuan beat down injuries to her legs and kept
her top forms in all the four events.
</P>

in her strong event of floor exercise to rank fourth with a total of
37.162 points.
</P>
<P>
Kui was the gold medalist in the floor exercise at the 1996 World
Championships in Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
"Our athletes had dominating advantages over their peers in the
games which was being exploited to whet their prowess for the 1998
Asian Games and the 2000 Olympic Games," said Qian Kui.
</P>
<P>
So far, the Chinese gymnasts had swept all four gold medals in the
competitions with other 10 to be contested on Wednesday.

HONG KONG, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Work will start next week in Kwai
Chung on the Kowloon Peninsula for the construction of the
Butterfly Valley Primary Service Reservoir, according to the Water

<HEADLINE> HK Seminar on Year 2000 Problem Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Worrying about your computer of a
"sudden death" or malfunctioning at the turn of the century?
Racking your brain for possible disputes arising as one of the
consequences?
</P>
<P>
These were some of the topics at a one-day seminar here today.
The speakers urged solutions to be found before it was too late,
on the global issue of "The Year 2000 Problem" concerning the date
setting on computer systems worldwide.
</P>
<P>
But David Carse, deputy chief executive of the Hong Kong
Monetary Authority (HKMA), warned the audience that there would be
no "magic" solution.
</P>
<P>
The long-standing problem poses a terrifying picture that at
00:00:01 on the first day's morning of Year 2000, many computer
systems worldwide could malfunction or produce incorrect
information simply because the date has changed, according to
Carse.
</P>
<P>
And in a world so badly relying on computer systems, it could
cause wide-ranging implications for suppliers and customers, and
among the consequences could be business disruption or even
breakdown and, most probably, legal implications.
</P>
<P>
Time consuming and costly though, researchers worldwide who are
facing the exactly same deadline are competing for scarce
resources to fix the problem, Carse said.
</P>
<P>
And the HKMA has set for itself a target of having a Year 2000
compliant system in place by December 31, 1998, just one year
before that pressing deadline, he added.
</P>
<P>
The problem was caused by the fact that in the early days of
computing history, nobody thought the computer systems could be
used into the next millennium. And, on the economic side, a
two-digit system has been adopted in presenting the year to save
space in storage as external disk memory was expensive in the
early days for computers, according to Harenton Kam Nang Leung,
associate director and assistant professor at the Software
Technology Facilities Center in the Department of computing of the
Hong Kong Polytechnic University.
</P>
<P>
And one of the solutions will be to use Year 2000 compliant
products including programming languages, data management systems,
operating systems, system utilities, communication software,
embedded microcode and applications software, which were designed
to be used prior to, during, and after Year 2000, and will operate
without error relating to date data.
</P>
<P>
Some have already taken pre-cautions. HongKong Bank, for
example, started 10 years ago a policy that all new systems or
major changes in existing systems had to include Year 2000
compliance. So by now, almost all the bank's systems have been
Year 2000 compliant.
</P>
<P>
The bank has planned to make all the systems Year 2000
compliant by mid-1998, according to Bob Carlson, head of
Information Technology of the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking
Corporation Limited.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Iranian forces today claimed a
success for the first and second stages of a war game that started
in the Persian Gulf on May 11.
</P>
<P>
Iran's official news agency reported that the first part of
the maneuvers consisted of commando and anti-commando operations
on land and sea, airlifting of personnel by helicopters and mine
sweeping operations.
</P>
<P>
At the second stage, the report said, participating forces
carried out various defense operations against possible attacks
with both conventional and chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the third stage of the military
exercises, which includes attacks by Iranian marines on
hypothetical enemy positions and air raids on pre-determined
points, is to start soon.
</P>
<P>
Some 4,000 Iranian air and naval forces are taking part in
the joint military maneuvers code-named "Ya Hussein Shahid" in
the Persian Gulf and Sea of Oman.
</P>
<P>
The military exercises cover an area of 24,000 nautical
miles in south of the Persian Gulf.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin's Interview With French Journalist  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin had
an interview with a correspondent from French Magazine "Politique
Internationale" at Zhongnanhai, headquarter of the Communist Party
of China, on March 26 this year and answered his questions on the
political system in China, relations between the two sides of the
Taiwan Straits, the Tibet issue, and the Sino-French relations.
</P>
<P>
Answering questions about China's political system and major
difficulties between China and the western countries, Jiang said,
the form of a country's political system or political structure is
determined by its national conditions.
</P>
<P>
"These national conditions may include such things as the
country's politics, economy, culture, historical traditions, and
natural conditions, etc.,"
</P>
<P>
"The People's Republic of China is a socialist state. Our
Constitution provides that all state power belongs to the
people. The people's congresses are the organs through which the
people exercise state power. This is our fundamental political
system," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"We practice a system of multi-party cooperation and political
consultation under the leadership of the Communist Party as the
basic political structure of the country," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Regional autonomy is practiced in areas where people of
the ethnic groups live in concentrated communities,"
</P>
<P>
"Practice shows that our country's political system is
consistent with its national conditions as it has ensured the
fundamental political rights of the people, maintained the
national unity, solidarity of ethnic groups and social stability,"
Jiang continued.
</P>
<P>
"Even among the western countries, political structures differ
from one another with some practicing presidential republics while
others, parliamentary republics. It is thus obviously improper to
judge the political system of one country by that of another," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"We will actively carry out political reform and strengthen our
building of socialist democracy and a legal system. In this
process, we will assimilate the outstanding achievements of other
countries while carrying forward the fine traditions of our own,"
Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"Peace and development are the two main themes of the world
today. Maintaining global peace, enhancing friendship and
cooperation and promoting common development are the common desire
of all peoples," Jiang stressed.
</P>
<P>
"At present, worldwide stability and development are threatened
by such serious problems as poverty, unemployment, refugee flows,
crimes, population explosion, environmental degradation, drug
abuse and terrorism," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"Though different in their national conditions, China and
western countries share broad common interests on a wide range of
major international issues," the Chinese president said.
</P>
<P>
"I am happy to see the improvement and expansion of China's
relations with them," he added.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese Government and people stand ready to made a
contribution to the lofty cause of peace and development together
with the governments and peoples of all countries, including those
of western countries, on the basis of mutual respect, equality and
mutual benefit," Jiang said

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin's Interview with French Journalist (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jiang said that a sound and stable relationship between China
and Western countries accords with the aspirations and fundamental
interests of people in respective countries and is conducive to peace,
stability and prosperity the world over.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the two sides should "stand on higher ground and
take the long view", look upon their relations with a strategic,
world-oriented and 21st century-oriented approach and bear in mind
both their immediate and long-term interests.
</P>
<P>
"This requires that we properly handle the following
questions," he said:
</P>
<P>
"The first is how to treat our differences. I believe we should
work together to narrow our differences gradually on the basis of
mutual respect, equal dialogue and seeking common ground
while putting aside differences so as to preserve and advance our
common interests," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"We live in a colorful world of diversity. Such diversity has
made it possible for countries to interact and cooperate," he said.
</P>
<P>
Even in Western Europe, while actively promoting integration,
countries remain quite vocal about keeping their ethnic and
cultural distinctions.
</P>
<P>
The only right approach to the conduct of state-to-state
relations is to adhere to the Five Principles of Peaceful
Coexistence, recognize and face up to the differences in ideology,
social system and the level of economic and cultural
development. We must also make a break from the Cold War mentality
and the practice of the strong lording it over the weak, Jiang
noted.
</P>
<P>
The second is how to view China's development. China is the
largest developing country in the world. If China, as home to one
fifth of the world's population, can maintain political stability
and economic prosperity, it is in itself a great contribution to
world peace, stability and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Conversely, if China is unstable and stagnant, or if it should
bog down in prolonged poverty and backwardness, this will be
highly detrimental to world stability.
</P>
<P>
Now some Westerners deliberately exaggerate China's economic
strength and spread the "China threat" fallacy. This is totally
wrong. China's reform, opening-up and modernization programs need
an international environment of long-term peace and
stability. Even when China becomes more powerful, it will by no
means pose a threat to other countries, Jiang stressed.
</P>
<P>
The third is how to handle economic and trade cooperation. Such
cooperation between China and the Western countries is a mutually
beneficial one.
</P>
<P>
Economic growth in China has not only improved the living
standards of its own people, but also provided a fresh driving force
to world economic growth, together with greater business
opportunities for developed countries. China is a newly emerging
market with enormous potential, while the Western countries boast
advanced technology and abundant capital.
</P>
<P>
The two sides are highly complementary economically. The
discriminatory trade policies against China adopted by some
Western countries, while harming others, will in the end undermine
their own interests.
</P>
<P>
On China's entry to the WTO, Jiang said, "Our position is that
the WTO is incomplete without China's participation, and that
as China is a developing country it is inappropriate to ask it to
meet excessive demands."

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Doctors to Lend Helping Hand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong doctors and nurses are
called on to donate their one-day income earned on June 2, 1997, to
Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), a world-wide medical relief
organization dedicated to saving lives in extreme circumstances.
</P>
<P>
Alain Guilloux, executive director of MSF, said: "This will be
the first time that Hong Kong doctors and nurses unite with MSF to
help save lives around the world."
</P>
<P>
Over 2,000 doctors and nurses are now working for MSF in over
70 countries to help victims of disasters and wars. So far, three
Hong Kong doctors and two nurses have volunteered to work for MSF
in Africa for six to nine months.
</P>
<P>
"Since few doctors can afford to leave their practice in Hong
Kong for such a long time, we have, therefore, set aside June 2,
1997, as our Medical Day when they can volunteer to give up one day
of their income to support those MSF volunteers currently working
in the field," said Guilloux.
</P>
<P>
The appeal has won support from more than 20 local doctors and
nurses, including prominent members of the medical profession in
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Arthur K C Li, chancellor of the Chinese University of
Hong Kong, said: "We are involved in a compassionate profession,
which needs a sense of service and sacrifice, and which is not
only a means of business."
</P>
<P>
Professor S. P. Chow, dean of Faculty of Medicine of the
University of Hong Kong, who once worked as a volunteer doctor of
MSF in the Vietnamese refugee camps, also called on his colleges
to lend a helping hand. Hong Kong now has 8,000 registered doctors
and 28,000 registered nurses.
</P>
<P>
MSF did not set a target for fund raising on June 2, 1997, said
the executive director, who hoped to donate part of the money to
the needy in Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1971, MSF has offered medical assistance to
Vietnamese refugees in Hong Kong, and some areas stricken by
natural disasters in China.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Small Towns Boosting China's Rural Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Over 50,000 small towns in China
are pushing forward economic development and absorbing surplus
labor in the country's vast rural area.
</P>
<P>
According to latest official figures, more than 50,000
marketplaces have been set up in these urban areas, with a yearly
trading volume of over 450 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Some 60 percent of rural enterprises are based in these small
towns, which have employed a total of 150 million rural laborers
and generate 60 percent of the gross domestic product in the
countryside.
</P>
<P>
The small towns have helped curb the influx of excessive rural
labor into cities. In the past five years, these small
communities have relocated about 60 million former farmers, and in
the future, seven to eight million rural people will be employed
in small towns and engaged in various industries.
</P>
<P>
An official from the Ministry of Construction told Xinhua that
China has been taking its own path in developing cities, based on
the principles of "strictly controlling the scale of large cities,
properly developing small cities, and actively expanding small
towns".
</P>
<P>
In some developed regions like the Pearl River Delta area, the
Yangtze River Delta, and Fujian, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Shandong,
Liaoning, and Sichuan provinces where small towns have sprung up in
recent years, local farmers have introduced funds from other parts
of the country and abroad.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, these former farmers have been engaged in developing
urban facilities in these towns to narrow the gap in living
standards between urban residents and villagers.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1996, more than half of the families in small
towns have moved into new houses, with an average 17.18 m-living
space per capita, while 5.92 billion sq m-multi-story apartment
buildings have been put up in these towns, making up over 27
percent of the country's total coverage of residential buildings.
</P>
<P>
The mushrooming of these small urban places has bolstered the
construction of local infrastructure. According to official
figures, by the end of last year, China has over 3.09 million km
of rural roads, 69.8 percent of which have been paved.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, over 330 million rural people have access to
running water facilities, accounting for 33.9 percent of the
country's total rural population.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 100 percent of small towns and 74.8 percent of villages
have been electrified, while the afforestation rate in these tiny
cities have also been enhanced.
</P>
<P>
According to the country's blueprint for the development of its
small towns, China will modernize 10,000 small towns so as to
develop the local economy and absorb more excessive rural labor.

efforts in crackdown on illegal immigration, smuggling, drug
trafficking and triad crimes, according to Zheng.

<HEADLINE> Number of Visitors Up in Hong Kong in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The number of visitors attending
Hong Kong's conventions, exhibitions, tourist incentives and
business meetings rose to almost 356,000 in 1996, or by 4.1
percent as compared with the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Sally Brandon, manager of the Hong Kong Tourist Association
(HKTA), told reporters here today that the number of the events
grew by 39.3 percent in the same year, with a total of 3,030
recorded.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, there was significant growth in both the number of
events and the number of visitors in the corporate meetings
sector, up by 16 percent and 59.1 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
HKTA believes one of reasons for this is the 1997 handover,
which may have spurred major international corporations to bring
their senior executives to Hong Kong to explore opportunities in
the territory. In addition, Hong Kong's position as the major
gateway to China has played an important role in this sector.
</P>
<P>
Another sector of the convention and incentive travel business
that showed good growth in 1996 was incentive movements. The
number of incentive trips to Hong Kong rose by 52 percent to 2,270
groups and the number of visitors on the trips increased by 12.4
percent to more than 100,500.
</P>
<P>
The convention and incentive travel sector remains an important
one for Hong Kong's tourism industry and its economy in general.
It is estimated that visitors traveling on this business tend to
stay twice as long as vacation visitors.
</P>
<P>
The number of association meetings held in Hong Kong rose by
9.7 percent to 294 last year, although the number of attendees
dropped by 17.3 percent to just over 57,000. HKTA attributes this
disparity mainly to the exceptionally large number of visitors
attending an unusually high number of mega association meetings in
1995.
</P>
<P>
The HKTA expects significant growth in this sector this year,
with a large number of association meetings already confirmed for
Hong Kong, in particular the Annual Meetings of the Boards of
Governors of World Bank Group and International Monetary Fund in
September.
</P>
<P>
The exhibitions sector showed a minor drop of 6.3 percent in
the number of events (59 in 1996) and 4 percent rise in the number
of visitors, bringing the total to some 177,000.
</P>
<P>
With the added capacity at the Hong Kong Convention and
Exhibition Center due to come on line soon, the HKTA expects more
exhibition organizers to choose Hong Kong as their venue, and
forecasts that the exhibitions already staged on a regular basis
in Hong Kong will increase in size.

<HEADLINE> DNA Test in Pipeline to Detect Chlamydia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 13 (Xinhua) -- British scientists are
developing an inexpensive DNA test that can detect hidden
carriers of chlamydia, the most common sexually transmitted
disease, The Daily Telegraph reported today.
</P>
<P>
The British Wellcome Trust has awarded 1.7 million pounds
(about 2.7 million U.S. dollars) to the project, led by Dr
Helen Lee at Cambridge University.
</P>
<P>
Dr Lee said that the "dipstick" test relied on detecting the
organism's genetic code.
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to develop an inexpensive test in a format so
simple that it works in the same way as a pregnancy test," she
said.
</P>
<P>
Symptoms of infection are minor and often disappear
without treatment. But untreated, the disease will continue
to do damage internally and can lead to infertility in
women.
</P>
<P>
In England, about 30 percent of men and 70 percent of women are
infected by chlamydia.

<HEADLINE> Combating Desertification A Strategic Task For China, Vice Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Combating desertification will
remain an arduous challenge and will be a long-term task which
requires sustained efforts, Vice-Premier Jiang Chunyun said today.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made this remark at the opening ceremony of the Asian
Ministerial Conference on the Implementation of UN Convention to
Combat Desertification (UNCCD).
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Asia is one of the regions in the world
most severely affected by desertification, and that the
conference, a major initiative taken by Asian countries, will help
to develop positive regional cooperation in Asia so as to combat
desertification hand in hand.
</P>
<P>
He said that desertification has hindered the social and
economic development and the improvement of people's living
standard in some areas, and, "in other areas most severely
effected by desertification, the problem of food and shelter for
local residents remains unsolved."
</P>
<P>
According to a recent survey, the total area of desertified
land in China is 2.622 million sq km, 27.3 percent of the
country's total land mass.
</P>
<P>
"Combating desertification in China is a must not only for
sustainable social and economic development within the country,
but also for improvement of the global environment," said the
Vice-Premier.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government is willing to develop broad cooperation
and exchanges with other Asian countries so as to make due
contributions to the global cause of combating desertification,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
According to the Vice-Premier, as a basic state policy, the
Chinese government has incorporated anti-desertification efforts
into plans for national economic and social development.
</P>
<P>
"The National Program to Combat Desertification and the `Three
North' Shelterbelt Program have brought more than 16 million
hectares of farmland and some 10 million hectares of rangeland
under effective protection," he told the 160 participants from 43
Asian countries and 18 governmental and non-governmental
organizations.
</P>
<P>
"Now 795 counties in plain areas have met the standards for
afforestation and the forest cover in China has risen from 8
percent in the early years after the founding of New China to
13.92 percent at present," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Conference is being jointly sponsored by the Chinese
government and the secretariat of UNCCD. Xu Youfang, Minister of
Forestry, chaired today's opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The conference will focus on the discussion of combating
desertification measures and the formulation of a common action
plan for Asian countries.

SHANGHAI, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Twelve large business groups in
Shanghai have been transferred the right to use the state-owned
land.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Municipal Administration of Real Estate signed
respective agreements with the 12 conglomerates on May 10 and

have been authorized to exercise management over housing
properties with a combined floor space of 308,000 sq m.
</P>
<P>
The move is intended to change the past practices under which
units use state-owned land assigned to them forever or use rented
state-owned housing properties permanently, and to enliven
state-owned real estate sector, according to local officials.
</P>
<P>
The conglomerates are authorized to exercise the right to
management and operation over their respective land and housing
properties assigned to them, while making sure that the state-owned
real estate properties will increase in value.
</P>
<P>
They can also re-lease or exchange such properties, so as to
increase their respective total assets and to establish a new
property right that is compatible with the modern enterprise
system, said the officials.
</P>

<HEADLINE> 7th Arab Parliamentary Union Opens in Cairo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The 7th Arab Parliamentary Union
(APU) Conference opened here today, with a call to enhance Arab
solidarity and establish a powerful economic grouping.
</P>
<P>
"It is necessary to enhance Arab economic cooperation," Arab
League Secretary General Esmat Abdel Meguid told the APU opening
session.
</P>
<P>
In this respect, he called for the creation of an Arab free
trade zone as the proper introduction towards the establishment of
an Arab economic bloc.
</P>
<P>
The Arab countries have agreed to set up a free trade zone
within ten years starting from January 1998 as the first step to
create a common Arab market.
</P>
<P>
He said the APU can play a vital role in the activation and
strengthening of Arab joint action.
</P>
<P>
Following Meguid's address to the opening session, chaired by
Moroccan Parliament Speaker Galal el Said, Egyptian People
Assembly Speaker Fathi Sorour read out President Hosni Mubarak's
speech.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak called for an Arab collective spirit, a unified stand
and a clear-cut vision that would be able to overcome the global
and regional challenges.
</P>
<P>
Sorour, who was elected new APU chairman Monday, said that an
Arab solidarity and an Arab common market, two major topics tabled
on the conference' agenda, were the basic principles that will
make the Arab dream come true.
</P>
<P>
"Solidarity and a common market are linked, there can be no
market without solidarity and no effective solidarity without
economic cooperation," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also described the Arab unification as "the vital instrument
to stop Israel from breaching international law."
</P>
<P>
Altogether 17 top Arab lawmakers and their legislative
delegations take part in the conference.

<HEADLINE> SSE Tightens Stock Market Supervision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE)
will spend three million US dollars upgrading its market
supervision system and develop personnel, said a SSE official
today.
</P>
<P>
The SSE is determined to function as a front line supervisor of
the stock market, after the stock exchange moves into the new
Shanghai Securities Exchange Building in the Pudong New Area this
July, according to Lu Wenshan, deputy director of the SSE's
Legal Affairs Department.
</P>
<P>
Tight controls also await the securities companies, since the
SSE will unveil new systems to prompt the firms to submit
financial reports to the stock exchange and standardize the
inspection of securities companies, Lu said.
</P>
<P>
Lu said that all these moves are designed and taken to meet the
expansion demand of the stock market, and out of the need to
protect the public investors.
</P>
<P>
"As a front line supervisor of the stock market, the SSE not
only organizes and keeps close watch on the stock trading, it also
supervises the listed companies and SSE members to ensure 'open,
fair and just' trading in the market and thereby a standardized
operation of the stock market," said Lu.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Stock Exchange set up its supervision division in
early 1995, to concentrate its once-scattered supervisory forces
in the wake of an accelerated expansion of the stock market. The
division consists of three departments: market monitoring,
surveillance, and legal affairs.
</P>
<P>
An in-time market surveillance system also went into operation
early last year, enabling the stock exchange to have timely
knowledge of any abnormal movements in the stock prices and
thereby reduce investment risks as early as possible by
discovering and stemming market irregularities.
</P>
<P>
In spite of the progress already made, Lu Wenshan said his
stock exchange would spare no effort to learn from its overseas
counterparts, so as to absorb their experience in market
supervision and advanced stock trading and surveillance technology.
</P>
<P>
"The supervision of the stock market is a long-term task and
our goal is to become a world-class stock exchange," he said.

<HEADLINE> Gas Flaring Increases in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The rate of gas flaring has shot up
to 77 percent of the total production following drop in the
volume of gas utilized in Nigeria, the "Guardian" newspaper
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report said out of an estimated daily gas production of
3.8 billion standard cubic feet in the first quarter of this
year, only 20 percent were used by local industries or
re-injected by oil companies.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, gas flaring consumed 75 percent of the total
production, causing a daily loss of 433.5 million Naira, or 5.1
million U.S. Dollars, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Industry sources attributed the drop in gas utilization to
decline in intake for its thermal stations by the National
Electric Power Authority, the sole biggest user of the country's
rich natural gas resources.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government has set the year 2010 as the deadline
for the elimination of gas flaring, for which it has increased
the penalty for flaring from two kobo (100 kobos equal to one
Naira) to 50 kobo per thousand cubic feet.
</P>
<P>
In February this year alone, a total of 117 oil fields were
fined 4.83 million Naira (about 57, Dollars) for flaring, the
report said.

<HEADLINE> China Forges Strong Economic Ties with Latin America </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese entrepreneurs are eyeing
Latin American markets for new destinations for trade and
investment, according to a recent symposium held here, "China
Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
"Chinese companies should spare no effort to realize
localization -- to integrate production and sales," Dai
Yunlong, director-general of the American and Oceania Affairs
Department of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Co-operation (Moftec) said at the symposium Monday.
</P>
<P>
The proposed entity will be temporarily named " China and Latin
America Economic and Trade Development Co." aimed at foreign
trade, investment, exhibition organization and consultancy.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank predicted that the overall economic growth rate
of Latin America would hit 4.5 percent this year, higher than the
3 percent last year, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, China exported 3.12 billion US dollars in machinery
and electrical products, textiles, chemical products and
pharmaceuticals to Latin America countries, down 0.8 percent from
that in 1995.
</P>
<P>
China also imported 3.6 billion US dollars in such goods as
iron ore, copper, rolled steel, crude oil, wool and sugar -- up
21.6 percent from that in 1995, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1980s, Chinese entrepreneurs have launched about 160
wholly-owned and joint-venture efforts in 24 Latin American
countries, bringing total investment to 300 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
"But great potential still exists -- and we need to tap the
huge market further in view of long-term economic co-operation,"
said Dai.

LAGOS, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations (UN) Sanctions
Committee has launched a probe into Libyan leader Colonel Mummar
Ghaddafi's recent visits to Niger Republic and Nigeria to
ascertain if he has violated the UN air sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The "Vanguard" newspaper today quoted the United States' State

The UN imposed an air embargo on Libya in 1992 for its

suspected to have been involved in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am
aircraft over Lockherbie in Scotland, which killed 269 people.
</P>
<P>
Ghaddafi, however, flew into Niger Republic and Nigeria last

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Meets Former U.S. President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The Sino-U.S. relations are facing
a good chance of further enhancement, Chinese President Jiang
Zemin said here today.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with visiting former U.S. President George Bush
and his wife here this morning, Jiang said since the beginning of
this year, the bilateral relationship has maintained a trend of
improvement, as the high-level contacts and exchange of visits
have continued to increase.
</P>
<P>
He welcomed Bush to visit China again, saying he appreciated
Bush's years of efforts to support the progress of the
Sino-U.S. relations and to promote bilateral exchanges in various
fields.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said the history of the Sino-U.S. ties has shown that so
long as both sides earnestly abide by the three joint communiques
between the two countries, are far-sighted and oriented toward the
21st century, always grasp the common interests, properly handle
problems in the bilateral ties, especially the Taiwan issue, "We
thus would be able to continue to overcome difficulties and to
push our relationship forward on a long-term and stable basis."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese President hoped that Bush would continue to play
active role in promoting the healthy and stable development of the
Sino-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
In reply, Bush said that he has, as always, regarded the
U.S.-China relationship as the most important state-to-state
relationship in the world, but this relationship has often been
disturbed by various factors.
</P>
<P>
He noted that people should abandon their prejudice and see
clearly that a good relationship between the two countries are in
the fundamental interests of the people of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He believed that the bilateral ties will continue to be
improved and developed.
</P>
<P>
Bush extended welcome to Jiang's forthcoming state visit to the
U.S. this fall and wished the visit a complete success.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Jiang also briefed Bush on the Chinese
government's principled stand on the Hong Kong issue: "One
country, two systems; Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong; a high
degree of autonomy".
</P>
<P>
Bush said he believed that a smooth transition will be realized
in Hong Kong which in return will maintain its prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Present at the meeting was Liu Shuqing, president of the
Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, May 13 (Xinhua) -- State-owned enterprises in
northeast China's Liaoning Province are making unprecedented
efforts in industrial reorganization.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning has 1,426 large-and medium-sized state-owned
enterprises, or one tenth of the national total. They have a
combined fixed assets worth more than 360 billion yuan (43.37
billion US dollars). But, half of these enterprises had run at a
loss.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government has picked out petroleum, metallurgy,
machinery, and electronics as the pillar industries in the four
years running up to the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Thirtyeight state-owned enterprises, including the Anshan Iron
and Steel Company and the Panjin Ethylene Works, have been chosen
as the pace-setters. Some 140 billion yuan of investment will be
allocated to build 200 key projects in near future.
</P>
<P>
Over 320 industrial firms, including approximately 100 large or
medium-sized state-owned ones, declared bankruptcy, which reduced
the rate of assets and liabilities to 8.8 percent, a historical
low.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 25 competitive large state-owned firms have
displayed their abilities in an aggressive manner. They listed on
domestic stocks exchanges last year, pooling a total fund of three
billion yuan (361.45 million US dollars). The Liaoning-based stock
group is considered a "dark horse" on the Shanghai and Shenzhen
stocks exchanges.

<HEADLINE> Manila Urged to Spend More on Infrastructure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- In a bid to catch up with its
neighbors in terms of economic development, the Philippine
government must step up its efforts to develop infrastructure
projects, the Philippine News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
This recommendation was made by Gilbert Garchitorena, an
economist at the Institute for Economic Policy Research in Manila
after he noted that the Philippines has long lagged behind its
neighbors in economic growth because of poor infrastructures, the
reports said.
</P>
<P>
Local press reported earlier that the Philippines had the
lowest expenses on infrastructure in Asia, spending only two
percent of the gross national product (GNP) while the average
figure in Southeast Asia stands at seven percent of GNP.)
</P>
<P>
This deficiency in infrastructure facilities had not only
stunted growth but also discouraged a number of foreign investors
from driving down their stakes in the Philippines, Garchitorena
said in a research paper.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Philippine government should expand its
expenses on infrastructure construction while relying on the
private sector for infrastructure development.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993, private spending on infrastructure began overtaking
public expenses in the country, he said. In the first half of 1996
alone, private investments accounted for 65.3 percent of the total
gross value in infrastructure construction.

Zhao Xinliang, director of the Liaoning Provincial Planning
Commission, recently revealed that the market value of stocks
floated by local state-owned enterprises is expected to reach five
billion yuan by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
The Anshan Iron and Steel Company, Panjin Ethylene Work and two
other state-owned firms are to issue the H shares on the Hong Kong
Stock Exchange by June. The stock on the Shenyang-Dalian
Expressway is making final preparations for the listing in Hong
Kong, Zhao added.
</P>
<P>
During the province-wide reform, some state-owned enterprises
have joined hands to form 32 conglomerates in a bid to win a
bigger market share.
</P>
<P>
The Northeast Nonferrous Metal Group, which comprises a dozen
copper manufacturers, has developed into the largest nonferrous
firm in Asia.
</P>
<P>
The majority of Liaoning's 29,000 industrial firms are smaller
ones. To help them gear to the market economy, the provincial
government has introduced the share-holding system in 80 percent
of the medium and small enterprises.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the gross domestic product of Liaoning registered
a 8.6 percent rise to hit 315 billion yuan (37.95 billion US
dollars) in 1996. Its pre-tax revenue soared to some 40 billion
yuan (4.8 billion US dollars), 14 percent up from the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
Chinese economists deem that the industrial revolution in
Liaoning is an inevitable trend in building a socialist
market-oriented economy in China. The move will make this
traditional heavy industrial base even more competitive on both
domestic and international markets.

continued to grow between January and March whereas the value of
the local Renminbi (RMB) yuan was stable.
</P>
<P>
By the end of March, China's foreign exchange reserves reached
112.06 billion US dollars, up 7.03 billion US dollars from the end
of 1996. The yuan was quoted at around 8.29 against the US dollar
at the end of March.
</P>
<P>
Savings deposits of Chinese residents grew steadily in the
first three months of this year despite a bullish stock market and
a large issue of treasury bonds, the central bank noted.
</P>
<P>
Outstanding savings deposits were up 23.7 percent on a yearly
basis in the first three months to 4155.68 billion yuan (about 500
billion US dollars) by the end of March.

<P>
NAIROBI, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The sales of new motor vehicles in
Kenya fell by four percent to 3,056 units in the first quarter of

LUSAKA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Zambia has said it will maintain
the ban on ivory trade despite calls for its review by some
countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
Times of Zambia today quoted deputy minister Fidelis Mando as
saying here Monday that Zambia will not side with Zimbabwe during
the meeting of the Convention on Internationnal Trade in
Endangered Species (CITES) to be held next month in Harare
because its elephant population is still threatened.
</P>
<P>
Zambia has benefited from the CITES ban on ivory trade imposed
eight years ago and managed to bring the animal numbers to
appreciable levels, but this is far from the original, said
Mando.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, Botswana and Namibia are among the countries
favoring resuming limited international trade in ivory on the
ground that they have too many elephants and the limited ivory
trade can promote the conservation of the animal.
</P>
<P>
The CITES meeting will review the ban and consider placing the
elephant and rhino under appendix two to allow for restricted
trade.

<HEADLINE> International Meeting on Fast Reactors Held in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The 30th Annual Meeting of the
International Working Group on Fast Reactors sponsored by the
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) was held here today.
</P>
<P>
The meeting has drawn the participation of experts and
officials from France, Germany, Brazil, India, Japan, the Republic
of Korea, Sweden, Russia, Britain, the Republic of Kazakhstan, and
China.
</P>
<P>
Mr.A.Rinejski, a senior IAEA official, said in the opening
speech that through nearly 50 years of development, fast
reactor technology has undergone scientific feasibility
study and engineering feasibility study. It will soon go into
global commercial utilization, he said.
</P>
<P>
Rinejski noted it is of great importance to develop fast
reactors as means of the world's energy supply, for it will
sharply raise the utilization rate of the rare nuclear fuel --
uranium, from around one percent by the existing thermal neutron
reactors to 70 percent in the new fast reactors.
</P>
<P>
According to Xu Mi, chief engineer of China's Fast Reactor
Research Center and the executive chairman of the current meeting,
China is a populous country which is short in energy supply. China
will give priority to developing fast reactor power plants amid
its drive to launch large-scale nuclear power construction, for
they are believed to be more efficient and safer and with a higher
utilization rate of uranium.
</P>
<P>
He noted that China plans to complete its first fast neutron
reactor power plant by the turn of the century, in order to meet
its increasing energy needs.
</P>
<P>
The reactor, the state's largest high-tech energy project, will
develop a thermal power of 65 MW and an electrical power of 20
MW, providing the technical basis for the country's first
commercial fast reactor power plant at the beginning of the next
century.
</P>
<P>
According to IAEA sources, there are 20 fast reactors worldwide
which are either completed or under construction, including eight
operational ones.
</P>
<P>
At the three-day meeting, experts from various countries will
exchange views on the latest development of fast reactors in their
countries, and coordinate technological cooperation between them.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Biggest Port Fights Wayward Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's largest port city of
Mombasa has launched a crackdown on unscrupulous clearing and
forwarding firms holding un-canceled transit insurance bonds
worth million of Shillings.
</P>
<P>
Heads of such companies were questioned by Mombasa's customs
authorities on Monday, the Daily Nation newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The customs officials also scrutinized documents and made
random checks at several warehouses suspected to be storing cargo
in transit and other consignments for domestic use.
</P>
<P>
Most of the un-canceled bonds which date up to two years back
involve textiles, tires, sugar, shoes, electronics and rice --
which were said to be in transit to the neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Commissioner of Customs and Excise Samuel Chebii was
reportedly to fly to Mombasa today to monitor the crackdown
operation.
</P>
<P>
He was also expected to discuss with customs officers over how
to deal with more than 14,000 tons of sugar which is dubbed
"transit cargo" and being discharged at the Mombasa port.
</P>
<P>
Another 22,000 tons of sugar are stranded at the port because
their importers cannot meet new stringent regulations introduced
by the Kenya Revenue Authority last month to curb the diversion
of sugar in transit.
</P>
<P>
The regulation requires an importer or his agents to deposit
with the Customs a cash guarantee equivalent to the total value
of the cargo before the cargo is allowed to leave the port.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Scientists Make Progress on Bone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Israeli scientists have made
progress in explaining how the bone's various components affect
its mechanical function, according to a recent report of the
Weizmann Institute of Science.
</P>
<P>
The institute's professor Daniel Wagner, who is specializesd in
man-made composite materials, and professor Steve Weiner, an
expert on biological materials, have developed a sophisticated
mathematical model that makes it possible to predict the
mechanical properties of bone with unprecedented accuracy.
</P>
<P>
The basic building blocks of bone are tiny collagen fibers
mineralized with calcium phosphate crystals. These are organized
into arrays, which, in turn, are usually further folded into
higher-order structures, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
This complexity, coupled with the difficulty of studying such
dense material under an electron microscope, makes bone structure
exceedingly hard to figure out, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The Wagner-Weiner model consists of mathematical equations that
explain how the bone's various components, for example, how the
shape, arrangement and alignment of the tiny fibers and crystals
affect a bone's elasticity or its ability to withstand pressure
applied in a certain direction.
</P>
<P>
The model's greatest value lies in predicting correlations
between structure and function that are difficult or impossible
to measure experimentally, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The Weizmann Institute scientists hope the model may some day
help reproduce the beneficial aspects of bone structure in
man-made materials. They have also begun to applying their model
to studies ultimately aimed at improving treatments for
osteoporosis.

<HEADLINE> Jewish Settlers Rebuild Illegal Settlement Near </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Ten families of Jewish settlers
moved overnight into an illegal settlement on a hilltop near the
West Bank city of Nablus, which was evacuated by Israeli police last
week.
</P>
<P>
The settlers, who came from the nearby Yitzhar settlement in
south of Nablus, moved into tents and makeshift houses on the
hilltop, where three illegal buildings were demolished by the
police last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Israeli police set up an encampment near the hilltop to
monitor the situation and refuse to allow any building materials
to be taken there or permanent structures to be built. But they
did not intervene when more settlers moved onto the hilltop.
</P>
<P>
Four policemen and four settlers were injured last Tuesday when
about 200 policemen, army soldiers and government officials
carried out the evacuation of 30 settlers from the
hilltop. Twenty-five settlers were arrested in clashes with the
policemen when they tried to prevent the police from demolishing
the illegal houses.
</P>
<P>
The evacuation was a good gesture made by Israeli government to
the Palestinians ahead of the meeting last Tuesday between
President Ezer Weizman and Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
President Yasser Arafat and the visit by U.S. peace envoy Dennis
Ross on a mediation mission to revive the stalled peace talks.
</P>
<P>
However, the move came under strong criticism by right-wing
ministers within the government, who demanded investigation into
the police action. The powerful National Religious Party even
threatened to topple the government if police take more actions
against the settlers.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Israel's Independence Day, Deputy Housing Minister
Meir Porush visited the hilltop settlement where he planted a
pomegranate tree in an apparent show of solidarity with the
settlers.
</P>
<P>
Encouraged by the rightitst political support, Yitzhar settlers
immediately rebuilt the demolished houses and set up more tents
and makeshift houses to reoccupy the hilltop.
</P>
<P>
The dispute on settlement expansion has been the leading
obstacle in reviving the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, which
have been deadlocked since late March when Israel began building
the Har Homa settlement in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The PNA is demanding the halt to settlement expansion as a
precondition for resuming the peace negotiations.

<HEADLINE> Mombasa Port Registers Increases by Eight Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's port of Mombasa registered
about eight percent growth in total cargo handling throughput
last year, reflecting improved regional economic performance.
</P>
<P>
The amount of cargo handled at the port increased from some
7,984,000 tons in 1995 to more than 8,694,000 tons last year.
</P>
<P>
The port's outgoing Executive Chairman, Robert Breneissen, was
quoted as saying that the cargo increase at the port was mainly
attributed to the transit traffic increasing by 37.5 percent in
1996.
</P>
<P>
He noted that transit traffic had become a major component of
the port's total throughput, rising from 1.9 million tons in 1995
to 2.8 million tons last year.
</P>
<P>
Uganda remains Mombasa's main external user whose cargo rose
from about 303,000 tons in 1991 to 1.2 million tons last year
while transit cargo of Tanzania through the port increased
dramatically from 91,000 tons in 1995 to 363,000 tons last year.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the cargo handled at the port for Rwanda and Zaire
amounted to 474,000 tons and 143,000 tons respectively.
</P>
<P>
Containerized traffic also registered a significant growth
with 217,000 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEU) handled last year
as opposed to 200,000 TEUs in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Living Conditions to be Monitored in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May (Xinhua) -- Zambia's Central Statistics Office
(CSO) will from this year embark on an annual exercise of
monitoring the living conditions of Zambians throughout the
country, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The move is expected to be carried out through a living
conditions monitoring unit that was newly established in the CSO.
</P>
<P>
Zambian Minister of Information and Broadcasting Services
David Mpamba recently said that the survey of living conditions
is a necessary tool of measuring the level of development in the
country other than just using economic indicators.
</P>
<P>
Mpamba said that development of economic growth could not be
measured only by the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), inflation
rates or other economic measures which did not provide a
comprehensive picture of real development.
</P>
<P>
He stressed, "development is only when such economic growth is
accompanied by improvement in the living conditions of the people
that we can confidently say there has been national development."

<HEADLINE> Grey-Headed Gulls Abundant in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- A large number of globally
threatened grey-headed gulls has been discovered on Musanbwa
island of Uganda in Lake Victoria, reported the local daily "the
New Vision" today.
</P>
<P>
The East African National History Society Uganda branch was
quoted as saying that Uganda has more gulls on the island than
the world's estimated total.
</P>
<P>
The branch stumbled on the birds while on a countrywide survey
to identify "important bird areas of Uganda."
</P>
<P>
According to an official of the branch, the island off Sango
Bay near Tanzania has more than 100,000 gulls, compared to about
100,000 worldwide, meaning Uganda has more grey-headed gulls than
the world population.
</P>
<P>
The water birds are slightly bigger than cattle egrets and
predominantly feed on fish, the official said.
</P>
<P>
He said the biggest threat to the Musdambwa gulls is rampant
collection of eggs, along with those of little egrets which have
few known breeding sites.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Strives to Bring Down Trade Deficit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam hopes to promote exports to
reduce the trade deficit when a series of regulations encouraging
exports come into effect in June, the Vietnam News reported today.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam will continue to import advanced equipment and
machinery to boost domestic production, although the increasing
trade deficit is causing worries, the Vietnam News quoted Trade
Minister Le Van Triet as saying.
</P>
<P>
He estimated that the trade deficit this year will be 4.3
billion U.S. dollars compared to nearly four billion dollars last
year. This means that the trade deficit per month will be 358
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, official statistics show that in the first three
months of this year, the trade deficit was only 900 million
dollars, much lower than expected, thanks to a series of measures
taken by the Trade Ministry, the Vietnam News reported.
</P>
<P>
The measures included the encouragement of any form of exports,
seeking new markets and limiting imports in the form of low
payments.
</P>
<P>
The ministry estimated that the trade deficit in the second
quarter will be 1.1 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Triet affirmed that imports of advanced technology and
machinery will increase from the present 33 percent to about 45
percent by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The trade ministry said all measures must be taken to limit the
imports of commonly used goods.
</P>
<P>
The Trade Ministry hopes that the measures to be introduced in
June will help Vietnam become one of the world's major exporters.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe to Establish Tourism Revolving Fund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government plans to
establish a tourism revolving fund to provide loans to indigenous
entrepreneurs seeking to participate in the lucrative industry
currently dominated by whites or foreign companies.
</P>
<P>
Opening the Matetsi Game Lodge, 33 km west of Victoria Falls
of north Zimbabwe yesterday, President Robert Mugabe, who was
concerned by the low level participation by indigenous
entrepreneurs in the industry, said the fund was meant to make
their entry into the industry easier.
</P>
<P>
"The revolving fund will have some shares in the new project
while indigenous operators retain the option to buy out the
fund," he said.
</P>
<P>
The government wants participation of blacks in the
fast-growing tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said he was concerned about the social, economic and
environmental problems highlighted in an environment impact
assessment study undertaken by the World Conservation Union.
</P>
<P>
He urged local operators in the tourism industry to be
disciplined in their use of natural resources.

<HEADLINE> Rescue Operation Ends in East Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The rescue operation has come to an
end in the quake-stricken east Iran except in four villages, the
state-run Tehran Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
The operation to unearth the victims is continuing in the four
villages.
</P>
<P>
However, the radio and official news agency IRNA did not give
the latest death toll in the morning news program. The state
television reported 4,000 deaths Monday night.
</P>
<P>
An official from the Qaen Governor's office told Xinhua in a
telephone interview that they have buried 1,500 victims so far.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the rescue operation process is slow
because relief workers are using hands to search victims because
they can not use machines.
</P>
<P>
He said that the death toll reported by the media is just
estimation by some officials. The figure may be high or may be
low.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian headquarters in charge of natural disaster relief
work said that the rescue operation has been involved with six
helicopters, eight C-130 aircraft, 300 light and heavy
automobiles, 110 ambulances along with medical equipment.
</P>
<P>
So far more than 11,000 makeshift tents, 35,000 blankets and
100 tons of foodstuffs have been distributed among victims in
Qaen and Birjand regions.
</P>
<P>
The government called on the people to continue their support
to victims by donating plastic sheets, cooking stoves, lanterns,
portable power generators, shoes and clothing, blankets and
canned food.
</P>
<P>
The report said that 195 aftershocks have jolted the two
regions which were rocked by a powerful 7.1-degree earthquake on
Saturday noon.
</P>
<P>
The Geophysics Institute of Tehran University said that the
magnitudes of the aftershocks ranged from 3 to 5.5 degrees on the
Richter scale.
</P>
<P>
Although rescue operation has basically ended, inflow of
international assistance is pouring into Iran. France,
Switzerland, Pakistan and Kuwait have sent five planes carrying
foodstuffs and medicines for quake victims in Iran.
</P>
<P>
The Red Crescent Society of Turkey Monday sent 20 tons of
goods, comprising of sugar, medicines, blankets, cooking oil and
rice.

<HEADLINE> Yunnan Uses Foreign Funds in Afforestation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Yunnan, the "kingdom of plants" in
southwest China, has introduced World Bank loans and donated money
for the protection of forests and afforestation there.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Yunnan provincial government said that the
six Sino-foreign cooperative afforestation and forest protection
projects have brought the province a total of 400 million yuan
(nearly 50 million US dollars) of foreign and government
investment.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan has rich varieties of tropical, subtropical plants, and
nearly all major varieties of world vegetation. The province
has established more than 100 nature reserves to protect its plant
resources.
</P>
<P>
Germany, the Netherlands, Japan, New Zealand, and the World Bank
have sent scientists and officials to make investigations in the
province.
</P>
<P>
With 170 million yuan (about 21 million dollars) of investment
from the World Bank and the Ministry of Forestry, 78,000 hectares
of commercial-timber forests have built in five counties.
</P>
<P>
The province also utilized 12 million deutsche marks donated by
Germany and 31 million yuan (3.8 million dollars) in supporting
funds from the Chinese government to build 26,000 hectares of
forests in another six counties where vegetation had been
seriously damaged.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the 15 million dollars offered by the Dutch
government was used to establish organizations for protecting
tropical rain forests in Simao, Gaoligong Mountain, Tongbiguan,
and some other areas.

<HEADLINE> China to Speed up Exploration of Mineral Resources in Southwest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The "China Economic Herald"
reported that the State Planning Commission and the Ministry of
Geology and Mineral Resources have jointly drafted a plan to
intensify prospecting of mineral resources in mountainous areas
among Jinsha, Lanchang, and Nujiang rivers in southwest China.
</P>
<P>
The two ministerial organizations said in the opinion document
that they will work hard and spend five to eight years to produce
a comprehensive report about mineral resource distribution in the
mountainous areas, and will carry out mining on a fairly-large
scale, in areas where conditions permit, to advance regional
economic development.
</P>
<P>
They will also outline the geological prospecting work plan for
the Ninth Five-Year-Plan Period (1996-2000), which has been under
intense drafting at the moment, and will also list the region as
one of the key geological prospecting areas and will work out
preferential policies to advance prospecting in the forthcoming
years.
</P>
<P>
The two organizations will also cooperate closely with the
State Science and Technology Commission.
</P>
<P>
General survey of mineral resources in major areas will be
intensified and investment in similar surveys and prospecting will
be encouraged, said the opinion document.
</P>
<P>
Pre-stage planning and negotiations to explore mineral
resources in the region should also be organized in an active
way. Paid use of the rights for prospecting and mining will also
be encouraged.
</P>
<P>
Efforts should also be made to reform the management system of
geological prospecting and the mining business.
</P>
<P>
The opinion document also called on governments at various
levels to increase investment in the prospecting of mineral
resources.

<P>
SHENYANG, May 13 -- China's first 5,000-tonnage Vinyon N
production facility was put in operation in Fushun, a
petrochemical city in northeast China's Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
Vinyon N is a flame-retarded acrylic fiber that can be widely
used to produce flame-retarded fabrics, toys, and fire-proof
clothes. Only a few countries are capable of producing the fiber
for its production procedures are complex. China used to rely
solely on import to obtain the product.
</P>
<P>
China purchased the main equipment of the project from Italy,
German, Japan, and Switzerland at the cost of 550 million yuan
while using home-made supporting equipment.
</P>
<P>
After a half month of trial operation, the facility has been
proved to operate well and meet the design standards. Its products
have already been exported to a dozen of countries, including
the European Community and the United States. The facility
is expected to earn 3.5 million US dollars in hard currency a
year after full operation.

<HEADLINE> Lee Kuan Yew: Patten Breaches What London Agreed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew of
Singapore said that Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten breached what
the British agreed to in handling the Hong Kong affairs and that
incoming chief executive Tung Chee Hwa should scrap all of
Patten's reforms.
</P>
<P>
According to local newspapers today, in an interview with the
Financial Times of London, which was published Monday, Lee said,
"If I were Tung, I would adopt laws and regulations in Hong Kong
as they were pre-Patten." "Anything post-Pattern I would leave
out. It can be done simply by an omnibus clause," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Senior Minister said that he told Patten before he took
office as governor that all would be well if he kept within the
spirit and the letter of the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law.
"But he did not."
</P>
<P>
In reproducing the Financial Times article, the Straits Times
noted, "Interestingly, the FT article omitted parts of the
interview in which Mr. Lee spoke about how Governor Patten had
ignored his advice to keep within the letter and spirit of the
Joint Declaration and the Basic Law."
</P>
<P>
The paper then reproduced the part of the interview omitted by
the Financial Times, which asked Lee, "So he's (Chris Patten)
handled it wrongly?"
</P>
<P>
Lee replied, "Patten has indeed. I gave him my view that as
long as he kept within the letter and spirit of the Joint
Declaration and the Basic Law, all would be well. But he did not
... Ask Percy Craddock. He's written several articles on this.
Percy's a contemporary of mine at Cambridge. He did something most
unusual for a Foreign Office man, and so did David Wilson and
Murray Maclehose."
</P>
<P>
"Three Foreign Service officers, who reached high up the apex,
came out publicly to say that Patten was breaching what the
British agreed to. ...What better evidence? These were the British
representatives the Chinese negotiated with," he continued.
</P>
<P>
"My guess is people in Hong Kong are a pragmatic lot. They know
that they have to live with the PRC. Once that red flag with the
five yellow stars goes up and the PLA -- 10,000 of them, deployed
on ceremonial occasions -- everyone will understand that things
are different. It's no longer Chris Patten pressing flesh," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"If that is derailed then the whole of East Asia is in trouble.
We are probably not in as much trouble as Taiwan or Hong Kong who
are most dependent on China trade and investments. But every
country in Asia is investing in China," the Senior Minister noted.
</P>
<P>
"If you decide to put the screws on China, you'll be alone in
Asia, because the countries of Asia have got to live with this
gigantic mammoth," he said.
</P>
<P>
In the Financial Times article, Lee was quoted as saying that
Patten's democratic reforms and his Bill of Rights went beyond
what had been agreed with Britain in the Sino-British Joint
Declaration of 1984 and the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
"He (Mr. Tung) has to do all the unpleasant things early and
give people a clear understanding of the basis on which he will
govern," Lee said, adding, "But on political security issues, if
he does not manage Hong Kong in a way that protects China's
interests, I see a very difficult time for him and Hong Kong," he
said.

SANYA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Farm machines are helping Chinese
farmers reap good harvests in Sanya, south China's island province
of Hainan as its early rice harvest season comes due.
</P>
<P>
In the paddy fields of Tongjing Village, combines are doing a
much quicker and better job, finishing the harvesting work in less
than half a day that required two or three days if done by
hands. Combine drivers have become favorite guests in the
villages. Machine reapers also yield ten percent more grain.
</P>
<P>
Farmers in the city are competing to buy farm machinery. And
some less wealthy families plan to put their money together to buy
a reaper next year.
</P>
<P>
More than 26,000, or more than half of the households have
bought agricultural machines. Of the city's more than 50
million yuan of machinery sales to date, farmers contributed over
30 million yuan, according to the local farm machinery department.

<HEADLINE> ROUNDUP: Sri Lanka's Economic Performance in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, May 13 (Xinhua) -- In 1996, Sri Lanka's economic
growth slowed down to 3.8 percent from 5.5 percent in 1995 due to
a severe drought and rising spending on the ethnic war.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Sri Lanka's real GDP increased 3.8 percent as
agricultural and industrial activities recovered steadily from the
depressed conditions experienced in the first part of the year due
to drought and power cuts, said the Central Bank in its annual
report for 1996.
</P>
<P>
Despite this weakness, the country's open trade and payments
policy regime helped minimize output losses and prevented a
sharper increase in prices, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The GDP at market prices increased 15.1 percent to reach 13,932
million U.S. dollars. With a mid-year population of 18.315
million, this indicated a per capita nominal income level of 760
dollars in 1996. When adjusted for net foreign factor income, the
per capita national product would be 753 dollars, the report
noted.
</P>
<P>
The Gross National Product (GNP) increased 3.1 percent in real
terms in 1996. When adjusted for population growth of 1.1 percent,
the per capita real GNP increased 2 percent in 1996, compared with
the 4.5 percent the previous year.
</P>
<P>
After slowing down in the first half of the year, exports and
imports picked up during the second half. For the year as a whole
exports grew 13 percent and imports 7 percent, resulting in a
reduction of the trade deficit to 9.4 percent of GDP.
</P>
<P>
This was largely due to an improvement in tea prices as real
exports grew only 4 percent
</P>
<P>
The current account deficit of the balance of payments
declined  one percentage point to 3.9 percent of GDP in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Towards the latter part of the year, private foreign investment
recovered significantly, though relatively small compared to past
inflows.
</P>
<P>
Reflecting the higher domestic inflation and the weakening
balance of payments, the Sri Lanka rupee depreciated by about 5
percent.
</P>
<P>
In terms of per capita income, Sri Lanka has reached the
threshold of becoming a middle income developing country in the
near future.
</P>
<P>
Consumer prices as indicated by the Colombo Consumer Price
Index increased 15.9 percent, whereas the overall price level, as
indicated by GDP inflator, showed an increase of 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the liquidity over-hang from 1995, monetary
expansion remained high owing to continued high credit growth to
both government and the private sector.
</P>
<P>
The agricultural sector suffered most from the drought with the
real value added declining 4.6 percent in 1996 in contrast to an
annual growth rate of 2.4 percent during the 1991 to 1995 period.
</P>
<P>
The drought affected mainly the non-plantation agricultural
output and coconut in the plantation sector. The paddy sector
which was hard hit by the drought registered a 27 percent drop in
output while prices increased 31 percent.
</P>
<P>
Tea production after a record output the previous year rose
further 5 percent and tea prices increased 44 percent to reach
record levels.
</P>
<P>
Rubber production recorded a 6 percent increase and prices too
remained attractive. Coconut production declined 7.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Value added in mining and quarrying rose 8.9 percent compared
with 3.4 percent the previous year. Gem exports increased 16
percent.

<HEADLINE> Nepal Permits Power Export from Hydro Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali government has
permitted an Australian company to export electricity from a major
hydro power project in west Nepal, which is to become the
country's first export-oriented project to be built entirely with
foreign funds.
</P>
<P>
An agreement on the project's export authorization was signed
last week between the government and Australia's Snowy Mountain
Engineering Corp., which is now registered as West Seti Hydro
Electricity Corp., sources here said.
</P>
<P>
The signing of the authorization documents enables the West
Seti Project's Australian promoter to start negotiations with
potential electricity buyers in neighboring India, they said.
</P>
<P>
The 750-megawatt West Seti Project, with an estimated cost of 1
billion U.S. dollars, is located about 400 km west of Kathmandu
and not far from Nepal's western border with India.
</P>
<P>
The Australian company has a plan to export all the electricity
generated by the project to several State Electricity Boards of
India's northern region, which will face a power supply shortage
of 21,000 megawatts by the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the project is expected to start next year and
be completed in six years if agreements on the project's
development and operation could be reached between the government
and the Australian developer, Nepali officials said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Coal Production to Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's coal production will
increase to 86 million tons in 2000 from 54 million tons in 1996,
local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
President director of Bukit Asam Coal Company R. A. Sunardi
said here Monday that at the end of the Seventh Five-Year
Development Plan in 2004, the country's coal output will continue
to increase to 109 million tons and to 139 million tons in 2009.
</P>
<P>
Coal mining business in Indonesia was started since the Dutch
colonial period. Up to the 1970s, Indonesia produced less than
500,000 tons of coal per annum. Coal mining increased with the oil
crisis in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
Sunardi said in 1976, the government decided that coal was an
alternate energy of oil. Afterwards, coal mining in Indonesia
developed speedy and its coal production increased sharply from 2
million tons in 1985 to 54 million tons in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's potential coal reserve is estimated at 38 billion
tons, mostly in Sumatra, Kalimantan, Java, Irian Jaya and
Sulawesi.

<HEADLINE> India's Software Exports to Increase Rapidly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 13 (Xinhua) -- India's booming computer software
industry is likely to reach an export target of 3.6 billion U.S.
dollars by the year 2000, the Hindustan Times said today.
</P>
<P>
According to industry sources here, the figure can be doubled
if Indian exporters undertake a fraction of projects which
companies worldwide are offering to tackle the "year 2000 problem"
when all computer dates will register 00 unless billions of
software lines are rewritten.
</P>
<P>
The sources believe that India, with its large manpower pool
and expertise in computer software, is expected to play a
strategic and active role in helping the companies worldwide.
</P>
<P>
In the fiscal year of 1996-97, India's software exports
exceeded 1.15 billion dollars, marking a growth of 54.7 percent
over the previous year's performance.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's giant Bakun
Hydroelectric Power Plant will go into commercial operation in
August 2003.
</P>
<P>
The Bakun Hydro-Electric Corporation (BHEC) Berhad (limited)
and a consortium of underwriters today signed here an
underwriting agreement for the construction of the 13.6 billion
ringgit (about 5.44 billion U.S. dollars) hydroelectric power
plant in Sarawak, east Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
The signing was witnessed by Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad who launched the corporate logo of BHEC on the occasion.
</P>
<P>
Work on the project started last October and the plant is
scheduled to go into initial operation not later than October 31,
2002 and into commercial operation not later than August 31, 2003.
</P>
<P>
The power plant will have an installed capacity of 2,520
megawatts in Sarawak with power transmission system comprising
about 670 kilometer lines in the state and about 670 kilometer
submarine cables linked to Tenaga Nasional Bhd (TNB) (National
Power Limited)'s transmission system in Peninsular Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Ting's Ekran Berhad will hold 32 percent equity in BHEC, making
it the single largest shareholder, while the Sarawak state
government will hold 19 percent, Sarawak Electricity Supply
Corporation nine percent and TNB, the Malaysian government and the
Employees' Provident Fund will hold a five percent stake each.
</P>
<P>
Of the balance of 25 percent, 15 percent is allocated to the
Malaysian public and 10 percent to Malaysian and foreign
institutions.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Approval Rate of New Zealand Government Drops: Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The approval rate of the New
Zealand government has dropped further by 4 percent to only 14
percent six months after the formation of the new coalition
government.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the disapproval rate climbed to 75 percent, shows
the latest poll.
</P>
<P>
The poll of 1,000 people, conducted by Colmar Brunton-One
Network News, found that in the coalition, the National Party now
enjoys a popularity rate of 38 percent, while its junior partner,
NZ First, has a support rate of only 4 percent compared with the
17 percent it scored on the election night.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, support for opposition Labor Party rose to
42 percent, topping the National for the first time since 1993.
</P>
<P>
However, observers said that Labor's rise is mainly the result
of the poor performance of the government.
</P>
<P>
The poll also found that broken election promises, a lack of
integrity among some ruling MPs, and disunity between the
coalition parties, are the most common reasons for the decline of
the government's popularity.

<HEADLINE> Clash Kills 2 in West Nepal Before Local Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Two men were killed in a fatal
clash between ruling party workers and a group of ultra-leftist
guerrillas in a western Nepali village, official daily the Rising
Nepal said today.
</P>
<P>
The clash took place Sunday in the village in Rolpa district,
about 250 kilometers west of Kathmandu, when some 30 guerrillas
made a sudden attack on the workers of Prime Minister Lokendra
Bahadur Chand's National Democratic Party (RPP), who were meeting
at a teashop in connection with the coming local elections on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
One RPP worker and one member of the underground leftist
movement were killed in the clash with other four people seriously
injured, the paper quoted a district officer as saying.
</P>
<P>
As the local elections in west Nepal approaches near, the
underground leftist movement called "People's War", which earlier
called an election boycott, is reportedly beefing up its
anti-election activities including spreading death threats among
would-be candidates and carrying out bomb explosions to scare away
voters.
</P>
<P>
The underground guerrillas last week have killed three election
candidates, all from main opposition the Nepal Congress (NC)
party, in the same area.
</P>
<P>
Voters in west Nepal will elect their local administration
officers on Saturday in the first phase of the local elections,
while the polls in central and east Nepal will be held on May 26.

<HEADLINE> German Ruling Parties Vow to Push Through Key Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of Germany's two ruling
parties today vowed to brush aside the rejection from the main
opposition Social Democratic Party (SDP) and push through the
government plans to overhaul the country's tax and pension systems.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached here between Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and its Bavarian sister party
Christian Social Union (CSU) after the SDP decided earlier today
that it would not bargain with the government on pension reform.
</P>
<P>
The tax and pension reforms are among the key initiatives
proposed by the Bonn government to tackle the country's worsening
social problems, such as record high unemployment and a financial
crisis to support Germany's generous pension system.
</P>
<P>
The government and the opposition held three rounds of
negotiations on tax reform from February to April, when the talks
collapsed after both sides refused to give ground to each other.
</P>
<P>
Under its tax reform package, the government proposes to cut
Germany's top income tax rate of 53 percent to 39 percent, and
business taxes from 45 percent to 35 percent, so as to bolster
business confidence, investment and employment.
</P>
<P>
The SDP, however, has spoken in favor of keeping the top rate
intact or trimming it only modestly, a strategy meant to keep the
tax burden on the rich.
</P>
<P>
Under the pension reform proposal, the government hopes to cut
the pension of an average earner from present 70 percent of net
income to 64 percent. The SDP rejects cuts in retirement benefits,
arguing that the taxpayer should bear the burden of the scheme.
</P>
<P>
Oskar Lafontaine, the SDP's leader, announced today that his
party would weigh the pension reform through normal legislative
procedures rather than special negotiations with the government.
</P>
<P>
The government needs the SDP's support to pass any major reform
plan through the SDP-controlled upper house of parliament. Without
the SDP's prior approval, government initiatives will have to wend
their way through parliamentary committees, raising fears that
politicians and interest groups will water down the plans.

<HEADLINE> Clearance of Unexploded Bombs in Laos Makes Progress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Clearance of unexploded ordnance
(UXO) in Laos has made slow but sure progress, with work in three
provinces having been completed, according to a report from
Vientiane.
</P>
<P>
Bombs dropped on Laos between 1964 and 1973 have been reported
in 15 of the country's 17 provinces.
</P>
<P>
The unexploded bombs are killing or wounding about 200 people a
year, according to the United Nations Development Program Office
in Vientiane.
</P>
<P>
Many baseball-sized bombs are accidentally detonated by farmers
at work or children at play, causing tragedy.
</P>
<P>
Since 1973, 11,500 people have been injured, with half of them
fatally.
</P>
<P>
UXO Laos, which handles bomb clearing activities with
assistance from the UNDP, said in a report that incidents are not
expected to decrease until a major clearance effort is launched.
</P>
<P>
UXO Laos plans to complete work in two more provinces this
year.

<HEADLINE> Italy Strives to be Among the First for EMU Membership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Italy will try its best to be in the
first group to join the single European currency, Italian Prime
Minister Romano Prodi said to the French daily La Tribune today.
</P>
<P>
"Italy is determined to use all its political instruments at
its disposal" to ensure the lira joins the single currency, the
Euro, as planned in 1999, Prodi said.
</P>
<P>
Prodi said the current task for his country is to make its
European Union (EU) partners believe that the financial situation
here is stable.
</P>
<P>
The lira dropped out of the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) in a
currency crisis in 1992 and did not return to it until four years
later in November 1996. Since then it has devalued considerably.
</P>
<P>
Prodi said Italy is now launching structural spending reforms
to further cut public deficit in a bid to meet the strict 3
percent level of deficit in the gross domestic product regulated
by the Maastricht Treaty.
</P>
<P>
However, Rome's efforts failed to win the nods from its EU
partners. EU finance ministers meeting in Brussels today approved
a report on the state of Italy's finances, saying many of the
country's measures taken to cut budget deficit were not
sustainable.
</P>
<P>
When asked about Spain's and Portugal's membership of the
single currency, Prodi said it was important that the two
countries be included in the European Monetary Union (EMU).
</P>
<P>
After all, an Europe without the contribution of Latin culture
was impossible to exist, he added.

TOKYO, May 13 (Xinhua) -- United Nations Secretary-General Kofi
Annan will raise in June and July an overall plan for U.N.
financial and political reforms, Japanese newspapers said today.
</P>
<P>
Annan, who arrived here Sunday on a four-day visit, talked with
Japanese Foreign Minister Yukihiko Ikeda on Monday evening and
said the reform of the world body has reached a "crucial stage."
</P>
<P>
Ikeda urged the U.N. chief to carry out financial and political
reforms in a "well balanced" way, saying the Japanese public will
not accept boosting its contribution to the U.N. budget without
progress in reforming the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Meeting earlier in the day with Juro Saito, president of
Japan's House of Councillors, or the upper house of parliament,
Annan said there was a possibility that five more permanent seats
would be created for the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
"Japan stands a good chance" of winning one of the seats, he
was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Annan also met Japan's House of Representatives Speaker
Soichiro Ito, Defense Agency Chief Fumio Kyuma and visited Emperor
Akihito and Empress Michiko earlier in the day.

ROME, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Italy is sending aid worth about
325,700 U.S. dollars to Iran after a powerful earthquake hit the
eastern part of the country and killed thousands of people.
</P>
<P>
Italy will ferry 36 tons of medicines and other supplies by air
from Pisa, valued at 500 million Lires (295,700 dollars), Italian
Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini said in a condolences message to
his Iranian counterpart, Ali Akbar Velayati.

Italy will also donate about 30,000 dollars to the United

to Iran's appeal to the U.N. for assistance, Dini said.
</P>
<P>
"In the face of the terrible tragedy I extend sincere
condolences on behalf of the Italian government and in my own
name," Dini said.
</P>
<P>
The earthquake, measuring 7.1 on the Richter scale, jolted the
rural area in eastern Iran on Saturday, killing about 2,400 people
and injuring 40,000. It was the most disastrous earthquake in the
country since 1990.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
returned home from the Caribbean on Monday to confront the pile of
work, not the least the row with Congress over a juvenile crime
bill.
</P>
<P>
The House of Representatives passed the bill last week,
dropping a good part of Clinton's original plan, including more
funds for gang prosecutions, banning gun sales to 18-year-olds
with juvenile criminal record and requiring gun dealers to add
child safety locks to weapons.
</P>
<P>
Aides to the president said he has to negotiate with the
lawmakers to reclaim the huge portions, the Associated Press
reported.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is also scheduled to issue an apology on Friday to
eight elderly survivors of a federal study in Tuskegee, Alabama,
that monitored the effects of untreated syphilis in black men.
</P>
<P>
The experiment has been going on for 40 years without the men's
knowledge, well after penicillin became the standard treatment in
1947 for the sexually transmitted disease.
</P>
<P>
The apology precedes a major address on race by Clinton on June
14 in San Diego, one of three commencement addresses the president
will deliver over the next six weeks.
</P>
<P>
Clinton will also resume his push for national testing
standards in schools, which he described as part of his 21st
century agenda. The Congress opposes the idea and is seeking to
trim 760 federal education programs.
</P>
<P>
Aides said Clinton will stick to his standards proposal,
linking it to education proposals under the balanced budget
agreement he has struck with Congress.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Re-attaches Vital Importance to Latin America </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The recently concluded Latin
American tour by United States President Bill Clinton -- delayed
as it was -- has demonstrated the region's importance to the
world's only superpower.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's tour through Latin America was the first since he
took office in January 1993. From May 5 to 12, he visited Mexico,
Costa Rica and the Barbados to attend a summit with Central
American and Caribbean heads of state in San Jose and in
Bridgetown, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is planning to make his second tour through the region
this October when he will visit Venezuela, Brazil and Argentina.
</P>
<P>
Since the end of the Cold War, the world has been advancing
rapidly towards multipolarization. The unification of Europe and
the surge ahead of Asia have brought new challenges to the U.S.
in the international arena.
</P>
<P>
Engrossed in relations with Europe and the Asia-Pacific region
since he took up residence in the White House, Clinton had delayed
visiting Latin America, arousing a sense of indifference to the
region.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the European Union (EU) and Asia have been
turning to the huge Latin American market of nearly 500 million
potential consumers. Visits by Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto and European Union bloc leaders were among them.
</P>
<P>
What is worth mentioning is French President Jacques Chirac's
March visit to Latin America, a gesture to free the region from
U.S. control and seek economic cooperation with the EU in the area.
</P>
<P>
Within this context, Clinton made his Latin American trip to
show the extreme importance that Washington attaches to the
region's strategic position.
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, the U.S has unilaterally "certified" a
drug war against Latin American countries, intervening in their
internal affairs and hurting their national dignity.
</P>
<P>
When a new immigration law came into effect in the United
States last April, countries in the region were worried about
possible damage done to their economies by mass deportations of
Latin American immigrants living in the U.S..
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, frictions and trade disputes frequently occur
between the U.S. and countries of this region. Bilateral ties are
still tense, with Latin American nations who demand that Washington
develop relationships with the region which respect their
sovereignty and cooperate on an equal footing.

<HEADLINE> Jakarta Bans "Mega-Bintang" Banners in Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government banned
Monday banners and pictures of 'Mega-Bintang' which suggest an
alliance between deposed Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI) leader
Megawati Soekarnoputri and the United Development Party (PPP)
during the campaign.
</P>
<P>
Mega is Megawati's nickname and Bintang or star is the PPP's
symbol.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the General Election Committee Moch Yogie S.M. said
here last night that banners and slogans breached election rules
and an agreement among the three political parties contesting the
May 29 poll.
</P>
<P>
The three parties -- the ruling party Golkar, the PPP and the
PDI started their campaign on April 27. The campaign will run till
May 23.
</P>
<P>
"I declare that people are not to use those banners. We never
recognize any party but the three poll contestants," Yogie said.
</P>
<P>
Banners and yells in support of Megawati have become the
highlight of many PPP rallies since the party's branch chief
Mudrick Setiawan Sangidoe in Surakarta, central Java, met Megawati
last week to seek her blessing for many of her local loyalists who
wanted to join the PPP.
</P>
<P>
Megawati is not allowed to stand for election. But she insists
that she is the legitimate PDI chairwoman despite a
government-backed congress held in June last year that reinstated
Soerjadi at the party's helm.
</P>
<P>
The Soerjadi-led PDI faction, the PPP and the Golkar will vie
for 425 seats in the 500-seat House of Representatives in the
forthcoming election. The other 75 seats are reserved for the
military, whose members do not vote.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Attorney General Singgih also confirmed the ban. He
said election rules said that campaign banners should carry the
party's programs or themes and must be approved by police.
</P>
<P>
Armed forces chief of sociopolitical affairs Lt. Gen. Syarwan
Hamid also said the security forces would seize banners or
T-shirts and ban chants in support of the 'Mega-Bintang' alliance.
</P>
<P>
Yogie also urged the parties again to stop their illegal street
rallies.
</P>
<P>
"The street rallies are on the increase despite the ban, not
because we tolerate them doing so but because we lack the security
guards to stop them," Yogie said.
</P>
<P>
Street rallies have claimed at least 39 lives since campaigning
began on April 27, official sources said.

In San Jose, the U.S. president met with the presidents of
Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and the
Dominican Republic as well as the prime minister of Belize,
and issued the "Declaration of San Jose" at the end of this summit.
</P>
<P>
The document underscores the need to strengthen the
relationship of "friends and partners" between the United States
and the above-mentioned countries, and stipulates concrete
commitments.
</P>
<P>
At the summit in Bridgetown, Barbados, Clinton told heads of 14
member nations of the Caribbean Community, or CARICOM, that his
country will not forget the Caribbean nations in the American
integration process. They identified mutual interests of trade,
anti-drug operations and immigration.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's tour has further defined "an agenda for the American
continent vis-a-vis the upcoming century," his spokesman said.
Vital relations between the U.S. and Latin America were
re-established.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, from Latin American observers' view, both sides
differed a lot in their positions, and there were many
contradictions on issues that had to do with the sovereignty of
states and national dignity of Latin American countries.
</P>
<P>
In their opinion, relations between the U.S. and
Latin America will head down a windy path if Washington does not
radically change the gunboat diplomacy it employs in the region.

<HEADLINE> Laos Demands Halt to Sand Dredging in Border River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Laos has protested against sand
dredging along the Mekong river by Thai companies, saying that the
operations are affecting deep-water channels which serve as border
lines between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
In a note of protest sent earlier this year, the Laotian side
urged the Thai government "to impose stricter enforcement of
regulations on the dredging companies, which have shown concern
only for their own interests and never for any regulation or
bilateral ties," according to a Thai Government House source.
</P>
<P>
There are about 90 sand dredging operations in five Thai
provinces along the Mekong river, of which 75 are in the
northeastern provinces of Nong Khai and Nakhon Phanom, where the
greatest impact to the deep-water channels are reported.
</P>
<P>
The Thai Government House source said the dredging was causing
redirecting of the channels into the Thai territory and was
damaging to the river's banks.
</P>
<P>
As a result the Thai authorities have long been forced to spend
money rebuilding embankments, the source said.
</P>
<P>
The Thai Foreign Ministry has asked the Interior Ministry to
order dredging halt, but the Interior Ministry prefers to see the
problem solved locally by provincial authorities of both
countries.

<HEADLINE> World Bank to Boost Credits to Romania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank has agreed to
provide a new credit package of 625 million U.S. dollars to
Romania, the bank's president James Wolfensohn said today.
</P>
<P>
Wolfensohn, here for a three-day stay on the first visit by a
World Bank president in 20 years, told a news conference that
disbursement of 330 million dollars would occur this year.
</P>
<P>
The credit package was "a real sign of our confidence in the
country," he said, adding that the Washington-based World Bank had
been backing Romania's measures to restructure its economy.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank credits included 350 million dollars for
reforming the farm sector, 50 million dollars to underpin social
benefits and cushion the effect of rapid change, 150 million
dollars to upgrade roads, 50 million dollars for higher education
and 25 million dollars to improve water supplies.
</P>
<P>
Together with the new package, a further 80 million dollars was
likely to be approved within a week under a resumed disbursement
of an earlier loan for restructuring the country's enterprises.
</P>
<P>
All the credits have yet to be approved by the board of
directors of the bank.
</P>
<P>
Since arriving here on Sunday, Wolfensohn has met Romanian
President Emil Constantinescu and Prime Minister Victor Ciorbea
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the International Monetary Fund approved 430
million dollars credits to Romania.

BANGKOK, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The Civil Aviation Board of
Thailand Monday endorsed a 3 percent hike in air fares for all
flights leaving Thailand, according to Transport and
Communications Minister Suwat Liptapallop.
</P>
<P>
The fare increase, which will take effect immediately, follows
the call of the International Air Transport Association (IATA),
for an increase in passenger fares prompted by higher oil prices,
Suwat was quoted today by local press as saying.
</P>
<P>
Every IATA member is expected to follow suit but the extent to
which airlines raise air fares would depend on their marketing
strategy, he said.

<HEADLINE> Jakarta Not Worry About Being on U.S. Priority Watch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia should not worry about
being put on the United States' priority watch list, a senior
official said.
</P>
<P>
"Inclusion in the list is something common and should not be
feared," Coordinating Minister for Production and Distribution
Hartarto said here on Monday afternoon after a general election
campaign rally, the official Antara news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Hartarto however did not elaborate why Indonesia does not worry
about the status.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether Indonesia could do something about the listing
through lobbying, the minister said, "that is up to Tunky
(industry and trade minister)".
</P>
<P>
Tunky Ariwibowo held talks with a U.S. trade representative in
Montreal, Canada, on May 8, 1997, mainly about Indonesia's
national car policy but they also talked about the priority watch
list and GSP (generalized system of preferences).
</P>
<P>
GSP is a U.S. trade facility affecting imports from developing
countries including Indonesia. For Indonesia the facility will
expire in May 1997.
</P>
<P>
Tunky implored the U.S. not to include Indonesia again in the
priority watch list, arguing that the Indonesian government had
improved its system to protect intellectual property rights.

<HEADLINE> Albania Opposes Enlarged Multinational Force Authority </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Albanian President Sali Berisha said
today that authority of the multinational force in Albania should
not be expanded.
</P>
<P>
Berisha expressed this at his first press conference since the
country was plunged into chaos in February over the collapse of a
pyramid investment scheme which left thousands of families
penniless.
</P>
<P>
Only by maintaining neutrality could the multinational force
complete its mission in Albania, the president noted.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Security Council passed a resolution on
March 25 authorizing the dispatch of a 6,000-member, Italian-led
multinational force for three months to protect relief operations
and help restore order to Albania.
</P>
<P>
Expanding the multinational forces' authority could lead to an
unprecedentedly complicated situation, Berisha said.
</P>
<P>
On the parliamentary election scheduled for the end of June,
the president said that the election is vital for Albania and
called on all political parties to guarantee its peacefulness and
fairness.

The move came after the ministry, on the same day, received a
resignation from the ambassador, in acceptance of some
responsibility for the crisis.
</P>
<P>
"We have heard yet again Ambassador Morihisa Aoki's desire to
step down and after considering many things, we have decided to

On December 17 last year, rebels from the Tupac Amaru
Revolution Movement in Peru seized the ambassador's residence
during a party celebrating the Japan's emperor's birthday. The
rebels held 72 people for more than four months.
</P>
<P>
The crisis ended last month when Peruvian troops stormed the
residence, rescuing all but one hostage alive and killing all 14
rebels.
</P>

Morihisa Aoki has been under criticism for the failure of

BUENOS AIRES, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Argentine's Central Bank will
put into circulation two coins Tuesday to commemorate the 50th
anniversary of the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF).
</P>
<P>
The coins, with face values of one peso (about one U.S. dollar)

</P>
<P>
The one-peso coin bears the image of a girl playing with a rag

side reads "UNICEF, 50 years for the children."
</P>
<P>
On both sides there are faces of children of different races

The coin was designed by Pedro Rodriguez Dufour, an artist who

<HEADLINE> Yunnan Cane Sugar Output Tops One Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Yunnan Province
produced a record 1.06 million tons of cane sugar during the last
pressing season from December 1996 to April 1997, 230,000 tons
more than that of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
According to an official from the provincial agricultural
department, cane sugar production generated 1.8 billion yuan in
output value in the last pressing season, bringing in an average
of 450 yuan for four million local sugar cane-growing peasants
each.
</P>
<P>
The official attributed the steady production increase to
favorable geographical conditions and enhanced effort which helped
expand its sugar cane-growing areas to 160,000 ha, increasing the
province's sugarcane production from 4.78 million tons to 10
million tons in seven years.
</P>
<P>
Daily production capacity of 83 local sugar refineries
climbed in seven years from 58,000 tons to the current 103,500
tons.
</P>
<P>
By now, the province has 14 percent of the country's cane
sugar market shares.

<HEADLINE> Traffic Control System Found Effective at East Asian Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PUSAN, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Traffic across the Pusan metropolitan
area was reduced by about 15 percent since "a passenger car odds-evens
number ban system" was introduced, police sources said here on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The system resulted in a 30-minute decrease in driving time from
the athletes' village at Haeundae Beach to Kudok Stadium, the venue
for the grand ceremonies and the track and field events, the sources
said.
</P>
<P>
Citizens are only allowed to drive their private passenger cars
every other day during the Pusan East Asian Games. Cars with
even-numbered license plates are permitted to drive on even-numbered
days, and those with odd plates on odd days.
</P>
<P>
The system will remain in effect until May 19, covering the hours
of 7 o'clock in the morning to 9 o'clock in the night.
</P>
<P>
There are over 430,000 privately-owned cars in the city,
representing about half of the automobiles on the roads, the police
said.
</P>
<P>
If the license plate system is carried out successfully, it should
cause a daily 25 percent traffic reduction, they said.
</P>
<P>
However, only a 10 to 15 percent practical reduction is expected
during the Games, due to an influx of cars from around South Korea.

<HEADLINE> China Calls for More Public Service Advertisements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 13 (Xinhua) -- China has required manufacturers
and businesses that do frequent advertising through Chinese
television, radio and newspapers this year to produce at least one
public-service advertisement for media.
</P>
<P>
The State Administration for Industry and Commerce (SAIC) said
Monday that those public-service ads are required to be issued for
TV, radio and newspapers at or above provincial level.
</P>
<P>
Today's China Daily reported that advertising agencies with
leading positions in each province, autonomous region and
municipality are also asked to produce a public service
advertisement for media.
</P>
<P>
A SAIC official said that "these public-service ads will mainly
by issued by TV, radio, newspaper and pubic places in September,
a month designated by SAIC last year to help enchance social
progress and health development of the advertising industry in
China."
</P>
<P>
The official said that media agencies should issue at least one
public-service advertisement during prime-time hours, from 6 pm to
9 pm, or on major pages of newspapers.
</P>
<P>
The theme for this year's activity will focus on promotion the
spirit of the Chinese nation and its unremitting efforts to become
stronger.
</P>
<P>
Last year's month-long promotion of public-service ads -- which
focused on "traditional virtues of the Chinese nation" such as
thrift, respect for the elderly and care for children -- succeeded
in refining professional ethic on the part of people who produce
and issue advertisements.
</P>
<P>
Some 16,860 public-service ads were issued last September.

<HEADLINE> Austria to Take Time Considering Whether to Join NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Austria will decide on its own when
to consider joining the enlarged NATO and the European security
mechanism, Austrian Federal Chancellor Viktor Klima said today.
</P>
<P>
Klima, who also chairs the Social Democratic Party, said there
should not be a false impression that Austria must decide whether
to join the Western military alliance in the next few months.
</P>
<P>
"We still have enough time to observe and analyze on the
development of the European security mechanism and then make a
decision," he told a foreign policy session of his party.
</P>
<P>
Noting that entering a new bloc is not in the foreign policy of
the ruling Social Democratic Party, Klima reiterated that such a
decision must be made through a national referendum.
</P>
<P>
He said he believed that the European Monetary Union (EMU) will
be kicked off on January 1, 1999, as scheduled, and that the EMU's
delay or failure will result in serious economic setbacks.

<HEADLINE> Dalian Free Trade Zone Opens Wider to Foreigners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Dalian Mayor Bo Xilai is urging
foreign investors not to ignore the huge market in northeast China.
</P>
<P>
There is a huge market in northeast China and along the
Bohai Bay, today's "China Daily" quoted Bo as saying.
</P>
<P>
As the most open city in this region, Dalian will actively turn
the Free Trade Zone into a key area for consolidating co-operation
with foreign investors this year, Bo said at a symposium on the
investment environment of the Dalian Free Trade Zone held in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Started in 1992, the zone has developed into a special economic
area with commerce, processing, industry and storage as its
pillars.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1996, an accumulated 1,200 projects had been
founded in the zone, with contractual investments of 1.35 billion
US dollars. Of them, almost half are foreign-funded projects,
binding pledged foreign capital of 450 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Businesses from 25 nations and regions so far have established
offices in the zone.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Lihua, director of the Administrative Committee of the
Free Trade Zone, said foreign investors enjoy preferences in the
zone ranging from tax-exemption for capital goods imports to a
free settlement system for foreign currencies.
</P>
<P>
Dalian expects to build the zone into an export processing base
and an import and export commodities distribution center in the
northeast Asian region within five years, he added.

<P>
BUENOS AIRES, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The 31st general meeting of
the Inter-American Center of Tax Administrators was opened here
today to find ways to ensure efficient taxation.
</P>
<P>
About 280 experts from across America will analyze the

management of human resources, and upgrading information systems and
legal faculties to collect tax arrears.
</P>
<P>
Opening the meeting, Argentine President Carlos Menem said that
tax evasion "is one of the worst crimes," and the fulfillment of
tax obligations, "a form of exercising one's right to vote."
</P>
<P>
While emphasizing the importance of a sound and efficient tax
management, which he said enables the state to provide essential
services, he thanked Argentine tax workers for collecting record
taxes in the past few months.
</P>
<P>
Menem urged the experts to put forth new proposals to help fair
and just taxation.

<P>
BEIJING, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The Standard Charted Bank of the
United Kingdom has offered five million US dollars in working
capital loans to China Golden Valley International Trust and
Investment Corp, today's "China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, signed yesterday in Beijing, the Standard
Charted Bank will grant the loans with an interest rate that is
only 0.3 percent higher over the London Interbank Offered Rate.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing-based newspaper quotes Ni Ying, a staff of the
International Business Department of Golden Valley as saying that
the money is expected to be used to support the import and export
business of the firm's customers in coastal areas.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Chunlong, marketing manager of the Standard Chartered
Bank's operations in North China, said it is unusual for the bank
to lend loans of such a large amount to financial firms.
</P>
<P>
So far, the Standard Charted Bank has set up seven branch banks
and eight representative offices in China, topping all
overseas-invested banks in this regard.
</P>
<P>
It has been approved to open local currency services in the
Shanghai Pudong New Area, and the operation is expected to begin
in June, the paper said.

<HEADLINE> Thai PM to Urge Yangon to Certify Illegal Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Chavalit
Yongchaiyudh will urge Yangon to certify the citizenship of
Myanmar working illegally in Thailand, a step that will facilitate
the legalization of their working status in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The proposal was discussed Monday during a meeting between
government officials and the National Security Council (NSC),
chaired by Chavalit Yongchaiyudh.
</P>
<P>
It will be among the key topics of discussion with Myanmar's
leaders, when Chavalit visits Myanmar this Friday and Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"We do our part in registering them and give them two years to
work in Thailand. But once the registration takes place, Myanmar
will have to certify their citizenship so as to make the
legalization of their working (here) become effective," NSC chief
Bunsak was quoted today by local press as saying.
</P>
<P>
A temporary measure giving two-year concessionary work permit
to illegal foreign workers from the neighboring countries of
Myanmar, Laos and Cambodia allowing them to work in Thailand's 43
provinces has failed to meet its objectives to control their
movement.
</P>
<P>
During his forthcoming visit, Chavalit will also urge his
Myanmar counterpart to move towards introducing convertible
currency to remove foreign exchange risks for Thai traders.
</P>
<P>
Thai traders have complained about the foreign exchange risk
because they have to deal with double currency exchange rates: an
official rate of six kyat, and the more realistic rate of 170 kyat
per dollar, according to Virachai Techavichit, an adviser to the
prime minister.

<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma and
his visiting Belarusian counterpart, Alexander Lukashenko, signed
a treaty today on border divisions, along with other 10 agreements.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma told the press after the signing ceremony that the two
countries, which shared a border of 1,200 kilometers, had been
cooperative while negotiating the border issues.
</P>
<P>
Both countries believed that the agreements, the first such
accords ever signed between the countries of the Commonwealth of
Independent States, would pave the way for broader cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The other agreements concerned promoting border trade, and
diminishing the consequences of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster,
both in Ukraine and Belarus.
</P>
<P>
Lukashenko said that both sides should get rid of trade
barriers in order to boost bilateral trade. Trade volume between
Ukraine and Belarus exceeded one billion U.S. dollars in 1996,
with a trade surplus on the Ukrainian side of 400 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Lukashenko, who had met with Ukrainian Prime Minister Pavlo
Lazarenko earlier on Monday, is expected to meet with parliament
speaker Alexander Moroz on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Macedonia to Promote Relations With Greece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov
said Monday in Skoplje that the time is ripe for Macedonia and
Greece to promote relations, according to a report from Skoplje.
</P>
<P>
"It is time for Macedonia and Greece to establish genuine and
sincere relations," as they share "the same strategic goals," said
Gligorov while meeting a Greek press delegation.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the disputes between the two countries over the
name of Macedonia, Gligorov said the Republic of Macedonia is
quite different from the geographic conception of historic
Macedonia, with the former being a concrete country having its own
borders, culture and constitution. It is not reasonable to change
the name, the president said.
</P>
<P>
Macedonia and Greece have held differences over Macedonia's
right to use the name since 1991 when Macedonia declared
independence from the former Yugoslav federation. The United
Nations recognized it under the provisional name of the Former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia pending a settlement.
</P>
<P>
Greece views that it is not right to name the country
"Macedonia", because it implies its territorial designs on the
northern Greek province of the same name.

<HEADLINE> Bird Returns Home as Indiana's Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW RORK, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Larry Bird was back home Monday to
take over as coach of the Indiana Pacers, the team of NBA that
passed on a chance to draft him in 1978.
</P>
<P>
This is the first coaching job for Bird, a 12-time National
Basketball Association All-Star with the Boston Celtics. It is
also the first time the Pacers have picked someone with no
coaching experience. a report said.
</P>
<P>
"I'm very happy to be back home and have an opportunity like
this to come to my home state ... and hopefully try to get to the
finals like I was few times," Bird was quoted as saying at a news
conference at Market Square Arena of Indianapolis on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Everybody asks me why do I want to do this," said Bird, who
reached a multi-year agreement with the Pacers last
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"I've always been competitive and I've been laying around for
five years. I found that 35 was too young to retire. And this is
my home state."
</P>
<P>
The 40-year-old Bird ends a long, glorious relationship with
the Boston Celtics and replaces Larry Brown, who resigned last
week and later was named coach of the Philadelphia 76ers. The
Celtics named Rick Pitino as their head coach last week.
</P>
<P>
Terms were not disclosed, but various reports put Bird's salary
at 4 million U.S. dollars per year, with options ranging from
entering the front office to partial ownership.
</P>
<P>
Bird was born in West Baden, Indiana, and was raised in French
Lick. He attended Indiana University, briefly, and then Indiana
State. He led the Sycamores to the 1979 NCAA title game, where
they lost to Magic Johnson and Michigan State.
</P>
<P>
Bird won a Rookie of the Year award, three Most Valuable Player
Awards and three NBA titles in 13 years with the Celtics before
chronic back pain forced him to retire in 1992. He joined the
Boston front office as a special assistant shortly thereafter.
</P>
<P>
Brown left Bird a pretty good starting team even though the
Pacers, hit hard by injuries, finished just 39-43 and missed the
playoffs for the first time since 1989.
</P>
<P>
The team features scorers in guard Reggie Miller and center Rik
Smits and has hardworking, productive forwards in Dale and Antonio
Davis. Point guard Mark Jackson, re-acquired in February, led the
NBA in assists.

<P>
MANILA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Two opposition parties, one of them
the biggest one in the Philippines, have moved a step closer to
merge for the 1998 presidential elections by agreeing to speak in
one voice on vital issues.
</P>

particularly the administration-backed efforts to lift or extend
the term limit for President Fidel Ramos by amending the
Constitution, Laban Chairman Edgardo Angara said.
</P>
<P>
Angara said the two parties had formed a joint committee to
oversee their common advocacy agenda which would focus on good
government.

<HEADLINE> Embryo Transplant Technique Successful in East China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The Zhejiang Provincial Academy of
Agricultural Sciences has successfully bred two calves, one male
and the other female, by using an embryo transplantation technique.
</P>
<P>
The accuracy rate of the sex identification is 100 percent, the
first of its kind in the province, a spokesman for the academy
said.
</P>
<P>
The technique involves defrosting a frozen embryo and
cultivating it in-vitro before transplanting into the womb of a
cow or sheep.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Zhejiang Provincial Academy of Agricultural
Sciences defrosted the embryos of seven quality cattle and then
transplanted them into seven cows. As a result, four cows were
fertilized and two made deliveries this March.
</P>
<P>
The technique will accelerate the breeding of quality domestic
animals, according to Yu Songdong, an assistant researcher of the
academy, explaining that ordinary domestic animals will be able to
be used to breed quality ones in larger numbers, and the breeding
cycle of the quality species will be greatly shortened, too.

<HEADLINE> HK PLC Invites Public Opinions Over Two Draft Bills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The Secretariat of the
Provisional Legislative Council (PLC) of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR) Monday invited members of the public
and interested groups to voice their views on the National Flag
and National Emblem Bill and the Regional Flag and Regional Emblem
Bill.
</P>
<P>
The two draft bills were tabled to the May 3 meeting of the PLC
for first and second readings, and then debate was adjoined and a
Bills Committee, chaired by legislator Ho Sai-chu, was formed to
study the bills.
</P>
<P>
The National Flag and National Emblem Bill seeks to adopt, by
means of local legislation, relevant provisions of the 1990 Law on
the National Flag of China and the 1991 Law on the National Emblem
of China in the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
Provisions prohibiting disrespectful acts to the national flag
and national emblem and restricting the occasions on which the
national flag and the national emblem may be displayed are
included in the bill.
</P>
<P>
The Regional Flag and Regional Emblem Bill adopts the
provisions in the Provisional arrangements on the Use of the
Regional Flag and the Regional Emblem of the HKSAR endorsed by the
Preparatory Committee for the HKSAR in August 1996.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release by the Secretariat located in

<HEADLINE> Background: ABCs of Basic Law of Hong Kong SAR (79-80) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Following are the ABCs of the Basic
Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (79-80) in a
question-and-answer format:
</P>
<P>
Question: How will government-involved contracts straddling
1997 become valid after 1997?
</P>
<P>
Answer: Contracts in Hong Kong can be divided into two main
categories.
</P>
<P>
1) Ordinary commercial contracts, civil contracts and ordinary
land leases approved before 1997.
</P>
<P>
2) Contracts that straddle 1997 and involve the
responsibilities, rights, interests and obligations of the Hong
Kong SAR.
</P>
<P>
The first category of contracts will be recognized after 1997
as long as they do not contravene the Basic Law, whereas the
second category of contracts will not be valid unless an agreement
is reached on their validity after consultations between the
Chinese and British sides.
</P>
<P>
For example, Annex 2 of the Sino-British Joint Declaration says
that one of the functions of the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group
is "to discuss matters relating to the smooth transfer of
government in 1997," that, in the latter half of the transitional
period, "there will be need for closer cooperation" between the
Chinese and British governments, and that "matters for
consideration" during this period "shall include procedures to be
adopted for the smooth transition in 1997."
</P>
<P>
In the Memorandum of Understanding Concerning the Construction
of the New Airport in Hong Kong and Related Questions, the Chinese
and British governments agreed that, on important matters relating
to projects of the airport that straddle June 30, 1997, the two
governments will engage in consultations in the spirit of
cooperation and in accordance with the Joint Declaration.
</P>
<P>
The memorandum specifically states that the British side will
consult the Chinese side through the Airport Committee before the
British Hong Kong government grants major airport-related
franchises or contracts, or guarantees for airport-related debt,
that extend beyond June 30, 1997.
</P>
<P>
With regard to government-involved contracts resulting from
previous laws that contravene the Basic Law, loan contracts signed
by the British Hong Kong government without approval of the
Sino-British Joint Liaison Group, or franchises that have been
unilaterally granted by the British Hong Kong government and that
will harm the interests of the Hong Kong SAR, they will be either
revised or canceled after 1997 in accordance with procedures as
stipulated in the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
Question: Will social organizations and individuals be
permitted to establish schools?
</P>
<P>
Answer: Schools operated by social organizations and
individuals are an important part of Hong Kong's educational
system and have played an irreplaceable role in the development of
educational undertakings there.
</P>
<P>
According to the Basic Law, the educational system and its
operational methods will remain unchanged after 1997, and
community organizations and individuals may, in accordance with
law, operate various types of educational undertakings in the Hong
Kong SAR.
</P>
<P>
This will be highly beneficial to the development of education
in the Hong Kong SAR.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Major European stock markets
sustained their recent rally today, with both London and Frankfurt
hitting record closing highs and Paris surging more than 2
percent, supported by the Dow's strong rally.
</P>
<P>
The record-breaking run of the FTSE 100 index on the London
market continued today, buoyed by shock merger news in the UK and
another strong performance on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
The index hit a seventh successive record close, rising 38.7
points or 0.84 percent to 4,669.6, having hit a day's low of 4,622

merger between Britain's two drinks giants Grand Metropolitan and
Guinness sent both companies' shares soaring.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, German shares came back from session highs, but
remained well supported as strong bonds offset the sharply weaker
dollar. The DAX-30 index finished the session up 12.96 points to
stand at 3,575.37, breaching the previous record closing high of
3,568.28 set last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
On the Paris bourse, French shares tracked a positive showing
on Wall Street. Opinion polls showing a swing to the ruling
center-right parties in the upcoming election also boosted market
sentiment, with the CAC-40 index closing up 59.18 points at
2,693.09.

<HEADLINE> Germany's Leica Camera Hit by Slow-Up in Earnings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Germany's prestige camera producer
Leica Camera AG has been hit by a 7.4 percent drop in operating
earnings in the 1996-1997 business year, mainly due to slow
deliveries of new products in domestic markets, the company said
today.
</P>
<P>
According to Dieter Hofmann, the company's chairman of the
board, Leica's operating profits for 1996-1997 were 15.2 million
German marks, or about 9.1 million U.S. dollars. However, the
company had managed to achieved its sales target with a 10.7
percent rise in turnover to 265.6 million marks, or 159.2 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
In parallel to sharp rises in turnover in Asia and the United
States, 41 percent and 47 percent respectively, Leica's sales
dropped by 6 percent in the domestic markets.

<HEADLINE> US Dollar Slides Below 120 yen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar tumbled below 120
yen for the first time in nearly four months in New York today,
but it partly recovered and rallied against European currencies.
</P>
<P>
Supportive comments by senior Japanese officials, severe mark
weakness against the yen and the pound, and strong rallies in the
U.S. stock and bond markets combined to help the dollar recoup
somewhat from its worst extended retreat in more than 18 months,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
The dollar fell as low as 117.50 yen in Asian dealings, the
lowest since January 22, before rebounding to settle in New York
at 119.30 yen, down from 120.35 yen Friday. The dollar settled at
1.7064 marks, up from 1.6869. The pound cost 1.6184 U.S. dollars,
down from 1.6205 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Last month finance ministers of the G-7 suggested they would
intervene to restrain the dollar from rising further against the
yen and mark.
</P>
<P>
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Friday:
1.4385 Swiss francs, up from 1.4235; 5.7530 French francs, up from
5.6875; 1,691.00 Italian lire, up from 1,670.75; 1.3895 Canadian
dollars, down from 1.3923.

<HEADLINE> US Commander Checks Russian Missile Launch Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Army General George
Joulwan, commander of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO), today said that he is checking a report that recent
malfunctions have switched Russia's nuclear missiles to "combat
mode."
</P>
<P>
The Washington Times today reported that classified information
of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) indicated that
malfunctions have switched Russia's nuclear missiles
"spontaneously to combat mode."
</P>
<P>
Answering questions on the report, Joulwan told reporters here.
"Reports we have seen up to this date have been that the nuclear
warheads have been properly cared for."
</P>
<P>
"But this brings another bit of information and we are going to
assess that and look into it," Joulwan added.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that NATO has been watching with some concern the
storage of nuclear warheads in Russia and "we have positive
feedback that it's been done correctly."
</P>
<P>
Also today, a senior Pentagon official said at the Pentagon
that he saw no new risk of accidental or unauthorized launch of
Russian nuclear missiles against the United States.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters on condition of anonymity, the official
said that there is no reason "to believe that there is a
heightened risk of unauthorized or accidental launch of Russian
nuclear missiles."
</P>
<P>
"I can tell you that I have seen nothing that indicates that
any sort of an incident occurred," the official said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. officials made the remarks on the eve of a two-day
visit to Washington by Russian Defense Minister Igor Rodionov.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Rodionov is scheduled to meet with top U.S.
officials on bilateral military ties and security in Europe and
the western Pacific.
</P>
<P>
Rodionov will hold separate talks Tuesday with Defense
Secretary William Cohen and White House National Security Adviser
Samuel (Sandy) Berger, and meets Wednesday with Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright before departing for Hawaii and Japan.
</P>
<P>
The talks will focus on increased U.S.-Russian military
cooperation, but also include NATO enlargement, European security
and the situation in the Pacific rim, the Pentagon official said.
</P>
<P>
Trip will be Rodionov's first to the U.S. as defense minister
and he would meet Cohen for the first time.

<HEADLINE> US Reduces Embassy Staff in Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The United States has reduced
its staff at the embassy in Kinshasa as Zairian rebel forces are
poised to attack the capital of Zaire, the State Department
said today.
</P>
<P>
It also said rumors are circulating that the Zairian government
forces would begin to attack expatriates as a way to draw foreign
troops into the fray.
</P>
<P>
In announcing the partial evacuation at a briefing, State
Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said the further reduction of
the staff came as "the situation is too precarious, too unstable
for them to stay."
</P>
<P>
Besides the uncertainty in the situation, Burns said, there
were rumors that the Zairian government forces had been ordered to
target expatriates in an attempt to trigger foreign military
intervention, which he said caused the most concern.
</P>
<P>
Most of the 12 Americans who departed went to neighboring Congo
by ferry or took flights to Europe or to other African capitals.
</P>
<P>
A total of 325 Americans who do not work for the U.S.
government remain in Zaire, down from about 400 a week ago.
</P>
<P>
Burns reaffirmed the State Department view that all such
Americans should leave the country as "the transfer of power is
going to happen one way or the other" with the rebel forces on the
march toward Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Navy Cmdr. Bob Anderson said Sunday that Americans began
finalizing their evacuation plans last week and U.S. soldiers and
helicopter gunships have been poised for weeks to evacuate them
from Zaire.
</P>
<P>
South Africa and the United States have so far unsuccessfully
attempted to broker a compromise between Zairian President Mobutu
Sese Seko and rebel leader Lauren Kabila over a proposed
transition period with resignation of the president, leading to
national elections.
</P>
<P>
Kabila has rejected the idea, insisting the power be handed
over directly to him. But he agreed to hold another meeting with
the president some days later.
