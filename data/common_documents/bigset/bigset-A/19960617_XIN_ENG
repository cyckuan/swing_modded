<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe to Celebrate Africa Refugee Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe has made elaborate plans
to commemorate the Africa Refugee Day which falls on June 20 in
remembrance of the displaced people on the continent.
</P>
<P>
The UN High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) Office in Harare
said on Sunday the commemoration would be in the form of
processions in the capital, a display by the drum majorettes, the
presentation of quiz prizes and a raffle, among other events.
</P>
<P>
Up to 1985 Zimbabwe had been home to 241,000 Mozambican
refugees, who had since been voluntarily repatriated to their
home country following the signing of a peace accord in 1992
which ended 16 years of civil war.
</P>
<P>
Africa, with 6.7 million refugees, is the continent with the
highest number of displaced people, either through civil strife
or hunger.
</P>
<P>
The civil war in Rwanda has sent more than 1.7 million people
into exile in neighbouring countries, while simmering ethnic
conflict in Burundi has sent 120,000 refugees to Zaire and 94,000
to Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Renewed fighting which broke out in Liberia in May this year
has put on hold the repatriation of 750,000 refugees.
</P>
<P>
And fighting in southern Sudan has prompted an outflow of
367,000 refugees.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in the next two years UNHCR would repatriate
300,000 Angolan refugees. And refugees from Togo, Mali, Eriteria,
Ethiopia and Somalia are returning home.
</P>
<P>
The theme for the commemoration this year is ''save the
environment to safeguard asylum''.
</P>
<P>
UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Sadako Ogata said, ''the
UNHCR has been making an effort to address environmental problems
in communities hosting refugees.
</P>
<P>
''Programs are in place to educate both the local communities
and the refugees to understand the importance of preventing
damage to the environment,'' said the commissioner. enditem

<HEADLINE> Peres Sums up his Four-year Office as Revolutionary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Outgoing Prime Minister Shimon
Peres, in a farewell address made today, summed up his four-year
office as "four revolutionary years" of peace and achievements.
</P>
<P>
Peres, chairing perhaps his last weekly cabinet meeting, said
that the current government has presided over "a historic period
for the Jewish people."
</P>
<P>
"Four years is not a lot of time, but four years can be four
revolutionary years," said Peres, who served as Foreign Minister
for over three years before he succeeded former Premier Yitzhak
Rabin who was assassinated last November.
</P>
<P>
"I have never been in a government which serves its people in
all areas with such dedication and responsibility," he said.
</P>
<P>
Peres noted that his Labor government is "rich in
revolutionary achievements," firstly in the area of peace.
</P>
<P>
He said that Israel's international stand "has already changed
beyond recognition" during the past four years, adding that the
peace process championed by his government will reap further
benefits for Israeli people.
</P>
<P>
Under the leadership of Rabin and Peres, two chief architects
of the ongoing Middle East peace process, Israel has signed a
peace treaty with the Jordanians, made peace with the Palestinians
and boosted the reconciliation process with other Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
The peace policies of the Labor government has received high
praises in the international community and borne fruits by
attracting a huge flow of foreign investments.
</P>
<P>
Peres singled out the Ministers of Finance, Trade, Agriculture
and Tourism to thank for their outstanding work and contributions
to the government and the country.
</P>
<P>
Peres, who is also Defense Minister, praised Israel's army for
its role in protecting the country, but he went on to caution
that the army "have to deal with a number of completely new issues
in complicating circumstances and without any other examples to
learn from."
</P>
<P>
He said Israeli army must deal with what he called "the
greatest danger of non-conventional and biological weapons."
</P>
<P>
Mentioning his defeat by Likud challenger Benyamin Netanyahu
in May 29 elections with less than one percent, Peres
indicated that terrorism is a major reason for his loss.
</P>
<P>
A spate of terrorist suicide bombings from late February to
early March killed over 58 people inside Israel and erased Peres'
original double-digit lead in opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
Peres will remain Prime Minister until Netanyahu's new
government passes the confidence vote in the Knesset that is
expected to take place on Monday.

<P>
HONG KONG, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Asian champions China scored a
95-76 come-from-behind victory over defending champions the Energy
team of Hong Kong at the Seventh Super Henderson Cup Invitational
Men's Basketball Championship here this evening.
</P>
<P>
The Energy team led the first half 55-42.
</P>
<P>
In the tournament's opening match here yesterday, China beat
South Korean 109-84.
</P>
<P>
In the other match this evening, the Ukrainian national team,
competing in the seven-day event in the name of Frankwell Team of
Hong Kong, beat South Korea 99-73.
</P>
<P>
The Energy team was represented by American players, recruited
either from the United States or from the local clubs. With better
physics and individual skills, Frankwell pulled away after they
and the Chinese side tied at 26-26 after 12 minutes into play in
the first half.
</P>
<P>
But the Asian champions came back strongly in the second half,
with play switched into fast counter-attacks. The Frankwell
players could only made four points within the first seven minutes
of the half while the Chinese scored 17 points for a 59-59 tie.
</P>
<P>
And from then on, the Chinese team found their form steadily,
scoring either from three-pointers or make-up shots. The Americans
desperately put up a defense but, after failing to stop the
Chinese offensives, made one unforced mistake after another,
letting more and more chances for the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Tomorrow evening will see more preliminary actions of the
tournament. Seapower will face Frankwell and Energy will take on
South Korea.
</P>
<P>
The championship closes on this weekend.

<HEADLINE> Irish PM: Dublin to Review Relations With Sinn Fein </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The Irish government is to review
its relations with Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish
Republican Army (IRA), in the wake of Saturday's terrorist car
bomb explosion in Manchester.
</P>
<P>
Irish Prime Minister John Bruton was quoted by BBC television
as saying earlier today, "We are having to review very seriously
and fundamentally our relationship with Sinn Fein and the
Republican Movement as a whole in the light of what has happened."
</P>
<P>
A car bomb exploded in the city center of the northern English
city of Manchester Saturday, injuring a total of over 200 people
and four of them seriously.
</P>
<P>
"What has happened now is far more than mere discouragement.
This is a slap in the face to the people who have been trying,
perhaps against their better instincts, to give Sinn Fein a chance
to show that they could persuade the IRA to reinstate the
cease-fire," Bruton said.
</P>
<P>
Irish Deputy Prime Minister Dick Spring reportedly said that
some elements within Sinn Fein and the Republican Movement were
resisting moves towards peace.
</P>
<P>
"We really don't know who we're actually dealing with," Spring
told BBC television.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister John Major Saturday blamed the IRA for
the bombing and demanded that Sinn Fein put pressure on its
guerilla allies to reinstate a cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
The British government has repeatedly made it clear that Sinn
Fein should not be allowed to attend the on-going all-party tallks
on the future of Northern Ireland until the IRA declares a
cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
The IRA broke the 18-month-old cease-fire in February by
launching a series of bomb attacks in London.

</P>
<P>
All of Swaziland's schools were closed on Friday as teachers
extended Thursday's one-day strike to an indefinite sit-in,
demanding for an 18 percent salary increase by the government and
political reform.
</P>
<P>
The acting prime minister emphasized the need for peaceful
transition in Swaziland.
</P>
<P>
He said the current system of government was chosen by the
Swazi people, and "will be changed only by the will of the
people."
</P>
<P>
"Any reform will be determined in the forthcoming
constitutional forum announced by King Mswati III, and I
therefore call on the people of Swaziland to move forward in
unity and play their part in this process which is so vital to
the future of the kingdom," he added.
</P>
<P>
"It is through this process," Nxumalo said, "that the Swazi
people will chart our new course and provide the new mandate for
the democratic future of Swaziland."
</P>
<P>
On the teachers' strike, he said: "Let us rather talk. I
welcome dialogue, rather than negative and counter-productive
action."
</P>
<P>
He said, efforts by a few to impose their will on the majority
will not be accepted or tolerated by the people.
</P>
<P>
Nxumalo warned any turmoil resulting from such action could
erode the investment.

<HEADLINE> AL Chief Calls for Setting up Supervising </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Arab League Secretary General Esmat
Abdul-Meguid has called for forming a committee charged with
supervising the implementation of the resolutions to be passed at
the Arab summit scheduled for June 21-23 in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
The committee will be composed of some member states of the
Cairo-based Arab League, Abdul-Meguid was quoted as saying in an
interview with Egypt's weekly magazine Rosel Youssef.
</P>
<P>
The Arab League General Secretariat should be entrusted to hold
an extraordinary session of Arab foreign ministers to follow up
the implementation of the summit's resolutions, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the collective and immediate Arab response to the
call for the convocation of the summit reflects the dangers and
challenges facing the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Syrian President Hafez
al-Assad and Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia called for the
summit after their two-day meeting in Damascus, Syria, on June
7-8.
</P>
<P>
Most Arab states have welcomed the pan-Arab summit to be held
for the first time in six years. Twenty-one of the Arab League's
22 members will attend the three-day summit.
</P>
<P>
Iraq, whose invasion of Kuwait in 1990 split the Arab world,
was the only Arab League member which was not invited to
participate.
</P>
<P>
In the interview carried by the Egyptian Middle East News
Agency today, Abdul-Meguid denied that the summit was called for
in response to the election of ring-wing Likud leader Benjamin
Netanyahu as Israel's prime minister.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Israeli elections are an internal affair of
the Jewish state, noting that the call for convening the summit
reflected an Arab desire to continue the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Cairo summit is aimed at closing Arab ranks and forging a
united Arab front to continue the peace process based on the
principle of land-for-peace, Arab sources said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said today that
Egypt is continuing its intensive contacts with other Arab
countries to prepare for the summit.
</P>
<P>
The summit's agenda will be endorsed during a meeting of Arab
foreign ministers to be held Friday morning, said Moussa.
</P>
<P>
However, the final agenda will be ratified by Arab leaders at
the beginning of their summit, he said.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Concerned Over Low Turnout, Zyuganov Looks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
expresses concern ove a low turnout in today's presidential
elections, while his main rival, Communist Party leader Gennady
Zyuganov, sees the ongoing polls as fair.
</P>
<P>
Vyacheslav Nikonov, chief analyst of the all-Russia movement
for the support of Yeltsin, told a news briefing this evening that
both Yeltsin and Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin had expressed
concern over the low turnout in the polls.
</P>
<P>
The low turnout might "create problems for the incumbent
president," Nikonov explained, noting that the turnout across the
country was substantially lower than in the parliamentary
elections last December.
</P>
<P>
According to him, pre-election opinion polls had predicted a
higher turnout. They forecast that 70 percent of the voters would
take part. However, the real figures are lower.
</P>
<P>
He related the sluggish voting to the fair weather and the
carelessness of Yeltsin's supporters, who are exceedingly sure of
his victory. Backers of other contenders decided not to come out
because they thought that their candidates would not win the
necessary number of votes, he added.
</P>
<P>
The analyst called on the mass media to use all available
methods for the improvement of turnout, declaring alarm about
Russia's fates.
</P>
<P>
However, "the Russian presidential elections may be considered
valid," Dmitry Oreshkin, analyst of the Federal Center of
Informatization, said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 56,526,957 voters, which was more than 50 percent of
the electorate, had participated in the polls by 18:00 Moscow time
(1400 GMT), he said, adding that the number of voters seemed to
have increased since then.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news briefing here, Zyuganov said, "The elections
are so far going on successfully and satisfactorily, there are
some drawbacks, but there are no serious irregularities."
</P>
<P>
Violations usually take place during the vote counting, he
said, adding that 200,000 observers of his party had been
instructed to strictly stick to the election law.
</P>
<P>
Zyuganov assured that "no unrests are expected and there may
not be from his supporters after the election." "We are the most
law-abiding people," he added.

TEHRAN, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Foreign Ministry today
summoned British Charge d'Affaires to Tehran Jeffrey James to
inform him of Iran's protest against a British ambassador's
statements on Iran's role in the region.
</P>
<P>
Iran's official news agency IRNA reported that the British
charge d'affaires was told that the Islamic Republic had never
interfered in the internal affairs of other countries.
</P>
<P>
Media reports said the British ambassador to Saudi Arabia,
Andrew Green, said last week that "we have to stay alert to
Iranian movements in the region ... we condemn the Iranian
interference."
</P>
<P>
Among other things, Green also said that Iran might be
involved in the violence in Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry stated that Iran had consistently
advocated peace and security in the Persian Gulf as the most
important element guaranteeing best protection of Iran's own
interests.
</P>
<P>
The ministry told the British charge d'affaires that such
unfounded remarks as had been made by the British ambassador in
Riyadh would simply foment tension in the region rather than serve
to resolve the problems.

CAIRO, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Western oil companies are now
preparing for sending representatives to Amman, Jordan for
consultations with officials of Iraq's state-run oil marketing
organization over the first Iraqi oil sales for about six months.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's Middle East News Agency (MENA) today quoted diplomatic
sources in Baghdad as saying that the first round of preparatory
discussions between the Iraqi oil officials and representatives of
a large number of international oil companies is drawing to a
close.
</P>
<P>
But the sources did not give the names of the western
companies.
</P>
<P>
A flurry of meetings were held in Paris over the past few days
over the tentative amounts of oil the companies could buy after
the signing of an oil-for-food agreement between Iraq and the
United Nations last month.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Iraq is allowed to sell 2 billion
U.S. dollars worth of oil for an initial 180-day period to buy
food and medicine for its people.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been under a U.N. embargo since August 1990 for its
invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
MENA said that Iraqi Oil Minister Amer Rasheed, during a visit
to Paris last week, held contacts with some 50 companies in this
respect.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin Meets with Barshefsky </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin said
here today that the history of Sino-US relations has shown time
and again that dialogue is better than confrontation, and
mutually-beneficial cooperation better than sanctions.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks in meeting tonight with Charlene
Barshefsky, acting US trade representative, who has been here to
negotiate a settlement of disputes on intellectual property rights
with Chinese counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that China has always advocated that differences
between the two countries should be resolved through consultations
on the basis of equality and in a constructive spirit.
</P>
<P>
"As long as China and the US proceed from the overall interests
of their relations, respect each other, refrain from interfering
in each other's internal affairs, and seek consultations on equal
footing, specific problems in bilateral ties can be resolved
properly," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang reiterated that the Chinese government attaches
importance to Sino-US relations, saying "We always hold that China
and the US should look at and handle their relations from a
strategic point of view and with an eye to the 21st century."
</P>
<P>
Developing normal and stable economic and trade relations
between China and the US on the basis of equality and mutual
benefit not only conforms with the fundamental interests of the
two peoples, but also benefits the prosperity and development of
the world economy, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Barshefsky said she came to China under instructions of
President Bill Clinton, who considered US-China relationship one
of the most important bilateral ties in the world.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton believed that the foundation of long-term and
stable US-China relations can only be consolidated and
strengthened through strategic dialogue, mutually-beneficial
cooperation and constructive settlement of existing problems, she
said.

<HEADLINE> Israel's 14th Knesset Opens today </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Israel's 14th Knesset
(parliament) opened today with a trumpet fanfare and guard of
honor, although Prime Minister-elect Benjamin Netanyahu failed to
present his new government.
</P>
<P>
President Ezer Weizman opened the 120-member Knesset at 4:00
p.m. local time (1300 GMT), and called on all members of the
Knesset to do their best to solve the country's internal dispute.
</P>
<P>
"I call on all those elected by the nation to do everything
possible to overcome the internal dispute, and attain a broad
consensus which will enable the country to confront the enemies
from outside," said Weizman.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hoped that the members of Knesset would understand
their "heavy responsibility," and would "use their minds and
strength to achieve peace and security."
</P>
<P>
In his speech, the president also paid tributes to outgoing
Prime Minister Shimon Peres, and expressed his wishes of success
to incoming premier Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
As the oldest member of Knesset, Peres, 72, was sworn in by
Weizman as the temporary speaker of the Knesset until a new
speaker is to be officially elected in the Knesset following
sessions.
</P>
<P>
In his speech to the plenum, Peres said the concern of peace
and security will unite the members in the Knesset.
</P>
<P>
He quoted Israel's first Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion as
saying that "peace with all the neighboring countries is the
strongest desire and ultimate realization of the Zionist dreams."
</P>
<P>
Peres presided the ceremony of swearing in the other Knesset
members.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, who had been widely expected to present his new
coalition government to the Knesset, said he would do so at the
next Knesset session to be held Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In the newly elected Knesset, the Likud and Labor parties have
lost considerable strength, as small parties, particularly the
religious parties and Yisrael Ba'aliya, a new immigrant party,
gained at their expense.
</P>
<P>
The Labor's share of seat reduced to 34 from 44, and Likud's
to 32 from 40, while the religious bloc increased their mandates
from 16 to 23.
</P>
<P>
Two newcomers, Yisrael Ba'aliya and The Third Way, a new group
initiated by hawkish Laborites, gained seven and four seats
separately.
</P>
<P>
The Likud is expected to form the new coalition with the
religious bloc and the centrist Yisrael Ba'aliya and Third Way,
attaining a majority of 66 seats in the new Knesset.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Aims to Increase Exports to Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Minister of Economy Nawal
el-Tatawi stressed here today the necessity of increasing the
Egyptian exports to Japan to reduce Egypt's deficit in its trade
with the Asian country.
</P>
<P>
In an opening address at a seminar on Egypt's industrial
development and prospects for exports, Tatawi said that Egypt
imported 340 million U.S. dollars worth of goods from Japan last
year, while its exports to Japan reached only approximately 40
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The two-day seminar, organized by the Egyptian Ministry of
Economy and the Japanese International Cooperation Agency, would
deal with a number of issues on policies of industrial development
and promoting exports.
</P>
<P>
Tatawi said that Egypt is now implementing a number of programs
to boost the economic development in the country.
</P>
<P>
A giant program for developing Sinai peninsula would cost a
total of 1,500 billion Egyptian pounds (450 billion U.S. dollars),
she said.
</P>
<P>
The program, which would be implemented until 2017, is aimed at
developing the peninsula into an area of attraction for
international investments, she added.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has also started a program for the development of Upper
Egypt, the minister said. The program would cost a total of 90
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian and Japanese businessmen are attending the seminar.

<HEADLINE> British Official: Beef Deal Unachievable Before EU Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Britain and its European Union (EU)
partners could not reach agreement on the "mad cow" problem before
the EU's upcoming summit on June 21-22 in Florence, Italy, a
senior British official said here today.
</P>
<P>
The official, close to a meeting of EU foreign ministers which
was held here Monday, said that other EU ministerial meetings
would only focus on some concrete details of the "mad cow" crisis.
</P>
<P>
Under the present situation, hopes to settle the crisis ahead
of the Florence summit were not existent, the official was quoted
by Italy's ANSA News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
The beef crisis topped the agenda at Monday's meeting of EU
foreign ministers, just four days before the summit of European
leaders set to focus on crucial issues like cutting unemployment,
planning a single European currency and paving the way for
admitting countries from eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
Local press believe there is no alternative to solve the "mad
cow" problem other than to let it go all the way to the Florence
summit meeting.
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind said his country
would carry out its threat to paralyze the summit if no agreement
is reached before then.
</P>
<P>
Britain has to convince a group of skeptical EU nations,
especially Germany and France, that it has done enough to wipe out
"mad cow" disease and restore consumer confidence in beef.
</P>
<P>
France has hardened its stand after reports revealed that
possibly tainted animal feed was sold to its farmers from 1989 to
1991 after being banned for use in Britain.
</P>
<P>
The beef crisis has become the number one headache to the
15-member organization since March, when reports on a possible
link between the cattle disease and a fatal human equivalent,
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, shocked the world.
</P>
<P>
The EU soon imposed a worldwide ban on British beef
product. Beef demand and prices have plunged dramatically ever
since.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Residents of Shanghai Pudong New
Area could say good-bye to salty water from today, thanks to the
operation of Lingqiao Waterworks.
</P>
<P>
With a daily water supply of 400,000 tons, the waterworks takes
good quality water directly from Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
In the past, waterworks in Pudong took in water from the
offshore of Pudong and the running water there used to be salty.
</P>
<P>
With the development of Pudong Economic and Technological
Development Zone, water supply in Pudong could not meet the needs
of local people and overseas business people in both quantity and
quality.
</P>
<P>
To improve the investment environment in Pudong, the municipal
government built the waterworks within 10 months.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the water supply network between
Pudong and Puxi has been established, which is expected to ease
the tension of water supply in this leading industrial and
commercial city of China.

WASHINGTON, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The final report of the Senate Whitewater Committee raises
new questions about whether President Bill Clinton and Hillary
Rodham Clinton properly reported their tax liabilities from the
Whitewater land venture to the Internal Revenue Service.
</P>
<P>
-- Campaigning last week underscored the constant tensions that
have come to affect presidential politics: the advantages and
disadvantages of the incumbent versus the challenger, the struggle
by candidates to control the news, and how politicians have come
to rely on pictures, not words, to sell themselves.
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirmed that he
does not intend to cede the Golan Heights or allow a Palestinian
state, but that he would talk with the Syrians and Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The Federal Election Commission expanded the list of people
Congress may take -- at the expense of their campaign funds -- to
political convention.
</P>
<P>
-- Congressional Republicans questioned Clinton administration
assertions that the White House obtained more than 400 sensitive
FBI background files as a result of a bureaucratic mistake and
called for expediting hearings on the issue.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- Irish and British leaders said a complete review of Northern
Ireland peace efforts may be undertaken following a suspected IRA
bombing in Manchester that injured more than 200 people Saturday.
Police said it was one of the biggest bombs ever detonated in
Britain. Clinton called the bombing a "brutal and cowardly act of
terrorism."
</P>
<P>
-- For years, American communities have grappled with how to
stem the rising tide of violence among youths. But that effort is
taking on fresh urgency as demographic trends and statistics show
lawlessness among juveniles continues to climb even as overall
urban crime rates drop.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin Holds Talks with Guinean President (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin said
in Beijing today that China hopes to consolidate the traditional
Sino-Guinean relations of mutual trust and strengthen
consultations and cooperation with Guinea in international affairs
and make joint efforts to safeguard the interests of developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese leader made the statement during talks with Guinean
President Lansana Conte here today.
</P>
<P>
The two heads of state praised the Sino-Guinean friendship and
exchanged views on expanding bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said, as an old friend of the Chinese people, Conte has
always attached great importance to Sino-Guinean relations, and
has made great contributions to the consolidation and development
of the friendly ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Jiang versed the old Chinese saying, it is a joy to receive a
friend coming afar. Though thousands of miles away from each other
geographically, the frequent exchanges between the two countries,
have forged a deep friendship among their peoples.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president said that Guinea, the first African
country south of Sahara to establish diplomatic relations with
China, has made historical contributions to Sino-African ties.
</P>
<P>
Despite great changes in the world in the past 37 years, the
friendly bilateral cooperative relations have enjoyed a healthy
and smooth development, which is the convincing evidence that
Sino-Guinean ties, on the basis of the five principles of peaceful
coexistence, have been sincere, vigorous and survived the tests of
time and global changes.
</P>
<P>
He agreed with Conte that Guinea and China were true friends
and with Conte's evaluation of the bilateral relations before
expressing satisfaction with the development of relations between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
According to Jiang, both countries are developing countries,
with similar experiences in history which give them common ground
in viewing significant world issues.
</P>
<P>
"From the beginning of the independence movement of African
nations until now, we have always supported each other and
cooperated closely," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government thanked the government of Guinea for its
consistent "one China" stand, and its support in the international
issues, including human rights.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said the Chinese government treasures the brotherly
relationship between two countries. Being in a transitional period
of history, China wishes to work together with Guinea to
strengthen a bilateral relation of mutual trust and overall
cooperation facing the 21st century.

<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti Crown Prince and Prime
Minister Saad al-Abdullah al-Sabah will attend the coming Arab
summit to be held in Cairo, Egypt from June 21-23.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
The summit, which will be the first get-together of all Arab
leaders, except Iraq, since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990,
is to discuss the Middle East peace process situation and
coordinate policies toward Israel in the wake of the election of
Israeli hardline Likud leader Benjamin Netanyahu as the prime
minister last month.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti amir expressed hope that the upcoming summit would
prove to be a success, saying that Kuwait underlines its keenness
on the unity of the Arab world and on continued drive for massing

the Arab nation.

<TEXT>
<P>
Jiang noted, trade and economic cooperation between the two
countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit have
achieved satisfactory results.
</P>
<P>
China and Guinea have jointly accomplished over 40 projects and
we are glad that they are beneficial to Guinea's economy. He
said, Guinea is rich in resources and enjoys unique natural
conditions, whereas China has advantages in technology and
management. China wishes to continue its support and help to
Guinea's economic development and hopes that enterprises serve as
a backbone for further cooperation between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Conte said a traditional friendship exists between Guinea and
China. For 37 years, since the two countries forged diplomatic
relations, Guinea has been grateful to the selfless aid from the
Chinese government. The bilateral trade and economic cooperation
have been fruitful. Guinea wishes to further enhance the friendly
ties, which is the main wish prompting his visit, added Conte.
</P>
<P>
He said Guinea attaches importance to its cooperation with
China, which it considers as part of south-to-south cooperation,
and hopes to strengthen mutual support and collaboration in
international affairs.
</P>
<P>
Conte said, Guinea is happy with the economic achievements
China has made for the past years. Guinea hopes to promote the
friendly cooperation in political, economic and various other
fields, especially in trade and economic spheres.
</P>
<P>
Guinea welcomes companies and enterprises from China to invest
and do business in Guinea, and encourage enterprises from both
sides to cooperate in trade and economy on an equal and mutually
beneficial footing.
</P>
<P>
Reiterating his "one China" stand, Conte said, Guinea
recognizes the People's Republic of China as the sole legitimate
government of China, Taiwan being an inalienable part of the
Chinese territory, and Guinea will not have any official relations
with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
After the talks, Jiang attended the signing ceremony of the
agreement of Sino-Guinea economic and technological cooperation,
and other two agreements.
</P>
<P>
Before the talks, Jiang held a welcome ceremony for Conte.
</P>
<P>
Later the Chinese president gave a banquet in Conte's honor.
</P>
<P>
Conte and his party arrived in China this noon for a 4-day
official visit at the invitation of Chinese President Jiang
Zemin.

<HEADLINE> China Calls for Promotion of Second-hand Goods Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 17 (Xinhua) -- China was today urged to start a
nationwide second-hand business, selling durable goods from city
homes to rural people.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice Premier Li Lanqing made the call in Beijing,
saying the state's commercial departments should actively promote
China's second-hand goods market. The market, he said, has a great
potential for development.
</P>
<P>
Li inspected several commission shops in Beijing, accompanied
by Chen Bangzhu, Minister of Internal Trade and Beijing Deputy
Mayor Meng Xuenong.
</P>
<P>
Li said the promotion of the second-hand goods market could
meet the needs of people at various consumer levels, and help keep
the sustained development of durable consumer goods in the country.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier said the disposal of second-hand goods,
especially those which are durable, has become a big headache for
many Chinese households, which limited the consumers from buying
new durable goods.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that all this could lead to saturation of some
durable goods in the market and the producers may lose interest in
developing new products.
</P>
<P>
China has a big rural market, Li said, adding the consumers'
needs for rural and urban markets are quite different and the gap
will not be narrowed for a long period of time.
</P>
<P>
He believed that the rural market could absorb second-hand
goods from cities.
</P>
<P>
The vice premier pointed out that networks should be
established for the sale of second-hand goods, and the state
commercial departments should develop second-hand goods market as
a major industry.
</P>
<P>
He also called for introducing of laws to govern the
development of second-hand goods market.

program expected to benefit farmers in the country and the southern
African region.
</P>
<P>
The Seed Company of Zimbabwe said on Monday it would place
more emphasis on drought-resistant seed varieties and hybrids.
</P>
<P>
''As part of this research thrust, the company has recently
committed itself to purchasing a farm in the Kadoma area in which it
intends to establish a new research station,'' the company said in a
prospectus outlining its future activities.
</P>
<P>
''Establishment of this facility will allow research to be
carried out in a low-potential area where conditions are more
representative of those experienced by the majority of farmers,''
it said.
</P>
<P>
The company said it was also expanding its seed production
facilities to meet the demand in Zimbabwe and the region.
</P>
<P>
It had already signed a technology transfer agreement with an
American company, Dekalb Genetics Corporation, which is heavily
engaged in the application of genetic research to agriculture.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Keeps Lead in Presidential Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
kept the lead in Sunday's presidential elections, the Central
Electoral Commission said this evening.
</P>
<P>
According to the preliminary results of the polls released by
the commission at 18:00 Moscow time (GMT 14:00), Yeltsin won 34.82
percent of votes. He was closely followed by Communist Party
leader Gennady Zyuganov with 32.13 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to Russian election laws, if none of the presidential
hopefuls gets more than 50 percent of the votes in the first round
of voting, as was the case this time, a runoff will be held
between the top two candidates within 15 days since the final vote
counting of the first round.
</P>
<P>
Now, both Yeltsin and Zyuganov are preparing for the showdown
in the second round by forming new coalitions.
</P>
<P>
The law-and-order advocate general Alexander Lebed took the
third place with 14.71 percent.
</P>
<P>
Liberal economist Grigory Yavlinsky and Liberal Democratic
Party leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky were far behind, with 7.41 and
5.84 percent of votes respectively.
</P>
<P>
Five other candidates failed to overcome the one-percent hurdle.
</P>
<P>
Some 1.54 percent of voters were against all the candidates.
</P>
<P>
The table reflects the returns of all component parts of the
Russian Federation, except Chechnya, or some 98 percent of the
votes.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin told reporters this
afternoon that Yeltsin planned to submit a draft law to the State
Duma, the lower house of the Russian parliament, on Tuesday to
announce July 3 as a holiday to hold the second round of the
presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
Several hours after a televised address to the nation for more
support in the second round, Yeltsin reportedly met with Lebed in
the Kremlin to "discuss preliminary results of the first round of
presidential elections, further development of the social and
political situation in the country and their possible cooperation."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Zyuganov expressed satisfaction with the outcome of
the first round and said that he would undoubtedly win the second
round.
</P>
<P>
He said at the press center of the Moscow Mayor's office that
his national-patriotic alliance will decide on its tactics in the
second round on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We will hold consultations with all who are interested,"
Zyuganov said.

Shimon Peres in the Israeli elections, Hashad said that the peace
process is based on the land-for-peace principle and the relevant
U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
"For the victory the Likud bloc won in the elections, it is an
Israeli internal affair. As for the Arabs, it is not a matter of
pessimism or optimism about the triumph of one political party
over another," said Hashad.
</P>
<P>
Under such circumstances, one thing required is to be realistic
in dealing with the situation, and to abide by the principles and
foundations of the peace process, with the aim of achieving an
overall, fair and lasting peace in the region, added Hashad.
</P>
<P>
"The peace process is not governed by political balances
inside Israel. There is an Arab stand supported by international
legitimacy. Palestinian national unity is another determinant of
the peace process. There are also the major powers which have
sponsored the peace process and consider it vital to themselves,
as well as to the stability of the region and the entire world,"
the Arab League assistant secretary general said.
</P>
<P>
"I am not pessimistic about the future, because it is
impossible for Arabs to lose their rights so long as we deal well
with reality and stick to our established principles.

<HEADLINE> International Aid at All Time Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 17 (Xinhua) -- International aid has fallen to
its lowest level in 20 years, says an international report on aid
launched here on Monday by the Charity Action Aid.
</P>
<P>
The report, entitled " The Reality Of Aid 1996", prepared by a
consortium of independent bodies from 21 member states of the
Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), was
launched by Zimbabwean Deputy Minister of Agriculture Olivia
Muchena.
</P>
<P>
The report said in 1994, with the exception of the United
States, more than a third of the donors cut their aid in spite of
commitments made by donor member countries of OECD to maintain
aid targets.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral aid to sub-Saharan African countries had fallen by
670 million U.S.Dollars since 1991, adding that new players such
as Vietnam, South Africa and Cambodia further diluted aid
delivery, having leapt to the top of some donors' tables, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
During 1994, the world's richest countries allowed their aid
budgets to fall to just 0.3 percent of the Gross National
Product, it said.
</P>
<P>
The report pointed out that this reduction comes at a time
when 20 percent of the world's population is living in absolute
poverty, living on less than one U.S.Dollar a day.
</P>
<P>
It recommended that governments should invigorate their
commitment to the 0.7 percent of GNP target set by OECD and
increase their aid budgets.
</P>
<P>
The Reality Of Aid 1996 is the fourth in a series of annual
reports which provides an independent analysis of official aid
from 21 countries in the OECD.
</P>
<P>
Action Aid works in 20 countries in Africa, Asia and Latin
America, helping to reduce poverty and improve the quality of
life for people living in the world's poorest communitiers.

<HEADLINE> Shaanxi Turning Desert Into Farmland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The desert area in the world is
growing at a rate of 60,000 square kilometers a year, but the
Yulin Region in northwest China's Shaanxi Province is turning the
tide against the expanding seas of sand.
</P>
<P>
Desert in the province has been turned back into farmland at a
yearly rate of 1.62 percent.
</P>
<P>
Located at the southern end of the Muus desert, the northern
part of the Yulin Region, accounting for almost half of the
region's total area, is usually hit by sand storms.
</P>
<P>
Local people have launched massive tree-planting projects since
1980s. By the end of 1995 the tree planted area covered an area of
990,000 hectares, increasing the afforestation rate to 38.9
percent from just 1.8 percent in 1949.
</P>
<P>
Four shelter tree belts stretching 1,500 km have been built,
covering an area of 140,000 ha, and 90,000 ha of farmland have
been protected from sand storms.
</P>
<P>
With the environment improving, agriculture, led by animal
husbandry and supported by shelter tree belts and irrigation
network, has been growing rapidly.
</P>
<P>
Over 90,000 ha of new farmland has been developed and grain
output has increased by nearly seven fold over the early period of
1950s.
</P>
<P>
The output of the forestry industry has hit 150 million yuan
(17 million US dollars), increasing by more than 20 fold. Over
85,000 ha of grasslands have been planted or upgraded, and the
output of animal husbandry hit 300 million yuan. More than 90,000
people living in the area have shaken off poverty.
</P>
<P>
The local people attribute the success of the campaign against
the sand storms to the government's policy and the application of
science and technology.
</P>
<P>
Each year more than 300 technicians are sent to the desert
areas to spread comprehensive management techniques in the desert,
raising afforestation survival rate to above 85 percent.

<HEADLINE> Japan's May Trade Surplus Falls 60 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Japan's trade surplus in May fell to
231.69 billion yen (2.317 billion U.S. dollars), down 60.5 percent
from a year earlier, the 18th consecutive monthly decrease, the
Finance Ministry said today.
</P>
<P>
The drop was mainly attributed to continued imports in personal
computers, microchips and other products.
</P>
<P>
The fall also marked the biggest fall for the month of May
since 1987, when the surplus decreased 28.2 percent, the ministry
said in a preliminary report.
</P>
<P>
In May this year, Japan's politically sensitive trade surplus
with the United States also declined 39.6 percent to 167.68
billion year (1.677 billion dollars), falling for the 15th
straight month, it said.
</P>
<P>
In overall trade, Japan posted an 8 percent increase in the
value of auto exports, the first rise since November 1994, though
their volume dipped 5.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
In the nation's global trade for the month, exports rose 14.2
percent to 3,405.91 billion yen (34.059 billion dollars), an
increase for the 10th successive month, while imports advanced
32.6 percent to 3,174.22 billion yen (31.742 billion dollars), up
for the 25th consecutive month, according to the report.

<HEADLINE> China to Improve Sales of Table Salt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 17 (Xinhua) -- China plans to crack down on the
illegal production and sales of table salt, which is designed to
guarantee all Chinese people to have enough iodic salt to eat,
official sources here said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from China's light industry show that the Chinese
market demanded about 8 million tons of table salt in 1985, while
the China National Salt Corporation just sold a little more than 6
million tons of the salt that year.
</P>
<P>
This means that more than 20 percent of salt with a high
percentage of sodium chloride and also other types of poor quality
salt was sold at the market.
</P>
<P>
A number of people were fatally poisoned after eating the
poor-quality salt in 1995, according to reports.
</P>
<P>
On May 27, Premier Li Peng signed the State Council Order
No. 197 which regulates the state's monopoly on the sale of iodic
salt.
</P>
<P>
According to the regulations, the Chinese government will
appoint some salt companies as the only valid salt producers, and
companies that are engaged in the transport and wholesale of the
salt are required to obtain special licenses from the departments
concerned.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng today
called for the application of science and technology to be stepped
up, saying that governments at all levels should spare no effort
in promoting and safeguarding scientific achievements.
</P>
<P>
The premier made the remark here this morning at a Forum on
Accelerating the Application of Scientific and Technological
Achievements, which was attended by dozens of ministerial level
officials.
</P>
<P>
Li, noting that the integration of science, technology and
economy represents a worldwide trend, said that the quality and
efficiency of economic growth in China hinges on whether
scientific and technological achievements are properly used to
promote economic development in good time.
</P>
<P>
Enterprises should play a principal role in doing the work, and
the sooner those achievements can be transformed into realistic
production forces, the better, the premier said.
</P>
<P>
Li also pointed out that the hope of China's agriculture,
especially its grain production, should be primarily pinned on the
application of scientific and technological achievements.
</P>
<P>
The premier stressed that priority should be given to the
development of such sectors as energy, communications,
information, environmental protection, and high-tech industries,
sectors that are crucial for the overall progress of national
economy.
</P>
<P>
He asked governments at all levels to broaden the channels for
the accumulation of research funds, and at the same time, to
create a favorable environment, in a move to attract more
outstanding overseas Chinese researchers to return home, and do
their bit for the development of the motherland.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe To Build Houses for Low, Middle Income </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe Building Society
(ZBS) and the National Social Security Authority (NSSA) are
entering into a 30 million U.S.Dollars joint-venture to build
nearly 3,000 houses for the low and middle income group in the
country.
</P>
<P>
ZBS Managing Director Francis Nhema said on Monday the first
2,000 houses would be built in Harare's Mufakose high-density
suburb at an estimated cost of 11 million U.S.Dollars and would
be targeted at beneficiaries with a monthly income of 120
U.S.Dollars.
</P>
<P>
''The first phase has already started and we expected to
complete construction of most of the houses by the end of the
year,'' Nhema said.
</P>
<P>
He said negotiations are being held with NSSA, under which the
social authority is expected to approve an investment of up to 20
million U.S.Dollars to build houses specifically for the middle
income group.
</P>
<P>
He said with the funds, the ZBS will be able to build 1,000
houses for those earning between 200 U.S.Dollars and 600 U.S.

<HEADLINE> Experts Discuss Scenarios for Global Trachoma Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Experts gathered here today to
discuss possible scenarios for global elimination of trachoma as
the major cause of preventable blindness in the world.
</P>
<P>
The four-day international scientific meeting, sponsored by the
World Health Organization (WHO) and several non-governmental
organizations active in trachoma control, is called to review
recent developments and recommend improved strategies to control
the disease.
</P>
<P>
It is also envisaged that a coordination body of organizations
interested in the global elimination of trachoma will be formed at
this meeting.
</P>
<P>
The WHO says experts are optimistic that with improved trachoma
control strategies and a new effective antibiotic, called
azithromycin, the global elimination of the world's major cause of
preventable blindness "may well be in sight."
</P>
<P>
The long-acting antibiotic has been field tested in a number of
countries and initial results look very promising: one to three
doses per year may eliminate the blinding propensity of trachoma.
</P>
<P>
Experts attending the meeting will pay particular attention to
the clinical experience obtained with azithromycin and how to cut
the costs of the new treatment to make it available to all those
in need in the developing countries.
</P>
<P>
One of the oldest diseases known to mankind, trachoma is
responsible at present for 15 percent of world blindness.
Worldwide, there are about 6 million people largely irreversibly
blinded by trachoma and an estimated 148 million cases of active
disease in need of treatment, the WHO said.
</P>
<P>
For almost 50 years, the WHO has been leading the fight against
trachoma and has been assisting endemic countries in the
organization and implementation of their national trachoma control
efforts.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to these sustained efforts, trachoma cases have been
considerably reduced and even eliminated from many communities and
the burden of trachoma as a public health problem was partially
alleviated.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, trachoma today is still a major blinding disease
striking at the poorest populations of the world, the WHO said.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Stargazers from around the globe
today converged on the Chinese city of Shanghai for an
international symposium.
</P>
<P>
They are planning to put latest knowledge about far away
galaxies into sharp focus during four days of discussions.
</P>
<P>
Some 160 Chinese and foreign astronomers are discussing the
latest observations on active galaxies, and the latest theories
and interpretations of the observed phenomena.
</P>
<P>
Astronomers from 25 countries, including the U.S. France,
Britain, Germany Japan and China are attending the four-day 159th
Symposium of the International Astronomical Association.
</P>
<P>
The symposium is sponsored by Chinese University of Science and
Technology, Shanghai Observatory attached to Chinese Academy of
Sciences and the U.S. Ohio State University.
</P>
<P>
The topic of the symposium is the "Emission Lines in Active
Galaxies -- New Methods and Techniques".
</P>
<P>
The most startling observations include those made by an
infra-red astronomical observation satellite launched last
November and extra ultra-violet observation telescope carried by
the Space Shuttle and the Hubble space telescope.
</P>
<P>
Chinese experts will also report their latest discoveries made
by using China-made optical astronomical telescopes.
</P>
<P>
The galaxies are huge celestial systems consisting of a billion
to hundreds of billions of fixed stars, and the active galaxies
are the core of the galaxies which are violently active.
</P>
<P>
The subject of this symposium is one of the most topical
subjects in the astrophysics field.
</P>
<P>
According to a Chinese expert the observation and research of
active galaxies is of great importance to the study of the origin
and evolution of whole galaxies, paving the way for research into
the origin and evolution of the universe.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's fishery products
export increased 4.18 percent in the past three years from 529,213
tons in 1993 to 574,234 tons in 1995, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
F.X. Murdijo, director general for Fishery under the Ministry
of Agriculture, was quoted as saying at a seminar here that the
increase had made the fishery export value up by 9.68 percent per
year during the same period and the 1995 value reached 1.8 billion
US dollars.
</P>
<P>
He said the government would continue to make efforts to
maximally exploit Indonesia's abundant fishery potentials in its
large water covering two thirds of the country's territory.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, fishery commodities would become a
major foreign exchange earner for the country's economy after
textile and textile products which are at present still dominating
the country's non-oil/non-gas export.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that the government would increase its fishery
production capacity by exploiting the current existing natural
resources in the country.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia currently has the potential in marine resources
amounting to about 6.7 million tons of fishery products annually.
</P>
<P>
Only about 40 percent of the total marine potential was at
present exploited, he added.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Western-educated Professors Put in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 17 (Xinhua) -- All Western-educated Iranian
professors shall be subjected to a strict "ideological quarantine"
before they take up teaching posts at Iranian colleges or
universities starting from today.
</P>
<P>
This was announced today by Qolam-Reza Mesbahi, a
representative of Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei for high
education.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the "ideological quarantine" on
professors is part of the nationwide drive to Islamize the higher
education sector which is considered as the most dangerous hotbed
for westernization in Iran.
</P>
<P>
However, they noted, the measure would frighten Western-
educated Iranian professors and teachers away from coming back
home to serve their home country.
</P>
<P>
Ali Khamenei recently criticized the higher education sector
for its "anti-religious trend and deviant policies" while
stressing more Islamization of universities and colleges.
</P>
<P>
Mesbahi said that the presence of teaching staff with no or
weak belief in Islamic values constitutes "a grave threat" to the
future of the Islamic system and the revolution.
</P>
<P>
Iran has a total of 114 universities and colleges with about
150,000 students and 13,700 teaching staff members. However, the
higher education sector suffers a serious shortage of teaching
staff and educational facilities because of the fast growing
population.
</P>
<P>
Mesbahi said the effort to make Iranian colleges and
universities more Islamic should begin with administrative reform
and attention should be paid to the issue of teaching staff
appointment.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that all those instructors who in anyway insult
revolutionary values should be expelled from "the university
science board," a term used to say that an instructor has been
admitted as an official member of Iran's higher education
teaching post with the due advantages.
</P>
<P>
In the past several weeks, many gatherings and demonstrations
were held in university campuses in various parts of the country
and educational authorities have turned into the main targets of
criticism.
</P>
<P>
Last month, some young extremists from the Ansar Hezbollah, a
riotous and frightening group in Iran, intruded into a university
campus and stopped liberal-minded professor Abdolkarim Soroush'
scheduled speech by beating some students and teachers.
</P>
<P>
Some 500 university students voiced their anger, lodged protest
over extremists' violence on campus and sent their open letter to
Iranian authorities, demanding stringent measures to prevent any
violent behavior by Ansar Hezbollah, which is opposed to the
changes and reforms implemented or proposed by the moderate
government led by President Hashemi Rafsanjani and some
newly-elected parliament deputies.
</P>
<P>
They regard any relaxation of strict Islamic codes like the
separation of sexes and introduction of Western academic values as
a breach of Islamic principles.
</P>
<P>
The extremist group is supported by hardliner clergyman
Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati who called for a purge of Westernized
professors and administrators who criticize religious ideals in
their lectures at the university.
</P>
<P>
Despite the purge, many professors at Iran's universities are
Western-educated and are in favor of separation of religion from
politics.

<HEADLINE> Pilot Drawn in Focus in Indonesian Plane Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Investigative sources said the
pilot of an Indonesian plane had tried to abort the flight before
it ploughed into a field at Japan's Fukuoka Airport last Thursday,
the Antara news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Investigators said they were trying to get an explanation from
the pilot, Ronald Londong, on why he decided to abort the flight
when he should have been aware of a risk of overshooting the
runway.
</P>
<P>
Three persons were killed and 99 others injured when the Garuda
Indonesian airliner DC-10, carrying 260 passengers and a crew of
15, burst into flames after getting off the ground, then touching
down and overshooting the runway.
</P>
<P>
According to a Kyodo news dispatch from Fukuoka, evidence
showed that the plane's main wing panels, which are used to
increase wind resistance in an emergency landing or when braking,
were operating at the time of the accident.
</P>
<P>
This was backed up by the finding of the Accident Investigation
Committee of the Indonesian Transport Ministry, who said tire skid
marks on the runway indicated that the plane first lifted off and
then landed, braking suddenly.
</P>
<P>
The investigators said they also found that the plane's engines
were in the reverse thrust mode, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The 38-year-old pilot was hospitalized immediately after the
accident for injuries on his back and chest.
</P>
<P>
Police questioned him for about three-and-a-half hours on the
day of the accident, but hospital authorities have since forbidden
any questioning of the injured pilot.
</P>
<P>
The report said he refused to answer any questions when the
committee members visited the hospital this morning.

<HEADLINE> Ex-South Korean President Denies Role in Crackdown of Revolt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Former South Korean President Chun
Doo-hwan today denied he had sent troops to crack down on a civil
uprising in the city of Kwangju in 1980.
</P>
<P>
Chun made the claim at the 14th trial of mutiny and treason
cases involving him and another former president, Roh Tae-woo, as
well as some of Chun's fellow generals and colonels at the Seoul
District Court here today.
</P>
<P>
Standing trial at the court were Chun and Roh as well as Chun's
11 close aides, including Hwang Young-shi, former first army corps
commander.
</P>
<P>
"The troops dispatch was based exclusively on a decision made
by the then martial law command at the recommendation of Chin
Jong-chae, commander of the second army," Chun said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the suppression of the uprising in Kwangju,
capital of the South Cholla Province, was personally commanded by
Chun Woong, commander of the 31st division stationed near Kwangju.
</P>
<P>
A total of 16 former South Korean army officers including Chun
and Roh have been indicted for mutiny or treason, or both. They
were charged for their roles in the military revolt on December
12, 1979 and in the bloody crackdown of the civil uprising in
Kwangju May 18, 1980, which protested against the martial law.
</P>
<P>
Chun seized power on August 27, 1980 and ruled the country
until February 1988. He was followed by Roh who stepped down in
February 1993.
</P>
<P>
The ex-presidents, who were arrested last year, have also been
indicted on graft charges for receiving illegal funds from
businessmen while in office.
</P>
<P>
The next trial session will be held on June 20, during which
the court is expected to look into evidential items relating to
the 1979 revolt and review the list of witnesses offered by both
the prosecutors and defense lawyers.

<HEADLINE> Efforts Called for Strengthening Vocational Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 17 (Xinhua) -- China's Premier Li Peng today
urged governments at all levels to pay close attention to the
country's vocational education.
</P>
<P>
Li told participants to the third national working conference
on vocational education, jointly held by the State Education
Commission, the State Economic and Trade Commission and Ministry
of Labor, that with the establishment of a socialist market
economy, economic development calls for more practical talents.
</P>
<P>
Efforts should be redoubled to cultivate a great number of
workers with professional skills, who are well-trained in an
all-round way -- morally, intellectually and physically, Li said.
</P>
<P>
"It is a major component of China's educational undertaking and
it has played an important role in the construction of socialist
modernization," the premier said, referring to the importance of
vocational education.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the past decade's efforts in reforms and opening to
the outside world, China has made tremendous achievements in
developing vocational education, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Students enrolled by vocational schools has reached 58 percent
of high schools and vocational schools put together, exceeding the
previous ratio of one-to-one between the two kinds of schools, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
By the end of the century, the premier said, vocational school
students in more developed areas are expected to reach up to 70
percent of the total enrollment.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the lack of teachers posed an urgent problem
in developing vocational education. For that, he added, all
educational departments should redouble their efforts to
cultivate, by all means, a great number of teachers committed to
vocational education.
</P>
<P>
The difficulty in universalizing compulsory education lies in
rural areas, he said, adding that in some places, the number of
illiterates has grown. Therefore, he said, vocational education
should be expanded into basic education in the rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Li met participants to the meeting in the Great Hall of People
this afternoon. enditem

<HEADLINE> Arafat leaves Cairo for Beijing for Visit to China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian Authority President
Yasser Arafat left Cairo early today for Beijing for a four-day
official visit to China.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua before leaving Cairo, Arafat made
it clear that his visit to China comes in fateful circumstances
experienced by the Arab nation, so it is undoubtedly very
important for the Palestinians, the Arab nation and the Middle
East region.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to China, Arafat added, he would brief
Chinese leaders on the latest developments of the Middle East
peace process following the recent Israeli elections, in which
Israeli hardline Likud leader Benjamin Netanyahu was elected prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
Arafat expressed high appreciation for the major role currently
played by China in the interest of the Palestinian people, the
Arab nation and the Middle East peace issues.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian President said that, in the light of the
changes which have recently happened in Israel, he felt it
incumbent upon him to put the Chinese leadership in the picture
about these changes and their consequences.
</P>
<P>
In reply to a question about his expectations of the upcoming
pan-Arab summit due to be held in Cairo from June 21 to 23 and the
future of the Middle East peace process, especially on the
Palestinian-Israeli track, the Palestinian leader said, "The
upcoming Arab summit comes amid the critical conditions undergone
by the region, especially in the field of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"The summit is also intended to restore Arab solidarity so that
the Arab nation can contribute to shaping the new world order and
preventing it from functioning at its expense. Protecting the
peace process on all tracks is another important point."
</P>
<P>
Arafat added that "in order to achieve a fair, overall and
lasting peace, it has to take into consideration all these
points, especially on the Palestinian-Israeli track of the Middle
East peace process."
</P>
<P>
On his expectations of the future of the final-stage
negotiations with Israel, the Palestinian leader said, "We have to
wait and see how the new Israeli government will be like."
</P>
<P>
On his way to Beijing, Arafat arrived in Cairo Sunday night
from Gaza City for a few hours' stay, during which he had talks
with Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa.

<HEADLINE> China, Latin America to Forge Air Link </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 17 (Xinhua) -- China and Latin America are
expected to establish air links within the year, with the first
route to be opened between China and Brazil.
</P>
<P>
The opening of this route will shorten air travel time between
China and Latin America from the present 36 hours to less than 25
hours, an official with the Civil Aviation Administration of China
(CAAC) said today.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Yafeng, director of CAAC's international affairs, said
China has established air links with all the continents except
Latin America.
</P>
<P>
To increase mutual co-operation in civil aviation between China
and Latin American countries, CAAC director Chen Guangyi recently
visited the four Latin American countries of Brazil, Chile,
Argentina and Peru.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Chen signed a civil aviation agreement with
Chile, and a draft one with Peru, according to Zhang, who was
among Chen's entourage. China and Peru are to sign a formal
agreement later this year
</P>
<P>
Zhang said China and Brazil signed a civil aviation agreement
in 1994, which allows each country to have one airline operating
on the Sino-Brasilian route, and each to have two cities as
destinations on the route. The four cities are Sao Paulo, Rio de
Janeiro, Beijing and Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
He noted that major carriers of the two countries have shown
much interest in operating flights between China and Brazil due to
good market prospects.
</P>
<P>
The official pointed out that routes between China and the
other three Latin American countries are not likely to be opened in
the near future, as there is not sufficient market demand.
</P>
<P>
"However, carriers may co-operate with each other in ways such
as code-sharing flights to meet existing market demand." Zhang
remarked.
</P>
<P>
He said travelers between China and Latin America mainly
consist of business people, diplomats, and the large number of
overseas Chinese in the region.
</P>
<P>
China has so far signed civil aviation agreements with 72
countries, and has air links with 43 throughout the world.

<HEADLINE> Sludge Used to Produce Potash Fertilizer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Sewage waste has helped boost
banana, grain and tobacco crops by more than 11 per cent, says
researchers in China.
</P>
<P>
Sludge has been successfully used in the production of
activated biological potash fertilizer in north China's Hebei
Province.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, sewage treatment plants have been mushrooming
in China, turning out large amounts of sludge. Qiaoxi Sewage
Treatment Plant in Hebei Province turns out 128 cubic meters of
dehydrated sludge for every 16 tons of sewage it treats daily.
</P>
<P>
The plant started to research into the utilization of sludge in
co-operation with the Hebei Provincial Institute of Biology in
1994.
</P>
<P>
Tests showed that sludge, after simple treatment, can
absolutely be used as absorbents in the production of potash
fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
At present carbon is usually used as the absorbent in the
production of bacterial fertilizers.
</P>
<P>
The potash fertilizer produced with sludge as absorbent has
been put into production on a limited scale, and has proven
effective with wheat, corn, cotton, vegetables, tobacco and
banana. The output of the crops increases by over 11 percent on
average.

<P>
BEIJING, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing
told Charlene Barshefsky, acting US trade representative, in
Beijing today that the agreement China and the United States
reached today on intellectual property rights (IPR) is in line
with the fundamental interests of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Barshefsky is heading a US delegation discussing IPR issues
with Chinese officials. Their consultations ended today with

</P>
<P>
During a meeting this afternoon with Barshefsky in Zhongnanhai,
headquarters of the Chinese government, Li said that it is China's
consistent policy to protect intellectual property rights.
</P>
<P>
Since its reform and opening up to the outside world in 1979,
China has enacted a series of laws and rules concerning this
issue, and set up justice and administrative institutions to
enforce them, Li said.
</P>
<P>
China's achievements in cracking down on piracy and
infringement upon IPR are there for all to see, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Long-term efforts should be made in cracking down on piracy and
IPR violations, Li said.
</P>
<P>
"This is not only the demand of strengthening international
economic and trade cooperation and scientific and technological
exchanges, but more importantly the demand of healthily advancing
China's science, technology and culture," he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
On Sino-US economic and trade relations, Li said that China and
the US are complimentary economically and there remains great
potential in developing bilateral economic and trade ties and
scientific and technological cooperation.

obstacles, increase consultation and constructive cooperation on
the basis of equality and mutual benefit, in order to upgrade
bilateral economic and trade relations.

indicated that the two countries can resolve their differences
through consultation on the basis of equality and mutual benefit.

2,000 major grain growers to build an all-purpose service network
designed to spread information about farming technology.
</P>
<P>
Through this network, which links farmers to more than 12,600
special growing households, the departments are able to send new
high quality means of production to farmers in time to use them
for their crops, to provide them with relevant technical services.
</P>
<P>
So far, about 600 major growers have been selected to serve as
"experimenting households for means of production," and have
received various kinds of technical training.

<HEADLINE> ICBC to Act as Agent Bank for Nuclear Power Station Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The Industrial and Commercial Bank
of China, China's largest state bank, has signed an agreement with
the State Development Bank to act as its agent for re-granting
foreign exchange loans for the Guangdong Lingao Nuclear Power
Station project.
</P>
<P>
With a total scheduled investment of 4.1 billion US dollars,
the Lingao Nuclear Power Station project is currently the one of
the largest energy construction projects in the country.
</P>
<P>
The SDB, a policy-oriented bank, has the mandate to raise all
the needed funds overseas, and re-grant them to the Guangdong
Lingao Nuclear Power Station Company.
</P>
<P>
At the signing ceremony held in Beijing today, Liu Mingkang,
SDB's vice president, said they selected ICBC as the agent for the
project because it has the upper hand in collecting electricity
fees after the completion of the project, and is willing to take
the responsibility of calling back the principals and interest of
the loans.
</P>
<P>
"ICBC is the largest commercial bank with abundant capital and
affiliates spreading nationwide, and as a result, it is able to
offer adequate revolving funds to support the project," said the
vice president.
</P>
<P>
At the end of 1995, ICBC's total assets reached more than 3,000
billion yuan. Its assets in foreign exchange also arrived at 24.9
billion US dollars at the same time.
</P>
<P>
In August 1995 the two banks officially signed an agency
agreement. By the end of last year ICBC had acted as agent for
350 lending projects totalling 7.03 billion yuan for SDB.
</P>
<P>
Approved by the State Council, the Guangdong Lingao Nuclear
Power Station is one of the state key projects during the Ninth
Five-Year (1996-2000) Period. The construction of the project is
scheduled to start in July this year and will be completed in
seven months.
</P>
<P>
According to reliable sources, the source of funding for the
project will include 400 million US dollars of capital stock, 2.3
billion US dollars of export credit and 1.8 billion US dollars of
foreign commercial loans. Most of the loans will be used to import
equipment and technology from companies in Britain and France.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The '97 Beijing International
Autoelectronics &AMP; Intelligent Transport Systems Exhibition, the
second of its kind to be held in China, is scheduled to be staged
next April.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Ministry of Electronics Industry (MEI)
said today that the coming event will aim at displaying the bright
prospects of developing auto and highway transport related
electronics, information and intelligence.
</P>
<P>
With the advancement of science and technology and rapid
economic development, both passenger and cargo transportation
volume has been on sharp rise in recent years, he said.
</P>
<P>
To reduce the losses caused by traffic jams, it is imperative
to develop autoelectronics, and electronics, information and
intelligence for highway transport, he added.
</P>
<P>
By the end of the century, China is expected to turn out up to
three million motor vehicles each year, and the highway open to
traffic is expected to hit 1.25 million kilometers.
</P>
<P>
To solve the problems brought by the sharp increase in motor
vehicles, and meet the needs of the national economy, MEI has
listed autoelectronics and transport electronics as one of the key
development areas for the next five years.
</P>
<P>
By the end of this century, the output value of China's
autoelectronics and transport-electronics is expected to top 20
billion yuan.

<P>
BEIJING, June 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. and Chinese negotiators
announced in Beijing today that they are to cancel trade sanctions
and counter-retaliations targeted at each other.
</P>
<P>
At the end of talks in the Chinese capital, Charlene
Barshefsky, acting US trade representative, announced that the
U.S. will call off its intended trade retaliatory measures against
China, and promised to drop China from the list under special 301
screening.
</P>
<P>
Shi Guangsheng, China's vice minister of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation, announced that China will also call off
counter-retaliations against the the U.S. in response to the
U.S. commitment.
</P>
<P>
These are the results of three-day talks from June 15-17
between the Chinese delegation, headed by Shi Guangsheng, and the
U.S. delegation, headed by Barshefsky, in which the two sides
reached agreement on IPR and relevant issues.
</P>
<P>
The talks were described by observers here as "frank and
constructive."
</P>
<P>
They said that the agreement once again shows that the only way
to solve the differences between countries is consultations on an
equal footing. Sanctions and retaliations will do no good to the
settlement of any issues, instead, they will make the differences
more complicated, the observers added.
</P>
<P>
They held that the settlement of the IPR issues will not only
benefit the development of Sino-US trade and economic ties, but
also are in line with the fundamental interests of the two
nations. Therefore the result will be well received by the
economic circles of the two countries and other concerned parties.
</P>
<P>
Shi said that the Chinese government has always been attentive
to the protection of IPR and signed a series of international
accords in this regard.
</P>
<P>
For example, he said, China and the U.S. signed two agreements
concerning IPR protection in January 1991 and February 1995.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he said, China adopted a series of concrete
and effective measures to ensure IPR protection and made marked
progress which attracted world attention.
</P>
<P>
All the facts indicated China's solemn stand of honoring
international conventions and fulfilling the obligations set forth
in multi-lateral agreements to which China is a signatory, he said.
</P>
<P>
Shi said that IPR protection is called for by China's reform
and opening up, and more importantly by China's own economic
development and progress of its science and technology.
</P>
<P>
China will, as always, protect the intellectual property
rights, the vice-minister said.

<HEADLINE> Over 7.6 Million Perinatal Deaths Occur Annually Worldwide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Over 7.6 million babies fail to
make it through the late stages of pregnancy, birth and the first
week of life annually worldwide, the World Health Organization
(WHO) said today.
</P>
<P>
The WHO described it a warning sign which appeals for better
care for pregnant women and newborns, especially in developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
According to newly-published WHO document titled "Perinatal
Mortality", almost 4.3 million babies die before or during birth
and another 3.4 million die within the first week of life every
year in the world.
</P>
<P>
The WHO also noted that although the number of babies who die
during the first year of life has decreased substantially during
the past decade, the number of babies who are born dead or die
within the first week of life has remained virtually unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Most notably, about 98 percent of perinatal deaths take place
in developing countries, where 57 out of every 1,000 babies born
are either born dead or die within the first week of life, five
times the rate in developed countries where the perinatal
mortality rate is estimated to be only 11 per 1,000 births.
</P>
<P>
The WHO said the high rates in developing countries reflect the
vicious circle of resource-poor settings, including poor nutrition
status of women, insufficient prevention of complications of
pregnancy, and too few properly supervised deliveries.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, perinatal deaths can be reduced only when pregnant
women receive better care, especially skilled attention during
delivery and when the needs of the newborn are better met, which
include hygienic conditions for delivery, warmth, immediate
breastfeeding, resuscitation when necessary and treatment of
infections, the WHO said.
</P>
<P>
"It is the duty of the international community to support
countries that wish to make a difference for mothers and their
babies," said the U.N. specialized health agency.
</P>
<P>
According to the WHO document, the highest perinatal mortality
rates are found in western, central and eastern Africa, about 80
per 1,000 births, with south-central Asia closely behind, about 66
deaths per 1,000 births.
</P>
<P>
High levels of perinatal mortality are found in the same places
where maternal deaths are high. Preventive measures to reduce
perinatal deaths, therefore, also help prevent maternal deaths and
morbidities, the WHO said.

<HEADLINE> Police Fail to Find Missing Crewmen of Capsized Freighter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, June 17 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's maritime police made
no progress in their three-day-long search at the sea for the 26
sailors missing from a Cyprus-registered freighter, police sources
said here today.
</P>
<P>
The ill-fated Cyprus-flagged ship "Annaspiratou" collided in
thick fog with a Greece-flagged freighter "Polydefkis" about 10
kilometers off the coast of South Korea's Kyongsang Province on
June 15.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot ship sank after the collision with all the 26
crewmen missing, while all 12 crewmen of the Greek freighter were
reported safe.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that oil is continuing to spill out of
Annaspiratou and there are no reports of the whereabouts of the 26
sailors.
</P>
<P>
A dark brown 100-meter-wide and three-kilometer-long oil slick
of Bunker C oil is spreading near the scene of the accident, they
noted.
</P>
<P>
More than 20 South Korean vessels are working to contain the
spill but ran into problems caused by 2.5-meter waves and dense
fog, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot vessel was carrying some 300 tons of Bunker C and
other oil before the collision.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Urges Efforts Against Desertification </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations has said it is
upbeat about the entry into force of the Convention to Combat
Desertification (CCD) by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
So far, 31 countries have ratified CCD, and the number of
countries ratifying the convention is likely to reach 50 by the
end of the year, enabling the Convention to take effect, according
to a U.N. press release issued on the World Day to Combat
Desertification, which fell on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. urged speedy process towards ratification of the
Convention, adding that desertification persists globally,
affecting the livelihoods of about 1 billion people.
</P>
<P>
Studies show that the continents lose 24 billion tons of
topsoil each year. Over the last 20 years, as much has been lost
worldwide as covers the entire cropland of the United States.
</P>
<P>
Desertification now damages about 70 percent of the 5,200
million hectares of drylands used for agriculture, or almost 30
percent of the total land area of the world.
</P>
<P>
The economic loss it causes is estimated at 42 billion
U.S. dollars every year. Africa alone accounts for 9 billion
dollars, with over a million hectares, or 73 percent of its
drylands, being affected by desertification.
</P>
<P>
About 5.2 billion hectares of useful drylands worldwide have
already suffered erosion and soil degradation. In all, more than
110 countries have drylands that are potentially at risk of
desertification.
</P>
<P>
The problem affects 1.4 million hectares of drylands in Asia,
and 74 percent of those in North America. France, Greece, Italy,
Spain and Portugal are the five of European Union countries most
severely affected.
</P>
<P>
Climate variations such as drought is viewed as part of the
cause of desertification. However, desertification is essentially
a man-made problem, arising from overuse of land, overgrazing,
poor irrigation methods and deforestation.

<P>
NEW DELHI, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank disclosed today
that the annual losses in India's power sector have exceeded 2
billion US dollars, the Press Trust of India reported.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters here, Kary Nyman, senior energy economist
of the bank said that "owing to a 30,000 mw gap in demand and
supply, the country is heading for longer power cuts which will
hinder industrial growth."
</P>
<P>
Nyman said the projections of power generation in India's
eighth five-year plan (1990-95) had been scaled down from the
initial 48,000 mw to 31,000 due to inadequate resources.
</P>
<P>
He warned that unless something extraordinary happens, the
50,000 mw target projected in the ninth five-year plan (1995-2000)
would also meet the same fate as in the eighth five-year plan.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the power sector be restructured and
privatized.

<HEADLINE> Indian PM Hints at Limited Expansion of Cabinet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister H.D. Deve
Gowda today indicated that a limited expansion of his council of
ministers will take place Wednesday, the Press Trust of India
said.
</P>
<P>
The expansion is designed to induct representatives of the
Communist Party of India (CPI) and Asom Gana Parishad (AGP). The
CPI and AGP, two constituents of the ruling 13-party United Front,
have recently decided to join the government.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters here, Gowda said the expansion, which
would not be a "big one," would take place as early as possible.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether new ministers would be appointed this week, the
prime minister indicated that it might take place after his
one-day trip outside the capital which is scheduled for tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
Gowda appointed only 20 ministers when he was sworn in as prime
minister on June 1. He has deliberately left some vacancies to
attract more constituents of the United Front to join the
government.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The state-owned, foreign-funded
and township enterprises in the Yangtze River Delta area have
experienced rapid development in recent years due to geographic
and various other advantages.
</P>
<P>
The Yangtze River Delta in east China, one of the most
flourishing areas of the country, includes economically prosperous
regions including Shanghai, Jiangsu and Zhejiang.
</P>
<P>
State-owned enterprises in Shanghai are well-managed compared
to those in other parts of the country; the township enterprises
in Jiangsu Province are so strong that they contribute half of the
province's economy, and the private economy continues to grow
swiftly in Zhejiang province.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, Shanghai's gross industrial output value reached 525.3
billion yuan, 37.5 percent of which was scored by its 2,200
state-owned enterprises, 26.6 percent by foreign-funded firms and
35.9 by township enterprises and private sector.
</P>
<P>
Jiangsu has 920,000 township enterprises, which recorded a
gross industrial output value exceeding 800 billion yuan last
year, accounting for 55 percent of the province's total.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang province, whose industrial base used to lag far
behind, is catching up with the rapid development of township
enterprises and private economy.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the province generated a total industrial output value
of 828.4 billion yuan, of which 562.9 billion yuan came from
township enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that more and more enterprises in the delta area
are getting investment from various economic sectors, while the
number of enterprises belonging to a single economic sector is
declining.

education of legal knowledge among its 1.2 billion population over
the next five years in order to facilitate a new system of law in
the country, Justice Minister Xiao Yang said here today.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark at the start of a four-day national
conference sponsored by the Central Propaganda Department of the
Communist Party of China and the Justice Ministry, which will draw
up plans for the third five-year national campaign of this kind.
</P>
<P>
"This campaign will also be crucial for building a country with
the socialist legal system, and creating a sound legal environment
for the country's economic and social development," he said.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years, 700 million of the country's 810
million citizens eligible for education on law have received
education in elementary legal knowledge, according to the
minister. This promotes public awareness on law, and people have
discovered more of their own legal responsibilities and also how
to use law to protect their own rights and interests.
</P>
<P>
Officials, too, are relying more on legal means rather than
solely resorting to administrative measures in policy making and
handling party and government affairs, Xiao added.
</P>
<P>
"Hiring legal experts and lawyers as consultants is now in
vogue among officials and various party and government bodies," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Beijing, Liaoning and Shandong have made resolutions regarding
running local affairs according to law, and efforts to promote the
rule by law have begun in the rest of China's provinces,
autonomous regions and major cities, Xiao said.
</P>
<P>
More than 500 party, government and army officials attended the
national conference.
</P>
<P>
The minister stressed that for the five-year education plan to
be successful, the following points must be made clear in advance:
</P>
<P>
-- Deng Xiaoping's theories on socialist democracy and building
of legal system will be the guiding principle;
</P>
<P>
-- the rule by law and building a country with a socialist
legal system will be the ultimate goal;
</P>
<P>
-- the combination of legal education and legal practices will
be the appropriate orientation; and
</P>
<P>
-- cultivating the public awareness on law will be the
foundmental task.
</P>
<P>
Major targets to receive law education include officials at and
above the county head level, judicial and administrative law
enforcers, business managers, and young people.
</P>
<P>
Law education should be carried out through seminars, lectures,
lecture tours to the countryside and other grass-root units, and
through various other flexible and interesting forms, he said.
</P>
<P>
Xiao urged supervisory bodies be established immediately, and
that an official promotion system be adopted based on knowledge of
law.
</P>
<P>
Xiao said he expected to see good results in building legal
systems by the year 2000 in more than 80 percent of villages and
state-owned enterprises, in 70 percent of other units of the state
sector, in 70 percent of the counties and in 80 percent of
provincial capitals throughout the country.

privately-owned businesses in Shanghai, China's largest industrial
center, have conducted business with 24 countries and regions so
far this year.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu To Visit Egypt, Jordan Following US Trip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister-elect
Benjamin Netanyahu is to visit Egypt and Jordan shortly after his
planned trip to the United States, reported Israel Radio today.
</P>
<P>
It quoted political sources as saying that Netanyahu is
expected to leave for Washington on July 8.
</P>
<P>
Washington is eager to have a summit between President Bill
Clinton and the incoming Israeli prime minister immediately after
the latter takes office, in order to learn about how the rightwing
 Israeli government will deal with the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
But Netanyahu has preferred to make it some time later on the
grounds that he needs more time to prepare for the
trip. Netanyahu is expected to present his government today to the
Knesset (parliament).
</P>
<P>
The sources said that Netanyahu will travel to Cairo and Amman
several days after his return from Washington.
</P>
<P>
Israel's Arab neighbors are deeply concerned over the fate of
the peace process because they believe Netanyahu might slow down
the peace negotiations, if not completely stop them.
</P>
<P>
President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt invited Netanyahu for a visit
soon after his election victory. In acknowledging Egypt's role in
the peace process, Israeli late Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin,
after taking office in 1992, made Egypt as his first choice of
external visit instead of the United States.
</P>
<P>
Following Netanyahu's footsteps abroad, David Levy, foreign
minister apparent for Netanyahu's government, will visit other
Arab countries which have established ties with the Jewish state
in one way or another.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Rallies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar rallied
against major currencies although shock waves of the Sumitomo
incident were still running through the world copper market.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar ended at 79.16 US cents from 78.78 last
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Commodity prices continued to weaken after Japanese trading
company Sumitomo announced losses of 1.8 billion US dollars over
the past decade due to unauthorized copper trading.
</P>
<P>
However, gold prices rallied and sent a mixed signal to
traders. Local traders said that it was difficult to estimate the
movement of the Australian dollar in the next few days.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar was traded at 86.41 yen against the
Japanese currency from 85.55 last Friday.
</P>
<P>
It was also firmer against the German mark, ending at 1.2049
marks from 1.2023 at last week's close.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Govt Blames Economic Depression on Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Finance Minister Anthony
Ani has blamed the country's economic depression on its huge debt
burdens.
</P>
<P>
In an article published in Nigeria's largest newspaper Daily
Times today, the minister put the African Oil Power's foreign
debt at 32.58 billion U.S.Dollars and its domestic debt at 410
billion Naira (five billion U.S. Dollars).
</P>
<P>
Ani said over 10 percent of Nigeria's ''oil dollars'', the
revenue gained from the export of its petroleum products which is
around 10 billion U.S.Dollars annually, has been used during the
past years to service the foreign debts.
</P>
<P>
And despite efforts that had been made to formulate
debt-management measures to liquidate, reschedule, refinance and
service the external debt obligations of the government,
''nothing has been done to address the adverse effects of the
debt owed to local contractors and non-bank public."
</P>
<P>
''While the external debt stock has more economic and
socio-political implications on the nation's economy, the impact
of the domestic debt could not be waved aside,'' said the
minister.
</P>
<P>
The minister called upon the country's foreign debtors to
devote more effort to help relieve the huge debt burdens of the
west African country.
</P>
<P>
He promised that the government would evolve a durable
stragedy ''that would lead to a gradual redemption of the
outstanding debt and check future unrestrained accumulation of
more debt which could cause further economic depression.''

<HEADLINE> China's High Demand for Digital Mobile Communications Apparatus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 17 (Xinhua) -- China's subscribers of mobile
phones with the country's public mobile communication networks
reached nearly 4.57 million by the end of April.
</P>
<P>
Of these consumers, nearly 10 percent, or 438,000, use digital
mobile phones, the "People's Post and Telecommunications Journal"
reported.
</P>
<P>
A survey in Shanghai showed that nearly 69 percent of the
citizens there are in favor of digital mobile phones.
</P>
<P>
High demand for digital mobile phones provides an impetus to
develop the country's market for mobile communication apparatus.
</P>
<P>
China now has many companies that produce digital mobile
communication systems and equipment, including the Siemens
Shanghai Mobile Communications Company, the Shanghai Bell Alcatal
Mobile Communications Company, the Beijing Ericsson Company, the
Beijing Nokia Mobile Communications Company and the Tianjin
Motorola Company.
</P>
<P>
The survey revealed that most of China's mobile communication
equipment currently is imported or produced by Sino-foreign joint
ventures. This helps enrich the country's market, and also urges
China to exert greater efforts to further develop localization of
the equipment in the future.

<HEADLINE> Empress's Seal Found After Theft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, June 17 (Xinhua) -- An rare large seal owned by an
ancient empress and stolen nearly three years ago has been
recovered.
</P>
<P>
The seal, weighing one kilogram, belonged to empress Wudi of
the Northern Zhou Dynasty and dates back 1,400 years ago. It was
taken by grave robbers in September 1993.
</P>
<P>
The relic is said to be the earliest seal belonging to a
Chinese empress ever discovered.
</P>
<P>
The 4.7 cm by 4.45 cm by 4.55 cm seal, or "chop," inscribed
with the empress's name, was buried with the woman and her
husband, Emperor Wudi, in a tomb in Xianyang City near Xi'an in
northwest China, the capital of many dynasties.
</P>
<P>
Robbers also stole many other valuable relics from the
tomb. The stolen artifacts are considered to be clues that can aid
the study of the Southern and Northern Dynasties (420-581), an era
when China was divided as a result of wars between northern tribes
and residents in the central plains.
</P>
<P>
Local police attempted to locate the robbers and finally
captured several of them. But the seal had remained a mystery
until the recent campaign cracking down on crimes, which led to
the arrests of more suspects.
</P>
<P>
According to reports, one of the suspects revealed to
authorities the identity of the thief who was hiding the
seal. Last week, the robber voluntarily surrendered and turned
over the seal to police.
</P>
<P>
Chinese people prefer to own private seals on which their names
are inscribed, used in most cases as a substitute for a
signature. The seals of court members are usually bigger.
</P>
<P>
Authorities did not say if they had found the seal that
belonged to the empress' husband, Emperor Wudi.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Parliamentarian Confident of Easily </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 17 (Xinhua) -- A prominent Iranian parliament
deputy has expressed his confidence that Iran will easily tackle
the new wave of U.S. sanctions which aims to block Iran's access
to industrial technologies.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. secondary sanctions might be useful for the
U.S. presidential elections, but it will not push forward
Washington's hostile policies against Iran, Mohammad Javad
Larijani, former chairman of the foreign affairs commission of the
parliament, said in a report published today.
</P>
<P>
He said "although the sanctions may have some impact initially,
they will not affect our economy significantly."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. chain threats against Iran unveiled through bills
presented in Congress aim to reduce Iran's oil revenues with its
secondary sanctions which target non-American oil companies
investing in Iran, he said.
</P>
<P>
Larijani noted in a report carried by Tehran Times that
Washington's bullying policy is doomed to fail not only with
respect to Iran's infrastructural projects carried out during the
First Five-Year Plan (1989-1994), but also because of the new
trends in the post-cold war era.
</P>
<P>
To the surprise of U.S. politicians, Islamic Iran has restored
relations with the Republics of the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. House of Representatives' Ways and Means Committee
approved a bill by voice vote Thursday after week of negotiations
with White House officials, House and Senate Republican
leaders. The bill requires U.S. President Bill Clinton to impose
sanctions on any foreign company that invests 40 million
U.S. dollars or more in Iranian oil and gas development.
</P>
<P>
Larijani stressed that the announced U.S. punitive measures
against companies investing in Iran's oil sector will not affect
Tehran more than a sting.
</P>
<P>
In its announced secondary sanctions, the U.S. has targeted
Iran's oil industry and customers and will block Iran's access to
various technologies.
</P>
<P>
He said that European countries showed negative reactions to
the U.S. announced sanctions against Iran and Cuba because the
American policy will jeopardize the interests of many countries.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. move will not only harm U.S. ties with its European
allies, but will also undermine the principles of the World Trade
Organization and international security, he added.

<HEADLINE> China Marks World Day to Combat Desertification, Drought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Desert-control officials, experts
and students have appealed for more efforts to curb
desertification and drought in China.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was made during a public awareness campaign held in
downtown Beijing to mark the World Day to Combat Desertification
and Drought, which is today.
</P>
<P>
At a publicity gathering held at the Nationality Culture
Palace, Zhu Guangyao, vice-minister of forestry, said the
situation against desertification in China is "still very grave,"
as desert area is expanding faster than it is controlled.
</P>
<P>
He called for increased awareness regarding environmental
protection, especially from leading government officials, and more
investment in desertification control projects.
</P>
<P>
Desertification control experts and students from Beijing
Forestry University offered passers-by information including the
current edition of "China Forestry News" and pictures featuring
desertification control in China.
</P>
<P>
About 13 million ha of farmland is affected by desertification
and cannot provide stable grain output. Nearly 100 million ha of
grassland has degenerated.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of large water conservancy facilities, 800 km of
railway lines and several thousand km of highway are under threat
of shifting sand.
</P>
<P>
China's desert region covers 3.32 million sq.km., about 34
percent of the country's total land, mostly in northwest China,
north China and northeast China, according to the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Similar activities were held in areas near Wangfujing, the
busiest shopping center in the capital, and the Beijing Exhibition
Center.
</P>
<P>
About 10 million ha of trees planted during the past 40 years
to contain desertification have survived, and have helped protect
11 million ha of farmland, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
About 1.3 million ha of farmland has been recovered from desert
areas and regions deeply affected by desertification.
</P>
<P>
China launched a national desertification control project in
1991, listing 20 counties as major desert-control areas. Since
then, desertification control has been included as part of the
national social and economic development program.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Dissatisfied with Results of Polls: Top Aide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin is
dissatisfied with results of the first round of voting in Russia's
presidential elections Sunday, because he wished to win the
elections in the first round, a top Kremlin aide said today.
</P>
<P>
According to preliminary results released by the Central
Electoral Commission, Yeltsin and Communist Party leader Gennady
Zyuganov took the leads in the polls, with 35.02 and 31.53 percent
of the votes respectively.
</P>
<P>
Retired General Alexander Lebed took the third place to become
the "dark horse" in the elections by winning 14.89 percent of the
votes.
</P>
<P>
Under Russia's election law, if none of the presidential
hopefuls gets more than 50 percent of the votes in the first
round, a second round of voting will be held to elect the
president.
</P>
<P>
Viktor Ilyushin, first aide to Yeltsin and one of the leaders
of his election campaign, told reporters that "only the disunity
of democrats prevented Yeltsin from winning in the first round of
the elections."
</P>
<P>
Ilyushin said that Yeltsin would shortly hold a series of
meetings with other candidates who have lost the elections in the
first round, and the latter may advance definite terms including
those linked with a reshuffle of the government.
</P>
<P>
"President Yeltsin called a conference here this morning. It
began at 07:00 and lasted about 40 minutes. Proposals were tabled

<HEADLINE> Kuwait to Set up National Investment Fund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait is planning to set up a
new National Investment Fund aimed at diversifying its current
sole oil-reliant economy, according to official sources.
</P>
<P>
This came from a meeting of the Kuwait Investment Authority
(KIA) Board of Directors attended by Minister of Oil Abdul Mohsen
Madaj, Governor of Kuwait Central Bank Sheikh Salemm Al-Sabah and
other financial and business leaders in the country, the local
English-language newspaper Arab Times reported today.

Reserve.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> China to Conduct Pollution Survey of Rural Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 17 (Xinhua) -- China will conduct the first
pollution survey of its 20 million rural firms by the end of this
year, according to a top environmental protection official.
</P>
<P>
Xie Zhenhua, director of the State Bureau of Environmental
Protection (SBEP), said, "pollution caused by rural industry is
one of the major environmental pollution facing China."
</P>
<P>
Xie said the survey, the first of its kind in China, will be
jointly launched by the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of
Finance, the State Statistics Bureau and the SBEP.
</P>
<P>
Previous annual reports on China's environmental situation
since 1989 do not include the amount of the pollutants discharged
by the rural firms, said Xie.
</P>
<P>
He said the figures in the report contain only the amount of
pollutants produced by industrial firms at and above county level.
</P>
<P>
With about 120 million employees, rural firms are normally
owned by villages, small towns, or individuals, and are below
county level.
</P>
<P>
Most of the rural firms have been established since the late
1970s, when China introduced the policy of reform and opening to
the outside world.
</P>
<P>
Despite their contributions to rural industrialization and the
120 million jobs they create, the rural firms' rapid development
is to blame for much of the country's environmental issues.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of pollutive plants, mostly small paper-making
factories, along the Huaihe River, one of the country's leading
rivers, have been closed, and more should be closed, according to
a plan approved by the central government to clean the polluted
river by 1997.
</P>
<P>
Rural firms are expected to face more pressure to reduce their
pollution during the next five years.
</P>
<P>
China is preparing its fourth national environmental protection
conference, which will discuss ways to implement environmental
protection laws and regulations and maintain the annual discharge
of 12 major pollutants at or below that recorded in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Reorganizes Commission on Filipinos Overseas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
today reorganized the Commission on Filipinos Overseas to address
the problems they and their dependents may face.
</P>
<P>
According to a government press release, Ramos expand the
membership of the commission to include the Department of Justice
and the Department of Education, Culture and Sports. Counseling
desks will be established in Philippine embassies and consulates
in areas where there is a high concentration of Filipinos.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said that the Department of Justice will provide "the
legal dimension in matters of Filipino migration."
</P>
<P>
The Department of Education, Culture and Sports will share in
the responsibility of promoting the education of the children of
Filipino migrants and cultivate awareness of Filipino culture and
institutions overseas.
</P>
<P>
The commission will be composed of the secretary of foreign
affairs as chairman, the secretary of trade and industry as vice
chairman, the secretary of tourism, the secretary of education and
culture and sports, the secretary of justice and the press
secretary.
</P>
<P>
The late president Ferdinand Marcos set off the exodus in 1974
when, facing economic disaster, he mobilized Filipinos to go
abroad to earn hard currency and reduce unemployment. Of a
population of nearly 70 million, some 3.5 million Filipinos now
work overseas, according to official figures.
</P>
<P>
Many Filipinos view working overseas as an economic necessity.
But as they fuel prosperity both at home and abroad, migrant
workers pay a high social price. As the number of women migrants
has increased in the last decades, so have the cases of abuses,
sexual abuses in particular.

<HEADLINE> "Dark Horse" in Russian Presidential Elections: Lebed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Retired General Alexander Lebed, a
law-and-order advocator, became a "dark horse" Sunday in Russia's
presidential elections, as he ensured himself a comfortable third
place with over 15 percent of the votes.
</P>
<P>
The general will become a decisive factor as a "third force" in
the inevitable second round competition between incumbent
President Boris Yeltsin and his major rival -- Communist leader
Gennady Zyuganov, observers here said.
</P>
<P>
Lebed, 46, a career army officer, one of the youngest
contenders in the race, became known in the country when he was
appointed commander of the 14th Russian army in Moldova and ended
the bloody conflict between the former Soviet republic and its
breakaway Dniester region.
</P>
<P>
The general was forced to retire from the armed forces for his
public criticism of the Chechen war and the poor military reform.
</P>
<P>
Last December, he was elected to the State Duma (the lower
house of the Russian parliament) to gain his first political
experience.
</P>
<P>
Now in his current election platform, he promised to fight
crimes, reform the military and improve banking and tax systems.
</P>
<P>
So when Yeltsin and Zyuganov enter the second round
competition, votes of plausible Lebed are bound "to go to the
present president" by large numbers, Yeltsin's political aide
Georgy Satarov said.
</P>
<P>
Duma Vice-Speaker Alexander Shokhin predicted that Lebed will
form an alliance with Yeltsin and did not rule out that he would
be offered a government portfolio if Yeltsin wins.

MOSCOW, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
today urged supporters of other candidates, including retired
general Alexander Lebed, to back him in the second round of the
presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
In a televised address to the nation on the results of the
first round of the polls on Sunday, Yeltsin stressed that it is
now absolutely clear what choices the country is facing: "Either
back to revolutions and tumult, or forward to stability and
welfare."

<P>
"Today, as never before, we must be united, Regardless of
differences, we have one Motherland. One Russia. Together we
shall win," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said results of the Sunday polls showed that "free, direct
and fair elections have taken place in Russia."

He urged supporters of Lebed, liberal economist Grigory
Yavlinsky and famous eye-surgeon Svyatoslav Fyodorov to unite in
support of his "democratic reforms."
</P>

In the first round of the voting held across Russia on Sunday,

<HEADLINE> Zyuganov Narrows Gap With Yeltsin in Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Russian Communist Party leader
Gennady Zyuganov has slightly narrowed the gap with incumbent
President Boris Yeltsin in votes in the presidential elections as
some 72 percent of the 51 million votes have been counted.
</P>
<P>
According to figure by the Central Electoral Commission
released at 07:00 Moscow time (03:00 GMT) today, Zyuganov, the
main rival of Yeltsin for Kremlin, was less than two percentage
points behind Yeltsin by obtaining 32.45 percent of the counted
votes as against Yeltsin's 34.27 percent.
</P>
<P>
Votes won by the other candidates are as follows:
</P>
<P>
Alexander Lebed -- 15.39;
</P>
<P>
Grigory Yavlinsky -- 7.76;
</P>
<P>
Vladimir Zhirinovsky -- 6.36;
</P>
<P>
Svyatoslav Fyodorov 0.96;
</P>
<P>
Mikhail Gorbachev -- 0.51;
</P>
<P>
Martin Shakkum -- 0.36;
</P>
<P>
Yuri Vlasov -- 0.19;
</P>
<P>
Vladimir Bryntsalov -- 0.16.
</P>
<P>
Earlier results from the Commission showed that Yeltsin was
leading with 35 percent, followed by Zyuganov with 32 percent, of
the votes counted that occupied about 55 percent of all.
</P>
<P>
The Commission said that some 1.58 percent of the voters voted
for none of the 10 candidates.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin and Zyuganov remain the two leading candidates in the
election who might run a second round if neither of them get more
than half of the votes.
</P>
<P>
Lebed, a retired general who advocates law-and-order for
Russia, was the only "dark horse" in Sunday's elections by
ensuring himself a comfortable third place with 15.39 percent of
votes.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Olympic Committee Reiterates Anti-Doping Stance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Olympic Committee
(COC) on Monday reiterated its anti-doping stand and attacked
doping charges against Chinese athletes from Australia and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
"We have been abiding by the 3S principle in the fight against
drugs, namely, strict prohibition, strict examination and strict
punishment," said Wei Jizhong, general secretary of the Chinese
Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
"From 1995 to now, no Chinese athlete has tested positive in
international competitions," Wei said. "But some countries are
still accusing Chinese athletes of doping even if they have their
own athletes caught using drugs."
</P>
<P>
"Australia and the United States have their athletes tested
positive in the years running to the Atlanta Games," the general
secretary said. "At the same time they are the most vocal in the
criticism of Chinese athletes.
</P>
<P>
"Once Chinese athletes have good performance, some countries
say they might have used drugs. When their performance is down,
these countries say they might have stopped using drugs, it's
really ridiculous."
</P>
<P>
Australian women swimmer Samantha Riley caused an uproar in
February as she walked away only with a "stern warning" from the
world swimming governing body FINA even though she tested positive
at the world short-course championships in Brazil last December.
</P>
<P>
The American Swimming Association followed the suit by freeing
teenage swimmer Jessica Foschi, who had been serving a two-year
ban for taking steroids.
</P>
<P>
Quite a few countries including China have accused Australia
and the United States of applying "double standards" in the
handling of doping cases.
</P>
<P>
Asia's biggest drug scandal this year came from Japan as the
nation's top men's 100-meter sprint champion Yoshitaka Ito was
banned for four years for taking performance-enhancing drugs.
</P>
<P>
"Look at these positive cases in Australia, the United States
and Japan, you will draw a conclusion that doping is now a
universal problem," Wei said. "All the countries and regions in
the world should join their efforts to achieve a clean Olympics."
</P>
<P>
According to the COC's anti-doping commission, 995 tests have
been conducted in the previous six months, 35 percent more than
the same period of time last year.
</P>
<P>
Among these domestic tests, 490 are out-of-competition, double
the number same time last year.
</P>
<P>
The commission said that most of the tests were conducted in
the events of track and field, swimming, weightlifting, cycling,
rowing, canoeing and judo and 501 tests came from track and field
and swimming.
</P>
<P>
World-known athletes like women's distance runner Wang Junxia
and shotputter Li Meisu, women's swimmer Le Jingyi and Chen Yan
have been checked at least four times this year and none has
turned out positive, said Shi Kangcheng, an official from the
Chinese anti-doping commission.
</P>
<P>
In the year of 1995, 13 athletes had tested positive in the
domestic doping checks.
</P>
<P>
"Most of the offenders caught last year were from local teams,"
Shi said.

<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, June 17 (Xinhua) -- It's no surprise to a mother when
her child calls her "Mommy," but Lai Yushan was so excited she
cried when her only daughter first said the word at the age of
three.
</P>
<P>
Lai's daughter, Wang Xue, was diagnosed with nervous deafness
when she was just six months old. Her hearing loss reached 115 to
120 decibels.
</P>
<P>
Little Wang Xue was sent to Hainan Provincial Language Recovery
Center for Deaf Children when she was three years old.
</P>
<P>
After more than two years' training, Wang Xue now can tell
people her name, age, what her parents' jobs are and where her
family lives. She also can read and describe illustrated stories
and engage in simple conversation with her parents and teachers.
</P>
<P>
Wang Xue is one of the more than 340 deaf children who have
recovered their hearing ability in south China's Hainan Province
in the past five years. Four of them entered normal primary
schools after training.
</P>
<P>
Hainan's Provincial Federation for the Disabled has organized
language recovery centers in cities and counties throughout the
province since 1989.
</P>
<P>
Many of these recovered children have ambitious plans.
</P>
<P>
Wang Xue, now six, said that she wants to be an airplane pilot
when she grows up.

<HEADLINE> Volcano Eruption Continues in NZ </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Mt. Ruapehu in New Zealand's
central North Island is now in constant eruption after the volcano
burst into life this morning, Television NZ reported this evening.
</P>
<P>
Scientists have rated the eruption alert level at three on the
five level scale. They said the volcano has not rumbled as fierce
as its last eruption in September 1995, when the alert level was
put at four.
</P>
<P>
They said the eruption might continue until Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Four airports around the volcano have been closed, forcing
three airlines to alter their schedules.
</P>
<P>
Mt. Ruapehu, the highest mountain on North Island, is an ideal
place for winter skiing in NZ. But this year's ski season has been
ruined by the eruption.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Conservation have evacuated skifield staff
and closed all roads to the field. The skifield will remain closed
until volcanic activity is carefully assessed, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The mountain began to wake up this morning, sending plumes of
ash and steam several thousand meters into the air.

<HEADLINE> China Hopes to Lead Second Echelon in Atlanta Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 17 (Xinhua/OANA) -- By sending off a 495-member
delegation, China hopes to lead the second echelon in the medal
tally in the upcoming Olympic Games in Atlanta, sports authorities
said here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"While the United States, Germany and Russia are sure to retain
their top spots in the medal tally, China, one of some 10 members
in the second echelon, hopes to finish atop in the group in
Atlanta," said Yuan Weimin, vice president of the Chinese Olympic
delegation.
</P>
<P>
"It's a tough challenge for the Chinese athletes since all
members in the group are strong enough to grab some 10 gold medals
in Atlanta," Yuan added.
</P>
<P>
Among the echelon are South Korea who reportedly vowed to win
15 gold medals and Cuba that aimed to grab 16 golds to retain its
fifth spot, two more than the 14 gold medals won in Barcelona.
</P>
<P>
The group also includes Spain and Australia, both hope to win
more than 12 gold medals to their credits.
</P>
<P>
And Italy also surged ahead by grabbing 16 gold medals in the
international arena last year, overtaking China for the fourth
spot.
</P>
<P>
Four years ago in Barcelona, China bagged 16 gold medals for
its fourth overall place, a far cry from third-placer Germany that
won 34 gold medals.
</P>
<P>
In Atlanta, the 110 Chinese men athletes and their 200 women
peers will compete in 153 events in 22 out of the 26 sports.
</P>
<P>
And China pins its medal hopefuls in its traditional strong
events of table tennis, diving, gymnastics and shooting upon
world-known paddlers Deng Yaping, Qiao Hong, Liu Wei, Wang Tao, Lu
Lin and Kong Linhui, and shooter Wang Yifu and its slender and
flexible divers.
</P>
<P>
"We also hope to reap gold medals in some events of the track
and field, swimming, judo and badminton competitions which China
enjoyes its upperhands," said Yuan.
</P>
<P>
The strongest events for China include the walking race, the
5,000m and 10,000m events and shot put, all of women action, in
the track and field.
</P>
<P>
And the medal hopefuls are Wang Junxia, Gao Hongmiao, Gu Yan,
Wang Yan and Huang Zhihong.
</P>
<P>
Chinese women swimmers Le Jingyi, Shan Yin and Liu Limin also
are tipped to win gold medals from the swimming pool in the 50m,
100m freestyle events and the 4x100m medley relay.
</P>
<P>
Judo players in the women's 48-kg, 72-kg and over 72-kg
categories, and women's badminton players are also strong enough
to reap some medals, even golds, in the Olympic games.
</P>
<P>
Other medal hopefuls for China are the 54-kg, 70-kg class
weightlifting, women's archery, yachting and rowing competitions.

<HEADLINE> Bulls Wins Fourth NBA Championship by Ousting Sonics 4-2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Michael Jordan scored 22 points
and Dennis Rodman pulled down 19 rebounds as the Chicago Bulls
beat Seattle SuperSonics 87-75 at home and clinched the
championship in Game 6 of the NBA Finals on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
It was the fourth NBA title for the Bulls in six years and the
first since Jordan returned the game from a 18-month retirement
after their third NBA title in 1993.
</P>
<P>
After jumping to a 3-0 lead, the Bulls lost the 4th and 5th
games in Seattle in a row. But they finished their season on
Sunday with an excellent all-around game when five Bulls players
came out in double figures and they also out-rebounded the Sonics
51-35.
</P>
<P>
After the final buzzer, Jordan lay face down on the court,
clutching the game ball as his teammates celebrated around him.
</P>
<P>
Jordan also had nine rebounds and seven assists, and was named
the finals' most valuable player.
</P>
<P>
Chicago's championship came on a home court where the Bulls won
49 games and lost only twice. The Bulls set an NBA record with 72
regular-season wins and was 15-3 in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
Scottie Pippen, who struggled with his shooting touch through
the first five games, came back with 17 points, eight rebounds,
five assists, four steals and three 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
Rodman, who tied his own NBA Finals record with 11 offensive
rebounds, added nine points, five assists and three more of
Chicago's 14 steals.

<HEADLINE> Treaty with India Opens Power Market for Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Nepal's accord with India on the
development of a border river has ensured its power market in
India, Nepali Water Resources Minister Pashupati Shumsher Rana
said.
</P>
<P>
The Mahakali treaty was a watershed in Nepal-India cooperation
on water resources development, setting a guiding principle for
future projects in the field, Rana said here Sunday at a program
on Nepal's water resources development.
</P>
<P>
The treaty, signed by Nepali Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba
and his Indian counterpart P.V. Narasimha Rao in New Delhi last
February has also opened door for foreign investment into the
power sector in Nepal, he added.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, Nepal had forced India to make some
major concessions in the treaty on the integrated development of
Mahakali river, which lies on Nepal's western border.
</P>
<P>
He said the treaty had established the rights of Nepal in the
utilization of the waters of the border river.
</P>
<P>
Under the treaty, Nepal could receive irrigation water from
India's already-completed Tanakpur project on the river plus the
payments for 70 million kilowatt-hours of power every year.
</P>
<P>
The Mahakali treaty will take effect only after being ratified
by the Nepali parliament which is to open its new session later
this month.
</P>
<P>
It is uncertain whether the treaty would be approved by the
parliament as the biggest party in the parliament and the main
opposition Communist Party of Nepal (UML) has not announced its
final stance over the treaty.
</P>
<P>
However, the opposition party had hailed the treaty as a
success soon after it was reached earlier this year.

<HEADLINE> hke061715#-#-India's Economy Poised for High Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 17 (Xinhua) -- India's economy is expected to
grow between 6.5 and 7 percent during the financial year of
1996-97, the National Herald reported today.
</P>
<P>
The figure was released by the Federation of Indian Chambers of
Commerce and Industry (FICCI) after making an assessment of the
country's economic prospect in early June.
</P>
<P>
The FICCI noted that the growth prospects of 6.5 to 7 percent
is dependent on a number of macro economic variables, especially
the stability of the administered prices and other non-economic
factors like political stability and social harmony.
</P>
<P>
According to FICCI estimate, the industry is poised to grow
between 11 and 12 percent even after the slowdown in the growth of
capital goods industry which has nose-dived from a peak of 25
percent in 1994-95 to around 20 percent in 1995-96
(April-January).
</P>
<P>
The growth in agriculture, which was only 1.5 percent during
1995-1996, is estimated to fall somewhere between 2.5 and 3
percent during 1996-97.
</P>
<P>
Services sector, which is growing between 6 to 7 percent in the
last three years, is expected to grow 7 percent in 1996-97 with
the prospects of larger investment in the telecom, development of
the tourism sector and growth in transport sector.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the foreign exchange reserves for 1996-97 will be
about 20 billion US dollars compared with the 17.6 billion at the
end of March 1996, the FICCI said.

<HEADLINE> Most Singaporeans Oppose Rejoining Malaysia: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, June 17 (Xinhua) -- About six out of ten
Singaporeans polled were against the idea of Singapore rejoining
Malaysia, an issue raised by Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew when
answering a question from the local press ten days ago.
</P>
<P>
A survey carried out by the Straits Times, which published the
results today, found that those who were opposing the idea wanted
the Republic of Singapore to retain its identity and hoped that it
could stand on its own feet.
</P>
<P>
The poll also found that nearly 30 percent of the respondents
were in favor of the merger as they believed that it would bring
benefits to Singapore, such as more land and natural resources.
</P>
<P>
The remaining one percent either said they might be supportive
of merger if it brought real advantages, or that they had no
comments on the matter, the Straits Times said.
</P>
<P>
Those who were polled were asked questions relating to Senior
Minister Lee's remarks that Singapore might rejoin Malaysia if
certain conditions were met.
</P>
<P>
The conditions included that Malaysia should adopt the same
policy of meritocracy as Singapore had, without any race being in
a privileged position, and that Malaysia pursue, as successfully,
the same goals as Singapore to bring maximum economic benefit to
its people.
</P>
<P>
Of the 100 interviewed, 64 were against the said merger. They
said Singapore should retain its separate identity; Singapore had
been chased out of Malaysia before and, as a matter of pride,
should not go back to the mainland, especially as it was now doing
well economically.
</P>
<P>
There were also worries about instability arising from any
merger, and some said that they did not want to be "second-class
citizens" controlled by the bigger state, while some others said
that the differences in lifestyle and political system would be
hard to bridge.
</P>
<P>
The majority of the 27 supportive of merger pointed out that it
would mean more land and natural resources, while others said that
it would be good to "spread out" the competition in Singapore
which made life "too intense".

<HEADLINE> Leading Party Initiates Talks in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's Awami (people's) League
(AL) has initiated talks with leaders of other political parties
in the country in order to reach nationwide consensus on the
formation of an AL government.
</P>
<P>
This was a move to forge a national consensus, one of AL's
major pledges in Bangladesh's seventh parliamentary elections,
sources here said.
</P>
<P>
AL President Sheikh Hasina had a telephone conversation with
Workers Party General Secretary Rashed Khan Menon Sunday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Later in the evening, she had hour-long talks with some leaders
of the Jatiya (national) Party (JP), the third largest party in
the election held last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The JP team, including Secretary General Anwar Hossain Manju,
Jailed JP chairman H. M. Ershad's youngest brother G.M. Quader and
Ershad's lawyer Barrister Rafique Al Huq and some others,
reaffirmed JP's support for forming the AL government, according
to sources close to the AL.
</P>
<P>
"Yes, of course, we have lent support to the AL," the JP
secretary general confirmed.
</P>
<P>
Political observers here believe the talks were crucial after
some other influential JP leaders denied a statement issued
Saturday by JP Acting Chairman Mizanur Rahman Chowdhury and the
secretary general, in which the JP's support to the AL was
expressed.
</P>
<P>
Hasina would continue dialogue with leaders of other political
parties to make the incoming government more accountable and
transparent, AL sources said.
</P>
<P>
According to the official announcement by the Election
Commission Sunday, the AL has become the leading party in the
country by winning 134 parliamentary seats while its arch rival,
the ex-ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), won 104 seats
and the JP won 29 seats.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Leads in Russian Presidential Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Boris Yeltsin was leading today in
Russia's presidential elections over his rival Gennady Zyuganov,
with about 55 percent of the vote counted.
</P>
<P>
Results from the Central Electoral Commission show that Yeltsin
was leading with 35 percent, followed by Zyuganov with 32 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, with neither Yeltsin nor Zyuganov expected to win half
the vote for a first-round victory, a second round in July seems
unavoidable, in which voters for other candidates play a key role.
</P>
<P>
Former general Alexander Lebed was running third with 15
percent.
</P>
<P>
Liberal economist Grigory Yavlinsky was in fourth place with 8
percent and nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky was fifth with 7
percent.
</P>
<P>
Five other candidates, including former Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev, received a total of less than 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
This is Russia's second presidential elections in which 70
percent of the 105 million voters cast ballots.
</P>
<P>
The country's first election was held in 1991, in which Yeltsin
was elected with 57 percent of the vote.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Considers Tax Cut to Attract Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The Thai Finance Ministry is
considering to reduce its corporate income tax from 30 percent to
27 percent in a bid to attract big foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
The tax reduction would make Thailand more competitive than
other countries, Thai Finance Minister Bodi Chunnananda was quoted
as saying by local newspapers today.
</P>
<P>
The Revenue Department under the ministry will complete its
study on possible consequences of the proposed tax cut within two
weeks to ensure effectiveness of the measure.
</P>
<P>
To make up for the drop in revenue after the corporate tax cut,
the ministry is planning to increase its value-added tax from 7
percent to 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Bodi said that each one percentage reduction in corporate tax
would mean an 8 billion baht (320 million US dollars) drop in tax
revenue and the ministry hoped that this would be made up by
raising value-added tax.
</P>
<P>
Corporate tax accounted for 35 percent of Thailand's total tax
revenues of 444.2 billion baht (17.8 billion US dollars) last
year.

<HEADLINE> Farmer with 7 Internal Organs Removed Still Alive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, June 17 (Xinhua) -- A cancer patient in south
China's Guangdong Province has survived a series of operations
that involved the removal of seven internal organs and the
transplantation of four.
</P>
<P>
Liang Jinghe, 38, a farmer from Conghua County, underwent a
multi-organ transplant in the Nanfang Hospital of the No.1
Military Medical College on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
It took doctors 21 hours to remove all seven cancerous organs
and to transplant four new organs into the patient.
</P>
<P>
Doctors said the operations were successful, and the patient
was conscious and sleeping peacefully.
</P>
<P>
Five years ago, Liang had a malignant tumor removed from his
liver. In 1993, he was re-diagnosed with cancer and sent to the
hospital.
</P>
<P>
Doctors then decided to remove seven of his internal organs,
including the liver, gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, stomach,
duodenum and right adrenal gland.
</P>
<P>
They transplanted four organs -- his liver, gallbladder,
pancreas and duodenum.
</P>
<P>
So far, China has reported only one case of multi-organ
transplantation.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Thailand is expected later this
month to operate a new structure of commission fees on securities
trading, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Under the new structure which has been approved by The Stock
Exchange of Thailand (SET), local brokerage and sub-brokerage
firms could negotiate commission fees with their foreign clients.
</P>
<P>
Local brokerage and sub-brokerage firms could also negotiate
commission rates among themselves. Yet local small investors
still have to pay 0.5 percent commission.
</P>
<P>
The new structure proposal has been sent to the Securities and
Exchange Commission for approval.
</P>
<P>
After the structure goes into effect, a new round of brokerage
seats will be opened as a move to liberalize the local brokerage
industry.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 17 (Xinhua) -- China now has 400 chain store
companies running a total of 6,000 retail outlets, which generated
sales volume of 8 billion yuan last year -- about 5 percent of the
country's total retail sales volume.
</P>
<P>
However, in 1994, there were just 150 such companies with 2,500
outlets, and three billion yuan in sales volume, today's China
Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The stores, mostly in cities, have won the hearts of customers
for their convenience and efficiency and their role in ensuring
the availability of goods at competitive prices.
</P>
<P>
Developing chain stores is one of the major tasks to help
modernize the country's commodity distribution system and the
retail market sector during the Ninth five-Year Plan period
(1996-2000), according to Chen Bangzhu, minister of internal
trade.
</P>
<P>
Regulations now being drafted to guide and govern development
of chain stores around the country are expected to be issued in
the latter half of the year, according to the Ministry of Internal
Trade, which is also prepearing to set up an association to promote
co-operation and exchanges between chain store companies.

<HEADLINE> Railway Worker Catches 160 Suspects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Liu Baosen is a model worker at a
railway junction in north China's Tianjin City. But he is better
known for his knack for picking out law-breakers from passing
crowds.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, Liu has caught more than 160 crooks.
</P>
<P>
Liu works at a railway junction of the North Tianjin Railway
Station, through which streams of people pass daily. He can spot
suspicious people in the crowds based on their appearance, actions,
the time they appear, and what they have with them.
</P>
<P>
At 8:20 on the morning of November 15, 1995, he noticed a young
man hurriedly pushing a bicycle along the railroad. Liu greeted
him and discovered that the fellow had a northeast China accent,
and that the bicycle lock was damaged. At Liu's suggestion, the
young man was taken to a local police station and found to have
escaped from a local reform center four days earlier.
</P>
<P>
Liu spends most holidays catching criminals. Once, he found
that a truck driver was selling a truckload of equipment to a
private recycling station at low prices. Liu wrote down the
licence number of the truck and notified police. An investigation
proved that the truck driver had stolen boiler parts from the
factory he worked in.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Wants to Open Consulate in Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Thailand wants to open a consulate
in Da Nang province in central Vietnam to promote trade and
investment since two potential routes linking Thailand, Laos and
Vietnam have been developed.
</P>
<P>
According to the Bangkok Post today, the suggestion was made by
Thai Deputy Foreign Minister Charas Puachuay Sunday after he led a
four-day survey of Asia highways No.8 and No.9 from Thailand to
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
The Manila-based Asian Development Bank has recommended these
two east-west corridor routes become development priorities for
greater Mekong sub-region cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Thailand and Laos recently agreed in principle to build bridges
across the Mekong river in Mukdahan and Nakon Phanom provinces,
northeast Thailand, respectively.
</P>
<P>
"Establishing a Thai consulate general will help oversee Thai
interests in central Vietnam once the two routes are upgraded in
line with the potential of trade, investment and tourism," said
Charas.
</P>
<P>
Thailand now has a consulate in Ho Chi Minh city while Vietnam
has its consulate in Khon Kaen province, northeast Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The Thai embassy in Hanoi is also responsible for overseeing
Thai interests in central Vietnam.

<TEXT>
<P>
YAOUNDE, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan stars showed top
performances on the last day of the African Athletics
Championships on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Olympic hopeful Paul Koech claimed a thrilling 5,000m race with
13 minute and 24.78 seconds, ahead of compatriot Simon Kipruto
(13:35.13), giving Kenya's men a clean sweep of golds from 800 to
10,000m, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Fred Onyancha then took Sunday's 800m in 1:46.69 before he was
emulated in the women's event by Naomi Mugo, who timed 2:02.8.
</P>
<P>
Mugo, the 18-year-old who was third in the World Cross-country
Championship earlier this year, thus secured a 800 and 1,500m
double.
</P>
<P>
Koech, fourth in the cross-country showpiece in Cape Town after
beating Ethiopia's Haile Gebreselassie in the process, teamed up
with Kipruto to produce a Kenyan classic.
</P>
<P>
A surge as early as 800 meters from the start split the race
and the Kenyan pair produced one attack after another to destroy
the opposition well before the halfway mark.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria, specialising in the sprint and hurdles events, ended
at the top of the medal table, however, with nine golds, four
silvers and two bronzes to Kenya's total of eight golds, six
silvers and three bronze.
</P>
<P>
Tunisa was thied in the medal tally with six golds and three
bronze.
</P>
<P>
Most of Africa's superpowers had sent juniors and reserve
runners to the championships to allow their major names to
continue training for the Olympic games next month. Ethiopia
pulled out altogether at the last minute.
</P>
<P>
There was no single African record broken during the meeting.

<P>
BEIJING, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government is to
allocate up to 2.5 billion yuan to fund a higher education drive,
today's "China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
Local departments, enterprises and universities are also being
encouraged to help finance "Project 211", the newspaper quoted a
State Education Commission (SEC) spokesman as saying.
</P>
<P>
The project, which was launched by the SEC in 1994 and

aims to turn 100 selected colleges and universities into talent
training centers for the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
So far, 66 colleges and universities have been selected for
their improved teaching quality and facilities, after more than
one year's appraisal by the SEC and Chinese educational experts.
</P>
<P>
They are managed by the SEC and ministries across the country
and cover the fields of industry, agriculture, forestry, economy,
finance, medicine, aviation, national defence, transportation and
telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
Another 24 will be chosen by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
The SEC will then begin to improve courses important to economy
and national defence development, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Selected universities are expected to set up research centers
to help boost the country's economy, science and technology
progress and national defence construction.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 17 (Xinhua) -- More Beijingers will jump into
cool water to escape heat waves and have leisure time as more new
swimming pools open to the public this summer.
</P>
<P>
Some 203 indoor and outdoor swimming pools will start business
by this month, expected to receive ten million people, according
to "China Daily" today.
</P>
<P>
The number is 15 more than that of last year, the report quoted
Ding Bin, an official from the sports department of the Beijing
Sports Committee, as saying, "but the number is still not enough
to meet the growing demand for pools."
</P>
<P>
The sports committee has called for more pools belonged to
schools, enterprises and other units to open to the public, Ding
said.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to give local residents a cleaner and safer
swimming environment, attention have been paid to improving water
quality and strengthening swimming safety, Ding noted.
</P>
<P>
Local health departments have been making on-the-spot
inspections of water safety since April.
</P>
<P>
About 260 lifeguards and 270 swimming coaches received the
on-the-job training conducted by the sports committee in April.
</P>
<P>
"Only those who have reached professional standards set by the
committee can be employed by swimming pools as lifeguards or
coaches," the report said.
</P>
<P>
Last year six swimmers, including a six-year-old boy, died in
drowning accidents which occurred in outdoor or indoor swimming
pools in the city, it said.

GUANGZHOU, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Guangzhou, capital city of south
China's Guangdong Province, has seen its legal service booming,

</P>
<P>
Half of the 60 law offices are independently managed,

self-development, as a result of the reform of lawyers system.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 city's lawyers participated in negotiationing
all 30 major investment projects in the city, each of which
absorbed at least 30 million US dollars of foreign investment.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> China Stresses Environmental Education Among Students </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 17 (Xinhua) -- All of the nation's universities
and colleges are required to offer classes on environmental
protection, according to speakers at a national conference on
environmental education.
</P>
<P>
The move aims to have every university student understand the
basics of environmental science and to cultivate their interests
so that they will participate in environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
According to the national working meeting on environmental
education opening in Xiamen City, east China's Fujian Province,
China has made tremendous achievements in advancing the education
of environmental sciences. Many of the students who previously
showed little interest in the field have now majored in it.
</P>
<P>
So far, China has more than 20,000 undergraduates and 1,200
post-graduates who are majors of ecology and environmental
sciences.
</P>
<P>
In 140 universities, there are 206 departments offering
environmental classes for undergraduates and more than 5,000
students are environmental science majors.
</P>
<P>
Participants at the conference called on every institute of
higher education to work to improve environmental education.
</P>
<P>
Environmental science classes should be compulsory courses,
they said, for almost all of the university students.

<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, June 17 (Xinhua) -- South China's newly-established

handicapped, and all newly-built roads and buildings are
handicapped-accessible.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years, nearly 8,000 disabled people were

cataract patients, and over 740 paralyzed infants. The success
rate for these operations reached 99 percent and 95 percent,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Hainan now has established six centers for mentally-retarded
children, and 19 cities and counties in the province have formed
similar neighborhood centers.

At present, more than 2,300 disabled children are studying at
primary schools, and 72 handicapped students have entered colleges
and polytechnic schools.

More than 17,000 disabled people were employed during the past
five years.
</P>
<P>
The province has also organized art groups and athletic
associations for the disabled.

<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Mt. Ruapehu Volcano in New
Zealand's central North Island burst into life again this morning,
sending steam and ash thousands of meters into the air.
</P>
<P>
Radio NZ reported that scientists have upgraded the eruption
level to three and civil aviation authorities have declared the
mountain a danger area for pilots. All roads leading to the
mountain have been closed and people have been asked to stay away
from Ruapehu.
</P>
<P>
The mountain has been shooting plumes of steam and ash several
thousand meters into the air since early this morning. A thick
black ash cloud is moving north and ash has also fallen in the Bay
of Plenty region several hundreds of kilometers north of the
mountain.
</P>
<P>
Mt. Ruapehu, rising 2,797 meters above sea level in central
North Island, is the highest mountain on the island. It erupted
last September, forcing the imposition of a no-fly zone around it,
the closure of the major highway passing a nearby area and an
early end of the ski season.

<HEADLINE> Germany, Croatia Sail into Last Eight of Euro Soccer Champs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Powerful Germany and dark horse
Croatia trounced their opponents Russia and Denmark both 3-0
Sunday in group matches to ensure their safe berths of the
quarterfinals at the European Soccer Championship in England.
</P>
<P>
In a group C match this afternoon in Manchester, the German
team, headed by its well-known international star Juergen
Klingsmann, failed to show their normal powerful attacking force
until a 56-minute goal scored by Matthias Sammer.
</P>
<P>
Russia, which had lost two previous matches, fought fiercely
from the beginning of the match and got quite a few great chances
to score.
</P>
<P>
At the 40th minute, the Russian player Ilya Tsymbalar thumped a
post but Ignor Kolyvanov, moving quickly from behind, failed to
head the rebound into the net.
</P>
<P>
The German team launched excellent attacks with Sammer scoring
an opener at the 56th minute as he followed up his own shot.
</P>
<P>
The Russian team was reduced to 10 men in the 71st minute when
Yuri Kovtun became the fourth man to be sent off in the tournament
for a late tackle from behind.
</P>
<P>
German captain Klinsmann became the first player to score in
three successive European Soccer Championships when he scored two
magic goals at the 77th and 91st minute.
</P>
<P>
Having won two group matches, the Germans with six points are
certainly to head into the tournament quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
Russian coach Oleg Romantsev accused his players of lacking
moral fibre, and said afer match: "To do well against a strong
team you need to put in an all-out effort and we failed to do so."
</P>
<P>
"We lost because of our lack of fighting spirit and our
inability to work as a team. The Germans won all the one-on-ones
and tackles," he added.
</P>
<P>
In a group D match between defending champion Denmark and
Croatia tonight in Sheffield, the two teams played a very
disappointing first half with few chances of scoring.
</P>
<P>
However, the second half was turned out to be the most
thrilling match since the opening of the 1996 European Soccer
Championship.
</P>
<P>
Croatia's Davor Suker, with 20 goals in 20 matches, was
undoubtedly the hero of match with a successful penalty kick at
the 53rd minute and a delightful injury-time lob over Peter
Schmeichel, who was commonly regarded as one of the best
goalkeepers in the world.
</P>
<P>
Suker also provided a wonderful pass to Zvonimir Boban, who
volleyed the ball into the Denmrk's gaolmouth at the 81st minute.
</P>
<P>
Croatia, which had beaten Turkey previously, went up to top of
the Goup D with six points and clinched a berth in the knockout
stages of the tournament.

OTTAWA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Britain's driver Damon Hill roared
to the first in Grand Prix Molson du Canada today, reducing his
William-Renault teammate Jacques Villeneuve to the second.
</P>
<P>
Hill's victory, the fifth time this year, was won in one hour
and 36 minutes 3.465 seconds (his average speed 190.541
kilometer-hour), 4.183 seconds before his teammate -- Canadian

</P>

father.
</P>
<P>
"I was flat out all the way," Hill said, adding that he was

trophy to today's winner Englishman Damon Hill.
