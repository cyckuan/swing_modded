<HEADLINE> US to Pay 4.8 Mln Dlrs to Radiation Test Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 20 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government has
agreed to pay 4.8 million U.S. dollars in damages for injecting 12
people with radioactive plutonium or uranium in medical
experiments without their knowledge, said local media reports.
</P>
<P>
The 12 victims in the settlement were injected in the 1940s.
Among them, 11 were injected with plutonium, who are now dead, and
the other was injected with uranium, who is the only survivor.
</P>
<P>
They were injected with the radioactives to see how the human
body would react to an atomic bomb.
</P>
<P>
The 12 were among thousands of people used in experiments by
the U.S. government between 1944 and 1974. Attorneys for the
plaintiffs said the government has yet compensated about 20,000
other people used for the experiments.
</P>
<P>
Layers for families in the 12 cases settled said that all the
subjects suffered some ill effect, including cancer and immune
disorders, that might have resulted from the experiments, The New
York Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
The settlement was reached after 18 months of investigation and
hearings by the President's Advisory Committee on Human Radiation
Experiments, which concluded last year that many of the
government-sponsored radiation experiments were unethical and that
participants of their survivors should be compensated.

BEIJING, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Vice Premier and Foreign
Minister Qian Qichen met with U.S. Secretary of State Warren
Christopher to discuss Sino-American relations, the international
situation and regional security, here this morning.
</P>
<P>
Developing healthy and stable Sino-American relations are in
the basic interest of the two countries, and benefits peace,
stability and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific Region and in the
rest of the world, Qian and Christopher agreed.
</P>
<P>
They said they were pleased with the progress made in bilateral
relations in recent days, and that they hope the two sides will
make a joint effort to give an impetus to further development of
the two countries' relations.
</P>
<P>
They said that the two countries will increase high-level
visits and contacts, including visits by the presidents and
regular meetings between Cabinet and State Council officials.
</P>
<P>
Qian accepted Christopher's invitation to visit the U.S. next
year, at a time to be decided later.
</P>
<P>
On the Taiwan issue, Qian said he hopes the U.S. will strictly
adhere to the three Sino-US joint communiques, refrain from
official contacts with Taiwan, not support Taiwan in its attempts
to join the United Nations, and decrease and stop selling advanced
weaponry and military equipment to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Christopher said that the U.S. government places importance on
China's concern about the Taiwan question, and will continue to
pursue a "one China" policy, observe the three communiques, and
not support Taiwan's attempt for independence or its entry into
the UN or other international organizations with sovereign
countries as members.

<HEADLINE> China Cites Reform Center Achievements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, November 20 (Xinhua) -- A reform center in Shenzhen,
the special economic zone in south China's Guangdong Province, was
honored today by China's Ministry of Justice as one of the
country's first "modern and civilized reform schools".
</P>
<P>
Reform centers are a kind of "special schools" for education
centers where those who have committed minor offenses or caused
social problems do manual labor. They are part of the
re-education-through-labor system set up in 1957.
</P>
<P>
According to Chinese law, the practice of
re-education-through-labor is not a criminal penalty, but the
maximum administrative punishment.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1981, the Shenzhen Reform Center has some 130 staff
members and 1,200 people undergoing re-education.
</P>
<P>
It was commended for successfully getting a majority of its
"students" to become law-abiding citizens who are able to support
themselves.
</P>
<P>
At the awards ceremony today, Xiao Yang, the minister of
justice, said that building "modern and civilized reform schools"
is the principal goal of China's reeducation-through-labor policy,
and the Ministry of Justice is looking to turn most reform centers
across the country into these kind of schools by the year 2010.

<HEADLINE> Surveys on Setting up SADC Drought Fund Being </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 20 (Xinhua) -- The 12-member southern African
Development Community (SADC) is carrying out surveys to establish
if the proposed 30 million U.S. Dollar drought relief fund will
be adequate to deal with vulnerable groups in each country.
</P>
<P>
SADC food security sector coordinator Reginald Mugwara said
here today there is need for member countries to identify the
number of vulnerable groups to enable SADC to determine the
optimum size of the fund, whose establishment has already been
approved by the region's council of ministers.
</P>
<P>
The fund will assist drought prone countries in the region,
which has experienced two poor agricultural seasons in the last
five years.
</P>
<P>
Mugwara said a workshop will be held in Harare during the
first week of December where each country is expected to present
a project proposal of a nutrition and information system needed
to identify ther vulnerable groups.
</P>
<P>
''By the first quarter of 1997, we will have all the proposals
in one document and that will assist in determining the optimum
level of the financial facility,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
The fund will not be a welfare scheme as borrowing will be at
concessionary interest rates to encourage countries to utilise
it, he added.

<HEADLINE> Private Orchestra In China Revived </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 20 (Xinhua) -- A private girls' orchestra has
been revived as a foundation that was set up in Beijing today for
popularizing Chinese and Western music by the China Charity
Federation (CCF).
</P>
<P>
"We don't need to worry about the fund any longer," Zheng
Xiaoying, conductress of the orchestra, said.
</P>
<P>
The private girls' orchestra, the first of its kind in China,
was organized by a group of women musicians from art troupes and
conservatories in the capital city in 1990. They have introduced
more than 100 pieces of modern and classical music.
</P>
<P>
It was compelled to close three months ago, however, because of
a shortage of funds and no official registration. It was not until
last month that it was registered as an artistic and music center.
</P>
<P>
Chu Chuanyi, chairman of the CCF exchange and research
committee, said that modern charities not only help people in
need, but also support music and education.
</P>
<P>
The federation has established five such foundations
to help private non-profit institutions, according to Chu.
</P>
<P>
At today's signing ceremony, a Beijing-based department store,
which is expected to open next month, donated 200,000 yuan to the
fund to support the non-profit activity.

<HEADLINE> US Trade Deficit Up To 11.3 Bln Dlrs In September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 20 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. trade deficit
climbed to 11.3 billion U.S. dollars in September, which is the
second largest figure in red on record, according to a report from
the Department of Commerce released here today.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the deficit in goods and services was up
10.1 percent from an August deficit of 10.3 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The monthly trade deficit is the worst showing since an
all-time high of 11.6 billion dollars in July. For goods alone,
the September performance was a record deficit of 16.1 billion
dollars, shadowing the old record of 15.9 billion dollars in
December 1985.
</P>
<P>
Total imports of goods and services were actually not changed
to 80.1 billion dollars while the imports of goods alone climbed
to 67.5 billion, an all-time high. But its exports dropped 1.4
percent in September to 68.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
The report said the deficit with China in September edged up
0.4 percent to 4.7 billion dollars, the second straight monthly
record. It also indicates that September was the second straight
month and the third time this year that the U.S. trade deficit
with China has surpassed the imbalance with Japan. Some U.S.
market analysts predict the deficit with China could surpass that
with Japan on an annual basis by next year.
</P>
<P>
The deficit with Japan actually fell a slight 0.3 percent in
September to 3.8 billion dollars. Total U.S. auto exports did hit
a record of 5.9 billion dollars in September.
</P>
<P>
The deficit with northern neighbor Canada, America's biggest
trading partner, totaled 2 billion dollars in September, down 15
percent from the previous month. The deficit with southern
neighbor Mexico, the other country in the North American Free
Trade Agreement (NAFTA), was up 8.9 percent to 1.7 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
U.S. imports of petroleum products were up 12.5 percent in
September to 6.28 billion dollars. The increase reflected a rise
in the volume of imports and an even bigger increase in price,
which was attributed to increased tensions in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The average price per barrel of crude rose to 20.02 dollars in
September, the highest it has been since the Gulf War in January
1991.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, the U.S. trade deficit is running at an
annual rate of 114 billion dollars, which could possibly surpass
last year's imbalance of 105.1 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Consumer Spending to Remain Strong in US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, November 20 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. consumer spending
would become strong again after a summer lull, and will continue
on a high note through the rest of the year, according to the
Conference Board, a New York-based private research group.
</P>
<P>
Overall, consumer spending will likely grow at a 4 percent
annual rate or more in the final quarter of this year, which
covers the year's major festival, the group said in its latest
report.
</P>
<P>
"Both the level and change in consumer confidence during the
past year indicate that holiday sales will be up over last year,"
said Gail Fosler, vice president and chief economist of the
Conference Board.
</P>
<P>
In the current expansion, consumers have benefited from
relatively low interest rates, which have helped fuel record home
sales. As a result, housing-related spending is up almost 60
percent since the second quarter of 1991.
</P>
<P>
Spending on automobiles, on the other hand, is up less than 18
percent.
</P>
<P>
Looking to the second half of 1997, Fosler said consumer
spending will slow as interest rates turn up further and higher
prices take their toll on consumers' income.
</P>
<P>
The strong spending is also helped by the growth of the number
of households, with baby boomers entering their middle ages,
according to the research.

ADDIS ABABA, November 20 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Industrial Development Organisation (UNIDO) today stressed the
need for Africa to build its industrial capacity as the continent
is prepared for entering the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
"African countries must move rapidly along the road to
industrialization and take their place among the newly

growth as against rapid population growth.
</P>
<P>
The UNIDO representative called on African countries to
mobilize their own resources to develop the economy with limited
foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
According to figures released by the meeting, average annual
foreign investment flows to Africa were 3 percent during
1981-1985, 1.8 percent during 1986-1990 and 1.7 during 1991-1993.

the 1997 draft law of finances, which fixes the budget deficit at
284.844 billion francs (56.9 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>

deficit, which was 287.98 billion francs (57.6 billion dollars), or
4 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP).
</P>

<P>
SHANGHAI, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Residents of Shanghai,
China's largest economic center, can now use their postal "green
cards" to withdraw money from automatic teller machines.
</P>
<P>
The postal "green card" system has joined the Goldcard system
of certain banks in Shanghai, so the city's post offices can make
transactions directly with the Shanghai branch of the Industrial
and Commercial Bank of China, China Construction Bank,
Communications Bank of China, the Agricultural Bank of China, and
the Pudong Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has issued more than 300,000 postal "green cards" so
far, which were only used in 120 post offices in the past.

<HEADLINE> China And US Reach Consensus On Some Major Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 20 (Xinhua) -- US Secretary of State Warren
Christopher told a press conference in Beijing today that he had
had useful meetings with Chinese leaders and that China and the
United States have reached "concrete understanding" on some major
issues.
</P>
<P>
These include strengthing high-level contacts, maintaining the
current development of bilateral ties, cooperation in the peaceful
use of nuclear power, the Taiwan issue, China's entry into the
World Trade Organization and other issues.
</P>
<P>
Christopher said the relationship between the United States and
China is not only in both countries' interest, but also conducive
to peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region and the world as
a whole.
</P>
<P>
The US side will "continue to support China's accession to the
World Trade Organization," Christopher said, and that he is glad
to see the two sides agree to hold regular dialogues on global
security, nuclear non-proliferation and arms control.
</P>
<P>
The US side is prepared to promote cooperation between the two
countries on the peaceful use of nuclear power, the secretary of
state said.
</P>
<P>
In related events, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Cui
Tiankai said that China and the US have reached a consensus on
major issues, and noted that the Taiwan issue is at the heart of
the Sino-US relationship.
</P>
<P>
He said at a press conference that China demands that the US
not have any official contact with Taiwan, not support Taiwan in
joining the United Nations, and reduce and halt arms sales to
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that the US expressed its willingness to pay
great attention to China's concern over the Taiwan issue, and said
that it will continue to pursue the "one-China" policy.
</P>
<P>
The US will neither back the attempt of "two Chinas" or "one
China, one Taiwan," nor back Taiwan's independence, its joining
the UN or any organization of sovereign states, the spokesman
said.

<HEADLINE> Zmbabwe Won't Allow Donors To Dictate, Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 20 (Xinhua)--The Zimbabwean government will
not allow donors such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to
dictate how it should do, while it is committed to cutting the
bloated budget deficit, a senior government official said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Finance Minister Misheck Chinamasa said the Zimbabwean
government will not tolerate instructions from donors on how it
should run the economy.
</P>
<P>
IMF recently said it will only resume lending, which was
suspended last year due to its concern about fiscal imbalances,
once Zimbabwe's budget deficit has been cut to sustainable
levels.
</P>
<P>
At present, the deficit is estimated at over 10 percent of
GDP, largely due to excessive government spending.
</P>
<P>
''We do not want to run the risk of destroying the economic
achievements we have scored by over-emphasising on cutting
government expenditure to the detriment of our social programs,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
Chinamasa said the budget deficit is sometimes caused by high
expenditure on social services, such as health and education,
which benefited the poor rural people.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's economy is on a steady growth path, with tourism,
mining and the hotel industries being some of the top performers,
while the manufacturing sector is slowly coming out of the woods.

<HEADLINE> Greece to Extradite German Terrorist Suspect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Greek justice authorities will
make a final decision soon on the extradition of a German woman
wanted in her country for her alleged involvement in a disco
bombing 10 years ago, informed sources said today.
</P>
<P>
The extradition of Andrea Hausler to Germany was approved
Tuesday by a three-member appeals court in Salonika, northern
Greece.
</P>
<P>
However, the extradition order can only be carried out after it
is signed by the country's Justice Minister Evangelos Yannopoulos.
</P>
<P>
Hausler, who was arrested while on holiday in Chalkidiki in
northern Greece last month, is wanted by German police in
connection with the 1986 bombing of the La Belle Disco in West
Berlin, a regular haunt of off-duty U.S. servicemen, in which
three people died and 255 were injured.
</P>
<P>
The blast killed two U.S. soldiers and a Turkish woman.
</P>
<P>
Hausler was taken to Salonika from Korydallos Prison near
Athens under strict security provided by about 40 policemen. She
was questioned by the appeals court for 30 minutes before being
taken back to prison.
</P>
<P>
Sources said Hausler had asked the court not to approve the
extradition, claiming that she was in no way involved with the
disco bombing.

between the army and the people during a recent visit to east
China's Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
The vice-chairman, General Liu Huaqing, who is a member of the

<HEADLINE> Economic Reform to Bear Fruit in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's economy is set to
record its best ever performance after independence as the
country started to benefit from market reforms launched in 1991,
an economist said here today.
</P>
<P>
Danny Dube, chief economist of the Commercial Bank of
Zimbabwe, said the general decline in lending and inflation rates
as well as increased investment had contributed to economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
The GDP growth is forecast at seven percent this year compared
with a decline of three percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Inflation in Zimbabwe was last month pegged at just over 20
percent, while minimum lending rates were cut by between 1.5 and
two percentage points in September to 28 to 30 percent. And there
are more indications that the rates will fall further to probably
below 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, budget deficit has remained above five percent of
GDP, which constitutes a major obstacle to higher economic
growth. And during the fiscal year to June 1997, the deficit was
expected to reach as high as nine percent.

<HEADLINE> Nestle SA Expects 3 Billion Sfrs Profit in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, November 20 (Xinhua) -- The world's largest food
manufacturer Nestle S.A. announced today that it could expect a
net profit of 3 billion Swiss francs (2.366 billion U.S. dollars)
out of estimated sales of 60 billion francs (47.322 billion
dollars) for 1996.
</P>
<P>
At its autumn press conference at its Vevey headquarters in
Switzerland, Nestle S.A. disclosed its consolidated sales for the
first 10 months. At 48.3 billion Swiss francs (38.094 billion
dollars), sales show a 5.7 percent growth over the same period of
1995.
</P>
<P>
Nestle said this growth was particularly marked in the emerging
markets, above all in Southeast Asia as well as in Central and
Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
It also said that after two years during which Nestle was
penalized by the strong Swiss franc, the currency effect became
positive again, for the first time since July 1993.
</P>
<P>
At 3 percent, Nestle's sales volume growth is slightly below
the rate of 3.6 percent announced for the first half of the year.
This slight slowdown of growth is largely due to bad weather
conditions in Europe in August and September which had a negative
impact on the sales of mineral water and ice cream. On the other
hand, encouraging growth continued in soluble coffee, Nestle said.

<HEADLINE> House Republicans Select Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 20 (xinhua) -- Republicans in the U.S.
House of Representatives met today behind closed doors to choose
their leaders for the next Congress, with Newt Gingrich virtually
almost assured a second term as speaker of the House.
</P>
<P>
It was considered unlikely that Gingrich, a Representative from
Georgia, would be challenged for the top position in the House
despite complaints from some Republicans about the two-year-old,
unresolved ethics investigation of the speaker.
</P>
<P>
Gingrich "is our visionary, he is certainly our best
strategician, and he is our leader," said John Boehner, chairman
of the House Republican Conference, before the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Final word on the top leadership posts is expected at the end
of the House Republican Conference meeting this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The Republican conference selects leaders in advance of the
formal election of the speaker when Congress reconvenes in
January. The January 7 election is largely a formality, with
lawmakers expected to vote along party lines for the speaker.
</P>
<P>
House Democrats voted earlier this week to keep their leaders
for a second term. Representative Richard Gephardt remains
minority leader, and Representative David Bonior the Democratic
whip.
</P>
<P>
Democrats will nominate Gephardt as their candidate for speaker
against Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
Republicans kept control of the House following the elections
earlier this month, although their edge in the 104th Congress was
cut by nearly a half.
</P>
<P>
Other House Republican leaders, including Boehner, majority
leader Dick Armey, and Republican whip Tom DeLay, are likely to be
reelected.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Three hundred children today
demonstrated in the southern French city of Marseille for the
protection of the rights of children on the National Day of
Children's Rights in France.
</P>
<P>
The children, all from the working class districts of Marseille
and organized by non-government groups such as Secours Populaire,
expressed their best wishes for the children around the world,
called for food to be sent to the children in Zaire, and urged the
Euro-Disney land to open to poor children.
</P>
<P>
France will open a three-digital telephone number, 111, for
children to call for emergency aid when mal-treated by adults from
January 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Alain Juppe today announced a plan of action for
the protection of children "as a great national cause" in 1997.
</P>
<P>
"Rejecting the unacceptable violence of adults against children
should be the ambition and awareness of the entire country," said
Juppe at a press conference, joined by Minister of Justice Jacques
Toubon and State Secretary for Emergency Humanitarian Action
Xavier Emmanuelli.
</P>
<P>
The French government has also prepared a draft law on the
protection of children, which would require a 10-year follow-up
medical-psychological treatment of all criminals convicted of
abusing children or sexually exploiting children, after they come
out of prison.

<HEADLINE> UK's Support Network To Help Get Business On-Line </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 20 (Xinhua) -- A new support network came
into effect today to provide advice and guidance on new
information technologies directly to local businesses around
Britain.
</P>
<P>
Opening the London Support Center, Science and Technology
Minister Ian Taylor said, "It's about smaller companies being
ready to do business in the next century and how they can find out
about the technologies to help them work smarter."
</P>
<P>
Nineteen new Local Support Centers (LSCs), set up under the
Department of Trade and Industry will be staffed by business
advisors able to help managers cut through jargon and hype and
help them make effective use of technologies ranging from the
Internet and World Wide Web to E-Mail and electronic Commerce.
</P>
<P>
The center will provide hands-on opportunities and experience
of just what new information, communications and interactive
technologies can do, according to the minister.
</P>
<P>
Increasingly small businesses will find that their customers,
suppliers and distributors use on-line communications in the
supply chain, for stock control and for payment.
</P>
<P>
"Unless they can too, they risk losing out to competitors both
at home and overseas," Ian Taylor warned.
</P>
<P>
The LSCs are based around Business Links and their equivalents
and will eventually form part of a national network of 50 such
centers covering all parts of the United Kingdom by the end of
1997.
</P>
<P>
Each LSC's role is to extend the awareness and understanding of
the business use of electronic networks and multimedia by
providing direct help that can be tailored to individual
companies' requirements.

<P>
JERUSALEM, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Israel today charged the
Palestinian Authority (PA) for beginning easing its fight
against "terrorism" in one of various violations of the signed
agreements.
</P>
<P>
Oren Shahor, the Israeli Army's coordinator of activities in
the Palestinian territories, detailed the so-called violations
in his report presented to the Knesset (Parliament) Foreign
Affairs and Defense Committee.
</P>
<P>
The report claimed that the recent months witnessed the first
signs of decline in PA's efforts to crack down on the Palestinian
opposition groups, particularly easing pressure on the
infrastructure which "supported terrorism."
</P>
<P>
But it acknowledged that the PA at the same time still
continues acting with determination to thwart specific
"terrorist" attacks.
</P>
<P>
Shahor said the PA is not doing enough to prevent the
infiltration of Palestinians into Israel and the operation of
smuggling Palestinian workers into Israel goes on.
</P>
<P>
There are about 10,000 Palestinian police, some armed, who
have not received Israel's official authorization as required,
he said.
</P>
<P>
He also blast the PA for abusing the VIP rights granted by
Israel to senior Palestinian officials and their guards. For
example, he said, some of them incited against Israel and even
participated in the protests against Israel's building bypass
roads in the territories.
</P>
<P>
In east Jerusalem, he added, the PA is making efforts to
solidify its presence in the part of Israel's self-claimed only
eternal capital through conducting "illegal security
activities."
</P>
<P>
At today's meeting, the right-wing Peace Watch group also
testified against the PA on its violations of agreements signed
with Israel. However, the opposition members of the committee
were critical of allowing the non-governmental group to testify
in the committee for the first time.
</P>
<P>
Peace Watch denounced the PA's "intentively and
systematically" violations, saying they would lead to the
explosions of the signed peace accords.

<HEADLINE> US Policy on Jewish Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 20 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Ambassador to Israel
Martin Indyk today denied that the U.S. has changed its
policy on Israel's expansion of Jewish settlements.
</P>
<P>
Indyk made the remarks to Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu, who required him to clarify the U.S. stand on the
issue after negative statements made by a State Department
spokesman a day earlier.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman told a news briefing in Washington that the
U.S. objected to Israel's expansion of Jewish settlements in
the Palestinian self-rule areas, saying it would complicate the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
This aroused strong concern among Israeli officials for a
possible policy change by the U.S. government led by President
Bill Clinton, who has been reelected for a second term.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian Authority and many Arab countries are
expecting Clinton to exert tougher pressure on Israel to halt
the settlement expansion and push forward the peace process.
Israel is keeping a close watch on every single move of
the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister's Office today strongly criticized the
U.S. spokesman's statements, arguing that it was under the
previous government that the population of Jewish settlers in
the Palestinian territories had nearly doubled.
</P>
<P>
Before 1992, the issue of settlement had been a thorn in
the relations between Israel's Likud government led by former
hardline premier Yitzhak Shamir and the U.S. Republican
government under President George Bush, who was against the
settlement expansion.
</P>
<P>
Soon after taking over power in 1992 in Israel, the
previous Labor government froze the building of new settlements
in order to conduct peace negotiations with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
However, the Netanyahu government lifted the freeze last
August, saying the natural growth of settlers' population
necessitated the expansion of settlements.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton government publicly opposes Israel's policy of
expanding Jewish settlements, but has so far declined to exert
tougher pressure on Netanyahu to change his mind.

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, November 20 (Xinhua) -- The Belgrade office of the
British non-governmental humanitarian organization Save the
Children Fund has so far reunited 2,200 children refugees from
former Yugoslavia with their parents.
</P>
<P>
Ann Pesic, coordinator of the organization's program for
children separated from their parents, told reporters the
organization had over the past years registered in the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia 3,400 children refugees separated from
their parents.
</P>
<P>
The children refugees were living with relatives, or were
sheltered by social welfare institutions in Belgrade and other
cities in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"Out of this number, we have sent 2,200 children refugees to
their parents in Bosnia, Croatia, Europe and in other continents,
and we continue caring for the rest through a number of
development programs," Pesic said.
</P>
<P>
"We are engaged in providing funds for next year as our
development programs are long term and we are not leaving like
other humanitarian organizations, she said.
</P>
<P>
Due to the wars in Croatia and Bosnia in 1991-1995, more than
650,000 refugees from these two countries have sought asylum in
Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> Rwandan Envoy Opposes Deployment of Multinational </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 20 (Xinhua) -- The deployment of a neutral
multinational force to create safe corridors and assist the safe
return of refugees to Rwanda is no longer necessary, Rwandan Ambassador
to South Africa Ben karenzi said here today.
</P>
<P>
He told a press conference that Zairean rebels had liberated
thousands of hostages held for longer than two years, thereby
fulfilling the main task of the would-be multinational force.
</P>
<P>
"What is needed now is humanitarian aid and related logistics,not
combat troops," said the ambassador.
</P>
<P>
He said Zairean rebels fighting government troops started
liberating most civilian hostages on November 15 and had created safe
corridors for their return to Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
Karenzi said almost 500,000 refugees are returning to Rwanda and
that the rehabilitation and resettlement program is continuing
smoothly.
</P>
<P>
With the return of the 500,000 refugees who fled Rwanda at
the height of the war between Tutsi and Hutu rebels in 1994, reconci-
liation had begun in earnest in Rwanda, he said.
</P>
<P>
"What should have been channelled towards the deployment of a multi-
national force should now be channelled for reconstruction in Rwanda,"
karenzi noted.
</P>
<P>
On a possible renewed clash between the government troops and Zairean
rebels in Eastern Zaire, he said Rwanda "had nothing to do with another
country's internal problem".
</P>
<P>
He, however, suggested leaders in the Great Lakes region should meet
soon again to discuss finding of lasting solutions.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Microsoft Corp., the American
software giant, introduced its Office 97 at the on-going computer
show at Las Vegas in California.
</P>
<P>
Office 97 is the upgraded version of its package of
spreadsheet, database and word-processing software, which has been
regarded by experts as more sophisticated for business users.
</P>
<P>
Office is Microsoft's biggest money maker and holds 85 percent
of the market.
</P>
<P>
The new version adds features designed to make it easier to do
word processing, manage databases and create graphs. Among the new
Internet additions is Outlook, a program that combines electronic
mail and scheduling and an address book.
</P>
<P>
Another new feature is a help screen where an animated
assistant -- which can be changed to look like various people and
objects -- makes suggestions and answers questions.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft said the software will be available in stores from
January 16, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The updated version is projected to help overall Office sales
reach 4 billion U.S. dollars in fiscal 1997. Microsoft estimates
about half of the approximately 25 million people who use its
Office suite will switch to the new version.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 20 (Xinhua) -- European Parliament
President Klaus Hansch today blasted Israeli plans to expand
Jewish settlements in the West Bank, calling them illegal.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the legislative Palestinian Council (PC) in
Ramallah in the West Bank, Hansch said that "bulldozers (working
to expand settlements) do not pave the way for peace."
</P>
<P>
Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai recently gave final
approval for the construction of 1,200 housing units in the
settlement of Emmanuel in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Emmanuel projects are the first in the settlements to be
initiated by the current Israeli government. And the plans to
build some 2,000 units in Matityah and Kiryat Safer, which have
been approved earlier, were drawn up under the previous
government.
</P>
<P>
In his speech today, Hansch, who is currently visiting Israel
and the Palestinian autonomous areas, also expressed his
sympathy with the Palestinian men, women and children, who he
said have died over the years of conflict with Israel.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Hansch told Israel Radio that the European
Parliament intends to provide some 700 million US dollars in
financial aid to the PA.
</P>
<P>
"We have a complementary role which we have to play in the
interest of Europe, as well as in the interest of the region,"
said Hansch, adding "it is the role to make peace work by
economic and financial help to the region, mainly to the West
Bank and Gaza Strip."
</P>
<P>
In his welcoming speech, PC speaker Ahmed Queria called for
"an active and fixed European role" in the Middle East peace
process, in helping the parties of the conflict to achieve peace
in the region.
</P>
<P>
Queria described the European role as "a reinforcing and
complementing one," saying it would only help achieve
international balance, and would not mean to clash and compete
with others.
</P>
<P>
Queria took the opportunity to express the appreciation of
the Palestinian people for the continuous political and economic
support by the European Parliament.
</P>
<P>
Hansch, who arrived here Monday, also addressed the Knesset
(Israel's parliament) earlier this week. He traveled to the Gaza
Strip Tuesday to hold talks with PA President Yasser Arafat.

<HEADLINE> 216 S. Africans Still Being Monitored for Ebola </HEADLINE>

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 20 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Gauteng
Provincial Health Department is still monitoring 216 people for
possible symptoms of the Ebola virus but no new cases have been
reported, it was announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Those being monitored are mostly health workers who have cared
for South Africa's first Ebola victim Marilyn Lahana and
laboratory workers who have handled her and a Gabonese doctor's
blood samples.
</P>
<P>
However, the number under observation dropped by 36 as the
21-day incubation period passed, said the department, adding two
people are being kept under close supervision by Rietfontein
Hospital in Johannesburg because they are exhibiting symptoms
that might indicate Ebola.
</P>
<P>
Lahana, a 46-year-old nurse at a private clinic in
Johannesburg, was diagnosed as having been infected with the
deadly Ebola virus last Saturday after nursing a Gabonese doctor,
who had treated Ebola patients in that country.
</P>
<P>
She is now fighting for her life in an isolation ward in
Johannesburg Hospital and is still linked to a ventilator and a
dialysis machine to assist her kidney function.
</P>
<P>
According to hospital superintendent Trevor Frankish, Lahana
was on Wednesday afternoon still in a critical but stable
condition.
</P>
<P>
Frankish cautioned that any improvement in Lahana's condition
will not be sudden. "Progress can only be measured in weeks, not
days," he said.

DAR ES SALAAM, November 20 (Xinhua) -- The Health Ministry of
Tanzania has released new guideline standards for governmental
hospitals aimed at improving medical services in the country.
</P>
<P>
Under the new standards, a patient will pay half the cost with
the other expenses to be complemented by the government.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the new guideline standards at a press conference
here today, Health Minister Zakia Meghji said that the government
also abolished medical consultation fees which started in 1993,
because people raised concern over the cost.
</P>
<P>
Meghji told reporters that the former cost-sharing scheme had
been reviewed because many people complained about the former
system, which brought no improvement to hospital despite people's
contributions.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the government would continue efforts to
help people who can not afford even little medical cost. Special
cases like tuberculosis (TB), cancer, AIDS, and diabetes are
still treated free of charge, he pledged.
</P>
<P>
Meghji made it clear that doctors in government hospitals will
not be allowed to own a hospital or health center.
</P>
<P>
The minister demanded all private and organizational health
centers or hospitals register afresh by next June 30 in
compliance to the new guideline.

LAGOS, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Ruth Perry, chairperson of
Liberia's Transitional Ruling Council of State, today made an
on-the-spot inspection of a factional stronghold on the eve of
the disarmament process in the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
Arriving at the northwestern town of Voinjama, Perry, together
with Victor Malu, commander of the west African peacekeeping
force ECOMOG and diplomats, was greeted by hundreds of local
people, chanting "we want peace", the Nigerian Television
Authority reported today.
</P>
<P>
The town is the location of one battalion of the warring
faction ULIMO-K led by Alhaji Kromah.
</P>
<P>
The TV report showed some weapons recovered from the ULIMO-K
militia, including such heavy artillery weapons as rockets and
tank missiles, as well as assorted guns.
</P>
<P>
According to the peace agreement signed by the warlords of the
small minerals-rich west African country, disarmament and
demobilization of the warring factions and repatriation of
combatants, the displaced and refugees will begin on November 22
this year and finish at the end of January next year. General
elections are scheduled for May.
</P>
<P>
Several thousands of ECOMOG soldiers have begun deploying
outside the capital of Monrovia to supervise the disarmament
since last Friday, according to a report reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
"The deploying will end on Thursday, the eve of the
disarmament program," said Major Patrick Okoh, chief military
spokesman of ECOMOG, quoted by the report.
</P>
<P>
Major-general Malu said the exercise will go ahead on schedule
even though he has not yet received reinforcements, as agreed in
Nigeria last August.
</P>
<P>
Beside Voinjama, peacekeepers will also deploy at Camp Naama,
one site designated for disarmament of Charles Taylor's National
Patriotic Front of Liberia, Zwedru in the southeast, headquarters
of George Boley's Liberia Peace Council, and Tubmanburg in the
west, the stronghold of Roosevelt Johnson's ULIMO-J faction, the

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 20 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC)
today adopted a green paper on a numbering policy for
telecommunications services in Europe.
</P>
<P>
The consultative document was approved in Brussels by the EC,
which considers that special attention must be given to ensure
that customer needs will not be overlooked in a liberalized,
multi-operator environment.
</P>
<P>
The paper proposes new mechanisms that allow customers to keep
their telephone number if they decide to switch telephone company
or service provider.
</P>
<P>
The paper also includes a proposal to open Europe-wide
services, such as free phone and premium rate services, which are
now often available only at a national level.
</P>
<P>
According to the paper, these services should be based on
Europe-wide numbers, which the EC sees as an important step for
the completion of the internal market.

<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Greek Defense Minister Akis
Tsohatzopoulos arrived here today on a four-day official visit to
discuss with Cyprus officials the future planning of a joint
Greco-Cypriot defense pact.
</P>
<P>
Speaking upon his arrival, the Greek minister expressed his
pleasure for his first visit to the island since his appointment
to the Greek Defense Ministry.
</P>
<P>
He said "Greece and Cyprus share a common course, common
prospects and common capability to face the future successfully."
</P>
<P>
His contacts here with the military chiefs and the political
leadership will facilitate a chance for substantive discussions
related to military and political objectives, he added.
</P>
<P>
Tsohatzopoulos stressed that Cyprus' defense capability will
continue to be bolstered to serve as a deterrent against
Turkish expansionist designs. "This is our duty and obligation,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Welcoming Tsohatzopoulos, Cyprus Defense Minister Costas
Eliades said: "Your presence here conveys the message that the
joint defense doctrine is a reality which acts as a deterrent in
our efforts to reach a peaceful solution of the Cyprus problem."
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is to settle the Cyprus problem with peaceful means
and our efforts in the realm of defense are aimed to create a
deterrent to strengthen the political leadership in the
negotiating process," Eliades said.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that "fresh decisions" related to the
defense doctrine will be taken during talks in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The Greek minister is expected to have meetings with President
Glafcos Clerides and National Guard Commander Nicolars
Vorvolakos.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus and Greece reached an agreement on joint defense in
November 1993.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey, both NATO allies, are at odds over
this East Mediterranean strategic island, which has been divided
since Turkish invasion in 1974.
</P>
<P>
Athens has warned Ankara that any further advance of the
Turkish troops toward the government-controlled southern part of
the island would mean war between the two countries.

today.
</P>
<P>
Saman was speaking at a welcoming banquet in honor of Qiao Shi,

</P>
<P>
Led by the Lao People's Revolutionary Party (LPRP), the Lao
people have made initial achievements in the country's innovation,

sustainable economic development, Saman said.
</P>
<P>
He added that Lao people are making efforts to implement the
resolution adopted by the party's sixth congress and to fulfil the
development objectives set by the government.
</P>
<P>
While recalling the traditional friendship between China and

<HEADLINE> Diversified Commodity Market Takes Shape in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 21 (Xinhua) -- China's commodity market is
becoming increasingly market-oriented, diversified and modernized.
</P>
<P>
While in the past the price of most of the commodities was
fixed by the State, market regulations are now playing a major
role.
</P>
<P>
Figures released by the Ministry of Internal Trade show that
the government is now only responsible for setting the price of
less than six percent of consumer goods, as against 97 percent
previously.
</P>
<P>
While State-ownership is dominated, now commodity distribution
businesses are run by a mixture of proprietors -- the State,
collective unites and private.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the state-owned firms accounted for 30 percent of
total retail sales, collectively-owned firms made up 19.8 percent,
and individually-owned enterprises (those employing no more than
eight workers) 30.8 percent, with the rest taken by private
businesses, Sino-foreign joint ventures, and other
jointly-operated firms.
</P>
<P>
The retail business is also diversifying in its forms of
operation. Among the 13.5 million commercial outlets already
established all over the country, there are not only traditional
and shops and department stores, but also newly-emerged
supermarkets, convenience shops, speciality shops, and shopping
malls.
</P>
<P>
Most of the large marketplaces have been equipped with
air-conditioners, escalators, store check-out points and TV
monitoring systems, providing a comfortable shopping environment
for customers.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Education Minister
Edmund Garwe today appealed to United Nations and world donor
agencies to assist in Zimbbawe's education system reform.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meeting attended by representatives from U.N.
and donor agencies, Garwe said that his ministry decided to
change the education curriculum as part of an educational reform
to make the curriculum more adaptable to the demographic and
social aspects of zimbabwe's national development.
</P>
<P>
The educational reform program is aimed at raising the
students' vocational, technical and practical skills.
</P>
<P>
He said, ''The education system inherited from the colonial
past has since become irrelevant to the socio-economic needs of
our society. The skills it imparts to our students are
incompatible with demands of the job market.''
</P>
<P>
The minister called upon traditional friends and well wishers
"to support efforts in the reform program in such areas as direct
financial support, transport, technical support in the form of
consultancies and advisors and equipment.''
</P>
<P>
The reform program is expected to start early next year.

<HEADLINE> Lumberjacks Trade Axes For Hoes In Chinese Island Forests (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Liang Kaixiao, a man who made a
good living by felling trees in rain forests with an axe for more
than a decade, has learned to use a hoe to make a living - but
the transition is not an easy one.
</P>
<P>
Liang was one of about 8,000 loggers on China's tropical island
province of Hainan who had to leave the work they knew so well,
after a ban on logging issued by the Ministry of Forestry and the
provincial government.
</P>
<P>
In January 1994, the forestry bureaus of Jianfengling,
Bawangling, and Diaoluoshan, and 12 forest farms were told they
had to stop cutting down the rain forests, in a move aimed at
protecting the island's primitive forests, the largest and best
preserved tropical rain forests in China.
</P>
<P>
However, the decision meant nearly ten million yuan less in
taxes for the government each year and, to make matters worse, the
government had to deal with the problems of nearly 10,000
unemployed workers and their relatives.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1960s, Hainan had been making considerable
contributions to the nation's economy because of its abundant
forest resources making it a key production base for south China.

<P>
But, the excessive logging had caused serious damage to the
primitive forests, the total area of which went from more than
700,000 ha to 100,000 ha.
</P>
<P>
Because of the ban on logging, the loggers and their families
faced the prospect of having to find another way to make a living.
</P>
<P>
In two years, however, the majority of them have found new
jobs.

<P>
WASHINGTON, November 21 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading U.S. newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Since half a million Rwandan refugees began their trek home
from Zaire last week, more than 2,000 children have been found
alone, abandoned or lost by the road.
</P>
<P>
-- FBI agents following the CIA career officer arrested earlier
this week on spying charges were able to track him through the
streets of Singapore in June to a meeting with a man in a car
registered to the Russian embassy, enabling them to build a strong
circumstantial case against the man.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- House Speaker Newt Gingrich was unanimously reelected the
House Republicans' leader Wednesday and promised a conciliatory
approach in dealing with the Clinton administration that was in
sharp contrast to the uncompromising chord he struck when his
party took control of Congress two years ago.
</P>
<P>
-- The sexual abuse of female trainees by drill instructors in
Army is "not that unusual", but the Army has tried, until now, to
keep the problem to itself.

<P>

<P>
About half of them are farming, or planting trees instead of
cutting them down, and have some 2,000 ha of trees that produce
rubber and mangoes.
</P>
<P>
The Jianfengling Forestry Bureau used to be the biggest forest
business on Hainan, employing more than 5,000 loggers, but those
days are gone. Now, the old workers swap tales about the days when
the bureau sent large quantities of fine timber to Beijing for
rebuilding the capital.
</P>
<P>
In its heyday, the bureau had an annual output value of more
than 30 million yuan, so it faced great difficulties when incomes
plummeted after the government ban.
</P>
<P>
"We used to work day and night back then, and were only afraid
of not meeting our timber quota," said Ruan Baoli, the former
director of one of the bureau's forest farm
subsidiaries. "Sometimes logs rotted because of poor
transportation. Even now, when we think of that, we feel very
sorry."
</P>
<P>
"When I came here more than 30 years ago, big trees, trees that
were more than a dozen meters tall covered the mountains, and
bears, leopards and deer could be seen everywhere," Ruan said
wistfully, pointing to a patch of vacant land in front of him.
</P>
<P>
At that time, groups of monkeys would sneak into their
worksheds looking for something to eat, he said. "Now we hardly
even see a hare. We have asked for too much from the forests."
</P>
<P>
The old man, who devoted half his life to logging, is
enthusiastic about forest protection, even though he earns only
about 300 yuan (36 US dollars) a month, far less than he did
before.

<HEADLINE> Increase In Cultural Activities In Tibet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, November 21 (Xinhua) -- China's Tibet Autonomous Region
has made a considerable effort at improving education and culture
in recent years.
</P>
<P>
A "cultural corridor" was set up recently in the Nyingchi
region in the southeastern part of Tibet to help develop the local
economy, technology and tourism. The region has set up 136 culture
centers at township and village levels and art troupes to provide
a mixture of reading materials and cultural performances for
farmers and herdsmen.
</P>
<P>
In Bhagna Village, farmers donated some 20,000 yuan to provide
television broadcasting equipment, and 51 of the village's 68
households bought TV sets to enjoy the colorful entertainment.
</P>
<P>
The art troupes are give performances of traditional folk
dances, which have been warmly received by local people.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the autonomous region has set up 66 night
schools to help more than 6,000 young and middle-aged farmers
learn to read and write.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the region has held training programs to help the

<HEADLINE> Pak Court Orders Release of Former High Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Political secretary to
Pakistan's former prime minister Benazir Bhutto and one of her
minister, who have been detained, will be soon released on the
court's order.
</P>
<P>
Rawalpindi Bench of Lahore High Court (LHC) today dismissed the
orders of the District Magistrate of Islamabad regarding the
detention of Naheed Khan, Benazir Bhutto's political secretary,
and former science minister Nawaz Khokhar.
</P>
<P>
The court ordered the immediate release of both and directed
Assistant Deputy Commissioner General (ADCG) Ahmad Yar to contact
jail authorities for this purpose.
</P>
<P>
District Administration of Islamabad, on information that when
Naheed Khan arrived in the capital from the southern port city of
Karachi Tuesday, some disturbances might be created, detained the
lady and sent her to jail.
</P>
<P>
A writ petition was moved in LHC Rawalpindi Bench in the
capital's twin city of Rawalpindi Wednesday by her mother against
the detention.
</P>
<P>
Since Ahmad Yar failed to produce any solid grounds justifying
the orders of the District Magistrate, the court issued the order
of release.
</P>
<P>
In another case, the court also ordered the release of Nawaz
Khokhar, who was detained as certain housing societies of
Islamabad had made allegations against him.
</P>
<P>
Khokhar was also alleged that the members of the Central Board
of Revenue were threatened by him.
</P>
<P>
Nawaz Khokhar was arrested last Sunday from Lahore, Punjab's
provincial capital.
</P>
<P>
A writ petition was filed in LHC Rawalpindi Bench Wednesday
against the detention of Khokhar. In the petition he contended
that his arrest was illegal and without lawful authority.
</P>
<P>
The court recalling the orders of the District Magistrate
ordered the release of Nawaz Khokhar.
</P>
<P>
Since Benazir Bhutto was dismissed by President Farooq Leghari
on November 5, a number of former high officials, including
Benazir's husband and former investment minister Asif Ali Zardari,
have been detained.
</P>
<P>
Zardari is still under detention. Benazir is allowed to meet
him twice a week.

<TEXT>
<P>
A stone-processing plant seems to bring about the best profit
for some of the former loggers. But even there, workers' monthly
salary is no more than 400 yuan, as opposed to the 1,000 yuan they
might have made before.
</P>
<P>
"We were rather the envy of others, being lumberjacks," one
worker, Yu Quangui, noted.
</P>
<P>
According to locals, one tree was worth 1,000 yuan on the black
market. But, in the past several years, none of the former loggers
are cutting trees on the sly. Instead, they have taken on the
responsibility of protecting the forests from poaching by lawless
people.
</P>
<P>
Also, forestry businesses who find themselves in straitened
circumstances have gotten help from the government and from
international organizations.
</P>
<P>
Over the past three years, the Hainan Provincial Government has
given the businesses 36 million yuan in aid and many millions yuan
in loans.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the International Tropical Timber Organization,
the World Bank, and Asian Development Bank have backed the
companies, allowing them to engage in other business, such as
cutting stone, producing plywood, or getting involved in tourism,
livestock breeding, and growing fruit or other trees.
</P>
<P>
"It's only three years since the lumbering ban began, but we
can feel the change in circumstances," said Liang Kaixiao, who is
now farming at the foot of a mountain.
</P>
<P>
"It was rather dry this season, and the leaves of trees turned
yellow. But now, there's more rain, and the leaves are green
again," Liang noted.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey shows that trees in the forests of
Jianfengling, Bawangling, and Diaoluoshan are lush again and,
according to forestry personnel, if the good protective measures
can be continued, the areas will be covered by fairly good growth
in 20 to 30 years, and prosperous tropical forests can grow up in
200 years.

<HEADLINE> President Attacks Taliban, Seeks Political Solution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Afghanistan's President
Burhanuddin Rabbani today attacked the Taliban Islamic movement,
which has taken control of two thirds of the country racked by
years of war.
</P>
<P>
But he said he is trying to seek a political, rather than
military, solution to the country's long-standing internal
conflict.
</P>
<P>
Rabbani, who is in Paris for a private visit after attending
the Rome World Food Summit, accused the Taliban, who now control
the Afghan capital Kabul, of supporting international terrorism
and drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
"The Taliban movement has refused to talk either with Afghans
or with the United Nations, and is denying the Afghan people,
especially women, their basic human rights," he told a press
conference.
</P>
<P>
The Afghan people, especially those in Kabul, have suffered
enough in nearly two decades of war which has killed nearly one
third of the country's population, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said he and leaders of most other factions are seeking a
political, rather than military, solution to the Afghan conflict
by initiating an "inter-Afghan dialogue under the auspices of the
United Nations."
</P>
<P>
He said the ongoing military action around Kabul was not aimed
at seeking a military solution, but exerting military pressure on
the Taliban to force them out of the city.
</P>
<P>
The president proposed the establishment of an inter-Afghan
police force to bring peace back to the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
Rabbani accused Pakistan of interfering in the internal affairs
of Afghanistan by supporting the Taliban politically, militarily
and financially.
</P>
<P>
He also criticized the United States and Saudi Arabia for
encouraging Pakistan's support of the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
According to Agence France Presse (AFP), the Taliban Islamic
movement has confirmed its readiness to work with the United
Nations for a cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
AFP said the promise was made by Taliban acting Deputy Foreign
Minister Sher Mohammad Stanekzai during a meeting with senior
U.N. representative Francis Okelo.

<HEADLINE> HK Firm Authorized to Operate HKEFC Extension </HEADLINE>

<P>
HONG KONG, November 21 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Trade
Development Council entered into a new operation agreement here
today with the existing operator of the Hong Kong Conference and
Exhibition Center (HKCEC) to operate the new extension which is
due to be completed by early June 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese and British sides of the Joint Liaison Group agreed
in September this year that the ceremony for the handover of Hong
Kong will be held in the grand foyer of the new extension to the
HKCEC.
</P>
<P>
The term of the agreement, singed with Polytown Company Ltd., a
subsidiary of New World Development Company Ltd., is for 20 years
commencing June 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Polytown new operates the existing Center under the name of
HKCEC (Management) Ltd. on a 40-year term.
</P>
<P>
TDC's executive director Michael Sze said the extension is an
expansion of the existing facilities, not a new center, and
therefore it is logical and practical for it to be operated by the
same professional manager so that the expanded Center will be
managed as one world-class purpose-built facility.
</P>
<P>
TDC has been entrusted by the Hong Kong government as its agent
for the 4.8 billion HK dollars (0.6 billion US dollars)
government-funded extension project.
</P>
<P>
A management and operation agreement was also signed today
between the government and the TDC, which gives the TDC the
authority to employ the private sector as operator of the
extension.

<P>
TOKYO, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto today called on ministers to tighten discipline in the
wake of revelations that a former vice health minister allegedly
received favors from the head of a welfare group.
</P>
<P>
"I feel regret and I am furious," Kyodo quoted him as saying
during an unscheduled appearance at a regular meeting of
administrative vice ministers.
</P>
<P>
Nobuharu Okamitsu resigned Tuesday as administrative vice
minister of the Health and Welfare Ministry over allegations that
he received favors from welfare group head Hiroshi Koyama.
</P>
<P>
Koyama was arrested Monday along with former ministry
bureaucrat Shigeru Chatani on suspicion of bribery.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto told the meeting that the trust and cooperation of
the people are indispensable to the implementation of the
government's administrative reform pledges, but these revelations
had harmed such trust.
</P>
<P>
Kyodo said Hashimoto urged bureaucrats to be on their guard
against corruption and regain the trust of the people.
</P>
<P>
"I ask you, administrative vice ministers, to take the lead,
take every measure to tighten discipline and improve ethics," the
agency quoted the prime minister as saying.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 21 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela today urged a mass campaign against increasing
crime that has hindered economic growth and development.
</P>
<P>
The call, made at the National Economic Development and Labour
Council Conference on Crime and Violence held in Johannesburg,
was followed by an official report that nearly 16,000 people had
been killed in South Africa in the first eight months of this

</P>

Mandela said many people felt "justifiably angry" at having
their freedom threatened by criminals after freeing themselves
from an oppressive apartheid system.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Iran Stages Grand Military Maneuvers in Gulf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Iran today launched grand
military maneuvers involving 10,000-strong forces, more than 100
warships and 40 airplanes in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
The country's official news agency IRNA reported that the
code-named Piroozi-7 (victory) is being carried out in an area
of 11,000 nautical miles stretching from the Gulf and the Strait
of Hormuz to the high seas.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the 10-day maneuvers are jointly
conducted by the Army, the Islamic Revolution's Guard Corps
(IRGC), the Basij (volunteer) units, the Navy, the Air Force,
Havaniruz (army aviation service) and airborne units.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 vessels, including destroyers, gun boats and
missile cruisers, hovercrafts, supply ships, submarines and 40
airplanes and helicopters are engaged in the maneuvers.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the war game is intended to enhance the
combat readiness of the Iranian armed forces.
</P>
<P>
However, observers here noted that Iran carried out the
military maneuvers in order to show itself to the world that
Iran is worried about the massive presence of Western forces,
especially the United States.
</P>
<P>
Navy Commander Ali Shamkhani said at a press conference held
last Saturday that the military maneuvers would include
amphibious operations, missile launching, surface and subsurface
operations.
</P>
<P>
This would be the 35th military maneuvers the Iranian Navy
has conducted since the beginning of this Iranian calendar year
starting from March 20.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question posed by Xinhua, he said his Navy had
already carried out 34 war games and there will be 12 more in
the last four months of the year.
</P>
<P>
Shamkhani said that the total number of the military
maneuvers would be round 50 this year. But he noted "the number
of our maneuvers is small as compared with that of the United
States and other Western forces in the Persian Gulf."
</P>
<P>
"There are 99 warships belonging to the Western forces in the
Persian Gulf. The majority of them belong to the United States,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
For a small waterway such as the Gulf, he said, the presence
of 99 warships amount to virtual occupation. "This occupation is
illegitimate."
</P>
<P>
As to the question on whether Iran would send a message to
the United States through this military maneuvers, he said, "We
have no message to any foreign force in the Persian Gulf. Our
maneuvers have no aim in sending any message that would entail
any tension for any party."
</P>
<P>
"The aim of these maneuvers is to preserve defensive
capability and boost the Navy's readiness," he added.
</P>
<P>
On the question of potential military confrontation between
the Iranian forces and the American forces, he said, "We are
trying to be alive and deterrent. We are not after any conflict
with any party."
</P>
<P>
However, he added, "the army people should be prepared for
the worst. The conditions of the region have no room for
conflict. We have no bad intention."
</P>
<P>
But, he noted, "how they interpret our maneuvers is for them
to decide and you should ask them about these maneuvers and
their illegitimate presence in the Persian Gulf."
</P>
<P>
"The immediate conflict that we have with the United States
is over the definition of offshore or territorial waters. We
have a definition and we do act according to that," he added.

<HEADLINE> Trial Trade Caravan to Central Asia Successful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 21 (Xinhua) -- The first trial trade
caravan from Pakistan to Central Asia has received a wonderful
response and success, said a high Pakistani official here today.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of Pakistan's National Highway Authority (NHA) Shahid
Siddiqi said that the caravan has proved that Karakorom Highway
(KKH) linking China and Pakistan was a viable, safe and cheap land
route for trade among Pakistan, Central Asian Republics (CAR) and
China.
</P>
<P>
The first trial trade caravan left here for Alma Ata, capital
of Kazakhstan, on November 5 according to a quadripartite
agreement for transit trade signed here on March 9, 1995 among
Pakistan, China, Kazakhstan and Kirgizstan.
</P>
<P>
Talking to the local press, Siddiqi said that the agreement
re-established the centuries-old historical and cultural ties
among these countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that KKH was not only the safest route for transit
trade but also one of the shortest, most viable and cheapest route
than any other route from Pakistan to these countries.
</P>
<P>
The NHA chairman hoped that KKH would prove a landmark by
further cementing the existing bilateral and trade relations among
these countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that after the success of the first trial trade caravan
from Pakistan, a similar trade caravan will come to Pakistan's
southern port city of Karachi from Alma Ata using the KKH route.
</P>
<P>
The first trial caravan, comprising nine trucks of rice and two
trucks of fruits and biscuits, arrived at Alma Ata on November 13
and is expected to return to Pakistan next Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani government will start a three-year upgrading of
the KKH project in the next financial year which would cost 3.2
billion rupees (80 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
After its completion, it would come up to major international
road specification.

<HEADLINE> Resettlement in Sichuan Province Proceeds Smoothly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Work is progressing smoothly
on a project for the resettlement of thousands of people in
southwest China's Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
They have to move home and jobs to make way for the
construction of the gigantic Three Gorges Project.
</P>
<P>
Wushan, Fengjie and Yunyang are the first three counties that
will be affected by the rise of the Yangtze River water level,
because of the damming in a year's time.
</P>
<P>
In the three counties, 165 enterprises in 31 towns need to be
resettled. The three county seats will also be partly submerged.
</P>
<P>
To support the progress of the resettlement, the provincial and
city government departments have given full financial and policy
support to the counties.
</P>
<P>
During the process of resettlement, the three counties have
focused efforts on infrastructure construction, restructuring and
technical upgrading of enterprises, and in-depth development of
agriculture, said vice-provincial governor Gan Yuping.
</P>
<P>
At present, the new seat of Yunyang County has taken shape. The
urban area of the seat has reached six square kilometers, and more
than 200 million yuan (about 24 million US dollars) has been
invested. A four-kilometer long, 30-meter-wide avenue has been
paved. Another five highways, with a total length of 8.7 km, have
been completed.
</P>
<P>
In addition, two waterworks capable of providing 10,000 tons of
supplies, and two sub-stations, have been put into use. Several
major enterprises and banks have already settled in the new seat.

<HEADLINE> PNA Official: Palestinians Are Prepared to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 21 (Xinhua) -- A senior Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) official said today that the
Palestinians are prepared for a confrontation with Israel,
according an Israel Radio report.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference in Ramallah in the West Bank,
PNA Minister of Information Yasser Abed Rabbo, said that Israeli
policies on settlement and Hebron are making confrontation
inevitable.
</P>
<P>
His remark came at a time when the Israeli-Palestinian
negotiations on the Israeli army's redeployment in the West Bank
town of Hebron had gone into a deadlock.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai recently
gave final approval for the construction of 1,200 housing
units in the settlement of Emmanuel in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Emmanuel projects are the first in the settlements to be
initiated by the current Israeli government. And the plans to
build some 2,000 units in Matityah/Kiryat Safer, which have been
approved earlier, were drawn up under the previous government.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, a senior Israeli government source
said that Israel does not oppose a meeting between Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu and PNA President Yasser Arafat to advance the
negotiations on Hebron.
</P>
<P>
However, he added that the meeting should take place only when
the gaps between the two sides are narrowed.
</P>
<P>
The main issue in dispute on Hebron redeployment still
concerns the right of "hot pursuit" of alleged militants claimed
by Israel in the 80 percent of the Hebron to be under Palestinian
rule.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Palestinians have been refusing to renegotiate
the existing agreement, known as the Oslo accords, and would
accept only joint action by mobile units in Palestinian-ruled
areas in Hebron.

China's success has made great contributions to world peace,
friendly cooperation and development, he stressed.
</P>

Qiao Shi's visit to Laos, though the first one, "is an
important mark of historical development of our traditional and
friendly relationship and cooperation," he said.
</P>
<P>
In reply, Qiao Shi said that the Lao people's innovation cause
will achieve greater success under the leadership of the LPRP.
</P>
<P>
The people of China and Laos have fostered a historical
friendship long time ago, Qiao said, adding that in recent years,
the two people have increased their contacts and expanded their
cooperation in all fields, pushing their relationship into a new
era of development.
</P>
<P>
To develop the friendly relations with Laos is an important
part of China's policy of strengthening cooperation with all
neighboring states, he said.
</P>
<P>
He thanked Saman for inviting him to visit the country and
briefed the participants on China's domestic situation and
economic development.

<HEADLINE> Ups And Downs Of Rural Technology Centers In China (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are stories here of the past, when farmers were first
asked to use fertilizers, and rural technicians had to keep
chasing after them to see that the fertilizer didn't get dumped in
ditches, because the white, irritating stuff was thought by the
farmers not to do any good to their crops and soil.
</P>
<P>
And that wasn't all, after the reforms and opening up, many
local governments decided to leave the running of rural technology
centers in the hands of township governments as an austerity
move. And, the results were disastrous. Methane-generating pits,
once popular in the rural areas, now simply became manure pits
lacking technical supervision.
</P>
<P>
Chu said he deplores the fact that, "Because of lack of funds,
we have come to the point where we do everything the township
government needs, including helping the local police to maintain
order and persuade farmers to have fewer children, everything that
is except for research and increasing the use of agricultural
technology."
</P>
<P>
"Most of my staff members have just left," he added dejectedly.
</P>
<P>
Now, however, the work is being done in Anhui, taking control
of rural technology centers back from the township governments, in
terms of personnel and management, increasing investment in them,
and giving exams to recruit new technicians.
</P>
<P>
Although these changes have not fully materialized for Chu, he
is now beginning to calculate just what he will do next
year: introducing a new seed-raising method, making a new kind of
fertilizer suited to the local soil, and so on...

<HEADLINE> Ups and Downs In Rural Technology Centers In China  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Chu Jialin, the head of a rural
technology center in east China's Anhui Province, went to the
prefectural government, along with 50 similar workers from other
towns, to lodge a complaint about the lack of pay for his staff,
last year.
</P>
<P>
The prefectural government, in Fuyang, however, had no way to
help, because the towns under its jurisdiction that were held
responsible for the funding, did not have any money.
</P>
<P>
But, Chu's luck is changing for the better this winter, when
the province will begin a new program for grass-roots centers by
using agriculture technology, as detailed in a provincial
legislative decision.
</P>
<P>
The funding of rural technology centers will become the
responsibility of government at higher levels, instead of the
township governments, according to the provincial decision on
implementing the national Law on Using Agriculture Technology.
</P>
<P>
"This decision is intended to increase the use of technology to
improve agricultural development in accordance with the law," said
Lu Zixiu, deputy director of the standing committee of the
provincial people's congress.
</P>
<P>
"It shows that importance is being given to agriculture
technology," Chu said with delight, after years of fluctuation,
China came to realize that agriculture is the foundation of its
economy and that a steady supply of food and grain is essential to
sustained economic and social development.
</P>
<P>
The central authorities have stated time and again that more
should be invested in agriculture, and that technology should be
used to boost grain production.
</P>
<P>
China has in fact had a network of agricultural technology
centers across the country since the 1960s, playing a major role
in teaching farmers how to use fertilizer and pesticides, and
providing information on planting hybrid rice.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to those people and their work, per-unit yields doubled
several times over the years, and millions of people in northern
China own them a debt of gratitude for the rice they eat today.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 21 (Xinhua) -- China, which joined the
International Convention on Chemicals on January 1, 1995, at the
recommendation of its top legislature, is passing further
legislation to ensure the safe use of dangerous chemicals,
official sources say.
</P>
<P>
Even before joining the Convention, China had more than 30 laws
and regulations on the safe use of chemicals, and since 1995, the
Chinese government has paid more attention to the convention.
</P>
<P>
The labor, chemical industry, public health and public security
ministries as well as the environmental protection agency have
made great efforts at working out more detailed standards for
classification, storage, and safe use of dangerous chemicals.
</P>
<P>
China is a major producer and consumer of chemicals, and has
more than 6,000 large or medium-sized state-owned plants producing
petroleum products, alkalies, pesticides, dyes, medicines, paints,
and fertilizers. There are also more than 20,000 smaller township
enterprises in similar production.
</P>
<P>
Total output of China's chemical industry and exports and
imports of chemicals have been increasing in recent years.

TIRANA, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Dozens of farmers in northwest
Albania face ruin after their homes and livestock were swept away
by rainstorms and floods over the last few days.
</P>
<P>
Heavy rain caused the Drini river, one of the country's main
rivers, to overflow, flooding some 4,000 hectares of land in the
Lezha area, some 80 kilometers north of the capital Tirana,
leaving peasants homeless.
</P>
<P>
The country's railway system has ground to a halt as sections
of the railway in Lezha were destroyed by the floods.
</P>
<P>
The interior ministry has sent rescue workers and the army into
the area to provide disaster relief and emergency repair work.
</P>
<P>
The main cause of the flooding is a lack of efforts for many
years to bring the river under control and failure to repair
farmland drainage systems.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Meets U.S. Senator on Israeli-Syrian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu today met with U.S. Senator Arlen Specter who
is currently mediating the Israeli-Syrian relations.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Specter, just back from Syrian capital
Damascus, quoted Syrian President Hafetz Assad as saying that
there was no escalation of hostility on the Syrian side, and that
the recent Syrian military exercises were only routine.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu reiterated that Israel was not interested in
confrontation with Syria and he hoped the two sides could resume
peace talks as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
After another meeting with Netanyahu Wednesday, Specter
visited Damascus and held meetings with President Assad and
Foreign Minister Farouq Shara to discuss the Israeli-Syrian
tension.
</P>
<P>
Specter conveyed to Assad a calming message from Netanyahu,
who called for the resumption of peace talks. Netanyahu's message
was apparently aimed at allaying Syria's concerns in the wake of
the strong warnings issued by Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The minister warned that if Syria used non-conventional
weapons against Israel, then a devastating attack on Syria which
could topple the Assad regime would be launched.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Israel Radio, Mordechai also accused
Syria of developing a particularly lethal type of nerve gas with
Russia's help, and vowed to retaliate severely if such a weapon
was turned on Israel.
</P>
<P>
Specter tried several weeks ago to mediate between Israel and
Syria after a military tension appeared along the border
following Syria's deployment of troops near the Golan Heights. He
also conveyed a similar message to Assad from Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials acknowledged that political differences
between Israel and Syria made it impossible now to hold a meeting
between the envoys of the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Syrian Ambassador to the U.S. Walid Mualem claimed that he
had turned down an requirement from Israeli Ambassador to the
U.S. Eliahu Ben-Elissar for a meeting with him.
</P>
<P>
Ben-Elissar is back in Israel this week for consultations with
government officials. However, U.S. officials have stated that
they do not expect the Israeli-Syrian talks, suspended from last
March, could be resumed until January 1997 at the earliest.

MOGADISHU, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Mogadishu's chemists on
Wednesday caught an illegal drug producer who sold fake medicine
in the Bakara market and held him as one of the counterfeiters
responsible for the death of hundreds of patients.
</P>
<P>
"This is one of the thugs who has been falsifying the
medicine," the chemists introduced the counterfeiter who received
a blow on the head by every pharmacy owner in the market.
</P>
<P>
The man was caught red-handed selling a new stock of
Stroptmacine, an antibiotic drug usually used for children
suffering from severe bronchitis.
</P>
<P>
The falsifier confessed that he produced the Stroptmacine and
other antibioties.
</P>
<P>
"I would take off the seal and tap of the injection without
damaging it and replace them with my home-made stuff,' he said,
adding that he used baking powder and ground sugar for the
antibiotics as the best convenient elements.
</P>
<P>
The man was later taken to an unknown place.
</P>
<P>
According to one of the medicine business dealers, the drug
business is "the best way of making fortune" in the market.

<HEADLINE> Pawn Shops Flourishing in North China City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Tianjin, north China's largest
port city, has seen the opening of its 17th pawn shop.
</P>
<P>
The latest pawnbroker is located in the Tanggu District, near
an economic and technological development area in the city.
</P>
<P>
Pawn shop has a long tradition in Tianjin. After the People's
Republic of China was founded in 1949, the shops were viewed as
the "product of capitalism" and shut down by the government.
</P>
<P>
Since the open-up policy was initiated in the country in late
1970s, the pawn broking business was allowed to operate again. The
number has been growing, and functions multiplying.
</P>
<P>
Involved in the business are not only banks, but also
businesses and other institutions. Judging from their appearance
it is hard to distinguish a pawn shop from a bank.
</P>
<P>
At present, more than 100 commodities can be pawned, ranging
from household electrical appliances, jewelry and antiques to
machines, vehicles and bulk goods.
</P>
<P>
There are now over 2,000 pawn shops around China, sources say.

<HEADLINE> Forecast of China's Economic Development in 1997 (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Chinese economists have
predicted that the trend in China's economic development in 1997
will be one of moderate growth.
</P>
<P>
The coming year will see China assuming the exercise of
sovereignty over Hong Kong, and the convening of the 15th National
Congress of the Communist Party of China.
</P>
<P>
Some senior leaders of the State Council, China's top governing
body, have stated that China's economy should make greater
successes next year, as a sign of confidence.
</P>
<P>
After achieving a "soft landing" in economic development,
China's economy will attain its full growth on the basis of low
inflation next year.
</P>
<P>
However, analysis shows that the country will not seek an
excessively high growth rate in the coming year, as the economy
will grow on a basis of this year's 10-percent rise.
</P>
<P>
The country's Ninth Five-Year Plan has set the annual rate of
economic growth at eight percent during the 1996-2000 period. But
the growth rate is expected to attain ten percent.
</P>
<P>
Qiu Xiaohua, senior economist at the State Statistical Bureau,
said the central government will not loosen macro-economic control
in a bid to avoid violent ups-and-downs in the economy.
</P>
<P>
There still exists some problems in China's structural reform,
say analysts, citing as one example, state-owned industrial firms
bearing responsibility only for their profits, but not for their
losses.
</P>
<P>
Tight macro-economic control will help enterprises to adapt to
market-oriented development, Qiu said.
</P>
<P>
Investment in fixed assets will remain at a steady growth in
1997, climbing to 2.8 trillion yuan, but the structure of
investment will be optimized. Experts predict that more investment
will flow to agriculture and the technological transformation of
existing enterprises.

<P>
Signs show that rural economic development will occupy an
important position in China's overall economic growth in
1997. Apart from agricultural production, energetic efforts will
be made to build energy and communication facilities, develop
small towns, and accelerate service trades.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics forecast the price index will stand around
6.7 percent next year.
</P>
<P>
China's external trade volume will surpass 320 billion US
dollars next year, with exports expected to grow steadily,
yielding an estimated 170 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Grain crop production will slow down slightly following a rapid
growth for two consecutive years.
</P>
<P>
With the start of a new economic cycle, the building industry,
dominated by housing construction, will come back to life.
</P>
<P>
The new economic cycle will also boost development of
securities, automobile, telecommunications, tourism, and new and
high technology.
</P>
<P>
Reform of state-owned enterprises will spread in all industrial
firms, with enterprises becoming divided as a
consequence. Enterprises with products having a ready market both
at home and abroad will expand production, increase varieties and
improve product quality. Loss-making firms will be closed, turned
to other lines of production, or merged.
</P>
<P>
This year has seen a steady growth in state revenue, more
foreign exchange reserve which is likely to reach 100 billion US
dollars by the end of this year, and increased supplies of raw
materials, energy and communications facilities. All these are
paving the way for economic development in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Kenya To Further Cut Trade Tariff Within COMESA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Kenya is planning to cut its
tariff by 80 percent on goods from the Common Market for Eastern
and Southern Africa (COMESA) as negotiations are underway for
establishing a common tariff for the region by 2005.
</P>
<P>
Kenya has already reduced its tariff for COMESA goods by 70
percent, according to Vice-President George Saitoti who was
speaking at a trade seminar organised by the Kenya Technical
Working Group on the Cross-Border Initiative on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Cross-Border Initiative was established by the Kenyan
government in 1992 with the aim of speeding up economic
integration in the region.
</P>
<P>
Saitoti disclosed that Kenya is pursuing a gradual reform
policy with the objective of achieving, within the COMESA
framework, a maximum rate of 30 percent tariff and at least three
non-zero tariff rates by July next year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Kenyan vice-president urged all the African
countries to reduce the trade and investment barriers in a step
to pursue regional integration in the continent.
</P>
<P>
"As western nations form their own trade and economic blocks,
there is a risk that African countries will be marginalized
further in terms of trade opportunities," he warned.
</P>
<P>
Saitoti said the trade barriers, ranging from macro-economic
imbalance and heavy costs, have proved to be major obstacles to
the economic integration in Africa.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine, Lithuania, Poland Call for Calm in Belarus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, November 20 (Xinhua) -- The presidents of Ukraine,
Lithuania and Poland issued a joint statement today calling on
Belarus' president and parliament to resolve the political crisis
which is threatening to destabilize the country.
</P>
<P>
But the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry emphasized that the three
countries were not trying to interfere in Belarus' internal
affairs. They wanted to show their concern over the bitter
conflict between President Alexander Lukashenko and the
opposition-dominated parliament and its possible effects on peace
and security in the region.
</P>
<P>
Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma, Lithuanian President
Algirdas Brazauskas and Polish President Alexander Kwasniewski
called on both sides to resolve the conflict through
constitutional means and safeguard the democratic rights and
freedom of its citizens.
</P>
<P>
The political situation in the former Soviet republic has
deteriorated over the last few months as President Lukashenko has
stuck to his plan to hold a referendum on November 24 despite
fierce opposition from lawmakers, the Constitutional Court and the
electoral commission.
</P>
<P>
The referendum, which includes amendments to the constitution,
would extend Lukashenko's term of office by two years to the year
2001 and expand his powers. The president has overruled
parliament, the court and the electoral commission in his bid to
push through the referendum.
</P>
<P>
The crisis deepened earlier this week after Prime Minister
Mikhail Chigiry resigned and parliament started impeachment
proceedings against the president to stop him holding the
referendum.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Lukashenko rejected offers by Moscow to mediate
in the conflict and refused to attend proposed peace talks in
Russia.

<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Jorge Valdano, former Argentine
soccer star, have been named to coach Spainish club Valencia as a
successor to Luis Aragones, local reports said.
</P>
<P>
Valdano, who helped Argentina to win the 1986 world cup, was
sacked from Real Madrid in earlier 1996 though he led the team to
a 1995 title.
</P>
<P>
As Valencia took the helm of the squad, speculation was
fanfared that the club will seek the return of Brazilian striker
Romario, who was loaned to Flamengo earlier last month for not
getting along well with Aragones.

<HEADLINE> Business Confidence in Hong Kong Remains High: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Business confidence in Hong
Kong is at a record high, as shown in a latest survey conducted by
the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Over 95 percent of respondents expressed "favorable" or "very
favorable" views of Hong Kong's business environment over the next
five years, as compared to a 91 percent positive response last
year. Survey results confirmed that Hong Kong will remain the
commercial hub in Asia and preferred site for the location of
regional headquarters for AmCham members.
</P>
<P>
"The well-established legal system, superior infrastructure,
communications network, free-port status and low taxes make Hong
Kong a very attractive location for regional business operations,"
said AmCham chairman Mark Michelson today.
</P>
<P>
Maintenance of the rule of law and availability of information
vital to business operations are cited as the most important
factors in assessing Hong Kong's future business environment.
</P>
<P>
As a further indication of the high level of confidence, 99
percent of respondents plan to retain business operations in Hong
Kong. In contrast, only five percent of the total respondents will
reduce their investment. A great majority of 99 percent of
companies expect their performance over the next three years to be
either good or satisfactory.
</P>
<P>
"This is reassuring news, especially during such a crucial
year for Hong Kong," said Michelson.
</P>
<P>
More than 600 Hong Kong-based companies responded to the
questionnaire, representing a record of 57 percent response rate.

</P>
<P>
The second MOU to be signed will have a focus on improving
economic and commercial ties between the two countries through the
exchange of information, and mutual assistance in joint business
ventures in third countries and events such as fairs and
conferences held in each other's market.
</P>
<P>
The third agreement will be concluded to facilitate businessmen
from both countries in developing their business in each other's
market, the TDB said.

<HEADLINE> 62 Percent Of Australian Exports Go To Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 21 (Xinhua) -- The growth of Australian
exports to Asia was continuing at a faster rate than the average,
with Asia's share rising from 49 percent in 1986-87 to 62 percent
in 1995-96.
</P>
<P>
"This represents growth in exports to Asia of over 11 percent
per annum, over three percentage points higher than Australia's
total export average," said the Foreign Affairs and Trade
Department in its latest newsletter today.
</P>
<P>
"With nearly two-thirds of Australia's total exports
Asia-bound, our trading and economic future is very much dependent
on continued export growth to that region," the department said.
</P>
<P>
And the exports outlook is promising, the department said, with
boom growth in exports to Vietnam (up 45 percent over the decade),
Brunei (up 26 percent), Thailand (25 percent), Sri Lanka (24
percent) and Indonesia (20 percent).
</P>
<P>
Looking over the export situation as a whole, the department
believes that Australian merchandise exports could exceed 100
billion Australian dollars (80 billion US dollars) by 2000-2001 if
current trends continued.
</P>
<P>
Export growth of more than 13 percent in 1995-96 was the
fastest rate of growth since the late 1980s and contributed to an
average eight percent growth over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
According to another source, Australia's exports in 1995 were
at the level of 53 billion US dollars by an increase of 12 percent
over the previous year, while the imports reached 57 billion US
dollars, increasing 15 percent over 1994.

<HEADLINE> Treasury Profitability Recovers on Singapore Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Treasury profits recovered
in 1995, after sustaining a sharp decline in the previous year,
with total profits rising by 21 percent to 1.39 billion Singapore
dollars (about 992.86 million US dollars) from the 1994 level, the
Singapore Foreign Exchange Market Committee (SFEMC) revealed
today.
</P>
<P>
In its latest annual report, which was published today, the
SFEMC said that among the three main product groups, namely,
foreign exchange, money and capital markets, foreign exchange
exhibited the sharpest improvement over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
But this rebound in profitability did not keep up with the
surge in foreign exchange turnover, it noted.
</P>
<P>
It said that total revenue contributed by foreign exchange rose
by 43 percent from 1994 to 792 million Singapore dollars (about
565.71 million US dollars) in 1995, which was lower than the
average 870 million Singapore dollars (about 621.43 million US
dollars) recorded over 1990 to 1994.
</P>
<P>
The SFEMC also highlighted in its report the phenomenal growth
and revolutionary changes in financial markets, and the challenges
and risks faced by financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
Volatility in exchange and interest rates, a strong influx of
foreign capital, accelerated intra-Asian trade flows as well as
financial and economic deregulation in the region have generated
tremendous opportunities for financial institutions to expand the
scope and volume of Treasury activities, it said.

TOKYO, November 21 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Finance (MOF)
has already started probing Asahi Bank, which is charged by
U.S. financial authorities with an illegal act at its New York
branch, and is considering a penalty, Kyodo News Service quoted
ministry officials as saying Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Financial industry sources in New York late Wednesday revealed
that the Federal Reserve Board has found that officials at Asahi
Bank's New York branch this summer illegally opened the seal of
Fed inspection documents on the bank and read the contents.
</P>
<P>
The strictly confidential documents, containing results of a
regular Fed inspection a year earlier, were under entrusted
custody at the branch.
</P>
<P>
Shigehiko Yoshino, president of the Tokyo-based major
commercial bank, admitted the wrongdoing to a Kyodo News reporter
late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the MOF officials, Japanese financial authorities
learned about the incident early this summer. Since then the MOF
has received detailed data from the Fed's investigations on the
New York branch's action, they said.
</P>
<P>
The officials said the MOF will decide about penalty for the
bank, after Fed punishment is determined.

</P>
<P>
The fuselage and most of the victims' bodies, however, still remain

<P>
BEIJING, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Samples carried on a Chinese
retrievable satellite, which returned to earth on November 4, were
officially presented today to Japan.
</P>
<P>
The handover of objects that went on the space ride marked the
first time that China had conducted a micro-gravity experimental
piggyback service on a retrievable satellite for Japan.
</P>
<P>
The satellite was blasted into space from China by an LM-2D
carrier rocket on a 15 day mission in October.
</P>
<P>
The samples carried on the satellite were in good condition,
with remote sensors gathering important data, officials said.
</P>
<P>
In September of last year, China Great Wall Industry
Corporation (CGWIC) signed a piggyback service contract with
Narubeni Corporation of Japan, as well as another agreement for a
joint micro-gravity experiment.
</P>
<P>
According to officials, CGWIC, China Academy of Launch Vehicle
Technology, Lanzhou Physics Institute under the Chinese Academy of
Sciences, and Japan's Narubeni Corporation and Waseda University,
have carried out successful simultaneous ground experiments over
the past year.
</P>
<P>
CGWIC officials said today that China wants to promote
Sino-Japanese cooperation in space technology in the future.
</P>
<P>
China has already provided satellite piggyback services for

<HEADLINE> China Attaches Great Importance to Upgrading Women's Status (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, November 21 (Xinhua) -- The social status of women in
China has taken a leap forward, a report released by the
Asia-Pacific Conference on Economic and Women Resource
Development, held in Hangzhou, capital of southeast China's
Zhejiang Province, has revealed.
</P>
<P>
More girls and women are receiving education than ever, rural
women form half of the backbone of the country's agricultural
industry, and hundreds of women are walking the corridors of power
as provincial governors and state officials.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government attaches great importance to the
education of female citizens. It has taken measures to raise the
school entrance rate of female students, and to provide more
opportunities for them to receive further education.
</P>
<P>
In some inland, poor and ethnic minority regions, the local
governments have established girl-only classes and girl's schools,
and even offered free education for girl students to protect their
right to education.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the state has achieved some progress in women adult
education and professional training, with almost 1,700 women's
vocational schools and three universities established nationwide.
</P>
<P>
More than 13 million women are studying in adult universities.
</P>
<P>
The current percentage of illiterate women in China has
decreased remarkably.
</P>
<P>
Over the recent years, women have had more employment
opportunities than ever before, and their employment level has
been increasingly upgraded.
</P>
<P>
In state-run enterprises, women play an important role. The
rate of women employed is nearly equal to, or even higher than
that of men in some professions, such as social service, finance
and insurance, education, culture and arts.
</P>
<P>
In medical services, social welfare, and sports, female
employees accounts for 55 percent of the total.

CAIRO, November 21 (Xinhua) -- The rainstorms which hit
southern Egypt throughout the week flooded thousands of acres of
farmland, damaged highways and destroyed scores of makeshift
houses, a local newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The torrential rains also caused a ship carrying 128 Czech,
Slovak and Polish tourists and an Egyptian crew to sink last

In Mallawi in Al-Minya, 260 houses were flooded and rescue
teams attempted to evacuate the inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
Four tourist charter planes were diverted to Cairo Airport from

<HEADLINE> Liberalization May Accentuate Corruption: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Indian Home Minister
Indrajit Gupta said today that the menace of corruption would be
further accentuated "if we are not careful about our economic
liberalization policies".
</P>
<P>
This was evident from the growing number and magnitude of
economic offenses including corruption at high places, he said
while addressing the 13th biennial conference of officers of the
Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), state anti-corruption
bureaus and chief vigilance officers of public sector
undertakings.
</P>
<P>
The functioning of parliamentary democracy for half a century
in the country had brought to fore the vulnerability of the Indian
policy through heightened separatist and fundamentalist tendencies
and subversion of various institutions through corruption, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The home minister called upon the agencies to put their act
together in combating corruption and expedite investigations into
the several important and sensational cases being handled by the
CBI.

<HEADLINE> Nyerere's Stick Proposed to Be Kept in Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 21 (Xinhua) -- The Dar es Salaam
businessman who bought retired President Mwalimu Julius Nyerere's
trademark staff with 4.5 million Tanzania Shillings (about 7,500
U.S. Dollars) has handed the stick back to Mwalimu.
</P>
<P>
The official Daily News today qouted the businessman, Ahmed
Bora, as saying that he had returned the stick to Mwalimu at his
Msasani residence in the city last Friday and asked him to hand
it to the National Museum.
</P>
<P>
Bora, who owns a supermarket and other businesses in the city,
bought the famous stick at a dinner to raise money for the Mwalimu
Nyerere Education Trust Fund last September.
</P>
<P>
He said here on Wednesday that he attached national importance to
the staff and wanted it be kept in a place where everybody could see
it.
</P>
<P>
"I thought it would have been unfair for me to keep the staff at my
home. After all I don't deserve it. That is a very valuable thing
which everybody should have access to," he said, adding that National
Museum was the right place.
</P>
<P>
The businessman further said his objective was to contribute
to the fund and not to own the stick.
</P>
<P>
He said even after buying the staff he left it with the fund
until last Friday when he took it to hand it back to Mwalimu.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Jordanian Parliament Session </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, November 21 (Xinhua) -- The tensions between the
Jordanian government and the Opposition would be escalated with
the latter suffering a crushing defeat in the elections for the
Lower House speakership Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The reelection of Saad Hail El Sorour, who is now on his third
consecutive term of speakership, was widely seen as a "vote of
confidence in the Prime Minister Abdul Karim Kabariti and his
government.
</P>
<P>
Kabariti had expressed his government's favor of Sorour as the
new speaker even before the current fourth and last session of
the 12th Parliament was opened by King Hussein Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
But the 46 votes Sorour scored were less than expected while
his opposition contender from Islamic Action Front (IAF), Ibrahim
Kilani won a more-than-expected number of 29 votes.
</P>
<P>
The Opposition failed to get the posts of the first and second
deputy speakers, nor of their two assistants. The Lower House
secretariat also fell in the pro-government hands.
</P>
<P>
Observers said the session is expected to be a stormy one, with
the cornered Opposition bloc in the House vowing to use arm
twisting tactics against the government, particularly its economic
policies.
</P>
<P>
The government wants the Lower House to sift through draft laws
on companies, securities, customs, protection of national
industry, investment management over state-owned properties,
competitiveness, prohibiting monopoly and the protection of state
funds.
</P>
<P>
Another point expected for hot debate lies is the reform of the
one-person, one-vote election mode, which is seen by most deputies
as a weak point in the Jordanian democracy, said the observers.
</P>
<P>
The Opposition bloc has long been fighting for the endorsement
of the proportional representation system which is believed to be
less vulnerable to influence by the government.
</P>
<P>
The third target of Opposition attack would be the bread and
fodder price reform, which sparked riots in the south of the
Kingdom last August.
</P>
<P>
The Opposition boycotted the last extraordinary session during
the bread and fodder debate.
</P>
<P>
Observers stressed that the Opposition's determination to block
any government major policy would make the current parliamentary
session a challenging one for the government.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Hunan Province in central
China has established a breeding center for salamanders, a rare
lizard-like amphibian animal.
</P>
<P>
Due to deteriorating ecological conditions, there is only a
small number of salamanders living around the globe, according to
experts.
</P>
<P>
The breeding center is located in the province's mountainous
Shimen County, where underground rivers and limestone caves make
ideal living conditions for salamanders.
</P>
<P>
Salamanders inhabit more than 2,600 square kilometers, about
two-thirds of the county's total territory.
</P>
<P>
Since 1994, biologists in the county have been cooperating with
researchers in universities and research institutions on the
protection and breeding of salamanders.
</P>
<P>
Some 100 salamanders are living in the center. In three years,
the number is expected to reach 5,000.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Most local building firms are on
the verge of collapse because of lack of business and the high cost
of building materials, according to today's Times of Zambia.
</P>
<P>
The local newspaper quoted Chairman of Hi-Build Constractors Arab
Sakala as urging on Wednesday the government to check the situation.
</P>
<P>
He said in Ndola, northern Zambia, "most of our building
firms are threatened with closure because they can't withstand stiff
competition from some foreign construction companies and high cost
building materials.''
</P>
<P>
He said prices of local building materials are very high compared
to imported ones which are being used by most foreign construction
companies.
</P>
<P>
''Because of this, foreign firms are getting a big share of the
construction jobs as compared to locals because they are able to
source cheap imported materials,'' said Sakala.
</P>
<P>
Sakala called on the government to look into the problems
besetting the local building industry to enable it to compete
favourably with foreign firms. enditem

<HEADLINE> Mahathir Holds Talks With Fujimori </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia and Peru today
agreed that non-economic matters such as labor, human rights and
the environment should not be turned into issues which could
influence the decisions at the World Trade Organization (WTO)
meeting in Singapore next month.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached between Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad and Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori during
their talks here, Malaysian Rural Development Minister Annuar Musa
said at a news briefing on the talks.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir also reiterated Malaysia's readiness to support
Peru's admission to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)
forum during the talks, Annuar Musa said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian King Tuanku Ja'afar earlier expressed Malaysia's
support for Peru's bid to become an APEC member at a banquet last
night in honor of the Peruvian President.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia, which also expressed its support for Vietnam's
admission, felt APEC should not be an exclusive club and all
countries of the Asia-Pacific Rim should have the right to be
members irrespective of their economic condition.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir and Fujimori also discussed bilateral cooperation in
the forestry, agricultural, trade and tourism fields.
</P>
<P>
Peru was keen on adopting Malaysia's sustainable timber
development policy and invited Malaysians to introduce sustainable
logging there.
</P>
<P>
The Peruvian President felt Malaysia could serve as a model
for Peru in the area of selective logging and replacement of
forests with oil palm and rubber.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia requested landing rights in Lima, Peru's capital, for
Malaysia Airlines which now served Buenos Aires.
</P>
<P>
Both leaders witnessed the signing of a Memorandum of
Understanding between Malaysian Foreign Trade Development
Corporation (MATRADE) and the Commission for the Promotion of
Exports of the Republic of Peru (PROMPEX) to facilitate mutual
cooperation on trade promotion.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia-Peru trade last year totaled 256.1 million ringgit
(about 102.44 million US dollars) with Malaysia's imports from the
Latin American nation totaling 224.4 million ringgit (about 89.76
million US dollars) and exports amounting to 31.7 million ringgit

<HEADLINE> Manila Action Plan Ready to Be Submitted to APEC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Senior officials from 18 member
economies of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum
today completed their work on the Manila Action Plan for APEC
(MAPA) and are ready to submit it to the ministers who will begin
their meeting Friday.
</P>
<P>
With the MAPA, "APEC enters the implementation phase of its
work program towards the realization of the Seattle vision of a
community of Asia Pacific economies and the attainment of the
Bogor goals," said Philippine Foreign Affairs Undersecretary
Federico Macaranas, concurrent chair of the just concluded Senior
Officials Meeting.
</P>
<P>
At Blake Island in 1993, APEC leaders enunciated a vision of a
community of Asia Pacific economies, and in Bogor in 1994, they
articulated a goal of free trade and investment by 2010 for
industrialized members and 2020 for developing members.
</P>
<P>
Macaranas said the MAPA has three components: individual
economy action plans, a collective action plan and joint
activities in economic and technical cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He said that in their individual action plans, the members
proposed greater market access by mapping out actions to
progressively reduce tariffs and non-tariff barriers and ensure
transparency of their respective non-tariff measures.
</P>
<P>
To enhance market access in services, a significant number of
APEC members submitted plans to progressively open services
markets.
</P>
<P>
They also submitted plans on trade and investment faciliation
areas, such as cutting customs costs, ensuring consumer safety and
facilitating mobility of business people by creating an APEC
Business Travel Card.
</P>
<P>
Macaranas said the MAPA also contains member economies'
commitments to strengthening the public-private partnership in
infrastructure development in areas such as energy, electricity,
telecommunications and transport.
</P>
<P>
He said that economic and technical cooperation is a major part
of the MAPA.

<HEADLINE> North China Sending Fewer Silt into Yellow River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, November 21 (Xinhua) -- North China's Shanxi Province
now sends 200 million tons of silt into the Yellow River every
year -- half the amount in the 1970s -- thanks to sustained
efforts to harness the river.
</P>
<P>
The Yellow River, the country's second longest and one of the
world's muddiest, flows in a north-south direction along the
western border of Shanxi.
</P>
<P>
Each year, Shanxi contributes one quarter of the Yellow River's
total silt volume, which is the product of soil erosion that has
affected 67,600 sq km of the Yellow River Basin in Shanxi, or 45
percent of the province's entire territory.
</P>
<P>
Over the past decades, the people of Shanxi have effectively
controlled soil erosion by planting more cash trees, establishing
forest protection belts and growing grass.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the province has also earmarked 20 million yuan each
year for controlling soil erosion in valleys for three major
tributaries of the Yellow River, which has helped to reduce the
volume of mud sent into the main stream from Shanxi.
</P>
<P>
The province has also introduced funds from the World Food
Program and the World Bank for water conservancy projects on the
Loess Plateau.
</P>
<P>
Under the "3923 Project" sponsored by the World Food Program,
Shanxi has brought more than 22,000 hectares of soil-eroded land
under control, including the construction of more than 7,000
hectares of farmland, orchards and forest belts.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, November 21 (Xinhua) -- The head of the Bank of Japan
(BOJ) has asked depositors of Hanwa Bank on Thursday to act
sensibly following an order issued by the Finance Ministry earlier
in the day for the bank to stop all operations except for paying
back deposits, Kyodo News Service reported.
</P>
<P>
As in every past failure of financial institutions, all
deposits will be protected, said BOJ Governor Yasuo Matsushita.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark at a press conference urgently held at the
central bank's Tokyo headquarters after the ministry issued the
order effectively shutting down the second-tier regional bank
based in Wakayama, western Japan.
</P>
<P>
"It is truly regrettable that we have seen the failure of
several financial institutions since the year before last,"
Matsushita said.
</P>
<P>
The central bank believes that prompt measures to deal with
insolvent financial institutions without delay will lead to the
early rejuvenation of the functions of Japan's financial system,
he said.

BEIJING, November 21 (Xinhua) -- During an inspection visit to

The official was startled when, to his surprise the prisoner,

Beneath the raised trousers leg was a lengthy operation
scar. The inmate explained to the official with affection: "I had

A farmer from Jiangxi Province in east China, the inmate
had suffered varicose veins since childhood.
</P>
<P>
"Neither my parents nor I myself could afford an operation," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He was sent to a hospital in the nearby city soon after his
arrival at the prison. The prison authority not only covered the
expenses of the operation, but also sent him nutriments for a
speedy recovery.
</P>
<P>
"I am most impressed by the humanitarian treatment we criminals
have received from the people's government," he claimed heartily.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government always requires prisons across the
country to treat their inmates with humanity.
</P>
<P>
"Though their crimes should be punished through imprisonment
and labor, the criminals should be given humanitarian treatment,
which can help them to realize their own guilt and accept
rehabilitation," said a Ministry of Justice official.
</P>
<P>
Chinese prisons usually provide all daily necessities for
inmates from poor families, and often send gifts to inmates who
have no visitors, on occasions of major festivals.
</P>
<P>
In the inmates' canteen at the Zhejiang No.1 Prison, a
blackboard on the wall displays the daily menu for the inmates.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 21 (Xinhua) -- The number of people suffering
from diabetes in Beijing is on the increase, accounting for 5.3
percent of the city's inhabitants among the 20-75 age group.
</P>
<P>
Experts claim that increasing number of people in the Chinese
capital becoming diabetic at a younger age is because of less
physical exercise, and consuming too much pork, sugar and oil,
according to the Beijing daily.
</P>
<P>
They warn that diabetes has become one of the major threats to
public health, as it is easy for sufferers to suffer other chronic
diseases.
</P>
<P>
In 1980, the diabetes rate in Beijing was only 1.1 percent
among its adult population, about one fifth of the present level. The
excessively fat rate among children under the age of 14, now
totalling 11 million, reached 16 percent, also much higher than
years before.
</P>
<P>
China now has 20 million diabetics, and there numbers are being
swelled each year by another 750,000 victims.
</P>
<P>
Some experts hold that the diabetes can be prevented and cured,
provided the correct treatment methods are used.

ANKARA, November 21 (Xinhua) -- More than 2,000 schools are
closed this year in southeastern Turkey due to the continuing
violence by rebels, local newspaper Daily News reported today.
</P>
<P>
More than 120 teachers have been murdered by the illegal
Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), which has been fighting a
12-year-old separatist war for self-rule in the southeast.
</P>
<P>
The report said the PKK views teachers as easy targets. And
fearing for their lives, many teachers are reluctant to continue
their jobs in the region.
</P>
<P>
The troubled region needs at least 1,500 more teachers,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Officials said one possible solution to the problem is the
establishment of regional boarding schools in urban areas, which
will be under better protection against PKK attacks.

reiterated Tanzania has no plans to send troops to eatern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
"Already we have a heavy burden of taking care of refugees from
Zaire, so let countries free from this burden send troops," said

</P>
<P>
The Tanzanian foreign minister said it was better and reasonable

Also listed out on the board are proportions of various
nutrients contained in everyday food. The statistics are obtained
with the help of special computer software designed by medical
experts.
</P>
<P>
"We should not only let the inmates have enough to eat, but
also make the food as good and nutritious as possible," Warden
Zheng Ronghua said.
</P>
<P>
Unlike most prisons in the world, the meeting rooms for inmates
and their visitors at the No.1 Prison are only partially cordoned
off, with the lower half of partition glass removed.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that it could be more helpful to the rehabilitation
of criminals if we let them have a chance to shake their wives'
hands, or caress their babies or children," Zheng explained.
</P>
<P>
At the entrance to the meeting rooms, a poster catches the eyes
of each visitor. It welcomes families or friends of the inmates to
send requests to a song dedication program recently started on the
prison's cable TV network.
</P>
<P>
"It could help the reform of your relatives or friends here,"
it says.
</P>
<P>
Impelled by the humanitarian measures of the prison authority,
many criminals, who had turned a blind eye to their own guilt and
refused to change, gradually took on a new look.
</P>
<P>
"We have reduced sentence terms for nearly 30 percent of our
inmates for their good performance," Zheng Ronghua said.

<P>
In 1990, the prison started to give a few inmates holidays of 7
to 15 days during the Spring Festival, the most important
traditional festival for the Chinese.

"In the past five years, we have given holidays to over 280
prisoners. None of them tried to escape or returned late," Zheng

<HEADLINE> Agricultural Industrialization Bringing Benefits to Liaoning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, November 21 (Xinhua) -- On average, a peasant in Dawa
County in northeast China's Liaoning Province will have an income
of 5,000 yuan (600 US dollars) in 1996 -- three times the figure
in the rest of the province.
</P>
<P>
The difference is due to Dawa's push for agricultural
industrialization, particularly to develop agriculture
by-products, raise fish, shrimp and crabs, and build greenhouses
for vegetables.
</P>
<P>
Seven other areas are successfully following Dawa's example.
</P>
<P>
Shenyang, Liaoning's capital, serves as a model of efficient
agriculture practices for other major cities, and has established
50 large agriculture by-product bases.
</P>
<P>
In the city, there are now nearly 2,600 enterprises connected
with the processing, storing and transporting of agricultural
products, bringing in a yearly transaction volume of five billion
yuan (600 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The city has set up 1,300 agriculture enterprises, which have
employed tens of thousands of peasants in the agriculture industry.
</P>
<P>
The grain output of the Liaoning Province reaped an annual 15
billion kilograms over the past five years, and is expected to
reach at least 16 billion kilograms in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Currently, all residents in Liaoning can have an amount of meat
equal to the world's average consumption level, and their
consumption rate of eggs is twice world's average. Every year,
Liaoning sends millions of pigs and more than 300 million
kilograms of vegetables to other areas in China.

NEW DELHI, November 21 (Xinhua) -- The Steering Committee of
India's ruling United Front (UF) Wednesday failed to end the
stalemate among the 14 coalition parties on the vexed issue of the
pace of economic reforms, informed sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
Despite harsh criticism by the left parties at the crucial
meeting, Finance Minister P. Chidambaram reportedly refused to
withdraw the Insurance Amendment Bill which proposes to pave the
way for foreign participation in the insurance sector in the
country.
</P>
<P>
He said that the bill was in the drafting stage and would be
introduced in the current winter session of parliament, which
began here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The two left parties in the coalition -- the Communist Party of
India (CPI) and the Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPM) --
said they would vote against the Insurance Amendment Bill.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Chidambaram and Industry Minister Murasoli
Maran also re-affirmed the role of the public sector units (PSUs)
in the economy and assured the left parties that steps would be
taken to revive the sick units.
</P>
<P>
The UF embraces middle and left regional parties, which
formulated a minimum common program after the UF came into power
in June year
</P>
<P>
However, some left parties are not happy with the government's
economic policies.

<HEADLINE> Inner Mongolia Switches on Power Corridor (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HUHHOT, November 21 (Xinhua) -- A huge energy corridor,
surrounded by numerous power, coal and oil projects, is taking
shape in north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Dotted along the thousand-mile grassland region from the east
to the west are projects that will serve as a driving force in
local economic growth, local government officials told Xinhua
recently.
</P>
<P>
Sparsely-populated Inner Mongolia is rich in natural resources,
particularly coal reserves and wind power. Now coal-fired energy
has become a pillar industry in local economy, accounting for
one-seventh of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
In the western areas, two 100,000-kilowatt units have been
installed in the Haibohai Power Plant, whose second-phase projects
are under construction, while two 330,000-kilowatt units are
already in operation in the Dalate Power Plant along the Yellow
River, China's second largest waterway.
</P>
<P>
Under the Great Wall, which snakes through China's northern
provinces and autonomous regions, lies a power complex with a
capacity of 1.2 million kilowatts. And construction of a 13.5-
billion-yuan gigantic power project, named the Tuoketuo Power
Plant, is expected to start next September.
</P>
<P>
With the completion of various projects, the power corridor in
Inner Mongolia now boasts a electricity-generating capacity of
5.86 million kilowatts.

<HEADLINE> Russian Language Study Booming in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, November 21 (Xinhua) -- In the 1950s, Russian was the
most favored foreign language in China, with almost all Chinese
schools offering courses in the Slav native tongue.
</P>
<P>
During the 60s and 70s, Russian was shelved when China and the
former Soviet Union became enemies, deploying millions of troops
along their common borders.
</P>
<P>
Now, though English has taken over as the country's dominant
foreign language, Russian has regained some of its popularity.
</P>
<P>
To date, about 300,000 Chinese college and middle school
students are studying Russian as their first foreign language,
second to the millions of China's English-language students.
</P>
<P>
A number of Chinese students and teachers have won
international fame for their study and research of Russian.
</P>
<P>
So far, seven Chinese teachers of Russian have won the Pushkin
Award, the top prize for Russian study. And 20 Chinese students
received gold medals at the Seventh and Eighth International
Russian Olympic Competitions.
</P>
<P>
"Besides Russian-speaking countries, China has the largest
group of Russian language students, and the highest level in
Russian language teaching," said V. G. Kostomarov, Chairman of
International Russian Language and Literature Teachers Federation,
who came here to attend a seminar on Russian language teaching.
</P>
<P>
According to the research society, when China resumed its
Russian language research and teaching in local schools in the
late 70s, there was a severe shortage of textbooks and a new style
of teaching.
</P>
<P>
Since then, experts have compiled new textbooks and improved
old textbooks and teaching materials.
</P>
<P>
With the help of the China Research Society on Russian Language
Teaching, more than 60 Chinese universities, including Hangzhou
University, Beijing Foreign Languages University and Shanghai
Foreign Languages University have conducted joint research on
Russian pronunciation, grammar and vocabulary.
</P>
<P>
A number of new textbooks and reference materials have been
published. The "Chinese-Russian Dictionary" and "Russian Grammar,"
written by Chinese experts, are among the best reference books for
Russian language teachers and students.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, many well-known Russian novels and academic works
have been published in China, which has further boosted the
popularity of Russian language and literature in the country.

Hong Kong students also made good performance in math with a
score of 588, ranking the fourth, while their score in science was
much lower, standing at 522 and the 24th place.
</P>
<P>
The tests show that American eighth graders scored 500 in math,
lower than the international average of 513, and slightly better
in science with 534, above the 516 average.
</P>
<P>
South Africa was the last on the ranking list with scores of
354 in math and 326 in science.
</P>
<P>
U.S. educators expect to use the study to compare students with
their peers abroad.
</P>
<P>
The study found 86 percent of U.S. math teachers and 75 percent
of German math teachers assigned homework three to five times a
week, compared with 21 percent of Japanese teachers.
</P>
<P>
And 38 percent of U.S. eighth graders spend three or more hours
watching television or videos after school, compared with 39

<HEADLINE> China, Norway Sign Anti-doping Memorandum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 21 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Olympic Committee
(COC) and the Norwegian Olympic Committee (NOC) signed an
anti-doping memorandum here on Thursday, agreeing to join hands to
strive for clean sports.
</P>
<P>
The memorandum stipulates that Chinese athletes competing in
Norway will receive doping tests there while Norwegian athletes in
China will be checked here.
</P>
<P>
The two nation's sports ruling bodies also agreed to carry out
wideranging cooperation including free and continuous exchange of
information of anti-doping subjects.
</P>
<P>
The memorandum will run for a period of four years as long as
neither side has indicated, by means of six months written
notification, its intention to terminate it.
</P>
<P>
China has signed similar memorandums with Australia, Canada and
Sweden since 1994.
</P>
<P>
Hans Skaseth, head of sports division of Culture Ministry of
Norway, and COC vice president Lou Dapeng signed the memorandum.
</P>
<P>
Lou said that the memorandums signed with other nations showed
China's determination to combat doping in sports.
</P>
<P>
Lou added that China's efforts in anti-doping campaign were
based on the regulations of the Internaional Olympic Committee and
the international sports federations.
</P>
<P>
"COC had tested 2,000 athletes this year," Lou said. "Some top
athletes received seven to eight tests and most of the checks were
flying tests."
</P>
<P>
During this season before the Atlanta Olympic Games, Lou said,
China's world-famed distance runner Wang Junxia was tested for 12
times and women's ace swimmer Le Jingyi for 10 times.
</P>
<P>
Both athletes were proved innocent and each brought home a gold
medal from Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
"Norway and other Nordic nations have taken an earlier step in
anti-doping campaign, so China can learn much from their
experience through the cooperation," said Yang Tianle, chief of
the Medical Committee of Sports Ministry of China.
</P>
<P>
The cooperation is also helpful for some western countries to
cast away prejudice on China in the fight against doping, said
Yang, also a member of IOC Medical Committee.
</P>
<P>
Skaseth praised China's efforts in combating doping over the
past few years and said: "China has played a very important role
in international sports and will continue so. And it has a system
for combating doping and is more and more conformed with
international procedures."
</P>
<P>
According to Skaseth, apart from China, Noway has also signed
anti-doping memorandums with Canada, Britain, Australia, New
Zealand and France.

<HEADLINE> China Finds Solution to Shortage of High-grade Boron </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, November 21 (Xinhua) -- China has developed a
technology to make possible the comprehensive use of the low-grade
mineral boron, widely used in the production of ceramics, glass,
fodder, medicine and fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
China is rich in boron resources, but after decades of
development, high-grade boron resources have been reducing.
</P>
<P>
East China's Liaoning Province, known as the "Boron Province,"
has 64 percent of the country's reserves of boron resources, but
most are low-grade. The province has been researching methods to
develop low-grade boron resources for years.
</P>
<P>
A research group led by Prof. Hu Desheng with the Dalian
University of Science and Engineering, has conducted experiments
in the field since 1992.
</P>
<P>
The new technology illustrates that China has fundamentally
solved the grave shortage of high-grade boron resources, said a
scientist.
</P>
<P>
Using the technology, a factory capable of producing 10,000
tons of boric acid will be built in Kuandian County in the
province.

<HEADLINE> Yuan Expected to Rise Further in Fourth Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 21 (Xinhua) -- The value of Chinese currency
is expected to rise slightly in the fourth quarter of this year,
according to a research report by the Shanghai-based China Foreign
Exchange Trading System.
</P>
<P>
The foreign exchange supply currently exceeds demand -- a
situation that will not change in the fourth quarter, today's
"China Securities Daily" quoted the report as saying.
</P>
<P>
The local yuan appreciated against the US dollar in the first
three quarters as a result of a continuous oversupply of foreign
exchange, the report said.
</P>
<P>
It said that China will continue to report a surplus in its
balance of international payments in the fourth quarter, thanks to
a recovery of exports and a steady drop in imports.
</P>
<P>
China is also expected to enjoy a considerable year-round
surplus under the capital account, the report said.
</P>
<P>
"Overall, China's surplus on the balance sheet of international
payments will be bigger than last year," the report said.
</P>
<P>
It noted that China's two interest cuts, in May and August,
will not force the yuan to retreat against the US dollar by
triggering a big outflow of capital.
</P>
<P>
A moderately tight economic policy and a moderate economic
growth rate will support the yuan's stability, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The yuan was quoted at 8.30 against the US currency today,
compared with 8.70 on the first trading day after China unified
its official exchange rate with that at the swap market in January
of 1994. The yuan has gained slightly against the dollar in recent
months.
</P>
<P>
The yuan is traded against three currencies at the Shanghai
Foreign Exchange Trading System -- the US dollar, the Hong Kong
dollar and the Japanese yen.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Experts Awarded for Great Contribution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Ophthalmologist William
C. Conrad has spent three years working in China, helping
thousands of visually-impaired people regain their eyesight. Now
his work is being publicly praised by the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
The 60-year-old American eye doctor and other six foreigners,
who were invited by northwest China's Gansu Province to work
in the region, have been awarded the "Dunhuang Prize" for their
contributions to local economic growth and social development.
</P>
<P>
They are the first group of foreign experts in Gansu to win the
honor. The prize was named after the Dunhuang Mogao Grottoes, a
famous historic site and a symbol of Gansu.
</P>
<P>
Before coming to Gansu in 1993, Dr. Conrad was the president of
an ophthalmology association in the Untied States. Working with
Chinese counterparts, he has performed cataract operations and
artificial crystalline lens transplants for more than 1,800
patients living in poor areas - all free of charge.
</P>
<P>
"Foreign experts take advantage of new technology and rich
working experience to help us develop our economy. Their hard work
has been welcomed by local people," said an official of Foreign
Affairs Office of the provincial government. "They deserve the
honor."
</P>
<P>
Other prize winners are Fely Villareal, a senior consultant
with the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations;
Prof. Alex C P Chu and Prof. John Hodgson from Massey University
of New Zealand; and Yoshiaki Furuhata, Takeo Sue and Takeo Ito
from Japan.
</P>
<P>
Fely Villareal has carried out a project called "Women,
Population and Development" in northwest China's poor areas for
eight years, involving some 50,000 women who have received some
education and whose incomes have increased.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese experts have taught local farmers techniques to
plant fruit trees and trained workers in animal husbandry. With
their help, many farmers have been able to shake off poverty and
improve their lives.

<P>
NEW DELHI, November 21 (Xinhua) -- India's Textile Ministry is
considering the demands of textile export-oriented units (EOUs)
for exemption from a cess on production of textile items, relaxing
curbs on export of cotton waste and allowing EOUs to sell their
products in the domestic tariff area (DTA), Textile Ministry
sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
The ministry will also consider changes in the norms for fixing
yarn export quotas.
</P>
<P>
Textile EOUs have been arguing that they should be allowed to
export cotton waste, especially comber noil waste, since it is an
integral part of production of yarn. The imposition of minimum
export price restriction has led to serious problems.
</P>
<P>
The ministry will also review the quota restriction on yarn
exports, especially to the European Union, which is said to be
affecting exports, the same sources said.

<HEADLINE> New False Teeth Give Dentals Plenty to Smile About </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Chinese dental experts are
beaming with success after a new type of artifical tooth earned
smiles of approval.
</P>
<P>
The quality of artificial teeth fitted in China has improved,
with 90 percent of the 4,000 new-style artificial teeth still
functioning well after five years.
</P>
<P>
A new type of artificial tooth, made of pure titanium, is
connected to the tooth roots, and made from activated material.
</P>
<P>
Patients can eat properly with the new teeth, and will not have
the uncomfortable sensation of foreign bodies in their mouths.
</P>
<P>
Chen Yu'an, a professor at Huaxi Medical University headed a
group to carry out studies on artificial teeth in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Through 10 years of research they found a new technique for
making artificial teeth, and introduced it to the Tooth Planting
Center, which developed the technique into the method now widely
used.
</P>
<P>
The center, the first of its kind in China, was set up by the
Ministry of Public Health in Chengdu, capital city of southwest
China's Sichuan Province in November, 1991.
</P>
<P>
It has trained 1,500 dentists in dental surgery, and introduced
the new technique to many areas, including Hong Kong, Macao,
Taiwan.

<HEADLINE> APEC Officials Conclude Preparations For Subic Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Senior officials of the Asia
Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) concluded here today their
two-day informal gathering after finishing preparations for the
informal APEC leadership conference scheduled for November 25 in
Subic.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the meeting told Xinhua that the senior
officials have wrapped up discussions on the Manila Action Plan
for APEC and other administrative matters.
</P>
<P>
The draft Manila Action Plan will be submitted to the APEC
ministerial meeting on November 22-23 for further discussion and
will be finally approved by APEC leaders when they meet in Subic,
80 kilometers north of Manila.
</P>
<P>
The Manila Action Plan for APEC is an integration and
summarization of the individual and collective plans for trade and
investment liberalization and facilitation, and economic and
technical cooperation among its members.
</P>
<P>
In their declaration of Common Resolve in November 1994 in
Indonesia, APEC leaders agreed that APEC members should work
toward free trade and investment in the region, with developed
members achieving the goal of free and open trade and investment
no later than 2010 and developing economies no later than 2020.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources close to the meeting, the participants
also discussed a draft declaration on an APEC framework for
strengthening economic cooperation and development, which will be
adopted by the Eighth Ministerial Meeting of APEC on November
22-23.
</P>
<P>
The senior officials also prepared a draft joint ministerial
statement to be issued at the end of the two-day ministerial
meeting, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the senior officials discussed the issue of
lifting a moratorium on the admission of new members as the
moratorium will expire at the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
However, according to informed sources, they have not reached
agreement on the membership issue and it will be referred to the
ministers for further discussion.
</P>
<P>
APEC was formed in 1989 in response to increasing calls for
closer economic cooperation through increased trade and investment
flows among the economies in the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
It groups together Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China,
Hong Kong, Indonesia, the Republic of Korea, Japan, Malaysia,
Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Chinese
Taipei, Thailand, Singapore and the United States.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian PM Proposes New Economic Reality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad today proposed that Asia and America form a joint
venture to create a single global commonwealth to make the 21st
century the century of the world.
</P>
<P>
The consequences of such a new economic reality could be
productive for all, he said while opening the Third Pacific
Dialogue here, which is a forum to discuss political and economic
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"It will be the real mechanism which will transform the whole
political, strategic and psychological make-up of the world. We
will indeed have a new world," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said a single interdependent global commonwealth was
not possible in the great age of colonialism because the world was
divided into exclusive economic blocs, each oriented towards its
center of the imperial cosmos.
</P>
<P>
"However, it is today possible for the first time in human
history," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian leader said if Asia and America could be
joint-venture partners in prospering each other, they would surely
be the catalyst for a single global commonwealth of common
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
This, he said, would surely result in a century that is "not
Asian, not American, nor European, nor even African, but a World
Century."
</P>
<P>
He said other countries could also join hands with Asia and the
United States in the joint venture to create a productive
partnership and a new world.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir reiterated that the next century was not the Asian
century but rather the century when the world takes precedence
over the narrower interests of nations and continents.
</P>
<P>
The two-day event is jointly organized by Malaysia's Institute
for Strategic and International Studies (ISIS), the Institute for
Policy Research of Malaysia and the United States' Asia Pacific
Policy Center.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim and seven U.S.
Senators are among some 50 delegates from 12 countries attending
the dialogue.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Jakarta Seeks More Infrastructure Financing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia will seek increased
financing for infrastructure sector development at the meetings of
the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in Manila this
week, according to Indonesian cabinet ministers.
</P>
<P>
Infrastructure is seen as one of the bottlenecks that slow down
the economic growth in Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
Economic experts said the APEC forum has been attaching
importance to the development of infrastructure with the private
sector serving as the effort's financial backbone.
</P>
<P>
The Asia Pacific region is estimated to require 1.5 trillion
U.S. dollars for infrastructure investment in the next 10 years.
Indonesia alone will need some 200 billion U.S. dollars and is
encouraging the private sector to serve as the main financing
source, said the experts.
</P>
<P>
"The most critical problems in infrastructure projects lie in
financing," Indonesian State Minister for National Development
Planning Ginandjar Kartasasmita told an international conference
on infrastructure here recently.
</P>
<P>
Experts at the conference said leaders of the APEC forum shared
the opinion that there is a need to accelerate the construction of
infrastructure with the help of the private sector.
</P>
<P>
APEC ministers and their business counterparts will meet in
Manila on November 23 as part of the APEC events to discuss the
private sector's funding for the region's multi-billion dollar
infrastructure needs, reports said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting aims to help increase the portion of private
funding in infrastructure from the current 10 percent to 30
percent.
</P>
<P>
According to Ginandjar, financing of infrastructure projects in
Indonesia has always posed special difficulties because of
mismatches between projects and timetables and requirements of
lenders.
</P>
<P>
Most infrastructure projects need 15 to 30 years before
investors can recover their capital while lenders normally want
quick returns, he said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's need accounts for almost 50 percent of the
estimated 435 billion U.S. dollars of the infrastructure spending
in four Southeast Asian countries -- Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia
and the Philippines -- between 1995 and 2004.
</P>
<P>
President Soeharto has said that Indonesia would need some 200
billion U.S. dollars for the development of its infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
He said Indonesia hopes that funding of its infrastructure will
continue to come from private investment, in addition to other
sources including raising funds from international financial
markets and opening doors to foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 10 years, the private sector has been
increasingly involved in financing the development of the
country's infrastructure, especially toll roads, power generation
and telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
Government officials predicted that the private sector's
contribution to infrastructure financing would reach 77 percent by
the end of the current sixth Five-Year Development Plan
(1994-1999).

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Warns Against Hiring Army Deserters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, November 21 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lanka government has
warned those who employ army deserters that they will be charged
under Emergency Regulations, Defense Ministry sources said today.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the government had earlier announced a
general amnesty to all army deserters, requesting them to return
to duty immediately. Those who fail to return within a week and
those who harbor deserters will have legal action instituted
against them.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has emphasized the provisions under Section 138 of
the Army Act which make it an offense to aid or assist in
deserting or concealing or harboring any deserter.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that employment of any deserter would
therefore be considered a serious violation of these provisions.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that 15,000 personnel had deserted from the Sri
Lankan army in the past five years, of whom about 4,200 reported
back for service before the deadline on November 15.

<HEADLINE> Germany, Bosnia Agree on Refugee Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Germany and Bosnia signed a
contract here today to start sending Bosnian refugees back to
their war-devastated country.
</P>
<P>
The transfers will be carried out as soon as possible, but the
free will of the refugees will be respected, German Interior
Minister Manfred Kanther and Bosnian Refugees and Displaced
Persons Minister Nudzeim Recica, both stressed at the signing
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
However, Kanther said: "It has always been clear that when the
war ended the refugees would have to go home and take part in the
reconstruction of their country."
</P>
<P>
Under the contract, single adults and married couples without
children will be among the first to go back. The first stage is
expected to last until next summer when other refugees have
to return home.
</P>
<P>
The contract elicited different responses from the German
public. The Minister of Foreign Affairs, Klaus Kinkel, said the
decision was good for the refugees themselves.
</P>
<P>
Josef Vosen, member of the Social Democratic Party and the
Federal Assembly, pointed out the transfers would meet with many
difficulties. The spokesman for the Democratic Socialist Party
(PDS), Ulla Jelpke, criticized the contract as inhuman.
</P>
<P>
During the Balkan war, about 440,000 refugees came to Germany
causing financial, social and housing problems in the
country. Germany's federal government and 16 states had planned to
repatriate the refugees home from last October 1, but the plan was
postponed.

<HEADLINE> East China Province Pours Huge Investment in Pollution Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, November 21 (Xinhua) -- East China's Zhejiang
Province plans to invest 33.3 billion yuan in pollution control
and ecological protection during the 1996-2000 period.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, by the year 2000, deterioration of the
province's environment will be put under control and industrial
pollution will be effectively curbed. Environment quality in some
major cities such as Hangzhou, Ningbo and Wenzhou will be markedly
improved and the province's eight river systems, lakes and sea
area will have higher quality water.
</P>
<P>
Pollution control projects will include building dust-free
areas, noise-control zones and drinking water protection zones,
and establishment of ecological villages and towns and harnessing
large and medium-sized cement plants. They also include programs
to control urban waste discharge and harness river systems.
</P>
<P>
To reach this goal, the province will work to develop
environmental protection technology and environmental protection
industries.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria to Continue Mars Probe Project with Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria will continue to
cooperate with Russia and other countries in probing the Mars
despite the failure of an earlier probe mission.
</P>
<P>
Dimitar Mishev, director of the solar-geophysics research
center of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, told a press
conference Wednesday that the failure of Russia's Mars-96 space
probe did not bring much loss to Bulgaria since the appliances it
supplied to the mission were made with funds from other countries.
</P>
<P>
The appliances included a Radio-MD system designed to study the
radiation inside and outside the space probe, an electric-wave
system to analyze the near-planet plasma, and three magnetometers
to detect the magnetic fields on the Mars' surface and at its
six-meter-depth.
</P>
<P>
The Mars-96 Probe crashed in the Pacific Ocean Saturday hours
after it was launched at a cosmodrome in Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
Russian mission controllers said the probe failed to break out
of the Earth's orbit due to a problem with the booster designed to
set it on course to Mars.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria is now working with France and Germany to design and
manufacture radioactive balance systems for a Mars probe scheduled
to be launched in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Seeks to Expand Trade with Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Mexican President Ernesto
Zedillo said here before his Asia trip that his country will
broaden trade with fellow APEC countries.
</P>
<P>
Zedillo, was to leave today for the Asian tour that includes a
summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC). He
told Xinhua that he believed the forum of the APEC would be
essential for liberating trade and investment for the world as a
whole.
</P>
<P>
Zedillo and other leaders attending the November 24-25 summit
will review progress toward their goal of creating what is
potentially the world's biggest and fastest-growing free trade
area, stretching from New York to Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The now 18-member group has agreed on a deadline of 2010 for
regional free trade among the bloc's developed nations such as
Japan and the United States, and 2020 for its developing nations.
</P>
<P>
Zedillo noted the voluntary and case-by-case trade opening of
APEC countries was what Mexico believed to be one the most
important arrangements agreed on by the trade body.
</P>
<P>
Mexico is also negotiating free trade pacts with the European
Union and the South American trade bloc Mercosur. But Zedillo
earlier said prospects for demolishing trade barriers with Pacific
Rim countries were brighter.
</P>
<P>
The Mexican president noted that despite Mexico's interest in
broadening trade with fellow APEC countries, it was not going to
neglect its trade relations with China because "the relationship
itself is valuable for Mexicans."
</P>
<P>
Zedillo will arrive in Beijing late Thursday and was to meet
President Jiang Zemin during a three-day stay that also includes a
visit to Shanghai on November 24.
</P>
<P>
Mexico was expected to sign a few diplomatic agreements with
China as well as an anti-drug cooperation accord.

<P>
OTTAWA, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Canada will send an
environmental trade mission to four South American countries later
this month to seek trade opportunities there, the government said
today.
</P>
<P>
The delegation, to be led by Minister of Environment Sergio
Marchi and with representatives from more than 25 Canadian
companies, is scheduled to visit Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina and
Chile on November 24-29.
</P>
<P>
The mission will promote Canada's advanced environmental
technologies and seek trade opportunities in water supply and
waste-water treatment, waste management and air pollution.
</P>
<P>
"Enhancing trade is central to our government's jobs and growth
agenda," Marchi said.
</P>
<P>
"The countries we will visit in South America offer the most
potential for our thriving environmental industry," he added.
</P>
<P>
At present, the environmental industry represents more than 8
billion U.S. dollars to the Canadian economy. This figure is
expected to more than double by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The environmental industry is Canada's fifth largest industry,
made up of over 4,500 small- and medium-sized companies employing
some 150,000 people.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 21 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government
plans to resettle 80,000 families in the 1997/98 fiscal year
beginning in April, up from 76,322 targeted this year, a senior
official said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The majority of these families, 52,107, will be resettled in
eastern Indonesia, Minister of Transmigration Siswono Yudohusodo
said at a coordination meeting.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's transmigration program, aimed at easing the
overcrowded population on the country's main islands of Java and
surrounding islands, dates back to the Dutch resettlement efforts
at the turn of the century and reached its height during the
1980s.
</P>
<P>
About 4.5 million people have been moved since the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
Some 60 percent of Indonesia's 196 million people live on Java,
an island which accounts for a mere seven percent of the country's
land territory.
</P>
<P>
The minister announced that in the next six years, 325,000
families will be resettled in central Kalimantan.

<HEADLINE> Kazakhstan Appeals for Protection of Aral Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Kazakhstan President
Nursultan Nazarbayev called on the international community today
to protect the environment of the Aral Sea.
</P>
<P>
The environmental disaster of the Aral Sea threatened not only
the Central Asian region but the whole world at large, Nazarbayev
told the conference of the International Fund for Saving the Aral
Sea.
</P>
<P>
The fund was set up in January, 1994, by the five Central Asian
countries -- Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and
Turkmanistan.
</P>
<P>
Nazarbayev said the international community should pay thorough
attention to the deteriorating ecological environment of the Aral
Sea, one of the world's largest inland lakes, with an area of over
64,000 square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
However, a senior official of the fund pointed out that their
work faced a lack of money. In the past four years, only
Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan had handed in all of their
shares and the fund had so far received only 13 million out of the
31 million U.S. dollars of aid from the World Bank and the United
Nations Development Program, which was granted in 1994 at the
Paris Environmental Protection Conference.
</P>
<P>
During the present conference in Alma Ata, the heads of the
five Central Asian countries decided to meet in January, 1997, in
the Kyrgyzstan's Capital Bishkek, to further discuss the Aral Sea
issue.
</P>
<P>
The Aral Sea has become one of the world's worst environmental
disasters over the past 30 years. Its surface water has decreased
by half and its salinity has increased fourfold, as 90 percent of
the water from its feeding rivers is diverted for cotton and rice
irrigation.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 21 (Xinhua) -- China is to earmark six
billion yuan (about 731 million US dollars) for a wood pulp
project in Zhanjiang in south China's Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
The project is expected to turn out 300,000 tons of wood pulp a
year when operational, China Chemical Industry News reported.
</P>
<P>
China's paper-making industry has long been dependent on straw
pulp. Its annual wood pulp output is about 2.08 million tons. This
means the country has to import large amounts of wood pulp to make
newsprint, packing paper and printing paper, which take wood pulp
as the raw materials.
</P>
<P>
To provide the necessary wood chips for the paper-making
industry, China's forestry departments have planted 1.33 million
hectares of fast-growing trees, which can provide three million
tons of wood chippings a year.
</P>
<P>
The project is being jointly launched by the Ministry of
Forestry and Guangdong Province.

MANILA, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Bombs were found Wednesday
night at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport in Manila and at
Subic Bay, where leaders of the 18 members of the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum will hold their fourth informal
conference, local newspaper Manila Standard reported.
</P>

One bomb was discovered in an unattended traveling bag outside
the arrival area of the airport while the other was found by a

Freeport, a former U.S. naval base some 80 kilometers north of
Manila, the report said.

It said that security officials defused that bomb, but
officials gave different explanations for the incident.

<P>
Subic authorities said the bomb had been placed there by the
Presidential Security Group as an exercise but an officer of the
group said he knew of no bomb drill.
</P>

Security is the Philippines' top priority in preparing the APEC
meetings in Manila and at Subic Bay. The government has mobilized

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Speaker Nomination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Republicans in the U.S.
House of Representatives Wednesday nominated Newt Gingrich for a
second term as House speaker.
</P>
<P>
Gingrich was approved unanimously at a meeting of Republicans,
who have retained a majority in both chambers of Congress in the
November 5 vote.
</P>
<P>
Republicans also re-elected Dick Armey as House majority leader
and Tom Delay as whip.
</P>
<P>
Gingrich seems certain to be reelected speaker by the full
House membership when the new Congress convenes on January 7, as
the vote is normally along straight party lines. Republicans will
have a majority of at least 20 seats in the 435-member House,
although the results of a few tight races are yet to be decided.
</P>
<P>
The only threat to Gingrich's re-election could arise if the
House Ethics Committee makes damaging charges against him in a
report expected to be issued before the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
The committee is investigating whether a tax-exempt foundation
he formerly headed was used illegally for political purposes, and
whether Gingrich had provided accurate information to the
committee about a college course he taught.
</P>
<P>
Gingrich has denied the charges on several occasions.
</P>
<P>
He promised to try to work with President Bill Clinton
and congressional Democrats.
</P>
<P>
"We have an absolute moral obligation to make this system
work," he said. "Working with President Clinton and Democrats who
agree with us, we will continue to work for a balanced budget."
</P>
<P>
If the last Congress was a "confrontation Congress," this
Congress will be an "implementation Congress," Gingrich said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, House Democrats re-elected on Monday Richard
Gephardt of Missouri their minority leader and David Bonior of
Michigan as his deputy.

<HEADLINE> Downed Russian Probe Won't Have Adverse Effect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Chile's acting Foreign
Minister, Mariano Fernandez Amunategui, said today that the fallen
Russian probe will not cause any adverse effects to his country
because it fell to a depth of about 7,000 meters into the Pacific
Ocean.
</P>
<P>
Fernandez said the Chilean embassy in Moscow demanded
information about the incident from Russia and received the answer
that no damage to the marine ecosystem was foreseen.
</P>
<P>
The Chilean people could feel tranquil. ``There is nothing to
fear,'' Fernandez said.
</P>
<P>
A part of the Russian mars-bound probe, which contained four cans
of plutonium, fell November 18 between Easter Island and the
American continent, about 3,000 kilometers east of Santiago, Chile.
</P>
<P>
Local ecologists have warned of the danger of radioactivity to
the rich fishing grounds there. Many Chilean fish stocks gather in
this place and trawlers from around the world fish there.
</P>
<P>
At present, investigations are underway and more information
would be available to the public soon, Fernandez said.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Appears..."Ready for Battle" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
today made his first public appearance since undergoing heart
by-pass surgery on November 5. He said he was ready to resume
active work.
</P>
<P>
A televised interview showed Yeltsin, wearing a fur hat and a
black coat, walking in the park of the Central Clinical Hospital
in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said that he had operation stitches removed in the
morning.
</P>
<P>
"I feel ready for battle," he said, adding that "I wouldn't say
I'm firmly on my feet, but nonetheless the doctors have done their
business."
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin was filmed for a television interview by RIA-Novosti in
the hospital park, where he was accompanied by his wife Naina,
daughter Tatyana and grand-daughter Masha.
</P>
<P>
According to the presidential press service, compared to the
first days after surgery Yeltsin felt well and would have a free
schedule.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said he realized he has to start training, increasing
"the physical and emotional load... to start full-scale
rehabilitation."
</P>
<P>
The president said his heart no longer ached, which made him
happy. "I do not feel my heart, it's not like it was before the
operation. The main thing is that the operation produced results,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said he was returning to active work. "Yesterday I
started asking (Prime Minister Viktor) Chernomyrdin to give an
account. And the same with others -- make a report on what has
been done, what is to be done, what you intend to do, how the
situation should be improved where it is difficult," he said.
</P>
<P>
Also today, Yeltsin, in a telephone conversation with Belarus
President Alexander Lukashenko, called for compromise. Lukashenko
is locked in a standoff with parliament speaker Semyon Sharetsky
over plans for a referendum to increase the president's powers.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin told the two Belarus leaders that he followed the
development of the tense situation in Belarus and received all
information about it.
</P>
<P>
He urged them to "show... wisdom, find a path to the compromise
and avert a split in Belarus society."

RIO DE JANEIRO, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Pyramids found on the

The total of 1000 pyramids were built around 3000 B.C. and may

Unlike Egyptian pyramids which are built of stone, these

Archaeologists said the pyramids were constructed over decades
or centuries, and many had been destroyed in recent years by

<HEADLINE> Compromise Urged for Settlement of Belarus Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Russian and Belarus parliament
leaders, meeting in a border city overnight, called for a
compromise to calm down the confrontation between the president
and legislature of Belarus.
</P>
<P>
Belarus parliament speaker Semyon Sharetsky and Russian
speakers of two houses of parliament, Gennady Seleznyov and Yegor
Stroyev, held an emergency meeting in the Russian city of Smolensk
overnight to look for ways to resolve the dispute between Belarus
President Alexander Lukashenko and the parliament over
constitutional amendments.
</P>
<P>
The amendments, proposed by Lukashenko and designed to enlarge
much more power of the head of state, is expected to be voted in a
nationwide referendum scheduled for November 24. The parliament,
backed by the Constitutional Court, has opposed the planned
amendments to the constitution and suggested its own
constitutional amendments.
</P>
<P>
After the behind-closed-door meeting, the three parliament
speakers stressed the need to work out "a third" constitution
draft, which they said would serve as an alternative to those of
Lukashenko and the legislature.
</P>
<P>
Lukashenko, who was also invited together with Russian Prime
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, refused to attend, saying through
his spokesman that he was too busy to come. Later, he told a
number of lawmakers that the meeting was not necessary in his view.
</P>
<P>
In other developments, the Belarus Constitutional Court decided
at its meeting overnight to open hearings on Friday on alleged
infringements by Lukashenko of the country's constitution.
</P>
<P>
If the court finds that Lukashenko did act unconstitutionally,
his presidential duties may be suspended until the parliament
decides whether he can continue to stay in his post.
</P>
<P>
At least two thirds of the 199 parliament deputies would have
to vote in favor of removing the president from office for the
motion to be adopted.
</P>
<P>
In response, Lukashenko said he he saw no grounds for
impeaching him and that the planned referendum would go ahead
despite all the protests.
</P>
<P>
At the forthcoming referendum, Belarussians will vote on two
draft constitutions, one giving extensive powers to Lukashenko and
the other scrapping the institution of presidency in the former
Soviet republic.

<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, November 21 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank is going to
provide over 400 million U.S. dollars in loans for a project to
divert Yellow River water to Shanxi Province, starting next year.
</P>
<P>
Power generating units will be built in Wanjiazhai Village,
Pianguan County, to divert water from the Yellow River to Taiyuan,
the provincial capital in the south, and to Shuozhou and Datong,
two industrial cities in northern Shanxi.
</P>
<P>
The project will consist of two phases. In the first, water
will be channeled from the Yellow River, which runs from north to
south in the western part of Shanxi, to Taiyuan. It is expected to
be finished in 2001. Work began on the project in 1993. It is
expected to cost 11.3 billion yuan (1.36 billion U.S. dollars),
with the WB putting up 400 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
A special delegation led by Mr. Daniel Gunaratnam of the WB
visited Shanxi in October and November to do a 21-day formal
evaluation of the project. The bank had previously sent many
experts to the northern Chinese province.
</P>
<P>
Gunaratnam called the past two-and a-half years of cooperation
between the WB and Shanxi "fruitful", and Joseph Goldberg, a
high-ranking official with WB, also spoke highly of the
cooperation, after having made an on-the-spot inspection.

BRUSSELS, November 20 (Xinhua) -- A green paper adopted by the
European Commission (EC) today opened a wide-ranging public debate
on the future of the European Union's relations with 70 African,
Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) developing countries.
</P>
<P>
The paper, which outlines the challenges and options for a new
partnership, is "first and foremost an invitation to take part in
a frank and unprejudiced discussion," according to EC Commissioner
Joao de Deus Pinheiro, who presented the paper. He said, "We must
find the courage to reconsider everything. Everything but our
political commitment and support for the ACP countries."
</P>
<P>
With the Lome Convention scheduled to end in February 2000 and
negotiations with the ACP countries to start in autumn 1998, the
EC believes it is time for a broad debate involving the national
authorities, business and academic circles and the public at large
on the changes to be made to EU-ACP relations in the run-up to the
21st century.
</P>
<P>
The EC addresses in the paper the geographical scope of the
partnership, trade arrangements to be offered to the ACP countries
and the measures needed to develop the private sector, increase
competitiveness and strengthen the rule of law.

been increased to 67 million ECUs (about 87 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Subsidies for social measures connected with restructuring of
the coal industry have been increased to 24 million ECUs (some 31
million dollars), it was learned Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The ECSC is expected to expire at the conclusion of its 50 year

<HEADLINE> U.S. Aircraft shot at by Rebel fires over Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Zairian rebels shot at an
unarmed U.S. Navy aircraft when it was patrolling over eastern
Zaire to track refugees' movement on Wednesday, but was not
damaged, the Pentagon said.
</P>
<P>
A Pentagon statement said the Navy P-3 Orion reconnaissance
aircraft was on its routine mission south of Goma, Zaire, now
under rebels' control, when its crew of 11 saw eight bursts of what
appeared to be anti-aircraft rounds exploding about two miles from
the plane. But the plane was flying "well above" the range of
anti-aircraft, and the shots exploded several thousand feet below
the plane, Navy Dmdr. Joe march, a Defense Department spokesman,
said.
</P>
<P>
"Crew members reported seeing approximatedly eight bursts, which
appeared to be anti-aircraft rounds and not small arms fire. The
type of weapon used on the ground is undetermined," March said.
"After the incident, the aircraft departed the area and
continued on its mission."
</P>
<P>
The unarmed P-3 continued its mission before returning to a
base in Entebbe, Uganda. The U.S. military has based two of the
four-engine turboprop planes at Entebbe airport and is using the
Orions, designed to hunt submarines, to search for thousands of
refugees displaced from camps in Zaire because of fighting between
ethnic factions.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. planes have been flying missions over the region for
about a week in an effort to provide humanitarian groups with
information about the whereabouts of thousands of Hutu refugees.
</P>
<P>
More than half a million refugees are believed to have
returned to their homelands, but U.N. officials said the
American reconnaissance aircraft have located 500,000 to 600,000
in the region.
</P>
<P>
The United States cut the number of 1,000 spearhead troops to
about 800 on Tuesday and said to deploy them outside, rather
than inside Zaire as had been planned.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary William Perry said on Tuesday that the
return of some 500,000 refugees from Zaire to Rwanda had changed
the situation and fewer than 1,000 U.S. logistical personnel
were now needed for a military operation in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
Under the new plan about 200 U.S. Air Force personnel will be
sent to Kigali airport in Rwanda, 500 to Entebbe and 100 to
Mombasa in Kenya to prepare for the air relief mission.
</P>
<P>
The pentagon stressed that President Bill Clinton, while
agreeing to U.S. participation in principle, had still not given
final approval for the actual mission, which could change in
response to circumstances on the ground.

SARAJEVO, November 20 (Xinhua) - U.S. Assistant Defense
Secretary James Pardew has recommanded his government to unblock
the weapon delivery for the Muslim-Croat federation army, the U.S.
embassy here said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Pardew, who is in charge of the U.S.-sponsored "Train and
Equip" program to improve the federation army, made his decision
after the federation made the personnel change at the federal
defense ministry as required by Washington.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. demanded for removal of Hasan Cengic, the Muslim
deputy minister of defense, because of his alleged connections
with Iran, but Bosnian Muslims insisted on dual removal of both
Gengic and Vladimir Soljic, the Croat defense minister.
</P>
<P>
To put pressure on the Muslim side, the U.S. government
postponed the unloading of some 100 million dollar worth of heavy
weaponry from a chartered ship "American Condor", which had been
in the Adriatic sea for weeks.
</P>
<P>
Soljic submitted his resignation last Friday, while the Muslim
side announced Cengic's removal early this week.
</P>
<P>
According to local reports, "American Condor" is scheduled to
dock at the Croatian port of Ploce for unloading the weapons on
Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Find Way to Boost Rice Crop Yield </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Scientists have discovered
genes in wild rice species that may help boost production of some
of the world's major agriculture crops, Cornell University
announced today.
</P>
<P>
"Fertilization is no longer an effective way to boost yield,
it's plateaued," said Susan McCouch, Cornell assistant professor
and a chief researcher of the team. "So, instead of boosting land
mass, which we can't do, we're manipulating the plant's genetics."
</P>
<P>
According to Cornell scientists, the same types of rice have
been cultivated over and over again, effectively reducing rice's
natural diversity. Using genes from the wild rice means the crop's
natural diversity are reintroduced.
</P>
<P>
While examining wild rice, McCouch and her colleagues have been
systematically mapping genes of rice varieties and looking for the
specific Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) genes that would tend to
boost production.
</P>
<P>
Through gene mapping activities, scientists deduced that the
wild rice O. Rufipogon contained two production-boosting QTls. By
recombining the QTLs with a domesticated rice, they obtained
between a 15 percent to 17 percent improvement in production.
</P>
<P>
The Cornell scientists collaborated with China's Hunan Hybrid
Rice Institute and provided the Chinese agricultural field station
with recombined and intrograssed rice, the university said.

<HEADLINE> Egypt, AL Regret U.S. Veto on 2nd Term for Ghali </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Egypt and the Arab League (AL)
today expressed disappointment over the U.S. veto on re-election
of incumbent U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros Ghali for a
second term.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has voiced its hope the U.S. would reconsider its
rejection of Ghali's candidacy as the U.N. chief for a second
term, in the light of the overwhelming support inside the
U.N. Security Council when a vote was taken Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Ambassador Sayyed Qassem al-Masri, assistant foreign
minister for multi-national relations, said 14 out of the 15 member
states in the Security Council have voted for Ghali.
</P>
<P>
However, he regretted that the U.S. stood alone against France,
Britain, Russia, China, Botswana, Chile, Egypt, Germany, Guinea
Bissau, Honduras, Indonesia, Italy, South Korea and Italy, in
opposing Ghali's renomination.
</P>
<P>
Reflecting on the fact that Ghali obtained 11 votes for his
first candidacy, Masri cited the almost unanimous yes vote as a
credit to Egyptian diplomacy and an affirmation of confidence in
Ghali.
</P>
<P>
"The countries which had hesitated in giving him their
vote in his first term have recognized his good performance during
the past five years," he added.
</P>
<P>
In press statements today, AL Secretary General Esmat Abdel
Meguid said the U.S stance will not serve American interests with
Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
The AL has adopted a stance from the very beginning in support
of Ghali's re-election, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that he is pleased with world response and the stance
of the U.N. Security Council, where 14 states voted in favor of
Ghali.
</P>
<P>
The vote, at the request of the U.S., was conducted by secret
ballot on a resolution sponsored by 10 of the 15 Security Council
members. It would have put Ghali, a 74-year-old Egyptian, in
office for another five years until 2001.

<P>
BRUSSELS, November 20 (Xinhua) -- There is no evidence of any
health risk emerging from mobile phones, but the results of
present research are inadequate to draw firm conclusions on the
issue, a recently-drafted report says.
</P>
<P>
The report, which was presented Wednesday to the European
Commission (EC), was drafted by an expert group which was asked by
the EC to prepare an action plan for comprehensive research into
the effects of radio frequency radiation on human health.
</P>
<P>
The EC intends to decide before the end of this year on how the
proposed action plan can be integrated in the European research
and development programs.
</P>

<HEADLINE> AL Chief: Agreement with APU Aims to Foster Common </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 20 (Xinhua) -- The cooperation accord between
the Arab League (AL) and the Arab Parliamentary Union (APU) is
meant to bolster joint action and readjust relations between the
two organizations to the fast-paced challenges facing the Arab
world, AL Secretary General Abdel Meguid said here today.
</P>
<P>
Meguid made the remarks here on the occasion of signing the
cooperation agreement with Galal al Saeed, Chairman of the APU and
the speaker of the Moroccan Chamber of Deputies.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, expected to help expand the scope of
consultation and coordination between the two sides, was forged
upon a proposal by Fathi Surour, chairman of the
Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) during the 27th session of the APU
in Damascus. The idea had won the support of all Arab parliaments.
</P>
<P>
Surour lauded the agreement, saying that it is a leap towards
establishing joint Arab action and implementing the June Arab
Summit resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Surour, also speaker of the Egyptian People's Assembly, said
that the APU has exerted studious efforts over the past couple of
years to back up Arab solidarity, he added.
</P>
<P>
The agreement provides for expansive cooperation on political,
legislative, social and cultural domains to serve higher Arab
interests.
</P>
<P>
The two sides will also coordinate their foreign activities and
exchange data and documents as well as resolutions of mutual
interest.
</P>
<P>
The two sides will hold annual meetings to explore views over
programs for joint action and each side will have a representative
in the other.

<HEADLINE> UN Chief Only One Coordinator in Cyprus Problem: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Russian ambassador to Cyprus
Boris Zenkov today questioned the validity of current U.S. and
British moves to push the Cyprus peace process forward and said
that all these different coordinators create only confusion in
solving the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador, who will leave his Cyprus posting soon after
six years' service on the island, made the remarks tonight in an
interview with a private church-owned Cypriot TV network, "Logos."
</P>
<P>
He said, "There is only one coordinator, the
U.N. secretary-general who has to act in accordance with the
U.N. and the Security Council resolutions."
</P>
<P>
Zenkov even suggested that the U.S. had essentially replaced,
in a way, the U.N. chief. He expressed disappointment in seeing
Ghali's role being undertaken by others.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the Cyprus issue, the Russian diplomat believed
that the issue of security is the key to a Cyprus solution and
it must cover a whole spectrum of security aspects, including
political, military, economic and individual.
</P>
<P>
All these, he said, should be discussed between the Cyprus
Republic and Turkey, and not the Greek and Turkish Cypriot
communities.
</P>
<P>
He also suggested the U.N. and Europe provide the necessary
guarantees once an initial agreement on security matters is
clinched.
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging the current deadlock, Zenkov called on the
local political parties to try and present a united front as far
as a Cyprus settlement is concerned.
</P>
<P>
"Russia is and shall continue to stand by Cyprus and will
support a just and viable solution in Cyprus," the ambassador
pledged.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkey sent troops to
take control of the northern third of the island following an
Athens-backed coup.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus problem has remained unsolved despite the U.N. and
international community's peace efforts for the past 22 years.

BEIRUT, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Speaker of the Lebanese House of
Representatives Nabih Berri today called for the widest possible
parliamentary and diplomatic drive by the Francophone countries
across the world to curb the defiant Israeli military and
settlement policies.
</P>
<P>
Berri made this call at the opening of the second session of
the Political and Administrative Bureau of the General and Popular
Society of World Francophone Parliamentarians.
</P>
<P>
Berri accused the Israeli government of pushing the Middle East
to the brink of war and of mobilizing its forces along the
northern front opposite Syria and Lebanon. He pointed out that
Israel is trying to go back to square one in Israeli-Arab
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
He underscored that Israel have time and again committed
large-scale aggressions against Lebanon -- at the rate of one
every three years -- because it wants Lebanon seeking peace as a
war invalid rather than a healthy country.
</P>
<P>
He added that Lebanon was locked in a race against time to
modernize the state establishments and the services system,
indicating that the rebuilding, vitalizing and energizing the
State was a Lebanese responsibility.
</P>
<P>
The session is attended by representatives of Francophone
countries, including Benin, Congo, Canada, Belgium, Central
Africa, France, Switzerland, Luxembourg, Mali, Vietnam and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day session, the participants are expected to
discuss the innovation of the Francophone structure to facilitate
better cooperation and solidarity in the political and cultural
domains.

<P>
CAIRO, November 20 (Xinhua) -- The following are business
briefs from Middle East countries:
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- The Japanese government was considering a Jordanian
request for a loan of about 76 million U.S. dollars to the
kingdom's tourism sector, according to today's local daily Jordan
Times.
</P>
<P>
The loan would be spent on tourism infrastructure as well as
setting up new tourist sites and upgrading existing ones as part
of Jordan's master plan to develop the tourist sector, the first
to benefit from the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Jordan also requested a 60 million dollar loan from
Japan for its human resources development projects which would be
spent on building new schools.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the two batches of loans would be approved
by the Japanese government early next year.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- In the face of ten years of losses on its Israel
run, Air France still considers Tel Aviv a priority destination
and intends to invest in it in the future, today's Jerusalem Post
reported.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Jean-Pierre Tabarly, Air France's Israel
manager, as saying that the average annual loss on the Paris-Tel
Aviv run was about 8 million U.S. dollars, but he added that by
next year he hoped at least the run would be break even.
</P>
<P>
To do so, Tabarly said, the airline would not necessarily
have to attract more passengers, but increase the number of
business-class passengers.
</P>
<P>
He also revealed that the state-owned Air France is due to be
privatized by the end of next year, saying that the airline
already dismissed some 10,000 workers in cuts that are intended
to make the privatized company more attractive to investors.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt signed 4.86 billion U.S. dollars in big
contracts during the third Middle East and North Africa Economic
Conference, said Minister of Information Safwat el-Sherif today.
</P>
<P>
The information minister said that the first of these projects
was signed by the General Egyptian Petroleum Corporation, the
Turkish Botas company and the world heavy-weight oil company
AMOCO of the U.S..
</P>
<P>
The giant project, with a total cost of 4 billion dollars, is
geared to exporting 10 billion cubic meters of liquefied natural
gas to Turkey every year, he said.
</P>
<P>
The second is a 110 million-dollar project with the American
Philips company for the production of polyethylene at an annual
output of 150,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Kuwait also signed agreements on projects, which
include production of azote fertilizers at a cost of 360 million
dollars, urea fertilizers at 224 million dollars and compound
phosphatic fertilizers at 165 million dollars, he said.
</P>
<P>
The information minister said that investment in other
projects is still under negotiation with local and foreign
investors, which will involve 6.8 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The economic conference was held in Cairo on November

</P>
<P>
In a statement issued today, the federation said the verdicts

The federation called upon all the organizations concerned
with human rights issues to bring pressure to bear on the
international community to interfere.

It also urged the U.N. ad hoc committees to issue resolutions
denouncing such practices and called upon Israel to halt such
violations against the Palestinian people.

Last week, Israel's Supreme Court overruled appeals against
the "intensive interrogation" of two members of the militant
group Islamic Jihad, who reportedly have been tortured in Israeli
prison.

After a series of deadly bombings in recent years, the late
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin gave the police freer rein to use
shaking and other tough measures when interrogating Palestinians
suspected of "plotting terrorist attacks."
</P>
<P>
More than 20 Palestinians have died in Israeli prisons since
1987, most recently Abdel Samad Harizat, who died in April 1995
after being violently shaken by interrogators.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Aircraft Shot at over Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 20 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. Air Force aircraft
was shot at while patrolling over eastern Zaire to track refugees'
movement, the Pentagon said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Plane, P-3 Orion, was on its routine mission south of Goma,
Zaire, when its crew saw what appeared to be bursts of
anti-aircraft fire exploding about two miles from the plane, a
spokesman said. But the plane was flying "well above" the range of
anti-aircraft, and the shots exploded several thousand feet below
the plane.
</P>
<P>
The unarmed P-3 continued its mission before returning to a
base in Entebbe, Uganda, said the spokesman, who would not
speculate on who might have fired at the plane.
</P>
<P>
U.S. planes have been flying missions over the region for about
a week in an effort to provide humanitarian groups with
information about the movement of thousands of Hutu refugees who
had fled ethnic fighting in eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
More than half a million refugees are believed to have returned
to their homelands, but U.N. officials said the American
reconnaissance aircraft have located 500,000 to 600,000 in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Washington is expected to contribute 800 military personnel to
a Canadian-led multinational force for a relief mission, scaled
back from the number of 1,000 it announced to dispatch into Zaire
early this week.

<HEADLINE> Telescope Released by Columbia Has Alignment Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Scientists struggled
Wednesday to correct alignment problems with a NASA-German
ultraviolet telescope released by Space shuttle Columbia Tuesday
night for two weeks of astronomy observations.
</P>
<P>
Scientists discovered the problems when they aimed the
telescope at the brightest ultraviolet object in the sky other
than the sun, a star in the Constellation Puppis 1,000 to 1,500
light-years away. The star wasn't where it was supposed to be.
</P>
<P>
The vibration of Tuesday afternoon's launch might cause the
problems, according to NASA.
</P>
<P>
Once scientists determine the degree of misalignment, they can
send corrective computer commands and may resolve the problems by
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Columbia's five astronauts deployed the telescope on the
resuable Shuttle Pallet Satellite at 11:11 p.m. EST Tuesday, about
eight hours after the shuttle blasted off, NASA said. Three hours
later, ground controllers observed the telescope door opening and
noted that the instrument appeared to be working properly, but
then they found the problems.
</P>
<P>
The telescope is planned to fly free of Columbia for two weeks,
making up to 300 observations of newborn and dying stars,
interstellar gas, the atmosphere of the moon, and the northern and
southern lights of Jupiter.
</P>
<P>
U.S. and German space agencies and universities have spent 93
million US dollars on the project.
