<HEADLINE> China Sweeps Three Golds at FINA Grand Prix </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese divers made a
clean sweep of three gold medals at the 1998 FINA Diving Grand
Prix, by winning two more titles from the women's 10-meter
platform and the men's 3-meter springboard here Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
Cai Yuyan, the 16-year-old from Guangdong province who finished
second at the World Swimming Championship last January, kept her
form through the preliminaries to collect a total of 521.55 points
to clinch the women's 10m platform title under cheers from the
enthusiastic home crowd.
</P>
<P>
Her teammate Wang Yan finished second with 477.90, beating
Vyninka Arlow of Australia to third place with 475.65.
</P>
<P>
The 20-year-old Xu Hao snatched the men's 3-meter springboard
title with 690.85 points, edging veteran Yu Zhuocheng to second
with 660.95.
</P>
<P>
Yu, winner of the 1-meter springboard and synchronized diving
at the World Swimming Championships, scored the event-high 91
points in his third dive.
</P>
<P>
Robert Newbery of Australia bagged home the bronze with 593.95.
</P>
<P>
Hu Enyong, coach of Cai Yuyan and Yu Zhuocheng, expressed his
satisfaction with the performances of his disciples, saying "both
Cai and Yu performed higher degrees of difficulty."
</P>
<P>
"However, Cai still has a lot to improve her technical skills
to ensure stable performances while Yu also lacks of systematic
training after the World Championships which explained his errors
in some dives tonight," the coach said.
</P>
<P>
The victory of Xu Hao was a reward of his supurb stability,
great sense of water and excellent techniques, although he still
has to improve his difficulty degree of the dives, his coach
commented.
</P>
<P>
Early this afternoon, Zhu Zhijia of China took the first gold
of the Grand Prix series in the women's 1-meter springboard.

<HEADLINE> More Births Than Deaths in EU in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 23 (Xinhua) -- More babies were born and
fewer people died in the European Union in 1997, contributing to a
population growth of 0.1 percent, Eurostat reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The EU's statistical agency said that births rose to 4,061,500
from 4,045,800 in 1996 while in 1995 they reached a post-war low
of 4,001,800.
</P>
<P>
Deaths are estimated to have fallen from 3,732,700 in 1996 to
3,721,400 last year.
</P>
<P>
Eurostat concluded that the difference in births and deaths
resulted in a probable rise in EU natural population of 340,100 or
0.1 percent growth in total population.
</P>
<P>
The 1996 rise was 313,100.
</P>
<P>
But Eurostat predicted that after the year 2000 there would be
another decrease in births as the large number of women born in
the mid-1960s "baby-boom" move out of the peak childbearing ages
and are replaced by the smaller number of women born between 1965
and 1975.
</P>
<P>
Despite the EU-wide increase of births, half of the European
Union member states saw a decline in births in 1997 compared with
1996.
</P>
<P>
Austria, Sweden, Greece, Finland, Luxembourg, France, Belgium
and Spain all registered decreases in populations with birth rates
dropping by 5.2 percent, 4.4 percent, 3.3 percent, 2 percent, 1.6
percent, 1.2 percent, 0.4 percent and 0.2 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
Ireland led the increase of births with 7.4 percent, followed by
Austria at 5.2 percent.

</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Senior Clinton Administration officials, cautioning that
deeds and not words are required to resolve the crisis with Iraq,
said Sunday that they would withhold judgement on the agreement
announced in Baghdad by the United Nations Secretary General, Kofi
Annan, until he returns to give them a detailed briefing.
</P>
<P>
-- Tobacco industry documents, some released recently, strongly
suggest that the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company altered nicotine

competitive.

<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Against a backdrop of threatened U.S. airstrike, U.N.
Secretary General Kofi Annan Sunday night reached an agreement
with senior Baghdad officials that he believes could end the
crisis over U.N. inspections of suspected Iraqi weapons sites, his
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
-- For years, the streets of Washington have been a moonscape
of potholes. But now all 4,000 of them are supposed to be patched
by summer's end, and steamrollers are laying down miles of fresh
asphalt.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- Affirmative-action programs face new challenges in
Washington state, where a ban on racial or gender preferences will

</P>
<P>
USA Today:
</P>
<P>
-- The government's case against two men accused of possessing
the deadly toxin seems to be weakening. But prosecutors and the

<HEADLINE> Iran Says No Problem to Repay Foreign Debts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Governor of the Central Bank of
Iran (CBI) Mohsen Nourbakhsh announced Monday that Iran would not
face any problem to repay its foreign commitments despite of a
reduction of its oil revenue.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here, Nourbakhsh said that Iran
would repay all of its commitments on time and without any delay.
</P>
<P>
He put the country's total foreign commitments at 26.4 billion
U.S. dollars, including 14.1 billion dollars foreign debts.
</P>
<P>
He rejected the reports that Iran might face another economic
crisis like that during 1993-1995 when it was forced to reschedule
its foreign arrears.
</P>
<P>
Economic experts have predicted a financial problem for the
country after its oil incomes sharply reduced following the fall
of oil prices during the past year. Some said that Tehran would
be forced to reschedule the payment of its foreign debts again.
</P>
<P>
Nourbakhsh said that the country's oil revenue during the 11
months of the current Iranian fiscal year (to end on March 21)
stood at 14.3 billion dollars with the average price at 15.7
dollars per barrel.
</P>
<P>
Iran earned 18.5 billion dollars in 1996 when oil price was as
high as 19 dollars per barrel and it expected 17.7 billion
dollars oil revenues in the current Iranian year based on an
average price of 17.5 dollars per barrel.
</P>
<P>
Prices for Iranian oil dropped from 19 dollars per barrel in
1996 to around 13 dollars at present.
</P>
<P>
The reduction of oil revenue has caused the country to face a
budget deficit of 6,000 billion rials (about 3.4 billion dollars)
Nourbakhsh said, adding that the CBI has started to sell bonds to
make up the budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
He agreed that the country would also face budget deficit in
the coming fiscal year if oil price remains at present level and
the government would be forced to make some revision to the
budget.
</P>
<P>
Nourbakhsh said Iran enjoyed a 3 percent growth rate for gross
domestic products (GDP) in the current Iranian year while the
figure was 4.2 percent last Iranian year.
</P>
<P>
He said that the country could keep the GDP growth rate at
3 percent in the coming Iranian year despite of the present
stagnation in oil market, adding that the country's industrial
sector had a drastic growth during the past years and its growth
rate stood at 6 percent in the current year.

WASHINGTON, February 23 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton
Monday did not as had been expected make any comment on U.N.
Secretary General Kofi Annan's agreement with Iraqi officials over
weapons inspection.
</P>
<P>
He only said at a gathering of state governors at the White
House that he had spoken to Annan and British Prime Minister Tony
Blair about the agreement.
</P>
<P>
"I've been working on the situation in Iraq.... Last night just
before dinner I spoke with Secretary General Kofi Annan and I have
called Prime Minister Blair this morning. We had a long talk about
the situation."
</P>
<P>
He said he would speak to French President Jacques Chirac and
Russian President Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
"That's all I have to say now," he concluded.
</P>
<P>
The United States wants an agreement which gives the U.N.
weapons inspectors free access to all the sites they want to
visit, without the time limits Iraq has tried to impose.

<HEADLINE> IMF Approves Stand-By Credit for Cape Verde </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) Monday approved a 14-month stand-by credit for Cape
Verde equivalent to some 2.8 million U.S. dollars to back the
government's 1998 economic program.
</P>
<P>
However, the Cape Verde authorities have indicated their
intention not to draw on the credit.
</P>
<P>
The macroeconomic program is designed to reach real GDP growth
of 4 percent in 1998, as compared with 3 percent in 1997, and an
average inflation rate of 3.5 percent in 1998, as against 8.9
percent last year. The external current account balance, excluding
transfers, is targeted at a deficit of 15.7 percent of GDP in 1998
as compared with a deficit of 16.4 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The most important content of the program is a tightening of
fiscal policy to reduce the overall fiscal deficit to 8.7 percent
of GDP in 1998 from 15.1 percent in 1997. The deficit is to be
entirely financed by concessional foreign borrowing.
</P>
<P>
Cape Verde joined the IMF in November 1978. Its quota is about
9.4 million dollars equivalent. The country has no outstanding use
of IMF financing so far.

<HEADLINE> Pak PM Expresses Satisfaction with UN-Iraq Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif has expressed satisfaction with the just-concluded
accord between the U.N. and the Iraqi government pertaining to the
standoff on the issue of weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
In a letter addressed to U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan,
Sharif expressed the hope that with this agreement the prospect of
military action would completely be averted.
</P>
<P>
According to the Associated Press of Pakistan, Sharif said in
his letter that "if approved by the (U.N.) Security Council this
agreement would represent the success of diplomacy rather than the
use of force."
</P>
<P>
Sharif observed that a key element in the accord is "ensuring
respect of Security Council resolutions governing the inspection
regime in Iraq."
</P>
<P>
Referring to his letter of February 21 to the U.N. secretary
general, Sharif stressed that "this demonstrates the importance of
implementing all Security Council resolutions in letter and spirit
whether they pertain to Iraq, Kashmir, Lebanon, Palestine or any
other issue for maintaining global and regional peace and
security."
</P>
<P>
The prime minister has also welcomed the Security Council's
decision of February 20 to increase the oil-for-food program for
Iraq under which it would be able to sell 5.2 billion U.S.
dollars worth of oil every six months.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that this will contribute to alleviating
the sufferings of the Iraqi people.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Supreme Court Rejects Challenge to Sex Offender </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Supreme Court
Monday turned down a constitutional challenge to a New Jersey law
requiring authorities to tell communities the whereabouts of
convicted sex offenders, leaving intact the notification
provisions of Megan's Law.
</P>
<P>
Megan's Law, enacted by New Jersey in 1995, has been adopted by
36 other states since.
</P>
<P>
The Law is named for Megan Kanka, a seven-year-old girl who was
raped and murdered in 1994 by a twice-convicted sex offender who
lived across the street from her home. The criminal has been
sentenced to death for the crime.
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for sex offenders had argued that the disputed
provisions violate the Fifth Amendment's protection against being
punished twice for the same crime because such notice, and the
public reaction it generates, amounts to punishment.
</P>
<P>
The action was not a ruling and did not preclude the
possibility the court might some day fully review and disapprove
of such a notification measure. But survival of the prototype law
against the first constitutional challenge to reach the Supreme
Court is a huge legal victory for proponents of such measures.
</P>
<P>
The New Jersey law calls for notice to schools, day-care
centers and youth groups about moderate-risk offenders. For
high-risk offenders, the law requires police to go door-to-door
notifying neighborhood residents.
</P>
<P>
The law also requires sex offenders who have been paroled or
released after completing their prison sentences to register with
local authorities when moving to a community. That requirement,
now the law in all 50 states, was not challenged.

<HEADLINE> Epidemic Diseases Under Control in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Health Minister
Jackson Kalweo Monday said that Rift Valley fever in the
Northeastern province had been "successfully contained" and
cholera and malaria were also "on the decline" in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Rift Valley fever first emerged in the province two months
ago and the Kenyan Health Ministry issued an alert earlier this
month to Nairobi residents over possible outbreak of the fever in
the capital as the killer disease had been making a steady spread
westward.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held here Monday, the minister assured
Kenyans that the fast killing fever had been brought under
control.
</P>
<P>
He said that a total of 846 Kenyans died of cholera since last
June, adding that it is, therefore, imperative that public health
education on hygiene should be continued to avert possible
recurrence of cholera.
</P>
<P>
In the case of malaria, the minister said, the worst affected
districts in the east African country include Kisii, Nyamira,
Kericho, West Pokot, Samburu, Uasin Gishu, Kakamega, Nandi, Trans
Nzola, Wajir, Garissa, Mandera and Trans Mara.
</P>
<P>
Kalweo pointed out that a team of experts was sent to the
worst hit areas to assess the situation and a task force had been
set up to deal with the malaria menace since the disease was
expected to persist until July in the wake of the onset of the
long rains in March.
</P>
<P>
Malaria epidemic usually occurs during the months of May-July
after the long rains. However, the disease occurred earlier than
expected due to the unusual prolonged rains caused by the El Nino
weather phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan Health Ministry has launched a social mobilization
campaign, recommending immediate clearing of bushes around houses
and draining of stagnant water in pools all over the country to
eradicate all possible mosquito breeding sites.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Environmentalists have
urged the Morogoro municipality in southern Tanzania to curb
massive felling of trees on the Uluguru Mountains, Daily News
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Environmental experts and representatives who have been
attending a seminar on biogas technology in Morogoro, said wanton
destruction of forests on the mountains threaten to deplete the
water source for the Ruvu River, a lifeline for Dar es Salaam and
adjacent areas.
</P>
<P>
More than 30 participants from local non-government
organizations (NGOs) called on the municipal authorities to work
out the strategies to protect the ecosystem of the mountain with
the Sokoine University of Agriculture, for the benefit of future
generations.
</P>
<P>
The seminar was organized by a local NGO in Morogoro, the
Foundation for Sustainable Rural Development (SURUDE) and was
sponsored by the Africa 2000 Network, a UNDP-financed program.
</P>
<P>
Heavy use of wood for fuel, overgrazing and fires have made
the country lose 300,000 and 400,000 hectares of forests each
year.
</P>
<P>
The workshop has called on Africa 2000 Network in
collaboration with SURUDE to promote the technology of using
tubular plastic biodigesters.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Exerts Efforts to Avert Strike on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, February 23 (Xinhua) -- A senior Jordanian official said
Monday that Jordan had exerted efforts to help prevent a U.S.
military strike against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with official Jordan Television Station, Deputy
Prime Minister for Development and Minister of Foreign Affairs
Jawad Anani said that Jordan's endeavors were made at a time when
opportunities of averting a military strike seemed "extremely
slight."
</P>
<P>
"Jordan's strategy and foreign policy in dealing with the
crisis focused on one goal which is to avert a military strike on
Iraq," he said.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to avoid the possible U.S. military actions against
Iraq, Jordanian officials held talks with Iraqi Foreign Minister
Mohammed Saeed Al-Sahhaf to discuss the Iraq-U.N. crisis over arms
inspection, he said.
</P>
<P>
Jordan also held consultations and contacts with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak and Arab League Secretary General Esmat
Abdel-Meguid in this regard, Anani added.
</P>
<P>
United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan Monday made a
telephone call to King Hussein of Jordan to commend Jordan's role
in averting U.S. military strike on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Annan expressed U.N.'s appreciation for Jordan's "clear and
active stand" which contributed to defusing the crisis and
averting a military option.
</P>
<P>
During the crisis triggered by Iraq's refusal to allow
U.N. arms inspectors to full access to Iraq's sites suspected of
hiding banned weapons, Jordan had exerted efforts at national,
bilateral, regional and international levels to help prevent the
United States from staging military strike on Iraq to force it to
fully comply with U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The Untied States has threatened to resort to force if
diplomacy fails to solve the confrontation with Iraq
peacefully.

LONDON, February 23 (Xinhua) -- A car bomb exploded in the
center of Portadown in Northern Ireland Monday after several
warning calls, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Army bomb experts were investigating the area, which was
evacuated before the blast occurred. There were no casualties.
</P>
<P>
The explosion came as the peace talks resumed in Belfast Monday
without Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish Republican Army
(IRA), which was expelled last Friday for the IRA's alleged
involvement in two murders early this month.
</P>
<P>
Kenneth Twyble, mayor of Portadown, said people were "shocked
and stunned" by the attack, which damaged more than 12 buildings
in a narrow street.
</P>
<P>
Those responsible for the blast "do not want peace" in Northern
Ireland, he added.
</P>
<P>
Police said the bomb, planted in a car parked 200 meters from a
police station, caused extensive damage to banks and other
businesses in this town about 45 km southwest of Belfast.
</P>
<P>
No group has claimed responsibility for the attack.
</P>
<P>
Two bombs were planted in Northern Ireland at the weekend. One
wrecked a police station and wounded 11 people in the town of
Moira, while the other under a taxi in Belfast was destroyed by
police in a controlled explosion.

<HEADLINE> Lesotho Ruling Party Has No Power Struggle: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The ruling Lesotho
Congress for Democracy (LDC) on Monday denied that there was a
power struggle between the party's two most senior leaders.
</P>
<P>
However, it confirmed there was a debate about the separation
of party ledership and premiership of the country.
</P>
<P>
South African Press Association (SAPA) quoted unidentified
Lesotho officials as reporting that the tussle is between newly
elected LCD leader Pakalitha Mosisili and his deputy Kelebone
Maope.
</P>
<P>
Mosisili is Lesotho's current deputy prime minister while
Maope is foreign minister. They were elected to their new party
positions at a special congress on Saturday following Prime
Minister Ntsu Mokhehle's recent resignation from the LCD
leadership due to poor health and old-age.
</P>
<P>
Mokhehle also announced that he would not be available for
re-election as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Mosisili had been Mokhehle's deputy since they broke away from
the former ruling Basutoland Congress Party and formed the LCD in
June last year.
</P>
<P>
Reports of simmering tension between Mosisili and Maope
emerged during the weekend congress, and this resulted in a
deadlock over who should succeed 79-year-old Mokhehle.
</P>
<P>
A compromise was later reached and Mosisili won, but the
question of the separation of the roles arose.
</P>
<P>
One group wants Maope to be nominated for the premiership of
the country after the May 23 general elections, while another
supports Mosisili's nomination for the post.
</P>
<P>
The pro-Maope group was reportedly arguing that Lesotho is
presently in a transitional phase and they believe there is need
to search for the right person to perform the various political
roles within the party and government.
</P>
<P>
SAPA quoted a source close to Maope as saying that the foreign
minister was not interested in contesting the premiership, but
would consider any deployment by the party.
</P>
<P>
Tom Thabane, Mokhehle's special advisor and senior LCD member,
said the LCD was democratic, and the party members determine
their leaders' roles.

<HEADLINE> Greece: No U.S. Proposal for Non-Aggression Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Greece denied Monday that there
was a definite proposal by the U.S. for the signing of a
non-aggression agreement between Greece and neighboring Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Replying to questions concerning a reported initiative by U.S.
special envoy to Cyprus Richard Holbrooke, Greek government
spokesman Dimitris Reppas told reporters that there was no
specific formula with an explicit content regarding the signing of
a non-aggression accord between the two countries whose relations
have been at odds over decades for differences in the Aegean Sea
and the prolonged Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that although such ideas had been raised for
years, they had not been in the form of official proposals.
</P>
<P>
Greece's policy allowed third parties to understand that Athens
wanted the rules of international law and order to be implemented,
he said, adding that if Turkey declared it would respect these
rules and recognized the jurisdiction of the international court
in the Hague, new conditions for the signing of a non-aggression
pact could be created.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Reppas also described the statements made in Paris
by Turkish President Suleyman Demirel regarding "grey areas" in
the Aegean Sea as a "provocation."
</P>
<P>
Greece has insisted that there is no dispute between the two
countries in the Aegean except the continental shelf, and invited
the neighboring country to refer all its claims in the Aegean to
the international court in the Hague.

<HEADLINE> S. African FM Defends Position on Taiwan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The South African
Department of Foreign Affairs on Monday rejected criticism of the
opposition National Party over Taiwan issues.
</P>
<P>
The National Party's criticism of Foreign Minister Alfred
Nzo's instructions to government ministers and officials on South
Africa's relations with Taiwan was "somewhat disingenuous",
Foreign Ministry spokesman Marco Boni said.
</P>
<P>
The severance of relations with Taiwan in favor of ties with
the People's Republic of China had certain practical
implications, Boni said.
</P>
<P>
China and South Africa officially established diplomatic
relations on January 1, 1998.
</P>
<P>
In a joint communique signed on December 30, 1997, South
Africa "recognizes that there is but one China in the world, the
Government of the People's Republic of China is the sole legal
government representing the whole of China and recognizes China's
position that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China".
</P>
<P>
Nzo had reportedly written a letter calling on his cabinet
colleagues and government officials not to attend functions of
the Taipei Liaison Offices if members of the public were also
present.
</P>
<P>
Boni stressed that South Africa's position on the issue was in
line with international law and state practice.
</P>
<P>
"In fact, it is the practice followed by no less than 159
countries and the reaction of a political party is somewhat
disingenuous because they ought to know that it is incumbent on
the minister to advise government on this new relations."
</P>
<P>
The National Party at the weekend criticized the ruling
African National Congress government (ANC), saying the ANC was
conducting a disgraceful vendetta against Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
It claimed in a statement that Nzo's letter "nullifies
President Mandela's pious promise that South Africa would
continue with the highest level of relations with Taiwan after
the recent breaking of official ties."
</P>
<P>
However, Mandela pledged at the end of last December that his
government would never resume its official ties with Taiwan after
the normalization of Pretoria-Beijing relations.

<HEADLINE> Kabbah's Team on Assessment Tour in Freetown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Exile President Ahmed Tejan
Kabbah of Sierra Leone has sent a special team to Freetown,
capital of Sierra Leone, to assess the situation there for his
return, which is expected to take place this week.
</P>
<P>
The committee, reportedly set up after the collapse of the
military junta about a fortnight ago, is to reassess damages and
look into the security of the state.
</P>
<P>
It may also try to find out who have collaborated with the
military junta which sent the elected government in exile for the
past nine months, according to a British Broadcasting Corporation
report monitored here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report disclosed that there is a list compiled by the
United Nations, which consists of businessmen, several
politicians and other Sierra Leoneans who have actually worked
with the junta.
</P>
<P>
However, the composition of the committee is said to have met
different responses among the Freetown residents,
</P>
<P>
Some people welcome the committee while some other people said
it is not what they have been expecting because nobody in the
committee have stayed in Freetown since the coup last May.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Kabbah met with members of his cabinet and the
parliament in Conakry, capital of Guinea, to discuss his return.
Leaders of west African countries also seem to agree an earlier
comeback of Kabbah than the originally fixed date of April 22.

<P>
"The success achieved allows further activity to implement
decisions of the international community on liquidation of Iraq's
potential in weapons of mass destruction", Tarasov said.
</P>
<P>
He said the signing of the agreement has proved Baghdad's
cooperation, adding that this should result in the lifting of
international sanctions against Iraq, which has affected the Iraqi
population seriously for more than seven years.
</P>
<P>
While praising the personal effort made by Annan, the Russian
spokesman said the positive result of Annan's mission is a success
and it also shows the efficiency of the U.N. in settling world
conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Tarasov said that the developments around Iraq over the past
few weeks allow us to draw several conclusions: the first, the
international community should seek implementation of decisions of
the U.N. Security Council as a key element of stability and
security throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
The second, he said, political and diplomatic efforts are an
optimal way for the settlement of conflicts; and the third, the
crucial international crisis can be settled only through
cooperation among all countries and primarily among permanent
members of the U.N. Security Council.

<HEADLINE> Internet Hurts Family Life: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Half of Canadians know someone
who spends so much time surfing the Internet or playing computer
games that it hurts their family life, according to a survey
published Monday.
</P>
<P>
"There is a resonance among many Canadians that the Internet is
helping to create new, virtual communities, and has the potential
to improve family life," the survey said.
</P>
<P>
"But there are also others who see it as impersonal,
dehumanizing and a distraction," it noted.
</P>
<P>
Forty-nine percent of those surveyed said they know people who
spend so much time at home using the Internet and other computer
activities that it is having a negative impact on their family
life.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, some 30 percent of those surveyed said they
strongly disagree with the notion that Internet has had a negative
impact on the quality of people's family life.
</P>
<P>
The survey, done by Ekos Research Associates Inc., interviewed
3,522 Canadians, according to the Globe and Mail newspaper.

<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Albanian government troops and
police on Monday regained control of Shkoder which was overrun by
armed rioters two days ago.
</P>
<P>
The disturbance began in the northern Albanian city on Sunday
afternoon when about 50 armed men took over a local police
station, freed more than 60 criminals and set fire to offices.
</P>
<P>
The situation worsened Sunday evening with gunfire was reported
across the city. Masked mobs looted and burnt down the local court
as well as other government buildings, banks and shops.
</P>
<P>
The Albanian Interior Ministry described the incident as a
"terrorist action" which was politically motivated. Some rioters
reportedly came from neighboring Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting of the National Security Committee on Monday
morning, Prime Minister Fatos Nano called on law enforcement
organisations to fight the rebels.
</P>
<P>
He vowed that the government and the Albanian people would
never submit to any criminal group and would use the rule of law
to safeguard public property and order.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The European Union agreed
Monday to resume high-level contact with Iran after the country
posted encouraging developments recently.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers of the 15-nation union, who met here for
a general affairs council meeting, concluded that the EU should
respond positively to the encouraging developments by increasing
the level of political contact with Iran.
</P>
<P>
As a start, the council meeting decided to resume the official
bilateral ministerial visits to explore the possibility of a new
dialogue.
</P>
<P>
EU countries recalled their diplomatic envoys for consultations
after the German court ruling but returned them last November
after resolving a stand-off over Tehran's demands that the German
ambassador return last.
</P>
<P>
Without waiting for the ban on high-level contact to be lifted,
French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine met his Iranian
counterpart, Kamal Kharrazi, in Geneva on January 29.

PARIS, February 23 (Xinhua) -- A six-month-old crocodile from
the Nile was "forgotten" by its owner in a bath tub of a Paris
hotel and has been sent to a local zoo, reported Agence

</P>

The crocodile, 61 centimeters long, was found by a cleaner. Its
owner abandoned it probably because he was told that the crocodile
could be five meters long once it grows up, said AFP.

Marie-Claude Bomsel, professor at the National Museum of

<HEADLINE>   Europe-Wide TV Competition Against Racism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Young people in Europe who
want to enter the TV industry can try their luck in a competition
against racism.
</P>
<P>
The competition, open to those aged between 17 and 25 from both
European Union member and associate states, is intended to attract
proposals for a 30-minute anti-racism documentary which are better
than anything produced in the past.
</P>
<P>
The initiative for the television competition was put forward
by the European Multicultural Media Agency in association with
major European broadcasters.
</P>
<P>
Designed to discover new talent with fresh ideas on tackling
the issue of the European Year Against Racism, the competition is
open to all young Europeans, particularly those from ethnic
minorities, European Commission officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
They added that the competition will put TV center stage in
combatting racial injustice.
</P>
<P>
A jury including representatives of five European broadcasters
and the European Commission will select four production proposals
to receive special production awards in April this year.
</P>
<P>
Production will take place between May and August and
broadcasting is scheduled for later this year.
</P>
<P>
It is planned to present adaptations of these productions as
educational packs for secondary schools or media study courses.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission designated the year 1998 as the
European Year Against Racism and a variety of activities were held
to arouse public awareness against the problem.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey conducted by the commission, the executive body
of the 15-nation European Union, revealed that one third of the
respondents to the survey claimed to be still "quite" racist in
mind at least.

<HEADLINE> EU Foreign Ministers Welcome UN-Iraq Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 23 (Xinhua) -- European Union foreign
ministers welcomed Monday the announcement that the United Nations
secretary-general had signed an agreement with the Iraqi
authorities on a diplomatic solution to the crisis with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Robin Cook, foreign secretary of Britain that is serving the
rotating presidency of the 15-nation union, told a press
conference that the one thing he would add to the foreign minister
council conclusion was that if there had been no pressure, there
would be no deal.
</P>
<P>
When asked to elaborate on the word "pressure," Cook said that
he meant the threat of the use of force.
</P>
<P>
The EU council meeting of foreign ministers noted that the
securing of an agreement was only possible because of the firm
resolve shown by the United Nations and the international
community.
</P>
<P>
The British foreign secretary said that Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein had climbed down from several of his demands in that he
had been restricting U.N. inspectors from tours of his
presidential palaces.
</P>
<P>
"There is no longer a time limit by when the inspectors have to
be out and there is no restriction on the work of inspectors,"
said Cook who was chairing the one-day council meeting of EU
foreign ministers.
</P>
<P>
"This represents very good progress but there remain some hard
questions to be asked about the precise nature of the agreement
and there will be hard work to be done to make sure that we are
satisfied that this is an agreement that can achieve our key
objective," he added.
</P>
<P>
Cook said that the key objective was to stop Saddam Hussein
from producing chemical and biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
The council meeting recalled that U.N. inspectors must be able
to resume effective inspections as mandated by the U.N. Security
Council resolutions and Iraq must allow U.N. inspectors
unrestricted and unfettered access to all sites and to carry out
effective inspections.
</P>
<P>
The British foreign secretary said that the council had
expressed concern at the humanitarian situation in Iraq and
appreciated the U.N. Security Council's resolution to more than
double the "oil-for-food" program.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan flew to Baghdad over the
weekend to negotiate the agreement, of which the details are still
not yet known.
</P>
<P>
Cook said that he was waiting for further details about the
agreement after Annan returns to New York and brief the U.N.
Security Council while Foreign Minister Jacques Poos of
Luxembourg, that was the previous rotating president of the
European Union, hoped that the details of the agreement would
allow the U.N. Security Council to accept it.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Cautiously Welcomes Iraq-UN Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait cautiously
welcomed Monday the agreement signed by U.N. Secretary General
Kofi Annan and Iraq, but wondered whether the agreement involved
full Iraqi implementation of all U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait Crown Prince and Prime Minister Sheikh Saad Al-Abdulla
Al-Sabah was quoted by Kuwait News Agency (KUNA) as saying that
"the agreement with Iraq needs more studying, we must read what is
between the lines."
</P>
<P>
He also wondered whether the agreement means that "Iraq agreed
to implement all UN resolutions?"
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Sheikh
Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah said that Kuwait is "happy for any
agreement signed to spare the region the dangers and at the
same time make Iraq comply with Security Council resolutions.
But we must first see the details of this agreement."
</P>
<P>
Annan signed an agreement with Iraq Monday which was said
to have settled all the major issues in Iraq's dispute with the
United Nations over weapons inspections. But details of the
agreement will be disclosed only after Annan submits it to
the U.N. Security Council Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Sabah said that Kuwait "welcomed the agreement before
knowing its details to avert dangers, but it is premature to
talk about the details."
</P>
<P>
Minister of Information Sheikh Saud Nasser Al-Sabah also
said that Kuwait "cautiously welcomes the agreement between
Annan and Iraq" until all the details are released, according
to the KUNA.

<HEADLINE> US Projects 2.5 Bln Dlr Drop in Farm Exports in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Attributing mainly to the
economic woe in Asia and global competition, the U.S. projected
farm exports for 1998 were lowered by 2.5 billion U.S. dollars,
announced Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Agriculture Department estimated this year's export could
reach 56 billion dollars, down from the original forecast of 58.5
billion dollars, which would be 2 percent below 1997 levels and
would be the lowest since the 54.6 billion dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The department also predicted that the country's beef, poultry
and pork production would exceed 1997 levels this year, which
could interpret it into lower meat prices for consumers. It also
said soybean and corn production was on the increase.
</P>
<P>
In an address at the annual agriculture outlook forum, Glickman
said the reduction again demonstrates the need for the
International Monetary Fund bailout and for the United States to
continue opening up markets as alternatives to Asia.
</P>
<P>
Since the department's December export projection, estimates
for corn exports were reduced by 7 million tons, or 11 percent
below 1997. Other sharp reductions were in exports of meat, hides
and skins, and fruit and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the IMF bailout, Glickman said the Agriculture
Department would continue its use of credit guarantees to enable
Asia's troubled economies to buy U.S. farm goods. Already, some
2.1 billion dollars in guarantees have been offered.
</P>
<P>
The soybean crop was forecast at 2.8 billion bushels, with corn
at 9.8 billion bushels. Wheat was expected to drop by 9 percent to
2.3 billion bushels and cotton production to decrease by 7
percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 23 (Xinhua) -- British companies were urged
Monday to share their experiences of dealing with the millennium
computer date problem by the Confederation of British Industries
(CBI).
</P>
<P>
It is known that supermarket cash tills may not work, car-park
barriers could get stuck, accounting programs could add up to 100
years extra interest to bank accounts and traffic lights may fail
if computers are not fully prepared for the start of the new
century.
</P>
<P>
Peter Agar, CBI's deputy director-general, said that companies
have only 20 months to make sure that their information technology
systems and embedded electronic devices can cope with the
millennium date change.
</P>
<P>
The millennium time-bomb would affect all companies, but there
are common solutions to the problem and companies can learn from
one another, he said.
</P>
<P>
To stimulate companies to act now, the CBI has produced a brief
which outlines what four leading UK companies, Sainsbury, Rover,
GRE and Yorkshire Electricity, have done to get ready for the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
Agar told a businessmen gathering here that companies must
carefully plan their use of time and resources if they are to
check all their electronic equipment and, where necessary, get it
reprogrammed before midnight on December 31, 1999.

<HEADLINE> HSBC Holdings Reports Pre-Tax Profit in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 23 (Xinhua) -- HSBC Holdings plc made a profit
before tax of 4,971 million pounds (7,953 million U.S. dollars) in
1997, an increase of 447 million pounds (715 million dollars), or
10 percent over 1996, John Bond, group chief executive, announced
here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Its net interest income of 6,680 million pounds (10,688 million
dollars) was 859 million pounds (1,374 million dollars), or 15
percent higher than 1996.
</P>
<P>
Other operating income of the group, one of the biggest
companies in the world, rose by 912 million pounds (1,456 million
dollars), or 24 percent to 4,679 million pounds (7,486 million
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Profit attributable to shareholders was 3,355 million pounds
(5,368 million dollars) in 1997, an increase of 8 percent,
according to the announcement.
</P>
<P>
However, the strengthening of sterling during 1997 reduced
growth in attributable profits by 4 percentage points compared to
1996, Bond said.
</P>
<P>
The group's total assets at 31 December 1997 were 286 billion
pounds (458 billion dollars), an increase of 50 billion pounds (80
billion dollars), or 21 percent since year-end 1996.

CAIRO, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Many countries across the world
welcomed the U.N.-Iraq agreement signed in Baghdad Monday on
peaceful solution to the arms inspections crisis. But the U.S. and
Britain said details of the agreement should be studied.
</P>
<P>
After two-day intensive talks, U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan signed the agreement Monday with Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz to solve the crisis over weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
China welcomed the agreement, which it hopes "will drive away
the war cloud over the Gulf region, laying a base for the
settlement of the weapons inspection crisis in a just and
reasonable way by peaceful means."
</P>
<P>
"We highly appreciate and support the diplomatic efforts made
by the U.N. Secretary General on the matter and positively value
the wisdom and flexibility demonstrated by relevant parties to
achieve the result," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu
Bangzao told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Russia, which has been making intensive efforts to defuse the
Iraq crisis in recent weeks, expressed satisfaction with the
encouraging results made by Iraq and U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin told reporters that the Iraq
crisis has been effectively contained through diplomatic efforts.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Ministry spokesman Anne Secret-Gazequ said
Annan's trip in Iraq which culminated in reaching the agreement
has taken a big step forward in defusing the crisis.
</P>
<P>
China, Russia and France are the three permanent members of the
U.N. Security Council that are strongly opposed to the use of
force against Iraq. U.S. and Britain, the other two members,
have threatened to resort to force if diplomacy fails.
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Minister Robin Cook said on Monday that the
deal looked "encouraging," but would have to be studied closely,
adding that Britain would hear details from Annan when he returns
to brief the U.N. Security Council in New York.
</P>
<P>
U.S. diplomats prepared Monday to analyze details of the
agreement as its forces in the Gulf maintained military readiness.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials emphasized that President Bill Clinton would not
comment in a substantive way until he knows more of the details of
the agreement.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has not reduced its military presence in the Gulf and
said it will not decide whether to endorse the agreement until
after making a careful study.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
Monday said that the Russian army and navy will accomplish
extremely important tasks of ensuring Russia's defense capability
and state security.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's remark was voiced in a message issued on the occasion
of the Day of the Fatherland's Defenders, the Interfax news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The president said, "Now that military reform is underway,
servicemen must display even greater professionalism, devote
themselves completely to their work and show genuine patriotism."
</P>
<P>
In the message Yeltsin noted that the state will do everything
it can to provide the armed forces with modern weapons and
equipment, and to improve the working and living conditions of the
servicemen and their families.
</P>
<P>
He said that Russia may count on its defenders and believed
that state defense is in reliable hands.

On the same day Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin told

of servicemen will be at least doubled in 1998.

UNITED NATIONS, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Development Program (UNDP) is delivering shovels, rakes, hoses and
other equipment to Indonesia to help stamp out blazes in the
island of Sumatra, UNDP said in a press release Monday.
</P>
<P>
The fires, still burning in many places, generated smoke that
shrouded much of Southeast Asia for weeks.
</P>
<P>
Fires consumed thousands of acres of Indonesian forest last
year. UNDP's efforts are aimed at avoiding similar damage there.
</P>

UNDP said it is also delivering food, farming equipment, radio
transmitters and other emergency supplies to victims of drought on
the Indonesian island of Iryan Jaja.

<HEADLINE> Israel to Continue Defense Preparation Despite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Israeli leaders ordered
Monday to continue the ongoing defense preparations despite the
agreement reached between U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and
the Iraqi government on weapons inspection.
</P>
<P>
Although there was an apparent sense of relief over the
U.N.-Iraqi agreement that could avert a possible U.S. military
attack on Iraq, Israeli leaders remained cautious if the Iraqi
crisis is over pending the reactions from the U.N. Security
Council, especially from the U.S..
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after attending a meeting of the Knesset
(Parliament) Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he thought the agreement is good
news as long as there's no "complicating details" within it.
</P>
<P>
Noting Israel is living in a new Middle East of missiles,
Netanyahu said Israel's defense preparedness would continue. He
claimed that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein would continue
developing weapons of mass destruction, so it was still too early
to say if the crisis is over.
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials widely believed that the U.N.-Iraq deal could
only bring a temporary break in the current crisis, and Saddam
would create new troubles in the future.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after Annan's announcement of reaching an
agreement in Baghdad, Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai convened
a meeting of senior security and army officers to reassess the
situation. He ordered the continuation of civil preparedness and
acceleration of acquiring protection equipment from abroad.
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, the various gas masks distribution centers around
the country will also continue to be open 24 hours daily,
although the usually long queues have disappeared in most centers
due to the positive news from Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
The only thing that has been put on hold is the free
distribution of antibiotics to citizens through the pharmacy
shops, which was originally due to begin late Monday.
</P>
<P>
In the past weeks, Israel has been nervously following the
developments in the Persian Gulf as the military
Iraqi-U.N. standoff continued escalating.
</P>
<P>
A panic was created among the public as the government warned
that Iraq could retaliate U.S. military actions by firing
biological and chemical missiles at Israel.

<HEADLINE> Mugabe Wants Dialogue Not Violence to Settle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe has urged Zimbabweans to engage in dialogue as a means of
articulating their grievances and shun a culture of violence
which seemed to be fueled by the labor movement leaders.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe made the appeal at a solidarity rally in Chitungwiza
near Harare Sunday. The president called for the rally following
food riots which rocked the town recently resulting in massive
destruction of property.
</P>
<P>
He said, "we went to war, and you elected your government so
that it can govern in peace. We must, therefore, not be seen to
be fighting among ourselves. There must be a culture of dialogue
and discussion."
</P>
<P>
He said such a spirit had culminated in the unity accord which
brought a halt to the dissident activities in the country.
</P>
<P>
Chitungwiza was one of the towns which was hardest hit when
people went on an orgy of looting and damaged shops during the
food riots last month.
</P>
<P>
Rioting and looting would not provide the solutions, Mugabe
said, urging the trade union leaders to desist from inciting
riots which culminated in wanton thefts and damage to property.

<HEADLINE> Oman Calls Security Council to Approve Iraqi Deal </HEADLINE>

ABU DHABI, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Oman called the
U.N. Security Council to approve the agreement signed Monday
between Iraq and U.N. Chief Kofi Annan on peaceful solution of the
Iraq-U.N. crisis on arms inspection.
</P>
<P>
The Omani news agency quoted a Foreign Ministry spokesman,
whose name was not given, as saying that Muscat hoped the agreement
"will be approved by the U.N. Security Council."
</P>
<P>
The approval "will double opportunities of achieving peace and
help Iraq's compliance with U.N. resolutions so as to save the
Iraqi people from further suffering," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the past days, his country attached serious
concerns over the efforts by Annan during his visit in Baghdad to
bring about a "peaceful and satisfactory" settlement to the crisis.
And now, he said, Muscat was happy to see such a solution.
</P>
<P>
After rounds of talks, Annan and Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz signed the agreement on peacefully resolving the
crisis in Baghdad Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
Annan has left Baghdad for New York and will discuss the deal
with the five permanent members of the Security Council Tuesday.
He said he is hopeful that all the permanent members will accept
the deal.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain have threatened to launch military strike
against Iraq if Annan's trip to Baghdad, starting from Friday,
failed to persuade Iraq to grant full access to the U.N. arms
inspectors.

<HEADLINE> UK to Maintain Military Presence in Gulf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Britain said Monday that
although the deal reached by United Nations Secretary General Kofi
Annan with Iraq looked encouraging, it would not scale down its
military preparations in the Gulf for now.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Secretary Robin Cook spoke on the BBC radio that
Britain would not comment on the deal until being briefed by Annan
Tuesday, but he added that he hoped very much it was the deal
Britain was looking for.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary George Robertson also said that Britain would
like to know the details of the accord and be absolutely certain
that Iraq would comply with it before removing its military
presence in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
"We will obviously want to look at the detail of whatever deal
has been signed, and we certainly won't be doing anything about
removing our military capability until we are absolutely certain
that Saddam will comply," Robertson told the BBC radio.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a Downing Street spokesman made clear that Britain
had yet to see a text of the agreement with Iraq, and was still
cautious.
</P>
<P>
"Until we are 100 percent sure that this agreement will assure
all our objectives, there can be no question of scaling down
military preparations. Those preparations will go on," he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman added that Britain had told its U.N. ambassador
Michael Weston to step up work on a new Security Council
resolution which would give authority for the U.N. to respond
"rapidly and by whatever means are necessary" should Saddam break
the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Britain has been standing firmly side by side with the U.S. in
the weeks-long arms inspection crisis with Iraq and has sent an
aircraft carrier and combat aircraft to the Gulf region.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Reiterates Right to Deploy Russian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot Government spokesman
Manolis Christofides stressed here Monday that Cyprus has every
right to purchase and deploy the Russian S-300 anti-aircraft
missiles in order to strengthen its defenses.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the missiles will be deployed after Autumn
and there is no change in the date of arrival.
</P>
<P>
He was commenting at his daily press briefing on a statement
by a U.S. official carried by a Greek newspaper Sunday that the
U.S. cannot prevent a possible attempt by Turkey to destroy the
missiles.
</P>
<P>
Christofides said the Turkish threats are not new and noted
that the U.S. has objected to the deployment of the missile
system.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government decided last year to purchase
Russian-made S-300 surface-to-air missile system to raise its
defense capability.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has threatened to strike the missiles if they are
deployed on the island.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman cited a statement Sunday by Cypriot President
Glafcos Clerides that all the necessary measures have been taken
in case the missiles are attacked.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island in the wake
of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. and international community have been trying for
decades to reunite the divided island as a bizonal, bicommunal
federal state, but so far no tangible results have been
achieved.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Hails U.N.-Iraqi Deal on Arms Inspection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Turkey Monday welcomed the
agreement reached by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and the
Iraqi government over weapons inspection which could avert a
military strike on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference here, Turkish Foreign Minister
Ismail Cem said that Turkey is satisfied with the U.N.-Iraqi
accord signed by the U.N. chief and Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz because it could help defuse the crisis in a peaceful
way.
</P>
<P>
"We are satisfied with the agreement and we are proud of our
minor contribution in that direction," Cem said, referring to the
efforts Turkey had made in finding a diplomatic solution to
the U.S.-Iraqi standoff.
</P>
<P>
He said that what should be done now is to "remove those
political and social factors that cause the crisis step by step."
However, he did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
On the role of the newly signed U.N.-Iraqi agreement, Cem
noted that this is not the end of the crisis and more efforts have
to be made for a final settlement.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said that he will visit Jordan on
Thursday to exchange views with the kingdom's leadership over the
current situation in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has been urging Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to
comply fully with the relevant U.N. Security Council resolutions
in order to avert military confrontation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Turkish leaders said on many occasions that the
economic sanctions imposed on Iraq seven years ago should be
lifted as early as possible so that the Iraqi people could live a
normal life.
</P>
<P>
The lift of the sanctions imposed on Iraq due to its invasion
of Kuwait in 1990 can not take place unless U.N. weapons
inspectors verify that Iraq has been disarmed weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's refusal to inspectors of free and unfettered access to
all suspected sites triggered off the current crisis. The U.S. and
Britain threatened to launch military strike against Iraq if
diplomacy failed to solve the standoff peacefully.
</P>
<P>
Annan and Aziz signed the agreement Monday morning in Baghdad
which the U.N. chief said will be acceptable to all the members of
the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. administration, however, reiterated that Iraq must
comply with the U.N. resolutions and said that preparations for
military strikes against Baghdad will not stop.

and took the four military observers hostage. Two rounds of talks
have been held between the government of Georgia and the gunmen on
the release of the hostages.

<P>
According to the released observer, the other three observers
held are in good condition of health, Carlos said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the Security Council of the United Nations
is remained seized on the matter and has urged the Department of
Peacekeeping Operation to inform it on the latest development.

<HEADLINE> Greek FM Hopes UN-Iraq Deal Ends Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Greek Foreign Minister
Theodoros Pangalos Monday expressed his hope that the agreement
reached by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan with Iraq would put an
end to the Iraq-U.N. standoff over arms inspection.
</P>
<P>
Pangalos made the statement here Monday morning upon the news
that Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz and the U.N. chief had
signed the deal in Baghdad on resolving the crisis peacefully.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after meeting with Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak, the Greek diplomat accused Washington of applying
double standards in dealing with the Mideast affairs.
</P>
<P>
"I fully agree with what has been said by President Mubarak
that the United States dealt with various issues with double
standards," he added, referring to Mubarak's criticism of the
U.S. in an interview with CNN on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that countries will deal with other similar issues with
the same determination the Iraqi crisis was dealt with," Pangalos
added.
</P>
<P>
The Greek foreign minister said he discussed with the Egyptian
president international issues including the peace march in the
Middle East and the Iraq crisis.
</P>
<P>
Official talks between the two sides are to open Monday night
at the Foreign Ministry headquarters under the co-chairmanship of
Pangalos and his Egyptian counterpart Amr Moussa. Conditions in the
Middle East and the Balkan region are expected to top their agenda.

<HEADLINE> Agency Set Up to Assist Less Advantaged Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- A new agency within the
framework of the World Trade Organization (WTO) was inaugurated
here Monday to help less advantaged countries (LACs) integrate
into the new international trade environment.
</P>
<P>
The newly established Agency for International Trade
Information and Cooperation, to be funded by the Swiss federal
government, is aimed at assist LACs to benefit from the
multilateral trading system through a more active participation in
the activities and negotiations of the WTO and other trade-related
international organizations.
</P>
<P>
LACs refer to least developed and other low income countries
including some economies in transition, where the annual income
per capita is less than 1,000 U.S. dollars and the participation
in international trade has not been active traditionally.
</P>
<P>
The assistance that the agency will provide include:
</P>
<P>
-- To define priorities for a delegation which may have only
one person specializing on trade matters and he has a large number
of meetings to cover in several different organizations;
</P>
<P>
-- In a similar situation, to provide summaries and analysis of
lengthy documents on issues on which a LAC may have an interest,
but has not been able to follow in the past;
</P>
<P>
-- To provide information to countries which do not have a
mission in Geneva, and to facilitate interaction with the staff of
the different trade-related organizations;
</P>
<P>
-- To assist Geneva-based diplomats in becoming familiarized
with trade-related issues through a personalized service.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin, Clinton Talk on Resolution on Iraq by </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
and U.S. President Bill Clinton had a telephone conversation
Monday over the Iraq problem and decided to instruct their foreign
ministers to work out a U.N. Security Council resolution on the
Arab state.
</P>
<P>
The Interfax news agency cited presidential press secretary
Sergei Yastrzhembsky as saying that the two leaders stressed "the
great positive significance of the agreements reached in Baghdad
between Annan and the Iraqi leadership."
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said that the Annan-Baghdad understanding may open the
door to the implementation of all U.N. Security Council
resolutions on Iraq and consequently to the complete elimination
of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said it is impermissible to have a repetition of the
current crisis in Iraq resulting from the suspension of the
operation of U.N. inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said that the agreement signed Monday morning by Annan
and the Iraqi leadership offers a guarantee to prevent new crises.
</P>
<P>
The Russian president attributed the success to the unity of
all permanent members of the U.N. Secruity Council and other
influential members of the world community, saying "we will be
able to avoid serious international crises on a regional as well
as on a global scale in the future."
</P>
<P>
Clinton, meanwhile, said he is aware of the great work done by
Russia to find a peaceful solution.
</P>
<P>
Yastrzhembsky was also quoted as saying that Yeltsin Monday
sent messages to Clinton, Annan and Chinese Chairman Jiang Zemin,
and on behalf of the Russian leadership praised the results of
Annan's mission to Baghdad and the understandings reached there in
the context of the political settlement of the Iraqi crisis.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Opposition Ends Political Ceasefire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Hardly has the Iraq crisis
passed, Israel's opposition Labor Party immediately decided
Monday to end the political ceasefire with the government
observed since early this month.
</P>
<P>
The leading opposition party announced that it would table a
non-confidence motion in the Knesset (Parliament) next Monday
against the Likud-led government over its poor handling of the
Iraq crisis.
</P>
<P>
Since the standoff between Iraq and the United States over the
United Nations weapons inspection escalated early the month, the
opposition parties Labor and Meretz voluntarily announced a
political ceasefire by halting tabling non-confidence
motions. They said this ceasefire would help show solidarity
in face of the threat to its national security.
</P>
<P>
Breaking the month-long silence over the government's
performance, Labor lawmakers lashed out Monday at Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu and the government for failing to deal with
the crisis properly.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting of Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense
Committee (FADC) which also include several opposition members,
Netanyahu came under strong criticism for creating unnecessary
panic among the public in the past weeks.
</P>
<P>
Labor lawmaker Eli Goldschmidt blamed the prime minister for
displaying incapability to deal with crises and lacking the
leadership needed to tackle such situation. He was referring to
the government's call on the public to stock gas masks, sealing
materials and food to prepare for a possible Iraqi attack.
</P>
<P>
Another Labor lawmaker Binyamin Ben Eliezer slammed the
government for exposing Israel's softness under bully because of
its poor leadership. He said the government has made "the
strongest people in Middle East was shown scared and in tatters"
during the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Labor's Secretary-General Rannan Cohen declared that
Netanyahu's move has made Iraqi President Saddam Hussein "the King
of Arab world," while weakening the Arab moderates, such as
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Jordan's King Hussein.
</P>
<P>
However, Netanyahu strongly defended the government's behavior
during the crisis, saying that its every step taken was proper
and Israeli defense capability has not been harmed.
</P>
<P>
He said Israel also gained a great deal of valuable experience
from the recent crisis, adding Saddam Hussein in fact respected
Israeli defense capability throughout the crisis. He referred to
the fact that Saddam, unlike what he did during the 1991 Gulf
War, never threatened to attack Israel this time.
</P>
<P>
Uzi Landau, Chairman of the Knesset Foreign Affairs and
Defense Committee, also counter attacked the opposition for its
"cheap exploitation" of the Iraq crisis. But even he himself had
reservations about the government's decision to purchase about
400,000 gas masks and medicines from European countries and the
U.S..
</P>
<P>
Landau, together with Likud veteran lawmaker Benny Begin, said
the money spent on gas masks should be used to purchase
anti-missile defense systems.

PARIS, February 23 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
and U.S. President Bill Clinton agreed Monday that the agreement
reached by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan with Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein should be implemented "as soon as possible," said
French presidential spokeswoman Catherine Colonna.
</P>
<P>
During a half-an-hour telephone conversation, Chirac and

recommendations made by the five permanent members of the Security

</P>
<P>
The two presidents also agreed that the United Nations Security

-- on the agreement as soon as Annan presents it Tuesday, said
Colonna.
</P>

Annan arrived here Monday evening from Baghdad after completing
successfully his "impossible mission" during which he struck a
deal with Saddam Hussein on U.N. inspection of eight presidential
sites.

<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Bahrain Monday welcomed the
agreement signed between Iraq and the U.N. chief Kofi Annan on
arms inspection, the official Bahraini news agency monitored here
reported.
</P>
<P>
In a statement published by the agency, Bahrain's Foreign
Ministry said Manama welcomed "the reaching of the agreement
between Iraq and U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on the Iraq-U.N.
dispute over international arms inspection mission."
</P>
<P>
The peaceful solution "will protect the (Gulf) region's
security and stability" and "will help save the Iraqi people from
further suffering," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
It also highly praised Annan's mission in Baghdad, saying the
efforts by the U.N. chief "summed up" all diplomatic efforts and
peaceful drives made for dismantling weapons of mass destruction
in Iraq and averting a military confrontation in the region.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz and Annan signed the
agreement in Baghdad Monday morning with the aim of resolving the
crisis peacefully.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, Baghdad will unconditionally allow
U.N. inspectors charged with dismantling Iraqi weapons of mass
destruction access to all sites suspected of containing biological
or chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
The signing of the agreement may help defuse a possible military
showdown against Baghdad by the U.S. and Britain.
</P>
<P>
The two Western powers had threatened to launch military attack
on Iraq if Annan's mission to Baghdad starting on Friday failed to
persuade Iraq to back down.

<P>
TEHRAN, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi Monday made a telephone call to his Pakistani
counterpart Gohar Ayub Khan, urging Islamabad to take serious
action to arrest and punish those involved in assassination of
two Iranians in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian official news agency IRNA reported that Kharrazi
expressed dismay at the performance of the Pakistani government
in identifying and arresting the terrorist elements involved in
killing Iranian nationals in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
He said that regrettably, lack of serious action on the part
of the Islamabad government to deal with the previous cases of
assassinations of Iranian nationals has paved the way for the
continuation of the terrorist acts.
</P>
<P>
"We are eagerly anticipating to see the Pakistani government
to take serious action to arrest and punish those involved in
terrorist attacks against the Iranian nationals," he said,
voicing Tehran's readiness to help Islamabad solve security
issues concerning the Iranian nationals in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Ayub Khan expressed condolence to Kharrazi over the killings
of two Iranian engineers and promised that the Pakistani
government would do all it can to put an end to such incidents.
</P>
<P>
The two Iranian engineers, Ali Mohammad Habibzadeh and Mortaza
Adibzadeh, were shot dead in Karachi by unidentified armed men
Saturday afternoon. Pakistani leaders have expressed regret to the
incident.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the state-run television, Kharrazi
stressed that it was not enough to express regret, "for us it is
important to identify, arrest and punish the real terrors."
</P>
<P>
He said that Iran would soon send a delegation to Pakistan to
investigate the issue, adding that the Pakistani government
should take more serious measures to fight against terrorist
activities in order that relations between the two neighbors
would not be damaged by such crimes.

PARIS, February 23 (Xinhua) -- France's political leaders and
government officials Monday unanimously welcomed the agreement
reached by United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan with Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
French President Jacques Chirac renewed his full confidence in
the action of Annan, and had a telephone conversation with U.S.
President Bill Clinton.

The two presidents agreed that the agreement should be

<HEADLINE> Annan: Use of Military Force Unnecessary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, February 23 (Xinhua) -- United Nations Secretary-General
Kofi Annan said here Monday that the signing of the
Iraq-U.N. agreement on weapons inspection made it unnecessary for
the United States to resort to force against Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
"I think everyone is relieved that we were able to defuse the
crisis and the use of military force will not be necessary,"
Annan told reporters after meeting Jordanian Crown Prince Hassan
during his stopover in Amman en route to Paris.
</P>
<P>
"We had very useful, frank, honest and constructive
discussions in Baghdad. We had successful talks," said the U.N.
secretary general. he refused to elaborate on details of the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Annan said that he hoped all the Security Council members would
accept the agreement when he submitted it to them in New York
later so that Iraq as well as the region could be spared
disasters.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief expressed appreciation for Jordan's efforts in
helping defuse the tension.
</P>
<P>
"The king (Hussein) is one of the leaders in the region and is
someone who understands also the situation in Iraq and is someone
I have been working with, seeking his support and help to defuse
the situation," he added.
</P>
<P>
Annan said that he made a telephone call to the king after
concluding the agreement with the Iraqi government.
</P>
<P>
"When we succeeded, I called him to tell him what we have
done and thanked him for his cooperation and support."
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Hassan told reporters that he hoped the
agreement would lead to a solution to the crisis over arms
inspections and put an end to the plight of the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
Hassan said that Annan did not brief him on the details of the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Annan and Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz signed the
agreement Monday morning in Baghdad. The U.N. chief is expected to
submit it to the Security Council soon for discussion.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Will of Peace Overpowers Threat of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Neither Iraqi nor U.S. leaders
are entitled to claim the winner in the Iraq crisis that was
eased, if not totally defused, with the signing of a U.N.-brokered
agreement Monday -- the prevailing will of peace is.
</P>
<P>
Many analysts said Iraq was playing games or tricks with the
U.S. in the crisis so as to attract world's attention to its
sufferings of the seven-year-old U.N. sanctions, believing it has
won the game without losing anything.
</P>
<P>
Others said the United States has succeeded in forcing Iraq
down to kneels by a huge military buildup in the region.
</P>
<P>
But the key factor is that the agreement would have been
impossible if without the will of peace across the
world. Addressing a press conference, U.N. chief Kofi Annan
especially expressed his thanks to the world leaders and peoples
who contributed to the success of his peace mission in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed by Annan and Iraqi Deputy Prime
Minister Tariq Aziz. No details were disclosed but Annan said that
if the accord is carried out honestly, there would not be more
problems.
</P>
<P>
The crisis was triggered as Iraq denied access of sensitive
places like presidential sites to U.N. weapons inspectors. It also
said the U.S. and Britain, whose personnel take important
positions in the inspection teams, were willingly delaying the
lifting of U.N. sanctions on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain were quick enough to unleash their threat
of military attack on Iraq if it does not change stand.
</P>
<P>
Obviously determined are the U.S. and Britain to launch
"substantial" attack on Iraq, but facts undoubtedly suggest that
the two world powers feel weak in boasting the moral support
garnered from their own citizens and allies.
</P>
<P>
Many Americans posed the question: if Iraqi Leader Saddam
Hussein is to blame for all the wrongdoings as said, why should
the Iraqi people bear the sufferings of a war. No answer was
strong enough to calm down an increasingly high uproar for a
peaceful solution.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and British leaders have been warned of the backfire
of the possible war: accusation of killing innocent Iraqis,
losing Arab friends, expected casualties of armed troops, war cost
and its impact on economy, a destabilized regional situation and so
on.
</P>
<P>
What is more eye-catching is that three other permanent members
of the United Nations Security council, namely China, Russia and
France, firmly oppose the use of force. Their positions surely
have backed the success of Annan's peace mission.
</P>
<P>
In fact, most of the other countries, especially Arabs, have
expressed their opposition to war and some, like Egypt and Jordan,
were active in mediation. Few Arab allies announced support to a
military attack.
</P>
<P>
Call for peace is now too loud to be ignored by Washington and
London who have to condition the wage of raid on failure of
diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
On the part of Iraq, the showing of flexibility in negotiations
with Annan, as a move in a game or whatever strategy, can be
regarded as an effort that paves way for a peaceful solution --
the will of peace prevailed over anything and worked.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, an overwhelming hail of the Baghdad accord heard
across the world is a demonstration of the power of peace as
against war threat.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain have not canceled their war plan and the
crisis is far from over, but as Annan said "You can never
underestimate the power of prayer (for peace)."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Willing to Back ECOMOG Efforts in S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The United States is willing to
support the efforts of the Nigerian-led west African peacekeeping
force (ECOMOG) in Sierra Leone, the News Agency of Nigeria
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. would be ready to assist in the airlifting of troops
from west African countries that have indicated to contribute
additional troops to ECOMOG in maintaining peace in that country
following the ejection of the military junta, the official agency
said, quoting U.S. ambassador to Nigeria William Twaddell.
</P>
<P>
However, a request had to be made to the U.S. and approved by
the U.S. congress, the envoy said in the Nigerian capital Abuja
at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
According to Twaddell, the U.S. had set a precedent in Liberia
where it contributed 90 million U.S. Dollars and assisted in the
airlifting of troops from some west African countries for the
peacekeeping operation.
</P>
<P>
Twaddell's remarks came in the wake of a U.S. State Department
statement last Thursday that promised succor to the civilian
population in Sierra Leone, who are said to be suffering from a
lack of food and medicine.
</P>
<P>
The envoy also explained his country's initiative on the
formation of a standing African peacekeeping force, saying that
it is intended to enable the continent to respond quickly to
emergencies.
</P>
<P>
Contrary to the notion that the initiative was intended to
encourage foreign domination, it would encourage collaboration
with other countries in tackling emergencies in Africa, he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has been contributing three million Dollars annually
to conflict resolution in Africa, Twaddell said, adding that the
initiative should be seen as part of a contingency plan to equip
African countries with a quick response capability.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria has consistently rejected an external initiative for
conflict resolution on the continent, arguing that Africans are
in the best position to determine appropriate approach.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian head of state General Sani Abacha has indicated it is
a good way to form an African peacekeeping force with ECOMOG as
nuclear.

reacted warily to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's deal with
Baghdad over the weapons inspection crisis in Iraq, calling for
immediate military action if Iraq does not live up to terms
necessary for carrying out U.N. weapons resolutions.
</P>
<P>
House Speaker Newt Gingrich said he hoped the agreement reached
by Annan and Iraq officials would avoid a conflict between
Washington and Baghdad by making Iraq a chemical and biological
weapons-free country.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that Annan has gotten a good agreement and I hope it is
one that guarantees a chemical and biological weapons-free Iraq,"
Gingrich said at a gathering of business leaders in Smyrna,
Georgia.
</P>
<P>
He urged the Clinton administration to be ready for immediate
action against Baghdad if Iraqi President Saddam Hussein fails to
live up to the terms set by the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Republican Senator John McCain told the business leaders before
Gingrich's remarks that he was concerned that even if the issue
was resolved for now, it was far from over.
</P>
<P>
"I think in the short term, we have averted a situation where
American lives would have been lost," he said. "But in the long
term, I am still deeply concerned because I have received no
indication Saddam Hussein has changed his commitment to acquiring
and using weapons of mass destruction."
</P>
<P>
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said President Clinton may be
"in a box" -- stuck with a poor agreement he has to accept.
</P>
<P>
"I was worried that this initiative by Annan was going to put
the president in a box and that's exactly what's happened," Lott
told reporters at the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
"This is another example of how the administration's foreign
policy is subcontracted to other.... Everybody says this is good
enough, and yet it may not be good enough," He said. "But the
president would be in such a box because of the way it was handled
he had no alternative."
</P>
<P>
In an interview with CNN, Republican Senator Arlen Specter said
that even if Annan's deal is solid, the U.S. government should
step up efforts to oust Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
"One way or another we're going to have to topple Saddam
Hussein" to ensure that he does not build weapons of mass
destruction, he told CNN.
</P>
<P>
He said he planned to propose that Saddam be brought before an
international war crimes tribunal.

<HEADLINE> Egypt: More Steps Needed to Implement UN-Iraq Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Egypt said Monday "some other
steps" are needed to be taken to put into practice the U.N.-Iraqi
deal on resolving the arms inspection crisis peacefully.
</P>
<P>
Giving credit to the agreement signed by U.N. chief Kofi Annan
and the Iraqi government Monday, Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa lauded it as "a key stride" in the international drive to
defuse the crisis.
</P>
<P>
However, Moussa told reporters that the deal has not been
submitted to the U.N. Security Council for approval.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt is awaiting this and following up the situation," he
stressed. However, he said he could not elaborate on future steps,
given that details of the agreement has not yet been unveiled.
</P>
<P>
But he said the agreement, signed by Annan and Iraqi Deputy
Prime Minister Tariq Aziz in Baghdad, has the "official nature"
and meets all requirements of the parties concerned.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that the agreement will defuse regional tension," he
added.
</P>
<P>
In his first reaction to the conclusion of the Iraqi-U.N. deal
Monday morning, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak expressed hope
that the U.S. would back the agreement in the Security Council and
voiced fear that any violation of the deal will drag the region
into a "terrible situation."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has insisted that any agreement must allow
U.N. weapons inspectors free and full access to all sites and
maintain the integrity of the U.N. Special Commission charged with
scrapping Iraqi weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The breakthrough in settling the crisis came after rounds of
intensive talks Annan held with Iraqi leaders since his
arrival in Baghdad Friday in a last-ditch effort to bring about a
political solution.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The opposition National Union
for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) is still trying to
block the peace process by creating troubles in some places of
Angola, local media reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report said that in the latest developments, nearly 20
UNITA soldiers launched an attack against Catata town in central
Huambo Province, committing atrocities to local civilians.
</P>
<P>
The looting, kidnaping and beating by the UNITA soldiers has
thrown local people into panic and threatened stability in the
region, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The UNITA has also set barriers before the re-establishment of
local governments in the areas under its control. It tried its
best to check the efforts to re-set up local governments in Jamba
and Licua in southeast Kuando-Kubango Province.
</P>
<P>
So far, no progress has been achieved in the talks between the
Angolan government and the UNITA on the issue.
</P>
<P>
With regard to the purpose of the UNITA on the issue, military
sources disclosed that the UNITA is mapping a new military plan
which considers Jamba and Licua as strategic points. The two
places are also hiding a great number of UNITA soldiers, they
added.

<HEADLINE> OIC Welcomes Deal Signed by UN Chief, Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of
Islamic Conference (OIC) Monday welcomed the deal signed in
Baghdad between U.N. Chief Kofi Annan and Iraq on resolving the
Iraq-U.N. standoff over weapons inspection.
</P>
<P>
Ezzidine Laraki, secretary general of the Jeddah (Saudi
Arabia)-based organization, said in a statement that he hoped "the
deal would put an end to the crisis and (U.S.) threats to launch
military strikes against Iraq," Kuwait News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
After several rounds of talks, Annan signed the agreement with
Iraq Monday morning to try to end the Iraq crisis peacefully.
</P>
<P>
The deal was said to have settled all the major issues in
Iraq's dispute with the U.N. over weapons inspections. But details
of the agreement will be disclosed only after Annan returns to
New York Tuesday and submits it to the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The OIC has expressed its support for a diplomatic solution to
the crisis and urged Iraq to fully comply with the
U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia, Oman and Qatar also joined a number of
Arab states and the Arab League Monday in welcoming the deal.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi Cabinet, during a weekly meeting chaired by King
Fahd Ibn Abdul Aziz, expressed its satisfaction of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Information Minister Fuad Farisi was quoted by Saudi
Press Agency as reiterating Saudi Arabia's stand that Iraq should
comply with all the U.N. resolutions so as to guarantee the
security and stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
In Doha, Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Hamad Bin Jassim Bin
Jabir Al-Thani said the agreement constitutes a positive step
toward Iraq's compliance with all U.N. resolutions, adding that
the agreement would spare the people of Iraq the hardship of war.
</P>
<P>
In Muscat, Oman's capital, a Foreign Ministry spokesman also
expressed his country's welcome of the agreement and thanked
Annan for his efforts to clinch the deal.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait also cautiously welcomed the agreement although it
wondered whether the agreement involved full Iraqi implementation
of all U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait Crown Prince and Prime Minister Sheikh Saad Al-Abdulla
Al-Salem Al-Sabah was quoted by Kuwait News Agency as saying that
"the agreement with Iraq needs more studying, we must read what
is between the lines."
</P>
<P>
But Kuwait Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Sheikh
Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah Al-Sabah said that Kuwait is "happy for
any agreement signed to spare the region the dangers and at the
same time make Iraq comply with Security Council resolutions. But
we must first see the details of this agreement."

<P>
Egypt, Jordan, Syria, the Palestinian National Authority,
Tunisia, Algeria and the Arab League also welcomed the deal.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 23 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's former
state president Pieter Botha Monday pledged not guilty to charges
of ignoring summons to appear before the Truth and Reconciliation
Commission.
</P>
<P>
Botha, who is 82 years old, appeared in court Monday morning
after refusing to give evidence before the commission, a
government-appointed special court hearing crimes committed under
apartheid.
</P>
<P>
Botha's lawyer, Lappe Laubscher, argues the commission has
broken a promise not to require the former head of state to
attend a commission hearing in person.
</P>
<P>
The lawyer accuses the commission of acting maliciously toward
Botha and of bias for claiming most of its members are supporters
of the ruling African National Congress.
</P>
<P>
The commission had called Botha to testify before the hearing
in December for his leadership of the now-defunct State Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
The council's task was to enforce the racial segregation
policies of the white-minority regime.
</P>
<P>
Last week, South African President Nelson Mandela held talks
with Botha's family over his continued refusal to appear before
the commission, chaired by retired Anglican archbishop Desmond
Tutu.

<HEADLINE> Supreme Court Rejects Ruby Ridge Civil Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The Supreme Court of the
United States Monday rejected a review of an appeals court ruling
that allows a civil suit against federal officials arising out of
the Ruby Ridge standoff in Idaho in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Kevin Harris, a friend of white separatist Randy Weaver, filed
the suit, contending that the U.S. marshals, FBI agents and
officials in both agencies conspired to deprive him of his rights.
</P>
<P>
Six U.S. marshals were sent to Ruby Ridge to serve a warrant on
a weapons charge against Weaver. As they staked out the remote
hillside, they were discovered and engaged in a shootout with
Weaver, Harris and Weaver's 14-year-old son Samuel. Samuel Weaver
and a federal marshal were killed in the firefight.
</P>
<P>
Later, a member of the FBI's Hostage Rescue Team fired shots at
Harris and Weaver, believing the men were firing at a government
helicopter from the Weaver compound. He fired at Harris as he dove
back into the Weaver house. The round passed through Harris and
killed Weaver's wife.
</P>
<P>
In his suit, Harris claimed that marshals lied about the
initial firefight, and that the FBI's aggressive rules of
engagement led the sharpshooter to wound him.
</P>
<P>
When a federal judge threw out some of Harris's claims but left
others intact and an appeals court agreed, a group of the federal
law enforcement officers asked the Supreme Court for review, which
was denied Monday without comment.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Urges Follow-up Steps to End Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi chief delegate to the Arab
League Nabil Nejm said here Monday that Baghdad needs follow-up
steps to put an end to the sanctions against the Iraqi people
after it signed a deal with the U.N. Chief Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
"Today's agreement between Baghdad and the U.N. is a step on
the right path that must be followed by others towards the lifting
of sanctions on the Iraqi people," Nejm told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Annan and Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz Monday signed
the agreement on reaching a political solution to the crisis over
arms inspection. But the deal still needs the ratification of the
Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Sanctions on Iraq imposed after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait can
not be removed until the council verifies Iraq has destroyed all
its long-range missiles and weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Nejm refused to call the agreement as a concession by this or
that party, saying that it is "rather a balanced political
solution taking into account the interests of all parties
concerned, foremost Iraq's right to sovereignty."
</P>
<P>
He said his country's ultimate aim is to arrive at a political
solution that preserves its legitimate rights.
</P>
<P>
The U.N.-Iraq standoff has been escalating since last November
when Iraq refused to give U.N. arms inspectors unfettered access
to its presidential compounds on grounds of sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Nejm also slammed the U.S. claim that under U.N. Security
Council resolution 687 which allegedly invests the U.S. with the
right to use force, Washington does not need a U.N. approval to
attack Iraq if diplomatic efforts fail.
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing in the Security Council resolutions that
authorizes the use of force against Iraq," said the Iraqi
official, adding that "its insistence on using force is evidence
that it has no respect for the international will."
</P>
<P>
The U.S., a permanent member of the Security Council, has
insisted that any agreement must allow unrestricted access to all
sites and the integrity of the U.N. Special Commission on
scrapping Iraqi weapons of mass destruction. Otherwise, it will
attack Iraq to force its compliance with U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The breakthrough came as a result of tough talks Annan held
with Iraqi leaders since Friday in a last-ditch attempt to seek
Iraqi implementation of U.N. resolutions and avert imminent
U.S. military attack on Iraq.

PARIS, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The national secretary of the
French Communist Party, Robert Hue, Monday hailed the U.N.-Iraq
agreement on arms inspection, which he said "gives credit to the
U.N. Secretary-General" and the "mobilization of opinion"

<P>
"I am delighted at the agreement because it was not clear
(what would happen) even a few days ago," he said on local

He also said that France has played an important role in
defusing the crisis by contributing to "what is written down in
the logic of peace rather than war."

<P>
"One of the lessons drawn from the current crisis is that the
power of a nation is from now on more measured by its capacity to
propose peace, the voice of diplomacy, to avoid the war rather

<HEADLINE> Dolly's Creators Go on to Clone Calf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 23 (Xinhua) -- PPL Therapeutics, the British
company that helped to create Dolly, world's first adult clone,
announced on Monday that it has also cloned a calf.
</P>
<P>
The healthy 44.5 kg animal, called Mr Jefferson, produced by
PPL's subsidiary in American, was born in Virginia on February 16,
the company said.
</P>
<P>
The technique used to create the calf was similar to that used
to produce Dolly, but Mr Jefferson was produced by nuclear
transfer from a foetal cell, not from an adult one.
</P>
<P>
Though the calf is not transgenic, carrying no human genes, the
company said the animal's birth opened the way to producing
transgenic cows, whose milk could eventually be used to treat
disease in humans.
</P>
<P>
PPL, one of the world's leading companies in the transgenic
production of human proteins in the milk of livestock, announced
together with Scotland's Roslin Institute the successful
production of Dolly the cloned sheep exactly a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Some scientists recently claimed that Dolly might not be a
genuine clone, saying that it may not come from an adult cell at
all.
</P>
<P>
In response to these speculations. the PPL defended Monday that
the company "is confident that Dolly was produced from an adult
mammary cell."
</P>
<P>
The creation of Mr Jefferson, the company said, shows "we have
the capability to extend the technique to cattle."

AMMAN, February 23 (Xinhua) -- King Hussein of Jordan welcomed

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientific Periodicals Need Improvement, Experts Say </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Publishing houses specializing
in scientific periodicals in China were urged today to improve the
quality of their products, so that they can gain a wider audience
abroad.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that among the country's 4,386 such
periodicals, only 0.24 percent were listed in 1993 in the American
Science Quotation Index, an important reference periodical for
basic scientific studies, and the rate dropped to 0.17 percent in
1995.
</P>
<P>
To keep up with the world trend, the publishing houses in China
should try to shorten the publication period of scientific theses,
and update the information, said an official with the publicity
department of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
He said that another factor which helps more Chinese
periodicals gain readers abroad is to offer standardized English
digests and complete references for each scientific thesis
published in periodicals.
</P>
<P>
The publishing houses of scientific periodicals have begun to
focus on publishing more outstanding scientific articles both from
at home and abroad. In 1995, Chinese periodicals carried 402 papers
written by overseas scholars; in 1996 the number rose to 539.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that group companies may be more competitive than
individual publishing houses in the world market. More than 300
scientific periodicals in the Chinese Academy of Sciences as well
as 60 periodicals in the Chinese Society of Medical Sciences are
all exploring ways for co-operation.

BONN, February 24 (Xinhua) -- German Foreign Minister Klaus
Kinkel Tuesday expressed his support for continued United States
strong military presence in the Gulf region, saying it needed time
to see if Iraq would fully comply with the arms inspection accord
it signed with the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The United States was right to maintain its strong military
presence in the Gulf region, he said in an interview with
Deutschlandfunk radio.

Reaffirming his welcome to the accord on the resumption of

Annan signed Monday with Iraq, Kinkel stressed that the key test
was whether Iraq would fully implement the accord.

<P>
Kinkel also noted that the U.S. military presence in the Gulf
region had helped bring about the diplomatic solution which
averted a U.S.-led military strike against Iraq.

WASHINGTON, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government Monday
dismissed charges against two men of conspiring to possess deadly
anthrax that could be used as a weapon.
</P>
<P>
Harris and William Leavitt Jr. were arrested last Wednesday in
suburban Henderson, south of Las Vegas. Weekend tests showed the
material was actually a harmless anthrax vaccine for animals and
additional tests showed that material seized from Harris' Ohio
home also was a safe vaccine.

Lawyers for Leavitt and Harris said their clients were not
terrorists, but scientists who planned to use the anthrax vaccine
to test an unorthodox disease-killing machine from a man who
tipped of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).
</P>
<P>
Federal prosecutors said in a statement that they had to act
swiftly because of evidence suggesting the men intended to test
vials of the deadly anthrax bacteria.
</P>
<P>
Leavitt was freed, but Harris remained jailed on a new charge
filed in Columbus, Ohio, that he violated terms of his probation
for a 1995 conviction on illegally ordering freeze-dried bubonic

<HEADLINE> U.S. Records No Consumer Inflation in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The United States recorded
no monthly consumer inflation in January for the first time in
nearly four years thanks to the biggest drop in energy prices, the
Labor Department reported here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Consumer prices overall were unchanged, marking the first month
without an increase since January 1994, the department noted.
</P>
<P>
But Energy costs dropped by 2.4 percent, the largest decrease
since March 1991. They are 25 percent lower than a year ago and,
with crude oil prices still falling, they'll likely continue the
trend.
</P>
<P>
Food prices rose a moderate 0.3 percent in January, pushed up
by a 7.9 percent increase in fresh vegetables, including a 33
percent increase in lettuce.
</P>
<P>
Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, prices
climbed a modest 0.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. inflation last year was just 1.7 percent, the mildest
rate since the crash of oil prices in 1986, and economists see
little reason for the rate to move above 2 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
The major threat of inflation may come through services. Their
prices may be pushed up by rising wages stemming from shortages of
labor. However, in January, service prices rose just 0.1 percent,
while good prices declined 0.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Last month's energy decline was led by a 3.6 percent drop in
gasoline. Fuel oil and natural gas both were down 2.7 percent and
electricity, 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Declining beef, pork, poultry, fruit and coffee prices helped
moderate the big vegetable prices increase and a moderate rise in
dairy products.
</P>
<P>
Outside food and energy, clothing costs fell 0.5 percent.
Medical care and new cars and trucks rose only 0.1 percent.
However, tobacco products jumped 0.7 percent and airline fares,
2.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Communication costs, a new category, fell 0.4 percent, pulled
down by a drop in cellular phone costs. But recreation rose 0.3
percent, reflecting a 1.7 percent rise for cable television.

<HEADLINE> Iran Reiterates Bilateral Agreement on Caspian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 24 (Xinhua) -- A senior Iranian official said
here Tuesday that any bilateral agreement on the destiny of the
Caspian Sea is an "invalid act and against international norms and
regulations."
</P>
<P>
Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister for legal and international
affairs Mohammad Javad Zarif made the remarks on the eve of a
visit by Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Zarif was quoted by the Iranian official news agency as saying
that under an agreement reached earlier by the foreign ministers
of the five littoral states, the Caspian Sea legal regime can be
defined and completed through consensus of all five states
bordering the sea.
</P>
<P>
Any measure adopted by each of the Caspian Sea littoral states
should not be detrimental to other littoral states, or else it
would lack political and legal basis, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zarif said that contribution of all the littoral states to a
political dialogue coupled with good will would be the
prerequisite for a lasting agreement which guarantees balanced
and logical interests of all the states concerned.
</P>
<P>
Such an agreement is attainable and possible only by honoring
the rights and interests of all the states bordering the Caspian
Sea, he said. He called on the five littoral countries to speed up
the process to determine the legal regime for the world largest
inner-land lake.
</P>
<P>
Zarif rejected any rivalry and interference in the region by
countries which do not border the sea, saying that "the task of
forging the legal regime for the Caspian Sea rests with the
littoral states and others should not interfere in it."
</P>
<P>
He said that exploitation of the sea's natural resources could
be possible within the framework of a regime agreed upon
unanimously by all the littoral states, adding that convergence
is the only way to development and progress for the Caspian Sea
and its littoral states.
</P>
<P>
He underlined the importance to announce the Caspian sea
as a non-military zone, saying that permanent security of the sea
was tied to keeping the region a non-military zone.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi was scheduled to leave here for Moscow Tuesday
afternoon to discuss with Russian officials the latest regional
developments, especially the Iraq crisis and the Caspian Sea
legal regime.

<HEADLINE> Iran Dismisses US Dual Containment on Moscow, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi Tuesday dismissed the idea that Washington was after a
dual containment policy against Moscow and Tehran in its recent
military buildup in the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question at the opening session of the Persian Gulf
seminar, Kharrazi said that the U.S. strengthened its military
deployment in the Gulf region with the aim to resolve
Baghdad-Washington disputes over arms inspection.
</P>
<P>
The question was raised on the eve of an official visit by the
Iranian foreign minister to Moscow, which will start Tuesday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
As a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, Russia is
an important country in the region and the world, Kharrazi said,
adding that Moscow shared the same views with Tehran towards the
Iraq-U.N. crisis that it should be resolved through diplomatic
efforts instead of military measures.
</P>
<P>
Iranian press recently quoted Iranian political analysts as
saying that one of the objectives behind the U.S. military
buildup in the region is to weaken the Baghdad government in
order to change its dual containment on Iraq and Iran into a new
form on Iran and Russia.
</P>
<P>
As a long-term strategy, foreign diplomats here also said,
Washington's military buildup in the region could be interpreted
as an extension of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization eastward
expansion aiming at containing both Moscow and Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Russia and Iran showed their strong opposition to a possible
U.S. military strike on Iraq if diplomatic efforts failed to
persuade Iraq to give full access to U.N. weapons inspectors.

<HEADLINE> US Religious Delegation Holds Talks with Tibetan Clergy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The visiting US religious
leaders had a conversation here this afternoon with local
religious figures on issues of common interest.
</P>
<P>
The US delegation includes Rabbi Arthur Schneier, president of
the Appeal of Conscience Foundation of the United States,
Archbishop Theodore McCarrick of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of
Newark, and the Rev. Don Argue, president of the National
Association of Evangelicals.
</P>
<P>
Living Buddha Jiare Lobsang Danzim, deputy director of the
Ethnic and Religious Affairs Committee of the Tibet Autonomous
Region, briefed the visitors on the situation of religion in
Tibet.
</P>
<P>
He told the visitors that there are more than 1,600 temples
and other religious sites, and over 46,000 monks and nuns in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
McCarrick said the Tibetan visit had special significance for
him, as it is the first time an archbishop of the Roman Catholic
Church has visited the region.
</P>
<P>
Schneier and his companions showed concern about the severe
snowstorm in northern Tibet, and said that he hoped they could
provide some aid to the area.
</P>
<P>
Requested by the visitors to make a comment on the Dalai Lama,
Living Buddha Cemolin Danzengchilie said, "I have faith in the
Dalai Lama as a religious figure, but I object to his
activities overseas aimed at splitting the motherland."
</P>
<P>

met with the US religious leaders here tonight.

<HEADLINE> US Religious Delegation Visits Potala Palace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- A delegation of US religious
figures today visited the Potala Palace and the Jokhang Temple in
this capital of the Tibet Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Included in the delegation are Rabbi Arthur Schneier, president
of the Appeal of Conscience Foundation of the United States,
Archbishop Theodore McCarrick of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of
Newark and the Rev. Don Argue, president of the National
Association of Evangelicals.
</P>
<P>
A guide told the visitors at the fifth Dalai Lama's Soul Pagoda
in the the 117-m-high Potala Palace that the fifth Dalai Lama,
famous in Tibetan history, traveled to Beijing in 1652 for a
meeting with Emperor Shunzhi of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911).
</P>
<P>
The Soul Pagoda, where the remains of the fifth Dalai Lama are
preserved, is coated in 3,720 kg of gold.
</P>
<P>
Coins from various countries placed at the foot of the pagoda
are donations from tourists and religious believers and intended
to maintain the palace.
</P>
<P>
Schneier donated a new designed 100-US-dollar note to the
palace, and said that donation and sharing are good things in
Judaism and Christianity.
</P>
<P>
It is the same in Buddhism, the guide told him.
</P>
<P>
The palace is divided into two parts: the Red Palace, where the
Soul Pagodas of the various Dalai Lamas and halls for worshiping
Buddha are located; and the White Palace, where the Dalai Lamas
lived and conducted political affairs.
</P>
<P>
After walking around the Potala Palace for more than one hour,
the US visitors came to a lounge where an inscription written by
President Jiang Zemin during his visit in 1990 is suspended from
the ceiling. The inscription encourages all people to maintain
ethnic unity and carry forward ethnic culture.
</P>
<P>
A manager of the palace told the visitors that the central
government of China pays great attention to protecting cultural
relics in Tibet, and has earmarked 53 million yuan (about 6.4
million US dollars) to maintain the palace.
</P>
<P>
Schneier wondered whether any Tibetans were involved in the
maintenance of the palace. The man answered that such work is
mostly done by local Tibetans, as well as experts and technicians
from China's State Bureau of Cultural Relics.
</P>
<P>
About 20,000 foreign tourists visit the Potala Palace each
year, in addition to a large number of worshippers, he added.
</P>
<P>
The US visitors then went to the Jokhang Temple.
</P>
<P>
As the Tibetan new year is approaching, the square in front of
the temple was crowded with a large number of worshippers. The US
visitors recorded the scene with ordinary cameras and video
cameras.
</P>
<P>
The temple, one of earliest buildings constructed in Tibet,
preserves a host of valuable cultural relics, including a statue
of Sakyamuni taken there by Princess Wencheng of the Tang Dynasty
(618-907).
</P>
<P>
The US visitors took pictures of the statue with the permission
of the temple management.
</P>
<P>
Nema Tsering, deputy director of management committee of the
temple, told the visitors in English that 115 lamas chant
scriptures at night because they are busy running the temple duing
the daytime.
</P>
<P>
The US delegation visited Beijing, Nanjing and Shanghai before
they went to Lhasa.

<HEADLINE> Singapore PM Stresses Importance of Stable Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Prime Minister Goh
Chok Tong stressed Tuesday evening the importance of the relations
between Singapore and its neighbors and said that Singapore should
help them to overcome their difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Singapore Malay Chamber of Commerce and
Industry Annual Fast-Breaking Festival Dinner, Goh said that the
political stability and economic health in the neighboring
countries are of "crucial importance" to Singapore.
</P>
<P>
The close and long-standing bilateral relations Singapore has
with Indonesia and Malaysia go beyond economics to include the
strategic, political, environmental, social and cultural areas, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"But because our interests are intertwined, problems in one
country would definitely affect the other. In short, our
relationship with Indonesia is indivisible, as is our relationship
with Malaysia," the prime minister stated.
</P>
<P>
Hence, he said, "it is neither possible nor right for us to
close our eyes or fold our arms and ignore the problems of our
neighbors. A stable and secure neighborhood is in the interests of
Singapore. We shall help our neighbors to overcome their
difficulties where we can."

<HEADLINE> Kuwait to Set up Refineries in Europe, Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait will establish
refineries in Europe and Asia with a separate capacity of 300,000
barrels and 400,000 barrels per day (bpd) by the year 2000, Kuwait
News Agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Bahrain Oil and Gas News Magazine
which was published Tuesday, Kuwaiti Minister of Oil Issa
Mohammed Al-Mazidi said that Kuwait also plans to gradually expand
its marketing operations to sell 500,000 bpd of petroleum products
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
"To achieve our objectives, we are considering all sorts of
options including strategic alliances or cooperation in joint
venture projects," he said.
</P>
<P>
The state-owned conglomerate Kuwait Petroleum Corporation plans
to enter joint ventures to build and operate refineries in
India, Pakistan and Thailand, he added.
</P>
<P>
The company's long-term strategy aims to upgrade three
local refineries to reach a capacity of more than 1 million bpd
from the present 855,000 bpd.
</P>
<P>
Oil refining in the three refineries realized an increase of
about 8 percent in 1997 over the previous year, an unprecedented
record in the refineries' operations, according to official
figures.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the oil production, Al-Mazidi said "Kuwait intends
to raise production from 2.19 million bpd to 2.5 million bpd by
the end of the decade, and to 3 million bpd by the year 2005."

<HEADLINE> Beijing Seminars Commemorate Zhou Enlai Anniversary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Several seminars were held in
Beijing today to mark the 100th anniversary of the birth of the
late Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai.
</P>
<P>
At the seminar convened by the General Office of the State
Council, some veterans who had worked with Zhou recollected his
stature as a great man and his hard-working spirit as a public
servant.
</P>
<P>
Luo Gan, secretary-general of the State Council, told the
seminar that the personal integrity and charm of Zhou Enlai are a
valuable legacy for later generations, especially in the new
historical period of building a socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
He called on the departments under the General Office to seize
the opportunity of commemorating Zhou Enlai to build industrious,
honest and efficient government organs.
</P>
<P>
The United Front Work Department of the Communist Party of
China (CPC) Central Committee organized a seminar to commemorate
Zhou, inviting people from non-Communist parties, the All-China
Federation of Industry and Commerce, personages with no party
affiliation and intellectuals.
</P>
<P>
Participants in the seminar noted that Zhou was the pioneer and
outstanding figure of the country's united front work. His
thinking and practice not only served as guidelines for such work
in his own time, but remain of great significance nowadays.
</P>
<P>
Despite the drastic changes in the situation and tasks which
China faces, Zhou Enlai's thinking, style of work and personal
integrity will inspire people throughout the country to advance
along the path of building a modern socialist country, the
participants said.
</P>
<P>
Peng Peiyun, state councillor and director of the State Family
Planning Commission, joined nearly 100 other population
specialists and workers in charge of family planning to
commemorate Zhou Enlai's contribution to the country's population
control work.
</P>
<P>
At a seminar held by the Office of Overseas Chinese Affairs
under the State Council, Guo Dongpo, director of the office,
called on those in charge of work connected with overseas Chinese
to learn from Zhou Enlai's lofty morality and study his
instructions on overseas Chinese affairs.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, units of the People's Liberation Army and the
People's Armed Police have held various activities over the past
few days to commemorate the late Premier.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Soccer Officials Direct "Farce" in Training Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, Yunnan Province, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese
soccer officials orchestrated a "farce" on Tuesday by preventing
reporters and fans from a special national flag-raising ceremony
in the Haigeng soccer training camp, some 20 kilometers away from
the provincial capital.
</P>
<P>
The flag was raised by Wang Jinyao and Cheng Jie, members of
the special detachment holding the daily flag-raising ceremony in
Tiananmen Square, which has become a must-see for tourists.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Football Association (CFA) held the ceremony as a
patriotism gesture to boost the morale of the Chinese soccer
players who are still seeking for their debut in the World Cup
finals.
</P>
<P>
Yet, some 40 reporters and fans who hurried from downtown
Kunming in the early morning were shut out from the gateline of
the training camp.
</P>
<P>
"No reason. But you are not allowed in," a CFA official said
in an arrogant tone to the reporters who showed him their
certificates of news coverage.
</P>
<P>
Another CFA official explained that the blockade was to prevent
the ceremony from being disturbed, while no incident of the kind
was ever triggered off in Tiananmen Square where hundreds of
people attended every morning, and even tens of thousands on
holidays in the flag-raising ceremony.
</P>
<P>
"It should been an honorable moment. But why do those officials
tried to make mystery of it? " a fan said in anger.
</P>
<P>
Haigeng is the training center for the Chinese national soccer
team and all the squads in Division A and B leagues during their
off-season periods.
</P>
<P>
This was the second time that the door was closed to the public
after the CFA even resorted to police dogs to prevent any outsider
in the spring of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The CFA was one of the richest sports associations in China,
yet its men footballers failed to make any impact in the
international arena while incidents of "hooligan" were reported
time and again with its most honored player involved.
</P>
<P>
Fan Zhiyi, the two-time national footballer, was caught of
punching his fan who cried for a signature in January, and kicked
the butt of his Japanese opponent on Monday in the inaugural Far
East Soccer Club Championships on his home turf in Shanghai.

<HEADLINE> UNHCR Head Urges to Solve Refugee Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The visiting United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), Sadako Ogata
Tuesday called on all countries to work together to solve the
refugee problem in the world.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing here, Ogata said refugee problem
cannot be solved unilaterally and it needs all countries to work
together for it.
</P>
<P>
She said, "unless asylum countries take responsibilities for
the refugee problem, it will be very difficult to the UNHCR alone
to solve it."
</P>
<P>
She said that two major problems in this regard are refugees
being expelled by asylum countries and refugees carrying out
insurgency activities in asylum countries.
</P>
<P>
"These twin problems have to be addressed more seriously and
compatible arrangements should be sought to tackle them," she
noted.
</P>
<P>
Ogata is currently on a nine-nation African tour.
</P>
<P>
Talking on her current visit to Africa, she said the purpose
of her mission is to listen to the concerns of leaders,
particularly those in the Great Lakes region, where UNHCR
continues to be involved in major operations for Rwandan and
Burundian refugees and returnee.
</P>
<P>
She said that she had explored ways of promoting greater
adherence to humanitarian principles and refugee conventions.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR commissioner arrived here Sunday for a four-day
visit to Ethiopia which is the last leg of her nine-nation
African tour.
</P>
<P>
The other eight countries are Zimbabwe, Tanzania, Burundi,
Rwanda, Kenya, Uganda, the Democratic Republic of Congo and the

<HEADLINE> EU to Tighten Control Over Outdoor Noise Level </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Gardeners may soon have to be
careful in choosing when to mow their lawns and buying their
machines as the European Union decided Tuesday to tighten controls
on outdoor noise levels.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the executive agency of the 15-nation
union, proposed to the European Parliament and the EU Council of
Ministers to regulate the noise emission of equipment used
outdoors.
</P>
<P>
The equipment in question includes construction machinery such
as cranes, excavators, hammers, loaders and compressors as well as
gardening machines such as lawnmowers, chainsaws, leaf blowers and
shredders.
</P>
<P>
If the parliament and council pass the proposal, the new
legislation will update and replace the nine current stipulations
covering separate groups of machines.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the proposal is to protect the health and well-being
of citizens by reducing exposure to noise and the nuisance caused
by outdoor machinery.
</P>
<P>
An essential element of the proposal is to recommend that
machines are marked with their maximum noise emission level,
thereby enabling buyers to make an informed choice.
</P>
<P>
The commission's proposal for legislation on outdoor noise
emission covers 55 types of equipment.
</P>
<P>
The proposal also defines noise test codes, as the noise limit
values are essentially based on the way noise emissions are
measured.

<HEADLINE> Trade Surplus Up, Real Export and Import Down in Skorea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 24 (Xinhua) -- South Korea enjoyed a trade
surplus of 1.51 billion U.S. dollars last month, despite its
serious financial crisis, said the Customs administration
department on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In January, exports edged up 0.3 percent from 9.034 billion
U.S. dollars thanks largely to export of gold worth 683 million
dollars. Imports stood at 7.554 billion dollars, a drop of 39.6
percent.
</P>
<P>
However, without gold exports, January would have seen a 7.2
percent or 650-million-dollar export decline from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
South Korea suffered a trade deficit of 3.476 billion dollars
in January 1997.
</P>
<P>
South Korea is in the grip of a financial crisis triggered by
corporate failures and bad loans in late 1997.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Journalists Encouraged to Uncover Environmental Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Qu Geping, chairman of the
Environmental and Resources Protection Committee (ERPC) of China's
National People's Congress, has asked journalists to faithfully
report the country's environmental problems.
</P>
<P>
Qu said at an environmental protection meeting here today that
supervision must be enhanced to guarantee the effective
implementation of the laws, and media supervision is an important
complement to the judicial supervision of the National People's
Congress.
</P>
<P>
He said that the press should voice the public's concerns and
demands. "Pollution infringes upon the people's interests and
impairs their health," Qu stressed.
</P>
<P>
China's environmental situation is serious, and the
deterioration of the environment has not yet been curbed. The area
affected by acid rain accounts for about 28 percent of the
country's total.
</P>
<P>
In addition, nearly half of the country's seven major rivers
are polluted. Groundwater in urban areas is also contaminated
seriously.
</P>
<P>
China has promulgated 15 laws concerning environmental and
resources protection over the past decade. However, Qu said, some
of them have not been effectively implemented.
</P>
<P>
The ERPC has organized more than 6,000 reporters to cover the
country's major environmental problems over the past five years,
and they have dispatched more than 40,000 environmental news
reports, which have contributed to the settlement of some of the
problems.

approved a humanitarian aid package to Iraq after its agreement of
a weapons inspection deal with the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The aid package, worth 10 million ECU (10.8 million U.S.
dollars), brings the total EU humanitarian aid to Iraq since 1991
to 217.67 million ECU.
</P>
<P>
The aid, managed by EU's European Community Humanitarian
Office, will enable humanitarian organizations from six European
countries to carry out a coordinated program over the next 10
months.
</P>
<P>
The aid program will focus on support for malnourished
children, assistance to victims of landmines, renovation of water
supplies, and the repair of hospitals, water and sanitation
services.
</P>
<P>
There will also be support for children in special institutions
for the handicapped and orphans.
</P>
<P>
The EU humanitarian office said that it would continue
monitoring humanitarian needs in Iraq and intended to re-evaluate
the situation in the country later this year.
</P>
<P>
EU foreign ministers, who met on Monday, agreed to support the
weapons inspection deal reached between United Nations
Secretary-General Kofi Annan and the Iraqi authorities.

The 15-nation union supported efforts to find a diplomatic
solution to the crisis.

<HEADLINE> 200 Zanzibar Residents Plan Pilgrimage to Mecca </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Some 200 Moslems in the
Zanzibar isles plan to go on a pilgrimage to the holy city of
Mecca in Saudi Arabia, media reports said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A government official dealing with Islamic affairs in the
isles, Abdallah Talib, told reporters Monday that the number has
shot up from 150 last year.
</P>
<P>
Each pilgrim has to pay 1.1 million shillings (about 1,680
U.S. Dollars) for the trip, compared with 990,448 shillings last
year, Talib said, noting that the price will cover air tickets,
visa charges, and other services to be rendered in Mecca.
</P>
<P>
The official attributed the price rise to the increased
accommodation costs in Mecca.
</P>
<P>
The government will soon appoint an official to lead the
pilgrims, he said. The pilgrims will board an Ethiopian Airlines
aircraft on March 18, and are expected to return home in early
April.
</P>
<P>
Before departure, a three-day course will be held to teach the
pilgrims necessary knowledge for the trip.
</P>
<P>
Around 95 percent of the residents in Zanzibar, which has a
population of more than 700,000, are Moslems.

PARIS, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading French newspapers Tuesday:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- For the first time good sense in the cruel cycle of
international relations has won. Bombing Iraq would aggravate the
situation in the region without dispelling American fear about
Iraqi armaments. The pursuit of UNSCOM inspections will control
the military intentions of Saddam Hussein without
bloodshed. However, without the U.S. military build-up in the Gulf
and without the warnings by Clinton, a compromise between the
U.N. and Iraq would be impossible.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- Regardless of whether the Iraqi crisis is solved through
bombing or through signing an agreement, the unbelievable
tenacity of Saddam Hussein always remains a headache for
Washington. Although the U.S. has spent millions of dollars in
supporting Iraqi dissidents and Kurdish rebels and has organized a
clandestine attack in Baghdad, all these efforts have come to no
avail so far.

scored 20 more points than that in the World Championships last
January," said coach Zhang Ting.
</P>
<P>
"As many a country failed to send in their top divers for the
event, we encouraged Tian to compete against himself to improve
his own skills," the coach said.
</P>
<P>
Another Chinese teenager Yang Jinghui, 14, took the silver
medal with 579.65 points in his international debut.
</P>
<P>
"Yang is budding star with great potential, and can hopefully
make his impact in the world arena in two years," said judge Xuan
Zengyong.
</P>
<P>
The bronze medal was won by Rueda Eduardo of Mexico with 540.70
points.
</P>
<P>
In the day's last finals of the women's 3-meter springboard,
the 16-year-old Zhang Jing edged over her Chinese compatriot Li
Rongjuan for the top honour, while Michell Chantelle of Australia
took the bronze medal with 510.35 points.
</P>
<P>
"Zhang became the eventual winner due to her tough mentality
and great flexibility, she also enjoyed upperhands in her
jumping," said her coach Liu Henglin.
</P>
<P>
Zhang scored a total of 547.25 points, while Li settled for the
silver with 544.90 points.
</P>
<P>
Less than 60 divers from Australian, Germany, Japan, Mexico and
China competed in the Diving Grand Prix with six gold medals at
stake.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the competition, coaches from Australia, Japan and
Mexico acknowledged that their divers only aimed to accumulate
international experiences instead of cherishing any hope to win
any gold from their Chinese rivals.

<HEADLINE> New Contract Scheme for Sri Lankan Housemaids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Bureau of Foreign
Employment has introduced a new standard employment contract
scheme for women migrant workers who have secured employment
through personal contacts, the bureau said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The scheme requires every Sri Lankan who's going overseas to
work as housemaid to register with the Sri Lankan mission abroad.
</P>
<P>
The bureau said the new employment contract scheme would become
mandatory from March 1.
</P>
<P>
Under the scheme, a foreign sponsor should sign an agreement
with the Sri Lankan mission in the host country to guarantee that
the foreign party would abide by all obligations with regard to
rights of the Sri Lankan working for him or her.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the overseas job seeker is also expected to submit
documents to prove that she has been registered with the
respective mission abroad.
</P>
<P>
Overseas employment has become one of the major sources to
bring in foreign exchanges for Sri Lanka. Remittances sent back by
those working overseas each year could exceed 797 million U.S.
dollars, according to figures given by the bureau.
</P>
<P>
A total of 115,000 Sri Lankans obtained overseas jobs during
the first ten months last year. About 710,000 Sri Lankans are
employed in the Middle East and other Asian regions at present.

<HEADLINE> Forum Mulls Zhou Enlai's Diplomatic Ideas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Some 100 senior diplomats,
generals and experts on international issues gathered here today
at a forum to discuss the diplomatic ideas of the late Chinese
Premier Zhou Enlai.
</P>
<P>
Zhou was a great revolutionary, politician, military strategist
and an outstanding diplomat.
</P>
<P>
At the forum, Xiong Guangkai, deputy chief of General Staff of
the People's Liberation Army, said that Zhou Enlai was the founder
of the diplomatic work of New China.
</P>
<P>
He said that Zhou from 1949 to 1976 made remarkable
contributions to China's diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
He said that Zhou's efforts raised China's status in the world,
adding that his diplomatic ideas and practice are well worth
studying.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the China Society of Administrative
Management also held a forum to commemorate the 100th anniversary
of Zhou's birth.
</P>
<P>
The forum focussed on Zhou's work at Zhongnanhai, the
headquarters of the Chinese government, in the 26 years
from 1949 to 1976.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in north China's Tianjin City, about 200,000 people

<HEADLINE> Africa Remains Major Supplier of Cannabis: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Cannabis is illicitly
cultivated in many African countries and Africa remains a major
supplier of cannabis and cannabis resin to Europe and North
America.
</P>
<P>
An annual report distributed here Tuesday said that South
Africa, Morocco and Senegal are large producers of cannabis in
the African continent.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, 38.5 tons of cannabis and 65 tons of cannabis resin,
destined for black markets in Europe, were seized by Moroccan law
enforcement services, said the report compiled by the
International Narcotics Control Board (INCB).
</P>
<P>
It noted that large amounts of cannabis were produced in
Western Africa with Senegal reportedly introducing new hybrid
cannabis varieties which had a higher tetrahydrocannabinol
content than the local varieties.
</P>
<P>
African seaports are frequently used by illicit traffickers
for the trans-shipment of cannabis resin from Asia to Europe or
North America, it added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the report said, cannabis is also the main drug of
abuse in Africa and widespread cannabis abuse has been reported
in every subregion in the continent.
</P>
<P>
INCB President, Hamid Ghodse stressed that efforts to reduce
drug abuse worldwide would be less effective if demand reduction
programs are undermined by advocacy for the legalization of
drugs.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the fashion industry coined the term "heroin
chic" and certain pop starts have made statements, saying that
the recreational use of drugs is a normal and acceptable part of
a person's lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
Powerful pressure groups run political campaigns aimed at
legalizing controlled drugs, he said.
</P>
<P>
A special session of the U.N. General Assembly on
international drug control will be held in June this year to
adopt an international declaration on the guiding principles on
drug demand reduction, Ghodse announced in the message.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Growth Rate Fell to 1.7% in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 24 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's economic
growth rate last year was 1.7 percent after a 3.2 percent growth
in 1996, Central Statistical Services (CSS) announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
CSS attributed the decline to the sharp decrease in average
annual growth rate of the agricultural sector from 29.1 percent
in 1996 to -1.0 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
It said the agriculture growth rate was high in 1996 because
the comparison year, 1995, was unusually low. The real annual
growth rate in the GDP of the non-agricultural sector was 1.9
percent for 1997, which was the same as the previous year.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Follows Iraq-UN Accord with Concern, Relief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait said Tuesday it is
following with concern and relief the agreement struck by U.N.
Secretary General Kofi Annan and the Iraqi leadership averting an
U.S. military action in the region.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait Minister of State for Cabinet Affairs Abdelaziz Dakheel
Al-Dakheel said after an extraordinary cabinet meeting Tuesday
that he hopes that Iraq would not go on challenging the
international will and implement the reached accord, adding that
agreement would spare the Iraqi people and region the
repercussions and impacts of military action.
</P>
<P>
He also praised the role of the United Nations in avoiding the
region a military action, saying that the agreement resembles a
victory for the international organization and for its sublime
principles.
</P>
<P>
The U.N.-Iraq agreement signed by Annan and Iraqi Deputy Prime
Minister Tariq Aziz Monday morning give a full access of the
U.N. arms inspectors without time limit to all sites in the Iraq
suspected of hiding weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Al-Dakheel also reiterated Kuwait's stand to secure Iraq's
serious and full compliance with its commitments to implement all
U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
He called for the world community to pressure Iraq on
"releasing Kuwait's prisoners of war and detainees, upholding
threats to neighbors, confidence building and good neighborly
ties, in a manner that leads to establishing peace in the region
and enabling its people to enjoy security and stability."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, most Kuwaiti residents, while breathing a sigh of
relief at the agreement, think the crisis and threat would remain
and may flare up again as long as Saddam Hussein remains in
power. Seven years ago, Kuwait was liberated from the seven-month
Iraqi occupation of the country.
</P>
<P>
However, many of Kuwait's foreign residents who account for 65
percent of the 2.2 million population are relieved after weeks of
tension and fear of Iraqi retaliatory attacks with chemical and
biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
The more than 5000 U.S. and British troops and 12 F-117A
stealth fighter bombers and eight Tornado war planes are expected
to remain in Kuwait for months despite the accord reached, defense
sources said.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait Interior Ministry's Director of Public Relations Badr
Al-Saleh also declared Tuesday "the security precautions will be
maintained" in the country.

Committees to give legal advice to prospective candidates if they
have doubts about their eligibility to run for the April subsector
elections or the May general elections.
</P>
<P>
Turning to arrangements on the polling day, Woo said that a
combined polling arrangement would be adopted.
</P>
<P>
"All electors, except the 800 members of the Election
Committee, may cast all their votes at a polling station near
their homes on May 24," he said.

BEIJING, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Li Ruihuan, chairman of the
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC), met here this afternoon with Chinese and
Japanese delegates to the seventh meeting of the China-Japan
Friendship Exchange.
</P>
<P>
Li expressed his respects and sincere gratitude to all those
who have contributed to the development of Sino-Japanese friendly
relations.
</P>
<P>
China and Japan, two close neighbors separated by only a strip
of water, have had contacts with each other for centuries, he
said. The two nations have, since the normalization of diplomatic
ties 25 years ago, witnessed a vigorous growth of communication
and cooperation in various fields, including politics, economy,
culture and sports.
</P>
<P>
Both efforts by friendship groups and the general public, and
special promotion via nongovernmental exchanges in Japan are
responsible for the present healthy state of the relations, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the Chinese government and people value the
friendly ties which have been hard-earned, and hold that their
development and consolidation conform to the interests of the two
countries as well as having great significance for peace and
stability in Asia and world at large.
</P>
<P>
As long as both sides face history squarely while looking to
the future, and make joint efforts, China and Japan will surely
continue their friendship from generation to generation, Li said.

Masao Shimizu, chairman of the Japanese delegation and
vice-president of the Japan-China Friendship Association (JCFA),

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Meets Irish Foreign Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng said
that it is wise for the European Union (EU) not to present an
anti-China bill this year and China appreciates the EU's attitude
toward strengthening dialogue and cooperation with China.
</P>
<P>
Li made the remark in a meeting with Irish Foreign Minister
David Andrews who arrived here this morning for a four-day
official visit to China as guest of Chinese Vice-Premier and
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen.
</P>
<P>
Li said that China has always attached importance to its
relations with the EU which is an important group in a
multi-polarized world. The two sides share common interests in
safeguarding world peace and promoting common development, he
added.
</P>
<P>
China will -- on the basis of mutual respect, equality and
reciprocity -- make its efforts to further its relations with all
EU member countries including Ireland, and expand cooperation in
various fields between the two sides, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Andrews recalled his visit to China as head of a football team
in 1976 when China was undergoing difficulties, saying that he has
found that great changes have taken place in China in the past 22
years.
</P>
<P>
He said his current visit here is aimed at revealing the
sincere hopes of the new Irish government to further its friendly
relations with China, and informing China of an important decision
made by the just-concluded council meeting of EU foreign ministers.
</P>
<P>
Andrews told Li that the council agreed that neither the
presidency nor member states should table or co-sponsor a draft
resolution against China at the next session of the
U.N. Commission on Human Rights, adding EU members' satisfaction
with the encouraging results acquired during dialogues between the
EU and China on human rights, which Li expressed his appreciation.
</P>
<P>
Li said that he and the former Irish Prime Minister agreed to
further bilateral relations in their meeting in Rome during the
World Food Summit in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Andrews' current visit to China as the first cabinet member of
the new Irish government indicates the significance the Irish
government attaches to the development of bilateral relations, Li
said.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that since China and Ireland established
diplomatic ties in 1979, the two sides have conducted fruitful
cooperation in politics, economy and trade, science and
technology, and culture, and bilateral trade volume has increased
steadily.
</P>
<P>
China welcomes more cooperation between enterprises of the two
countries, and the Chinese government will give its due support
and encouragement, Li said.

<HEADLINE> Yemeni Daily Hails Iraq-UN Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANAA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- A Yemeni government-run
newspaper on Tuesday hailed as a triumph of the civilized world
the agreement on arms inspections reached between Iraq and the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The agreement embodies a peaceful solution to the standoff
between Iraq and the U.N. Special Commission charged with
overseeing the elimination of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction,
the Al-Thawra said in an editorial.
</P>
<P>
It implies a victory of the international legitimacy and world
peace because a diplomatic solution to the Iraqi crisis is a gain
for all the members of the international community, the paper
added.
</P>
<P>
After two days of intense talks, U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan and Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz signed the
agreement on Monday, under which Iraq will open all sites to
U.N. inspection.
</P>
<P>
Al-Thawra stressed that political and diplomatic efforts are
ideal means and have proved successful in resolving international
disputes, however complicated and difficult they may be.
</P>
<P>
The Iraq-U.N. agreement will spare the Middle East a disaster,
and meet the legitimate demands of the concerned parties, it added.
</P>
<P>
The United States has vowed that it would attack Iraq if
diplomacy failed to persuade Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to
back down from the decision to bar the arms inspectors from
entering presidential sites.
</P>
<P>
The paper called on the U.N. to lift, as soon as Iraq has fully
complied with the relevant U.N. resolutions, the economic
sanctions imposed on Iraq in 1990 after its invasion of Kuwait.

JERUSALEM, February 24 (Xinhua) -- United States President

Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz in Baghdad on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to Foreign Ministry staff, Netanyahu said he was
confident that Clinton would ensure the conditions the U.S. had
set for the U.N. weapons inspection in Iraq would be applied in
the agreement. He said he was also assured that the Americans
would make sure that the agreement fulfilled to enable peace and
stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
Israel, which has been nervously observing the U.S.-Iraqi
standoff in the past weeks, breathed a sigh of relief Monday
following the signing of the Annan-Aziz agreement. But Israeli
leaders cautioned that preparation for Iraqi attack should
continue because the Gulf crisis could recur at any time.
</P>

On Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, Netanyahu said he was not
waiting for the Iraqi crisis to pass and the two sides have been
holding contacts to advance the process.
</P>
<P>
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators held a meeting in the West
Bank city Jericho on Monday, agreeing to hold regular meetings to
discuss the interim issues, including the Gaza airport, Gaza
seaport, industrial park and safe passage between West Bank and
Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
The joint negotiating teams, led separately by Israeli Cabinet
Secretary Danny Naveh and senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb
Erekat will continue the interim negotiations late Tuesday at the

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 24 (Xinhua) -- South Africa Tuesday
hailed the news that United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan
had reached an agreement with the Iraqi government over U.N.
weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Foreign Affairs said in a statement that
"the South African government has expressed its delight at news
of the success of U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan's mission to
Baghdad, aimed at ending the potentially extremely dangerous
stand-off on the the issue of weapons inspections."
</P>
<P>
"This achievement represents a triumph of reason and
diplomacy," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, President Nelson Mandela also expressed relief at the
diplomatic solution to the standoff in Baghdad over U.N. weapons
inspections.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at his residence in Cape Town, Mandela said, "I'm
very happy that it does appear that the (Gulf) tension that was
building up is now going to be eliminated."
</P>
<P>
Annan arrived in Baghdad last Friday in a "last-ditch" effort
to settle the Iraqi crisis and avert a U.S. military strike
against Iraq to force its opening up of all suspected weapons
sites to inspection.
</P>
<P>
Following a series of "difficult" talks, Annan successfully
persuaded the Iraqi leadership to comply with U.N. resolutions and
grant U.N. inspectors free and full access to all sites without
time limits.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Air Force Bombs Rebel Defense Line </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Ground attack aircraft of the
Sri Lanka Air Force successfully bombed the defense line of the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) north of Mankulam,
Northern province, Tuesday morning, Military Spokesman Ink Dewage
said.
</P>
<P>
Dewage said the strike took place around 10:30 in the morning
along the rebel defense line parallel to the Mankulam-Olumadu
Road.
</P>
<P>
He didn't mention how many fighter planes were involved in the
strike.
</P>
<P>
Following the bombing, Mi-24 helicopter gunships engaged the
rebels at the defense line in the area, he added.
</P>
<P>
No casualties have been reported so far.
</P>
<P>
Mankulam lies some 43 kilometers north of Vavuniya, where
government troops started Operation Jayasikuru (Certain of
Victory) last may to capture the Vavuniya-Kilinochchi Road, which
connects the Jaffna peninsula to the south.
</P>
<P>
The 32-kilometer road between Mankulam and Kilinochchi and the
jungle areas on both sides of the road are under control of the
rebels.Previously the military said only 20 kilometers of the
road were left untaken by the army.
</P>
<P>
The military expects intense rebel resistance as they mount
their offensives against the rebel-held defense lines near
Mankulam. Currently the troops are only about two kilometers away
from the town.

<HEADLINE> Nearly 9,400 Iraqis Die in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 7,000 Iraqi children
below 5 and about 2,400 elderly died last month due to diseases
partly caused by harsh international economic sanctions, the Iraqi
News Agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to an Iraqi Health Ministry report, the children
mainly died of diarrhea, pleurisy and malnutrition, while the
elderly died of hypertension, diabetes and tumors.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed the deaths to the lack of food and
medicine owing to the sanctions imposed on Iraq by the United
Nations in 1990 after Iraqi troops' invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. embargo bars Iraq from exporting oil, the main revenue
earner. In December, 1996, the U.N. allowed Iraq to sell 2 billion
U.S. dollars worth of oil every six months under an oil-for-food
deal, to buy food and medicine, but the plan can hardly meet the
needs.
</P>
<P>
Previous statistics of the Iraqi ministry showed that more than
1.5 million Iraqis, mostly children and elderly, have died since
the sanctions began.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi report said that only 389 children and 277 elderly
died in January, 1989.

<HEADLINE> Communist Manifesto Continues to Guide Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The Communist Manifesto with its
spirit and vitality continues to light the revolutionary road and
renewal process in Vietnam, the Nhan Dan daily said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In an editorial to mark the 150th anniversary of the Communist
Manifesto, the national daily of the Communist Party described the
document, written by Karl Marx in February 1848, as the banner for
emancipation.
</P>
<P>
The editorial said that Marxism with the Communist Manifesto as
its ideological foundation achieved a new importance under Lenin
during the period of imperialism on "the eve of proletarian
revolution."
</P>
<P>
Receiving the scientific methodology of the Communist Manifesto
and Marxism-Leninism, the Communist Party of Vietnam and late
president Ho Chi Minh had persistently pursued the line of
national liberation and developed a socialist country, it said.
</P>
<P>
Learning from the experience of Vietnam's revolution over the
past 70 years and other revolutions in the world, the Communist
Party of Vietnam must take Marxism-Leninism and Ho Chi Minh's
thoughts as the ideological foundation and lodestar of its
activities to continue the renewal process, the editorial noted.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Restores Pre-Shipment Inspection on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has suspended the abolition
of pre-shipment inspection on imports it announced earlier this year,
in a fresh effort to check abuses of the liberailized economic
policies.
</P>
<P>
Disclosing the new policy decision in the captal Abuja on Monday,
Finance Minister Anthony Ani said that all goods, irrespective of
their ports of origin, should continue to undergo pre-shipment
inspection.
</P>
<P>
The government earlier abolished pre-shipment inspection on
imported goods from Australia, Bangladesh, Cyprus, Britain, Hong
Kong, Indonesia, Ireland, Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand, Pakistan,
China, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and all countries in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
Probably to comfort foreign trade businessmen, Ani also announced
that the government will bear the cost of pre-shipment inspection
services this time.
</P>
<P>
The restoration of the services, according to Ani, was informed by
the fact that some unscrupulous Nigerians and their foreign
collaborators had taken advantage of the government's good intention
toward facilitating clearance of goods to perpetrate capital flight.
</P>
<P>
They just forged papers to get foreign exchange from the
government-control exchange market at a rate a one U.S.Dollar to 75
Naira and sold at non-official market for 84 Naira, making easy money.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the government had to supply 800 million dollars to
meet the "steep rise" in the demand at the official foreign exchange
market during the first four or five weeking biddings this year,
according to the minister.
</P>
<P>
"It is most unacceptable. The government has, therefore, decided that
with effect from now, we have to go back to pre-shipment inspection,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government has also issued fresh guidelines for the
official exchange market known as autonomous foreign exchange market
(AFEM), where the Central Bank sells exchange to selected commercial
banks through a weekly bidding.
</P>
<P>
The fresh move is aimed to curb foreign exchange abuses being
perpetrated by slippery businessmen, dealers and bankers.
</P>
<P>
As part of the measures, all bills of collection, which are
arrangements whereby importers are given a grace period of few months
before funding their imports, will be funded through free fund market
instead of through AFEM.
</P>
<P>
The exchange rate at free fund market is higher than that at AFEM.
</P>
<P>
According to analysts, tightening exchange control might help
protect the country's foreign exchange reserve and curb unscrupulous
businessmen to make easy money by taking advantage of the liberalized
policy environment.
</P>
<P>
However, the re-introduction of the pre-shipment inspection
services is expected to invite complaining from genuine importers and
exporters although the government has promised to bear the cost.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, February 24 (Xinhua) -- A total of 41 million
visitors have passed through the Lei Feng Memorial Hall since
it was built 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Lei Feng was a model Chinese soldier who died in an accident at
the age of 23 in 1965. The hall is located in Fushun, in northeast
China's Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
Lei Feng became famous for his selfless care for others and
his readiness to help the needy, and was set up as an example for
all Chinese people to follow.
</P>
<P>
Admission to the memorial hall, covering an area of 4,400 sq m,
is free of charge, and it is open every day of the year.
</P>
<P>
A wedding ceremony was held for eight couples at the
hall last September.
</P>
<P>
Some visitors consider it a holy place for purifying the
spirit, and some feel a burst of confidence as soon as they enter
the hall, according to comments in its visitors' book.
</P>
<P>
Exhibitions on the glorious deeds of Lei Feng have also been
sponsored by the memorial hall around the province; an exhibition
tour of 14 cities across the province last year attracted 70,000

<HEADLINE> Fish Export Becomes Second Foreign Exchange </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's fish export has
become the country's second foreign exchange earner next to
coffee, according to Henry Kajura, Ugandan Minister of Trade and
Industry.
</P>
<P>
The minister told a one-day workshop on fish industry that the
foreign exchange earned by fish export increased from 1.2 billion
Uganda Shillings (some 1.2 million U.S. Dollars) in 1991 to 39
billion Shillings (some 39 million Dollars) in 1997, The Monitor
newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Kajura expressed concerns about a sustainable
development of the industry due to the coverage of lake surface
by water hyacinth and the dumping of industrial waste into the
lake.
</P>
<P>
Statistics indicated reduced catches in all major lakes,
the minister said.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out the suffocating effect of commercial
fishing on traditional fishermen. The small scale fishing
industry is the main economic activity in the areas adjacent to
Lake Victoria and Lake Kiyoga in the central part of the country.

in the fourth quarter of 1997, Hong Kong's fund management
industry managed to register modest growth for the full year, the
Hong Kong Investment Funds Association (HKIFA) said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
As at the end of December 1997, HKIFA members managed 772
authorized unit trusts and mutual funds, representing total assets
of 58.5 billion U.S. dollars. This compared with 723 funds and
41.5 billion U.S. dollars of assets a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Reviewing the development of the fund industry, Peter Lord,
chairman of the HKIFA, said: "Despite the Asian maelstrom in the
fourth quarter of 1997, the fund industry saw a modest growth for
the full year and the industry continues to maintain its balanced
and diversified characteristics."
</P>
<P>
"The wider distribution of unit trusts by banks, combined with
higher levels of education and financial awareness among the
public, helped the industry both to grow and to weather the
storms," said Lord.
</P>
<P>
But he pointed out the industry was not immune from the
regional crisis. "The crisis, which has dampened the general
investment sentiment, left the fund industry with a substantial
drop in gross sales, and net outflows in most of the equity
sectors in the fourth quarter."
</P>
<P>
However, the impact is likely not to be as severe or as
extensive as that felt in certain other sectors within the
financial industry.
</P>
<P>
As for the prospects of the next couple of months, Lord said,
"While investment sentiment has shown some improvement, we don't
envisage a massive influx of new money in the immediate future."
</P>
<P>
"One reason is that there are still uncertainties over the
outcome of the Asian financial crisis. Also, as interest rates
stay high and the amount required to service mortgage loans has
grown faster than wage levels, inflows will remain subdued in the
short-term."
</P>
<P>
Over the longer term, Lord believed that the growth in the unit
trust industry would be bolstered by the changes in the
demographic profiles of the local population.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's population is relatively young with 63 percent
being under 30 years of age. In the next five or ten years, there
is a large group of well educated, young consumers moving through
their financial establishment phase and they will be more likely
to invest in unit trusts and other forms of equity-related assets,
Lord said.

<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Mongolian Prime Minister
Mendsaikhan Enkhsaikhan said Tuesday that Mongolia is taking
measures to absorb more foreign investment in oil and mining
industry.
</P>
<P>
Enkhsaikhan told Xinhua that these measures include improvement
of relevant rules and regulations on exploitation, simplifying
procedures on negotiations and agreement signing, and tax
exempting for foreign companies.
</P>
<P>
In the past three months, he noted, Mongolia reached five
agreements with foreign companies on the distribution of oil
products.
</P>
<P>
Beginning to use foreign investment in 1993, he said,
Mongolia's oil industry is now exporting to China to open new
field for bilateral economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Enkhsaikhan recalled that Mongolia's industrial output
increased by 4.4 percent in 1997 and that of the mining sector
went up by as high as 17.7 percent.

A new mining law, which came into effect last July, provides
additional legal protection to foreign companies that are licensed
to explore on 20 percent of Mongolia's land, Enkhsaikhan
said.

</P>
<P>
Yashuhiko said he was pleased to meet with the president. The

<HEADLINE> Profile: Official for Border Area Development Elected NPC Deputy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Mayor Jin Shuoren of
Hunchun city in northeast China's Jilin Province is a newly
elected deputy to the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC), which
will be held in Beijing early March.
</P>
<P>
"The decisive factor for my election lies in the strategic
position of Hunchun, a key for the development of the Tumen River
which requires the combined efforts of the U.N. Development
Program and several Asian countries," said Jin, 44.
</P>
<P>
"During the NPC session, I will forward the opinions of local
people and appeal to the country for accelerating the pace of
international cooperation in terms of the Tumen River's
development," he added.
</P>
<P>
Jin, of Korean origin, graduated from the Department of
Political Sciences at Yanbian University. He obtained a master's
degree from Jilin University in 1994 and is pursuing a doctoral
degree in world economy. He took up the post of city mayor in
January of 1996.
</P>
<P>
He has succeeded in increasing the industrial output of his
city from 230 million yuan to 440 million yuan in two
years. An export-oriented economy, covering the fields of finance,
foreign trade, tourism, real estate and high-technology, has taken
shape at a state-listed development zone on the border between
Hunchun and Russia and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
(DPRK).
</P>
<P>
To facilitate the development of the Tumen River area, Hunchun
is building a 39-kilometer highway leading to Juanhe City on the
Sino-Korean border and speeding construction of a railway line
between China and Russia.
</P>
<P>
Outlining major steps for the Tumen River area's development,
Jin said that his city would carry out technological upgrading of
a local power plant, improve facilities at Juanhe Port, build a
reservoir at Laolongkou and open sea and land outlets to the
Republic of Korea and the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
In his leisure time, Jin is busy preparing for his doctoral
thesis on market economies.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's opposition Party for
Morality and Economic Progress (PAMEP) has warned the United
States against letting its policies in the Middle East being
dictated by economic interests.
</P>
<P>
Zambia Daily Mail today quoted PAMEP President Philemon
Nyirenda as saying that the United States should not let its
policies be decreed by its interests for oil in the Middle East
at the expense of human life.
</P>
<P>
In his protest statement sent to the U.S.ambassador to Zambia
on Monday over U.S.impending military strike on Iraq, Nyirenda
said his party is against use of force in solving international
disputes.
</P>
<P>
He said it is not in the interest of the American people and
the rest of the world for American to attack Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. is more legitimate and capable to deal with such
matters and has the mandate from the people of the world, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"We have followed with great admiration how Americans love and
care for their children. We feel the same should apply when it
comes to Iraq, they are also god's children.
</P>
<P>
"The use of force is not synonymous with democratic principles
for which America is a great believer and preacher," he said.
</P>
<P>
Nyirenda said that Africa and the Arab world need development
and not wars and that the choice of leadership in Iraq is the
prerogative of the Iraqi people just as it is the choice of
americans to choose a leader of their choice.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 24 (Xinhua) -- China produced 8.77 million
tons of steel in January, an increase of 6.5 percent over the
year-ago period, according to statistics released by China's
Ministry of Metallurgical Industry.
</P>
<P>
This was only one of China's major iron and steel products that
achieved steady growth.
</P>
<P>
During the month, the production volume of pig iron reached
9.04 million tons, up 6.3 percent; that of rolled steel was 7.26
million tons, up 4.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, coke and ferro-alloy production exceeded demand. The
production volume of coke dropped 2.4 percent from the same period
last year, and ferro-alloy, 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The impact of Southeast Asia's financial crisis on the
international rolled steel market has put pressure on China's
exports of iron and steel products, according industry analysts.
</P>
<P>
This resulted in a 41 percent decline for the same period last
year in China's exports of billet and rolled steel in January,
which totaled 270,000 tons. Merely 60,000 tons of billet was
exported, a decrease of 71 percent.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say with the intensifying domestic market competition,
prices for major products are steadily declining.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The All China Women's
Federation will work to help more laid-off women to find new jobs
and more rural women to rise above the poverty line this year.
</P>
<P>
The federation plans to set up more re-employment training
bases across the country for laid-off women workers, said Zhang
Shiping, a federation official.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that local women's unions across the country will
also found their own economic entities to provide jobs for
unemployed women.
</P>
<P>
The women are also advised to find jobs in the service industry
and the non-public sector, whose development is encouraged under
the guidelines of the 15th National Congress of the Communist
Party of China, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
China's has more than 10 million laid-off workers, and 20
million more are expected to become redundant as state-owned
enterprises streamline their workforce to improve efficiency. The
majority of laid-off workers are women.
</P>
<P>
During the last two years, the women's federation has set up
employment information centers in 25 cities, trained one million
laid-off women and helped more than 300,000 of them find new jobs.
</P>
<P>
In the countryside, the federation will get more rural women to
learn and use new farming technology, especially those in ethnic
minority and remote areas, Zhang said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Projections Call for Surging Rural Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 24 (Xinhua) -- China's rural market is
expected to flourish in 1998, with projections calling the rural
consumer goods retail volume to hit 1,354.3 billion yuan, up 13
percent on 1997, according to a report released by the State
Information Center.
</P>
<P>
The report indicates that rural markets will witness varying
margins of demand for various types of consumer goods, with
particularly brisk sales expected for household appliances,
including color television sets, refrigerators and washing
machines.
</P>
<P>
Demand for pesticides, plastic sheeting and fertilizer is also
expected to rise as farmers increase investments in production.
Balanced supply and demand for most agricultural capital goods,
with the exception of diesel fuel and some farm machinery, will
most likely be maintained this year under conditions featuring
increased supplies and stable prices.
</P>
<P>
Some 10 percent of housing in rural areas will be rebuilt or
refurbished during the Ninth Five-Year Plan Period (1996-2000).
The report indicates that 72 billion yuan in capital will be
earmarked for refurbishing housing with floor space of over 400
million square meters.
</P>
<P>
The rapid development of the rural market in recent years
readily indicates the vast potential for further expansion, and an
increasing number of commercial and industrial enterprises are
basing their marketing goals on rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Based on the preconditions of adjusting product mix, lowering
production costs and guaranteeing quality, state-owned enterprises
will develop practical products targeting rural consumers, while
enterprises under various forms of ownership will compete in terms
of pricing and other functional areas beyond simply solidifying
and expanding existing markets.
</P>
<P>
The rural market will witness increasing competition coupled
with expanded production and increased supplies of commodities,
according to the report.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The Zambia Revenue Authority
(ZRA) has vowed to meet this year's revenue target by tightening
loose ends and improving operations.
</P>
<P>
Financial Mail Tuesday quoted ZRA Chairman Patrick Chiumya as
telling the local weekly newspaper that ZRA will go ahead and
tighten loose ends to ensure the targeted revenue from local
resources of 1178.75 billion Kwacha (about 845 million U.S.
Dollars) is achieved.
</P>
<P>
Loopholes such as smuggling will be sealed through deployment
of the fast team patrols and increasing the number of employees
to curb smuggling, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Zambia Association of Manufacturers and the Zambia
Association of Chambers of Commerce and Industry have expressed
their concern that smuggling is on the increase while other
observers feel that even the hiked duty on second hand clothes
will increase smuggling, the newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
There has been an outcry from various sections of the
community charging that hiked duty on the imports of second-hand
clothes will hurt the poor and civil servants.
</P>
<P>
But Chiumya noted that smuggling will be reduced by effecting
various measures.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Ronald Penza announced in his budget at the
end of last month the increased duty on the second hand clothes.
</P>
<P>
This year's total revenue stands at about 1,300 million
Dollars, of which 65 percent will come from the domestic revenue.

JOHANNESBURG, February 24 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela Tuesday expressed relief at the apparent
diplomatic solution to the standoff in Baghdad over United
Nations weapons inspections following Monday's agreement between
Iraq and UN chief Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at his Cape Town residence, Mandela said he had not
yet seen the details of the agreement, but had read in the
newspapers that United States President Bill Clinton appeared to
be happy with it and would support it.
</P>
<P>
Although it was premature to comment on the agreement before
he had seen the text, Mandela said it was a great relief to see
an improvement on the issue, South African Press Association
reported.
</P>
<P>
"It was of great concern, the threat to strike, because we
knew it's not to hit any military target -- it's going to kill
children, women, the aged: very innocent people, and that is
something that we cannot tolerate," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I'm very happy that it does appear that the tension that was
building up is now going to be eliminated," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said his government supported diplomatic solutions.
</P>
<P>
"We are against any form of violence no matter by whom it is
caused. We went out of our way in our own country to avoid
violence and we think the entire world should do that," he said.

BEIJING, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The People's Bank of China
(PBOC) today officially announced disbandment of the China
Agricultural Trust and Investment Company (CATIC).
</P>
<P>
The announcement said PBOC disbanded CATIC according to law on
January 4, 1997, and assigned custodial responsibility to the
China Construction Bank.
</P>
<P>
CATIC's securities section will be incorporated in the China
Xinda Trust Investment Company, with the latter assuming control

<P>
The China Construction Bank will assume all other assets and
debts, excluding those transferred to the Ministry of Finance, the

</P>
<P>
China Construction Bank will carry out required legal
procedures as the creditor and will assume control of the
headquarters and financial branches of the former CATIC.
</P>
<P>
CATIC's huge losses and inability to pay its debts were
attributed to illegal business practices uncovered in 1997. The
PBOC responded by dissolving the company to protect national

LAGOS, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Africa's top oil producer
Nigeria has seen its crude oil production up by 10,000 barrels a
day following the operation of two new oil fields.
</P>
<P>
The new oil fields, located at Ogbotobo and Agbaya in the
Delta State in the south, began production last month from a
total of seven wells, media reports said.
</P>
<P>
The new oil fields are operated by the Shell Petroleum

Shell and the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation.
</P>
<P>
Shell officials were quoted as saying that the new fields have
raised the joint venture's output to 930,000 barrels a day, or 43
percent of Nigeria's total production of 2.175 million barrels a
day.

<HEADLINE> Biopiracy of Indian Plants Continues: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Biopiracy of Indian plants
is continuing unabated by developed countries, said a report
available here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A fact-sheet, prepared by India's Research Foundation for
Science, Technology and Ecology, lists 22 medicinal and
agricultural plants that have been patented by American and
European countries. Apart from Neem and Turmeric, a number of
other Indian plants such as Mustard, Black Pepper, Castor and
Cumin, etc., have been patented by some developed countries.
</P>
<P>
There are about 100 plants which have already been patented by
Americans.
</P>
<P>
The Hindu said Tuesday in its editorial that "What is baffling
is that the U.S. firm has obtained the patent when it cannot by
any means claim Basmati (rice) as its invention or a registered
brand. Basmati is grown in parts of northern India and both India
and Pakistan have a virtual monopoly of this strain in the world
market."
</P>
<P>
"The patent issue underscores the threat of biopiracy by
foreign firms under the new dispensation of globalization," it
said.

LAGOS, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Only one percent of the school
age children in Nigeria meet the World Health Organization (WHO)
minimum nutritional standard, a leading newspaper here reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria has 15 million children in primary schools, with three
million of them not going to school because of socio-economic
problems, particularly lack of funds.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 10 percent of them suffer learning disability, the
Guardian reported, quoting Taoheed Adedoja, provost of the
Federal College of Education.
</P>
<P>
The professor described the disability as "inability to cope
with the acquisition of knowledge within one's age range".
</P>
<P>
The dean listed poor learning environment, distractions, poor
nutrition and lack of facilities as some of contributing factors
to the disability.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the minimum quantity of food to be consumed
should be one egg for four children, but it is now for 40
children.
</P>
<P>
"The situation has become compounded because of the
socio-economic problems and as a result of the poor nutrition,
more children are being handicapped," Adedoja said.
</P>
<P>
The situation is worrisome in the eastern part of the country
where there is high rate of dropout because they do not see the
utility in education for self-development, the dean added.

<HEADLINE> Minister Urges Greater Efforts for Information Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 24 (Xinhua) -- China should exert greater
efforts to develop its information industry to boost economic
growth, said Hu Qili, minister of Electronics Industry.
</P>
<P>
Today's People's Daily quoted Hu as saying that "the level of
economic information has emerged an important gauge of a country's
comprehensive national strength."
</P>
<P>
"Developing the information industry and using electronic
information technology to boost economic growth is highly
realistic and will have far-reaching significance," Hu said.
</P>
<P>
Hu noted that the Chinese Government has attached great
importance to development of the information industry in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show the 1997 output value for the electronics
industry hit 380 billion yuan, a 3.8-fold rise on 1992, with the
sales volume growing by 3.2-fold to 250 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The electronics industry grew by an average 27.5 percent
annually between 1992-1997, the highest rate for all industries,
according to Hu.
</P>
<P>
He said that China faces serious challenges in terms of
developing its electronics industry.
</P>
<P>
The growth rate for electronic information technology will
exceed that of the past 10-20 years, said Hu, adding that the
industry is expected to achieve major breakthroughs in computers,
telecommunication, broadcasting and display technology.
</P>
<P>
"We face challenges in terms of grasping opportunities economic
digitalization and networking offer for upgrading the industrial
mix," according to the minister.
</P>
<P>
Projections call for the electronic information market to soar
to one trillion yuan by the year 2000, with the figure expected to
rise to six trillion yuan by 2010.
</P>
<P>
"The market will emerge as a major driving force in China's
economic growth," said Hu.
</P>
<P>
He noted that China enjoys many favorable conditions for
developing the electronics information industry, and the Chinese
market will open further and gain increasing competitiveness in
terms of supply and demand.
</P>
<P>
The Minister called for the introduction of strategic measures
to promote the shift from simulation to digitalized technology,
and noted simulated electronic products are rapidly being replaced
by digitalized products.
</P>
<P>
He called for greater efforts to raise the level of economic
information and wider use of electronic information technology in
the transformation of traditional industries.
</P>
<P>
In terms of applications, development of the software, chip
design and integrated circuit industries fully conforms to
national conditions, said Hu.

BEIJING, February 24 (Xinhua) -- China today urged some
countries to set store by the overall interests of bilateral
relations and keep vigilant against the political scheme of the
Taiwan authorities and refrain from doing anything that will hurt
the feelings of the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao made the remark
here today at a regular press conference when asked to comment on
activities conducted by Lien Chan from Taiwan in Jordan and some
other Mideast countries.
</P>
<P>
"We are deeply concerned over this," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the question of Taiwan is a major and sensitive
matter of principle that bears upon China's sovereignty and
unification and touches on the feelings of the 1.2 billion Chinese
people.
</P>
<P>
"We take no objection to the non-governmental contacts between
countries concerned and Taiwan, but we are firmly opposed to any
forms of governmental contacts with Taiwan by countries having
diplomatic relations with China," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu went on to say that the Taiwan authorities, by capitalizing
on the temporary economic difficulties of some countries, have
been pursuing "pragmatic diplomacy" by means of offering so-called
"economic assistance" and conducting "economic cooperation" in an
attempt to undermine friendly relations between China and
countries in the region.
</P>

tolerate," he stated.

extended its welcome to a decision made by the European Union (EU)
not to table any draft resolution against China at this year's
session of the United Nations (UN) Human Rights Commission.
</P>
<P>
The remark came from Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao at

sign any draft resolution against China at this year's session of

This has fully demonstrated that dialogue and cooperation on
human rights issues on the basis of equality and mutual respect
constitute the correct way to enhance mutual understanding and
narrow differences, which, he noted, has become a common
understanding of an increasing number of countries.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that this decision made by the EU will further
promote the relations between China and the EU and between China
and the EU members, including the dialogue and cooperation between
the two sides in the field of human rights," the spokesman said.

BEIJING, February 24 (Xinhua) -- China's textiles and garments
export volume reached 45.45 billion U.S. dollars last year, up 22.8
percent over the previous year, latest statistics show.
</P>
<P>
The figure accounts for one-fourth of the country's total

<HEADLINE> S. African Wine Exports to U.K. Drop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The South African wine
export to Britain dropped seven percent in volume terms in the
second half of last year, local daily the Star reported on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference in Cape Town, Jane Hunt,
Director of Wines of South Africa, attributed the drop to the
phasing out of the South African government's general export
incentive scheme.
</P>
<P>
Unreliable supply was another major reason for the drop in
wine exports, she said.
</P>
<P>
"When government assistance dried up, producers increased
their prices to maintain their profit margins," Hunt said.
</P>
<P>
"Quality did not lift with prices and consequently British
consumers turned their backs on South African wines," she added.
</P>
<P>
Hunt noted that the South African wine export should aim at the
top end of the British market, saying "we should export more top
quality wines".
</P>
<P>
"Currently, South Africa has a fair share of the lower and
middle price markets, where consumers have little loyalty to
brands and producing countries," Hunt said.
</P>
<P>
"In the high price market, consumers are far more loyal and
that is where South African producers should aim," she urged.
</P>
<P>
About 60 percent of all South African wine exports go to
Britain, the country's single biggest buyer of wines.

<HEADLINE> mee022405hke - Iran Welcomes EU Decision to Resume Contacts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi here Tuesday voiced Tehran's welcome to the decision of
the European Union (EU) to resume ministerial contacts with Iran.
</P>
<P>
Answering questions at the opening session of the 8th Persian
Gulf seminar, Kharrazi said the EU decision indicated European
countries have a better understanding about the developments and
situation in Iran.
</P>
<P>
"We have announced our readiness to expand relations with
other countries on the basis of mutual respect and mutual
interest," he said. However, he stressed that Iran opposes any
unilateral decisions on others.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi said Iran welcomes any cooperation and dialogue bassed
on mutual respect and interest, which he said could resolve many
international issues.
</P>
<P>
The EU decided Monday to end the 10-month-old freeze on
senior-level contacts with Iran to "respond positively" to recent
"encouraging" developments in Iran and its interest in more
constructive relations.
</P>
<P>
The 15 EU foreign ministers called for an EU-Iran dialogue on
terrorism, the production of weapons of mass destruction, the
death sentence imposed by Iran's late spiritual leader Ayatollah
Khomenei on the British writer Salman Rushdie for his
"blasphemous" novel, and the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
"Iran's willingness to address these concerns would greatly
enhance the success of the dialogue and Iran's reintegration into
the international community," the communique said.
</P>
<P>
The EU suspended its ministerial contacts and its "critical
dialogue" with Iran last April after a German court accused
Iranian leaders of sponsoring a terrorist assassination of four
Iranian Kurdish rebel leaders in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
An ease of tension appeared last November when the EU sent
their envoys back to Tehran in response to Iran's new, moderate
President Mohammad Khatami's appeal for friendly relations with
the outside world.

<HEADLINE> S. Leonean President Visits Nigeria on Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Deposed Sierra Leonean
President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah has arrived in Abuja, capital of
Nigeria, for a two-day working visit, press reports said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Kabbah, who flew into Abuja from Conakry, Guinea, where he has
lived in exile after his ousting in a coup last May, was received
by Nigeria's Head of State General Sani Abacha at the airport
Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders then went into closed-door deliberations in
the State House, where they are believed to have discussed the
issue of Kabbah's return to power, reportedly to take place later
this week.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the State House are quoted as saying that the
meeting was necessitated by the fact that General Abacha is the
current chairman of the Economic Community of West African States
(ECOWAS), whose peacekeeping force known as ECOMOG flushed out
the military junta in Freetown about a fortnight ago.
</P>
<P>
Following the sack of the junta, Kabbah has advised his
countrymen to remain calm and to return to their normal business,
while preparing for a comeback from Conakry.
</P>
<P>
Currently, ECOMOG is in firm control of the capital Freetown
and Bo, the second largest city in Sierra Leone, but some other
major towns are still under the control of forces loyal to the
junta.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the whereabouts of the junta leader Johnny Paul
Koroma still remains unknown.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 24 (Xinhua) -- China manufactured 100,700
automobiles in January, down 18.21 percent on the 1996 period,
according to statistics released by the auto production department
under China's Ministry of Machine-Building Industry.
</P>
<P>
A total of 88,400 automobiles were sold during the month, up
22.84 percent on January 1996.
</P>
<P>
Some 125,600 automobiles remained in inventory at the end of
the month.
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts attribute the decrease in production and
sales to fewer work days in January, with holidays for both New
Year's Day and the Chinese Lunar New Year which commenced on
Jan. 28.
</P>
<P>
However, production and sales of mini-buses grew slightly
during the month, with the 17,600 units rolling off the assembly
line representing 0.44 percent growth on the previous year's
period.
</P>
<P>
Sales of mini-buses grew one percent to 17,400 units.
</P>
<P>
The respective production volumes for heavy-duty, medium-weight
and light-weight trucks stood at 1,700, 9,400 and 16,800
respectively, with corresponding sales volumes ending at 1,300,
6,800 and 13,100 units.
</P>
<P>
The sector manufactured 33,000 automobiles and sold 30,200 units
during the month.
</P>
<P>
Various automobiles manufacturers enjoyed rising production and
sales, including First Automotive Works (FAW)-Volkswagen and

<HEADLINE> Iran Calls for US Actions over Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Tuesday called on the
United States to translate its "good words" about the relations
between the two countries into actions.
</P>
<P>
"I have heard some good words from the American side, but I
believe that it is the time to materialize those good words in
concrete actions," Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi told
reporters on the sidelines of the 8th Persian Gulf Seminar.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has responded positively to a call made by Iranian
President Mohammad Khatami last January to hold dialogues between
the peoples of the two countries. It has also urged Iran to carry
out talks between the governments to improve the relationship.
</P>
<P>
"Until actions (taken by the U.S.), naturally words are not
enough," Kharrazi said.
</P>
<P>
He declined to comment on the recent visit of an American
wrestling team to Tehran, which was warmly welcomed by Iranians.
</P>
<P>
The wrestlers arrived here last Tuesday to attend the Takhti
Cup international wrestling tournament. It has been the first
U.S. delegation to visit Iran since the two countries broke
diplomatic relations in 1980 after the Islamic Revolution in
1979.

<HEADLINE> New Pest Threatening Africa's Citrus Plants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Scientists have identified a
new insect pest that poses serious threat to citrus plants in
eastern and southern Africa, the East African Standard newspaper
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Infestations of the citrus woolly white fly, also known as
Aleurothrixus floccosus, are becoming wide-spread especially in
central and western Kenya, Uganda, northern Tanzania, Zanzibar,
and central and southern Malawi, said the report.
</P>
<P>
"Although the insect usually target citrus trees, in Africa it
has also been reported on coffee, guava, mango and eggplant," the
report said.
</P>
<P>
However, the citrus woolly white fly has not yet created havoc
in farming communities in Africa, according to the Agroforestry
Today, a journal issued by the Nairobi-based International Center
for Research in Agroforesty (ICRAF).
</P>
<P>
It became the most devastating citrus pest of the
Mediterranean in mid-1970s, when the economy of entire regions
depends on citrus production.
</P>
<P>
Research findings show that the citrus woolly white fly causes
damage by feeding on leaves and fruits, resulting in partial
defoliation, mottled, small fruits and generally weakened trees.
</P>
<P>
Considered more serious, however, is the insect's copious
production of honeydew.
</P>
<P>
It has been observed that these heavy deposits and subsequent
growth of sooty would impede assimilation process of leaves and
make pruning and fruit picking difficult.
</P>
<P>
So far the only solution is to use exotic parasitoids to kill
the pest, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The insects live on the young flush (the new growth of leafy
shoots) of citrus, where adults lay their eggs on the lower
surface of the leaves.
</P>
<P>
"The nymphs, permanently attached to the leaf surface, feed on
the sap of the plant. During development, they produce fine
threads of a waxy substance, which cover the entire colony of the
immature white flies like cotton wool -- hence the name," said the
journal.
</P>
<P>
The adult woolly white fly measures less than 0.5 mm long and
cannot be easily distinguished from other white flies such as the
cotton white fly. But the pest is easily identified in its
immature stages by its colonies on the lower leaf surfaces of
citrus trees.
</P>
<P>
The total development time of the insect in the tropics is
about one month.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria to Promote Animal Husbandry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria has produced a
development plan to spend 280 billion leva (about 156 million
U.S. dollars) between 1998-2001 to restore and promote its animal
husbandry, a senior official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture Minister Ventsislav Varbanov said that part of the
money will come from Bulgaria's "agriculture fund" and the rest from
the World Bank loans and funds of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria's animal husbandry has suffered greatly from the
nation's unstable economical situation since 1989. A traditionally
agrarian country, Bulgaria has to import meats from the United
States and Brazil for domestic consumption at high cost.
</P>
<P>
Even the plan, a product of efforts of 35 Bulgarian experts of
months, is fully carried out, Bulgaria's animal husbandry
production level in 2001 is still expected to be far below that of
1989.

these forces," he said, "their presence will turn the region
into a military barrack, cause greater instability... and in
the long run impede political, social and economical development
of the countries in the region."
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi reiterated that Iran seeks peace, stability and
security in the Gulf, saying that "nothing is more important
for Iran in the pursuit of its foreign policy than to
consolidate stability and security in the Persian Gulf."
</P>
<P>
He said that the ongoing visit of Chairman of Iran's
State Expediency Council and former Iranian President Hashemi
Rafsanjani to Saudi Arabia "is a clear indication of friendly
relationships between the two countries."
</P>
<P>
"We have also reached out to other countries in the
region in a bid to further improve our bilateral cooperation,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani left here Saturday for a ten-day official visit
to Saudi Arabia in an aim to improve relations between the
two important states in the Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi stressed that disputes and misunderstandings can and
must be resolved through peaceful means, without resorting to
coercive measures, stating that confidence building should be
accorded high priority and new innovative approaches should be
explored.
</P>
<P>
"I believe dialogue is the only way to go" the Iranian
foreign minister said, dialogue and exchange of ideas and
views can form the constituent parts of a desirable security
system in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed regret that Iraq has suffered in the
recent years under the U.N. sanctions following the Gulf war
in 1991, hoping that the recent Iraqi crisis would be
resolved in a peaceful manner through a more rational policy
by the Iraqi leaders and good offices of the U.N. Security
General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
Annan and Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz Monday
signed a document over the U.N.-Iraq standoff over arms
inspection, averting a U.S. military strike on the country.
</P>
<P>
The two-day seminar of "regional approaches in the Persian
Gulf" will discuss the latest developments in the region,
particularly the recent Iraqi crisis.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon's Hezbollah Calls for Hebrew TV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's Hezbollah has
suggested the government set up a satellite television station
that beams programs in Hebrew to the Israeli public, the local Daily
Star newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Such a TV station is aimed at reaping the heated debate in
Israel over the future of its occupation of south Lebanon,
Hezbollah's press chief Nayef Krayem said on Monday at a lunch
organized for the local media.
</P>
<P>
It will serve to increase the number of Israelis that object to
the occupation and support a withdrawal of troops, he said.
</P>
<P>
If approved, the station will be government-run, he said,
adding the Hezbollah, or Party of God, is ready to help, because
it has "several members fluent in Hebrew."
</P>
<P>
He said it would be an example that media can play a role in
supporting resistance against Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
He is expected to meet with Lebanese Information Minister
Bassem Al-Sabaa Tuesday to officially present the suggestion.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed Hezbollah is spearheading an anti-Israeli
occupation campaign, militarily and psychologically, in an effort
to oust 2,500 Israeli occupation troops from south Lebanon.

Minister for Foreign Affairs Rebecca Kadaga has said.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with the visiting British Parliament
International Development Committee (IDC) delegation on Monday,
the Ugandan minister of state talked of the east African
coopeation in troops training and noted that there is " no ulterior
motive" in the joint training program.
</P>
<P>
Answering questions from the visitors about east African
cooperation, Kadaga said a memorandum of association is due to be
signed during the east African cooperation meeting due to be held
on March 10 in Arusha, Tanzania. Modalities will be worked out
on how to carry out the exercise, she explained.

fundamentalism, and not on the American camp against Sudan,'' she
added.

<HEADLINE> Australian Stocks Close Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The Australian sharemarket
closed higher Tuesday in Sydney following strong local
institutional buying and the ANZ Banking Group's announcement that
it would cut 1,700 jobs.
</P>
<P>
Investors interpreted the redundancies as indicating further
staff losses among other banks in the future, which pushed share
prices in the index higher, brokers said.
</P>
<P>
"There was some very good buying from local institutions
today," said Peter Struk of Reynolds &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
The all ordinaries index closed up 11.1 points at 2,666.2, off
its low of 2,640.2.
</P>
<P>
The stock averages, however, finished mixed, with the all
resources index closing down 15.2 points at 1,122.9 and the all
industrials closing up 40.1 points at 4,596.2.
</P>
<P>
Metal prices in London overnight did not help the resources
sector, with copper, aluminum and zinc prices tumbling to fresh
lows over concern on the Japanese economy and the slowing metals
demand in Asia.
</P>
<P>
National turnover remained thin, with 276.81 million shares
exchanged valued at 542.75 million U.S. dollars, and falls
outnumbered rises 658 to 514.
</P>
<P>
ANZ, which closed up 20 cents at 9.74 Australian dollars,
revealed it would slash its Australian workforce by a further
1,700 full-time positions to accelerate cost savings and steer
more customers towards electronic banking.
</P>
<P>
Struk said that the ANZ job losses would have "a big effect on
its bottom line" and raised speculation that the other banks would
also continue to cut staff to reduce costs to remain competitive.
</P>
<P>
National Australia Bank closed up 23.5 cents at 20.085
Australian dollars, Commonwealth Bank of Australia gained 18.2
cents to close at 17.73 Australian dollars and Westpac Banking
Corp. gained 5.9 cents to 10.10 Australian dollars.

<HEADLINE> Technion Provides Video Self-service for Absent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 24 (Xinhua) -- At Technion, Israeli
Institute of Technology, students who missed classes for all
reasons now don not have to get worried anymore thanks to a
newly-dedicated video self-service.
</P>
<P>
The absent student needs only to insert his student card
into either of two videomat machines to get a video cassette
of the missed class and watch it either in his dorm or in
the library.
</P>
<P>
Earlier the week, Technion, which is based in the northern
port city Haifa, dedicated the self-service, computerized lending
facility in its multimedia library. The facility has a
collection of 1,000 cassettes.
</P>
<P>
The videomat machines are believed to be the only ones on
an Israeli campus, and perhaps the first in the world. The
student does not have to prove that being in the army,
illness or laziness was reason for absence, but merely pays a
fee of less than one U.S. dollar for each videotape.
</P>
<P>
The institute's spokesman Amir Zmora said there was some
hesitation about supplying the video films, since it could
encourage lazy students to stay away from classes.
</P>
<P>
But the administration finally decided that the benefit
surpassed the possible shortcomings, and that students who wanted
to participate actively in class by asking questions would not
be satisfied with seeing filmed lectures.
</P>
<P>
The videos, which were made of basic lectures, but not of
the more advanced courses, also will help students review
material that they heard live from their professors.
</P>
<P>
The video library has filmed lecturers in 32 different
courses, and students had already borrowed the cassettes for
thousands of times even before the automated machines were
installed.

<HEADLINE> Success to Angola's Peace Process Doubted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Roberto de Almeida, speaker of
the Angolan National Assembly, reportedly said in Cuba Tuesday
that the recent series of incidents in Angola have raised doubts
among people over the successful ending to the country's peace
process.
</P>
<P>
He believed that it is impossible to complete all the tasks,
including the disbanding of all the remanent soldiers of the
former rebel UNITA (National Union for the Total Independence of
Angola), the re-establishment of national authority in
all UNITA-occupied regions, and the transforming of UNITA radio
station into commercial one before February 28, the prescribed
date set for the ending of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Higino Carneiro, spokesman for the Angolan government in the
Joint Commission of Angolan Peace Process, Monday also expressed
worries over the current political and military situation in the
country, which he said, is quite similar to that at the
end of 1992 when the civil war re-started.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the incidents of re-planting landmines,
armed attacks at local government and police headquarters and
killing innocent citizens in Luanda-Norte and Lunda-Sui Provinces in
the northeast, and central plateau and western cost, are
committed by the remanent UNITA soldiers and are all
organized and planned.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government has called on the joint commission
to take up necessary measures to prevent similar incidents
from ever happening again, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Carneiro said, the government has urged U.N.
observers in Angola to reinforce its strength in the areas
involved and send investigation teams to regions with serious
incidents reported.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Ends Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar inched
higher Tuesday in Sydney in quiet dealing and traders said the
market was waiting for direction.
</P>
<P>
The unit closed at 66.62 U.S. cents, from 66.45 at the previous
session close.
</P>
<P>
Traders noted good two-way flows on the day, with buyers
lurking at 66.4 U.S. cents and sellers lined up around 66.8 U.S.
cents.
</P>
<P>
"It seems to be stuck in the middle of that" band, said Stuart
Moore, foreign exchange manager with St. George Bank Ltd.
</P>
<P>
Traders said the market was waiting for further directional
cues after the currency lost more than one U.S. cent during the
previous local session.
</P>
<P>
Those losses were driven by a softer Japanese yen against the
U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
But with the U.S. dollar/yen rate trading quietly Tuesday, the
Australian dollar could only follow suit.
</P>
<P>
Separately, U.S. investment house Merrill Lynch has said the
Australian dollar is now "deeply undervalued," following its
almost 20- percent collapse since late 1996.
</P>
<P>
"The Australian dollar is now the most undervalued of the
world's major currencies," Merrill Lynch said in a research
publication distributed to clients.
</P>
<P>
The currency fell to a 12-year low of 63.19 U.S. cents on
January 12.
</P>
<P>
Merrill Lynch said its fair value estimate for the local unit
is around 75 U.S. cents by the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
"We expect the Australian dollar to appreciate significantly in
(the fiscal year of) 1998/99, returning at least to our fair value
level of 75 U.S. cents," it said.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar ended in Sydney at 85.39 Japanese yen,
from 85.62 previously, and at 1.1968 Deutsche marks, from 1.2126.

<HEADLINE> China's Major Switchboard Manufacturer Enters GSM Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Great Dragon
Telecommunications (GDT), China's largest domestic switchboard
maker, has signed a framework cooperation agreement with DSC
Communications Corp. of the United States.
</P>
<P>
The agreement marks the entry of the two companies into China's
GSM market.
</P>
<P>
According to the pact, GDT and DSC will sell GSM systems in the
low-subscriber-density markets in China. The financial terms have
not been released.
</P>
<P>
In addition, they have been authorized by China United
Telecommunications (Unicom) to conduct a network trial on the
system.
</P>
<P>
Unicom is the second-largest telecommunications operator in
China, with GSM services covering more than 100 large and
medium-sized cities.
</P>
<P>
As foreign investors are barred from the market for value-added
telecom services, they hope to open up this field by exporting
equipment to China.
</P>
<P>
GDT is a group corporation consisting of eight large
state-owned enterprises. So far, it has supplied 6,000 switching
systems and 12 million subscriber lines to the country's Public
Switched Telephone Network.
</P>
<P>
The current production capacity of switching systems exceeds
the demand, industry analysts say, and GDT's cooperation with a
global provider of advanced telecom products will facilitate its
efforts to diversify its business and further involve itself in
mobile telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
According to China's Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications,
the country is the third-largest mobile telecom market in the
world. It had 13 million mobile telecom users at the end of 1997.
</P>
<P>
An industry forecast says that China will become the largest
GSM market in the world by the year 2002, with 40 million GSM
users.
</P>
<P>
DSC had a revenue of 1.6 billion U.S. dollars in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Zambian President Cancels Meeting With Donors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba has cancelled a meeting between his government and donors
sheduled to be held in London this week, Zambia's leading
independent newspaper The Post reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted diplomatic sources in Lusaka as saying Monday
that the meeting, an initiative of the Zambian government, was
intended to provide it an opporunity to persusade donors to
release 160 million U.S.Dollars in external financial assistance
for its 1998 budget.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba called off the meeting after it became clear that it
would yield no results due to continued reluctance among donors
to commit themselves to financial assistance until there is a
normalisaiton of the country's political situation, said the
sources.
</P>
<P>
"Ambasssadors of all the donor countries indicated they would
not attend such a meeting until there was progress on political
issues in the country," said a diplomatic source.
</P>
<P>
"And this is why President Chiluba is now trying to charge all
the coup detainees," the source stated.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba, according to the diplomatic sources, had a sheduled
pre-Paris Club meeting in London this week in the hope of
softening the donors stance ahead of the meeting of the Paris
Club scheduled tentatively for the end of march or april.
</P>
<P>
Zambia's 1998 budget envisages external support of at least
160 million dollars for this fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
However, the country's foiled military coup in October last
year, on-going state of emergency and the subsequent arrests of
coup suspects have tarnished Zambia's image and the donors'
confidence in its political stability.
</P>
<P>
The donors has urged Zambia to try as soon as possible the
detainees that include former president and opposition leader
Kenneth Kaunda. Last week the Zambian government said that the
coup suspects would face trial in "a few days".

JERUSALEM, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Israel is creating a new
program to significantly reduce the number of foreign workers and
replace them with Palestinian workers, a local newspaper reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post said the government intends to cut the
number of foreign workers from 10 percent of the workforce to
under 1 percent by 2003. Israeli workforce currently totals some
2.054 million, according to the Central Bureau of Statistics.
</P>
<P>
Yigal Ben Shalom, director-general of the Labor and Social
Affairs Ministry, was quoted as saying that as a major part of the
program, the ministry has cut the number of legal foreign workers
in the construction sector from 74,000 to 50,000 in 1997, and will
reduce it by a further 10,000 this year.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the government will increase the number of
Palestinian workers from 70,000 to 80,000 this year. It is
estimated that each day about 30,000 Palestinian workers are
entering Israel to work legally, and another 30,000 coming in
illegally.
</P>
<P>
Gershon Baskin, director of the Jerusalem-based Israel and
Palestine Center for Research and Information, welcomed the
government decision.
</P>
<P>
He said that while some 62,000 permits have been issued to
Palestinians, about 50 percent of them could not find job in
Israel due to the large number of foreign workers.
</P>
<P>
But Ben-Shalom said that government is facing a big problem to
deal with a large number of illegal foreign workers in the
country, which is estimated at about 150,000. He said his
ministry has asked Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to increase
the number of monthly deportation of illegal foreign workers from
500 to 1,000.
</P>
<P>
Israeli leaders believe that the increased number of legal or
illegal foreign workers will create a huge social burden or
increase crimes. Palestinian workers, who don't reside in the
country, will not cause similar problems.
</P>
<P>
But until now, Israeli government seems to have not found a
viable way to accommodate the large number of Palestinian workers,
because terror attacks often forced Israel to impose closure on
the territories and ban the entry of Palestinian workers.
</P>
<P>
Yaccov Orr, Israeli Coordinator of Government Activities in
the Territories, said recently that Israel has begun allowing a
limited number of Palestinian workers to stay overnight during
times of closure. But these workers should go through strict
security checks before being issued such special permits.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Welcomes Iraq-UN Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- President Fidel Ramos said
Tuesday that the Philippines welcomes the agreement reached Monday
between the United Nations and Iraq to resolve the crisis over
U.N. weapons inspections in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"We join the international community in congratulating U.N.
Secretary General Kofi Annan and his team for the breakthrough
reached with Iraq during the secretary general's mission to Iraq,"
Ramos said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
But he also said the Philippines will continue to closely
monitor the situation in the area to ensure the safety and welfare
of the country's half a million overseas workers and their
dependents in the Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Foreign Affairs has been asked to draw up a
contingency plan for the evacuation of the overseas workers in the
event that a military confrontation would erupt in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting earlier in the day with visiting Iraqi
Industry and Minerals Minister Adnan Abdul Majeed, Ramos also
reiterated his hope that the U.N.-Iraq agreement would reduce
tension in the region.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said he also hoped that the signing of the accord and its
final approval by the U.N. Security Council would pave the way for
U.N. weapons inspectors to resume their task and fulfill their
U.N. mandate.
</P>
<P>
Ramos congratulated Iraqi President Saddam Hussein for heeding
the call of the international community in ending the crisis
through diplomacy by fully cooperating with the U.N. chief and
avoiding further escalation of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Ramos also called on Iraq to fully comply with all relevant
U.N. Security Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Majeed, whose visit here was essentially to promote
Philippine-Iraqi trade relations, also sought the support of the
Philippines to their call for a lifting of the U.N. economic
embargo on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Majeed said Iraq was ready to cooperate with the international
community in solving the problem through diplomacy and without
resorting to force.

<HEADLINE> China Urged to Quicken Grain Distribution Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 24 (Xinhua) -- China should explore ways to
reform its grain distribution system as part of the country's bid
to establish a socialist market economy, today's Economic Daily
has urged.
</P>
<P>
Three years of successive bumper harvests have brought about
ample grain supply, stable grain prices and all-time high state
grain reserves, thus creating favorable conditions for reforming
the grain distribution system, notes a signed article in the
influential newspaper.
</P>
<P>
China's grain output is estimated to hit 490 million tons in
1997 in spite of rampant natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
Citing the fact that, in advanced countries, contract
agriculture has been highly effective in ensuring a stable market,
the report urges China follow suit and make grain production areas
and grain consumption areas sign three-year contracts that spell
out such items as the variety, quantity, quality, price, supply
date, ways of transaction and places of storage of grain.
</P>
<P>
The article also argued against the extremes of drastic hikes
and freezes in grain prices, both of which China has used to
stablize the market, and suggested "fine tuning" to protect both
producers and consumers.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper pointed to a rising contradiction between the
variety of grain and demand, saying that the country will face a
pressing demand for a structural change in grain production.
</P>
<P>
"When rural and urban residents have had enough to feed and
cloth themselves, they will start demanding quality of
consumption," says the article.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper also suggests that China enforce protective
policies to encourage farmers to grow grain varieties in short
supply.

<HEADLINE> 111 Centenarians Live in Northwest China Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The number of centenarians in
northwest China's Shaanxi Province has increased from 72 in 1992
to 111 by the end of last year, according to the latest statistics
compiled by the provincial committee for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
The oldest is 108 and lives in a village in southern Shaanxi
Province.
</P>
<P>
The survey found that female centenarians outnumber males,
accounting for 71 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
The survey also shows that 79 centenarians, or 71.2 percent,
live in the countryside, with 32 living in urban areas.
</P>
<P>
Experts on the provincial committee for the elderly said that
most of the centenarians are cheerful and vegetarians, and live in
an uncontaminated environment.
</P>
<P>
Heredity was cited as one factor. More than 75 percent of the
centenarians' parents also lived long lives.
</P>
<P>
Experts also attributed the increasing number of centenarians
to an improved living standard. From last July, the centenarians
in the province began to receive a monthly 100-yuan pension from
related departments.

<HEADLINE> 11 Rare Deer Found in Central China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Eleven "David's deer," a rare
animal under national protection, have been found in Huarong
County in central China's Hunan Province.
</P>
<P>
The deers were found eating vegetable by a local farmer in his
fields on Feb. 11. Having never seen such animals, the farmer and
his neighbors caught two.
</P>
<P>
David's deer has the antlers of a deer, the head of a horse,
and the body of a cow. The animal was named after Pere David, a
French Catholic priest and naturalist who first recorded the
existence of the unique deer in China in 1865.
</P>
<P>
David's deer was native to China until the early years of the
20th century, when Westerners invaded China and took the remaining
deers from an imperial park.
</P>
<P>
In 1985, the Marquess of Tavistock of England sent 20 of the
rare animals to Beijing, because of cooperation between the
Chinese and British governments.
</P>
<P>
The deers are now being raised in Beijing as well as Jiangsu
and Hubei provinces. Experts said the newly found deers are
probably from nearby Hubei Province.
</P>
<P>
Related departments have put the two trapped deers under
special protection and required the county not to harm the
others.

TEHRAN, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal

<HEADLINE> Cheetahs Cubs Alive and Well With Dog Milk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Zookeepers at the Shanghai
Safari Park are raising 11 orphaned African cheetah cubs with the
help of a surrogate mother.
</P>
<P>
The mother, which produced two litters of cubs over a 100 day
period in 1997, died soon after birth of the second
litter. Zookeepers explored numerous options and opted for a dog
to serve as the surrogate mother. The decision was based on the
fact that milk produced by a female dog contains the same immunity
factors as that of a female cheetah.
</P>
<P>
The healthy cubs have survived several months on a regimen of
nursing and food additives provided by zookeepers.
</P>
<P>
This marks the first time Chinese zookeepers have raised
African cheetah cubs in captivity. However, the park purchased 10
cheetahs in July 1996 and has since raised them in a
60,000-sq.m. enclosure.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai City Tribune recently donated 60,000 yuan to care
for cubs. The generous donation is expected the raise public
awareness of the need for wildlife protection.

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad Tuesday Urged local companies to possess the
capability to innovate home-grown technology in order to
manufacture products for local and foreign consumption.
</P>
<P>
In light of the current economic setbacks, local companies
should be smart to be self-reliant while at the same time cutting
overhead costs, Mahathir said.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks when opening the MASTER Center, which
promotes greater automation in industries through the use of
robotics. The center is located in the Malaysian Technological
Park in Bukit Jalil here.
</P>
<P>
"Importing technologies and materials for our needs should be
minimized although that may be the easy way out," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said Malaysians should be bold in inventing products
and methods which others have not yet attempted to do.
</P>
<P>
"Let us not be too constrained by existing products invented by
others. Have confidence in ourselves," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said the government would always accord due attention
to ventures geared towards self-production of goods.

He said Malaysians should have full confidence in their
nation's ability to invent and produce goods of world standard
matching foreign-made ones.
</P>
<P>
He urged all parties to make the most of the robotics
facilities available at the Malaysian Technological Park for
purposes of training in components manufacturing and product
research development.
</P>
<P>
He said local companies should act fast in mastering foreign
technology and start producing components rather than merely
assembling those which are mostly imported.
</P>
<P>
Components manufacturing would require maintaining sizable
volume and international quality standards and should not be
limited to catering for local factories only but also for export.
</P>
<P>
He said as for providing services, Malaysia could also
capitalize on its position to offer consultancy services to
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
"In making the most of the lower value of our currency now,
Malaysia, for instance, can provide services in information
technology at competitive terms," he said.

<HEADLINE> Tornado-Hit Central Florida Declared Disaster Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. federal government
Monday declared a state of "major disaster" in central Florida,
making emergency aid available to victims of the tornados that
struck the region early in the day.
</P>
<P>
The White House said the declaration covers five counties in
central Florida already eligible for federal aid from storms on
Christmas Day, and adds 11 central Florida counties struck by
storms earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
The White House also said that President Bill Clinton expressed
his concern about the safety and welfare of the victim families
and will go the Florida on Wednesday to view the tornado damage.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the president has sent representatives of the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), including FEMA director James
Lee Witt, to the tornado-struck area.
</P>
<P>
El Nino-driven tornadoes ripped across central Florida early
Monday, killing at least 38 people, injuring more than 250 others
and leading to 10 more missing.
</P>
<P>
The tornadoes, struck the region from Daytona Beach on the
Atlantic Coast and to the Tampa Bay area on the Gulf Coast, with
some wind speeds as high as 210 mph (336 kph), also destroyed
hundreds of houses and knocked out power for more than 135,000
residents in the region.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-three people were killed in Osceola County and 11 others
were confirmed dead near Sanford in Seminole County about 20 miles
northeast of Orlando. Three were killed in Orange County and one
in Volusia County.
</P>
<P>
In Osceola County southeast of Orlando, emergency officials
said about 200 houses and other structures were damaged or
destroyed and in Orange County, about 100 mobile houses were
damaged or destroyed.
</P>
<P>
The storm was caused partially by the wind patterns and
conditions directed by El Nino, weather service officials said.
</P>
<P>
The Pacific warm-water phenomenon is blamed for a number of
unusual weather patterns around the world, including the series of
storms in California that have caused an estimated 475 million
U.S. dollars in damage.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria to Reduce Armed Forces by One Third before 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria is to cut down the
number of its troops from the present 104,000 to 75,000 by the
year 2000, a major step in the military reform, national
newspapers reported here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Mikho Mikhov, chief of General Staff of the Bulgarian armed
forces, was quoted as telling reporters Sunday that the force
reduction will be a "natural process" in which a soldier's term of
service will be shortened from one and a half years to one year,
and the number of military college recruits will be gradually
reduced.
</P>
<P>
During the reform, army officers will determine themselves
whether they will remain in the army or retire, Mikhov added.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that the ongoing military reform is aimed at
reducing the quantity and improving the quality of the armed
forces.
</P>
<P>
The reform comprises three stages, the first of which was
already completed in 1997 with the withdrawal of troops stationed
in six defended zones.
</P>
<P>
The major tasks in the second stage from 1998 to 2000 are
troop reduction, military restructuring and the establishment of
a rapid reaction force.
</P>
<P>
In the third stage from 2001 to 2010, Bulgaria will set up
professional armed forces and achieve military modernization to a
level close or parallel to the standards of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization.
</P>
<P>
Last July at NATO's special summit in Madrid, Poland, Hungary
and the Czech Republic were invited to join NATO in the first
wave. The three countries will become NATO members in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria ranks fourth among the Balkan countries with regard to
the number of armed forces. With 640,000 troops, Turkey ranks
first, followed by Romania and Greece.

<HEADLINE> New Progress In Human Rights In Tibet (17) IV. The Right to Freedom of Religious Belief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
The Chinese Government respects and protects its citizens'
right to freedom of religious belief in accordance with the
law. The Chinese Constitution stipulates that freedom of religious
belief is one of the fundamental rights of citizens. Specific
provisions on the protection of citizens' right to freedom of
religious belief are also given in the Law on Ethnic Regional
Autonomy, the Criminal Law, the General Rules of the Civil Law,
the Education Law, the Labor Law and the Electoral Law Governing
the People's Congresses. These laws are strictly observed in
Tibet. At present, there are 1,787 sites for Tibetan Buddhist
activities in the Region, and there are 46,380 Buddhist monks and
nuns living in monasteries. The Tibet Autonomous Region and the
seven prefectures or cities under its jurisdiction all have their
own Buddhist associations, and the autonomous regional Buddhist
association has its own journal and establishment for printing
Tibetan-language scriptures.
</P>
<P>
Since the peaceful liberation of Tibet the Chinese Government
has accorded consistent respect and protection to the Tibetan
people's right to freedom of religious belief. In 1951 the
Central Government and the local government of Tibet, headed by
the Dalai Lama, signed the 17-article Agreement on Measures for
the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet, which explicitly stipulated
that "In Tibet a policy ensuring people's freedom of religious
belief will be carried out, the religious beliefs, customs and
habits of the Tibetan people will be respected, and the Lamaist
monasteries will be properly protected. The Central Government
will allow no change in the revenues of monasteries." In 1959,
the Democratic Reform started in Tibet. The feudal privileges of
the three major categories of feudal lords, including senior
monks, as well as the system of exploitation, were abolished, and
religion was separated from government. At the same time, the
Central Government reaffirmed its stand for "respecting the
freedom of religious belief and the customs and habits of the
Tibetan people," and that the monasteries should be managed
independently and in a democratic way by people of religious
persuasion. In addition, the Central Government and the
government of the Tibet Autonomous Region have ranked some famous
religious sites, such as the Potala Palace and Jokhang Temple,
and the Tashilhunpo, Drepung, Sakya and Sera monasteries, among
the key historical sites under state or regional protection. Since
the early 1980s the state has allocated special funds as well as
gold and silver every year for the maintenance, restoration and
protection of monasteries in Tibet, to the sum of over 300
million yuan-worth.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Information
Minister Dato Muhammad Rehmat has said that there are many areas
in which Pakistan and Malaysia could benefit from each other's
experience.
</P>
<P>
Rehmat made the remark in Karachi Monday night upon his arrival
at the start of a three-day visit to Pakistan as the head of a
five-member delegation, according to the Associated Press of
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Talking to newsmen on his arrival, the minister said it was an
era of information technology. "The country which is not getting
right information remained undeveloped", he added.
</P>
<P>
He said people of both countries could know each other much
better through exchange of TV and radio programs.
</P>
<P>
There has been effective flow of information between the two
countries for further expansion of bilateral and trade relations,
said the minister.
</P>
<P>
He said that during his stay in the capital city of Islamabad,
a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) will be signed which will
serve as a very important document for further strengthening of
existing relations between the two Muslim countries.
</P>
<P>
The minister pointed out that Pakistan and Malaysia already
have cooperation in the fields of education, medical services and
employment with more and more Pakistanis now working in Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
However, the basic thing is how to expand trade, he said,
adding that there is strong potential of trade development between
Malaysia and Pakistan.

<HEADLINE> French Friends Recall Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 23 (Xinhua) -- French officials, diplomats,
sinologists and members of Sino-French friendship associations met
here Monday to mark the centennial of the birth of the late
Chinese Premier, Zhou Enlai.
</P>
<P>
The mayor of the 13th Arrondisement of Paris, Jacques Toubon,
laid a spray of flowers before the Number 17 Hotel on the Rue
Godefroy, where Zhou once lived in the early 1920s during his time
in France.
</P>
<P>
The house, which has a green bronze plaque on its wall with a
relief of Zhou, and his name personally written by Deng Xiaoping,
has become a place of pilgrimmage for Chinese visitors.
</P>
<P>
At the memorial meeting in the city hall of the 13th
Arrondisement, French Academician and sinologist Alain Peyreffite
recalled the three meetings he had with Zhou in Beijing in the
1970s.
</P>
<P>
Zhou, who died on January 8, 1976, once told him that during
his stay in France, the hospitality of the French people and their
good feelings toward foreigners had left him with a deep
impression, said Peyreffite.
</P>
<P>
He said that Zhou always supported a strong and united Europe
to counter hegemony by the superpowers, and backed the
independent foreign policy of France under General Charles De
Gaulle.
</P>
<P>
Former delegate minister of the French Foreign Ministry Andre
Bettencourt recalled his meetings with Zhou and Deng Xiaoping in
Beijing in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
He said Deng once told him that it was in France that both he
and Zhou found the only way to save China was by Revolution.
</P>
<P>
Bettencourt said a common fate led Zhou and Deng to fight
together all their life for a strong and prosperous China.
</P>
<P>
The secretary general of the Franco-Chinese Friendship
Association, Madame Marchisio, said that when she was teaching
French at the Foreign Affairs College in Beijing in the 1960s and
70s, Premier Zhou personally cared about her work.
</P>
<P>
Former French ambassador to China Challe Malo and former French
military attache in Beijing General Henri Eyraud also memorized
their personal friendship with Premier Zhou.

KUALA LUMPUR, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Deputy Prime
Minister and Finance Minister Anwar Ibrahim Tuesday held talks
with a group of U.S. fund managers who are here to seek first-hand
information on how Malaysia is tackling its economic problems
brought on by the regional currency and stock market crisis.
</P>
<P>
JP Morgan Securities Asia Vice President Philip Lee, when met
by reporters after the meeting, declined to reveal what was
discussed between the group and Anwar, saying it was
"confidential".
</P>
<P>
Lee said the purpose of the Asian tour is for the fund managers
to come and find out first hand information on what has been
happening in the region and for them to make assessments as to
what they should be doing to help the countries facing the
problems.
</P>
<P>
According to Lee, the group of 15 members managed funds
totaling over one trillion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully after their meetings with officials not only in
Malaysia, but also in the region, they would consider coming back
into the market," he said.
</P>
<P>
The group which came here after similar visits to Seoul, Hong
Kong and Bangkok, will visit Jakarta Wednesday.

 The state and the autonomous region have financed the
maintenance and restoration of a number of famous monasteries,
including the Jokhang, Palkor, Tselayungdrung, Mindrol, Samye
(built in the eighth century), Tashilhunpo, Drepung, Sera and
Ganden (the latter four being the four main monasteries of the
Gelug Sect of Tibetan Buddhism), the Jampa Ling in Qamdo, the
Redreng, the Sakya Monastery of the Sakya Sect, the mTshur-phu
and Karma-gdan-sa monasteries of the Karma Kagyu Sect, the
Drigung Thil Monastery of the Drigung Sect, the Meru and Rala
Yungdrung Ling monasteries of the Bon religion, and the Shalu
Monastery of the Shalu Sect. The state allocated a special fund
of more than 55 million yuan for the five-odd-year renovation of
the Potala Palace involving a total floor space of 33,900 sq
m. Another special fund of 6.7 million yuan, together with 111 kg
of gold and over 2,000 kg of silver and a large amount of gems,
has been provided to finance the restoration of the funerary
stupas and sacrificial halls of the fifth to the ninth Panchen
Lamas. In addition, the state has allocated 66.2 million yuan and
650 kg of gold for the construction of the funerary stupa and
sacrificial hall of the 10th Panchen Lama. In 1994 an additional
appropriation of 20 million yuan was made to further renovate the
Ganden Monastery.
</P>
<P>
 Much importance has always been attached in Tibet to
collecting, editing, publishing and studying ancient religious
books and records. Religious books edited and published in the
1990s include the Tibetan-language Chinese Tripitaka -- Tanjur
(collated edition), A Tibetan-Chinese General Catalogue of the
Tibetan Tripitaka, A Commentary on Tshad-ma sde-bdun, Five
Treatises by the Family of Mercy, Annotations on Pramanavarttika
Karika -- the Solemn Snowland and the Collected Works of
Mani. More than 1,490 copies of the Tanjur of the Tripitaka, and a
large number of pamphlets on Tibetan Buddhist practices,
biographies of famous monks and treatises on Tibetan Buddhism have
been printed to meet the needs of the various monasteries and the
Buddhist monks, nuns and lay believers. Treatises on Buddhism
written and published by religious research institutions, eminent
monks and scholars include Collation and Studies of the Pattra
Sutra, Compilation of the Sanskrit Pattra Sutra Extant in Lhasa,
Studies of the Origin and Development of Religions and Religious
Sects in Tibet, The Reincarnation System of Living Buddhas,
History of Buddhism by Guta, Records of the Monasteries of the
Tibetan Bon Religion, Tibetan Buddhist Monasteries in China and
The Fresco Art of Tibet's Buddhist Monasteries.
</P>
<P>
 A total of 3,270 monks in Tibet have studied the Buddhist
classics in classes run by monasteries, and more than 50 Living
Buddhas, dGe-bshes (Buddhist doctors of divinity) and members of
the democratic management bodies of Tibetan temples and
monasteries have, in the past few years, taken advanced refresher
courses at the China Senior Buddhist Institute of Tibetan
Language in Beijing, half of whom have graduated.

 The state holds in great esteem the system of reincarnation
of Living Buddhas, which is characteristic of Tibetan Buddhism and
an important succession method of the leadership of Tibetan
Buddhism, and has profound respect for the religious practices
and historical conventions of Tibet's main religion. In 1992 the
Religious Affairs Bureau of the State Council approved the
succession of the 17th Karmapa Living Buddha, in accordance with
Tibet's religious practices. In 1995, a great event in the
Buddhist world came to pass when the rite of drawing lots from a
golden urn was carried out, and the boy who in Buddhist belief was
the reincarnation of the deceased 10th Panchen Lama was
identified, confirmed, given the title, enthroned and ordained as
the 11th Panchen Lama in accordance with the religious practices
and historical conventions and with the approval of the State
Council.
</P>
<P>
 Government departments at all levels treat all religions and
religious sects, as well as all people, whether religious
believers or not, in Tibet, equally and without any
discrimination. They respect and protect all religious activities
in accordance with the law. Religious and non-religious people,
and the different sects of Tibetan Buddhism, in harmonious
coexistence, also have mutual respect for each other. The
internal affairs of temples and monasteries are independently
handled by the management bodies formed through democratic
elections. Buddhist monks and nuns, on their own initiative, study
and debate the scriptures, attend lectures given by eminent monks,
perform Abhiseka (consecration by pouring water on the head) and
ordainment, disseminate Esoteric doctrines, perform Buddhist
ceremonies, chant scriptures in the presence of believers, release
the souls of the dead and pray for blessings by touching the
heads. Religious people have the freedom to make pilgrimages to
temples and monasteries, and holy mountains and lakes, including
circumambulation around holy mountains and spinning prayer
wheels. They are also free to offer sacrifices, give food or alms
to Buddhist monks and nuns, burn incense and chant
scriptures. Prayer banners, cairns of stones with scripture texts
painted or carved on them and religious people devoutly
prostrating themselves on the ground, spinning prayer wheels or on
pilgrimages can be seen everywhere in Tibet; and prayer niches and
shrines to Buddha can be found in the houses of almost all
religious people. It is estimated that more than one million
religious believers go to Jokhang Temple in Lhasa to pay homage
and burn incense to Buddha each year.

<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The price for the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) basket of seven crude oils
declined to 13.27 U.S. dollars per barrel Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics released on Monday by the secretariat
of OPEC, the price last week was 13.72 U.S. dollars per barrel.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said the international oil market is currently in
a slump. The price of crude oil is expected to continue its
decline until the weapon's inspection crisis in Iraq is resolved,
and the United Nations soften its restriction on Iraqi crude
exports.
</P>
<P>
The current price for crude oil is the lowest in four years,
lower than the 21 U.S. dollars per barrel price set by the
organization.

<HEADLINE> New Progress In Human Rights In Tibet (20) Concluding Remarks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Dalai Lama vilifies the present human rights situation in
Tibet. But, ironically, under his rule in old Tibet human rights
were wantonly trampled on in wide areas -- a crime stemming from
the dark, savage and cruel system of merging politics with
religion and the feudal serfdom. Making no mention whatsoever of
the situation where trampling the people's basic human rights was
commonplace in old Tibet, the exiled Dalai Lama has tried by every
means to cover it up and vilify and attack the development and
progress in new Tibet. He also fabricates sensational lies to
befuddle world opinion. One of the fundamental commandments of
Buddhism forbids the spreading of falsehoods. The Dalai Lama's
wanton fabrication of lies and his violation and trampling of this
commandment serve only to expose him in all his true colors: He is
waving the banner of religion to conduct activities aimed at
splitting the motherland.
</P>
<P>
 People of all ethnic groups in Tibet are constructing the new
Tibet with one heart and one mind. But since Tibet's economic and
social development, which started at a very low level, is hampered
by unfavorable natural conditions, such as its exceptional
elevation, frigid weather and lack of oxygen, Tibet remains
economically and socially underdeveloped. As a result, the human
rights enjoyed by the Tibetan people have yet to be further
improved. But the Central Government and Tibet's local governments
at all levels will continue to make painstaking efforts to promote
Tibet's economic and social development, consistently improve the
people's lives and further promote the progress of human rights in
Tibet.

<HEADLINE> Vietnamese PM: China's Exchange Experience Most Applicable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Vietnamese Prime Minister Phan
Van Khai said Monday that China's experience is "the most
applicable" for his country in its progress towards building and a
running stock market.
</P>
<P>
Khai made the remark at a meeting with a delegation of the
Chinese Securities Committee led by its vice president, Chen
Yaoxian.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese Prime Minister thanked the Chinese delegation
for the visit and for sharing with Vietnam the valuable experience
in building and running a stock market.
</P>
<P>
As both China and Vietnam shifted from a centralized economy to
a market economy along the lines of socialism under the leadership
of communist party, their paths in setting up and maintaining
stock markets had many similarities, Khai said.
</P>
<P>
"Vietnam is studying experience from many countries. However,
China's experience is the most applicable," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chen Yaoxian briefed his host on China's experience in building
and developing a stock market.
</P>

China was ready to assist Vietnam in this, particularly in the
training of experts, Chen said.

<P>
BEIJING, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The following is the full text
of a white paper entitled "New Progress in Human Rights in China's
Tibet Autonomous Region," released by the Information Office of
the State Council of the People's Republic of China here today.
</P>
<P>
New Progress in Human Rights in the Tibet Autonomous Region

Foreword
</P>
<P>
Tibet is a Tibetan autonomous region of the People's Republic
of China. Since it was officially incorporated into the domain of
China's Yuan Dynasty in the mid-13th century, Tibet has been under
the jurisdiction of China's Central Government as an inalienable
part of Chinese territory. Throughout history the diligent and
honest Tibetan people -- a member of the big multi-ethnic family
of China -- has made important contributions to the development
of the splendid Chinese civilization as well as to the unity and
unification of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
For long periods before 1959, however, Tibet had been a society
of feudal serfdom characterized by the merging of politics and
religion and the dictatorship of the clergy and nobility. The
serfs and slaves, who accounted for over 95 percent of the total
population in Tibet, had no personal freedom and were deprived of
their basic human rights. The Democratic Reform carried out in
Tibet in 1959 ended the history of a feudal serf system which
merged religion with politics, and gave the more than one million
serfs and slaves in Tibet, accounting for more than 95 percent of
the total population, the right to be their own masters. Following
the Democratic Reform, Tibet entered a new era of social
development and progress in human rights.
</P>
<P>
In September 1992 the Information Office of the State Council
of the People's Republic of China issued a white paper entitled
Tibet -- Its Ownership and Human Rights Situation. Drawing on a
rich store of facts, the white paper introduced and expounded on
the historical relations between Tibet and the big family of the
motherland in a comprehensive way, as well as the progress in
human rights in modern Tibet.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, thanks to the care and support of the Central
Government, the unstinted assistance from other parts of China and
the efforts of the people of all ethnic groups in Tibet, the
region's economic and social development has been remarkably
speeded up, thus further promoting the development of the cause of
human rights there. The development of the cause of human rights
in the Tibet Autonomous Region is an important component of the
new progress being made in human rights in China as a whole.
</P>
<P>
To understand and judge the human rights situation in Tibet,
it is necessary to ascertain the relevant facts. Accordingly, we
hereby present the facts about the new progress made in human
rights in the Tibet Autonomous Region since 1992.

<HEADLINE> New Progress in Human Rights in Tibet (2) I. Ethnic Regional Autonomy System and the People's Political Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tibet is an area where the Tibetans live in compact
communities, with people of the Tibetan ethnic group making up 95
percent of the total population of 2.44 million in the autonomous
region, and the people of the Han and other ethnic groups
accounting for only five percent. According to the Constitution of
the People's Republic of China, the state practices the ethnic
regional autonomy system in Tibet, which has been established as
the Tibet Autonomous Region, and safeguards, according to law, the
political rights of the people of all ethnic groups in Tibet to
participate in administration of state and local affairs on an
equal basis, especially the Tibetan people's autonomous right to
independently administer local and ethnic affairs. Practicing
ethnic regional autonomy in areas where people of ethnic
minorities live in compact communities is a major political
system of China and a basic policy of the Chinese Government for
solving problems relating to ethnic affairs.
</P>
<P>
In April 1956, the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet
Autonomous Region was set up in accordance with the Central
Government's decision. The Tibet Autonomous Region was formally
founded in 1965, with Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme as the first chairman
of the Region. As the organs of self-government, the Tibet
Autonomous Regional People's Congress and the Regional People's
Government exercise the power of autonomy according to law. In
accordance with the Chinese Constitution and the Law on Ethnic
Regional Autonomy, all areas entitled to ethnic regional autonomy
enjoy the extensive rights of autonomy, involving legislation, the
use of local spoken and written languages, the administration of
personnel, the economy, finance, education and culture, the
management and development of natural resources, and other aspects.
</P>
<P>
The Tibet Autonomous Regional People's Congress and its
Standing Committee -- the local organs of state power in Tibet --
fully exercise the power of autonomy bestowed by the Constitution
and law, and have actively formulated laws and regulations
appropriate to local ethnic and regional characteristics. Between
1965 and 1992 more than 60 local laws and regulations were worked
out, such as the Rules of Procedure of the People's Congress of
the Tibet Autonomous Region and the Regulations on the Study, Use
and Development of the Tibetan Language in the Tibet Autonomous
Region (for trial implementation). In recent years the Region has
formulated 23 local laws and regulations, made 21 legal decisions,
and cleared up or revised 23 laws and regulations involving
politics, the economy, culture, education, environmental
protection and other fields, including the Regulations of the
Tibet Autonomous Region on Environmental Protection, the
Regulations of the Tibet Autonomous Region on the Work of Town and
Township People's Congresses and the Regulations on Enhancing the
Examination and Supervision of the Implementation of the Laws and
Regulations.
</P>
<P>
In addition, rules for the implementation of 14 national laws
and regulations conforming to the local features of Tibet have
been drawn up. The legislative and administrative organs of the
Tibet Autonomous Region have designated the Tibetan New Year, the
Sholton and other traditional festivals of the Tibetan ethnic
group as the Region's holidays, in addition to the official
national holidays. In accordance with the special natural and
geographical conditions of Tibet, the autonomous region has
decreed a work week of no more than 35 hours, five hours less than
the official national work week for workers and staff. According
to statistics, the number of laws and regulations worked out since
1992 by the People's Congress of the Tibet Autonomous Region and
its Standing Committee to safeguard the interests of the Tibetan
people in light of the actual conditions in Tibet exceeds the
total formulated during the 12 years preceding 1992.

The chairman of the Standing Committee of the Tibet Autonomous
Regional People's Congress and the chairman of the Tibet
Autonomous Region are both citizens of the Tibetan ethnic
group. Both the Chinese Constitution and the Law on Ethnic
Regional Autonomy specify that the chairmen or vice-chairmen of
the standing committees of the people's congresses of ethnic
autonomous areas shall be citizens of the ethnic group or groups
exercising regional autonomy in the area concerned. The chairman
of an autonomous region, the governor of an autonomous prefecture
and the head of an autonomous county shall be a citizen of the
ethnic group exercising regional autonomy in the area
concerned. Since the founding of the Tibet Autonomous Region all
the four chairmen of the Standing Committee of the People's
Congress of the Tibet Autonomous Region and five chairmen of the
Region have been Tibetan citizens.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, members of the Tibetan and other
ethnic minorities now account for 71.4 percent of the chairman and
vice-chairmen of the Standing Committee of the People's Congress
of the Tibet Autonomous Region; for 80 percent of the members of
the Standing Committee of the Autonomous Regional People's
Congress; and for 77.8 percent of the chairman and vice-chairmen
of the Tibet Autonomous Region. After the election of members to
succeeding governments at the township (town), county, prefectural
(city) and autonomous regional levels in 1993, members of the
Tibetan and other ethnic minorities accounted for 93.2 percent of
the component members of the organs of state power at these four
levels, respectively for 99.8 percent and 98.6 percent of the
township (town) and county heads elected, and respectively 96
percent and 89 percent of the presidents of the people's courts
and the procurators of the people's procuratorates at the
autonomous regional, prefectural (city) and county levels. Further
progress has been made in the training and selection of cadres of
Tibetan and other ethnic minorities in Tibet since 1992. According
to 1996 statistics the number of cadres belonging to the Tibetan
and other ethnic minorities in Tibet had increased by 18.22
percent over the 1992 figure, making up 73.88 percent of the total
and showing an increase of 4.48 percentage points over the figure
for 1992.

<HEADLINE> Milosevic, U.S. Envoy Hold Talks on Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic met United States envoy Robert Gelbard Monday to
exchange views on the implementation of the Dayton agreement and
other issues regarding the peace process in the region.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have agreed that the Bosnian Serb government is
making an effort to improve economic and political conditions. The
stable operation of the government is important to the nation's
unity and economic development.
</P>
<P>
Both of them maintained that further enhancement of bilateral
relations between Yugoslavia and the United State would be
beneficial to the common interests of the two countries, and help
strengthen the peace process and stability of the region.
</P>
<P>
Robert Gelbard said Milosevic has made great contributions to
the implementation of the Dayton agreement, which was reached in
1995 in Dayton, Ohio, the U.S., by Presidents Slobodan Milosevic,
Franjo Tudjman of Croatia and alija Izetbegovic of Bosnia. The
agreement settled the Bosnian conflict, which has left 250,000
dead or missing.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic said Yugoslavia will continue to develop good
neighborly relations and economic ties with its neighboring
countries in a bid to enhance mutual understanding and trust in
the region.

Guaranteeing the study and use of the Tibetan language is an
important aspect of safeguarding the Tibetan people's right to
autonomy and exercising their right to participate in the
administration of state and local affairs. The Chinese
Constitution specifies that all ethnic groups have the freedom to
use and develop their own spoken and written languages. China's
Law on Ethnic Regional Autonomy stipulates that in performing
their functions, the organs of self-government of every ethnic
autonomous area, in accordance with the regulations on the
exercise of autonomy in those areas, employ the spoken and
written languages or languages in common use in the
locality. Accordingly, the Regulations on the Study, Use and
Development of the Tibetan Language (for trial implementation)
adopted by the Tibet Autonomous Regional People's Congress clearly
specifies that both Tibetan and Chinese should be used in the
Tibet Autonomous Region, with precedence given to the Tibetan
language. The Tibetan language is the common language for the
whole autonomous region. The resolutions, laws, regulations and
decrees adopted by the people's congresses, and official
documents and proclamations issued by governments at all levels in
the Region are in both Tibetan and Chinese. In court cases
involving Tibetans, the Tibetan language must be used in hearing
cases, and legal documents must be written in the Tibetan
language. Newspapers, magazines, and radio and television stations
also use both Tibetan and Chinese languages. All signs and marks
of government institutions, streets, roads and public facilities
are in both Tibetan and Chinese scripts. Tibetan academic,
cultural and art workers have the right to write and publish their
academic or artistic works in their own language.
</P>
<P>
The implementation of the ethnic regional autonomy system has
further guaranteed the political rights of the Tibetan people,
which is in marked contrast to the situation in old Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Before the Democratic Reform of 1959 Tibet had long been a
society languishing under a system of feudal serfdom which
intertwined politics with religion, a society which was even
darker than the European society of the Middle Ages. The serfs and
slaves, making up 95 percent of the total population of Tibet,
were completely deprived of personal freedom and political
rights. The serf owners considered serfs and slaves as their
private property, so they could trade and transfer them, present
them as gifts, make them mortgages for debts and exchange
them. It was not until 1959 that the 13-Article Code and
16-Article Code, which had been practiced for several hundred
years in old Tibet, were abolished, by which codes the Tibetan
people were divided, in explicit terms, into three classes and
nine ranks and put on an unequal footing in legal status. The
codes specified that the lives of people of the highest rank of
the upper class, such as a prince, were literally worth their
weight in gold, whereas the lives of people of the lowest rank of
the lower class, such as women, butchers, hunters and craftsmen,
were worth no more than the price of a straw rope. The serf owners
safeguarded the feudal serfdom with savage punishments; they would
frequently punish serfs and slaves by gouging out their eyes,
cutting off their ears, arms or legs, drowning them or inflicting
other terrible penalties.

Since the Democratic Reform abolished the feudal serf system,
the Tibetan people, like the people of all other ethnic groups
throughout the country, have become the masters of their state and
society, and won the political rights enjoyed by all citizens as
stipulated in the Chinese Constitution and law.
</P>
<P>
All citizens in Tibet who have reached the age of 18 have the
right to vote and stand for election, regardless of ethnic group,
race, sex, occupation, family background, religious belief,
education, property status or length of residence. They elect
their own deputies and exercise the power to administer state and
local affairs through the people's congresses elected by
them. According to statistics, in 1993 when the succeeding
township, county, prefectural (city) and autonomous regional
people's congresses were elected, Tibet had 1,311,085 voters,
making up 98.6 percent of all citizens at or above 18 years of
age, 91.6 percent of whom participated in the elections. In some
places 100 percent of the voters took part in the
elections. Meanwhile, the Chinese Constitution and Electoral Law
clearly specify that the National People's Congress, the highest
organ of state power, should include an appropriate number of
ethnic minority deputies. The Electoral Law contains special
regulations to promote the election of deputies from among ethnic
minorities. For example, it stipulates that where the total
population of an ethnic minority in an area where that ethnic
minority lives in concentrated communities exceeds 30 percent of
the total local population, the number of people represented by
each deputy of that ethnic minority shall be equal to the number
of people represented by each of the other deputies to the local
people's congress; and that where the total population of an
ethnic minority in such an area is less than 15 percent of the
total local population, the number of people represented by each
deputy of that ethnic minority may appropriately be less than the
number of people represented by each of the other deputies to the
local people's congress. The ethnic minorities, who make up 8
percent of the total population in China, now account for well
over 14 percent of the total number of deputies to the National
People's Congress. At present, Tibet has 20 deputies to the Ninth
National People's Congress, 80 percent of whom are from the
Tibetan or other ethnic minorities. Though the Moinba, Lhoba and
other ethnic minorities in Tibet have small populations, each of
them has its own deputies to the National People's Congress as
well as to the people's congresses at all levels in Tibet. The
Living Buddha Phabala Geleg Namgyal is vice-chairman of the
Standing Committee of the Eighth National People's Congress.

Personages of all strata and all circles in Tibet also
participate in the administration and discussion of state affairs,
and exercise their democratic rights through attending the
political consultative conferences at all levels. Now a number of
personages of ethnic minorities origin and religious figures from
Tibet are members of the National Committee of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) or its Standing
Committee, with Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme serving as vice-chairman of
the CPPCC National Committee. Since its founding in 1959, the
CPPCC Tibetan Committee has recruited large numbers of people of
the Tibetan and other ethnic minorities, as well as religious
figures. Now several hundred ethnic-minority people and religious
figures are members of the CPPCC Tibet Committee. Even some people
who were nobles of the old Tibetan government, such as Lhalu
Tsewang Dorje and Domed Konchok Palmo, are currently vice-chairmen
of the Regional Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region's
Political Consultative Conference. The legal codes of old Tibet
stipulated: "Women are not to be granted the right to discuss
state affairs." This situation is now no longer to be found in new
Tibet. In 1996 female deputies to the Tibet Autonomous Region
People's Congress made up 20 percent of the total. Now Tibet has
573 women cadres at or above the county level, and some Tibetan
female judges, procurators, police officers and lawyers for the
first time in Tibetan history.
</P>
<P>
Most staff members of the judiciary of the Tibet Autonomous
Region are Tibetans or members of local ethnic
minorities. Strictly in accordance with the Constitution and laws,
the judicial departments of the Tibet Autonomous Region protect
the basic rights and freedoms, and other legal rights and
interests of the citizens of all ethnic groups in Tibet. They also
protect public property and the lawful private property of the
citizens, punish those law-breakers who endanger society, and
maintain social order according to law. Both the crime and
imprisonment rates of the Tibet Autonomous Region are lower than
the nation's average. The legal rights of criminals are protected
by law, and those who belong to ethnic minorities or religious
sects are not discriminated against, but due consideration is
given to their lifestyles and customs. The government guarantees
the provision of food, clothing, shelter and articles of daily use
for prison inmates. Each prison in Tibet has separate dining
facilities and diets for inmates of different ethnic groups and
provides for them Zanba (roasted highland barley flour), buttered
tea, sweet tea, etc. every month. Each prison has a clinic, and
the number of prison doctors is higher than the nation's
average. Criminals enjoy rest days, holidays and traditional
ethnic festivals, in accordance with the state's unified
regulations. Prisoners may see visitors every month, may win a
reduction of penalty or be released on parole, and may be given
various awards according to law.

<TEXT>
<P>
Speeding up Tibet's economic construction, continuously
improving the life of the Tibetan people, and ensuring that they
fully enjoy the rights to existence and development are the
Central Government's primary goals for its work in Tibet. They
are also the most important tasks of governments at all levels in
the Tibet Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Outstanding achievements have been made in this regard through
the unstinted efforts of the Central Government and the
governments at all levels in the Region.
</P>
<P>
Since 1992 the Tibetan economy has increased rapidly. In 1997
the GDP of Tibet amounted to about 7.35 billion yuan-worth, an
increase of 96.6 percent compared to 1991 at constant prices or
an average annual increase of 11.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Since 1987 Tibet has reaped bumper harvests for 10 years in
succession. The total grain output was 820,000 tons in 1997, the
highest output in Tibetan history and an increase of 41.4 percent
compared to the 580,000 tons in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The output of meat was 119,000 tons in 1997, an increase of
25.5 percent compared to 1991. Now the people of the Tibet
Autonomous Region are working hard to attain the goal of getting
rid of poverty throughout the region and achieving comfortable
lives for most of the people before the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Since 1992 the building of the parts of the infrastructure
closely related to people's everyday life and production, such as
communications, energy and telecommunications, and the development
of construction, building materials, foodstuffs, traditional
handicrafts, textile and other light industries have been
quickened.
</P>
<P>
The Gonggar Airport in Lhasa has been extended, and the Bamda
Airport in Qamdo has been rebuilt. Now there are scheduled flights
to other cities in China from airports in Tibet every day and some
weekly international flights.
</P>
<P>
A comprehensive network of communications and transportation
consisting of air routes and highways has been basically
completed in Tibet. The volume of goods transported via highways
in the Region increased 15.6 times in 1996 compared to 1965 and
the number of highway passengers has increased by 28.9 times in
the same period. The average number of passengers transported by
airplanes is 100,000 each year. So transportation conditions have
been greatly improved, in striking contrast to the old days when
the region was very hard to reach and goods had to be carried in
on the backs of animals or people.

Satellite telecommunications stations have been built in seven
prefectures or cities in Tibet, and program-controlled telephone
systems are in use in 51 counties. Satellite transmission and
program-controlled telephones are being used in about 98 percent
of the counties in Tibet, which is now connected with the
international and domestic long-distance telephone automatic
exchange networks.
</P>
<P>
Urban construction has been speeded up in major cities
and towns, such as Lhasa, Xigaze, Nagqu, Qamdo, Zetang and
Shiquanhe. Since the 1980s more than 300,000 sq m of old
residential houses have been rebuilt in Lhasa, and 5,226
households have moved to new dwellings. All this has improved the
living environment and quality of life of both urban and rural
residents.
</P>
<P>
Economic development in Tibet began on an exceedingly
primitive and backward foundation. Its natural environment is
unfavorable for economic development because of its
4,000-odd-meter altitude, severe cold weather and thin air.
</P>
<P>
In addition, under the rule of the feudal serfdom in old Tibet
the economy in the region was extremely backward and the living
standards of the people there were low. In view of all this, the
Central Government has always attached special importance to the
development of Tibet by providing generous assistance in manpower,
materials, financial resources and technologies.
</P>
<P>
In addition, preferential policies have been adopted in line
with the region's actual conditions. No levies have been imposed
on the peasants and herdsmen in Tibet since 1980 and there is no
compulsory state purchase of grain there.
</P>
<P>
The income that Tibetan peasants and herdsmen earn is entirely
their own. In recent years the central government has allocated
upwards of 1.2 billion yuan each year to Tibet as a financial
subsidy, and other favorable measures have been adopted, such as
lightening its financial burdens, preferential investment,
investment in skill training and an aid-the-poor program.
</P>
<P>
From the early 1950s to 1997 the Central Government allocated
more than 40 billion yuan for Tibet, and from 1959 to 1996
allotted 6.74 million tons of materials. Among the latter were 1.1
million tons of commercial materials, 1.3 million tons of grain
and 1.48 million tons of oil.
</P>
<P>
The state has also given large-scale additional assistance to
key and special projects in Tibet in different economic and social
development periods. In 1984 some 43 projects were built for Tibet
by nine provinces and municipalities mobilized and directed by the
Central Government, and in 1994 the Central Government decided to
build gratis another 62 projects for Tibet within three or four years,
also with the cooperation of other provinces and municipalities of
the country, involving agriculture and water conservancy, energy,
communications and telecommunications, industry, and social welfare
and municipal engineering.
</P>
<P>
Now almost all the projects have been completed and put into
use. The actual total investment was 3.66 billion yuan, much more
than the planned investment of 2.38 billion yuan.

The comprehensive project for the development of the middle
valleys of the Yarlungzangbo, Lhasa and Nyangqu rivers, in which
the Central Government invested a fund to the tune of one billion
yuan, was put into practice in 1991, and since then both the grain
yield and the net per-capita income of the peasants and herdsmen
in the development area have increased by a wide margin.
</P>
<P>
The Yamzhoyum Lake pumped-storage power station, a project
with state investments running to 2.014 billion yuan, was
completed and put into operation in 1997.
</P>
<P>
In recent years another 151 projects have been built or are
being built in Tibet by 14 other provinces and municipalities,
with a total investment of 490 million yuan. The completion of
these projects will push the economic development of Tibet and
the living standards of both its urban and rural residents a
still bigger step forward.
</P>
<P>
The development of the economy has tangibly improved the lives
of all people in Tibet. In 1996 the average annual per capita
income that urban residents used for living expenses was 5,030
yuan, 2.4 times that of 1991, showing an average annual increase
of 19 percent; the average per capita net income of peasants and
herdsmen was 975 yuan, an increase of 48.3 percent compared to
1991 and an average annual increase of 8.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, income of the above two types was 5,130 yuan and
1,040 yuan respectively. By the end of 1997 the bank savings
deposits of both urban and rural people in Tibet were 3.045
billion yuan, while in 1991 they had been only 510 million
yuan.
</P>
<P>
In 1996 the average amount of grain owned by each Tibetan was
372 kg, an increase of 28 percent over 1991. Though the population
in 1996 was 2.5 times that in the early 1950s, the amount of
grain per capita in Tibet was three times that in the early
1950s.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the average per capita consumption of meat in Tibet
was 48.6 kilograms, an increase of 17.2 percent compared to
1991. In 1996 the average per capita consumption of vegetables by
urban dwellers in Tibet had increased by 26 percent and that of
edible oil by 14.5 percent over the 1991 figures. Other increases
in that year were 2.1 times for eggs and 4.2 times for sweets and
cakes.
</P>
<P>
In tandem with the development of the economy, the household
property owned by both urban and rural people in Tibet has
increased steadily. The peasant and herdsman households own large
amounts of means of production, and the average fixed assets for
production purpose are worth more than 8,000 yuan per
household.
</P>
<P>
There are 9 motor vehicles, 6 big or small tractors, 3
threshing machines and 12 horse-carts per 100 households. The
numbers of electrical household appliances and other durable
goods are increasing each year in urban families.
</P>
<P>
In 1996 there were 88 color TV sets, 6 black and white TV
sets, 42 washing machines, 50 refrigerators, 46 cameras, 9
motorcycles and 222 bicycles per 100 urban families -- all these
figures being huge increases compared to 1991.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics of the old local government of Tibet,
about 90 percent of the Tibetan population had no residential
houses of their own in 1950, but now, except for people living in
a small number of pastoral areas, all families have their own
permanent houses.

From 1990 to 1995 the per capita living space of rural and
urban people increased, respectively, from 18.9 sq m to 20 sq m
and from 11 sq m to 14 sq m. According to surveys of the middle
valleys of the Yarlungzangbo, Lhasa and Nyangqu rivers, some of
the peasant families have enough surplus grain to last them for up
to three years. Moreover, in some townships 90 percent of the
peasant families have built new houses.
</P>
<P>
Some people in remote areas of the Tibet Autonomous Region
still live fairly impoverished lives. The governments at all
levels in the Region, according to the instructions and
requirements of the Central Government, are implementing a
help-the-poor plan to actively assist the local people to raise
the level of production so as to get rid of poverty and become
well-off.
</P>
<P>
In 1996 alone, the autonomous region earmarked 114 million yuan
for the help-the-poor drive. In September 1997, when blizzards
rarely seen in local histories hit some of the areas, particularly
northern Tibet, causing severe hardship to the peasants and
herdsmen in productive work and daily lives, the State Council
held a special meeting to discuss how to aid the disaster victims
there.
</P>
<P>
By January 1998 the Central Government had allocated a total of
42 million yuan in relief funds and transported a large amount of
materials to the disaster areas. In addition, the State Council
sent officials to the disaster areas to express sympathy and
solicitude for the people, inspect the disaster areas and help
solve difficulties.
</P>
<P>
The governments at all levels in the Tibet Autonomous Region
devoted a large amount of manpower, materials and capital to the
disaster relief work. All this has gone a long way toward
relieving the difficulties brought by the blizzards to the
peasants and herdsmen in productive work and daily lives.
</P>
<P>
To ensure a favorable living environment for the people of all
ethnic groups and improve their quality of life, the Tibet
Autonomous Region strictly implements the state's laws and
regulations concerning environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
Since 1992 the autonomous region has formulated and promulgated
more than 20 local laws and regulations, and administrative rules
on eco-environmental protection, including the Regulations of the
Tibet Autonomous Region on Environmental Protection. In 1990 the
Region's first modern environmental monitoring station was set up
in Lhasa, which was followed by the Xigaze Environmental
Monitoring Station set up in 1993. Other monitoring stations are
being constructed so as to gradually form a region-wide
environmental monitoring network.

Monitoring results show low discharge of the "three industrial
wastes" (waste gas, waste water and industrial residue) in
Tibet: The smoke and dust elimination rate of industrial waste
gas has reached 88 percent, and more than 50 percent of
industrial waste water has been effectively treated. The quality
of the water in the Region's major rivers is up to the state's
first-class standard for the environmental quality of surface
water.
</P>
<P>
Most lakes in Tibet are still in a pristine state, with the
quality of water within the state's standards. In general, the
quality of underground water is good. So far not a single
environmental pollution accident has occurred in Tibet, and no
acid rain has fallen in the Region, let alone any man-made
radiation pollution.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the monitoring findings achieved by the environmental
protection departments over the years have proved that the natural
radiation level in Tibet is within the standards specified by the
state's radiation protection regulations.
</P>
<P>
The fact that the Tibetan people fully enjoy the rights to
existence and development presents a sharp contrast to the
miserable conditions in old Tibet where poverty and backwardness
prevailed and the people's right to existence was not
guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
The feudal serf system that mingled politics with religion in
old Tibet seriously hindered the development of the social
productive forces. Therefore, for a long time its economy was in a
primitive and backward state. Wooden plows were used for
agricultural production and yaks were used for threshing. In some
places the slash-and-burn method of farming was common. In 1952
the average grain yield per mu (one ha equals 15 mu) was 80 kg and
there were only 125 kg of grain per person.
</P>
<P>
In the old days Tibet had almost no industry in the modern
sense of the word, and in fact in 1950 it only had one bunthouse
of a mint and one 125 kwh hydropower station that generated power
only off and on. At that time there were only 120 workers in the
whole of Tibet. Even so, more than 95 percent of the social wealth
was concentrated in the hands of the three major categories of
feudal lords -- government officials, nobles and senior monks,
who accounted for less than five percent of the population of
Tibet, and the common people, who accounted for 95 percent of the
population were extremely poor.
</P>
<P>
There was a saying in old Tibet: "Slaves can only take their
shadows away with them and leave only their footprints behind.''
The broad masses of slaves and serfs did not have any personal
freedom, and even their right to life was not guaranteed. Before
the Democratic Reform in 1959 the population of Lhasa, the capital
of Tibet, was just over 20,000, of whom some 1,000 households were
impoverished or begged their living in the streets. It often
happened that homeless people died on the roadside because of
hunger and cold. But this appalling situation will never appear
again in Tibet.

<TEXT>
<P>
Since the beginning of the 1990s educational, cultural and
health work in Tibet has been further improved, and this has
further promoted the people's right to education, culture and
health protection.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Government has adopted many preferential policies
to promote education in Tibet. Boarding schools have been
introduced in rural and pastoral areas, where Tibetan primary and
middle school students enjoy free food, clothing and
accommodation. Stipend and scholarship systems have been put in
place step by step in primary and middle schools above the town
level. The principle of ``giving priority to people of local
ethnic groups'' has been adopted by all schools while recruiting
students in Tibet, and a flexible enrollment method adopted in
dealing with examinees of Tibetan and other ethnic minorities
origin, whereby ``the pass marks for admission are appropriately
lowered and students are chosen on the basis of their test
results.''
</P>
<P>
Currently, a fairly complete modern education system is being
operated in the Tibet Autonomous Region, and education is being
spread to wider areas in the Region. According to 1997 statistics,
4,251 regular and village-run primary schools had been established
in Tibet, with a total enrollment of 300,453 students. In 1997,
78.2 percent of school-age children were in school, a 32.6
percentage point increase over 1991. There are 90 secondary
schools in Tibet, with 17,155 more students enrolled than in
1991. There are also four institutions of higher learning and 16
special secondary schools in Tibet. The illiteracy rate among the
young and middle-aged has dropped by 41 percentage points as
compared with the figure before the peaceful liberation of Tibet.
</P>
<P>
From 1991 to 1997 a total of 580,000 sq m of new schools were
built in Tibet, including 27 secondary schools, 278 regular
township primary schools and 1,359 village-run primary schools,
and a total of over 300,000 sq m of old school buildings
renovated. In recent years the government has been investing more
and more in education in Tibet. In 1997 such investment accounted
for 18 percent equally of the budgeted expenditure and budgeted
capital construction investment. These facts are in strong
contrast to the situation in Tibet before peaceful liberation,
when only a small number of monk officials and children of the
nobility had the privilege of studying and less than two percent
of the school-age children went to school; education was denied to
the masses of serfs and slaves.

Since the mid-1980s, to make it easier for secondary school
students from Tibet to study in other parts of China, the Central
Government has appropriated special funds to set up Tibetan junior
middle-school classes in some of the provinces and municipalities
in the hinterland and one Tibetan middle school each in the cities
of Beijing, Tianjin and Chengdu. Transportation, food and board,
clothing and medical care expenses of the Tibetan students in
those schools are covered by the government. The Central
Government has allocated a special capital construction fund
totalling 73 million yuan and relevant provinces and
municipalities have appropriated necessary funds amounting to well
over 100 million yuan for running those Tibetan classes and
schools in the hinterland. In addition, the Central Government has
appropriated an annual six million yuan and relevant provinces and
municipalities have set aside a special fund from their budgets to
cover the study and living expenses of the Tibetan students in
inland regions. From 1985 to 1997 a total of 18,000 Tibetan
students had studied in all these Tibetan classes and schools, of
whom more than 5,000 have graduated from special secondary
schools, colleges and universities and returned to Tibet to take
part in the development of the Region. At present, there are
13,000 Tibetan students studying in more than 100 schools in 26
inland provinces and municipalities.
</P>
<P>
The essence of traditional Tibetan culture is a component part
of Chinese national culture and the government has always attached
great importance to protecting and developing it and helping it
flourish.
</P>
<P>
With its distinctive ethnic characteristics, Tibetological
research, which plays an important role in inheriting and
developing the essence of traditional Tibetan culture, has
received attention and support from the state. Currently, there
are over 50 Tibetan studies institutes all over the country, with
over 2,000 people engaged in such research and related auxiliary
work. The state has set up the Chinese Center for Tibetan Studies
in the nation's capital Beijing, and there are a dozen Tibetan
studies institutes in Tibet itself, which have completed over 100
significant research projects. In recent years Tibetan studies
institutes in China have held more than 60 seminars, single- or
multi-disciplinary, on Tibetan history, language, religion,
ethnology, philosophy, literature, art, education, calendar and
traditional medicine. More than 300 significant projects have been
completed and more than 400 books on Tibetan studies have been
published or are about to be published. Books such as A General
History of Tibet and Mirror of Tibetan History, written by
scholars belonging to the Tibetan ethnic group, have received
praise from home and abroad.

The Chinese Government attaches great importance to using and
developing the Tibetan language in the Tibet Autonomous Region
and has taken concrete measures to guarantee the freedom of the
Tibetan people to use and develop both the spoken and written
Tibetan language, which is a main course of study at all schools
in Tibet as well as in special Tibetan classes and schools in
other parts of the country. Tibetan students are required to read
and write the Tibetan language proficiently upon graduation from
middle schools. Tibet has finished the editing and translation of
500 kinds of primary and middle school teaching materials for the
compulsory education stage. The editing, translating into Tibetan
and publishing of a catalogue of technical materials has started,
as has the work on the collection and collation of technical
materials in the Tibetan language. In order to promote the
normalization, standardization and modernization of information
processing in Tibetan, the Region has been working on drawing up
international standards for Tibetan character coding using
information technology since 1994, which has received strong
support from related departments of the state. The research
project was approved at the conference of international standards
verification for multi-language coding held in Copenhagen,
Denmark, in 1996. This has laid a good foundation for
Tibetan-language access to modern information processing and
network exchange. In 1995 a committee for the standardization of
Tibetan terminology was set up to standardize the Tibetan language
and normalize social terms.
</P>
<P>
Great importance has been continuously attached to traditional
Tibetan medicine and pharmacology. There are 14 Tibetan medicine
institutions in the Region, and Tibetan medicine is available in
over 60 hospitals at the county level. At present, Tibetan
medicine establishments at all levels throughout Tibet give over
500,000 out-patient consultations annually. A total of 100,000 kg
in over 350 varieties of finished Tibetan pharmaceuticals is
produced each year. Some one dozen valuable Tibetan herbs have won
national gold or silver medals or prizes at international
conferences on traditional medicine.
</P>
<P>
The work to systematically investigate, collect, record,
collate, study, compile and publish the traditional cultural
heritage of Tibet on a large scale is continuing apace. With over
800,000 words and some 300 pictures, the Chinese Drama: Tibetan
Volume was published in December, 1993. The 1.37-million-word
Collections of Chinese Folk Songs: Tibetan Volume was published
in 1995. A 10-volume collection of Tibetan folk and religious
arts is to be published one volume at a time. The popular "Life
of King Gesar," the oral epic of the Tibetan people handed down
for generations by ballad singers, has been included in the
Region's key research projects, with a special institute founded
to take charge of collecting more than 5,000 cassettes and
several hundred video tapes dealing with the epic. In addition,
over 40 million words have been collated, and more than 1,000
research papers and over 30 books on the "Life of King Gesar have
been published. This long-scattered oral literature is becoming a
systematic, monumental literary work for the first time. Many
Tibetan scholars and people in Tibetan religious circles have
acclaimed it as "realizing the ardent wish of the Tibetan people
of all generations." The Tibetan Ancient Books Publishing House
was set up in the Region with state funds to take charge of
collecting, editing and publishing Tibetan ancient books. A large
number of Tibetan ancient books, inscribed wooden slips and
inscriptions on bronzes and stone tablets -- including the only
existing copy of the Dewu's History of Buddhism (about the
history of the Tibetan people), Selected Tibetan Laws and
Regulations of All Periods, Selected Books and Records on Tibetan
Handicrafts, Selected Works on Medicine, and Selected Tibetan
Historical Relics, as well as others, have been put under state
protection.

Beginning in the early 1990s, the survey of traditional relics
in the Tibet Autonomous Region is almost finished, with cultural
relics found in 1,768 places. Large numbers of rare cultural
relics have been put under full protection. Since the 1960s the
State Council has put 18 key historical sites in Tibet under state
protection and determined 67 key historical sites under regional
protection. The famous Potala Palace was inscribed on the World
Heritage List by UNESCO in 1994. The Tibet Autonomous Region
Archives is one of the best establishments for keeping local
archives in China. The Tibetan Museum, funded by the state to the
tune of more than 90 million yuan and with a total floor space of
22,500 sq m, was opened in October, 1997.

The people of the Tibet Autonomous Region have full rights to
create and enjoy culture. There are 35 multi-purpose people's art
and cultural centers and more than 380 rural cultural centers and
clubs. A film projection and releasing network covers both urban
and rural areas, including 650 local units, giving free film shows
to people in agricultural and pastoral areas. In 1996, a total of
25 films in over 500 copies were dubbed in Tibetan. Since the
beginning of the 1990s a total of more than 630 films in upwards
of 8,500 copies have been dubbed in Tibetan. Meanwhile, Tibet has
four book and audio-visual publishing houses, among them the
Tibetan People's Publishing House has published 76.94 million
copies of books of 6,589 titles. There are 23 Tibetan-language
newspapers and magazines in public circulation. By 1996, Tibet had
two radio stations, two TV stations, 35 radio broadcasting,
relaying and transmitting stations, 240 television transponder
stations and over 700 ground satellite receiving stations. The
Tibet Autonomous Region Library, set up at a cost of nearly 100
million yuan, was opened in June 1996. It has 590,000 books,
including more than 100,000 well-collated and well-preserved
Tibetan ancient books.

The Tibetan people enjoy a cultural life which is becoming more
and more prosperous and full of Tibetan characteristics. Now Tibet
boasts a contingent of more than 10,000 literary and art workers,
with Tibetans as the mainstay, 10 professional art and dance
ensembles, 15 small professional performance teams, and over 160
amateur art ensembles and Tibetan opera troupes. People in rural
areas can often enjoy free performances given by these
professional troupes. In addition, there are another 11 special
folk art education and study institutes and literature and art
organizations. In 1996 professional Tibetan literature and art
works and performances won one international prize and 10 national
prizes. During major traditional Tibetan festivals and
celebrations, such as the Tibetan New Year, the Sholton Festival,
the Great Butter Festival and the Wangkor Festival, varied and
colorful folk song and dance performances can be seen all over
Tibet. Since the early 1990s more than 30 Tibetan song and dance
troupes, art ensembles and academic delegations have visited,
given performances, engaged in academic exchanges, and held
exhibitions on Tibetan historical relics, books, arts, costume and
handicrafts in more than 30 countries and regions, including the

The Central Government and Tibetan governments at all levels
are greatly concerned about the health of the Tibetan
people. After many years of effort, a basic medical and public
health network now covers the whole of the Tibet Autonomous
Region. By the end of 1997 Tibet had 1,324 medical and health
establishments, 127 more than in 1991; 6,246 hospital beds, 1,169
beds more than in 1991, averaging some 2.5 beds per 1,000 people;
10,929 medical and health personnel, 1,189 more than in 1991;
1.84 doctors and 0.7 nurse per 1,000 people; and 4,402 rural
medical and health personnel, a 24.46 percent increase. Old Tibet,
under the feudal serfdom, had only three officially operated,
small traditional Tibetan medical establishments, with only crude
medical equipment, and a few private clinics, employing fewer than
 100 medical practitioners. Even including folk doctors of
traditional Tibetan medicine, the number totalled only about
400.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's foreign exchange
reserves have risen to 1.83 billion U.S. dollars after a
staggering decline over the past year, press reports said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The amount was registered on February 18, showing an upward
trend, the country's central bank, the Bangladesh Bank, was quoted
as saying on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The country's foreign exchange reserves were 1.71 billion
dollars at the end of June 1997, and slightly rose to 1.73 billion
dollars at the end of January 1998.
</P>
<P>
The bank attributed the increase in foreign exchange reserves
to growing export earnings and remittance of Bangladeshi wage
earners in other countries.
</P>
<P>
It hoped to further boost the reserves to 2 billion dollars at
the end of June.

In Tibet a preferential medical policy is being carried
out. Medical treatment is free in farming and pastoral areas, and
is financed jointly by personal medical insurance and the state in
cities and towns. From 1992 to 1997 the Central Government and
governments at different levels in Tibet disbursed 964.61 million
yuan in expenditures for public medical services.
</P>
<P>
Much attention has also been devoted to the medical and health
care of women and children in Tibet. By the end of 1996 a total of
34 maternity and child care centers and eight baby-friendly
hospitals had been set up. In addition, 108 hospitals at and
above the county level now have departments of gynecology and
obstetrics, and 110 key townships have maternity and child care
departments which have monitored the development of more than
250,000 children and given general surveys and treatments of
common and frequently-occurring diseases among them. Since 1986
about 85 percent of the children in Tibet have received BCG
vaccine inoculations or drugs and inoculations against
poliomyelitis, pertussis, diphtheria, tetanus and measles. Now
51.25 percent of children in the Region below the age of seven
benefit from the local health care system specially for
children. Besides, modern delivery methods are available for 50.8
percent of child-bearing women in Tibet, and the rate reaches 100
percent in Lhasa. In the Region's counties where children's health
projects have been carried out, the infant mortality rate has
decreased from 91.8 per thousand in 1989 to 55.21 per thousand
now.
</P>
<P>
The sanitation and health conditions of today's Tibet and those
of the old Tibet cannot be mentioned in the same breath. Smallpox
was eradicated early in the 1960s, and some other dangerous
infectious and endemic diseases have also been effectively
controlled or wiped out. In 1996 the overall incidence of and the
mortality resulting from 14 infectious diseases, such as typhoid
fever, hepatitis, epidemic encephalitis and influenza, dropped by
45.52 and 67.16 percent, respectively, compared with the 1991
figures. By 1995 poliomyelitis had been totally eliminated. The
government of the Tibet Autonomous Region is determined to keep in
step with the other areas of China and stamp out diseases caused
by iodine deficiency by the year 2000. In the old Tibet, deadly
infectious diseases such as smallpox and the plague were
endemic. It is recorded that during the 150 years before Tibet was
peacefully liberated there were four pandemic outbreaks of
smallpox, one of which, in 1925, killed 7,000 people in the Lhasa
area alone. Outbreaks of typhoid fever in 1934 and 1937 carried
off a total of some 5,000 people in Lhasa.
</P>
<P>
The steady improvement of health care and living standards has
raised the average life expectancy of Tibetans from 36 years in
the old Tibet to the present 65 years. At the same time, the
population of Tibet has increased rapidly and the protracted
stagnation of population growth in the old days has changed
completely. According to a thoroughgoing census carried out in
Tibet during the period 1734-1736 by the Central Government of
the Qing Dynasty, the population at that time was 941,200. About
two hundred years later, in 1953, the local government of Tibet
declared its population to be one million. That is to say, the
population of Tibet was almost at a standstill for some two
hundred years, only slightly rising by 58,000 people. But in the
40 years from 1953 to 1993, after Tibet was peacefully liberated,
the population grew from one million to well over 2.3 million, of
which the population of Tibetans increased by 1.16 million, or a
more than two-fold increase in 40 years. By the end of 1996 the
population of Tibet had reached 2.44 million, 95 percent of whom
were Tibetans. This lays bare the lie that "The population of
Tibet is decreasing," refutes the bluster about "Tibetans
suffering from genocide" emanating from the Dalai Lama and some
Western sources, and illuminates, from one aspect, the human
rights situations in the new and old Tibet.

<HEADLINE> Human Rights in Tibet in Progress: White Paper (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 24 (Xinhua) -- A host of facts show clearly
that human rights in the Tibet Autonomous Region are making
unceasing progress, said a white paper issued here today by the
Information Office of the State Council.
</P>
<P>
Entitled "New Progress in Human Rights in the Tibet Autonomous
Region", the white paper noted that the Central Government and the
local governments at all levels in the Tibet Autonomous Region
have made great efforts to safeguard and promote the progress of
human rights in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
The white paper, which falls in some 13,000 Chinese characters,
consists of four parts: Ethnic Regional Autonomy System and the
People's Political Rights; Economic Development and the People's
Rights to Existence and Development; the People Enjoy the Rights
to Education, Culture and Health Protection; the Right to Freedom
of Religious Belief.
</P>
<P>
It is the second white paper on Tibet issued by the Information
Office of the State Council. In September 1992, the Information
Office of the State Council issued a white paper titled Tibet --
Its Ownership and Human Rights Situation.
</P>
<P>
The newly issued white paper said that Tibet is a Tibetan
autonomous region of the People's Republic of China. Since it was
officially incorporated into the domain of China's Yuan Dynasty
in the mid-13th century, Tibet has been under the jurisdiction of
China's Central Government as an inalienable part of Chinese
territory.
</P>
<P>
However, it said, for long periods before 1959, Tibet had been
a society of feudal serfdom characterized by the merging of
politics, religion and the dictatorship of the clergy and
nobility. The serfs and slaves, who accounted for over 95 percent
of the total population in Tibet, had no personal freedom and
were deprived of their basic human rights.
</P>
<P>
The white paper said that the Democratic Reform carried out in
Tibet in 1959 ended the history of a feudal serf system which
merged religion with politics, and gave the more than one million
serfs and slaves in Tibet, accounting for more than 95 percent of
the total population, the right to be their own masters.
</P>
<P>
Following the Democratic Reform, Tibet entered a new era of
social development and progress in human rights, the white paper
said.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, thanks to the care and support of the Central
Government, the unstinted assistance from other parts of China and
the efforts of the people of all ethnic groups in Tibet, the Region's
economic and social development has been remarkably speeded up, thus
further promoting the development of the cause of human rights
there, the white paper said.

<P>
The Tibet Autonomous Region was formally founded in 1965. As
the organs of self-government, the Tibet Autonomous Regional
People's Congress and the Regional People's Government exercise
the power of autonomy according to law.
</P>
<P>
The white paper said that the implementation of the ethnic
regional autonomy system has further guaranteed the political
rights of the Tibetan people, which is in marked contrast to the
situation in old Tibet.
</P>
<P>
The Tibet Autonomous Regional People's Congress and its Standing
Committee -- the local organs of state power in Tibet -- fully exercise
the power of autonomy bestowed by the Constitution and law, and have
actively formulated laws and regulations appropriate to local ethnic
and regional characteristics.
</P>
<P>
The white paper said that the chairman of the Standing
Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Regional People's Congress and
the chairman of the Tibet Autonomous Region are both citizens of
the Tibetan ethnic group. Since the founding of the Tibet
Autonomous Region all the four chairmen of the Standing Committee
of the People's Congress of the Tibet Autonomous Region and five
chairmen of the Region have been Tibetan citizens.
</P>
<P>
Further progress has been made in the training and selection of
cadres of Tibetan and other ethnic groups in Tibet since
1992. According to 1996 statistics the number of cadres belonging
to the Tibetan and other ethnic minorities in Tibet had increased
by 18.22 percent over the 1992 figure, making up 73.88 percent of
the total and showing an increase of 4.48 percentage points over
the figure for 1992.
</P>
<P>
The white paper said that guaranteeing the study and use of the
Tibetan language is an important aspect of safeguarding the
Tibetan people's right to autonomy and exercising their right to
participate in the administration of state and local affairs. In
the Tibet Autonomous Region, both Tibetan and Chinese should be
used with precedence given to the Tibetan language.
</P>
<P>
On the question of economic development and the people's rights
to existence and development, the white paper said that
outstanding achievements have been made in this regard through the
unstinted efforts of the Central Government and the governments at
all levels in the Region.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that since 1992 the Tibetan economy has
increased rapidly. In 1997 the GDP of Tibet amounted to about 7.35
billion yuan-worth, an increase of 96.6 percent compared to 1991
at constant prices or an average annual increase of 11.9
percent.

<P>
In recent years the Central Government has allocated upwards
of 1.2 billion yuan each year to Tibet as a financial subsidy, and
from the early 1950s to 1997 the Central Government allocated
more than 40 billion yuan for Tibet; from 1959 to 1996
allotted 6.74 million tons of materials. Among the latter were
1.1 million tons of commercial materials, 1.3 million tons of
grain and 1.48 million tons of oil.
</P>
<P>
The white paper said that the state has also given large-scale
additional assistance to key and special projects in Tibet in
different economic and social development periods. In 1984 some
43 projects were built for Tibet by nine provinces and
municipalities mobilized and directed by the Central Government,
and in 1994 the Central Government decided to build gratis
another 62 projects for Tibet within three or four years.
</P>
<P>
Now almost all the projects have been completed and put into
use. The actual total investment was 3.66 billion yuan, much more
than the planned investment of 2.38 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The development of the economy has tangibly improved the lives
of all people in Tibet. In 1996 the average annual per capita income
that urban residents used for living expenses was 5,030 yuan, 2.4
times that of 1991, showing an average annual increase of 19 percent;
the average per capita net income of peasants and herdsmen was 975
yuan, an increase of 48.3 percent compared to 1991 and an average
annual increase of 8.2 percent. In 1997, income of the above two
types was 5,130 yuan and 1,040 yuan respectively.
</P>
<P>
The white paper said that to ensure a favorable living
environment for the people of all ethnic groups and improve their
quality of life, the Tibet Autonomous Region strictly implements
the state's laws and regulations concerning environmental
protection. Since 1992 the autonomous region has formulated and
promulgated more than 20 local laws and regulations, and
administrative rules on eco-environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
Monitoring results show low discharge of the "three industrial
wastes" (waste gas, waste water and industrial residue) in
Tibet; the quality of the water in the Region's major rivers is
up to the state's first-class standard for the environmental
quality of surface water.

<P>
So far, the white paper noted that not a single environmental
pollution accident has occurred in Tibet, and no acid rain has
fallen in the Region, let alone any man-made radiation pollution.
</P>
<P>
The white paper said that since the beginning of the 1990s
educational, cultural and health work in Tibet has been further
improved, and this has further promoted the people's right to
education, culture and health protection.
</P>
<P>
Currently, a fairly complete modern education system is being
operated in the Tibet Autonomous Region, and education is being spread
to wider areas in the Region. According to 1997 statistics, 4,251
regular and village-run primary schools had been established in Tibet,
with a total enrollment of 300,453 students.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, 78.2 percent of school-age children were in school, a
32.6 percentage point increase over 1991. There are 90 secondary
schools in Tibet, with 17,155 more students enrolled than in
1991. There are also four institutions of higher learning and 16
special secondary schools in Tibet. The illiteracy rate among the
young and middle-aged has dropped by 41 percentage points as
compared with the figure before the peaceful liberation of Tibet.
</P>
<P>
With its distinctive ethnic characteristics, Tibetological research,
which plays an important role in inheriting and developing the essence
of traditional Tibetan culture, has received attention and support
from the state.
</P>
<P>
Currently, there are over 50 Tibetan study institutes
all over the country, with over 2,000 people engaged in such research
and related auxiliary work.
</P>
<P>
Great importance has been continuously attached to traditional
Tibetan medicine and pharmacology. There are 14 Tibetan medicine
institutions in the Region, and Tibetan medicine is available in
over 60 hospitals at the county level.
</P>
<P>
The white paper said that the work to systematically
investigate, collect, record, collate, study, compile and publish
the traditional cultural heritage of Tibet on a large scale is
continuing apace.
</P>
<P>
The general survey of cultural relics in the Tibet Autonomous
Region is almost finished, with cultural relics found in 1,768
places. Large numbers of rare cultural relics have been put under
full protection.
</P>
<P>
Since the early 1990s more than 30 Tibetan song and dance
troupes, art ensembles and academic delegations have visited,
given performances, engaged in academic exchanges, and held
exhibitions on Tibetan historical relics, books, arts, costume
and handicrafts in more than 30 countries and regions, including
the United States, Germany, France, England, Italy and
Austria.

The white paper said that the Central Government and the
governments at all levels in Tibet are greatly concerned about the
health of the Tibetan people.
</P>
<P>
After many years of effort, a basic medical and public health
network now covers the whole of the Tibet Autonomous Region. By
the end of 1997 Tibet had 1,324 medical and health establishments,
127 more than in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The steady improvement of health care and living standards has
raised the average life expectancy of Tibetans from 36 years in
the old Tibet to the present 65 years. At the same time, the
population of Tibet has increased rapidly and the protracted
stagnation of population growth in the old days has changed
completely.
</P>
<P>
The white paper said in the 40 years from 1953 to 1993, after
Tibet was peacefully liberated, the population grew from one
million to well over 2.3 million, of which the population of
Tibetans increased by 1.16 million, or a more than two-fold
increase in 40 years. By the end of 1996 the population of Tibet
had reached 2.44 million, 95 percent of whom were Tibetans.
</P>
<P>
The white paper pointed out that since the peaceful liberation
of Tibet the Chinese Government has accorded consistent respect
and protection to the Tibetan people's right to freedom of
religious belief.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are 1,787 sites for Tibetan Buddhist
activities in the Region, and there are 46,380 Buddhist monks and
nuns living in monasteries.
</P>
<P>
The Tibetan Autonomous Region and the seven prefectures or
cities under its jurisdiction all have their own Buddhist
associations, and the autonomous regional Buddhist association has
its own journal and establishment for printing Tibetan-language
scriptures.
</P>
<P>
Since the early 1980s the state has allocated special funds as
well as gold and silver every year for the maintenance,
restoration and protection of monasteries in Tibet, to the sum of
over 300 million yuan-worth.
</P>
<P>
The state allocated a special fund of more than 55 million
yuan for the five-odd-year renovation of the Potala Palace
involving a total floor space of 33,900 sq m..
</P>
<P>
Another special fund of 6.7 million yuan, together with 111 kg
of gold and over 2,000 kg of silver and a large amount of gems,
has been provided to finance the restoration of the funerary
stupas and sacrificial halls of the fifth to the ninth Panchen
Lamas.

<P>
In addition, the state has allocated 66.2 million yuan and 650
kg of gold for the construction of the funerary stupa and
sacrificial hall of the 10th Panchen Lama.
</P>
<P>
Much importance has always been attached in Tibet to
collecting, editing, publishing and studying ancient religious
books and records. Religious books edited and published in the
1990s include the Tibetan-language Chinese Tripitaka -- Tanjur
(collated edition), A Tibetan-Chinese General Catalogue of the
Tibetan Tripitaka and others on Tibetan Buddhism have been printed.
</P>
<P>
The white paper said that the state holds in great esteem the
system of reincarnation of Living Buddhas, which is characteristic
of Tibetan Buddhism and an important succession method of the
leadership of Tibetan Buddhism, and has profound respect for the
religious practices and historical conventions of Tibet's main
religion.
</P>
<P>
In 1992 the Religious Affairs Bureau of the State Council
approved the succession of the 17th Karmapa Living Buddha, in
accordance with Tibet's religious practices.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, a great event in the Buddhist world came to pass when
the rite of drawing lots from a golden urn was carried out, and
the boy who in Buddhist belief was the reincarnation of the
deceased 10th Panchen Lama was identified, confirmed, given the
title, enthroned and ordained as the 11th Panchen Lama in
accordance with the religious practices and historical conventions
and with the approval of the State Council.
</P>
<P>
The white paper said that a host of facts show clearly that the
situation as regards human rights in old Tibet bears no comparison
with the situation in Tibet today and the fact that human rights
in Tibet have improved is beyond all dispute.
</P>
<P>
It said that the Dalai Lama vilifies the present human rights
situation in Tibet. But, ironically, under his rule in old Tibet
human rights were wantonly trampled on in wide areas -- a crime
stemming from the dark, savage and cruel system of merging
politics with religion and the feudal serfdom. Making no mention
whatsoever of the situation where trampling the people's basic
human rights was commonplace in old Tibet.
</P>
<P>
It noted that the Dalai Lama's wanton fabrication of lies and
his violation and trampling of this commandment serve only to
expose him in all his true colors: He is waving the banner of
religion to conduct activities aimed at splitting the motherland.

<HEADLINE> Ethnic Regional Autonomy System Ensures Political Rights of Tibetans (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The white paper noted that the political rights enjoyed by the
Tibetan people today are in marked contrast to the situation in
old Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Before the Democratic Reform of 1959 Tibet had long been a
society languishing under a system of feudal serfdom which
intertwined politics with religion, a society which was even
darker than the European society of the Middle Ages. The serfs and
slaves, making up 95 percent of the total population of Tibet,
were completely deprived of personal freedom and political rights.
</P>
<P>
The serf owners safeguarded the feudal serfdom with savage
punishments; they would frequently punish serfs and slaves by
gouging out their eyes, cutting off their ears, arms or legs,
drowning them or inflicting other terrible penalties.
</P>
<P>
The white paper said that since the Democratic Reform abolished
the feudal serf system, the Tibetan people, like the people of all
other ethnic groups throughout the country, have become the
masters of their state and society, and won the political rights
enjoyed by all citizens as stipulated in the Chinese Constitution
and law.
</P>
<P>
All citizens in Tibet who have reached the age of 18 have the
right to vote and stand for election, regardless of ethnic group,
race, sex, occupation, family background, religious belief,
education, property status or length of residence. They elect
their own deputies and exercise the power to administer state and
local affairs through the people's congresses at vaious levels
elected by them.

at constant prices or an average annual increase of 11.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Since 1987 Tibet has reaped good harvests for 10 years in
succession. The total grain output was 820,000 tons in 1997, the
highest output in Tibetan history and an increase of 41.4 percent
compared to the 580,000 tons in 1991. The output of meat was
119,000 tons in 1997, an increase of 25.5 percent compared to 1991.
</P>
<P>
Now the people of the Tibet Autonomous Region are working hard
to attain the goal of getting rid of poverty throughout the
Region and achieving comfortable lives for most of the people
before the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The white paper said that since 1992 the building of the parts
of the infrastructure closely related to people's everyday life
and production, such as communications, energy and
telecommunications, and the development of construction, building
materials, foodstuffs, traditional handicrafts, textiles and other
light industries have been quickened.
</P>
<P>
The Central Government has always attached special importance
to the development of Tibet by providing generous assistance in
manpower, materials, financial resources and technologies. In
addition, preferential policies have been adopted in line with
the Region's actual conditions. No levies have been imposed on the
peasants and herdsmen in Tibet since 1980 and there is no
compulsory state purchase of grain there. The income that Tibetan
peasants and herdsmen earn is entirely their own.
</P>
<P>
In recent years the Central Government has allocated upwards
of 1.2 billion yuan each year to Tibet as a financial subsidy, and
other favorable measures have been adopted, such as lightening its
financial burdens, preferential investment, investment in skill
training and an aid-the-poor program.

<P>
The white paper said that the state has also given large-scale
additional assistance to key and special projects in Tibet in
different economic and social development periods.
</P>
<P>
In 1994 the Central Government decided to build gratis another
62 projects for Tibet within three or four years, also with the
cooperation of other provinces and municipalities of the country,
involving agriculture and water conservancy, energy,
communications and telecommunications, industry, and social
welfare and municipal engineering.
</P>
<P>
Now almost all the projects have been completed and put into
use. The actual total investment was 3.66 billion yuan, much more
than the planned investment of 2.38 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The development of the economy has tangibly improved the lives
of all people in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
In 1996 the average annual per-capita income that urban
residents used for living expenses was 5,030 yuan, 2.4 times that
of 1991, showing an average annual increase of 19 percent; the
average per capita net income of peasants and herdsmen was 975
yuan, an increase of 48.3 percent compared to 1991 and an average
annual increase of 8.2 percent. In 1997, income of the above two
types was 5,130 yuan and 1,040 yuan respectively.
</P>
<P>
Since 1992 the Tibet Autonomous Region has formulated and
promulgated more than 20 local laws and regulations, and
administrative rules on eco-environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
Monitoring results show low discharge of the "three industrial
wastes" (waste gas, waste water and industrial residue) in Tibet;
the quality of the water in the region's major rivers is up to the
state's first-class standard for the environmental quality of
surface water. So far not a single environmental pollution
accident has occurred in Tibet, and no acid rain has fallen in the
Region, let alone any man-made radiation pollution.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The development of
educational, cultural and health services in the Tibet Autonomous
Region has further promoted Tibetan people's right to education,
culture and health protection, said a white paper issued today by
the Information Office of China's State Council.
</P>
<P>
The white paper, entitled "New Progress in Human Rights in the
Tibet Autonomous Region", said that currently, a fairly complete
modern education system is being operated in the Tibet Autonomous
Region, and education is being spread to wider areas in the region.
</P>
<P>
According to 1997 statistics, 4,251 regular and village-run
primary schools had been established in Tibet, with a total
enrollment of 300,453 students.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, 78.2 percent of school-age children were in school, a
32.6 percentage point increase over 1991. There are 90 secondary
schools in Tibet, with 17,155 more students enrolled than in
1991. There are also four institutions of higher learning and 16
special secondary schools in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
The illiteracy rate among the young and middle-aged has dropped
by 41 percentage points as compared with the figure before the
peaceful liberation of Tibet.
</P>
<P>
The white paper said that the Chinese Government attaches great
importance to learning, using and developing the Tibetan language
in the Tibet Autonomous Region and has taken concrete measures to
guarantee the freedom of the Tibetan people to use and develop
both the spoken and written Tibetan language, which is a main
course of study at all schools in Tibet as well as in special
Tibetan classes and schools in other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
Tibetan students are required to read and write the Tibetan
language proficiently upon graduation from middle schools.
</P>
<P>
The work to systematically investigate, collect, record,
collate, study, compile and publish the traditional cultural
heritage of Tibet on a large scale is continuing apace.
</P>
<P>
The Tibetan Ancient Books Publishing House was set up in the
Region with state funds to take charge of collecting, editing and
publishing Tibetan ancient books. A large number of Tibetan
ancient books, inscribed wooden slips and inscriptions on bronzes
and stone tablets have been put under protection.
</P>
<P>
Great importance has been continuously attached to traditional
Tibetan medicine and pharmacology. There are 14 Tibetan medicine
institutions in the Region, and Tibetan medicine is available in
over 60 hospitals at the county level.

<P>
The white paper said that the general survey of cultural relics
in the Tibet Autonomous Region is almost finished, with cultural
relics found in 1,768 places. Large numbers of rare cultural
relics have been put under full protection.
</P>
<P>
Since the early 1990s, more than 30 Tibetan song and dance
troupes, art ensembles and academic delegations have visited,
given performances, engaged in academic exchanges, and held
exhibitions on Tibetan historical relics, books, arts, costume and
handicrafts in more than 30 countries and regions, including the
United States, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Austria.
</P>
<P>
The white paper said that the Central Government and the
governments at all levels in Tibet are greatly concerned about the
health of the Tibetan people. A basic medical and public health
network now covers the whole of the Tibet Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1997 Tibet had 1,324 medical and health
establishments, 127 more than in 1991; 6,246 hospital beds, 1,169
beds more than in 1991, averaging some 2.5 beds per 1,000 people.
</P>
<P>
The white paper said that much attention has also been devoted
to the medical and health care of women and children in Tibet. By
the end of 1996 a total of 34 maternity and child care centers and
eight baby-friendly hospitals had been set up.
</P>
<P>
In addition, 108 hospitals at and above the county level now
have departments of gynecology and obstetrics, and 110 key
townships have maternity and child care departments which have
monitored the development of more than 250,000 children and given
general surveys and treatments of common and frequently-occurring
diseases among them.
</P>
<P>
The white paper said that the steady improvement of health care
and living standards has raised the average life expectancy of
Tibetans from 36 years in the old Tibet to the present 65 years.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the population of Tibet has increased rapidly
and the protracted stagnation of population growth in the old
days has changed completely.
</P>
<P>
In the period from 1953 to 1993, after Tibet was peacefully
liberated, the population grew from one million to well over 2.3
million, of which the population of Tibetans increased by 1.16
million, or a more than two-fold increase in 40 years. By the end
of 1996 the population of Tibet had reached 2.44 million, 95
percent of whom were Tibetans.
</P>
<P>
The above figures lay bare the lie that "The population of
Tibet is decreasing," refute the bluster about "Tibetans
suffering from genocide" emanating from the Dalai Lama and some
Western sources, and illuminate, from one aspect, the human
rights situations in the new and old Tibet, the white paper said.

<HEADLINE> Tibetans' Right to Freedom of Religious Belief Respected (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Government has
accorded consistent respect and protection to the Tibetan people's
right to freedom of religious belief according to law, said a
white paper issued here today by the Information Office of China's
State Council.
</P>
<P>
The white paper entitled "New Progress in Human Rights in the
Tibet Autonomous Region" said that in 1951 the Central Government
and the local government of Tibet, headed by the Dalai Lama,
signed the 17-article Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful
Liberation of Tibet, which explicitly stipulated that "in Tibet
a policy ensuring the people freedom of religious belief will be
carried out."
</P>
<P>
The agreement also stressed that the religious beliefs, customs
and habits of the Tibetan people will be respected, and the
Lamaist monasteries will be properly protected and the Central
Government will allow no change in the revenues of monasteries.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are 1,787 sites for Tibetan Buddhist
activities in the region, and there are 46,380 Buddhist monks and
nuns living in monasteries.
</P>
<P>
The Tibet Autonomous Region and the seven prefectures or cities
under its jurisdiction all have their own Buddhist associations,
and the autonomous regional Buddhist association has its own
journal and establishment for printing Tibetan-language scriptures.
</P>
<P>
Since the early 1980s, the state has allocated special
funds as well as gold and silver every year for the maintenance,
restoration and protection of monasteries in Tibet, to the sum of
over 300 million yuan-worth.
</P>
<P>
The white paper said that the state allocated a special fund of
more than 55 million yuan for the five-odd-year renovation of the
Potala Palace involving a total floor space of 33,900 sq m.
</P>
<P>
Another special fund of 6.7 million yuan, together with 111 kg
of gold and over 2,000 kg of silver and a large amount of gems,
has been provided to finance the restoration of the funerary
stupas and sacrificial halls of the fifth to the ninth Panchen
Lamas.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the state has allocated 66.2 million yuan and 650
kg of gold for the construction of the funerary stupa and
sacrificial hall of the 10th Panchen Lama. In 1994 an additional
appropriation of 20 million yuan was made to further renovate the
Ganden Monastery.

<TEXT>
<P>
The white paper said that much importance has always been
attached in Tibet to collecting, editing, publishing and studying
ancient religious books and records. Religious books edited and
published in the 1990s include the Tibetan-language Chinese
Tripitaka -- Tanjur (collated edition), a Tibetan-Chinese General
Catalogue of the Tibetan Tripitaka and others have been printed.
</P>
<P>
The white paper said that the state holds in great esteem the
system of reincarnation of Living Buddhas, which is characteristic
of Tibetan Buddhism and an important succession method of the
leadership of Tibetan Buddhism, and has profound respect for the
religious practices and historical conventions of Tibet's main
religion.
</P>
<P>
In 1992 the Religious Affairs Bureau of the State Council
approved the succession of the 17th Karmapa Living Buddha, in
accordance with Tibet's religious practices.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, a great event in the Buddhist world came to pass when
the rite of drawing lots from a golden urn was carried out, and
the boy who in Buddhist belief was the reincarnation of the
deceased 10th Panchen Lama was identified, confirmed, given the
title, enthroned and ordained as the 11th Panchen Lama in
accordance with the religious practices and historical
conventions and with the approval of the State Council.
</P>
<P>
A host of facts show clearly that human rights in Tibet are
making unceasing progress. The Central Government and the local
governments at all levels in the Tibet Autonomous Region have made
great efforts to safeguard and promote the progress of human
rights in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
The white paper noted that the situation as regards human
rights in old Tibet bears no comparison with the situation in
Tibet today.
</P>
<P>
It said that the Dalai Lama vilifies the present human rights
situation in Tibet, but, ironically, under his rule in old Tibet
human rights were wantonly trampled on in wide areas -- a crime
stemming from the dark, savage and cruel system of merging
politics with religion and the feudal serfdom.
</P>
<P>
Making no mention whatsoever of the situation where trampling
the people's basic human rights was commonplace in old Tibet, the
exiled Dalai Lama has tried by every means to cover it up and
vilify and attack the development and progress in new Tibet. He
also fabricates sensational lies to befuddle world opinion, the
white paper said.
</P>
<P>
The Dalai Lama's wanton fabrication of lies and his violation
and trampling of this commandment serve only to expose him in all
his true colors: He is waving the banner of religion to conduct
activities aimed at splitting the motherland, the white paper said.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Expects $62.6 Billion Exports in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bangkok, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Thailand has set the target
for exports in 1998 at 62.6 billion U.S. dollars, up 7.1 percent
from last year, the Nation newspaper said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
To promote Thai exports to meet the target, the Council of
Economic Ministers met on Monday and ordered the implementation of
six measures to solve the liquidity problems faced by exporters.
</P>
<P>
The six measures include bank recapitalization by June this
year, reduction of reserves on risk assets for exporters' credit,
increase of packing credits, facilitation of automobile exports,
tax rebates and fighting sea pirates.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Finance Ministry announced the trade figures for
1997, saying the country's exports value reached 58.4 billion
dollars, up by 4.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The ministry also reported that Thailand in January recorded a
trade surplus for the fifth consecutive month, but exports in the
month declined from December.
</P>
<P>
The ministry attributed the 1997 rise of exports to the
depreciation of the baht and a fall in imports due to reduced
domestic purchasing power.

The bipartisan measure, drafted by Republican Senator John
McCain and Democratic Senator Russ Feingold, would ban unregulated
"soft money" to national political parties from corporations,
labor unions and individuals.
</P>
<P>
In addition, it would impose new restrictions on advertisements
that attack candidates but escape regulation because they are
presented as "issue ads" not covered by existing election law.
</P>
<P>
Most Republicans, led by Lott, have countered with a proposal
that would require organized labor to obtain the consent of
members before using their union dues on political advocacy.
</P>
<P>
The McCain-Feingold proposal is not likely to garner the 60
votes needed to overcome a filibuster and force Lott and other
opponents to the bargaining table.
</P>
<P>
The fight may eventually lead to a compromise bill by Senator
Olympia Snowe, a Republican.
</P>
<P>
She and other Republican moderates have put forward a proposal
requiring speedy disclosure of contributors to any broadcast
commercials targeting specific candidates within 30 days of a
primary or 60 days of a general election.
</P>
<P>
It would also prohibit the use of union or corporate funds for
such ads.
</P>
<P>
It would "simply require funding to come from sources
traditionally relied upon for campaign purposes -- PACs (political
action committees) or individual, voluntary donors," a summary of
the legislation said.

<HEADLINE> Ethnic Regional Autonomy System Ensures Political Rights of Tibetans (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The implementation of the
ethnic regional autonomy system has further guaranteed the
political rights of the Tibetan people, said a white paper
released by the Information Office of China's State Council here
today.
</P>
<P>
Entitled "New Progress in Human Rights in the Tibet Autonomous
Region", the white paper said that Tibet is an area where the
Tibetans live in compact communities, with people of the Tibetan
ethnic group making up 95 percent of the total population of 2.44
million in the autonomous region, and the people of the Han and
other ethnic groups accounting for only five percent.
</P>
<P>
According to the Constitution of the People's Republic of
China, the state practices the ethnic regional autonomy system in
Tibet, which has been established as the Tibet Autonomous Region,
and safeguards, according to law, the political rights of the
people of all ethnic groups in Tibet to participate in
administration of state and local affairs on an equal basis,
especially the Tibetan people's autonomous right to independently
administer local and ethnic affairs.
</P>
<P>
In April 1956, the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet
Autonomous Region was set up in accordance with the Central
Government's decision, the white paper said.
</P>
<P>
The Tibet Autonomous Region was formally founded in 1965, with
Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme as the first chairman of the Region. As the
organs of self-government, the Tibet Autonomous Regional People's
Congress and the Regional People's Government exercise the power
of autonomy according to law.
</P>
<P>
The white paper said that the Tibet Autonomous Regional
People's Congress and its Standing Committee -- the local organs
of state power in Tibet -- fully exercise the power of autonomy
bestowed by the Constitution and law, and have actively formulated
laws and regulations appropriate to local ethnic and regional
characteristics.
</P>
<P>
Between 1965 and 1992 more than 60 local laws and regulations
were worked out, such as the Rules of Procedure of the People's
Congress of the Tibet Autonomous Region.

<TEXT>
<P>
In recent years the Region has formulated 23 local laws and
regulations, made 21 legal decisions, and cleared up or revised 23
laws and regulations involving politics, the economy, culture,
education, environmental protection and other fields. In addition,
rules for the implementation of 14 national laws and regulations
conforming to the local features of Tibet have been drawn up.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, the number of laws and regulations
worked out since 1992 by the People's Congress of the Tibet
Autonomous Region and its Standing Committee to safeguard the
interests of the Tibetan people in light of the actual conditions
in Tibet exceeds the total formulated during the 12 years
preceding 1992.
</P>
<P>
The chairman of the Standing Committee of the Tibet Autonomous
Regional People's Congress and the chairman of the Tibet Autonomous
Region are both citizens of the Tibetan ethnic group.
</P>
<P>
Since the founding of the Tibet Autonomous Region all the four
chairmen of the Standing Committee of the People's Congress of
the Tibet Autonomous Region and five chairmen of the Region have
been Tibetan citizens.
</P>
<P>
Members of the Tibetan and other ethnic minorities now account
for 71.4 percent of the chairman and vice-chairmen of the Standing
Committee of the People's Congress of the Tibet Autonomous Region;
for 80 percent of the members of the Standing Committee of the
Autonomous Regional People's Congress; and for 77.8 percent of the
chairman and vice-chairmen of the Tibet Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Further progress has been made in the training and selection of
cadres of Tibetan and other ethnic minorities in Tibet since
1992. According to 1996 statistics, the number of cadres belonging
to the Tibetan and other ethnic minorities in Tibet had increased
by 18.22 percent over the 1992 figure, making up 73.88 percent of
the total and showing an increase of 4.48 percentage points over
the figure for 1992.
</P>
<P>
The white paper said that guaranteeing the study and use of the
Tibetan language is an important aspect of safeguarding the
Tibetan people's right to autonomy and exercising their right to
participate in the administration of state and local affairs.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Loans Help to Improve Rural Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 24 (Xinhua) -- More than four million people
in 40 poverty-ridden rural counties of four provinces and the
Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region will be provided with piped-in
water by 2001, when a WB-funded water improvement project is
scheduled for completion.
</P>
<P>
The 1.1 billion yuan (132 million U.S. dollars) project will
build pumping stations, install pipes and taps for each household,
according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Pilot work on other renovations will match up in each of the
counties, which includes improved sanitation facilities in schools
and the spreading of publicity and education programs related to
water and environmental sanitation problems.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank has promised to provide a loan of 70 million
U.S. dollars for the five-year project, which started at the
end of 1997 and designed to benefit 4.6 million citizens in
more than 3,000 villages in Hebei, Jiangxi, Hubei and Yunnan
provinces as well as Inner Mongolia.
</P>
<P>
China started cooperation with the World Bank in upgrading
rural water in 1985, according to Liu Jiayi, division chief in
charge of rural water improvement with the National Patriotic
Health Campaign Commission.
</P>
<P>
Since then and through 2001, loans totalling about 300 million
U.S. dollars have be used and will flow to support 140 counties to
improve water, which will benefit 21 million people.
</P>
<P>
China has also established collaborations with seven
international organizations and governments of some foreign
countries.
</P>
<P>
The quality of drinking water in rural areas has greatly
improved, with more than 86 percent of the rural residents now get
tap water, compared with less than 10 percent in the early 1980s,
according to figures from the Ministry of Health.
</P>
<P>
Officials with the commission say the national target of
providing 90 percent of the rural population with drinkable water
by the end of the century can be achieved.

<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar and the United States
jointly surveyed illicit poppy plantations and collected poppy
samples in Myanmar's northeastern Shan State during the last week,
the official New Light of Myanmar newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The survey, the fourth under a joint anti-drug program of the
two governments, was carried out by a team comprising personnel of
the state-run Myanmar Agricultural Service and the U.S. Department
of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The areas under survey covered Pinlaung, Leicha, Mongpan,
Siseng, Loilem, Mongmaw, Wa, Hopang and Tangyang, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted one and a half months after Myanmar
launched a three-month nationwide campaign in January to collect
baseline data on opium cultivation and drug addicts in the
country. The move was initiated due to a wide gap in the estimates
of the area and production of opium by Myanmar and the United
States, according to the authorities.
</P>
<P>
The two countries undertook similar surveys in other areas in
Shan State in 1993, 1995 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
According to an earlier official report, the Myanmar
authorities destroyed more than 16,000 hectares of illicit poppy
plantations in 17 townships of Shan State between last November
and this January.

BANGKOK, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will continue talks

</P>
<P>
The country will stress its need for economic assistance at
several forums including the Asia-Europe Meeting and the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.
</P>
<P>

Group of Seven (G-7) industrialized countries have not taken any
concrete actions to assist Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
Exporters need to import materials for production and
manufacturing. Cooperation from the developed countries will help
Thai exporters fill their orders, thus boosting the economy, Surin
said.
</P>
<P>
Negotiating the rollover of short-term foreign debts held by
the private sector is another urgent task for the Thai government,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Surin said Thailand has received firm support from the German,
Dutch and British governments, which said they would urge banks to
assist Thai firms.

Surin also welcomed last week's decision by G-7 finance
ministers to help shore up confidence in Asian economies.

BRUSSELS, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Anderlecht midfielder Enzo
Scifo said on Monday he would not play international soccer again
after being left out of Belgium's squad for a friendly against the
United States.
</P>
<P>
The 32-year-old veteran said Belgium coach Leekens was showing
"a lack of respect" by doing so.

<P>
Scifo, capped 79 times, made his debut for the Belgian national
side in 1984 and played in the past three World Cup finals.
</P>

<P>
BEIJING, February 24 (Xinhua) -- China is planning to launch two
more agricultural projects in African countries this year
following a successful one in Guinea, said today's "China Daily".
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Republic of the Congo and Cote d'Ivoire will
cooperate with China to bolster their agricultural development, a
Ministry of Agriculture official was quoted as saying in this
Beijing-based newspaper.
</P>
<P>
These two projects will follow the rule applied by the program
in Guinea.
</P>
<P>
China planted rice in 9,000 hectares of land in Guinea last
year. The rice yield in the project area reached six tons per ha.
</P>
<P>
The planting area will be expanded to 18,000 hectares this
year. China also plans to diversify its investment in Guinea by
setting up a feed lot to raise 200,000 table hens and a 500-sq.m
reservoir available to raise fish.
</P>
<P>
The Guinea project is scheduled to involve three phases of
construction. China is projected to pour 18.16 million US dollars
into the first phase which will be completed by the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
The project will increase the production capacity of rice in
Guinea by 400,000 tons a year after its completion.
</P>
<P>
The cooperated project also provided training for local farmers
who will eventually increase their incomes by applying new
technology.

<HEADLINE> Reports Finds Rwanda's Poorest Are in Parentless Homes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of thousands
of children who managed to live through the 1994 genocide and its
aftermath in Rwanda are now struggling for survival in desperately
impoverished households without parents, a report from the United
Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF)says on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The World Vision Report, titled "Qualitative Needs Assessment
of Child-Headed Households (CHHs)in Rwanda," found that 95 percent
of children in CHHs in Rwanda have no access to health care and
education; are frequently exploited and abused sexually, not only
by their own community but even by their relatives; have little in
the way of basic household or agricultural necessities; and are
frequently denied inheritance rights that can deprive them from
property that their parents left behind, including land and
houses.
</P>
<P>
"The family structures that used to support the children no
longer exist," the report found.
</P>
<P>
Food shortages are chronic in child-headed households
throughout the country, the report found, a problem that forces
urban children to beg in the streets and rural children to rely on
what little food they can produce or on handouts from neighbors.
Shelter was also identified as a major concern, especially in the
countryside, where many child-headed homes are consisting of
little more than plastic sheeting.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the report found that the very existence of
child-headed households "has barely acknowledged" by the surviving
Rwandan community. For children already traumatized, the
psychological consequences of the invisibility and powerlessness
can be devastating, the report says.
</P>
<P>
It notes that children in psychological therapy, asked to draw,
sometimes depict people without mouths. Many of these children
"can no longer talk, having learned that they cry out in pain, or
speak their feelings, no one listens," the report says. "So they
become silent, choosing to keep their problems to themselves."
</P>
<P>
UNICEF is currently working with seven Rwanda and international
and non-governmental organizations, which are assisting some
16,000 children in child-headed households. The assistance
includes vocational training, payment for school fees and
educational supplies, and assistance in forming associations and
starting up small enterprises.

UNITED NATIONS, February 23 (Xinhua) -- A total of 3,369
fighter/attack/jet trainer aircraft valued at 100.8 billion U.S.
dollars will be produced worldwide in the next ten years, a U.S.
company forecast.
</P>
<P>
The annual output will be on the rise during the second
five-year period, according to the Connecticut-based Forecast
International/DMS.
</P>
<P>
Company analysts said the immediate post-Cold War environment
coupled with a major economic recession resulted in
across-the-board force reductions by all but a few nations, with
other countries postponing modernization plans.
</P>
<P>
Several countries are now addressing procurement which have
been on the shelf for the past few years, they said in a report
released on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The primary market motivator, however, is a major re-equipment
cycle beginning to shape up in the United States and western
Europe," the report noted.
</P>
<P>
"This will result in large-scale acquisitions of Dassault
Rafales by France, of EF 2000s by the Eurofighter member nations
and in the U.S., of Boeing F/A-18E/Fs, Lockheed F-22s and the
USAF/USN Joint Strike Fighter (JSF)," the report said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Cautiously Endorses Annan's Deal with Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
on Monday cautiously endorsed a tentative agreement between
Secretary General of the United Nations Kofi Annan and Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein which carries a promise from Baghdad to
allow U.N. weapons inspectors full access to presidential sites in
Iraq for searching weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
"I hope today's agreement will prove to be the step forward
that we had been looking for," Clinton told an Oval Office news
conference.
</P>
<P>
But he said some issues still needed to be clarified and
details to be spelled out.
</P>
<P>
"There are issues that still need to be clarified to our
satisfaction and details that need to be spelled out," he said.
"We will hear from the U.N. secretary-general tomorrow on
these questions, and we will work with him and with UNSCOM (U.N.
Special Commission) to make sure the inspections are rigorous
and professional."
</P>
<P>
Clinton made the remarks after he and Vice President Al Gore
were briefed by National Security Adviser Sandy Berger on what the
administration knows about the tentative agreement.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, meanwhile, was briefed
by Bill Richardson, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, who
had a copy of the agreed document.
</P>
<P>
Before the news conference, Clinton had a lengthy discussion
with British Prime Minister Tony Blair, and he planned to call
Russian President Boris Yeltsin and French President jacques
Chirac. Clinton also spoke with Annan on sunday night after
Annan struck the agreement with Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
He said Saddam Hussein had for the first time since the 1991
Gulf War promised unfettered access to his presidential areas.
</P>
<P>
But Clinton said whether Saddam allows weapons inspectors
unlimited access to his presidential sites remains "a big if."
</P>
<P>
"The proof is in the testing," he stressed. "We have to
monitor Iraq's compliance with the commitment it made at the end
of the Gulf War to give up all of its biological, chemical, and
nuclear weapons, the missiles to deliver them and the capacity
to rebuild its arsenal."
</P>
<P>
Clinton said there will be serious consequences if Iraq once
again fails to allow complete inspections of suspected weapons
sites.
</P>
<P>
"If Iraq fails to comply this time to provide immediate,
unrestricted, unconditional access to the weapons inspectors,
there will be serious consequences," he said
</P>
<P>
He said if Iraq doesn't keep its word this time, everyone in
the United States and its allies would recognize that the United
States has the "unilateral right to respond." And the United
States will keep its forces in the Gulf for military action once
Saddam breaks his words by his deeds.
</P>
<P>
"I intend to keep our forces at high levels of preparation in
the Gulf in the near term to see what happens in terms of
honoring these obligations," he said.
</P>
<P>
Senator Majority Leader Trent Lott said Clinton may be "in a
box" -- stuck with the tentative agreement he has to accept.
</P>
<P>
"I was worried that this initiative by Annan was going to put
the president in a box and that's exactly what's happened," Lott
told reporters at the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
"This is another example of how the administration's foreign
policy is subcontracted to others ... Everybody says this is
good enough,and yet it may not be good enough," he said. "But
the president would be in such a box because of the way it was
handled he had no alternative."

for him by the French government.
</P>
<P>
None of them made any official statement, and Chirac only said
half-jokingly that he was more optimistic tonight than last night.

<HEADLINE> UK Prime Minister Calls for New UN Resolution on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 23 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair said Monday that United Nations Secretary-General Kofi
Annan's deal with Iraq should be backed up with a new Security
Council resolution to ensure that Iraq comply with the accord
completely.
</P>
<P>
"It is absolutely essential that we are not back in this
position in a few weeks or a few months' time," Blair told
reporters outside his Downing Street office.
</P>
<P>
Blair made the statement after a long telephone conversation
with U.S. President Bill Clinton. He said that he wanted to be
sure the crisis would not happen again and there would be no
repetition of the "long-drawn-out diplomatic game" with Iraq's
President Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
Blair added that Britain has to check the fine print of the
agreement, saying that if the deal brokered by Annan delivered
"unconditional, unrestricted, immediate access to these so-called
presidential sites" then that would be "precisely what we have
been arguing for".
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Monday, a Downing Street spokesman said that Britain
had told its U.N. ambassador Michael Weston to step up work on a
new Security Council resolution which would give authority for the
U.N. to respond "rapidly and by whatever means are necessary"
should Saddam break the agreement.

<HEADLINE> Tornadoes Kill More Than 30 People in Florida </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 23 (Xinhua) -- El Nino-driven tornadoes
ripped across central Florida early Monday, killing at least 33
people and destroying hundreds of homes and knocking out power for
thousands of residents in the region.
</P>
<P>
Tornadoes were reported from Daytona Beach on the Atlantic
Coast to the Tampa Bay area on the Gulf Coast, with some having
had wind speeds as high as 210 mph (336 kph).
</P>
<P>
Eighteen people were killed in Osceola County and 11 others
were confirmed dead near Sanford in Seminole County about 20 miles
northeast of Orlando. Three were killed in Orange County and one
in Volusia County.
</P>
<P>
Most of the deaths were scattered through three or four
neighborhoods in counties around the Orlando region.
</P>
<P>
Two other people were unaccounted for near Lake Harney, just
northeast of Orlando.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports estimated the death toll to as many as 43.
</P>
<P>
The tornadoes uprooted trees and cut electrical poles, leaving
more than 135,000 people in central Florida without power.
</P>
<P>
In Seminole County just northeast of Orlando, roofs ripped from
homes scattered in the fields and shiny sheet metal from mobile
homes hung high in trees. Some cars were crushed by fallen trees.
</P>
<P>
In Osceola County southeast of Orlando, emergency officials
said about 200 houses and other structures were damaged or
destroyed and in Orange County, about 100 mobile homes were
damaged or destroyed.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton said Monday that he was sending
representatives of the Federal Emergency Management Agency,
including FEMA director James Lee Witt, to the tornado area.
</P>
<P>
The storm was caused partially by the wind patterns and
conditions directed by El Nino, weather service officials said.
</P>
<P>
The Pacific warm-water phenomenon is blamed for a number of
unusual weather patterns around the world, including the series of
storms in California that have caused an estimated 475 million
U.S. dollars in damage.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Reduces NATO Expansion Cost Estimate to $1.5 Billion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The United States Monday
reduced its estimate of the cost of bringing Poland, Hungary and
the Czech Republic to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO) to 1.5 billion U.S. dollars over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
"This reflects more recent and more complete information than
the Department's February 1997... cost figures of 4.9 billion U.S.
dollars to 6.2 billion U.S. dollars," said the Pentagon in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
The estimate parallels a NATO estimate in November, which said
it would cost 1.5 billion U.S. dollars over 10 years to let the
new three invitees join.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. cost will be "the standard U.S. share of about 25
percent," said the statement, released at the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon's new estimate came as the administration planned
to send Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Defense
Secretary William Cohen to Capitol Hill to argue Tuesday for the
NATO expansion before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
</P>
<P>
NATO leaders decided to accept the three nations by 1999 and
the decision needs to be approved by the Senate with a vote of
two-thirds majority.
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers have cited the various cost estimates as part of
their concern over whether to approve the alliance's enlargement.
The Senate is to vote on it next month.
</P>
<P>
Critics pointed out that the Clinton administration
intentionally reduced the estimated cost of the expansion so as to
gain a quick ratification.
