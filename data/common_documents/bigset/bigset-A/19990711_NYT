GARCIAPARRA GETS OK FO ALL-STAR GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ With what appeared to be the reluctant acquiescence of
manager Jimy Williams, who decided Saturday to shut down Nomar
Garciaparra here for the rest of the weekend, the Red Sox shortstop
will play in Tuesday's All-Star Game and compete in Monday's
All-Star Home Run Derby.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra, who hasn't played since aggravating a strained left
groin July 2 in Chicago, announced his decision after meeting with
Williams and the team's training staff Saturday morning. He said he
probably would play just an inning or two Tuesday, long enough to
have one at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The All-Star Game is a time to relax, a time to come together
and have fun,'' Garciaparra said. ``I'm going to enjoy it. It's not
going to hurt me or injure me. It may help me, to see where I'm at.
It will be a way for me to test it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's quite an honor. It's nice the game is at Fenway. I've
always loved the fans there, the way they treat me, this is the
last All-Star Game of the century, they're talking about a new
park, Fenway is going to be gone. If I'm part of that, it's
definitely special.''
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra said participating in the home run derby poses no
risk healthwise. ``They asked if I'd do it,'' he said. ``Shoot, how
can I say no? It will be exciting. It doesn't hurt when I swing,
only when I run.''
</P>
<P>
   By not playing Saturday or Sunday, Garciaparra will have missed
the last nine games of a 10-game road trip. He also missed two
games after first incurring the injury June 23 in Baltimore while
running out a triple.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra said Williams signed off on his playing in the
All-Star Game. ``We talked about that,'' he said. ``He definitely
brought that up. `Are you going to play? What do you feel?' We
talked, we had the trainers there, who said what I can and can't
do. We agreed that won't be a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, Williams, who met with reporters after speaking
with Garciaparra, spoke as if the shortstop's All-Star appearance
was still uncertain, even unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll leave the door ajar a little bit and see what happens,''
Williams said, holding his thumb and index finger an inch apart,
when asked if Garciaparra would play Tuesday. ``Basically it's my
call, it's best from the team standpoint.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know and understand the All-Star Game is coming up and it's
in Boston. It's the last one of the century. That's why I leave it
open. There's still three or four days. But when you look at it, at
this particular juncture, will I green-light him to steal a base,
or have him run from first to home on a double?
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether he can play or can't play in the All-Star Game, I'm
not saying that right now. But the All-Star Game doesn't count for
the Red Sox. Look at the team, what we strive for from spring
training.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what is special, and what the All-Star Game means for a
lot of people. But there are no standings for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who will serve on the American League coaching staff,
said he plans to talk to the Yankees' Joe Torre, who will manage
the AL squad.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox front office apparently supports Garciaparra's decision
to play. ``The organization doesn't have any concerns about Nomar
playing in an exhibition game,'' spokesman Kevin Shea said. ``He
knows his body better than anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra said that if the groin still bothered him as much as
it did a few days ago, he wouldn't be playing Tuesday. But the
injury has improved significantly, he said, to the point where he
said he went to bed Saturday &UR;  &LR; night thinking he would play. ``I'm
feeling good,'' he said. ``I like the way I'm improving every
day.''
</P>
<P>
   When he arrived at the ballpark, Williams informed him he
wouldn't be in the lineup for the last two games of the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was more his call,'' Garciaparra said. ``Am I angry or mad
at him? No way. I understand. That's the manager's job. He had a
decision and made his call. Jimy, I'm never upset with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the whole picture, think of the team. I play every
year trying to get in the playoffs and go to the World Series. If
that (sitting out two more games) is what it's going to take, I'm
going to do it.''

YOUTH SHOULD NOT BE SERVED BY SOARING SALARIES 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The issue of youth has arisen again in the NBA. David
Stern, the usually perceptive commissioner, wants to establish an
age limit. Billy Hunter, the usually perceptive head of the players
association, says no one is forcing the teams to draft the
youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   Why are these otherwise astute men unable or unwilling to deal
with the transparently obvious problem? It's about the money, guys.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to stop the influx of unprepared kids, all you have
to do is get back in the bargaining room and stop guaranteeing them
all that money. Go back and make rookies' salaries non-guaranteed.
Even better, scale the salaries back to the point at which a player
who stays in college for four years gets more money, while a high
schooler gets the minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   Stern often likes to use other sports as examples to show the
NBA is no different, but in fact, he's dead wrong. It is very, very
different from tennis, baseball, golf, football, hockey, soccer,
you name it. In no other sport that I can think of, let alone any
other means of livelihood, are unproven and untried individuals
guaranteed three years of lavish money whether they can play or
not, whether they can contribute or not, whether they even belong
in the business or not.
</P>
<P>
   Setting an age limit is simplistic. All it means is that kids
will spend a couple of years in college and then come out and make
all that guaranteed money. Ignoring them, as Hunter would like the
NBA to do, is, of course, nonsense. There are underclassmen who can
play. We know that. Team A can't afford to be high and mighty when
teams B-Z are getting down and dirty.
</P>
<P>
   So take away the guarantees and see what happens. Here are a
couple of other suggestions:
</P>
<P>
   --Scale the salaries to reward staying in college to the point
at which only a senior would step into what is now the rookie
scale. High school players and college freshmen would come into the
league playing for the CBA rate. A sophomore would get slightly
more, a junior slightly more. In no instance should those salaries
be even close to the NBA minimum, and of course, all should be
non-guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   --Why do all first-round picks have to be guaranteed three
years? If you're not going to attack the root of the problem, at
least attack the branches. Make picks 1-10 guaranteed for three
years, picks 11-20 guaranteed for two, and everyone else be on
their own. Why should Leon Smith, at No. 29, receive the same
guarantees as Elton Brand at No. 1? And why should Smith get three
years and No. 30 get nothing?
</P>
<P>
   --Establish a two-way contract, as in hockey, in which a player
earns one wage if he's on the team and another if he's in the CBA.
</P>
<P>
   None of these ideas will be instituted, of course, because they
involve removing money from players' pockets. We can just hear
Patrick Ewing saying the league wants to go back to the horse and
buggy. But by making it less attractive for a player to leave
school, you are doing a service to both the NBA and the NCAA.
Players stay in school and are at least more mature when they enter
the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   That should be a win-win for all involved.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here's a scary scenario, courtesy of Spurs coach Gregg Popovich:
he feels his team may, by the middle of next season, actually be
executing the way he wants it to. ``We're not there yet with the
likes of Utah,'' Popovich said. ``I think it'll take a while, maybe
half a season for us. But I think once we do get it where we want
it, we'll be pretty good.'' The Spurs have three free agents _
Jaren Jackson, Will Perdue, and Malik Rose. Popovich says he'd like
to be able to retain two, which sounds a lot like Perdue might be
working elsewhere next season . . . 76ers coach Larry Brown says he
considered making a deal to draft Smith, the aforementioned Chicago
high school star who threw a williwaw in Dallas last week when
asked to do extra laps. Brown said he talked to some buddies in
Chicago and was told Smith had done this sort of thing before,
including refusing to come out of games by sitting at half court.
Brown did say he thought coaching Smith would be a challenge. Asked
about the league going more athletic with the impending rule
changes, Brown said, ``It will help if the kid is athletic and can
play. I've seen a lot of athletes who can't play a lick.'' Brown
was asked about a more deliberate, unathletic team like Miami
surviving in this new world. ``Miami can win if they stay
healthy,'' he said. ``Those guys know how to play. So many of these
young kids are athletic, but have no idea how to play. (Vince)
Carter is an exception. (Paul) Pierce is an exception. You surround
Alonzo (Mourning) with healthy players, they're right there.
Athletes are fine, but I'd rather have guys who know how to play
the game.'' . . . Several coaches were on hand last week to watch
the Olympic team scrimmage. It wasn't a walkover, either. The
opponents were a frontline group of Orlando Magic players (Nick
Anderson, Bo Outlaw, Matt Harpring, Michael Doleac, Darrell
Armstrong) along with a dazzling walk-on named Jason Williams.
Still, new Orlando coach Doc Rivers had to laugh every time he saw
Brown bark out a play for the Yanks. ``Does it even matter?
Wherever you throw it, it's going to be to a great player. It's
going to work.'' Rivers said he was happy to see the US field a
strong team, recalling his memories of USA Basketball when
collegians literally carried the ball. ``We'd see these Yugoslav
players pull up to the hotel in their Mercedes and get out. They'd
have their wives with them and their kids, and they'd go right for
the pool. I'm 19, on per diem, and I'm thinking, `This is not
fair.' You know what? We beat 'em anyway. But I still didn't think
it was fair.'' . . . Jerry Sichting, former Celtic and current
Timberwolves assistant, thinks the Cavaliers got a good coach in
Randy Wittman. ``He can be tough on guys, but he's also very
positive,'' Sichting said. ``I think he's got a chance to be a real
good one.'' So, too, does Minnesota coach Flip Saunders. ``He's
been around a lot of coaches, both as a player and a coach. That's
always a benefit,'' Saunders said. ``It's a great situation for
him.'' With Wittman's hiring, all vacancies are now filled. Of the
five openings, three were filled by first-time head coaches
(Wittman, Rivers, Gar Heard in Washington). Another went to an
interim (Don Casey in New Jersey), and the last went to Big Chief
Triangle himself, Phil Jackson (Lakers).
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So what to make of the Celtics and Ron Mercer? Are they
lowballing him, or does Mercer have an inflated opinion of himself?
We know Rick Pitino didn't hesitate to shell out more than $50
million for Travis Knight and Chris Mills. We know he didn't
hesitate to re-sign Walter McCarty for $8.4 million. When he
acquired Kenny Anderson, Pitino said one of the undeniable benefits
was that Anderson was locked in long-term. We know only recently,
Pitino said, ``I think, possibly, we can make (Mercer) a real good
offer that he'll be happy with.'' Not. If there is a budget crunch,
as Pitino insists, why should Mercer have to pay for all the
previous signings? ``I can tell you this. Ron is disgusted with the
way management has handled this,'' said Mercer's agent, Tevester
Scott. ``You can't punish him because of what you did before. What
they offered him is embarrassing. We're not even in the same state.
When he called me and told me what it was, we both fell out of our
chairs laughing.'' Well, whether the Celtics' offer amounts to
punishment or insult is, of course, relative. ``We're at the
beginning of the process here,'' said general manager Chris
Wallace. ``I'll leave it at that.'' But after Antoine Walker ($9
million) and Anderson ($6.68 million), the next highest salary
belongs to Vitaly Potapenko ($3.81 million). In other words, the
Celtics may have cap woes, but it's because of a lot of ``average''
salaries doled out to the likes of Greg Minor and Pervis Ellison
(both M.L. Carr signings), as well as Popeye Jones, McCarty and,
incredibly, Dwayne Schintzius. (Why Schintzius was given $2.8
million over two years should warrant a Spotlight Team
investigation. It's not like he had any leverage.) The Celtics can
pay Mercer whatever they want up to the $71 million limit that they
gladly and without hesitation gave Walker. ``Seventy-one million?
Well, that's not close,'' Scott said. ``Let's just say if $71
million is on one side of the mountain, we're not to the point
where we can even see it from the other side.'' . . . Steve Smith
is hoping this Olympic experience is better than his last trip with
USA Basketball. He was a rarely-used 11th man on the 1994 team,
averaging 3 points a game for the team that won the gold medal at
the World Championships in Canada. He's also seeing this summer's
experience as a chance to distance himself from what's going on
with his Atlanta Hawks. They already have traded Mookie Blaylock _
``It came as a surprise to me,'' Smith said _ and rumors abound
that Smith himself may be on the block. ``It's nice to be here and
away from all that,'' Smith said recently in Orlando, the site of
the qualifying team's practices. ``I'm not expecting to be traded,
but nothing would surprise me. This is a business. All I can say is
that we had a lot of injuries when the playoffs came, and to break
us up because of that? I don't approve of it. But I'm not the GM or
the president.'' Smith insists he was not hurt during the Knicks
series, although he looked anything but well. ``I was dead tired,''
he said. ``That's why I didn't play well. I had to go 48 minutes in
the last two Detroit (playoff) games, and then I had to check Allan
Houston and try to stay with Latrell Sprewell. It was fatigue.''
But what about that odious Atlanta offense? ``We lost all our
scorers, except me,'' he said. ``Alan (Henderson), LaPhonso
(Ellis), and Chris (Crawford) all got hurt. They were hurt. I was
tired. And New York played very smart.'' . . . An interesting name
has popped up on the Magic's summer league entry _ Monty Williams.
Had things broken differently, he might have an NBA championship
ring. He was on the Spurs last year but was waived prior to the
season because San Antonio needed perimeter shooters. ``He was a
hard, hard worker,'' Popovich said. ``There wasn't a place for him,
that's all.'' Williams landed briefly in Denver and was also cut by
the Nuggets. He relocated to Orlando and stayed there for the rest
of the season. Williams, of course, had a heart problem in college
while at Notre Dame that has been controlled . . . So, Tim Duncan,
what exactly have you been doing, besides playing for USA
Basketball, since winning the championship? ``Sleeping,'' he said.
``I'm just trying to get my body to recover. I haven't had that
much time to enjoy it. But it was definitely a great honor, and
it's great to see the whole city excited.'' . . . The Celtics open
their California Summer League schedule Sunday night in Long Beach
against Portland. An NBA team can have three roster players, and
participating for Boston will be Tony Battie, Pierce, and
Potapenko. Also on the roster are Eric Riley, Bruce Bowen, and
Marlon Garnett, all free agents, as well as rookies Wayne Turner,
Kevin Ollie, Kris Clack and four others, the most notable being CBA
MVP Adrian Griffin. The team will play eight games in nine days,
returning on the 19th.

SOUL OF TEAM NEEDS A GOOD NIGHT'S REST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News

<P>
   PASADENA _ I've watched soccer players separate shoulders, break
legs, split lips, sprain ankles and crack skulls. I've also watched
soccer players (begin ital)pretend(end ital) to suffer any number
of grievous injuries. Pain _ real or put-on _ is part of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Before Saturday, though, I'd never watched a soccer player
careen head-on into a retaining wall and burst into flames.
</P>
<P>
   OK, Michelle Akers didn't quite go up in smoke when she sailed
grille-first into a Hyundai ad board while chasing a Chinese pass
beyond the U.S. goal early in the Women's World Cup final at the
Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   But the scene _ patched-up chassis tumbling fender over tailpipe
into the boards _ showed the biggest audience of Akers' 14-year
international career why she's the no-brakes jalopy of the U.S.
team and why that's a high compliment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The girl,'' said young teammate Kate Sobero, ``is just out of
control.''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the U.S. victory, in a penalty-kicks-shootout
following 120 minutes of scoreless yet gripping soccer, the
88-degree afternoon of crashes, bangs and headers had taken a
terrible toll on the player known as the heart, soul and sinew of
the American team.
</P>
<P>
   Akers, 33, was in the locker room when it ended, having
collapsed from exhaustion and dehydration after colliding with
another player leaping for a Chinese corner kick in the last minute
of regulation play.
</P>
<P>
   Missing a final whistle was nothing new for the woman who
single-handedly keeps business booming for the manufacturers of
intravenous-fluid bags.
</P>
<P>
   But what a shame Michelle Akers wasn't on the field for this
one, that she wasn't part of the wild on-field celebration, that
she needed support from a U.S. staffer at each elbow simply to walk
to the medal stand, that she was flat on her back on the floor of
another room when President Clinton stopped by the locker room to
tell the champs congratulations.
</P>
<P>
   She wasn't able to take a kick in the shootout. Yet this was her
victory as much as anybody's.
</P>
<P>
   She didn't make it to the interview room either. So we'll have
to wait to ask if this also was her last game.
</P>
<P>
   She sure played as if it were. She wasn't faking for a second.
</P>
<P>
   ``She left it all on the field,'' said U.S. coach Tony DiCicco.
``The fans today were treated to one of the greatest women's
athletes of all time.''
</P>
<P>
   This might not have been Akers at her best. It's been eight
years since she scored a tournament-high 10 goals in the first
Women's World Cup, and since then she has battled Chronic Fatigue
Syndrome to a draw, undergone most of her estimated 12 knee
surgeries, and wondered aloud why opponents' elbows and knees and
toes always seem to land upside her head.
</P>
<P>
   But this was Akers at her (begin ital)most(end ital). She was
all over the field, lobbing shots from outside the penalty area,
winning balls in the air at midfield, stifling Chinese playmakers
in their own end.
</P>
<P>
   ``She put it all on the line for us today,'' said Sara Whalen,
the defender who went into the game when Akers came out. ``I feel
like she knew, `This is the last game, there's no worrying about
whether you could play the next game.'''
</P>
<P>
   Every time Akers hits the turf, the U.S. bench holds it breath.
How many body blows can one woman take? When she hit the turf and
stayed there Saturday, her teammates knew it had to be serious. The
best U.S. penalty-kicker wasn't coming out now for something
trivial _ which in her case means anything this side of a punctured
lung.
</P>
<P>
   Akers writhed in the goal box, clutching her curly head, as
regulation play ticked away. U.S. trainers got her to sit up, but
it was minutes before she could stand, and then she walked as if
stuporous.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way she plays is exhausting,'' U.S. captain Carla Overbeck
said with the shrug of someone who's seen it before.
</P>
<P>
   By the middle of the first 15-minute overtime period, Akers was
well enough to be helped to the locker room. There she took fluids
and began what should be a long rest. Early reports of a concussion
proved unfounded.
</P>
<P>
   Not coincidentally, with Air Akers grounded, the Chinese
threatened repeatedly, the United States saved only by Kristine
Lilly's heads-up clearance off the goal line. ``Our play definitely
went down when she came out,'' assistant coach Lauren Gregg said.
``The way she played today was indicative of a true champion. She
wanted to carry her team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think usually she knows when enough is enough. Today she
just overdid it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Women's World Cup final had everything but a goal. It was as
entertaining a 0-0 game as you'll see. Certainly better than the
'94 Brazil-Italy final in what I suppose we'll have to start
calling the Men's World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, it had 10 penalty kicks that were all on-goal,
not a Baggio job in the bunch.
</P>
<P>
   For another, it had 90 minutes of Michelle Akers, until all the
fuel leaked out.
</P>
<P>
   She missed a heck of a finish.
</P>
<P>
   But not half as much as it missed her. &QL;

MANY HEROINES FOR U.S.
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA _ By the time America is finished enjoying the history
that was made at the Rose Bowl Saturday, savoring it the way a wine
connoisseur might a Merlot, a thousand different storylines will
extend well into the next century.
</P>
<P>
   But the one that stands out most happens to be the simplest of
them all. On the biggest day in the history of women's team sports
in America, the U.S. soccer team won the Women's World Cup because
it played like a team.
</P>
<P>
   America didn't win because Mia Hamm escalated her game to a
Jordan-esque level. It didn't win because goalkeeper Briana Scurry
stood on her head like Dominik Hasek.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. won because they played like the best teams do, with a
collective ego, not 11 disparate ones. There was no singular hero,
just many heroines. I can think of several local professional male
athletes that would benefit from a sermon on team play from these
ladies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The courage of this team ... They didn't allow themselves to
lose,'' said coach Tony DiCicco. ``They epitomized what America is
all about. It was a storybook ending for a team that has its place
in history.''
</P>
<P>
   There were heroines everywhere you looked.
</P>
<P>
   Most obviously, there was Brandi Chastain, the defender from San
Jose, who netted the fifth and final shootout kick that gave the
U.S. the win and ignited a cheer from 90,185 as loud as any ever
heard on New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
   In a game against China in a tournament earlier this year,
Chastain missed a penalty kick in an eventual 2-1 loss. Maybe 1,000
people attended that game in Portugal. The interest and scope
Saturday was significantly greater.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to thank Tony for allowing me to take that kick, after
missing one in that loss to China,'' said Chastain. DiCicco said he
was under orders from CBS host and bandwagoner David Letterman to
let her take a shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being (the) fifth (shooter), there was a lot of pressure. But
I felt very calm. I didn't look at Gao (Hong, the Chinese
goalkeeper). She likes to stare you down and then smile. I didn't
let her.''
</P>
<P>
   And after her shot found net? ``I lost my mind.'' Chastain
doffed her shirt and tossed it into the air, and then was mobbed.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five feet away, a separate mob was hugging goalkeeper
Scurry. The 28-year-old goalkeeper gave Chastain the opportunity to
win it by laying out to block China's third kick in the shootout,
by Liu Ying. Scurry played every shot the same way, aggressively
leaving the stripe toward the shooter and then committing right or
left.
</P>
<P>
   ``She hit it hard, but she didn't place it very well,'' said
Scurry, whose play in the semi against Brazil got the U.S. to the
finals. ``I knew if I could stop one, we'd win, because I was so
confident we'd make all of our shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``You go on instinct. I was aggressive because even if I had a
stop called back, it would be an advantage. (Goalkeepers aren't
supposed to leave the line until the shot is airborne.) I was
confident I could stop at least one.''
</P>
<P>
   Scurry and DiCicco hugged for the longest time after the game.
``I told her before the shootout that all she could be was a hero,
because there are no goats in shootouts.''
</P>
<P>
   There were heroines before the game reached the shootout. Nine
minutes into the first overtime, China sent a corner kick across
the goal mouth that found the head of Fan Yunije. Scurry had moved
out to contest the pass and Fan sent the ball whizzing past her
only to find Kristine Lilly on the goal line, who headed it right
back out.
</P>
<P>
   As far as Lilly is concerned, she only did what she was supposed
to do hug the post, move with the ball and defend the goal line
behind Scurry.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's my job,'' she said. ``I shifted as Briana moved, and
the ball came right at me. I really didn't think at all about what
I did. It happened so fast. All I could think of was running out to
cover another shot.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Kristine is always finding and creating new ways to win
games,'' said DiCicco. ``Scoring goals, making great crosses, clear
midfield, and today standing her line.
</P>
<P>
   China dominated that overtime, in large part because the
ultimate warrior on the U.S. team, Michelle Akers, had left the
field from exhaustion and a headache earned when she dove into a
retaining fence.
</P>
<P>
   Akers, the 33-year-old midfielder who is dogged by Chronic
Fatigue Syndrome, dominated China like a warlord. For all 90
minutes of regulation, the middle of the field was off limits to
China. She bottled up midfield so well that China stopped trying.
</P>
<P>
   Akers was so spent that she barely made it back to the field for
the medal ceremony, and skipped the postgame media sessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very difficult playing without her,'' said captain
Carla Overbeck. ``They got their best chances in that first
overtime. She covers so much ground defensively. Our strategy was
to make China play in small spaces, and we did when Michelle was in
the game.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no way I could ever not give 100 percent knowing what
she goes through just to play,'' said defender Kate Sobrero.
</P>
<P>
   That essentially was the team's mentality for the balance of the
game. Physically and mentally tired, they were down to their last
minutes of World Cup soccer, and they were going to leave it on the
field.
</P>
<P>
   ``The team captains pulled us together,'' said Chastain. ``They
said our hearts are too big for our chests to get tired now. This
was the last 15 minutes of the World Cup. Why save anything?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You just tell your legs that they're not tired,'' said
Overbeck. ``Don't let the dream end here.''
</P>
<P>
   (ital) They (end ital) didn't. And as a result, the dream will
last forever.

<P>
   PASADENA _ Amid an almost surrealistic pageantry of riveting
emotion, patriotic fervor and fierce athletic competitiveness, the
women soccer teams of the United States of America and the People's
Republic of China Saturday staged a compelling show of epic
grandeur at the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, there was no scoring in the 90 minutes of regulation and 30
minutes of overtime, and the outcome of this World Cup championship
match was decided in favor of the Americans because they happened
to make all five of their penalty kicks and China blew one.
</P>
<P>
   But so what?
</P>
<P>
   What distinguished this event and made it so memorable and
perhaps a watershed moment in women athletics considering the
estimated four or five billion people around the world who viewed
it on television was the passionate resilience and relentless
resourcefulness of the combatants.
</P>
<P>
   There still might be a few male spoilsports who sniff derisively
at women athletics, but even the most cynical type had to be
impressed by the competitive ferocity displayed by the participants
throughout the proceedings that unfolded in sweltering conditions.
</P>
<P>
   For a game to be decided in such an unseemly manner as a penalty
kick it's like baseball settling a tie with a home-run hitting
duel, or basketball turning to a free-throw shooting contest was
unfortunate in light of the heroics being dispensed by performers
on both sides throughout the grueling afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   They were like Ali and Frazier in that classic Thrilla in
Manila, bitter adversaries with unshakable wills who were resolved
to settle their differences to the final gasp of breath, or rather,
alas, final penalty kick.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know if this was a game for the ages because neither
side could penetrate the other with a goal, but it certainly was
one that that boosted immeasurably the stature of women athletics.
</P>
<P>
   Never again can even your most enfeebled Male Chauvinistic Pig
sneer at the heart and courage and durability of female jocks
without being hooted into silence by those 90,185 fans in the
Arroyo Seco who saw both the American and Chinese players flash
these qualities in incredible abundance on a humid, draining
86-degree day.
</P>
<P>
   And when it counted most, when the Americans were called on to
attempt their dramatic kicks, when the pressure on this glamorous,
crazily-hyped, wildly-admired group had to be staggering, when they
were without their best penalty kicker, Michelle Akers, Carla
Overbeck, Joy Fawcett, Kristine Lilly, Mia Hamm and Brandi Chastain
coolly and calmly stepped up and fired every shot past China's
goalkeeper, Gao Hong, to the thunderous cheers of the
skimpily-attired audience.
</P>
<P>
   And when Akers went to the sidelines suffering from heat
exhaustion near the end of regulation time and when the Chinese
quickly took advantage of her absence and her midfield artistry in
the first overtime with several charges at the U.S. goal, the
Americans reacted by making one gallant defensive stand after
another including a game-saving header by Kristine Lilly.
</P>
<P>
   As evenly matched as these teams were and the differences
between them were imperceptible it's unfortunate that the outcome
would hinge on one penalty kick miss, even unfortunate that one
team left the Rose Bowl in a state of deep despondency.
</P>
<P>
   But in athletics, as in life itself, the maddening fickleness of
fate so often decides one's destiny and China's destiny was sealed
when Liu Ying's ill-starred penalty kick was flagged down in the
net by Briana Scurry.
</P>
<P>
   If Scurry didn't make her diving stop, this story might not have
made those early Saturday night deadlines because these teams might
have debated the issue well into the late evening.
</P>
<P>
   And, if Eddie Futch didn't throw in the towel for Joe Frazier
against Muhammad Ali, who knows what would have happened had the
two unyielding men resumed hostilities in the 15th round?
</P>
<P>
   ``We were starting to run out of gas in the first overtime,''
said Tony DiCicco, the American coach. ``We'd lost Michelle Akers,
and I think we were a little fatigued. But we came back in the
second overtime, and then we made all our penalty kicks. We never
quit and never gave an inch and were able to overcome adversity. I
think what we did out there epitomized what being an American is
all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the same can be said about the doughty Chinese ladies
one must be reminded that, after all, it was only one misguided
penalty kick that separated these teams but DiCicco can be excused
for such jingoism in the flushed heat of victory.
</P>
<P>
   There were distinct political overtones not so far beneath the
surface in this match, considering the tragic incident that
happened on May 8 when the U.S. mistakenly bombed the Chinese
embassy in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   The two nations have had strained relations since, but that
didn't keep this country's sterling commander and chief of the
armed forces, President Bill Clinton, from taking in the
festivities.
</P>
<P>
   The fact he was 30 minutes late, kept several thousand fuming
fans from reaching their seats in time for the start of the game,
and tied up the pressbox elevators for an hour was quite irrelevant
since the legendary victor over Yugoslavia was able to make it for
his three-minute halftime interview on ABC with Robin Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   And the smiling Prez also made it into the dressing room
afterward of both teams, offering his heartfelt congratulations to
the Americans and his heartfelt sympathies to the Chinese in a
stirring display of his fabled triangulations.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton wasn't the only big name on the premises. Natch, Jack
Nicholson was present, and I almost bumped into Big Daddy himself,
Adam Sandler, before the game near the FIFA headquarters outside
the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   It seems as though everyone who's anyone is now warmly embracing
these American gals, who have created quite a stir across the
country with their extraordinary skills, toughness and elan.
</P>
<P>
   And the fact that they didn't fail in their greatest challenge,
and performed nobly against a Chinese team that was their mirror
image will only enhance their burgeoning popularity.
</P>
<P>
   After Brandi Chastain made the penalty kick that assured the
Americans of a place in this nation's athletic pantheon, she and
her teammates hugged and slapped hands and waved to the crowd and
took a victory lap around the old stadium.
</P>
<P>
   It was a poignant scene, and the fans, notorious in these parts
for their hasty exits, remained in their seats for at least 20
minutes, savoring the triumph of a U.S. team that unlike so many of
its tiresomely boorish athletic contemporaries is a magical joy to
watch.

AMERICAN WOMEN BACK ON TOP OF SOCCER WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ They had heard it said that the final was
almost irrelevant, that the larger victory had already been won.
The US women's soccer team won when they filled Giants Stadium
three weeks ago. They won when the president came to watch them
play _ twice. They won when David Letterman adopted them as his
late-night mascots. They won when hundreds of notebooks and cameras
chronicled them, when thousands of ``ponytailed hooligans''
screeched for their autographs.
</P>
<P>
   But the Babes of Summer knew, finally, that they couldn't win
without winning the World Cup, without squelching their Chinese
rivals yet again, without reclaiming the golden trophy they'd lost
four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   So when Brandi Chastain slammed home the fifth and decisive
penalty kick after 120 scoreless minutes in the Rose Bowl Saturday
afternoon, the Americans got what meant most to them _ the victory
that affirms their legacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last five games have been for all of America to jump on
our backs,'' forward Tiffeny Milbrett was saying, a cell phone at
her ear and a gold medal around her neck. ``This was for us. That's
why we wanted it so bad. We had come from so far and done so much.
We wanted to be able to go out right.''
</P>
<P>
   Wasn't this their tournament? It had certainly been promoted
that way. This event was always about America and America's
feelings not only about soccer but also about women. This was about
gender equity and the backdrop was the Nike TV spot showing Mia
Hamm and Michael Jordan facing off in their
anything-you-can-do-I-can-do duel.
</P>
<P>
   This was not so much a World Cup as it was an American Cup with
the rest of the world invited. It was organized by Americans. It
was marketed by American companies. And 95 percent of the tickets
were sold to Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The whole point of hosting the World Cup was to get the women's
game on the radar screen here. The question in 1994, when the US
hosted the men's Cup for the first time, was whether Americans
would pay top dollar to watch soccer. The question this summer was
whether they would pay to watch women play it.
</P>
<P>
   That question was answered on the first day, when nearly 79,000
people jammed into Giants Stadium to watch the US play Denmark.
When the crowds kept coming, when TV ratings kept rising
(surpassing hockey's Stanley Cup), when the media hordes approached
Super Bowl size, when everybody in the country knew that Joy
Fawcett had two kids and Michelle Akers had chronic fatigue and
Chastain had posed nude, nobody was sure what it all meant.
</P>
<P>
   Was this the first swell of a societal sea change? Or merely
Monet with corner kicks? Was this merely Americans infatuated with
the Big Event? Or had they put women's soccer up there with Major
League Baseball and the NFL and the NBA? If the US women had gone
three-and-out and foreigners had been playing for the title, would
anyone have cared?
</P>
<P>
   No doubt, it mattered hugely that the Americans were expected to
win. As soon as they won a match, tens of thousands of tickets were
snapped up for their next one. ``We could have sold 120,000 seats
for the final,'' organizing committee president Marla Messing said.
Everybody, it seemed, wanted to be there with painted faces when
their Babes of Summer finished this summer blockbuster by carrying
the Cup over their heads.
</P>
<P>
   The final was irrelevant _ until the US got there. Then it
became imperative to win it. ``We had a lot of pressure,'' said
Tisha Venturini. ``So many people told us, `You're going to win.
You've got to win for this to be successful.' Just to be able to
say after all this that we did do that . . . that's a big
achievement.''
</P>
<P>
   You could see the strain on the Americans' faces Saturday as the
scoreless minutes ticked on. You could sense their anxiety when
Akers, who'd won the Cup for them in 1991, was helped out of the
match and into the locker room. You could almost hear the giant
whoosh of relief when they saw ageless Kristine Lilly (``The Queen
of Caps'') leap high to head out the ball that would have beaten
them in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   And when Chastain walked to the spot to take the final kick, you
knew her teammates were aware of the dramatic irony. It was
Chastain who had put her penalty kick off the crossbar when the US
lost by a goal to the Chinese in Portugal in March. It was Chastain
who kicked the ball into her own net against the Germans. Now, it
was Chastain who brought them to glory, then ripped off her jersey
and fell to her knees in delight and thanks.
</P>
<P>
   This was a Hollywood finish to a made-in-America story. ``People
will keep this in their memory a long time,'' Chastain said. ``The
lasting impression will be that 20 people on the field gave their
all. Not only for themselves, but for their country.''

HAMM MAKES QUIET CONTRIBUTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM BARRERO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA _ America's most famous soccer player couldn't have
been more overjoyed that the latest chapter to her career ended
perfectly, even though she didn't do much of the writing.
</P>
<P>
   For three weeks, Mia Hamm, Team USA's ubiquitous star, reminded
anyone who would listen that this tournament was about her team and
her sport.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't about her icon status or commercials with Michael
Jordan or her ebullience, which places a smile on the face of
corporate America and sends millions of girls shrieking every time
they see her.
</P>
<P>
   True to her word, Hamm relished her team's World Cup victory
over China on Saturday _ a (begin ital)team(end ital) victory that
took 120 grueling minutes to achieve _ and she never once hinted it
mattered that her contributions won't be found in a box score.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just pure elation right now,'' said Hamm, who looked
fatigued. ``It's just so emotional.''
</P>
<P>
   Those emotions nearly overwhelmed Hamm when she was asked what
it meant to have her husband, Christian Corry, in attendance.
Corry, a Marine Corps pilot, was granted a temporary leave from his
post in Japan to attend the match.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's sacrificed so much. . . . We've both sacrificed a lot,''
Hamm said as tears welled in her eyes. ``It means so much to me to
have him here.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, when Hamm walked into the media tent, she
inconspicuously snaked her way through the crowd to an interview
chair, noticing that two of the game's heroes _ goalkeeper Briana
Scurry and defender Brandi Chastain _ had started their one-on-one
sessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We love you Brandi, We love you Bri,'' Hamm yelled, sounding
every bit like the girls who shout her name with such voracity.
</P>
<P>
   After sitting down, Hamm joked with reporters that it was a good
thing a chair had been provided.
</P>
<P>
   ``It I had to stand,'' Hamm lamented, ``I'd probably collapse.''
</P>
<P>
   And with good reason.
</P>
<P>
   Hamm played every minute and scored a penalty kick, but she
couldn't believe it when assistant coach Lauren Gregg submitted her
name as one of the five penalty-kick takers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not very good at penalty kicks, so I asked Lauren if maybe
Mac (Shannon MacMillan) should take it,'' Hamm said. ``But she said
it was too late to change the order.''
</P>
<P>
   Gregg said her decision was simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just have the utmost confidence in Mia,'' Gregg said.
</P>
<P>
   During regulation, Hamm's runs down both sides of the field
generated a number of chances for the U.S. But for the fourth
consecutive game, she did not score _ leading some to wonder what
was wrong with America's soccer darling.
</P>
<P>
   But Gregg would have none of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mia clearly was one of our most consistent players this whole
tournament,'' Gregg said. ``What people don't realize is when she
runs, the defense goes with her. . . . She's had an incredible
impact.''
</P>
<P>
   And Gregg said Hamm's impact works both ways, although most
probably don't notice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her defensive mentality is a cornerstone of our team
defense,'' said Gregg, referring to the numerous times Hamm helped
thwart China's attacks. ``It makes the job of the rest of the
team's defense so much easier. In my opinion, this was probably her
most consistent world event ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Consistency, teamwork and a championship. Hamm couldn't ask for
anything better.

U.S. WINS WOMEN'S WORLD CUP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM THOMAS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ The Rock was just a little stronger than The
Wall.
</P>
<P>
   In a match worthy of all the hoopla surrounding the finest
women's sporting event ever staged, U.S. goalkeeper Briana ``The
Rock'' Scurry made the decisive save that catapulted the Americans
to the 1999 Women's World Cup championship Saturday at the Rose
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Scurry's diving stop on China's third penalty kick of the
shootout allowed the U.S. team to finally find a crack in the
Chinese goaltending. The Americans made all of their shots against
an otherwise brilliant goalkeeper, Gao Hong, who deservedly owns
the nickname ``The Great Wall of China.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. defender Brandi Chastain coolly placed the final shot past
Gao for a 5-4 shootout win after a scoreless 120 minutes. Chastain
then stripped off her jersey in celebration before a record crowd
of 90,185.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a team of courage,'' U.S. Coach Tony DiCicco said
before heading to the wild locker room. ``They fought and fought
through so many things to win this tournament, not the least of
which was an outstanding China team. I'm very, very proud.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. won its second of the three World Cups, avenging a loss
to Norway in the semifinals of the 1995 Cup and a defeat to China
in last spring's Algarve Cup.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first Women's World Cup to be decided by a shootout.
While many will argue that is not the best way to determine the
international champion, players on both sides were spent after 90
minutes of regulation and two 15-minute extra periods on a warm
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   That left the outcome on the shoulders of the two goalkeepers
and the five shooters from each team. Scurry, who had been
outstanding throughout the tournament, was the difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told her that all she could be in a shootout is a hero,
nothing else,'' DiCicco said. ``Bri was the hero.''
</P>
<P>
   Scurry said she had a feeling when China's Liu Ying stepped up
to take the third shot that she was going to make the save. The
27-year-old native of Dayton, Minn., dived to her left to knock
aside the attempt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just had a feeling I was going to get that one,'' Scurry
said. ``I don't know how or why.
</P>
<P>
   ``I read it well and she hit it hard, but I was able to get
there. I went totally on instinct. I knew that I just had to make
one save, because our kickers would do it for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The first two U.S. shooters were the team's ``Soccer Moms,''
Carla Overbeck and Joy Fawcett. Each buried kicks past Gao, as did,
in turn, Kristine Lilly, Mia Hamm and Chastain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was momentary insanity,'' Chastain said of her post-kick
celebration. ``That's all it was.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a fitting end to a game in which both teams bared all.
The match had almost everything _ great defense, strong midfield
play, end-to-end action and drama. Everything, except goals.
Neither side was able to find a weakness or take control
offensively. China had 12 shots, three on goal, while the U.S. had
11, five on goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both teams had great performances,'' China Coach Ma Yuanan
said. ``The American team was more fortunate than us.''
</P>
<P>
   While the goalkeepers were nearly flawless, the U.S. was
fortunate to get its biggest save of the match from a forward _
Lilly.
</P>
<P>
   In the 100th minute, China took a corner kick that forced Scurry
slightly out of position. Fan Yunjie knocked a header to Scurry's
left, only to find Lilly standing on the line, nearly in the net.
She rejected the shot with a header to turn away China's best
opportunity to end the affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kristine Lilly is one of the best players in the world,''
DiCicco said. ``She always seems to find and invent ways to win
games, and this was just another way.''
</P>
<P>
   Chastain said Lilly ``did her job, nothing more and nothing
less.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was right where she was suppose to be, when she was
suppose to be. She made a huge contribution to the team right
there.''
</P>
<P>
   The save came just when China was starting to gain momentum, in
part because of the absence of star U.S. midfielder Michelle Akers.
During a Chinese corner kick just before the end of regulation,
Akers was knocked in the head by Scurry and left the match because
of what was described as heat exhaustion and a slight concussion.
Akers, who suffers from chronic fatigue syndrome, was not expected
to need hospitalization.
</P>
<P>
   DiCicco said Akers' willingness to sacrifice herself for the
victory epitomized the U.S. team's performance throughout the
three-week tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it came down to was these players not allowing themselves
to lose,'' DiCicco said. ``It was a storybook ending for a team
that has a place in history.'' &QL;

   PHOENIX - Again and again and again, it keeps happening. Randy
Johnson takes the mound for the Diamondbacks and gets no offensive
support.
</P>
<P>
   When will it end? When will the zeroes go away? When will the
left-hander get a win, let alone a run?
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks continued their futility at the plate with
Johnson pitching Saturday, and lost to the Oakland Athletics, 2-0,
before 36,042 fans at Bank One Ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's weird,'' catcher Damian Miller said. ``There's no
explanation for it, really. He goes out and busts his butt and we
run into a buzz saw every time.''
</P>
<P>
   This time, it was another rookie right-hander, Tim Hudson, who
had only six previous major league starts to his credit, before
giving up just three hits and striking out nine in 8 innings. It
was his longest big-league outing.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Taylor got the last two outs for his 22nd save that lifted
Oakland to .500 (43-43). The combined pitching effort matched the
best the A's have had all season.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks (47-41) fell 3{ games behind the San Francisco
Giants in the National League West.
</P>
<P>
   Zero, one, two and two. Those are the number of hits the
Diamondbacks have provided Johnson in his last four starts. St.
Louis rookie Jose Jimenez no-hit and two-hit the Diamondbacks in
two of those starts.
</P>
<P>
   The All-Star lost for the fifth straight time, while lowering
his league-leading ERA to 2.95 and collecting his 13th double-digit
strikeout game this season. He whiffed 11 A's, giving him a
league-best 211, before leaving after seven innings. He gave up
three hits, including a homer to Tim Raines to start the game _ the
same man who gave Johnson the nickname ``Big Unit'' when they were
teammates on the Montreal Expos.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you want me to say?'' Johnson said. ``I've been
pitching as good as I can. I know the guys are trying as hard as
they can. We're just going up against some pitchers who are
throwing some goose eggs up there.''
</P>
<P>
   This is getting rather redundant, though. In the last 34 innings
Johnson has pitched, the Diamondbacks have failed to score. In his
last four starts, Johnson has struck out 54, given up 19 hits and
allowed five earned runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It be hard pressed for anybody to have four games in a row to
pitch that well and come on the bad end of it four times,''
reliever Dan Plesac said. ``It's baffling.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has never had a streak this bizarre and baffling before.
</P>
<P>
   Third baseman Matt Williams can't explain it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't speak for everybody,'' said Williams, who is 0 for 8
in this series against the A's. ``I was swinging at bad pitches and
you're not going to hit if you do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Hudson had the Diamondbacks grounding out and popping up with a
90 mile per hour forkball and an array of off-speed pitches.
</P>
<P>
   After left fielder Luis Gonzalez blooped a double in the first
inning, the Diamondbacks failed to get a base runner to second base
the rest of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Hudson, who has been outstanding (5-1, 2.09 ERA) since being
called up from the minors in early June, said he wasn't in awe of
the pitching matchup and the FOX regional television coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not pitching against Randy Johnson,'' Hudson said. ``I'm
pitching against their hitting.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson didn't start the game sharp. The first pitch Johnson
threw, Raines ripped an estimated 364 feet just into the left-field
seats for a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't believe we got a run that early,'' Hudson said.
``Any time you get a lead in the first inn

<P>
   PHOENIX - When relief pitcher Matt Mantei walked into the
Diamondbacks' locker room for the first time, he got a lonely and
chilly reception.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was nobody in here,'' Mantei said in the air-conditioned
locker room after the Diamondbacks' 2-0 loss on Saturday afternoon.
``They were all outside playing the game. I got in a little late
today and we ``got'' a little miscommunication on my flight out
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Diamondback players and fans hope that's one of the only miscues
Mantei will have this season.
</P>
<P>
   In hopes of bolstering their fragile bullpen, the Diamondbacks
traded relief pitcher VladimirNunez, minor leaguer Brad Penny and a
player to be named no later than Oct. 15 for Mantei. The
Diamondbacks bullpen is clearly a weakness for the team. This
season, the bullpen has blown 14 of 29 save opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   The newly acquired Diamondback will earn $735,000 this year.
Mantei will be eligible for salary arbitration at the end of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Diamondbacks managing general partner Jerry Colangelo said that
minor league prospects Nick Bierbrod and John Patterson aren't
candidates for the player to be named later.
</P>
<P>
   After arriving late at the park following flights from Miami and
Las Vegas, Mantei met his new teammates on the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody greeted me nicely in the dugout and I clicked pretty
well down in the bullpen,'' Mantei said.
</P>
<P>
   Mantei, a native of Tampa, said even though he's excited about
jumping into a division race, his thoughts still linger in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Mantei's trade came on Matt Mantei Pin Night at Pro Player
Stadium. Mantei said before he left the park, he grabbed about 50
pins as a going-away memento.
</P>
<P>
   ``I miss Florida,'' Mantei said. ``I've been there for five
years and it was a great organization and they took care of me and
were patient with me. I felt like I owed them something.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did me a favor getting me out of there. (General Manager
Dave) Dombrowski said I should be somewhere I'm going to pitch more
and get some more innings, so they sent me here.''
</P>
<P>
   This season, Mantei has converted 10 of 12 saves for the
Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   Mantei, 26, is a right-hander who throws in the mid to high 90s.
He was 1-2 with a 2.72 ERA and 50 strikeouts in 36 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Mantei's only flaw is a history of health problems early in his
career. The most serious was a thickness in his rotator-cuff, which
had to be scoped in August 1996. Mantei sat out the entire 1997
season so he could rehab his shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Pitching coach Mark Connor gave the trade a thumbs up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody know this kid has got great stuff,'' Connor said.
``He's an up-and-coming guy. We traded two young pitchers, one of
whom is in the big leagues now, for another young pitcher who has
had success in the big leagues on a regular basis. We feel good
about the trade.''
</P>
<P>
   Connor described Mantei as a classic closing pitcher with a good
curveball and even better fastball.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing about having a guy with the velocity he throws with
is you don't necessarily have to have pinpoint control,'' Connor
said. ``If you're going to make a mistake the hitter isn't going to
hit it because of the velocity on the pitch. They don't have time
to react.''
</P>
<P>
   The only request Mantei made of the Diamondbacks was to play
``Ice,'' ``Ice, Baby'' over the PA system when he's introduced in a
game.
</P>
<P>
   Mantei was given the nickname ``Iceman'' by former Marlins
pitcher and current New York Met Al Leiter because of his likeness
to the former rapper.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, barring the baseball scar on his upper lip, Mantei does
bear a resemblance to Vanilla Ice.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he did own ``To the Extreme'' when he was in high school.
</P>
<P>
   No, he doesn't have any of the musician's albums today.
</P>
<P>
   With youthful eagerness, Mantei said he's itching to get on the
mound after a four-day rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to go out there and have fun like I've always had
and just enjoy myself and get the job done and not change a
thing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm anxious to get the first one out of the way, that's the
hardest thing to get out of the way.'' &QL;

GONZALEZ TEAMS UP WITH BOYHOOD HERO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By AL TOBY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - When outfielder Luis Gonzalez is offered pancakes for
breakfast by a waiter or waitress, it usually isn't a big deal.
</P>
<P>
   Getting offered pancakes by baseball legend Pete Rose is
something totally different.
</P>
<P>
   ``Luis, want some pancakes?'' Rose casually asked while standing
in a small breakfast line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Uh, no thanks,'' Gonzalez said with a childish smirk.
</P>
<P>
   After breakfast Gonzalez and his boyhood hero spent Saturday
morning at a sports card show at the North Phoenix Baptist Church.
The two signed autographs for fans and waxed about the state of the
sport they love.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched him play throughout almost his whole career,''
Gonzalez said. ``He was my favorite player growing up in Tampa. The
'75 Big Red Machine was my all-time favorite team.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was Charlie Hustle, always diving for everything. That's
the guy I always looked up to.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez first met Rose more than 20 years ago in Tampa, where
the Reds held spring training. At the training camp Rose signed a
picture for the young Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a big thrill for me to meet him out there as a kid,''
Gonzalez said.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez wasn't the first in his family to formally meet Rose.
His younger brother and other Little League baseball players shot a
soup commercial with Rose in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got a couple of chuckles from the pictures,'' Gonzalez
said.
</P>
<P>
   Rose, baseball's all-time hits leader with 4,256, said he
doesn't have to give Gonzalez any hitting tips.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy's batting .360,'' Rose said. ``I couldn't hit that
high. He's got the right tools. He just works hard, is on time and
uses the whole field.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Too many guys go up there wanting to be home-run hitters and
always pull the ball. You got to use the whole field.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose said the change from the lowly Detroit Tigers to the
successful Diamondbacks has been a big factor in Gonzalez's
hitting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing to do when you're a baseball player is have fun,''
Rose said. ``And it's fun when you're winning. That's 30-40 points
in your batting average, I think, as opposed to playing as an
individual. It was no fun for him playing in Detroit.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez is clearly having fun with the Diamondbacks. His .362
batting average is third-best in the National League.
</P>
<P>
   This year Gonzalez chased after Rose's National League record
44-game hitting streak. Gonzalez's streak ended at 30 games.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Gonzalez will play in his first All-Star game,
joining teammates Randy Johnson, Matt Williams and Jay Bell.
</P>
<P>
   Rose said he was happy to see Gonzalez selected as a reserve,
but wished that Texas Rangers outfielder Juan Gonzalez wouldn't
have opted out of the midsummer classic.
</P>
<P>
   The Ranger outfielder said he wouldn't play in the game unless
he was named a starter for the American League outfield. Thanks in
part to Cleveland fans' ballot box-stuffing approach, Indian
outfielders Kenny Lofton and Manny Ramirez will start. Seattle
Mariner Ken Griffey Jr. will join the two Indians for the American
League's starting outfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't agree with (Juan) Gonzalez,'' Rose said. ``He's a
great player and has had a couple of great MVP years, but he
shouldn't get offended because people out of Texas don't know who
the hell he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose, who played in a time where the players had a say in the
All-Star roster, said the current system is the best way to have an
All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the fans' game,'' Rose said. ``It's a popularity game.''

MERCURY MUST STOP SLIDE IN LA  
 PLAYOFF HOPES RIDE ON SPARKING A TURNAROUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF METCALFE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ In the midst of last year's extended losing
streak, now a Mercury annual tradition, Michelle Griffiths vowed
damage control before the string equaled a franchise high of six.
</P>
<P>
   And Griffiths was one of five players in double figures when
Phoenix blew out Washington, 88-59, to stop the 1998 bleeding at
five and begin a climb to the WNBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is increasingly dire today as five straight
defeats place the Mercury at 3-9, last in the Western Conference,
with only one valid path to meaningful recovery. Beat the Los
Angeles Sparks (9-5) here today and twice more in the next 10 days
to remain near the third and final West playoff berth.
</P>
<P>
   Narrow losses to LA (67-61) and West leader Houston (71-70) this
week prove Phoenix finally is playing well enough to beat a quality
opponent. But nothing shy of wins _ the franchise record being a
modest four in a row _ will have any effect in turning around a
season without back-to-back Ws.
</P>
<P>
   Griffiths, in the final trimester of her pregnancy, can have no
say in today's streak-busting try. But those who will include
6-foot-8 Maria Stepanova, who has quietly made an impact in three
consecutive games (combined 16 points, 13 rebounds, 5 blocks) and
is edging toward a primetime role.
</P>
<P>
   The idea with 7.3 seconds left against Houston Friday was for
Lisa Harrison to lob inbounds to Stepanova, coming off a Michele
Timms screen, hoping at minimum for a foul and a chance from the
free-throw line to upend the Comets. That play never developed, and
Phoenix's final shot was a missed baseline jumper by Jennifer
Gillom.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to have 11 people play hard for 40 minutes,''
Mercury Coach Cheryl Miller said. ``Whether that's bringing your
offensive game, your defensive game, whatever you can contribute
that night, you have to make sure you bring. Before you step on the
floor, you have to already predecide what you're going to bring to
this team and do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Against the Sparks on Wednesday, the Mercury struck gold with a
three-guard perimeter from the pool of Timms, Bridget Pettis, Edna
Campbell and Kristi Harrower. But that lineup saw little time vs.
Houston as Harrison started at small forward and played a
season-high 31 minutes to defend against Sheryl Swoopes.
</P>
<P>
   If 6-3 Gillom and 6-5 Marlies Askamp or Stepanova again are
effective today against 6-5 Lisa Leslie and 6-1 DeLisha Milton
(combined 15 points Wednesday), the Mercury could revert to small
ball to energize its transition game.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix shot 51.6 percent in the second half of the LA game
after a 25.8 percent first half, then was at 38.5 percent vs.
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks' franchise-high six-game win streak came to an end
Friday with a 77-72 loss to surging Sacramento (10-4), winner of
five of its last six.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to find a starting lineup that can jump-start us,''
LA Coach Orlando Woolridge said.
</P>
<P>
   That could mean Ukari Figgs, due back from a sprained ankle
after the All-Star Game on Wednesday, in guard tandem with
Yugoslavian Gordana Grubin rather than Penny Toler and Tamecka
Dixon.
</P>
<P>
   Today, though, the Mercury must account for 6-3 forward
La'Keshia Frett, who backed her 13-point outburst in Phoenix with
15 against Sacramento. Mismatches that put Frett or 5-11 Mwadi
Mabika against 5-7 Timms and 5-4 Harrower helped the Sparks on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Because Washington escaped double overtime with its fourth win
Saturday, only the 1998 East champion Cleveland Rockers have a
worse record than the Mercury. Rockers Coach Linda Hill-MacDonald,
at risk of losing her job after guiding the East in the All-Star
Game, has the excuse of 6-5 center Isabelle Fijalkowski not
returning to the league.

GONE BUT NOT FORGOTTEN  
 IMPACT LINGERS LONG AFTER DEMISE OF UPSTART LEAGUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By CRAIG MORGAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   They were revolutionaries battling oppression _ pioneers in a
sport where little had changed in 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   Like ghosts of a bygone era, they will gather today in Windsor,
Ontario, to mark the 26 years since the World Hockey Association
completed its inaugural season.
</P>
<P>
   Gone are the banana-curved sticks, the candy-striped referee
shirts and the blue and red pucks.
</P>
<P>
   Gone are all but four of the 18 franchises that dotted the WHA
map.
</P>
<P>
   Gone into retirement are the owners, coaches and all but one
player. And gone are the hopes of establishing a true rival to the
National Hockey League's dominance.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, while the WHA never seriously challenged the NHL's hockey
supremacy _ expiring after seven seasons _ the upstart league left
a permanent mark on the sport and changed the course of
professional hockey irreversibly.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to competition for players, the WHA succeeded in driving
up salaries while pioneering rule changes and introducing hockey to
markets the NHL never dreamed of entering.
</P>
<P>
   It also extended the playing careers of a pair of hockey legends
while allowing up-and-comers such as Wayne Gretzky, Mark Messier,
Mike Gartner and Robbie Ftorek to take their first baby steps
toward superstardom.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a fluke league,'' said hockey great Gordie Howe, who
played six seasons in the WHA with Houston and New England after a
Hall of Fame career with the Detroit Red Wings.
</P>
<P>
   ``They kept marketing it by saying, `It's not the NHL but it's
almost as good,' but I still feel the team we had in Houston could
have moved into the NHL and been in the top five.
</P>
<P>
   ``The WHA had some great players and some great teams. If we
just had a little more money behind us, we might have been able to
maintain it.'' &QL; 
Laughter, yawns &QL; 
The year was 1971. The Vietnam War was driving a philosophical
wedge through the heart of the nation. Ex-Beatle John Lennon had
just launched his solo career with the release of ``Imagine'' and a
young New York native named Julius Erving was getting ready to
reshape basketball and hairstyles in his first year in the ABA.
</P>
<P>
   The WHA's 12-team launch barely registered on the North American
consciousness. And when it did, it drew two prevailing reactions _
laughter and yawns.
</P>
<P>
   Not even the WHA's chief rival, the NHL, paid much heed. The
NHL's most storied franchise, the Montreal Canadiens, had just won
the Stanley Cup and the league had the world's premier players in
Bobby Hull, Howe and Bobby Orr.
</P>
<P>
   Given hockey's largely Canadian roots and the sport's regional
confinement in the U.S., launching a rival league in mostly
American markets seemed a curious venture. But equally vexing to
league founders Dennis Murphy and Gary Davidson was the utter
disdain with which their idea was greeted in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember I got on a plane and went up there to try and sell
the idea and I got the hell beaten out of me,'' said Murphy, who
also served a stint as general manager of the ABA's Miami
Floridians. ``The Canadians took the attitude `Why do we need you
to talk to us about hockey? What do you know about hockey?'
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Gary Davidson right then and there that I didn't think
our chances were very good.''
</P>
<P>
   But the NHL had one key chink in its armor _ the reserve clause,
which allowed teams to renew a player's contract upon termination
without the player's permission.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the WHA, the NHL was like a monopoly and the players
were basically stuck with that arrangement,'' said Gartner, a
former Phoenix Coyote, whose professional career started in 1978
with the WHA's Cincinnati Stingers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no free agency like today. There wasn't much player
movement and owners basically paid us what they wanted. The WHA
finally gave us some leverage.''
</P>
<P>
   With the debut of the WHA there were 250 player spots to be
filled and the WHA needed star attractions if it hoped to survive
in a lukewarm hockey market. The league filled many of the spots
with marginal NHL players and career minor leaguers, while also
culling the untapped American college ranks.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the WHA drew rancorous laughter from its older
counterpart when it selected many of the NHL's top players at the
first draft in 1972. Since most NHL contracts were no longer than
two years, the WHA reasoned it would have an opportunity to talk to
players in the near future. But the NHL brass, headed by President
Clarence Campbell, questioned why anyone would want to join a
league with no history.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NHL was very arrogant toward us and I dare say we never
would have gotten started had it not been for the leadership they
had under Clarence Campbell,'' Murphy said. ``It was simple. They
never imagined they were vulnerable.''
</P>
<P>
   That all changed when Toronto Maple Leafs goaltender Bernie
Parent, a future Hall of Famer, signed a contract with the Miami
Screaming Eagles in February of 1972. Under intense pressure from
NHL owners not to give in to higher salary demands, Toronto made no
attempt to re-sign Parent.
</P>
<P>
   The ``coup de grace'' came four months later when Winnipeg Jets
owner Ben Hatskin wooed Hull away from the Chicago Blackhawks with
a $1 million signing bonus and a 10-year, $2.5 million contract,
making him the highest paid hockey player in the world.
</P>
<P>
   With one of its all-time greats in the fold, the NHL could no
longer ignore the WHA. Moreover, Hull's signing emboldened other
players to jump ship. Boston star goaltender Gerry Cheevers signed
with Calgary, Montreal defenseman J.C. Tremblay signed with Quebec
and Boston's Derek Sanderson signed with Philadelphia for $2.65
million.
</P>
<P>
   Mixed bag &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the start of the inaugural 1972-73 season, the WHA had enough
marquee players to attract substantial interest.
</P>
<P>
   The first season was a mixed bag. Eleven of the 12 teams
remained in playoff contention for most of the season and, despite
a Blackhawks-imposed injunction that kept him out of the league for
15 games, Hull did not disappoint, scoring 51 goals and 103 points
in just 63 games.
</P>
<P>
   The season also saw the emergence of young stars like
Philadelphia's Andre Lacroix (league-best 124 points) and Danny
Lawson (league-high 61 goals).
</P>
<P>
   The New England Whalers won the AVCO Cup as league champion in
the first season, defeating the Jets, 4-1, in the best of seven
championship series.
</P>
<P>
   But throughout the year the league struggled financially. Two
teams averaged close to 7,000 fans per game but the league average
was just 5,298.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Raiders played to tiny crowds at Madison Square
Garden, while the Chicago Cougars changed owners like underwear and
spent a season at tiny Randhurst Shopping Center in an arena that
seated about 2,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember having a ticket drive to sell season tickets in
Cincinnati and Pete Rose came and bought four tickets,'' said Tampa
Bay Lightning Coach Jacques Demers, who coached three seasons in
the WHA with Indianapolis, Cincinnati and Quebec. ``We were hoping
he'd buy 4,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the Stingers, attendance problems were part of
a growing trend. While Canadian franchises like Edmonton, Winnipeg
and Quebec saw increases in attendance, the American franchises
were constantly folding or changing cities due to lack of interest
and revenue to pay their high-priced players.
</P>
<P>
   After the league topped out at 14 teams in the 1974-75 season,
Chicago, Minnesota and Denver disbanded the following year with
Toronto, San Diego, Calgary and Phoenix soon to follow.
</P>
<P>
   In its final season, 1978-79, the WHA sported just six teams
with the Indianapolis Racers closing up shop early in the year.
</P>
<P>
   Thugs, pioneers &QL; 
Thuggery was a serious concern in the WHA with many of the marginal
players hanging on based on their ability to mix it up. The
Minnesota Fighting Saints lived up to their name with a memorable
brawl against Chicago and Calgary and Quebec squared off in a 1976
melee that required police officers to subdue it.
</P>
<P>
   But the league was also busy pioneering a free-wheeling, passing
and skating-based game that was a stark contrast to the NHL's
classic dump and chase. Nobody exhibited that style better than the
Coyotes' predecessors, the Winnipeg Jets.
</P>
<P>
   After a pair of disappointing seasons Winnipeg's ownership
realized it needed players to complement Hull's brilliance. Few
inroads had been made in the European market before the Jets dove
headlong into the continent and produced Swedish star forwards
Anders Hedberg, Ulf Nilsson and defenseman Lars-Erik Sjoberg.
</P>
<P>
   Paired with Hull on the Jets top line, the Swedes worked magic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did a few line rushes with him, and Ulf and I just looked
at each other,'' said Hedberg, who was first wooed to Winnipeg by
team physician Jerry Wilson. ``You could just feel it would work.
Somehow we already knew where each other was going to be. We said,
`This is too good to be true.' But we were scared to talk to Bobby
about it because he was such a big star.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple days later Bobby called Jerry Wilson and said, `It
can't be true. Three guys can't work that well together.' ''.
</P>
<P>
   They did. That season Hull broke Phil Esposito's NHL goal record
of 76 with 77 goals in 78 games while adding 65 assists. Hedberg
had 53 goals and 47 assists and Nilsson had 26 goals and 94
assists. Winnipeg would go on to win two AVCO Cups with the group
and three in all.
</P>
<P>
   The WHA continued raiding Europe for players. Hartford signed
Swedish defensive siblings Christer and Thommie Abrahamsson and
Toronto inked Czech's Vaclav Nedomansky and Richard Farda.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like this whole new world we had never seen before and
we ended up putting a lot of great players on the map,'' Demers
said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the unique style of play and the increasing number of
marquee names, financial problems continued to plague the league
until talk of a merger with the NHL finally surfaced in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until 1979, with the retirement of Campbell and the
obvious draw of Gretzky, that the NHL finally approved the deal
thanks to the efforts of former Roadrunners President and General
Manager Bill McFarland.
</P>
<P>
   ``(New NHL President) John Ziegler and I were classmates and
good friends at the University of Michigan,'' McFarland said.
``(Union chief) Alan Eagleson fought the merger all along, but by
that time he was pretty much on his own.''
</P>
<P>
   With all the hurdles removed, four WHA teams joined the NHL in
time for the 1979-80 season: Winnipeg, Quebec, Hartford and
Gretzky's Edmonton Oilers, who were consistently the WHA's top draw
with an average of 11,255 fans their final season.
</P>
<P>
   The only two franchises to play out the 1978-79 season and not
be absorbed into the NHL were the Birmingham Bulls and the
Cincinnati Stingers.
</P>
<P>
   The merger brought Gretzky to national audiences and was marked
by the return of Howe and Hull, who played on the oldest line in
league history with Dave Keon for one season in Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   Through shrewd drafts and the presence of Gretzky and Messier,
Edmonton won five Stanley Cups in the 1980s and established itself
as one of the great hockey dynasties.
</P>
<P>
   The other WHA franchises weren't so lucky, however. Facing
increased costs, Quebec moved from the tiny Le Colisee to Colorado,
where it became the Avalanche and won the Stanley Cup in 1995-1996.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a widespread effort by fans and local businessmen,
Winnipeg moved to Phoenix one year later and Hartford became the
Carolina Hurricanes for the 1997-98 season.
</P>
<P>
   The WHA has all but vanished from the face of professional
hockey with just one former player still active - Vancouver's Mark
Messier. Twenty years removed from its last game, however, the
WHA's legacy remains.
</P>
<P>
   WHA rules like overtime periods to decide ties have since been
adopted by the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   The WHA's success in cultivating European talent led the NHL to
finally abandon its Canadian-centric ways, evident in this year's
amateur draft, where the top four players were European.
</P>
<P>
   But the WHA's most lasting contribution to the game was its
effect on player salaries and freedom of movement. By signing Hull
to a then unheard of sum, Winnipeg and the league gave players a
bargaining chip that has since been parlayed into
multimillion-dollar contracts by today's players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stan Mikita said it best,'' said Howe, citing the Chicago
Blackhawks Hall of Famer. ``He said, `Gordie, every morning in
Chicago when I wake up I get down on my hands and knees, cross my
hands together, look up and say, Thank you, Bobby Hull. Thank you,
Bobby Hull.' '' &QL;

ROADRUNNERS GAVE UP A YEAR TOO EARLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By CRAIG MORGAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's June in Phoenix. Valley fans stream into America West Arena
hoping their hockey team can pull out a Game 7 win and finally
advance to the Stanley Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
   The opponent is the dreaded Edmonton Oilers, a team that has
haunted the Roadrunners since the old World Hockey Association
days. But the word on the street is Coach Robbie Ftorek has the
lads ready to play.
</P>
<P>
   Confused? Not if you could see inside Bill McFarland's
imagination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think people realize how close the Roadrunners came to
being an NHL club,'' said Phoenix's former president and general
manager. ``If (owner) Karl Eller had just stuck with it another
year they probably would have been part of the merger into the NHL.
If that had happened, we might not be talking about the Phoenix
Coyotes today.''
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix was originally part of a 1972 agreement between the NHL
and the Western Hockey League. With the NHL exploring expansion,
McFarland secured a contract with NHL President Clarence Campbell
that would have placed NHL franchises in each of the WHL's cities.
</P>
<P>
   But the NHL dragged its feet on a timeline and a few of the
cities joined the WHA instead, nullifying the deal that same year.
</P>
<P>
   After capturing the Patrick Cup as WHL champs in the league's
final two years, the Roadrunners also jumped to the WHA.
</P>
<P>
   The move proved tougher than anticipated. Phoenix lost an
estimated $2 million annually before Eller finally pulled the plug
in 1977. Huge player salaries and average crowds of just 7,296 were
the main culprits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did well in our first two years on the ice, but the ticket
prices stayed the same and the WHL wasn't the WHA,'' McFarland
said. ``The average salary in the WHL was about $15,000 while the
average WHA player was making between $35,000 and $50,000 with a
bunch of $100,000 guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we couldn't increase the ticket prices significantly
and keep our fan base so, we just didn't have a way to make it
happen. Karl did the only thing he could do.''
</P>
<P>
   The franchise still left a glut of memories in its three-year
tenure in the WHA. In their first season, 1974-75, the Roadrunners
became the first WHA franchise to make the playoffs. Sandy Hucul
earned Coach of the Year honors that same year and Robbie Ftorek
won the MVP award in 1976-77 and is still the only Phoenix hockey
player to have his number retired from a major professional league.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for a guy who wanted nothing to do with the WHA when he
was in the Detroit Red Wings farm system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in Cleveland for a game and I had some time to kill, so
I decided to check out a Cleveland Crusaders-Edmonton Oilers
game,'' Ftorek recalled. ``There was nobody there, the game wasn't
very good and here comes Cleveland with these ugly purple and black
and white uniforms and Edmonton has even uglier blue and orange
ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking at this saying `What am I watching? I'm never
playing here.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Money and opportunity changed Ftorek's mind. Despite a torrid
start to the 1973 season, Detroit sent him down to the minors in
Virginia Beach for the remainder of the year. That's when McFarland
came calling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill made it pretty simple for me,'' Ftorek said. ``He said,
`I only have one thing to say to you. You can either play for the
Red Wings and ride a bus or play for the Roadrunners and fly.' ''
</P>
<P>
   McFarland flew Ftorek and his wife out for a summer stay at the
Biltmore and the pair fell in love with the Valley. A few months
later, the feeling was reciprocated.
</P>
<P>
   In 53 games, Ftorek pumped in 31 goals and added 37 assists as
the fledgling Roadrunners went on a late-season tear to qualify for
the AVCO Cup playoffs with a 39-31-8 record.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had rabid fans and the largest booster club of any sport,''
recalled Al McLeod, who played for the team from 1974 to 1977.
``When we made the playoffs that first year it was a pretty amazing
atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   The feeling was fleeting. Quebec defeated the Roadrunners in
five games in the first round. But Ftorek was still on his way to
becoming a full-fledged superstar.
</P>
<P>
   In 1975-76, he had 41 goals and 72 assists to finish fourth in
the league in scoring. Again, Phoenix fell in the first round of
the playoffs, this time to the San Diego Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   With little scoring punch left after a season of defections,
Ftorek shouldered the load in Phoenix's final campaign, notching 46
goals and 71 assists while earning the MVP award by one vote over
Winnipeg's Anders Hedberg.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I remember most about Robbie is what a great
competitor he was,'' said defenseman Jim Niekamp, the Roadrunners'
all-time WHA leader in games played. ``We were good friends because
we had common ground, both of us being American in a sport where
there weren't many Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   After two seasons of playoff hockey, Phoenix fell to 28-48-4 in
1976-77 and the team ceased operations. Ftorek moved on to
Cincinnati and the rest of the players dispersed throughout the
league.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, Edmonton, Hartford, Winnipeg and Quebec joined
the NHL as did Ftorek, who played out his career with the Nordiques
and the New York Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just glad the WHA was born and I had a chance to play in
it,'' said Ftorek, now the coach of the New Jersey Devils. ``I have
a lot of ties and good friendships in Phoenix and the fans were
always great to me. My heart will always be there.'' &QL;

HOWE GOT CHANCE TO PLAY WITH SONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By CRAIG MORGAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   One year after signing NHL great Bobby Hull, the WHA recorded
another victory.
</P>
<P>
   The fledgling league lured legendary Gordie Howe out of
retirement and into a Houston Aeros jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The Hall of Famer had left the Detroit Red Wings after the 1971
season because of a nagging wrist injury, but he never felt
comfortable in retirement.
</P>
<P>
   With sons Marty and Mark languishing in the minor leagues,
unable to play in the NHL due to a minimum age requirement of 20
years, Gordie's wife, Colleen, pressed the WHA on its own age
policy. League brass had none at the time and, after quick
discussions, realized it had another means of attacking the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   With all of Canada's junior leagues now open for sale, the WHA
continually undermined the NHL by signing top young talent like
Wayne Gretzky, Mark Messier and Ken Linseman, before they came of
NHL age.
</P>
<P>
   Aeros Coach Bill Dineen did his part by drafting Marty and Mark
Howe, and at age 45, Gordie soon joined them in Houston with a
jersey that read ``GORIDE HOWE.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not too many Texans knew who Gordie Howe was,'' Howe said with
a chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   That didn't last long.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started the first game of the season together and when I
stepped on the ice with my boys it was like fulfilling a lifelong
dream,'' said Howe, who was named league MVP in his first season
with 100 points. ``I remember the first shift somebody took a run
at me and he went away with six to eight stitches. The next shift
another guy took a run at me and he went away with six to eight
stitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came to the bench and Marty said, `Dad, what the heck are
you doing?' I told him, `I'm just trying to set an example, son.''
</P>
<P>
   Howe did that by playing six seasons in the WHA, scoring 174
goals and adding 334 assists. In 1980, after one more season in the
NHL, he finally retired at the age of 52. &QL;

WOODBRIDGE OUT OF DAVIS CUP

<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ When the Australian Davis Cup team meets the
United States in this weekend's quarterfinal tie, Todd Woodbridge
will not be among them.
</P>
<P>
   Australian captain John Newcombe said Saturday that Woodbridge,
who along with doubles partner Mark Woodforde has won five
Wimbledon doubles titles, was ``not coming'' to the meet but did
not elaborate further.
</P>
<P>
   Australian public relations official Lysette Shaw said that
Woodbridge is injured, but she also did not elaborate further. She
said that a news release will be issued Sunday night (to allow for
Australian time) that will both detail the extent of Woodbridge's
injury and announce which player here will replace him in doubles.
</P>
<P>
   Woodbridge's absence means the Aussie roster consists of Patrick
Rafter, Mark Woodforde, Lleyton Hewitt, Sandon Stolle and Andrew
Illie. The latter is a 23-year-old alternate who went from being
ranked 473 to 59 last year.
</P>
<P>
   Rafter arrived Saturday afternoon and took part in the second of
the team's two practice sessions Saturday. Woodforde was scheduled
to arrive late Saturday &UR;  &LR; night.
</P>
<P>
   The US-Australia meet, the 100th in Davis Cup history, will be
held Friday through Sunday here at Longwood Cricket Club. It will
mark the 45th meeting between the teams, which have played in more
Davis Cups than any other nations.
</P>
<P>
   The United States team is set to arrive Sunday. The US holds a
14-8 record against Australia in matches played in this country.
The last time the Americans lost to Australia in a Davis Cup match
here was 1973, when a team led by Newcombe and Rod Laver triumphed,
5-0, in the finals in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Hence, the importance of Woodbridge, 28, and Woodforde, 33, who
have teamed up to form one of tennis's most visible and successful
doubles teams. Widely known as the Woodies, they have captured a
record five Wimbledon titles (1993-97).
</P>
<P>
   With 51 doubles titles (including nine Grand Slam events) in the
Open Era (since 1968), they are the third- winningest doubles team
of all time, second to Peter Fleming/John McEnroe and Bob
Hewitt/Fred McMillan, who have won 57 doubles titles each.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the tandem won five titles in 10 finals and reached
the finals at Wimbledon for the sixth consecutive year. In 1996,
they captured 12 titles in 13 finals and took the gold medal at the
Atlanta Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   The Woodies began playing as doubles partners in Davis Cup
competition in 1993. They have a 13-2 mark in Davis Cup doubles
play and have not lost a match since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Of the five current Davis Cup players, Woodforde is the only one
who played on the 1993 Davis Cup team which lost to Germany in the
final.
</P>
<P>
   Woodbridge's absence marks the second setback in a week for
Australia, a once-dominant Davis Cup team which hopes to capture
its first title since 1986, when it defeated Sweden, 3-2, in the
final.
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt, the 18-year-old rising star who vaulted from being
ranked 722d in the world in 1997 to 113th in 1998, was named to the
team last week after Mark Philippoussis suffered a knee injury at
Wimbledon while leading in a match against eventual champ Pete
Sampras.
</P>
<P>
   With the recent changes, Australia will likely be much different
that the team that defeated Zimbabwe, 4-1, in the Davis Cup first
round in early April.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the setbacks, Newcombe is confident about the team he
has brought to Longwood. He added that a win by Hewitt at the Davis
Cup would spell a significant victory for the future of Australian
tennis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great opportunity for him,'' said Newcombe, ``and I
think it puts a lot of pressure on the American players, because
they won't want to lose to an 18-year-old rookie in their own
hometown.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they lost to Philippoussis, it would be, 'Well, he's pretty
good,' but this is an untested player.''

BURN FLURRY SCALDS WIZARDS

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Fans who arrived late and left early at last night's
Burn game against the Kansas City Wizards might as well have not
come at all.
</P>
<P>
   The Burn opened its scoring eight minutes into the game and
didn't find the net again until there were 10 minutes left to play.
In the final 10 minutes, four players scored to complete a 5-0 rout
against the Wizards at the Cotton Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The Burn's margin of victory was the largest in team history.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed that,'' Burn defender Eric Dade said. ``I know \Rthe
Wizards\S probably have a different outlook, but we needed that for
our confidence. Goals do a lot for a team, and we got some other
people in on the scoring. You can say all you want about having a
good defense, but if you don't score goals you're not going to win
the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Burn (10-9) took an early lead on an eighth-minute score
from forward Jason Kreis off a combined assist from Leonel Alvarez
and Jorge Rodriguez. As the Burn remained scoreless, the Wizards
stayed within striking distance for the next 72 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City (4-13) had its best chance of the first half on a
hard shot from Chris Brown to the far post. Burn goalkeeper Matt
Jordan, who was selected as an All-Star reserve last week, made a
diving save to preserve the Burn's 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   But the Wizards couldn't maintain that kind of effort throughout
the second half, mainly due to a red-card ejection of defender Uche
Okafor in the 53rd minute. Burn forward Oscar Pareja streaked
through an open midfield and pushed the ball past Okafor, who
brought Pareja down hard.
</P>
<P>
   The one-player deficit seemed to infuse the Wizards with an
immediate burst of energy, getting four solid scoring chances in
the minutes after the ejection, but that was their last dangerous
push of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to get off to a fast start, but we gave away a bad
goal, and our confidence went wobbling again,'' Wizards coach Bob
Gansler said. ``After the ejection, there were too many obstacles
to overcome, not the least was that we played hurried and
scurried.''
</P>
<P>
   The Burn, however, regrouped from there, making the most of its
one-player advantage with crisp passing and accurate crosses. The
late-game scoring onslaught started in the 80th minute, with a
well-orchestrated assist effort from Alvarez and Kreis to Chad
Deering for the goal.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie forward Paul Broome followed with his first MLS goal in
the 84th minute and combined with Kreis to assist Ted Eck five
minutes later. The Burn kept pushing until the very end, with Kreis
firing a free kick into the net with 10 seconds remaining.

OLSON'S ROLE CHANGING BUT VIABLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - With  &UR; Matt Mantei in as the Diamondbacks' new closer,
 &UR; Gregg Olson said he'd take on whatever role Manager  &UR; Buck Showalter
had for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not a whole lot I can do,'' said Olson, who has blown
six saves in 17 opportunities, a year after making good on 30 of 34
save opportunities. ``The team went out and solidified the bullpen.
It's been a sore spot to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Showalter said he still saw Olson as a viable part of the
bullpen. Olson likely will be used in a setup capacity.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the teams left standing at the end of the season are able
to pitch the seventh, eighth and ninth innings,'' Showalter said.
``I think Gregg cannot only help us pitch those innings but can
help us take some of the strain off of a guy like  &UR; (Darren)
Holmes.''
</P>
<P>
   Holmes, who has been on the disabled list for tightness in his
lower back, will pitch a two-inning simulated game today and a
one-inning simulated game Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   He is eligible to come off the DL after the All-Star break, but
Showalter said he'd have to wait and see how Holmes' back
responded.
</P>
<P>
   Showalter said what he did with 20-year-old right-hander
 &UR; Byung-Hyun
 &UR; Kim depended on Holmes' health. Showalter said he'd have to decide
whether to go with 11 or 12 pitchers after the break.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two ways to look at it,'' Showalter said. ``You send
B.K. down there (to Triple-A Tucson) to start and get innings or we
can keep him here with 12 pitchers and not overextend him
physically by having him pitch back-to-back days.''
</P>
<P>
   Olson said he would take his move in the pen in stride and hope
for the best.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still the same pitcher I was last year,'' he said. ``You
go through these periods in your life when bounces don't bounce
your way and the proverbial blank happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he's taking the trade for a closer as a rejection,
Olson said, ``The whole year has been somewhat of a rejection. You
make the most out of what you've got.'' &QL; 
On the mound &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander  &UR; Todd Stottlemyre, rehabilitating a partially torn
rotator cuff and labrum, pitched off the mound for the second time
Saturday. Showalter said the workout had gone well.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the week, Stottlemyre said he had experienced no
stiffness in his shoulder the day after pitching from the mound. &QL; 
On the move &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher  &UR; Bobby Chouinard, who has been called up to the
Diamondbacks from Tucson three times this season, said he was
always ready to move.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a MASH unit,'' he said. &QL; 
Welcome, Erik &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander  &UR; Erik Sabel had his contract purchased from
Triple-A Tucson on Friday, and outfielder  &UR; Dante Powell was sent
back south.
</P>
<P>
   Sabel, who has pitched in the past two games, is the first
Diamondbacks draftee to appear in a major league game. He was the
42nd round pick in 1996.  &UR; Nick Bierbrodt was called up a few weeks
ago, but he did not appear in a game. &QL;

SURVIVING COLUMBINE GIVES PLAYER PERSPECTIVE

 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWPORT, R.I. _ Jake Cram was glad to be hanging out at the aged
tennis pen called the Casino Saturday afternoon. Young Jake Cram
was very glad to be anywhere Saturday. Location didn't matter.
</P>
<P>
   He could hear the chatter of gulls overhead, feel the sea breeze
riffling his sandy hair, touch the finely groomed grass court on
which he sat quietly, in a corner of the intimate timber stadium.
He was alive.
</P>
<P>
   That had seemed an unlikely prospect for Jake Cram of Littleton,
Colo., not quite three months ago _ a day when even reaching his
19th birthday sounded risky, a day he was indelibly scarred by a
massacre. But spared.
</P>
<P>
   The sounds that day inside Columbine High School were awful,
terrifying, murderous, threatening _ guns and bombs outside the
door where Jake and schoolmates, 60 of them, were sardined into a
tiny room ``praying, crying, but trying hard not to make a sound
that might be heard by Dylan and Eric.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday was supposed to be John McEnroe's day at the Casino,
where he was tapped for the International Tennis Hall of Fame. But
it was 18-year-old Jake Cram's day, too. McEnroe, the tennis
player, has heard thunderous applause throughout the world, and
received more during the induction ceremony. Cram, also a tennis
player, heard little applause from the few people watching
Columbine High matches. But he has heard the thunderous explosions
touched off by killers, a din that ``I may never get out of my
head. But things are better now.''
</P>
<P>
   Jake Cram, a trim 6-footer on his way to Notre Dame on a partial
tennis scholarship, was honored also, at noon on a side court,
receiving one of the annual Bill Talbert Junior Sportsmanship
citations. A pretty fair kid player, he finished third among
Colorado schoolboys last year and this, and is good enough to be
accepted in the US Junior Championships next month at Kalamazoo,
Mich.
</P>
<P>
   ``The `Zoo, I'm really looking forward to it.'' He is talking
before he and fellow Talbert winners (Rebecca Reynolds of El Paso,
David Martin of Tulsa, and Rick Phillipp of Fort Wayne, Ind.)
settled into an out-of-the-way niche behind the court to watch
McEnroe and an Australia luminary, Ken McGregor, accepted into the
Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a while after the shooting I didn't look forward to
anything. I was completely out of it for three weeks, just going
through the motions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lost weight. I couldn't sleep, but when I could the
nightmares were terrible. I still have them, but not as many. A
hypnotist has helped me with my sleeping. Now I'm doing OK. This is
great, seeing McEnroe. I watched him on TV when I was a kid.'' Just
like everybody watched the kids at Columbine.
</P>
<P>
   ``April 21st?'' Jake reflects and his sea-blue eyes pinch with
pain. ``I drove to school, takes me about five minutes. Not a
special or different day. I was in the choir room when it happened.
No, I can't remember what we'd been singing, but we were getting
ready for a concert . . . that never happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``A kid came in the door shouting, `They're shooting!' We
thought it was a joke. But I saw the barrel of a shotgun. Somebody
slammed the door, and a teacher, Theresa Miller, told us to get
down, get into the office inside the room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really a small office, maybe 10-by-15 feet. We were really
packed in,'' Jake scrunches his shoulders close together. ``Sixty
of us, mostly girls, for 3 1/2 hours.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was scary,'' Jake says. ``Dark, hard to breathe. We were
able to knock some holes in the ceiling to help a couple of kids
with asthma, help them breathe. We held them up to the holes, but
three girls fainted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three-and-a-half hours and we didn't know if we'd live or die.
The shooting went on. We were scared they'd bust in on us.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't know who was doing the shooting, but afterwards when
I found out it was Eric (Harris) and Dylan (Klebold), I couldn't
believe it. I couldn't have imagined it. When we were little kids I
spent a lot of time with Dylan. I still can't believe it.
</P>
<P>
   ``My best friend, Matt Cornwall, was in there with me. We tried
to comfort each other. It's funny. He's going to go to UC
(University of Colorado) Denver. He's gonna feel more comfortable
staying close to home with his family. I'm close to my family, but
I just want to get out of Littleton for a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the kids had a cell phone and we were talking to the
police. They told us the SWAT team would be coming in to get us.
But they didn't. We kept saying over and over, `Why don't they
come?' Three-and-a-half hours. I was angry that they waited so long
to try. I'm still angry. They could have saved Mr. (Dave) Sanders,
who died. We knew he was dying, and prayed they'd come.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally the SWAT team came, and we ran out behind them . . .
through the bodies . . . the kids I knew. The bodies in the hall .
. . I'll never get those out of my mind. That was the worst.''
</P>
<P>
   Jake is glad to report that Pat Ireland is doing well. ``You
know, the kid who was shot in the head and fell out of the window.
He was paralyzed, but that passed. He's doing a lot better. My
friend, Seth Houy, was in the library. One of them pointed a gun in
his face, saying, `You want to die?' The gun jammed and Seth ran
out of there. Got away.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was lucky. All of us who got out are lucky. But I lost
friends. The funerals were tough. Then, TV coming to our
graduation. Weird. Yeah, I think I'm OK.'' He looks it, turned out
in sport jacket and tie. ``I had to buy clothes for this weekend. I
never,'' he is amused, ``never wore a tie before.'' He was not
sure, April 21, that he ever would.
</P>
<P>
   John and Kathy Cram, who accompanied their son to Newport, were
in the dark for a long time that day, too. Kathy says, ``Tennis
friends of Jake's from all over the country were watching TV and
phoning us, wanting to know if he was OK. Was he in the school?
Were we all right? They were very comforting in a hard time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Afterwards his tennis friends were very supportive. They got
him out playing again. He keeps hearing from kids he met at
tournaments.''
</P>
<P>
   Jake has been consulting a psychologist, Dr Renee Norcross, whom
he'd known before, and says, ``She's helped me. Before the shooting
she had helped athletes deal with pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   He grins. ``Pressure? This thing has given me a total change of
perspective. I was a good competitor, maybe not like McEnroe. But I
didn't like to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Jake Cram, obviously a good kid, will be playing next for
Notre Dame, glad to be here, there, anywhere, saying, ``I'll try
hard. But . . . if I lose . . . well . . . so?''
</P>
<P>
   He is smiling. ``A tennis match isn't life or death.''

RODEO BULL SETS BOUNTY RECORD IN TEXAS
</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MESQUITE, Texas _ With explosive jumps and wrecking-ball drops,
Mesquite Championship Rodeo bull Dodge Durango dumped his 41st
consecutive rider last night, denying Troy Jones of Killeen a
record $29,000 bounty.
</P>
<P>
   Jones stayed aboard the 1,900-pound high jumper for 2.4 seconds
at Mesquite Arena. The average stay on the bull has been 2.3
seconds since Dodge Durango debuted at the world's most renowned
weekly rodeo in April 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``\RDodge Durango is\S about to make a believer out of me,''
said Neal Gay, who has watched an abundance of high-profile bulls
perform at Mesquite since opening the Friday and Saturday night
rodeo in 1958. ``I've never bragged on him a lot because it takes
awhile to determine whether a bull is great. But we've proven that
by taking him all over.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Mesquite Rodeo, Durango's appearances during
the past 15 months range from the Southwestern Exposition and
Livestock Show Rodeo in Fort Worth to the Professional Bull Riders
World Championships in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   ``He bucks strong overtime,'' Gay said. ``Everybody who gets on
him says that he is strong.''
</P>
<P>
   The bounty for staying on Durango rises $500 each time that the
bull bucks off a victim. When Durango makes his scheduled
appearance at Mesquite next weekend, the bounty is expected to be
$29,500.
</P>
<P>
   That is a record for the bounty bull program, sponsored by a
national automobile company at Professional Rodeo Cowboys
Association shows. The previous record for highest bounty was
$28,500. Cory Check of Eastman, Wis., earned the sum for staying on
Dodge Laramie II at Mesquite.
</P>
<P>
   The bounty program began in 1992 and the Mesquite Championship
Rodeo bull Dodge Dakota was its first big star; the bull went
undefeated for most of the season until Joe Wimberly of Cool made a
qualified ride and pocketed $17,000.

RED SOX, WASDIN THROW ONE AWAY 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-BRAVES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The bunt never has been a weapon of choice for the Red
Sox.
</P>
<P>
   But as a means of self-destruction, seldom has it been more
effective than it was Saturday afternoon, when failure to execute
bunt plays in the 11th inning _ both on the offensive and defensive
sides _ cost the Red Sox dearly in a 2-1 loss to the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox had a chance to take the lead in the 11th when
Darren Lewis drew a leadoff walk. Red Sox manager Jimy Williams
flashed the bunt sign to third-base coach Wendell Kim, assuming
that Kim in turn would deliver the message to Damon Buford. But Kim
said he never saw the sign from Williams, and Buford swung away,
grounding into a double play.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in the bottom of the inning, after a leadoff walk to
Andruw Jones, Sox reliever John Wasdin fielded Brian Hunter's
two-strike bunt in front of the plate, wheeled and drilled Hunter
in the helmet with his throw, the ball caroming past first baseman
Mike Stanley down the right-field line as Jones circled home with
the winning run.
</P>
<P>
   An afternoon of exquisite pitching and minimum offense _ an
exchange of solo home runs by Mike Stanley (No. 13) and Andruw
Jones (No. 16) through the first 10 innings _ ended with Wasdin
lamenting the wasted effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shame the game had to be lost in a fashion like that,''
said Wasdin, who now has been pinned with three straight losses
after winning seven decisions in a row, even though he'd dispatched
the middle of the Braves' order in the 10th on a strikeout and
double play. ``To be on the losing end three times in the last two
weeks is kind of frustrating.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an easy play. I can't explain it. It's a play you work on
day in and day out. I charged it hard, came up with it, but
couldn't make a good throw to the first baseman.''
</P>
<P>
   But as hard as it was for Wasdin to accept his breakdown, at
least a play was made, however hideous. Imagine how Williams felt
that Buford never received his instructions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I got screened when I gave the sign,'' Williams said.
``If anybody messed up that play, it was me. I must have been
screened off from Wendell. It's my fault that I wasn't in position
to be seen. In my mind, we were going to bunt.''
</P>
<P>
   In Kim's mind, Williams was blaming the wrong guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I messed it up, that's all I can say,'' Kim said. ``He gave
it. I didn't see it. I should have known. I'll take the blame, I
want to take the blame.''
</P>
<P>
   How do such things happen? Kim offered one hint when he said
that Williams ``kind of ducked down'' as he gave the sign, because
he didn't want Bobby Cox, the Braves manager whom Williams long
served as third base coach, to steal the sign. ``Coxie knows him
well,'' Kim said. ``And Jimy didn't know what cameras might be on
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Buford, standing at home plate, said it occurred to him that a
bunt might be in the offing. ``Think about it,'' he said. ``You got
(Rudy) Seanez on the hill, Stanley and (Troy) O'Leary coming up,
that gives you two legitimate chances to drive him home if he's on
second.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just one of those things you look back on in the course
of a game.''
</P>
<P>
   But Buford wasn't about to act independently. ``I just looked
for the sign, that's it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked down there, didn't see a sign, so I swung and tried
to hit it over the wall. It didn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox' offense, which has produced just one run in its last 15
innings, was hardly firing on all cylinders against Billerica's Tom
Glavine, the lefthander who gave up Stanley's first-pitch home run
to open the second inning, but allowed just one more base runner to
advance as far as second base in his nine innings of work.
</P>
<P>
   It got no easier against the Braves' bullpen. Lefty John Rocker
struck out the side in the 10th, and Seanez dispatched Stanley on
another ground ball after Buford's double play in the 11th.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the Sox' offense, Stanley, who has homered four
times on this trip, grimaced and replied: ``Lack thereof would be a
better word for it. We haven't been able to muster a whole lot
against these guys.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves could do little against Sox starter Mark Portugal
(six innings, one run, six hits) and four Sox relievers, including
new papa Rich Garces, who got the last out of the eighth and left
two runners on base in the ninth, shortly after his wife, Lisabeth,
delivered their third child.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tommy didn't give us a lot to hit,'' Portugal said. ``You know
coming in you're not going to get much against these guys. He just
did it a little longer than I did. He came out on the top end
today. You can't worry about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox, with Nomar Garciaparra missing his eighth straight game
with a strained left groin, can still come home with a .500 record
on this 10-game trip. They're 4-5, with an appointment against Greg
Maddux, the four-time Cy Young Award winner, still to come.
</P>
<P>
   It's not the ideal sendoff to a vacation, however short.

GAME GOAL-LESS BUT RIVETING
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   PASADENA _ President Clinton rose to leave the Rose Bowl in the
76th minute of a scoreless Women's World Cup final between the U.S.
and China on Saturday. You know how it is: When in Southern
California, do as the Southern Californians do. At that moment, it
didn't look good for the future of top-flight women's soccer in
this country. After all, if a standoff between world super powers
couldn't hold the attention of the First Fan for a 90 minutes, what
hope was there for hooking the masses?
</P>
<P>
   Just when the Secret Service had secured the exit, however,
President Clinton sat back down in his suite. The hope here is that
his action reflected the mood of his constituents. Because anybody
who saw the match through to its conclusion was rewarded with
glorious theater.
</P>
<P>
   It took two hours and 10 penalty kicks and when U.S. defender
Brandi Chastain delivered her final soliloquy, with her left foot,
the principal actors were all too pooped to take many curtain
calls.
</P>
<P>
   Two scoreless halves, followed by two scoreless 15-minute
overtime periods, isn't the way the U.S. players would have
scripted this final act. To be sure, the last thing they were
looking to do was re-create the drama of Harvey Haddix's 12-inning
perfect game of 40 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   They knew it was goals the record crowd of 90,185 had come to
see. No one had to tell them the average sports fan craves offense
only slightly less than his next beer or plate of nachos.
</P>
<P>
   And yet it's hard to imagine anybody panning Team USA's victory
via penalty kicks. It was riveting in the way no-hitters are, with
defensive plays saving the day.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Kristine Lilly covered her teammates' tushes as well as
any pitcher could cover home plate with a game riding on his tag.
In the 10th minute of the first overtime, Chinese defender Fan
Yunjie headed a ball at the U.S. goal and caught keeper Briana
Scurry in a vulnerable position.
</P>
<P>
   It looked like nothing was going to get between the ball and
China's trophy dance until Lilly materialized at the goal line and
headed the shot out of harm's way.
</P>
<P>
   To that point, the overtime period had been played mostly in
Team USA's end, but Lilly's save seemed to pump new oxygen into the
U.S. players' deflated lungs. They controlled the tempo the rest of
the way, then made each of their penalty kicks under the most
suffocating of circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   As confident as the Americans were in the penalty kicks, China's
goose egg was all but burned into the grass when their third
shooter, Liu Ying, sent the ball in the very direction Scurry was
leaning. Scurry batted down the ball. The next U.S. shooter, Lilly,
applied the screws by coolly converting her kick to put the
Americans ahead, 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. prevailed 5-4, and if that struck you as anticlimactic,
well, the victorious players could feel your bathos.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knows what would have happened if we had kept playing?''
U.S. co-captain Carla Overbeck said. ``Winning and losing in
penalty kicks is not a fun thing. I don't think that's a good way
to end it. But we'll take it.''
</P>
<P>
   But of course.
</P>
<P>
   If soccer had the same set-up as the golf championship of this
country, the players would have returned today for at least 90 more
minutes of combat. If FIFA had taken its cue from the NHL, the
players would have played on and on and on until one of the goalies
cracked.
</P>
<P>
   Neither of those alternatives sounded particularly appealing to
reserve midfielder Tisha Venturini, who said, ``I don't think
anybody was up to playing any more. You don't understand how
exhausted the players were.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't just the 88-degree heat that sapped the players'
energy. For the past three weeks they have been tugged every which
way by an adoring public. The U.S. team has been so accommodating -
to reporters, autograph seekers and late-night talk show hosts
alike - it was only fitting that they would give the largest crowd
ever to view a women's sporting event more soccer than was
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder America has gone gaga over the confident, colloquial
crusaders for women's soccer. Happily, it has been anything but a
one-sided love affair.
</P>
<P>
   Even Mia Hamm, the reluctant object of so many people's
affection, let her guard down long enough to show her gratefulness.
She thanked a Korean journalist for sticking around after the North
Koreans were eliminated to report on the remaining matches.
</P>
<P>
   ``We appreciate that you continued to cover the tournament,''
Hamm said. ``It says a lot about how attitudes are changing.''
</P>
<P>
   The proof of President Clinton's change in heart is in the
negatives snapped in the U.S. locker room after the players'
champagne bath.
</P>
<P>
   ``I turned around and there he was,'' Venturini said, wide-eyed.
``He came in and gave a nice speech. He was hugging people. We took
some pictures.''
</P>
<P>
   Those are the photographs the players will hold dear. The
picture the rest of us will carry from the day is of 90,000
spectators staying around long enough to salute 20 very deserving
women. &QL;

OUTFIELDER'S TANTRUM OVER VOTING ILL-ADVISED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's often been the belief of Latin American ballplayers that
they must play and live to a different standard than their
U.S.-born counterparts. For much of the 1960s and '70s there was
probably some truth to those sentiments.
</P>
<P>
   But times have changed, and the Latin-born player has become an
accepted part of the landscape in the majors. Yet some continue to
draw back to the once-valid argument for answers when they feel
slighted by the American public.
</P>
<P>
   Case in point, Texas outfielder  &UR; Juan Gonzalez, who will not be
a part of the American League All-Star team after he declined
Manager
 &UR; Joe Torre's invitation to be a reserve. Gonzalez cannot understand
why he finished fifth among AL outfielders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shame,'' Torre said of Gonzalez. ``I think it is an
honor, and if not honored they should be obligated.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, who is truly not a bad guy but did receive bad advice,
cited Cleveland's stuffing of the ballot box as one reason, yet
refused to look at  &UR; Ivan Rodriguez, a Rangers teammate who easily
outdistanced everyone at his position. All Gonzalez, a two-time
MVP, has to do is look in the mirror for his answers.
</P>
<P>
   This is a player who often scowls at the official scorer if a
call doesn't go his way. He also jogs on grounders and pouted
earlier this season when a ball hit the top of the fence, bounced
back into the playing field and was not ruled a home run, but was
instead called a double.
</P>
<P>
   If the balloting were truly slanted in Cleveland's favor, then
how did Seattle's Ken Griffey Jr. lead all players? Maybe if
Gonzalez had a little bit of charisma he wouldn't be viewed as a
sullen and petulant star.
</P>
<P>
   The voters, all fans, look into a player's heart, as well as his
talent, when making their choices for the All-Star Game. Gonzalez,
who has an entourage that often pulls him in different directions
and fills his head with misinformation, could have the baseball
world in the palm of his hand if he only tried.
</P>
<P>
   One look at Dominican-born  &UR; Sammy Sosa, the top vote-getter in
the National League, should be all Gonzalez needs to see for proof
of how much can come your way if you just let it flow. &QL; 
Trivial question &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Who are the two members of the Diamondbacks pitching staff to
have participated in a no-hit victory at the major league level? &QL; 
Serious finger-pointing &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If there's one thing that gets the ire of major league players,
it's when their manager outs them to the world. It's one thing for
a manager to be critical, but quite another for him to jam a sword
into his own players.
</P>
<P>
   Yet that's exactly what Baltimore Manager  &UR; Ray Miller has done
to his relievers. Granted, the Orioles bullpen has been among the
worst in the majors, but to single them out as the biggest reason
for this dysfunctional club's miseries is quite another matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be embarrassed to stand in front of the ball club if I
were a relief pitcher right now,'' Miller said this month. ``I'd be
embarrassed to walk through this clubhouse. . . . It's a crying
shame that you have a ball club busting their butts and doing
everything in the world, and you can't get one guy to shut the
door. I'm getting tired of watching guys pitch like they're scared
to death. We need someone to step up out there or we'll get a whole
new bunch of them.''
</P>
<P>
   It's no secret that Orioles relievers are fuming mad with
Miller. Veteran reliever  &UR; Arthur Rhodes was the most vocal of the
relievers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bullpen gets blamed for everything,'' Rhodes said. ``So
from now on, everything that happens, just blame it on the
bullpen.'' &QL; 
Jose can finally see &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay designated hitter  &UR; Jose Canseco, more on the ball than
he may ever lead on, had an accurate way to describe his career
after learning he had been selected to the All-Star Game after a
seven-year gap.
</P>
<P>
   ``When was the last time I made the All-Star team, 1942?''
Canseco said. ``I can't remember back that far.''
</P>
<P>
   His last appearance came in 1992. The seven years between
appearances is second only to the eight years  &UR; Paul Molitor and
 &UR; Steve
 &UR; Sax had between their All-Star appearances since the voting
returned to the fans in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've come full circle,'' Canseco said. ``As a baseball player,
no one has experienced as much as I've experienced. I was talked
about as being the best player in the world, hands down, by far, at
one point, being this freak that nobody understood. I stood 6-4,
250 pounds and was running 4.3, 4.4 40s. The first guy to do 40-40.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I was, more or less, an outcast in baseball, being
completely forgotten. The worst player. A total joke. Washed up.'' &QL; 
Oh, I wish I were an . . . &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's not unusual for starting players who land on the disabled
list to go batty trying to find ways to spend their time while
injured. Pittsburgh shortstop  &UR; Pat Meares, on the DL since May 12
after surgery to his left hand, is no exception, though he has
discovered some rather creative things to do.
</P>
<P>
   Meares served as the television analyst for a Pirates three-game
series in Detroit June 79. During Pittsburgh's last road trip, he
took his shirt off and took in some rays while tanning himself on
the upper deck at Veterans Stadium, while his teammates played
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, though, Meares topped it all by dressing as a
bratwurst and racing around the bases against an Italian Sausage
and a hot dog during the sausage race at Milwaukee's County
Stadium. He won, by the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just trying to stay sane and off the FBI's most wanted
list,'' Meares said. ``Who knows what I might do next, though. I'll
keep it a secret.''
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh Manager  &UR; Gene Lamont has found no problems with
Meares' escapades.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just trying to have some fun, and that's fine,'' Lamont
said. ``He had everyone going in Milwaukee with the sausage thing.
I hadn't seen that many guys in our dugout all season.'' &QL; 
Former D-Backs update &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Tony Batista, who was given first and second cracks at the
starting shortstop job in Arizona, seems to have finally caught
fire. Entering the weekend series, Batista had seven home runs and
21 RBIs in just 22 games with Toronto. Entering the weekend,
Batista was batting .286 for the Blue Jays.
</P>
<P>
   Reliever  &UR; John Frascatore, who along with Batista was sent to
Toronto in exchange for left-handed reliever  &UR; Dan Plesac (who has
done a wonderful job for the Diamondbacks), had a series to
remember against Baltimore. Frascatore was the winning pitcher in a
three-game series against the Orioles, tying a major league record
for consecutive victories by a reliever.
</P>
<P>
   Also, reliever  &UR; Amaury Telemaco, who was claimed off waivers by
Philadelphia earlier, has had a 1.54 ERA in 11 innings since
joining the Phillies. &QL; 
Trivial answer &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The obvious one is  &UR; Randy Johnson, who had a no-hitter against
the Detroit Tigers on June 2, 1990. It has been Johnson's only
no-hitter of his career.
</P>
<P>
   The other is a bit trickier. Reliever  &UR; Gregg Olson was one of
four Baltimore Orioles to combine on a 2-0 no-hitter in Oakland on
July 13, 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Olson pitched the final inning for the victory. Orioles pitcher
 &UR; Bob
 &UR; Milacki started the game and was removed after six innings because
he was making a spot start.  &UR; Mike Flanagan,  &UR; Mark Williamson and
Olson each pitched one inning to close out the game against  &UR; Eric
Show of the A's. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE HIT LIST &QL; 
 &UR; Oh yeah, this is one way to get him back: Mets Manager  &UR; Bobby
 &UR; Valentine, spun the knife another quarter-turn into  &UR; Bobby Bonilla
last week when he said Bonilla's been great, other than being
caught smoking a cigarette in a no-smoking section. It was an
embarrassing revelation, especially since it's doubtful Bonilla's
wife knows he smokes from time to time.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; He's declared his independence in a big way: Texas rookie  &UR; Jeff
Zimmerman, who may be the best setup pitcher in the game, was named
to the American League All-Star team, two years after he was
pitching in the independent Northern League.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Flashback: Phil Roof.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; And, oh, how the East Coast folks love to ride us
 &UR; about our 115-degree days: The temperature on the artificial turf
at Philadelphia's Veterans Stadium registered 161 degrees during
last Sunday's game between the Cubs and Phillies. ``It was
unexplainable, really. Just scorching, relentless heat,'' Phillies
center fielder
 &UR; Doug Glanville said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; New era?: For the first time since 1991, the Atlanta Braves
will not have a starting pitcher at the All-Star Game. &QL; 
EXTRA BASES &QL; 
With Cleveland's  &UR; Travis Fryman out for at least two months,
 &UR; Jim &UR; Thome has brushed the dust off his third baseman's glove and
is returning to his original position. After 2{ years at first
base, Thome volunteered for the move.
</P>
<P>
   Major league officials are quietly negotiating with St. Louis
and the New York Mets to open their 2000 season with two regular
season games in Tokyo. But main attraction  &UR; Mark McGwire doesn't
seem enthralled with the idea: ``I'm absolutely against it. . . .
The game belongs here.''
</P>
<P>
   The Detroit Tigers, one of the most storied clubs in all of
major league baseball, appear headed toward having the worst record
in the 1990s. Detroit was 668-811 through Friday. Minnesota is next
at 688-787.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out the Dodgers were fined $200,000 and banned from
signing any foreign players for six months after it was discovered
they illegally signed Cuban defectors  &UR; Juan Carlos Diaz and
 &UR; Josue Perez, each declared a free agent this month.
</P>
<P>
   Knuckleballer  &UR; Tom Candiotti, back with Cleveland, has replaced
struggling right-hander  &UR; Dwight Gooden in the Indians' rotation.
Gooden is now the mop-up man in Cleveland's bullpen. Of Gooden's
392 career appearances, 389 have been as a starter.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles' bullpen blew its major league-leading 20th save
Wednesday night. The all-time record for one season was set last
season when St. Louis blew 31 saves. With a half season left to be
played, Baltimore appears to be priming itself for a run at the
record. &QL; 
THE RUMOR MILL &QL; 
Cincinnati has had serious conversations with the Yankees, who
don't seem put off by the idea of sending  &UR; Andy Pettitte to the
Reds. The problem is Cincinnati's unwillingness to part with left
fielder &UR; Greg Vaughn, whose departure would surely enrage shortstop
and captain
 &UR; Barry Larkin.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay closer  &UR; Roberto Hernandez, who has 24 saves, is
definitely available. But the Devil Rays had no interest in helping
expansion brother Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Reliever  &UR; Mel Rojas, who has had a terrible time since leaving
the Expos for the big bucks of free agency three years ago, has
apparently decided to hang it up for the season. Rojas, who was
sent to Montreal's Triple-A club July 2, has not reported and is
back at his Florida home.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore catcher  &UR; Lenny Webster and Philadelphia catcher  &UR; Bobby
Estalella are both on the market. Pittsburgh, which suffered the
gruesome loss of  &UR; Jason Kendall last week, is interested in
acquiring one of them.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh right fielder  &UR; Jose Guillen, whom the Diamondbacks
desperately tried to pry away from the Pirates during spring
training, is now on the open market and can be had for the right
price. Guillen was recently sent to Triple-A for the second time
this season.
</P>
<P>
   Orioles ownership, which, unfortunately, truly runs the show in
Baltimore, is mulling over the possibility of making several moves
over the next three weeks. On the agenda are trading
 &UR; Juan Guzman,  &UR; Scott Erickson, Webster and swapping Manager  &UR; Ray
Miller with  &UR; Eddie Murray.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado left fielder  &UR; Dante Bichette, who can veto any trade
now that he has played 10 years in the majors and the last five
with the Rockies, looks as if he is open to the idea of a deal. &QL; 
THE RANKINGS &QL; 
 &UR; TOP OF THE ORDER &QL; 
 &QL; 
1. ClevelandWith the title practically sewn up, what will the
second half bring?  &QL; 
2. NY YankeesThe confidence and swagger are back; it's time to wait
until October.  &QL; 
3. AtlantaThe Braves offense is severely missing injured
catcher &UR; Javier Lopez.  &QL; 
4. San FranciscoLooks as if they'll have to make a go at it without
 &UR; Barry Bonds again.  &QL; 
5. CincinnatiWhen  &UR; Ron Villone's going this good, anything can
happen.  &QL; 
6. HoustonIs there a better closer in the game right now than &UR; Billy
Wagner?  &QL; 
7. NY MetsWhy question anything that goes on with this club
anymore?  &QL; 
8. BostonSerious contenders do not lose games to Tampa Bay, not
with  &UR; Pedro Martinez.  &QL; 
9. PhiladelphiaIt's true. That is no mirage in the NL East
standings. &UR; BOTTOM OF THE ORDER &QL; 
 &QL; 
30. FloridaIf only they could face  &UR; Tom Glavine (5-10 vs. Florida)
all the time.  &QL; 
29. MinnesotaIntroducing the Twins All-Star . . .  &UR; Ron Coomer.
Honest.  &QL; 
28. BaltimorePicking up  &UR; Cal Ripken's 2000 option is the least of
this club's worries.  &QL; 
27. Montreal &UR; Brad Fullmer, sent down, reported but has refused to
play.  &QL; 
26. DetroitLots of talk about quitting going on. That's not going
to be good.  &QL; 
25. Tampa BayThe spunk is finally back now that the first-half
catastrophes are over.  &QL; 
24. Los AngelesClub was 13-26 through Friday since firing coaches
in May.  &QL; 
23. AnaheimHuge disappointment. Then again, they're not out of it
yet.  &QL; 
22. Kansas CityTeetering on the brink of mediocrity once again. ON
THE RISE &QL; 
 &UR; Toronto Blue Jays: A 5-1 homestand and a dramatic ninth-inning
victory over Baltimore Wednesday night have the Blue Jays believing
they can be destiny's darling in 1999. With Boston still not a
certainty to contend in the second half, why not Toronto? They have
solid starting pitching and an offense capable of scoring runs in
bunches. The Blue Jays aren't all the way there, but they're not a
bad club. &QL; 
GOING SOUTH &QL; 
 &UR; Chicago Cubs: When the Cubs last met the cross-town White Sox, they
were riding high, nine games over .500 and just one game behind
first place in the NL Central. A 6-20 span later, and the Cubs are
lucky not to be in last place. The pitching staff's ERA is near the
bottom in the league and prospects for improving don't seem on the
horizon. Over a span of 23 games, opponents had scored 205 runs.
That's an average of nearly nine runs per game. The Cubs haven't
won two in a row since June 8. &QL; 
OVERHEARD &QL; 
Chicago Cubs first baseman  &UR; Mark Grace after recently playing at
Coors Field: ``They grew the grass longer and made it little bit
more fair, because this grass used to be faster than AstroTurf. But
playing here is like hitting with no gravity. Even I've got power
here.'' &QL; 
OUT OF LEFT FIELD &QL; 
On a club loaded with rookies, it's no surprise the Minnesota Twins
have several players worth mentioning. Promising starter  &UR; Joe &UR; Mays,
who was moved from the bullpen to the rotation in June, has a
sparkling 0.82 ERA and has allowed 19 hits in 22 innings. More
amazing, two of his starts have come against the Cleveland Indians,
the best hitting club in the majors. &QL;

3RD-PLACE GAME ENDS IN SHOOTOUT

   PASADENA, Calif. _ Some members of the Norway and Brazil
contingents grumbled about having to stay in California for a week
to play in the third-place game of the Women's World Cup, and FIFA
indicated it may consider eliminating the match.
</P>
<P>
   But both teams came to play Saturday and put on a spirited
display of soccer at the Rose Bowl. They just had stay around a
little bit longer than expected.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Despite numerous opportunities by each side, the match was
scoreless after regulation, resulting in a shootout. After Norway
star Ann Kristin Aarones missed high on her team's sixth shot,
Brazil's Formiga quickly stepped up and hit a low shot to the left
inside of the net for a 5-4 decision.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams put pressure on the defenses in the late stages of
regulation, combining for 25 shots. &QL; 
Goooooooals? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many people point to the ability of women's teams to score more
often than men's teams as a reason for the popularity of this World
Cup.
</P>
<P>
   With 123 goals through 30 matches heading into the final day of
the tournament, fans saw an average of 4.10 goals per match.
</P>
<P>
   With four of the highest-scoring teams in Saturday's
championship and third-place matches, it was thought that goal
total would rise.
</P>
<P>
   So what happens? Both matches were scoreless, forcing shootouts.
</P>
<P>
   That left China's Sun Wen and Brazil's Sissi as the tournament
leaders in goals with seven apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Ten players scored for the United States, led by Tiffeny
Milbrett with three goals. Norway had eight players score, with
Aarones netting four.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the four teams that played Saturday scored seven goals
in a match during the group play phase. The U.S. defeated Nigeria,
7-1; Brazil beat Mexico, 7-1; Norway downed Canada, 7-1; and China
overwhelmed Ghana, 7-0. &QL; 
All-tournament team &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Five members of the champion U.S. side were selected to the
World Cup All-Star team.
</P>
<P>
   Goalkeeper Briana Scurry, defenders Brandi Chastian and Carla
Overbeck, midfielder Michelle Akers and striker Mia Hamm were
American selections to the 16-player squad.
</P>
<P>
   China led all nations with seven players. Goalkeeper Gao Hong,
defenders Wang Liping and Wen Lirong, midfielders Liu Ailing and
Zhao Lihong, and strikers Jin Yan and Sun were selected.
</P>
<P>
   Germany's Doris Fitschen, a defender, and Bettina Wiegmann, a
midfielder, also made the team along with midfielder Sissi and
striker Aarones. &QL; 
A thorn? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Security was tight at the Rose Bowl on Saturday because of
President Clinton's appearance at the matches.
</P>
<P>
   All members of the press had their computer bag and briefcases
subjected to a police dog's trained nose.
</P>
<P>
   The president visited the locker rooms of the teams after the
championship match, first China's then the American's. That made
for a long wait before players appeared for interviews, and
prompted this comment from a FIFA official:
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm with FIFA and we're visitors in this country, so we have
to respect the security procedures of the White House. It's a thorn
in the side, I know. There is another term for it, but we'll just
go with that today.'' &QL;

AMERICANS HAVE WORLD AT THEIR FEET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHIRA SPRINGER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ When Brandi Chastain fell to her knees at the
penalty mark, pumped both fists in the air, and ripped off her
shirt, the sense of relief showed and the victory celebration
began. A game-winning penalty kick by Chastain planted in the upper
right side of the goal secured the Americans' place in history and
their second World Cup triumph. The Americans' 5-4 penalty- kick
decision Saturday at the Rose Bowl capped a three-week long quest
for the title.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning of the 1999 Women's World Cup, the Americans
had been asked to shoulder a heavy burden. They were designated as
soccer ambassadors and center-stage stars in a soccer celebration
that turned out bigger than all expectations. Saturday, the
building pressure that has marked the Americans' wild ride through
the tournament came to a fitting, dramatic conclusion after 120
minutes of scoreless play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm delighted that we won this tournament,'' said US coach
Tony DiCicco, whose team had not played an overtime match since its
1996 Olympic semifinal win over Norway. ``It came down to them just
not allowing themselves to lose. To make all five penalty kicks in
a pressure-cooker environment like this and for (goalkeeper Briana
Scurry) to come up with a save is a storybook ending for a team
that has its place in history.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Chastain about surviving the overtime periods, ``Each one
of us has, I think, hearts that are a little too big for our
chests. We came together and said, `We're not going to let the game
go.' ''
</P>
<P>
   When regulation time ended, the crowd of 90,185 _ the largest
ever to watch a women's sporting event _ had plenty to cheer but no
goals to celebrate. In another women's World Cup first, the
championship game went to two 15-minute sudden-death overtime
periods. In the 100th minute, midfielder Kristine Lilly saved the
Americans' title chances, heading away a ball from her position on
the goal line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just doing my job,'' she said. ``Every time there is a
corner kick, I'm on the post and I just shift with the ball. It
came right to my head.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Lilly's ho-hum recollection of the save, the Chinese
came within inches of earning their first Cup, and the close call
symbolized the way China dominated the first overtime.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Americans were without Michelle Akers, who was
knocked to the ground in the final minute of regulation as she
guarded the near post on a Chinese corner kick and left exhausted
and dehydrated.
</P>
<P>
   In a game destined to be determined by possession, the hosts
displayed the speed necessary to prevent China from controlling the
midfield. The US didn't let the Chinese five-midfielder formation
overwhelm its three halfbacks. The forwards came back to help and
the back line sent players up to assist.
</P>
<P>
   Against the Chinese, the US quickly needed to address concerns
about its recent play. In the Americans' five previous Cup matches,
they had gotten off to slow starts. In their 5-0 semifinal rout of
Norway, the Chinese used early goals to set the tone and stifle
midfield play. Entering the final, DiCicco's team knew it had to
prevent China from scoring in the first 10 minutes. Also, the
Americans _ particularly star forward Mia Hamm and cocaptain
midfielder Julie Foudy _ had to elevate their play.
</P>
<P>
   For the first 10 minutes, China failed to pressure Scurry. In
fact, the visitors only recorded two shots in the opening 45
minutes _ both late in the half. Well known for their ability to
score off free kicks, the Chinese had a perfect opportunity in the
35th minute with Sun Wen. However, the ball sailed over the
crossbar. Pu Wei sent a ball wide in the 40th minute.
</P>
<P>
   To counter the Chinese attack, which came perilously close to
scoring from inside the penalty box, the Americans deployed Kate
Sobrero to mark Chinese scoring sensation Sun. Wherever Sun had the
ball, Sobrero was there.
</P>
<P>
   The American defense came well prepared to stop the fleet-footed
Chinese, notorious for quick, short passes up front and the ability
of their forwards to catch up with long passes from the back and
slip past defenders. The US regularly beat the Chinese to the ball
in the first 45 minutes and on a few occasions stripped Sun and Liu
Ailing. Early in the game, Hamm came back from her forward position
to the 18-yard-line, where she knocked the ball from Liu's feet.
The Americans also used their height advatage to head balls out of
the penalty area. Late in the second half, Chastain made a 3-yard
sliding tackle to stop the dangerous Zhang Ouying.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think both teams wanted to attack,'' said DiCicco. ``We
wanted to attack. To their credit, they're a very good defensive
team. It's hard to keep the ball against the way they play defense.
Trust me, I'm delighted in the outcome, but I wish there had been
some goals.''
</P>
<P>
   The hosts tested Chinese keeeper Gao Hong with a few high shots
and close crosses. The Americans outshot the Chinese, 4-2, in the
first half and recorded the only shot on goal before intermission.
In the eighth minute, Hamm curved a free kick around the Chinese
defense and had Akers making a run to the far post. But the veteran
midfielder was a stride too slow to capitalize. Four minutes later,
Akers took aim from 35 yards, forcing Gao off her line and into the
air for the save.
</P>
<P>
   In the second half and overtime, the Chinese picked up their
offensive tempo and finished the game outshooting the US, 12-11,
including a 4-1 advantage in the first overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though the American team won, I think the Chinese team is
the best team in the world,'' said Chinese coach Ma Yuanan.
</P>
<P>
   But more than numbers, the American understood they had secured
women's soccer a foothold in the sports landscape.
</P>
<P>
   ``This moment is more than a game,'' said Lilly. ``It's about
female athletes. It's about sport. It's about everything. I don't
think we can sustain this level of attention. But I think people
caught on to us. They attached themselves to us and I don't think
they're going to let go.''

INTERLEAGUE BRINGS BIG GAMES TO BIG APPLE  
 NYC EXCITED ABOUT POSSIBLE SUBWAY SERIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Big Apple. The city that never sleeps. America's
gutter. New York City, the lone American city that can hold its own
with any destination on the planet, can be different things to so
many.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever it truly represents, if New York is viewed objectively
it remains the undisputed capital of the professional sports world,
specifically baseball.
</P>
<P>
   It has generally been an accepted notion that Major League
Baseball's golden era began just after World War II and came to a
halt with the end of the 1950s. For proof, look no further than
Yogi Berra, the king of baseball one-liners, who confirmed the
belief.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that time, it was the golden era,'' Berra said, putting
things in the type of perspective that only he seems capable of
doing. ``But baseball is still good.''
</P>
<P>
   It should come as no surprise that from 1946 to 1959, a club
from New York appeared in the World Series 18 times. Seven of those
years, the World Series never left New York City, reinforcing the
term ``Subway Series'' as a part of baseball's landscape.
</P>
<P>
   With the Yankees, far and away the most storied and decorated
club in big league history, and cross-town New York Mets each in a
position to qualify for the playoffs (each would if the season
ended today), the burning desire of every New York fan is no
secret.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York likes excitement,'' said former Brooklyn Dodgers
pitcher Joe Black. ``A New York World Series would have definite
entertainment value. I don't think it would have the same frenzy of
the old Dodgers-Yankees World Series. Now it's just words across
the chest of each club. Before it was in the fans' hearts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be for the championship of New York and baseball. But
the drive inside the players' hearts, I don't think, would be the
same. They don't adopt the same loyalty that existed back then.''
</P>
<P>
   It's possible the allegiances each New York borough had with its
club _ Brooklyn with the Dodgers, the Bronx with the Yankees and
Manhattan with the Giants _ may no longer exist, but it doesn't
take much for New York to reach fever pitch when it comes to the
possibility of the first Subway Series in 43 years.
</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers have spent the last few days doing nothing but
talking about the Yankees-Mets interleague series this weekend,
praying it's a prelude to an October meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have an idea of what it would be like,'' said Mets assistant
general manager Omar Minaya, who grew up a few minutes from Shea
Stadium in Flushing. ``I assure you, whatever idea I have, it would
be 10 times more.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stock market would have to close because no one would get
any work done. A New York World Series would be felt worldwide,
because the financial markets would come to a stop. I hope Wall
Street has some sort of emergency plans.''
</P>
<P>
   If Saturday's raucous crowd was an indication of what an October
meeting between these two clubs might bring, then Minaya's
prediction may very well be true.
</P>
<P>
   In the 37 years the Mets and Yankees have shared New York, the
two clubs have never made the playoffs in the same season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we're that far away from it happening,'' Yankees
center fielder Bernie Williams said. ``With a few breaks, it could
happen. This might be the year. If it does, there will be riots in
the streets. It would definitely be wild.''
</P>
<P>
   The Subway Series was born in 1921, when the Yankees and
then-New York Giants shared the famed Polo Grounds and each won
their respective league to set up New York's dream matchup.
</P>
<P>
   The Polo Grounds was the Giants' home park, and they agreed to
allow the Yankees to play their home games there for a fee. The
bitterness in their rivalry was born that season when the Giants
were offended their tenants consistently drew larger home crowds
during the regular season than they did.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants served notice that 1922 would be the Yankees' final
one at the Polo Grounds. The Yankees, with a young up-and-coming
right fielder by the name of Babe Ruth in their midst, began
construction on Yankee Stadium, also known as the House that Ruth
Built.
</P>
<P>
   As much as many throughout the rest of the country may cringe
when they think of New York and everything it represents, Major
League Baseball has always ridden a little higher when a New York
club was on top.
</P>
<P>
   ``I agree that New Yorkers can be awful and snobby, and I'm one
of them,'' said longtime ``New York Daily News'' baseball writer
Red Foley, now retired. ``If you play on a New York team in any
sport, you're instantly perceived as being better than any player
anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   ``The perception is always how the backup Yankees catcher or
middle infielder could start anywhere else. And let's face it,
perception is the whole thing in sports.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York's case, perception is backed up by the cascade of
media here. New York remains the media capital of the world. So
it's only natural that a glut of attention comes from being a
champion in New York.
</P>
<P>
   For proof, look to stately Yankees Manager Joe Torre, who is
featured on a national television campaign for a financial
investment company.
</P>
<P>
   Even with all the attention di rected toward these three games
between the Yankees and Mets, the players continue to try and
insist Yankees-Mets interleague games are nothing special.
</P>
<P>
   But megastar Jerry Seinfeld, Wimbledon champion Lindsay
Davenport, Mayor and Senate hopeful Rudy Giuliani, and the
extremely satisfied Donald Trump don't collectively show up for any
ordinary regular season game, as they did Friday night. The nearly
deafening beat that pulsated throughout Shea Stadium over the
weekend was very real.
</P>
<P>
   For a city that normally is running several miles per hour
faster than anywhere else, the jump over the weekend had it going
at nearly breakneck speed, no matter how much players from both
sides tried to downplay it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just another game?'' Yankees bench coach Don Zimmer asked. ``I
don't buy that (expletive). These people are whoopin' and
hollerin'. This is the party of their life. This is wild.
Everything about it is different.''
</P>
<P>
   Three Yankees players missed the second of three team buses that
ran Yankees players and staff from the Bronx to Queens, where Shea
Stadium is located.
</P>
<P>
   Not wanting their boys to sit around for another 90 minutes
waiting for the next bus, a New York City police officer
volunteered to take the three Yankees on the 12-mile drive that can
take up to 45 minutes with heavy traffic.
</P>
<P>
   The three team buses that brought Yankees personnel also had
police escorts, sirens and all, for their drive through three of
New York's five boroughs.
</P>
<P>
   All this talk of a possible all-New York World Series has
brought back sweet memories of the time when New York City seemed
to own the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we would play the Yankees in the Series, I would ride the
subway from my home in Brooklyn to Ebbets Field,'' Black said.
``You couldn't get on without hearing everyone talking about
baseball. They didn't really know me and would ask who I was for.
I'd tell them I like players on both teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'd ask where I was sitting, and I'd say I had a friend who
sometimes let me in the ballpark. They wanted to come along, but
I'd say he wouldn't let me in unless I was alone. The Brooklyn fans
felt like it was truly their team, like we were all family. In a
way, we were family because we were in it together.'' &QL;

<P>
   PASADENA, CALIF. - Lost in the moment, she defined the moment.
</P>
<P>
   With the ball safely in the net and a groundbreaking victory in
hand, Brandi Chastain ripped off her shirt in jubilation, stunning
the crowd and an international television audience with the sight
of . . .
</P>
<P>
   A black sports bra.
</P>
<P>
   I am woman. Hear me score.
</P>
<P>
   ``Momentary insanity. Nothing more, nothing less,'' Chastain
explained. ``I just kind of lost my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   A nation knows the feeling.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the U.S. Women's soccer team put the exclamation
point on a daring vision. After two overtimes and 120 minutes of
pressure-packed drama, after a gut-wrenching round of penalty
kicks, they outlasted fatigue, heat and a powerful China team to
win the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   And as they paraded around the Rose Bowl, with gold medals
bouncing around their necks and silver confetti swirling around
their heads, they were very much aware of their place in history. A
team with a cause, a team with their own declaration of
independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of America is part of this victory and (part) of this
team,'' U.S. Coach Tony DiCicco said. ``They so much epitomize what
America is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to cheer the American flag, to find the patriot
within, but this well runs much deeper. From the beginning, this
was about liberation, shattering perceptions, creating role models
for young women everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will give young girls the courage to try sports and all
types of activities,'' said President Clinton, who witnessed the
match in person, in a television interview.
</P>
<P>
   It has been very easy to stereotype this event, from the Brady
Bunch following to the perception that soccer is the ultimate
symbol of middle-class suburbia. But for the past three weeks,
everything clicked. The attendance figures for the tournament have
been overwhelming. And not only was Saturday's crowd the largest
gathering to ever witness a woman's sporting event, it also beat
the men's World Cup final by 10,000 fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``That knocks the boots off everybody,'' forward Tiffeny
Milbrett said. ``Because no one expected that.''
</P>
<P>
   Stripped to its essence, that is the beauty of this team. They
exceeded a whirlwind of hype, surpassed all expectations, broke
through every barrier. And it should be lost on no one that the
biggest hero on Saturday was the goalie, a woman named Briana
Scurry, a 27-year-old from Minnesota who calls herself ``the fly in
the milk.''
</P>
<P>
   Scurry is also an African-American, proving this team was not
only about gender.
</P>
<P>
   ``Diversity is important for the future of the game,'' Scurry
said. ``Soccer is pretty much a suburban, elitist sport. It always
has been.''
</P>
<P>
   The stated mission of the 1999 World Cup was ``staging a
breakthrough event for women's sports and inspiring the next
generation of female athletes.'' With 2,000 people attending
practice sessions during the week, it's obvious they succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, fans were cloaked in red, white and blue. Some wore
the American flag like capes. Others had their faces painted at a
free booth outside the stadium. Clinton called the event ``in some
ways, the biggest sporting event in the past decade.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the momentum is expected to reach a fever pitch, and
U.S. soccer officials say enrollment in youth leagues will reach
record numbers in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see hundreds of thousands of girls register in the fall
that otherwise wouldn't have registered, if not for this event,''
said Marla Messing, president and CEO of the Women's World Cup.
``They want to be like Mia Hamm and Julie Foudy and play in a
Women's World Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   Prompted by a team of heroes, a team full of inspiration and
role models. And now, they are off for a victory tour, soon to be
seen on Letterman and cereal boxes and T-shirts across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   It will be a while before anyone can judge the full sociological
impact of this team and this event, whether mainstream America is
now ready to accept female sports. But it's a safe bet that a
country of young women and young girls turned off the television on
Saturday feeling pretty good about this team.
</P>

SINDEN, FISHER SEND JOHNSON OUT WITH KIND WORDS 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ They have been friends for 45 years. They have seen
each other through marriage and children, exchanged stories of
their parallel careers, and teased each other relentlessly. Both
are also members of the Hockey Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   When it was announced that Bruins vice president Tom Johnson had
decided to retire from the organization after 36 years and 52 in
the NHL, Montreal Gazette writer Red Fisher couldn't resist the
urge to weigh in on the end of an era.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was never, ever really appreciated in Montreal, even though
he played on all those great teams,'' said Fisher, referring to
Johnson's run with the Canadiens, during which he won six Stanley
Cups. ``The reason for it was he, and others with him, played in
the very long shadow of Doug Harvey. The only defenseman I ever
considered better than Doug Harvey was No. 4 Bobby Orr.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who faces hip replacement surgery in late summer or
early fall, endured a great deal of pain as a player. Fisher said
no matter how much Johnson was suffering, he'd be out there
battling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of all the great players I covered in Montreal in the 1950s, I
don't think there was anybody who played with more pain when he had
to,'' said Fisher. ``He'd take shots in his knees. They were ripped
up, and he'd come out and play. Injuries didn't matter to this guy.
He'd never make any kind of a big deal about it. As a result, he
became a great favorite of (then Canadiens general manager) Frank
Selke Sr. (Selke) didn't play too many favorites, but certainly,
Tom Johnson was one of his favorites. In those days, you didn't
have any players association to say you shouldn't play or you can't
play. This guy came out and played like no other player did. I
admired him a great deal for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson came to the Bruins via the waiver draft in 1963, and
Fisher said it was a very difficult decision for Selke to leave
Johnson exposed.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the kind gestures made by Johnson that few found out
about, Fisher said there was one that stood out. During a game
against the Maple Leafs in Toronto, Johnson's face was sliced open
by a skate blade. The team returned to Montreal after the game, but
Johnson remained in the hospital, and Fisher stayed, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to the hospital to see Tommy because he was a friend,''
said Fisher. ``I had to talk my way into his room, almost force my
way into his room. They wouldn't let anyone but family into the
room because his face had blown up to twice its normal size. Both
eyes were covered in bandages. I spent the afternoon with him. I
flew home the next day, and that same day, a dozen roses were sent
to my wife by Tom, saying `Thanks for your husband's visit to me in
the hospital.' I challenge you to find any other player who would
do something like that. He was that kind of a guy, and always has
been. He was generous to a fault. In Montreal, if there was a party
to be held during an off day, it was almost always held at Tommy
Johnson's. As a player, he never got the credit he deserved. He
deserved his spot in the Hall of Fame. And I don't think anybody
can have a better friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruins president/GM Harry Sinden, another close friend of
Johnson's, said he'll miss seeing him every day in the office.
Johnson has moved to the Cape but will keep in touch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I value his assessment of the players and the team,'' said
Sinden. ``I know he's having his hip replaced. I hope everything
works there and he can get back on the golf course. That's the one
thing outside of hockey that he has a strong interest in. It would
be a shame if he couldn't play golf. He's very confident everything
is going to be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinden said one of his favorite Johnson stories goes back a
number of years. A Montreal Gazette writer, not Fisher, was
criticizing Sinden on a daily basis, and Johnson was reveling in
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in Montreal for the playoffs,'' said Sinden. ``(This
writer) would give it to me all the time. Tom was laughing. One
day, he mentioned Tom in the same way he was giving it to me. It
was the morning of a game; Tom was in there getting it from him.
Now, all of a sudden, it means something. Before, when it was just
me getting ripped, he'd laugh and say, `Look what he said.' We go
to the game that night and we lose, and right next to our dressing
room _ you couldn't move in that little room, it was so crowded.
Well, he sought out the writer and pounced as hard as he could on
his foot. The guy went to his knees, he hit him so hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Chances are there was a wicked grin of satisfaction on Johnson's
face at the time. No matter what the situation, Johnson always
found humor in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's had some tough times physically,'' Sinden said. ``He's
always got a sense of humor and a needle as long as anybody's. He's
really going to be missed around here.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We told you all the wonderful optimism regarding Bruins goalie
Byron Dafoe's contract negotiations was going to fade. So it has.
Dafoe said since the team made him an offer and his camp responded,
talks have ceased. That's not necessarily a problem, but with Dafoe
having until Thursday to decide on filing for arbitration, he would
have liked to have had more dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our phone is there. We're waiting for a return call,'' said
the team's clear-cut MVP. ``If not, we have a decision to make come
July 15. We have not made that decision yet. We're weighing both
sides of the coin. I have an inclination one way, but until I have
to make a decision, I won't make one. There are pluses and minuses
to both sides. We have to decide which has the bigger upside.''
</P>
<P>
   Realistically, Dafoe could not file for arbitration, then
threaten to withhold his services come training camp if no deal is
reached. However, with Dafoe's outstanding statistics, he has a
case for a hefty arbitration award.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have a conference call with the (players
association) early (this) week,'' said Dafoe, a restricted free
agent. ``Hopefully, we hear from Harry and (assistant GM Mike
O'Connell) by then, but if not, then we have to follow through with
what we're going to do. It really comes down to what (agent Ron
Salcer) and I feel is the right way to go. The PA is good for us in
terms of giving us insight into what other players have done and
what they're going to do and what comparable signings have been.
The PA is notorious for their gung ho, hold out, hold out, let's
get the big bucks kind of thing, and that's fine because that's
their job, but the bottom line is: We do what we feel is right.
That's kind of where we're stuck at right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinden said the club expects to meet with Jay Fee, the agent for
backup goalie Rob Tallas, soon on a new deal for the Group 2 free
agent. Sinden also said the team has had preliminary discussions
with representatives for free agents Hal Gill and P.J. Axelsson.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As if professional hockey wasn't dangerous enough, Anaheim star
Teemu Selanne is pushing the envelope with his love of car racing.
The 29-year-old was practicing for a rally event in his native
Finland when he struck another car, injuring the driver, Parliament
member and president of the Finnish Ice Hockey Federation Kalervo
Kummola.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Selanne, who admitted he was at fault, will likely
be charged with reckless driving. The real question is: What is
Selanne doing? The standard player's contract doesn't prohibit car
racing, but it does leave the door open for the Mighty Ducks to
void Selanne's lucrative pact if he suffers a serious injury behind
the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The player and club recognize and agree the player's
participation in other sports may impair or destroy his ability and
skill as a hockey player,'' reads the standard contract.
``Accordingly, the player agrees he will not during the period of
this contract or during any period when he is obligated under his
contract to enter into a further contract with the club engage or
participate in football, baseball, softball, hockey, lacrosse,
boxing, wrestling or other athletic sports without the written
consent of the club, which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Sinden, the consent to which it refers allows
players to skate during the summer in order to keep in shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to say what I'd do,'' said Sinden. ``Our players
have participated in a race up in New Hampshire. It was a stock car
race for charity. But we judged it to be very safe and very
unlikely something would happen. Then you get into the business of
whether that's an athletic contest or not. That clause really only
refers to an athletic contest. If they got hurt doing that, and you
refused to honor the contract, they'd probably sue you to say they
could do that. It's a gray area. We get requests to play hockey,
but I can't remember anybody wanting to play any other sport. For
each individual case, you'd have to judge it.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was an expensive week for the New York Rangers, and truth be
told, they're not much better. They doled out more than $50 million
signing unrestricted free agents Theo Fleury, Stephane Quintal, and
Valeri Kamensky. Quintal and Kamensky alone cost $28.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was certainly not a surprise, not from that team,'' Sinden
said.
</P>
<P>
   Sinden, who was criticized by Rangers GM Neil Smith last fall
for overspending on bonuses for Joe Thornton and Sergei Samsonov
(you can look it up), said he was already in trouble with one
general manager _ Chicago's Bob Murray _ for picking defenseman
Nick Boynton with the 21st selection in last month's draft, and he
didn't want to take the bait on Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob Murray's sick of me,'' Sinden said. ``I don't want to make
Neil Smith sick of me.''
</P>
<P>
   After Murray ripped Sinden on draft day, Sinden called, seeking
a reason for Murray's diatribe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I reached him, but I never got an explanation,'' said Sinden.
``He apologized, but I didn't get an explanation. I would've much
preferred the explanation.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In about a week, it's expected Pat Quinn will officially take
over as general manager of the Maple Leafs, adding that role to his
duties as coach. At the draft in Boston, there was a hullabaloo
between team president Ken Dryden and Quinn over the dismissal of
former associate GM Mike Smith. Dryden said Quinn was involved in
the process. Quinn said he wasn't. But everything appears to have
been smoothed over. ``I got apprised of some of the things,'' Quinn
said, referring to the behind-the-scenes maneuverings. ``Now we
have to go forward. I had no intention of doing anything but
coaching, but now circumstances are different.'' . . . There are 55
days until training camp. Seems like the season just ended, doesn't
it? Maybe because it did.

SCURRY'S SAVING GRACE DELIVERS US 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ She knew the Chinese would never put five
straight penalty kicks by her. Never. ``I knew somehow, some way, I
was going to get my hands on one of them,'' Briana Scurry said. And
the US keeper knew, as soon as she saw Liu Ying walk to the spot
for the third attempt, that she had her pigeon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew that was going to be the one,'' the former University
of Massachusetts star said after her decisive block of Liu's shot
allowed her exhausted teammates to reclaim the World Cup with a 5-4
penalty-kick verdict. ``I can't tell you how. I just knew.''
</P>
<P>
   She knew the way keepers always know, by the little signals
shooters give when they take the long walk from midfield to the
spot. Forwards, who spend their lives working in the penalty area,
walk more decisively to the ball than midfielders or defenders do,
Scurry said.
</P>
<P>
   Liu was a midfielder, a midfielder who had just spent 120
minutes running up and down the flank in 90-degree heat. The last
thing she looked like she wanted to do was kick a ball at the
world's best keeper with the world watching.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really didn't look like she wanted to shoot it,'' Scurry
noticed. ``She just didn't look like she wanted to be there. She
didn't have that confidence. You could see it in the way she walked
up there.''
</P>
<P>
   So Scurry homed in on Liu like a hawk on a squirrel, spread her
gloved wings, dived left, and swatted the ball away. One save was
all it would take, Scurry knew, given her sharpshooter teammates.
One save was all she was expected to make _ if that. ``Make one and
you're a hero,'' coach Tony DiCicco, an old keeper himself, had
told Scurry.
</P>
<P>
   Keepers aren't expected to make any. They stand in the middle of
the shooting gallery, 12 yards from the spot. They have to cover
192 square feet. They can't move until the ball is kicked. Firing
squad victims have better odds.
</P>
<P>
   Scurry hadn't had to face a penalty kick shootout in four years,
since the Norwegians beat the US in a tournament in Portugal. But
she'd sensed she might see one Saturday, given how evenly matched
the Americans and Chinese were. Once the Swiss referee whistled the
end of overtime and the US lost the coin flip, Scurry went to her
line and prepared for the fusillade.
</P>
<P>
   After Xie Huilin and Qiu Haiyan beat her cleanly, Scurry simply
shrugged and waited for her pigeon. Once she'd thwarted Liu, she
celebrated then turned away, waiting for her teammates to finish
it. ``I don't ever watch them take kicks,'' Scurry said. ``I used
to do it with my club team but it seemed every time I did, they
missed.''
</P>
<P>
   So Scurry never saw Kristine Lilly, Mia Hamm, and Brandi
Chastain blast their shots past Gao Hong. All she heard was a roar
from 90,000 throats and saw her white-clad mates jump 10 feet in
the air. Her job was already done. The keeper only has to stop one.

SHOT OF BRANDI PROVIDES US BOOST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHIRA SPRINGER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Brandi Chastain does not follow convention
and does not fear change.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday in the Women's World Cup final, the record-setting Rose
Bowl crowd held its breath as she placed the ball on the penalty
marker. She stood 12 yards away from history and had no intention
of playing it safe. And no intention of repeating past mistakes.
She would take the penalty kick on which rested American hopes and
years of preparation with her weaker left foot. There was no doubt
about it. When the biggest moment of her soccer career came and the
game was at her feet, Chastain took the risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had been training on penalty kicks all week, all Cup,''
said Chastain. ``Normally, up until this last week, I'd been taking
them with my right foot. The last time I missed against China (in
the Algarve Cup), I took it with my right foot and (US coach Tony
DiCicco) talked me into changing to my left foot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just walked up there and I felt very calm, to be honest with
you. I didn't hear any noise. I didn't get caught up in looking at
(Chinese goalie) Gao (Hong). Sometimes she likes to get into a
staring match and smile at you and make you feel a little bit
uneasy. I didn't look at her and as soon as the whistle blew, I
just stepped up and hit and kind of lost my mind. I just thought
this is the greatest moment of my life on the soccer field and I
just lost control.''
</P>
<P>
   Chastain celebrated by falling to her knees, pumping both fists
in the air, and ripping off her uniform top. It was vintage
Chastain and perfect redemption for a player who worked her way
back to the national team after missing the '95 World Cup, who
scored an own goal in the quarterfinals against Germany, and who
has struggled to prove that she's more than the team's sex symbol.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to her game-winning penalty shot, Chastain garnered more
fame for her off-field antics. Her poster-girl looks and appearance
in Gear magazine wearing only a soccer ball have made her a popular
guest on David Letterman's Late Show. Her sun-bleached blonde
ponytail and carefree California attitude prompted Letterman to
call the women's national team ``Babe City.''
</P>
<P>
   Her performance in the championship game gave her a forum to
reflect upon a lengthy career with the national team and her
unusual path to 1999 World Cup hero.
</P>
<P>
   Chastain, 30, was a member of the 1991 world championship team
and saw action in two games, starting one. She did not make the
1995 team. After a two-year absence from the US squad, she returned
to the top level in September 1995 and then, converted from forward
to defender, in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   She had no bad memories from the Americans' 1995 semifinal loss
to call upon for motivation. But she did have some unfinished
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to regain (the Cup) for the pride of our team, for the
pride of our country, for the pride of US soccer,'' Chastain said.
``For me, it was more of finishing a circle. I began with the
national team as a young player and in 1991 we won the Cup. Then,
we won the Olympics. Now, it's the closure of this story.''
</P>
<P>
   In a Top 10 list a few weeks ago, Letterman joked, ``You'll come
for the Hamm. You'll stay for the Brandi.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Chastain got the final cheer and the last laugh.

FRANCE DRIVING FORCE IN NASCAR SURGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ The hallways of NASCAR's headquarters are
exquisitely appointed with photographs and artifacts that pay
tribute to its past and present. But there is a framed
black-and-white photo of a strapping Bill France Jr. in his early
20s _ a toothy smile creasing his face as he sits perched atop a
piece of road construction equipment _ that seems to depict just
how far the 66-year-old NASCAR president has come in his undisputed
stewardship of the world's largest auto racing sanctioning body.
</P>
<P>
   From road construction worker to auto racing czar.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was merely striking a pose or actually knew how to
operate the piece of machinery, France reclined in a plush leather
chair in his gymnasium-sized office and confirmed that, yes, he
indeed knew his way around a ``vibratory compactor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yeah, I drove it all day for many a day,'' he said,
recalling how he assisted in the building of the flagship facility
of his family's racing empire, the 2.5-mile superspeedway at
Daytona. ``It's similar to those big rollers that you see now
working on the roads. But this machine vibrated all the grains of
sand, locked it together, and packed it down. I worked out there on
it for about 13, 14 months.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, he can drive just about any piece of machinery that
there is,'' said 36-year-old Brian France, NASCAR's senior vice
president of marketing and communications and the younger of Bill
and Betty Jane France's two children, both of whom hold high-level
positions in the family's businesses. Sister Lesa France Kennedy
serves as an executive vice president and board member of
International Speedway Corp., a publicly-owned corporation that
recently expanded its holdings with the $700 million acquisiton of
Penske Motorsports, giving ISC control of 10 tracks (with four more
on the drawing board) and 14 NASCAR Winston Cup dates.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is very mechanical-minded, and it probably served him well
in the competition area,'' Brian added. ``He's a well-rounded guy.
If he came along today, he's so good at so many things _ he's good
at communications, he's good at marketing, he's a good technician,
and has a feel for all those aspects of the sport _ that he'd
probably be frustrated just doing one part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet it is hard to imagine that, during his time working on
the construction of Daytona International Speedway, France never
stopped to take in the huge project and envision the fame and
fortune the object of his labors would one day bring his family and
the burgeoning sport of stock car racing.
</P>
<P>
   As far as he was concerned, there was only one visionary in the
family.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was my father,'' France said, referring to Bill Sr.,
NASCAR's founder, who died in 1992, some two decades after he
handed over the reins to Bill Jr. ``I'd like to say that I could
really see all that, but my father was the one who was the main guy
at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now, as NASCAR finds itself speeding toward the high-banked turn
of the century, Bill France Jr. is being looked upon as the man
whose vision will continue to drive the wildly successful and
widely publicized NASCAR Winston Cup Series, the sanctioning body's
premier division, and position it among the mainstream American
professional sports leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I think he really wants us to be recognized as a top
sports league in this country,'' his son said. ``That's what he
wants, and he knows that the numbers now are undeniable.''
</P>
<P>
   At the 1998 Winston Cup awards banquet in New York, where Jeff
Gordon was feted as the champion of NASCAR's 50th anniversary
season, France took the podium and said it was his desire to see
NASCAR not only join ranks with, but also rival the NFL, NBA, NHL,
and Major League Baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're there, to a large degree, right now,'' France
said. ``They used to talk about the Big Five being baseball,
football, basketball, hockey, and maybe tennis. But the Big Five
now are those first three, NASCAR _ and not just auto racing but
NASCAR _ and golf. So if you look at what the people are watching,
the NFL is still leading the charts. But we're doing just as well
as the others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then you take the live gate. If you look at the attendance,
we're just about 19 of the top 20 (sporting) events. We outdraw a
lot of the sporting events in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   To illustrate the point, the 70th baseball All-Star Game will be
held Tuesday at Fenway Park, but its combined gate for the two days
of pregame festivities and the game itself will likely fail to
outdraw Sunday's Jiffy Lube 300 NASCAR Winston Cup race at New
Hampshire International Speedway in Loudon, where 100,000
spectators are expected.
</P>
<P>
   And while its TV ratings have yet to approach the numbers
achieved by baseball and football, Winston Cup racing has enjoyed a
steady increase in viewership over the last three years, prompting
NASCAR officials in February to consolidate their television rights
in the hopes of landing a lucrative TV package that some are
speculating will fetch anywhere from $300-$500 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know what the market will bear,'' said Kevin
Triplett, NASCAR's director of operations. ``But we think we're
taking a good product to market.''
</P>
<P>
   And that is due in large part to France's management of the
series. He has elevated the one-time regional sport, whose sponsors
were largely automotive-related and whose fans largely hailed from
the Southeast, to a national sport that has grown to reach markets
from coast to coast and has attracted major consumer product
sponsorships.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But what does the future hold for NASCAR? What is France's
vision?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we need to keep doing what we're doing now and try not
to let something start snowballing,'' he said. ``One of my bigger
fears, and it's always been a concern, is if the costs of having a
car out there gets prohibitive for race fans to buy tickets and it
doesn't get prohibitive for networks to sell advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has to be some kind of a balance if you're going to have
a good economic system. And if that influences what the product is
going to be, then we've got to keep our racing healthy. When I say
healthy, I'm not just talking about 40 cars at a racetrack, but
good competitive racing that's exciting and that you'll want to
watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it costs too much to go racing, or if any of those numbers
get out of sync with the revenue that's involved with a company . .
. then you're not going to be around long, and doors are going to
get shut.''
</P>
<P>
   But France has taken measures to ensure NASCAR remains a
profitable venture well into the next millennium. In February, he
announced he was stepping aside and handing over day-to-day
operations to Mike Helton, who now oversees all of NASCAR's
divisions as chief operating officer. Initially, the public
perception was that France was getting ready to retire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, it had come off that way in some regard, but it was
simply a commitment from Bill and his family . . . to develop
another level of management,'' Helton said. ``And while the
day-to-day operations were something that he gave up, he didn't
give up everything. He's as busy today as he's ever been. He just
divided up some of the things he routinely did from an
organizational chart.''
</P>
<P>
   By lightening his load, France was able to focus his attention
on the merger between ISC and Penske Motorsports, one that will
make the new conglomerate the largest provider of motorsports
events in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill is a very serious individual,'' said Roger Penske, a
Winston Cup and CART car owner who will serve on the ISC board as
vice chairman. ``He stands by his word. I think he has never taken
his eye off the garage, and he's stayed very close to the athletes,
the car owners, and the track owners. And he's developed a
tremendous loyalty, and that's what kept his sport together.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even with all of his tremendous success, he's not let any of
that get him away from the core business, which is dealing at the
track level with the officials, the competitors, and car owners. I
think you've seen that with what he's done at his tracks; we're
trying to make that the ultimate fan experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Said NHIS owner Bob Bahre, ``In all honesty, (France is) the
type of a guy _ and I'm not just saying this because I've got two
(Winston Cup) dates _ who's a pleasure to do business with. There
aren't too many people today you can say that about. He has the
upper hand because he controls all the dates, but you'd never think
so when you talk to him. He's just kind of a regular guy, and I
consider him a pretty good friend.''
</P>
<P>
   At a race last year in Atlanta, France was spotted as he walked
past a long line of fans. He was taken aback when one woman asked
him for an autograph. Why, he asked, would anyone want his
autograph?
</P>
<P>
   ``Because you're the reason we're all here,'' the woman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, if I don't wake up tomorrow,'' he drawled, ``they'll
still run this race without me.''
</P>
<P>
   He knows there will be a day when the show will indeed go on
without him. By then, however, he hopes it will be strong enough to
withstand his absence. How will he ever reconcile his retirement
with his immense passion for the sport he helped to build? How will
his love of deep sea fishing, airplanes, and all things mechanical
replace his deep-rooted love of racing?
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll work out,'' France said. ``I'll need to get out of the
way one day, so the younger ones can take over and a whole lot of
people can have some moves.''
</P>
<P>
   But even then, Bill France Jr. will always remain a prominent
figure in NASCAR's big picture.

CRAVEN LOOKING FOR GOOD RUN AT HOME 
</HEADLINE>
 RACING NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA

   LOUDON, N.H. _ Ricky Craven stood in his garage at New Hampshire
International Speedway Friday afternoon and smiled wearily as he
tried to describe the support he got from New England fans at
qualifying for Sunday's Jiffy Lube 300 NASCAR Winston Cup race.
</P>
<P>
   Although the wild fan reaction was drowned out by the throaty
roar of his No. 50 Midwest Transit Chevrolet Monte Carlo, Craven, a
33-year-old native of Newburgh, Maine, said the home crowd did not
go unnoticed or unappreciated after he landed a solid 12th starting
spot with a run of 129.732 miles per hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this sport is much different from any other
professional sport,'' said Craven, who has been exposed to both the
exhilarating and humbling sides of the NASCAR circuit. ``The good
days are hard to come by when you're in the position I'm in, which
is a rebuilding mode. I'm trying to reestablish myself.''
</P>
<P>
   That was why Friday's fan reaction was just the pick-me-up
Craven needed, especially after his Winston Cup career took a
tumultuous turn following a stirring pole victory in last year's
Jiffy Lube 300.
</P>
<P>
   ``This place is just so good to me,'' Craven said. ``I don't
know what it is, but coming here is always a boost. The fans, I
guess . . . I just wish I could take them with me every week
because it's so motivating to have that kind of support.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Craven came to NHIS and got a huge boost when he won
the pole for the Jiffy Lube 300, wresting it away from former
Hendrick Motorsports teammate Jeff Gordon. It came in Craven's
first race back in the No. 50 Budweiser Chevrolet after he spent 3
1/2 months recovering from the effects of post-concussion syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very, very difficult time in my career because I
didn't know if I was ever going to race again,'' he said. ``I
didn't know if I was going to be allowed to race again. I didn't
even know if I could or if I'd even be given the chance, you know?
</P>
<P>
   ``In those 90 days, I think I experienced every emotion
possible, but coming back and winning the pole was like, `Ahhh.'
Was it a championship? No, but for that day we were best and nobody
can take it away from you. But if you can do that once, then why
can't you do that every week? You can't, you just have to
understand what your weaknesses are and you've got to expand on
your strengths.''
</P>
<P>
   Three races later, Craven resigned from his ride with Hendrick
Motorsports, a well-heeled and successful three-car team he called
``the Chicago Bulls of racing.'' He arrived for the 1999 Daytona
500 as driver for SB III Motorsports, but parted ways with that
outfit following a 31st-place effort in the MBNA Platinum 400 at
Dover, Del.
</P>
<P>
   After he sat out the next three races, Craven signed on with
owners Hal Hicks and Mike Witters to drive _ on a race-to-race
basis _ their Midwest Transit-sponsored Chevy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a tough couple of years, really,'' said Craven, who
started 30th and finished 43d in his debut in the Midwest Transit
car last Saturday night at Daytona in the Pepsi 400. ``Last year
really wasn't much fun and this year we were so far behind the
8-ball most of the year, we seemed to be fighting an uphill battle
and it's a hard way to race. But I'm really excited about being
with these guys because there's a lot of potential. There's no . .
. we all have the same agenda: we want to perform well, we want to
run well, and we want to get better every week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a couple of years from now when we're back in our top
form _ in two weeks or two months or two years or whenever I get
back to where I feel I'm in contention _ I'll have toughened up
because I think I'll have experienced the highest of highs and the
lowest of lows.''

   Points leader Dale Jarrett thought it was a good omen that the
last six Winston Cup champions led the points race at the midway
point of the season. However, Jarrett, who extended his lead over
Bobby Labonte to 177 points (2,674 to 2,497) with a victory in the
Pepsi 400, was quick to point out one thing. ``I guess the downside
of that is, the last time somebody lost it, he was in a Robert
Yates car, and nobody's pointing that out,'' Jarrett said,
referring to how in 1992 Davey Allison led in points halfway
through the season but eventually lost to Alan Kulwicki. ``We want
to make sure we continue the string they've had for six years in a
row now. But it's good because I think over the last three years,
the second half of the season has been better for our race team and
that's good for us to look at in that sense. But we also realize
that we've had a tremendous first half of the season and we have a
lot of confidence, too, and we certainly want to be sitting here
next year talking about how it happened seven years in a row.''
Halfway through the 34-race season, Jarrett is not expecting to sit
on his lead by driving conservatively. ``I have no idea when that
point may come, but it's not now, that's for sure,'' he said. ``Our
lead could be gone here (Sunday) by having a bad day and Bobby
Labonte finishing up front like he has all year. We've got to
continue to try and win races and we've got to hope that we're good
enough and that we don't have any problems and that we can continue
to build on our lead.'' . . . Though he qualified third for
Sunday's race in his No. 18 Interstate Batteries Pontiac, Labonte
remained perplexed by the tricky mile oval at NHIS. ``We've been
coming up here since 1990 and you'd think we'd get something
figured out by now,'' he said. ``I know where all the best
restaurants are . . . but it's always fun to come here, because
it's always challenging.'' Labonte's favorite eatery? The Grist
Mill.

   While Dale Earnhardt Jr. will be driving Sunday with a chipped
right shoulder blade, the toughest man in Sunday's race will be
none other than Mark Martin. The driver of the No. 6 Valvoline Ford
Taurus suffered fractures in his left wrist, left ribs, and tibia
plateau of his left knee when he crashed July 2 during a happy-hour
practice session for the Pepsi 400. Martin showed up the next day
with a cast on his wrist and gutted out a 17th-place finish after
he was forced to start his backup car from the rear of the field.
Wednesday, Martin underwent surgery on his knee and had a screw
placed in it to provide more stability to his kneecap, so he could
compete at NHIS. Although Matt Kenseth was brought in as a
precautionary measure, Martin endured excruciating pain to qualify
Saturday in the second round. ``Well, I'd rather be doing this than
laying on a bed,'' Martin said. ``We're doing OK. We're not as fast
as we need to be and I'm not as much of a hero as I'd like to be,
so we're doing the best we can do.'' As far as his game plan? ``I'm
going all the way. That's it. We're gonna race as hard as we can
race.'' . . . With the baseball All-Star Game being held Tuesday at
Fenway, several drivers weighed in with their predictions. Jeremy
Mayfield, a Reds and Braves fan, and Ward Burton, a Cardinals fan,
picked the National League, while John Andretti chose the American
League ``unless they invert the field after the fifth inning,'' he
said, referring to NASCAR's all-star race, the Winston, where the
field is inverted midway through the race. ``I don't get the chance
to follow baseball much, but if it's anything like our all-star
game, it ought to be exciting,'' said Mayfield. ``Of course, in
their all-star game, if they make a mistake they call it an error.
In our all-star game, if you make a mistake they call it a big
wreck.''

GREAT DEBATE TURNS INTO NO-BRAINER 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM McCABE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Tiger Woods is ranked No. 1 in the world. David Duval
is ranked No. 2. The last time we were here, there was a huge
outcry about supposed injustice. Not much noise this time.
</P>
<P>
   Nor should there be. Woods has won three times in his last four
starts (one in Germany). He has broken 70 in 10 of his last 16
rounds on the PGA Tour. In 15 starts this year, including his
appearance in Germany, he has four wins and six other top 10s.
</P>
<P>
   Week in and week out, Woods is the best. It shouldn't even be
debated. His performance at the Western Open last week was a
spectacular display of power and finesse, a clinic on 300-yard,
fairway-splitting drives and flop shots out of nasty rough to pins
cut tight. (Which is to say nothing about his splendid commercials.
Would you say the man has some hand-eye coordination? Or can we not
say anything while the litigation is in process?)
</P>
<P>
   Quite often we overlook how consistent Woods is. Since turning
pro in 1996, he has played in 77 PGA Tour events and missed just
one cut (two if you count the AT&AMP;T debacle last year when Woods and
many others did not return five months later to play a third
round). Just as impressive is the fact that nearly every time he
sticks the peg in the ground, Woods is in contention.
</P>
<P>
   Duval shot a 59, won four times in his first eight starts this
season, and generally deserved his short-lived reign as No. 1. But
as good as he is, he's a notch below Woods.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, unless they go head to head this week at the
British Open, that silly Aug. 2 made-for-TV event will get even
more hype. Too bad, because without tournament pressure on the
line, the event doesn't have any taste. Then again, tasteless TV is
what we love.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

   It is a safe assumption that Jesper Parnevik, who plays most of
his golf in the US, is an automatic as one of captain Mark James's
two picks for the European Ryder Cup team. But it is not out of the
realm of possibility that Parnevik could qualify automatically.
It's a long shot, of course, but a victory at the British Open (he
has two seconds and a fourth in the event since 1994), on top of
his strong performance at the Loch Lomond (joint fifth) could vault
him in the standings. If he moves closer to the top 10, look for
him to play more events in Europe to gain points in an effort to
make things easier for James. Of course, there are other matters on
the eccentric Swede's mind these days. Only Parnevik could explain,
after missing a short putt in the second round Thursday, that there
was what he considered a good reason for his miscue. ``I've had
this bet with my caddie and I was trying to figure it out,''
Parnevik told reporters. ``If you put a rope around the earth and
then put another one about it on 3-foot stakes, what is the
difference in length? I told him it is less than 20 yards and he
thinks it's 10,000 or something.'' And you stand over short putts
thinking about which way they will break? . . . While you can count
on Parnevik being at The Country Club, it appears as though two
experienced Ryder Cuppers need not book seats on the Concorde. Ian
Woosnam has said he is sick of the Ryder Cup; his play of late
indicates he is sick of golf. Woosnam has missed the cut the last
two weeks, and with just two top-10 finishes this year, he is 36th
in the standings. Costantino Rocca missed the cut at Loch Lomond
and his best finish in 17 starts is a 10th at the Italian Open. He
has been top 20 just one other time and in 60 rounds this year he
has broken 70 just 15 times . . . As for James, he repeated again
last week he will not be a player-captain, something the Ryder Cup
matches have not had since Arnold Palmer in 1963. But while he
indicated earlier in the season that he would lean toward not
playing, he has been in such fine form lately (he is seventh in the
standings) that there are now thoughts of relinquishing his
captain's duties. At a recent meeting with some media members, Ben
Crenshaw quipped: ``The American captain has no such worries.''
Indeed, it has been a rough year for Crenshaw, who withdrew from
the British Open the other day. He has missed the cut in all 11 of
his starts, with just one sub-70 round in 23 efforts. Crenshaw is
so passionate about golf history, you know it must be killing him
not to be at a venue such as Carnoustie, but he showed a ton of
class when he explained in his withdrawal letter: ``I want to give
my space to somebody who could make better use of it.'' . . . The
withdrawals of Americans from the British Open also included Tom
Kite, John Daly, Fred Couples, and Steve Jones. Kite is simply
waiting to turn 50, which he'll do Dec. 9. Daly was no surprise. He
desperately needs to get away from the game and here's hoping he
gets rest, works out a few problems, and returns in good form
because a good John Daly is something the game needs. Couples's WD
is bothersome. He cited the fact that he wasn't playing well. So
what? He's a world-class player and should have more regard for a
game that has made him so wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jack Nicklaus's withdrawal from the US Senior Open, on the heels
of bowing out of the Senior Players Championship, is no cause for
alarm, according to Dr. Benjamin Bierbaum. ``His hip is fine. He
was playing to get in shape. He was tired of hanging out, hitting
balls, and exercising, but, no surprise, he pushed it to the
limit.'' Bierbaum performed left hip replacement surgery on
Nicklaus Jan. 27 at New England Baptist Hospital and had said then
that ``I didn't think he'd be ready for the endurance of
competitive golf'' for six months. But Nicklaus came back in four
months to play in a Senior PGA Tour event, then his own Memorial
Tournament. He also played at the US Open at Pinehurst but with
Bierbaum watching from the gallery on Friday, Nicklaus missed the
cut and acknowledged the hip was sore. ``The doctor was right,''
said Nicklaus on his way out of Pinehurst. Bierbaum prescribed rest
for the 59-year-old Nicklaus, though the Golden Bear left open the
possibility of playing a pro-am with Michael Jordan Thursday, then
taking part in the ensuing Ameritech Senior Open at Kemper Lakes
outside of Chicago . . . A few days after his clubs were stolen
from his garage, Greg Norman got them back, just in time for the
British Open. A man who had worked on the roof of Norman's home in
Hobe Sound, Fla., turned himself in after being suspected of
stealing two sets of custom-made Cobra clubs. He faces criminal
charges and the guess here is that he can forget about a job
referral . . . The phenom is playing quite well, thank you.
Shooting low numbers, going about the job as efficiently as
observers had predicted. Sergio Garcia? Well, sure. But how about
Grace Park? The Korean-born teenager has played in four Futures
Tour events and won two. She already ranks ninth on the money list
(top three earn LPGA Tour cards for 2000) and the eight players
ahead of her have played an average of nearly 12 events. Last
year's US Women's Amateur champion has refused _ at the insistence
of her father, who runs the show _ sponsor's exemptions into LPGA
Tour events in favor of the low-key, hard life of the Futures Tour.
Park takes her act to Avon, Conn., for this week's stop . . . Juli
Inkster's outstanding 1999 season is continuing with the Michelob
Light Classic this weekend, then she'll play the JAL Big Apple in
New York next week. After a week off, she'll enter the du Maurier,
then decide on the area.WEB.com Challenge at Pleasant Valley the
week after. Inkster's success this year, she said, can be
attributed to her decision to go with a left-hand-low putting grip
_ but mainly on short putts. ``I don't really have a set footage,''
she said. ``I just do more by feel.''

RUMOR MILL WARMS AS TRADE DEADLINE NEARS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Baseball marches inexorably toward the July 31 trade deadline.
The rumors mount.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are quietly shopping pitcher Andy Pettitte, who is
9-13 with a 5.56 earned-run average in his past 27 starts going
back to last year. Pettitte is making $5.9 million this season and
is arbitration-eligible. The Yankees would prefer to use that money
toward securing shortstop Derek Jeter and reliever Mariano Rivera
to long-term contracts. The Yankees also think that Pettitte's
reliance on a cut fastball is robbing him of his velocity, just as
it did with Jim Abbott.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians need a third baseman now that Travis Fryman could be
gone for the season. They have asked about Wade Boggs, but the
Devil Rays want him to get his 3,000th hit for them. They have
talked with San Diego about Carlos Baerga, with the Cubs about Gary
Gaetti and with Pittsburgh about Ed Sprague.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians even have talked about moving Jim Thome back to
third, but he's uncomfortable about it, having grown into a first
baseman at 245 pounds. Top prospect Russell Branyan is striking out
too much at Triple A.
</P>
<P>
   Include second baseman Delino DeShields on the list of players
the Orioles would like to dump, if they can get owner Peter
Angelos' permission. They would rather go with rookie Jerry
Hairston Jr., who has played well when DeShields has been hurt.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies have made everybody but Larry Walker available. That
includes pitcher Darryl Kile and outfielder Dante Bichette. Kile's
big curve has been a bad fit at Coors Field, where the ball doesn't
break sharply because of the altitude. The Rockies are looking for
sinkerball pitchers. The Yankees and Braves could use Bichette.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox also need an outfielder with power. Bichette might
be a possibility, but the Red Sox would prefer Montreal's Rondell
White or Detroit's Bobby Higginson.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets have asked about Montreal pitcher Dustin Hermanson.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland pitcher Kenny Rogers continues to expect a trade,
knowing he won't re-sign with the Athletics next year. Said Rogers,
``I think certain things would be smart for the team to do, but I
don't run things. I like pitching here, but they can't move the
park somewhere closer \Rto his home in Tampa\S. And my family will
be with me next year, no matter what.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates are looking for a veteran catcher to replace Jason
Kendall, and some of the names mentioned are Joe Oliver, Lenny
Webster, Jorge Fabregas and Darrin Fletcher.
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins made a curious decision in trading Matt Mantei, who
has a chance to be an All-Star closer. He was also working cheap.
Why trade him to Arizona for Vladimir Nunez, who couldn't do the
same job for the Diamondbacks, and pitching prospect Brad Penny?
Why go for high-risk potential when the Marlins already had the
real thing?
</P>
<P>
   SPOTLIGHT ON RANDY JOHNSON
</P>
<P>
   Mike Fiala Randy Johnson tied a National League record with 43
strikeouts in three games, but the Diamondbacks' offense has let
him down.
Johnson's strikeout tear gets Arizona no wins
Randy Johnson tied a National League record when he struck out 43
batters over three consecutive games. But he lost all three games
as the Diamondbacks were shut out every time.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's amazing,'' catcher Damian Miller said. ``I've never
seen anything like that. The things that have happened to this team
this year, the things I've seen, are unbelievable. You can't
explain it. It's weird.''
</P>
<P>
   It gets weirder. Yesterday, Johnson pitched against Oakland, and
the Diamondbacks were shut out again, 2-0. In four consecutive
starts, Johnson has no victories and no runs scored for him. He
struck out 11 in seven innings yesterday, boosting his four-game
total to 54.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals pitcher Jose Jimenez started the stretch with a
no-hitter. He also won the rematch with Johnson, 1-0, with a
two-hitter. Cincinnati's Ron Villone and Scott Williamson beat
Johnson with a combined two-hitter in between the two games against
the Cardinals. Tim Hudson and Billy Taylor combined on the shutout
for Oakland yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   That's no runs on six hits over 34 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing I can do about it,'' said Johnson, who still
moved into the NL lead with a 3.03 earned-run average after the
first three losses. ``I just go out there and do the best I can.
There's no satisfaction in strikeouts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No one feels as bad as us hitters,'' infielder Andy Fox said.
``We're just as disappointed as \RJohnson\S is. It's just one of
those messed-up things about baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Dwight Gooden set the National League record for three games
when he whiffed 43 in three games in September 1984 (11, 16 and
16). Nolan Ryan holds the major-league mark of 47, in August 1974
(19, nine and 19).
</P>
<P>
   QUICK HITS
</P>
<P>
   Angels reliever Troy Percival, selected to the All-Star Game,
defended Juan Gonzalez's refusal to play. Said Percival, ``I don't
blame him. Guys who put up the numbers should be one of the top
three guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Tigers manager Larry Parrish, forced to fire pitching coach Rick
Adair, is feeling heat in Detroit. But Parrish, remembering whom
the Tigers almost hired, said, ``The fans are going to look at our
record and say I'm messing up. But if a team doesn't play well _ as
Davey Johnson is experiencing with the Dodgers _ you don't win.''
</P>
<P>
   Mariano Rivera's excuse for missing the All-Star Game?
Apparently he's unhappy with the contractor who is building his
dream home in Panama and wants to deal with the situation
personally.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland is starting to think Jimmy Haynes, 2-0 with a 2.54
earned-run average in his past four starts, is starting to turn
into the No. 1 starter the Athletics have long expected him to be.
With Tim Hudson pitching well and Mark Mulder, last year's No. 1
pick, getting closer, this franchise could turn into a powerhouse
if the new owners can muster enough money to keep their young
talent together.
</P>
<P>
   Braves right-hander John Smoltz is on the disabled list with
more elbow problems. He has had two operations on the elbow since
1994 and said he's considering retiring after his contract expires
in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Trachsel of the Cubs is 0-8 with a 9.41 ERA in his past
nine starts. The team record for a losing streak is 13, set by
Robert McCall in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   Astros interim manager Matt Galante said the Cincinnati Reds are
for real: ``When you see Pokey Reese play the way he's playing,
that's for real. You see \RScott\S Williamson and \RDanny\S Graves
pitch, that's for real. And you've got your mainstays, like
\RBarry\S Larkin _ who's better?''
</P>
<P>
   San Diego pitcher Andy Ashby, who used to pitch for Colorado,
had allowed 15.81 runs per game at Coors Field before his shutout
there Sunday. Said Ashby, ``I have no bad feeling toward the
Rockies. But I thank God every day that they traded me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins gave 16-year-old Venezuelan shortstop Miguel Cabrera
a $1.8 million signing bonus. They say he would have been a high
first-round pick if he had been eligible for the draft, and he
could ease the pain if the Marlins can't sign Spring High pitcher
Josh Beckett, the second overall pick of the draft.
</P>
<P>
   Go figure. The Phillies set a team record with 41 runs scored
(14-1, 21-8 and 6-2) in a three-game sweep of the Cubs last
weekend. Immediately after that, they were blanked by the Brewers'
duo of Jim Abbott and Rafael Roque, who both have ERAs over 5.80.

LOW PAY, WORKLOAD TAKE TOLL ON TEXAS HIGH SCHOOL COACHES
</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Trimble Tech High School head football coach
Gerry Magin could not answer the telephone last week.
</P>
<P>
   He was out on the practice field, laying squares of sod.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the best place to catch him from June to August when
he's not teaching summer school is out on the tractor mowing that
field, in the fieldhouse painting the Bulldogs' locker room or in
the weight room, ensuring it's open to the public this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an unbelievable amount of work to deal with in this
district _ paperwork, taking care of the field, the fieldhouse. We
don't want to come across like we're whining, but it would be nice
to be paid for those extra days,'' said Magin, entering his second
season as the Bulldogs' athletic coordinator, head football coach
and head wrestling coach.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of extra-duty-days' pay and the burden of noncoaching
duties on top of a full course load have combined to make football
coaching in Fort Worth a revolving-door profession. The district
has hired new head coaches for all 12 of its varsity football
programs in the past three years.
</P>
<P>
   Although some of those coaches have been reassigned for reasons
ranging from rules violations to low participation rates and others
have resigned for health or personal reasons, all have expressed
disgruntlement. Finding high-quality coaches or replacing departed
assistants becomes increasingly difficult when most other large
districts offer extra-duty days as compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth athletic director Paul Galvan is attempting to
address the situation. He has submitted a proposal to the school
board to add 10 extra days to the standard 187-day teaching
contract for campus athletic coordinators or head football coaches
and five extra days for all other team sports coaches and their
assistants. Fort Worth school-board trustees are considering the
proposals in the 1999-2000 budget. A public hearing on the budget
is scheduled for Aug. 10, and the trustees will vote on it Aug. 24.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our basketball coaches work during Thanksgiving and Christmas
holidays. Baseball, softball and track \Rcoaches\S work during
spring break. All these programs have additional days,'' Galvan
said. ``We've gotten a lot of support from the superintendent and
the board for improving facilities for the kids. Let's look at
doing something for the people that work the long hours with these
kids.''
</P>
<P>
   School superintendent Dr. Thomas Tocco said he sympathizes with
the coaches and hopes that a board-commissioned study of statewide
salaries and wages will provide objective evidence of
discrepancies. That study, which will analyze the pay structure of
everyone from maintenance workers to assistant principals, should
be completed within eight months, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be the first to admit that if there were sufficient money,
it'd be helpful to have them at a stipend level that is
commensurate with the number of hours and the number of days it
takes to fulfill that responsibility,'' Tocco said. ``As a general
statement, if we are not doing something this year, it's unlikely
that we will be doing it next year because of the tightness of the
budget.''
</P>
<P>
   Football coaches in Fort Worth are paid a $7,241 stipend for the
after-school duties they perform during the duration of their
187-day standard teaching contract. However, they report a minimum
of 10 days early to begin two-a-days in August, and, like Magin,
all are required to work throughout the summer to keep their fields
weeded, mowed and open to the public.
</P>
<P>
   If they worked in Austin, the football coaches wouldn't be
required to mow the fields this summer.
</P>
<P>
   If they coached in Dallas, they might not be teaching a full
course load next fall.
</P>
<P>
   If they coached in any other large district in the state, they'd
be paid for all the extra days they work. \Nsubheds:Reasons for
discontent In discussions with Fort Worth head football coaches,
three key issues emerge that they say makes coaching in the city
difficult and offers from other districts more attractive:
</P>
<P>
   The lack of extra-duty-days' pay. Fort Worth is the only large
school district in the state that does not compensate coaches for
the extra days they work in addition to their stipend.
</P>
<P>
   The extra workload required. Fort Worth coaches are required to
maintain their fields and fieldhouses during the summer months when
they are not covered by their 187-day teaching contract.
</P>
<P>
   The full course load. Fort Worth head football coaches are
typically competing against rural and suburban schools that do not
require their coaches to teach full course loads in addition to
their athletic periods.
</P>
<P>
   As a head football coach in Fort Worth, Magin earns a flat
stipend of $7,241 in addition to his teaching salary. His
assistants receive a stipend of $2,576, which is defined as pay for
after-school responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   A teacher with 20 years of experience, Magin earns $197 per day
over the course of his 187-day teaching contract. With 10
extra-duty days, he would see an increase of close to $2,000 in his
coaching pay. Apart from his teaching schedule, Magin calculates
that for football he works an additional 860 hours per year _
including as many as 40 extra days in the summer _ at a rate of
roughly $8.40 per hour.
</P>
<P>
   He calculates that his assistants work about 550 additional
hours and average around $4.70 per hour.
</P>
<P>
   The McDonald's on Berry Street in Fort Worth is hiring part-time
workers starting at $6.50.
</P>
<P>
   The opportunity for additional income was one reason head
football coaches Billy Hall and Don Morland left Southwest and
Eastern Hills, respectively, in May to become assistants at
programs outside the Fort Worth district.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a pay raise and a smaller course load, but those are
little bitty things,'' Hall said, explaining his move from Class 4A
Southwest to Class 3A Alvarado. ``It's a great opportunity for me
to get back to the kids. In football when you have to do all the
maintenance and the paperwork, you cut down on coach-kid time and
that's what you really love doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Morland left a playoff team with nine returning starters to
become assistant head coach at Azle. In leaving, he cited working
at brand new facilities and not having to complete reams of
administrative paperwork that come with being the head football
coach/athletic coordinator in Fort Worth. \Nsubheds:Statewide
solutions The San Antonio Northside school district is the state's
sixth-largest district, serving approximately 63,000 students with
seven Class 5A high schools, compared with Fort Worth's 78,000
students with 13 high schools and 12 varsity programs.
</P>
<P>
   The Northside board recently passed an athletic department
proposal that restructures the coaching contract away from flat
stipends and toward ``the most equitable system,'' Northside
athletic director Dub Farris said.
</P>
<P>
   The department created a model schedule based on the
UIL-determined seasons for each sport and calculated the number of
extra days needed for each sport, ranging from four to 31. Four
two-hour practice days constitute one extra day, therefore a
football coach would be compensated 10 extra days at minimum for
the 10 weeks of the regular football season. One game day is
considered one extra day, so a volleyball coach would be
compensated for the team playing in a Saturday tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``If their teaching contract says they work 187 days but they
begin practicing before school starts because of UIL rules, they
should be paid for it,'' Farris said. ``I think it's selfish of the
district to think they're going to get people to go out and do
those jobs and not pay them.''
</P>
<P>
   Arlington and Birdville are among area school districts
considering proposals to fund additional days for coaches.
</P>
<P>
   Using a survey of like-sized school systems that was sponsored
by the Texas Association of School Boards, Arlington athletic
director James Hyden found 10 days to be a minimum, while some
districts guarantee pay for as many as 25 extra days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those that are paying 10 are also paying a bigger stipend,''
Hyden said. ``I think it helps you get a more quality coach, and
you don't get the young, real good coach who stays for only three
or four years and then moves for that 10 extra days.''
</P>
<P>
   The Austin school district pays its head football coaches a
$7,248 stipend _ almost identical to Fort Worth _ but Austin
coaches also receive 25 extra days of pay and, starting this
season, they will not have to mow their fields.
</P>
<P>
   Unhappy with the maintenance department's handling of the fields
in the late 1980s, Fort Worth coaches requested campus-based
equipment to mow the fields themselves, making them responsible for
all practice fields at their high schools and feeder middle
schools. If the fields become weed-infested and overgrown during
the summer _ or even during the school year _ coaches receive a
written notice from the district.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to school so I wouldn't have to do any landscaping,''
Ruben Calderon, the Diamond Hill-Jarvis head football and head
basketball coach, said with a laugh. ``It's hard to tell a coach to
be here in the summer to mow a field. What if I have a coach with
another job who is bringing in additional income in the summer?
What do you say to him?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not asking for a raise. We're just asking to be paid for
the work we're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on the 1998-99 compensation schedule, a grounds worker for
the Fort Worth school district can earn a minimum of $7.89 per hour
and a maximum of $13.04. A head football coach's hourly rate falls
on the lower end of that range, but an assistant coach could
consider grounds work as a promotion.
</P>
<P>
   Like other district coaches, Magin's stipend-based $8.40 an hour
is meted out over an additional 40-hour, after-school work week
that encompasses conducting daily two-hour practices; attending
middle school, freshman and junior varsity football games; scouting
films of upcoming opponents; cleaning the toilets after games; and,
of course, mowing the Bulldogs' one field. \Nsubheds:Reduced
teaching load The extra workload is a given in an urban school
district, but it comes on top of the requirement that coaches teach
four 50-minute classes per day in a traditional schedule or three
90-minute classes per day in a block schedule. That doesn't include
duties coaches might assume as the campus athletic coordinator who
is responsible for UIL eligibility forms, daily practice reports
and other documentation for every boys and girls athletic activity
on campus _ all for $1,500 with no extra days.
</P>
<P>
   In Fort Worth, neither campus academic coordinators nor
vocational coordinators are required to teach classes.
</P>
<P>
   To put its coaches on even footing with opponents, the Dallas
school district has proposed removing the campus athletic
coordinator _ typically the head football or boys basketball coach
_ from the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``You study what other districts are doing and their campus
athletic directors are not having to teach classes,'' Dallas
assistant superintendent Troy Mathieu said. ``You don't just want
your kids to participate. You want them to have every opportunity
to reach their potential. We think taking the campus athletic
directors out of the few classes they do have will help bring
better control to the department and make a more efficiently run
campus.''
</P>
<P>
   Wyatt head football coach Anthony Criss believes a reduced
course load would make Fort Worth schools more competitive. The
first Fort Worth school to win a playoff game since 1996, Wyatt was
defeated in the second round last fall by eventual 1998 Class 4A
Division I champion Grapevine.
</P>
<P>
   Wyatt and first-round opponent Dallas South Oak Cliff were the
only two of Grapevine's five playoff opponents whose coaches taught
full course loads.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are expected to compete with those people who are given
more time,'' Criss said. ``Seventy thousand dollars is not going to
make me a better coach, but having eight hours of preparation time
a day vs. three hours of preparation time a day ``will'' make me a
better coach.''
</P>
<P>
   Tocco, meanwhile, said coaches will remain teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every coach must be a teacher,'' he said. ``That is an issue
that will not get resolved any time soon in this system.''
</P>
<P>
   In his second year at Dunbar, head coach Bob Jones was courted
by nationally ranked Clovis West High School in Clovis, Calif. He
turned down the lucrative offer because he wouldn't be able to
bring along his team of assistants, but the offers keep coming for
young, talented coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't spend the extra time, we're behind everybody we
play and we can't be successful,'' Jones said. ``It doesn't become
a big thing until you're not getting paid to be here a month before
school starts.''
</P>
<P>
   Until that time, he and his peers will be out on their tractors,
mowing the fields.

ANGELS WIN FOURTH STRAIGHT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ As outfielders Jim Edmonds and Tim Salmon get closer to
returning to the lineup, the Angels are playing more like the team
many expected them to be when the season began.
</P>
<P>
   They won their fourth in a row Saturday, beating the Colorado
Rockies 9-3 before 48,069 at Coors Field. It was their fourth
consecutive win, their sixth in eight games and their 11th in 17.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, they moved to within 6{ games of first-place
Texas in the AL West, the closest they've been since June 27. They
have a chance to reduce their deficit even more today and head into
the All-Star break on a roll.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels had 13 hits Saturday, giving them 28 in the two games
at Coors Field. Garret Anderson had three hits (including a home
run) for the third game in a row. In the past 13 games, he has six
three-hit games.
</P>
<P>
   Darin Erstad also had three hits and Matt Walbeck had two,
including a two-run triple in the fourth inning that gave the
Angels the lead for good.
</P>
<P>
   Troy Glaus had two hits, including his 15th homer of the season.
He has three homers in the past two games and four in the month of
July.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' Angels manager Terry Collins said when asked
to explain the offensive turnaround. ``We have been swinging better
and we're at Coors Field. You've got to put the ball in play here
and if you do it you're going to get hits.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels were hitting before coming to Colorado, though. In
eight games in July, they are hitting .329 (95 for 289) and
averaging 7.3 runs per game.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels also got another solid outing by starting pitcher
Omar Olivares (8-6), who gave up three runs and six hits in eight
innings coming off a complete game in his last start. Rockies
starter Pedro Astacio (8-8) got the loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to keep competing here,'' said Olivares, who
allowed three runs in the third but worked out of jams in the first
and seventh. ``I got ground balls when I needed them and double
plays when I needed them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough for everybody to pitch here. But I was able to hit
the corners and spot the ball where I wanted. Usually when you have
control you're successful.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I always knew he could pitch, but he's pitched as good as I've
ever seen him _ and I've seen him pitch for a long time,'' Collins
said. ``I've seen his sinker better, but his pitch selection and
location are better now.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson got the Angels started with a home run (No.13) leading
off the second inning. He has his average up to .293, the highest
it's been in more than a month (.296 on June 7).
</P>
<P>
   But he says his confidence isn't any higher than it always is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't hit on confidence,'' he said. ``I hit on being a
hitter. Going up and having a plan and letting the chips fall where
they may. Otherwise, you have (ups and downs). I try to stay on an
even keel.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels' season hasn't been anything but steady, but they are
happy with their current direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to get back (to .500) to start,'' Collins said.
``Until then, we've just got to keep playing. We can't worry about
anything but what we're doing.''

EDMONDS' REHAB SPEEDS UP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Jim Edmonds continues to surprise everybody with his
rapid recovery from shoulder surgery, and after initially expected
to be out until mid-August, he could be back before the end of the
month.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, Edmonds will take batting practice off live pitching
along with Tim Salmon (sprained left wrist) provided their are no
setbacks.
</P>
<P>
   A rehab assignment would follow and probably last about a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel better than I ever expected to be (at this point),''
Edmonds said. ``(Friday) I was swinging (off a tee) as hard as I
could. I think I surprised them.''
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds credits his rapid recovery to the aggressive rehab work
he did with Dr. David Bradley at Newport Physical Therapy in
Newport Beach. And it helps that the shoulder involved is his
right, non-throwing shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing I'm concerned about is my swing... and running
into walls,'' Edmonds said.
</P>
<P>
   In other injury updates:
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher Jack McDowell, recovering from elbow surgery Feb. 2,
made his second rehab appearance Saturday for Triple-A Edmonton
against Oklahoma. He gave up a three-run homer among six hits in
six innings.
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher Ken Hill (inflamed right elbow) threw for 20 minutes
Saturday and felt ``diminished pain'' according to manager Terry
Collins. He's eligible to come off he disabled list July 16, but he
isn't expected to return to the rotation by then. He's scheduled to
throw again next Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Glaus supporter: Troy Glaus hit only .130 in May and .227 in
June, but never was in danger of being sent to the minors _ unlike
Todd Greene _ because of his defense.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, he's hitting .236 with 15 homers and 40 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``You tell me who we have in this locker room who can hit like
he's hit and who can play third and catch the ball like he has,''
Collins said. ``You find me someone who can do that, and I'll send
(Glaus) to the minors.''
</P>
<P>
   Glaus is beginning to hit again, much like he did in April when
he was at .341 with five homers and 16 RBI. In his first eight
games in July, Glaus is hitting .300 with four homers and 10 RBI.
He hit two homers Friday night against the Rockies and another
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've hit some balls hard that have been caught and hit some
soft that were hits,'' Glaus said. ``I'm contributing to the team
winning, which is all I can ask for.''
</P>
<P>
   Even during the tough times, Glaus said he never doubted his
ability to snap out of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was always a light at the end of the tunnel,'' he said.
``You put in time, effort and work, you'll have change. That was
all I could do. Even with a 0-for-4, if I'm prepared I know I did
all I could do that day.''

BELTRE'S HIT IN NINTH LIFTS DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The showdown between Kevin Brown and Ken Griffey,
Jr. was a dud Saturday night, and the Dodgers could not have been
happier.
</P>
<P>
   Two strikeouts, one pop out, and no drama. Just the way the
Dodgers wanted it as they sought their first three-game winning
streak in three months.
</P>
<P>
   They got it, but not until the bottom of the ninth, when Adrian
Beltre's RBI single gave the Dodgers a 2-1 victory over the Seattle
Mariners in front of 50,813 at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Beltre, who made a brilliant defensive play on a bunt attempt in
the eighth inning, blooped a base hit off Jose Paniagua (6-8) over
the head of shortstop Alex Rodriguez that scored Devon White.
</P>
<P>
   It made a winner of closer Jeff Shaw (2-2), who took over for
Brown to start the ninth inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers thought Brown, who allowed just two hits, might get
his first victory in three starts after he was lifted for pinch
hitter Dave Hansen to open the eighth against Mariners reliever
Jose Paniaqua.
</P>
<P>
   Hensen singled and moved to second on a sacrifice. He was lifted
for pinch runner Trenidad Hubbard, and the Dodgers had runners at
first and second after Eric Young walked.
</P>
<P>
   With Mark Grudzielanek at the plate, Hubbard took off for third.
He had the base stolen, but his momentum carried him off the bag
after a pop-up slide and third baseman Charles Gipson applied the
tag.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers manager Davey Johnson argued, but replays supported
third base umpire Gerry Davis. Grudzielanek, the home run hero of
Friday's victory, grounded to short to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners had a chance to win it in the ninth against Shaw,
who allowed a leadoff single to Brian Hunter. David Bell popped
out, bringing Griffey to the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw struck him out, the sixth time in two games Griffey went
down on strikes. Shaw walked the next batter, Rodriguez, but got
out of the inning when David Segui lined to right.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, whose poor showing in his two previous starts probably
cost him a spot on the National League All-Star team, walked one
and struck out seven. He gave up a home run to David Segui with one
out in the second inning, then walked the next batter Butch Huskey.
But he retired 20 of the next 21 batters and allowed the Dodgers to
stay close.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who cut his ERA from 3.67 to 3.53, didn't get much
support. The Dodgers had a runner on base in each of the first four
innings against Mariners starter John Halama, who entered the game
4-2 overall and 4-0 as a starter.
</P>
<P>
   But Halama, acquired last July in the big Randy Johnson trade,
was almost as stingy as Brown. The Dodgers didn't score until the
fourth when Eric Karros doubled and later scored on a sacrifice fly
by slumping Raul Mondesi, who had just two RBI in his last seven
games.
</P>
<P>
   Halama allowed just one base runner in his final three innings,
when Karros reached on a fielding error by Gipson with two outs in
the sixth. But Karros was picked off to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Karros returned to the lineup after being given Friday off by
Johnson. All the Dodgers' top players have been rested in an effort
to shake things up, but the move surprised Karros after hitting two
homers Thursday in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a much different philosophy from the managers in the
past,'' said Karros, who is batting .367 in his last 16 games.
``But put it this way, it's easy to understand when things aren't
going well.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown's biggest concern was getting himself back on track. He
was coming off two of his poorer starts with the Dodgers, allowing
15 runs in 12 2/3 innings to the Giants and Padres.
</P>
<P>
   Most pitchers throw on the side once between starts. But since
Monday's 8-4 loss at Coors Field, Brown has thrown twice in an
attempt to smooth his mechanics. His last session went 45 minutes,
about three times longer than usual.
</P>
<P>
   Brown even had catcher Todd Hundley stand in the left-handed
batter's box and critique his pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kevin is a perfectionist,'' said pitching coach Claude Osteen,
who had the same role at Texas in 1993-94 when Brown pitched for
the Rangers. ``The velocity is going to be there, but when you're
off just a little the hitters will make you pay. He is taking the
team's struggles very personally. He knows only one way to make it
stop.''

OSTEEN: DREIFORT MAKING PROGRESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Darren Dreifort, making his 17th and final start
of the first half today against Seattle, is showing signs of
improvement, says pitching coach Claude Osteen.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to tell from his 6-8 record and 5.79 ERA. But in his
last four starts, Dreifort has an ERA of 3.90 (11 earned runs,
251/3 innings pitches) even though he is 1-3. Dreifort also has
shown better control, walking two batters in his last two starts
and seven in his last four. In his third start of the year,
Dreifort walked nine.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't just look at the numbers, you'll see he is
becoming more of a pitcher,'' Osteen said. ``He's been working on a
changeup and is getting better with it. He used to use his slider
as his offspeed pitch. It was a good pitch for him and it's hard to
go away from. But now he has another option.''
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort allowed five runs and nine hits in last Tuesday's 5-2
loss at Colorado. He left after giving up three singles that
resulted in two runs in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort has left many people wondering when he will stop being
known as a ``kid pitcher.'' He was drafted in 1993 and is a year
older than more established starters Chan Ho Park and Ismael
Valdes.
</P>
<P>
   But there was elbow surgery and a long debate on whether he
should start or relieve. He had great movement on his fastball, but
it never seemed to work to his advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's OK for a closer or setup man,'' Osteen said. ``But for
a starter, hitters will make you throw strikes. Darren is learning
that now.''
</P>
<P>
   !arrow!Roar of the crowd:!off! A night after hitting a three-run
homer, recording a career-high four RBI and making a run-saving
diving catch, shortstop Mark Grudzielanek was still on a roll.
</P>
<P>
   In his first at-bat, Grudzielanek singled to give him eight hits
in 15 at-bats since coming off the disabled list. And for the first
time since joining the Dodgers last July 31, Grudzielanek received
a lift from the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard the cheers and I really appreciate it,'' said
Grudzielanek, who batted second Saturday after leading off on
Friday. ``With this season there hasn't been a lot to cheer, but
it's nice to know they recognize the effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Grudzielanek, who once hit 54 doubles in a season for Montreal,
never has had an offensive presence with the Dodgers. He admits
that has been frustrating, but thinks his time on the DL (broken
right hand) has helped his game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It enabled me to take a step back and re-evaluate,'' he said.
``It made me realize that maybe I have to relax more. I haven't hit
here like I hit there and that has been difficult. I've always been
aggressive at the plate, but that hurt me. I wanted to do well and
started swinging at bad pitches. The time off has allowed me to
take a step back.''
</P>
<P>
   Quick hits: Antonio Osuna (elbow) reported no discomfort after
throwing 12/3 innings Friday in a rehab outing at Single-A San
Bernardino. The club will have Osuna throw today and Tuesday for
San Bernardino and hopes to activate him for Thursday's series
opener against the Angels. . . . Today's Seattle starter, Jeff
Fassero, might be coming off eight shutout innings against the
Angels, but he is the sixth pitcher in major-league history to
allow as many as 27 home runs before the All-Star break. Twice in
his career, Bert Blyleven gave up 30 homers before the break (1986
and 1987). Phil Niekro gave up 29 (1970), as did Ferguson Jenkins
(1973). Catfish Hunter was touched for 27 homers (1973). Back in
1957, Washington Senators left-hander Pedro Ramos gave up 27.

DEFENDING VERMONT'S VIRTUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Vermont'' on the label sells the product _ even if the product
is made in Japan. So it goes with ``Vermont Curry,'' which, loaded
with apples and honey though it may be, comes from a factory way
east of Montpelier.
</P>
<P>
   Crafty marketers have also pushed ``Vermont Maple Orchards''
syrup from a factory in Canada, packets of Vermont flower seeds out
of Louisiana, and a cologne called ``Vermontage'' that's made in
New Jersey. (They couldn't call it ``Essence of Bayonne''?)
</P>
<P>
   Vermont is right to get cranky about this, although state
officials may have a tough time proving consumer fraud in the
courts. Still, their effort to strengthen state regulations
regarding misleading labeling sends a much needed message to the
world of commerce: Don't sell what isn't yours.
</P>
<P>
   Ignoring that message could cost a company a $10,000 fine in
Vermont and a load of bad publicity.
</P>
<P>
   Advertising has always stretched the truth, selling the image of
a glamorous life in a lipstick tube or athletic prowess in a soft
drink can. But such nonsense passes as fantasy, with the poetic
license of the huckster allowing for ad copy that promises, say,
``that fresh Vermont feeling,'' or an experience ``just like a trip
to the Green Mountains.''
</P>
<P>
   Deliberately trying to trick the public is something else, and
indicating that a product is ``Vermont made'' when it isn't crosses
what should be a clear ethical line.
</P>
<P>
   The consumer has a responsibility here too: to read the fine
print, usually on the back, way down at the bottom, where the
manufacturer's address can be found.
</P>
<P>
   This bogus selling of Vermont is, of course, a backhanded
compliment to the state that is embedded in the national
consciousness as the home of all things wholesome. What the
usurpers don't realize _ or maybe they don't care _ is that they
destroy a little piece of the public's trust in Vermont's virtue
every time they misrepresent it.

ADVICE FOR ARAFAT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Monday, July 12, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Strengthening Palestinian Institutions,'' a task force report
sponsored by the Council on Foreign Relations, comes at an
opportune time, offering Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority
politely worded criticisms and recommendations that deserve to be
heeded.
</P>
<P>
   With a new Israeli government under Ehud Barak preparing for
final-status negotiations that will probably lead to a state for
Palestinians, there is a crying need to evaluate the
``shortcomings'' of Arafat's administration. The report outlines
the reforms that must be made if Palestinian independence is to
improve the lives of Palestinians, enhance regional security, and
assure international donors that their money is well spent.
</P>
<P>
   The report acknowledges that during the interim period mandated
by the 1993 Oslo accords, the Palestinian Authority has had to
contend with difficult conditions. It has ``lacked undisputed
control over key resources such as land, water, and contiguous
territory, exclusive jurisdiction of its legal and administrative
systems over its population, and unfettered access to external
markets.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the Palestinian Authority has a long way to go to
achieve the ``good governance'' the task force identifies as the
indispensable foundation for fruitful independence.
</P>
<P>
   The building blocks of good governance that the report commends
to Arafat's regime are: constitutional government; political
accountability and judicial review; accountable management of
revenues; rule of law and citizens' rights; democratic
participatory politics and pluralist civic society; and effective
and responsive public administration.
</P>
<P>
   This is a full plate of reforms. They are desired not merely by
well-meaning dignitaries from abroad but also by Palestinians.
Indeed, the Palestinian specialists who wrote the report were more
critical of Arafat's failings than were the foreign notables on the
task force. They and their compatriots want and need decentralized
power and honest administration _ a state molded for the age of the
Internet, not for the caprices of a revolutionary or a village
chieftain.

 McCAIN'S CHALLENGE TO THE SYSTEM  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In his valiant effort to turn campaign finance reform into a
pivotal issue for the presidential candidates, Senator John McCain
of Arizona is traveling a difficult road but one that could prove
beneficial to him and the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The central problem is that while a great many Americans share
McCain's view that the system is corrupting and needs radical
reform, few voters embrace electoral reform as a decisive issue.
Most are skeptical that real change will ever occur. They might
agree on reform but still vote for someone else.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, a Republican, has a well-earned reputation for
challenging the common wisdom. He has recently begun to raise the
salience of campaign finance reform by pointing out how it affects
individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Telephone bills and other communication costs are higher for
consumers, he said recently, because when the Telecommunications
Act of 1996 was written, ``every company affected by the
legislation had purchased a seat at the table with soft money.''
And special-interest tax breaks soak up money that should go to
larger tax cuts for individuals, he said.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a lofty debate about morals but a tough lesson in
real costs, and McCain is on the right path.
</P>
<P>
   There have been times when this strategy has worked. After the
1980 Ward Commission report said parts of state government in
Massachusetts had essentially been for sale to politicians' cronies
and campaign contributors, Michael Dukakis armed his 1982 comeback
campaign for governor with an ad about the ``corruption tax.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You see,'' said the announcer, ``corruption is the worst kind
of tax because you pay and pay and get nothing in return. . . . The
Ward Commission says corrupt politicians have taken billions from
Massachusetts taxpayers.'' Dukakis won that election comfortably,
helped by an enormous turnout.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said last week he is particularly frustrated that young
people ``have figured out that they're no longer represented.''
McCain's theme should give them reason not to lose faith in the
American democratic process.

KIBITZING ON JERUSALEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   All politicians pander at one time or another, so Hillary
Clinton's assurance to the president of the Union of Orthodox
Jewish Congregations of America that Jerusalem is the ``eternal and
indivisible capital of Israel'' and that the US Embassy should move
as soon as possible from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem may simply be the
telltale sign that she has finally decided to turn pro as a
politician.
</P>
<P>
   In her compulsion to say precisely what a sector of the New York
electorate wants to hear, Clinton is no worse than other pols who
have pronounced the same pandering phrases. What sets her version
apart is the piquancy of a first lady contradicting her husband and
his administration's prudent policy _ that the political status of
Jerusalem is to be decided in final-status negotiations between
Israel and the Palestinians and should not be prejudged by any
symbolic American gesture.
</P>
<P>
   In the Middle East there is no doubt that whatever formula the
two parties agree upon, Jerusalem will be Israel's capital. The
challenge facing the negotiators will be to devise an arrangement
that allows both Israel and the Palestinians to claim a capital in
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   This is doable, and if Israel's new prime minister, Ehud Barak,
can accomplish what he has set out to accomplish, it will be done.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to Barak's task of negotiating an accord on
Jerusalem that satisfies both peoples, Hillary Clinton's opinion is
just so much kibitzing. She was trying to compensate for having
said last year that it is ``in the long-term interests of the
Middle East for Palestine to be a state.'' To political
consultants, this was a flagrant no-no. Never mind that as obdurate
a hawk as Ariel Sharon has said that a Palestinian state is
inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   But all sides make fools of themselves on this issue. James
Zogby of the Arab American Institute said: ``Those in the Jewish
community pressuring politicians to take such positions are
damaging the search for peace and damaging American interests and
American leadership.'' This is hyperbolic nonsense.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, most of these parochial posturings have no effect in
the Middle East.

DODGERS WIN ON BELTRE'S HIT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A hero was emerging in the late innings Saturday
night and it wasn't Kevin Brown or Ken Griffey, Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Brown was gone and Griffey shut down by the time Adrian Beltre
stepped to the plate with two outs in the ninth inning and the
winning run at second.
</P>
<P>
   His single gave the Dodgers a 2-1 victory over the Seattle
Mariners that marked the club's first three-game winning streak in
more than two months.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to me that the team looks to me in situations
like that,'' Beltre said. ``We can't expect (Gary) Sheffield or
Raul Mondesi to do it for us every night. If we are going to pull
out of this thing, everybody has to contribute.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Dodgers, Beltre's single was the play of the night,
giving Jeff Shaw (2-2) the victory after Brown limited the Mariners
to two hits in eight innings. But it was Beltre's amazing
off-balance throw from third on an eighth-inning bunt by Charles
Gipson that stirred the Dodger Stadium crowd of 50,813 and truly
showed the depth of his talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is just playing with so much confidence right now,'' second
baseman Eric Young said of Beltre, who is batting .302 in his last
11 games. ``You can just see it in the way he carries himself right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown didn't seem to mind the no decision just as long as the
team got the victory. He twice struck out Griffey, who fanned six
times in the first two games of the series.
</P>
<P>
   Brown didn't think he pitched much better than his last outing,
when he allowed six runs in 62/3 innings against Colorado. This
time, he only gave up a home run to David Segui in the second and a
one-out double to Tom Lampkin in the fifth. Brown retired 20 of the
final 21 batters he faced.
</P>
<P>
   ``A game like this is proof what can happen when you make good
pitches and get a few breaks,'' said Brown, who walked one and
struck out seven. ``It also shows what we are capable of in the
second half. There is no need to look back on what already has
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers (38-47) still are 11 games behind San Francisco in
the National League West. But a victory today in the final game
before the All-Star break and a Colorado loss to the Angels could
pull the Dodgers even with the Rockies and out of fifth place for
the first time in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners had a chance to win it in the ninth against Shaw,
who allowed a leadoff single to Brian Hunter. David Bell popped
out, bringing Griffey to the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw struck him out but walked the next batter, Alex Rodriguez.
He retired Segui on a liner to Mondesi in right that ended the
inning.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi, who has hit just one homer in his last 132 at-bats,
also played a critical role in the ninth. Although he is not
hitting, Mondesi's walk off Jose Paniagua (6-8) moved Devon White
to second and set up Beltre's winning single.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that was a key at-bat in the inning,'' Shaw said.
``Mondy hasn't been hitting for power, but he showed great patience
there. It paid off and put the winning run in a position to
score.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, whose poor showing in his two previous starts probably
cost him a spot on the National League All-Star team, cut his ERA
from 3.67 to 3.53, but didn't get much support. The Dodgers had a
runner on in each of the first four innings against Mariners
starter John Halama, who entered the game 4-2 overall and 4-0 as a
starter.
</P>
<P>
   But Halama, acquired last July in the big Randy Johnson trade,
was almost as stingy as Brown. The Dodgers scored their only other
run in the fourth when Eric Karros doubled and scored on a
sacrifice fly by Mondesi, who had just two RBI in his last seven
games.
</P>
<P>
   Most pitchers throw on the side once between starts. But since
Monday's 8-4 loss at Coors Field, Brown has thrown twice in an
attempt to smooth his mechanics. His last session went 45 minutes,
about three times longer than usual.
</P>
<P>
   Brown even had catcher Todd Hundley stand in the left-handed
batter's box and critique his pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kevin is a perfectionist,'' said pitching coach Claude Osteen,
who had the same role at Texas in 1993-94 when Brown pitched for
the Rangers. ``The velocity is going to be there, but when you're
off just a little the hitters will make you pay. He is taking the
team's struggles very personally. He knows only one way to make it
stop.'' &QL;

 &HT;    WATCHDOGS IN GOVERNMENT ARE HEARD BUT OFTEN IGNORED
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Inside almost every agency of the federal
government, outposts from an army of roughly 15,000 workers have a
mission to search and expose ways that taxpayers' money is
squandered.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators, auditors, inspectors general and congressional
overseers, at a cost of about $2 billion from the $1.7 trillion
budget, churn out their warnings of federal waste, abuse and fraud.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not clear who is listening and responding, especially
at a time when deficits are turning into surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, some reforms follow, but often only after hundreds
of millions of dollars have already found their way down various
rat holes.
</P>
<P>
   Among long-festering problems that have resurfaced in recent
weeks:
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department and one of its contractors, Westinghouse,
spent a decade and nearly a half-billion dollars before deciding
last year that a chemical process for removing radioactive waste
from its Savannah River site near Aiken, S.C., was unworkable.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than safely separating the most concentrated waste, now
kept in underground storage tanks, the process produced explosive,
toxic benzene.
</P>
<P>
   Westinghouse is now working on an alternative method that would
cost up to $3.5 billion and which would not be in operation until
at least 2007. What's more, if that system doesn't work, the cost
could soar to $75 billion. That would equal all of federal aid to
elementary and secondary schools for five years.
</P>
<P>
   If this seems shocking to some, it is not to Victor S. Rezendes,
who directs studies of the Energy Department for the General
Accounting Office (GAO), a 3,300-person agency which is the
investigative arm of Congress and the largest single watchdog
agency in the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a surprise,'' Rezendes said last week of the
Savannah waste program, as he cited the history of the project.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent post-mortem of the Savannah River situation, the
General Accounting Office reviewed the history, which included
numerous warnings from an inspecting team from the agency starting
in the early 1990s, followed by a GAO report raising questions, as
well as critical reports from the Energy Department's inspector
general.
</P>
<P>
   In its response, the department has acknowledged ``weaknesses''
in its management and agreed to changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some reforms have been made,'' said Rezendes. ``But they are
not always effectively implemented.''
</P>
<P>
   _ At the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD),
officials have turned the throttle up on loans to rehabilitate
housing, despite repeated warnings that growing defaults could
threaten its $3.6 billion loan insurance fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``HUD is not adequately overseeing key aspects'' of the program,
said the GAO in a report last month that's the latest of a string
of critical federal reviews over four years. The accounting office
said that the regional ``Homeownership Centers'' in Atlanta,
Denver, Philadelphia and Santa Ana, Calif., were not properly
overseeing the loans and that some inspectors hired to oversee the
repairs have approved shoddy or incomplete work.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a similar report from the Housing Department's inspector
general two years ago, few changes have been made in the program,
which increased by eightfold in four years. HUD has disputed much
of the criticism. In its response to the GAO, the department called
the rehab program ``inherently riskier'' than other loan programs.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Pentagon has been under fire since 1970 for losing track
of vast amounts of property that it ships around the world. A GAO
report issued this month found the Defense Department had no
records for $2.7 billion worth of excess equipment shipped for
disposal last year.
</P>
<P>
   The poor record-keeping is especially wasteful, the accounting
office has reported, because useful items are sometimes destroyed
as surplus. An audit two years ago, for example, found that the
Army could have saved $200,000 by using Cobra helicopter parts that
were scheduled to be destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the apparent lack of progress, GAO spokesman Cleve
Corlett argued that such recommendations do pay off eventually.
</P>
<P>
   ``About three-fourths of our recommendations are implemented
within four years,'' Corlett said. His agency has claimed
responsibility for $19.7 billion in financial improvements last
year, which the GAO calculates as either saving money or putting
funds to better use.
</P>
<P>
   Those improvements represent $49 for every $1 that the General
Accounting Office spent over the past five years, Corlett said.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Rezendes acknowledged that progress can be glacial. He
noted that from 1980 through 1996, the Department of Energy had 80
major projects costing over $100 million, but it completed only 15,
most of them behind schedule and over budget. Thirty-one of the
projects were cancelled after expenditures of more than $10
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was discouraged that agencies do not reform their
ways, he said wryly, ``That's how we make our living.''

 &HT;    Bush turns to Iowa for first votes
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ He's wooed the money and wowed the pollsters.
Now, front-runner George W. Bush goes to work to win votes from the
first people to cast ballots in the GOP presidential derby.
</P>
<P>
   Bush will campaign this week in eight cities in Iowa, where next
month's Republican straw poll could make or break some candidates,
even though the poll is more symbolic than substantive.
</P>
<P>
   For Bush, the Aug. 14 balloting offers a first test of his
middle-of-the-Republican-road effort to win the nomination of a
party heavy on social conservatives, including Iowa Christian
Coalition members who are mobilizing to play a big role.
</P>
<P>
   Though he does not mention names, Craig Bergman, the group's
executive director, makes it clear that Bush is not the Christian
Coalition's kind of candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion, he said, remains ``a key factor among our
constituency.'' A ``supermajority'' of Iowa Christian Coalition
members, according to Bergman, wants a presidential candidate who
pledges to pick an anti-abortion running mate and appoint judges
who share that view. Bush has declined to make such a pledge. He
opposes abortion but says he would not work for a constitutional
amendment banning it because there is no public consensus on the
issue.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush is working Iowa on Thursday and Friday, Bergman's
organization will be working to connect its 15,000 members with the
presidential candidates they support. A survey will produce lists
that the group will share with the candidates, along with a
suggestion that the candidate transport those supporters to Ames
and pay the $25 cost of casting a straw vote.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush camp, predicting he will run first in the straw poll
despite a late start, does not believes it has anything to fear
from the Christian Coalition effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are getting a lot of support from Christian Coalition
members,'' said Bush spokesman David Beckwith. ``And in Iowa the
Christian Coalition is a force. We're in contact with them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Christian Coalition has flexed its political muscle at past
Iowa straw polls. In 1987, Pat Robertson won the poll and later
finished second in the 1988 Iowa GOP presidential caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   Several GOP candidates _ including Dan Quayle, Gary Bauer, Pat
Buchanan, Alan Keyes and Steve Forbes _ want to be this year's
candidate for social conservatives. Bergman said Christian
Coalition members would like to see that field narrowed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are too many people in the race, and some of the lesser
qualified individuals should do the honorable thing after the straw
poll and join another campaign or go home,'' said Bergman, citing a
sentiment he said he frequently hears.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates expected to drop out after straw poll
</P>
<P>
   Odds also are good that the straw poll will shrink the field.
Candidates who already have had trouble raising money will find
that task even more difficult after an also-ran showing in Ames.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the straw poll is the show it is. The poll is
actually a fund-raiser for the Iowa Republican Party. Candidates
set up booths at the Ames coliseum to hawk their message and
memorabilia to anyone who pays $25 (or finds a candidate to pay the
$25 for them) to cast a ballot. There are few rules, and the
campaigns spend considerable effort lining up ``voters'' _ luring
them with free transportation, free entertainment and free food.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush team is negotiating with several country music stars.
Lamar Alexander's party will feature Crystal Gayle. ``It's as close
as you get to a political carnival,'' says Iowa political scientist
Arthur Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Beckwith said the event has become, thanks to Iowa GOP
self-promotion and media attention, a ``key test of determination
and organization.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And we're starting late. We have enormous popular support in
the state and our supporters are eager to compete and we're
determined to back them,'' he said. ``This isn't a caucus. A caucus
is bad enough. You sit there for four hours in the fire station.
This is give-up-an-entire-Saturday in the middle of summer.''
</P>
<P>
   And for some GOP candidates, it could become a
give-up-your-White-House dreams Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Not a single delegate will be at stake in Ames, but Miller
believes the event will narrow the field, perhaps to as few as one.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he wins big in that straw poll, that may be the end of the
contest right there,'' he said of Bush. ``Everything may be over.''
</P>
<P>
   And even if it isn't, it could be for some contenders. Among
those in harm's way is Alexander, who has campaign chairs in all 99
Iowa counties and former four-term Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad on his
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot is at stake for a lot of us,'' Alexander said last week
in Des Moines. ``I plan on making a stellar showing.''
</P>
<P>
   But he also wants the straw poll stakes to be high for Bush, who
has said he is in it to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything outside of a landslide for Bush is a big loss,'' said
Alexander spokesman Brian Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone wants to play
</P>
<P>
   The straw poll does not necessarily offer a sure forecast of
what will happen at Iowa's first-in-the-nation February caucuses.
Four years ago, Bob Dole and Phil Gramm each got 24 percent of the
straw-poll votes, putting them atop a 10-man field. By February,
Dole ran first and Gramm was a campaign-killing fifth with 9
percent. Gramm's strong straw poll showing was buoyed by his
successful effort to get non-Iowans to Ames, a ballot-stuffing game
played by several candidates.
</P>
<P>
   This year, new rules: Straw voters will have to prove they are
Iowans.
</P>
<P>
   Not all candidates are sure they want to play. Arizona Sen. John
McCain has declined to participate. Elizabeth Dole is unsure at
what level she will play.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to keep our powder dry before making any public
comment about resources we will devote to this straw poll,'' said
Dole spokesman Ari Fleischer. ``To be a meaningful election it
ought to be a fair fight not tilted by massive infusions from
checkbooks.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes and Bush, the candidates with the most money, won't say
how much they will spend on the straw poll. Last week, both
campaigns bid for the best rally site outside the coliseum where
the straw vote will take place. Bush won at a previously unheard-of
$43,500. ``The whole idea of raising this money is so that we can
be competitive with anybody,'' said Beckwith, whose candidate has
more than $36 million in the bank. Forbes has raised more than $3
million, but has millions of his own money to spend _ and has shown
a willingness to do so in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Said Forbes operative Bob Haus, ``You could spend millions on
this thing if you aren't careful.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is going to throw a big party to say thanks to
people who come down to spend a sweaty day in Ames in August,''
Haus said.

 &HT;    Is Georgia asleep in the forest?
 &HT;    By Martha Ezzard
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Congress acts in sneaky ways sometimes _ even
anti-democratic ways.
</P>
<P>
   An amendment, never aired or debated publicly, slithered through
the back door of a Senate Appropriations bill recently. It read
like legal gobbledy-gook, but its impact is pretty simple: It
affects whether our grandchildren will ever catch a native brook
trout or see a rare wildflower in the Chattahoochee National
Forest.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody in Georgia's congressional delegation needs to raise a
fuss about it. Here's what happened:
</P>
<P>
   In Sierra v. Martin, the U.S. Court of Appeals in Atlanta halted
seven logging projects in the Chattahoochee forest. The U.S. Forest
Service didn't follow its own rule, the court said, which requires
site-specific inventories of certain wildlife populations before
timber sales are approved. It's designed to assure that the rarest
wildlife don't become endangered. District officials also ignored
their 15-year-old management plan, which calls for a survey of
sensitive species. The Forest Service admitted that threatened
wildlife live in the proposed logging areas, and the agency didn't
appeal the court's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Now some lawmakers want to void that court decision and make the
inventories optional for all national forests. A spokesman for
Forest Service Chief Mike Dombeck says the Clinton administration
strongly opposes the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed Dunaway Gap timber sale in northwest Georgia is an
example of why the site inventory makes sense. The Forest Service
said logging there would cause 30 tons of sediment to flow into the
East Armuchee Creek, the habitat for threatened mussels. Still,
there was no checking on the mussels. Officials said mussels (SET
ITAL)could(END ITAL) exist in other parts of the forest, so it
wasn't necessary. That's a little like telling your children rare
songbirds are probably (SET ITAL)somewhere(END ITAL) _ so don't
worry that you can't hear any.
</P>
<P>
   The suit was brought by several local and national environmental
groups, among which only the Sierra Club opposes timber sales on
forest lands. ``We don't want to shut logging down,'' said Bob
Kibler, a retired neurosurgeon who is president of the 1,000-member
Georgia Forest Watch. But the citizen groups are frustrated by
Washington's back-door tactic.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Alexander, chairman of the Rabun County Coalition, contacted
Georgia's U.S. senators, Paul Coverdell and Max Cleland, to ask
them to remove the amendment when the bill comes to the Senate
floor. Alexander hasn't heard back from either of them.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell recently voted against a bill to stop taxpayer
subsidies for logging roads, so if he comes to the rescue of the
Chattahoochee forest, it would be a pleasant surprise. Coverdell
received $47,000 last year from timber-related industries, and
Cleland received $6,000. But Coverdell has supported the GOP push
for using real scientific data as the basis for environmental
decisions, which is what the surveys provide.
</P>
<P>
   Chattahoochee forest supervisor George Martin said he is not
allowed to lobby Congress, but he says he's trying to rewrite the
district plan to eliminate the site-specific inventories.
</P>
<P>
   He says other tools, such as ``habitat analysis,'' will do just
as well. Budget cuts won't allow his staff to do total inventories,
he claimed _ although the court's opinion doesn't say anything
about counting all the critters in the forest.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia has only one representative on the House Appropriations
Committee, where a similar amendment is being prepared. Republican
Rep. Jack Kingston received more timber industry PAC money last
year than anyone else in the current Georgia House delegation _ but
that doesn't mean he won't support giving Georgians a say on policy
that affects our forest so directly.
</P>
<P>
   Here's hoping he will.

 &HT;    Texas created these schools with `let 'em picnic' attitude
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ The way Texas has administered charter schools in
their infancy, it's easy to get the notion that public education is
a clambake. You just heat up the coals and hand out the clams.
</P>
<P>
   The Emma L. Harrison Charter School was handed roughly $850,000
_ that's some shells. The costly disaster now stands as a monument
to the ``educational entrepreneurship'' touted by Gov. George W.
Bush on the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison is the first operating charter to have its charter
revoked. Bush is correct that Texas has success stories to tell
about charter schools, but this success appears to be more by
happenstance than design. Texas sauntered into this arena with
precious little design.
</P>
<P>
   Observers without rose-colored shades say that lack of state
oversight has other charter schools tiptoeing on insolvency's ridge
while doing some of the same things that got Harrison shut down.
</P>
<P>
   A postscript to last week's decision on Harrison was that the
Texas Education Agency announced it would hire six additional
staffers to monitor the 168 charter schools authorized in this
Texas boot scoot. Six warm bodies roughly quadruples TEA's
charter-school division.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the blame is not the state's alone. Harrison
officials' attempts to shed blame are pathetic. They flagrantly
abused the public trust and the intent of charter dollars, which
weren't to be used on building needs but on students. Teachers
missed paychecks. Unemployment and retirement system funds weren't
paid. Funds were co-mingled with those of the East Waco Community
Center. The school ran up a debt approaching $400,000. The charter
board operated below radar. The school refused to let the public
see records, ask questions, observe official actions.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of this charter school, we are left to reflect on
some of the destructive bromides of those who wonder aloud about
blowing up our public schools and starting all over again.
</P>
<P>
   Let's create charters. Let's remove all those bureaucratic
controls. Accountability? They'll take TAAS. That'll do it. And,
while we're at it, why not invite private and church schools to the
clambake through vouchers? At least Texas has refrained from the
latter for another legislative session.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, let's all decry bureaucracy and state oversight. Who
campaigns as pro-bureaucracy? Off with bureaucrats' heads, we say.
</P>
<P>
   Well, you know what the Emma L. Harrison Charter School was? A
school without bureaucracy or state oversight.
</P>
<P>
   The experience of the Harrison charter school tracks some of
those with privatized state services _ privatization being just
about as easy a sell these days as shaved ice.
</P>
<P>
   So we privatize. And when the private company carrying out the
public bidding fields questions about doing something questionable
with public dollars, it says, ``None of your business. That's
proprietary.''
</P>
<P>
   Adventures in charters and privatization both should remind us
of the necessity to have checks and balances, and public oversight,
and, arghhh, bureaucracy. Because you know what? The most clumsy,
burdensome bureaucracy is us.
</P>
<P>
   Every session of the legislature we have people elected by the
public who try to do their best to keep the public out of its own
business, trying to blot out the light, trying to make things more
``efficient'' _ meaning less encumbered by the messy business of
public accountability.
</P>
<P>
   The unfortunate chapter that was Emma L. Harrison Charter School
should make us all a little more respectful of things like public
oversight, ``burdensome'' regulations, prying media types and all
those things that make democracy messy.
</P>
<P>
   Take them away, and look at the mess you cause.

 &HT;    A shooting changes a quiet town
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Downtown Sidney, Ohio, still boasts an
old-fashioned car hop at the beloved local restaurant, The Spot.
The decor is '50s-style, but folks have been coming to the ``Cook's
Spot,'' as it was originally known, since 1913.
</P>
<P>
   Car hop Holly Hall's brother owns The Spot, as her father did
before him. ``I was born and raised in Sidney,'' Hall said, ``and
when I was a kid we all slept with the front screen door open.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, she shut and locked all her windows and doors
and turned on the air conditioning, even though it wasn't a hot
night. She sat transfixed as, all evening long, the TV scrolled the
advisory about Mike Hensley, telling residents to stay inside,
until the words ``heavily armed and very dangerous'' seemed branded
into her brain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed like it ought to be a weather report,'' Hall said,
``and not a warning about a murderer on the loose.''
</P>
<P>
   Downtown Sidney still boasts stunning 19th-century architecture
and a true walking society, where friends need no better pretext
than a stroll to get together. Brad Wille, 21, and Josh King, 18,
had walked only a few blocks Thursday afternoon when they heard
``somebody screaming as loud as day,'' Wille recounted.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, I thought it was a kid or something,'' he said. Then
came what sounded like a woman crying, `` Oh my God, my leg! My leg
!''
</P>
<P>
   ``We better check it out, Josh,'' Wille told his friend. They
cut through the yard to find a woman struggling to raise herself
from the vegetable garden where she had fallen. ``I've been shot in
the leg,'' the woman screamed, ``and there are two other girls in
the house and he killed them!''
</P>
<P>
   Wille and his friend didn't pause to consider whether they might
be in danger. They didn't feel fear so much as disbelief, a sense
of unreality. ``I had to look down at her leg to make sure it was
real,'' Wille said. The gaping hole in her pants leg, and the blood
streaking her arm and legs, made him realize, ``That's not fake.''
</P>
<P>
   A rush of adrenaline jolted them out of their trance. They
pounded on the back door of the next-door neighbor, who called 911.
After assuring the victim help was on the way, the men flagged down
a neighbor who turned out to be an off-duty police officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to give credit to the Sidney police and rescue,'' Wille
said. ``They were on it. They were there in under a minute.''
</P>
<P>
   Police give credit to the two young Samaritans, whose quick
thinking may have saved the life of Veronica Eagy, 22, who crawled
out of a basement window after the killer left her for dead. Eagy
was in fair condition late Saturday at Miami Valley Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did what was best,'' said Sidney Capt. Dean Kimpel.
``That tells you that, even though bad things happen, there are
still good people around.''
</P>
<P>
   Still shaken by the ordeal, Wille repeats the story; if he says
it often enough, perhaps, it will finally seem real.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night's horror seems impossibly incongruous with the
sense of well-being, of order, that permeates the town, named an
All-American City in 1964. The heart of the city is Court Square,
presided over by the magnificent 1881 limestone courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   Court Square is a classic Midwestern town square, a designated
National Historic Landmark. It is is flanked by the impressively
Gothic 1876 Monumental building, the first in Ohio to honor the
Civil War dead, and the eye-popping 1886 Louis Sullivan edifice,
the People's Federal Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Other than the modern cars and the shiny mower grazing the
courthouse's manicured lawn, you can almost imagine yourself in the
early part of the century. This is the America of church steeples
on every corner, of bountiful front porches and Fourth of July
parades that go on for hours. Traditions live on here that have
vanished elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   But there is one longtime hallmark of the town's character that
seems to be slowly vanishing:
</P>
<P>
   Trust.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a church-going person could up and do that, then you can't
trust anyone any more,'' said movie theater manager Wally Gibbs.
</P>
<P>
   Downtown Sidney still boasts an old-fashioned movie theater,
complete with deco-style marquee, little changed since its grand
opening in the '20s. In what passes for controversy in this town,
the balcony was converted into a two-screen theater in the '70s.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, Gibbs did something far more radical in this
neighborly, open-door town: He closed and locked the theater doors,
so no one could get in after the show started.
</P>
<P>
   The doors were barred against a man who had been a fairly
regular customer, a man Gibbs knew by sight but not, until Thursday
night, by name. Mike Hensley, he said, ``seemed like a normal
person,'' like any other customer.
</P>
<P>
   Through all that interminable night, Gibbs fielded calls from
frantic parents of his young employees, begging their children to
come straight home after work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who would ever believe it would happen in an all-American
city?'' marveled Edna Stiefel.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are thinking this town isn't as safe as we thought,''
said Brad Wille. ``For a long time people thought this is a town
where you didn't have to worry about violence, but apparently, it's
not.''
</P>
<P>
   Townspeople talked of little else Friday. Rumors spread like
brush fires. The Sidney Daily News and Dayton Daily News sold out
everywhere; in the public library, patrons craned their necks to
read newspapers over each others' shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   Parents held their children tightly. Jamie Huecker, 22, lives a
few blocks from the house where the three teen-aged girls were
murdered. ``I'm freaking,'' said the mother of two toddlers. ``A
lot of people are going to be a lot more cautious as to who they
let their kids go visit, or what neighbors they will let them play
with.''
</P>
<P>
   She used to pick up the newspaper and tell herself, ``I'm glad I
don't live in Dayton.'' Now, she said, ``You're not safe anywhere.
Those girls were too young to die.''
</P>
<P>
   Angel Burns said she would also be more cautious with her
children. When she heard the news, however, she was anything but
surprised that Hensley, her classmate in the Sidney High School
class of '88, was the suspect.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it would be anybody in Sidney,'' she added, ``it doesn't
surprise me it was him.''
</P>
<P>
   Tosha Barrett, 16, one of the slain girls, was trusting,
outgoing, said her aunt, Brenda Stiver. ``She didn't think anybody
would hurt anybody,'' Stiver said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Stiver wonders if anyone is safe anywhere. ``This is just a
small town,'' she said. ``If you can't control the violence in such
a small town, there is no control any more.''
</P>
<P>
   For months, Tosha and her sister Fawnda had lived with Stiver
and her husband Doyle, and 6-year-old daughter Cortnee who always
called her cousins her ``sisters.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Stiver has been crying so much that her face looks bruised.
``I just pray to God they catch him . . . ,'' she said. ``He's
still out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly everyone in this city of 19,000 knew one of the victims
or someone affected by the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sidney is so small, this hits everybody,'' said Larry Boykin,
20. ``Amy Mikesell (another slain teen) was my little sister's best
friend in school.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Rosie Breen spoke wistfully of a recent conversation
with her neighbor Brett Wildermuth, the fourth victim in the
shooting rampage.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nobody in this world that's any nicer than those
people,'' Breen said of the Wildermuths.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two days ago, (Brett) was out here teaching his little
5-year-old how to ride her bicycle. He said, `Rosie, do you think
I'll ever teach her?' I said, `Sure you will.'''
</P>
<P>
   She paused and stared out at the spot in front of her home where
Wildermuth had been with his little girl. ``Well, he won't now,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Tom Miller doesn't want the people of Sidney to lose their
trust in each other or their community after the tragedy, which
follows an unusually high number of violent crimes over two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a small, quiet, nice town, we really are,'' Miller said.
``It's a community to be proud of. I'm fearful some of these
unrelated incidents have given us a name that we don't deserve.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite such qualms, city officials plan to cooperate with
producers of the television program ``America's Most Wanted,'' who
have expressed interest in the case. ``I hate the notoriety,''
Miller acknowledged, ``but it's more important that this guy gets
caught.''
</P>
<P>
   A veneer of normalcy returned to Sidney over the weekend.
Thursday's terror subsided with reports that Hensley had fled to
another state.
</P>
<P>
   Customers thronged to The Spot for the famous sky-high pies. The
movie theater unbolted its doors for screenings of ``Wild, Wild
West,'' ``American Pie'' and ``Tarzan.'' Gibbs turned his attention
back to small-time miscreants, teen-agers attempting to sneak into
R-rated movies.
</P>
<P>
   But people like Brad Wille, whose life intersected, briefly but
irrevocably, with the killer next door, wonder if they will ever be
the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never had any experience like that, and I hope I never do
again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He wondered, too, if his town will ever be the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eventually, this will all blow over, and people will get on
with their lives,'' he said. ``But nobody is ever going to forget
it.

 &HT;    True crime tale revived
 &HT;    By Michael Shashoua
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ Nancy Powell's reticence belies the nature
of her true-crime story, experienced nearly firsthand.
</P>
<P>
   Powell, once a St. Augustine reporter for the Florida
Times-Union, covered the brutal 1974 murder of Athalia Lindsley, a
prominent personality in the town. Now she's told that story at
length and in detail in ``Bloody Sunset in St. Augustine: A True
Story,'' co-authored with Jim Mast (251 pages, Federal Point
Publishing, $10).
</P>
<P>
   ``The response has been overwhelming,'' said Powell, who uses
the pseudonym Shannon Smith in the book, actually a manuscript
written not long after the murder and ensuing trial. She never
intended to tell the story with her own name on it.
</P>
<P>
   Athalia Lindsley had a career as a model in New York, dating
Joseph Kennedy Jr. (John F. Kennedy's older brother who died in
WWII) at one point. Even when she moved to Florida, settling down
somewhat in her marriage to a St. Augustinian named Jim Lindsley,
she never did quite settle down. Athalia antagonized many people in
the town, especially the city manager, Alan Stanford, whom she
vehemently criticized at public meetings over a host of issues.
</P>
<P>
   Both Stanford and Jim Lindsley became suspects in Athalia's
murder, but while Jim was cleared, Stanford was tried for the
crime, although he wasn't convicted. It's the lingering lack of an
answer to whodunnit that's at the crux of Powell's book. But she
herself shies away from venturing a guess.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel I know who did it, but if you read carefully, you can
draw your own conclusion,'' Powell said. ``There are people who say
Lindsley did it, even though he had two or three good alibis. There
are some will stand up and swear he did it.''
</P>
<P>
   The book has garnered interest from unexpected quarters. Even
some of the principals in the case have taken part in public
appearances for the book, first printed in December 1998. Judge
E.L. Eastmoor, who presided at Stanford's trial, signed copies of
the book when Powell appeared at the Barnes &AMP; Noble store in St.
Augustine this spring. Walter Arnold, Stanford's defense attorney,
has also signed copies of the book for readers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody sort of took it on,'' Powell said.
</P>
<P>
   Most surprising to Powell, however, has been the interest of
younger readers in the story.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've gotten just as many young (people) as older ones, who
might have actually heard about it. A lot of the people are dead,
some of the main characters, like Jim Lindsley. Everybody except
Alan Stanford.''

   WATCHDOGS _WASHINGTON _ Inside almost every corner of the
federal government, an army of about 15,000 waste-busters is
seeking out ways that taxpayers' money is squandered. At a cost of
about $2 billion a year, investigators, auditors, inspector
generals and congressional overseers churn out a constant flow of
warnings of federal waste, abuse and fraud. But given that some
problems fester despite years of admonitions, it's not clear if
anyone is listening or responding.(Malone, Cox News Service) 25.

   BUSH-IOWA _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush _ king of fund raising,
pope of the polls _ heads to Iowa this week looking for support in
next month's GOP straw poll. It's a disproportionately important
event that looks little like democracy. Participants have to pay to
vote or get a candidate to pay for them to vote. And one group
planning on having a major impact at the event is none-too-thrilled
with Bush's middle-of-the-road position on abortion. The head of
the Iowa Christian Coalition says a ``supermajority'' of its
members want nothing to do with a candidate who won't vow to have
an anti-abortion running mate. (Herman, Austin American-Statesman)

   CONGO-ASSESS (Lusaka, Zambia) _ While its authors pitched it as

   ALASKA-GATHERERS (Kwethluk, Alaska) _ To a remarkable degree,
thousands of native people still live off the land here in the
Alaskan tundra, taking 90 percent or more of what they eat every
year from the great back country, the rivers and the Bering Sea.
But 40 years after Alaska became a state, 20 years after land-claim
disputes in the oil rush led Congress to give the people known as
``subsistence gatherers'' priority rights to fish and game, and 10
years after the state's highest court declared that protection
unconstitutional because such natural bounty was for the ``common
use'' of all Alaskans, the debate has reached a bitter crisis
point. By Sam Howe Verhovek.

   GM-LIABILITY (Los Angeles) _ The huge jury verdict against G.M.

   PRISON-MENTAL-ILLNESS _ The first comprehensive study of the

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Crucifixion. Cannibalism. Slow death by eating glass.
Sexual mutilation. Is there nothing Tom Fontana won't depict on his
HBO prison series, ``Oz''?
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with TV violence, it's a lie,'' said Fontana, who
writes most of the show's episodes and is one of its executive
producers, along with Barry Levinson and Jim Finnerty. ``People get
shot and don't bleed. They get hit and walk away. If you have to do
it, you have to do it as horrifically as it really is.'' And
Fontana is really trying as hard as he can.
</P>
<P>
   At its worst ``Oz,'' which begins its third season on Wednesday
looks as if it had been conjured up by adolescent boys trying to
gross each other out. At its best, though, ``Oz'' has elements of
Greek drama (including eyes being gouged out). There is also a
chorus, in the person of a crippled convict, Augustus, played by
Harold Perrineau, who narrates episodes from a glass cage. He even
quotes de Tocqueville.
</P>
<P>
   So far ``Oz,'' one of HBO's highest-rated dramatic shows, has
received mostly favorable reaction. The critic Stanley Crouch,
writing in The New York Times Magazine, praised it for its
``consistently brilliant acting _ some of the best in the history
of television.'' The show, Crouch wrote, ``is a landmark for the
medium.''
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, have condemned it for its violence.
``Ultimately,'' a critic for USA Today wrote, ``the show is as
dehumanizing as the prison system it attacks.'' Fontana and
Levinson are in effect glorifying the violence they depict, another
critic wrote, in The Village Voice: ``Levinson and Fontana
estheticize the material at the same time they're hyping its raw
realism.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oz'' takes place in the Oswald Maximum Security Penitentiary,
in an experimental unit the inmates have derisively nicknamed
Emerald City. But this is no dreamland. It has the latest style in
prison design, glass instead of bars, and video cameras for maximum
surveillance. The unit is perpetually bathed in an antiseptic
light.
</P>
<P>
   Here an idealistic prison administrator, Tim McManus, played by
Terry Kinney of the Steppenwolf Theater in Chicago, believes he can
genuinely rehabilitate people. But time after time he is defeated.
An affair with a tough prison guard, played by Edie Falco of HBO's
hit mini-series ``The Sopranos,'' has also failed. Now McManus has
become ``the prison he was trying to reform,'' Kinney said.
</P>
<P>
   Among Oz's good guys are the well-meaning warden (Ernie Hudson)
and the prison psychologist, Sister Peter Marie (Rita Moreno). B.D.
Wong plays a priest who sometimes seems astonished by the evil he
encounters. In one episode he gives communion to an inmate who ate
his own mother (and froze his father to save him for Thanksgiving).
</P>
<P>
   The prisoners of Oz display an almost limitless capacity for
betrayal and for inflicting pain. Still, Fontana strives to find a
core of humanity in each.
</P>
<P>
   The series is filmed in the old headquarters of the National
Biscuit Co. on West 16th Street in Manhattan where Fontana and the
actors were interviewed in January as they were filming the new
season's shows. Fontana was also interviewed later by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   Among his creations is the cunning Ryan O'Reily, played by Dean
Winters. ``He's my Iago,'' Fontana said. ``He has to survive by
making everyone think he's on their side.'' O'Reily, the epitome of
derailed intelligence, gets his way by setting one inmate against
the other.
</P>
<P>
   Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje plays Adebisi, a wild-eyed African who
rapes another prisoner. Adebisi is ``just pure, driven instinct,''
said Akinnuoye-Agbaje, a former model who was born in England of
Nigerian parents and has a law degree from Kings College in London.
</P>
<P>
   But the most evil among the evil is Vern Schillinger, the leader
of the Aryan Brotherhood, played by J.K. Simmons. Schillinger is
``one of the few characters I ever played that I refer to in the
third person,'' Simmons said, adding that last season he became
depressed by the role.
</P>
<P>
   He is happier now because Schillinger has been removed from ``Em
City'' and put into the general prison population, ``so I didn't
have to show up and be an extra all the time,'' Simmons said. The
excuse for the change, he said, will be that ``I couldn't live and
play well with others.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year Schillinger took as a sex slave Beecher, a
middle-class lawyer (Lee Tergesen), imprisoned for killing a child
while driving drunk. Schillinger burns a swastika on Beecher's
buttocks and, along with two others, breaks Beecher's arms and
legs. But Beecher seems to be regaining his strength. Last season,
by biting his attacker, he fought off an inmate who was forcing him
to perform a sex act.
</P>
<P>
   And somewhere in a gray area between good and evil is the
prisoner Kareem Said, played by Eamonn Walker, who is the Muslim
spiritual leader of the prison.
</P>
<P>
   Behind these characters is Fontana, a graduate of a Jesuit high
school in Buffalo whose sister is a nun. Fontana had himself filmed
being tattooed with the word Oz for the series' title. ``No one
else would do it,'' he said. ``I bled for the team.''
</P>
<P>
   While he was a student at Buffalo State College, he worked at
the Studio Arena Theater as a stage manager and publicist. ``An
incredible range of New York professionals, the best writers,
actors, directors would come up to do things,'' Fontana said. In
1975 he moved to New York City to write plays. ``My plays were OK;
they weren't great,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While working at the Williamstown Theater Festival as a
``general factotum'' for Nikos Psacharopoulos, then artistic
director, Fontana met Blythe Danner and her husband, Bruce Paltrow,
who was the creator of ``St. Elsewhere.'' Ms. Danner had seen
Fontana's play ``Specter Bridegroom,'' based on the Washington
Irving story, and urged her husband to see it, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he wanted to play tennis, see his kids,'' Fontana said.
So, as a sop, Paltrow asked Fontana to write an episode of ``St.
Elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My entire career is based on the fact he was too lazy to come
and see the play,'' Fontana said.
</P>
<P>
   He was a success at ``St. Elsewhere,'' a documentary-style
hospital series, and shared two Emmys for writing. Fontana won
another Emmy, for the police drama ``Homicide,'' which he also
developed with Levinson.
</P>
<P>
   When Levinson and Fontana set out to create ``Oz,'' they decided
to make it different from other prison shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a whole heritage of them,'' Fontana said. ``I'm trying
to take the audience's expectations and shatter them.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``Oz'' also looks different because he and his cinematographer
at the time, Jean de Segonzac, decided to shoot the series in
16-millimeter film instead of the usual 35. ``It's less pretty,''
Fontana said, and it gives the scenes a grainy look. The equipment
is also lighter. ``You pick up time, and you pick up mobility,''
Fontana said. ``It gives the shows a kind of energy.''
</P>
<P>
   To speed up shooting, and to create the harsh prison light, the
set is permanently lighted from the ceiling, which means that less
equipment has to be moved.
</P>
<P>
   And while broadcast network shows are divided into acts, each
ending in an artificial climax to allow for commercials, ``Oz''
runs one hour straight on HBO, a premium cable channel. ``With `Oz'
you can never break away,'' Fontana said. ``It's unsettling in a
good way.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Fontana said the series would have been possible only on a cable
channel like HBO, which can tackle controversial subjects without
the limits set by network standards. ``They're the only ones who
would let me do it the right way,'' he said. ``All the others would
make me tone it down.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that Chris Albrecht, the president of HBO Original
Programming, told him, ``I don't care if none of the characters are
likable.'''' Fontana added, ``That gave me the freedom to not have
to make it palatable.''
</P>
<P>
   He defends the prisoners' evil doings. ``It's like Shakespeare
or Greek tragedy: All the characters are bold in their action,'' he
said. ``It's all rooted in my Latin and Greek from the Jesuits. I
loved Edith Hamilton, Sophocles, Euripides, Aeschylus and
Shakespeare. They were my boys.''
</P>
<P>
   He is drawn to larger-than-life protagonists, Fontana said. And
they are punished for their sins accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Biting someone's penis off is a punishment worthy of the
crime,'' Fontana said, referring to the series' most grotesque
incidents. But he added that there was also a touch of Chekhov in
the show, a ``great sense of longing and loss.''
</P>
<P>
   Insisting that ``Oz'' presents a true picture of American prison
life, Fontana cited a 1998 Amnesty International report critical of
the criminal justice system in the United States. He said the
Amnesty report had even given him ideas for the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Throw rats in the cell?'' Fontana said. ``I'm going to do
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of a rat in the pod _ oh man!'' he said, wiping his
brow with a sweep of his hand.

<P>
   Two months before the product is scheduled to go on sale at
retailers throughout the country, Sega Enterprises plans to start
making its next-generation videogame console available for rent
this week through about 1,000 Hollywood Video stores, along with a
new version of ``Sonic the Hedgehog,'' a popular Sega game,
designed for the updated machine.
</P>
<P>
   For Sega, much rests on the success of the new game console,
called the Dreamcast, and on the unusual pump-priming marketing
experiment. The Tokyo-based company has been losing money and is in
the midst of an overhaul that includes eliminating 1,000 jobs _
about a quarter of its work force.
</P>
<P>
   Long ago the leader in the videogame industry, Sega now ranks a
distant third in the $10 billion worldwide videogame market, behind
Sony and Nintendo. Some analysts say that a failure with Dreamcast
will force Sega to leave the game console business and jeopardize
its ability to remain independent.
</P>
<P>
   Making the new machines available for rent before they go on
sale is a reversal of the typical market introduction for videogame
machines, in which rental units usually are not made available
until six months or more after a new console goes on sale in
stores. The move is part of a planned $100 million promotional
campaign for Dreamcast and is intended to whet potential buyers'
appetite for the machines.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, where the Dreamcast has been available for almost a
year, the system has had such weak sales that last month a Japanese
rating agency lowered Sega's credit rating to one notch above junk
status. The rating change pushed Sega's stock to a new low in
Tokyo. The company's American depository receipts, each
representing a quarter of an ordinary share, were as low as
$3.15625 on June 28 and closed on Friday at $3.875 _ down from a
52-week high of $6.25 last December.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sega probably has six months and at most nine months to gain a
significant following for Dreamcast, or it's game over,'' said John
Latta, president of Fourth Wave, a market research firm that tracks
the video and arcade game industries. ``Their objective must be to
sell as many units and as many games as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Sega hopes the promotion _ which begins at 12:01 a.m. on
Thursday with midnight parties at Hollywood Video stores in New
York, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Portland, Ore. _ will
spur consumer demand for the game system, said Bernie Stolar,
president of Sega of America. Most stores will have about 10
Dreamcasts available for rent at $19.99 each, although some stores
will offer as many as 100 of the machines.
</P>
<P>
   In about 600 stores, kiosks also will be available where the
game can be played. In August, a Dreamcast version of Sega's
football title, ``NFL 2000,'' and a new wrestling title, ``Ready 2
Rumble,'' from Midway Home Entertainment may be available, Sega
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Dreamcast console is to be offered for purchase starting on
Sept. 9 at $199, with about 16 games scheduled for release by then.
</P>
<P>
   The Dreamcast system will feature a 56-kilobit-a-second modem,
allowing users to play games on the Internet. The Dreamcast console
is a 128-bit machine, meaning its chip processes 128 bits of
information at a time _ compared with 64 bits for the slower Sega
Saturn player currently on the market, and the 64-bit Sony
Playstation and Nintendo 64.
</P>
<P>
   A hand-held visual memory unit can be bought separately for the
Dreamcast. The small, rectangular device, which resembles a
Tamogotchi virtual-pet toy, will allow players to swap games and
characters as well as play some videogames. The company said that
consumers had placed reservations to purchase more than 100,000
Dreamcasts. It hopes to double that number by September and to sell
1 million consoles by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Sega also hopes that it has learned from mistakes made with
several previous consoles, whose dismal showings hurt the company's
popularity among consumers and retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Just 5 million of Dreamcast's predecessor, the Saturn, have been
sold worldwide since its introduction in November 1995. By
contrast, more than 24 million Nintendo 64 units have been sold
since 1997, while more than 54 million Sony Playstations have been
sold since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've taken an aggressive stance,'' Stolar said.``We really
need to win back the confidence of consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   To promote the system, Sega is spending about $100 million on
the introduction, about twice what Sony spent when it released the
Playstation, said Stolar, a former Sony executive vice president
who worked on the Playstation introduction.
</P>
<P>
   The company is spending another $100 million on product
development. In addition, it is taking the unusual step of helping
outside developers cover the cost of creating games, Stolar said.
</P>
<P>
   And for the September rollout, the game system will be available
simultaneously at about 15,000 retailers.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``They're being very retailer friendly,'' said Gary Neville,
owner of Dragon's Den, a Yonkers, N.Y., videogame store, and
Forbidden Planet, a similar store in New York City. ``They're
promising the world right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Sony and Nintendo, however, are not sitting idly by as Sega
works to regain market share.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies have announced plans for new consoles. Sony's
Playstation II could reach the United States in the fall of 2000.
Sony's new system, also a 128-bit console, is widely expected to be
the most powerful gaming system available, featuring movielike
graphics. Nintendo's next system, which will move the company from
the cartridge to the DVD format, may be available worldwide late
next year.
</P>
<P>
   And both Sony and Nintendo plan to lower the prices on the
current game systems to about $99, compared with about $129
currently.
</P>
<P>
   Sega may indeed have the advantage of being first with a 128-bit
system, but whether it will be able to maintain its momentum in the
face of its competitors' more powerful systems is uncertain. A
number of analysts outside of Sega are skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many believe the Sony Playstation II will be the dominant
system,'' said James Lin, a research analyst at Wedbush Morgan
Securities in Los Angeles. Despite Dreamcast's superior graphics _
an important feature for game enthusiasts _ the current Playstation
is still the leading system in Japan, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a make-or-break system for Sega,'' Neville, the
retailer, said. ``If they don't launch this system correctly, they
can really hang it up. They'll be in the video hall of fame next to
the Atari Jaguar.'' He was referring to a 64-bit system with a
compact disk player that was released in the early 1990s and
quickly disappeared.

BROADCASTER SEEKS CHANGE IN DIGITAL TV FORMAT 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It seems to be a hopeless, quixotic mission.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's transition to digital television is now in its
ninth month, and more than 70 television stations nationwide have
begun broadcasting on their digital channels. Hundreds more have
placed orders for digital transmission equipment. At the same time,
as many as 40,000 consumers have bought expensive new digital
television sets.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Sinclair Broadcasting Group, a maverick company
that owns or operates 59 television stations nationwide, is waging
an audacious campaign to revise the digital format, saying the
current version is seriously flawed. If Sinclair succeeds, much of
the brand-new equipment broadcasters and consumers have already
purchased will be rendered obsolete, like the Betamax VCRs or
quadraphonic audio systems of decades past.
</P>
<P>
   Television stations would have to replace portions of their
digital transmitters with a new piece of circuitry that costs as
much as $50,000. And thousands of consumers would find that their
digital television receivers no longer worked.
</P>
<P>
   It is too early to know if the Sinclair campaign will succeed.
Still, Bruce Franca, deputy chief of the Federal Communications
Commission's engineering and technology office, said: ``It
certainly makes you step back and think. But I'm not sure it's
enough to convince us that we made a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   With recent purchases, Sinclair now owns or operates more
television stations than any other company. And by the beginning of
November, according to the FCC's timetable, 13 of the Sinclair
stations must begin digital broadcasting. The company says it plans
to meet that deadline, even though its leaders say they stumbled on
a serious problem with the nation's digital television standard
last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Sinclair engineers were running transmission tests and found to
their surprise that when they were working inside city buildings
they could not reliably receive a viewable digital picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did some more tests, and we saw that something was
seriously wrong,'' Nat Ostroff, a Sinclair vice president, said.
And now the company is on a campaign to have the transmission
system changed to one that is used in Europe and has been shown to
work better in urban environments. For the past two weeks, Sinclair
has been staging compelling demonstrations of the two systems in
Baltimore, near the company's headquarters. Dozens of broadcasters,
government officials and others have come by to see.
</P>
<P>
   Digital broadcasts are supposed to provide for sharper pictures
and CD-quality sound, and to allow for the creation of new types of
computerlike add-on services still to be invented. But Sinclair
contends that technical limits of the current format could cripple
the nascent market.
</P>
<P>
   Defenders of the existing transmission system, however, say the
Sinclair tests are flawed because they simply stress the advantages
of the European system without addressing the trade-offs and
disadvantages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, the demonstration looks great; but they're using
first-generation equipment,'' said Richard Lewis, a senior vice
president with Zenith Electronics Corp., which invented the current
U.S. transmission system. He said the American industry was
continually improving the technology though subsequent generations
of equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an issue everyone in the industry is working on,''
Lewis said. ``We've made improvements already and will continue to
_ very quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   During the many years of development, the consortium of
companies that created the nation's digital television standard ran
exhaustive tests of their own to determine whether transmissions
would remain robust and viewable at extended distances.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, in Charlotte, N.C., a city with varied terrain,
the testers outfitted a truck with an outdoor television antenna
attached to a boom they could raise from the truck's roof. Over
many months, they drove all over town, parked at the side of the
road, raised the antenna 30 feet and, using equipment in the cab,
checked to see if they could receive a digital signal broadcast
from in town. Overall, the system performed magnificently.
</P>
<P>
   In the following years, similar tests were run in other cities,
including New York, and all produced successful results showing
that, with a rooftop antenna, the system works quite well. But
until now, no one had run an organized series of tests indoors,
using inexpensive indoor antennas. And as it turns out, using the
consumer-grade digital television receivers currently available in
stores, in many urban, indoor locations the system fails.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is multipath distortion. Inside buildings,
particularly, a television antenna picks up signals from many
angles. One signal comes straight from the transmitting tower,
while another comes from a different direction after it bounces off
other structures. These signals do not necessarily arrive
simultaneously, confusing the receiver.
</P>
<P>
   With conventional television receivers, this problem can cause
annoying ``ghosts'' in the picture. But in many cases, digital
receivers simply fail altogether.
</P>
<P>
   For the demonstrations under way now, Sinclair is broadcasting a
full-power digital signal from the company's Baltimore television
station and comparing the American and European systems. And with
visitors in tow, they are hauling digital receivers and test
equipment to parking decks, apartment buildings, offices and other
urban locations. Then they turn everything on and hold up two
antennas: a ``bow tie'' type for indoor use of the sort distributed
with most television sets, and a slightly more sophisticated
table-top model purchased at Radio Shack for $16.99.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Last Wednesday, Ostroff and several other Sinclair engineers ran
demonstrations for a group of visiting broadcasters, and the first
stop was the fifth floor of an open parking deck in the middle of
town (chosen to simulate the reception inside an urban apartment or
office building, while allowing the engineers to drive right in).
</P>
<P>
   They pulled out their receivers and held up the two cheap
antennas, perched atop a short aluminum pole. And while the
visitors clustered around, the Sinclair personnel called the
station on a cell phone and asked the engineers there to broadcast
first with the American system and then with the European
alternative.
</P>
<P>
   With the American system, the television monitor displayed a
picture only when the antenna was carefully aimed and held
perfectly still. Even then, a car driving past or a hand waved in
front of the antenna would disrupt the signal, and the digital
receiver boxes would black out, showing the messages ``channel not
available'' or ``tuning failed.'' But when the transmission system
was switched to the European system, the signal came in clear and
clean with no difficulty and little interference.
</P>
<P>
   The traveling show then moved to an apartment building and was
set up in the apartment of a Sinclair sales manager who was away on
vacation. His television room faced Baltimore's Inner Harbor, while
the television transmitter was in the opposite direction, a
prescription for multipath distortion.
</P>
<P>
   And sure enough, the results were even more lopsided, causing
one of the broadcasters to note with a shake of the head, ``You
have to work to find a signal'' with the American system, ``and you
have to work to lose it'' with the other.
</P>
<P>
   At other times, the tests have been run in a variety of city
locations, even down on the sidewalk, but the results are always
the same.
</P>
<P>
   Sinclair is campaigning to persuade the government to scrap the
present transmission system and substitute the European
alternative. David Smith, chief executive of the company, says it
would be ``a minor change'' _ just a circuit board in the digital
transmitters that would cost no more than $50,000 to swap.
</P>
<P>
   As for consumers who have already purchased digital receivers,
``I can't imagine that the broadcasting industry would back away
from buying a few thousand new TV sets for these people,'' Smith
said. ``It's worth the price to get a system that can allow us to
survive as over-the-air broadcasters.''
</P>
<P>
   But Robert Graves, who runs the Advanced Television Systems
Committee, an industry organization that codifies broadcast
standards, said the change would be significantly more complicated
and require three years of testing and analysis. ``This is hardly a
trivial matter,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith says he plans to ask other station group owners to sign a
petition to be presented to the FCC, which has not taken a stand on
the debate. If the FCC does not respond, Smith added, ``Then we
will go to Congress,'' which has shown itself to be open to
entreaties from the broadcast industry.
</P>
<P>
   But Smith may have trouble enlisting a large group of
broadcasters. Lynn Claudy, a senior vice president with the
National Association of Broadcasters, saw the Sinclair
demonstration and said he found it impressive, though ``it is
highly dependent on those first-generation receivers they used.''
But he said his organization had not heard from other broadcasters
saying they wanted to revise the standard.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Widoff, a senior vice president with WETA, a public
television station in Washington, visited Sinclair and concluded
that ``the evidence, on its face, it pretty hard to refute.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, he added, echoing others: ``I don't really know
what it means. And I am extremely reluctant at this point to blow
this whole thing up.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another comfortably cool morning is expected from New England
southwestward to the central Plains. A few record lows are likely
in the upper lakes and the interior Northeast. An expansive area of
high pressure stretching from Cape Cod to southern Missouri will
supply the northern half of the nation, east of the Rockies, with
generally dry and very pleasant midsummer weather.
</P>
<P>
   The boundary with a tropical air mass over the South will be
marked by clouds, showers and clusters of thunderstorms. A
developing disturbance in the western Carolinas will spark several
large thunderstorms near the coast. Flooding rains and damaging
winds are possible. More showers and storms will be found along the
front from the interior Gulf states to south Texas.
</P>
<P>
   A disturbance in the jet stream moving through the Ohio Valley
will draw clouds northward from the front into the Appalachians and
Middle Atlantic states. Showers will grow over the central
Appalachians and some will move into Virginia. The moistening of
the cool, dry air mass over southern Virginia and North Carolina
will cause temperatures to average fifteen degrees or more below
seasonal levels.
</P>
<P>
   Warmer air pushing east from the northern Rockies may produce a
thundershower in northern Minnesota. Hot weather, with record
highs, in the Northwest will be accompanied by sunny skies and
gusty winds near the Cascades. The Southwest will stay unsettled
with clouds and thundershowers migrating north toward the Central
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: Flood Legacy
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of Thursday's flood in Las Vegas, Friday was an
unusually cool day. The normal high temperature for July 9 is 104
degrees and the lowest maximum, prior to Friday, was 94 degrees in
1966. However, the mercury failed to reach 90 this past Friday due
in large part to the flood the day before. The normally arid air
near the surface was still saturated from evaporating the recent
rain. The sun's energy worked at drying the land instead of heating
the air. At the same time, the moist lower atmosphere produced
abundant clouds by midday, curtailing the warming process.

   DEER-TICK-SUMMER _ While deer tick populations are notoriously
spotty and difficult to generalize about, it has been a
particularly heavy season in some parts of the region.
Notwithstanding the introduction this year of a new vaccine, the
experts say that Lyme disease, which sickens some 7,000 to 10,000
people each year in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut and a few
thousand more in the rest of the country, is here to stay. So are
the ticks. By Andy Newman. (With photos.)

   BBO-MARTINEZ-PROFILE _ Pedro Martinez can't lift a Volkswagen.
There is nothing cartoonish about his body, no Popeye forearms, no
Superman chest; Martinez possesses the physical presence of a toll
taker. His favorite dietary supplement could be grapefruit. But
even though Pedro Martinez is slight enough to be a tattoo on the
biceps of Mark McGwire, he is the Mark McGwire of pitchers in 1999.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LENOX, Mass. _ The descriptive subtitle that Beethoven provided
for the first movement of his ``Pastorale'' Symphony reads, in
English translation, ``Awakening of happy feelings upon reaching
the countryside.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps by opening the 1999 summer season of the Boston Symphony
Orchestra at Tanglewood with the ``Pastorale'' the conductor Seiji
Ozawa was hoping to engender just such happy feelings among his
players and the orchestra's administration. They have all been
through a lot lately.
</P>
<P>
   Ozawa, who is celebrating his 25th year as the orchestra's music
director, recently announced that he would be leaving in 2002 to
become the music director of the Vienna State Opera. The
announcement was unexpected. Clearly Ozawa has a solid core of
support in the Boston organization. But the level of discontent
that has become public knowledge, at least among many of the
players, is striking.
</P>
<P>
   Ozawa will be in place for three more seasons in Boston and four
summers at Tanglewood, including this one, and surely he will want
to accomplish much with his remaining time. Yet the schedule,
though planned well before his announcement, suggests that the
separation process may already have begun.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 22 major Boston Symphony Orchestra programs this summer,
Ozawa will conduct only five. (He will also lead one high-profile
concert in the main Music Shed with the combined players of the
Tanglewood Music Center Orchestra and the Gustav Mahler Youth
Orchestra.) For much of August he has commitments elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the threat of rain, Friday's opening night concert drew
some 9,200 people (including picnickers on the lawn) to the
orchestra's bucolic Berkshire Mountain summer home. Like many
concerts under Ozawa, this one was mixed. Making a program of
Beethoven's Sixth (``Pastorale'') and Seventh symphonies is at once
timid (the music is tried and true) and risky (a conductor and
orchestra are inevitably setting themselves up for comparison with
the glorious performance histories of these works). And though
there was nothing particularly wrong with the performances, there
was nothing particularly special either.
</P>
<P>
   In the ``Pastorale'' Ozawa seemed to be trying for a genial,
undulant quality. Often it just seemed placid. He devoted a great
deal of attention to expressively shaping the long melodic arcs in
the first violins. But the result was melodically top-heavy. In
general, there was little sense of the extraordinary daring in this
piece; for example, the way Beethoven in the first movement will
repeat a short motif for a shockingly long stretch of time. It
should provoke you to wonder, ``What's going on here?,'' not lull
you into dreamy thoughts of birdies and babbling brooks.
</P>
<P>
   There were some lovely individual moments from the players, and
at times the orchestra sound was luminous. But given the collected
talent onstage the performance had a disappointing sense of just
not clicking.
</P>
<P>
   For some, Ozawa's way with the Seventh Symphony might have been
too driven. I thought it essentially effective and at times
exciting. The vivace first movement was a bit heavy footed, but the
allegretto had a taut, restrained beauty. And the finale built with
rushing energy to its pummeling, exuberant conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of dramatic timing, nature and Beethoven were not in
sync. The anticipated rain did arrive, a short, heavy downpour, but
during the first movement of the Seventh Symphony, not the storm
section of the ``Pastorale,'' which would have been most effective.
</P>
<P>
   The weather was balmy on Saturday night for the concert
conducted by Andre Previn. The program's all-Mozart first half was
unimaginative and somewhat skimpy: the Overture to ``Le Nozze di
Figaro'' followed by the Violin Concerto No. 3 with the always
popular Itzhak Perlman as soloist, who played with his trademark
sleek technique and creamy tone.
</P>
<P>
   The second half offered the first performance of a suite that
Previn has fashioned from his opera, ``A Streetcar Named Desire,''
which received its premiere last fall at the San Francisco Opera.
As a concert work, the suite is impractically long (nearly 50
minutes) and imbalanced: there are extended orchestral interludes
and whole long arias for Blanche, yet just two brief scenes
involving Mitch. Susannah Glanville, a British soprano with a
sizable lyric voice who took over the role of Blanche from Renee
Fleming in San Francisco, sang compellingly, and the young American
tenor Anthony Dean Griffey, who created the role of Mitch, was
impressive and affecting, though underutilized.
</P>
<P>
   The suite did nothing to alter my opinion that Previn's opera,
though ably done, does not stand up to this iconic, timeless play.
</P>
<P>
   For all its restraint and for all Previn's sensitivity to the
story, the music could be a film score by one of the highly skilled
European composers who took refuge in Hollywood during World War
II, though Previn's evocations of jazz are more authentic.
</P>
<P>
   The orchestra played with lush sound and confidence, if with
little sense of involvement.
</P>
<P>
   The Tanglewood season runs through Aug. 30. Once again the most
intriguing event of the summer looks to be the Festival of
Contemporary Music, featuring the young musicians of the Tanglewood
Music Center during the last week of this month. For listeners with
a sense of adventure and all the participants, this exciting
new-music festival always engenders happy feelings in the
countryside.

KANSAS CITY MUSEUM PICKS ARCHITECT FOR ADDITION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mo.)  (js) 
 By JULIE V. IOVINE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City, Mo., has
selected Steven Holl, the New York architect, to design its first
expansion since its opening in 1933.
</P>
<P>
   The new addition, which is largely submerged and features seven
glass extrusions scattered in the grassy turf of a 17-acre
sculpture park, will enlarge the museum by 55 percent, to 374,000
square feet. Marc F. Wilson, the museum's director, described the
scheme as ``great quartz crystals spilling neatly on the side
lawn.''
</P>
<P>
   Holl was selected from six finalists, including Tadao Ando of
Osaka, Japan; Christian de Portzamparc of Paris; Annette Gigo and
Mike Guyer of Zurich; Carlos Jiminez of Houston, and Rodolfo
Machado and Jorge Silvetti of Boston. The designs presented by all
six architects will be on display at the museum from Aug. 7 through
Oct. 17.
</P>
<P>
   The museum's trustees have raised $135 million as part of a
capital campaign undertaken in 1997 and have dedicated $80 million
to creating the new addition to the Beaux-Arts style museum.
Construction is expected to begin in early 2001 and be completed by
the summer of 2004.
</P>
<P>
   The Nelson-Atkins Museum is one of the most distinguished
general art museums in the United States, with an especially strong
Chinese art collection of landscape paintings from the Sung
Dynasty. Its holdings include 13 monumental bronzes by Henry Moore
and a series of Olympian-sized shuttlecocks commissioned from Claes
Oldenberg and Coosje van Bruggen.
</P>
<P>
   The museum was designed in 1927 by Thomas Wight, a Canadian-born
architect who had apprenticed with McKim, Mead and White. While
extensive renovation of the building is not part of Holl's mandate,
enticing the people of Kansas City to treat the museum as a more
welcoming place is. ``For too many people, for too long a time,
this museum was a big stone front,'' said Donald J. Hall, the
senior trustee.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Holl's design was selected unanimously by a nine-member
committee that included Hall, chairman of Hallmark Cards; J. Carter
Brown, director emeritus of the National Gallery of Art, and Ada
Louise Huxtable, architecture critic of The Wall Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
   Holl, 52, is pre-eminent among a generation of architects
(including Tod Williams and Billie Tsien, Henry Smith Miller and
Laurie Hawkinson and Eric Owen Moss) who appear always to be
emerging from the long shadow of architects like Frank Gehry, Peter
Eisenman, Richard Meier and even the nonagenarian Philip Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Holl took a bold chance in his proposal. The program had called
for the architects to make their addition on the imposing north
facade. The other entrants did use the classical front as a
backdrop to their sculptural activities. But Holl left the original
building untouched and set his approximately 140,000-square-foot
addition to the eastern side, submerging it beneath disparate glass
lanterns that he called ``a meandering garden of lights.''
</P>
<P>
   Visitors will arrive at a large stone plaza with a reflecting
pool and enter the glowing lantern of a new three-story lobby or an
underground parking garage lighted by glass lenses in the bottom of
the pool. Within the lobby pavilion, a ramp will lead down to ``an
umbilical cord zone,'' the architect said, where one will proceed
to the old building or to the new galleries, whose shaped ceilings
respond to the rolling topography outside. At several points it
will be possible to pass between interior and exterior sculpture
gardens.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's different without being confrontational,'' Wilson said of
the design.

BERLITZ WILL USE `SESAME STREET' TO TEACH ENGLISH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: China, Japan, Taiwan)  (js) 
 By LAWRIE MIFFLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Berlitz International is joining hands with the producers of
``Sesame Street'' to use the internationally known television
program in a multimedia project to teach English as a second
language to children around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Led by an exuberant purple Muppet named Tingo, created for the
project by the Jim Henson Co., ``Sesame English'' will be a
15-minute program produced by the Children's Television Workshop
and licensed exclusively by Berlitz for use in its 400 teaching
centers in 50 countries, and for sale in book, audio, video and
CD-ROM form.
</P>
<P>
   For the nonprofit Children's Television Workshop, which retains
the right to sell the program to television networks, the project
brings to fruition a long-held vision of using ``Sesame Street'' to
help youngsters around the world learn English, along with the
various social skills Bert, Ernie, Big Bird and friends have always
taught.
</P>
<P>
   For Berlitz, ``Sesame English'' is a step in its fledgling
effort to expand its language instruction business from adults to
children and teen-agers. Indeed, the company's executive vice
president and chief operating officer, Mako Obara, unabashedly
forecast a potential $4 billion global market for this new venture,
including all sales and Internet distribution (that would be almost
10 times Berlitz's 1998 total sales revenue of $436 million).
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember, we have exclusive rights to sell this or license to
a third party, worldwide,'' Obara said at a news conference
announcing the venture last Thursday. ``And we think Internet use
will be very important. We may develop straight-to-home sales from
our Web site.''
</P>
<P>
   Summing up the two partners' specialties, Obara added: ``For the
TV program, they develop, we advise. For the live instruction
programs and instructional materials, we develop, they advise.''
</P>
<P>
   The Children's Television Workshop has invested about $15
million to create and produce 52 episodes of the new program, which
will be finished by the end of the year (they include some footage
from the ``Sesame Street'' program library, along with new
segments).
</P>
<P>
   The partners said they would start the project in China, Taiwan
and Japan, partly because of the demand for English instruction in
those nations.
</P>
<P>
   While the show probably will not be on television networks until
next spring, Obara said language-instruction programs could start
in Berlitz centers as early as September.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The products will be marketed to schools and after-school
learning centers, as well as to Berlitz customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are keenly aware that English is the uncontested first
choice among Berlitz customers around the world,'' said Hirosama
Yokoi, president and chief executive of Berlitz International, a
unit of Benesse Corp. ``CTW discovered the same phenomenon in its
worldwide broadcasts.''
</P>
<P>
   Although ``Sesame Street'' in other nations is produced in
partnership with local broadcasters and done in the local language,
the producers are often asked for English-language videos of the
program. David Britt, president and chief executive of the
Children's Television Workshop, said recent immigrants to the
United States _ including adults and older siblings of Sesame
watchers _ often use the program to learn English and something
about American customs.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Workshop executives had been looking for partners in
various countries to develop ``Sesame Street'' as an
English-instruction tool. Then someone thought of Berlitz, said
Robert Minsky, executive vice president for corporate planning and
marketing at Berlitz.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said, `Why are you running from country to country when
Berlitz is teaching in 50 countries and has 120 years' experience?'
'' Minsky recounted.

   The Long Island Fiction Book Club is a suburban Port Washington,
N.Y., reading group that has endured longer than some marriages and
pored over the pages of more than 100 novels from Flaubert's
``Madame Bovary'' to Amy Tan's ``Joy Luck Club.''
</P>
<P>
   But even the founder and some of its members willingly confess
to an embarrassing little secret of their past _ aliteracy. ``In my
40s and 50s, I never read a book, except for art books,'' said
Lawrence Kamisher. Now, at 72, he says he devours about two titles
a week and indulges in three reading groups plus regular
discussions at the local gym whirlpool.
</P>
<P>
   A fellow fiction club member, Norman Glasserow, also confesses
some mortification. ``I'm ashamed to say it, but months went by
before I read a book,'' Glasserow said. ``I would go to gatherings
and people would start discussing the latest contemporary fiction.
I stood with my mouth agape. I would edge my way over to a
corner.'' At 76, he says, he has made a conscious effort to read
more frequently.
</P>
<P>
   In a decade when booksellers are battling fiercely for customers
and titles are as accessible as a click of a computer keyboard,
fewer people are reading, according to an ambitious new study. But
the older the age group, the more people are reading _ with people
over 50 reading an average of an hour a day, nearly double the time
of people in their 20s and below.
</P>
<P>
   Those trends are reflected in the report, by the NPD Group Inc.,
a market research concern in Park Ridge, Ill., which for the last
eight years has been methodically collecting information in a study
of the daily activities of 24,000 men and women _ 3,000 different
people each year _ who were chosen to reflect the national
population, spanning the ages of 18 to 90.
</P>
<P>
   The NPD's research through the 1990s detects a continuing
falloff in younger readers who said they spend at least 30 minutes
of the day reading anything. The percentage is relatively stable
for people 55 and older, with an increasing percentage for people
over 65.
</P>
<P>
   At the start of the study in 1992, almost 51 percent of the
people in the study said they were reading that amount of time. But
by 1999, the percentage had dropped to 45 percent. The steepest
reduction came among young men between the ages of 18 and 34: _
about 22 percent who reported reading that amount, down from 36
percent in 1992. The survey, which has a margin of error of plus or
minus 3 percent, did not ask participants to break down their form
of reading _ such as books, magazines, newspapers or computer
screens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reading happens to be the one area that has the greatest
potential for change in the next 10 years,'' said Harry Balzer, a
vice-president for the NPD Group. He predicted that as the baby
boomer generation ages it could be a help the book market because
of its numbers and older people's penchant for reading.
</P>
<P>
   But in the mean time, the challenge for book publishers is to
devise strategies to nurture future generations of readers and to
court older buyers in a market for popular titles that was
confronted in the last two years with a 3 percent decline in the
number of books purchased.

   Simon &AMP; Schuster, a unit of Viacom Inc., for instance, has just
published a new book, ``Serpent'' by the thriller writer Clive
Cussler that is a super-sized paperback hybrid designed to appeal
to aging readers with fading vision with larger type and a cheaper
price than a hardcover or quality trade paperback.
</P>
<P>
   Publishers like Scholastic and Avon Books are meeting informally
with teen-age students and establishing focus groups and advisory
boards to literally get a read on their tastes. Their appetite for
more realistic books has prompted Scholastic to commission a
six-part book series based on the diaries and journals of eight
anonymous high school teens-agers called, ``Diary of Junior Year.''
In May, Avon, a unit of the Hearst Corp., created a new literary
imprint for older teen-agers called Avon Tempest with a debut book
about heroin addiction featuring a teen-age character called
``Smack.''
</P>
<P>
   The critical question for the book industry is whether reading
will always naturally evolve with age.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, some of the earliest reading surveys in the United
States, dating back to the 1920s, showed a reverse pattern with
reading declining with age. Various Gallup Poll surveys continued
to detect such a pattern in 1949 and 1966, but by 1984 when
pollsters asked the question ``are you reading a book presently''
the percentage of younger readers trailed behind middle-aged and
older readers.
</P>
<P>
   No one is quite sure why the pattern of reading has shifted
among age groups, but one theory is that in earlier years younger
people tended to read in higher percentages because they were
better educated than the older readers. And now, with the American
population becoming more educated, new explanations have developed
to explain where the attention of younger readers may be wandering.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier last year, Jean Feiwel, the publisher of Scholastic
Books, gathered about 10 teen-age students in New York to learn
more about the daily routine of their lives. In March, the company
followed up those informal discussions with focus group studies of
ninth-grade high school students in Stamford, Conn., and Encino,
Calif., to develop a better strategy for marketing books to younger
readers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that struck me enormously is that their days are
just jammed, from 6 a.m. to 12, just relentlessly scheduled by
themselves. Homework. Before school sports. Church. Music. Going to
the movies. Hanging out with their friends,'' said Ms. Feiwel, who
noted that reading has become almost an activity that has to be
scheduled rather than a spontaneous ritual.
</P>
<P>
   Even though there are fewer people reading, the amount of time
people actually spend reading has decreased only slightly in the
last eight years, according to the NPD study _ down to 44 minutes a
day from 46. The steepest drop in reading time was detected among
men between 18 and 34 who are reading about 13 minutes less a day
since 1992, down from 29 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   At the University of Maryland, John P. Robinson, a sociologist,
has been conducting the ``The Use of Time Project'' since 1965,
questioning people about their daily activities every 10 years
through 1995. His study also detected about a 10-minute drop from
34 minutes in daily reading over that period, but his information
showed that most of that decline came from newspaper reading while
people had slightly increased their reading in a combined category
that included books and magazines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see that there has actually been a gain in free-time
activity to about 42 to 44 hours a week,'' said Geoffrey C. Godbey,
a co-author with Robinson of a book called ``Time for Life'' and a
professor of leisure studies at Pennsylvania State University.
``And for the first time we see that gain going to forms of
recreation like exercise.''
</P>
<P>
   Through much of the 1990s, people have consistently told
pollsters for Roper and Gallup that they value reading, desire
books for Christmas presents and consider reading one of the most
important elements in the education of their children.
</P>
<P>
   But in Gallup's last poll on actual reading habits, in 1990,
those good intentions did not necessarily result in more reading.
Gallup, which has been querying people about their reading habits
since 1949, detected a downward trend _ the proportion of Americans
who had not completed a book in the last year had doubled to 16
percent in 1990 from 8 percent in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Does it matter if fewer people are reading? Carl F. Kaestle, the
author of a history of reading, ``Literacy in the United States''
and a Brown University professor of education, said that he tends
to take the nonalarmist view.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never believed that the sky is falling down,'' Kaestle
said. ``But on the other hand, as an educator, I'm devoted to
analytical thinking and it makes me nervous if people are reading
less, because reading in print is traditionally the way we help
people to sharpen their thoughts. Are people substituting
electronic communication?''
</P>
<P>
   The information in the NPD study is gathered through check-off
time sheets divided in half-hour increments through a day. The firm
picked the 20 daily activities that people were most likely to be
involved in based on their market research. It did not include a
separate category for computer use or online activity, which
participants could have checked off in a variety of categories like
home entertainment or simply ``other.''
</P>
<P>
   But even those categories did not show dramatic gains. The
activity that did gain the most in time spent was rather mundane _
sleeping. In all age groups, people are sleeping more _ between
five to 35 minutes more a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this study says,'' Balzer of the NPD Group, ``is that
people are literally pursuing their dreams.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For movie theater owners this summer, it is the best
of times and the worst of times.
</P>
<P>
   The summer is shaping up as the best ever at the box office, on
the strength of hits like ``Stars Wars,'' ``Austin Powers'' and
``The Wild, Wild West,'' and with widely anticipated movies like
Stanley Kubrick's ``Eyes Wide Shut'' still ahead. And filmgoers are
flocking to sparkling new megaplexes _ theater complexes that
typically have more than a dozen big screens, digital sound systems
and so-called stadium seating, with armchairs arrayed in tiers to
offer each member of the audience an unobstructed view.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the new megaplexes,'' Gloria Dickerson, a children's
book distributor, said enthusiastically as she left a screening
last Thursday of the Spike Lee film, ``Summer of Sam,'' at the new
Loews megaplex on Manhattan's East Side. ``The seats are
comfortable. I think they're wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   In short, for filmmakers and their audiences, going to the
movies has seldom been better. So how come the companies that run
the theaters are having such a lousy summer?
</P>
<P>
   The four leading publicly held exhibitor companies _ AMC
Entertainment, Carmike Theaters, GC Cos. and Loews Cineplex
Entertainment _ all lost money in their most recently completed
fiscal years, and their stocks are sagging. While the extent of the
problem varies among these companies, all are finding themselves on
the wrong side of two economic forces: a glut of screens that
cannot keep up with record demand for movie tickets, and a costly
unplanned obsolescence for hundreds of cinemas.
</P>
<P>
   Though audiences are flocking to the spacious new megaplexes,
people are staying away in droves from many of the so-called
multiplexes of shoe-box size theaters that have been a mainstay of
shopping malls and a staple of the movie industry for decades.
</P>
<P>
   Because the big exhibitors with the financial clout to erect the
new megaplexes are also the largest owners of the fading
multiplexes, companies like AMC and Loews tend to be bearing the
brunt of the forces they themselves have unleashed. And while
analysts predict that the strongest exhibitors will survive the
theater industry's transition from shoe boxes to showcases, few
expect the recovery to be swift or smooth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will take another two years before the investments pay
off,'' predicted Christopher Dixon, a media analyst at Paine
Webber, who has been bearish on the exhibitor stocks for the past
two years.
</P>
<P>
   Scrambling to respond to the public's overwhelming preference
for megaplexes, the big theatre chains are attempting to convert
multiplexes to megaplexes whenever and wherever they can. Many of
the old multiplexes, however, simply cannot be revamped _
especially within shopping malls where there may be little
flexibility to expand floor plans and raise ceilings for
stadium-style layouts, which require at least twice the height of a
conventional theater. In such cases exhibitors may seek to sell the
theaters, keep marginally productive theaters open while waiting
for their leases to expire or simply close the theatres and take
write-offs while building new megaplexes elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   But none of this is happening fast enough to reduce the current
glut of movie screens _ 34,160 throughout the United States. That's
approximately one for every 8,000 people in the nation, notes
Sumner M. Redstone, who is chairman of the entertainment company
Viacom Inc. The number of movie tickets sold annually has risen 40
percent since 1988, to a current rate of 1.4 billion each year.
Unfortunately for exhibitors, the number of screens has increased
even more so _ by 47 percent during that same period.
</P>
<P>
   Redstone, who also personally owns the private exhibition
company National Amusements, with some 1,300 screens, says that the
United States has become ``overscreened.'' That is why, even as
National Amusements has joined the megaplex mania in this country,
it is also busily building theaters in less glutted markets like
Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   For similar reasons, virtually every American movie exhibition
company is investing overseas. GC Companies, for example, already
has theaters in Mexico and has formed an alliance with Hoyts Cinema
Group for new megaplexes in Argentina, Brazil and Chile.
</P>
<P>
   But with the United States remaining the core market for
exhibitors, theater companies have little choice but to pour money
into the type of theaters that American audiences are now
demanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stadium seating is a breakthrough in the industry,'' Redstone
said. ``Where we have built them, we are doubling and tripling our
business. For example, in Cincinnati, where we have a 20-screen
stadium seating complex, we are doing three to four times as much
business as we did a year ago, before we converted the multiplex.''
</P>
<P>
   The megaplexing of America is generally agreed to have begun in
1994 when AMC Entertainment, the nation's largest publicly owned
theater chain _ or ``circuit,'' in industry parlance _ opened a
megaplex in Dallas, called the Grand. Built after extensive
interviews with moviegoers, the Grand was immediately successful
and yielded a basic formula that has been widely copied since: 14
or more screens, stadium seating, arm rests that hold drinks and
can be tilted up to convert individual seats into a cozy love-seat
tandem, a digital sound system and a ceiling-to-floor, wall-to-wall
screen.
</P>
<P>
   Such luxurious viewing does not come cheap, though. For Loews,
which is building megaplexes with as many as 24 screens and more
than 3,000 seats, the construction cost is $1 million a screen _
which does not include the cost of buying or leasing the land. That
compares with an old multiplex with eight to 12 screens, perhaps
2,500 seats and a construction cost of about $600,000 a screen.
Loews says that 432 of its screens _ or about a quarter of the
company's U.S. total _ are now in megaplexes and that within the
next few years the majority of its screens will be in these new
supercinemas.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of Loews, Laurence Ruisi, says that this fast-track
construction schedule accounts for his company's poor results for
fiscal 1999, which ended in February. Loews reported a net loss of
$5.9 million on sales of $851 million. Though cash flow _ earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization _ was
positive at $144.2 million, Loews reported its loss on revenue of
$851 million. And Ruisi predicted that it might be two more years
before the company returned to profitability.
</P>
<P>
   But at that point, he promises, Loews' business will be better
than ever. ``The megaplexes are much more profitable for us,''
Ruisi said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Redstone, too, describes the new-theater boom as a business for
long-term players with deep pockets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reward is terrific, but the capital costs are enormous,''
he said. ``In Revere, Mass., we have the largest-grossing National
theater in New England. We are tearing it down, and we are spending
about $20 million to build a new 20-screen stadium-seat theater.''
</P>
<P>
   A theater chain that does not protect its turf with a megaplex
risks losing business, Redstone said, citing research by National
Amusements indicating that audiences will bypass a multiplex closer
to home to see a film at a megaplex that is farther away.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not always the case that for each new theater complex
built another is torn down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is building new screens, and the old screens are not
coming off line as quickly as expected,'' said Marina Jacobson, who
follows the movie exhibition business for the investment firm of
Bear, Stearns.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Take the case of the new Loews megaplex on Second Avenue at East
32nd Street in Manhattan. The company already owned a three-screen
multiplex two blocks away on East 34th Street when it broke ground
for the megaplex. Last year, Loews sold the 34th Street multiplex
to Clearview Cinemas. That came in response to a ruling from the
Justice Department's antitrust division that Loews' acquisition of
a separate big theater chain, Cineplex Odeon, had given the company
too many theaters in Manhattan. As a result of the transfer of the
34th Street property to Clearview, Loews' new megaplex is competing
with a multiplex virtually around the corner.
</P>
<P>
   So far, though, it appears that the Loews megaplex that is
drawing the crowds _ and the new releases. While the Loews lineup
last week had a full complement of hits and recently released
block-buster hopefuls (including ``South Park,'' ``Wild, Wild
West,'' ``Big Daddy,'' ``Tarzan,'' ``Austin Powers,'' ``Summer of
Sam'' and ``The General's Daughter'') the nearby Clearview
multiplex had only three movies, whose popularity crested weeks
ago: ``Notting Hill,'' ``Walk on the Moon,'' and ``The Red
Violin.''
</P>
<P>
   The industry's ``overscreening'' gives an advantage to
distributors, the middlemen who take Hollywood's films and
apportion them among the exhibitors. Distributors and exhibitors
divide the box-office gross, with the theater owners getting
perhaps only 10 percent of the take when a film first opens but
keeping an increasingly larger percentage of receipts the longer
the film runs.
</P>
<P>
   Using time-honored formulas that vary slightly depending on who
has the most leverage, the exhibitors and distributors generally
aim for a 50-50 split over the film's entire run. Right now,
though, the leverage is clearly with the distributors, which not
only have greater leeway than in the past to pick and choose among
local theaters but can also dictate tougher terms. Thus 20th
Century Fox, a News Corp. subsidiary, has been able to demand a
formula that may allow it to keep a 52 percent share of the take
from exhibitors with whom it has favored copies of its block-buster
``Star Wars.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Alan Gould, an movie industry analyst for the
investment firm of Gerard Klauer Mattison, was bullish on the
theater-chain companies. Now, though, he has lowered his earnings
estimates for the entire group.
</P>
<P>
   ``We simply didn't realize how fast the cash flow from the
multiplexes would decay,'' Gould said. ``It has been a forced
cannibalization. Now, if someone plops down a megaplex, it gets the
best movies and the best attendance.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   For AMC, Loews and the other megaplex builders, the big issue
now is getting rid of their aging multiplexes as quickly as
feasible. In many cases, long-term leases at shopping malls and
other locations means swallowing big write-offs when the older
cinemas take early retirement.
</P>
<P>
   And the alternative of selling the complexes no longer seems as
easy as it was as recently as a year ago, when several financial
players were still gobbling up theaters. Two leveraged buyout
firms, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Hicks, Muse, Tate &AMP; Furst, for
example, jointly acquired several chains, now called Regal Cinemas.
But they are no longer aggressively buying up properties, and
analysts see little hope that other big buyout firms will enter the
theater market.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they thought that if they could lead a consolidation
in the industry, they would have more clout in negotiating terms of
the film studios for movies; but that didn't happen,'' said one
movie studio analyst, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But this industry melodrama may yet have a happy ending _ at
least for the companies with the financing to build megaplexes. To
control their own costs, Hollywood studios are trying _ or so they
claim _ to cut back on the number of films they produce each year.
Fewer movies would give each new release a better chance of getting
more screen time, with the longer runs that favor the exhibitors.
</P>
<P>
   If that trend bears out, and as the least profitable multiplexes
are gradually phased out, some analysts expect a return to good
times for the theater chains. Michael Wolff, who heads the media
consulting business at Booz Allen &AMP; Hamilton, predicts that running
movie theaters will be an attractive business once the rebuilding
is finished.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not comparable to other high-growth industries, but
they are a reliable, steady cash-flow business,'' Wolff said. ``I
think the megaplexes will become major entertainment centers.''

`THE PROSECUTION': SHREWD AND ON THE SIDE OF JUSTICE, OR SO HE
THOUGHT

 By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   How can people tell lies in public and continue to live with
themselves? This question _ not irrelevant to recent public
discourse in the United States _ troubles Joseph Antonelli, the
narrator of D.W. Buffa's absorbing new legal thriller, ``The
Prosecution.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have not always told the truth in my life, but I never lied
in a court of law, and I spent years defending murderers and
rapists and thieves,'' muses Antonelli, ruefully recalling why he
gave up being a criminal defense lawyer at the end of Buffa's
explosive first novel, ``The Defense.''
</P>
<P>
   He continues: ``I did not need to lie; the law itself allowed me
to make certain that people who should have been punished were set
free. I had wanted to be a lawyer who never lost a case because
every client was innocent; instead I became a lawyer whose only
concern was preventing anyone from ever proving that my client was
guilty.''
</P>
<P>
   But now, at the start of Buffa's new novel, Antonelli is being
urged by his old friend Judge Horace Woolner, a former district
attorney of their hometown of Portland, Ore., to come out of his
secluded retirement. Woolner has a case for Antonelli. It seems
that one Travis Quentin, ``a guy'' who ``was arrested for a double
homicide down in Los Angeles'' offered to tell about another murder
if his sentence would be reduced to life instead of the death
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   The story that Quentin then told concerned the unsolved rape and
murder in a hotel room two years earlier of Nancy Goodwin, the
pregnant wife of Marshall Goodwin, the present chief deputy
district attorney of Portland. According to Quentin's testimony, he
had been hired by Goodwin to commit the murder as part of a plea
bargain deal on a drug case in Portland. The crime was committed
while Goodwin was prosecuting a murder, which gave him a perfect
alibi. Woolner wants Antonelli to look into Quentin's story, and
then, if he believes it, to accept an appointment as special
prosecutor and go after Goodwin.
</P>
<P>
   Antonelli bites. He loves Woolner and Woolner's wife, Alma;
admires him for overcoming the adversity of being black and having
had both his legs blown off in battle and shares his concern that a
public figure could be living a lie. He interviews Quentin in
prison and learns among other things the identity of the woman who
allegedly handed Quentin the envelope containing Goodwin's
instructions: Kristin Maxfield, another prosecutor, whom Goodwin
married a year after his wife's death. Antonelli confronts Goodwin
over lunch, forces his indictment and goes to trial.
</P>
<P>
   There follows an electrically charged courtroom drama complete
with an opposing attorney you love to hate, a feisty black judge
who treats everyone in her court like kindergarten cutups and a
surprising outcome. But the results leave Antonelli dissatisfied
and wondering about fairness and whether the complete truth has
come out. Unspoken but very much on the reader's mind is the
question of why Woolner pushed Antonelli so hard to take on the
case in the first place. And how is the Woolners' fancy social life
connected to the story, especially Alma's role as a board member of
Portland's ballet company?
</P>
<P>
   Then, as occurred in Buffa's previous novel, a second murder
case surprisingly explodes, which not only shocks Antonelli, but
also changes his take on the first case. His world goes spinning
out of control.
</P>
<P>
   Several flaws mar ``The Prosecution.'' The trickiness of the
plot's many twists and reversals borders on contrivance. The
picture of Antonelli in retirement reading Aristotle is hard to
believe and somehow lends a sententiousness to his many
pronouncements. (``Like time itself, the law stops for no one.'')
And the big surprise of the outcome falls far short of the genuine
shock of the final twist in ``The Defense.''
</P>
<P>
   All the same, the authentic courtroom scenes leave one with the
sense that Buffa, who for 10 years worked in Oregon as a defense
attorney, has more to say about the law than the usual lawyer
turned novelist. (``What you really have going on out there,''
remarks Woolner with typical acuteness about one charismatic
lawyer's power to intimidate, ``are a bunch of weak-willed lawyers
and feebleminded judges too scared of what they don't know to have
any idea of what to do with someone who pretends he does.'')
</P>
<P>
   More important, the novel's exploration of the theme of lying
lends it a resonance that continues to play on the reader's mind.
At first, Antonelli deplores what he sees as a widespread loss of
moral equilibrium. ``There's something Nietzsche wrote,'' he
complains: `` `The morning paper has replaced the morning prayer.'
People used to believe in God, in a moral code that never changed;
now no one believes in anything except that everything is always
changing and nothing is always either right or wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   But as the novel's deeper truths unfold, Antonelli comes to
recognize that in fact the truth is often ambiguous and that even
the best of us must sometimes live a lie.

   DEER-TICK-SUMMER _ While deer tick populations are notoriously

Notwithstanding the introduction this year of a new vaccine, the

TOO FEW VIEWERS FOR `HOCKENBERRY'  
 NEWS MEDIA'S EYE TURNS MORE TO CHILDREN  
 TIME EDITOR CHALLENGES CONTENT OF BRILL'S 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Bylines follow individual items.)  
(lb) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the pinball-fast world of cable news, where stories,
correspondents and schedules are constantly changing, it takes
something special to stand out. A host with a strong identity who
attracts a regular following _ liie CNN's Larry King _ has
tremendous value, especially in prime time, where the
highest-priced advertising is mined.
</P>
<P>
   That fact of life seems to be the real reason behind MSNBC's
decision last week to cancel John Hockenberry's 10 p.m. talk show,
``Hockenberry.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that Hockenberry _ an experienced, Emmy-award-winning
journalist with obvious intelligence _ did not have a distinctive
personality. But after six months on the air he had too few
viewers, and NBC has someone ready to replace him whose audience is
twice the size of Hockenberry's.
</P>
<P>
   That person is Chris Matthews, the host of ``Hardball with Chris
Matthews,'' a high-decibel interview show at 8 p.m. weeknights on
CNBC, the business-news channel that is MSNBC's sibling in the NBC
News family. It regularly attracts 400,000 to 500,000 viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Matthews' show is vulnerable because the Nasdaq stock market has
decided to add an evening trading session, and when it does _ the
time frame is still undecided _ CNBC will continue its market
coverage into the evening.
</P>
<P>
   So NBC News executives had the idea to move Matthews' show to
MSNBC, which could use a ratings boost. In prime time, MSNBC has
seen the smaller Fox News Channel nipping at its heels, and even in
recent weeks surpassing MSNBC in the prime-time Nielsen ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Hockenberry, who is also a correspondent for ``Dateline NBC''
(where his reports reach 15 million or more people, compared with
the 200,000 or so he reached on MSNBC) was told that his MSNBC show
would be canceled because the network wanted to ``move in another
direction,'' Hockenberry said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was disappointed and very surprised,'' Hockenberry said.
Referring to the Kosovo crisis, which pumped up all the cable news
networks' Nielsen ratings from late March through mid-May, he said,
``All our numbers fell away after the war ended; it wasn't just
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Hockenberry's show often beat its Fox News Channel
counterpart, ``The Crier Report,'' in that 10 p.m. time slot.
</P>
<P>
   MSNBC spokesmen, speaking not for attribution, mentioned the
Matthews scenario, and said NBC News executives saw the move as a
``win-win'' situation: ``Dateline'' would have Hockenberry back
full time and MSNBC would get the benefit of Matthews' audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's true that I'm very happy to be back at `Dateline,' which
is a great place to work,'' Hockenberry said. ``But look, they
didn't come to me and say, `John, ``Dateline'' really needs you _
can you give up your show?' I have to be honest about that.''

   News Media's Eye Turns More to Children
</P>
<P>
   Children have gone from being a very low priority on the
coverage lists of major national newspapers and television news
networks to being a modest priority, according to a two-part study
released last week. And when children appear in news reports, it is
less often as victims or perpetrators of crimes than was the case
five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Kunkel, an associate professor of communication at the
University of California at Santa Barbara, who conducted the
analysis for Children Now, an Oakland-based research and advocacy
group, saw two ``stereotype-busters'' in the latest results.
</P>
<P>
   ``It counters the stereotype that the only way kids get in the
news is in stories about crime and violence,'' Kunkel said. Such
articles and programs accounted for 23 percent of the total about
children, compared with 40 percent five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It also contradicts the stereotype that you're more likely to
see a person of color in a crime and violence story,'' he said.
``In coverage of minority children as compared to children as a
whole, there were fewer stories about crime and violence in the
ethnic-minority part of the sample, and that was not true in the
past.''
</P>
<P>
   The study examined news coverage in five newspapers _ The New
York Times, The Los Angeles Times, The Chicago Tribune, The Atlanta
Constitution and The Houston Chronicle _ in November 1998, and the
coverage on the evening news broadcasts of ABC, CBS and NBC in the
same month. The earlier study was done in November 1993, and
reported in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 analysis found a 37 percent increase in the number of
newspaper articles about children (an average of 6.3 per edition)
and no change in the amount of television time devoted to children
by the ABC, CBS or NBC evening news broadcasts (there were fewer
programs, but more time spent on each).
</P>
<P>
   ``The growth in the number of child-related stories is accounted
for by stories on health and safety issues,'' Kunkel said, ``and by
cultural stories like teens as trend-setters, or how kids use the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   His study was done before the Littleton, Colo., school
shootings. But he said that ``one can't necessarily assume the
patterns the study identified will be altered significantly'' by
the shootings.

   Time Editor Challenges the Content of Brill's
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday afternoon, several dozen reporters, television
producers, newspaper editors and columnists found themselves
staring at a blistering letter, sent to them by Norman Pearlstine,
editor in chief of Time Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The 25-page packet, dated July 8, was a point-by-point rebuttal
of an article in the July/August 1999 issue of Brill's Content,
``Time on Big Sugar,'' which dismantled an article by Donald L.
Barlett and James B. Steele about corporate welfare.
</P>
<P>
   The Time article was critical of the Fanjul family, which owns
Flo-Sun Inc., one of the United States' largest sugar growers, and
was part of a series in Time magazine by Barlett and Steele that
won a National Magazine Award and a George Polk Award for the
magazine earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Pearlstine's language concerning the magazine and its founder,
Steven Brill, was tart. The article criticizing the Time article,
he wrote, ``seriously undermined your own legitimacy as a media
critic'' _ but he made special note of Brill's ``lengthy
professional relationship with Joseph R. Klock Jr., the general
counsel for Flo-Sun and the Fanjul family's other sugar
interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Pearlstine pointed out that Klock incorporated and represented
several of Brill's Florida companies, including ``Am-Law Florida
Enterprises Inc., Am-Law Miami Review Inc. and Am-Law Lee Car Sales
Inc. In addition, Klock has served as a panelist on seminars
sponsored by The American Lawyer when you owned that publication.''
</P>
<P>
   Brill said he was undisturbed by the allegations, and said that
Klock last represented him 14 years ago. He referred to the packet
as ``this letter and a 22-page ridiculous attachment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing there,'' he said. ``The stuff about the
lawyer is just hilarious. Someone who represented me 14 years ago
and I am somehow in his pocket? I have bigger conflicts with Time
Warner.'' He said Walter Isaacson, Time's managing editor, is a
good friend and so is Pearlstine.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Brill has posted a five-page response to
Pearlstine's 22-page rebuttal on the Web page of Brill's Content
(Brillscontent.com).

SENATOR BLOCKING U.N. NOMINATION BLAMES ALBRIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Iowa, Miss., Ky., Ohio, S.D.) (mk) 
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A senator who is blocking a final Senate vote on
Richard Holbrooke's nomination to be chief American diplomat at the
United Nations asserted Sunday that Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright was directly responsible for the delay because of her
treatment of a State Department employee described as a
whistle-blower.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, said that Albright ``bears
responsibility for the retaliatory treatment of this
whistle-blower'' and that the secretary ``is the cause of the delay
with regard to my hold on the nomination.''
</P>
<P>
   His statement, which was made public Sunday, appeared to be an
effort to step up the pressure on the State Department to reach a
settlement with the employee, Linda Shenwick, by labeling Albright
as personally responsible for the latest delay in Holbrooke's
confirmation.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department had no immediate comment on the statement.
</P>
<P>
   Grassley is one of at least four Republican senators who have
exercised their right under arcane Senate rules to place a ``hold''
on Holbrooke's long-stalled nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional officials say that at least two other Republican
senators, Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, and Mitch
McConnell of Kentucky, are blocking a final vote on the nomination
as a bargaining chip to persuade the White House to appoint a
conservative Ohio law professor to the Federal Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate minority leader, Tom Daschle, D-S.D., said Sunday
that Holbrooke ``is being held hostage, and in the worst fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, it's almost an embarrassing fashion right now,'' he
said on the NBC News program ``Meet the Press.'' ``That's got to
end. We've got to fill that position. Let's send an ambassador to
the United Nations. Let's do our job.''
</P>
<P>
   In a separate appearance on the program, Lott said, ``I suspect
that the nomination of Holbrooke to go to the U.N. will be
confirmed.'' But he also acknowledged Grassley's hold on the
process and said that he also expected his favored appointee to the
election commission, Bradley Smith, to be confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Grassley's ``hold'' relates not to the veteran diplomat's
qualifications but instead to the State Department's treatment of
Ms. Shenwick, who was recently removed from her post as a budget
specialist at the American mission to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``My position on the Holbrooke nominatIon remains firm,''
Grassley said. ``The price for lifting the hold is for the
department to negotiate in good faith with Linda Shenwick. The
State Department has a very weak case in refusing to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. George Voinovich, R-Ohio, announced last week that he, too,
had placed a ``hold'' on Holbrooke's nomination because he wanted
to review the veteran diplomat's leading role in the Clinton
administration's Balkans policy.

 By BOB TEDESCHI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   While the e-commerce engine has been warming up in recent
months, it remains fueled largely by the wallets of affluent men
and computer geeks. That fuel, however, is about to receive a
powerful additive: X chromosomes.
</P>
<P>
   Women are joining the Internet more quickly than ever, nearly
erasing the gap among the medium's 92 million users. Perhaps more
significant for the Internet economy, though, is the fact that the
percentage of World Wide Web shoppers who are women has jumped the
last 12 months, to 38 percent from 29 percent, according to a
Commercenet/Nielsen Media Research study. Industry executives
expect that presence to rise quickly in the next year, bringing
with it new opportunities in several categories and expanding
e-commerce as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   ``The early part of the E-commerce revolution was a revolution
of rich white males,'' said Katherine Borsecnik, senior vice
president for strategic business at America Online. ``That's
changing. And with 80 to 85 percent of household spending
controlled by women, the total retail dollars involved in that
change is very high.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the immediate impact of that change will be felt in
traditional female retail strongholds, said Fiona Swerdlow, an
analyst with Jupiter Communications, the Internet research firm.
Ms. Swerdlow forecasts that categories like apparel, health and
beauty and toys will particularly benefit from a growing presence
of women shoppers _ meaning sites like those for Gap, Lands' End,
Estee Lauder's Clinique, eToys and Toys ``R'' Us should benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Not only will these categories benefit from first-time buyers,
executives said, but they will also reap the fruits of higher
spending from more experienced female Internet shoppers. Indeed,
according to a survey by NFO Interactive conducted last week, women
who shopped on the Internet in the last year said they planned to
spend 20 percent more online in the next year. The survey gathered
responses from 880 U.S. Internet users _ 437 of whom were women _
who said they had bought goods over the Web in the last 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   Travel and apparel are the most favored purchasing categories
for female Internet shoppers, according to the survey. Women
shoppers responding to the survey said they planned to spend, on
average, $965 on travel and $783 on apparel online, respectively,
on those categories in the next year.
</P>
<P>
   The other online categories with the greatest growth potential
among repeat buyers, according to NFO, include sports and fitness _
on which the women in the survey said they planned to spend an
average of 71 percent more this year than last. Others were food
and drink (a projected spending increase of 27 percent), apparel
and accessories (24 percent) and home and garden (13 percent).
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always said the Internet would take off when women came
online, and it's true,'' said Marleen McDaniel, chief executive of
Women.com, which offers information, shopping and advertising
directed toward women. Women.com has catered to what Ms. McDaniel
called characteristic shopping behavior among women _ in
particular, a propensity to gather a great deal of information
before making a purchase. ``Women are avid consumers of
information, and shopping is their passion,'' Ms. McDaniel said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Given that assumption, the site provides ``tons of original
content,'' she said, which women can use to make buying decisions.
``We'll have an article on echinacea, within the subject of healing
herbs,'' Ms. McDaniel said. ``So we'll have a link next to it for
colds, and what about echinacea makes it a remedy. Adjacent to
that, we'll have an ad for a pharmacy that sells it. Then users can
go to the community section of our site and ask a nutritionist, a
woman doctor, when to take it. For advertisers, it's fantastic
because you're catching a consumer right in flight.''
</P>
<P>
   The payoff is apparent in the site's shopping figures, Ms.
McDaniel said. According to (AT)Plan, an Internet research firm, 51
percent of Women.com's audience had made purchases on the Internet
in the last six months, more than 10 percentage points higher than
the average for women online.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers are also using gender-specific approaches to cash in
on perceived differences in shopping behavior. ``We do a lot of
things to skew toward women,'' said Steve Hamlin, vice president of
iQVC, which is the online arm of Comcast Corp.'s QVC home-shopping
TV channel and whose clientele is 70 percent female. ``Women enjoy
the experience of shopping more than men, and are more willing to
look at content and browse the site.''
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, he said, areas of the site like the jewelry
section and the wedding boutique include more editorial content and
advisory features than, for instance, the area devoted to sporting
goods.
</P>
<P>
   Hamlin also said that the site had seen a significant rise in
computer electronics purchases by women since it began selling
prebundled systems. ``Women generally feel less confident when
making these kinds of purchases,'' he said, ``so they're more
comfortable knowing that a certain scanner goes with a certain
computer.''
</P>
<P>
   Other sites take a more gender-neutral approach. Fingerhut, the
Federated Department Stores subsidiary that wholly or partly owns
several Web sites, including Andy's Garage and Mountainzone.com,
``doesn't spend a lot of time looking at gender,'' said Andy
Johnson, senior vice president for market development, even though
65 percent of Fingerhut's Internet shoppers are women. ``We're
trying to create processes to serve individual customers as much as
they want, no matter their gender.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Borsecnik, of America Online, takes a similar view. ``A vast
majority of what we do has nothing to do with gender,'' she said,
noting that roughly 50 percent of the company's shoppers are women.
``Our approach is more of a translation of what works offline to
the online world.''
</P>
<P>
   Because some retail categories that tend to attract women have
not yet developed fully online, the gender impact may not be felt
immediately, Ms. Borsecnik noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Categories like house and garden hardly register among online
shoppers, but offline, 25 to 30 percent of all purchases fall into
that,'' she said. By contrast, Ms. Borsecnik said, music CDs
account for 13 percent of all purchases made on America Online,
while ``music has to be less than 2 percent of offline purchases.''
</P>
<P>
   The growth in women shoppers may speed the maturation process
for categories like house and garden, as companies rush to market _
once they know the dollars are there. At the same time, Ms.
Borsecnik said, many merchants are already setting up shop in hopes
that doing so will give a greater number of women reason to log on,
ready to spend. ``There's still an element,'' she said, ``of `build
it and they will come.'''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Leaving a life-tenured federal judgeship for a
two-year term on the international war crimes tribunal in The
Hague, Patricia Wald is setting out, at age 70, on her next great
adventure.
</P>
<P>
   It may seem a long leap from her paneled chambers at the end of
a quiet corridor in the federal courthouse here, where
administrative procedure and the intricacies of sentencing
guidelines are the staples of an often arcane appellate docket, to
life as one of 14 judges from 14 countries charged with devising a
collective legal response to large-scale brutality in the former
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   But Judge Wald, who will retire this fall after 20 years on the
District of Columbia U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, has taken leaps
before. The first woman ever to serve on the appeals court, she
still remembers her job search in New York in the spring of 1951,
as she was about to graduate near the top of her class from Yale
Law School.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really a shame,'' a partner of one fancy firm told the
young Patricia McGowan after inspecting her credentials. ``If only
you could have been here last week.'' Seeing the law student's
puzzled expression, the partner continued, with no further
explanation necessary: ``We hired a woman last week.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge Wald was at the leading edge of a generation of women that
included Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg,
roughly her contemporaries, who entered the legal profession in the
decade after World War II and found themselves in uncharted
territory, unwelcoming if not downright hostile.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had very little expectation of what would become of us,''
Joan Bernstein, Judge Wald's law school roommate and now director
for consumer protection at the Federal Trade Commission, said the
other day.
</P>
<P>
   In Judge Wald's chambers, along with pictures of her eight
grandchildren, hangs a photo of the 1950-51 Yale Law Journal staff:
the two roommates, prim female visions of the early 1950s,
surrounded by two dozen classmates in suits and ties.
</P>
<P>
   Each woman found her own way through the wilderness. In Judge
Wald's case, it was a mixture of the traditional and the
untraditional. She was an only child raised by a single mother in
an extended family of factory workers in the old mill town of
Torrington, Conn. No one in her family had ever been to college,
but her relatives recognized her gifts and supported her ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   She married a classmate, Robert Wald, who will join her in The
Hague and commute to his law firm's London office. Theirs was an
unconventional match for its time: he is Jewish, she Irish
Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way, the absence of tradition was the absence of
restraint,'' Judge Wald said during a conversation last week in her
chambers.
</P>
<P>
   The only lawyer she had met as a child was a classmate's father,
a local judge. While she heard there was a female lawyer not far
away in Bridgeport, she had never met one. But she had an idea of
what lawyers did. Several of her relatives were involved in labor
union activities in the Torrington brass mills, where she worked
during the summers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew how important the lawyer was to the union,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   After law school, she got a highly prized clerkship for Judge
Jerome Frank of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, one of the
most prominent federal judges of his time. Calling her the best law
clerk he had ever had, Frank, who sat in New Haven, Conn., helped
her get a job in Washington with the law firm now known as Arnold &AMP;
Porter.
</P>
<P>
   Then came babies _ five in seven years (no twins), who as adults
are scattered from Washington to Boston and as far west as Denver.
For 11 years, she was essentially a full-time mother, with
occasional consulting positions on task forces and commissions on
such topics as a bail reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always assumed the time would come that I would go back to
work,'' she says now. ``I just wasn't sure how or when.''
</P>
<P>
   Her timing, the late 1960s, coincided with the birth of
public-interest law, and she handled a series of cutting-edge cases
on the rights of women, children, and poor people for the local
legal-services organization and the Center on Law and Social
Policy, a pioneering public interest law firm here.
</P>
<P>
   It was a public career of increasing visibility that led her to
a position as an assistant attorney general in the administration
of President Jimmy Carter and from there to the appeals court. She
served as the court's chief judge from 1986 to 1991 and has written
820 published opinions.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Wald was an obvious choice for a job in the Clinton
administration, and she was briefly in the news for twice taking
herself out of consideration to be attorney general. From her years
in the Justice Department, ``I knew the job,'' she says now, ``and
I knew how large the political component was _ it was just not the
right job for me.''
</P>
<P>
   But the job on the International Criminal Tribunal for the
Former Yugoslavia, for which she was recommended by the State
Department, is another story. Throughout her career, she has held
fast to the liberal view of the Constitution as an engine of social
progress, an idea that often seems anachronistic in today's
conservative judicial climate in the United States but that is a
fresh ideal to many in Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Since the early 1990s, Judge Wald has made almost a second
career out of helping the new Eastern European democracies build
their legal systems. She has made 15 trips to the region _
including one last year to Belgrade, Yugoslavia _ many under the
auspices of the American Bar Association's Central and East
European Law Initiative.
</P>
<P>
   She has monitored elections, advised on setting up court systems
and reviewed new constitutions. Helping the tribunal construct a
new system of international justice is a logical next step.
</P>
<P>
   ``To get beyond the high abstractions of the rule of law has
been immensely interesting,'' she said, reflecting on the
challenges and rewards of her recent involvement. ``Sitting around
a table with homemade vodka and writing a constitution bring a kind
of intimacy to the constitutional process that we've long since
left behind us here.''

FANTASY TALE OF AN ORPHANED WIZARD IS A SURPRISE BEST SELLER 
</HEADLINE>
 (nk) 
 By EDEN ROSS LIPSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hannibal Lecter and Harry Potter are shaping up as the summer's
must reads. Harry who?
</P>
<P>
   Hannibal the cannibal is the title character of Thomas Harris'
grisly new novel who has appeared in two previous novels and two
movies. So his place atop the best-seller lists is predictable.
</P>
<P>
   But riding broomstick high, right behind the ghoulish Dr.
Lecter, is Harry Potter, an orphan wizard with unruly hair and a
lightning scar on his forehead. This unusually adept pupil at
Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry is the hero of two
wildly successful British children's novels by J.R. Rowling.
</P>
<P>
   Last week there were 826,000 copies in print of the first novel,
``Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,'' and some 915,000 of the
second, ``Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,'' which was
published on June 2. At bedtime, at the beach, by the pool, in the
back of the car, whole families are reading about the boarding
school where the food is delicious and the equipment list includes
a wand and cauldron.
</P>
<P>
   The Potter books are an international phenomenon; in two years
the first has been published in 115 countries in 25 languages. The
headline in the British newspaper The Guardian on Thursday
proclaimed, ``Hannibal eaten for breakfast by 13-year-old.'' The
article said that 24 hours before publication of the third book,
``Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,'' with a first printing
of 240,000, it had surpassed ``Hannibal'' on the Amazon.com.uk
charts.
</P>
<P>
   The book went on sale 15 minutes after school ended that
afternoon to stampedes of children going from schoolyards to
stores. Scholastic Press, the American publisher, plans a national
release of that book here on Sept. 7, the day after Labor Day.
British wholesalers have been reminded of the territorial rights of
British publishers and told not to sell ``Azkaban'' abroad. But as
was the case this spring when the second book was available only in
Britain, and e-commerce bypassed copyright, many American readers
and bookstores have already ordered copies directly or on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   All winter and spring teachers and librarians marveled at the
speed with which children, particularly ``reluctant readers,''
embraced ``Sorcerer's Stone.'' But the biggest surprise, based on
anecdotal evidence, may be the books' combined power to bring boys
back to reading. Calls to sleep-away camps for children aged 8 to
15 around the United States early this month suggest that roughly a
third of the children had already read them.
</P>
<P>
   Bill McMahon, director of Camp Moosilauke, in Orford, N.H., said
ordinarily boys tend to ``leave reading a little behind'' at camp,
though they read every night. This summer, he said, ``we are seeing
them in the hammock at free time and down at the beach with the
books.'' He noted that European campers there had packed their own
editions.
</P>
<P>
   The boys' enthusiasm for Harry Potter is spilling over into
other books, many booksellers and librarians say. They cite, for
example, ``Holes'' by Louis Sachar (Frances Foster Books/Farrar
Straus &AMP; Giroux). This adventure story about Stanley Yelnats
(admittedly certified in adult eyes because it is the winner of the
1998 National Book Award and the 1999 Newbery Medal, the highest
award for a children's book) is selling at nearly twice the
expected rate, more than 190,000 copies in five months. At Barnes &AMP;
Noble, said Steven Geck, the children's buyer, other hardcover
fiction for middle-grade readers, especially boys, is selling
strongly as well.
</P>
<P>
   American girls, for the most part, have always been readers,
have loved series and have been receptive to suggestions for the
next book. Boys have always found alternatives to reading: think
Tom Sawyer. But adult concern for reinforcing boys' reading skills
has intensified in recent years as alternative temptations have
burgeoned to include Pokemon, Play Station, computer games or the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hardy Boys'' and the baseball novels of John R. Tunis
notwithstanding, the last title genuinely popular with boys, as
opposed to one foisted on them by adults, was probably ``Hatchet,''
Gary Paulsen's realistic 1987 novel about a boy stranded for 54
days in the Canadian wilderness. The book and its sequels remain
popular paperback titles.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the '90s boys read the paperback ``Goosebumps''
series avidly, but, as Clifford Wohl, a former children's
bookseller, put it: ``You couldn't get them off that dime. You
couldn't say, `Here's another scary book you might like.' No. They
only wanted `Goosebumps.' It was like a fence, and the boys were
trapped within the series.''
</P>
<P>
   But word of mouth, not to mention placement in the front of
bookstores because of the best-seller status, has made the Potter
books a crossover phenomenon. They are now attracting adult readers
here pretty much as they did in Britain, where the second book
topped the best-seller lists last year.
</P>
<P>
   Sally Lodge of Wellesley, Mass., said: ``I've been a mother for
almost 18 years, and never in my parenting career have all three of
my children read and even fought over the same book. But then my
husband started the first book at the same time the 11-year-old was
reading it, and he wanted it reserved for him. So he hid it under
his pillow. But she found it.''
</P>
<P>
   Juliette Smith, a counselor at Camp Kamaji, a girls camp in Cass
Lake, Minn., is reading the first book to 8-year-olds, a chapter a
night. ``They are silent throughout,'' she said, ``and then say,
`Can we read some more?'''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Boarding school books have been a British export since ``Tom
Brown's Schooldays'' and fantasy worlds since J.R.R. Tolkien's
``Lord of the Rings.'' Contemporary writers successfully working
with witchcraft and parallel universes include Diana Wynne Jones
and Terry Pratchett, who said recently in The Sunday Times of
London that the British were major exporters of imaginary worlds.
</P>
<P>
   The great summer read in the United States 25 years ago, in fact
the best-selling adult novel for six months, was ``Watership
Down,'' by Richard Adams, a dense fantasy about a rabbit
civilization. A children's title in England, the novel was
considered so sophisticated here that it was published as an adult
book. Today it's a paperback popular on middle-school reading
lists.
</P>
<P>
   Although they are widely admired, and read, by adults, there has
been no confusion about the Potter books. Susan Hirschman, the
editor of Greenwillow Books, who bought ``Watership Down,'' says
that Ms. Rowling's achievement in the Potter books is: ``She never
breaks out of her voice. There's no Roald Dahl bark in the prose,
no adult asides.''
</P>
<P>
   The fantasy is firmly in the British tradition: The wizards live
by rules, hovering above England in a setting quite near reality
but not part of it and so clearly described that young readers can
map it. Hogwarts has required classes in charms and potions, name
tags on black robes and on pointed hats; the mail is delivered by
owls, and Harry stars in the spectacular airborne school sport
called Quidditch, riding his Nimbus 2000 broomstick. And of course
there are good and evil.
</P>
<P>
   The plot springs from the fact that Harry's parents were
murdered by the dark prince Voldemort, generally referred to as
``You Know Who.'' He and his legion disappeared during the years
Harry was in the care of his dreadful human relatives, the
Dursleys. Voldemort's followers are reappearing in pursuit of
Harry, and he lurks somewhere ahead in future books along with the
fevers of adolescence.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rowling said she imagined the character while riding on a
train. She planned seven books, one for each year of boarding
school, carrying Harry from just before his 11th birthday when he
is summoned to Hogwarts, to graduation. Several years later, while
she was an unemployed single mother on the dole, she sat in cafes
in Edinburgh writing the first novel in longhand while her infant
daughter napped beside her.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur A. Levine of Scholastic, an editor with a keen eye for
fantasy, bought the American rights to the first novel after
reading advance galleys of the British edition. It was a spirited
auction, and the price, $105,000, was the highest then paid for a
foreign children's novel.
</P>
<P>
   In consultation with the author Levine changed the title from
``Philosopher's Stone'' to ``Sorcerer's Stone'' and made small
editing changes that smoothed out differences in British and
American speech. He also added rich paper, a cover illustration and
decorative chapter illustrations.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Scholastic _ best known to adults for the paperback series ``The
Animorphs,'' ``Goosebumps,'' ``Baby Sitters Club'' and ``Fear
Street'' _ used the marketing strategies and techniques given to
promising adult fiction titles. Barbara Marcus, the executive vice
president of the book division, said the strategy included sending
nearly 2,000 advance copies to so-called ``big-mouth'' or
influential adults and children. Scholastic placed Harry Potter in
all its advertisements and in the fall and holiday catalogs,
invested in easel displays and posters and brought Ms. Rowling to
the United States. Independent booksellers in particular eagerly
``hand sold'' the book, recommending it to holiday shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   The first printing was 35,000, with a hefty marketing budget of
$100,000. Still, Diane Roback, children's editor of Publishers
Weekly, which gave ``Sorcerer's Stone'' a starred review and an
interview, says: ``Marketing can only go so far because it's
directed at adults. It's the incredible word of mouth among kids
that has blown this into a phenomenon.''
</P>
<P>
   Scholastic planned to bring out ``Chamber of Secrets'' in
September, a year after the first Harry Potter title, but large
numbers of books imported from England forced them to move up the
date and then to schedule ``Azkaban.'' Appearing in American stores
a week ahead of ``Hannibal,'' ``Chamber of Secrets'' spent a week
as No. 1 on the best-seller list in The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   Beth Peffer at the Bank Street College Book Store in Manhattan
thinks the almost immediate availability of the sequel helped
develop reader loyalty. Often there have been long intervals
between installments of many of the best loved American children's
books.
</P>
<P>
   Using the example of Jean Craighead George's ``Julie of the
Wolves,'' she pointed out: ``The original kids outgrew it before
the sequel came. We sold that to another generation entirely. But
here the sequel is being sold to the initial excitement.''
</P>
<P>
   A new ``Ramona'' book by Beverly Cleary will be published this
fall; the first was published in 1952, the last 15 years ago.
Compare that to three Harry Potter books in a year, something that
never occurs in adult publishing.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rowling, who will do an American book tour in October, is
off somewhere finishing the fourth book. In the future the novels
will be published simultaneously in all English-speaking countries.
</P>
<P>
   So where, cynical parents sated by ``Phantom Menace''
merchandise this summer must be wondering, is the movie? Where are
the toys? How can this be just a book? Warner Brothers has the film
and merchandise rights to the first book, but there will be a lull
before American children see their personal image of Harry replaced
by a face on a movie screen or have a chance to buy a certified
Nimbus 2000 broomstick.

seeking out ways that taxpayers' money is squandered. At a cost of
about $2 billion a year, investigators, auditors, inspector
generals and congressional overseers churn out a constant flow of

   BUSH-IOWA _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush _ king of fund raising,
pope of the polls _ heads to Iowa this week looking for support in
next month's GOP straw poll. It's a disproportionately important
event that looks little like democracy. Participants have to pay to
vote or get a candidate to pay for them to vote. And one group
planning on having a major impact at the event is none-too-thrilled
with Bush's middle-of-the-road position on abortion. The head of
the Iowa Christian Coalition says a ``supermajority'' of its
members want nothing to do with a candidate who won't vow to have
an anti-abortion running mate. (Herman, Austin American-Statesman)

PATENTS: CUTTING THE TIME TO RECHARGE COMPUTER BATTERIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas)  (lb) 
 By SABRA CHARTRAND   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lightweight, long-lasting batteries may be the Holy Grail of the
portable-computer industry. Anyone who used a first-generation
laptop in the early days of personal computing will remember toting
a 3-pound battery that lasted only a few hours. Since then,
batteries for laptop and hand-held computers, notebooks and
personal digital assistants have slimmed down considerably and
gained longevity. But even the best lithium ion batteries are
drained eventually.
</P>
<P>
   In pursuit of a solution to the enforced down time of battery
recharging, a designer for Compaq Computer Corp. in Houston looked
for a way to make the computer recharge its own batteries. He
settled on the keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   Adrian Crisan invented a keyboard embedded with magnets and
coils that spark an electric current each time a typist strikes a
key. The electricity is fed to a power generator, which in turn
charges a laptop battery. The more a person types, the more
electricity is fed to the battery charger.
</P>
<P>
   In his patent, Crisan said his invention ``can be used to
lengthen the operating period of the portable computer,'' or
alternatively, lighten the primary battery.
</P>
<P>
   The invention relies on magnets mounted on the stem of each key
of a keyboard, under the key cap. There might be one magnet per
key, but to increase the energy generated, Crisan recommends
several magnets per key.
</P>
<P>
   A number of coils are attached at one end to a printed circuit
board and at the other to each magnet. Depressing a key forces the
magnets to move over the coils. The movement generates an
electrical current. The current from all the keys is collected and
directed into a charge pump. The pump multiplies the voltage
received until it is higher than the voltage of the computer's
battery. This increased voltage is then fed into a battery charger
and transferred to a small secondary battery.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the small battery is discharged rather than the main
battery, the capacity of the main battery is conserved to allow the
portable personal computer to operate in an extended manner,''
Crisan wrote. His patent, 5,911,529, belongs to Compaq.
</P>
<P>
   Patents may be viewed on the Web at www.uspto.gov or may be
ordered through the mail, by patent number, for $3 from the Patent
and Trademark Office, Washington DC 20231.

CBS SEEKING DUAL PAYOFF ON ROCK SERIES
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Looking to enter what is becoming a growing secondary profit
center for television networks _ sales of music CDs tied to
programming _ CBS begins shooting this week on the most ambitious
music-oriented miniseries to date, ``Shake, Rattle, and Roll,'' a
four-hour film filled with original or little-known songs, some
composed by such famous names as Bob Dylan and Carole King, and
remakes of 1950s hits performed by a long roster of contemporary
singing stars.
</P>
<P>
   The show is a fictional account of a band's rise in the early
days of rock'n'roll. With talent ranging from blues artist B.B.
King to rhythm-and-blues singers K-Ci and JoJo, and Terence Trent
D'Arby, and rock performers like Blink 182 all signed to perform in
the show and on the soundtrack, CBS is looking for the ultimate
crossover appeal for the production, hitting both fans nostalgic
for the music of that era and young music fans who may be hearing
it for the first time,

<P>
   The network has deals in place with Seagram's MCA Records as
music partner and Phoenix Pictures as production partner and all
the parties are looking to cash in on a massive marketing plan
designed to sell the CD soundtrack album of the show, which CBS
will broadcast on Nov. 7.
</P>
<P>
   As Jeremy Hammond, the vice president and director of marketing
for MCA Records put it, ``If this show captures people's
imaginations the way we hope it will, with CBS pushing it on
television and MCA's marketing muscle behind it, we could sell
millions of CDs.''
</P>
<P>
   CBS also hopes to reach ratings that approach blockbuster status
and perhaps even bring in millions of younger viewers the networks
has had trouble reaching on a regular basis.
</P>
<P>
   The miniseries as music marketing tool became one of the favored
new genres of television networks last season when NBC scored in
both ratings and record sales with two music-oriented miniseries,
``The Temptations'' and ``The 60's.'' Both show were ratings hits
and both sold hundreds of thousands of CDs when NBC, a subsidiary
of General Electric, aggressively sold them through on-air pitches
and toll-free telephone numbers. ``The 60's'' became one of the
hottest albums in the country right after it was broadcast, selling
more than 400,000 copies.
</P>
<P>
   CBS noticed the potential as soon as it saw the ratings for
``The Temptations'' last November. It put ``Shake, Rattle and
Roll'' into development virtually the day that film was on the air,
and onto a fast track for production the day the ratings came in
for ``The 60's'' last February.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for the project started with one of the network's own
executives, Michael Wright, a vice president in the movie and
miniseries department. Wright, who said he had been a ``rock'n'roll
junkie my whole life'' was trying to think of a project that could
involve music and somehow appeal both to CBS's core audience of
mostly older viewers and the younger viewers the network would like
to reach.
</P>
<P>
   He came up with the notion of a love story of a young couple set
against the beginning days of rock'n'roll. They form a band known
as The Harleys and encounter both success and disappointment in
trying to forge a music career in those sometimes tempestuous days
of rapidly changing music.
</P>
<P>
   The key to getting the project off the ground, Wright said, was
securing the services of Spencer Proffer, a music industry veteran,
with producing and composing credits going back two decades and
connections to artists and executives throughout the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Proffer had been expanding his own interests into films,
including work for Showtime on ``Gods and Monsters,'' and he was
immediately enthusiastic about the project. ``I committed because I
know this was going to be done right, by people with a real passion
for the music,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That passion was expressed by the commitment not to include any
songs that did not fit organically into the story. Thus when the
young hero, a country singer, begins discovering what was known at
the time as ``race music'' in roadhouses in Missouri, he encounters
both the early work of Little Richard (played by Billy Porter, who
starred in ``Smokey Joe's Cafe''' on Broadway) and a fictional
blues singer, played by B.B. King. The latter sings a song, ``Fur
Slippers,'' an original and never-before-heard composition by Bob
Dylan, described by Hammond of MCA as ``a smokin' blues number.''
</P>
<P>
   Proffer made the contact with Dylan, and acquired the rights to
the song. He said Dylan, along with B.B. King, felt the project was
a sincere attempt to capture the moment in time when blues evolved
into what became rock'n'roll.
</P>
<P>
   Proffer credited Mike Robe, the film's writer and director, with
fleshing out the story in a way that would accommodate the notion
of numerous song performances while also telling a story that
emphasized both the romance and, more subtly, the way music of that
era helped break down racial barriers in the country.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The film will include the old recordings of a few songs played
as background like Chuck Berry on ``Maybelline,'' and The Platters
singing ``Only You,'' but for the most part Proffer lined up
contemporary artists to stand in for 1950s rock pioneers. So Dickie
Barrett, the lead singer of current ska group The Mighty Mighty
Bosstones, plays Bill Haley singing the film's title song. Chante
Moore, the rhythm and blues diva who has a current single hit with
``Chante's Got a Man,'' will sing the lead in a female group
modeled on The Shirelles. She sings a new song written by Carole
King, who really did write for the Shirelles.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the three members of Blink 182 will play Jan and Dean
singing ``Dead Man's Curve.'' D'Arby will play rock legend Jackie
Wilson singing one of his hits ``To Be Loved.'' The show will also
include one of the staples of the era, the street corner doo-wop
group, in this case formed by a collection of top current rhythm
and blues singers headed by K-Ci and JoJo, who had a triple
platinum album, ``Love Always,'' last year and a new album, ``It's
Real,'' which has already sold more than a million copies. They
will sing a street corner version of the Little Anthony and the
Imperials hit ``Tears on My Pillow.''
</P>
<P>
   Proffer also reached out to perhaps the most successful
composers of that era, Jerry Lieber and Mike Stoller, asking if
they had, what he called ``any old chestnuts'' that had been lost
to time. They offered up dozens of possibilities from which he
chose two songs few have heard of since they were obscurely
recorded in 1953 and 1954, ``One Bad Stud'' and ``Touch of
Heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   For other songs he needed, Proffer went to other friends in the
music business including Graham Nash, who worked on two songs, and
one the most prolific composers from the golden age of soul, Lamont
Dozier, who collaborated with Proffer on the show's de facto theme
song, an anthem called ``Side By Side,'' which is sung by The
Harleys in the show and then by the entire cast (and much of the
crew including Wright of CBS, who also sings background on several
other vocals) as the closing number.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   After lining up the artists and acquiring rights to the music,
Proffer began arranging and producing it. He finished a first mix
of the songs several months ago. Hammond said a final mix would be
ready at the end of the summer and would be rolled out in stores
beginning in early October. MCA will work the usual retail outlets
to place the record, he said, and then CBS will begin a huge
marketing push, both on the television network and on its numerous
radio stations when the miniseries begins. That will include not
only a toll-free number commercial after each night of the show but
also a Web site that will be set up to help sales.
</P>
<P>
   Proffer said for him and many of the other music artists
involved in the project, the profit motive was secondary to a
chance to do a project that tapped so deeply into their musical
roots. But he conceded, ``We think we will do some serious commerce
with this project.'' &QL;

EXPERTS SAY STUDY CONFIRMS PRISON'S NEW ROLE AS MENTAL HOSPITAL 
</HEADLINE>
 
 (ATTN: Ill., Md.) (nk) 
 By FOX BUTTERFIELD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first comprehensive study of the rapidly growing number of
emotionally disturbed people in the nation's jails and prisons has
found that there are 283,800 inmates with severe mental illness,
about 16 percent of the total jail population. The report confirms
the belief of many state, local and federal experts that jails and
prisons have become the nation's new mental hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   The study, released by the Justice Department on Sunday, paints
a grim statistical portrait, detailing how emotionally disturbed
inmates tend to follow a revolving door from homelessness to
incarceration and then back to the streets with little treatment,
many of them arrested for crimes that grow out of their illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, mentally ill inmates in state prisons
were more than twice as likely to have been homeless before their
arrest than other inmates, twice as likely to have been physically
and sexually abused in childhood and far more likely to have been
on drugs or alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   In another reflection of their chaotic lives, the study found
that emotionally disturbed inmates had many more previous
incarcerations than other prisoners. More than three quarters of
them had been sentenced to jail or prison before, and half had
served three or more prior sentences.
</P>
<P>
   Many of them were arrested for bizarre public behavior or petty
crimes like loitering or public intoxication. But the report, by
the Justice Department's Bureau of Justice Statistics, also found
that mentally ill inmates in state prisons were more likely than
other prisoners to have been convicted of a violent crime.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, once incarcerated, emotionally disturbed inmates in
state prisons spend an average of 15 months longer behind bars than
other prisoners, often because their delusions, hallucinations or
paranoia make them more likely to get in fights or receive
disciplinary reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``This study provides data to show that the incarceration of the
mentally ill is a disastrous, horrible social issue,'' said Kay
Redfield Jamison, a professor of psychiatry at the Johns Hopkins
School of Medicine. ``There is something fundamentally broken in
the system that covers both hospitals and jails,'' said Jamison,
the author of ``Night Falls Fast: Understanding Suicide,'' to be
published later this year by Knopf.
</P>
<P>
   With the wholesale closings of public mental hospitals in the
1960s, and the prison boom of the past two decades, jails and
prisons are often the only institutions open 24 hours a day and
required to take the emotionally disturbed.
</P>
<P>
   The hospitals were closed at a time when new antipsychotic drugs
made medicating patients in the community seem a humane alternative
to long-term hospitalization. From a high of 559,000 in 1955, the
number of patients in state hospitals dropped to 69,000 in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   But drugs work only when taken, and many states failed to build
a promised network of clinics to monitor patients. To compound the
problem, for-profit hospitals began turning away the psychotic.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the number of jail and prison beds has
quadrupled in the last 25 years, with 1.8 million Americans now
behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jails have become the poor person's mental hospitals,'' said
Linda A. Teplin, a professor of psychiatry and director of the
psycho-legal studies program at Northwestern University.
</P>
<P>
   All previous estimates of the number of emotionally disturbed
inmates have been based on research by Teplin in the Cook County
Jail in Chicago. She found that 9.5 percent of male inmates there
had experienced a severe mental disorder like schizophrenia, manic
depression or major depression, four times the rate in the general
population.
</P>
<P>
   Teplin said that while she welcomed the Justice Department
count, it was open to question because the study relied on reports
by the inmates themselves, who were asked whether they had a mental
condition or had ever received treatment for a mental problem.
People with emotional disorders often are not aware of them, or do
not want to report them, she said, so the Justice Department
estimate of more than a quarter million inmates with mental illness
may actually be too low, Teplin said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Teplin said, the study was not conducted by mental
health professionals using diagnostic tests, so it was impossible
to tell what mental disorders the inmates suffered from, and
whether they were severe illnesses, like schizophrenia, or
generally less severe problems, like anxiety disorders.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most striking findings in the study, and the one most
likely to be disputed, is that mentally ill inmates were more
likely to have been incarcerated for a violent offense than other
prisoners, with 53 percent of emotionally disturbed inmates in
state prisons sentenced for a violent crime, compared with 46
percent of other prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the report found that 13.2 percent of mentally ill
inmates in prisons had been convicted of murder, compared with 11.4
percent of other prisoners, and 12.4 percent of mentally ill
inmates had been convicted of sexual assault, compared with 7.9
percent of other prisoners. Emotionally disturbed inmates in state
prisons had also been convicted of more property crimes, but were
only half as likely to have been sentenced for drug crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for the mentally ill have worked hard to show that
emotionally disturbed people are no more violent than others, to
try to lessen the stigma surrounding mental illness. But recent
research, while confirming that mentally ill people may not be more
violent than others, suggests that they can become violent in a
number of conditions, including when they are off their
medications, are actively psychotic or are taking drugs or alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   In another important finding, also subject to differing
interpretations, the study found that reported rates of mental
illness varied by race and gender, with white and female inmates
reporting higher rates than black and male inmates. The highest
rates of mental illness were among white female state prisoners,
with an estimated 29 percent of them reporting emotional disorders,
compared with 20 percent of black female prisoners. Overall, 22.6
percent of white state prisoners were identified as mentally ill,
compared with 13.5 percent of black prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Dorothy Otnow-Lewis, a psychiatrist, said the differences
were a result of white psychiatrists ``being very bad at
recognizing mental illness in minority individuals.'' Psychiatrists
are more likely to dismiss aggressive behavior in men, particularly
black men, as a result of their being bad, rather than being mad,
said Otnow-Lewis, who is a senior criminal justice fellow at the
Center on Crime, Communities and Culture of the Soros Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Faenza, president of the National Mental Health
Association, said the finding that mentally ill inmates tend to
have more previous incarcerations than other prisoners ``shows that
the criminal justice system is just a revolving door for a person
with mental illness, from the street to jail and back without
treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   Jamison noted that jails and prisons are not conducive to
treatment, even when it is available. ``Inmates get deprived of
sleep,'' she said, ``and isolation can exacerbate their
hallucinations or delusions.''

ABSOLUT PITCHES ORANGE-FLAVORED VODKA 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's an old saying that nothing rhymes with ``orange.'' So
there may not be a rhyme for a multimillion-dollar campaign to
pitch a new orange-flavored variety of Absolut vodka _ but there
certainly is a reason.
</P>
<P>
   Seagram Americas is bringing out Absolut Mandrin, the brand's
fourth flavor after Peppar (pepper, introduced in 1986), Citron
(citrus, 1988) and Kurant (currant, 1992) for a clear reason: The
flavored segment of the vodka market is growing faster than the
vodka category as a whole. And with a major Absolut competitor,
Stolichnaya, offering an orange flavor _ ``Stoli O'' to the in
crowd _ it is not surprising that Absolut would roll into the
orange arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes sense for Absolut to not let Stolichnaya have it to
themselves,'' said Bob Keane, editorial director at Adams Business
Media in New York, which tracks the performance of the liquor
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it makes sense because orange is a good flavor,'' he
added, as evinced by the longtime popularity of drinks that mix
vodka with orange juice as well as brisk sales for citrus-flavored
vodkas like Absolut Citron.
</P>
<P>
   The Mandrin variety is to be introduced on Thursday and is
scheduled to be available nationwide by Sept. 1. It's the first new
flavor of Absolut being brought out by Seagram Americas since its
parent, Seagram Co., acquired the brand's worldwide distribution
rights in 1994 from the Swedish distiller, Vin and Sprit AB.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a market leader, we have to be proactive,'' said James E.
Schleifer, North American marketing director for Absolut at Seagram
Americas in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel there's a great opportunity here,'' he added, because
``in-depth surveys showed this flavor provided an optimal
complement'' to the current Absolut line.
</P>
<P>
   Flavors account for 15 percent of the volume of Absolut; Seagram
distributed 3.6 million cases of the brand last year, according to
Adams, up 5.5 percent from 3.4 million in 1997. And the
citrus-flavored Absolut Citron accounted for 75 percent of the
total flavor volume; distribution of Absolut Citron in 1998
increased 15 percent from 1997, to 460,000 cases from 400,000.
</P>
<P>
   Absolut has continued performing well under Seagram, remaining
the nation's No. 1 imported vodka brand and No. 2 over all behind
only Smirnoff. But as Seagram intensifies its focus on
premium-priced brands like Absolut, the company is increasingly
pursuing a strategy known as creating news: teaching old brands new
tricks to further stimulate sales among shoppers who crave novelty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Though in a certain sense we are following the Absolut
template, we started with a fresh sheet of paper for Absolut
Mandrin,'' said Richard Lewis, worldwide director for the Absolut
account at TBWA/Chiat/Day in New York, part of the TBWA Worldwide
unit of Omnicom Group.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Absolut Mandrin will be the first Absolut with a
punt _ the indentation at the bottom of the bottle _ to be colored
to match the flavor. ``When we showed it to consumers, their jaws
dropped so much you could fit an orange in,'' Lewis said. ``When
they see it on the shelves, it will be provoking.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign for Absolut Mandrin is starting with two print ads
that are running on consecutive right-hand pages of magazines like
GQ, New York, Rolling Stone, Spin and Vanity Fair. The first ad
carries the headline ``Absolut sighting'' under a photograph of an
orange posed to resemble a UFO.
</P>
<P>
   The second ad carries the headline ``Absolut arrival'' under a
photograph of the Absolut Mandrin bottle, the punt gleaming as if
lit by, in Lewis' words, ``an orange sunrise.''
</P>
<P>
   Subsequent ads will include ``Absolut balance,'' Lewis said,
with an orange wedge perched atop the bottle, and an ad in which
``an orange will be inserted in place of the word `orange.'''
Marketing plans include store displays, postcards, T-shirts, shot
glasses and orange-shaped recipe brochures.
</P>
<P>
   There will also be promotions, Schleifer said, that will include
flying or tethering a 60-foot-high hot air balloon ``at Absolut
Mandrin `arrival parties' in August and September in the Hamptons,
Chicago, Los Angeles and Miami.''
</P>
<P>
   Are vodka drinkers being absolutely overwhelmed by variety,
considering that there will be four flavors of Absolut plus two
variations of the base brand (in 80 and 100 proof) along with the
multiple flavors of Stolichnaya, not to mention other upscale
brands like Finlandia, Ketel One and Skyy?
</P>
<P>
   ``This could end up like wine coolers, a flavor-of-the-month
business,'' said Keane at Adams. ``A retailer or a bar isn't going
to have room for all of these.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But flavored vodkas appeal to younger adults,'' he added,
``and are good for the modern martinis. In the first year, Absolut
Mandrin should easily do 50,000 cases.'' &QL;

<P>
   Just two years after it began, the financial crisis that started
in Asia and spread pain around the world appears to be over _
leaving many to wonder if the symptoms have abated before the
disease could be treated.
</P>
<P>
   All the conventional measures of health look good. Stock markets
that tumbled soon after the crisis started in Thailand in July 1997
have bounced back, ranking among the world's best performers in the
first half of 1999. Currencies that plummeted, leaving ruin in
their wake, have crawled back. Foreign investors who fled Asia like
movie-goers from a burning theater are returning, poking around for
hidden bargains amid the embers.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's plausible assessment nine months ago that
the world faced ``the worst financial crisis in half a century''
now seems like a distant echo from another financial era.
</P>
<P>
   But the recovery may have come too fast. In interviews with
business executives, policymakers and investors in Asia and
America, there is a common thread: The remarkable speed of the
rebound has drained the political urgency out of many reforms that
seemed so vital during the darkest days of the crisis _and may
still be essential to Asia's future. Most Asian countries have not
genuinely confronted the twin weaknesses of their economies:
insolvent banks and deeply indebted corporations. Bad loans and bad
habits still plague financial institutions from Korea to Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hear a lot about reforms since the Asian crisis,'' James
Harmon, chairman of the Export-Import Bank of the United States,
said in an interview. ``The truth is that many of the reforms are
not proceeding. Old habits die hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Harmon speaks from bitter experience. Not long ago he quietly
sought help from Indonesia's president, B.J. Habibie, in convincing
one of the country's biggest conglomerates, the Bakrie Group, to
begin paying back $80 million owed to the Ex-Im Bank, an
independent U.S. government agency that promotes exports by
subsidizing loans and providing credit guarantees to developing
countries that buy American-made goods. Harmon's message was
unspoken, but clear: The United States stood behind the bailout
that kept Indonesia from a wholesale financial meltdown, and its
taxpayers should not be stiffed.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Harmon has proven singularly unpersuasive, perhaps
because the man who owes him, Aburizal Bakrie, has also emerged as
one of Habibie's staunchest supporters. Bakrie did not respond to
several requests for an interview.
</P>
<P>
   In the place where the crisis began, Thailand, the man
responsible for overhauling the battered financial system, Amaret
Sila-on, rarely misses an opportunity to warn that less has changed
than meets the eye.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he says, Thailand has finally created a bankruptcy court,
after two years of foot-dragging by politicians who also head some
of the country's biggest insolvent companies. But cronyism lives,
he warns, as does the system that heedlessly lent money to the
politically powerful.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the rule of law still remains weaker than the rule of
men,'' Amaret argues, ``banks will return to their old ways despite
the restructuring efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   The guiding ethic around Asia these days seems to be this: Wait
it out, because in a rebounding market, we will not have to change
much. Foreign money is returning, in some cases fueled by Western
companies seeking bargains, in other cases by mutual fund managers
riding the momentum of a perceived recovery. Some funds may also
belong to wealthy ethnic Chinese and others in Southeast Asia who
sent cash abroad during the crisis and now are gradually bringing
it back home.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of CEOs are clinging to their jobs,'' said Razak
Baginda, the executive director of the Malaysian Strategic Research
Center, a research firm in Kuala Lumpur. ``In a way, they've been
saved by the stock market.''
</P>
<P>
   While some of Asia's most troubled companies had to liquidate or
sell out to Western investors, many firms that appear insolvent
have remained frozen in place. The result is that the corruption
and collusion that contributed to the crisis, and the complacency
that allowed banks to lend with abandon as governments looked the
other way, have not disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question that with improving markets, political
pressure to change things is reduced,'' Stanley Fischer, the No. 2
official at the International Monetary Fund, said recently. Fischer
argues, however, that the risks of a ``systemic crisis'' have been
reduced, partly because of changes at his own institution.
</P>
<P>
   James D. Wolfensohn, the president of the World Bank, which
often openly disagrees with the IMF's prescriptions, calls the end
of the crisis ``a very mixed story,'' and worries that institutions
like his own ``no longer have the leverage to get the system
fixed'' now that the countries are not in need of immediate cash.
</P>
<P>
   One reason the reforms have been so plodding is that no one ever
really decided what caused the crisis. Americans were quick to
point to traditions of cronyism and corruption. But those practices
have characterized business in Asian countries for decades, and
didn't slow what was known as the East Asian miracle.
</P>
<P>
   Asians, bolstered by some big-name Western economists, blamed
the IMF for worsening the crisis by forcing big spending cuts to
trim deficits. The IMF reversed its strategy after some months. In
the end, U.S. and IMF officials note, the countries that most
closely followed its advice _ Thailand, South Korea and Brazil _
appear to have rebounded the fastest. The two nations that were so
mired in political chaos that they never executed the IMF's plans _
Russia and Indonesia _ are still in deep trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Pressure from Washington has been uneven. For much of last year,
the Asian crisis dominated White House strategy sessions, with many
senior officials fearing it could puncture Wall Street's party. But
the sense of crisis abated last September after Russia's economic
collapse was contained more quickly than anyone expected. And
gradually the impetus for wide-ranging reforms slackened, and grand
plans for remaking the world financial system became modest
adjustments, including new IMF mechanisms to respond earlier to
``economic contagion'' hitting otherwise well-run countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, Rubin's caution about messing with the market
system won out,'' one senior administration official said recently,
referring to former Treasury secretary Robert Rubin, whose
resignation took effect 10 days ago, two years to the day after
Thailand's crisis began. ``That may have been the right instinct.
We'll know in about 10 years.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Some problems that triggered the crisis seem to have been at
least temporarily addressed. Virtually all the crisis-hit countries
frittered away state foreign currency reserves trying to keep their
currencies strong _ and tried to hide that news from investors. Now
that the IMF has pressed countries to publish more information,
data once considered state secrets can now be found on the fund's
Internet site (www.imf.org).
</P>
<P>
   The Thai baht and the Korean won float freely, and the countries
have rebuilt their war-chests of foreign currency, mostly by
exporting to the United States and stacking up the dollars they get
in return.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Asian countries have largely halted their practice of
borrowing from abroad on short terms to finance big, long-term
projects. That proved disastrous when projects ground to a halt and
currencies fell, forcing companies and banks to repay huge debts
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Other bad habits are proving harder to break. No Asian country
has yet put an effective bankruptcy law on its books, meaning it is
still impossible to wipe out insolvent businesses, settle with
creditors and rebuild viable companies. Thailand has come closest _
opening its first bankruptcy court last month and staffing it with
60 judges.
</P>
<P>
   Still, skeptics say it will take months for those judges to
master complex bankruptcy laws. And they will find it hard to fight
proprietors of debt-ridden companies, some of whom sit in the Thai
Senate and have bitterly opposed the passage of stronger laws.
</P>
<P>
   In Indonesia, where the laws are even more toothless, the
government has resorted to shaming its corporate sector. The
Indonesian Bank Restructuring Authority recently named the 100
worst debtors in local newspapers. But even conglomerates on the
list, like the Bakrie Group, are dragging their feet on resolving
their debt problems.
</P>
<P>
   Bakrie has offered to give its banks equity in return for
canceling its $1 billion in debt. The U.S. Ex-Im Bank and other
creditors object that the plan would leave the Bakrie family, which
dug the conglomerate into a hole in the first place, with
considerable influence. And they believe Bakrie has wildly
overstated the value of that equity. Still, some local bankers say
Bakrie's creditors may have little choice but to comply.
</P>
<P>
   ``When companies tell their creditors to go through regular
legal channels, that basically means, `Go fly a kite,''' said a
senior official at a U.S. bank in Jakarta, who spoke on condition
of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Rizal Ramli, an Indonesian economist, said the government lacked
the courage to go after well-connected tycoons. ``During the
Suharto era,'' he said, ``there were only five conglomerates that
were untouchable because of their ties to Suharto. Now, there seem
to be many more.''
</P>
<P>
   As long as Asia's banks cannot pursue debtors, they cannot clean
up their balance sheets. Nearly half of all loans carried on the
books of Thai banks are classified as nonperforming _ meaning they
will probably never be repaid. As a result, Thailand's banks have
not made fresh loans, hampering economic recovery, even with a
resurgent currency and stock market. The same is true in Indonesia,
Malaysia, and South Korea _ and of course in Japan, whose banking
problems continue to affect the rest of Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Hopes that the crisis would bring accountability to Asian
business are fading fast, too. In Malaysia, the infrastructure
giant, Renong, ran up $2.4 billion in debts, despite winning
lucrative franchises to run toll roads and bridges. Renong's
creditors blamed the youthful chairman, Halim Saad.
</P>
<P>
   Renong is now being rescued by a $2.2 billion bond offering by
one of its subsidiaries, which operates Malaysia's key north-south
toll highway. Although the bonds are not guaranteed by the
government _ which would make it a direct bailout _ analysts say it
will result in higher tolls or force the government to extend the
company's franchise. Halim, a protege of Finance Minister Daim
Zainuddin and a favorite of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, has
meanwhile kept his job.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere, perhaps, is the danger of Asia's backsliding more
apparent than in the case of Philippine Airlines. The flagship
carrier of the Philippines has been staggering under $2.2 billion
in debt _ the victim of costly fleet expansion at the time of the
regional crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Philippine Airlines, commonly known as PAL, is controlled by
Lucio C. Tan, one of the country's leading tycoons and a loyal
supporter of the Philippine president, Joseph P. Estrada, who used
a PAL plane for free during last year's presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The government has so far refused to bail out the airline, but
Estrada has made it a personal mission to keep Philippine Airlines
flying. He has backed a rehabilitation plan that would leave Tan, a
tobacco-and-beer mogul, in control. Ex-Im Bank, which financed the
purchase of Boeing planes by the airline, opposes the plan _ and
seized a PAL Boeing 747 earlier this year when it flew into the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   A court forced it to return the plane, but now it has threatened
to seize four Boeing 747s, saying that it fears PAL is not
maintaining them well enough to preserve their value as collateral
on the loan. Tan has not responded to repeated interview requests.
</P>
<P>
   Philippine Airlines proposes to recover by persuading the
government to reduce the number of rival carriers able to fly into
the Philippines. That would run counter to the whole movement to
open up Asia's markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would be a disaster, not just for the tourist industry
but for the country in general,'' said Emmanuel Gonzalez, the
president of the Hotel, Resort and Restaurant Association of Cebu,
a resort island in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   As the Asian crisis recedes, Gonzalez is finally seeing his
business improve. But the Philippine Airlines case reminds him of
how little has changed in the clubby world of Asian commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people here say, `Wouldn't it be awful if we lost our
flag carrier?''' he said, ``I wonder if they're really saying,
`Wouldn't it be awful if we didn't get our free tickets anymore?'''

AMERICAN AND BRITISH LAW FIRMS SET TO MERGE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., N.J.)  (rk) 
 By MELODY PETERSEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lawyers at Rogers &AMP; Wells in New York and Clifford Chance in
London announced Sunday that they had approved a merger of their
firms, the first combination between major British and American law
firms.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the firms' partners said they had agreed to
push forward with plans to merge with Germany's third-largest law
firm _ a move that would create the largest law firm in the world
in terms of both lawyers and revenue, pushing aside two American
giants.
</P>
<P>
   Partners at the three firms said Sunday that they were reacting
to the needs of their multinational corporate clients, who often
must hire myriad law firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to do the best deals for our clients,'' said Keith
Clark, senior partner at Clifford Chance, who will become chairman
of the combined firm. ``They don't want time delays and
inefficiencies from appointing a half-dozen law firms around the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   The top partners at the German firm _ Puender, Volhard, Weber &AMP;
Axster _ have already agreed to merge with Clifford Chance.
Partners at all three law firms plan to vote on the German merger
in September. The merger with Rogers &AMP; Wells and Puender, Volhard
would be effective on Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The combined firm would have 2,700 lawyers and 30 offices
worldwide. The three firms will earn more than $1 billion in fees
this year, the partners said.
</P>
<P>
   Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &AMP; Flom in New York is now the
world's leader when it comes to fees, earning $890 million last
year, according to American Lawyer magazine. In terms of lawyers,
Chicago's Baker &AMP; McKenzie ranks first, with 2,330.
</P>
<P>
   At least one competitor was not shaken by the news. Robert C.
Sheehan, executive partner at Skadden, Arps, said that his firm
would not be looking soon for a partner to try to keep its place at
the top.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never done a merger with anyone, and we don't
contemplate doing one in the foreseeable future,'' Sheehan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You tend to be known by the work you do,'' he said, and not
just by the size of the firm.
</P>
<P>
   But Clifford Chance partners were clearly excited Sunday about
their plunge into New York's financial and legal markets. Clifford
Chance will have more than 300 lawyers in New York, far more than
any other British firm.
</P>
<P>
   Clark vowed Sunday that Clifford Chance would become one of the
10-largest New York firms within three years. ``We already have a
number of lawyers calling and asking to join us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Partners at Rogers &AMP; Wells voted unanimously to join the British
giant, Clark said. The vote means that Rogers &AMP; Wells, a New York
institution that traces its roots back 128 years, will cease to
exist on Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The combined firm will be known as Clifford Chance Rogers &AMP;
Wells in the United States and as Clifford Chance elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The New York firm's partners include William P. Rogers, 86, who
was secretary of state in the Nixon administration and attorney
general under President Eisenhower.
</P>
<P>
   But while the formal terms of their merger are now set, the two
firms must work on adapting to each other's culture, language and
work methods.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be an enormous job,'' said Joel F. Henning, senior
vice president at Hildebrandt International, a consulting firm
based in Somerset, N.J., that advises law firms that are merging.
``They must agree on everything from the way they spell the word
`realize' to the best way to compensate people.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark said that partners had agreed to a compensation system
that was more British than American. Most British firms pay their
partners based on seniority and the number of years they have
worked for the firm, a system known as ``lock step.'' But most
American law firms have opted instead for a system that they refer
to as ``eat what you kill,'' where partners are paid based more on
the amount of new business they generate.

SMALL INVESTORS ENJOY TESTING THE MURKY WATERS OF BIOTECH STOCKS
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By TOM ABATE 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
The nature of biotech stock investing today may well be summed up
by the lyric to an old love song: ``Fools rush in where wise men
never go.''
<P>
   At a time when the institutional investors _ a.k.a. wise men _
have fallen out of love with small to mid-sized biotech, individual
investors _ alas, we don't know whether foolishly or not _ have
rushed in to embrace the sector.
</P>
<P>
   Small investors have become so important to the industry's
fortunes that a recent edition of BioCentury, the weekly trade
newsletter based in San Carlos, Calif., focused on what the trade
calls retail investors.
</P>
<P>
   The universe of small investors includes some who have
gravitated to biotech for goofy reasons, like the sheer fun of
accumulating large positions in stocks that sell for $2 or $3.
These bottom-fishers may indeed get lucky, but they tend to be the
folks who e-mail me from time to time, complaining about stocks
that have nosedived.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are solid reasons for retail investors to study
small to midsized biotech stocks, according to Richard van den
Broek, an analyst with Hambrecht &AMP; Quist. The most important is
demographics: Aging baby boomers are expanding the market for
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, this demographic trend means some drug discovery
firms will strike it rich. But that begs the key question: which
companies and when?
</P>
<P>
   If you're thinking of betting on biotech, here are a few tips to
help you avoid rushing in too foolishly.
</P>
<P>
   First, before you test your luck with individual shares, try
investing in a mutual fund that specializes in the broad heading of
life sciences.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately the universe of such funds with proven track
records isn't large, said Steve Janachowski, a financial planner in
Tiburon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the funds haven't been around long enough,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best options, according to Janachowski, is Invesco
Health Sciences Fund. In the seven years this mutual has been
around, its annual return has ranged from a 14 percent loss in
1992, to a 43 percent gain in 1998. Year-to-date, the fund is down
4 percent but it still rates a four out five possible stars
according to Morningstar, which evaluates fund performance.
</P>
<P>
   If you have access to the Web, you can use Morningstar to get a
free peek at more health or biotech funds. Go to
www.morningstar.net and click on fund selector. That takes you to a
page that asks you to select a fund category (choose U.S. stocks)
and a second criterion, like one-year return.
</P>
<P>
   You'll have to hunt through the list that appears for funds with
health, life sciences or biotech in the name. Copy down the names _
and the ticker symbols _ and return to the Morningstar.net home
page. Type the ticker symbol into the ``Quicktake'' function to
learn more about the fund.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a hankering to invest in individual shares, you'll
need to do a lot more research. Even expert investors get burned on
biotech stocks because negative developments can pop out of
nowhere. A failed clinical trial can send shares tumbling, and
there's no way to know in advance.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are new tools available to help individual
investors get up to speed on small biotech offerings. Small Caps
Online (www.smallcapsonline.com) is a New York firm that offers
free research reports on biotech firms with market capitalizations
under $250 million.
</P>
<P>
   These are exactly the firms that have been overlooked by
institutional investors, and the large investment banks who do most
Wall Street research. Small Caps is trying to establish itself as a
full-service investment bank to help tiny biotech firms, according
to spokeswoman Jennifer LaVin.
</P>
<P>
   Small Caps plans to support itself by earning fees from helping
biotech firms do mergers and other deals. While it remains to be
seen how that business will fare, the firm is issuing Wall
Street-type research reports, free, to small investors.
</P>
<P>
   One last caveat.
</P>
<P>
   Biotech or medical device companies need Food &AMP; Drug
Administration approval before they can sell products. The FDA puts
these products through a three-step process of clinical trials
before it gives thumbs up or down.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts start tracking companies after they've
successfully completed their third round of trials. But they don't
rush out and buy on that news, because the firm still has two more
hurdles: It needs a positive FDA advisory panel vote and then full
FDA approval.
</P>
<P>
   In general, Wall Street has waited until after final FDA
approval to buy into a biotech stock. Sure, the institutions miss a
little upside appreciation, but they also avoid most of the
downside risk of placing bets too early.
</P>
<P>
   The experience of Scios Inc. provides a good parable on the
virtue of patience. Shares in the Mountain View firm started
climbing steadily, from below $4 last November to a high of $12.50
earlier this year. Driving the gain was positive news about a
congestive heart failure drug. Scios stock rose when the drug,
Natrecor, show positive results in Phase III trials. It rose again
when an FDA advisory panel _ the second-to-last step in the process
_ gave it a good recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   But in late April, the full FDA told Scios the drug needed more
tests. Scios shared abruptly plunged below $4 again, and have
bumped along there ever since.

<P>
   KWETHLUK, Alaska _ In the clearings along the broad Kuskokwim
River where the Yup'ik Eskimos set up their fish camps, this is a
busy time. Families are racing to catch, cut and cure the fish that
will last them a year, and salmon turn scarlet as they hang by the
hundreds to dry in the early summer sun.
</P>
<P>
   James Nicori and his family were up until 3 the other morning,
stringing fish and stoking the alderwood in the smokehouse, not
that the time of day matters too much at a point in the season when
it does not get dark at all. In August it will be time for
gathering berries and wild celery out in the bush. In the fall the
men will hunt caribou.
</P>
<P>
   To a remarkable degree, thousands of native people still live
off the land here in the Alaskan tundra, taking 90 percent or more
of what they eat every year from the great back country, the rivers
and the Bering Sea. ``This,'' said Nicori, beckoning to the
Kuskokwim and the vast bushland beyond, ``is our supermarket.''
</P>
<P>
   But 40 years after Alaska became a state, 20 years after
land-claim disputes in the oil rush led Congress to give
``subsistence gatherers'' priority rights to fish and game, and 10
years after the state's highest court declared that protection
unconstitutional because such natural bounty was for the ``common
use'' of all Alaskans, the debate has reached a bitter crisis
point.
</P>
<P>
   Cheering the natives but enraging sportsmen's groups and the
state's commercial fishing industry, which are both largely white,
Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt announced recently that the
federal government would take over allocation of fishing rights and
schedules on federally owned land in Alaska, nearly two-thirds of
the state, on Oct. 1 unless the state Legislature acts.
</P>
<P>
   State lawmakers could keep Washington from doing this, Babbitt
said, if they agreed on a constitutional amendment to guarantee a
``subsistence priority'' in times of shortage for those who rely on
the land and rivers here for their primary food supply.
</P>
<P>
   But the Republican-controlled Legislature has not reached accord
on a measure to put before the voters, prompting the Democratic
governor, Tony Knowles, to warn that they could be letting in ``the
Trojan horse of federal management'' in a state that fiercely
values its last-frontier style of independence.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the debate over Alaska's subsistence culture
starkly echoes those elsewhere over affirmative action, creating
similar racial tensions. The natives say the issue is their civil
rights, while the sportsmen say they are demanding ``special
rights'' and unfair quotas.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not 19th-century history here, some historical
injustice we can do nothing about today,'' said George Irvin,
policy director for the Alaskan Federation of Natives, which
represents the Eskimos, Indians and Aleuts in their battle for
subsistence rights. ``These are the last aboriginal Americans still
striving to live as they always have, on their homelands. There has
to be room in the American system for them to survive.''
</P>
<P>
   To an outsider, the dispute at first seems eminently solvable.
After all, the subsistence gatherers take only 2 percent or 3
percent of the state's fish and game harvest a year, and polls show
that at least 60 percent of Alaskans favor granting priority rights
to such people.
</P>
<P>
   And the issue mainly arises in times of scarcity, which come
every few years when regulators determine that fish are running low
in some rivers or caribou or moose herds have thinned.
</P>
<P>
   But allocating these rights can be immensely complicated, which
partly explains why the Legislature has so far failed, despite
years of trying, to resolve the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Who, exactly, should be defined as a subsistence gatherer?
Although subsistence is rooted in native cultures, some white
people also live off the land, while many natives live in Anchorage
and Fairbanks and are just as likely to shop in a supermarket or
eat at McDonald's as a non-native.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, ensuring subsistence gatherers the ability to carry
out a traditional way of life sometimes means, say, closing off
rivers for several weeks to everybody else. That not only irritates
those who fish as a hobby but possibly makes the difference between
profit and loss in the season of a commercial fishing operator.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the logistical considerations, it is clear that the issue
has touched a deep emotional nerve.
</P>
<P>
   That is particularly true for non-white Alaskans, or native
peoples, as they prefer to call themselves, who were the majority
in Alaska into the 1940s but now make up only about 15 percent of
the state's population. Many native leaders complain of
mistreatment by the white majority, a sentiment clearly in evidence
at a rally in Anchorage in May in which native groups pressed for
protection of subsistence rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apartheid is alive and well and it lives in the Arctic, it
lives in our schools, and I'm sad to say it lives in the halls of
the state Legislature,'' Desa Jacobsson, who is Gwich'in Indian on
her mother's side and Yup'ik Eskimo on her father's, told the
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jacobsson, who ran unsuccessfully for governor last year as
the Green Party candidate, was jailed briefly several years ago
after a subsistence fishing protest.
</P>
<P>
   But strong emotions are also felt by many whites, whose numbers
swelled from migration in the oil rush of the 1970s, but also
include many who were born here and feel they, too, are natives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our adversaries marched for `special rights' _ and called it
civil rights,'' says a brochure produced by the Alaska Outdoor
Council, one of the principal groups representing sportsmen and
sportswomen in the state. It urges members to fight efforts to
``enshrine that terrible federal subsistence law in our state's
Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   That law, Title VIII of the Alaska National Interest Lands
Conservation Act, was passed by Congress in 1980, establishing a
subsistence priority, loosely defined as applying to rural
residents of the state and thus covering what it termed the
``customary and traditional'' uses of subsistence gatherers.
</P>
<P>
   That measure guaranteed that in years of low yield, steps would
be taken to ensure that those gatherers had first rights to the
harvests of fish and game. It grew out of an agreement a decade
earlier, reached in the rush to clear a right of way for the
building of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline, that native subsistence
rights would be protected.
</P>
<P>
   But those are the protections that the state court later deemed
unconstitutional. And after years of prodding the state to change
its Constitution, the federal government is set to wield its
hammer, in the form of Babbitt's threat to take over fishing
management on federally owned property in Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   The state has been managing fishing on those lands and has asked
to keep doing so while it tries to work out language to protect
subsistence rights, but Babbitt said earlier this month that he was
disappointed the Legislature had not brought the issue before
voters and that it was time to act.

   About half of Alaska's 100,000 native people live off the land
to a significant extent, according to the Alaska Federation of
Natives. For some, that may mean taking only a third or so of their
food from the land. But thousands, like Nicori and his family here
on the Kuskokwim, get 90 percent or more this way.
</P>
<P>
   The food involved runs the gamut, from berries and roe air
seaweed to fish, moose, caribou, arctic hare and the parka
squirrel.
</P>
<P>
   The natives who live off the land are hardly living in the past.
In many of their villages, there are motorboats and snowmobiles,
satellite television dishes and Coca-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way you can stop it completely,'' said 64-year-old
Mary John, laughing as she skinned a huge bucketful of herring one
recent afternoon with her 14-year-old granddaughter Kimberly
Kassaiuli in the village of Newtok, in southwestern Alaska. ``Kids
do like the taste of potato chips.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the village, hard by the Niutaq River, several of Stanley
and Elizabeth Tom's eight children were inside the house, watching
a Disney ``Mighty Ducks'' cartoon movie as they also gutted and
intricately braided fish with tundra grass, and then hung them for
drying.
</P>
<P>
   Except for a big bowl of rice, lunch that afternoon at the Toms'
small home came from the land: half-smoked salmon, dried herring
dipped in seal oil, salmon berries preserved last fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big part of who we are and what we are all about,''
said Nicori, who had nearly 100 king salmon and hundreds of smaller
reds and chums hanging on the lines and in the smokehouse at his
fish camp. ``It is something we must never lose, no matter how
modern the world becomes.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the current system, the state gives priority in some cases
to subsistence gatherers. For instance, they were allowed to fish
in the Kuskokwim for several weeks this year before it opened to
commercial operators. But critics challenge that system, saying it
is not strong enough to guarantee protection in all cases, as would
the federal law, which Babbitt wants enshrined in the state
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   From 1994 to 1998, several rivers in southwest Alaska had poor
fish runs, and around Bristol Bay the state had to deliver fish
caught elsewhere to nearly 100 communities, an act of compassion
that was also deeply wounding to those who survive off the land.
</P>
<P>
   Knowles is expected to call one more special session, probably
in September, in a last-ditch bid to avert the federal takeover of
fishing regulations on the government's lakes and rivers.
</P>
<P>
   While both sides say they are open to compromise, it is not
clear that much common ground exists. And an unlikely alliance of
forces may work against an agreement: natives who favor the federal
action and conservative lawmakers who could reap considerable
political hay from the anger that a federal intervention could
spark among many white Alaskans.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Somerville, a board member of Territorial Sportsmen Inc.,
one of the oldest and largest sportsmen's groups in the state, said
it made no sense ``to allow our state to institute a bad federal
law that discriminates against our own residents.''
</P>
<P>
   But Myron Naneng, president of the Association of Village
Council Presidents, representing 56 native villages here in the
Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta of southwest Alaska, put the matter in very
different terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a very law-abiding people,'' he said. ``But when
obeying the law means that our children go hungry, something is
wrong with the law.''

   Pedro Martinez can't lift a Volkswagen. There is nothing
cartoonish about his body, no Popeye forearms, no Superman chest;
Martinez possesses the physical presence of a toll taker. His
favorite dietary supplement could be grapefruit. But even though
Pedro Martinez is slight enough to be a tattoo on the biceps of
Mark McGwire, he is the Mark McGwire of pitchers in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, the star right-hander for the Boston Red Sox, has 15
victories this season and has an outside chance to become the first
pitcher in more than three decades to win 30 games, an
accomplishment that many within baseball believe would be more
incredible than McGwire's feat of 70 home runs last year, because
of the extraordinary efficiency that would be required of Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be something else if that can happen,'' said Roger
Clemens, the New York Yankees' pitcher who has won a record five Cy
Young Awards, given each year to the league's best pitcher, and
never accumulated more than 24 victories in any season. ``Just from
being in a five-man rotation, your margin for error would be so
minimal. It'll be interesting, something fun to watch in the second
half.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, 27, admired for his competitiveness and talent by
those who don't know him and for his humility and graciousness by
those who do, will start for the American League in Tuesday night's
All-Star game in Boston. Then later this week, he will begin the
second half of the season slightly off a 30-victory pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox have played 88 games of their 162-game schedule, and
Martinez could get 16 or 17 more starts in the second half,
depending on how integral his outings will be to the Boston playoff
hopes in the last month of the season and how he is employed by his
manager, Jimy Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Over the entire season, Martinez might get 34 to 36 starts. The
major league leader last year, Baltimore's Scott Erickson, had 36.
Denny McLain, the last pitcher to reach 30 victories _ he went 31-6
for the Detroit Tigers in 1968 _ started 41 games that season.
</P>
<P>
   In this era, when a starting pitcher is thought to have done
well if he pitches six innings and hands a lead to his relievers,
it is rare for a pitcher to be charged with a victory or a loss in
even 90 percent of his starts. Martinez has started 18 games and
had a decision in each, winning 15 and losing 3.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are all the factors Martinez cannot control. His team
must compile enough runs for him to win _ the Arizona Diamondbacks
have gone scoreless in Randy Johnson's last four starts _ and his
defense must support him. So long as opposing pitchers throw
strikes to McGwire, he has a chance to hit home runs; he can
control his own destiny. Martinez must be exceptional, and very,
very lucky, which is why the Yankee pitcher David Cone believes
winning 30 games would be such a significant single-season feat.
</P>
<P>
   ``He may get 35 starts to win 30, and that is the slimmest
margin for error, when you compare it to hitting .400 or 70 home
runs,'' said Cone. ``You have to not only be on top of your game,
but you have to have run support and have things go so well for
you. You have to be nearly perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez doesn't think of himself as a nearly perfect pitcher;
he doesn't even believe he is the best pitcher in his family.
Martinez grew up poor in the Dominican Republic, on a nameless dirt
road in Manoguayabo, and his boyhood hero was his brother Ramon,
who was tall and thin and four years older.
</P>
<P>
   Four Martinez brothers slept in the same room _ Pedro and Jesus
in one bed, Ramon and Nelson in the other _ and they played catch
for hours and for days. Pedro marveled at Ramon, at how hard he
could throw a baseball, and when Ramon signed a contract with the
Dodgers, it only confirmed his stature in the eyes of Pedro.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found him so impressive,'' Pedro Martinez said recently,
sitting in the Red Sox clubhouse in Fenway Park, ``because he was a
regular professional player.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramon broke into the major leagues in 1988, the same year the
Dodgers signed the then-120-pound Pedro. Pedro Martinez threw about
82 to 83 mph _ pedestrian, compared to his brother's fastball of 95
to 96 mph _ and he was convinced he would never throw as hard as
Ramon. But over a span of about seven months, Pedro grew and the
velocity of his fastball increased by about 10 miles an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Ramon already had shown him the value of changing speeds, and
Pedro Martinez had developed a changeup grip, with the baseball
tucked deeply into his hands. But in 1991, a minor league coach
named Guy Conti showed Pedro Martinez another type of changeup grip
_ the circle change, with the thumb and forefinger touching as if
to pull down a window shade and the ball propelled loosely by the
other three fingers _ and this distinguished the right-hander.
Martinez established himself in the majors in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   But Fred Claire, the Dodgers' general manager, needed a second
baseman, and after the '93 season he traded Martinez to the
Montreal Expos for Delino DeShields _ in retrospect, one of the
worst trades in baseball history.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez went 11-5 for the Expos in 1994, and his sometimes
reckless attempts to pitch inside sparked several brawls. Martinez
was still comparatively small, 5 feet 11 inches and 170 pounds, but
he was unintimidated and kept throwing inside. Reggie Sanders of
the Cincinnati Reds was so incensed about being hit that he charged
the mound, despite the fact that Martinez had had a perfect game in
progress and would not deliberately have ruined it by hitting
Sanders and thus giving him first base.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez had succeeded to that point mostly because of his
fastball and changeup. Attempts by the Dodger manager, Tommy
Lasorda, to show him a curveball grip hadn't resulted in the good
breaking ball Martinez wanted. He promised Joe Kerrigan, the Expos'
pitching coach, that when he returned for the 1995 season, he would
have a viable breaking ball. ``Boy, when he came back the next
spring, he did have a good curveball,'' recalled Kerrigan, who has
since moved on to be pitching coach for the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   The curveball grip that Martinez uses today came from Ramon, who
had been shown it by Eliadoro Arias, an instructor at the Dodgers'
baseball academy in the Dominican Republic. Pedro could throw this
breaking ball hard, ``more aggressively,'' he said, ``a lot
quicker. It clicked in right away.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   His repertory now included three well-above-average pitches, or
two more than most major league pitchers', and within three years,
he dominated the National League, going 17-8 with a 1.90 earned run
average and striking out 305 in 241 1/3 innings in 1997. Because of
their payroll constraints, however, the Expos traded him to the Red
Sox after the season.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez is 34-10 in one a half seasons with the Red Sox and he
has assumed Clemens' place of preeminence in Boston, serving as a
maestro of emotion for the Fenway Park fans, who stand and roar
with each inning-ending strikeout.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can feel the energy he brings on each pitch,'' said
Kerrigan. ``Somebody could walk in off the street and not know
anything about baseball, and they would know this guy is good at
what he does, just because of the passion he shows for each pitch,
the intensity.''
</P>
<P>
   He pitched against the Yankees in Boston on May 18, and measured
against his norm, he was vulnerable that night, allowing 10 hits
and four walks; at least one Yankee reached scoring position in six
of his seven innings. But whenever disaster seemed imminent,
Martinez seemed to ascend to a higher level of determination and
concentration, his fastball gaining 2 or 3 mph. Of his 11
strikeouts that night, nine came with runners in scoring position.
Five of the seven innings he pitched ended with strikeouts.
Martinez has faced 47 batters with runners in scoring position and
two out this year, and struck out 23, allowing just six hits
(.128).
</P>
<P>
   Scott Brosius, the Yankees' third baseman, struck out to end the
second inning. ``He fired something like six pitches to me, all
fastballs and changeups, got the count to 3 balls and 2 strikes _
and then he drops a curveball over for a strike,'' Brosius said.
``You're just not looking for that.''
</P>
<P>
   When a pitcher throws as hard as Martinez, Brosius said, the
hitter must respect the fastball first and foremost. To hit a
fastball of 95 to 96 mph, you must prepare to swing quickly,
cocking your hands for the explosive movement of the bat; there is
only an instant to discern whether Martinez has thrown a fastball,
curveball or changeup. The hitter's weight begins to shift from
back to front, his bat is moving forward, the swing reaching the
point of no return _ and all too often, that is when they realize
that Martinez has thrown a changeup low and out of the strike zone,
or that he has spun a curveball.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the most part, he keeps the hitters guessing,'' said
Bernie Williams, the Yankee center fielder. ``You can't really sit
on any of his pitches, because he has such great control of them
that he can throw any of them at any point in the count.''
</P>
<P>
   And if the hitter correctly guesses fastball, he still has the
challenge of making solid contact. Martinez's fastball moves in,
away, sinks, darts, and his physical size and seemingly effortless
delivery add to the deception. ``He just sort of slings the ball,
like a rubber band,'' said Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``His arm and motion is just so free and easy,'' said Brosius.
``He has that real easy cheese, that easy fastball. He's not an
intimidating guy as far as size. He's not like Randy Johnson, or
like Kerry Wood, who's got all those body parts coming at you.
Pedro is nice and loose and _ wap! _ he's on you. You know he
throws hard, but he's sneaky.''
</P>
<P>
   Brosius batted in the seventh inning of the May 18 game against
Martinez, two out and two runners on base. The count reached two
strikes, and fresh in Brosius' mind was that curveball Martinez had
thrown, but he anticipated a fastball; that's what a batter must
do.
</P>
<P>
   With his 136th pitch, Martinez threw a fastball, 96 mph, belt
high. Brosius swung and missed, and as Martinez walked off the
mound, the Fenway fans exploded in cheers, Brosius staring at him
incredulously.
</P>
<P>
   In street clothes _ he prefers jeans _ Martinez has no
distinguishing characteristics. Thin torso and moustache, long and
unassuming face. The game's best pitcher is not loud, does not come
off as brash. He is polite. Watching him greet fans reaching to him
from the stands, you get the sense he treats everybody as he would
a grandparent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing about him is his humility,'' said Kerrigan.
``He never pounds his chest about what he's done, what he's
accomplished. You walk in this clubhouse, and you wouldn't know
from the interaction that he's done what he's done in the game. He
never brags, never boasts, never talks about himself, never talks
about goals, never talks about strikeouts. This guy doesn't have
one ounce of braggadocio in his body.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramon won 123 games in 11 seasons for the Dodgers before his
shoulder gave out and required surgery. He hasn't pitched in about
a year now, and since signing as a free agent with the Red Sox, he
is rehabilitating his arm. The Red Sox believe he will pitch again
this year, but there is no certainty of that.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ramon is the best pitcher in the Martinez family, Pedro
said; he says he never has believed he is better than Ramon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never did, and never will,'' said Pedro. ``Everything I know,
I learned from him, and to me, Ramon will always be some kind of an
older teacher, someone I really respect and admire.''
</P>
<P>
   Their lockers are adjacent in the Boston clubhouse. When Pedro
pitches, he will return to the bench and sit next to Ramon, and
Ramon will counsel his little brother, telling him what he thinks
he did wrong, reviewing his mechanics, suggesting adjustments.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is Pedro's sounding board,'' said Kerrigan. ``He is his
pitching coach. They're best friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramon had a throwing session on the Fenway Park mound a couple
of weeks ago, and as the older brother tossed fastballs and
changeups to Kerrigan, Pedro crouched on the back of the mound,
watching his big brother, as he did when he was a teen-ager. If
Pedro Martinez somehow finds a way to win 30 games, he will be the
first pitcher to do so in more than 30 years, but still, he
maintains, the second-best pitcher in his family. That will never
change. Never.

Grivich diaries speak to young athletes, parents
<TEXT>
<P>
   By JOHN P. LOPEZ
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   The diaries _ dozens of them _ were spread across Helen
Grivich's bed like a quilt, covering every inch of it with a
tapestry of colors.
</P>
<P>
   The books were piled high. It was as if the skies opened and
down came the letters from heaven that over the past two years have
drenched Grivich with an all-too-late understanding.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the diaries were bound with images of daisies, some with
roses, others with flowers of every sort. There were purples and
pinks and yellows. Many of the books were covered with images and
pictures of kittens.
</P>
<P>
   The bindings on some were tattered. Others looked as if they
were kept together only with string and cardboard.
</P>
<P>
   But these were the letters from heaven Grivich wishes every
parent of every young aspiring athlete could read.
</P>
<P>
   These were the letters from heaven that were penned during
Hilary Grivich's all-too-short life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I knew then what I know now,'' Helen Grivich said.
</P>
<P>
   More, she wishes every parent can learn from them.
</P>
<P>
   Two years have passed since Hilary Grivich, a one-time
Olympic-level gymnast and aspiring Olympic diver, died just days
before her 20th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   A horrifying automobile accident on Houston's north side took
Grivich when everything in her often-troubled, often-confused life
finally seemed on course. Two years have passed since the promise
died, leaving so many friends and fans heartbroken.
</P>
<P>
   After her daughter's death, Helen Grivich went through her
daughter's room and began thumbing through the pages of the
numerous diaries Hilary kept for nearly 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   The heartfelt words, revealing emotions and biting commentary
expressed by Hilary continue to ring through Helen Grivich's mind.
There were literally thousands of entries Hilary wrote from roughly
her eighth birthday until just two days before her death in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   She intimately discussed everything. From the excitement of
joining Bela Karolyi's gym to the rigorous demands placed on her by
coaches. From the highs of winning a gymnastics World Championship
medal to the lows of being scored unfairly in the 1992 Olympic
Trials. From the heartbreak of losing her grandparents to the torn
emotions of being caught in her parents' divorce and the many ups
and downs of being a teen-age girl in a grown-up world.
</P>
<P>
   And as painful as some of those passages are for Helen Grivich
to make public, she has done it because she can't help but think:
Maybe some other parents can learn from it all.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe some other teen-age athlete feels those same emotions, and
their parents simply do not know. Or care. Maybe some other parents
can learn from the passion with which Hilary wrote and the mistakes
Helen and Peter Grivich made.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so revealing about teen-agers and how their feelings get
hurt and how we speak to them as parents,'' Helen Grivich said.
``It hurts me to know what she was feeling when we thought
everything was great. It's revealing to know how we treat them and
what they feel. It's important for parents to know.''
</P>
<P>
   Hilary began writing the diaries at her mother's urging, because
as a rising young gymnast at age 8, Hilary often would be away from
home. Helen Grivich wanted her daughter to have something in which
she could confide when her parents were not around.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though she spoke to us a lot, the diary was her safe
place,'' Helen Grivich said. ``She took it everywhere. You learn
awful things about yourself when you read them. You learn all these
little things about how she hurt inside, about what you did without
even realizing it. I want (the public) to have them, because it's
like, do other parents know this?''
</P>
<P>
   Early in her gymnastics career, most of the passages in Hilary's
diaries were filled with typical hopes and dreams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got to work out with the elites today!'' she wrote as an
8-year-old in 1986. ``I'm so excited. Someday, I'm going to the
Olympics. I just know it.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet even then, Grivich at times revealed the pressures she was
feeling from her parents and coaches and the pain under which she
had to perform.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, I don't know what to think anymore,'' she wrote in
1986. ``Everyone seems to take things out on me. One minute they're
really nice and the next they're as nasty as can be and I hate,
hate, hate them. I never know what's coming next. Don't they know
that sometimes I just hurt a lot?''
</P>
<P>
   The diaries cover every part of Grivich's life, but perhaps most
revealing are the teen-age years when Grivich joined Karolyi's
elite team and worked toward the 1991 World Championships and the
1992 Olympic Games with the likes of Kim Zmeskal, Betty Okino and
Kerri Strug.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1991, as injuries mounted and the pressure to make the
1991 World Championship team mounted, Hilary wrote: ``I'm hurting
all over and no one seems to care. My back is killing me. I have
diarrhea all the time and I don't know why. Sometimes, I get sick
to my stomach and I feel like I puke up everything I've had in my
stomach since 1978. I don't know why I put up with all of this.
Bela is treating me like crap.. Am I that bad? I missed a landing
today and my back really hurt. Bela got (mad) and kicked me out of
practice and told me to come back with a better attitude. My life
would be a hell of a lot better if I'd never met the son of a
bitch. But I'll show him who the real idiot is. I'm going to be the
best no matter what it takes. I'll show him just how stupid he is
for ever calling me a failure.''
</P>
<P>
   Grivich, of course, made the 1991 team and was the leadoff
athlete in what proved to be an unprecedented silver-medal
performance by the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hilary Grivich NEVER gives up,'' she wrote in 1991. ``We did
it! What an awesome feeling to have that medal around your neck.
Next stop, Barcelona!''
</P>
<P>
   On the inside cover of a 1992 diary, Grivich wrote: ``This is my
Barcelona diary!''
</P>
<P>
   But later, she scratched through those words and wrote, ``Due to
rather unfair and unfortunate circumstances at (Olympic) Trials,
this Barcelona Diary is being written from my bed in Huntsville.''
</P>
<P>
   At those 1992 trials, Grivich fell victim to a horrible
political battle by USA Gymnastics. Most observers considered
Grivich among the best gymnasts at the trials, but she consistently
was scored low _ in part, many said, because of resentment many
judges and coaches had against Karolyi's heavy hand in the sport.
</P>
<P>
   Grivich watched the 1992 Olympics from home; Zmeskal, Okino and
Strug made it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried,'' Grivich wrote the day after the 1992 trials. ``I
did everything good, but the judges chewed me up and spit me out.
Why? Obviously, somebody didn't want me on the team. Jesus, why do
I fit into this mess? After they announced the team, I was sitting
on a mat and I hadn't cried yet. But when I heard the announcer and
saw the team march out, I put my head in my hands and sobbed. I've
never hurt so bad. I have to start a new life.''
</P>
<P>
   She was 14 years old. Still, after the controversial trials,
Grivich's parents continued to urge her to train and work toward an
outside chance at making the team as an alternate, or perhaps
continue with hopes of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want out,'' Grivich wrote. ``I'm so sick of all of it. I
don't want it anymore, but everyone is telling me that I really do.
No, I don't! They can all go to hell. Why should I continue to kill
myself, with a broken shoulder and my back hurting so much? I'm
tired of the whole stupid thing. Of all people, Bela has been the
best. I've never felt so close to him. He said I will always be
Pluto _ the ultimate competitor, the strongest and most aggressive
person. He told me that without me, they'll be lucky to get a
bronze medal. I've made my decision. I'm retiring. Screw it.''
</P>
<P>
   Without Grivich, the USA team won the bronze medal; Zmeskal fell
short of individual all-around expectations after falling off the
balance beam during the compulsory competition. Through it all,
Hilary wrote about how her mother continued to pressure her to
compete.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother is being a real bitch,'' Grivich wrote. ``I weigh 90
pounds, that's five pounds more than my competition weight. She's
freaking out. She's bitching at me to run and exercise all day and
she's watching everything I eat. I truly cannot handle her like
this. This entire thing is giving me a complex. Every time
something like this happens, I drag up all those unpleasant
memories and re-piece together my shattered dream, all of which I'm
trying to safely tuck away in a padded cell in my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, while on an exhibition tour with the 1992 Olympic team,
Grivich continued to fight the tough feelings. This time, she often
shared her frustrations with Zmeskal, who also considered retiring
and felt the emotional pain of falling in Barcelona.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kim wants so much to prove to people that the Kim in Spain was
not the real her,'' Grivich wrote. ``She's afraid of failing, but
she's more afraid of having to live with these bad feelings for the
rest of her life. We talked until 4:30 in the morning yesterday.
She cried and I cried and I've never felt closer to anyone in my
life. Not even my family. If anyone understands what she's feeling,
it's me. I will never know what could have been. The only
difference for me was that I did my utmost, but was cruelly cheated
out of my lifelong dream.''
</P>
<P>
   A year later, Grivich decided to become a competitive diver. She
quickly rose through the ranks and earned a scholarship to the
University of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The competitive fires raged. She confided to her diary that
after competing for the Cougars and graduating in 1999, she would
spend this year training for the 2000 Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
   But as much as time passed and the sport changed, there still
were pressures that only Grivich's diary knew. Grivich's parents
divorced, complicating things even more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love you, diary,'' she wrote in 1995. ``In times of need, I
will always have you to turn to. At least I know that you will
listen without judging me. Somehow, you seem sympathetic.''
</P>
<P>
   In another passage, she wrote only: ``I want my daddy back.''
</P>
<P>
   Days later, she added: ``My mom is on me all the time and my dad
can't or won't deal with me. I'm ready to drop my scholarship and
start a new life. Again! Looking back on my life thus far, well,
it's sucked. Few and far between have been my fleeting moments of
joy and true happiness _ the 1991 worlds, the summer after I quit
gymnastics and the time I spent with my Nana and Gramps. I vaguely
remember a childhood. My life has fallen to pieces, as has my
family.''
</P>
<P>
   The passages in Grivich's diaries indicate that by 1996 she had
regained her composure, found numerous friends in diving and
established relationships with young men. Her performances in
diving reflected her confidence, as she placed in various meets
across the country.
</P>
<P>
   But then in the early summer of 1997, after spending the night
at a friend's house, Grivich got in her car and drove into town,
where she was supposed to meet her mother for breakfast. Somehow,
her car apparently swerved into a concrete barrier and flipped
several times. She was dead at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``She always handled things well outside,'' Helen Grivich said.
``She always was laughing or acted like it was no big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Hilary's death, Helen Grivich often has reflected on the
words her daughter wrote. It has been sweet and yet painful for her
to watch her daughter's good friend, diver Laura Wilkinson, climb
the competitive ladder and become a favorite to make the 2000
Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkinson still regularly writes Helen Grivich, often sending
postcards from diving meets. Zmeskal sent Grivich flowers on
Mother's Day this year. Others often correspond.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those diaries are my most cherished possession,'' Grivich
said. ``I wish every parent could understand what I understand
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Helen Grivich bought a new diary for Hilary's birthday in 1997,
but she never had a chance to give it to her. On the cover is a
colorful drawing of a kitten with its forelegs spread wide-open as
if it is about to give its owner a hug. The kitten is wearing a
Hawaiian shirt
</P>
<P>
   After Hilary's death, Helen Grivich wrote this passage in the
diary she planned to give to her daughter. It was a response to all
those letters from heaven:
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope Hilary had a wonderful time on her last night alive.
The doorbell rang at 8 a.m. There were six policemen there. I knew
it was bad, bad, bad. (One officer) told me Hilary was killed
instantly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, how I love you and I miss you, Hilary. At night, I close
my eyes and I see your car flip, flip, flip. I see you inside,
upside down, crying, and I can't comfort you. I wish I could put my
head on your chest and feel your breath. Oh, Hilary, I worry about
you, but it's going to be all right. It's going to be all right.''

ARMSTRONG TAKES TIME TRIAL AND RECAPTURES LEADER'S JERSEY 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By SAMUEL ABT    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   METZ, France _ Lance Armstrong proved Sunday that he can ride a
long distance with the same power and purpose that he can ride a
short one, winning the Tour de France's first extended time trial
as easily as he won the brief prologue and taking a giant step
toward overall victory.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are two weeks left in the bicycle race and his
credentials in the highest Alps and Pyrenees are still to be
proven, Armstrong pulled on the overall leader's yellow jersey with
a gap of more than two minutes over the field and four minutes over
the men who are considered to be his main rivals.
</P>
<P>
   He seemed optimistic. ``My advisers told me before the Tour to
expect to be stronger in the mountains than in the time trials,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   If their forecast is accurate, Armstrong is sitting pretty. The
Texan, the 27-year-old leader of the U.S. Postal Service team,
crushed the rest of the 176-man field over 35 miles of twisty and
rolling roads. Riding alone against the clock, he caught and passed
a handful of riders who started two minutes apart before him,
including Abraham Olano, the world champion in the time trial.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong rode to victory in a time of 1:08.36, or 58 seconds
faster than the second-placed rider, Alex Zuelle, a Swiss with
Banesto, and 2:05 ahead of Christophe Moreau, a Frenchman with
Festina, in third place. Olano was fourth and another American,
Tyler Hamilton of the U.S. Postal Service team, was fifth.
</P>
<P>
   The race's new leader is 2:20 ahead of Moreau in second place
and 2:33 ahead of Olano, a Spaniard with ONCE, in third.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very long and very difficult,'' Armstrong said after he
finished, treading gingerly in his basic French during a television
interview. ``I'm very happy and very tired. It's one of the great
victories of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   He received a grand ovation from the French public, which knows
that his previous victories have included a battle in 1996 with
testicular cancer that spread to his lungs and brain. After three
months of chemotherapy, he sat out the 1997 season and returned to
racing full time in May last year.
</P>
<P>
   Mixed with the jubilation in the U.S. Postal Service camp,
however, there was a sense of caution. ``We were confident,'' said
the team's general manager, Mark Gorski, ``but you never can be
sure. Look what happened to Bobby.''
</P>
<P>
   He was referring to Bobby Julich, the American leader of the
Cofidis team and the third-place finisher in the last Tour. Julich,
27, crashed badly on a rapid descent and had to quit the race. He
was taken by ambulance to a hospital in Metz where X-rays revealed
no broken bones but he was treated for chest, rib, back and elbow
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong's victory was watched by his wife, Kristin, who was
visiting from their home in Nice for the day and who posted the
flag of Texas in his warm-up area.
</P>
<P>
   More helpful to his victory was the collaboration of Hamilton,
28, who started more than three hours ahead of his team leader.
</P>
<P>
   Although Hamilton finished second in the first time trial in the
last Tour, team strategy initially called for him not to ride this
eighth of 20 stages all out.
</P>
<P>
   Late Saturday that strategy was changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided I'd do the first half hard and we'd time every
kilometer for Lance,'' he said after he finished. ``It gives him a
good gauge because you get only a few time splits the whole ride.
Now he's going to get one every kilometer, off me.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the first half,'' Hamilton continued, ``they said if I
was doing well, I could keep going.''
</P>
<P>
   He was doing so well after the first timing that he was leading
the race. By the second, Hamilton was the fastest man to that
point, but Zuelle, who left two minutes after him, was 19 seconds
faster. That lead widened to the finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too much head wind,'' Hamilton said. ``It was hard, a little
guy in a headwind like that. A bigger rider has an advantage over
me in that wind.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton stands 5 feet 8 inches tall and weighs 140 pounds.
Zuelle is at least half a foot taller and Armstrong is listed at 5
feet 10 inches and 160 pounds.

STUFFING THE ONLINE BALLOT BOX
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By JON SWARZ 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  The Internet threw Major League Baseball a curve during
All-Star Game voting last week. A Boston hacker stuffed the virtual
ballot box to seemingly swing the vote to Red Sox shortstop Nomar
Garciaparra, who was locked in a tight race with New York Yankee
Derek Jeter.
<P>
   But Chris Nandor's attempt to pull off a Chicago-style election
result with 25,000 online tallies struck out after MLB officials
detected irregularities and voided the votes.
</P>
<P>
   That's the good news.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news is that MLB's director of new media can't guarantee
someone won't eventually succeed in logging enough virtual votes to
nominate journeyman Paul Sorrento as a starter to the midsummer
classic.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people can crack a government computer, they can crack a
computer that keeps track of ballots,'' Alex Kam said. ``Computers
aren't impenetrable.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor are they insignificant in the digital age. The grand old
game of baseball is increasingly more dependent on cyber votes to
select All-Star players. About 13 percent of the more than 3
million votes for tomorrow night's 70th All-Star Game in Boston
were cast over the Internet, up from about 8 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   Kam said MBL can only put ``reasonable limitations'' on
restricting the number of votes per online voter to 22. Like the
more traditional paper-balloting process conducted in baseball's 30
stadiums, MLB executives attempt to detect unusual voting patterns
_ such as the exact same votes coming from the same Internet
address _ over a short period of time.
</P>
<P>
   It was that detective work that fingered Nandor, whose burst of
last-minute votes for Red Sox players caught the attention of Kam
and others. Nandor and other would-be manipulators will have to
take solace from the age-old baseball refrain, ``Wait till next
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Nandor, 25, of Carver, Mass., did not return phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   THE EBAY OF IDEAS
</P>
<P>
   One of Silicon Valley's hottest startups lifts its kimono this
week.
</P>
<P>
   Epinions.com (www.epinions.com), formerly known as Round-One,
will announce an online consumer guide that relies exclusively on
the opinions of Joe Public about products ranging from sports
utility vehicles to Sony Walkmans. Epinions is banking on ad
revenues as its main source of income.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're focused on helping consumers make better buying
decisions,'' said Naval Ravikant, company co-founder and chief
executive officer. ``And we believe there are plenty of experts out
there who are passionate about specific subject matter.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mountain View, Calif., company _ stocked with hotshot
employees from America Online, Yahoo, AtHome, Apple Computer,
Netscape Communications and Hot Wired _ has raised the interest and
eyebrows of venture capitalists. Benchmark Capital and August
Capital just funneled $8 million into the 30-person company.
</P>
<P>
   MORE NET-ESCAPEES
</P>
<P>
   A team of 10 key engineers from Netscape also is working on a
secret startup. Last week, the first details of Geocast Network
Systems (www.geocast.com) began to surface.
</P>
<P>
   The Menlo Park, Calif., company is developing hardware and
software that would deliver full-screen video and CD-quality sound
to personal computers, according to Jon Mittelhauser, manager of
software products at Geocast.
</P>
<P>
   Geocast is expected to unveil its products next year.
</P>
<P>
   Industry buzz over Geocast is so high-pitched that VC rivals
Kleiner Perkins Caufield &AMP; Byers and the Mayfield Fund have each
invested in the 50-person startup. (The company's chief operating
officer, Alan Nichols Jr., previously was an executive vice
president of The Chronicle Publishing Co.)
</P>
<P>
   GEEKS FOR HIRE
</P>
<P>
   Remember the ragtag group of nerdy mercenaries who anonymously
offered their services in an eBay listing in April?
</P>
<P>
   Starting at $3.14 million, the team of 16 engineers _ who called
themselves ispteam _ offered wired-for-hire expertise.
</P>
<P>
   And they got a couple of feelers from at least five companies
before bagging the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Now one of the co-conspirators, John Kinsella, has decided to
give it another go. Only this time he isn't hiding behind a veil of
secrecy. Kinsella has opened a Web site, www.bid4geeks.com, that
auctions tech talent to the highest bidder.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to advertise the talents of individuals or teams of
workers for startups and established companies,'' said Kinsella,
25, a former Unix systems engineer at Digex, an Internet service
provider in Cupertino, Calif. ``With such incredible demand for
tech talent, we think this is the ultimate in online classified ads
for nerds.''
</P>
<P>
   RUMOR CENTRAL
</P>
<P>
   The snazzy new iMac laptop we first reported on in December
could emerge next week at the Macworld Expo computer show in New
York. The $2,000 translucent portable is considered crucial to
extending the company's recent run of success, and fills out
Apple's PC line.
</P>
<P>
   Apple declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, E-Trade Group denied scuttlebutt that it is
relocating some facilities from its Menlo Park, Calif.,
headquarters to San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Lastly, grumblings out of Mountain View, Calif., are that
America Online's payroll and commission system doesn't jibe with
Netscape's system, depriving Netscape sales representatives of
commission checks for the past four months. That's the rumor.
</P>
<P>
   The reality is that an administrative switch resulted in a
two-week delay in commission checks, according to the company.
Netscape sales reps should be paid by the end of the month.

LOWER BLOOD-ALCOHOL LIMIT DOES NOT REDUCE ACCIDENTS, STUDY FINDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., N.Y., N.J., Conn., Mass.)  (js) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The federal highway safety agency has overstated
the effectiveness of state laws that lower the percentage of
alcohol in the bloodstream needed to classify an individual as
legally drunk, a government review has found. The review concluded
that lowering the blood alcohol limit alone did not demonstrably
reduce the number or severity of alcohol-related car crashes.
</P>
<P>
   The review, by the General Accounting Office, challenged the
findings of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in
several published studies commissioned by the safety agency, which
supports tighter restrictions on drinking and driving.
</P>
<P>
   In its analysis of the data from the studies, the accounting
office found little statistical evidence to confirm that lowering
the permissible blood alcohol concentration to 0.08 percent, from
0.10 percent, significantly reduces the number of automobile
crashes. Rather, the accounting office concluded that the best
countermeasure against drunken driving was a combination of
vigorous enforcement of blood alcohol-level laws, strong laws
requiring that the licenses of violators be revoked and sustained
public education.
</P>
<P>
   The accounting office's finding undermines efforts by the
Clinton administration to establish a national standard of 0.08
percent. While 16 states and the District of Columbia have adopted
the 0.08 standard, most states, including New York, Connecticut and
New Jersey, have a limit of 0.10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, President Clinton endorsed a bill that would have
required the 35 states with a threshold of 0.10 percent to adopt a
standard of 0.08 percent within three years or lose 5 percent of
federal highway money the first year and 10 percent each succeeding
year. The Senate approved the proposal, but it was rejected by the
House.
</P>
<P>
   The accounting office, the congressional investigative agency,
concluded that the highway safety agency's position that the
evidence supported the stricter standard was ``overstated.'' The
accounting office report, released last month, criticized the
methodology of seven published studies on how motor vehicle crashes
and deaths had been affected by laws requiring the threshold of
0.08 percent.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One group of studies conducted by the highway safety agency from
1991 to 1995 cited California's law, which sets a limit of 0.08
percent, as evidence of the effectiveness of such limits in
general. But after reviewing the studies, the accounting office
report concluded that while a 1991 study by the safety agency did
find a 12 percent decline in alcohol-related deaths after the 0.08
percent law took effect in 1990, the study used only one year's
worth of data.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, six months after the 0.08 percent limit took effect,
California also subjected violators to the possible suspension or
revocation of their driver's licenses, a provision that could have
skewed the results, the accounting office said.
</P>
<P>
   The accounting office also faulted the methodology in a 1996
Boston University School of Public Health study published in the
American Journal of Public Health. This study sought to compare
drunken-driving deaths in the first five states to adopt the 0.08
percent standard with five nearby states that retained laws with
the 0.10 percent standard. According to the accounting office, the
Boston University study used one state as a yardstick to assess the
effectiveness of a new law in another state, incorrectly assuming
that all other conditions were equal. Three of the five states also
enacted laws to revoke driver's licenses within 10 months of
enacting laws for the lower limit.
</P>
<P>
   Mothers Against Drunk Driving favors a national 0.08 percent
standard but supports the accounting office's conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Research shows that virtually all drivers are substantially
impaired at 0.08 BAC and that 0.08 is a reasonable limit to set,''
said Karolyn Nunnallee, the organization's national president.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to the review, the Department of Transportation said
there was ``consistent evidence supporting the effectiveness of
0.08 BAC laws in reducing alcohol-related fatalities.''

DON'T WORRY THAT THERE ARE TOO MANY COOKBOOKS IN THE KITCHEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN OWEN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``John, we have too many cookbooks.''
</P>
<P>
   The first time my wife uttered that complaint, she was gazing at
5,000 copies of the first ``Intermediate Eater Cookbook,''
delivered to our basement.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Intermediate Eater cookbooks are distributed by this
newspaper. So when Alice complains that we have too many cookbooks,
she means the collection of other people's books lining two walls
of a study.
</P>
<P>
   OK, maybe we do have an excess. But what am I going to throw
away?
</P>
<P>
   Certainly not the ``Eskimo Cookbook'' prepared by students of
Shishmaref Day School in Alaska. Where else am I going to find
recipes for soured seal liver or oogruk flippers?
</P>
<P>
   And no, no, don't touch that 1943 copy of the ``Russian War
Relief Cookbook'' or the publication ``What's Cookin' With the
(Green Bay) Packer Wives?''
</P>
<P>
   Some pages are missing from a cookbook published in 1916 in
Montana's Judith Basin, but where today are you going to find a
recipe advising you to ``place small chicken in drip pan and cover
with sweet cream and butter. By the time cream has cooked away,
chicken will be done.''?
</P>
<P>
   My copy of ``Sudeley Castle Recipe Book'' tells me how to make
cowslip wine, pig's liver pudding and ``a medicine for the piles.''
A publication from Vinton, Iowa, contains Inge Schminke's recipe
for Napfkuchen and the authentic formula for the famous chicken
salad puffs served at Dubuque's Ham House Museum.
</P>
<P>
   I've got Shirley Fong-Torres' ``San Francisco Chinatown
Cookbook,'' Gordon Nelson's ``Lowbush Moose Cookbook'' from Alaska,
``Mama Leah's Jewish Kitchen'' from New York City and Buck
Peterson's ``International Road Kill Cookbook'' from Highway 99.
</P>
<P>
   I've got community cookbooks from Natchitoches, La., from the
Madison County Farm Bureau Women's Committee in Illinois, and from
Nancy Axell's 1980 kindergarten class on Mercer Island.
</P>
<P>
   I've got the ``Hotter Than Hell Cookbook,'' the ``Chili Lovers
Cookbook,''``Cow Country Cookbook'' and ``Dining with Charles
Dickens.''
</P>
<P>
   They are all absolutely indispensable. Somewhere in this
collection I found the inspiration or instructions for recipes like
these.
</P>
<P>
   Pot Lucky
</P>
<P>
   2 pounds lean ground beef or ground turkey
</P>
<P>
   2 medium onions, chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 pound fresh mushrooms, sliced
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons oregano
</P>
<P>
   One-quarter teaspoon garlic powder
</P>
<P>
   Salt
</P>
<P>
   4 packages (10 ounces each) frozen spinach, thawed
</P>
<P>
   2 cans cream of celery soup
</P>
<P>
   1 carton (1 pound) sour cream
</P>
<P>
   1 cup uncooked Minute Rice
</P>
<P>
   12 slices Monterey Jack cheese
</P>
<P>
   Saute the first three ingredients until the meat is brown and
the onions have softened. Stir in the oregano and garlic powder.
Add salt to taste. Dump this mess into a 11-by-16-inch oven dish.
</P>
<P>
   Drain the thawed spinach by squeezing it in your fist, then
distribute it over the meat mixture. Moosh everything around with a
wooden spoon.
</P>
<P>
   Mix the undiluted soup with the sour cream and stir into the
casserole. Add the rice, then moosh again.
</P>
<P>
   Add a top layer of cheese slices then shove the dish into a
350-degree oven and bake until bubbling, 20 to 30 minutes.

<P>
   Chill until ready to serve and with French bread on the side
this should suffice as the main dish for four farm wives or one

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On Fire Island, where the hot look for summer
gardeners now includes masking tape, long sleeves and multiple
pairs of socks, ticks drift down from the trees onto plates of
pasta, horrifying the guests.
</P>
<P>
   Upstate in Putnam County, a surveyor who makes his living
traipsing through high grass ends every workday hunched over a pair
of tweezers, hoping to yank the critters out of his skin before it
is too late.
</P>
<P>
   From Cape May to Kinderhook, from Cos Cob to Fair Harbor,
children, dogs and lawns are liberally doused with bug repellent
and pesticide, long-cherished gardens lie fallow, even down
payments on houses have been walked away from. In Ocean County,
N.J., at least one back yard has been pre-emptively covered with
asphalt.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, of course, is Ixodes scapularis, better known as
the deer tick, the scourge of suburbia that transmits the
unpleasant and occasionally irreversible neurological illness Lyme
disease.
</P>
<P>
   While tick populations are notoriously spotty and difficult to
generalize about _ one back yard could be lousy with them while
another down the road is virtually tick-free _ it has been a
particularly heavy season in some parts of the New York City
region, worse than ever, residents say, thanks in part to two mild
winters and a damp early spring.
</P>
<P>
   But for years in this part of the country, every year has been a
heavy one for deer ticks, their numbers and access to human hosts
continuing to increase as development creeps ever farther into the
woods. Notwithstanding the introduction this year of a new vaccine,
the experts say that Lyme disease, which sickens a total of 7,000
to 10,000 people each year in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut
and a few thousand more in the rest of the country, is here to
stay. So are the ticks.
</P>
<P>
   And as they have made themselves at home, the ticks have crawled
into the public consciousness and lodged there, subtly transforming
the fabric of life in leafy places (the Northeast in particular,
though deer ticks also abound in the upper Midwest and parts of
northern California and the Pacific Northwest).
</P>
<P>
   For anyone in tick zones who spends any appreciable time
outdoors, deer ticks have brought new sensations and rituals: the
daily once-over of self and children, the frequent phantom feelings
of tiny legs picking their way across the landscape of one's body,
the irritating sensation of a biting tick, the routine hassle of
deer-proof fences in places where people go to get away from
barriers.
</P>
<P>
   Ticks are not a recent problem. Dog ticks, which occasionally
carry Rocky Mountain spotted fever, were common in the Northeast
when the first settlers arrived and are still around. But deer
ticks, which feed on white-footed mice and deer as well as birds,
people and pets, are much more likely to be infected (an average of
25 percent carry Lyme disease).
</P>
<P>
   Their pinhead-sized nymphs, which are miniature versions of the
orange-brown adults and transmit nearly all the cases of Lyme
disease, are much smaller than dog ticks and thus harder to spot.
That makes them scarier and more dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mankind is an intensely visual species,'' said Dr. Leonard H.
Sigal, the director of the Lyme Disease Center at the Robert Wood
Johnson Medical School in New Brunswick, N.J.. ``We avoid risks by
seeing things. So when out of the wilderness comes an invisible
risk factor, it plays to all our environmental and development
anxieties. I think it plays to really primal concerns for homo
sapiens.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, Sigal said, precautions can be excessive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know of parents who spray their children with tick repellent
every time they go outside,'' he said. ``There are other people who
basically don't let their children go outside. Such is the concern
about the disease that there are people who have totally modified
their lifestyles to avoid a disease that you can largely avoid with
basic measures, and I find that really sad.''
</P>
<P>
   The basic measures he recommended include keeping lawns short,
using repellent on skin and clothes in tall grass and in the woods,
and checking oneself and one's children thoroughly to remove ticks
before they have time _ usually at least 24 hours _ to infect their
host.
</P>
<P>
   In Quogue, on the south shore of Long Island's East End, a
surveyor, Steven Marcks, said: ``I was talking to someone the other
day and he said they spray their property every 10 days. His kid's
probably got three heads.''
</P>
<P>
   But people who live and work in tick-infested areas have learned
the hard way that even diligently applying preventive measures,
including using repellent and pesticide religiously, can have
limited success.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Husik, the executive director of the New Jersey Society of
Professional Land Surveyors, said that the disease is practically
epidemic in his profession, and that most people on his block in
tick-conscious Princeton Township had at least one family member
who has had it.
</P>
<P>
   Some people would rather not talk about ticks, for business
reasons. An hour and a half north of New York City in Dutchess
County, which has overtaken Suffolk County in recent years as New
York's Lyme disease capital, a summer camp operator refused to
discuss how he dealt with ticks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather not be quoted because I don't want people to
associate there being a large number of ticks up here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But tick culture has perhaps reached its fullest flower on Fire
Island, the thin strip off Long Island's South Shore where the deer
and mice are innumerable and infested, gardens have to be carved
out of the reeds and woods without any room for a buffer zone, and
the summer season now usually ends with a Lyme test.
</P>
<P>
   In Saltaire, near the western end of of the island, Sheryl
London emerged from her rhubarb patch one recent Sunday and asked a
visitor, ``Would you like to see the museum?''
</P>
<P>
   Spread out on her kitchen table were several dozens of scraps of
paper, each with 1, 2, 3 or 12 ticks Scotch-taped to them and a
legend like ``Mel _ toe _ 8/30/96'' (Mel is her husband) or
``9/12/98 Sheryl _ groin.''
</P>
<P>
   But this year, Ms. London, a 73-year-old filmmaker and cookbook
author, stopped adding to the museum because there have been too
many ticks to keep track of. Like dozens of people on the island,
Ms. London, who started saving ticks to track their life cycle and
see when they were most numerous, said this year had been the worst
ever.
</P>
<P>
   Jane Ekstein, a real estate broker, tends the big garden
surrounding her house in Saltaire clad from head to toe in
unfashionable but tick-revealing white, except for the beige
masking tape that seals the border between her pant-legs and her
outer layer of socks.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the ticks somehow get through, so Ms. Ekstein, 56, and
her husband, Carl, spend a lot of time picking ticks off each
other. ``We groom each other like baboons,'' she said. ``It's a way
to add a little spice to your marriage.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Al and Jerene Goldsmith, who live nearby, have given up
gardening after 20 years, covering up their once lovingly tended
lot with a blank stretch of black felt. ``It's the worst we've ever
experienced,'' said Goldsmith, a retired salesman. ``My wife was
picking ticks off her already in May. She does most of the
gardening, and she didn't want to take the risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the region, two mild winters in a row seem to have
helped produce a bumper crop of ticks. (Scientists disagree on the
extent that tick numbers are influenced by temperature, but they
agree that it is one of many factors that may also include
humidity, host population and production of acorns, a favorite food
of white-footed mice.)
</P>
<P>
   ``We had ticks all through the winter,'' said Bruce Blair, a
surveyor in central New Jersey who also hunts deer. ``I was
dressing a couple of deer in Hunterdon County and I had to just let
them go because they were just loaded with ticks. I have to take
all kinds of special precautions now _ I have to wear rubber
gloves, can't save the parts, can't use the hide. Almost every bow
hunter I know now uses some sort of protection when he cleans a
deer.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunterdon County's chief sanitarian, John Van Nuys, said his
office had been logging better than a dozen calls a day this year _
the most he could remember _ from residents who have found ticks
that they are worried might be infected with Lyme disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost like turning a record on,'' he said. ``It gets to
a point where it becomes very repetitious.''
</P>
<P>
   Just in time for the infestation, there is a new vaccination
against Lyme disease this year, Lymerix, but it has met with a
mixed reception. According to the manufacturer, SmithKline Beecham,
300,000 doses had been administered as of late June _ representing
between 150,000 and 300,000 patients, since the vaccine needs to be
given twice in the first year. Sigal of the Robert Wood Johnson
Medical School said 300,000 sounded like ``a very tiny number''
compared with the millions of people at risk for Lyme disease.
</P>
<P>
   Potential customers have complained that the vaccine is
expensive _ about $300 for the full course of three shots _ only 78
percent effective, and is good for an unknown period of time. Mark
Husik, executive director of the New Jersey Society of Professional
Land Surveyors _ whose members are at extremely high risk for Lyme
disease _ said that many insurance plans refuse to cover the
vaccines, discouraging more people.
</P>
<P>
   Another drug maker, Pasteur Merieux Connaught, is developing a
vaccine called ImuLyme that it claims has been 92 percent effective
in trials, but it is still at least a year away from federal
approval.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a new, faster blood test for Lyme disease
available this year that gives a result in an hour, while the
traditional test can keep people waiting for up to two weeks. But
like the old test, the new one cannot be performed until four to
six weeks after a person is bitten, and even then it is often
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   At Fordham University's Louis Calder Center in Armonk,
Westchester County, Thomas J. Daniels, a biologist on the tick
study team, said that the deer-tick nymph population, which
generally peaks in late June and early July, does indeed appear to
be up this year.
</P>
<P>
   He should know. Since 1987, Daniels and his colleagues have run
what they believe to be the world's only catch-tag-and-release
study of ticks as part of their research into what natural factors
kill them.
</P>
<P>
   Although there tend to be more ticks in even-numbered years than
in odd ones (because a tick has a two-year life cycle, there are
essentially two separate populations, and the line that matures in
even years is more populous), the scientists found more ticks in
their first few days of collection this season than they did last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Daniels has developed a deep respect for ticks'
ability to adapt easily to new hosts and invade new areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're really pretty remarkable animals,'' he said. ``They're
incredible, actually.'' But even a fan's affection has its limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like them,'' he said. ``They keep me working, they keep me
employed, but if we could get rid of them, that'd be great. I'd be
more than happy to move on to something else.''

CHINA FEELS PAIN OF SOCCER LOSS

   BEIJING _ Those fateful penalty kicks.
</P>
<P>
   They were played and replayed over and over on television all
over China Sunday, stinging each time like pinpricks in the
consciousness of a nation whose hopes were deflated when Brandi
Chastain made the last of the penalty kicks to give the United
States a victory over China in the Women's World Cup final.
</P>
<P>
   ``So close, so close,'' said Ren Yihong, a 27-year-old computer
engineer, as he watched the replay as it was magnified by a row of
display television sets tuned to the same channel in a store on
Dongdan Street in central Beijing. ``It was a very close game. I
really thought we would win, but we were unlucky in the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Chinese soccer fans, as well as untold millions of other people
who were drawn in by contagious excitement and swelling national
pride at the Chinese team's success in getting to the tournament
final, were understandably crushed by the game's outcome.
</P>
<P>
   In Beijing, it was a drizzly and quiet day of mourning. Many
people on the street expressed disappointment, and the mood on
normally busy shopping streets was quiet, maybe because so many
viewers stayed up all night to watch the game, whose broadcast
began here at 4 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   The Beijing Youth Daily reported before the game on Saturday
that 91.4 percent of those polled said they planned to watch the
game, though how many actually did was anyone's guess.
</P>
<P>
   A Chinese victory, had those penalty kicks gone the other way,
would doubtless have provoked a spirited response. In fact, the
authorities here were apparently concerned at the possibility that
spontaneous demonstrations might break out, and they posted a
busload of armed police near the U.S. Embassy, just in case.
</P>
<P>
   Only two months ago, when NATO bombed the Chinese Embassy in
Belgrade, Yugoslavia, Chinese students paraded through the streets
for several days, throwing rocks at the U.S. Embassy as a wave of
virulent anti-Americanism swept through the nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
   A high-pitched World Cup final between teams from these two
nations might have been expected to reignite some of those
passions, since the issue is not officially over, with the Chinese
government still saying it does not accept Washington's explanation
that the bombing was accidental.
</P>
<P>
   Yet relatively little of that anti-Americanism seemed to be
fueling the enthusiasm of the fans, who appeared to cheer their
national team the same way they would have had the opponent been
Brazil, a semifinalist in the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinese team has played so well, I felt sure they would
win no matter who they played against,'' said Lang Min, a
24-year-old store attendant. ``I think it was American food. If
they had been eating Chinese food, they might have played better.''
</P>
<P>
   Tellingly, Lang said she was the lone soccer fan among her
friends who are women, who are not nearly as interested in soccer
as Chinese men are, though many decided to tune in for the final.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normally, if I want to talk about a game, I have to talk to my
brother,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Women's soccer has not yet captured the attention of Chinese
fans quite the way it has in the United States. That may seem odd,
since China is indeed a soccer-crazy nation, where domestic games
draw enormous attention and the men's World Cup is widely
considered the most important sports event in the world, even
though China has never qualified.
</P>
<P>
   Like many countries in Europe and in South America, China has a
madness for soccer that sometimes seems the rough equivalent of the
American passion for baseball, football, basketball and hockey
combined. Yet that enthusiasm did not cross over to this year's
appearance in the final by the women, since soccer is still seen by
many fans as more suitable for male athletes than female.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, women's volleyball, Ping-Pong and even weight
lifting are widely popular spectator sports.
</P>
<P>
   At the few sports bars sprinkled around Beijing, and at many of
the universities and schools where soccer fans gathered in large
groups to watch the game together, men appeared to outnumber women.
</P>
<P>
   Experienced soccer fans had various theories about why China
lost, close as the match was. Some fans were miffed that a header
by Fan Yunjie, blocked by Kristine Lilly close to the goal line,
was not actually called a goal. Others complained that the Chinese
team was tired from flying all over the United States for matches
on both coasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Home advantage, the Americans had that all through the
tournament,'' said Wang Longhai, 39. ``That's a big help.''
</P>
<P>
   His friend Shan Lihong had a different view on what the critical
element of the game was.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Americans were stronger midfield,'' Shan said. ``Both
sides have talent, both sides played well, both have good goalies.
Midfield was the American advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   China's media, often seeming eager to stir nationalist sentiment
in their coverage of the Women's World Cup, reported that President
Jiang Zemin was closely watching the team's progress and had
telephoned with encouragement before the game on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have demonstrated fully the aspiration to win honors for
the motherland,'' Jiang said, according to the New China News
Agency. ``Whether you win or lose, the whole nation and the people
will extend their warmest greetings to you.''

BUSH SEEKS SUPPORT AND MONEY FROM SILICON VALLEY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

   &QL; 
HOUSTON _ As fast as you can send e-mail, the computer industry and
its enterprising moguls are getting special attention from the
presidential campaigns of Gov. George W. Bush, Vice President Al
Gore and other leading contenders.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the early Republican front-runner, delivered his most
specific policy proposals so far to an audience of high-tech
honchos in California's Silicon Valley this month. Several of the
executives have signed onto his campaign, and last week he
appointed a ``technology advisory council'' headed by Texas
computer tycoon Michael Dell.
</P>
<P>
   Democrat Gore, a cyber-technology expert since his days in
Congress, has unveiled his own proposals aimed at helping the
computer sector, and he is backed by several industry leaders. His
circle of high-tech advisers includes a co-founder of Yahoo! Inc.,
Jerry Yang.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be outdone, Republican candidate John McCain and
Democratic hopeful Bill Bradley, among others, have secured
political alliances with some Silicon Valley leaders.
</P>
<P>
   After moving to the cutting edge of the U.S. economy, the
captains of computing now find themselves on the cutting edge of
national politics.
</P>
<P>
   Holly Bailey, who tracks campaign contributions for the
nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics in Washington, said the
industry's ``new rich'' provide only about 1 percent of the
campaign contributions raked in by Bush, Gore and others.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates make their Silicon Valley pilgrimages not just for
campaign money, but to show the nation that they are in tune with
one of the engines driving the national economy, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is some sort of status symbol whenever you align
yourself with the economy of the future,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, an approving nod from a Bill Gates type might be
worth a few million dollars worth of campaign advertising. Bush
held private discussions last week with executives at the
Seattle-area offices of Gates' company, Microsoft. This week he
attends a fund-raiser with a ``high-tech focus'' in McLean, Va.,
just outside Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the engine driving our economy,'' Bush spokesman David
Beckwith said about the computer industry. ``It is important that
government and politicians get high-tech right.''
</P>
<P>
   The economy grew during the Clinton administration, and Gore
advertises himself as the best choice to continue the federal
policies that seeded some of that growth. Having made technology
one of his pet issues as vice president, Gore also wants to be seen
as the one contender who aligned himself with the computer industry
before the Internet and e-mail came into popular public use.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vice president has always been there for the high-tech
community ... before the industry even displayed the tremendous
impact that it currently holds,'' campaign spokesman Roger Salazar
said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Bush's campaign operatives confide that they
are trying to position him as the best choice to lead ``the new
economy'' _ a phrase that pops often in Silicon Valley, the area of
California from the southern border of San Francisco to San Jose,
where dozens of computer companies are headquartered.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's emphasis on education and limited government, plus his
ties to high-tech firms that have created more jobs in Texas than
the oil industry in recent years, make him attractive to the
computer industry, his aides say.
</P>
<P>
   Added to the mix is the fact that computer industry has been
identified as Democrat-leaning because of the liberal atmosphere of
California, Republican-leaning because of interests in low taxes
and Libertarian-leaning because of its aversion to government
regulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are all of those things,'' said Richard Brody, a
political science professor at Stanford University in Palo Alto,
Calif., the heart of Silicon Valley. ``What unites them, if
anything, is a belief in technology and a desire to kind of be left
alone to do the job.''
</P>
<P>
   As the economy rebounded during the Clinton administration, the
computer industry generally supported the Democrats, Brody said.
Now Bush is raising eyebrows by raising campaign money from some of
the executives, he explained.
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons for the shift, Brody said, is ``a natural
return to Republicanism'' by business leaders who are concerned
about their stock portfolios and tax liabilities. Another reason,
he continued, is that Bush is leading the early voter polls and is
telling the computer industry what it wants to hear.
</P>
<P>
   Bush pointed out to industry leaders this month that Texas
became one of the first states to enact a law restricting lawsuits
based on the so-called Y2K computer problem, which he described as
``the biggest potential ambulance chase in a millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   His policy proposals included making the Internet duty and
tariff-free worldwide, stepping up government efforts against the
piracy of American-made computer software, increasing the
immigration of high-skilled foreign workers and making permanent
the federal tax credits for industrial research and development.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's speech came a few weeks after Gore laid out some of the
same high-tech proposals in New Hampshire, which has enjoyed an
economic resurgence thanks to the computer industry.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, too, wants to make the tax break on research and
development permanent, and more accessible to smaller businesses.
He pledged to press for international agreement making the Internet
free of duties and tariffs. He wants to double the government's
investment in high-tech research.
</P>
<P>
   And his boss, Clinton, sided with the Republican-controlled
Congress on a bill shielding businesses from Y2K lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   So from the leading Republican and Democratic candidates, this
is stereo music to the ears of Technet, a computer industry
lobbying group that is stepping up Silicon Valley's relationship
with federal lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Computer industry executives gave a total of only $200,000 to
the presidential candidates in 1996, according to the Center for
Responsive Politics. For the 2000 election, such contributions have
already exceeded that amount. Many observers say the government's
antitrust case against Microsoft was a wake-up call for computer
executives to become more conscious of government policies and
campaign politics.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of this year's contributions in the first three months
of 1996 went to Bush and Gore. Industry wizard Steven Jobs from
Apple Computer gave money to Bradley's campaign, symbolizing that
Bush and Gore do not have a lock on the support.
</P>
<P>
   The computer industry contributed $8.8 million to 1996
congressional candidates, with 56 percent going to Republicans,
according to the center.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people have deemed Silicon Valley as Clinton-Gore
country, and that is completely inaccurate because a lot of
computer gurus are both Democrat and Republican,'' Bailey said.
</P>
<P>
   For computer industry leaders aggravated by government
interference, there is the irony that the Internet grew out of a
government system used by the Department of Defense. Also, industry
trade groups are lobbying for more government investment in basic
computer research,which Gore has promised.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Lezlee Westine, a Bush supporter who works for the
bipartisan Technet, contended that the Texas governor attracts
Silicon Valley support because his ``basic instincts'' are to keep
government out of the industry's way.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of how the executives line up in the presidential
race, Bailey warily sees the current campaigns as the beginning of
a long political tango between politicians and the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians will continue to covet contributions from people
acquiring new wealth, and the newly wealthy will continue to fend
off policies that could limit the wealth, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Should voters be concerned about the rise of a new special
interest group?
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever you see politicians out there mining contributions
from anybody who looks to be profiting off the booming economy, I
think there is some cause for concern,'' she said.

GOP SCRAMBLES TO FIND RIGHT MESSAGE AND MESSENGER
<TEXT>
<P>
   By GREG McDONALD &QL;
</P>
<P>
   c. 1999 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republicans edgy about the prospect of losing their
majority hold on Congress are shifting strategies for getting their
message out to the American people. Complicating their effort are
the lack of a unified message and congressional leaders adroit at
communicating one then following through.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., for example, has abdicated
his leadership role on a number of issues, particularly during the
recent gun control debate. Or he has yielded to House Majority Whip
Tom DeLay, R-Texas, who has emerged this year as a leading voice of
the GOP's right wing in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., meanwhile, has
alienated many GOP colleagues by refusing to accommodate their
concerns on several key legislative matters and by yielding to
conservative members opposed to everything from campaign finance
reform to U.S. involvement in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   With Lott and Hastert struggling to keep order in the ranks as
the 2000 elections draw near, some Republican lawmakers have begun
looking for signals from Gov. George W. Bush on issues ranging from
gun control to spending and tax matters.
</P>
<P>
   Following the lead of the GOP presidential front-runner poses
other problems for lawmakers. Sometimes his counsel is out of step
with a majority of Americans _ he said no to a three-day waiting
period on gun purchases while most of the nation was saying yes.
Also, Bush has yet to fully formulate or lay out his positions on a
wide range of key issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hunger for a winner as much as anything has caused
(Republicans in Congress) to look for a candidate they can unite
behind. And George W. is the guy who has emerged, partly because of
his own qualities and partly because they don't see anyone else out
there,'' said Norman Ornstein, a congressional scholar at the
American Enterprise Institute.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that the message he has may fit Texas, but
doesn't fit the rest of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   If Republicans are serious about keeping their majority hold on
Congress next year, Ornstein said there will have to be ``a natural
leadership'' from Congress that can help lawmakers develop a
message that resonates with local voters, if not the nation as a
whole.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're clearly foundering and floundering inside Congress.
... There seems to be no strategic capability at all, no sense of
what (legislative) ends they want to achieve,'' Ornstein said,
adding that Hastert, whom he calls, ``the accidental speaker,''
still ``hasn't figured out how to be a leader.''
</P>
<P>
   Hastert is trying to change that. He and his lieutenants have
devised a plan to speak out more forcefully on issues like Social
Security, Medicare, education and taxes. Later this month, Hastert
will seek more exposure outside the Capitol, like on the Sunday
television talk shows, in an attempt to get some sort of consistent
message out to voters about what electing Republicans to Congress
next year means for the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Charles O. Jones, a political science professor at the
University of Wisconsin and a senior fellow of government studies
at the Brookings Institution, says none of that will matter in the
end if GOP lawmakers cannot overcome the differences within their
own ranks over key issues like spending and tax cuts. Moreover,
Jones says the lack of strong Republican leadership in the 106th
Congress may be more a result of numbers than any lack of ability
on Hastert's part.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got one of the narrowest margins ever in the House,''
Jones said, referring to the Republicans' 11-seat edge over the 211
Democrats and one independent in the House. That means that the
defection of only six Republicans on an issue can jeopardize GOP
priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert, Jones said, has to be ``constantly supersensitive'' to
the differing views within his conference, ``because if he loses a
few (votes), the only way he can win is to get a fair number of
Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's staring at a kind of nonmaneuverable Republican majority
in many ways ... with many members having competing interests,''
Jones added. ``Under these circumstances, it's hard to imagine how
you can be forceful and say `this is what our message is going to
be, now you guys toe the line.'''
</P>
<P>
   Jones said he could not imagine former Rep. Bob Livingston, who
stepped down earlier this year before being confirmed as speaker,
or former House Speaker Newt Gingrich for that matter, doing much
better given the current divisiveness within the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't expect really effective leadership ... could operate
under these present circumstances. The best you can do is
essentially keep your mouth shut, listen, try to find out where the
hell you can put together a majority, and stop announcing
deadlines'' for passing legislation, Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that Hastert would do well to emulate the leadership
style of former Speaker Sam Rayburn, a Texas Democrat who wielded
immense power a half-century ago with a slim majority by working
quietly behind the scenes and not announcing what he intended to
accomplish.
</P>
<P>
   Public pronouncements, however, are part of the GOP's strategy.
Sometimes the Republicans' public declarations come back to haunt
them, as in 1995 when they promised not to budge on spending
levels, then took the blame for shutting the government.
</P>
<P>
   The miscalculation still lingers in the public's mind. A recent
poll by Western Wats Opinion Research Center found 41 percent of
Americans rating the Republican-controlled Congress as doing a fair
job. Another 37 percent say Congress is doing a poor job of
attending to the interests of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the Republican leadership has pledged publicly to
push through all 13 appropriations bills before the Oct. 1 start of
the new fiscal year. They plan to do it without lifting any of the
spending caps set in 1997 to help balance the budget.
</P>
<P>
   With Clinton threatening to veto many of the spending bills,
Republicans face having to negotiate with the Democratic president
so they can avoid having to pass temporary spending bills, as they
did last year, or, worse yet, shuttering the government again on
the eve of the 2000 elections.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert already has signaled that he wants to work a deal with
Clinton, but any overtures to the White House could alienate the
GOP's hardline conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   Still, bargaining with a Democratic president, whose approval
ratings remain much higher than the Republican Congress, may be the
only choice Hastert and Lott have if they are to complete this
year's legislative work on time.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got a serious migraine ahead,'' Ornstein warned. ``The
fact is that if you do not begin to adjust the caps on
discretionary spending, the budget is a dead issue.... If they get
into a position of where they have a government shutdown and then
have to cave to the president, they'll have a disaster on their
hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones predicted that Hastert and Lott will end up doing what
smart leaders always do when its called for _ compromise, even if
it doesn't sit well with some of their members.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has a stake in there being accommodation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton is thinking about his legacy and doesn't want to go
out being known as the veto president. And (the Republicans) don't
want to go into the election ... without a semi-productive session
of Congress,'' Jones said. ``There's just too much riding on going
into the election with a positive rating rather than a negative
one.''

ECONOMY CREATING BULGING WAR CHESTS FOR ALL LEVELS OF CANDIDATES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Kan., Ky., Md. Mich., Nev., N.J., S.C., Texas)   (rk) 
 By ADAM CLYMER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. Shelley Berkley, a freshman Democrat from
Nevada, has raised nearly half a million dollars in 10 weeks.
Mayoral candidates who are not even favorites are also filling
their war chests. And the Democratic National Committee is out of
debt.
</P>
<P>
   At all levels, the political system is awash in money. Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas may have the most startling bankroll _
$36.3 million _ but he is part of a phenomenon and not the
phenomenon itself.
</P>
<P>
   As candidates for federal office and the national party
committees prepare to file their midyear fund-raising reports with
the Federal Election Commission, it is becoming clear that money
for the 2000 elections is rushing in faster than ever. The strong
economy has made it easier to get contributions, and candidates are
mobilizing their fund-raising efforts earlier than in previous
election cycles.
</P>
<P>
   Fund-raising has become the chief barometer of early political
strength, so candidates have been working feverishly to fortify
their war chests. And lack of money can be a sign of terminal
weakness.
</P>
<P>
   For example, one major factor when Dennis Moore ran in 1998 for
a Kansas congressional seat where no Democrat had won in 40 years
was that Rep. Vince Snowbarger's June 30, 1997, campaign finance
report showed he had only $9,567 in cash on hand. Moore won a
narrow victory.
</P>
<P>
   In the six months since he was sworn in, Moore has worked the
phones almost every day to make sure no one sees him as financially
vulnerable this year. ``I like to learn from other people's
mistakes, not my own,'' he said. Next week his campaign will report
about $310,000 cash on hand, a startling total for a freshman.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. James E. Rogan of California read that President Clinton
and various Hollywood figures had targeted him for defeat after his
role as an impeachment manager. But other people read that too, and
1,000 of them sent him campaign contributions. So he started a
direct mail campaign that has succeeded beyond all expectations,
and he will report more than $750,000 in the bank next week.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's $36.3 million presidential take is spectacular, but
others are raking it in, too. Bill Bradley, basically running as
``not Al Gore,'' took in $11.5 million. The National Republican
Congressional Committee reports a record haul. The Democratic
National Committee is, of all things, out of debt for the first
time since September 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Political consultants of both parties report that money is
easier to raise than they can remember.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've even seen it in a few mayoral campaigns this year,'' said
David Dixon, a Democratic operative here. ``Even the sort of
midlevel candidates are raising more money than ever before.''
</P>
<P>
   Consultants and political strategists start with a predictable
set of explanations, largely independent of party.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, they say, their candidate or party has really
caught the national mood and people want to help. Secondarily,
their staffs have done a terrific job.
</P>
<P>
   And finally _ eagerly from the Democrats and in passing from the
Republicans _ they add, in the words of Shelly Kamins, a developer
from Potomac, Md., who runs Bush events here: ``Certainly one of
the factors is the prosperity in the country. You've got a lot more
people who are able to give a thousand dollars.''
</P>

<P>

</P>
<P>
   Dixon said local contributions were increasing, as new
businesses were turning good profits. ``Fifteen years ago you asked
them to work phone banks,'' he said of these donors. ``Now you ask
them to contribute.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, donors sometimes do not have to be asked. Ronald
Weiser, Bush's chairman in Michigan, said he found the enthusiasm
for his candidate ``absolutely amazing.'' In past campaigns, he
said, it was hard work to find supporters, especially people who
would take on fund-raising. ``This year they are coming to us,
asking if they can raise money for Bush. We say yes, they can.''
</P>
<P>
   For most candidates for Congress _ an intense battleground
because a six-seat shift would give Democrats control _ the calls
have to be made. Steve Gray-Barkan, a California consultant working
for Adam Schiff, Rogan's likely opponent, hails his client as ``a
fanatical phoner.'' Berkley of Nevada, who has raised $485,000 this
year, almost all of it since she returned from a honeymoon in
April, said, ``I'm relentless on the telephone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``After you've been turned down 10 times,'' she said, ``picking
up the phone and making the 11th call, that's the secret.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore said: ``I hate to make these calls, but it's a fact of
life. You've got to do it if you want to stay in Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Rachel Gorlin, a Democratic consultant, said those calls may be
easier to make than they used to be, when ``candidates just dreaded
picking up the phone and calling people _ likely as not to hear
complaints.'' Now, she said, the reception is likely to be civil
and to lead to a contribution.
</P>
<P>
   Where is this leading? Norman J. Ornstein, a congressional
scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, an economic and
political research foundation here, sees one likely impact of all
the money that seems to be available.
</P>
<P>
   In the race for the House, he said, there will probably be only
25 or 30 districts that seem competitive by the fall of 2000,
``races where both sides spend $2 million and where you get outside
groups spending a few million more.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result of a 1996 Supreme Court decision, those ``outside
groups'' will include, in a big way, the national party committees.
Some of them will not file reports until July 20, but what their
spokesmen say indicates they are all sharing in the wealth. Even
the Republican Senate Campaign Committee, whose reports through May
show lower receipts than two years ago, is comfortably in the
black, and will be more so in a couple of weeks when it receives
its half of a record-breaking $9 million joint House-Senate dinner.
</P>
<P>
   At the Republican National Committee, prospecting for new
donors, while expensive, has turned up 51,000 fresh checkbooks _
``a huge number of people to join a party in an off-year,'' said
Mike Collins, the press secretary. The National Republican
Congressional Committee will report a record-breaking $26 million
take, and, more to the point, its cash on hand is at $9.3 million,
compared with $5.7 million two years ago and $4.5 million four
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Democratic committees, the House campaign committee
expects to report more than $14 million raised, or more than twice
as much as it took in two years ago. The Senate campaign committee
will report $3.9 million in cash on hand, eight times as much as
two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Jordan, the committee's political director under Sen. Bob
Torricelli of New Jersey, the chairman, called the haul a tribute
``as much to hard work and a talented staff and a determined
chairman as to economic conditions or macro political issues.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Democratic National Committee expects to report $21
million in fund-raising and a surplus of $500,000 to $700,000. The
chairman, Joe Andrew, said the high numbers were attributable
largely to ``the Clinton-Gore economy, the best in a generation.''
</P>
<P>
   Fred Wertheimer, an architect of the 1974 Federal Election
Campaign Act who now leads an advocacy organization called
Democracy 21, sees prosperity as only one factor in the torrent of
money available.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the brakes are off the system,'' Wertheimer said. When
Bush's ``Pioneers,'' his club of leading fund-raisers, ``are
raising $100,000 at $1,000 a contribution,'' Wertheimer said,
``they will be raising a million or more each when they start
collecting soft money.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a different stratosphere here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, head of the Republican Senate
Campaign Committee and his party's chief opponent of change in the
campaign finance laws, disagreed. ``For most Americans if they are
interested in politics at all,'' he said, ``the way they express
that is they write out a check for their favorite candidate or
cause.''
</P>
<P>
   The big ideological causes whose backers send money are likely
to be the usual ones: guns, abortion and gay rights. But there is
one new one, impeachment. There is even an Impeachment Managers
Political Action Committee, which hopes to raise $130,000 through
an Internet site that has brought in some money already without an
official start-up. The modest financial goal would be enough to
give each of the 13 impeachment managers $5,000 for a primary and
$5,000 for the general election.
</P>
<P>
   But even if ideology directs some of the dollars, it is the
economy that is providing them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is pouring money in,'' said Tom Downey, a lobbyist
here who raises money for various Democrats. ``They are rich and
the economy's strong. At every level there is more money.''
</P>
<P>
   Warren Tompkins, a Republican consultant in Columbia, S.C.,
said, ``People are making more money and they are willing to let go
of a little of it.''

THE NUMBER OF MINORITY JOURNALISTS IS NOT GROWING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash., Calif.)  (lb) 
 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ If the gathering here last week had been a medical
convention, it would have been billed as a gathering of experts
seeking cures for terminal nearsightedness. More than 5,000
minority journalists _ and hundreds more people who train them,
hire them, study their work, make their computers and advertise
with their news organizations _ spent days debating what news
organizations must do to put the world in focus.
</P>
<P>
   The overarching assumption was that major news organizations
will have continuing trouble keeping their audiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to paint a more complete picture of America,'' was the
way that Catalina Camia, the president of Unity: Journalists of
Color Inc., put it at the opening session of the group's second
national convention, which brought together members of the National
Association of Black Journalists, the Asian-American Journalists'
Association, the Native American Journalists Association and the
National Association of Hispanic Journalists.
</P>
<P>
   The event nearly foundered nine months ago when a faction of the
black group said that Washington state was not a fit site because
it passed an anti-affirmative-action initiative. But after
rancorous debate, the groups voted to keep the gathering in
Seattle. So for some, the existence of the convention was a
victory. But for many, jobs mattered most.
</P>
<P>
   ``More people of color in the newsrooms _ that's the bottom-line
goal of all of the four organizations,'' said Sheila Brooks, a
member of the National Association of Black Journalists who is
chief executive of SAB Productions Inc., a television and video
production company. ``But it's not going to change unless we pound
and pound and pound.'' The convention included a job fair where
scores of news organizations interviewed minority candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've made at least one hire here _ at least,'' said Leonard
Downie Jr., the executive editor of The Washington Post. Rob Dean,
the managing editor of The New Mexican in Santa Fe, with a
circulation of 25,000, had not filled the job opening he had, but
said he talked to about 15 candidates and is taking six resumes
home.
</P>
<P>
   Telly Hughes, a recent graduate of Illinois State University
who, at 21, is looking for an entry-level job in broadcasting, came
away with a fistful of business cards and a headful of advice. ``I
can't believe these established people take time to talk to me,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   But hovering near the surface of this gathering was the
knowledge that in the years since Unity had its first convention in
Atlanta in 1995, the number of Hispanic, Native American, Asian and
black newspaper journalists has risen to only 11.55 percent from
10.49 percent, for a total of 6,365 journalists out of 55,100 in
newspaper newsrooms, according to an annual diversity survey of the
American Society of Newspaper Editors.
</P>
<P>
   But in local television stations, minorities in the work force
dropped to 19 percent in 1998 from 21 percent in 1996, according to
the Radio-Television News Directors Association.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau estimates that 28 percent of the country's
population belongs to one of those four minority groups; that
figure is expected to reach almost 38 percent by 2025.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the stubbornness of the statistics and the sense at the
convention that minority journalists are leaving the profession
faster than they can be replaced did not dampen the spirits of some
for whom the convention is like a family reunion.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers were pleased to see network correspondents and the
publishers or editors of the United States' five largest newspapers
who came to recruit, and three presidential candidates who
addressed the group.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The jam-packed schedule featured multiple seminars by day _
sometimes six at a time _ and multiple parties by night, at least
six at a time. Sponsors included companies like Knight-Ridder Inc.,
Apple Computer Inc. and Adolph Coors Co.
</P>
<P>
   As the convention started, the Freedom Forum, a foundation based
n Washington, D.C., released a survey showing that more than half
of minority journalists plan to leave the business in the next five
years, even though 60 percent of them said that they liked their
jobs ``very much.'' Figures for nonminority journalists were
unavailable.
</P>
<P>
   The apparent paradox in the survey can perhaps be explained by
ex-journalists like Mary Lou Fulton and Ron Funabiki. Ms. Fulton,
whose mother is Mexican, describes her eight-year journalism
career, mostly at The Los Angeles Times, in tones that mix real
gratitude with deep dissatisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Newspapers often believe that if you have enough
different-colored noses in a newsroom, that's going to make a
better newspaper,'' said Ms. Fulton, who was by turns a local
reporter and the editor of The Los Angeles Times' short-lived City
Weekly. ``I think having enough noses is essential, but you also
have to have different coverage strategies.''
</P>
<P>
   She praised the newspaper's new Hispanic desk, saying that
earlier coverage of minority communities was one-dimensional.
</P>
<P>
   But for all that, she said, nothing could have kept her from the
lure of the Internet, which she discovered five years ago after she
had received a master's degree in public administration. Now 35,
``an old woman'' in her new world, she is leaving her job as a vice
president for editorial operations of Yahoo's Geocities unit and is
being interviewed for top jobs at two Internet start-ups, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Funabiki, 50, who is Japanese-American, spent twice as much time
in the business as Ms. Fulton, but reflected the same mix of
satisfaction and frustration. At The San Diego Union, he had some
choice assignments, including a self-designed beat covering the
economics of the Pacific Rim. But Funabiki said he felt his career
prospects were limited.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't really angry or upset, but I wasn't satisfied with
things, either,'' he said. In 1990, after 19 years in the business,
he accepted an offer to start a new program at San Francisco State
University focused on analyzing mainstream journalism. After five
years, he moved to the Ford Foundation as a program officer.
</P>
<P>
   Both Funabiki and Ms. Fulton came back to Unity this week _ Ms.
Fulton as a panelist for a session on high-technology with Vice
President Al Gore, and Funabiki to see how Unity used some of the
$400,000 in grants Ford has made to it in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The reality of attrition, however, is making it hard to keep the
minority numbers rising. A recent article in American Editor cited
studies showing that journalism schools overall are producing about
750 minority print journalists a year _ exactly the number of
people who, like Funabiki and Ms. Fulton, have been lost to
attrition.

MEXICO STUDENTS CONTINUE STRIKE ON EMPTY CAMPUS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk)

<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Digging in their heels, student protesters have
decided once again to continue their strike at Mexico's huge
national university, now in its 12th week, even though there are no
longer any classes for them to strike.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the despairing authorities of the National Autonomous
University of Mexico declared a formal end to the spring semester,
which they had extended several times while trying to resolve the
strike.
</P>
<P>
   Since there is no summer session, no one will even try to give
classes on the vast campus until mid-August. But the strikers voted
in a midnight session Saturday to maintain their shutdown even
though the university is shutting down on its own.
</P>
<P>
   Figures offered by the administration reveal the dimensions of
the political confrontation at the university, the largest and once
one of the most prestigious in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   About 192,000 students who did not support the strike attended
classes that were held off campus to avoid the demonstrators, and
were able to complete the semester with credit, officials said. But
78,000 students backed the strike and failed to finish their
courses.
</P>
<P>
   Brigades of students still occupy the campus and guard
barricades blocking the entrances. Hundreds of strikers have been
in residence on the campus, which has no dormitories, since the
strike began. Their blankets and freshly washed socks hang from
classroom balconies.
</P>
<P>
   The largest union of blue-collar workers at the university
announced that some of its members had agreed to work without pay
to help the strikers through the summer break.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, strikers and university officials began talks. But
they immediately argued about procedure, with the administration
calling for a closed negotiation and the students demanding to have
the talks broadcast live on television.
</P>
<P>
   While the government has said it does not want to use force to
evict the strikers, that option seemed to be an increasingly real
possibility.
</P>
<P>
   The defense minister, Gen. Enrique Cervantes, ruled out any
action by the military, to avoid a repeat of what happened during
the 1968 student movement. A whole generation of Mexicans turned
against the army after it killed dozens of protesters during a
Mexico City demonstration that year. But Attorney General Jorge
Madrazo Cuellar was less categorical, saying only that he hoped he
would not have to dispatch federal police to take back the campus.
</P>
<P>
   The strike began as a protest of a plan by the university
president, Francisco Barnes de Castro, to charge a modest tuition
for those who could afford it. But it quickly swelled into a
movement against all cutbacks on federal spending for higher
education in Mexico and any efforts to tighten academic standards
at the university.
</P>
<P>
   At the outset Barnes badly miscalculated the strength and
determination of the student movement and went from blunder to
blunder in handling the strike. On June 7, he withdrew his plan to
raise tuition to about $150 a year from its current rate,
equivalent to about 2 American cents. But he did not approach the
strikers ahead of time to see how they would react. Strike leaders
spurned his initiative as too limited and pressed on with the
shutdown.
</P>
<P>
   The strike movement has become dominated by unbending leaders,
some of whom have made careers of activism at the university and
have shown no solid interest in settling with the administration.
</P>
<P>
   While the public seems largely fed up with the strike, the
protesters have picked up some outside support. Consulta, a polling
firm, found that 83 percent of the people surveyed in Mexico City
were in favor of raising tuition at the university before the
strike, but by mid-June only 55 percent supported the change.
</P>
<P>
   Many passers-by signaled their support for the students, who
marched to the capital's central square on Friday to announce they
were not giving up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an old man and I've seen how this country runs,'' said
Salvador Perez Gomez, a 68-year-old merchant who watched the march
from the sidelines. ``We have to defend ourselves against this
lousy government and make sure they don't take away our children's
right to an education.''

TV RATING FOR U.S.-CHINA SOCCER MATCH SURPRISES ABC 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Women's World Cup victory by the U.S. team over China on
Saturday produced an astonishing 13.3 overnight Nielsen rating, at
least doubling ABC's expectations.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, the National Basketball Association finals
between the Knicks and San Antonio Spurs generated an 11.3 average
national rating.
</P>
<P>
   The network estimated that about 40 million viewers watched all
or part of the Women's World Cup game.
</P>
<P>
   The game started at 3:30 p.m. with a 7.6 rating, rose to an 18.8
from 6:15 to 6:30 p.m., and concluded with a 16.1 from 6:30 to 6:45
p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The rating nearly doubled last year's 6.9 overnight rating for
the men's World Cup final between Brazil and France, and edged out
the 12.8 for the 1994 Italy-Brazil World Cup final that was played
in the U.S. The highest-rated U.S. game that year was a 10.4,
against Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very gratifying to know that huge events still have the
power to bring in huge ratings on network TV,'' said Mark Mandel, a
spokesman for ABC Sports. ``Clearly there are still opportunities
for networks to bring in huge numbers when games are highly
dramatic.'' &QL;

U.S. WANTS MILOSEVIC OUT BUT WAVERS OVER SUPPORTING A SUCCESSOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: With optional trims.) 
(js) 
 By JANE PERLEZ    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Despite its clear desire to see President Slobodan
Milosevic of Yugoslavia ousted, the Clinton administration is
finding it difficult to capitalize on the opportunity presented by
the opposition protests that have bubbled up across Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   The question of new leadership in Yugoslavia is as troubling as
it is important, not only because Milosevic has been indicted on
charges of war crimes, administration officials said, but because
without the participation of Yugoslavia it will be hard to build
stability in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   But for the moment, a wait-and-see attitude prevails in
Washington, even though the Clinton administration has made clear
that it considers Milosevic an international outlaw who should be
brought to justice.
</P>
<P>
   The main problem, administration officials acknowledge, is that
they are wary of the current opposition leaders who might succeed
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the administration had a favorite successor, its ability
to advance that person decisively is limited, the officials said.
Further, after 11 weeks of NATO bombing, even tacit support from
Washington might only taint a successor's standing with the Serbian
public.
</P>
<P>
   Thus administration officials said they were being careful not
to back anyone in particular and have instead decided to stick with
their policy of trying to isolate Milosevic and generate hardship
for his powerful circle of cronies.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said they are disillusioned with the opposition
leaders who galvanized crowds in Belgrade against Milosevic in the
winter of 1996-97.
</P>
<P>
   One official said the administration has written off as an
``opportunist'' Vuk Draskovic, one of the leaders of the street
demonstrations who later joined the Milosevic government and has
now been ousted.
</P>
<P>
   Another leader of that period, Zoran Djindjic, who remained in
opposition and lived in Montenegro during the Kosovo war, is not
favored by Washington either, said a senior administration official
involved in trying to find some cohesion in the emerging
anti-Milosevic movement. Officials say they believe that Djindjic
lacks the necessary support and leadership skills to propel the
anti-Milosevic movement forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``We shouldn't pick a winner,'' this official said, as he left
over the weekend for Europe, where he planned to meet some
anti-Milosevic activists, whom he refused to identify. ``The
Europeans are making a dramatic mistake by picking Djindjic as
their poster boy. He has very little support. We should let the
people pick a winner.''
</P>
<P>
   In trying to foster an opposition to Milosevic, the
administration faces tough hurdles, some of which stem from having
just waged a war against Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   The United States no longer has an embassy in Belgrade, and has
no plans for one, according to the State Department. Thus, making
contact with opposition party mayors in towns where the protests
have sprung up is almost impossible. Even in 1996, with an embassy,
U.S. officials had trouble forging links to the anti-Milosevic
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   The tougher hurdle is the nature of the problem: Undermining
Milosevic is not as easy, some argue, as was unseating the regimes
in Eastern Europe during the dying days of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Milosevic is an ultra-nationalist,'' said James R. Hooper,
executive director of the Balkan Action Council, an independent
group specializing in Balkans policy. ``He's not a Communist like
those in Eastern Europe who were held in power by the Soviet Union.
Here the roots go very deep, lots of Serbs have given real or
passive support. There have been few regimes like this before.''
The closest similarity could be made with fascist Italy or Nazi
Germany, Hooper said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM HERE)
</P>
<P>
   But Hooper suggested that the model of Portugal in the 1970s was
a helpful one. There, he said, the United States _ and especially
German political parties _ encouraged Mario Soares, the founder of
the anti-Communist Party Socialist Party. In the aftermath of the
1974 army-led revolution, Soares came to power and eventually
helped lead Portugal into the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM HERE)
</P>
<P>
   In Serbia, the Yugoslav army is one element that remains an
uncertainty. Historically, the army has been a proud institution of
the Yugoslav nation. Milosevic has repeatedly purged its ranks,
leaving his ciphers at the top. But disgruntled army reservists,
talking darkly about the war in Kosovo and bitter about their lack
of pay, participated in some anti-Milosevic rallies last week,
particularly in Leskovac, a longtime stronghold of the Yugoslav
leader.
</P>
<P>
   But what practical effect such sentiments would have in the
coming months is difficult to judge. ``The Yugoslav army does not
have a history of coups,'' a senior administration official said.
``This is not Latin America.''
</P>
<P>
   The tactic most favored for encouraging the unrest appears to be
isolation of the regime. With a little pressure here, a little
pressure there, the hope is that Milosevic will be asphyxiated.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But the administration is beginning to consider how to help some
areas of Serbia where opposition party mayors are in power.
Reconstruction aid has been ruled out but humanitarian aid will be
considered, President Clinton has said. One way to use humanitarian
aid as an example against Milosevic would be to restore power at a
hospital in a municipality where the opposition is in control,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Another isolation tactic is of symbolic importance. Much of
Milosevic's standing with his own people was bolstered by the
continual bustle of international figures who came to visit him,
often on ``last ditch'' missions to warn against his policies,
which Serbian television would then transform into spectacles
aggrandizing Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Now, those visits have stopped. And he, his family and his inner
circle are marooned inside Serbia. Milosevic rarely traveled
anyway, but now there are few places he can go without being
arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Of personal annoyance to his tight knit family _ consisting of
Milosevic; his wife, Mirjana Markovic; their son, Marko; daughter
in law, Milica, and daughter, Marija _ was the recent refusal by
the Greek Embassy in Belgrade to grant Marko Milosevic a visa for
travel to Greece.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM HERE)
</P>
<P>
   According to accounts in Belgrade, the young Milosevic, who
carries a diplomatic passport, applied for a visa to Greece after
the Kosovo war. After about 10 days, according to one account, the
Greek Embassy returned the passport without explanation and without
a visa.
</P>
<P>
   About 300 of the elder Milosevic's cronies, most of whom hold
sizable bank accounts and property holdings abroad, are on a visa
ban list that was created by the European Union before the NATO air
strikes. Some of them, including Bogoljub Karic, the owner of
Serbian banks and a television station that toes the Milosevic
political line, are getting restless.
</P>
<P>
   Karic is reported to have been turned back at the Serbian border
with Hungary and is known in Belgrade to be complaining that he is
unable to tend to his investments in London. In the weeks leading
up to Milosevic's agreement with NATO, Karic and other loyalists
who have become wealthy through Milosevic's favors are believed to
have encouraged the settlement, administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Alongside this isolation strategy, the administration is also
trying to provide the Serbian opposition with some encouragement
and role models. Clinton is planning at the end of the month to
attend a one-day jamboree, scheduled for Sarajevo, of 30 Western
European and Balkan leaders. It will be a day, administration
officials predict, of grand proclamations of a new dawn for the
Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Absent will be Slobodan Milosevic. Present will be Milo
Djukanovic, president of Montenegro, the junior republic to Serbia
in Yugoslavia. It was Djukanovic who broke with Milosevic two years
ago and who received moral and financial support from the West
during the Kosovo war.
</P>
<P>
   These days, he is the State Department's model of an opposition
leader.

   EREZ CROSSING, Gaza Strip _ At this sun-baked juncture between
Israel and the Gaza Strip, the first Israeli-Palestinian summit
meeting in seven months began Sunday with an embrace and an
exchange of gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, presented Ehud Barak, the
new prime minister of Israel, with a dove-shaped Hanukkah menorah.
Barak gave Arafat a leather boxed set of the Koran and the Bible.
</P>
<P>
   And then the two men, a retired guerrilla fighter and a retired
general, who had spent most of their lives in violent conflict,
engaged in a 65-minute ice-breaker of a conversation, which seemed
to have gone swimmingly. When they emerged, Barak discreetly
grabbed Arafat, who looked frail, by the elbow of his trademark
fatigues and helped him up steps onto a stage.
</P>
<P>
   Standing side by side at lecterns, both leaders professed that a
new era of peacemaking lay ahead, in which they would be partners.
Arafat nodded vigorously as Barak, with pursed lips and a resolute
glare, said he was ``determined to overcome all the obstacles.''
</P>
<P>
   The rhetoric and the body language signaled a radical shift in
the tense, hostile relations of the last few years. This meeting,
which took place just five days after Barak assumed office,
produced a kind of good chemistry more than anything substantial.
</P>
<P>
   Barak did allay an anxiety of the Palestinians by promising that
he would move quickly to carry out the most recent peace agreement,
the so-called Wye River peace memorandum, named for the Maryland
site where it was negotiated. The agreement has been frozen since
December.
</P>
<P>
   But Barak did not engage another of Arafat's chief concerns,
about the recent expansion of Jewish settlements in the West Bank.
He repeated his coalition's platform, saying that there would be no
new settlements and no demolition of existing ones. And he deferred
a substantive conversation on that and all other issues until after
his return from a one-week trip to Washington that starts Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Saying that Barak's resounding victory in May had raised hopes
for peace throughout the region, Arafat addressed the Israeli prime
minister as ``my friend and my partner.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am confident today that together we can give the peace
process seriously and truly the chance it deserves,'' Arafat said.
``It's time to put an end to the cycle of violence and
confrontation.''
</P>
<P>
   Answering in kind, Barak sounded determinedly, even lyrically,
hopeful. Although he did say also that a renewed effort at
peacemaking would inevitably have ``ups and downs and crises.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Chairman,'' he said, using Arafat's title as head of the
Palestine Liberation Organization, ``fathers, mothers and children,
Palestinians and Israelis alike, are waiting, expecting us, the
leaders, to provide them with a safer, better future. We should
find every drop of determination and leadership in our own souls to
do the job and change the landscape of this region.''
</P>
<P>
   Two days after taking office last week, Barak set off on a
whirlwind diplomatic tour intended to kick-start the stagnant peace
effort. He began with a cordial meeting with Hosni Mubarak, the
Egyptian president, on Friday, and following Sunday's meeting he
will see King Abdullah of Jordan and President Suleyman Demirel of
Turkey before flying to the United States for a one-week visit.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For the Palestinians, this first meeting with Barak was fraught
with expectations. They wanted not only a change in atmospherics,
which they definitely got, but a promise that some tangible
benefits would be forthcoming. Like Barak, Arafat is more patient
than those who surround him, but the Palestinian people are
frustrated and demand a peace dividend from their aging leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very moved by their beautiful words,'' said Mohammed
Jabr, a Ramallah resident, who watched the event on television.
``But now that I have wiped away the tears of my emotions, I would
like to see some actions.''
</P>
<P>
   Last December, about a week before the Israelis were supposed to
turn over a large chunk of the West Bank, Benjamin Netanyahu, the
former prime minister, suspended compliance with the Wye memorandum
after carrying out the first phase of the three-phased agreement.
He said that the Palestinians were failing to meet their
obligations to improve security.
</P>
<P>
   When Barak was elected on a peace platform, the Palestinians
expected him to immediately thaw out the frozen Wye agreement,
which provided interim steps to peace, like the return of land and
prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   But instead he unnerved them by saying he would prefer to delay
carrying out Wye until the pending final status accords were
negotiated. That way, the final negotiations could begin
immediately and all the issues, ranging from land to Jerusalem to
the return of refugees, could be looked at as a whole, he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Arafat demanded that the Wye accord be carried out.
And Barak said it would be; Israeli army officials are reportedly
making preparations for the next hand-over of land _ about 7
percent of the West Bank, reportedly in the Ramallah area.
</P>
<P>
   But Barak may have made some headway. Nabil Shaath, a
Palestinian Cabinet minister, said after the meeting that if the
next phase of the Wye agreement were carried out swiftly, the
Palestinians would consider moving into the final status talks
before the third phase _ the hand-over of a final 13 percent of
land, reportedly in the Hebron area _ was undertaken.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will implement Wye and we will coordinate with the chairman
and the Palestinian Authority the way by which the advancement of
the final status negotiations will be combined with Wye's
implementation,'' Barak said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the land, some other components of Wye, like the
approval of a seaport in Gaza and the release of more political
prisoners, could probably be carried out relatively quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat demanded that Israel immediately stop all Jewish
settlement activity in the West Bank, calling it ``illegal and
destructive to the peace process.'' But the composition of Barak's
coalition, which includes the settlers' party, two ultra-Orthodox
parties and a relatively hawkish Russian immigrant party, would
make it difficult for him to take too hard a line on the
settlements.
</P>
<P>
   And the settlers' organizations, whose leaders say they have
tried in vain to see Barak, are gearing up to test him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The really painful problem that should be troubling the prime
minister is whether we're going to evacuate settlements, whether
thousands of Jews will be evacuated from their homes,'' Pinchas
Wallerstein, a settler leader, told Israeli Army Radio. ``Yes or
no?''
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians have also been concerned that Barak would
ignore them, devoting more energy to pursuing peace with Syria.
Barak, however, has said that he will seek peace on both fronts at
once in his ambitious pursuit of harmony in the whole region.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Arafat surprisingly went out of his way to endorse
the total regional approach. He said he hoped to see ``peace on all
tracks, including Syria and Lebanon.''
</P>
<P>
   Repeatedly, Arafat referred to the new Israeli prime minister as
a possible heir to the partnership he once forged with Yitzhak
Rabin, the late prime minister who used to be a mentor to Barak.
</P>
<P>
   In the style of Rabin, Barak chose to welcome Arafat on Sunday
by descending a stairway from the military compound building where
he was waiting. Dressed in a navy suit, he strode to greet the
Palestinian leader, who was clad in his traditional olive-drab
khakis, with a keffiyeh scarf wrapped around his head.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, who is a short man, put his arm around Arafat, who is
even shorter. He shook his hand, and they set off into what is
bound to be a complicated relationship.

AS COLOMBIA DECLARES AN ALERT, REBEL OFFENSIVE RAGES ON
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By LARRY ROHTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ Leftist guerrillas in Colombia renewed
attacks on more than twenty towns Sunday after a government decree
set a dusk-to-dawn partial curfew in nearly one-third of the
country and ordered the armed forces into a state of alert.
</P>
<P>
   Clashes between the army and units of the Revolutionary Armed
Forces of Colombia were reported to have left more than 180
guerrillas, soldiers, police officers and civilians dead in several
areas of southeastern Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   News reports from Bogota, the capital, said the guerrillas had
even attacked military barracks with homemade tanks built from
tractors, and missiles constructed from gas canisters.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an escalation that is going to continue,'' Gen.
Fernando Tapias, commander-in-chief of the Colombian armed forces,
said on Saturday in announcing the military alert for the 120,000
members of the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   He said his troops had ``neutralized 98 percent'' of what he
described as ``these insane terrorist actions,'' but that
assertion, as well as official estimates of the death toll, could
not be independently confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   The emergency measures announced late Saturday prohibit all
highway and river travel between sunset and dawn in most of the
southeastern part of the country and give mayors there authority to
extend the ban to daylight hours. But Interior Minister Nestor
Martinez sought in television interviews to play down the
importance of the restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   The provinces covered by the order encompass areas that the
government has formally ceded to the guerrillas in an effort to
jump-start peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a curfew,'' Martinez said. ``What we are doing is
limiting the free circulation of vehicles between municipalities.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez said ordinary Colombians should not be affected,
because the restrictions applied only to places ``where private
citizens should not be.'' The travel prohibitions will last, he
said, ``as long as necessary to assure that the insurgents cannot
be reinforced.''
</P>
<P>
   The limited curfew applies to all or part of 10 of Colombia's 32
provinces. Most of the areas affected are sparsely populated jungle
and savanna areas, but one, Cundinamarca, borders the capital. It
was the focus of a fierce guerrilla attack barely 25 miles from
Bogota on Thursday that resulted in the deaths of at least 78
soldiers and guerrillas and signaled the start of a stepped-up
campaign by the rebel group.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the Colombian military said, a radio message was
intercepted in which Jorge Briceno, the second in command of the
guerrilla group, was heard ordering a subordinate to ``blockade
Bogota by the roads, and then we will advance.''
</P>
<P>
   Military spokesmen have suggested that the rebels' aim was to
reach the outskirts of the capital, perhaps to free leaders and
fighters of the rebel group held in prisons there.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to calm the population in the capital, Tapias said
his troops had taken ``all the security measures necessary to avoid
terrorist acts in Bogota,'' which has a population of seven
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``An action of that sort would cause great impact among the
population and have grave repercussions for the economy and foreign
investment,'' he acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   The rebel group has been seeking to install a revolutionary
Marxist state in Colombia since the 1960s but has usually confined
its attacks to rural areas and stayed away from cities.
</P>
<P>
   But its strength has grown in the last three years to about
15,000 fighters. In a show of increased mobility and firepower late
last year, the group attacked and briefly held Mitu, a remote
provincial capital in the Amazon.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of any public declarations, the reasons the
guerrillas have mounted an offensive now are unclear. They were
scheduled to begin formal peace negotiations with the government on
July 7, but a two-week postponement of the talks was announced less
than 24 hours before they were to begin. A statement by both sides
said some members of the rebel delegation could not reach the site
of the talks in time.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional wisdom is that the guerrillas are seeking to
improve their bargaining position when the talks finally get under
way. ``This offensive intends to show an image of strength before
the opening of peace negotiations with the national government,''
Tapias said on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   But there is also speculation that the ``initiation of talks was
itself a tactic of war'' designed to lull the government into
complacency, as the daily El Pais in Cali put it Sunday. The paper
said the guerrillas also wanted to intimidate ordinary Colombians
into thinking that ``they are in better conditions than the armed
forces to produce a military victory.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, guerrilla leaders warned that they were
preparing a ``first great offensive'' to be carried out if they
were not satisfied with the course of the peace efforts. Those
threats were amplified last week by a rebel commander and
spokesman, Javier Calderon, who warned in an interview published in
an Argentine newspaper that the talks were ``the last flame of
hope, and if that flame goes out, there will be total war.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want total war,'' Calderon said. ``We don't want the
Colombian people to continue immersed in this war. But we will wage
it if necessary.'' And he added, ``We are prepared for it.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Such threats appear to have eroded the rebel group's standing as
a political force.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guerrillas cannot take power without political backing,
and right now their popularity is at its lowest level,'' Defense
Minister Luis Fernando Ramirez said in an interview published
Sunday in the Bogota daily El Espectador.
</P>
<P>
   But the offensive is also a setback for President Andres
Pastrana, who has staked his presidency on a pledge to bring an end
to a conflict that has killed 35,000 Colombians in the last decade
alone.
</P>
<P>
   Since taking office in August 1998, Pastrana has made a series
of concessions to the rebels as good-faith gestures, including
giving them control of a Switzerland-size region that they appear
to have used as a base to mount the attacks of recent days.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels have not made similar concessions. They have refused
to decree a cease-fire while talks are held, and public support for
the peace talks is diminishing. In a poll published this month, for
instance, nearly three-quarters of those surveyed described the
rebels as a terrorist group with no ideology other than kidnapping
and drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   Even the influential Roman Catholic Church, which has strongly
supported Pastrana's peace efforts, appears to have joined the
skeptics.
</P>
<P>
   In a pastoral letter issued on Saturday at the conclusion of its
annual assembly, the national bishops' conference warned of ``a
dark panorama that has no limits,'' saying that ``clear
possibilities of success cannot be seen, and the civilian
population is less and less secure in a country buffeted by the
winds of war and death.''

SMASHING WINDOWS: UPSTART COMPANIES SET TO LAUNCH CHEAP,
SIMPLE  INTERNET PCS
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By HENRY NORR 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Bill Gates may not be quaking in his boots just yet, but a new
generation of personal computers without Windows will soon begin
tempting consumers looking for a cheap, simple and reliable way to
join the Internet revolution.
<P>
   Aside from the Apple iMac's growing but still modest market
share, virtually every home computer sold today comes with Windows
pre-installed. But in recent weeks several manufacturers have
announced new PCs, due over the next few months, that won't have
Windows or any other software from Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, these unorthodox PC-makers are turning to alternatives
old and new to control their computers' basic operations and create
their look and feel. By Christmas, shoppers in the market for a
cheap PC will be able to choose among products that run the BeOS, a
modern multimedia-oriented system developed by Be Inc. of Menlo
Park, Calif.; Linux, the cooperatively developed, freely
distributed operating system that's recently made a splash in
corporate and technical markets; and even a new version of GEOS, a
decade-old graphical software environment that appeared to have
succumbed to the Windows tide years ago.
</P>
<P>
   PIA
</P>
<P>
   Ebiz Enterprises, a PC vendor in Scottsdale, Ariz., last week
disclosed plans for a Linux-based device called PIA, for Personal
Internet Appliance, which it plans to release next month at $199,
sans monitor. Aimed both at first-time buyers and at families
seeking a second or third PC, it will be sold through the company's
online outlet, the Linux Store (www.cpumicromart.com), and through
Internet service providers.
</P>
<P>
   Prodigy, a national ISP that claims more than 600,000
subscribers, was the first to announce its intent to market the
device _ part of a rapidly emerging trend for ISPs to offer
subsidized hardware for customers who commit to use their service.
</P>
<P>
   Ebiz officials last week were keeping mum about product details,
pending a preview on ``Good Morning, America'' on  &LR; July 15 &LR;  and a
formal unveiling at next month's LinuxWorld trade show in San Jose.
But they confirmed that the machine will come in a conventional PC
case and include an AMD chip, 32 megabytes of memory, a
2.1-gigabyte hard drive and a slot for expansion cards, such as a
network adapter or 3-D graphics accelerator.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Linux and the Gnome point-and-click interface for
it, bundled software will include Netscape's Communicator Web
browsing and e-mail software, plus a variety of Web plug-in
programs, an MP3 digital music player and an undisclosed word
processing program.
</P>
<P>
   iToaster
</P>
<P>
   Microworkz Inc. (www.microworkz.com), a Linwood, Wash., &LR; 
 &LR; company that first attracted national attention when it introduced
a stripped-down Windows PC at $299 earlier this year, is slated to
begin shipping a BeOS-based box priced at $199 later this month.
Designed to look more like a component in a home-entertainment
system than like a traditional PC, it will come with a keyboard,
mouse and standard PC ports, but no monitor, floppy drive, CD-ROM
or expansion slots.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of DEVICE12 () &QL; 
 &LR;  Customers for whom even $199 is out of range can opt for an
installment plan that provides the iToaster, a 15-inch color
monitor, technical support and 150 hours per month of Internet
access through Microworkz for $19.95 per month for two years.
</P>
<P>
   The device will run on a stripped-down version of the modular Be
system. Microworkz has developed a custom look for it, including a
main screen with large icons that will take users directly to
popular Internet sites, such as online booksellers and travel
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Microworkz spokeswoman Luanne Brown denied published reports
that the machine will use a hybrid of Linux and the BeOS.
</P>
<P>
   Industry sources said Microworkz has also licensed Gobe
Productive, a BeOS application suite from Gobe Software of
Portland, Ore. Created by the original developers of Apple's
ClarisWorks suite, it includes word processing, spreadsheet,
graphics and other modules.
</P>
<P>
   The BeOS, which Apple once considered buying for its Macs, was
designed to excel in processing digital audio and video, and until
now it has mainly been used in machines aimed at professional
multimedia producers. But in recent months Be has also been
promoting the system's suitability for use in simplified ``Internet
appliances'' like the iToaster.
</P>
<P>
   Be, ironically, is now partly owned by Microsoft's longtime PC
partner, chip giant Intel, which took a 10 percent stake last year.
Be's initial public offering is scheduled for later this week.
</P>
<P>
   GlobalPC
</P>
<P>
   The most surprising entry in the emerging non-Windows PC
marketplace is due this fall from an Alameda, Calif., startup
called GlobalPC. The company has licensed GEOS, a graphical
environment and application suite that runs on top of DOS, from its
original creator, Geoworks, an Alameda neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   When first released in the late 1980s, GEOS won critical acclaim
as an efficient and easy-to-use alternative to the complexities of
DOS, which required users to type in arcane commands.
</P>
<P>
   But when Microsoft released Windows 3.0 in 1991, GEOS' fortunes
faded fast. In recent years Geoworks has moved in new directions _
it now markets software for sending travel and consumer information
to cell phone users _ and is no longer investing in GEOS. But
GlobalPC officials said their own engineers have modernized the
system.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to integrating Internet software, they have further
simplified the user interface for novice users, according to Peter
Dille, GlobalPC vice president of marketing.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of DEVICE12 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  GlobalPC's hardware, as yet unnamed, will be released in selected
markets this fall, with national distribution slated to begin next
year. It will cost $299, without monitor, but owners will able to
use a standard TV screen as a display.
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging that it has yet to sign any distribution
agreements, the company said its plan is to market the system
through mass-market outlets such as Wal-Mart and Kmart, in hopes of
reaching customers intimidated by the prospect of shopping in a
computer store or even an electronics outlet.
</P>
<P>
   The GlobalPC story took an intriguing twist last month, when a
Jacksonville, Fla., company named Compu-DAWN signed a letter of
intent to acquire it. Compu-DAWN's chairman is R. E. ``Teddy''
Turner IV, son of media magnate Ted Turner. (The younger Turner is
also chairman of the board of U.S. Bison Co., an Atlanta bison
ranching company, according to Compu-DAWN filings with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.)
</P>
<P>
   Compu-DAWN was previously involved in several lines of business,
including marketing specialized hardware and software to
public-safety agencies and Amway-style ``multi-level marketing'' of
telecommunications services and digital set-top boxes to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, however, the company has sold its public-safety
product group, announced plans to phase out direct marketing in
favor of distribution through mass merchandisers, adopted a new
moniker (e.TV Commerce, a name formerly used by a subsidiary), and
proclaimed its intent to refocus around the opportunities it sees
in GlobalPC.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to hardware sales and Internet access fees,
according to a press release issued last week, those opportunities
include ad sales and e-commerce on the portal site to which
GlobalPC users will be automatically connected.
</P>
<P>
   The company also said it plans to generate revenue by inviting
prominent e-commerce sites, including online banks and book and
music vendors, to pay for ``hot links'' to their sites from special
buttons on the GlobalPC keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   Two factors _ cost and complexity _ are driving the new interest
in alternatives to Windows, industry execs and analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line, of course, is economics. Windows is the one
component of standard PCs that hasn't plummeted in price in recent
years. Hardware manufacturers still fork over an estimated $45 to
$65 (depending on volume and contract terms) to Gates and company
for every Windows-equipped system they ship. Some industry insiders
refer to these Windows license fees as ``the Microsoft tax.''
</P>
<P>
   Linux, by contrast, is free, and while neither Microworkz nor
GlobalPC would disclose what they're paying for the BeOS and GEOS,
the amounts are undoubtedly below what Microsoft charges.
``Obviously, we're being aggressive with our pricing,'' said Lamar
Potts, who joined Be as vice president of Internet appliances in
February.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 3 of DEVICE12 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Over and above differences in license fees, Windows requires more
hardware resources _ faster processors, bigger hard drives, more
disk space _ than more efficient competitors. By switching systems,
proponents of the non-Windows approach say, they'll be able to
deliver more than enough performance for surfing the Web and other
routine home applications with less expensive components.
</P>
<P>
   Companies promoting these Windows-less PCs are hoping that the
lower prices resulting from software-licensing and hardware savings
will help them to reach the 50 to 60 percent of American households
that currently remain computerless, and will also help them open
new markets abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts, however, are skeptical about this argument, given
that full-blown Windows PCs can now be had for less than $500. ``I
question whether there are a lot of incremental users who will buy
at $199 instead of $399 _ especially when they figure out that it's
really $299 versus $499 when you count in the monitor,'' said
Stephen Baker, an analyst at PC Data in Reston, Va.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great that there are people willing to spend their money
on experiments like these,'' Baker said. ``I'm just glad it's not
my money.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Slater, principal analyst at Microdesign Resources in
Sebastopol, took a similarly dim view of the argument that the
lower costs of non-Windows systems will significantly expand the
market, but he said simplicity could be a stronger selling point _
if the alternative PCs really deliver it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their best bet is to deliver non-threatening, highly reliable
systems that really are easier to use than Windows systems,'' he
said. ``It remains to be seen whether they can do that, but if they
can, they could make a dent at the low end.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, even if the alternative PC operating systems
eliminate some of the hassles associated with Windows, they'll
create some new issues of their own. Because widely used
applications such as Microsoft Office won't be available on the
alternative systems, users could have trouble reading files
attached to e-mail messages they receive.
</P>
<P>
   ``And what happens,'' PC Data's Baker asked, ``when your kid
sees KidPix or Reader Rabbit on the neighbor's PC and wants you to
get them a copy?'' (These popular children's programs run only on
Windows and the Mac OS.)
</P>
<P>
   As computing becomes more Internet-centric and more programs are
written in the cross-platform Java language, online services such
as Web calendars are beginning to replace some applications users
previously had to install on their own systems.
</P>
<P>
   But even on the Web, not all operating systems are equally
privileged: Users running ``non-standard'' system software are
likely to find themselves excluded from sites that require
particular browsers or special plug-ins.
</P>
<P>
   Developers of the alternative operating systems are working hard
to solve such problems by writing or commissioning new software to
translate file formats and to fill other gaps in their offerings.
But that's a daunting task, considering that software for Windows
itself continues to advance at a rapid rate.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the combination of low prices and reduced complexity
could be a compelling proposition for some first-time buyers, as
well as for families that already have a PC but now want an extra
Internet-access station.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would buyers come if someone really could deliver a real
improvement in usability and market it effectively at attractive
prices?'' PC Data's Baker asked. ```Absolutely.''

SAN FRANCISCO _ As a teacher at Mission High School in San
Francisco, Jeff Golden was all too familiar with the high drop-out
rates, low grades and student apathy plaguing many urban schools.
<P>
   But Golden, 29, was convinced that if he could just get students
excited about learning, the grades and graduation rates would
improve. He knew that lectures and books weren't enough, so he
tried to remember what it was that piqued his interest when he was
in school.
</P>
<P>
   The answer: traveling the world.
</P>
<P>
   Since he couldn't afford to physically take all his students on
a trip, Golden set up a nonprofit called the Odyssey and created a
Web site to transport students on a virtual journey led by
real-world travelers.
</P>
<P>
   He recruited five twentysomethings to trek to places like Peru,
Guatemala and South Africa, all the while sending dispatches to the
Odyssey's Web site operated out of a building South of Market.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a person who lived abroad, I, along with other teachers,
started thinking about how traveling had given us such different
perspectives,'' said Golden, who launched the site about two years
ago. ``I started thinking about ways to use the Internet to take
students out of the classroom and see the world.''
</P>
<P>
   With the help of other teachers and Web designers, he created an
interactive site that combines reports on the society, culture and
geography of places visited by the Odyssey team with live
interviews of prominent international figures.
</P>
<P>
   The five trekkers are making a two-year worldwide journey to 10
regions in the developing world. After starting in Mexico and South
America, the group now is in Africa and plans to head to the Middle
East, China and India next year. A sixth team member may join the
group if the Odyssey can find the funds.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the group has interviewed people like Mary Burton of
South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission and 1992 Nobel
Peace Prize Laureate Adolfo Perez of Argentina. They've visited
Mayan ruins and a palace in Peru and spoken with a shaman.
</P>
<P>
   They've also been thrown in jail. When they arrived in Cape Town
from Buenos Aires, group members were arrested when they were
unable to show proof that they would be continuing their travels.
After paying about $170 each, they were freed.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of TREK12 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  All the while, they've catalogued their trip on the Web site with
twice-weekly updates from each country.
</P>
<P>
   So far, more than 800 teachers have signed up to use the Odyssey
in their classrooms. The site _ www.worldtrek.org _ gets between
25,000 to 40,000 hits per weekday.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I couldn't do in my classroom was reach a large number of
students,'' Golden said. ``Using the Internet, we can transform the
way a large number of students see the world and their role in it.
I hope to impact more than 1 million students and get them much
more aware of global issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Teachers like Wendy Elman say the site has helped expose her
students to a world outside their immediate environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The site allows the kids to interact with different
environments _ human, natural and political _ beyond San Francisco
in a colorful, creative way,'' said Elman, who teaches fourth grade
at The Hamlin School, a private all-girls school.
</P>
<P>
   She points to a dispatch the team sent back from Nicaragua about
big dolls or gigantones _ giant, 15-foot dolls that make an
appearance in an annual parade.
</P>
<P>
   ``They loved when the team talked about the big dolls,'' Elman
said. ``It was perfect material. They wanted to know how they were
made, how they worked and they were using the word gigantones,
which is Spanish, a language they don't speak.''
</P>
<P>
   The team also answers messages from students and hosts live
chats from different regions.
</P>
<P>
   Golden said he wants to organize another trek in 2001, as long
as he can get funding. The Odyssey started with $15,000 in funding
from the Walter and Elise Haas Fund and ``a lot of maxed-out credit
cards,'' Golden said. The Haas fund is offering another $15,000 if
the Odyssey can match it.
</P>
<P>
   While Golden is paid, most of the Odyssey's employees are
volunteers. The group gets its Internet connection and space free
of charge from Viant Corp. and has some corporate sponsors, such as
Eastman Kodak and Patagonia.

   ORAHOVAC, Yugoslavia _ Several thousand Kosovo Albanians marched
through this little town on Sunday, in the fourth day of peaceful
protests against plans to station Russian troops among the NATO
peacekeepers here.
</P>
<P>
   The Albanians assert that Russian mercenaries fought as members
of the nationalist Serbian militias that carried out a campaign of
killing, looting and burning across the southwest corner of Kosovo
and that the Russians would be overly solicitous of the handful of
remaining Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Russians, they killed a lot of people here,'' said one of
a group of men waiting in the town square for the midday
demonstration to begin, as others nodded agreement.
</P>
<P>
   There have been a number of accounts from refugees of hearing
fighters with the Serbian forces speaking Russian or other foreign
languages during the brutal campaign to drive out Kosovo's Albanian
majority population that began in late March. At one point, the
rebel Kosovo Liberation Army produced a Russian fighter it had
captured.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians are considered sympathetic to the Serbs because of
their common Slavic and Orthodox Christian background. But there is
no reason to believe the Russians will not honor their role as
peacekeepers, and in fact, the agreement with Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic to end NATO's bombing campaign and get Serbian
forces out of Kosovo, allowing the Albanians to return, was reached
with Russian help.
</P>
<P>
   The protests are the latest snag in Russia's effort to insert
itself into the peacekeeping force here, after it was left out in
the initial agreement.
</P>
<P>
   First the Russians startled the NATO powers by rushing several
hundred troops attached to the NATO-led peacekeeping force in
Bosnia to take over the airport outside Pristina, a ``K'' for
Kosovo hastily and clumsily painted over the insignia on their
armored vehicles. An embarrassing standoff ensued, with the NATO
forces deprived of their planned headquarters at the airport site.
</P>
<P>
   An agreement to include the Russians was reached in Helsinki,
Finland, but the arrival of their paratroopers was delayed by U.S.
diplomatic pressure on neighboring countries to deny Russia
permission for flights in their air space.
</P>
<P>
   There were fears that if the Russians were concentrated in one
place, the Serbs might try to partition the northern sector of the
country, with its rich mines and Orthodox monasteries. So the
Russian contingent is to be divided among sectors allotted to other
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, NATO officials have rather stiffly insisted they are
happy to have the Russians.
</P>
<P>
   ``We welcome the Russian participation,'' Maj. Jan Joosten, a
spokesman for the peacekeeping force, said in response to a
question about the demonstrations here. Its soldiers, he said,
``have the duty and responsibility to carry out these tasks in an
evenhanded way toward all ethnic groups.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt that the professional and well-trained
Russian soldiers will act accordingly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But doubts abounded in this battered town among the hills where
Albanian villages have been sacked, burned and destroyed and
hundreds of people apparently killed in massacres by rampaging
Serbian forces this spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``About the Russians, we don't want them here,'' said Ramadan
Pallaqa, an English teacher at the demonstration. ``The ones with
the paramilitary, they were paid money and were not soldiers from
Russia, but it is the same.''
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrations began spontaneously when word reached this
town that Russians would be sent to join Dutch soldiers based here
in part of a larger sector that is run by a German command. The
protests have grown larger and more organized each day, with
demands that NATO and U.N. officials come here and agree not to
send the Russians.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As noon approached, more and more people drifted into the town
square, with a dried-up fountain in the center and a Dutch tank
with an enormous cannon parked to the side. Red and black Albanian
flags appeared, along with a few anti-Russian signs tacked to
sticks.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly the streets were full, and the crowd, which appeared to
number more than 3,000, marched for about a mile, through the
twisted streets of burned shops and a mosque with its minaret shot
up. Then they turned around and marched back, their chants for NATO
whenever they passed a military vehicle as loud as those supporting
the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Back at the square two hours later, the crowd melted quietly
away, many pausing to add their names to a petition against the
Russians at a table set up under a tree.
</P>
<P>
   Relaxed Dutch soldiers _ who wore oddly shaped
blue-and-gold-tasseled caps with their battle dress, making them
look like armed Shriners _ presided benignly over the
demonstration. Although there were no rebel uniforms or arms in
sight, several young men served as parade marshals wearing the
black clothes adopted by rebel Kosovo Liberation Army security
forces, some bearing the emblem ``Versace.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really difficult to have the Russians here because they
will support the Serbs, naturally,'' said Ahmet Dermala, a
mechanical engineer. ``And a lot of local Serbs took part in
assassinations around here. We will continue our protests until we
get a positive answer, and a positive answer is that the Russians
are not coming here.''

NEWS ANALYSIS: MORE QUESTIONS THAN ANSWERS IN A CONGO CEASE-FIRE
PACT
</HEADLINE>
   (rk)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   LUSAKA, Zambia _ While its authors pitched it as a triumph,
Saturday night's signing of a cease-fire deal to end the war in
Congo had something of an air of fiasco about it.
</P>
<P>
   The unexpected occupation of a chair at the conference table by
an ousted rebel leader meant that Congo's two main rebel groups
have not, at least for the moment, signed the accord. Their foreign
backers, and foreign foes _ the outside powers that have made the
war a dangerous regional conflict _ all signed.
</P>
<P>
   Fully signed or not, the deal will still be tested on the
confused jungle-green battlefield in the heart of Africa.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, after the presidents and foreign ministers of a
dozen countries had spent nearly 13 hours in a conference hall
waiting for Zambian President Frederick T.J. Chiluba to announce
the signing ceremony, the upshot was that everyone had endorsed it
by 11 p.m. _ except the rebels who started this latest round of the
war.
</P>
<P>
   Chiluba said the rebels had disagreed with nothing in the
document and would feel morally obliged to abide by it.
</P>
<P>
   But both rebel groups later contradicted him. On Saturday night,
Olivier Kamitatu of the Movement for the Liberation of Congo
quietly said, ``We have not signed, so we are not bound.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday the Congolese Rally for Democracy was blunter. Asked if
it considered the war still on, Bizima Karaha, the group's chief of
security, answered, ``Of course.''
</P>
<P>
   This left the rebels in the dicey position of shunning a
cease-fire that their chief sponsors, Uganda and Rwanda, had
joined. Unless they get covert support, they should run out of
supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Military analysts said that even a fully subscribed cease-fire
document would have proved difficult since crucial issues _
particularly disarming the genocidal Hutu militia loose in eastern
Congo _ were left vague.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, a leadership spat within the Congolese Rally for
Democracy halted the peace process, and the assembled presidents
finally decided that the best course was that no rebels would sign
until Chiluba could fly to eastern Congo and personally decide who
the Rally's real leader is.
</P>
<P>
   No date has been set for that trip, nor could Chiluba say Sunday
how he will make the decision. It was a quick fix since all the
presidents were hurrying to Algiers for the annual summit of the
Organization of African Unity, which opens on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   At a brief press conference Sunday morning, Chiluba declined to
detail what happened behind the scenes between 10 a.m. Saturday,
when 300 diplomats and journalists assembled to watch the
celebratory signing, and 11 p.m., when it was finally signed.
</P>
<P>
   Information filtering out from the back rooms suggested that
three things had gone wrong. Besides the rebel leadership dispute,
officials said that Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe, chief ally
of Congo President Laurent Kabila, objected to the rebels sitting
alongside the presidents, and also wanted the document to name
Burundi as a belligerent. Burundi, which like Uganda and Rwanda has
a Tutsi-dominated government, has never admitted having troops
fighting in Congo.
</P>
<P>
   Chiluba made an oblique reference to that Saturday night, saying
the joint military command envisioned in the cease-fire would
``work closely with Burundi to address its security concerns.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Burundi has suffered spasms of Tutsi-Hutu genocide as Rwanda
has, but not on the scale that Rwanda did in 1994, when 500,000
people were killed in 100 days.
</P>
<P>
   The audience waiting for the cease-fire to be signed had
realized there was a problem with the Rally when its founder,
Ernest Wamba dia Wamba, quietly took the red seat with the Rally's
placard on it.
</P>
<P>
   The professor, who now heads a splinter faction, said he wanted
to be a third signatory on the document, which had only two dotted
lines for rebels. His rivals, Emile Ilunga and Karaha, never
entered the room. On Saturday night, as other combatants signed,
the professor kept flipping the pages of the blank yellow legal pad
left at his place.
</P>
<P>
   The cease-fire document itself, which went through eight drafts
over weeks of negotiations, sets a timetable for events: a
battlefield cease-fire, the creation of a joint military command by
the warring sides, the picking of a ``facilitator'' to lead an
``open national dialogue'' about the future of Congo, the eventual
placing of all territory under the sole control of one government,
the withdrawal of foreign forces and, eventually, free elections.
(Kabila is a self-declared president, having overthrown dictator
Mobutu Sese Seko in 1997. Kabila's allies in that assault, the
rebels and their backers in Rwanda and Uganda, turned on him last
August.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Where hostility had characterized the relationship, let joy
and understanding replace that,'' Chiluba said Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We Africans are not people from a dark continent,'' he added.
``We want peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Kofi Annan, secretary-general of the United Nations, is reported
to favor sending up to 20,000 peacekeepers, mostly drawn from
African countries, to Congo, feeling that the organization must do
at least as much as in the Balkans to keep peace.
</P>
<P>
   Chiluba Sunday morning criticized the United Nations, and
particularly its American and European members, for spending $1.50
per Kosovo refugee but only 11 cents per African refugee. He called
the disparity ``discrimination of the worst kind.''
</P>
<P>
   The cease-fire document calls for a ``neutral facilitator''
distinguished by moral virtue, international credibility and
experience. But it fails to define the powers he or she would have
to prevent, for example, an embarrassing breakdown like Saturday's.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats said no one had been chosen, but several names came up
repeatedly: Zuppi Matteo, an Italian priest who helped run peace
talks for Mozambique; Salim Ahmed Salim of the Organization of
African Unity, and the recent former presidents of South Africa,
Botswana and Benin.
</P>
<P>
   But the most obvious sticking point is the disarming of the Hutu
militia. They were not represented at the talks, and have
everything to lose. Although the cease-fire recognizes the
possibility of amnesty, those suspected of genocide could be
deported to Rwanda, tried and executed.
</P>
<P>
   The cease-fire document is also vague about who must take the
risk of enforcing peace by disarming the various warring parties.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear that U.N. peacekeepers would be willing to take
heavy casualties to disarm any of the factions. The United Nations
pulled back its forces in Rwanda just before the genocide, while in
Angola it spent three years, at $1 million a day, collecting the
Unita rebels at camps and disarming them. Playing for time, Unita
turned in old men and boys with broken weapons. Now, rearmed with
heavy Ukrainian weapons it bought with diamond money, it is back at
war.
</P>
<P>
   In Congo, both sides' troops are scattered over a country 215
times the size of Kosovo, and often divided by ethnic group loyalty
or personal loyalty to a commander. The rebel groups are supposed
to hold the territory they have captured, disarm Hutu or Unita
fighters they meet and then merge their armies.
</P>
<P>
   Chiluba said he is optimistic. ``I have convinced myself that we
in the region have the political will'' to make peace a reality, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Jean-Pierre Bemba, the leader of the Movement for the
Liberation of Congo, did not attend the signing at all because he
was still consolidating his capture of Gbadolite, Mobutu's
birthplace, which is full of decaying palaces.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALAN TRUEX  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
When the taxi pulled up to Fenway Park and the driver said, ``This
is it,'' the passenger was surprised. And a bit disappointed.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Roger Clemens, the then-21-year-old pitcher who had grown up in
Houston, had just been called up to the Boston Red Sox, and he
asked, ``This is Fenway Park?''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the site of Tuesday night's All-Star Game is
unimpressive at first glance. Fenway Park is a squatty, red-brick
wedge jammed into a commercialized urban neighborhood. It has dim
lighting, virtually no parking lot and no soaring facade like
Yankee Stadium or graceful contours like Wrigley Field.
</P>
<P>
   But when you enter the arched doorways, you are in a magical
place _ ``a lyric little bandbox of a ballpark,'' New Englander
John Updike best described it.
</P>
<P>
   Not that everyone sees it that way. To the objective visitor
from out of town, this may seem like a dark, decaying dungeon of a
ballpark. There are too few restrooms and little leg room. The
aisles are so narrow that no vendors traverse them.
</P>
<P>
   Many sight lines are blocked by posts. And at night the lighting
is so weak in some places that you can't read a scorecard.
</P>
<P>
   But what genuine baseball fan can be objective about Fenway
Park?
</P>
<P>
   History breathes in the dust and mold of its rafters. Babe Ruth
not only hit but pitched here. Smoky Joe Wood outdueled Walter
Johnson. Tris Speaker roamed the lush bluegrass of center field.
Ted Williams played his last game here, homering in his final
at-bat. Clemens set a strikeout record here.
</P>
<P>
   The fabled wall known as the Green Monster _ far more dominating
than it appears on television _ still rules over left field,
dispensing its wicked brand of justice.
</P>
<P>
   From an infield roof seat you can scan Boston's skyline _ as
spectacularly jagged as Fenway's outfield. What greater privilege
is there than to be one of the 33,925 who can sit in these tight,
hallowed quarters?
</P>
<P>
   Creature discomforts aside, many observers believe the essence
of baseball, a sport like golf and tennis that defies the
constraints of time, is never more gloriously presented than at
Fenway Park, which opened in 1912.
</P>
<P>
   A former Boston All-Star catcher, Carlton Fisk, summarized the
park's magnetism: ``If you want to see everything baseball can
provide, Fenway is the place to see it.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the nation's coziest, craziest baseball arena, though not
exactly by design. It was cobbled together, in stages, in a
confining area, with its shape contrived to fit the jumbled layout
of city streets.
</P>
<P>
   The Green Monster was an afterthought _ not added until 1934,
when the stadium was expanded from its original seating capacity of
27,642.
</P>
<P>
   Because of long-standing buildings adjacent to the ballpark,
there wasn't room for a properly sized left field. Some sort of
barrier was needed to maintain a semblance of balance between
offense and defense.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, a 10-foot-high embankment stretched from the
left-field foul line to the flagpole in center. It became known as
Duffy's Cliff, after Red Sox left fielder Duffy Lewis, who scaled
the terrain to retrieve rocketing drives.
</P>
<P>
   But to less adroit outfielders, the hill was so hazardous that
alternative landscaping was recommended. So the mound was leveled
and the Green Monster created: an 18-foot-high base of concrete
topped by 19 feet of tin stretched across railroad ties _ 310 feet
from home plate.
</P>
<P>
   Although it was designed to frustrate hitters, the Monster
quickly became their best friend. Since 1934, Fenway has seen 13
percent more runs scored than has the average big-league venue.
</P>
<P>
   By 1936, so many fly balls were plunking windows on Lansdowne
Street that a 23-foot net was erected above the left-field tin to
catch the home runs.
</P>
<P>
   At Fenway, a lazy fly ball is often lifted by wind over the
wall. A home run of that dubious nature _ by New York Yankees
shortstop Bucky Dent _ cost the Red Sox a divisional championship
in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   The Green Monster also spawns fluke doubles and triples (flyouts
everywhere else), though it sometimes reduces legitimate line-drive
doubles to singles. Baseballs bounce weirdly all along the
multi-angled outfield fence, causing purists to debate whether
Fenway is good or evil for the game.
</P>
<P>
   This fence zigzags (no Wrigley curving here) and drops off,
step-like, from left field to right _ from 37 feet tall to 17 feet,
then to five and 3.25. The manually operated scoreboard at the base
of the Green Monster causes still more unusual ricochets. Opposing
outfielders usually reserve an extra 20 minutes of pre-game
practice to study the myriad caroms.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, the most famous inhabitant of Fenway's left field,
said, ``If the ball hit the tin, it dropped straight down; if it
hit the cement, it would bounce back hard; if it hit a bolt,
anything could happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Quirks and quaintness aside, what makes Fenway so lovable in its
enduring obsolescence is the way it reaches out to the fans.
</P>
<P>
   The foul area is the smallest in the majors, which means a box
seat along the first-base or third-base line puts you nearer the
action than any other ticket in any other stadium. Some seats at
Fenway are closer to the field than the dugouts are.
</P>
<P>
   One cherished section is the bleachers, where patrons know to
beware of beach balls and other flying objects. Opposing pitchers
warm up in front of the right-field fans and are frequent targets
of paper cups and airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   The favored bleacher seat is the red one in row 33, which was
struck by the longest home run ever to right field _ a 502-foot
blast by Williams.
</P>
<P>
   But a typical right-field home run in Fenway is a short one. At
302 feet, the right foul pole _ ``Pesky's Pole'' _ is even closer
to home plate than the one in left.
</P>
<P>
   Fenway's intimacy is a product of the ``dead ball'' era in which
this park was built. Back in the days when the baseball didn't
travel as far off the bat, this was a more compact game.
</P>
<P>
   When it opened, Fenway was one of the largest of ballparks.
Ebbets Field would debut a year later in Brooklyn with a capacity
of 18,000.
</P>
<P>
   Fenway's dimensions were comparable to those of its contemporary
stadiums. In fact, its center field _ originally 488 feet (later
shortened to 420) _ was one of the deepest.
</P>
<P>
   And its foul lines were longer than many. The Polo Grounds of
New York had a left-field distance of 277, while right was 257.
Even so, few fly balls made it that far before the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   Besides its fascinating physical attributes, Fenway appeals for
the passion that is associated with it. It harks back to a time
when baseball owners were devoted to winning games rather than to
earning maximum revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Yawkey, owner of the Red Sox for 44 years until his death in
1976, was a sportsman whose love for baseball often transcended his
pursuit of money. Red Sox fans fondly recall the late 1960s, when
seats in the triangular Section 34 in center field were withheld
from sale to provide a dark background for prolific young slugger
Tony Conigliaro.
</P>
<P>
   But this is a different time, and the current owners of the Red
Sox want to dismantle Fenway Park. They say its miniature size and
paucity of luxury suites render it ``not economically feasible.''
</P>
<P>
   Red Sox chief executive officer John Harrington insists a new
stadium is necessary ``to continue fielding a competitive team.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrington recently presented plans for a $545 million ``New
Fenway'' patterned after the old but with seating for 44,140. He
said the new stadium, which he hopes will open in 2003, will
provide ``unobstructed views, wider seats, easier access and egress
and a decent number of restrooms for women and families. We're more
enlightened now than we were in 1912 in that regard.''
</P>
<P>
   But tears glinted in his eyes, and his voice cracked as
Harrington acknowledged ``very strong mixed emotions. Fenway is
special. I used to come here with my father, and I know what the
Red Sox can mean to the people of New England. And I know Fenway is
part of that.''
</P>
<P>
   For however long Fenway remains in existence, none can dispute
that it offers a unique baseball experience. Even the food
concessions are special, though you usually must stand in a lengthy
line to purchase the famous Legal Seafood clam chowder.
</P>
<P>
   While New York's Yankee Stadium is more majestic and Chicago's
Wrigley Field is better preserved, Fenway, tied with Tiger Stadium
as the oldest major-league park still in operation, may be the most
fun of baseball's shrines.
</P>
<P>
   Gushed veteran baseball writer and columnist Joe Falls of the
Detroit News: ``If I could have my choice of where I could die, it
would be in the press box at Fenway Park on a fresh afternoon in
June.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a month past the ideal time. But to many ardent baseball
fans, there's never a better place to die or live than Fenway Park
_ all the more precious with its own long life being threatened.

INDIA AND PAKISTAN ANNOUNCE WITHDRAWAL OF FIGHTERS IN KASHMIR 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By BARRY BEARAK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan _ India and Pakistan said Sunday that rival
forces battling for the last two months over the icy ridges and
mountain tops of the Indian state of Kashmir would begin a phased
withdrawal, heralding an end to the latest confrontation between
the world's newest nuclear powers.
</P>
<P>
   The two nations, which have fought two wars over Kashmir since
winning independence from Britain in 1947, were very cautious with
their statements Sunday, carefully portraying any silencing of the
guns in terms of victory for their sides.
</P>
<P>
   The recent conflict has been depicted so differently in each
country that the citizens of one would barely recognize the war
that their counterparts have been following in the news.
</P>
<P>
   While the Pakistanis were terming the development something of a
gradual cease-fire between warring parties, the Indians explained
things more as the recognition of a fait accompli: Most of the
invaders into its territory had already been killed or thrown out.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, if the calm in the mountains holds _ and the
step-by-step process is continued _ it would bring to an end the
most serious tension between India and Pakistan in 30 years and to
the first major confrontation since the nations tested nuclear
weapons in May 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In a hastily called news conference Sunday night, Pakistan's
foreign minister, Sartaj Aziz, said that a ``disengagement'' was
underway from the fierce fighting, some of it hand-to-hand, that
has taken place in the strategic heights above a vital Indian
supply route.
</P>
<P>
   ``The director-generals of military operations of the two
nations met today and agreed on the modalities of de-escalation,
including sector-wise cessation of ground and air operations,''
Aziz said. ``We have been informed that disengagement in the Kaksar
sector, which began yesterday, has been proceeding satisfactorily.
The disengagement for the Mushkoh sector will begin tonight.
Gradually, the disengagement will be completed in the entire
area.''
</P>
<P>
   The move toward peace comes exactly a week after Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan made a sudden trip to Washington and
promised President Clinton that he would take ``concrete steps'' to
end the crisis. He returned with a promise that the president would
take a ``personal interest'' in solving the 52-year-old dispute
over Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   Although statements from both sides in recent days had hinted at
a shift away from diplomatic stalemate, neither India nor Pakistan
gave any account of what exactly had led to Sunday's meeting of
their senior military chiefs, and the plans for phased withdrawal.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   India's leaders have insisted that the militant Muslim invaders
in Kashmir were thick with Pakistani army regulars, and that the
infiltration was a long-planned Pakistani military operation. For
the Indians, then, what is taking place now is an anti-climactic
withdrawal of defeated remnants. They had already declared that 95
percent of the intruders had been driven out.
</P>
<P>
   There is ``some evidence of withdrawal,'' Brajesh Mishra,
India's national security advisor, said Sunday in New Delhi after a
meeting of the leaders of political parties was convened by Prime
Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is our hope that in seven days, the status quo of the LOC
will be restored if it goes according to plan,'' he said, referring
to the 450-mile Line of Control that divides the Indian and
Pakistani-controlled parts of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1947, when India and Pakistan were carved from the British
Empire, dominion over the storied Himalayan area of Kashmir has
been in dispute, and was the direct cause for two of the three wars
between the two nations.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the Indian Maj. Gen. J.J. Singh said, ``A decisive
moment has now arrived for army operations to finish,'' adding
stiffly that the military will not halt its offensive until every
invader has been driven from the mountains.
</P>
<P>
   The matter of whether retreating soldiers would be allowed
``safe passage'' has been a contentious issue in India since the
tide began going its way on the battlefield.
</P>
<P>
   Mishra was not so tough-talking. When asked if the Indian army
was slowing its attack, he said, ``The Indian army has no tradition
of shooting at the backs of people.''
</P>
<P>
   In Islamabad, the attempt is to paint the latest turn as a
diplomatic achievement for Sharif and a military victory for the
Kashmiri mujahedeen, the Muslim guerrillas who the government says
have challenged the Indians with only moral support from Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past few weeks, the mujahedeen action has been
gloriously successful as the just and legitimate cause of Kashmir
has engaged the international community's undivided attention
throughout the period,'' Aziz said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the focus must now ``shift to the expeditious solution
of the Kashmir dispute, so that 1 billion people who inhabit South
Asia can lead a life of peace and engage in the endeavors for
economic development and presperity.''
</P>
<P>
   Brig. Rashid Qureshi, Pakistan's top military spokesman, sat
beside Aziz at the news conference and boasted repeatedly of how
the mujahedeen had gotten the best of the Indian army.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians ``have been talking about spectacular victories
without having lost any casualties,'' he said. ``That has been done
to uplift their sagging morale because they have suffered
tremendous casualties.''
</P>
<P>
   But such consistent praise for the mujahedeen's battlefield
successes has created a problem for Sharif, whose trip to the
United States was seen by many here as a ``sell out'' of the
freedom fighters who, from most Pakistani accounts, have been
heroically prevailing in a holy war.
</P>
<P>
   In denying that any of the invaders are Pakistani soldiers _
something that many Western observers have openly called
disingenuous _ the prime minister is now left to answer this
troubling question: Who is it that is ``disengaging'' from the
mountains, since the mujahedeen have in that last few days
proclaimed that they will hold out till their last breath?
</P>
<P>
   Such stirring defiance was reaffirmed earlier Sunday by the
United Jihad Council, an umbrella group of Kashmiri mujahedeen
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   After Aziz's news conference, however, the council made no
immediate comment.
</P>
<P>
   Sharif is scheduled to address the nation Monday night, when he
is likely to reiterate earlier assertions that he in fact does have
the mujahedeen's support for a strategic withdrawal _ and that he
has convinced them that they have little more to gain from
remaining in their bunkers in the wind-swept mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Qureshi said Sunday night that he had no information about where
the mujahedeen would now go, but he said he was sure they would be
able to disperse without the Indians doing them harm and move on to
continue their holy war elsewhere in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   ``One must understand that the mujahedeen are fully capable of
taking care of themselves,'' he said.

 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When the Senate takes up legislation to define
patients' rights on Monday, Democrats will argue that hundreds of
people have been injured or even died because they were denied
necessary care by cost-conscious health maintenance organizations.
</P>
<P>
   So it is rather surprising to find that the chief lobbyist for
the managed care industry is herself a Democrat, a veteran of the
trade union movement and a longtime advocate of universal health
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   The lobbyist, Karen Ignagni, has deflected much of the anger
that threatened to overwhelm HMOs just a year ago. She will lead
the industry into battle this week, as the Senate holds four days
of impassioned debate on proposals to set comprehensive federal
standards for health insurance plans.
</P>
<P>
   It will be the most extensive debate on any health care issue
since President Clinton's plan for universal health insurance died
on the Senate floor in the summer of 1994.
</P>
<P>
   As president of the American Association of Health Plans, Ms.
Ignagni leads a nimble, quick-witted campaign to outmaneuver the
Clinton administration and Democrats in Congress who want to enact
a ``patients' bill of rights,'' enforceable by lawsuits against
health plans that injure patients by denying them care.
</P>
<P>
   In a city teeming with health care lobbyists, Ms. Ignagni is
widely considered one of the most effective. She blends a detailed
knowledge of health policy with an intuitive feel for politics.
</P>
<P>
   Since taking charge of the association nearly six years ago, she
has built up a large stable of health policy analysts and has
retained pollsters and political consultants from both parties to
repair the tattered image of HMOs. She has persuaded members of the
association to adopt a voluntary code of conduct, which they use to
argue that new laws are unneeded.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ignagni (pronounced ig-NAH-nee) puts a humane face on an
industry reviled by many consumers. Old friends say they are
puzzled by the transition she has made from champion of the working
class to defender of big business. She now denounces proposals by
Democratic members of Congress who were her allies for more than a
decade, when she worked at the AFL-CIO.
</P>
<P>
   One Democrat on Capitol Hill said, ``Karen went from God's right
hand to Satan's left hand.'' A labor union leader said, ``She
jumped to the other side.'' Former allies on the left say she has
sold out, abandoned principles, become a turncoat.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has become part of the enemy, as far as I'm concerned,''
said Sidney Wolfe, director of Ralph Nader's Health Research Group.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Greg Ganske, R-Iowa, who supports many of Clinton's
proposals to regulate HMOs, said: ``Karen has one of the more
difficult jobs in Washington, defending an industry that has a
public relations record similar to that of the tobacco industry. In
private conversations, I sense that she is uncomfortable defending
the totally irresponsible behavior of some HMOs.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ignagni sees no contradiction. Even as she works to head off
legislation defining patients' rights, she insists that she is
motivated by concern for low-income workers. Proposed new federal
standards and requirements, she says, would increase the cost of
health insurance and make it unaffordable for many workers and
small employers.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ignagni's adversaries express grudging respect for her. ``I
just wish she were on our side,'' said Gail Shearer, a health
policy expert at Consumers Union. David Nexon, the senior health
policy adviser to Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., said, ``Karen has
revitalized an organization that was somewhat moribund and made it
a real player on the Washington scene.''
</P>
<P>
   Lobbyists for the association have penetrated the innermost
chambers of the Health Care Financing Administration, the unit of
the Department of Health and Human Services that runs Medicare. The
lobbyists often seem to know more about what is happening at the
agency than do senior officials of the department.
</P>
<P>
   The association and its business allies have flooded the
airwaves and newspapers with advertisements opposing legislation to
regulate HMOs. Through an umbrella group known as the Health
Benefits Coalition, they spent $2 million on advertising last year
and have already spent more than that this year, with a new burst
of advertising planned for this week.
</P>
<P>
   The advertisements attack the main Democratic bill by name, but
provide justification _ and political cover _ for senators to vote
against any patients' rights legislation.
</P>
<P>
   At 45, Ms. Ignagni is younger, more informal and more direct
than most lobbyists who run big trade associations. Her talk is
breezy, but it serves a purpose, frequently disarming her
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Most HMOs are operated by profit-making companies like Aetna,
Cigna and Pacificare, but Ms. Ignagni rarely talks about their
profits or losses. She prefers to talk about the quality of health
care, the concerns of consumers, the work that HMOs are doing to
detect breast cancer and treat asthma.
</P>
<P>
   As consumer groups, labor unions and doctors press Congress for
legislation to define patients' rights, the position of the
managed-care industry has been continually evolving.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago Ms. Ignagni said her members saw no need for
legislation. Now, she said, they strenuously oppose the main
Democratic bill and have not endorsed the Republican bill, although
they see it as ``less undesirable.''
</P>
<P>
   Explaining why she was now willing to consider legislation, Ms.
Ignagni said, ``If we want to influence the discussion in Congress,
we can't oppose everything.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Provisions of the Republican bill allowing patients to appeal
the denial of care are ``a good starting point for bipartisan
discussion,'' she said. But, she added, ``We dislike provisions of
the Republican bill that micromanage our activities and dictate the
design of health plans.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ignagni's presence is a reminder of the history of HMOs.
They have their roots in labor union health plans and in the
idealism of the health cooperatives that were formed in the 1940s
and '50s to obtain better health care at the lowest possible cost.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the United Automobile Workers, the United Mine
Workers and other labor unions had seats on the board of the Group
Health Association of America, established in 1959. In 1996, the
organization changed its name to the American Association of Health
Plans.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ignagni has combined policy and politics throughout her
career. After graduating from Providence College in Rhode Island in
1975, she worked as a research analyst at the Social Security
Administration, analyzing data on health spending.
</P>
<P>
   She moved to the Committee for National Health Insurance, formed
by Walter Reuther of the autoworkers' union, and then worked for
Senate Democrats before taking a job at the AFL-CIO, where she held
senior staff positions from 1982 to 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ignagni did not seek her current job; she was recruited by
an executive search firm. She received a salary of $300,000 last
year, plus a $100,000 bonus for her performance.
</P>
<P>
   When the House passed a Republican bill to regulate HMOs last
summer, Ms. Ignagni complained that ``the debate has been defined
by politicians, pollsters and Hollywood producers.'' But she
herself has used the techniques of a political campaign in trying
to fend off government regulation of managed care.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the association says it has developed a database
with the names of millions of patients, HMO employees and allies
who can be dispatched at a moment's notice to answer critics of
managed care. The group boasts that it ``helped generate thousands
of letters to the editor'' last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've made a real effort to take our message, our campaign, to
voters, physicians, Medicare beneficiaries and opinion leaders
around the country,'' Ms. Ignagni said.
</P>
<P>
   The association is running advertisements in Iowa and New
Hampshire to persuade presidential candidates that they cannot win
many votes by ``bashing HMOs.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ignagni hired an economic consulting firm, the Barents
Group, a unit of KPMG, to estimate the local costs of federal
mandates, and she has publicized the results in news conferences
around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Even as federal auditors contend that HMOs are overpaid by the
Medicare program, Ms. Ignagni is asking Congress to increase those
payments. She commissioned a study by the accounting firm
PricewaterhouseCoopers to support her case. And she has recruited
elderly people as lobbyists, urging Congress to increase
reimbursement so health plans will not drop out of Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   In all of this, Ms. Ignagni seems untroubled by the apparent
contradictions between her old and new roles. ``I've never had a
sense that I was advocating something I didn't believe in,'' she
said.

AS FUNNY AS A CRUTCH
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ What's it take to get a dislocated sense of
humanity? A hyperextended ego? Blinded by the spotlight of athletic
fame?
</P>
<P>
   Ask the football players at UCLA, where when you limp the whole
team limps with you.
</P>
<P>
   Who hasn't been hacked off trying to find a parking spot in
Westwood _ once, it even happened when we were going to the Special
Olympics at Drake Stadium. But there was no consideration, not one
thought, of stooping to pull in between the UCLA powder-blue lines
on the street.
</P>
<P>
   Our mamas only had to say it once: It just ain't right.
</P>
<P>
   The 14 football players who allegedly wrangled illegal
handicapped-parking placards exposed not so much an abhorrent abuse
of the system but that the system can be so abhorrently abused. It
also shows what a desperate college kid might do to save a few
hundred bucks in university parking fees.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the punishment that'll fit this crime is easy. After
a state judge is done with them, game suspensions by coach Bob
Toledo won't do. You can get suspended for hundreds of things in
college these days, sad to say.
</P>
<P>
   Unless someone finds real malice here instead of inconsiderate
stupidity, we endorse a bajillion hours of community service. Start
across the street at the VA Hospital, helping someone attach his
prosthetic legs and then drive him to the market.
</P>
<P>
   Where then you can park in the handicapped spot all day if you
want.
</P>
<P>
   _Oh, and by the way, if it's possible, the guys would hope that
in the future you refer to them as ``morally challenged.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   _The Stanford band called an emergency session to plan for the
halftime show of the Cardinal's home game Sept. 25 against UCLA....
</P>
<P>
   _A Monistat Moment: What we enjoy calling chick kickball,
Women's World Cupper Julie Foudy calls ``booters with hooters.''
Which is no endorsement of the restaurant/bar chain with
tight-shirted waitresses to be a title sponsor for a women's pro
league....
</P>
<P>
   _Who wouldn't want their daughter to grow up and be like Mia ?
Either Hamm or St. John....
</P>
<P>
   _The question isn't how much the Dodgers had to bribe Gary
Sheffield this year so he'd represent the team at the All-Star
Game. It's how much they had to bribe baseball to have someone
represent them at all....
</P>
<P>
   _Don't care what the roster limitations are, Roger Clemens , Mo
Vaughn and Wade Boggs should have been must-invites for an All-Star
Game in Fenway. Even ahead of Juan Gonzalez....
</P>
<P>
   _Bring back two All-Star Games per year, one for the fans' picks
at midseason and one later for the really deserving players....
</P>
<P>
   _Former Giants catcher Bob Brenly , named to the '84 NL All-Star
team, remembers before that game when Tom Lasorda , who was going
to coach third base, got up on a picnic table in the middle of the
clubhouse and shouted, ``Hey, everybody, let's go over the signs.''
Then San Diego Padres reliever Goose Goosage yelled back: ``Sit
down, Tommy. Everybody in the league already knows your signs.''
...
</P>
<P>
   _Just in case you were wondering: With 191 dingers, Eric Karros
has more home runs than any active player who has not ever made an
All-Star team....
</P>
<P>
   _Also, just in case you were wondering: Hack Wilson 's record
RBI count from 1930 is stuck on 191 this week....
</P>
<P>
   _Paul Konerko charged into the All-Star break on a 13-for-23
streak (.579)....
</P>
<P>
   _The Warriors have given former NoHo and Stanford guard Arthur
Lee a chance to play for their summer-league team in Long Beach....
</P>
<P>
   _Lakers players angling for a starring role in PhilJax's
triangle offense best hope that Scottie Pippen agrees to come over
and show 'em how it's done. See ya, Glenn Rice . Nice play, Robert
Horry . But we got a championship to win....
</P>
<P>
   _Jackson said that ``unless it's absolutely necessary for us to
fill a position that this team has a weakness in, Dennis Rodman
will not be our first choice.''
</P>
<P>
   That does, unfortunately, leave the door open for him to be a
very high runner-up choice.

THIS WEEK'S TV HIGHLIGHTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
TODAY: Mike Piazza isn't afraid of big green monsters. It's all
about taking hacks off a BP thrower and messing his swing up by
trying to hit the ball over three state lines. That's why he has
again shied away from participating in the annual home run derby
and will join ESPN's coverage team instead. With a bat or a mike,
he's gonna embarrass himself. Home Run Derby from Boston's Fenway
Park, ESPN, 5 p.m.  
TUESDAY: Fox's All-Star Game producer Michael Weisman justifies
this year's increases in staff (three broadcasters in the booth and
three reporters in the stands) and equipment (20 cameras, 15 replay
machines and 60 microphones positioned around the field). ``This
will be one of the greatest assemblages of baseball talents at one
time in the history of the All-Star Game,'' Weisman said. ``There
will never be a moment like this again. Think about it. There will
be 50 of the greatest legends walking to home plate from center
field. Then there will be the current All-Stars. They will be
followed by Ted Williams, coming in a golf cart from center field,
throwing out the first pitch to none other than Carlton Fisk. We're
talking goose bumps here. It will be the field of dreams.'' Oh, and
then the game starts. Major League Baseball All-Star Game from
Boston's Fenway Park, Channel 11, 5 p.m.  
WEDNESDAY: A little presumptuous, don't you think? WNBA All-Star
Game from New York's Madison Square Garden, ESPN, 4:30 p.m.  
THURSDAY: By pitting them against each other, baseball has managed
to prevent both the Dodgers and Angels from getting off to rousing
starts in the second half of the season. Dodgers at Angels, Fox
Sports West, 7 p.m. (KTLA Channel 5 has Friday's game at 7 p.m. and
Fox Channel 11 has Saturday's game at 1:05 p.m.)  
FRIDAY: The Davis Cup began 99 years ago at the Longwood Cricket
Club in Brookline, Mass., and that's where Pete Sampras comes back
to help the U.S. team take on Australia in 1999. Davis Cup: U.S.
vs. Australia, ESPN, 11 a.m. and ESPN2, 1 p.m.  
SATURDAY: The first rule for a city hosting a league's all-star
game should be to have a team that plays in that league. Which is
why soccer makes no sense. Major Soccer League All-Star Game from
San Diego, Channel 7, 12:30 p.m. (ESPN2 has the MSL Skills
Competition, Friday at 9 p.m.)  
SUNDAY: Sixteen years ago, Tom Watson defended his British Open
title. It hasn't happened since. That turned out to be Watson's
last major championship, by the way. Mark O'Meara (pictured) isn't
likely to make a successful defense _ or win another major, either.
The 42-year-old has been too busy flying around the world and
cashing in on his unbelievable '98 season, when he also won the
Masters. In majors this year, O'Meara was 31st at the Masters and
missed the cut at the U.S. Open. British Open final round, Channel
7, 8 a.m. (ABC has third-round coverage Saturday at 8 a.m.; ESPN
has first- and second-round coverage Thursday and Friday at 6 a.m.)

WHY DEAL WITH MEDIA WHEN YOU HAVE YOUR SITE SET?

   LOS ANGELES _ On the sports-talk radio shows in Atlanta last
week, Falcons running back Jamaal Anderson took a beating.
</P>
<P>
   He skipped the team's three-day mini camp, holding out as he
tries to get a new contract. His agent, Jim Sims, and Falcons coach
and executive vice president Dan Reeves have been explaining their
sides to the media. Reeves issued a deadline of July 28, the
opening of training camp.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's response? Instead of answering back or talking to the
media, the former North Hollywood High star has stayed home in Salt
Lake City and did his talking on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   He has read the e-mail and message boards from fans who use his
Web site at Athlete's Direct. And he has directly responded to
those who think he's demanding too much of a signing bonus and
acting selfishly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is Jamaal selfish? No,'' Anderson wrote, proving he can not
only talk in the third person but write in it as well. ``If I was,
believe me, I would have been using the Super Bowl or the NFC
championship as a stage to air my contract concerns. What better
place to get people to listen?
</P>
<P>
   ``Folks, the point is I did not create a market for running
backs. I just know I belong with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson wrote that the only signing bonus he has ever received
was $23,000 as a seventh-round pick in 1993. He's trying to get a
$10 million signing bonus this time after leading the NFC with
1,846 yards rushing and 14 touchdowns last year.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson also defended his absence from training camp by saying
he expected to have a new contract.
</P>
<P>
   Agree? The e-mail box is always open.
</P>
<P>
   _If Fox doesn't have enough gadgetry for Tuesday's Major League
Baseball All-Star Game, there will be access to a ``Diamond Cam,''
a live telerobotic camera located behind home plate on baseball's
official Web site ( www.majorleaguebaseball.com ).
</P>
<P>
   _The Angels upgraded their Web site ( www.angelsbaseball.com )
with new technology by Pixelon.com that improves game highlight
video to full-screen TV-like production. It's the first time a
major sports team has offered this technology on their site.

DESPITE POLICE DISMISSALS, IRAN PROTEST CONTINUES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DOUGLAS JEHL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt _ In a new sign of militancy, at least 15,000
students took to the streets of Tehran, Iran, on Sunday in what has
become a protest against a divided government whose security forces
remain in conservative hands.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said it was the angriest protest since the Iranian
revolution of two decades ago, and it presented the most formidable
test yet of President Mohammad Khatami, the moderate leader who
holds broad popular support but has yet to consolidate control over
a fractured political structure.
</P>
<P>
   At its surface, the demonstration was merely the outgrowth of
several days of anger over the storming on Thursday night of a
university dormitory by security forces and conservative
vigilantes. But it also reflected a deep discontent over the fact
that Khatami's popularly elected government remains, in large part,
in others' hands.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters aborted an early plan to march to the city
center. But after three days of mounting anger, they left no doubt
they were dissatisfied with an announcement by Khatami's government
that it would dismiss the officers who had ordered the raid, Iran's
police chief, Brig. Gen. Hedayat Lotfian, and his deputy, who was
not named.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not going to be satisfied until people at the top
resign,'' one student leader said. ``Khatami has to do something or
resign.''
</P>
<P>
   The protesters said students had been killed by the police and
the vigilantes during the demonstrations, and had demanded the
dismissal of Lotfian, who reports not to Khatami but to Ayatollah
Ali Khamenei, the cleric who is Iran's supreme leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either Islam and the law, or another revolution,'' the
marchers chanted Sunday, in a reference to the 1979 revolution that
toppled the shah, Mohammed Riza Pahlevi.
</P>
<P>
   More than half of Iran's population was born after the
revolution, and young people were a powerful force in the 1997
election that swept Khatami to power. But many of them, and many
other Iranians, have become frustrated by the fact that
conservatives, the main power-holders since the revolution, remain
in positions of authority and control.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami does not control the police or the military, and his
efforts to promote a freer press have repeatedly been thwarted by
the conservative-dominated judiciary, which has punished newspapers
that have pushed the limits of freedom.
</P>
<P>
   It was just such a punishment, of the newspaper Salam, that
sparked the latest protest.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper had published information that called attention to
the role of the conservative-led Intelligence Ministry in the
killings last winter of a number of Iranian intellectuals. The
newspaper was ordered closed because the information was said to be
classified.
</P>
<P>
   Even Ayatollah Khamenei, usually above public reproach, was
criticized by the students for failing to protect them.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Iran's biggest moderate student movement, which
claims 50,000 members, said the attacks on students by the police
and vigilantes of the Ansar-e Hezbollah group could not have been
made without high-level support.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ansar commits crimes, and the leader supports them,'' some
demonstrators shouted in the march in Tehran. ``Oh, great leader,
shame on you.''
</P>
<P>
   Khamenei has not commented on the unrest but a body of his
representatives on campuses condemned the attack in a statement,
saying that it had ``hurt the heart of the exalted leader.''
</P>
<P>
   In a clear effort to put a lid on the discontent, Iran's top
security body said Sunday that it had dismissed two senior police
officers held responsible for the Thursday night crackdown. A
statement read on state television said that the Supreme National
Security Council, which reports to Khatami, had ordered Lotfian and
his aide to be dismissed and prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   The statement also said that Tehran's police chief had been
reprimanded for his handling of operations late Thursday at the
dormitory. But it sought to minimize the extent of the violence,
saying that only one man had been killed during the unrest and
denying all ``rumors and unofficial reports'' about further deaths.
Student groups have said several students were killed.
</P>
<P>
   The statement said the Intelligence Ministry had arrested seven
Islamic vigilantes for taking part in the attacks. It said the
ministry was continuing its investigation of the group, and added
that all 200 students arrested after the attacks had been released.
</P>
<P>
   But the council also warned students against holding any further
demonstrations, saying authorities would prevent unauthorized
assemblies and marches.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The vigilantes, who are backed by conservative political
leaders, have remained a major source of instability and fear in
Iran. Last winter, they murdered a number of intellectuals, and
they attacked a bus carrying visiting Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats in Iran have said that the discontent of students
represents a major threat to Iran's political stability.
</P>
<P>
   Although the student demonstrators decided Sunday not to take
what would have been the provocative step of marching on downtown
Tehran, there were reports from around the country that other
students held sympathy marches, and at least two liberal newspapers
said that they would suspend publication, beginning Tuesday, in
support of the students and the shuttered newspaper, Salam.

 &HT;    Smoltz to give elbow first test in AA game
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ John Smoltz is planning to test his inflamed elbow
Thursday in Jacksonville by pitching an inning for the Class AA
Greenville Braves. It will be the first time he's pitched in 10
days since going back on the disabled list for the second time this
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just to get back in it and see how my elbow is,'' Smoltz
said. ``I can't find that out in a side session. ... I can throw in
a side session and not feel any pain. When I fire up in a game,
that's different. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``What Jacksonville is going to be is a steppingstone to say
`proceed' or `retreat.'''
</P>
<P>
   If it's to retreat, Smoltz will shut the elbow back down for an
undetermined amount of time. If it's to proceed, he plans to pitch
another couple innings with Greenville, rejoin the Atlanta Braves
in Florida on July 21 and 22 and work his way back into the
rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, his main goal is to be ready at the end of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to pitch three or four games for the sake of
pitching,'' Smoltz said. ``Obviously, I'd like to contribute, but
at the same time the contributions I want to make are at the end of
the year.''
</P>
<P>
   Bombs away
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Klesko came up with two more home runs Sunday to bring his
season total to 13, which is fourth on the team behind Chipper
Jones (21), Brian Jordan (17) and Andruw Jones (16). To go along
with that is a .303 batting average, third-highest on the club.
</P>
<P>
   One key to having both of those elements working for him is
consistently using a more controlled swing at the plate, something
hitting coach Don Baylor has stressed to him this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a more experienced hitter,'' Klesko said. ``I'm not
swinging all crazy. I go up there and if I get extended it's going
to go out of the park anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Plans for Lopez
</P>
<P>
   For now, manager Bobby Cox said he's planning to use Javy Lopez
as a designated hitter when he's activated Thursday in New York for
the series against the Yankees. After that first game, he might
decide to catch him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mind taking six days off and DH,'' Lopez said,
referring to the three games in New York and three in Toronto.
``Another week is less pressure for my knee, but it's whatever they
want me to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Lopez continued his comeback from a sprained knee Sunday by
running the bases, doing some sprints and practicing a slide in the
outfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``Especially with the brace, everything I do, I don't feel it,''
Lopez said.
</P>
<P>
   A start for Hunter
</P>
<P>
   Brian Hunter got the start at first base Sunday against
right-hander Jin Ho Cho just so he could get some more at-bats
before the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter had started only once since June 16, when he sprained an
ankle in Houston. Outside of his start July 3 in New York, Hunter
had only eight at-bats until Sunday and was hitless in them. He
went 0-for-3 with a walk Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't try to put too much into every at-bat. Just try to
be comfortable, try to relax,'' Hunter said. ``It's hard to do,
seeing as how you don't play much.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter said his sore ankle bothers him more when he pinch hits,
so he's been running in the dugout tunnel every couple innings in
games when he might pinch hit. He said the ankle is much improved
in that past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Post All-Star rotation
</P>
<P>
   Cox said he's planning to start the rotation over when the
Braves resume their season Thursday against the Yankees in New
York, with Tom Glavine starting Thursday, Greg Maddux on Friday and
Kevin Millwood on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   McGlinchy a spectator
</P>
<P>
   During his trip home to Boston over the All-Star break, rookie
reliever Kevin McGlinchy figured he'd take in the All-Star Game at
Fenway. He has four tickets in the bleacher seats and plans to take
a former high school coach and a couple buddies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured it'd be a good time to see it at Fenway, since it'll
probably be the last All-Star Game there,'' said McGlinchy, who's
from the Boston suburb of Malden.
</P>
<P>
   He might check out the home run derby tonight as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather see that than the game,'' McGlinchy said. ``I've
seen a lot of baseball. I'm pretty tired of it.

 &HT;    Burton: From 38 to first in a Jiffy
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUDON, N.H. _ With about 10 laps remaining in Sunday's Jiffy
Lube 300 at New Hampshire International Speedway, NASCAR rookie
Tony Stewart asked crew chief Greg Zipadelli how big his lead was
on the second-place car of John Andretti.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to know how much so I can ease up,'' Stewart said over
the radio in his No. 20 Pontiac.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost a straightaway,'' Zipadelli said. ``He's doing the same
thing we're doing, so go nice and easy. Just float it in and go
easy on the gas.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, looking for his first Winston Cup victory in only his
18th start, was concerned because he didn't make a pit stop in the
final 105 laps of the 300-lap event.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 43 teams in Sunday's race calculated that a full,
22-gallon tank of gas would last about 95 laps on the flat,
1.058-mile oval. But Stewart's team gambled that their fuel would
last longer.
</P>
<P>
   So did Andretti, who also made his final pit stop on lap 196.
But Jeff Burton, who was running third, took a late splash of gas,
making a 2.6-second pit stop with only 11 laps remaining.
</P>
<P>
   As Stewart slowed in the final laps to conserve what little fuel
remained, his lead slowly diminished. As Andretti and Burton got
closer, Stewart's fuel tank got emptier.
</P>
<P>
   And, with less than three laps left, Stewart barked the words
Zipadelli didn't want to hear: ``We're out of gas.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart's car stalled on the back straightaway, and then
Andretti's No. 43 Pontiac ran out of gas only seconds later.
</P>
<P>
   That opened the door for Burton, who started 38th but won the
July race in New Hampshire for the third year in a row. It was the
biggest comeback victory in a Winston Cup race since Bill Elliott
started 38th and won the Firecracker 400 at Daytona International
Speedway in July 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel bad for those guys because it's a bad way to lose a
race,'' Burton said. ``But I knew how far the car would run on the
amount of gas, so I knew that we had to pit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some fortune at the end, obviously, with the No. 20 car
running out of gas. But after starting 38th and making all those
big changes to the car, you're just looking to put yourself in a
position to win and we did that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ninth-year driver Kenny Wallace finished second for the first
time in 169 career starts. Two-time defending Winston Cup champion
Jeff Gordon was third, followed by points leader Dale Jarrett and
Elliott. Stewart, who led 103 of the final 105 laps, finished 10th.
Andretti fell to 18th.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went for it and, obviously, we went with the wrong
decision,'' Zipadelli said. ``We thought we'd be about half of a
lap short on fuel, and we were short a little more than that. I
guess we could have pitted for gas, but it's easy to look back and
say what's right and what's wrong. We'll just have to live with
this and move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, 28, stormed out of his car after the race, and quickly
changed clothes in his hauler. The former Indy League Racing
champion left the speedway with his fiance, Krista Dwyer, without
answering reporters' questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't even bother with it right now,'' Stewart said. ``I don't
want to talk about it. I'll talk about it next week.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Washington Redskins coach Joe Gibbs, who owns Stewart's
car, said Zipadelli made the decision not to make a pit stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Stewart) wants to win as badly as everybody else and he wants
to win every race,'' Gibbs said. ``I think he would have had the
same vote and he wanted to try and go for it. We all did.''
Apparently, Stewart took out his frustration before leaving the
track. His car was damaged in the rear after he apparently scuffed
Ernie Irvan's No. 36 Pontiac in turn 2 of the final lap.
</P>
<P>
   ``He must have been mad at me for something,'' Irvan said. ``He
hit me in the back and he hit me in the side, so I hit him back. I
guess he ran out of gas and was mad at me because I didn't get his
car full.''
</P>
<P>
   With his fourth victory of the season, Burton moved into second
place in the points standings, trailing Jarrett by 240. Burton
moved past Mark Martin, who finished sixth, and Bobby Labonte, who
finished a season-worst 38th after wrecking on lap 204.
</P>
<P>
   Burton says he isn't worried about the belief that Stewart lost
the race, rather than him winning it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care one bit,'' Burton said. ``It doesn't matter to
me. We got that trophy and we got those points. I don't care how we
did it. You win a lot of races different ways, and to win races
you've gotta put yourself in position. We put ourselves in position
and did a better job than they did.

 &HT;    Unfriendly day of racing has drivers fuming, feuding
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUDON, N.H. _ Tempers on the track and in the garage at New
Hampshire International Speedway on Sunday left little doubt that
NASCAR has reached the second half of its Winston Cup schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Ernie Irvan was mad at rookie Tony Stewart. Dale Jarrett and
Rusty Wallace were venting at Jeff Gordon. And Stewart seemed upset
with everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett, the Winston Cup points leader, lost third place in the
Jiffy Lube 300 to Gordon, whose No. 24 Chevy made contact with
Jarrett's No. 88 Ford as both cars left turn four on the final lap.
</P>
<P>
   When the drivers left their cars in the garage, Gordon and
Jarrett screamed at each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``You came down into the grass and then across in front of me,''
Gordon said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hit me three times,'' Jarrett replied. ``You're taking up
the race track.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Jarrett didn't seem too amused with Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a little rubbing coming in,'' Jarrett said. ``Gordon
caught me at the end. He hit me once down turns one and two, and
then I blocked him down the backstretch. Then he ran in the back of
me, not once, but three times in turns three and four. We have a
lot of racing to do. We'll see each other again.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon and his crew chief, Ray Evernham, were admonished by
NASCAR officials after the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a slick, one-groove race track, tough to pass and the
tires were really old,'' Gordon said. ``We came down the last lap
and we were slipping and sliding around. I felt like I got at least
a wheel inside D.J., down the back straightaway.
</P>
<P>
   ``He crowded me quite a bit. I got in the back of him in turn
three and finished third. There's nobody I want to race any cleaner
than D.J., but I think the heat of the moment kind of got to both
of us. We'll patch things up. Me and D.J. are fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett wasn't the only driver upset with Gordon. On lap 141,
Wallace's No. 2 Ford appeared to hit Gordon's car between turns
three and four. Wallace's car made a 180-degree turn and hit the
outside wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We both went down into the turn; he was on the apron and I was
on the race track,'' Wallace said. ``He stayed on the apron and
when I came off of turn four, he just got into my quarter-panel and
that was it. I just wish he could have been a little more
patient.''
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt Jr.'s short day
</P>
<P>
   Dale Earnhardt Jr., making his second Winston Cup start,
finished last after completing only 44 laps because of mechanical
failure. Earnhardt Jr., who chipped his right shoulder during an
accident in a Busch Grand National race last week, was running in
the top 15 before leaving the track. Awesome again
</P>
<P>
   Bill Elliott calculated his fuel mileage correctly, and finished
fifth, snapping a drought of 55 races without a top-five. He
started 43rd after wrecking his primary car on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tickled considering how we started the weekend,'' Elliott
said. ``The fuel mileage was key. The car was not good in the
beginning, but we kept on making the right adjustments and it sure
paid off.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Elliott's best finish since he was fifth at Martinsville,
Va., on Sept. 29, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Endurance
</P>
<P>
   Mark Martin, who underwent arthroscopic knee surgery on
Wednesday, finished sixth and moved past Bobby Labonte in the
points standings to third. Martin completed all 300 laps, despite
having Busch driver Matt Kenseth standing by as a relief driver.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called him the other day and, no kidding, he had his leg in
the MRI tube and he was talking on the phone about race cars,''
Kenseth said of Martin. ``That's the truth. That's the way he is.
He's tough. He's real tough.

 &HT;    Spain's Sergio Garcia: An eye on the Tiger
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARNOUSTIE, Scotland _ Maybe we should all forget about this
forced, fairly fabricated ``rivalry'' between Tiger Woods and David
Duval and ponder the bigger, more global picture. The true rivalry
for the next millennium might have germinated nine days ago, when
Woods won at the Western Open and Spanish teenager Sergio Garcia
scored his first European Tour victory at the Irish Open.
</P>
<P>
   Forget about waiting for the staged, 18-hole, made-for-TV
exhibition next month between Woods and Duval. What will be
settled, the International Management Group Cup? The tastier
confrontation could be happening, beginning with this week's
British Open, on every occasion when Woods and Garcia peg it up in
the same major championship. And you can sit back and relax. There
are probably about 100 of them remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Could Garcia come to Carnoustie and his third British Open,
though only 19, as a hotter property? Hardly. With a pro debut
flurry reminiscent of Woods' 1996 start that produced two quick PGA
Tour victories, Garcia won in Ireland than almost won Loch Lomond
after an opening 62.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, the comparison with Tiger, being called Europe's Tiger
Woods, does not bother me,'' says the youngster known as ``El
Nino'' (The Kid). ``I have always said that if you are compared to
other players, that means I have done something good. ... But I
don't want to read in the newspapers that `The European Tiger Woods
Wins Irish Open.' I want to read that Sergio Garcia wins it. I want
to be recognized as Sergio Garcia.''
</P>
<P>
   No problem there. Leaving the scoring tent at Loch Lomond, he
found his toughest obstacle all day, a unyielding herd of kids
perhaps just a few years younger. Mothers and daughters scurried to
pose with Sergio and he gladly obliged with outstretched arms. He
not only has all the shots, he has all the charm and composure _
things that it took Woods a few years to discover.
</P>
<P>
   He is a lock for the European Ryder Cup team, moving to seventh
after a tie for second at Loch Lomond. He's one of the favorites
here, although he never has played the treacherous course. He'll
play a practice round today with countryman Jose Maria Olazabal,
his likely partner in September at Brookline. Just to keep him
further informed, Garcia employs the man who caddied for Mark
O'Meara last year at Royal Birkdale, Jerry Higginbotham.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard it's the probably the most difficult golf course in
the world,'' Garcia said, ``but I will have the mentality that pars
are going to be good. If I make a lot of pars and some birdies and
try not to make too many mistakes, I will be up there. I'll try to
shoot as low as I can and see if I have a chance to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody would be surprised if Garcia, who broke 80 at the age of
10 and became a scratch player at 13, contended this week. As a
16-year-old, he competed in the British Open at Royal Lytham in
1996, missing the cut, then tied for 28th last year at Royal
Birkdale. Garcia finished third in his first PGA Tour event, the
Byron Nelson Classic in May. Both the U.S. and European Tours will
be tugging at him to make a full-time commitment for 2000,
regardless what this week brings. He will play in the U.S. next
month in the PGA Championship and the Sprint International.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't seem to have a nerve in his body,'' said Mark
James, the Ryder Cup captain. ``A lot of guys look amateur when
they turn pro, but he doesn't.''
</P>
<P>
   The headlines out of Ireland declared: ``El Nino Storm Warning
... El Nino Cloud Nine-O.'' For once around here, they weren't
exaggerations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody had been looking for these young guns for such a
long time and nothing really happened,'' said Sweden's Jesper
Parnevik. ``Then Tiger came along and he just blew everybody's mind
the way he played when he turned professional. Now Sergio has the
same mindset that he was going to come out and beat everyone. He is
proving that he has the ability to do it. He just doesn't hit any
bad shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Scotland's Colin Montgomerie zinged Garcia a bit for
some tabloid-inspired brashness last week, when Garcia was quoted
as saying his 62 could have been a 59, the veteran is most
impressed. Then again, why not? If you combined the fire and
short-game creativity of Olazabal and Seve Ballesteros and tossed
in monster length and pinpoint irons, this is the package Garcia
carries around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every so often a player like this comes along,'' Montgomerie
said, ``and we are lucky on this occasion that he's European.''
</P>
<P>
   The success has not come without explanation. Garcia played in
nearly 30 pro tournaments as an amateur.
</P>
<P>
   ``He seemed to be brought up and bred for golf like Tiger Woods
was,'' observed Georgia Tech's Matt Kuchar, whose defense at last
year's U.S. Amateur was ended by Garcia in the quarterfinals. ``I
think he was taught what to expect. I don't think Justin Rose and I
had that preparation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a lot of fight in him,'' Woods said. ``I pride myself
in that I never gave up on the golf course and he's the same. He's
more prepared at a younger age than I was.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods, if you recall, took a few years to realize that not every
green is to be approached from high rough. Garcia's already
demonstrates a mature, major championship mindset. He is excited
about executing the low, bump-and-run shots of links golf, and
merely to be here.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can win or finish second or third or whatever I do, the
British Open is just like a big present for me,'' he said. ``I'm
just glad I got in without having to qualify.

BRITISH OPEN SITE SAID TO BE ONE OF WORLD'S TOUGHEST 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Winning the British Open at Carnoustie Golf Club is never a
breeze, especially if the wind howls.
</P>
<P>
   When Gary Player won in 1968 at Carnoustie, he shot a 1-over-par
289. That is the highest winning score in the last 50 years of the
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   On a calm day, Carnoustie is no picnic. On a blustery Scottish
day, Carnoustie is a potential nightmare. Players leave Carnoustie
with vivid memories, high scores and horror stories. But for a
complete test of championship golf, few locations in the world
offer a greater challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is by far the toughest venue we'll play,'' said Tiger
Woods, looking forward to this year's British Open, which begins
Thursday at Carnoustie. ``I remember playing the 1996 Scottish Open
there, and the wind conditions were extreme. I'd hit 4-iron, 4-iron
into No. 17, then hit driver, driver the very next day into the
same hole. The wind can wreak havoc.''
</P>
<P>
   It can also wreck confidence, which will make this year's Open
championship a terrific test. The Open has not been played at
Carnoustie since 1975, when Tom Watson won the first of his five
British Open titles, defeating Jack Newton in a playoff.
</P>
<P>
   In the 24 years since Carnoustie was host to the Open, it has
become even more intimidating. The course has been lengthened from
7,065 yards to 7,361, the longest on the British Open circuit, and
14 bunkers have been added. In 1975 Carnoustie played as a par 72.
But this week it will be a par 71, with the 479-yard No. 12
converted from a par 5 into a par 4.
</P>
<P>
   Located on Scotland's east coast, in a town of fewer than 14,000
people against the North Sea, Carnoustie demands different shots
from day to day, depending on the direction and strength of the
wind.
</P>
<P>
   And Carnoustie's zigzag layout makes it more distinctive, with
no more than two consecutive holes playing in the same direction.
You can forget about playing five or six consecutive holes with a
prevailing wind. Just as you adjust to having the wind at your
back, on the next hole it could blow in your face.
</P>
<P>
   Players thank the golf gods when the wind is calm, the way it
was in 1995 when Wayne Riley shot 12 under par (276) to win the
Scottish Open. But at the 1996 Scottish Open the wind blew
consistently from 30 to 40 mph. Ian Woosnam was the winner at 1
over par (289), and there were only four rounds in the 60s in the
entire tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Woods shot an opening-round 81. The average score the second day
was 78.8. Nine over par made the cut. Some players still shudder
when they think about that tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those were the worst conditions I've ever played in,'' said
Jim Furyk, who has finished fourth in the last two British Opens.
``That was my first taste of links golf. I missed the cut. I'm
looking forward to going back with a little more experience.''
</P>
<P>
   But how high will the scores be this year if the wind whips on a
longer, tougher Carnoustie?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the toughest links course you will find anywhere in the
world,'' said Ernie Els, a two-time U.S. Open champion. ``If the
wind blows, 300 might be the winning score.''
</P>
<P>
   To prepare for this week's challenge, Woods, David Duval, Lee
Janzen, Mark O'Meara and Payne Stewart spent last week in Ireland,
playing golf, fishing and adjusting to the change in time zone and
climate. Everyone will work on lowering his ball flight, hoping to
hit more penetrating shots that bore into the wind.
</P>
<P>
   Americans have won the last four British Opens: John Daly
(1995), Tom Lehman (1996), Justin Leonard (1997) and O'Meara
(1998). This year Woods enters as the clear-cut favorite, ranked
No. 1 in the world after winning three times in his last four
starts and playing the most consistent golf of his professional
career.
</P>
<P>
   Is Woods' confidence at an all-time high?
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty high after I won by 12 at Augusta,'' said Woods,
referring to his record-setting performance at the 1997 Masters.
``But it's pretty high now.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods' power is a clear advantage at Carnoustie, where the wind
and the course's length will become even greater obstacles for
shorter hitters. The winner, however, will be someone who avoids
the potential double-bogeys and triple-bogeys that loom on every
hole. There are no breather holes at Carnoustie, and even someone
striking the ball well can suddenly run into deep trouble with just
one mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Carnoustie's four finishing holes rank with the
world's toughest. No. 15 is a par 4, 472 yards, and most players
will need at least a long iron on their second shot to reach the
green. No. 16 is a par 3, 250 yards, one of the few par 3s where
you can see a professional player reach for a driver. Both No. 17
and No. 18 are long par 4s that feature the Barry Burn, a winding
stream that comes into play on both holes.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The year's first two majors provided great theater, with Jose
Maria Olazabal rebounding from career-threatening health problems
to win his second Masters, and then Stewart making a putt for the
ages to edge Phil Mickelson at the U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   But as tough as those acts will be to follow, the British could
be just as spectacular. So many golfers could be considered
favorites _ Woods, Vijay Singh, David Duval, and Els to name just a
few. And imagine the excitement if Sergio Garcia, Spain's
19-year-old wondrous talent, finds himself in contention this
weekend. But no matter who wins, expect Sunday to produce a worthy
champion. And expect Carnoustie to keep its storied reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of the top players are going to be at the top,''
said Duval, looking for his first major championship. ``This course
is going to demand very, very good play. If the weather conditions
are like they can be, it might make the U.S. Open at Pinehurst look
easy.''

WORLD CUP WINNERS NOW FACE UNCERTAIN FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Having won the Women's World Cup, the U.S.
soccer team paraded around Disneyland Sunday morning and then
headed East for a blizzard of morning television shows and magazine
covers. An international tour is being planned for later this year,
and the team is expected to remain largely intact for the 2000
Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia. Beyond that, the financial
and professional future of the players remains uncertain as the
euphoria from Saturday's victory wears off like a champagne
hangover.
</P>
<P>
   While the World Cup was a galvanizing event for three weeks,
like the Olympics it figures to be as disposable as it was
riveting. There is no women's professional league to sustain
interest, although the feasibility of one is being studied with a
target date of 2001. Even as they celebrated Saturday's tense,
penalty-kick victory over China, organizers were quick to say that
no one should expect 90,000 fans in the Rose Bowl any time soon,
unless it happens to be college football season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NFL had its breakthrough in the Colts-Giants championship
game in 1958, but by that time the league was more than 30 years
old,'' said Alan Rothenberg, chairman of the board of directors for
the 1999 Women's World Cup. ``These things don't happen overnight.
It's a long, slow build to get there.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, however, as it set attendance records and brought
unprecedented interest to the sport, the Women's World Cup was a
landmark event. Saturday's final was the most-watched soccer game
in this country, drawing an estimated 40 million viewers on ABC.
More than 650,000 tickets were sold for the World Cup, making it
the largest sporting event ever held for women.
</P>
<P>
   Not since the men's hockey team won the 1980 Winter Olympics has
a U.S. team so enamored the American public, said Marla Messing,
the president of the Women's World Cup organizing committee.
Breakthroughs were achieved in inspiring young girls and boys, in
shattering the myth that spectators would not pay to see women's
sports and in rebuffing any lingering belief that women do not play
as fiercely and entertainingly as men.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're on the cutting edge of one of the most
significant cultural revolutions in the world,'' said Hank
Steinbrecher, the executive director of the U.S. Soccer Federation.
``It states that in team sports, women are full partners of men,
not subordinates.'' He added: ``Ten to 20 years from now, those
young girls watching will be playing.''
</P>
<P>
   The most urgent concern for the American women, aside from
preparing for the 2000 Olympics, is establishing a professional
league to extend their careers and secure their place atop the
sport. The United States got a jump on the world in women's soccer
with a lack of cultural restraints and a well-organized grass-roots
system, but the rest of the world is catching up.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we want to remain among the best teams in the world, we
need a league,'' coach Tony DiCicco said.
</P>
<P>
   Rothenberg said that a women's league seemed inevitable as early
as 2001, but what form it would take is anyone's guess. Even after
the success of this Women's World Cup, much skepticism remains
about the viability of a women's league. Keith Cooper, a spokesman
for FIFA, soccer's world governing body, cautioned that there were
only about 30 superstars in the women's game worldwide, which would
leave only three per team in a 10-team league.
</P>
<P>
   One of the women's professional basketball leagues folded last
December, and the surviving Women's National Basketball Association
is being bankrolled by the deep pockets of the NBA. Major League
Soccer is struggling to keep itself alive as a men's professional
league and does not appear capable of sustaining a women's league.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a big difference between the shop-window effect of a
World Cup and a week-to-week league,'' Cooper said.
</P>
<P>
   Soccer officials and sports marketing experts said they believed
a women's league might survive for several reasons. Unlike MLS, a
women's league could attract the best players in the world.
Advertisers are looking to expand their limited choices in women's
sports. And families seeking moderately priced entertainment might
be attracted to a game that both their sons and daughters play.
</P>
<P>
   The suburban, college-educated, mostly white, ponytailed
American team ``is the demographic of the American public,'' said
Allan Brown, the chief executive of Simon Marketing of Los Angeles,
which does promotional work for McDonald's, a Women's World Cup
sponsor. ``I've been in sports marketing 25 years, and this is the
most refreshing group of athletes. They show a lot of gratitude for
what they've accomplished.''
</P>
<P>
   George Taylor, the president of Sports Mondial Inc., a New
York-based sports marketing firm, said he believed a women's league
could survive if it were placed in small stadiums, because empty
seats ``say to the viewers that this is not big time, and when it
is not considered big time, it's over.''
</P>
<P>
   The American women are expected to begin training again in
August, with a tournament scheduled in the Midwest in early
October. Later matches are being planned in South Africa and Egypt
as the Americans seek to export their skills and their message of
gender equity. The players' contracts with the soccer federation
expire in August, however, and renewal could prove thorny, given
that salaries average $25,000 to $40,000 a year _ meager by men's
standards.
</P>
<P>
   The 20 American players are scheduled to receive paltry World
Cup bonuses of $12,500 apiece even though they comprised the most
watched team in the history of women's sports, and they are
expected to provide a profit of $1 million to $4 million to World
Cup organizers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thrilled about what they've done, but it drives me crazy
how much these women are getting paid,'' said Billie Jean King, the
tennis great and activist for women's sports. ``It reminds me of
tennis in the '60s and early '70s. One or two were making decent
money, but no one else was. That's not good enough.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Robert Contigulia, president of the national soccer federation,
said that additional bonuses were being considered for the women's
team. Perhaps the federation will draw on the $60 million legacy
from the 1994 men's World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're at the top of the list of women's professional team
sports, but our job is to do better,'' Steinbrecher, the U.S.
Soccer Federation official, said. ``We intend to do that.'' He
added: ``This is lightning in a bottle. The queen mother doesn't
have enough money to pay them what they deserve.''
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrecher said the federation also had to seek more
involvement by black and Hispanic players.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about giving kids choices,'' said goalkeeper Briana
Scurry, one of two blacks on the team. ``You've got to go in the
inner city, where the African-American and Hispanic athletes are.
Then you'll have a better depiction of the country as a whole at
some point.''
</P>
<P>
   Players and team officials said they expected DiCicco and
Michelle Akers, the defensive midfielder, to return for the Olympic
season. Despite suffering from chronic fatigue syndrome, Akers
demonstrated during the World Cup that she, not Mia Hamm, was
perhaps the most vital component of the American team and was
deserving of the label of world's best player.
</P>
<P>
   But that was a matter to debate at another time. Sunday was a
day of celebration at Disneyland, the players realizing that what
they had done was no Mickey Mouse accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope this gives people the courage to put on other big
events,'' said Julie Foudy, the American co-captain. ``We've always
watched men do great things in front of crowds. After watching
women do great things in front of crowds, I'm looking forward to
seeing the repercussions.''

 &HT;    Braves stomp Reds 8-1
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ That the Braves beat the Boston Red Sox 8-1 Sunday
afternoon was gravy.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves sealed the first-half deal with back-to-back stellar
outings by Tom Glavine and Greg Maddux to give the team eight wins
in the past 11 games. They're sitting at 55-34 at the All-Star
break, tops in the National League and not far off last year's
59-29, which came with two fewer serious injuries to combat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ended the first half on a real positive note with a great
team win,'' Chipper Jones said. ``We executed everything
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Ending a season series that had been pretty tense thus far, the
Braves managed to run with this one without much ado. Maddux rolled
to his 10th win, Ryan Klesko hit two home runs to give him 13 for
the season, and Walt Weiss got it all started with a couple of hits
and a couple of runs his first two times up.
</P>
<P>
   Weiss drove in a run, then scored his second on Jones' second
sacrifice fly to put the Braves up 3-1 on Korean rookie pitcher Jin
Ho Cho in the third inning. With the way Maddux pitched, that lead
was plenty.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux pitched eight innings and allowed only a run after Darren
Lewis singled to lead off the game. Maddux cruised into the break
with his fourth win in a row, five in his past six starts, to boost
his record to 10-5 at the break and lower his ERA from 4.64 to 3.40
in the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inconsistent, but I survived pretty much,'' said Maddux of his
first half.
</P>
<P>
   He's allowed only four earned runs in his last 41 2/3 innings
for an ERA of 0.80 over that span. One big difference catcher Eddie
Perez has seen is in Maddux's change-up, ever since Maddux told
Perez he was going to focus on the quality of that pitch and its
downward break instead of trying to pinpoint it on the corners.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're not doing things properly you have to start from
scratch,'' Maddux said. ``Trying to locate a change-up is one of
the hardest things to do; you have to be really locked in. It's
just as effective down in the middle of the plate sometimes as one
up on the corner.''
</P>
<P>
   But still Maddux says his run of success is mostly about
locating his fastball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything else works off that,'' Maddux said.
</P>
<P>
   His win backing up to Glavine's nine-inning performance in the
Braves 2-1 victory on Saturday has the Braves looking an awful lot
like the Braves at the break.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the way Glavine pitched (Saturday) and Maddux pitched
today, our starting pitching is probably as strong as it's been all
season,'' manager Bobby Cox said. ``Looks like our starters are
going to be fine.

IRABU COMES THROUGH AS YANKS AVOID SWEEP BY METS  
</HEADLINE>
 (rk) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Hideki Irabu was exiled to the bullpen at the start
of this season, branded as the ``fat toad'' by New York Yankees
owner, George Steinbrenner, and he wondered if he would ever fit in
with teammates who did not share a language with him.
</P>
<P>
   Fast forward three months to Sunday. Now a vital contributor to
the Yankees' pitching staff, Irabu pitched and grittily prevailed
in the most crucial game of his three-season tenure in pinstripes,
beating the New York Mets, 6-3, and preventing his team from
getting swept in a series closely watched by the city _ and, of
course, by Steinbrenner.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, who had five runs batted in from left fielders
Ricky Ledee and Chad Curtis Sunday, went into the three-day
All-Star break with a 52-34 record, four games ahead of Boston in
the American League East, and on a pace to win 98 games. The Mets
are 50-39, five games behind the Atlanta Braves in the National
League East.
</P>
<P>
   Fans of both teams need a breather, too, after three days of
suspenseful baseball played to sellout crowds. Shea Stadium housed
53,869 Sunday, and the three-day total of 161,481 was the largest
in club history. By beating the Mets Sunday, the Yankees managed to
split the six games between the teams this year.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Piazza, who slammed memorable three-run home runs Friday
and Saturday, scoffed at the idea that six games between the Mets
and Yankees were too much. Maybe, Piazza said, there should be
more.
</P>
<P>
   A substantial portion of the Yankees' family would disagree, for
many within the organization _ players and staff _ believe they
have little to gain. They are expected to win, and if they lose,
well, then there is always the possibility Steinbrenner will react.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees called up talented left-hander Ed Yarnall Sunday and
sent Todd Erdos to Triple A Columbus, and nobody could really
figure out why, because Yarnall is a starter and the Yankees needed
a reliever. ``This was thrown at us by the organization,'' said
manager Joe Torre. ``He's been throwing lights out and we
anticipated seeing him, but yesterday after the game, we got the
call.''
</P>
<P>
   The move smacked of Steinbrenner backlash. The Yankees were all
aware of the stakes going into Sunday's game, when Irabu pitched to
avoid the sweep.
</P>
<P>
   Irabu (6-3) pitched the first inning somewhat unsure how good
his stuff was, or how he was going to beat the Mets. He has been
using his curveball to get ahead in the count, but Sunday, he
wasn't able to throw his curve for a strike until the end of the
second inning. And he was seeing some very strange readings from
the Shea Stadium radar on his fastball.
</P>
<P>
   When Irabu pitches in parks where the radar results are posted,
as they are in Shea Stadium, he will sometimes glance to see how
hard he is throwing, to gauge how he should use his fastball. If
he's throwing 94-95 mph, then he can feel free to attack. If he is
throwing 89-91 mph _ and that's about as low as Irabu throws his
fastball _ then he'll adjust accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   Irabu's fastball was popping in the first inning, registering
90-93 mph on other radar guns located in the section behind home
plate. But the readings shown at Shea were much worse: 86 mph
sometimes 87 mph, and there were those among the Yankees who
wondered if the low numbers were posted to play a head game with
Irabu.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was throwing as hard as I could,'' said Irabu, grinning,
``and I looked up there and saw 85 mph, and I said, `You've got to
be kidding me. I might as well give up on the fastball.'''
</P>
<P>
   Irabu labored early, and after the Mets scored a pair of runs in
the third, he had thrown 64 pitches. Ledee hammered his three-run
homer off Orel Hershiser in the fourth, giving the Yankees a 3-2
edge, but Irabu quickly pitched into another mess in the bottom
half of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Cedeno singled to lead off, stole second and raced home
when Rey Ordonez doubled into the gap in left-center. Orel
Hershiser attempted a sacrifice bunt, but when Tino Martinez made a
poor choice and tried to throw out Ordonez at third,
unsuccessfully, Irabu and the Yankees were in deep. The score was
tied, Irabu already had thrown 80 pitches and there were two
runners on and nobody out. ``I just didn't want that situation to
get any worse,'' said Irabu.
</P>
<P>
   Pitching to Rickey Henderson, Irabu twice threw his curve in the
dirt, and both times catcher Jorge Posada blocked the ball and kept
the runners in place. Then Irabu struck out Henderson with a
fastball inside, 94 mph. One out.
</P>
<P>
   Edgardo Alfonzo followed, and with his first pitch, Irabu tried
a splitter _ low and in the dirt _ and Posada blocked this as well.
When a catcher saves a run like this, Joe Girardi noted later, it's
just as good as an RBI hit. Irabu threw a fastball away and Alfonzo
flied to short right, too shallow for Ordonez to score. Two outs.
</P>
<P>
   John Olerud, the Mets' lanky .300-hitter, was next, and in his
first two plate appearances, Irabu hadn't thrown him a strike and
Olerud walked twice. Trying to get ahead in the count, Irabu threw
a first-pitch fastball to Olerud, who almost never swings at the
first pitch and Olerud stroked a looping line drive to left.
</P>
<P>
   The second baseman, Chuck Knoblauch, was sure it was going to
drop, and so was David Cone and others watching from the Yankees'
bench. It was a bright day and the outfielders had been having a
hard time picking up the ball. But there was Ledee racing in,
running and running and reaching down and snaring the ball knee
high. The threat was over, Irabu had survived.
</P>
<P>
   But Hershiser (9-6) would not get through the fifth. O'Neill and
Bernie Williams singled, Tino Martinez walked to load the bases and
Scott Brosius singled in front of Cedeno, who appeared to lose
sight of the ball. O'Neill scored the tie-breaking run. After
left-hander Rigo Beltran relieved Hershiser, the
right-handed-hitting Curtis pinch-hit for Ledee and dumped a
two-run single to left. Yankees 6, Mets 3.
</P>
<P>
   Irabu pitched three more innings, throwing a total of 127
pitches _ more than in any start in his Yankees' career. ``He made
pretty good pitches the rest of the game,'' said the Mets manager
Bobby Valentine. ``The balls that we hit hard were not much to
speak of.''
</P>
<P>
   And thus, the Mets went into the All-Star break feeling good
about taking 2 of 3 from the Yankees for the first time, and the
Yankees felt good about getting through the weekend mostly intact.
``We can all sleep a little better,'' said O'Neill.

SPORTS COLUMN: TWO SERIES AREN'T ENOUGH 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: The IRT, IND and BMT are abbreviations of former New York
City subway lines.) 
 (rk) 
 By IRA BERKOW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The town was clamorous in partisanship. Mike Piazza
recalled hearing it from both sides, even over the ritualistic
cacophony of sirens, horns and assorted denunciations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beat them Yanks!'' someone shouted to the New York Mets'
catcher on the street.
</P>
<P>
   A New York Yankees fan, somewhere else, put him on notice.
``We're gonna kick your butt!'' Piazza was informed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This series held so much emotion,'' said Piazza, who enjoyed
the series of his life for the Mets, ``especially for the middle of
the season. I've never felt this way before. And because of it,
because we'd gotten the short end of the stick in the past in this
series, you were made to feel like an outcast, like you were a bad
neighbor or something.''
</P>
<P>
   It seems New Yorkers haven't reviled one another so happily
since the Dodgers and Giants moved to the West Coast and desisted
from playing their version of the IRT, IND and BMT series with the
Pinstripers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome,'' read the Shea Stadium message board in center field
before Sunday's game, ``to the Subway Series.'' And when the
lineups were announced, the 53,869 fans who squeezed into the
ballpark this sunny, breezy, gorgeous summer Sunday afternoon booed
and cheered as their partial Big Apple hearts dictated.
</P>
<P>
   This was the largest regular-season crowd at Shea Stadium since
1972, and the three-game attendance over the weekend of 160,740 _
each game a sellout _ was the greatest weekend box-office series in
Mets history, beating last year's three-game series against this
same cross-town rival by about 700 patrons.
</P>
<P>
   The same kind of tumult occurred at Yankee Stadium on the first
weekend of June when the two teams hooked up there. The Sunday
night game, on June 6, drew 56,294, the largest night crowd since
the Stadium was remodeled, in 1976. And the three-game attendance _
each game a sellout as well _ was 168,404, also a record for a
three-game series for the remodeled park.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees won 2 of 3 at the Stadium, exactly as they had in
1997, when interleague play was inaugurated, and again last season,
but the Mets won the first two games at Shea and were going for a
sweep.
</P>
<P>
   While the defending World Series champion Yankees were having
some problems, the mercurial Mets were on a hot streak, having
posted the best record in baseball, 23-10, since the ``Valentine's
Day Massacre,'' as some of the Mets call it, in which General
Manager Steve Phillips fired a few of manager Bobby Valentine's
coaches during a lackluster period.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza had been in the thick of things in the first two games at
Shea, having hit two homers _ the one on Saturday afternoon was
like a cannon shot and players were still talking about it a day
later _ and batting in seven runs, as well as throwing out three
baserunners. He is almost quietly becoming one of the great ball
players in New York history, and will soon be in Fenway Park, where
he will start his sixth straight All-Star Game. And he did what he
could to keep the sweet hopes of a sweep alive.
</P>
<P>
   He singled in the first inning to move a baserunner along with
two outs, but nothing else happened for the Mets. In the third,
with two outs and runners on first and third and the scored tied
0-0, he singled to center, driving in the lead run.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the joint was jumpin', though a considerable portion of
the mob, including one particular Yankee fan in the front row, the
city's first son, Andrew Giuliani, wearing a Tino Martinez T-shirt
(No. 24 on the back) in tribute to the Yankees first baseman, sat
on his hands, more or less like his dad, a lifelong Yankee fan.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees stormed back and took a lead that they would not
relinquish, as the Bronx boosters beat their palms and whooped
while the Flushing fans ground their teeth.
</P>
<P>
   In the fifth, Piazza, leading off, beat out a ground ball to
shortstop for his third straight hit of the game, and was stranded
there. He struck out in the seventh to end the inning and his day
at the plate, but the experience over all was one of exhilaration.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have to guard against,'' Piazza said, ``is a letdown
when we play Tampa Bay and Baltimore next week. Sure, we lost this
last game to the Yankees, but we played well. We have to keep this
excitement, this series in perspective. We have to remember,
there's still a lot of season left.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the series itself, and the positions taken by some that
it dilutes what might be a dream of a Subway World Series, or that
two series in one season between rival teams is redundant, Piazza
said: ``I think we've all heard the arguments, is it overkill, or
too many games. You look at this series and wonder if it's not
enough games. Maybe they should break up both leagues and put us in
the same division.''
</P>
<P>
   Interesting thought, but probably untenable. Even New Yorkers
might have a limit to unbridled passion.

ELLIOTT MAY FACE SUSPENSION FOR ARREST 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Jets' Jumbo Elliott faces disciplinary action by
the National Football League _ perhaps including a suspension _
after what the police said was a brawl in a bar.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott, 34, the Jets' left tackle and a key member of the
offense that was the fourth-highest scoring in the NFL last season,
was arrested at Bogart's, a popular team hangout in Long Beach,
N.Y., about midnight Friday. Also arrested were his former teammate
Matt O'Dwyer, 26, and Jason Fabini, 24, the club's top rookie last
season.
</P>
<P>
   The players will be arraigned Monday morning in Long Beach.
O'Dwyer faces the most serious charges; the police said he kicked
out the window of a patrol car after he was placed inside, sending
glass flying into the faces of two police officers. According to
O'Dwyer's father, Gerald, his son was to have left Sunday for
Cincinnati and his new team, the Bengals.
</P>
<P>
   The league takes a serious view of off-the-field situations
involving alcohol, drugs or violence, and each incident requires
counseling and adherence to strict guidelines of conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Last September, Elliott pleaded guilty to driving while
impaired, and he was fined $350 and his driver's license was
suspended for 90 days. He also had to undergo counseling. Because
of that arrest, Elliott now faces more severe disciplinary action.
</P>
<P>
   The league also has a policy for dealing with charges of violent
crimes, whether or not the person is convicted. Once charged with a
violent crime, the player is subject to counseling as well as
disciplinary action by NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue.
</P>
<P>
   The police said that Elliott urinated in the wash basin in the
women's bathroom of the bar. Confronted by a patron in the
restroom, the police said the 6-foot-7-inch, 300-pound Elliott
punched her in the stomach. Returning to the restaurant, he then
hit a male patron, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott's charges included assault and public lewdness, while
O'Dwyer was charged with criminal mischief, among other charges.
Fabini was charged with disorderly conduct. All three posted cash
bail _ $100 for Fabini, $10,000 for Elliott and $50,000 for
O'Dwyer.
</P>
<P>
   Fabini recently returned from a panel in Washington that
counseled this season's rookie crop about what it is like in a
player's first year in pro football and what dangers to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   A league spokesman, Greg Aiello, had no comment Sunday. The Jets
did not return phone calls asking for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Jets Coach Bill Parcells had nothing to say publicly
about Elliott's arrest when it happened, but the coach has a
history of not allowing his players' off-the-field problems affect
their status on the team. His most troubled player was Lawrence
Taylor, who had many run-ins with the law while he played for _ and
Parcells coached _ the Giants. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   EREZ CROSSING, Gaza Strip _ At this sun-baked juncture between
Israel and the Gaza Strip, the first Israeli-Palestinian summit
meeting in seven months began Sunday with an embrace and an
exchange of gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, presented Ehud Barak, the
new prime minister of Israel, with a dove-shaped Hanukkah menorah.
Barak gave Arafat a leather boxed set of the Koran and the Bible.
</P>
<P>
   And then the two men, a retired guerrilla fighter and a retired
general, who had spent most of their lives in violent conflict,
engaged in a 65-minute ice-breaker of a conversation, which seemed
to have gone swimmingly. When they emerged, Barak discreetly
grabbed Arafat, who looked frail, by the elbow of his trademark
fatigues and helped him up steps onto a stage.
</P>
<P>
   Standing side by side at lecterns, both leaders professed that a
new era of peacemaking lay ahead, in which they would be partners.
Arafat nodded vigorously as Barak, with pursed lips and a resolute
glare, said he was ``determined to overcome all the obstacles.''
</P>
<P>
   The rhetoric and the body language signaled a radical shift in
the tense, hostile relations that marked the tenure of Barak's
predecessor, Benjamin Netanhayu, even if the meeting produced good
chemistry more than anything tangible.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting Arafat just five days after he assumed office, Barak did
allay an anxiety of the Palestinians by promising that he would
move quickly to carry out the most recent peace agreement, the
so-called Wye River memorandum, named for the Maryland site where
it was negotiated. The agreement has been frozen since December.
</P>
<P>
   But Barak did not engage another of Arafat's chief concerns,
about the recent expansion of Jewish settlements in the West Bank.
He repeated his coalition's platform, saying that there would be no
new settlements and no demolition of existing ones. And he deferred
a substantive conversation on that and all other issues until after
his return from a one-week trip to Washington that starts Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Saying that Barak's resounding victory in May had raised hopes
for peace throughout the region, Arafat addressed the Israeli prime
minister as ``my friend and my partner.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am confident today that together we can give the peace
process seriously and truly the chance it deserves,'' Arafat said.
``It's time to put an end to the cycle of violence and
confrontation.''
</P>
<P>
   Answering in kind, Barak sounded determinedly, even lyrically,
hopeful. Although he did say also that a renewed effort at
peacemaking would inevitably have ``ups and downs and crises.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Chairman,'' he said, using Arafat's title as head of the
Palestine Liberation Organization, ``fathers, mothers and children,
Palestinians and Israelis alike, are waiting, expecting us, the
leaders, to provide them with a safer, better future. We should
find every drop of determination and leadership in our own souls to
do the job and change the landscape of this region.''
</P>
<P>
   Two days after taking office last week, Barak set off on a
whirlwind diplomatic tour intended to kick-start the stagnant peace
effort. He began with a cordial meeting with Hosni Mubarak, the
Egyptian president, on Friday, and following Sunday's meeting he
will see King Abdullah of Jordan and President Suleyman Demirel of
Turkey before flying to the United States for a one-week visit.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For the Palestinians, this first meeting with Barak was fraught
with expectations. They wanted not only a change in atmospherics,
which they definitely got, but a promise that some tangible
benefits would be forthcoming. Like Barak, Arafat is more patient
than those who surround him, but the Palestinian people are
frustrated and demand a peace dividend from their aging leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very moved by their beautiful words,'' said Mohammed
Jabr, a Ramallah resident, who watched the event on television.
``But now that I have wiped away the tears of my emotions, I would
like to see some actions.''
</P>
<P>
   Last December, about a week before the Israelis were supposed to
turn over a large chunk of the West Bank, Netanyahu, the former
prime minister, suspended compliance with the Wye memorandum after
carrying out the first phase of the three-phased agreement. He said
that the Palestinians were failing to meet their obligations to
improve security.
</P>
<P>
   When Barak was elected on a peace platform, the Palestinians
expected him to immediately thaw out the frozen Wye agreement,
which provided interim steps to peace, like the return of land and
prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   But instead he unnerved them by saying he would prefer to delay
carrying out Wye until the pending final status accords were
negotiated. That way, the final negotiations could begin
immediately and all the issues, ranging from land to Jerusalem to
the return of refugees, could be looked at as a whole, he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Arafat demanded that the Wye accord be carried out.
And Barak said it would be; Israeli army officials are reportedly
making preparations for the next hand-over of land _ about 7
percent of the West Bank, reportedly in the Ramallah area.
</P>
<P>
   But Barak may have made some headway. Nabil Shaath, a
Palestinian Cabinet minister, said after the meeting that if the
next phase of the Wye agreement were carried out swiftly, the
Palestinians would consider moving into the final status talks
before the third phase _ the hand-over of a final 13 percent of
land, reportedly in the Hebron area _ was undertaken.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will implement Wye and we will coordinate with the chairman
and the Palestinian Authority the way by which the advancement of
the final status negotiations will be combined with Wye's
implementation,'' Barak said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the land, some other components of Wye, like the
approval of a seaport in Gaza and the release of more political
prisoners, could probably be carried out relatively quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat demanded that Israel immediately stop all Jewish
settlement activity in the West Bank, calling it ``illegal and
destructive to the peace process.'' But the composition of Barak's
coalition, which includes the settlers' party, two ultra-Orthodox
parties and a relatively hawkish Russian immigrant party, would
make it difficult for him to take too hard a line on the
settlements.
</P>
<P>
   And the settlers' organizations, whose leaders say they have
tried in vain to see Barak, are gearing up to test him.

<P>
   ``The really painful problem that should be troubling the prime
minister is whether we're going to evacuate settlements, whether
thousands of Jews will be evacuated from their homes,'' Pinchas
Wallerstein, a settler leader, told Israeli Army Radio. ``Yes or
no?''
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians have also been concerned that Barak would
ignore them, devoting more energy to pursuing peace with Syria.
Barak, however, has said that he will seek peace on both fronts at
once in his ambitious pursuit of harmony in the whole region.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Arafat surprisingly went out of his way to endorse
the total regional approach. He said he hoped to see ``peace on all
tracks, including Syria and Lebanon.''
</P>
<P>
   Repeatedly, Arafat referred to the new Israeli prime minister as
a possible heir to the partnership he once forged with Yitzhak
Rabin, the late prime minister who used to be a mentor to Barak.
</P>
<P>
   In the style of Rabin, Barak chose to welcome Arafat on Sunday
by descending a stairway from the military compound building where
he was waiting. Dressed in a navy suit, he strode to greet the
Palestinian leader, who was clad in his traditional olive-drab
khakis, with a keffiyeh scarf wrapped around his head.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, who is a short man, put his arm around Arafat, who is
even shorter. He shook his hand, and they set off into what is
bound to be a complicated relationship.

A FLAT NOTE FOLLOWS A HIGH ONE FOR METS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The All-Star break came a day too late for the New
York Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of heading into the three-day respite on their highest
note of 1999, the Mets' final memory of the first-half of this
season will be of leaving runners at first and third with nobody
out in the fourth inning, after they had tied the score at 3-3.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets were shut out the rest of the way Sunday, while the New
York Yankees rallied for three runs in the fifth for a 6-3 victory
to avoid a humiliating sweep. And while the crowd of 53,869 was the
largest at Shea Stadium since June 10, 1972, it was a passive
atmosphere inside the ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   The game seemed to be let-down after Saturday's riveting 9-8
Mets' victory, which pinch hitter Matt Franco had won with a
two-out, two-strike, bases-loaded single in the bottom of the
ninth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we came out with any lack of intensity today,''
Mike Piazza said. ``But I think that any game would be
anti-climatic compared to yesterday.''
</P>
<P>
   General manager Steve Phillips agreed. ``Any game today in
comparison to yesterday would have come up short,'' he said
</P>
<P>
   And so the Mets head into the break at 50-39. Last season, the
Mets were 44-39 at this point, after the Braves had swept three
games from them in Atlanta in the weekend before the break. Then,
the Mets were 12 1/2 games behind Atlanta in the National League
East. Now, the Mets are five games behind the first-place Braves
and just one game out of the wild card spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been through the tough times and a lot of teams
haven't,'' manager Bobby Valentine said. ``What doesn't kill you
makes you stronger. And I think we're a real strong team.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets are a major-league best 23-11 since June 6, the day
they ended a season-high eight-game skid with a victory over the
Yankees to avoid a sweep. That was the day after Phillips had fired
three of Valentine's coaches.
</P>
<P>
   There have been plenty of other controversies this season,
including the ongoing saga of Valentine and Bobby Bonilla. The feud
reignited over the weekend, and Sunday morning, as Valentine,
Phillips and Bonilla were swarmed by reporters asking questions
about Bonilla's place on the team, Saturday's victory was all but
ignored, taking away from what should have been the Mets' finest
moment of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday was a forgettable day for the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we'd probably want to remember Saturday more than
today,'' Piazza said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Orel Hershiser definitely feels the same.
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser (9-6) was sharp early, but then allowed three runs in
the fourth. And after the Mets tied the game in the bottom of the
inning, Hershiser, who was going for his 200th career victory,
could not record an out in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a good sinker most of the game,'' said Hershiser, who
was charged with six runs on 10 hits in 4-plus innings. But he did
not have much else.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's thrown better,'' Valentine said of Hershiser. And after
the Yankees grabbed the lead, Hideki Irabu was able to shut down
the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Irabu battled in the fourth, after the Mets had tied the score
and had runners on first and third and nobody out.
</P>
<P>
   But Rickey Henderson waved at a full-count pitch for the first
out. ``His fastball moved,'' Henderson said. ``It tricked me.''
</P>
<P>
   Edgardo Alfonzo followed with a fly-out to right. ``He threw me
a good pitch, I just missed it,'' Alfonzo said.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Rickey Ledee made a nice, running one-handed catch of a
John Olerud fly to left, and the Mets had wasted a golden chance to
knock out Irabu.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until he made those pitches, it seemed like it was going to be
another barn-burner to me,'' Valentine said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Yankees snatched the lead right back and took the
crowd out of the game in the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``No runs were being scored,'' Brian McRae said. ``There wasn't
a whole lot to get excited about.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It definitely wasn't as exciting as yesterday,'' Henderson
said. ``It was like there was a little burnout.''
</P>
<P>
   But now the Mets can look forward to the second half of the
season, free of the Yankees, finally free of the burden of never
having taken a series from their cross-town rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played them, we're healthy, we got through everything and
we probably don't have to answer any questions about them any
more,'' Valentine said. ``The series is over. You'd like to win the
series. We did. Now we hope we can build on it in the second half
and go to Tampa rested and ready to go.'' &QL;

COMMENTARY: THE SPEECH THAT NEVER WAS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Fate has ordained,'' a saddened president was prepared to say,
``that the men who went to the moon to explore in peace will stay
to rest in peace.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the opening line of a speech to the nation that I
drafted for Richard Nixon 30 years ago this week, as Apollo XI was
about to land on the moon.
</P>
<P>
   NASA's liaison with the White House, the astronaut Frank Borman,
had called me to say ``You want to be thinking of some alternative
posture for the president in the event of mishaps.'' When that
failed to register, he laid it out more plainly: ``Like what to do
for the widows.''
</P>
<P>
   The most dangerous part of the trip was not landing the little
module on the moon, but in launching it back up to the mother ship.
If that failed, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin could not be
rescued. Mission Control would have to ``close down
communications'' and, as the world agonized, let the doomed
astronauts starve to death or commit suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon aides H.R. Haldeman and Peter Flanigan told me to plan for
that tragic contingency. On July 18, 1969, I recommended that ``in
event of moon disaster ... the president should telephone each of
the widows-to-be'' and after NASA cut off contact ``a clergyman
should adopt the same procedure as a burial at sea, commending
their souls to `the deepest of the deep,' concluding with the
Lord's Prayer.'' A draft presidential speech was included.
</P>
<P>
   I haven't thought about that macabre planning for three decades.
Like most adults, I remembered the exhilarating ``MEN WALK ON
MOON'' headline, the phone call of congratulations to
``Tranquillity base'' _ and that historic weekend's dark
counterpoint at Chappaquiddick, which ended the dynastic potential
of the brother of the president who launched the Apollo journey.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, however, Jim Mann of The Los Angeles Times wrote a
piece headed ``The Story of a Tragedy That Was Not to Be.'' He was
digging through the National Archives last year, researching his
book on China policy, ``About Face.'' He found our moon disaster
contingency plan, and published it the week before the anniversary
along with the never-needed speech draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``These brave men, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, know there is
no hope for their recovery,'' the president would have had to say.
``But they also know that there is hope for mankind in their
sacrifice. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``In ancient days, men looked at stars and saw their heroes in
the constellations. In modern times, we do much the same, but our
heroes are epic men of flesh and blood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Others will follow, and surely find their way home. Man's
search will not be denied. But these were the first, and will
remain foremost in our hearts.
</P>
<P>
   ``For every human being who looks up at the moon in the nights
to come will know that there is some corner of another world that
is forever mankind.''
</P>
<P>
   For 17 years afterward, we took space triumph for granted.
Terrible risks were largely ignored _ until the Challenger
spacecraft blew up for all to see in classrooms and living rooms.
</P>
<P>
   No disaster speech was on hand for President Reagan to deliver
in the stunned aftermath. His writer, Peggy Noonan, rose to the
occasion with a moving address written at white heat, concluding
with the words of the sonnet by James Gillespie Magee in farewell
to the courageous crew who ``slipped the surly bonds of earth to
touch the face of God.''
</P>
<P>
   Time and chance happeneth to us all. Armstrong and Aldrin are
alive and well; the third man to walk the moon, Pete Conrad, was
killed last week when, like Lawrence of Arabia, he ran his
motorcycle into a ditch. But the point is not the quirkiness of
Fate: Our charge today is to value the goal of discovery that
drives questing humans to take great risks.
</P>
<P>
   A personal note. At historic moments, speechwriters turn to
poets. The final line of the undelivered salute evoked the cadence
of the patriotic poet Rupert Brooke, who died in the Royal Navy in
World War I:
</P>
<P>
   If I should die, think only this of me:
</P>
<P>
   That there's some corner of a foreign field
</P>
<P>
   That is forever England.
</P>

SENATOR BLOCKING U.N. NOMINATION BLAMES ALBRIGHT

 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A senator who is blocking a final Senate vote on
Richard Holbrooke's nomination to be chief American diplomat at the
United Nations asserted Sunday that Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright was directly responsible for the delay because of her
treatment of a State Department employee described as a
whistle-blower.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, said that Albright ``bears
responsibility for the retaliatory treatment of this
whistle-blower'' and that the secretary ``is the cause of the delay
with regard to my hold on the nomination.''
</P>
<P>
   His statement, which was made public Sunday, appeared to be an
effort to step up the pressure on the State Department to reach a
settlement with the employee, Linda Shenwick, by labeling Albright
as personally responsible for the latest delay in Holbrooke's
confirmation.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, the State Department did not directly address
the question of Ms. Albright's involvement in Ms. Shenwick's case
but criticized senators who are holding up Holbrooke's nominations
``for reasons that have nothing to do with his qualifications.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Shenwick has charged that she was removed from her post at
the American mission to the United Nations because she provided
damaging information about the U.N. to members of Congress and to
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The Department has refused to respond to details of Ms.
Shenwick's accusations, noting that the case is now the subject of
an investigation by the Office of Special Counsel, an independent
federal agency that is supposed to protect whistle-blowers.
</P>
<P>
   Grassley is one of at least four Republican senators who have
exercised their right under arcane Senate rules to place a ``hold''
on Holbrooke's long-stalled nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional officials say that at least two other Republican
senators, Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, and Mitch
McConnell of Kentucky, are blocking a final vote on the nomination
as a bargaining chip to persuade the White House to appoint a
conservative Ohio law professor to the Federal Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate minority leader, Tom Daschle, D-S.D., said Sunday
that Holbrooke ``is being held hostage, and in the worst fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, it's almost an embarrassing fashion right now,'' he
said on the NBC News program ``Meet the Press.'' ``That's got to
end. We've got to fill that position. Let's send an ambassador to
the United Nations. Let's do our job.''
</P>
<P>
   In a separate appearance on the program, Lott said, ``I suspect
that the nomination of Holbrooke to go to the U.N. will be
confirmed.'' But he also acknowledged Grassley's hold on the
process and said that he also expected his favored appointee to the
election commission, Bradley Smith, to be confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Grassley's ``hold'' relates not to Holbrooke's qualifications
but instead to the State Department's treatment of Ms. Shenwick.
</P>
<P>
   ``My position on the Holbrooke nomination remains firm,''
Grassley said. ``The price for lifting the hold is for the
department to negotiate in good faith with Linda Shenwick. The
State Department has a very weak case in refusing to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. George Voinovich, R-Ohio, announced last week that he, too,
had placed a ``hold'' on Holbrooke's nomination because he wanted
to review the veteran diplomat's leading role in the Clinton
administration's Balkans policy.

SPORTS COLUMN: WILL WOMEN ENJOY A LEAGUE OF THEIR OWN? 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The advertisement was up and running in the Sunday
edition of The Los Angeles Times:
</P>
<P>
   ``On Sale Monday: World Soccer Champions and Gold Medalists _
For the First Time Anywhere, Indoors _ All-American Soccer Stars
vs. The World _ Featuring Hamm, Foudy, Overbeck, Akers, Lilly,
Scurry, Chastain, Milbrett, Venturini, Fawcett and More. Dec. 9,
7:05 p.m., Arrowhead Pond, Anaheim.''
</P>
<P>
   They don't waste any time, do they?
</P>
<P>
   America's newest sensations are going back on the road, not as
the national team, but as instant celebrities. They are going out
to strut their stuff the way Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig used to
barnstorm back in the '20s, to make a few extra dollars and take
their game to the hinterlands.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are a cult,'' mused Keith Cooper, the director of
communications for the world soccer body known as FIFA. ``But most
cults take longer to develop than this one.''
</P>
<P>
   The women came from way off the pop-culture map. A month ago,
when I tried to tell colleagues and friends about these American
women, I would be aware of them casting discreet glances at their
watches and shuffling their feet.
</P>
<P>
   Now the American women are hot, but then again, America lives
for temporary diversion and instant gratification _ new pop groups,
new sunglasses, new cars, new Internet stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Did something significant really happen here, or was it a case
of an attractive event coming along during an interlude when
Americans were sated with loutish male basketball and baseball
players?
</P>
<P>
   After years of washing and lugging their own gear, the women are
going to cash in, a little bit, anyway. Now it is up to the people
with the decimal points in their attache cases. Can the Women's
World Cup champions make any real money flexing their smiles and
flashing their abs, or is it the other way around?
</P>
<P>
   These people are not exactly babes in the woods. Do you really
think Brandi Chastain whipped off her game jersey in ``momentary
insanity'' or had she contemplated the potential of displaying a
little more of the best-buffed body on the team?
</P>
<P>
   What is the near future for these women? On Sunday morning I
consulted an expert, Marla Messing, the chief executive officer of
this World Cup, who put 658,000 fannies in seats by going out and
pitching to the established recreation leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Some positive thinkers have linked Mia-mania and
Brandi-tipsiness with the dawning of a new age of women's sports,
but Messing, ever the businesswoman and lawyer, was somewhat
cautious.
</P>
<P>
   Messing was quite positive that Americans would follow
qualifying rounds for the next Women's World Cup in 2003, might
even travel to Australia, the presumed host.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope we have demonstrated this is a legitimate sport,''
Messing said. ``The handlers must care about it. Australia doesn't
have to accomplish what we accomplished, but I think people care
about authentic sports at the highest level _ women playing for
pride, playing their hearts out. That's how I would market this
event.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the U.S., we had young women really connecting, this was a
celebration of the female athlete, but we never tried to exclude
anybody. We went after male fans. So much has been written about
sex appeal, but there are beautiful women all over the place. If
they were not great athletes, nobody would care.''
</P>
<P>
   Messing was cautious about prospects for some kind of women's
league. Citing ``growing pains'' of major-league soccer, struggling
along in its fourth year, Messing said ``the real legacy'' of the
1994 men's World Cup was ``interest in the World Cup and the men's
national program.''
</P>
<P>
   Could there be a women's league by 2001? Messing said: ``I
haven't had time to think about the league but I look at baseball,
basketball, hockey, and I don't think we can put a league that
looks anything like that. We need a new model. I don't know what
that model would look like.''
</P>
<P>
   Messing has been saying that ``hundreds of thousands of girls''
would register for soccer leagues this fall, because ``They want to
be like Mia Hamm and Julie Foudy and play in a Women's World Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   While waiting to close the books on this adventure, Messing said
she has ``no plans.'' She added, ``I have two children and I owe it
to them and my husband to be around for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   The American women are making their own plans _ unofficial
barnstorming, a national overseas tour next year, trying to squeeze
20 world champions onto an 18-player roster for the 2000 Summer
Games in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   If Michelle Akers did not suffer from chronic fatigue syndrome,
I would not offer her gratuitous advice about quitting on top. It
might, however, be time for her to stop pounding herself into
fences, goal posts, other players and the turf, start taking
medicine, and enjoy life as the greatest female player in the
game's history.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese will be back. Next time, I hope ABC does better with
camera angles and pays more attention to foreign athletes who were,
essentially, co-champions.
</P>
<P>
   The American women have earned their place not only in our
memories and hearts, but also on our television screens, our
magazines, our Web sites and mostly our stadiums. They thrilled us,
they entertained us, and they respected their audience, too.
</P>
<P>
   Women's soccer is viable for itself, with no apologies. They
have ball skills. They can run for 90, make that 120, minutes. They
are innately good teammates. They have not yet developed the
sophisticated game of the men _ but neither do they have the
cynical fouls and flagrant flops of the men. They are a joy to
watch. They have sensational personalities. I would not mind seeing
a whole lot more of them and their game in the next century.

MET LIFE IS SAID TO BE NEAR DEAL FOR ST. PAUL AUTO AND HOME UNIT 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JOSEPH B. TREASTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Metropolitan Life, one of the country's largest life
insurance companies, is expected to announce Monday that it is
sharply expanding its auto and home insurance subsidiary by buying
a unit of St. Paul Cos., a leading corporate insurer, for more than
$500 million, executives close to the negotiations said.
</P>
<P>
   With the acquisition, the number of cars and homes insured by
Met Life would nearly double, to 4.35 million, analysts estimated.
The deal would also increase the reach of Met Life's auto and home
insurance business from its stronghold in the Northeast to towns
and cities throughout the Midwest and parts of the South.
</P>
<P>
   The deal would be the first of several that Met Life executives
have previously said they intended to make in a bid to catapult
their company into the top ranks of the auto and home insurance
business, thrusting it into head-to-head competition with such
giants as Allstate, State Farm, Progressive and Geico. If the St.
Paul deal goes through, Met Life would jump from 20th in the field
to about 12th, with annual premium revenues rising to $2.6 billion,
up from $1.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Met Life plans to pay cash for the St. Paul unit. As a mutual
company, owned by its policyholders, Met Life has no stock to use
in acquisitions. But the parent company, which had revenues last
year of $11.5 billion, is in the midst of a reorganization that
will remedy that. An initial public offering is expected early next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the relatively small size of its auto and homeowners
business, Met Life has already developed a reputation for
efficient, low-cost operations. In 1998 the auto and homeowners
unit reported an 18 percent increase in operating earnings to $81.3
million.
</P>
<P>
   For St. Paul, a sale would provide a way out of a line of
business that has been limping along and would enable it to
concentrate on the coverage of corporations and professionals for
which it is best known.
</P>
<P>
   Besides providing broad coverage for some of the nation's
biggest corporations, St. Paul is a leader in medical malpractice
and construction industry coverage. It also does a big business in
liability policies for small banks and municipal governments, as
well as for lawyers and financial specialists like accountants and
for high-tech companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``St. Paul is doing this to sharpen its focus,'' an executive
close to the company said of the Met Life deal. ``The company has
some unique competitive advantages in commercial insurance. It is
going to build on its success rather than invest more in the
personal lines _ auto and homeowners.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Foley, the chief spokesman for Met Life, and David
Monfried, the senior spokesman for St. Paul, said they could not
comment.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when most corporate insurers have been averaging a
return on equity of 5 percent to 8 percent, St. Paul Cos. have been
chalking up a healthy 11 percent return. But the return would have
been better without the auto and homeowners business, which was in
the red last year after a modest gain in 1997. St. Paul executives
forecast at least a modest gain this year.
</P>
<P>
   Weston Hicks, an analyst for J.P. Morgan Securities, said that
in the hands of a specialist in auto and home insurance it was
likely that the St. Paul business could turn a nice profit.
``Specialists in auto insurance have the ability to deliver the
product at lower costs,'' he said.  &QL;

LEDEE ENTERTAINING TEAMMATES BOTH ON AND OFF FIELD 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ricky Ledee innocently exited the bathroom of the
visitors' clubhouse Sunday with toilet paper tucked into the back
of his uniform pants. Ledee walked across the clubhouse, and the
paper unraveled behind him for 20, 30, 40 feet before finally
ripping. As teammates giggled, Ledee was oblivious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he was joking,'' said Chuck Knoblauch, who said the
mishap did not result from a prank. ``But the roll kept going and
going.''
</P>
<P>
   The comical incident was not the only time Ledee provided
entertainment for the New York Yankees on a day when they calmly
defeated the New York Mets, 6-3, and restored some sanity in
Yankeeland. George Steinbrenner would surely have wounded Brian
Cashman's ears with calls if the Mets had completed a stunning
three-game sweep at Shea Stadium, but the Yankees avoided that by
getting production from a position that has been disastrous all
season: left field.
</P>
<P>
   Ledee played the first four innings in left, ripped a three-run
home run and raced in to make a sweet catch, while Chad Curtis
pinch-hit for him in the fifth, belted a two-run single and later
retreated to make a nice over-the-shoulder catch. They combined for
five runs batted in, which, amazingly, is one fewer than Yankee
left fielders mustered in June.
</P>
<P>
   Shane Spencer had snatched the left field job by starting 17 of
his last 18 games, but he was hospitalized with an irregular
heartbeat on July 3 and cannot be activated until Sunday. Even
after Spencer helped fatten the statistics recently, the left
fielders entered Sunday's game with a .210 average, nine homers and
25 RBI. Joe Torre loves riding streaky players, especially in an
unsettled position, so Ledee, now batting .242, might keep himself
in the lineup and keep entertaining the Yankees if he keeps
hitting.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way I go,'' Ledee said. ``I want to prove something
to them. I just have to take it one game at a time. If they give me
the chance to play and start some games, I have to contribute.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it is easy to forget how dynamic Ledee was in the
World Series with six hits in 10 at-bats because he has looked so
lost this season. He failed to win the left field job, was demoted
to Triple A Columbus and then came back and watched Spencer
dominate the position he desperately wants. Sunday, Ledee made an
impression with his power, his speed and his defense and even by
getting perturbed when he was removed from the game. Torre seemed
pleased that the mild-mannered Ledee was angry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could have played nine innings,'' Ledee said.
</P>
<P>
   After Ledee looked feeble while flailing at Orel Hershiser's 1-2
sinker in the second inning, he batted with runners on second and
third in the fourth. Ledee etched a cross in the batter's box with
his bat, as he always does, and told himself to stay relaxed, as he
always does.
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser tried to sneak a first-pitch fastball by Ledee, who
drilled it to right-center field. Roger Cedeno backed up against
the wall and misjudged his leap as Ledee's shot bounced off the top
of the fence and over it to put the Yankees ahead, 3-2. Ledee
pumped both fists three times between second and third after his
second homer in two days and second of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to hit the ball to the right side,'' Ledee said.
``He gave me a pitch that was up. I was real happy with that.''
</P>
<P>
   In the bottom of the fourth, Ledee made Hideki Irabu feel happy
by rushing in from deep left to catch John Olerud's soft liner in
front of his chest for the third out. David Cone raved about how
aggressive Ledee looked in getting a great jump on the ball and
outrunning it to strand two runners and keep the score tied, 3-3.
Ledee looked far different from the seemingly nervous player who
felt for the wall and turned his glove awkwardly while muffing a
fly ball on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was huge,'' Cone said of Ledee's dazzling day.
</P>
<P>
   Ledee lamented how he did not play nine innings as Torre
inserted Curtis against Rigo Beltran in the fifth, with Curtis
slapping a two-run single that boosted the Yankees' cushion to 6-3.
Like Ledee, Curtis was a defensive stalwart in the bottom of the
inning as he looked like a wide receiver while chasing down
Cedeno's deep shot with a man on first to save a run.
</P>
<P>
   ``It surprised me a little bit,'' Curtis said. ``I had to kick
it in at the end to make the play.''
</P>
<P>
   As he departed for his home in Salinas, P.R., for the All-Star
Game break, Ledee was obviously more confident. Two homers in two
games will do that. Ledee quickly said ``yeah'' twice when he was
asked if there was enough time before the July 31 trading deadline
for him to become the regular left fielder. Others agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us have to start somewhere,'' Paul O'Neill said.
``Maybe this is it. I think a lot of people still think that Ricky
can be a big part of our season.''

$4.9 BILLION VERDICT IN GM CASE MAY SPUR OTHER LAWSUITS AGAINST
AUTOMAKER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Fla., Mich.)  (js) 
 By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The $4.9 billion verdict in a personal injury
lawsuit against General Motors on Friday might be only the start of
the company's problems. Lawyers and safety consultants pursuing
similar cases say that corporate documents used as evidence in the
case, many for the first time, could be troublesome for GM in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   The jury here awarded the record-setting damages to six people
who were badly burned when the gas tank of their 1979 Chevrolet
Malibu exploded after the car was rammed from behind by another
vehicle. The six people have pledged to donate half of any punitive
damages they collect after taxes to the state of California to pay
for the care and treatment of burn victims, their lawyer, Brian J.
Panish, said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Central to the case was a 1973 ``value analysis'' written by
Edward C. Ivey, an Oldsmobile engineer who still works for GM, who
calculated that fuel tank fires after accidents were costing the
company $2.40 per vehicle. Plaintiffs in the Los Angeles case had
argued that GM did not design cars more safely because it would
have cost the company more than it was losing in settlements with
accident victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Ivey memo is an economic blueprint for lawyers,'' said
Clarence M. Ditlow, executive director of the Center for Auto
Safety in Washington, a group co-founded by Ralph Nader that is
involved in similar cases. ``It set a cost constraint on how much
GM was willing to put into hardware to prevent a fire that was
otherwise preventable.''
</P>
<P>
   GM argued that its vehicles are safe and that the Ivey memo was
the work of a junior engineer that was never used in car design.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no evidence that any engineer who worked on this
vehicle or any other vehicle at General Motors used the information
in the Ivey document or used that approach in making decisions on
design,'' said Richard W. Shapiro, a Phoenix lawyer who represented
GM in the case that was decided on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the company has long worried about the document and the
perceptions it would cause. ``Obviously, Ivey is not an individual
whom we would ever, in any conceivable situation, want to be
identified to the plaintiffs,'' in a lawsuit, a lawyer hired by GM
wrote after interviewing Ivey in 1981. ``The documents he generated
are undoubtedly some of the potentially most harmful and most
damaging were they ever to be produced.''
</P>
<P>
   GM has mainly succeeded in keeping the Ivey memo from being
introduced as evidence since it first became known to plaintiff's
lawyers in the early 1980s. Last year a judge in Florida threatened
GM with ``very severe sanctions'' if it did not provide that memo
and some related documents. Some of that evidence was in turn used
in the Los Angeles case.
</P>
<P>
   ``As these cases begin cumulatively to give up the documents,
you lose less and win more,'' said Sheldon J. Schlesinger, a lawyer
in Fort Lauderdale who represented the plaintiffs in the Florida
case. In that case, a jury ordered GM to pay $60 million, which was
reduced to $33 million, in a lawsuit related to a fuel tank fire in
a 1983 Oldsmobile Cutlass station wagon that killed two people and
burned four others.
</P>
<P>
   In the Los Angeles case, the jury in Superior Court of Los
Angeles County awarded Patricia Anderson, her four children and a
family friend, Jo Tigner, $107.6 million in compensatory damages
and $4.8 billion in punitive damages after their Malibu, stopping
for a red light, was rammed by a drunken driver on Christmas Eve
1993.
</P>
<P>
   The award is the largest ever in a personal injury lawsuit, said
Thomas F. Harrison, publisher of Lawyers Weekly USA, a newspaper
published in Boston that tracks such awards. He said the previous
largest was $1.24 billion awarded in January by a jury in Wisconsin
to the estate of a woman who had died from a fuel-related fire
after a go-cart accident at a Florida amusement park.
</P>
<P>
   GM said it was confident that Friday's decision would be
overturned on appeal, and legal experts said it was highly likely
that the award would, at the least, be significantly reduced.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Shapiro, the lawyer for GM, said the Los Angeles case might not
have much influence on other cases because other judges could have
different views on what evidence is admissible. He contended that
the Los Angeles judge, Ernest G. Williams, did not allow the
company to present evidence showing that cars with the same body as
the 1979 Malibu had explosions only once in every 23.5 billion
miles.
</P>
<P>
   Panish, the main lawyer for the plaintiffs in Los Angeles, said
there were dozens of other cases involving GM cars with designs
similar to the 1979 Malibu's, with the fuel tank close to the rear
bumper, an estimate GM called exceedingly high. The company said
that the Los Angeles and Florida cases were the only ones it has
lost involving such cars and that the Florida plaintiffs were not
awarded punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Rhadigan, a company spokesman, said the fuel tank was
moved forward around 1984. He said that the placement of the fuel
tank behind the rear axle had been common in the industry before
that time and that the change was made for overall design reasons,
not because the design had been unsafe.
</P>
<P>
   There are about 50 cases pending against GM resulting from fires
on pre-1988 GM pickup trucks in which the fuel tanks were mounted
outside the frame on the side of the vehicles, said Ditlow of the
Center for Auto Safety.
</P>
<P>
   News of the huge verdict could prompt more people to sue for
older accidents.
</P>
<P>
   Linda McOscar said she and her three children were sitting in a
1980 Malibu beside a highway in South Texas in June 1980, when
their car was rammed from behind by a truck driven by a drunken
driver. The Malibu spun around and caught fire. Mrs. McOscar
managed to crawl through a window, pulling her 10-year-old son,
Spencer, who was in the front passenger seat, out with her. But
13-year-old Joey and 13-month-old Hillary, who were in the back
seat, were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. McOscar, of Monroe, Mich., said that when she heard about
the Los Angeles verdict on the news, ``It just blew my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept waking up in the night thinking in 1973 they knew there
was a defect,'' she said. Although she and her husband received
about $55,000 from GM in a settlement, they say they are thinking
about suing based on the new evidence.
</P>
<P>
   GM in the early 1980s hired six law firms to scour its records
to find documents that could be damaging in such cases. These
lawyers have been nicknamed the ``fire babies'' by plaintiffs'
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   One such document is the Ivey memo, only one-and-a-half pages
long. It estimates how many fatalities there were from
post-accident fuel related fires and assumes a value of $200,000
per fatality. By dividing by the number of GM cars on the road,
Ivey came up with an estimate of the cost to GM of $2.40 per
vehicle. But Ivey also cautioned that ``it is really impossible to
put a value on human life'' and that ``a human fatality is beyond
value, subjectively.''
</P>
<P>
   The memo does not say why the analysis was done. In depositions
in this and previous cases, Ivey has said he could not remember
anyone asking him to do the study and does not believe it was
distributed.
</P>
<P>
   But the lawyer's interview with Ivey in 1981 seems to contradict
that position. According to the report by the lawyer, who worked
for a firm hired by GM, Ivey did not specifically recall being
asked to do the analysis but said he thought he had been asked by a
superior to help in ``trying to figure out how much Olds could
spend on fuel systems.'' Ivey also said it was probably distributed
to several people, though he did not know if it had ever been used.
</P>
<P>
   Some other GM memos presented at the trial showed that
cost-benefit analysis was also used on safety questions. In a 1974
memo, a GM official named R.G. Fischer performed a calculation
similar to Ivey's and concluded that GM ``could spend'' $2 a car
``effectively for rear impact protection.'' A Jan. 1, 1973, memo
said that ``cost/safety benefit is to be evaluated before releasing
components'' for performance that exceeds federal requirements for
fuel system integrity.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was literally an 18-year coverup, and the jurors were
outraged,'' said Mark Robinson Jr., one of the lawyers for the
plaintiffs, who said the evidence in the Los Angeles case was
stronger than the one two decades ago when he won a big award for
fuel tank fire in a Ford Pinto _ $128 million in punitive and
compensatory damages, which was later reduced to $7 million.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman Thorton, the foreman of the Los Angeles jury, said in an
interview that the Ivey memo had been just one factor in the
verdict. More important, he said, was that Ivey, who testified
through a videotaped deposition, and other GM officials appeared to
be evasive.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who were well-qualified are not supposed to have
instant amnesia,'' Thorton, a retired custodian, said. ``That is
the way that most of the witnesses for the defendant reacted.''

BAFFERT COMPLETES SWEEP AS FORESTRY WINS DWYER 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELMONT, N.Y. _ Bob Baffert opened the second half of the racing
season on Sunday by completing a sweep of stakes for 3-year-olds in
the East: On the day after his filly Silverbulletday won the
Monmouth Oaks, Baffert won the Dwyer at Belmont Park with his
newest star colt, Forestry.
</P>
<P>
   Forestry is a son of Storm Cat who was bought for Aaron Jones at
the Keeneland auction sale two years ago for $1.5 million, and he
has taken long strides toward redeeming his cost. He won Sunday for
the fifth straight time, outrunning Doneraile Court by 2\ lengths,
and he ran his record to six victories in eight starts with one
second and one third.
</P>
<P>
   He did not race at all last year at 2, and he was too small to
try crowding into the Triple Crown races at 3. Besides, Baffert had
more horses for the Kentucky Derby than he knew what to do with, so
he bided his time with Forestry. Now Forestry has grown to full
stature and has not lost since February.
</P>
<P>
   He also provided his California trainer with his first success
at a New York track after nine setbacks, including the last-gasp
loss of the Belmont Stakes two years in a row with the Triple Crown
on the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I picked the right day to do it,'' Baffert said. ``But
that's something that doesn't bother me.''
</P>
<P>
   Something that does bother him, though, is where to align his
stable of stars. For now he is thinking roughly in these
directions: General Challenge, who ran 11th in the Kentucky Derby,
will start in the Swaps Stakes at Santa Anita next Sunday;
Silverbulletday is 50-50 to return to Monmouth on Aug. 8 for the $1
million Haskell, and Forestry might make it the same day at
Saratoga in the $300,000 Jim Dandy and then return on Aug. 28 for
the $1 million Travers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was due for something like that,'' Baffert said after
Forestry's victory. ``We paid a lot of money for him. He'll go back
to Churchill Downs tomorrow with Silverbulletday, then we'll decide
what we're going to do. A lot depends on what happens next week
with General Challenge. I've got a lot of thinking to do, a lot of
juggling.''
</P>
<P>
   In the paddock after he was saddled, Forestry reared before
Jerry Bailey approached to mount him, and it took three stablehands
plus Baffert to quiet the colt. But to his trainer, these were all
plus marks on the horse's personality chart.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got scared by something,'' Baffert said. ``But he's a good,
tough horse. If I had tried to run him in the classics earlier this
year, I would have ruined him. But he has a lot of heart. He's
wild.
</P>
<P>
   ``They ran fast fractions, and I got a little worried when I saw
they ran three-quarters in 1:08 2/5. We'll have to see how much
energy these races took out of all of them.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason Forestry went so fast so early was because Nick
Zito's Doneraile Court leapt into the lead and shot the first
half-mile in 44 4/5 seconds. But Bailey took the long view aboard
Forestry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided to sit back and wait,'' he said. ``I thought
Doneraile Court was the horse to beat, and he was moving pretty
quick up front. I made my move on the turn, and my horse just went
by with ease. This is a lightly raced horse, and he's got talent.''
</P>
<P>
   Forestry ran the mile and one-sixteenth in 1:41, returned $4 for
a $2 bet to win and added $90,000 to his bankroll, which still has
a long way to go _ about $1.2 million _ to earn back what was paid
for him.
</P>
<P>
   For Baffert there are also nagging problems, like the
quarter-cut in Silverbulletday's right front foot, which she
reopened during the Monmouth Oaks. But for now, he was playing his
cards like a man holding four aces, with lots of money waiting in
the pot.

SETTING INTO MOTION A BATTLE OF UNBEATENS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Oscar De La Hoya and Felix Trinidad, who meet in
September, might've started something good.
</P>
<P>
   Young champions David Reid and Fernando Vargas are busy this
weekend. Reid makes the first defense of his WBA super welterweight
title against unknown Kevin Kelly on Friday in Atlantic City, N.J.,
while Vargas defends his IBF junior middleweight championship
against former champ Raul Marquez on Saturday in Lake Tahoe.
</P>
<P>
   However, it's difficult not to take a peak into the future.
</P>
<P>
   Reid and Vargas, Olympic teammates in 1996, say they plan to
meet in the ring sometime early next year in a bout that follows
the lead of De La Hoya-Trinidad: two undefeated young champions
willing to risk it all to prove their superiority.
</P>
<P>
   Such a bout is particularly significant because the sport had
come to a near standstill for lack of compelling matchups the past
few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're calling it the fight of the new millennium,'' said Dan
Goossen of America Presents, Reid's promoter.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the day of the megafights. This is what the public
wants, what the promoters want, what the fighters want.''
</P>
<P>
   A lot has to happen in the meantime.
</P>
<P>
   After he beats Kelly, an Australian with questionable
credentials, Reid (12-0, with seven knockouts) expects to fight
former champ Keith Mullings late next month and resilient,
once-beaten veteran Davey Hilton in November or December.
</P>
<P>
   Vargas (16-0, 16 KOs) will probably have no trouble with
Marquez. After that, he plans to take a huge risk by fighting Ike
Quartey and then possibly another opponent before he and Reid meet.
</P>
<P>
   The fighters, trying to focus on the present, don't really want
to talk about the fight.
</P>
<P>
   However, they're asked about it constantly.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the fight everyone wants to see,'' Reid said. ``And I
want that fight for myself. I want it to happen, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``To become the fighter I want to be, I need fights like
Fernando, Oscar, Trinidad. Then I can be the superstar I want to
be.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Vargas: ``That's a big fight, an event. I'm trying to unify
this division. That's what I want to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``David Reid is a tough fighter. I have a lot of respect for
him. We hung out together at the (1996) Games. I have to take care
of business, though.''
</P>
<P>
   Let's hope it's not just talk.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to envision the winner of that fight taking on the
winner of De La Hoya-Trinidad or be in position to face one of the
two in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   The possibilities are intriguing.
</P>
<P>
   Comparison: America Presents publicist Fred Sternburg put
together a comparison of the fighters who Reid and Vargas, as well
as De La Hoya, faced en route to their first titles.
</P>
<P>
   Reid's 12 opponents were 310-45-5, with 212 KOs. Vargas' 15
opponents were 215-74-11, 139 KOs. De la Hoya's 12 opponents were
198-54-18, 93 KOs.
</P>
<P>
   However, don't put too much credence in those numbers. Two of
Reid's most significant opponents _ Jorge Vaca (57-18-1, 48 KOs)
and Simon Brown (47-7, 34 KOs) _ were well past their primes at the
time they met.
</P>
<P>
   For what it's worth, Vargas had the toughest opponent in his
first title fight _ Yory Boy Campas. Reid beat Frenchman Laurent
Boudouani, while De La Hoya defeated marginal Jimmi Bredhal.
</P>
<P>
   Mosley watch: Shane Mosley, who gave up his lightweight
championship and has moved up two weight classes to 147, is
negotiating to fight Wilfredo Rivera, whom De La Hoya once knocked
out.
</P>
<P>
   Mosley wants De La Hoya and the money that goes with him.
However, De La Hoya has said the Trinidad bout will be his last at
147. That would mean Mosley would have to move up to 154, an
unlikely scenario for now.
</P>
<P>
   Mosley, who is from Pomona but trains in Los Angeles, would like
to fight on the first-ever boxing card at the new Staples Center in
December.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya is expected to challenge for his first 154-pound
title against WBC super welterweight champion Javier Castillejo in
the main event.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson's comeback: Mike Tyson's handlers have yet to name an
opponent for his Oct. 2 fight at the MGM in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Axel Schulz, considered the favorite at one time, is out after
agreeing to another fight. Among those in the running are Jorge
Luis Gonzalez, Zeljko Mavrovic and Orlin Norris.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson could have trouble with Mavrovic, a big, durable fighter
who gave Lennox Lewis problems. Norris, a small heavyweight, is
made to order for the smallish Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   Poor Vernon: Some people believe the best of the
welterweight/junior middleweight bunch will ultimately be
undefeated NABF welterweight champion Vernon Forrest.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is no one seems to want to fight him. Forrest (29-0,
24 KOs) was turned down by at least seven prospective opponents
before Santiago Samaniego (27-4-1, 23 KOs) _ a nephew of Roberto
Duran _ agreed to meet him Aug. 27 in Augusta, Ga., according to
Main Events, Forrest's promoter.
</P>
<P>
   Forrest will get his chance against the best.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbit punches: The Ruelas brothers, Gabriel and Rafael, could
fight as soon as early August, according to America Presents
officials. Their opponents are yet to be determined, although
former lightweight champion Tom Johnson is being mentioned as a
possible opponent for Gabriel Ruelas.... Mauricio Martinez defends
his NABO bantamweight title against Cruz Acosta tonight at the
Pond.... WBA welterweight champion James Page defends his
championship against Freddie Pendleton on July 24 in Las Vegas.
Also on the card, which will be televised on Showtime, Terronn
Millett defends his IBF super lightweight championship against
Virgil McClendon.... The bout between WBO featherweight champion
Naseem Hamed and WBC champ Cesar Soto probably will be moved from
Oct. 2 _ the night of the Tyson fight _ to Nov. 6. Juan Manuel
Marquez, the WBO's mandatory challenger whom Hamed has managed to
avoid, could end up frustrated once again: He's ranked No. 1 by the
WBC. If Hamed beats Soto, will he continue to dodge Marquez? Let's
hope the WBC doesn't let it happen.

WHY DEAL WITH MEDIA WHEN YOU HAVE YOUR SITE SET?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Fixing third graph, corrects Anderson's high school) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ On the sports-talk radio shows in Atlanta last
week, Falcons running back Jamaal Anderson took a beating.
</P>
<P>
   He skipped the team's three-day mini camp, holding out as he
tries to get a new contract. His agent, Jim Sims, and Falcons coach
and executive vice president Dan Reeves have been explaining their
sides to the media. Reeves issued a deadline of July 28, the
opening of training camp.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's response? Instead of answering back or talking to the
media, the former El Camino Real High star has stayed home in Salt
Lake City and did his talking on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   He has read the e-mail and message boards from fans who use his
Web site at Athlete's Direct. And he has directly responded to
those who think he's demanding too much of a signing bonus and
acting selfishly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is Jamaal selfish? No,'' Anderson wrote, proving he can not
only talk in the third person but write in it as well. ``If I was,
believe me, I would have been using the Super Bowl or the NFC
championship as a stage to air my contract concerns. What better
place to get people to listen?
</P>
<P>
   ``Folks, the point is I did not create a market for running
backs. I just know I belong with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson wrote that the only signing bonus he has ever received
was $23,000 as a seventh-round pick in 1993. He's trying to get a
$10 million signing bonus this time after leading the NFC with
1,846 yards rushing and 14 touchdowns last year.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson also defended his absence from training camp by saying
he expected to have a new contract.
</P>
<P>
   Agree? The e-mail box is always open.
</P>
<P>
   _If Fox doesn't have enough gadgetry for Tuesday's Major League
Baseball All-Star Game, there will be access to a ``Diamond Cam,''
a live telerobotic camera located behind home plate on baseball's
official Web site ( www.majorleaguebaseball.com ).
</P>
<P>
   _The Angels upgraded their Web site ( www.angelsbaseball.com )
with new technology by Pixelon.com that improves game highlight
video to full-screen TV-like production. It's the first time a
major sports team has offered this technology on their site.

MURDER SUSPECTS MAY BE LINKED TO SUPREMACISTS, POLICE SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Ind.)  (mk) 
 By EVELYN NIEVES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The two brothers, say neighbors, are
nature-loving organic gardeners, meek, respectful sorts raised by
stern, religious parents in a small farm town.
</P>
<P>
   But the authorities say that the two men, Benjamin Matthew
Williams, 31, and James Tyler Williams, 29, most recently of
Redding, Calif., may be part of a growing national white
supremacist movement that spawned a student's recent shooting
rampage in Illinois and Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the Williams brothers were arrested in connection
with the shotgun slayings of a gay couple on July 1 in a rural area
near Redding, and the authorities say they have evidence that links
the brothers with the arson fires of three synagogues on June 18 in
Sacramento. Local authorities say they are also looking into any
possible connection between the brothers and the shotgun death of
an elderly man on June 20 in his cottage, three miles from where
the gay couple were shot to death in the bedroom of their mobile
home.
</P>
<P>
   A federal task force is looking into the possibility that the
brothers are part of the World Church of the Creator, based in East
Peoria, Ill., which preaches white supremacy and hatred of blacks,
Jews, Asians and gay people. Benjamin Nathaniel Smith, 21, whose
shooting attack over the Fourth of July weekend in Illinois and
Indiana ended with two people dead and nine injured before he
killed himself, had been a member of the organization. Tracts from
the group were found among the Williams brothers' possessions.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are also looking into whether the killings in
Redding, the arson fires in Sacramento and the killings in Illinois
and Indiana were all part of a deliberately timed hate-crime
outbreak, said Nick Rossi, a spokesman for the FBI in Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   The Williams brothers were arrested in Yuba City, about 100
miles south of Redding, when they tried to collect from a private
postal service a package that had been ordered with one of the gay
couple's credit cards. Both brothers had 9-mm handguns, and one was
wearing a bulletproof vest. A stash of weapons was found in their
car.
</P>
<P>
   They were charged with possession of stolen goods, and they
remain in the Shasta County Jail.
</P>
<P>
   Besides hate tracts, a notebook naming 32 people who had been
quoted in media reports after the synagogue fires was also found.
Capt. Ron Richardson of the Shasta County Sheriff's Department said
Sunday that investigators were analyzing other evidence potentially
linking the brothers to the fires and the killings near Redding.
Results that could lead to additional charges, including murder,
are expected in a few days, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The brothers, who had started a landscaping business in Redding,
were raised in Gridley, about 18 miles north of Yuba City and 60
miles north of Sacramento. They were taught at home until high
school by their mother, Sally. Their father, Ben, worked for the
U.S. Forest Service. Former neighbors described the family as
polite and religious, with both the father and the brothers prone
to preaching as they took walks.
</P>
<P>
   Tyler Williams _ the brothers are known by their middle names _
still lives with his parents. Matthew Williams had recently moved
to a rental house not far away, where investigators were seen on
Saturday removing bags of possible evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Both brothers knew the slain men, Gary Matson, 50, and Winfield
Mowder, 40, said Richardson. Matson and Mowder had started a
children's nature museum and founded a farmer's market in Redding
where the brothers rented a booth.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had a lot in common,'' Richardson said. ``They all grew
things.''

   Commercekey, an Internet start-up, has come up with a business
plan with a new wrinkle in the crowded electronic commerce market.
In addition to peddling software and transaction services to help
businesses set up shop on the Web, the company, with roots in the
Greek shipping industry, has its own world-class fleet of cargo
vessels standing by to deliver customers' merchandise around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which is based in New York and plans to announce
itself later this week, is a joint venture between two Greek
industrial giants, Vardinoyannis Group of Cos. and Leventis Group.
Together, the two companies give Commercekey access to a huge fleet
of freighters along with a network of climate-controlled warehouses
throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
   Owning its own fleet of vessels could help Commercekey clear one
of the big hurdles in electronic commerce: distribution.
</P>
<P>
   ``We come from a tradition of merchants and bottlers,'' said
Alkiviades David, president and chief executive of Commercekey,
whose family has a major stake in Leventis.
</P>
<P>
   Vardinoyannis owns the biggest oil refinery in Greece, Motor Oil
Hellas, along with numerous television stations, newspapers and
Internet service providers. Leventis, meanwhile, is Greece's
primary Coca-Cola distributor and also owns an Internet
telecommunications network in Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   David and Demosthenes Vardinoyannis, Commercekey's chairman, met
while they were in high school in Switzerland many years ago. The
idea for Commercekey grew, in part, out of a video conferencing
venture David had started years ago; that technology has become a
component of Commercekey's service offerings.
</P>
<P>
   Together the two companies have invested an initial $12.5
million in the U.S. arm of Commercekey, and they plan to take the
company public early next year.

   High Technology for Money Management
</P>
<P>
   You may not be a Silicon Valley gazillionaire, but here is your
chance to manage your money like one.
</P>
<P>
   James H. Clark, the entrepreneurial engineer behind Silicon
Graphics, Netscape and, most recently, Healtheon, has quietly
embarked on his fourth start-up. It's a company focused on
simplifying the financial affairs of wealthy individuals _ or
anybody else willing to pay for the service.
</P>
<P>
   The venture, called MyCFO, grew out of Clark's own need for a
personal chief financial officer to handle his affairs and track
his investments. ``It was totally out of control,'' said Clark,
whose net worth is an estimated $500 million. (Tax time was
particularly difficult, he said.)
</P>
<P>
   So about two years ago, Clark hired Harvey Armstrong, a former
KPMG manager, who came up with a Web-based system that supplies
Clark and his various financial consultants with access to all of
Clark's financial records. Late last year they decided to found a
company on the concept.
</P>
<P>
   MyCFO (www.mycfo.com), whose clients include John Chambers,
chief executive of Cisco Systems, already has some 20 employees,
including four financial managers, and offices across the street
from the Silicon Graphics headquarters in Mountain View, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   With all his recent successes, including the recent $5.5 billion
merger of Healtheon with another online health information service,
WebMD, Clark appears to have had no trouble finding investors. The
list includes Chambers, the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins
Caufield &AMP; Byers, and Thomas Jermoluk, chairman and chief executive
of Excite(AT)Home.
</P>
<P>
   Clark is acting chief executive and chairman of the company,
while Armstrong is acting president, although Clark hopes to hire
an outsider to be chief executive and president by the fall. At
that point, Armstrong would become the lead financial consultant
for MyCFO.

   Wrestling Games Trounce All Comers on Video
</P>
<P>
   Can the professional wrestler Stone Cold Steve Austin trounce
those intergalactic ``Star Wars'' heroes wielding light sabers? Yes
_ at least in the world of video games.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of wrestling-related video games from January through May
increased by 23 percent, to $60 million, over the comparable period
last year, according to NPD Group, a Port Washington, N.Y.,
research group. That increase outpaced the growth of video-game
sales generally, which grew 14 percent, to $1.9 billion during the
same period.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite the launch of `Star Wars' in May, wrestling-related
merchandise will likely be among the industry's best sellers when
final numbers are released at year end,'' said Ed Roth, president
of NPD Leisure Activities, a Glen Cove, N.Y., research firm.
</P>
<P>
   Liz Bell, a publicist for THQ Inc., said wrestling-related video
games ``have been frighteningly successful.'' THQ publishes three
of this year's best-selling titles: ``WCW/NWO Thunder'' for Sony's
Playstation, the top wrestling title; ``WCW/NWO Revenge'' for
Nintendo 64; and ``WCW Nitro'' for Nintendo, Playstation and PCs.
</P>
<P>
   Austin is the featured character in ``WWF War Zone'' by Acclaim,
one of the year's best-selling titles.
</P>
<P>
   If the strong pace of sales keeps up, few wrestlers may be
tempted to follow the path of their former colleague Jesse ``the
Body'' Ventura into the political arena. Who needs the governor's
mansion, when there's a shot at becoming a lead character in a
Playstation title?

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, July 12:
</P>
<P>
   Only a few years ago, the idea of Congress and the president
wrangling over a trillion-dollar budget surplus would have provoked
disbelief. But it turns out that the new era of surpluses is just
as contentious as the old era of deficits.
</P>
<P>
   As Congress returns to work on Monday, House Republicans are
preparing a tax cut so large it would use up virtually all of the
surplus for 10 years, leaving no money to make Medicare solvent or
to avoid deeper domestic cuts. The likelihood that President
Clinton would veto an outsized tax cut is only spurring them on.
Lawmakers seem to favor slogans over solutions.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no reason to rule out progress this year on
critical issues, including the urgent problem of ensuring that the
baby-boom generation has adequate health care in its retirement
years. A little clear thinking will help everyone establish
priorities at a time when there is enough money to address them.
</P>
<P>
   Some gains have already been achieved. The Congressional Budget
Office projects a surplus of nearly $2.9 trillion in the next 10
years, and Democrats and Republicans agree in principle that the
$1.9 trillion generated by Social Security taxes should go back
into that system to keep it solvent well into the next century. The
fight is over the remaining $1 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   If Americans want to use that money for tax cuts, they need to
know the consequences. The surplus rests on the assumption that
Congress and the White House will carry out previously targeted
spending cuts. No one thinks that will happen.
</P>
<P>
   The budget ceilings for this year, enacted in 1997, call for
cuts that the Republican chairmen of the various appropriations
committees already say are unrealistic. But the same 1997 law
requires even more cuts in future years.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when Gov. George W. Bush is getting much applause for
his brand of ``compassionate conservatism,'' Republicans in
Congress should think twice about more cuts in health, job
training, environmental programs and research in science and
medicine.
</P>
<P>
   A more realistic approach would set aside a substantial part of
the surplus to sustain current domestic spending and perhaps expand
it in certain areas.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also wants to set aside another chunk for Medicare,
where Republicans might have some incentive to agree. After the
1995 budget shutdowns, they should realize that the public punishes
them every time they try to pay for tax cuts by trimming Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   It may be unrealistic to expect agreement on a specific plan to
revamp Medicare, although Clinton's proposal to pay for
prescription drugs has found some Republican support. But it is not
unrealistic to set aside money for the job out of the surplus.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for sequestering the money now is simple. If
Republicans persist in cutting taxes deeply, the long-term
consequences will be severe. It took 15 years of tax increases and
budget cuts to overcome the deficits created by President Ronald
Reagan's tax reductions in 1981. It makes no sense to repeat that
pattern.
</P>
<P>
   As for the 10-year $864 billion tax-cut scheme that Bill Archer,
chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, plans to push, one
wonders what the rationale could be. With the Federal Reserve Board
raising interest rates for fear of an overheated economy, no
stimulus is needed. It is perverse to cut taxes for those who have
benefited most from the current boom.
</P>
<P>
   Any scenario for constructive engagement on the budget must
start with negotiations in the weeks ahead. The best chance for
success would come if Republicans came to their budget senses early
and designed a more realistic scheme for the next 10 years. A
signal from Bush, the party's new favorite son, might help. A
trillion-dollar budget agreement would be better for everyone than
a trillion-dollar breakdown.

GIULIANI REITERATES OPPOSITION TO OUTSIDE OVERSIGHT OF POLICE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Reacting to an investigation by federal prosecutors
that found widespread problems in the way the New York City Police
Department handles brutality complaints, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
said Sunday that he would never agree to a federal monitor or other
outside oversight of the department.
</P>
<P>
   ``My administration never compromises on matters of principle,''
Giuliani replied tersely when asked whether he had considered
changing his position. The mayor has long opposed outside
supervision of the police and has twice vetoed city council
legislation to create an independent monitoring board.
</P>
<P>
   If the city does not agree to changes sought by the U.S.
attorney in Brooklyn, Zachary W. Carter, who directed the nearly
two-year inquiry into the Police Department, the Justice Department
may sue the city to seek a court-ordered overhaul and perhaps the
appointment of a monitor.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani declined Sunday to discuss negotiations between his
administration and Carter's office. Carter is due to leave his post
for private practice at the end of this week and, according to some
aides, would like to reach an agreement with the city before his
departure, but it remains unclear what steps by the city might
satisfy him.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal rules governing investigations of local police
departments, Carter must present the findings of his inquiry to the
city and seek a resolution before the Justice Department files
suit. Carter so far has declined to make public any specific
conclusions of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Carter's office, William Muller, said Sunday
that he would not comment on what specific issues are the subject
of negotiations. At City Hall, the matter is being handled chiefly
by Michael D. Hess, the city's corporation counsel.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor, who held his daily news conference Sunday at Shea
Stadium before attending the Yankees-Mets game, repeated his
assertions that criticism of the Police Department is politically
motivated. And he reiterated his staunch defense of the city's
police officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The New York City Police Department is the most restrained
large-city police department in the country,'' Giuliani said,
invoking what has become almost a mantra for him since the fatal
shooting of Amadou Diallo, an unarmed immigrant, by four police
officers in February.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although the Justice Department has a role in investigating
police departments,'' the mayor said, ``New Yorkers have certainly
the right to ask, `What about all the other cities where police
officers shoot people two, three, four, five times per capita more
than in New York City?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani praised the Police Department's ability to control
large crowds, and offered the handling of the blackout in northern
Manhattan last week as the latest example of the department's
improved relations with the community and its success in preventing
crime.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``I think the bashing of the NYPD has been relentless for about
four or five months,'' Giuliani said. ``What I'd like to focus on
this weekend is for the city to sit back and say maybe the bashing
has gone too far, when you can have the lights go out in a major
urban area that used to lead the Northeast in homicides five or six
years ago, was a major drug center, and the lights can go out for
18 to 30 hours and you can have virtually no violence during that
period of time, you can have 1,500 police officers there, no
incidents other than cooperation. Maybe, just maybe, the New York
City Police Department is doing something right and the bashing has
created a wrong perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Giuliani rejected the majority of recommendations
made by a task force he appointed to explore ways of improving
relations between the police and residents. Among the
recommendations rejected by the mayor was the proposal for an
auditor to monitor the Civilian Complaint Review Board, which has
the power to investigate brutality complaints but no power to
discipline officers.
</P>
<P>
   The Review Board, whose 13 members are appointed by the mayor,
has been widely criticized as ineffective.

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Monday, July 12:
</P>
<P>
   With a well-calculated guess, American goalkeeper Briana Scurry
lunged left, blocking a penalty kick from China's Liu Ying. Moments
later, Brandi Chastain's left-footed penalty kick curved past
Chinese goalie Gao Hong, into the high right corner of the goal.
Scurry's save and Chastain's goal on Saturday gave the American
women's soccer team the edge in a thrilling if arbitrary ending to
a scoreless game, as well as their second World Cup championship in
this decade.
</P>
<P>
   The effervescent Chastain fell to her knees, fists clenched in
victory, and the sellout crowd of 90,185 fans in Pasadena's Rose
Bowl stood as one to cheer this remarkable team and the lift they
have given to women athletes everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   These two well-matched teams played ferocious defense,
neutralizing two of the most prolific scorers in the game,
America's Mia Hamm and China's Sun Wen. Two hours of soccer _ 90
minutes of regulation and two 15-minute overtimes _ produced
exquisite ball control and teamwork but few scoring chances. One of
these chances, however, nearly ended the game in China's favor.
</P>
<P>
   In the 10th minute of overtime, Kristine Lilly, a superb two-way
player, headed an almost certain goal out of the net after the ball
sailed over Scurry. Lilly, Scurry and Chastain were not the only
heroes. As expected, Michelle Akers, the great warrior of women's
soccer, anchored the midfield with courage and skill until heat
exhaustion drove her to the sidelines in the game's 90th minute.
</P>
<P>
   This was yet another glorious moment for a team that has had a
sparkling run in the 1990s, including the 1996 Olympic gold medal.
These players have taken women's sports to a new level of
prominence, and in time the excitement they have generated may lead
to formation of a women's professional league. But for the moment
it is enough to savor an unforgettable portrait of determination
and grace.

CAREER YEARS IS OLIVARES' ONLY FOCUS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Pitcher Omar Olivares has been the Anaheim Angels' most
consistent starter this season. He's the only starter with a
winning record (8-6), the only starter with a complete game (two)
and ranks seventh in the league in ERA (3.28).
</P>
<P>
   He also happens to be in the final year of a contract that is
paying him $1.6 million this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to stay here,'' said Olivares, who joined the Angels
in 1998. ``I like it here a lot. But you know how business is.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Olivares is having a career year, he says he can't
allow himself to think about his contract situation during the
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really not thinking about it or worrying about it,'' he
said. ``I've got to focus on pitching right now, and what I've got
to do. I don't want to think about anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though he's been pitching professionally since 1987,
Olivares is just 31. He's been all over the big leagues, playing
for St. Louis, Colorado, Philadelphia, Detroit and Seattle before
coming to Anaheim. He also pitches for Puerto Rico in the Winter
League each year.
</P>
<P>
   Rotation set: Manager Terry Collins has decided on his rotation
coming out of the All-Star break for the team's six-game homestand.
Chuck Finley will start Thursday against the Dodgers, followed by
Olivares and Steve Sparks. The Dodgers' starters in the series will
be Kevin Brown, Ismael Valdes and Chan Ho Park.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels will face San Diego for a three-game series starting
Sunday. Mike Fyhrie will open the series for the Angels, followed
by Ken Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Glaus cleaning up: Troy Glaus hit cleanup Sunday for the third
time this season, even though in his first two games in that spot
he was 1 for 6 with three strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   But Collins said he wanted to break up lefties Mo Vaughn and
Garret Anderson in the lineup with a lefty (Bobby Jones) pitching
for Colorado. Also, Glaus had three home runs in the first two
games of the series.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Glaus went 0 for 4.
</P>
<P>
   Let's hear it for the O: The Angels offense has come around
lately, but their stretch of poor hitting had everybody searching
for answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried everything,'' Collins said. ``We tried everything
from things that I learned in my first year as a player to Rod
Carew and Larry Bowa and every idea they had. We exhausted every
idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now Darin's (Erstad) hitting, Garret's hitting, Mo's hitting,
Randy's (Velarde) hitting. When you're hitting the ball well, every
matchup looks good.
</P>
<P>
   Streak on: Velarde singled in the first inning Sunday, extending
his hitting streak to 10 games.

JAMES BARNES, 70, HELPED ALERT U.S. TO MISSILES IN CUBA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Texas)  (mk) 
 By WILLIAM H. HONAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   James Barnes Jr., who in 1962 piloted a U-2 spy plane that
helped alert the United States to the threat of a Soviet missile
buildup in Cuba, died last Tuesday at El Camino Hospital in
Mountain View, Calif. He was 70 and lived in Los Altos, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a stroke, his son Robert said.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes, a civilian contract pilot for the CIA, was flying over
Cuba in October 1962 when his cameras zoomed in on the missile
sites and touched off one of the most frightening confrontations of
the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   Because of a rivalry between the CIA and the Air Force _ the Air
Force believed that the CIA was stealing its best pilots and ground
crews _ the surveillance of Cuba was turned over to the Air Force.
</P>
<P>
   Today it remains a question whether Barnes or an Air Force U-2
pilot, Maj. Richard Heyser, was the first to detect the
construction of launching pads for offensive missiles that drove
the superpowers on a collision course. It may be that one pilot
photographed launching pads for missiles of an unknown range and
power while the other produced incontrovertible evidence that the
preparations were for potentially devastating Soviet SS-4 attack
missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever took the critical pictures, they wound up on the desk of
President Kennedy within a day or two, beginning an intensive
series of discussions by senior government officials. The outcome
was Kennedy's televised speech to the nation on Oct. 22, 1962,
warning that America was on the brink of nuclear war.
</P>
<P>
   At almost the last minute, Prime Minister Nikita Khrushchev
accepted a proposal from Kennedy. Khrushchev withdrew the missiles
in exchange for an American pledge not to invade Cuba and bring
down the government of Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes, who was born on Aug. 6, 1928, and raised in Beaumont,
Texas, took up flying at the age of 16. He paid his way through the
University of Texas at Austin by flying crop-dusters for six months
of the year and attending classes the other half.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from college, he joined the Air Force and
completed the cadet program in 1952 at Hondo Field, Texas. Soon he
was flying F-86 Sabre jets in the Korean War.
</P>
<P>
   In 1956, Barnes was recruited by the CIA to enter one of the
first groups of civilian contract pilots to fly the new U-2 spy
plane. These spider-like jets, which could reach the astounding
altitude of 73,000 feet, were thought to be able to operate safely
above the range of the best Soviet ground-to-air missiles.
</P>
<P>
   That belief was shattered in 1960 when a Soviet SA2 missile
brought down a U-2, whose pilot, Francis Gary Powers, then faced a
show trial in Moscow. The incident led to the cancellation of a
summit meeting between Khrushchev and President Eisenhower.
</P>
<P>
   Living at a CIA air base in Ankara, Turkey, at that time, Barnes
was Powers' next-door neighbor and, he told his son Robert, flew a
diversionary raid the same day Powers was shot down, in an effort
to draw Soviet fighter aircraft away from Powers.
</P>
<P>
   On this or another risky mission over the Soviet Union, Barnes
photographed a high-performance Soviet MIG-21 firing a missile at
his U-2. But the missile missed, because neither the MIG nor its
missile could maneuver effectively in the thin air of extreme
altitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barnes had an excellent record,'' said John Shinn, a fellow
U-2 pilot who now lives in Lakewood, Colo. ``He flew the U-2 for 33
years. I don't think anyone can beat that.''
</P>
<P>
   Carmine Vito, a retired U-2 pilot who lives in Austin, Texas,
recalled that when practicing touch-and-go U-2 landings on an
aircraft carrier, an aileron on Barnes' planes tore loose. ``He
could only turn in one direction,'' Vito said, ``but instead of
ditching, he left the scene and took the plane safely back to
Edwards.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes was based at Edwards Air Force Base, where the CIA
maintained a clandestine fleet of U-2 aircraft, when he began
flying surveillance missions over Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``The CIA was interested in some suspicious activity in Cuba at
that time,'' Robert Barnes said his father had told him. ``Then,
when Dad told our mother that his cameras had determined that the
launching pads they were making were for offensive, not defensive,
missiles, my mother came out of the house and said there was a
threat of nuclear war and we couldn't leave the house. I was only 5
or 6 at the time, but I remember it.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his son Robert, of Chico, Calif., Barnes is
survived by another son, James III, of Mountain View, a daughter,
Barbara Mayfield of Ukiah, Calif., and two sisters, Nancy Payne and
Maryjo Moore, both of Longview, Texas.

IGOR BELSKY, 74, FORMER DIRECTOR OF KIROV BALLET 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JENNIFER DUNNING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Igor Belsky, the artistic director of the Vaganova Ballet
Academy of St. Petersburg and a former director of Russia's Kirov
Ballet, died at a hospital in St. Petersburg on July 3. He was 74.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a stroke, said Igor Stupnikov, the St. Petersburg
correspondent for The Dancing Times of London.
</P>
<P>
   A genial, humane dance enthusiast all his life, Belsky began his
career as a performer with the Kirov, which he joined in 1943
following training at the Leningrad Ballet School (later renamed
the Vaganova Ballet Academy) and the Institute for Theater Arts. He
danced with the Kirov for 20 years, becoming known for his gifts as
a character or dramatic dancer of clarity and intensity.
</P>
<P>
   A choreographer noted for his innovation, Belsky was at the
forefront, with Yuri Grigorovich, of a trend in Soviet ballet that
began in the late 1950s and that emphasized the importance of
musical interpretation. His ballets tended toward the heroic and
sometimes to satire.
</P>
<P>
   His first ballet, ``The Coast of Hope,'' created in 1959 for the
Kirov, was a romantic celebration of Soviet man's loyalty and
courage. Belsky's 1961 ``Leningrad Symphony'' paid tribute to
Soviet man's spirit during wartime. His choreography often
addressed modern issues and incorporated athletic and work
movements. Belsky turned toward satire in his 1963 version of ``The
Little Humpbacked Horse,'' a fairy-tale ballet, and his 1969
staging of ``The Nutcracker'' attempted to draw closer to the dark
original tale by E.T.A. Hoffmann.
</P>
<P>
   Belsky's most famous roles with the Kirov included Shurale in
Leonid Jacobson's 1950 ``Ali-Batyr'' (later ``Shurale'') and Nurali
in Rostislav Zakharov's ``Fountain of the Bakhchisarai.'' He was
the chief choreographer and artistic director of the Maly (now
Modest Mussorgsky) Theater in Leningrad (now St. Petersburg) from
1962 to 1973, of the Kirov from 1973 to 1977 and of the Leningrad
Music Hall from 1979 to 1992.
</P>
<P>
   His best-known ballets also included his 1967 ``Gadfly'' and his
1974 ``Icarus.''
</P>
<P>
   Belsky's teaching career began with classes in character dance
at the Leningrad Ballet School from 1943 to 1956 and resumed for
several years in the mid-1960s. He began teaching choreography at
the Leningrad Conservatory in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   Belsky was named director of the Vaganova Academy in 1992. At
the academy, Belsky made a point of exposing the students to
contemporary Western choreography. But he continued the strict
training principles developed by Agrippina Vaganova in the 1930s.
Results were achieved by ``severity, severity, and again,
severity,'' he told Robert Johnson in 1998 in The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Lyudmila Alekseyeva, a former Kirov
soloist, and a son, Nikita, both of St. Petersburg.

EDITORIAL: WHAT JAMES FARMER LEAVES BEHIND 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Monday, July 12:
</P>
<P>
   James Farmer, the former head of the Congress of Racial
Equality, who died on Friday at 79, was the last of the major civil
rights leaders of his generation, and one of the first to begin the
struggle. Moved by what he had learned in college of Gandhi's use
of nonviolent disobedience, Farmer founded CORE as a local group in
Chicago in the early 1940s, and it was there that he first used
Gandhian tactics to integrate the White City Roller Skating Rink.
</P>
<P>
   It worked in Chicago, and chapters sprang up east and west, in
New York, Philadelphia, Los Angeles and Seattle. But it was
unthinkable to try to take the effort into the deep South in the
1940s.
</P>
<P>
   It was not until the late 1950s and early '60s that black and
white civil rights activists began to defy the laws and customs of
segregation in places like Alabama and Mississippi. To endure the
consequent broken skulls and jaws and legs, to suffer shootings,
burnings, bombings and lynchings, all without violent resistance,
so that the nation could learn from the example of what was done,
required a depth of courage and dignity and faith that has never
been surpassed in the history of this nation.
</P>
<P>
   Farmer was one of the principal leaders of that time. He
directed the daring Freedom Rides that began integrating interstate
bus service in the South in 1961. ``My father was a Freedom Rider,
I'm a Freedom Rider's son,'' he would sing out in jail. ``He was
one of the founding fathers not just of the New South, but of the
New America,'' said Rep. John Lewis, who was beaten unconscious and
jailed with Farmer on one of the bus rides.
</P>
<P>
   Farmer and CORE also formed an important bridge between the more
traditional, legalistic organizations, like A. Philip Randolph's
Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, Roy Wilkins' National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People and Whitney
Young's Urban League, and the newer groups that grew in street
power as the 1960s progressed. Among these were the Southern
Christian Leadership Conference of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.
and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee led by Lewis,
Julian Bond, James Foreman and others.
</P>
<P>
   Together, James Farmer and the others led the effort to overcome
a system of legal oppression that had endured, in one form or
another, from the beginning of the nation. That is achievement
enough for their generation. The effort to win greater
responsibility, and economic opportunity, remains for ours.

SAMUEL SANDERS IS DEAD AT 62; ACCOMPANIED NOTED PERFORMERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ALLAN KOZINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Samuel Sanders, a pianist who was the recital partner
of choice of Itzhak Perlman, Mstislav Rostropovich, Robert White
and many other instrumentalists and singers, died Friday night at
New York Presbyterian Hospital. He was 62 and lived in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was liver failure, said Lee Walter, his press
representative.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders was a gregarious musician who looked a bit like Woody
Allen and had a quick and often ribald sense of humor that endeared
him to the musicians he worked with, several of whom became
lifelong friends. But he also regarded the business of accompanying
as serious, exacting work, and he was one of the first pianists to
insist that an accompanist should be regarded as a soloist's
partner rather than as a subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   When he joined the faculty of the Juilliard School, in 1963, he
persuaded the school to establish a master's degree program for
accompanists, and he demanded that his name be listed in all
advertisements for concerts in which he was to perform, a practice
other accompanists quickly adopted. He also campaigned to open the
field to women at a time when virtually all accompanists were men.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders preferred the term collaborator to accompanist, but
admitted that it was a clumsy and not entirely satisfactory
alternative. Often, he likened his job to that of a catcher on a
baseball team.
</P>
<P>
   ``The catcher is in on every play, and he really does see the
whole field in a way that no other player sees it,'' he once told
an interviewer. ``In a sense, that's the position most accompanists
and chamber pianists are in. They have the whole score in front of
them. Now, the pitcher is the glamour figure. But if there's an
errant pitch, the catcher has to be there. I expect the musical
equivalent all the time. At the very first concert I ever
accompanied, the singer began a Bach aria and immediately skipped a
page. My reaction was instantaneous: I went right to where she was.
It was a combination of knowing the piece, luck and having good
reflexes.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders was born in the Bronx on June 27, 1937, and he has said
that he would rather have been a baseball player than a pianist.
But a congenital heart ailment _ a hole between the right and left
ventricles, called tetralogy of Fallot _ made it difficult for his
blood to absorb oxygen, leaving him breathless and with a blue
pallor.
</P>
<P>
   His heart problem set the course of his life. When he was 9
years old, he underwent an operation that improved his condition,
but he remained unable to participate in rigorous childhood
activities. It was because of this that his mother bought him a
used upright piano and hired a teacher. As an adult, he pursued a
robust touring career, but was sidelined several times for open
heart surgery, including two transplants, in 1990 and in May.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders made his New York recital debut at Town Hall when he was
13, and he performed as a soloist with the New York Philharmonic
when he was 16. But he was ambivalent about a pianistic career. ``I
was talented, and I loved classical music,'' he said, ``but I
didn't particularly love piano music. I didn't even like going to
piano recitals. My teachers would drag me along and say, `Did you
see how wonderful those thirds were?' And I could only think, `Let
me out of here.' ''
</P>
<P>
   As a student at Hunter College, he took film courses and
considered becoming a film composer. But he also began accompanying
friends in recitals, among them White, who had been a child star
and was a classmate at Hunter, and he quickly found collaborative
performance more satisfying than solo playing. In 1959 he enrolled
at the Juilliard School to study with Sergius Kagen, a pianist who
had done considerable accompanying, mostly of singers. Sanders
joined the school's faculty after he completed his master's degree.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders won a special citation for his work with Stephen Kates,
the cellist, at the 1966 Tchaikovsky Competition in Moscow. By the
late 1960s he was performing regularly with Perlman, Pinchas
Zukerman and Jaime Laredo, all violinists, as well as White, the
tenor, and Paula Robison, the flutist, all young soloists in the
early years of their careers.
</P>
<P>
   Other musicians Sanders worked with frequently include the
singers Beverly Sills, Jessye Norman and Hakan Hagegard, the
cellists Leonard Rose, Yo-Yo Ma, Lynn Harrell, Jacqueline du Pre
and Rostropovich. He maintained his interest in young musicians as
well, performing in the 1990s with the violinists Joshua Bell and
Rachel Barton, and Andres Diaz, a cellist. He made dozens of
recordings with these musicians. Two of them, both with Perlman,
won Grammy Awards.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders was an avid chamber player. In 1980, he established the
Cape and Islands Chamber Music Festival, on Cape Cod. He performed
frequently with string quartets, including the Juilliard, the St.
Lawrence and Borromeo, and he formed several ensembles of his own,
including Musica Camerit and Zephyr.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders is survived by his companion, Susan Rothwell, a
daughter, Sophie, and a brother, Martin, all of New York. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, July 12:
</P>
<P>
   Surely there are better ways for congressional lawmakers to
demonstrate their love of country than to dilute Americans'
free-speech rights.
</P>
<P>
   This simple truth continues to elude the House of
Representatives. For the third time in four years, the chamber has
approved a constitutional amendment that would undermine the right
of free expression by allowing Congress to prohibit the physical
desecration of the American flag. Once again, it is up to the
Senate to block this assault on the Bill of Rights.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, supporters of the flag amendment appear just two
votes shy of the two-thirds majority in the Senate required to send
the measure to the states for almost certain ratification. That
margin is much too close for comfort given the demagogy the issue
still inspires fully a decade after the Supreme Court ruling
holding flag-burning to be constitutionally protected free speech.
</P>
<P>
   Much depends on the resolve of the two Democratic senators from
North Dakota, Kent Conrad and Byron Dorgan. In May, they announced
their opposition to the so-called Flag Desecration Amendment, and
there is bound to be enormous pressure placed on them to
reconsider. By continuing to stand firm, they will render an
enormous service to the First Amendment and to the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The flag is in no danger. Historically, there have been very few
reported episodes of flag-burning, and no new epidemic looms on the
horizon. The immediate danger is to the Constitution.

seating, like the 17-screen complex, above and below, in New
Brunswick. Though audiences are flocking to the spacious
megaplexes, people are staying away in droves from the multiplexes
of shoe-box size theaters that have been a mainstay of shopping

<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The story of Texas education, as told by
presidential contender George W. Bush, is one of resounding
success.
</P>
<P>
   At fund-raisers and in stump speeches, the Texas governor tells
of rising test scores and improved student achievement. Minority
students have made great strides, he says. Black fourth-graders,
when compared with their peers in other states, lead the nation in
reading.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's accounts of school success in Texas have become prime
fodder for the national news media. But how much credit does the
governor deserve?
</P>
<P>
   A review of the record indicates that the state's most important
school reforms _ including standardized tests and other
accountability measures _ took root long before Bush moved into the
Governor's Mansion. Education experts, and even Bush aides, say
that his predecessors are more responsible for improvements in
Texas education.
</P>
<P>
   What Bush has done, they say, is resist making changes to the
system while advocating improvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he has done is tighten the educational accountability
system and made it more efficient,'' said David Beckwith, a
spokesman for Bush's presidential campaign. ``Education has been
his top priority for the state. He's proud of what Texas has been
able to accomplish.''
</P>
<P>
   Beckwith says Bush has always acknowledged the contributions of
his predecessors, such as Dallas billionaire H. Ross Perot, who led
a study of Texas education problems in 1983; Democratic Gov. Mark
White, who signed reform legislation in 1984; and Lionel ``Skip''
Meno, education commissioner under Democratic Gov. Ann Richards.
</P>
<P>
   But such acknowledgments, as might be expected during a run for
public office, have been largely absent during the campaign.
Instead, Bush points to improving scores on the Texas Assessment of
Academic Skills test, created by the Legislature in 1989, or on the
National Assessment of Educational Progress exam, a standardized
test administered to a random sampling of students in most states.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get blamed for what happens when you're governor, so you
better take credit for what happens when you're governor,'' said
White, who was governor from 1983 to 1987. ``But the fact remains
that most of the kids who graduated from high school this year
learned to read when I was governor.''
</P>
<P>
   The accountability system, touted repeatedly by the Bush
campaign, has received praise from all quarters: from business
groups, education professionals _ even the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   Developed over the past 15 years, the accountability system is
designed to ensure that all students, regardless of race, ethnicity
or household income, learn skills and facts that Texas officials
believe are central to a child's learning.
</P>
<P>
   Schools are held responsible for the performance of minority
groups, impoverished students, special education students and even
non-English speakers on the TAAS test.
</P>
<P>
   But TAAS is only one component. Schools must also meet daily
attendance and dropout prevention goals. Based on those criteria,
all schools receive a rating of exemplary, recognized, acceptable
or low-performing.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are high. Exemplary schools are eligible for
additional state money and become desirable destinations for
students and teachers. Conversely, low-performing schools are often
stigmatized and can be taken over by the state if they don't
improve.
</P>
<P>
   Researcher Philip Uri Treisman, director of the Charles A. Dana
Center for Educational Innovation at the University of Texas at
Austin, described a growing consensus regarding Texas education.
Public schools, at least at the elementary and junior high levels,
have made real and measurable advances, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The evidence is overwhelming,'' said Treisman, a
mathematician. ``And you don't need some statistical technique to
see it. It's improving by leaps and bounds over the last four
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Between 1992 and 1996, for instance, the percentage of Texas
fourth-graders achieving the NAEP's ``proficient'' level rose from
15 percent to 25 percent _ far outpacing advances made in other
states. That placed Texas fifth among 42 states and the District of
Columbia in 1996, according to a Dana Center study. The national
average was 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the Bush campaign has touted an improvement in
third-grade reading scores. In 1999, 86 percent of the third-grade
students passed the reading portion of TAAS, according to the Texas
Education Agency, up from 77 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The achievement gap between Anglo and minority students, as
measured by those test scores, has diminished. (In 1994, for
instance, there was a 40 percentage point difference in the passing
rate between Anglo and African-American students; by 1998, that gap
had narrowed to 21 percentage points.)
</P>
<P>
   Texas high schools, however, are a different story. ``There is
no real evidence that we've made gains,'' Treisman said.
</P>
<P>
   MORE &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Despite larger percentages of 10th-graders passing the TAAS,
including more minority students, large numbers of minority and
economically disadvantaged students continue to fail some portion
of the exam.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, for instance, more than 40 percent of economically
disadvantaged students failed some portion of the 10th-grade TAAS _
a requirement for graduation. Likewise, 45 percent of
African-American students and 41 percent of Hispanics failed some
portion last year.
</P>
<P>
   The dropout rate also remains a serious concern.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Texas Education Agency reports that the rate has
declined in recent years, a 1996 state auditor's report questioned
the accuracy of the agency's figures. According to the state
auditor, the rate could be more than double what the agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
   And some groups, like the San Antonio-based Intercultural
Development Research Association, say the state attrition rate _
the number of high-school-age young people not accounted for _
increased by 30 percent between the 1985-1986 school year and
1996-1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where are these kids going? What's happening to them?'' asked
state Sen. Gonzalo Barrientos, D-Austin, citing the IDRA figures.
``You know, it's always good politics to talk about education, and
it's logical that the governor would want to take some credit.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there are some other areas that definitely need
improvement.''
</P>
<P>
   Treisman and other scholars say progress that has been made in
Texas schools this decade can be traced to legislation written in
1993 by state Sen. Bill Ratliff, R-Mount Pleasant _ two years
before Bush took office.
</P>
<P>
   Besides revamping the school finance system, 1993's Senate Bill
7 created a plan to allow the state to take control of
low-performing schools.
</P>
<P>
   Treisman and others said Senate Bill 7 was built on the
foundation of previous school bills, including 1989's Senate Bill
40, which created TAAS, and similar bills during the 1980s. Perot
led much of that early effort as chairman of a special panel on
education, appointed in 1983 by White.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1993, Ratliff and others said, lawmakers have left the
state's accountability system largely unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have done a lot of work on the education code, but the
accountability system is virtually the same as what we put in,''
said Ratliff, who in 1993 was chairman of the Senate Education
Committee. ``And I think that this is the major reason that things
are improving.''
</P>
<P>
   Rand Corp. researchers David Grissmer and Ann Flanagan, writing
in a 1998 study of educational gains in North Carolina and Texas,
agree with Ratliff's assessment, stating that Texas politicians
created ``statewide academic standards ... (by) the late 1980s and
early 1990s and supported (them) consistently thereafter.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rand researchers, however, credit Bush for building on early
reforms _ for creating a ``continuity critical to long-term
success.''
</P>
<P>
   Every newly elected governor _ especially from a different
political party _ presents the possibility of policy changes. But
the Rand researchers and others note that Bush stayed the course.
</P>
<P>
   Said one longtime Capitol observer: ``He could have just come in
and deep-sixed the whole thing, but he was wise enough to let
(others) set up the system. That's something to be said for Bush _
he never played a destructive role.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush claims credit for pushing for more basic instruction in the
state's curriculum and for promoting legislation to end social
promotion, the practice of advancing academically unprepared
students to the next grade level.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, he also signed Senate Bill 1, which revised the Texas
education code by further restricting the authority of the Texas
Education Agency and giving more autonomy to local schools and
districts. But that legislation, sponsored by Ratliff, was based
largely on recommendations predating Bush's tenure.
</P>
<P>
   In this year's session, Bush signed into law a bill providing
teachers with a $3,000 pay raise. He campaigned for a smaller pay
raise.
</P>
<P>
   ``He deserves some credit, but he's never claimed it all,''
Beckwith said. ``People needing help reading are getting help. ...
Teachers are getting better paid, and test scores are rising.''

 By PAUL ZIELBAUER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME, N.Y. _ If there ever was a symbol of what Woodstock is
not, the hulking gray B-52 bomber casting shadows over Chestnut
Street is it.
</P>
<P>
   B-52s, after all, were raining bombs on North Vietnam about the
time in August 1969 that Country Joe McDonald was leading hundreds
of thousands of people in a sing-along antiwar chorus of ``One,
two, three, what are we fighting for?''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the B-52 on Chestnut Street is about to become part of
rock-and-roll history: it will be the first thing that the latest
iteration of the Woodstock generation sees when the legendary
concert's third coming begins on July 23 at the former Griffiss Air
Force Base.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the original Woodstock, in Bethel, N.Y., became
synonymous with the sloping and eventually muddy meadow of Max
Yasgur's farm, the Woodstock '99 site may become part of the
concert's lore.
</P>
<P>
   ``The irony is terrific,'' said Woodstock's creator, Michael
Lang, 54, wearing blue jeans and the mop of curly brown hair he had
as a whey-faced kid in 1969, when he produced Woodstock with $2.5
million and a little help from his friends. ``Everybody gets it,''
he added, nursing a frosted mug of beer at a restaurant here
recently. ``It's almost like revenge. You get to use this
billion-dollar facility for a rock concert.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the promoters have sold 150,000 of the $150 tickets to
the three-day festival and hope to sell twice that amount by show
time, Lang said. But based on their experience, he said, the
organizers are preparing for as many as 375,000.
</P>
<P>
   Woodstock stopped being just a rock concert some time ago. The
1969 event that defined a generation without selling a single
concert T-shirt is now Woodstock.com, Woodstock '99 Pay Per View
and Woodstock the home video and compact-disc set, due out in time
for Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   There are other notable differences, too.
</P>
<P>
   At the first Woodstock, enterprising hippies sold glasses of
water for a quarter. Woodstock '99 is trucking in 14 cash machines,
and Cellular One is building an extra transmitting tower on the
base for the thousands of mobile phones that people will be
carrying. Back then, people slept in fields of mud; this year, Ace
Hardware (``the place for Woodstock '99'') is offering free
Woodstock '99 camping sites, including toilets and showers, to
anyone who buys $100 worth of gear from its on-site store. In 1969,
moreover, Lang zipped around Bethel's green acres on an old
motorcycle and on horseback; nowadays, he negotiates Rome behind
the wheel of a black Range Rover.
</P>
<P>
   And where the fed-up townfolk of Bethel booted its supervisor
from office three months after the hordes of concertgoers clogged
roads and camped out on lawns 30 years ago, the city of Rome,
population 44,000 and dwindling, has seized on Woodstock '99 to
harvest some lost civic pride.
</P>
<P>
   ``The community is ready, poised,'' said Mayor Joseph A. Griffo,
41, a Republican who is known locally as ``the rock-n-roll mayor''
because of his taste for rock concerts and the croonings of U2.
``If the city can pull off this thing, it's a city that can make
things happen.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, Woodstock and Rome are perfect for each other.
Since the Pentagon closed the 3,000-acre Air Force base in 1993, as
part of an overall military downsizing, local officials have
debated what to do with Griffiss. First they considered building a
Nascar speedway on it, then using it for a concert by the band
Phish. When Lang called in November to ask for permission to hold
his $30 million show here, Rome all but named him an honorary
citizen.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the concert's producers say that Griffiss, with its
military-sized expanses of pavement, fields, parking and chain-link
fence, is particularly well suited for the event. They say the
1,100-acre concert site should provide plenty of room for people to
park and camp and enough security to stop the gate-crashers who
made up a large portion of the crowd in Bethel and at the 1994
Woodstock concert in Saugerties.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get 250,000 people on a site like this,'' said Mel
Lawrence, a member of the 1969 crew who is Woodstock '99's special
projects director, ``it's real conducive to a mellow event.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   If not exactly mellow, the setting seems designed to capture,
even magnify, all that has changed since the summer of 1969: The
bands will play in a grass field next to a 2-mile runway built to
accommodate B-52s and not far from a compound of stubby buildings
where nuclear warheads were stored underground. On the other side
of the tarmac are two cavernous hangars once used to repair fighter
jets and bombers. Lawrence plans to convert one hangar into a
theater for a film festival. (``Woodstock,'' ``A Hard Day's Night''
and ``Sid and Nancy'' are on the movie list.) The other hangar will
become an all-night dance club with disk jockeys and live music.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the first day, it stops being a concert and becomes a
place where you live,'' Lang said, echoing a thought that many
expressed, despite the mud, the rain and the other miseries, 30
years ago. ``It's a place where you feel safe and comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the B-52 on display at the gate, the concert seems built in
mega-proportions, from the 3.6 mile ``Peace Wall,'' which will be
sold off to benefit the American Red Cross, to the 260-acre
campground and the concert's triple-layer security system.
</P>
<P>
   ``The festival site will be surrounded, for the most part, by a
12-foot wooden wall,'' Dan Flynn, the concert's security chief,
told residents of Rome at a town-hall-style gathering in late June.
Sentries will stand on the wall. In addition, 1,200 guards will
roam the grounds. New York State Police will patrol the outer
perimeter.
</P>
<P>
   Whether those efforts succeed will not be known until the
three-day festival begins on July 23. And the promoters are
certainly aware that similar measures at the 1994 festival on a
farm in Saugerties were no match for the tens of thousands of fans
who showed up without tickets and poured through the gates
unimpeded.
</P>
<P>
   Those who get in this time will have more than music to keep
them occupied: an ``extreme sports'' complex for skateboarders and
rock climbers, a sculpture park, a post office, a shopping area, a
hospital unit, a canvas-tent wedding chapel (four weddings are
scheduled) and three two-acre beer tents.
</P>
<P>
   None of this, of course, was at the original Woodstock concert,
which featured 28 bands on a single stage and 500,000 people
crammed into a 250-acre meadow. The top ticket price then was $21.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of one of the drummers for the Grateful Dead,
none of the original performers will be at Woodstock '99. Limp
Bizkit has replaced Joan Baez; instead of Country Joe McDonald,
there will be the Insane Clown Posse; Hendrix is dead, but Ice Cube
lives on.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had no mosh pit, we had no cell phones, no MTV, no ATMs,''
said Duke Devlin, 56, a jolly, thickly bearded fellow who in 1969
hitchhiked from a New Mexico commune to attend the original
concert. Now he works for the Woodstock press office. ``Things
didn't work. We got wet. `I am you and you are me,' that was the
phrase.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the corporate tie-ins to this Woodstock concert, Lang
seems eager to rub away the commercial varnish that clung to the
1994 concert, which proffered an official soft drink (Pepsi) and
ice cream (Haagen-Dazs) as well as ``peace condoms.'' This year,
Woodstock's public relations people are saying the event has no
official sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, some critics wonder whether Woodstock spent all its
spiritual capital during the original show in 1969. ``My perception
is that it's a brand name, a kind of event that doesn't really
exist anymore,'' said Fred Goodman, author of ``The Mansion on the
Hill: Dylan, Young, Geffen, Springsteen and the Head-On Collision
of Rock and Commerce.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Woodstock happened because it wasn't well planned,'' he went
on. ``That couldn't happen now, whether it's because of insurance
reasons or the bands wouldn't stand for it. The frontier is gone.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lang, still smarting from media accounts in 1994 that
portrayed the selling of Woodstock as a kind of cultural cirrhosis,
believes such concerns become irrelevant once the music starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether you have prepackaged condoms or not, if you're
listening to this incredible music and bonding with all of these
new friends you've made around you, the experience is the same,''
he said. The Woodstock vibe, he said, ``just got bigger; it didn't
get different.
</P>
<P>
   Lang added: ``If I had a corporate sponsor who was willing to
give me $500 million, they would be here. The kids could have cared
less. It was no deal at all, except for the media.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps even more than Lang, who says he lost approximately $6
million on the two previous Woodstock shows and seems prepared to
lose more if necessary, the citizens of Rome _ a city that built a
$170,000 Museum of Cheese in 1988 to lure tourists _ need Woodstock
'99 to be a commercial success.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Griffiss supplied this region with 5,000 civilian
jobs and hundreds of millions of dollars in residual revenues. Then
it closed and left the Mohawk Valley town grasping to fill the
void.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an opportunity for us to shine,'' Sylvia Fragafane, a
local business owner, said at the town-hall-style meeting after
several people complained about the expected traffic tie-ups.
``It's also an opportunity for us to feel good about ourselves,''
she said, as dozens of people broke into loud applause. ``So let's
pull together!''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fragafane's exhortation will be put to the test on July 23,
when Rome is expected to swell to more than 400,000 residents, 10
times its normal size. The local chamber of commerce predicts the
concert will pump $30 million into the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a warm and friendly people,'' Griffo, the rock-n-roll
mayor, assured his constituents at the town meeting. No one wants
to believe that more than Griffo, an ambitious politician who has
banked this, his last year in office, on Woodstock's success.
</P>
<P>
   He would not be the first politician to go down in psychedelic
flames if Woodstock gets out of hand. In the November 1969
election, the Bethel town supervisor, Daniel Amatucci, was narrowly
defeated after a campaign that had one issue: the concert.
</P>
<P>
   With the concert date quickly approaching, workers are now
beginning to build the two main stages and erect the security
barrier.
</P>
<P>
   And if Devlin is any indication, the spirit of Max Yasgur's farm
is beginning to take hold in the shadow of that B-52. ``If I walked
on this base in 1969 with a tie-dye shirt on,'' said Devlin, clad
in exactly such a garment, ``I'm sure I would have had a spotlight
on me and guns pointed at me.''
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years later, he said, ``This is Woodstock, man.''

BEST AND BRIGHTEST VIE FOR NAACP HONORS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By AMY WALDMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ One minute Dorian Logan was sneering and abusive as
Sgt. Waters in Charles Fuller's ``A Soldier's Play.'' The next he
was languid, and then quivering with fear as C.J. Memphis, the
guitar-strumming private whom the sergeant accuses of murder. And
the next, he was first cool and then explosive, as Pfc. Melvin
Peterson, who shoots Waters on C.J.'s behalf.
</P>
<P>
   One young man, three parts, one masterly performance.
</P>
<P>
   Make that one of many turns of talent at the Afro-Academic
Cultural, Technological and Scientific Olympics, or ACT-SO, which
began Friday at two hotels in midtown Manhattan and concludes
Monday. Sponsored by the National Association for the Advancement
of Colored People, the competition is held each year at the
association's convention.
</P>
<P>
   More than 800 black students from NAACP branches around the
United States, accompanied by coaches, mentors, advisers and some
parents, assembled to compete in 25 categories such as oratory and
mathematics. The winners are to be announced Monday, after the
students march en masse to the New York City Center Theater.
</P>
<P>
   Logan, who is 18 and hails from Detroit, was a contestant in the
dramatics category. The competition was stiff _ he was sandwiched,
for example, between a young woman who performed an original piece
about a young slave raped by her master, and another young woman
who composed a tribute to Paul Robeson.
</P>
<P>
   The same was true in other categories. B'Randy Brooks and
Tiffanie Gray, both 17, stood feet apart, both having performed
opera selections in the classical vocal category, both hoping
victory would be theirs, both wanting to pursue careers in opera.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brooks, who is from Altadena, Calif., had beads in her hair
and confidence in her voice. She had just performed the Queen of
the Night's famous aria from Act II of Mozart's ``Magic Flute.''
``I presented it well,'' she said. ``I think this is the year for
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gray was equally self-assured after singing an aria from
Pergolesi's opera ``La Serva Padrona,'' ``Stizzoso, Mio Stizzoso,''
which she translated, roughly, as ``peevish one, my peevish one.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I did really really well,'' she said. ``That's the best I ever
performed that song.''
</P>
<P>
   But while most of the participants said they certainly wanted to
win, the event's spirit was more friendly than cutthroat. ``We're
here for one thing _ to focus on what we want to do for the rest of
our lives,'' Ms. Brooks said. ``We're not killing each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gray agreed: ``Everyone here is like you,'' she said.
``Smart, talented, into something.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the participants seemed united in celebrating
their achievements, and they delighted in defying what they said
were stereotypes about young blacks.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``I enjoy being with my peers who are exactly like me _
successes,'' said Kia Marie Cook, 17, of Milwaukee, who was at
ACT-SO for the fourth straight year and had entered the sculpture
and the original essay competitions.
</P>
<P>
   Her entries reflected the strong opinions about American history
and race relations that many of the students expressed in entries
across a wide range of forms. Her sculpture, of painted clay and
acrylic, was of a woman's head on a distorted American flag _
distorted, she said, like the American dream, which has become the
empty chase of ``money, fame, riches.''
</P>
<P>
   Her essay, meanwhile, was about school violence. ``It's been
going on for years,'' Ms. Cook said. ``Once it started happening to
the suburban towns, it became a problem,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, many of the entries, in categories like biology and
computer science, were more technical than political.
</P>
<P>
   And this year there was a new category, entrepreneurship,
initiated, perhaps unsurprisingly, by the New York chapter.
Contestants had to come up with a business concept and a financial
and marketing plan. The ideas included a new magazine for black
families, a drive-through coffee shop, and a dance school in
Guyana.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was born, said Anton Tomlinson, the chairman of New
York City's ACT-SO chapter, from the queries of the event's
sponsors, businesses that wondered whether the young people would
go on to help their companies grow.
</P>
<P>
   The idea, Tomlinson said, is to teach students to build their
own communities. ``Don't just wait for someone else to do it,'' he
said.

EICHELBERGER HOLDS ON FOR U.S. SENIOR TITLE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By MICHAEL ARKUSH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST DES MOINES, Iowa _ On an afternoon dominated by two
surprise contenders, one slipped and the other surged. Dave
Eichelberger, and not Ed Dougherty, claimed the biggest golf
tournament of his life, the U.S. Senior Open.
</P>
<P>
   Dougherty had been the leader for the first three rounds at Des
Moines Golf and Country Club, and still had a share of the top spot
with five holes to go. But Dougherty's double bogey on the 14th,
coupled with Eichelberger's birdie moments later at No. 15, his
seventh of the day, essentially handed the championship to a player
whom nobody expected to win. Perhaps, even Eichelberger himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``After I finished, I was kind of in a state of shock there for
a few minutes and started to shake a little bit,'' said
Eichelberger, 55, who earned $315,000. ``But I recovered after a
while. I have been trying to get my name on a USGA trophy for 30
years now, and it feels good to have finally done it.''
</P>
<P>
   Eichelberger, who briefly held the lead earlier in the day after
beginning one-shot out, fell behind and then tied Dougherty with a
3-foot birdie putt at the 12th hole. After the birdie at 15 that
suddenly gave him a three-shot advantage, he played pretty
conservatively. He recorded only one bogey on the back nine for a
magnificent final-round 68 and a 7-under-par 281.
</P>
<P>
   It was then up to Dougherty to rebound from his first miscue of
the day, but it didn't happen. Dougherty, who is relatively unsung
and had been a huge crowd favorite here, was done.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is discouraging in the sense that I didn't accomplish the
win,'' said Dougherty, who shot a final-round 72 to finish in
second place, three strokes behind Eichelberger. ``But I honestly
don't feel that I blew this tournament. I hit a lot of quality
shots. Dave Eichelberger is the man who won this tournament. He
went out and shot a phenomenal round of golf. I just wasn't good
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither, for that matter, was the defending champion, Hale
Irwin. He, like Eichelberger, was one-stroke back entering the
final round and could only manage a 73, finishing in a tie for
third, five strokes back. ``The game just wasn't there,'' said
Irwin, who missed good birdie opportunities at Nos. 6, 8 and 9.
``It wasn't there all week. Of all the times to have the putting go
south, this was not one of the days. My concentration and focus was
just not sharp.''
</P>
<P>
   It was quite a contrast to his impressive victory at the Ford
Senior Players Championship, two weeks earlier. ``I think I feasted
a couple of weeks ago,'' Irwin said. ``Now after eating the feast,
I have got to clean the dishes.
</P>
<P>
   Gil Morgan, Irwin's main rival the last two years, was also
within range for much of the day, but his putting game failed at
crucial times. He could never get closer than two shots down on the
back nine. ``There's just not really much to say,'' said Morgan,
still without a victory in 1999. ``I don't know what the problem
was, but when I needed it, it wasn't there.
</P>
<P>
   It was certainly there for Eichelberger, who won only four times
on the PGA Tour. His senior career hasn't exactly been spectacular.
In 1995, for instance, he recorded 11 Top-10 finishes, good enough
for 16th on the money list. So even though his performances had
been pretty mediocre so far this year, his emergence at such a
pivotal moment is not a complete shock.
</P>
<P>
   ``That has kind of been the gist of my career for 35 years, said
Eichelberger. ``Three weeks of great play followed by a couple of
years of mediocrity. Fortunately, the good weeks have been good
enough to kind of keep me in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Dougherty lost, he will leave town with wonderful
memories of the galleries, which gave one standing ovation after
another.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody got inspired by the crowd,'' said Dougherty. ``This
crowd brought out the best.''

NO NOSTALGIA, BUT AN ECHO OF OLD DRUMS
</HEADLINE>
   (With WOODSTOCK-30TH) 
(js) 
 By AARON DONOVAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Of the hundreds of musicians who will perform at Woodstock '99,
only one is a veteran of Woodstock '69.
</P>
<P>
   Mickey Hart, 55, a drummer for a quarter-century with the
Grateful Dead, is scheduled to lead his band, Mickey Hart Planet
Drum, at this year's concert.
</P>
<P>
   He says no one could ever re-create the original concert, but
feels that is no reason not to play Woodstock for a third time.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never can re-create an event exactly,'' Hart said in an
interview over the weekend. ``You can't do it. They shouldn't come
with that expectation. They should come with an expectation of
making it an event of their own. They should come with an open
heart, and an open mind, and just be.''
</P>
<P>
   As Hart looked back fondly on the original Woodstock, he said
this year's concert would be fundamentally different from the
original _ but he implied that the difference is not a bad thing.
</P>
<P>
   He said that his band should not be viewed as a nostalgia act.
``We've done that, been there. This is so much more exciting than
with the Grateful Dead. It's new. The Grateful Dead was for that
generation. It was perfect for them, but it would be out of place
now.''
</P>
<P>
   At the original Woodstock, he said, he was awed by the size of
the event and the number of famous musicians. This time, after
years of playing with the Dead, he's accustomed to playing for big
crowds.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can find magic in a lot of places,'' he said, ``but you
can't get it if you repeat it over and over again. Perfection
doesn't equal magic. The young kids just think if they keep playing
the right notes everything will be all right; but it's not the
right notes that matter. It's the magic, stupid.''

BASEBALL CAPITAL CELEBRATES BELGIUM 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By GLENN COLLINS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. _ To the uninitiated, it may seem exceedingly
odd _ daft, perhaps? _ to honor the tiny, distant nation of Belgium
at the epicenter of the great American pastime during the high
season of baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, in the first Belgium Comes to Cooperstown
festival, a two-day effusion of Belgianophilia that ended Sunday
with a beer tasting, the Belgian Tourist Office sponsored a
celebration of its nation's culture and way of life. It drew nearly
a thousand tourists, Belgium worshipers and beer lovers.
</P>
<P>
   The turnout was even more surprising since this
baseball-worshiping village that was once home base for James
Fenimore Cooper has barely recovered from a string of excitements:
the overnight ``listening tour'' invasion by Hillary Rodham Clinton
last week; the 100th anniversary bash for the town's scholarly
ornament, the New York State Historical Association, on Friday; and
the 60th anniversary celebration of Cooperstown's renowned National
Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum on June 12.
</P>
<P>
   Festivalgoers swarmed to a Belgian be-in that was a restaging of
the 450-year-old Ommegang Festival in Brussels. There was a Belgian
procession, complete with mock 16th-century costumes provided by
the Belgian government. There were Belgian sausages (flavored, of
course, with Belgian beer) and Belgian chocolates.
</P>
<P>
   Revelers waited in long lines for Belgian brews and Belgian
Liege-style waffles. There were traditional Belgian puppets,
Belgian lace trimmings and even a raffle of limited-edition comic
books featuring that Belgian icon, Tintin.
</P>
<P>
   But, Belgium?
</P>
<P>
   ``The Belgian connection makes perfect sense,'' said Elinor
Vincent, chairman of Cooperstown's weekly newspaper, The Freeman's
Journal, founded in 1808. ``A Venezuelan festival wouldn't work,
but here, as in Belgium, we are rural, and we still have a viable
farming community, as Belgium does. And Cooperstown was once the
hops capital of America.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in the 19th century, Cooperstown village was called Hops
City, after the plant that is used to preserve and flavor beer.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 80 percent of the American hop crop was grown in this
area through the 1860s, 1870s and 1880s,'' said Dr. Gilbert
Vincent, president of the Farmers' Museum, a mile north of town
center.
</P>
<P>
   Frederique Raeymaekers of the Belgian Tourist Office noted that
the modest nation of 10 million people by the North Sea, in an area
scarcely larger than New Jersey, has been enjoying extraordinary
American visibility of late. Belgian beers, brewed for sipping with
food, have quadrupled their sales in the United States in the last
decade.
</P>
<P>
   The United States now imports $35.3 million worth of chocolate
from Belgium annually, more than from any other country, according
to the latest Customs Service statistics. In New York City, there
has been an explosion of shops that offer Belgian-style
double-fried potatoes. And no fewer than five eateries now inhabit
a new restaurant district in Manhattan known as Little Belgium,
centering on 14th Street and Ninth Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   These days, the Cooperstown region is hardly Little Belgium, but
it does boast Brewery Ommegang, a one-and-a-half-year-old maker of
Belgian-style beers that is the first and only U.S. joint venture
of three Belgian beer makers and American microbrewers.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Idelson, director of communications for the Baseball Hall
of Fame, said with a laugh that ``we do not feel any competition
with Belgium,'' noting that attendance at the Baseball Hall of Fame
was up 24 percent in the first six months of 1999, on pace to far
exceed last year's total of 331,284. ``There are no Belgian Hall of
Famers, but the brewery is definitely Hall of Fame material,'' he
said collegially.

But 40 years after Alaska became a state, 20 years after land-claim
disputes in the oil rush led Congress to give the people known as
``subsistence gatherers'' priority rights to fish and game, and 10
years after the state's highest court declared that protection
unconstitutional because such natural bounty was for the ``common

   WOODSTOCK-30TH (Rome, N.Y.) _ If there ever was a symbol of what

North Vietnam about the time in August 1969 that Country Joe
McDonald was leading hundreds of thousands of people in a
sing-along anti-war anthem of ``One, two, three, what are we
fighting for?'' Yet the B-52 on Chestnut Street is about to become

LILITH FESTIVAL AT GORGE GOES OUT ON SPUNKY, FUN-LOVING NOTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By D. PARVAZ  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The crowd for the second of Lilith Fair's weekend shows at the
Gorge Amphitheater in George, Wash., was considerably denser than
the previous night's _ not to mention louder and far more gung-ho.
</P>
<P>
   It was sunny, they were at the Gorge, and they were happy with
the free samples of wet-wipes and perfume being handed out by the
women's music festival's vendors.
</P>
<P>
   For all the grumbling about Lilith Fair's commercialism and
political agendas, you just can't criticize its charitable nature.
At a brief press conference before Friday's show, singer-songwriter
and festival founder Sarah McLachlan presented two checks, each
worth about $10,000, to the Eastside Domestic Violence Center and
the Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault Program.
</P>
<P>
   Now on with the show ...
</P>
<P>
   The only all-girl act at Lilith (even the ordinarily all-girl
Luscious Jackson has a couple of men touring with them), the
precocious Los Angeles duo of Heather Grody and Leisha Hailey (a k
a the Murmurs) could re-write the book on how to talk dirty and
influence people. Folksy in their acoustic guitar style and all
punk in spirit, the Murmurs ruled the Village Stage.
</P>
<P>
   On the second stage, Bijou Phillips told the crowd that
Saturday's show was her sixth live performance ever, which didn't
stop her from really seemingto connect with the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips has a frail, little-girlie sort of voice that works
well with the more hushed songs, but gets lost in her beefy back-up
band's noise during the more rockin' numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Phillips cared. She just bopped around the stage.
</P>
<P>
   The second stage should have been called ``The Beth Orton
Stage.''
</P>
<P>
   Orton on Saturday did a set that was as good, if not better than
the previous night's. With a voice built on staggering breaths and
a suffering brand of poise, Orton was unstoppable.
</P>
<P>
   Four boys, a girl and a La's cover that should've never happened
(``There She Goes''), Sixpence None the Richer sounded just like
their self-titled CD _ dull.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there was some serious booty-shakin' going on on the
main stage, starting with Mya's oh-so MTV set.
</P>
<P>
   Mya had some amazing dancers with her (stolen, it would seem,
from a Gap television ad) and definitely held her own. She opened
with ``Ghetto Superstar,'' the song she did for the ``Bulworth''
soundtrack. The song lacked something without rapper ODB and crew
leading the way. Mya has a sweet, hushed kind of voice _ an
endearing Janet Jackson-esque brand of cute.
</P>
<P>
   What's frustrating is her lack of originality. She has the
pipes, she has the opportunity. Why not write songs that in some
way (any way) distinguish her from all the other soul/dance
artists?
</P>
<P>
   The one surprise Mya pulled on the audience was a tap number she
performed with percussive accompaniment. It was well executed and
very entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   A mish-mash of tan lines and sunburns danced wildly to Luscious
Jackson's grooves. As it did the night before, the band had Ashwin
Sood, McLachlan's drummer/husband, drop in on the hand-drums for a
few numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Liz Phair is not the shy creature her recordings and interviews
would lead you to think she is. Although tiny in stature, she
positively roars across the stage. And she smiles more than you'd
think (if you've listened to her albums, that is). There's a
morose, weighty quality to Phair's voice: If a pout had a voice, it
would sound like Liz Phair's.
</P>
<P>
   She was backed up by some great musicians. The drummer wasn't
just a dumb beat in the background, and someone really knew his way
around a wa-wa pedal on stage, because when they tore into
``Supernova,'' all of Grant County knew it.
</P>
<P>
   Songs like ``6' 1'''' and ``Never Said'' (both off ``Exile in
Guyville'') turned the crowd inside out, as did a couple of numbers
off an as-yet unreleased album.
</P>
<P>
   Sandra Bernhard provided comedically unsettling moments between
sets. She sang Aerosmith's ``Dream On'' and proved she could do a
better Steven Tyler than Tyler himself.
</P>
<P>
   Sheryl Crow could also probably sing circles around Tyler. She
opened with ``Change Would Do You Good'' and then strapped on her
bass for ``My Favorite Mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   The thing about Crow that makes her so darn watchable on stage
is that she doesn't seem to take herself at all seriously. She's
just there, having a ball and letting you join in on the ride. She
even brought Luscious Jackson out for a cover of the Who's
``Squeeze Box.''
</P>
<P>
   The grand finale, of course, was McLachlan. Through the late
'90s, McLachlan went from being just another pretty voice to being
an entire industry. McLachlan was never considered just a pretty
voice back in her native Canada, however. In fact, she's pretty
much been a superstar there since the late '80s.
</P>
<P>
   Her presence on stage threw the crowd into a frenzy. Impassioned
cries of ``I love you, Sarah!'' were in the air, and McLachlan,
always demure (if mildly flirtatious), coyly returned the
affection.
</P>
<P>
   She touched on the fact that this was the last Lilith Fair tour,
saying that after three years, she wanted to end things on a high
note. Well, she succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   She opened with ``Possession'' (the song that launched a lawsuit
by a fan saying that McLachlan had used elements of his letters to
her for the song) and continued down the list of her hits (``Sweet
Surrender,'' ``Hold On,'' etc.).
</P>
<P>
   With her strong, sensuous voice and warm stage presence, it's no
wonder her fans feel as though each of them has a personal
relationship with McLachlan.
</P>
<P>
   It'll be interesting to see if anyone steps up after this tour
is over, because until they do, Rolling Stone magazine might have
trouble coming up with any year-of-women-in-music type covers.

FYHRIE HAS ROCKY TIME AGAINST ROCKIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ The barbecue at the Fyhrie household must have been a
bomb.
</P>
<P>
   It was just last Tuesday that Huntington Beach native Mike
Fyhrie made his first major-league start for the Anaheim Angels in
front of about 50 friends and family at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   Fyhrie pitched well and the Angels won that one, so surely many
of the same people gathered to watch Sunday afternoon's game
against the Colorado Rockies on TV.
</P>
<P>
   Problem was, Fyhrie was done even before the grill was warm.
Fyhrie didn't make it out of the first inning, giving up seven runs
in an 8-2 loss before 42,485 at Coors Field.
</P>
<P>
   The setback ended the Angels' winning streak at four and sent
them into the All-Star break 6{ behind Texas in the AL West. It
slowed the momentum the Angels had been building, but they said it
didn't stop it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came in here and won two in this ballpark _ we've got to be
happy with it,'' Angels manager Terry Collins said. ``The last
three weeks, outside of the Texas series, we've played very good
baseball. We came in here and said we wanted to win the series and
we won it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels have won five of their past six series, so Sunday's
loss won't have an affect on the club, first baseman Mo Vaughn
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just let it go, this didn't do anything,'' Vaughn said.
``We'll be ready to go in the second half. This team's been playing
consistent. We'll be all right.''
</P>
<P>
   Fyhrie said he was all right Sunday, even if the numbers didn't
show it. His previous performance last week against the Mariners
earned him Sunday's start. He went seven innings and gave up two
runs and six hits in the Angels' 8-2 victory.
</P>
<P>
   But on Sunday Fyrhie failed to retire any of the first five
Rockies hitters he faced. Larry Walker drove in the first run with
a single and Vinny Castilla had the big blow, a bases-clearing
three-run double that made it 4-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I made some quality pitches down in the strike zone,
but (home-plate umpire Jerry Meals) called them balls,'' Fyhrie
said. ``I had to raise my pitches a little and in this park, balls
up will kill you.
</P>
<P>
   Fyhrie got Todd Helton to fly out for the first out of the
inning, but Kurt Abbott followed with an RBI single. One batter
later, Rockies pitcher Bobby Jones doubled home a run to make it
6-0 and Collins had seen enough.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Schoeneweis _ the first of five Angels relievers _ entered
the game and gave up an RBI double to Jeff Barry (the run charged
to Fyhrie), and when the inning was finally over, the Angels
trailed by a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   After allowing seven runs and six hits in two-thirds of an
inning, Fyrhie's ERA rose from 2.57 to 10.56.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what to say,'' Fyhrie said. ``They hit the ball
and found holes. I'm just frustrated I didn't give the team a
chance to win. I had heard all the horror stories about pitching
here.... It's very deflating, especially when the team's on a roll.
We're making a run. We had a chance to sweep.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the hits Fyhrie allowed left the park. In fact, there
were no home runs in the game for either team, only the second
homerless game this season. It was the 22nd homerless game in Coors
Field's 6{-year history.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their early deficit, the Angels were playing in a place
where seven-run deficits can disappear in a hurry. Also, the Angels
had scored nine runs in each of the first two games of the series.
</P>
<P>
   They scored two runs in the third inning on Darin Erstad's
sacrifice fly and Randy Velarde's RBI groundout, then loaded the
bases with one out in the fourth, knocking Jones out of the game.
</P>
<P>
   But the deficit didn't disappear.

RECENT VIOLENCE PROVES IT'S TIME TO REVISE STEREOTYPE OF WHITE
SUPREMACISTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICK MONTGOMERY  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hate-group watchers say educated, affluent types have long
subscribed to racist movements, including the Ku Klux Klan. In
fact, a study found that members of Idaho's ``patriot'' cause in
the late 1980s tended to have slightly higher levels of education
and incomes than white Americans as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think white supremacists have always mirrored the
demographics of the nation,'' said Devin Burghart of the Center for
New Community, which monitors hate groups in the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Ben Smith and his ilk,'' said Burghart, ``are part of a
new generation of young, articulate, self-styled, self-motivated
haters.
</P>
<P>
   ``These groups are using college campuses as fertile ground to
recruit a kind of racist intelligentsia. They've given the old,
emotional arguments a pseudo-intellectual feel.''
</P>
<P>
   Jared Taylor has emerged as one of the more scholarly champions
of the white crusade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, running around shooting people is reprehensible,''
said Taylor, a Yale University graduate and editor of the
conservative magazine American Renaissance. ``But it's not beyond
my comprehension as to what motivated this man.... Why should
whites rejoice at the prospects of their diminishing influence and
diminishing numbers in this country?''
</P>
<P>
   While branding Smith's actions as those of a ``certifiable nut
case,'' Taylor said people who share Smith's views ``live in a
country that promotes policies that will reduce their people to a
minority, and they're angry about it.'' He added: ``I suspect
there's going to be more Ben Smiths.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor stirred controversy last year with his book, The Color of
Crime, which noted that black-on-white violent crimes far exceeded
white-on-black violent crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say that such statistics overlook the fact that the vast
majority of all violent crimes are either white-on-white or
black-on-black. As for offenses classified as racial ``hate
crimes'' in 1997, the FBI reports that ``anti-white'' attacks
numbered 993 compared with 3,120 ``anti-black'' attacks. Smith's
killing spree ``doesn't surprise me at all,'' said Charles E.
Smith, president of the Kansas City, Mo., branch of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People. ``Racism has
nothing to do with class or formal education....
</P>
<P>
   ``You can get an education on paper but you need one of the
heart, an education of common sense and decency. It begins at home
on day one.''
</P>
<P>
   William L. Pierce earned a doctorate in physics. But that didn't
keep him from writing The Turner Diaries, a white supremacist
screed that is thought to have inspired Oklahoma City bomber
Timothy McVeigh.
</P>
<P>
   Vincent Bertollini and Carl Story amassed fortunes by building
computer-chip companies in California. And last fall, according to
news reports, they paid for the distribution of white supremacist
posters and videos to 3,000 homes in northern Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   Those who advocate racial violence may not always fall into the
traditional underclass, but in their own minds ``they still think
that they're victims,'' said Chip Berlet of Political Research
Associates.
</P>
<P>
   And, others contend, Ben Smith's rampage can serve as a lesson
to all Americans, as did the Colorado high school shootings.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no easy answers, no easy scapegoats,'' said Daniels,
author of White Lies: Race, Class, Gender and Sexuality in White
Supremacist Discourse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all need to engage in a more open, sophisticated dialogue.
For a lot of white families, race is a taboo subject. Kids are
being told that race is no big issue, when obviously it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``And liberals who talk a big game about compassion and
diversity need to start looking at where they choose to live. So
many kids of all ethnicities live in an environment where they
rarely encounter other kinds of kids. I think you saw that in Ben
Smith's case, and you saw it in Littleton.''

   Picture a white supremacist. Some might see the stereotype that
author Jessie Daniels describes in a book on the topic: A
``beer-swilling, shotgun-toting, pickup driving, gap-toothed,
trailer dwelling, cousin-marrying'' half-wit.
</P>
<P>
   Make way for Benjamin Smith.
</P>
<P>
   The man who carried out last weekend's shooting rampage in
Illinois and Indiana was the product of affluence, quality schools
and white-collar parents in Midwest suburbia.
</P>
<P>
   Could he reflect, as some experts contend, a ``new generation''
of well-heeled hatred?
</P>
<P>
   When Smith, 21, revved up his Ford Taurus and began hunting down
members of minority groups, he defied a common portrait of white
supremacists drawn by sociologists decades ago. Here, apparently,
raged a racist driven not by ignorance or personal hardship but by
political ideology.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's upbringing, some point out, resembled that of the
hate-filled shooters at Columbine High School. In a word,
comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is disturbing when you can't distinguish these people from
the general population,'' said Idaho State University sociologist
James Aho. ``They could be your next-door neighbor.''
</P>
<P>
   As Don Black, a computer whiz who runs a white supremacist Web
site, told USA Today: ``We're not trailer-trash people with bad
teeth, or high school dropouts. We are not illiterate,
unsophisticated people.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider their recruiting tactics. On college campuses and the
Internet, groups such as the World Church of the Creator _ to which
Smith belonged _ circulate racist and anti-Semitic views with a
buffed-up, intellectual sheen, experts on hate groups say.
</P>
<P>
   One pamphlet of the World Church of the Creator shows the
group's 29-year-old leader, Matt Hale, in a dark suit and tie. The
literature uses selective statistics, biological research, IQ
scores and the quotes of Abraham Lincoln and Albert Schweitzer _
all intended to lend respectability to arguments that ``the white
race possesses more intellectual capability'' and that the
Holocaust is bunk.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities say Smith killed two persons and injured 12 in a
rampage aimed at Jews, blacks and Asians. While police chased him
in a stolen van late last Sunday, Smith killed himself.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was the son of a physician and a real estate agent in
suburban Chicago. He attended an elite public high school and then
the University of Illinois, where he studied computer science. He
left in early 1998 after being charged with attacking his
girlfriend and possessing marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   He then enrolled at Indiana University and switched his major to
criminal justice. He and Hale intended to become lawyers _ a
profession that many white supremacy groups are trying to steer
members into, according to experts.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, in an article he wrote for the World Church of the
Creator newsletter in March, said his ``racial awakening'' began in
eighth grade. That's when he ``was forced to learn about the Jewish
`Holocaust,' '' he wrote. ``The entire course was made to instill a
strong and lasting sense of white guilt....
</P>
<P>
   ``What set me into action was when I was forced to live in the
dorms'' at the University of Illinois, he continued. ``I was from a
well to do, mostly white neighborhood (with significant Jew
infestation), but now...muds were everywhere I looked. I could not
escape them.''
</P>
<P>
   The World Church of the Creator called Asians, Hispanics and
African-Americans ``muds,'' or ``mud people.''
The racial epithets and emotions are ancient. But the motivations
of hatemongers have been redefined in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, sociologists relied on landmark studies by
researchers Daniel Bell and Seymour Lipset to explain the racist
and anti-Semitic viewpoints of the ``radical right.'' Most members
were found to be lacking in education and social standing.
</P>
<P>
   Experts concluded that economic distress caused racists to
``scapegoat,'' or to blame their own failures on minority groups
and alleged Jewish conspiracies.
</P>
<P>
   Today assumptions are shifting, said Leonard Zeskind, a Kansas
City, Mo., author who last year received a grant from the MacArthur
Foundation for his research into extremist groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``You take a demographic slice of white America and a
demographic slice of these extremist movements, they're going to
look very similar,'' he said. ``It's not economics that's
motivating a lot of these people, it's politics and ideology.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this post-Cold War age, what we have on our hands is an
ethic of ultranationalism worldwide,'' he said, pointing to ethnic
cleansing in Kosovo and militia activities in the United States.

Make way for Benjamin Smith. The man who carried out last weekend's

   LOS ANGELES _ The Los Angeles Dodgers ended the season's first
half Sunday afternoon looking like they finally have started
something.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of a 14-3 victory over Seattle that gave them four
consecutive victories heading into the All-Star break, the Dodgers
puffed out their sunken chests for an epic 15-minute scuffle that
had the Dodger Stadium crowd of 43,231 yelling for more.
</P>
<P>
   As the rumble rolled from the mound to second base to near the
Mariners dugout, it was the clear the teams were battling over much
more than a high-and-tight fastball by Frankie Rodriguez with two
outs in the sixth that nearly struck Mark Grudzielanek in the face.
</P>
<P>
   This was the season of frustration unfolding for two teams
expected to be better.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were fighting for a year that has never come together; they
were fighting for getting swept in the series,'' said coach Rick
Dempsey, one of seven ejected after the brawl. ``There was a lot of
energy on that field getting released.''
</P>
<P>
   And when players and coaches finished rolling around, a folk
hero came out of the dust: Trenidad Hubbard _ hitting machine,
martial artist and ... backup catcher.
</P>
<P>
   His five RBI were a career high and his emergency duty behind
the plate was his first appearance there since 1993, when he played
in the Houston Astros organization. He had never played there in
the big leagues, but starter Angel Pena injured his left forearm in
the fight and rested Todd Hundley was ejected for throwing punches
and obscene gestures at the Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   Although the fans went wild when Eric Karros followed
Grudzielanek with a shot into the left-field stands that capped a
five-run inning, they saved their best for Hubbard, who came in
from left field to put on the equipment to start the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   ``The place was really charged up after the fight,'' Hubbard
said. ``When they called me in from left field, I was like Austin
Powers. I said, `Yeah, baby.' ''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Dempsey, Hundley and Pedro Borbon were ejected
for the Dodgers. For Seattle, Jay Buhner, Jose Paniaqua, Damaso
Marte and Jose Mesa were thrown out. Because this was an
interleague game, the presidents from each league will punish their
clubs.
</P>
<P>
   More serious were the injuries. Seattle's reserve infielder
Charles Gipson suffered a separated right shoulder in the fight and
could be lost for the season. Mariners left fielder Brian Hunter
hyperextended his left knee, but is expected back after the break.
Pena bruised his left forearm and Dave Hansen needed stitches to
close a cut on his right pinky. Both are day-to-day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we'll be OK,'' said Dodgers manager Davey Johnson.
``The team is starting to play better, and that is a good sign for
the second half.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers enter the break last in the National League West, 10
games behind division leading San Francisco and one game back of
fourth-place Colorado. By winning four straight, they finished the
first half 39-47, their worst record at the break since 1987.
</P>
<P>
   The tension began Friday night, when Dodgers starter Ismael
Valdes hit two Seattle batters and Mariners right-hander Freddy
Garcia hit the leadoff hitter the next two innings.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, the Dodgers had a 6-3 lead in the fifth when things
started falling apart for the Mariners. Pena, who had a two-run
homer and RBI single in the first three innings, was on third with
one out.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbard popped to short, where Alex Rodriguez drifted over to
make a one-handed catch. But then he fell and the slow-footed Pena
scored from third. When Hubbard hit a bases-clearing double the
next inning, the scene was set.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez's first pitch sailed at the head of Grudzielanek, who
took a few steps toward the mound. Rodriguez started yelling, as
did first baseman David Segui.
</P>
<P>
   The benches emptied, but at first there was little action.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ran out there thinking Mark got hit,'' Todd Hollandsworth
said. ``It was only after I got out there that I heard he hadn't
been hit. By then all hell had broken loose.''
</P>
<P>
   The fighting often was fierce, with Segui throwing some big
punches in the middle of the pile. And no one was spared. Buhner
was tossed because players on the disabled list are not allowed to
participate in fights. Sheffield, who had the day off before
leaving for the All-Star Game in Boston, ran onto the field and was
struck in the head by Marte.
</P>
<P>
   That set off Hundley. ``I saw that and took off running,'' he
said. ``By the time I got there, guys were holding me back. Then
Marte hit me.''
</P>
<P>
   Gipson separated his shoulder trying to separate players.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty intense in there,'' Hundley said. ``But when
you're on a team, you have to cover each other's backs. That Marte
really ticked me off. He was throwing sucker punches, then running
away, then coming back with more sucker punches. It was cheap and
pathetic. But we got him. I won't say who, but we got him.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Dodgers long man Jamie Arnold, who replays showed
pummeled Marte to the ground with two right-hand blows.
</P>
<P>
   Mariners manager Lou Piniella wasn't talking after the game.
Neither was Ken Griffey Jr., who broke out of 1-for-9 series slump
(seven strikeouts) with a two-run homer off Darren Dreifort (7-8)
in the third.
</P>
<P>
   ``When teams are frustrated, stuff happens,'' said starter Jeff
Fassero (4-9), who allowed six runs in three innings after throwing
eight scoreless innings against the Angels in his last start.
``Guys start yelling at each other, and something like this is
going to happen when you start doing that.''
